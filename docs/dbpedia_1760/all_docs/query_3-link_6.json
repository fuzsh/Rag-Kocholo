Compressed Mortality data are updated annually. The number of deaths, crude death rates or age-adjusted death rates can be obtained by place of residence (total U.S., Census or HHS regions, state, and county; urbanization level of residence for years 1999-present per the 2006 or the 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties; or core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) of 250,000 or more population, both the December 2005 and February 2013 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineation of CBSAs), age group, race (years 1968-1998: White, Black, and Other; years 1999-present: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, and White), Hispanic origin (years 1968-1998: not available; years 1999-present: Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or Latino, Not Stated), gender, year of death, underlying cause of death (years 1968-1978: 4 digit ICD-8 codes and 69 cause-of-death recode; years 1979-1998: 4-digit ICD-9 codes, 72 cause-of-death recode, and injury intent and mechanism; years 1999-present: 4-digit ICD-10 codes, 113 cause-of-death recode, and injury intent and mechanism). For more information, see Compressed Mortality File Topics below and http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/cmf.htm.\n\nPrivacy polices:\n\nAny use of Compressed Mortality statistics implies consent to the following confidentiality restrictions:\n\nUse these data for statistical reporting and analysis only.\n\nDo not present or publish statistics representing nine or fewer births or deaths, including rates based on counts of nine or fewer births or deaths, in figures, graphs, maps, tables, etc. Statistics representing one through nine (1-9) births or deaths are suppressed on CDC WONDER.\n\nMake no attempt to learn the identity of any person or establishment included in these data.\n\nMake no disclosure or other use of the identity of any person or establishment discovered inadvertently and advise the Confidentiality Officer in the National Center for Health Statistics of any such discovery.\n\nPhone: 888-642-4159\n\nEmail: nchsconfidentiality@cdc.gov\n\nSee Assurance of Confidentiality for more information.\n\nCause of death classifications:\n\nDue to changes in the classification for underlying cause-of-death adopted in 1979 and also in 1999, WONDER has separate query screens for CMF data for years 1968-1978, years 1979-1998, and for years 1999 and later.\n\nSource:\n\nCompressed Mortality File is produced by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). See Data Source Information.\n\nIn WONDER: You can produce tables, maps, charts, and data extracts. Obtain death counts, crude death rates and age-adjusted death rates, standard error and 95% confidence intervals for rates for user-specified geographic, cause of death, and demographic criteria. Mortality measures can be obtained for several levels of geographic detail: national, Census region, Census division, state, county and urbanization level. The population estimates used as the denominator for rate calculations are also shown.\n\nVariables: You can limit and index your data by any and all of these variables:\n\nLocation - U.S., HHS regions, or Census regions and divisions, state, county\n\nUrbanization - classification for counties\n\n1999-present: pick between the 2006 or the 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties; Metro and Non-Metro categories are available for the 2006 or 2013 schema.\n\n1968-1998: not available.\n\nCBSA - core-based statistical areas for metropolitan statistical areas of 250,000 or more population.\n\n1999-present: pick between the December 2005 or the February 2013 CBSA lists;\n\n1968-1998: not available.\n\nYear - 1968-1978, 1979-1998 and 1999-2016\n\nAge Group - pick between two lists of age groups:\n\n<1 year of age, 1-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years, 15-19 years, 20-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, 45-54 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years 75-84 years, and 85years and over;\n\ninfant age groups: < 1 day, 1-6 days, 7-27 days, 28-364 days\n\nRace\n\n1999-present: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, White;\n\n1968-1998: Black, White, Other\n\nHispanic Origin\n\n1999-present: Hispanic or Latino, Not Hispanic or Latino, Not Stated\n\n1968-1998: not available.\n\nGender (Sex) - Female, Male\n\nCause of Death - underlying cause of death classified by International Classification of Dieases (ICD):\n\n1999-present: ICD-10 codes, 113 selectted causes of death;\n\n1979-1998: ICD-9 codes, 72 seslected causes of death;\n\n1968-1978: ICD-8 codes, 68 seslected causes of death\n\nInjury Intent and Mechanism - for analysis of injury mortality in years 1979 and later\n\n1968-1998: not available.\n\nStatistical measures: The following statistical measures are available as query results:\n\nDeath Counts\n\nCrude Rates\n\nAge-Adjusted Rates\n\n95% Confidence Intervals for Rates\n\nStandard Errors for Rates\n\nPercent of Total\n\nSuppression and Unreliability:\n\nAll statistics representing fewer than ten (0-9) persons are suppressed for deaths in 1999 and later years. Sub-national statistics representing fewer than ten (0-9) persons are suppressed for deaths in 1989 and later years. The suppression constraint affects death counts, birth counts, rates and associated confidence intervals and standard errors, as well as corresponding population figures. See Assurance of Confidentiality for more information.\n\nCrude death rates and age-adjusted death rates are marked as \"unreliable\" when the death count is less than 20.\n\nTopics: Compressed Mortality Data Request\n\nData Source Information\n\nAdditional Information\n\nAge Adjustment of Death Rates\n\nAssurance of Confidentiality\n\nContact for Data Questions\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Death Rates\n\nInternational Classification of Diseases (ICD)\n\nICD 10th revision\n\nICD 9th revision\n\nICD 8th revision\n\nLocations: About County Geography Changes\n\nMortality Data\n\nInfant Mortality\n\nCMF Archives\n\nPopulation Estimates\n\nRace Reporting\n\nSuggested Citation\n\nAdditional Information\n\nSuggested Data Source Citations:\n\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services (US DHHS),\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\n\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),\n\nCompressed Mortality File (CMF) on CDC WONDER Online Database.\n\nThe current release for years 1999 - 2016 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2016, Series 20, No. 2V, 2017\n\nThe current release for years 1979 - 1998 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1968-1988, Series 20, No. 2A, 2000 and\n\nCMF 1989-1998, Series 20, No. 2E, 2003\n\nThe current release for years 1968 - 1978 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1968-1988, Series 20, No. 2A, 2000\n\nThe archive release for years 1999 - 2015 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2015, Series 20, No. 2U, 2016\n\nThe archive release for years 1999 - 2014 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2014, Series 20, No. 2T, 2015\n\nThe archive release for years 1999 - 2013 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2013, Series 20, No. 2S, 2014\n\nThe archive release for years 1999 - 2012 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2012, Series 20, No. 2R, 2014\n\nThe archive release for years 1999 - 2011 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2011, Series 20, No. 2Q, 2014\n\nThe archive release for years 1999 - 2010 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2010, Series 20, No. 2P, 2013\n\nThe archive release for years 1999 - 2009 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2009, Series 20, No. 2O, 2012\n\nThe archive release for years 1999 - 2008 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2008, Series 20, No. 2N, 2011\n\nThe archive release for years 1999 - 2007 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2007, Series 20, No. 2M, 2010\n\nThe archive release for years 1999 - 2006 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2006, Series 20, No. 2L, 2009\n\nThe archive release for years 1999 - 2005 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2005, Series 20, No. 2K, 2008\n\nThe archive release for years 1999 - 2004 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2004, Series 20, No. 2J, 2007\n\nThe archive release for years 1999 - 2003 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2003, Series 20, No. 2I, 2006\n\nThe archive release for years 1999- 2002 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2002, Series 20, No. 2H, 2004\n\nThe archive release with data for years 1999 - 2001 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1999-2001, Series 20, No. 2G, 2004\n\nThe archive release with data for years 1979 - 1999 is compiled from:\n\nCMF 1968-1988, Series 20, No. 2A, 2000 and\n\nCMF 1989-2000, Series 20, No. 2C 2001\n\nThe suggested citation including the original series for the data is shown below each table, chart or map.\n\nFor more information on archive data from previous releases, see CMF Archives.\n\nMortality data on the CMF are derived from micro-data death files produced by the National Center for Health Statistics. These files were derived from the National Vital Statistics System which contains information from death certificates collected by the States and tabulated by NCHS. Population data on the CMF are derived from Census Bureau files.\n\nRevisions and Errata:\n\nAbout revised 2014 deaths: A revised data file for 2014 was released on April 3, 2017 to include corrections affecting 125 deaths previously coded to \"Accidental discharge of firearms\"(ICD-10 codes W32-W34). This corrected file replaced the file released on December 9, 2015. The underlying cause of death changed for 125 deaths in 2014 that occurred in Tennessee (80%) and Massachusetts (20%). (Note: Data by state of residence are also impacted in Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina and Virginia for records where the death occurred in Tennessee or Massachusetts but the decedent was a resident of another state.) Prior to the revision, the underlying cause of death for all 125 deaths were classified as \"Accidental discharge of firearms\" (ICD-10 codes W32-W34). After the revision, 50% of the changed records are now classified as \"Assault (homicide) by discharge of firearms\" (ICD-10 codes *U01.4, X93-X95); 42% are now classified as \"Intentional self-harm (suicide) by discharge of firearms\" (ICD-10 codes X72-X74); 4% of the revised death records are now classified as \"Discharge of firearms, undetermined intent\" (ICD-10 codes Y22-Y24); and the remaining 4% to various other causes. For more information, please refer to Deaths: Final Data for 2014.\n\nAbout revised 1989 deaths: The 1989 data records for age groups 10-14 years and 25-34 years were revised on May 9, 2007 due to a data discrepancy in CMF 1989-1998, Series 20, No. 2E, 2003. Previously, 27 deaths in the 10-14 year age group were incorrectly recorded as deaths in the 25-34 age group.\n\nAbout rates for state and county combinations: Prior to September 18, 2015, when a Compressed Mortality query on CDC WONDER included both state and counties in the query criteria (e.g., death rates for New Hampshire and adjacent York County, Maine), the population figures and the subsequent rate calculations may have been incorrect because the population of the selected state may have been included twice.\n\nContact: For data questions that are not addressed in this document, e-mail nchsquery@cdc.gov.\n\nMortality Data:\n\nThe mortality data on the Compressed Mortality File are based on information from all death certificates filed in the fifty states and the District of Columbia. Deaths of nonresidents (e.g. nonresident aliens, nationals living abroad, residents of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and other territories of the U.S.) and fetal deaths are excluded. Mortality data from the death certificates are coded by the states and provided to NCHS through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program or coded by NCHS from copies of the original death certificates provided to NCHS by the State registration offices. For more information, see Technical Appendix from Vital Statistics of United States: 1999 Mortality.\n\nAbout cause of death classification:\n\nCause of death on the CMF is the underlying cause-of-death, which is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.\" Underlying cause-of-death is selected from the conditions entered by the physician on the cause of death section of the death certificate. When more than one cause or condition is entered by the physician, the underlying cause is determined by the sequence of conditions on the certificate, provisions of the ICD, and associated selection rules and modifications.\n\nUnderlying cause of death is classified in accordance with the International Classification of Disease. Deaths for 1968-1978 are classified using the Eighth Revision (ICD-8). Deaths for 1979-1998 are classified using the Ninth Revision (ICD-9). Deaths for 1999 and beyond are classified using the Tenth Revision (ICD-10).\n\nThe ICD-9 and ICD-10 classification systems are quite different. The ICD-9 system has a 4-digit numeric structure and about 5,000 categories for classifying causes of death. The ICD-10 system has a 4-digit alphanumeric coding structure and about 8,000 categories for classifying causes of death. Comparison of ICD-9 and ICD-10 shows that new chapters have been added to the ICD, old chapters have been rearranged, causes of death have been regrouped, and titles have changed. The differences between ICD-9 and ICD-10 make direct comparisons of cause of death difficult and result in discontinuities in cause-of-death trends. NCHS conducted a comparability study to measure the discontinuities between the Ninth and Tenth Revisions and computed comparability ratios for major causes of death. For further information on comparability of mortality causes between ICD-9 and ICD-10, please reference Comparability of Causes of Death Between ICD Revisions. For information on comparability of mortality causes between ICDA-8 and ICD-9, please see Estimates of Selected Comparability Ratios Based on Dual Coding of 1976 Death Certificates by the Eighth and Ninth Revisions of the International Classification of Diseases.\n\nFor deaths due to injuries and poisonings that occurred during 1968-1998, the External cause is coded (E800-E999) rather than the Nature of Injury (800-999). The letter \"E\" is included in the code in CDC WONDER.\n\nBeginning with data for 2001, NCHS introduced categories *U01-*U03 for classifying and coding deaths due to acts of terrorism. The asterisks before the category codes indicate that they are not part of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Description of the specific 4-digit codes can be found at NCHS Classifications of Diseases, and Functioning & Disability: Appendix I. Deaths classified to the terrorism categories are included in the categories for Assault (homicide) and Intentional self-harm (suicide) in the 113 cause-of-death list. Additional information on these new categories can be found at Classification of Death and Injury Resulting from Terrorism.\n\nReporting anomalies:\n\nAbout Georgia reporting anomalies in 2008-2009: Circumstances in Georgia for the years 2008 and 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code R99, \"Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\" for deaths occurring in years 2008 and 2009. Caution should be used in interpreting these data. For more information, see Deaths: Final Data for 2008.\n\nAbout New Jersey reporting anomalies in 2009: Circumstances in New Jersey for the year 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code R99, \"Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\" and therefore unusually low death counts in other ICD-10 codes, most notably R95 \"Sudden Infant Death Syndrome\" and X40-X49 \"Unintentional poisoning.\" Caution should be used in interpreting these data. Deaths: Final Data for 2009.\n\nAbout Allen Parish, Louisiana reporting anomalies in 2006-2008: Deaths for Allen Parish, Louisiana (FIPS code 22003] in years 2006 through 2008 are under reported due to problems with registering the deaths with the Louisiana Vital Statistics Office.\n\nAbout California reporting anomalies in 2000 - 2001: Circumstances in California resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code R99, \"Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\" for deaths occurring in years 2000 and 2001. Caution should be used in interpreting these data.\n\nAbout cause of death classification changes: Changes to cause of death classification affect reporting trends. For more information, see Changes in ICD-10 codes.\n\nAbout race and ethnicity reporting:\n\nRace and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the death certificate in accordance with standards set forth by the Office of Management and Budget. The American Indian or Alaska Native race category includes: North, Central, and South American Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts. The Asian or Pacific Islander race category includes Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Japanese, and Other Asian or Pacific Islanders.\n\nHispanic origin was not reported on the death certificate for some deaths. On the mortality file, missing Hispanic origin information is coded as \"not stated\". There is no corresponding population figure for this group. Therefore, deaths with Hispanic origin not stated are excluded when death rates are calculated by Hispanic origin.\n\nInformation included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. Studies have shown that persons self-reported as American Indian, Asian, or Hispanic on census and survey records may sometimes be reported as white or non-Hispanic on the death certificate, resulting in an underestimation of deaths and death rates for the American Indian, Asian, and Hispanic groups. Bias also results from undercounts of some population groups in the census, particularly young black males, young white males, and elderly persons, resulting in an overestimation of death rates. In \" Quality of death rates by race and Hispanic origin: A summary of current research, 1999,\" the authors estimate that the misclassification and under-coverage result in overstated death rates for the white and black populations (1% and 5%, respectively) and understated death rates for other population groups (American Indians, 21%; Asian or Pacific Islanders, 11%; and Hispanics, 2%). See also The validity of race and Hispanic Origin reporting on death certificates in the United States.\n\nFor 1979-2002, all 50 States and the District of Columbia collected race data on the death certificates using four single-race categories (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, and White) in accordance with the 1977 OMB standards, allowing only a single race to be reported. Beginning with the 2003 data year, some States began collecting race data in accordance with the 1997 OMB standards, allowing one or more of five race categories to be reported. In order to provide uniformity and comparability of mortality data during the transition from the single-race format to the multiple-race format, NCHS is \"bridging\" the race responses of those for whom more than one race is reported (multiple race) to one of the single-race categories. The bridging procedure is similar to the procedure used to bridge multiple-race population estimates. Multiple-race decedents are imputed to a single race (White, Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, or Asian or Pacific Islander) according to their combination of races, Hispanic origin, sex, and age indicated on the death certificate. The imputation procedure is described in detail at NCHS Procedures for Multiple-Race and Hispanic Origin Data.\n\nFor more discussion of race and ethnicity data in CMF, see Race and Ethnicity Questions.\n\nAbout \"Not Stated\" age or ethnicity:\n\nData for the \"Not Stated\" age category or the \"Not Stated\" Hispanic Origin category cannot be combined with any other specified age group or Hispanic Origin categories.\n\nThe \"Not Stated\" group is included in the \"All Ages\" or the \"All\" Hispanic Origin categories.\n\nDeath rates are not calculated for the \"Not Stated\" groups because there are no corresponding population denominator data for these groups.\n\nAbout the \"unknown county\" in Georgia for years 1981-1991:\n\nFor the years 1988 through 1991, if there were three or fewer deaths for a given Georgia county of residence (of deaths occurring in Georgia) with HIV infection (ICD codes *042-*044, 795.8) cited as a cause-of-death (underlying or non-underlying cause), these records were assigned a \"missing\" place of residence code (location code (FIPS code 13999).\n\nThese deaths do not appear in county death rates, but these deaths are included in the state and national death rates.\n\nPopulation&nbspData:\n\nThe population estimates on the Compressed Mortality File are U.S. Census Bureau estimates of U.S. national, state, and county resident populations. The estimates for 1968, 1969, 1971-1979, 1981 - 1989, 1991- 1999 and 2001-2009 are intercensal estimates of July 1 resident populations. The 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010 population estimates are April 1 modified census counts. The 2001-2009 population estimates are revised intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population (released by NCHS on 10/26/2012). The 2011-2016 population estimates are postcensal estimates of July 1 resident populations. The population estimates for 1991-2016 have bridged-race categories. For more information, see notes below and Population Information.\n\nSources of the population data, by year and type of estimate for the current 1968-1978, 1979-1998 and 1999-2016 CMF Date of estimate National Region, Division, State County July 1, 1968 - July 1, 1969 National intercensal estimates Obtained by linear extrapolation from the corresponding July 1, 1970 and July 1, 1971 state population estimates Obtained by linear extrapolation from the corresponding July 1, 1970 and July 1, 1971 county population estimates April 1, 1970 Sum of county modified census counts Sum of county modified census counts County modified census counts July 1, 1971 - July 1, 1979 National intercensal estimates Sum of county intercensal estimates County intercensal estimates April 1, 1980 Sum of county modified age-race-sex census counts Sum of county modified age-race-sex census counts County modified age-race-sex census counts July 1, 1981 - July 1, 1989 National intercensal estimates State intercensal estimates County intercensal estimates April 1, 1990 Sum of county modified age-race-sex census counts Sum of county modified age-race-sex census counts County modified age-race-sex census counts July 1, 1991 - July 1, 1999 Sum of bridged-race county intercensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county intercensal estimates Bridged-race county intercensal estimates April 1, 2000 Sum of bridged-race county modified age-race-sex census counts Sum of bridged-race county modified age-race-sex census counts Bridged-race county modified age-race-sex census counts July 1, 2001 - July 1, 2009 Sum of bridged-race county revised intercensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county revised intercensal estimates Bridged-race county revised intercensal estimates April 1, 2010 Sum of bridged-race county modified census counts Sum of bridged-race county modified census counts Bridged-race county modified age-race-sex census counts July 1, 2011 Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2011 postcensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates July 1, 2012 Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2012 postcensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates July 1, 2013 Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2013 postcensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates July 1, 2014 Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2014 postcensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates July 1, 2015 Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2015 postcensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates July 1, 2016 Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates Sum of bridged-race county Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates Note: all population estimates are estimates of the resident population of the United States.\n\nAbout national, state, and county population estimates:\n\nThere are national, state, and county population estimates on the CMF; for some years they are consistent with each other (sum to the same totals), for some years they are not. For years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 the state and county estimates on the CMF are consistent with each other, but not with the national estimates. For these postcensal years, the state and county estimates for all postcensal years are replaced with estimates from the most recent postcensal series when the file is updated each year. By contrast, the national estimates for the postcensal years are not revised when the file is updated annually, so that the national population estimates on the CMF will be the same as those used by NCHS to calculate published death rates. In order to replicate state or county death rates for year 2011 and later calculated using earlier versions of the CMF, please use the appropriate archived data.\n\nAbout revisions of postcensal estimates:\n\nChanges were implemented in the postcensal estimates methodology used for Vintages 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013 and 2016. Additionally, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 necessitated special modification of population estimates for the affected areas beginning with Vintage 2006. Methodology changes prior to 2010 affect estimates in archived CMF versions, but not estimates in CMF 1999-2010 and later as postcensal estimates for 2001-2009 have been replaced with intercensal estimates.\n\nAbout bridged-race population estimates:\n\nThe population estimates on the CMF for 1991 and later are bridged-race population estimates. Race bridging refers to making data collected using one set of race categories consistent with data collected using a different set of race categories, to permit estimation and comparison of race-specific statistics at a point in time or over time. Census 2000 permitted individuals to report more than one race which resulted in \"multiple-race\" population counts. The death certificate currently used by most States only permits one race to be reported for decedents (single-race categories). Thus, the multiple-race data collected on the 2000 census are not comparable with the single-race mortality data. Therefore, multiple-race population estimates have been bridged to single-race categories. For more information see U.S. Census Populations with Bridged-race Categories.\n\nAbout live births and \"under 1 year of age\" population estimates:\n\nFor years 1999 and later, the number of live births and estimates of the population under 1 year of age are both available as denominators in rate calculation on the CMF. The number of live births and the population estimate for the \"Under one year of age\" group differ slightly. NCHS live-birth data are used as the denominators in death rate calculations for \"Infant Age Groups\" so that neonatal mortality, post neonatal mortality, and infant mortality rates can be calculated. The population under one year of age is used as the denominator in death rate calculations involving the \"Under 1 year\" age group. Prior to August 2006, the number of live births was used for all rate calculations involving the \"Infant Age Groups\" and the \"Under 1 year\" age group. For years before 1999, the number of live births is used for all rate calculations involving both the \"Infant Age Groups\" and the \"Under 1 year\" age group. For more information, see Mortality for Infants.\n\nPopulation estimates for the age groups \"Under 1 year\" and \"1-4 years\" did not appear on some Census population files For 1968-89 state and county estimates and for 1970 and 1980 national estimates, the estimates for the \"0-4 years\" age group were multiplied by 0.8 to obtain estimates for the \"1-4 years\" age group; estimates for the \"under 1 year\" age group were then obtained by subtraction.\n\nAbout rounding:\n\nFor years 1968-69 and 1971-79, and 1981-1989, NCHS used national population estimates rounded to the nearest 1,000 to calculate published death rates. Estimates were rounded after aggregation across race, sex, or age groups. The national population estimates on the CMF for 1968-69 and 1971-79 are rounded to the nearest 1,000 in accordance with this practice. However, while NCHS rounded after aggregating across age, race, and/or sex groups, the population estimates in the CMF for aggregate groups are obtained by summing already rounded population estimates. As a result, national death rates for aggregate groups calculated using the rounded estimates on the CMF may differ slightly from those published by NCHS. Population estimates for years 1981-89 on the CMF are unrounded; hence, death rates calculated using the CMF also may differ slightly from those published by NCHS.\n\nAbout \"Not Stated\" age or ethnicity: Beginning with the August 2009 release of CMF data on WONDER online databases, data for the \"Not Stated\" age group or the \"Not Stated\" Hispanic Origin category cannot be combined with any other age group or Hispanic Origin categories, except for \"All\" age groups or \"All\" Hispanic Origin categories. Deaths for the \"Not Stated\" groups are not distributed among the other groups. Rates are not calculated for the \"Not Stated\" groups because there are no corresponding population denominator data for these groups.\n\nYou can select data for \"All\" age groups, or only for the \"Not Stated\" age group, or for any combination of the other age groups. Data for the \"Not Stated\" age group cannot be combined with the other specific age groups. Deaths of persons with \"Unknown\" or \"Not Stated\" age are included in \"All\" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups, so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates.\n\nYou can select data for \"All\" Hispanic Origin categories, or only for the \"Not Stated\" category, or for any combination of the other categories. Data for the \"Not Stated\" Hispanic Origin category cannot be combined with the other specific categories. Deaths of persons with unknown or \"Not Stated\" Hispanic Origin are included in \"All\" counts and rates, but are not distributed among ethnicity categories, so are not included in the specific Hispanic Origin group counts or rates.\n\nCompressed Mortality Data Request\n\nVariables: You can limit and index your data by any and all of the variables.

For example, you could select to group (summarize, stratify, index) your data by State and by County.\n\nHow? See How do I organize my data? for more information.\n\nHints:\n\nWhen age-adjusted rates are calculated, you cannot group the data by Age Group.\n\nAbout charts:\n\nYou cannot make charts when your data has more than two By-Variables.\n\nAbout maps:\n\nTo make a map, you must request data with a geographic location variable, such as State or County, as a \"By-Variable.\" Then click the Map tab.\n\nDeath Counts\n\nThe death counts in the data represent deaths that occurred in the 50 United States and the district of Columbia, for the legal place of residence of the decedent. See Mortality data for more information.\n\nAll statistics representing fewer than ten persons (0-9) are suppressed for year 1999 and later years. Sub-national statistics representing fewer than ten persons (0-9) are suppressed for year 1989 and later years. See Assurance of Confidentiality for more information.\n\nCrude Rates\n\nCrude Rates are expressed as the number of deaths reported each calendar year per the factor you select. The default factor is per 100,000 population, reporting the death rate per 100,000 persons.\n\nCrude Rate = Count / Population * 100,000\n\nSee Frequently Asked Questions about Death Rates .\n\nHints:\n\nRates calculated with population estimates are per 100,000 persons by default. However, infant mortality rates are calculated per 1,000 live births by default. Click \"+\" to open Additional Rate Options in section 1 on the Request Form tab, to select the factor for rate calculations.\n\nSelect the precision for rate calculations in the Other Options section. When the rate calculated for a small numerator (incidence count) is zero, you may increase the precision to reveal the rate by showing more numbers to the right of the decimal point.\n\nNotes:\n\nRates for small populations should be interpreted with caution.\n\nAll statistics representing fewer than ten persons (0-9) are suppressed for year 1999 and later years. Sub-national statistics representing fewer than ten persons (0-9) are suppressed for year 1989 and later years. See Assurance of Confidentiality for more information.\n\nRates are marked as \"unreliable\" when the death count is less than 20.\n\nCrude rates are helpful in determining the need for services for a given population, relative to another population, regardless of size. Crude rates are influenced by the underlying age distribution of the state's population. Even if two states have the same age-adjusted rates, the state with the relatively older population (as demonstrated by having a higher median age) will have higher crude rates because incidence or death rates for most cancers increase with increasing age.\n\nThe population estimates for the denominators of incidence rates are race-specific (all races, white, black, and other races combined) and sex-specific population estimates. The population estimates are aggregated from the most detailed level selected. For example, if you have requested data for the nation grouped by state and by county, then the populations are the county-level population estimates aggregated to the state and national summaries. See Population Denominator Data Sources below for more information.\n\nThe population for \"Infant age groups\" is the number of live births in the given time period. See Mortality for Infants for more information.\n\nPrior to August 2006, the number of live births had been substituted for the \"under 1 year\" age group population estimates. This substitution affected the \"under 1 year\" and \"all ages\" death rates slightly, when compared to published tables that rely solely on population estimates.\n\nAge-Adjusted Rates\n\nAge-adjusted rates are requested in the Section 1 on the Request Form tab.\n\nAge-adjusted death rates are weighted averages of the age-specific death rates, where the weights represent a fixed population by age. They are used to compare relative mortality risk among groups and over time. An age-adjusted rate represents the rate that would have existed had the age-specific rates of the particular year prevailed in a population whose age distribution was the same as that of the fixed population. Age-adjusted rates should be viewed as relative indexes rather than as direct or actual measures of mortality risk. However, you can select other standard populations, or select specific population criteria to determine the age distribution ratios. See Frequently Asked Questions about Death Rates for more information.\n\nThe rates of almost all causes of death vary by age. Age adjustment is a technique for \"removing\" the effects of age from crude rates, so as to allow meaningful comparisons across populations with different underlying age structures. For example, comparing the crude rate of heart disease in Florida to that of California is misleading, because the relatively older population in Florida will lead to a higher crude death rate, even if the age-specific rates of heart disease in Florida and California are the same. For such a comparison, age-adjusted rates are preferable. Age-adjusted rates should be viewed as relative indexes rather than as direct or actual measures of mortality risk.\n\nThe Compressed Mortality online database and NCHS age-adjusts death rates using the direct method. That is, by applying age-specific death rates (Ri) to the U.S. standard population age distribution.\n\nR' = S i ( Psi / Ps ) R i\n\nwhere Psi is the standard population for age group i and Ps is the total U.S. standard population (all ages combined).\n\nIn the direct method, a standard age distribution is chosen and the age-specific death rates are weighted according to the standard. A reasonable choice for the standard is the U.S. total population (all races, both genders) for the year under study. To permit comparison of death rates from year to year, a standard population is used. Beginning with the 1999 data year, NCHS adopted the year 2000 projected population of the United States as the standard population. This new standard replaces the 1940 standard population that was used by NCHS for over 50 years. The new population standard affects the level of mortality and to some extent trends and group comparisons. Of particular note are the effects on race comparison of mortality. For detailed discussion, see:\n\nAnderson RN, Rosenberg HM. Age standardization of death rates: Implementation of the year 2000 standard. National Vital Statistics Reports; volume 47 number 3. Hyattsville, Maryland. National Center for Health Statistics. 1998.\n\nBeginning with 2003 data, the traditional standard million population along with corresponding standard weights to six decimal places were replaced by the projected year 2000 population age distribution (see 2000 Standard Population below). A forthcoming report will describe the change in more detail. The effect of the change is negligible and does not significantly affect comparability with age-adjusted rates calculated using the previous method.\n\nAge-Adjusted Rates Hints:\n\nAge-Adjusted Rates are optional, see section 1 on the Request Form tab to select age-adjusted rates.\n\nRates are calculated per 100,000 population by default. See Additional Rate Options to select the factor for rate calculations.\n\nSelect the precision for rate calculations in the Other Options section. When the rate calculated for a small numerator (incidence count) is zero, you may increase the precision to reveal the rate by showing more numbers to the right of the decimal point.\n\nAge-adjusted rates cannot be calculated when the data are grouped by Age Group.\n\nAge-adjusted rates are not calculated when only one age group is selected (the effect is a ratio of one).\n\nAge-adjusted rates are not available for \"Infant age groups\" because the populations for these age groups are the number of live births in the given time period, the same population denominator for each infant age group.\n\nThe selection must include both age groups \"5 - 9 years\" and \"10 - 14 years\" in order to calculate age-adjusted rates for this population. The combined age groups are required because the reference standard population has the age group \"5 - 14 years.\"\n\nThe selection must include both age groups \"15 - 20 years\" and \"20 - 24 years\" in order to calculate age-adjusted rates for this population. The combined age groups are required because the reference standard population has the age group \"15 - 24 years.\"\n\nNotes:\n\nAll statistics representing fewer than ten persons (0-9) are suppressed for year 1999 and later years. Sub-national statistics representing fewer than ten persons (0-9) are suppressed for year 1989 and later years. See Assurance of Confidentiality for more information.\n\nRates are marked as \"unreliable\" when the death count is less than 20.\n\nRates are marked as \"not applicable\" when the denominator population figure is unavailable, such as \"not stated\" or unknown age or ethnicity.\n\nDeaths of persons with \"not stated\" or unknown age are not included in the calculation of age-adjusted rates.\n\nIf a \"non-standard\" population is selected for age-adjusted rates, then the actual population estimates for the specified year that are on the Compressed Mortality File are used to determine the specific age-distribution ratios (or weights) used in the calculation.\n\nThe following standard populations (see tables below) are used for computing age-adjusted rates:\n\nyear 2000 Standard Population\n\nyear 2000 Standard Million Population\n\nyear 1970 Standard Million Population\n\nyear 1940Standard Million Population\n\nThe 2000 Standard Population is a projected population, developed before the April 1, 2000 enumerated Census occurred.

The method for confidence intervals calculated for 100 or more deaths differs slightly from the method for confidence intervals calculated for 99 or fewer deaths.\n\nHow? Confidence intervals for rates are requested in \"section 1\" on the Request Form tab. Click the check box to indicate the desired measure.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe method for confidence intervals calculated for 100 or more deaths:\n\nThe lower 95% confidence interval is the crude death rate minus (1.96 times the standard error of the rate). The upper 95% confidence interval is the crude death rate plus (1.96 times the standard error of the rate). LCI = R - 1.96 * S (R)\n\nUCI = R + 1.96 * S (R)\n\nThe method for confidence intervals calculated for 99 or fewer deaths:\n\nThe lower 95% confidence interval is the crude death multiplied by the lower 95% confidence limit factor for a death rate based on a Poisson variable of the number of deaths. The upper 95% confidence interval is the crude death rate multiplied by the upper 95% confidence limit factor for a death rate based on a Poisson variable of the number of deaths. See Vital Statistics of the United States: Mortality, 1999: Technical Appendix Table S. LCI = R * L (0.95, D)\n\nUCI = R * U (0.95, D)\n\nWhere:\n\nLCI = lower 95% confidence interval\n\nUCI = upper 95% confidence interval\n\nR = crude death rate R = (deaths / population) * 100,000\n\nD = the total number of deaths upon which the rate is based.\n\nRSE(R) = relative standard error of rate RSE(R) = 100 * square root of (1/D)\n\nS(R) = standard error of rate S(R) = R * (RSE(R) / 100)\n\nL = the lower 95% confidence limit factor for a death rate based on a Poisson variable of the number of deaths. See Vital Statistics of the United States: Mortality, 1999 Technical Appendix Table S.\n\nU = the upper 95% confidence limit factor for a death rate based on a Poisson variable of the number of deaths.

Click the check box under Measures in section 1 on the Request Form tab.\n\nNotes:\n\nS(R) = standard error of rate S(R) = R * (RSE(R)/100)\n\nWhere:\n\nR = crude death rate R = (deaths / population) * 100,000\n\nD = the total number of deaths upon which the rate is based.\n\nRSE(R) = relative standard error of rate RSE(R) = 100 * square root of (1/D)\n\nFor more information, refer to\n\nAge-adjusted Death Rates: Trend Data Based on the Year 2000 Standard Population\n\nVital Statistics of the United States: Mortality, 1999 Technical Appendix, see the \"Random Variation and Sampling Errors\" section for methods.\n\nPercent of Total\n\nYou can request to show percent of total as an optional statistical measure in \"Step 1.\" This option adds a \"Percent of Total\" column to the results table, and each row shows the percentage that the number of deaths represented in the row contributes to the total number of deaths for that table. This measure is not available when suppression constraints apply to the data in the results table, such as when the deaths are suppressed for any single row in any categorical section in the table.\n\nAdditional Rate Options:\n\nClick the \"+\" to open this section in section 1 on the Request Form tab. The options shown here vary, depending on the Measures you checked in section 1. Organize table layout on the Data Request tab. For example, to pick populations for weighting age-adjusted rates here, you must first check the box for age-adjusted rates in the Measures section.\n\nCalculate Rates Per: Select the factor (multiplier) for your rates. By default, all ages rates are calculated per 100,000 persons, and rates limited to infant age groups are calculated per 1,000 persons.\n\nHow? See \"How do I select items from the list box?\n\nStandard Population: If you picked standard populations for calculating age-adjusted rates, then the list of possible standard populations used to calculate these age-adjusted rates is shown. See Age-Adjusted Rates for more information.\n\nHow? See \"How do I select items from the list box?,\" to limit your data to selected categories in the list.\n\nNote: When using standard populations, your request criteria must include data for the following ranges of ages: \"5 - 14 years\" and \"15 - 24 years.\" Some of the age groups in the standard populations are aggregates of two age groups in the CMF data. When age-adjusted rates are calculated using the standard populations, the CMF deaths and populations counts are summed to match the standard population age groups. For example, the standard populations has a weight for the age group 15-24 years, so the CMF age groups 14-19 and 20-24 must be included in the request for age-adjusted rates (you cannot request age-adjusted rates only for persons 20 years and over).\n\nNon-standard Population: If you picked to use a non-standard population for calculating age-adjusted rates, then the options for selecting the non-standard population are displayed. The non-standard population is derived from the population estimates in the CMF (those used to compute crude rates). You specify the year(s), gender(s), races(s), Hispanic origin(s), and location(s) to be included in the non-standard population. The selected population is the basis for the age-specific proportional weights to calculate these age-adjusted rates. See Frequently Asked Questions about Death Rates for more information.\n\nHow?\n\nSee \"How do I select items from the list box?\n\nType the desired Location code value into the box, one code per line. Or leave the box empty for the entire US (national population). Any Region, division, state or county code shown in the Finder at Step 2 is valid.\n\nNote: If the same population is picked for your query criteria and your non-standard age-adjusted rate calculations, then the crude rates and age-adjusted rates are identical for those data rows that represent the non-standard population denominator.\n\nStep 2. Select location:\n\nData are available for the United States by Region (Census or HHS), Census Division, State, County. Select the location(s) for the query, and the urbanization level, which classifies population density and other factors by county. Data are also available for individual CBSAs (core-based statistical areas) of 250,000 or more population (also referred to as large and medium metropolitan statistical areas). Any number of locations can be specified here.\n\nHow?\n\nClick the button to \"Switch to State/County\" or \"Switch to CBSA\" in the upper left in Section 2 on the Request Form tab.\n\nClick a round button to switch between the lists, such as the State and County list, or the Census Region and Census Division list, or the HHS Region list.\n\nSee How do I use a Finder? for more information.\n\nSee Finder Tool help for more hints.\n\nHints:\n\nThe default is all values (the United States).\n\nThe Advanced mode lets you easily pick several items from different parts of the list. Items are not selected until you click the \"Move\" button in Advanced mode. You may also enter values by hand, one code per line, in the Advanced mode. Use the Finder to see the correct code format. For example, 02 is the Alaska state code.\n\nThe \"plus\" symbol, \"+\" indicates that you can open the item, to see more items below it.\n\nThe results to a search are shown in blue, and indicated by \">\".\n\nRegion\n\nRegions are multi-state groups. For regional data, you can group by Region, or you can select any combination of individual regions. There are two types of regions available, Census Regions and Health and Human Services (HHS) Regions.\n\nHow?\n\nSee Location above for instructions.\n\nSee also Group Results By in Step 1.\n\nNotes:\n\nRegion is based on the person's legal state of residence at the time of death.\n\nThe Regions are identified by both name and codes in data extracts.\n\nCensus Regions\n\nThe United States is split into 4 Census Regions: Northeast, Midwest, South and West.

See About FIPS Codes below.\n\nCounty\n\nCounty-level data are available for the fifty states and the District of Columbia. In this step, you can select any combination of individual counties or leave the Location Finder at the default setting of \"All Counties.\"\n\nHow?\n\nSee Location above for instructions.\n\nSee also Group Results By in Step 1.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe county coded represents the person's place of legal residence at the time of death.\n\nThe counties and the District of Columbia are identified by both county name and Standard Federal Information Processing (FIPS) codes in data extracts.\n\nAbout FIPS Codes: The FIPS State and county codes were established by the National Bureau of Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce in 1968. This standard set of codes provides names and codes for counties and county equivalents of the 50 States of the United States and the District of Columbia. Counties are considered to be the \"first order subdivisions\" of each State, regardless of their local designation (county, parish, borough, census area). Washington, D.C.; the consolidated government of Columbus City, Georgia; the independent cities of the States of Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia; and the census areas and boroughs of Alaska are identified as county equivalents. The system is standard throughout the Federal Government. The State codes are ascending, two-digit numbers; the county codes are ascending three-digit numbers. For both the State and county codes, space has been left for new States or counties. Some changes in the FIPS codes have occurred since 1968. See Locations: About County Geography Changes for information on how these changes affect the Compressed Mortality data.\n\nAbout County Changes: Changes in county geography occur from time to time. Creation and deletion of counties results in missing data for those counties for some years. County boundary changes can result in substantial increases or decreases in the population of the affected counties and hence impact birth and death counts, population estimates, and birth and death rates for those counties. See Locations: About County Geography Changes for information on how county geography changes affect CMF data.\n\nUrbanization and Metro/Nonmetro\n\nUse the radio buttons to select either the 2006 or the 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Scheme for Counties. Select All Categories or any combination of Urbanization values: Large Central Metro, Large Fringe Metro, Medium Metro, Small Metro, Micropolitan (non-metro), NonCore (non-metro). Each county is assigned to one of these six categories. Each death is associated with a category based on the county of the person's legal residence.\n\nThe Metro/Nonmetro list allows you to easily compare metropolitan and rural areas. The Metro group includes counties in these Urbanization categories: Large Central Metro, Large Fringe Metro, Medium Metro, and Small Metro. The Nonmetro group includes counties in these Urbanization categories: Micropolitan (non-metro) and NonCore (non-metro).\n\nHow?\n\nClick the Radio Button above the box, to pick your preferred list.\n\nSee \"How do I select items from the list box?,\" to limit your data to selected categories in the list.\n\nNotes:\n\nThese categories are from the 2006 or 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties.\n\nSee the NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties web page for more information about the Urbanization categories.\n\nThe large central metro category contains counties in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) of one million or more population that have been identified by NCHS classification rules as central because they contain all or part of a principal city of the area. The large fringe metro category contains the remaining counties (similar to suburbs) in MSAs of one million or more. Counties in MSAs of 250,000 to 999,999 population are assigned to the medium metro category and counties in MSAs with populations under 250,000 are assigned to the small metro category. Nonmetropolitan counties that are designated by the Office of Management and Budget as belonging to a micropolitan statistical area are assigned to the micropolitan category and the remaining nonmetropolitan counties are assigned to the noncore category. The large central metro category is the most \"urban\" category and the noncore category is the most \"rural\" category.\n\nTo understand how the classification schemes were developed, see:\n\nNCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties\n\n2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties\n\nMost counties are in the same urbanization category for both the 2013 and 2006 schemes. However, for those counties whose category differs in the two schemes, some moved from a less urban to a more urban category, while others moved from a more urban category to a less urban category. For more information, see \"Changes in county urbanization category: 2013 scheme versus 2006 scheme\" in the report, 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties.\n\nIt is recommended that the micropolitan category not be aggregated with metropolitan categories.\n\nThe Urbanization categories are identified by two columns, labels and codes, in data extracts.\n\nCBSA - Core-Based Statistical Areas\n\nUse the radio buttons to select either the December 2005 or the February 2013 CBSA (core-based statistical areas) list. Select All CBSAs or any combination of values. Data for individual CBSAs with populations of 250,000 or more (large and medium metropolitan statistical areas) are displayed. Data for individual CBSAs with less than 250,000 population are not displayed. Instead data for the smaller CBSAs are aggregated and displayed as: Small metro (metropolitan statistical areas of less than 250,000 population) or Micropolitan (non-metro). Data for counties not in CBSAs are aggregated and displayed as NonCore (non-metro). Each death is assigned based on the county of the decedent's legal residence.\n\nHow?\n\nClick the button to \"Switch to CBSA\" in the upper left in Section 2 on the Request Form tab.\n\nClick the Radio Button above the box, to pick your preferred list.\n\nSee \"How do I select items from the list box?,\" to limit your data to selected categories in the list.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe CBSA delineations are from the December 2005 or February 2013 CBSA lists, as designated by the Office of Management and Budget, based on population data from the Census Bureau.\n\nSee the NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties web page for more information about the related Urbanization categories.\n\nCBSA data are available for Compressed Mortality in years 1999 and later. CBSA data are not available for Compressed Mortality in years 1968-1998.\n\nTo see which Urbanization categories are associated with specific CBSAs, group results by CBSA (all CBSAs) and by Urbanization. Group the 2013 CBSAs with the 2013 Urbanization categories, and the 2005 CBSAs with the 2006 Urbanization categories.\n\nTo see which counties are included in individual CBSAs, group results by CBSA (all CBSAs) and by County. Select only the Large Metro and Medium Metro categories in the associated Urbanization list.\n\nNote that CBSA data cannot be combined with regions, divisions, and states because some CBSAs cross these boundaries. For example, the CBSA for Cincinnati includes counties in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana.\n\nThe CBSA categories are identified by two columns, labels and codes, in data extracts.\n\nStep 3. Select years and demographics:\n\nLimit your data for any of the following data elements:\n\nAge Group - infant age groups are also available.\n\nGender - Female, Male\n\nRace - American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, White.\n\nFor data before Vintage 2006, these 3 categories are available: Black / African American, Other Races Combined, White.\n\nHispanic Origin - Hispanic or Latino, Not Hispanic or Latino, Not Stated;\n\navailable in CMF Vintage 2006 and later releases only.\n\nYear - 1999-200, or 1979-1998, or 1968-1978\n\nchoose between the 2013 or the 2006 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties,\n\navailable in CMF Vintage 2003 and later vintages only.\n\nAge Groups\n\nUse the radio buttons to select either the Age Group list or the Infant Age Groups list. From the selected list you can choose \"All Ages\" or any combination of the individual age groups in the list. \"All Ages\" from the Age Group list is the default.\n\nAge Group list - The following age groups are available from this list: all age groups, under 1 year, 1 - 4 years, 5 - 9 years, 10 - 14 years, 15 - 19 years, 20 - 24 years, 25 - 34 years, 35 - 44 years, 45 - 54 years, 55 - 64 years, 65 - 74 years, 75 - 84 years, 85 years and over, age not stated.\n\nInfant Age Groups list - The following age groups are available from this list: all infant age groups, under 1 day, 1 - 6 days, 7 - 27 days, 28 - 364 days.\n\nHow?\n\nSee \"How do I use a radio button?\", to pick your preferred list of categories.\n\nSee \"How do I select items from the list box?,\" to limit your data to selected categories in the list.\n\nNotes:\n\nWhen an age group(s) is selected from the Infant Age Groups list, the number of live births (not the number of infants in the age category(ies)) is used as the denominator in rate computations. Thus, the denominator used for infant age group rate calculations is the same regardless of how many infant age groups are selected. When a rate is computed for an aggregate of several years, the number of live births for each year in the time period are summed together. For more information about infant age groups, see Mortality for Infants .\n\nFor years 1999-2009: when an age group(s) is selected from the Age Group list, Census Bureau population estimates for each age group are used as the denominator in rate computations. When a rate is computed for an aggregate of several years, the population estimates for each year in the time period are summed together.\n\nFor years 1965-1998: When an age group(s) is selected from the Age Group list, Census Bureau population estimates for each age group are used as the denominator in rate computations, except for the \"under 1 year of age group\". For the \"under 1 year of age\" group, the number of live births is used instead of the population estimate for this age group. When a rate is computed for an aggregate of several years, the population estimates for each year in the time period are summed together.\n\nDeaths with \"Unknown\" or \"Not Stated\" age are included in \"All Ages\" counts and rates, yet are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. See About \"Not Stated\" age or ethnicity for more information.\n\nPrior to August 2006, the number of live births had been substituted for the \"under 1 year\" age group population estimates for years 1999 and later.\n\nSee Age-Adjusted Rates for a discussion on the use of age-groups in calculating age-adjusted rates. Note that some of the age groups available in the data are not available in the standard population tables used to calculate age-adjusted rates. Also, age-adjusted rates are not available for infant age groups.\n\nThe age groups are identified by two columns, labels and codes, in data extracts.\n\nYear\n\nPick any combination of years desired. Data are available for 1999 - 2016 in the Compressed Mortality online database with ICD 10 codes. Data are available for 1979 - 1998 in the Compressed Mortality online database with ICD 9 codes. Data are available for 1968 - 1978 in the Compressed Mortality online database with ICD 8 codes.

See About \"Not Stated\" age or ethnicity for more information.\n\nSee Race Reporting and Race and Ethnicity Questions for more information about the issues of race categories and ethnicity in the data.\n\nThe Hispanic Origin categories are identified by two columns, labels and codes, in data extracts.\n\nStep 4. Select cause of death:\n\nThe cause of death is indicated by the International Classification of Disease (ICD) code in the underlying cause of death section on each death certificate. Use the radio buttons to select one of these 3 lists of causes of death:\n\nThe default selection is the ICD chapters, subchapters, and codes list (ICD-8 Code List for years 1968-1978, ICD-9 Code List for years 1979-1998, ICD-10 Codes list for 1999 and later).\n\nThe Selected Causes of Death or the ICD cause-of-death recode lists are also available (ICD-8 69 groups for years 1968-1978, ICD-9 72 groups for years 1979-1989, and ICD-10 113 groups for 1999 and later).\n\nThe Injury Intent and Mechanism lists are available for year 1999 and later.\n\nHow?\n\nClick the Radio Button above the box, to pick your preferred list.\n\nSelect one or more items from the list to limit your data. The default value for any list is all causes of death.\n\nSee How do use a Finder? to learn more about search options, expanding or collapsing selected items, and displaying details for selected items in the Finder.\n\nThe \"plus\" symbol, \"+\" indicates that you can open the item, to see more items below it.\n\nThe results to a search are shown in blue, and indicated by \">\".\n\nThe Advanced mode let you easily pick several items from different parts of the list. Items are not selected until you click the \"Move\" button in Advanced mode.\n\nYou may also enter values by hand, one code per line, in the Advanced mode. Use the Finder to see the correct code format. For example, \"I20-I25\" is the ICD-10 code for ischaemic heart diseases, and \"GR113-059\" is the Selected Causes of Death ICD-10 Group code for acute myocardial infarction.\n\nSee Finder Tool help for more hints.\n\nHints:\n\nWhen you select a code, note that some deaths are coded to the 3 digit code, and not the more detailed designation. Thus some deaths may be excluded from your data selection if your criteria are limited to only 4 digit codes. For example, the ICD-9 code 412 is the correct specification; 412.0 will not pick up deaths coded 412.\n\nThe causes of death are identified by two columns, labels and codes, in data extracts.\n\nNotes:\n\nAbout the International Classification of Diseases:\n\nThe mortality data on the CMF are compiled in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) regulations, which specify that member nations classify and code causes of death in accordance with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). The International Classification of Diseases is developed collaboratively between WHO and 10 international centers, for purposes of ensuring that medical terms reported on death certificates are internationally comparable and lend themselves to statistical analysis. The ICD has been revised approximately every 10 years since 1900 in order to reflect changes in understanding of disease mechanisms and in disease terminology.\n\nAbout the 9th and 10th ICD revisions:\n\nThe ICD-9 and ICD-10 classification systems are quite different. The ICD-9 system has a 4-digit numeric structure and about 5,000 categories for classifying cause-of-death. The ICD-10 system has a 4-digit alphanumeric coding structure and about 8,000 categories for classifying cause-of-death. Comparison of ICD-9 and ICD-10 shows that new chapters have been added to the ICD, old chapters have been rearranged, causes of death have been regrouped, and titles have changed. The differences between ICD-9 and ICD-10 make direct comparisons of cause-of-death difficult and result in discontinuities in cause-of-death trends. NCHS has conducted a comparability study to measure the discontinuities between the Ninth and Tenth Revisions and comparability ratios for major causes of death have been computed. Based on this work, comparability ratios have been calculated for selected causes. For further information please reference NCHS publications on Comparability of Cause-of-Death Between ICD Revisions.\n\nFor information on comparability of mortality causes between ICDA-8 and ICD-9, please see Estimates of Selected Comparability Ratios Based on Dual Coding of 1976 Death Certificates by the Eighth and Ninth Revisions of the International Classification of Diseases.\n\nSee also ICD 10th revision notes, ICD 9th revision notes, and ICD 8th revision notes.\n\nOnly those ICD codes that are used to classify causes of death in the National Vital Statistics System data are available in the Finder.\n\nDeaths in the years 1999 and later are coded to the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). There are 113 selected causes of death groups for the ICD-10 codes.\n\nDeaths in the years 1979 - 1998 are coded to the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Disease (ICD-9). There are 72 selected causes of death groups for the ICD-9 codes.\n\nDeaths in the years 1968 - 1978 are coded to the Eighth revision of the International Classification of Disease Adapted for Use in the United States (ICDA-8). There are 69 selected causes of death groups for the ICD-8 codes.\n\nICD-10 Codes\n\nLimit the data to any number of causes of death, for selected chapters, sub-chapters or codes.\n\nHow? See Step 4. Select cause of death above. Check the Hints section.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe International Classification of Disease (ICD) 10th revision is used to represent the underlying cause of death for the years 1999 and later. The ICD system is organized by chapters, sub-chapters and codes.\n\nICD-10 uses a 4 digit alphanumeric coding scheme. Each of the 21 chapters in ICD-10 is classified to a letter or letters of the alphabet. Infectious disease codes in Chapter 1, for example, begin with an \"A\" or \"B\". Thus, Acute poliomyelitis is associated with the codes A80.0-A80.9 and Viral hepatitis is classified as B15.0-B19.9. Most cause of death codes in the ICD-10 system have 4-digits and consist of a letter, followed by two numbers, followed by a decimal point and another number. Some codes have only 3-digits and consist of a letter followed by two numbers.\n\nAbout changes in the ICD-10 codes:\n\nThe valid ICD-10 codes used to classify underlying cause of death change over time. Effective with the 2003 data year, 1 code was introduced. Effective with the 2006 data year, 18 codes were introduced as valid causes of death, and 4 codes were discontinued. Effective with the 2007 data year, 4 codes were introduced as valid causes of death, and 2 codes were discontinued. Effective with the 2009 data year, 5 codes were introduced as valid causes of death, and 11 codes were discontinued. Effective with the 2011 data year, 33 codes were introduced as valid causes of death.\n\nICD-10 Changes in Years 2003-2011 New causes of death in 2011 ICD-10 Code Title B17.9 Acute viral hepatitis, unspecified D68.5 Primary thrombophilia D68.6 Other thrombophilia D89.3 Immune reconstitution syndrome E88.3 Tumor lysis syndrome G14 Postpolio syndrome G21.4 Vascular parkinsonism H54.9 Unspecified visual impairment (binocular) I72.5 Aneurysm and dissection of other precerebral arteries J12.3 Human metapneumovirus pneumonia J21.1 Acute bronchiolitis due to human metapneumovirus K12.3 Oral mucositis (ulcerative) K35.2 Acute appendicitis with generalized peritonitis K35.3 Acute appendicitis with localized peritonitis K35.8 Acute appendicitis, other and unspecified L89.0 Stage I decubitus ulcer and pressure area L89.1 Stage II decubitus ulcer L89.2 Stage III decubitus ulcer L89.3 Stage IV decubitus ulcer L89.9 Decubitus ulcer and pressure area, unspecified N18.1 Chronic kidney disease, stage 1 N18.2 Chronic kidney disease, stage 2 N18.3 Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 N18.4 Chronic kidney disease, stage 4 N18.5 Chronic kidney disease, stage 5 N42.3 Dysplasia of prostate O14.2 HELLP syndrome O43.2 Morbidly adherent placenta O96.0 Death from direct obstetric cause occurring more than 42 days but less than one year after delivery O96.1 Death from indirect obstetric cause occurring more than 42 days but less than one year after delivery O96.9 Death from unspecified obstetric cause occurring more than 42 days but less than one year after delivery O97.0 Death from sequelae of direct obstetric cause O97.1 Death from sequelae of indirect obstetric cause O97.9 Death from sequelae of obstetric cause, unspecified O98.7 Human immunodeficiency [HIV] disease complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium X34.0 Victim of cataclysmic earth movements caused by earthquake X34.1 Victim of tsunami X34.8 Victim of other specified effects of earthquake X34.9 Victim of unspecified effect of earthquake New causes of death in 2009 ICD-10 Code Title A09.0 Other and unspecified gastroenteritis and colitis of infectious origin A09.9 Gastroenteritis and colitis of unspecified origin K52.3 Indeterminate colitis R26.3 Immobility R63.6 Insufficient intake of food and water due to self neglect New causes of death in 2007 ICD-10 Code Title J09 Influenza due to identified avian influenza virus U04.9 Severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], unspecified X59.0 Exposure to unspecified factor causing fracture X59.9 Exposure to unspecified factor causing other and unspecified injury New causes of death in 2006 ICD-10 Code Title B33.4 Hantavirus (cardio)-pulmonary syndrome [HPS][HCPS] G90.4 Autonomic dysreflexia I15.0 Renovascular hypertension I15.9 Secondary hypertension, unspecified K22.7 Barrett's esophagus K85.0 Idiopathic acute pancreatitis K85.1 Biliary acute pancreatitis K85.2 Alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis K85.3 Drug-induced acute pancreatitis K85.8 Other acute pancreatitis K85.9 Acute pancreatitis, unspecified M31.7 Microscopic polyangiitis M79.7 Fibromyalgia P91.6 Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy of newborn R29.6 Tendency to fall, not elsewhere classified R50.2 Drug-induced fever R50.8 Other specified fever W46 Contact with hypodermic needle New causes of death in 2003 ICD-10 Code Title I27.2 Other secondary pulmonary hypertension\n\nDiscontinued causes of death in 2009 ICD-10 Code Title A09 Diarrhea and gastroenteritis of infectious origin F11.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of opioids, acute intoxication F12.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of cannabinoids, acute intoxication F13.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of sedatives or hypnotics, acute intoxication F14.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of cocaine, acute intoxication F15.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of other stimulants, including caffeine, acute intoxication F16.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of hallucinogens, acute intoxication F17.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of tobacco, acute intoxication F18.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of volatile solvents, acute intoxication F19.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to multiple drug use and use of other psychoactive substances, acute intoxication K51.1 Ulcerative (chronic) ileocolitis\n\nDiscontinued causes of death in 2007 ICD-10 Code Title F10.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol, acute intoxication X59 Exposure to unspecified factor\n\nDiscontinued causes of death in 2006 ICD-10 Code Title I25.2 Old myocardial infarction K85 Acute pancreatitis R50.0 Fever with chills R50.1 Persistent fever\n\nAbout deaths due to acts of terrorism:\n\nBeginning with data for 2001, NCHS introduced categories *U01-*U03 for classifying and coding deaths due to acts of terrorism. The asterisks before the category codes indicate that they are not part of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Description of the specific 4-digit codes can be found at NCHS Classifications of Diseases, Functioning and Disability: Appendix I. Deaths classified to the terrorism categories are included in the categories for Assault (homicide) and Intentional self-harm (suicide) in the 113 cause-of-death list. Additional information on these new categories can be found at NCHS Classifications of Diseases, Functioning and Disability: Classification of Death and Injury Resulting from Terrorism. Terrorism related deaths in this data do not represent a final count of deaths resulting from the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, as this figure had not been determined. As of October 24, 2002, death certificates were issued for 2,957 of the estimated 3,028 individuals believed to have died as a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Of these, four were issued for terrorists and are classified as suicides. The criteria for issuing a death certificate for those believed to have died in the attacks differed by state, reflecting differences in state laws regarding death certification. Pennsylvania issued a death certificate for every individual, including the terrorists. Death certificates were not issued for any of the terrorists in Virginia or New York City. Virginia issued a death certificate only for those victims whose remains were identified. New York City issued a death certificate for those whose remains were identified or, if remains were not recovered, for those whose families applied for a death certificate. For more detailed information regarding New York City's processing of these deaths, see Deaths in World Trade Center Terrorist Attacks---New York City, 2001.\n\nAbout deaths due to pulmonary hypertension:\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) added code I27.2 in 2003. Prior to 2003, if the certifier listed \"secondary pulmonary hypertension\" the condition would be coded I27.0 because there was no code for secondary pulmonary hypertension. After code I27.2 was added in 2003, the number of deaths coded to I27.0 dropped significantly.\n\nICD-9 Codes\n\nLimit the data to any number of causes of death, for selected chapters, sub-chapters or codes.\n\nHow? See Step 4. Select cause of death above.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe International Classification of Disease (ICD) 9th revision is used to represent the underlying cause of death for the years 1979 - 1998. The ICD system is organized by chapters, sub-chapters and codes. For a further description of the ICD-9 codes see Volume II of the annual mortality volumes produced by the NCHS, such as Vital Statistics of the United States, 1988, Volume II - Mortality.\n\nAbout Deaths due to Injuries and Poisoning in ICD-9:\n\nFor deaths due to injuries and poisonings that occurred during 1979-1998, the external cause is coded (E800-E999) rather than the Nature of Injury (800-999). The letter \"E\" is included in the ICD-9 code in CDC WONDER.\n\nMost cause of death codes in the ICD-9 system have 4-digits and consist of three numbers, followed by a decimal point and another number. Some codes have only 3-digits and consist of three numbers.\n\nICDA-8 Codes\n\nLimit the data to any number of causes of death, for selected chapters, sub-chapters or codes.\n\nHow? See Step 4. Select cause of death above.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe International Classification of Disease Adapted for Use in the United States 8th Revision (ICDA-8) is used to represent the underlying cause of death for the years 1968 - 1978. The ICDA-8 system is organized by chapters, sub-chapters and codes. For a further description of the ICD-8 codes see Volume II of the annual mortality volumes produced by the NCHS, such as Vital Statistics of the United States, 1978, Volume II-Mortality.\n\nFor information on comparability of mortality causes between ICDA-8 and ICD-9, please see Estimates of Selected Comparability Ratios Based on Dual Coding of 1976 Death Certificates by the Eighth and Ninth Revisions of the International Classification of Diseases.\n\nAbout Deaths due to Injuries and Poisoning in ICDA-8:\n\nFor deaths due to injuries and poisonings that occurred during 1968-1978, the external cause is coded (E800-E999) rather than the Nature of Injury (800-999). The letter \"E\" is included in the ICD-8 code in CDC WONDER.\n\nMost cause of death codes in the ICDA-8 system have 4-digits and consist of three numbers, followed by a decimal point and another number. Some codes have only 3-digits and consist of three numbers.\n\nICD-10 113 Groups\n\nLimit the data to any number of groups of selected causes of death.\n\nHow? See Step 4. Select cause of death above.\n\nHint: Group the data by \"ICD-10 113 Groups\" and also by \"Cause of Death\" to see the individual ICD codes included in each category.\n\nNotes:\n\nNCHS developed the mortality tabulation lists for use in mortality analyses. The 113 selected causes of death list was designed to: 1) maintain continuity with the ICD-9 72 selected causes of death list, 2) to facilitate trend analysis, and 3) to separately identify causes of death that are of public health and medical importance.\n\nNote that the ICD-10 113 groups have been adapted for the Injury Mechanisms categories. Some groups have been combined to make for inclusive categories, such as Motor Vehicle Traffic, Heart Disease and Tuberculosis. You may find it easier to select these broader categories of causes of death from the list under Injury Mechanism & All Other Leading Causes.\n\nChanges in the 113 selected causes of death list associated with updates to the ICD-10 codes are discussed in the Technical Notes of each annual report (1-14); additional detail is available from: http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/icd10updates/en/index.html.\n\nICD-9 72 Groups\n\nLimit the data to any number of groups of selected causes of death.\n\nHow? See Step 4. Select cause of death above.\n\nHint: Group the data by \"ICD-9 72 Groups\" and also by \"Cause of Death\" to see the individual ICD codes included in each category.\n\nNote: NCHS developed the mortality tabulation lists for use in mortality analyses. The 72 selected causes of death list was designed to: 1) maintain continuity with the ICD-9 69 selected causes of death list, 2) to facilitate trend analysis, and 3) to separately identify causes of death that are of public health and medical importance.\n\nICDA-8 69 Groups\n\nLimit the data to any number of groups of selected causes of death.\n\nHow? See Step 4. Select cause of death above.\n\nHint: Group the data by \"ICD-8 69 Groups\" and also by \"Cause of Death\" to see the individual ICD codes included in each category.\n\nNote: NCHS developed the mortality tabulation lists for use in mortality analyses. The 69 selected causes of death list was designed to: 1) to facilitate trend analysis, and 2) to separately identify causes of death that are of public health and medical importance.\n\nInjury Intent and Mechanism\n\nLimit your data for any of the following data elements:\n\nInjury Intent\n\nInjury Mechanism & All Other Leading Causes\n\nAbout the External Cause of Injury Mortality Matrix:\n\nFor the analysis of injury mortality data, all causes of death have been classified by intent and by mechanism. The causes of death that are not related to injuries have been categorized as non-injuries, and are categorized in keeping with the 113 selected causes of death groups for ICD-10. The groups of injury mechanisms are different from those based on the \"113 Selected Causes of Death\" for ICD-10 codes. The groupings are based on the External Cause of Injury Mortality Matrix. In addition, some non-injury groups have been combined to make for broader categories, such as Heart Disease and Tuberculosis.\n\nFor more information, see: External Cause of Injury Mortality Matrix.\n\nNote: Injury intent and Mechanism categories are not available for the ICD-8 codes in years 1968-1978.\n\nStep 5.

See \"How do I select items from the list box?,\" to limit your data to selected categories in the list.\n\nData Source Information\n\nMortality Data Sources: The Compressed Mortality File is produced by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Office of Analysis and Epidemiology (OAE) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Mortality information is collected by state registries and provided to the National Vital Statistics System. Underlying cause of death and demographic descriptors are indicated on the death certificates.\n\nTo learn more about the methods and source of these data please reference:\n\nNational Center for Health Statistics: (NCHS) Compressed Mortality web site\n\nNational Vital Statistics System: Mortality web site\n\nSee also Data Source Citations\n\nPopulation Denominator Data Sources: The population estimates on the CMF are based on Bureau of the Census estimates of total U.S., State, and county resident populations. The 1968 and 1969 State and county population estimates were calculated by NCHS using linear extrapolation. The 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 population estimates are April 1 modified census counts. The estimates for 1971-79, 1981-89, 1991-99, and 2001-2009 are intercensal estimates of July 1 resident populations. The national population estimates for 2011 are Vintage 2011 postcensal estimates of July 1 resident populations. The national population estimates for 2012 are Vintage 2012 postcensal estimates of July 1 resident populations. The national population estimates for 2013 are Vintage 2013 postcensal estimates of July 1 resident populations. The national population estimates for 2014 are Vintage 2014 postcensal estimates of July 1 resident populations. The national population estimates for 2015 are Vintage 2015 postcensal estimates of July 1 resident populations. The national population estimates for 2016 are Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates of July 1 resident populations. The region, state and county estimates for years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 are Vintage 2016 postcensal estimates of July 1 resident populations. Note that the estimates for 1991 and later are based on bridged-race categories. The population estimates on the CMF are by geographic unit (total United States, State, and county), year, race (white, black, other races), sex, and age group (13 age groups). To permit the calculation of infant mortality rates, NCHS live-birth data are included on the file.\n\nFor more information on the population estimates, see Compressed Mortality File: Population Data.\n\nPopulation Estimates on the Compressed Mortality File\n\nReference the following topics to learn more about population denominators for rate calculation:\n\nPopulation Information for the Current Release\n\n1968-1969 Population Estimates\n\n1970 Population Estimates\n\n1971-1979 Population Estimates\n\n1980 Population Estimates\n\n1981- 1989 Population Estimates\n\n1990 Population Estimates\n\n1991-1999 Population Estimates\n\n2000 Population Estimates\n\n2001- 2009 Population Estimates\n\n2010 Population Estimates\n\n2011 Population Estimates\n\n2012 Population Estimates\n\n2013 Population Estimates\n\n2014 Population Estimates\n\n2015 Population Estimates\n\n2016 Population Estimates\n\nAbout Population Migration due to Hurricanes in 2005\n\nCompressed Mortality File Archives: About the 1990-based Postcensal Population Data\n\nIf you have additional questions about the population estimates, please see U.S. Census Populations With Bridged Race Categories (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race.htm) or contact PopEst@cdc.gov.\n\nPopulation Information for the Current Release\n\nThe population data on the CMF are derived from U.S. Census Bureau files. The population estimates for the Census years: 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 are April 1, modified census counts. The population estimates for the non-Census years: 1968-69, 1971-79, 1981-89, 1991-99, and 2001-2009 are intercensal estimates of the July 1, resident population. The population estimates for 2011-2016 are postcensal estimates of the July 1, resident population.\n\nPopulation estimates for year 1999 and later years are from the bridged-race population series, with estimates for four single-race categories (white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander). For more information, see About Bridged-race Population Estimates.\n\nThe following modifications of the Census population estimates were made by NCHS for CMF:\n\nTo permit the calculation of infant mortality rates, NCHS live-birth data are included for \"Infant age Groups.\" The race code for these records is derived from the race of mother.\n\nWhen the age group 1-4 years did not appear on the Census file, the age group 0-4 years was multiplied by 0.8 to obtain an estimate of the population 1-4 years.\n\nFor the years 1988 through 1991, there was an additional county in Georgia with a \"missing\" county code of \"999\". This county was assigned a population count of zero.\n\nGeographic changes that create new counties or delete old counties often are implemented in the population files before they are implemented in the mortality files. As a result, county FIPS codes for some counties on the Census population files have been modified so that the FIPS codes on the CMF population and mortality file match. For more information, see County Geography Changes.\n\nSpecific Details\n\n1968-1969 Population Estimates\n\nNational population estimates are U.S. Bureau of the Census intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population. State and county population estimates were calculated by NCHS using linear extrapolation from the corresponding July 1, 1970 and July 1, 1971 estimates.
