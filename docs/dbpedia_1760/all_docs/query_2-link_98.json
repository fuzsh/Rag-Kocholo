The wedding was held on the Platform, the reception was held in the Station House and our accommodations were cabooses. On January 29th, my oldest granddaughter Shelby Laws was married to Travis Hempel of Victoria. They were married at Beneath the Oaks in Midfield, TX (Bay City area). Shelby is a chemical engineer and a graduate of Georgia Tech with highest honors. Travis is a mechanical engineer. Both are employed by Dow in Seadrift.

She will be teaching in the fall.”\n\nBob Beeley ’56 shares, “At age 84 I have been blessed with good health, a wonderful family, and too much knowledge to keep to myself.

Kinkaid is tearing down the last of the \"new school\", our high school. In 1957, we walked down the airconditioned (!) single aisle to Senior Corner, where we could smoke(!!), past shiny new lockers to begin as seniors. We lost Dorothy to Lamar but gained Kendall Robinson Dighton and Sue Shaffer Peters. Some events I remember...The newspaper had a Mr. and Miss Falcon contest to sell 5c. papers and the first crowned were Linda Lester Griffin and Frank Foshee, followed by Virginia Joy and John Elias. Alas, those romances didn’t make it past high school. Parker Swanson was the Lord High Admiral in our G&S production. Who knew he could sing? Did he get to kiss Sally Eastham Chapoton? John Webb won the ceremonial stick horse as Top Hand in our first Rodeo Day and our football team LOST to St. John’s. I’ve never forgiven QB Jim Parks, Eddie Gumbert, or cousin Will Lee Kay Christie, gallop back into our lives, and Jimmy Janse, we’re all on the Back Nine so tee up with us. Joe Rollo, surface. Jody Ruhl must be as busy as ever. And Bob Everett, we were prom dates!\n\n1959\n\nJohn David Hagerman 24800 I-45, Suite 100 The Woodlands, TX 77386 johndhagerman@hotmail.com\n\nThe ’59 class lunch bunch is still meeting from time to time after a Covid pause; and if you want information as to getting on the email lunch notice list, contact Glenn Seureau at Star Motor Cars at 713-868-6800 or John David Hagerman at 713-248-5801.\n\n1960\n\nSassy English Stanton 1404 Potomac Houston, Texas 77057 713-266-9919 sassy@stanton-pinckard.com\n\nAllan Port Houston, Texas allan.port@att.net\n\n1962\n\nAdrian Turner Ross Houston, Texas adrian@rexross.com\n\nDear 1962 Classmates,\n\nWay back in April 2022, a small but delightful group of us celebrated our 60th Reunion. There was a chilly, but fun barbecue at the Kinkaid campus on Friday evening, and on Saturday we gathered at the home of Rex and Adrian Turner Ross Barry Rose came from Montana. Tony Kupersmith and wife Beecie came from Virginia, and Sandra Provost and husband Bob came from Arizona. The local folks who joined us were Gibson Carothers, George Schudy and wife Judy, Tony Walsh Duperier, Randi Fay Yocum, Carolyn Ferguson Means, Jean Merritt Johnston, Sam Harrison, Chip Stanberry and wife Janet, and Richard Domercq and wife Patrice. Susan Cooper Gaudet and Tim Havens weighed in via Zoom. To those of you who could not join us, you were missed. A good time was had by all. On a sad note, Kathy Freeman Steigerwald passed away recently. If you happen to know of any other classmates that we have lost in the past several years, please let me know and I will note it in the next newsletter.\n\nHappy 2023 to everyone, Adrian Turner Ross\n\n1963\n\nNeed Volunteer\n\n1964\n\nClaire Andreae Murray Silver Spring, Maryland claire.murray@verizon.net\n\nWelcome to the age of blossoming infection, as lo and behold we are now being blessed by Flu, RSV, colds and old friends like a myriad of Covid variants. Neglected we are not by varmints of multiple varieties. Hopefully one and all have either escaped or have fully recovered from the more purulent villains afloat in our environs.\n\nI have heard via the grapevine that some of our classmates have resumed travel, retired, moved into senior communities and have made forays into personal reunions with old friends. As the times “they are a changing” such that it is difficult to stay up with all the challenges presented today.\n\nEd Greacen in sharing, punctuates the dilemmas of our current times ranging from social media overriding parental input to weather change and other environmental consequences evolving over the generations. Despite continued turmoil, both domestic and international, which seems inevitable he extols us all to, “Enjoy today! Encourage future generations!”\n\nIf anyone was to take that message to heart it would be Bonnie Brigance Leadbetter and family who have been expanding their horizons from the sparkling waters off the Amalfi Coast to Paris and the Eiffel Tower.\n\nBelieve it or not Bonnie’s husband Gary even ventured into paragliding from 10,000 feet. Bonnie confessed, “Still too scary for me—I did it off the coast in California last year, but 400 ft up is way better than 10,000! My tale should have been more entertaining—such as when the nav in Switzerland told us to turn into a field or when we went to return equipment to the ski rental shop the day we left Zermatt and found it was closed or when the boys got stuck on the mountain because the lift closed early and they had to be rescued by a snow groomer, or that the rental cars were so small for 5 people that we had to travel everywhere with suitcases on our laps and under our feet.” Ahh, such are the unforeseen travails of the adventurous.\n\nAs for myself, Claire Andreae Murray, I cannot believe how arduous it is to release to the universe a lifetime of memorabilia that strains the little gray cells to recall from whence it actually came. Not to mention the voluminous treasures passed down from four previous generations residing in every crawl space and storage unit about the eastern seaboard…add to that monumental task is dissolving both our practices and offices replete with 35 years of files, books and psych paraphernalia. I now know how hoarding apparently begins with but a single box placed in an attic instead of the Salvation Army.\n\nHere’s hoping that all your sweet memories are at your disposal and that you continue to build new ones with your loved ones. If you have an urge for pay back leave your mountain of goodies for them to sort through...LOL\n\n1965\n\nTami Fox Brau Austin, Texas tazmazan@gmail.com\n\nBarbara Moses Robertson reports, “Corby and I have two grandchildren that are SENIORS this year at Kinkaid: Hope Morenz ’23, daughter of Shea and Christine Morenz ’92, and Hunter Robertson ’23, son of Brooke and Corby Robertson III.\n\nHunter was the quarterback of 2022 Varsity Football team. Kinkaid won the 2022 SPC Championship against Episcopal! Jake Robertson ’27 is in 8th Grade, Keen Robertson ’28 and Shea Morenz ’28 are in 7th Grade, and Kaki Robertson is in 4th Grade. All are at Kinkaid. GO FALCONS!\n\nOur two oldest granddaughters, Lillie Morenz ’21 and Bradyn Robertson ’21 are sophomores at The University of Texas. Lillie is a member of Pi Beta Phi Sorority and in The School of Nursing. Bradyn is a member of Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority and in PLAN II. HOOK EM HORNS!\n\nJay Jorns writes “I moved to a new apartment for active seniors in Seabrook. I have a view of Clear Lake remembering the many water skiing adventures on Clear Lake during my youth.” Jay reports his birthday bash was a great success.\n\nPat Kidson Fogle Cavanagh Houston, Texas plkfc@hotmail.com\n\nFriends,\n\nI’m writing this message in December just after attending Kinkaid’s Alumni Holiday Party. I love that event because I see friends from other classes as well as parents of former students and, big bonus, many former students. Our class was represented by Elizabeth and Jim Tang, Linda and Rod Crowl, and me. I wish more of you would make time for this next year. The food is fabulous, thanks to Chef Mark Harris and his team, the wine is top-shelf, and most of all, the blessings of longtime friendships top the evening.\n\nIt was wonderful to hear from Gibb Bauer who loves living in Alpine, TX!\n\nThis from Bubba Koenig: I hope this finds you and all our classmates safe and healthy. Well, after almost 3 years Linda and I finally were able to take a cruise. We flew to Naples to catch the ship; made three stops in Croatia at Split, Hvar and Dubrovnik; on to Bari Italy, Corfu, Greece, Taormina and Palermo in Sicily, Naples, and then flew home from Rome. Highlights were Dubrovnik (we’re big Game of Thrones fans and Dubrovnik was the location for King’s Landing in the GOT series) and Naples for a full tour of Pompeii. The cruise was great, but the trip over and back was a nightmare. The logistics of international travel were awful. All-in-all, not a great travel experience but worth it to see everything we saw. Still hoping to make Israel in 2023. Hope everybody is safe and healthy and enjoying our \"Golden Years.\"\n\nDavid Boldrick writes that he has had a good year, working some, building refrigerated places, working on his old sailboat, volunteering with Meals on Wheels, and having fun with a 12-week-old puppy.\n\nRob Wilson is proud that three generations of Wilsons won SPC football championships their senior years - Rob in 1966, his son Carson ’98 in 1997, and grandson, Cade Brown ’22, son of Doak ’92 and Jennifer Wilson Brown ’92, in 2021.\n\nJim Tang has been enjoying retirement for the past two years. His great joy has been keeping busy as a grandfather of two. His oldest granddaughter, Kelly, is three and half, and a photo of Jim holding her was selected to be on the cover of the Royal Oaks Community Magazine for December 2022.\n\nGrandson Rayan Tenzing Tang, son of\n\nDr. Jeffrey Tang ’05 and wife\n\nDr. Mehwish Ismaily, is eight months old. They are expecting a daughter in April 2023. Jim and wife Elizabeth enjoyed a very pleasant vacation in October to Vermont and New Hampshire to see the spectacular fall colors.\n\nJohn Diffy and Martha have enjoyed being with their kids in their locations (CO and U.K.) and all together in Steamboat Springs for the holidays. Their getaways in the Virginia mountains and on the South Carolina coast have been refreshing. They continue to be fortunate in having opportunities for purposeful volunteer work through their church’s food ministry, their local (PA) symphony and history center, and their Virginia chamber music center. Looking ahead, a concert tour in Portugal, and holidays in England and/or Greece, look likely in 2023. John’s message to all: “Best wishes, fellow Falcons, for a healthy and happy 2023.”\n\nTua Smith Burke’s mother passed away in April, and her older brother passed away in August. Those are two huge losses in one year. But joyfully, she enjoyed another granddaughter’s wedding in Lincoln, NE where she met her great-grandson for the first time. That makes eight grands and one great-grand for Tua!\n\nAs for me, a twice-delayed-becauseof COVID Chapelwood UMC Chancel Choir tour of Croatia, Slovenia, and Italy (Venice) was finally completed in October. We had concerts in four beautiful churches with large audiences in attendance. Unlike Bubba’s, our experience was mostly positive with one exception - due to a medical emergency on our flight home from Frankfort, we made an unscheduled stop in Iceland where we were on the ground for two hours. Since we couldn’t deplane, there was only one thing to do - shop on Amazon! Two grandsons will graduate from high school this year. No college choices yet. I continue work in my home with students, most of whom are dyslexic, to stay connected to Kinkaid through PK and Kindergarten Admissions testing in the fall, to ring handbells and sing in the Chancel Choir at Chapelwood UMC, and to spend as much time as I can with my very busy children and grandchildren. I am telling the universe that a trip to Africa in 2024 is on my mind. If any of you have been, please share your insights.\n\nLove and blessings to everyone who reads this news. Stay healthy and happy in 2023!\n\n1967\n\nNeed Volunteer\n\nBuddy Trotter reports he and wife Jeanie ventured to Portugal in early November, visiting Lisbon, Coimbra, and Porto, along with other towns. They were enchanted with the architecture, cleanliness, and friendliness of the folks there. After retirement, Buddy and Jeanie have developed a new career performing songs for residents of senior living facilities in the Katy, TX area. \"There’s been quite a demand, actually, for our performances, and the residents seem to love what we do\" Buddy says... \"They ask us back, so that’s a good thing!\"\n\n1968\n\nAnnie Owen Houston, Texas anniedowen@me.com\n\nElizabeth Topper Nash San Marcos, Texas enash@grandecom.net\n\nThe Class of 1968 is sad to share the loss of beloved friend Carl Moody earlier this year. We extend our sympathy to Carl’s family, friends and loved ones. In May 2021, he wrote the letter below to the class correspondents.\n\nFrom Carl, “Rhonda and I retired to our family home in a lovely neighborhood near Independence Hall in Philadelphia in 2016. Auspiciously, we apparently brought our Texas Mojo, or perhaps it was the leadership of Austin’s Westlake High’s alumnus Nick Foles’ leadership that led to the Eagles going on to win the Super Bowl that season! I’m sure that goody will warm the hearts of many who read this. Lest I sound cocky, I might also note the Eagle’s subsequent return to their accustomed record.\n\nWe had been preparing our home in Philadelphia for a decade and after spending frequent long weekends here, Rhonda went from saying she didn’t think those Yankees would like her to finding more friends than you can shake a stick at and encouraging me to pull the trigger so we could live here full time. Next to paying attention to God, marrying Rhonda, and having our family, it was the happiest decision I ever made. I wake up every morning so grateful to be here!\n\nWe are having a ball with friends and family. Lots to see, do, and enjoy here. Easy access to New York, the beach, mountains. Our neighborhood is filled with history, culture, restaurants, and adventure. Easy access to golf and lots of friends to play. Beautiful walks. 15 minutes to the airport. I’m like a salmon who has swum upstream to his birthplace...but hopefully to a more promising outcome.\n\nOur youngest daughter and her husband gave birth to our youngest grandson in April 2020 and left their high-rise apartment in Boston to shelter in place with us in Philadelphia for eight weeks, arriving when our cherry trees were in full bloom and our neighborhood was filled with tulips.\n\nLast Summer, we came to Texas for our youngest son’s wedding. We spent Thanksgiving in Scituate, MA with our oldest daughter and her family. This winter our youngest daughter and son-in-law sent us tickets to join them and little Xavi in Aruba where they were wintering. Our Granddaughter (22) in Louisiana graduated from LSU and her brother is graduating high school and has providentially accepted a scholarship to study nuclear science 30 minutes away from us at Penn State, Brandywine!\n\nRhonda and I have backpacked the 480-mile Camino de Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage across Northern Spain two more times and the 450-mile Chemin de St. Jacques/ GR65 pilgrimage from Le Puy en Velay to St. Jean Pied de Port in the Pyrenees once with side trips to Lourdes and Fatima. Knocked around with our daughter and son-in-law who lived in Madrid, and had some lovely times in Paris, Porto, Lisbon, Avila, and Toledo.\n\nBefore COVID shut down my club, I was swimming a mile once or twice a week. I swam a 10K just before the pandemic struck. Actually, I swam 404 lengths of a 25-meter pool...adding a 100-meter sprint at the end of the 10K to prove I was quitting out of boredom, not exhaustion. I don’t plan on doing that again. Too much chlorine!\n\nIn April, our five kids, their spouses, and nine grandchildren surprised us by showing up at our son’s home in Wylie, TX for a surprise family reunion! First time we have all been together in over ten years. Blessed, humbled, and grateful. We returned home to once again enjoy the cherry blossoms and tulips.\n\nA friend who is an accomplished Blacksmith in East Texas wrote me saying he had just turned 71 and was waiting for the other shoe to drop. I told him that turning 71 is like putting on a flip flop, so I look forward to the other flip flop falling so I can slip it on and go to the beach. As I told another friend over lunch at the Fort Worth\n\nClub who was complaining about being practically run over while going 80 MPH on the Sam Houston Toll Road, 80 is the new 60. That is my wish for you.\n\nNot sure how all this came together. I certainly had no idea. Thought I would have to work until 85. Looking back, I see the hand of providence. It has always helped to look up. I am grateful for you and our other dear Kinkaid classmates for so many fond memories and for enduring friendships!”\n\n1969\n\nBonnie German Chandler Harvard, Massachusetts bchandler1@charter.net\n\nThe Class of ’69 is still going strong. Marcy West, who has more energy than any ten other people, has started a farm-to-table business of raising grass-fed, grass-finished beef. She and daughter Kelley now have a USDA-approved slaughter plant for their beef. “So far, we are selling out of her veterinary clinic on Westheimer and developing a clientele by participating in farmer’s markets in the Houston area. We additionally sell organic free-range eggs, and are exploring selling the organically raised broilers that we are presently using for our own consumption. Since the peach crop last spring was amazingly abundant, I learned how to make jellies, jams, and preserves from our peaches, figs, grapes, and pears. We are on schedule to have 18 calves this year, with a total of 14 steers already in the slaughter pipeline. We butchered our own farm raised turkeys for Easter and Thanksgiving, and plan on another two for Christmas. I got a little too happy using the new incubator that Kelley got me last spring. Do you know anyone who wants ducks? Lots and lots of ducks?” Marcy is also breeding and showing her Kangal dogs and Australian shepherds. She is “still trying to avoid knee surgery, still working two or three full time jobs [including husband David’s tire business], still riding herd on three grandkids, although on weekends, I swear, the number of children at the farm grows exponentially.”\n\nI was holding my breath for Judy Neun as Hurricane Ian approached Florida this fall, but she survived intact. She thanks all her friends who reached out to check on her at ground zero during the storm. “All is good now in paradise. The beaches are opening after two months, but only for walking! No swimming allowed yet.” She explained that there is a lot of pollution and many dangerous pieces of various materials hidden in the sands and under the water. Since her new house is two miles from the beach in Naples, the storm surge didn’t reach them. “We were lucky that the only damages were my lanai screen door blew off and no power for five days. One block away there were boats in the street, debris, cars abandoned, and tons of furniture just littered everywhere! Even the Ritz Carlton was heavily damaged and will be closed until next spring. I was in Palm Beach in 1992 when Andrew hit as a Category 5 hurricane and had no damage then, either, so I wasn’t worried since all the weather channels expected Ian to go up to Tampa! Instead, the storm was so huge it covered the entire state and the wind blew the power out before it made landfall about twenty miles north of here. Some of my favorite restaurants on the beach were completely gone, and our beautiful pier was destroyed, but they are rebuilding it now.”\n\nCarole Smithwick-Kiebach reports that she and David have put behind them the bad experience of trying to build a dream house on their farm in Willis, TX. “We are now abiding in a ’cozy’ 900-square-foot apartment in our barn. The 64 square miles of timber property that abuts two and half sides of our farm has been sold to a national subdivision development company, so we are not making any more plans for building until we know what will be surrounding us. We have just returned from a month in Brunssum, Netherlands, visiting our grandkids for the first time in three years (way too long; boy, have they grown!) with a family week in Vicenza and Venice, Italy. Son Andrew ’98 (fs) and wife Jen have bought a flat in Vicenza in anticipation of her retiring from US Space Force in 2027. She will continue with the NATO assignment for another 18 months, so we will be heading back for a Carnival visit in February. Thanksgiving in Georgia with family and college friends, and Christmas in Seattle with son Eric and wife L complete our travel itinerary until this summer.”\n\nFrom Rick Frachtman: “Anne and I recently returned from the Malt Shop Memories cruise to the Eastern Caribbean. These oldies cruises are great fun (the Flower Power cruise being another) for those who enjoy music of the 50’s, 60’s, and early 70’s. Several of the original artists are still performing, now in their late seventies or early eighties. There were plenty of activities and ports of call, and we were bombarded with entertainment. Our trip occurred during the World Series. We were surrounded by obnoxious Philadelphia Phillies fans, but we persevered and had the last laugh. I actually won a couple of small bets on the Astros placed earlier in the year in Las Vegas. However, no one will mistake me for Mattress Mack.” Don Pickels also wrote with a music memory, this one from 1969: “Jeff Cross and I proudly bought concert tickets for The Temptations, appearing in the old downtown Coliseum. We dressed up ’hippy preppy’ and picked up our girlfriends Kristy and Gloria, excited to see live performances of \"My Girl,\" \"Ain’t Too Proud to Beg,\" etc. but we were shocked walking in we were way under-dressed! On the long walk to our seats, we got verbally assaulted but kept our cool and said nothing. It was intense for about five minutes.Then the music began. After the first song (\"The Way You Do the Things You Do\"), we were all laughing and dancing together. We obviously loved the music and were accepted by the crowd as fellow Motown fans. That’s the power of great music!”\n\nPeggy Whitmore Douglas is “still busy with my two grandkids here in Pittsburgh. Son Rob just came for a Thanksgiving visit from Florida where he is an attorney for City Group. I still ride my horse as often as I can. My most productive time is spent with visits to rehab and assisted living facilities with my two Therapy Dog International dogs. My older one has clocked more than 700 volunteer hours!”\n\nJeff Cross retired as of September 2021 “I wonder if I am about the last to make this step in our class? I am stubborn, but finally realized that my clients could get by without me, mostly because all of a sudden, I noticed most were managed by people not too much older than our son. To celebrate retirement, my wife Elise and I took off in April for a six-week road trip from Houston to Sister Bay, Wisconsin and back. We were gone for about six weeks, drove 5,200 miles and played 16 different golf courses in 11 states. We covered 21 different Interstates on the trip. It was a lot of fun to see places we had never seen and also some we wanted to see again. The highlights were getting to attend the Kentucky Derby in Louisville and spending three days at Firestone CC in Akon, Ohio. Not as exotic a trip as I can imagine most in the class have taken, but memorable to us. We are due to get a new SUV in 2023 and may head west to Wyoming next year. I imagine we need to get in road trips while we can still drive!” As for me, Bonnie German Chandler, I can report that John and I see our son and his family most weekends, and my daughter has been living with us since the pandemic. John finally retired from his research position at the Harvard Observatory this past summer, but he is still doing most of the same research at home in consultation with other colleagues who have also “retired.”\n\nI am still raising a lot of our food, training dogs, riding my horse, and competing in dog and goat shows, but choral singing had to take a hiatus during the pandemic and still hasn’t revived. I’d love to take some road trips like Jeff, but it is hard to find farm sitters who can milk goats!\n\n1970\n\nMalcolm Waddell Houston, Texas\n\nmwaddell@waddellinvestments.com\n\nmwaddell@sba-skincare.com\n\n2022, it’s the end of the year that most of us in the Class of 1970 turned 70, and the year that we finally celebrated our 50th high school reunion, a couple of years late. That April makeup gathering with the Class of 1971 was a blast, but I’ll save those comments for the end of this column. Let’s start with your latest updates.\n\nOnce I got her email address corrected, the first news came streaming in from Sheryl Lynn Coles Jones: “Jack and I got married in 2019 in New Orleans, where Jack is from and where my grandmother (dad’s side) was from. New Orleans has always been a special place for both of us. For the most part, we are well, but have noticed that this decade brings additional challenges. Ever notice how easy it is to tweak something that takes weeks to heal? Merging our six kids, and eight grandchildren (two boys born in 2020 and 2021) has been both fun and busy. I finally got one of my three kids back to Texas – the only one not born in Austin, Tyler, now lives in Austin. Son Travis and family live in Virginia, and daughter Elyssa lives in Tucson, so we are still traveling quite a bit to be with them. Being retired means we have more time to go but going is getting a little tougher as the years pass. Still, we love to travel and went to Alaska and Santa Fe, NM this year. Next year we are planning to resume our European travels to France, Spain, Italy, Scotland, and Ireland to explore and continue working on our family history. Jack is still doing a little consulting, and I spend time volunteering as a Master Naturalist, culinary assistant at cooking classes, beekeeper, and soon to be volunteer for both the Daughters of the American Revolution and Daughters of the Republic of Texas. This year I am planning to hang wreaths on veterans’ graves in both San Antonio and Austin. Staying active and continually learning seems to keep us younger, at least at heart. This year we will be in Houston over Christmas and New Years to be with Jack’s family and attend a wedding reception of Warren’s daughter, Lauren. That will be the longest time we have been in Houston since 2019. I am sorry we couldn’t make the reunion but looking forward to the 55th.”\n\nNext up was a note from Ed Neuhaus: “I have the typical retirement scenario – golf, travel, and even croquet. But the most fun thing I do is drive carpool for four of my grandkids two times a week. The ’bus’ ride is only 15-20 minutes, but I get their update on who likes who (or the other way around), what their favorite music is and even some inside scoop which means what is said on the ’bus’ stays on the ’bus’. I had to be taught this very basic lesson after my first time to drive ’the bus’. One of the kids turned me in to their parents for looking at my phone! Truth be known, I was looking at my phone to play one of their songs, BUT I know I should not be doing that... lesson learned for both me and them!”\n\nSuzanne and I traveled to Scotland this past summer and got to spend a beautiful evening with Lisa Tuttle, her husband Colin and daughter Emily. Our class’s most published author shared: “As for us, we continue as usual, despite all the political turmoil, the scary increase in cost of living, and the more or less usual worries. However, inflation has taken a local toll – the Stonefield Hotel plans to shut down from January 4th until March 4thsomething that has never happened before. I think Emily won’t mind having that break, since she’s been working so long and hard (and has money saved up), but other staff are not so lucky and may not return when the hotel opens again – at least, not if they manage to get other jobs, which might not even be in the area. Since Emily’s birthday is in February, we are thinking of going away somewhere for another break and her birthday treat. Very likely somewhere in Spain. I do have exciting book news! (Well, it is exciting for me.) It looks like I’m going to have not one, not two, but THREE books published in 2023. One is a short story collection titled Riding the Nightmare, from Valancourt Books (in the US), who published my previous collection, The Dead Hours of Night, in 2021. It will be available in hardback, paperback and as an e-book. Another is a new novel, the third in my detective series set in 1890s England, The Curious Affair of the Missing Mummies. It’s being published, like the first two, by Jo Fletcher Books in the UK, but I think it should be available in the US from Amazon and other booksellers. And the third book is a reprint of a short novel, first published in 2004, called My Death. I am very excited that this new edition is being published by New York Review Books in their NYRB Classics list.”\n\nSuzanne and I visited with Linda Dixon quite a few years ago in her second home at the time, Las Vegas, NV. After living in Santa Fe for quite a few years, she’s back in Vegas and sent: “A quick update on my life: in the summer of 2021, I tripped over my coffee table breaking my right ankle and left toe. I was hospitalized and underwent surgery the next morning. I’m doing much better now, although I have periods of fatigue and slight brain fog. Occasionally, I walk with a cane. Ending on a happy note, Vegas has established the Formula I car races incorporating the STRIP as part of the course. Adele is beginning her residency here, as well as Garth Brooks. We just finished the Professional Bull Riders Rodeo. My adopted niece sang the National Anthem at the T Mobile Arena to kick off the event. She sings for many of the events in Las Vegas and loves it.”\n\nOn a recent trip to Austin, I had coffee and spent a morning with Joanne Hankamer, Randy’s widow. She showed me her beautiful new townhome in the Old West Austin Historic District – the same neighborhood where Randy and she had lived. Their two daughters, Kelly and Cheryl, both live in Austin and are doing well. Kelly was working in town, and Cheryl had just recently moved back after leaving a job in the DC area. It was a lovely visit.\n\nI got a wonderful note from Robin Beck about Andy Beck, their children, and her latest news: “We still miss Andy at the holidays. He brought energy, love, and hilarity. Some of our families’ most repeated stories begin with him. Though we were no longer married, we were usually all together for the holidays. That included dear Priscilla with whom Andy found so much happiness in those last few years. Here’s what’s been happening in BeckVille. Older son Jack is in the Bay Area where he has started an organization called Turn Out which matches volunteers with queer organizations. I believe he is in his fifth year and just received a grant from California to scale-up his operation in three additional cities. He was also just awarded a Roddenberry Fellowship/ Grant. He works like his dad (too many hours) and really enjoys living in Oakland where he gets to see many friends from his previous time overseas. Younger son Alec and his wife are mostly on the go. They live about 40 minutes from us. Alec’s wife Amelia Brodka participated in the Olympics this year in Japan as skateboarding and surfing were added as new sports categories. Alec works for the Tony Hawk Foundation which partners with skaters and citizens who want to build a skatepark in their city. They now have over 500 skateparks up and going. Amelia just closed out ’Exposure’, her annual event for women skateboarders. She is from a small town in Poland that is the hub of the refugees coming from Ukraine. Alec and Amelia met after college, when she moved to a small town in Oceanside, CA, which is where I grew up. I live in Laguna Niguel, a little below Newport, with husband, Mike McCann. The weather has been wonderful for all the gardening I so enjoy except for the outbreak of the Laguna fire which stopped one street above us – pretty scary, and we evacuated for two days. I’m not retired yet. My company, BioBarrier, (safer surgical gloves) survived Covid and is in scale-up overseas. We hope to have product for sale in the coming year. With Covid still in so many factories, we took the time to file new patent applications and execute prototyping for follow-on products.”\n\nBob Frachtman checked in with his latest news: “We now have three grandkids: Gabriel (4), Levi (1.5), and Lily (4 months). Our daughter Adrienne will be applying to dental school next year at age 31. Anyone with contacts at UT Houston? Older son Julian’s rich media self-serve international ad company is doing very well. His younger brother Brandon is a commercial real estate developer and just finished his first building in downtown Austin and is starting #2. He was also instrumental in the building of a very cool night club downtown called Superstition. I’m getting a great second education in the world of business from these two. My wife Sherrie is enjoying being a Nonna, along with being on two non-profit boards (one of which is Austin PBS). I’m still practicing full-time as a gastroenterologist. Our Austin group of 40 gastroenterologists has joined a national group based out of Dallas, so I now have about 700 partners. We’re very lucky to be in Austin with all our kids and grandchildren.”\n\nBrian Atlas wrote in from his mountain home: “Well a lot is happening with my family. I have three daughters, three sons-in-law, and seven grandchildren. My youngest Angela had a baby in January. My grandkids range from 10 months to 15 years. This past week I took the entire family to Disney World. I have to say it was the best trip, not vacation, that Cindy and I have ever been on. The Disney company creates the best attractions you can imagine. We had a great time. I retired in April, and we bought a home in Silverthorne, CO where we spend most of our time. I sold my development in Austin. We still maintain our home in Houston where the family lives including my 92-year-old mother and her 95-year-old husband. Most of my time is spent golfing, traveling, skiing, hiking, and enjoying my family. Cindy and I were in Italy in September and had a great time. Other than that, I’m just working on my new house in the mountains and getting ready for ski season.”\n\nErik Littlejohn shared: “This may be the first time (or at least the first time in a long time) that I’ve written with an update. My daughter Isabella graduates in May from The American University of Paris. We will get a jump on the Christmas season when I visit her in Paris in early December. She will be back in Houston for Christmas and New Year’s before returning for her last semester. Following graduation, we are planning a celebratory European victory lap to favorite spots. It will be a fun and memorable time, and I’m certainly looking forward to it! Best to all my classmates.”\n\nFrom just up north I got this note from Phil Salvador: “We are all fine here in The Woodlands. I continue to progress my sea kayaking ’career’ through trips and training. My wife Christiane has always got projects on the go. In January she will visit our daughter Carla in South Korea where she is studying. We don’t hear much from our son Lucas. It seems to be because he is either too busy with his job at ASML in Connecticut or having too much fun with his friends.”\n\nSam Collins was the next to check in: “Hi Class of ’70. At our age we should all be thankful we’re still here to enjoy what for I hope most of us is the time of our lives where it’s all about grandkids, travel, and doing what the hell we want when we want. Our first-born Jordan ’00 got married to Samantha in October in San Juan where they live. She’s a dream, and they’re living the Caribbean good life in Puerto Rico. Daughter Emily Collins Blau ’02 and husband Lance live in Cinco Ranch in Katy with our two grandchildren, Poppy (3) and Bennett (18 months). They’re both a lot of fun, and we’re with them often. Wife Andi and I did three weeks in September in Italy and Portugal with friends – a great trip. Right now, we’re on a plane to Vegas for four days for food and shows and a little gambling. All is well. We’re enjoying this stage of life. Hope y’all are, too.”\n\nSelby Schwend sent an email with a similar sentiment: “We couldn’t make the reunion this year due to a travel conflict with our long-planned trip to Ireland. We had a great time driving all over the country visiting castles, museums, seaside vistas and fabulous pubs along the way. We’re trying to figure out how to go back sooner rather than later. All the kids are doing well and are still spread out across the country. Our oldest grandchild graduated in May from the Citadel, and our youngest just turned two.\n\nWe’ve got eight grandkids in all, and they are truly a blessing. Hope all my classmates are doing well and enjoying the golden years.”\n\nJanet Lee Cohen was with family in Bethesda, MD when she wrote: “We’re currently planning a 50th anniversary trip in 2024, hoping to go to Italy. Fingers crossed we’ll be able to celebrate somewhere. It really doesn’t matter where we are. We can’t quite believe we’re old enough to have been married for so long. We lost Rick’s 98-year-old dad in April. He and Rick’s mom were married for almost 76 years. We feel fortunate to have had him in our lives for so long. He was full of wisdom and fun, the best combination. I’m grateful for all of you and for our crackerjack reporter. Malcolm doesn’t sit still for very long but long enough to persuade us to weigh in, whether we have anything exciting to report or not. Thankfully, I have nothing exciting to report, and right now, that suits me fine. These last few years have brought enough ’excitement.’ Sending love to all our classmates for a safe, healthy, peaceful, and joyous holiday.” Janet’s right! I do want you to check in whether you’ve got big news or not.\n\nLike Janet, Frank McGuyer felt he, too, had little to report, but the sale of his successful homebuilding company in 2021 was a big deal and well-timed. Frank updates us: “Post-merger has been much busier than expected. It seems assimilation is more difficult than anticipated. I am still tied in with an earnout for three more years and obligated to provide a lot-and-land bank for a couple more. Our granddaughter is enjoying Kinkaid, so I’m sure that we will be visiting the campus more. Grandson here is also close by at St Francis. Our son Bart ’02 and his family are still in LA, and we don’t see that changing anytime soon.”\n\nBill Blomdahl reports: “All is well in Tyler. We spent Thanksgiving with our two daughters and their husbands and our four grandchildren in Houston and had a blast with all of them together. They are all coming to our home in Tyler for Christmas, so Nancy is gearing up for that. Nancy and I bought a new farm just outside of Tyler, and I have been working on some timber management and pond work with the idea of stocking the pond for the grandkids. We have lots of deer, so I have been feeding them and trying to get a handle on how many we have. We have a low fence place, so they come and go as they please, but they do really like the corn I feed them. We had such a great time at the Reunion. It was a great turnout and as usual so fun to see and catch up with everyone and their spouses. We need to have one every year if possible since we are not getting any younger! I just turned\n\n70 in August, and Nancy turned 65 this past April. We celebrated our 45th wedding anniversary this past June, so 2022 has been a big year for us.”\n\nEllen Ginther Reifslager has been on the move in 2022 and has more trips planned: “We seem to have been traveling all year. Besides being in Hawaii for six months, it’s mainly been road trips to some of our favorite places in the west. We just had Thanksgiving with our son Matthew and daughter-in-law in Sedona. Now it’s out to see our daughter Angela and her family in Laguna Beach before Christmas. Our youngest Christen is leaving on a trip to Egypt on Christmas Day, so we will be home to send her off on her big adventure. Wishing everyone a healthy and fulfilling holiday season and new year.”\n\nLike Ellen, we traveled extensively in 2022. Besides the trip to Scotland in mid-summer, we also went abroad to Barbados, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Australia, and New Zealand. We did a full family trip to Maui in March just before the reunion. It was a great travel year after the Covid lockdown.\n\nKatherine Thomson Jordan (fs) shared her travel story and news of brother Erwin Thompson (fs): “Our cruise trip from Montreal to Fort Lauderdale was very nice although Hurricane Fiona demolished the port and businesses at Prince Edward Island. It kept our ship from docking there, and that was really one big reason for the trip! Years ago, a friend whom I made when Roy was stationed at Columbus Air Force Base said her family had a home on the Island, and it sounded so beautiful. It was fun to see Quebec City, a little of Montreal, the small island of Cap aux Meules, Boston and a little bit of Ft. Lauderdale – overall a worthwhile 10-day trip! I went to see daughter Katie and family last September in New Bern and had a great time celebrating her birthday and grandson Logan’s 8th birthday. We came home to celebrate my youngest grandson Benjy’s 3rd birthday and my 70th! Hard for me to say it! But all here are doing well. Blessed and looking forward to Christmas with my brother Erwin and wife Margaret. They have temporarily relocated to New Braunfels, while they remodel a new home in The Woodlands. Their son Stephen and his wife and two boys now live there also. They haven’t given up on retiring in New B because they still have property there, so I just hope it’s not going to take too many years!\n\nHappy Holidays to all!”\n\nTom Hale and wife Sherry have also been traveling a lot in 2022: “We went to Banff and Jasper, Canada for hiking and golf – gorgeous mountains and glaciers. Then we went to Istanbul and Troy with Browne Baker and wife Robin. We went and saw friends in Spain north of Gibraltar in a little town called Jimena de la Frontera. We also visited the ancient Roman towns of Italica, Emerita Augusta, and Baelo Claudia. These sites have wonderful Roman ruins. Sherry is still at the top of her tennis game. Our son Theodore is kicking tail at the Houston DA’s office. My daughter Emily is still traveling the world, and I am doing real estate until I die.”\n\nSpeaking of Browne, he, too, sent a quick note: “We’re in Canyon Lake with Tom Hale and Sherry for a quick Thanksgiving holiday getaway.”\n\nBrowne, Robin, Tom, Sherry, Suzanne, and I attended a jazz concert at Alta Arts in Bellaire in November. At that gathering, Browne shared the news that our former classmate Dick Colvin (fs) had serious health problems. Browne and Dick were roommates for their first two years together in college at the University of Texas, and they had remained friends over the years. In my first class-notes request, I included the news about Dick’s condition and asked you to share any thoughts or memories about Dick, who left Kinkaid after 8th grade. Many of you were saddened and expressed your hopes for his recovery. Unfortunately, Dick passed away the day after Thanksgiving. He was surrounded by his family. Trish Houck (fs) sent this remembrance: “I want to share a very sweet memory of Dickie. I hadn’t thought of this in ages and ages. Either we were in kindergarten or first grade when Dickie invited me to go to the circus with him, my very first date! My mom was so excited for me! I’m sure I was all dressed up in very scratchy petticoats and patent leather shoes when he came to the door for me. I don’t remember any more specifics, but I do hope you’ll share this story with his wife Nancy and son Richard, Jr. I hope it brings a smile to them both to know that even at six Dick was a ’lover boy.’” I heard from Dick’s cousin, Phil Colvin, who asked that I forward Trish’s email to him to share with the family at Dick’s memorial services in Hunt, TX last week. One other piece of sad news came from Ginger Hamblen Busboom, “My sweet husband Mark Busboom passed away on November 14, 2022, from Lewy Body Dementia. He had a tough time this past year due to aggressive dementia. He was 73.” On behalf of all our class, I extend our deepest sympathies to the Colvin and Busboom families.\n\nTrish and I got to spend an afternoon together the week after Thanksgiving on a charity matter and have caught up on several emails. She lives in Dallas and is doing well. When asked about her holiday plans, she shared:\n\n“My daughter Reilly will be in Dallas for Christmas, so we will be here with her! She graduated from the University of Oklahoma in May 2018 and started working at Baylor, Scott and White in Plano in June. This is the first Christmas since she graduated that she hasn’t been working on Christmas Day! We are, also, planning on having her cousin Emily Hale here with us, too.”\n\nI’ll end as promised with the April 2022 Reunion recap. Despite so many of you being unable to attend due to 70th birthday trips/plans and other pent-up family travel obligations, we had a good turnout for the “Class of ’70 Turns 70 Reunion”. Attendees at one or more of the festivities included Neal Anderson, Browne Baker, Ted Barrow, Bill Blomdahl, Sam Collins, Carolyn Hazelhurst Cullinan, Alan Gerger, Tom Hale, Larry Jacobs, Linda Weingarten Kates, Trey Lander, Erik Littlejohn, Bill Paull, Betsy Mickley Sheets, John Tio Suman, and yours truly. Ron Bernell and Bob Frachtman stopped by, but both had other commitments. Our Saturday night dinner at Caracol was celebrated with friends from the Class of 1971, including Lila Pace Belitz, Laura Hazelhurst Cullinan, Claudia Frost Ford, Frank Pardue, Mike Pearson, Cindi Wilson Ray, Heidi Sheesley, Lisa Morris Simon, and Marisue Dougherty Tallichet. Thanks to all the many spouse attendees who put up with us telling all our old stories. I was supposed to take pictures, but all I did was visit. So many of you who didn’t attend had wanted to, so I think we’ll have enough demand for the 55th. By the time this note is printed that weekend will be just two years away, just one year later than Bill Blomdahl wanted!\n\nThanks as always for sharing your current happenings and keep those emails coming in.\n\n1971\n\nClaudia Wilson Frost Houston, Texas Cfrost@orrick.com\n\nLouisa Patty Barnes shared the news that her fall on black ice in early February delayed their planned cross-country road trip in April, but they pulled it off, with her husband driving the entire westward leg (5,000 miles one way due to all their side trips to visit family and friends, and to see some sights along the way). On their way back home, somewhere in Minnesota, they made a sudden stop that unknowingly allowed their special cargo (a four inch \"pet\" tarantula they were transporting back east for their niece) to escape. When they discovered her loose in the back of the car three days later, they had to completely empty their car in order to capture her, carefully checking every item as they took it out. They finally found her hiding under the console between the front seats! Also, in October she got to serve on a jury for a two-day criminal trial. Fascinating, but exhausting experience. Louisa concluded, saying “so now I am looking forward to a nice, quiet winter at home in New England.”\n\nDarrell Bock reports that he is still engaged in his ministry work around the world. Last year he was in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, and Switzerland as well as numerous locales in the USA.\n\nDanny Carroll checked in from Wheaton and shared the news that his newest book was published in August: The Lord Roars: Recovering the Prophetic Voice for Today (http:// bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/thelord-roars/410430)\n\nThe Class of 1971 lost a cherished member with the passing of Helen Potter Allison this year. We extend our condolences to Helen’s family, friends and loved ones.\n\nBest wishes to all of you for a safe, and wonderful summer.\n\nClaudia\n\nLewis Luckenbach reports, “My wife, Kathy, and I drove to Crozet, VA for a nice driving vacation. Ellen Carrington King is the owner of the award-winning King Family Vineyards at Crozet, VA. I have been there a few times. We had a mini 50th class reunion with Ellen Carrington King, George Shackelford, who lives in nearby Culpepper, VA, his grandson Hunter, and myself. Between Ellen, George and myself, we have 20 grandchildren. We had a great time talking about past times as well as our information about our families.\n\nThe King Family Vineyards is a wonderful facility and very family friendly in a great setting in the Virginia Appalachians. On the home front one of my grandchildren. Valentina, plays soccer at the Albion Hurricanes Soccer Club on Campbell Road in the academy program. One of her teammates is a third grader at Kinkaid. Valentina attends the St. Constantin School. Small world. Allan Tang will be wintering at his place in Palm Springs, California. Happy holidays to all.”\n\nMike Frachtman shares that besides practicing law he spends his weekend at his place at Chappell Hill, a few miles east of Brenham.\n\n1973\n\nPam Dilworth Kissiah Berkeley, California pkissiah@gmail.com\n\nThank you to our hard-working host committee: Caroline Jogerst Sabin, Chuck Blanton, Marion Perryman Liedtke, Chris Jones, David Martin, Missy Baker Jones, Lisa Bernell Rostad, and yours truly. If you have not received your invitation, please contact me at pkissiah@gmail.com.\n\nThank you to those classmates who wrote to me sharing their news. I love hearing from you!\n\nScott West is excited to announce the arrival of his and Laurie’s first grandchild, Maxine T. West. Maxine was born May 2022 and is the daughter of Zach West ’06 and Liana West. Scott’s wife of 35 years, Laurie Dempsey, is holding baby Maxine.\n\nJane Staub Towler has a granddaughter! Talia Hetta Sturtz born August 9, 2022. Jane is excited to have timed her retirement quite well from her nursing career. Now she is getting to spend time between Boulder (with her daughter’s growing family) and Bethesda. Janes says she is looking forward to seeing everyone in March! Be there!\n\nJanet Weingarten Battista sent her greetings from Bryce Canyon where she and Tom traveled after a wedding weekend in Houston. Janet is enjoying traveling again and getting back out into the world! She cannot wait to see everyone in March.\n\nher free time cleaning out so much acquired stuff, she is now volunteering for a few causes that are close to her heart. Caroline’s travel has been mostly domestic and focused on family in Oregon and South Carolina, but she hopes to plan some adventures in 2023. Caroline also reports that her three kids are doing well in their various endeavors. Her middle son, Finlay, recently married and started a company focused on providing industrial hemp materials for construction purposes. Her oldest son, Colin, is pursuing acting and screenwriting in Hollywood and her youngest son, Ben, is the founder of a craft brewery in Austin, Friends & Allies Brewing. He has a great tasting room, so if you live in Austin or are just visiting, stop by and taste the brews!\n\nCaddell Liedtke and wife\n\nMarion Perryman Liedtke are still living in Midland. They are both looking forward to seeing their Falcon Classmates at our 50th Reunion. If we miss any of you there, maybe we will see you in the Texas Hill Country where we recently bought a place and plan to spend more time.\n\nChris Jones ticked two things off his Bucket List! He went to Scotland during the first week of September 2022 and played eight rounds of golf (that’s around 40 miles of walking) in nine days. His body is still recovering! He was also thrilled to attend Game 2 of the World Series in Houston! Hooray for the Astros ~ World Series Champs!\n\nLewis Luckenbach III Sugar Land, Texas lluckfam@aol.com\n\nAllan\n\nTang Houston, Texas allantang@earthlink.net\n\nThe Class of 1973 has a BIG celebration upon us! Our 50th Reunion will be in March 2023, and we are looking forward to having everyone come together for what is sure to be a festive “hippy-dippy” trip down Memory Lane. The early 1970s were crazy years to be in high school!\n\n(But I guess high school years are always crazy!)\n\nDeLinda Fuqua Baker reported that her family has been humming along in 2022 with very few changes. DeLinda’s oldest son is a real estate developer in Seattle, WA, and her daughter is a marketing director for a museum in Houston. Her other son has resigned from the Coast Guard and is pursuing an engineering degree. DeLinda loves spending time with her two granddaughters (2 and 4 years old) who are growing very fast and are incredibly cute! Her husband retired from ExxonMobil and rather than kicking back and traveling, he began teaching at Texas A&M at Galveston. He grew a beard and is enjoying the professorial life.\n\nBart Brewer and wife Julia are almost empty nesters, with their youngest now off to college out of state and their oldest in his senior year at a local college. Discussions and decisions regarding future plans are just beginning to come to the forefront.\n\nCaroline Jogerst Sabin retired at the end of September 2020 after 18+ years of managing a private foundation in Houston. It was quite an adjustment, but the timing of retirement was fortunate, as it gave her time to care for her mother during those last few months of her life. Besides spending\n\nMissy Baker Jones and husband Scott Jones are finding a bit more time to travel. Although Scott is still working, his schedule has become more flexible. They spend their time between Savannah and Columbus where their kids and grandkids live, and they are also getting away for fun travel with friends. Their favorite recent trip was a return visit to Fogo Island, Newfoundland, CA. Missy and Scott also try to meet their family as often as possible at their place in Western NC. They are looking forward to seeing everyone at our 50th Reunion!\n\nRobert Bradley reports that there is a growing contingent of Kinkaid alumni with homes on the Guadalupe River in Hunt, TX. In addition to Rob, there are three other classmates with homes there and he suggested a future reunion in Hunt! Sounds like fun to me!\n\nAnd finally, Pam Dilworth Kissiah and husband Gary have just finished remodeling a townhouse in Los Gatos, CA where we raised our kids. We have enjoyed reconnecting with friends there, and I have recently taken up pickleball and cycling (thanks to the invention of e-bikes!). I have accepted that I will never improve my golf game - as I started playing much too late!\n\nBut with pickleball, there’s hope! We still spend time at our bay house in Berkeley and are also enjoying hikes with our dog, Clover, who just turned one. I am looking forward to our 50th Reunion in Houston and really hope to see you there!\n\n1974\n\nMadeleine Topper Sheehy Houston, Texas madtop05@gmail.com\n\n1975\n\nJudy Levin Houston, Texas jude118@aol.com\n\n1976\n\nHomoiselle Sadler Bujosa Houston, Texas hbujosa@att.net\n\n1977\n\nJane VanDeMark Houston, Texas janevandemark@yahoo.com\n\n1978\n\nSarah Deal Frankenfeld Austin, Texas sarahf422@me.com\n\nNo news this issue? Come to our 45th\n\nReunion March 24-25 to see each other in person and ask your classmates face to face how they are doing! That is a MUCH better way to learn about one another than writing it out!!\n\nGo to kinkaid.org/reunionweekend to learn more about the weekend. Be on the lookout for information coming soon about our Class Party on Saturday, March 25! Look forward to seeing everyone!\n\n1979\n\nSteven Arnold Houston, Texas sda@3lmc.com\n\nEvans Attwell Houston, Texas eattwell@gmail.com\n\nAlice Berry Houston, Texas missformicadinette@yahoo.com\n\n1980\n\nTom Dunlap San Diego, CA 619-929-1413 td@tomdunlap.com\n\n1981\n\nJohn McReynolds Houston, Texas j-mcr@comcast.net\n\n1982\n\nMaria Semander Crawford Redondo Beach, California msemander@yahoo.com\n\nGreetings Classmates! The last time I wrote this column we were still looking for a place to host our 40th reunion and I’m happy to report that not only did we find the perfect place, but we all survived the night too! They say “a picture speaks a thousand words” so I decided to send in our group pictures from the reunion for those who didn’t see the pictures and those who didn’t make it. Our theme was “Taking it Back to Old School” and hosting it at El Patio definitely took us back in time. The weekend was a huge success thanks to the event planning expertise of Michelle Rogers Rogers. I was happy to be her “personal assistant” but the reunion truly came together because of her.\n\nThe girls of ’82 had an impromptu Girls Night Out the night before our reunion at Emily Wynne Bolin’s house. We pulled out old yearbooks, laughed a lot and talked about how glad we are that we didn’t have social media back then! We did utilize modern technology though and Facetimed Mike Curran in San Diego, who couldn’t make it to the reunion but had sent a video with his best wishes for a successful and fun party.\n\nOn the night of the reunion, the Class of ’82 joined forces with the Class of ’81 for a combined Reunion. It proved to be a great move…. double the classmates and double the fun. Passing the door of “Club No Minor” as you walked into El Patio and to the backroom party brought back so many memories! Crazy to think that we all drank margaritas in that same bar over 40 years ago.\n\nIt was great seeing everyone from ’81 and ’82! Party goers from our class included; Michelle Rogers Rogers, Emily Wynne Bolin, Eveta Weingarten, Helena Papadopolous Johnson and husband Tom, Baranna Baker, Laura Wynne Cale, Waverly White Gage, Michael Guerriero and wife Hilairy, Heather Harrison, Bruce Phillips and Marilyn Taylor Phillips, Robbie Cox, Ben Eaton and wife Dawn, Carol Attwell Bourne and husband Mike, Bubba Vandiver and wife Courtney, Martin Brock, Cynthia Chambers Ortale, Melisa Billingsley Herring (and a late appearance by hubby Fred!), Susan Schwartz Cornett, Vince Elliott, Annelise Bovet, Caroline Coates, Nelle Gregory and husband Tim, Curt Alfrey and wife Sabine (class of “much younger” lol), Harlan Murphy, Fay Monsen Kirby and husband Don, Greg Kung, Leslie Reid and Duncan Lamme (who isn’t in the picture but I swear I thought he came!) and also Cathy Davis Bell and Cynthia Davis who didn’t make it to the reunion but were at Girls Night Out. Hope I got everyone! I had to go off my memory for spouses (which at our age is definitely hit or miss) so my apologies for missing anyone. And of course…. me, Maria Semander Crawford\n\nI hope everyone has been doing great since the reunion and staying happy and healthy. Be ready to send in updates next time around…you should have plenty to report by then. In the meantime, take it easy and if it’s easy, take it twice!\n\nWill Cravens is still living in Houston and married to his beautiful college sweetheart Janet. They have three kids in college: James at SCAD, Mary getting her MBA at University of San Diego and Stephen, a freshman at University of St. Thomas. Chico and Kay are still doing well and are two of his best friends. He’s working full time for the Scanlan Foundation, a giving foundation that supports the Catholic Church in Texas.\n\nMeg Estes Tapp lives with husband Filson in Houston. She is the plant expert for Houston Public Media / NPR radio station in Houston. She also teaches Classes at Urban Harvest and travels nationally to speak to and conduct workshops for garden clubs.\n\nMalek Bohsali’s son, Laith, started his freshman year at Texas A&M studying engineering, like his dad. Their daughter, Leah, is a freshman at Memorial High. He continues to work on real estate development projects.\n\nMarc Oster joined Lee Majors in the Bionic Man club by getting a new hip. I am already a member! I think my referral will get me an extra IV bag of fluids when I go in for my second knee replacement.\n\nBobby Briscoe retired as an Army Officer (1991-2011). He started as Private, retired as a Major. He did two tours in Iraq. He is a Union Airline Captain-Boeing 737 with United Airlines. He is the CEO and owner of West Houston Aero, an aircraft maintenance, repair, and parts company. He has been married 21 years. He lives behind St. Thomas High School in Magnolia Grove.\n\nFor seven plus years Karen Fillipone Haddock and Bill have been living in Wellesley, MA. Their son William graduates from California Lutheran University December 2022, and will likely stay in LA; their daughter Annabel graduated from TCU in 2022, and lives in Manhattan. Karen is an adjunct faculty member at Boston College supervising student teachers. They have two rescue dogs. Bill loves to kayak, and Karen is running with the kindest group of people New England has to offer.\n\nKelly and I are empty nesters and are loving life (and freedom)! We have seven children, one in Boston, Chicago, Fort Collins, San Diego, and three in the Houston area. Annie, our youngest, got married in November and Tinsley, the middle daughter, is getting married in May, which will make four married –three daughters and one son. We have five grandchildren all in the Houston area, two girls and three boys.\n\n1984\n\nJackie Fair Houston, Texas jfair36900@aol.com\n\n1985\n\nCarolyn Lasater Hodges Dripping Springs, Texas carolynhodges@marykay.com\n\n1986\n\nJulie Templin Berman Houston, Texas julie@thelimogeslady.com\n\n1987\n\nDoug Rosenzweig Houston, Texas dougrosez@aol.com\n\n1988\n\nJohn Semander Redondo Beach, California cperiod@hotmail.com\n\n1989\n\nElizabeth Oxford Pagan Houston, Texas elizabethpagan@me.com\n\nHi class of ’89!\n\nI have to start off by saying this job is so fun. I truly love that I get to email back and forth and keep up with so many of you all. As I get older, I realize more and more how lucky we were to all grow up together at Kinkaid. I feel such a connection to each one of you - you are like a second family and it is such a gift.\n\nIn that vein, I’ve luckily gotten a chance to see lots of our ’89 crew lately! This past spring, Greer and I went to Walter Weathers’ boys’ Post Oak Little League game! Now that we are empty nesters, we don’t get to do things like that, so it was a real treat! The\n\nAnthony Brown The Woodlands, Texas abrowntex@gmail.com\n\nWeathers brothers brought home a win so it was a great day all around! Then in October, Lynn Rothermel Neligan (who lives in Boston) was in town, so Jill Lichtenstein Deutser and I went and met her for coffee. We had SO much fun catching up! Finally, in November a bunch of us flew to Denver to visit Laney Vaughan Pitstick. Jill Lichtenstein Deutser, Bronwyn Burke Tilton, Beth Young Young, Andrea Boone Chapman, Jennifer Deal Rogers, Hillary Jarrett Millikin and Allison Withers Edwards all made the trip. We stayed up way too late laughing, re-telling old stories and catching up on each other’s current lives. Even though we don’t all keep up every day, it was still like we were together just yesterday at Kinkaid. And now for the updates. I loved all the responses I got this time. Thank you!!\n\nBo Ford: Bo and wife Cassie moved up to the Pacific Northwest in 2018, living on Mercer Island outside Seattle. Raising two characters, Caroline and Alice, who are now in 6th and 7th grade. Come visit in the summer!\n\nScot Johnson: Many of you have already been thru this experience with your own kids, but our twins Adele and Abby are seniors at Kinkaid and smack in the middle of the college admissions process. That brings back memories of my mom at our typewriter filling out repetitive info on my applications. There are some aspects that make the process easier these days, and some that make it more complicated. I think there are about 12 kids or so working through the process with each dean, and there was only a single person working with all of us! For those who don’t know, my mom passed away August 5, 2022 after a long battle with complications from dementia. It was sad to say goodbye, but we rejoiced at celebrating her life and knowing she is no longer suffering. My dad is doing well, all things considered, and he has been a real trooper and tremendous role model during our challenging journey. Best to all of you.\n\nMarkus Kolber: My legal career appears, finally, to be on track. I had nearly departed from the profession, burnt out, following many years as contract counsel to the Public Defender of New Mexico, when my long-time musical colleague and former radio co-host, Rick De Stefano, turned to me at rehearsal one day and asked if I would consider working for him. Now I’m an associate of the De Stefano Law Firm; we specialize in Real Estate litigation.\n\nFor about the same length of time, I have been a member of the Taos Lions Club; they’d been pressing me to join for years but when I learned that my Uncle Reinhard had been elected to the presidency of his Lions chapter in Klosterneuburg, Austria, I finally relented and now I’m on the board of directors. The coolest thing about our club is that we are the stewards of a 19th century flying-jenny carousel; we set it up and operate at various community events and the Abuelitos bring their Hitos to put ’em on the horses and tell us how they themselves rode it when they were their grandchildren’s age.\n\nOn Sundays I can be found at the audio-visual console on Santiago Lane as we broadcast the 10:30 am service from St. James Episcopal where my wife serves on the Vestry. Speaking of Janice, we will be celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary on the upcoming Summer Solstice. My brother Briton ’93 visited us this past August with his sons (10 & 12) and our mother Jeriann (like Julie Templin, not technically a KHS graduate) and her husband John Reeder. We (all the Kolber boys) rafted the Rio Grande, rode the Cumbres & Toltec scenic railroad and re-visited the original MeowWolf in Santa Fe. Janice and I, who are, both and each, childless do love the opportunity to have fun outings with our nephews but the best part about spending time with other people’s children is that you give them back at the end of the day especially after Uncle Mark has bought and enjoyed with them all the candy they can request.\n\nRobert Liddell: Hello, All! Here’s the news you’ve all been (not at all) wondering about: I’ve finally entered the parenthood game. Patricia Curran Liddell was born on May 29. I imagine all of your kids are in college or headed there at this point. But I’ve been late for everything since 6th grade advisory, so why should this be any different? Patricia is a happy little girl who inherited her father’s tendency to stay up too late. I couldn’t be prouder of her. Her mother Carly is a natural at this, and I just keep telling myself not to break the baby. If all continues to go well, I look forward to explaining to Patricia’s teachers one day soon that I am not, in fact, her grandfather. Otherwise, we live in the Heights, and I’m still teaching literature and medical humanities at the University of Houston.\n\nLynn Rothermel Neligan: Just wanted to share the news of my beautiful, sweet mother, Jane, passing away suddenly this summer. Mom always said Friday was her favorite day because it was her day for driving carpool in her Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser station wagon! She loved it, and we had so many huge laughs. Oh, how we miss her, but we are blessed with so many happy times.\n\nJennifer Deal Rogers: Well… life has been very busy for my husband, Joseph, and I for 21+ years and we are about to be empty-nesters! So crazy! Our oldest daughter, Mary Louise (named after my sweet mom!), is a junior at TCU. Our son, Will, is a freshman at Ole Miss. They are both LOVING college! Our youngest, Margaret, just got accepted to TCU for the Fall and we are so excited! As for me, I’m finally spending more time in Texas these days and connecting with our Kinkaid group and my UT friends more! It’s been so fun! I threw my Mary Louise a 21st birthday recently in Fort Worth and loved having Sarah Wheless Murrin ’90, Jennifer Pruitt Toomey ’90 and Lea Montgomery Payne join us for her party! Joseph and I will have some time on our hands soon when our kids all are gone … so sad to have them out of the house … but if any of you are in Atlanta - call me! We’d love to meet you for lunch or dinner!\n\nCriss Holloway Scruggs: Criss is enjoying life’s wild ride! Besides her work with BMC Software in Houston she’s very active with her husband, Richard, two girls – Samantha (18) enjoying her freshman year at The University of Alabama #RollTide and Ali (12) her 7th grader involved in almost every activity known! She moved just over a year ago to a new home (still in Katy, TX) to add room for her mother-in-law. And, she added two new four-legged family members – white lab, Ruger and black lab, Rett. She’s spent much of the last year traveling, managing household renovations and spending time with family and friends. Life is good, and she hopes everyone is doing well!\n\nBronwyn Burke Tilton: Bronwyn is still practicing law and is a partner at Litchfield Cavo LLP. The mid-life crisis puppy’s name is Birdie. Burke is a Sophomore at Sewanee, playing lacrosse as a goalie and Connor is a Senior at Memorial and a varsity lacrosse goalie along with Tricia Greenwood Hurley’s son.\n\nMe: Greer and I are enjoying year two of empty nest life. Year one was tough because my sweet dad, who most of you probably remember, passed away in February from complications from Alzheimers. But having all of the extra time to be with him was such a blessing. Thank you to so many of you who reached out - recalling days when he would drive us around blasting the Rolling Stones or Willie Nelson in the car, how he served up hot dogs every year at Field Day, how he made his famous “coffee milk” for us when I had sleepovers, and how he once gave some wise advice about life to some of our guys at a party. Thank you for sharing all of that with me! Other than that, empty nest life has been really fun. So far, I’ve taken up Mahjong and gardening, and we’re doing some traveling. Our son Charlie ’21 is in his sophomore year at Vanderbilt and loves it SO much. Fun ’89 connection is that he has become friends with Wendy and Michael Dalton’s daughter Bailey, who is a junior there. Vandy is just fabulous and Nashville is a blast. We love any chance we get to visit. This past summer it was a treat having him home - he was here to intern for Brad Deutser ’83 (Jill’s husband) at his amazing company, Deutser.\n\nWell, that’s all I’ve got for you this round. Thank you again to all who wrote in.

I’m trying to help their schools in Irvine, where we live, prepare them for learning how to learn.

Gulfshore Playhouse is about a year away from opening a new $67 million dollar theatre - which is right in my wheelhouse, having opened new theatres for The Kinkaid Theatre (now Katz Performing Arts Building), Signature Theatre, Arena Stage, and the renovated Alley Theatre. After only about a month here though, Hurricane Ian hit the area hard, but luckily, we were spared, though the Theatre construction did take a beating and is behind a bit. As you’ll recall, I’d only started at the Alley when Hurricane Harvey hit Houston and flooded the Alley. I’m hoping I’m not bringing the weather forces to all my new theatres! All in all, it’s been a great move and I look forward to visiting when I’m back in Houston sometime soon.”\n\nDeborah Vest Brown “is keeping up with life and her kids!
