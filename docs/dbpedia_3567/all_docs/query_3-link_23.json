        "text": "Time to leave San Teodoro and set off for Santa Teresa di Gallura, a town located in the northernmost part of Sardinia. In Santa Teresa, you can rent another exclusive villa with swimming pool in Sardinia, for the second week of your tour. Santa Teresa hosts tens of thousands of tourists during the high season. They visit it above all for the beaches of fine sand and to enjoy the superb landscapes offered by the stretch of sea between Sardinia and Corsica. From Santa Teresa, the view sweeps up to the white cliffs and buildings of Bonifacio, and on clearer days up to Cinto Mountain. The distance between Sardinia and Corsica in this stretch of coast is about 12 kilometres (7,5 miles).\n\nThe best-known beach is located only a few steps from the main square of the town: Rena Bianca, with fine white sand, and waters of various shades, awarded several times the Blue Flag. Part of Santa Teresa's territory is Capo Testa, a rocky promontory at the northernmost tip of Sardinia. It is known for its incredible hidden coves, fairy-looking granite rocks and for the legendary Valle della Luna, a haunt of hippies for decades, which recently even housed a colony of friendly goats. We suggest you spend at least half a day here: you will not be disappointed by the charm of this “magical” place. Bring your swimsuit with you, if you want to take a dip in the marvellous Cala Spinosa, but also comfortable shoes, suitable for walking on mountain paths.\n\nFrom your new base in Santa Teresa, you can easily reach Palau and the Maddalena archipelago in a few minutes by car: undoubtedly a naturalistic paradise. You can book a sailing or motor boat in exclusive, to better appreciate the wonders offered by these naturalistic pearls, which attract visitors from all over the world. Established in 1994, the Maddalena Archipelago National Park includes over 60 islands of various sizes and unparalleled beauty. Among the many noteworthy destinations, we point out the islands of Caprera, Budelli, Santa Maria, Santo Stefano, Razzoli and Spargi, as well as the mother island La Maddalena. On this island you can visit the town of the same name: the only inhabited centre of the archipelago. Among the paradisiacal beaches, we mention Bassa Trinita and Spalmatore. The archipelago is also of great historical importance, as the \"hero of two worlds\", Giuseppe Garibaldi spent the last years of his life in Caprera, where you can visit the house museum, Garibaldi.\n\nWe also suggest a stop by the pink beach of Budelli, which owes its typical colour from the sediments of a small organism, but on which there is a strict landing ban, to safeguard the fragile ecosystem of the island and the beach itself. The countless landing spots of the archipelago will amaze you with their incredible colours of the water and seabeds, framed by rocks shaped by the elements. During the day you may spot groups of dolphins having fun accompanying your boat with incredible jumps and tricks, and with a little luck, even encounter a loggerhead turtle. Spending a day in these diving paradises is a \"good for your soul experience\".\n\nLet's completely change the type of excursion. Still departing from Santa Teresa, we suggest you discover the countryside of Gallura, the most authentic part, so rich in traditions. Among the \"mandatory\" stops we mention Aggius and Tempio Pausania. In the territory of Aggius, take a short break on the panoramic terrace overlooking the inland Valle della Luna, not to be confused with the homonymous valley of Capo Testa. Here you will spot lots of granite massifs with anthropomorphic and animal features. Then continue toward the picturesque village Aggius, known for the beauty of the granite hills and for the authentic medieval town centre, which has been awarded the Orange flag of the Italian Touring Club. Furthermore, the village is known for the hand-woven traditional carpets, and for having hosted legendary Sardinian bandits, between which the so-called \"Muto di Gallura\". In order to better understand the particular historical period in which these notorious figures lived, you can even visit the Museum of Banditry.\n\nTime to head toward Tempio Pausania, a very important town in the hills. Enjoy a stroll in the old town, almost entirely made of local granite. The area is well known for the cork oak woods, a real local resource, and for the Vermentino di Gallura, an excellent white wine suitable for pairing with fish-based dishes. Tempio is also known throughout Sardinia for its carnival, which is deeply rooted and celebrated by all the inhabitants. The town hosted the Ligurian singer-songwriter Fabrizio De André and his family, who spent several years in the nearby Agnata estate and are still remembered today with great affection and nostalgia from the local population.\n\nWe suggest you discover the historic stone centre, the Cathedral and the granite squares, and enjoy the typical dishes in the local restaurants. One recipe above all: the Suppa Cuata, accompanied by a fruity Vermentino wine. If in the area you would like to discover something more about the majestic cone-shaped constructions, you can take part in a guided tour of one of the most important nuraghi of Gallura: the Nuraghe Majori.\n\nSpend the remaining days however you like, on the beach or by the pool, in order to be in shape and ready for your next move."
