I have stayed in nicer 3 star places.. Was basic and our friends had no tea or coffee Making facilities and had to request this from reception . They reluctantly supplied. Staff were mostly friendly but we were given wrong information about the harbour area and no information on planned pool fitness sessions. Breakfast was ok though got a bit repetitive for a week. Would have been nice to have fresh fruit juice….. Location is ok but chose the area for its harbour location. Despite being a busy harbour there are no restaurants, shops or facilities there due to the inaccessible location - we had to walk along a dual carriage way to get there and the town is not connected to the harbour . It’s a real shame as it could be lovely .\n\nShow more\n\n4.2/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserWe have been in Alghero so many times and in so many facilities and I can finally say I have found our place!! That's a good idea of check-in in autonomy, it doesn't bound you with the time of arrival. The room was perfect with the hydromassage that enriched it even more. Maximum cleaning and attention to the detail. Well heated. Large, bright. With a price suitable for the offer. The gentle staff, the cleaning woman with a cat's slippered step had already started cleaning the rooms and we didn't realize anything (other times we were woken badly by angerous noises of furniture and moved beds). Breakfast at the bar next to the hotel with pleasant and available staff.\n\nShow more\n\n4.1/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserThe hotel is located a few minutes by car from the centre and the beach. View of the spectacular sea that gives beautiful sunshine! Breakfast varies and for the last day they have prepared the extravagant as we were going early in the morning! The hotel is fullly reflecting the Sardian style, there are many lounges to use for relaxation; the evening is the musical accompanying! The only negative point is the pool sleeps a little too used, perhaps they should be replaced! A little “disconfortable” that to get to some rooms you need to take two different lifts and get a step in the middle...\n\nShow more\n\n4.1/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserWe have just come back from a week here. The room and all hotels area were always clean. The rooms are basic but are quite spacious. After one bad night due to the mattress I put a blanket down on the bed and the next day the housekeeper had put a mattress topper on the bed for us. It is located near bus stop into Alghero and the beach bus to beaches up the coast. All the staff were really friendly and most of them spoke english. My husband has coeliac disease, each morning at breakfast he was given a basket with gluten free cereal, bread, biscuits and offered croissants which were heated in the oven. At dinner the staff showed him what he could have and then gave him the option of having fresh gluten free pasta cooked so he could have the pasta dish. They also cooked meat separately if the sauce wasn't gluten free. We want to say a special thank you to Roberta and all the staff in the restaurant and kitchen for looking after him so well. We really appreciated the time Roberta spent with him each evening and translating to the other staff. We wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel and returning if we can.\n\nShow more"
