Here the architect Jacques Couëlle managed to recreate an oasis from \"Thousand and One Nights', which is particularly impressive for the design and special layout of the hotel bedrooms - they all have a panoramic view of the sea, yet they are barely visible from outside. The hotel lies on a bay of the same name, Cala di Volpe, at the southern end of the Pevero Golf Club golf course.\n\nCosta Smeralda | 07020 Porto Cervo\n\nNatural Reserve of Tavolara - Punta Coda Cavallo\n\nDo not miss an excursion to the islands of Tavolara and Molara. The island of Tavolara has the shape of a triangle, at the corner of which are Punta Timone, Punta del Papa (the cave once served as a hiding place for the Pope), Punta la Mandria and Coda di Terra. The nature reserve can be approached from Porto S. Paolo, depending on your preference, with large excursion boats or small motorboats (with or without a skipper). You can also go as part of an organised fishing boat excursion or as part of a diving excursion.\n\nTavolara\n\nStella Maris church\n\nThe small church above the Porto Cervo marina was designed in 1969 by the architect Michele Busiri Vici. With its dazzling white plaster and conically shaped bell tower, it is a prime example of the architectural style of the Costa Smeralda. This style is a reinterpretation of Mediterranean architecture specially designed for the Costa Smeralda in perfect harmony with the coastal landscape. The access road is located above the harbour and is signposted.\n\nPiazza Stella Maris, 1 | 07021 Porto Cervo\n\nTempio di Malchittu and Albucciu Nuraghe\n\nThis Bronze Age holy temple site is situated inside an extensive archaeological site. Here one can also see several burial sites, as well as the Albucciu nuraghe. Nuraghi are stone towers that are thousands of years old, built out of boulders weighing many tons, and found exclusively on Sardinia. Drive from Arzachena towards Olbia on the SS 125. After about 600m, drive into the car park on the left hand side at \"Nuraghe Albucciu\" and then follow the signs on foot.\n\nMalchittu | 07021 Arzachena\n\nGiants Tomb Coddu Vecchiu\n\nThe giant tombs are the largest pre-Nuragic cult sites in Sardinia. Like the great rock tombs, they are monuments of the ancient culture of the Nuragic civilization, the Bonnanaro culture. Coddu Vecchiu is one of the most impressive giant tombs from the Nuraghi period (1800-1600 BC). The actual tomb is almost 11 metres long. The central trench plate, which is over 4 metres high, is the largest one found in Sardinia. From Arzachena take the SS 427 towards Sant'Antonio di Gallura-Calangianus. After about 3 km turn right towards Luogosanto, continue for 1.8 km and then turn left towards Capichera. After a few hundred metres, park the car and walk on the right hand side of the road to the excavation site.\n\nLoc. Capichera | 07021 Arzachena\n\nCapo d’Orso and Roccia dell’Orso\n\nCapo d'Orso offers a fabulous panoramic view of the straits between the coast at Palau and the islands of La Maddalena, Caprera and Santo Stefano. The cape is named after its huge granite rocks shaped like a bear, the Roccia dell' Orso. Every year, thousands of visitors go on a pilgrimage to this rocky monument, formed by the wind and the weather. From Palau, follow the signs to the \"Roccia dell’Orso\". It is not recommended to climb up to the rock during the midday heat, as the climb is quite tiring. Children should be suitably keen on climbing, and remember to take enough to drink with you.\n\nCapo d'Orso, Loc. Le Saline | Palau\n\nTomba di Giganti di Li Lolghi\n\nThe overall structure of this almost 27 metre long mass grave is especially well preserved. Fifteen granite slabs were driven into the ground here several thousand years ago to form the boundary of this site to venerate the dead. Drive from Arzachena towards Bassacutena on the SP 115. After 4.5 km, turn left at the junction and drive some 2 km until you reach the excavations.\n\nLi Lolghi | Arzachena Olbia-Tempio\n\nCities and towns\n\nGolfo Aranci\n\nGolfo Aranci lies in front of Capo Figari and overlooks the Gulf of Olbia. From Golfo Aranci to Olbia stretches a low, regular coast with small bays and beaches with fine sand. One of the peculiarities of the village is the old fishermen's settlement by the sea, with the colourful little houses and fish shops, where you can buy fresh fish all year round. In the Via Libertà you can find many nice shops with handicrafts and typical products, especially during the summer months.\n\nPorto Rotondo\n\nThe luxury resort of Porto Rotondo and the marina of the same name (Porto Rotondo means \"round-shaped port\") were founded by two Venetians in 1963. Great importance was placed on the harmonious integration of the architecture with the rocky landscape. The town is picturesquely arranged around the sophisticated marina. Although Porto Rotondo no longer officially belongs to the Costa Smeralda district, there are almost as many VIPs among the villa owners as in Porto Cervo - Silvio Berlusconi among them, with his summer residence, Villa Certosa. As far as luxury boutiques, exclusive restaurants and clubs are concerned, there is no shortage.\n\nPorto Rotondo\n\nOlbia\n\nThe modern and lively town of Olbia was known as “the happy town” by the Greeks and is world famous for its close proximity to the Costa Smeralda. It stands on a wide natural gulf whose perimeter is defined by the splendid islands of Tavolara and Molara. The Costa Smeralda airport lies in this area and continues to record increasing numbers of tourists every year. San Simplicio is celebrated on the 15th of May every year with a solemn procession, fireworks, poetry contests and a large mussel festival. Events worthy of note in the summer are the “Week of International Folklore” with all kinds of musical, theatrical and film events and also the Feasts of the Madonna del Mare and San Giovanni Battista. Bados, Baia Corallina, Gavrile, La Peschiera, La Playa and Rena Bianca are some of the area's most beautiful beaches (sardegnaturismo.it).\n\nPorto Cervo\n\nPorto Cervo is a lively centre of the Costa Smeralda, the exclusive holiday coast is famous for the hustle and bustle of the rich and the international jet set since Aga Khan discovered this wild landmark in the 1960s. Large car parks, elegant shops and sophisticated scenery determine the townscape. A stroll to the harbour to admire the most beautiful yachts of the Mediterranean is compulsory.\n\nBaja Sardinia\n\nSheltered by a wide cove with crystal-clear water and ultrafine sand, Baja Sardinia is one of Gallura's most popular destinations for swimming and vacationing. It is a fantastic starting point for excursions by boat to the neighbouring island archipelago of Spargi, Budelli, La Maddalena as well as along the Costa Smeralda. The underwater world around nearby Capo Testa is one of the ten best diving areas in the world. The caves are shaped by gigantic granite boulders that are partly covered with red corals (corallium rubrum). The region of Gallura is also a paradise for cyclists because of the ups and downs of the narrow country roads where, all of a sudden, a view of the sea or a tiny country church appear out of nowhere. But Baja Sardinia also has plenty of nightlife. \"Ritual,\" one of the top 7 discos in Europe, and numerous piano bars as well as events with singing, dancing and shows on Baja Sardinia's Piazzetta provides plenty of entertainment during the high season.(sardegnaturismo.it)\n\nArzachena\n\nThe community's includes more than eighty kilometres of sea coast including the world-famous Costa Smeralda, rich with Mediterranean shrub, rocks modelled by nature and wonderful inlets and bays. In 1962, a small group of international entrepreneurs, headed by Prince Karim Aga Khan, set up the Costa Smeralda Consortium with the aim of developing tourism in the vast area of the Arzachena territory, comprising the present coastal band which stretches from Liscia Ruja to Liscia di Vacca. In this area a number of high-class structures were gradually built, attracting an elite kind of tourism. Visitors to the town will certainly be attracted by this clean and well cared for centre, full of green spaces and little squares. Its proximity to the Costa Smeralda means tourists can go shopping in the town centre not only for typical Sardinian products but also for luxury and sought-after goods. Archaeology: Lu Coddhu 'ecchju and Li Loghi giants’ tombs, Albucciu Nuraghe and Temple of Malchittu.\n\nMuseums\n\nMuseo etnografico e mineralogico paleontologico\n\nIn this museum, visitors can admire a large collection of minerals and fossils from Sardinia, as well as from other places around the world.
