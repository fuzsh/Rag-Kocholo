        "text": "Wondering where to stay in Sardinia? You’re in the right place. As a local I can tell you exactly where to spend your vacation.\n\nSardinia has been long regarded as one of the top beach holiday destinations, famous for its turquoise waters and soft powdery sands. It’s also one of the top surf spots in the Mediterranean.\n\nThat being said, there also are cities that are enthralling for entirely different reasons than the beach. There are artsy mountain towns, villages filled with vineyards, and ancient archaeological sites. While Iâll definitely cover the most popular areas to stay in Sardinia, Iâll also include a few you might not have thought of.\n\nHere, I will help you find the best places to stay in Sardinia for first timers, as well as where to stay in Sardinia for couples and the best hotels in Sardinia on the beach. Are you traveling to Sardinia with your family and kids? Don’t worry, I have options for you too!\n\nAre you ready to discover the best places to stay in Sardinia? Letâs go!\n\nWhere To Stay In Sardinia\n\nSOUTH SARDINIA\n\nCagliari – Where to stay in Sardinia for first timers\n\nCLOSEST AIRPORT – CAGLIARI ELMAS: 10.4 KM (6.4 MILES) – ABOUT 15 MINUTES DRIVE\n\nCagliari is one of the most underrated cities in Italy, and a perfect long weekend break especially in the shoulder season. I’d say, this is where to stay in Sardinia in October (but also in April or May), as is has literally the best of everything.\n\nCagliari is also one of the best places stay in Sardinia for first timers, as it allows you to get to know the local culture and history, the vibe, and try the best food the region has to offer.\n\nIndeed, there are museums, fantastic restaurants, local craft breweries, great shopping, and popular urban beaches, and from Cagliari you can reach many other destinations in South Sardinia on an easy day trip – whether by public transport or on a guided tour. This means that Cagliari is also where to stay in Sardinia without a car.\n\nOnce in Cagliari, you should also spend some time on Poetto Beach. The beach stretches all the way to Quartu Sant’Elena, the neighboring city, and has 9 km (about 5.6 miles) of fine, soft sand, and an amazing running and biking path. It’s also a popular surfing spot!\n\nIf you want to get a little hike in, Sella del Diavolo mountain only takes a couple of hours to tackle and surmounts Poetto Beach. The trailhead is just behind Calamosca Beach (Cagliari’s second urban beach). If youâre seeking a more remote spot, go to SantâElia beach, close to Sant’Elia stadium.\n\nBest boutique botel – Villa Fanny\n\nNicely located right outside the historic center of Cagliari at a stone’s throw from the many bars and restaurants of Stampace and close to the Roman Amphitheater and the Botanical Gardens, this hotel has beautifully designed rooms and features a fantastic gourmet restaurant.\n\nIt’s where to stay in Cagliari if you want something that is tucked away from the buzz of the historic center, but at the same time you want easy access to all the attractions and restaurants.\n\nBest luxury hotel – Palazzo Tirso\n\nThe recently opened Palazzo Tirso is quite the place to stay in Cagliari if you are looking for luxury and glamour, and one of the overall best places to stay in Sardinia.\n\nIts location in Piazza Deffenu, between Via Roma and the districts of Marina and Villanova, allows you to easily explore the city and reach all the best restaurants in town – unless you want to dine in one of its two gourmet (and delicious) restaurants: Cielo, on the terrace, and Terra, on the ground floor.\n\nThe modern, comfortable rooms all feature views, some of the bay, others of the Castello historic district.\n\nYou will also be able to enjoy a small pool at the terrace level, a wellness center and a spa.\n\nBest business hotel – UNAHOTELS T Hotel Cagliari\n\nCentrally located close to Teatro Lirico and in front of the lovely Parco della Musica, T Hotel is a favorite among business travelers and has spacious rooms, a luxe lounge bar, and a fantastic spa that locals also appreciate. The lounge bar at T Hotel makes some of the most delectable cocktails in the city!\n\nThe hotel has conference rooms too, which is great if you are traveling as a group with your business partners.\n\nIf you are renting a car for your Sardinia trip, T Hotel is a great option as it has its own private parking lot just across the street. There are also bus stops in the nearby Piazza Giovanni XXIII if you want to reach other areas of Cagliari to explore.\n\nBest budget-friendly hotel in Cagliari – Hostel Marina\n\nIf you are traveling to Sardinia on a budget, and if you want to stay in the very heart of Cagliari, Hostel Marina is the best option for you.\n\nThe hostel is right at the heart of La Marina district and one of the very few actual hostels in Sardinia. It is fun and friendly. This is a highly social hostel that hosts weekly events to keep the good times rolling. They are the kind of events that locals attend too, so it’s a great place if you want to be at the center of action.\n\nDormitories and private rooms are available. You will be close to all the bars, restaurants and cafÃ©s in the city, so it’s also one of the best places to stay in Sardinia for nightlife.\n\nBest hotel by the beach – Nautilus\n\nIf you are looking for one of the best hotels in Sardinia on the beach, but also want to stay in Cagliari, then Hotel Nautilus is the right choice – this is one of the best waterfront hotels in Cagliari, right on Poetto Beach – the main beach in Cagliari.\n\nThis hotel is literally on the beach: the moment you step out of the door, you can cross the street and step on the sand. Located along the beach there are nice local restaurants (my favorite is Le Palmette), beach clubs, gelaterie. There’s also a running and biking lane (the hotel offers bike rental) in case you want to exercise.\n\nThe hotel doesn’t have its own private parking, but there are plenty of spots nearby where you can park your car if you want. If you don’t have a car, you can hop on any P bus that will take you to the center of town.\n\nThe hotel has cozy rooms decorated in navy-style, some with a balcony and sea views. There’s a pool too.\n\nMy post The Best Apartments In Cagliari highlights the best self-catering options.\n\nVillasimius – Where to stay in Sardinia for beaches\n\nCLOSEST AIRPORT – CAGLIARI ELMAS: 67 KM (41.6 MILES) – ABOUT 1 HOUR AND 10 MINUTES DRIVE\n\nVillasimius is where to stay in Sardinia for beaches. The area of Villasimius also has some of the best diving sites on the island.\n\nThere are a bevy of beaches in Villasimius and some of the best beach resorts in Sardinia too. With its amazing, easily accessible beaches and shallow waters, Villasimius is also one of the best places to stay in Sardinia for families with kids.\n\nI recommend planning beach days at Punta Molentis and Porto Giunco, but you should also check out Campus, Porto sa Ruxi, and Campulongu beaches. Spiaggia del Riso beach is also very cool to visit: the sand here looks like rice!\n\nBehind some of the beaches youâll find marshes, salt pans, and flamingos! Capo Carbonara also has a wonderful hiking trail, and you can also hike to the Aragonese Tower of Porto Giunco for views.\n\nThe Villasimius Archaeological Museum is also a real treat to visit. It features an extensive exhibit on treasures found at the bottom of the sea, located in a beautifully restored 19th century building.\n\nBest luxury hotel – Hotel Simius Playa\n\nA beachfront hotel right on the shores of Simius Beach, rooms are gigantic and beautifully crafted. There is a swimming pool to enjoy and a spa to relax in. There is also a delicious restaurant and bar on-site!\n\nRooms are fairly classic in terms of decor, and not very big (unless you get a suite), but they are comfortable and have everything you need for a good stay. Some of them have a balcony and fantastic sea views. It’s definitely one of the best hotels in Villasimius!\n\nBest mid-range option – Domus Simius\n\nDomus Simius is a great mid-range option for your Sardinia holiday. You will be close to the center of Villasimius, and within easy driving distance from some of the best beaches in South Sardinia. In other words, staying here you will enjoy the best of both worlds!\n\nThe hotel has a spa, a gym and a bar, and a beautiful garden too. The spacious rooms are all very modern and comfortable. Some enjoy a partial view of the sea too.\n\nBest budget-friendly hotel – Arega B&B\n\nA great affordable option to stay in Villasimius. You will be in the center of town with immediate access to all the restaurants, bars and shops, and driving distance from the beaches – but the municipality runs a shuttle in case you don’t want to rent a car.\n\nThe breakfast is top-notch and varies daily; however, it is always served on the terrace that offers guests pleasant views. Rooms are plain, but comfortable.\n\nMy post The Best Holiday Rentals In Villasimius highlights the best self-catering places to stay in case you are looking for a place with a kitchen.\n\nCosta Rei – One of the best places to stay in Sardinia for families\n\nCLOSEST AIRPORT – CAGLIARI ELMAS: 66 KM (41 MILES) – ABOUT 1 HOUR AND 5 MINUTES DRIVE\n\nWith easy access to the beach and within one hour driving from Cagliari, Costa Rei is where to stay in Sardinia with kids, and for anyone in search of a gorgeous beach respite with all the comforts that the best holiday destinations in Sardinia have.\n\nThe main beach of Costa Rei is perfect if you don’t feel like driving – most places in Costa Rei are walking distance from the beach. But if you feel like exploring the area, check out Cala di Monte Turno, Cala Sinzias and Cala Pira beaches. Costa Rei is also close to Villasimius, in case you want to check out those beaches too.\n\nCosta Rei has grocery shops, restaurants, a few boutiques and lots of good restaurants to try (my favorites are Chaplin, an easygoing eatery, and Sa Cardiga e Su Pisci).\n\nMost people who decide to stay in Costa Rei opt to rent a holiday rental – many local families that have a holiday home here rent it out for the season (my parents use to do that too!). However, you will find some good camping sites and hotels in Costa Rei too.\n\nYou will have plenty of accommodation options with holiday homes and great resorts and camping sites, and plenty of good restaurants to try. Chaplin is my favorite!\n\nBest luxury hotel – La Villa del Re\n\nLa Villa del Re is not where to stay in Sardinia with family. In fact, I’d say this is one of the best places to stay in Sardinia for couples. This adults-only hotel is one of the best beachfront hotels in Sardinia, with direct access to a private beach.\n\nYou can pick between a classic room, a deluxe or a suite – rooms with views of the sea are a bit more expensive, but totally worth the splurge and the romance of waking up to see the sun rise!\n\nThe hotel has an outdoor pool, two restaurants (that observe a specific dress code) and a bar.\n\nBest mid-range hotel – Free Beach\n\nI don’t think I can even remember Costa Rei without the Free Beach. It’s always been there and I have been more times than I can remember.\n\nWith so many activities on offer for guests of all ages, the Free Beach in Costa Rei is where to stay in Sardinia with family. The large resort is located right in front of the beach, and you will have direct access to it.\n\nThere is an outdoor pool and a spa, tennis courts, a restaurant and a bar, and a private beach for all guests. If you are driving, the hotel also has a reserved parking space for guests.\n\nThe staff at the reception will be available to help you plan your daily activities, including boat tours along the coast. And if you are traveling with your pet, you’ll be glad to know that Free Beach is pet-friendly.\n\nBest budget-friendly hotel – Albaruja Hotel\n\nOne of the best known hotels in Costa Rei, Alba Ruja is within easy walking distance from the beach and close to shops and restaurants too. Rooms are spacious, there is a desk to ask for information, and breakfast is delicious. Guests also have a dedicated parking lot.\n\nPula, Santa Margherita di Pula and Chia – Great beaches and archeology\n\nCLOSEST AIRPORT – CAGLIARI ELMAS: 38 KM (23.6 miles) FROM PULA – ABOUT 40 MINUTES DRIVE\n\nPula is about 35 kilometers (21.7 miles) southwest of Cagliari.\n\nItâs a popular place to stay in Sardinia because it provides easy access to one of the most impressive archeological sites in Sardiniaâ the ancient city of Nora, the first Phoenician town in Sardinia dating back to the 8th century BC but also a stratified site with impressive Roman ruins.\n\nIn terms of beaches, you will have direct access to the beach in Santa Margherita di Pula, but there are also Nora and all the beaches in Chia to check out. Su Giudeu is popular for kitesurfing and windsurfing, and a great clear waters and white sand beach about 15 minutes drive from Pula.\n\nThere also is a fantastic forest to explore, filled with holm oaks and pine trees, including Is Cannoneris and Pixinamanna. There are well-marked hiking trails around the area, too.\n\nBest Luxury Hotel – Forte Village Resort\n\nForte Village is a magnificent resort right on the beachfront. It has 21 restaurants inside! Looking to scuba dive? Play tennis? How about boxing? The sports facility can accommodate all your athletic whims!\n\nWith so many activities on offer (other than easily accessible private beach) this is a great place to stay if you are traveling with your family. If youâre seeking a lavish stay in Santa Margherita di Pula, this is undoubtedly the place to be.\n\nBest boutique – Hotel Faro Capo Spartivento\n\nLocated in the stunning location of Capo Spartivento and providing easy access to both Chia Su Giudeu Beach and Cala Cipolla, the boutique hotel Faro Capo Spartivento provides gorgeous rooms with direct views of the sea – which make it one of the best places to stay in Sardinia for couples – and even family rooms.\n\nIt’s actually set in a former lighthouse!\n\nThe hotel has a fabulous infinity pool perfect for sipping a sunset cocktail, a garden and a delicious restaurant. From here, you can directly access the hiking trails that will take you to other lesser known beaches such as Perda Longa and Cala Antoniareddu.\n\nBest budget-friendly hotel – BB 1987 Pula\n\nThis bed and breakfast is located in Pula, just a quick 15-minute walk from Spiaggia dei Fichi, a delightful beach lined with fig trees, and at easy driving distance from the ancient town of Nora and the lovely Nora beach!\n\nThe rooms are cozy and clean, and the breakfast is terrific, filled with locally-sourced or home-made dishes.\n\nCarloforte – One of the most unique places to stay in Sardinia\n\nCLOSEST AIRPORT – CAGLIARI ELMAS: 86 KM (53.4 MILES) – ABOUT 2 HOURS BETWEEN CAR RIDE AND FERRY\n\nCarloforte lies on the southwestern coast of Sardinia on the Isola di San Pietro, approximately seven kilometers (4.3 miles) off the mainland of Sardinia! This is where to stay in Sardinia if youâre looking for a chic, unique and lesser known (to foreigners) destination.\n\nCarloforte has a population of roughly 6,000 people, so it has a lively community. There is a watchtower, old stone walls, and the iconic Lion’s Gate to visit. Often lauded as having some of the most beautiful architecture in Sardinia, Carloforte is a real beauty. And the beaches of San Pietro Island are stunning!\n\nMany people who opt to stay in Carloforte stay at one of the holiday rentals closer to the beaches, but I recommend staying in Carloforte for easy access to all the restaurants (my favorite is Da Andrea) and nightlife in town.\n\nMake sure to read my post A Complete Guide To Carloforte And Isola Di San Pietro, Sardinia for more in-depth information on places to visit, beaches and activities in San Pietro Island.\n\nBest mid-range hotel – Aquamadre Suites\n\nAquamadre suites is mere steps away from the Spiaggia di Dietro ai Forni beach, while at the same time conveniently located close to the town center. You’ll be able to park your car (for free) in the streets near the hotel.\n\nThis guesthouse is straight out of a dream. Its pristine white rooms boast harmonious, soothing dÃ©cor, and youâre sure to have a great stay here.\n\nBest overall hotel – Nichotel\n\nNichotel is my favorite place to stay in Carloforte, and where I normally opt to stay whenever I am in town. Located in the heart of town, right by the waterfront, you can easily access all the attractions in Carloforte and you will be around a 7-minute drive from La Bobba Beach, and just under 15 minutes from La Caletta.\n\nRooms here are spacious and cozy, equipped with anything you may need for a wonderful stay. A delicious breakfast is served every morning.\n\nWESTERN SARDINIA\n\nOristano – A lesser known city in Sardinia\n\nCLOSEST AIRPORT – CAGLIARI ELMAS: 93 KM (57.7 MILES) – ABOUT 1 HOUR AND 15 MINUTES DRIVE\n\nOristano, in central-western Sardinia, is an elegant place to stay, with handsome architecture, museums, churches, and art. It’s where to stay in Sardinia if you wish to go a bit off-the-beaten path.\n\nThe area around Oristano has incredible natural beauty, especially the lagoons of Cabras and Santa Giusta. Staying in Oristano you will also be able to access the Sinis Peninsula, home to Is Arutas and Mari Ermi (among the best beaches in Sardinia) and the archeological ruins of Tharros.\n\nThe province of Oristano also is home to some incredible wineries that are well worth visiting, such as Contini, lauded for its Vernaccia di Oristano white wine. Stop by the Cantina della Vernaccia, located in downtown Oristano, to sample a wide variety of local wines!\n\nThe historic center is brimming with charm. You will want to visit the Chiesa di San Francesco, the Duomo Cathedral, and snap a photo of Queen Eleonoraâs Statue.\n\nFinally, Oristano is a fantastic destination during Carnival season, as the city hosts the adrenaline-filled Sartiglia, one of the island’s most famous festivals.\n\nBest mid-range hotel – Hotel II Duomo\n\nInside an ancient noble house dating back to the 17th century, this hotel is in the heart of Oristano’s historical center, in front of the magnificent cathedral.\n\nFrom the hotel, you will have easy access to all the city’s attractions and the best restaurants (I love Kraf Da Banana). However, keep in mind that the hotel has no reserved parking and you’ll have to find parking in one of the streets near the hotel.\n\nBest budget-friendly hotel – Mariano Palace\n\nThis budget-friendly hotel is a convenient base for visiting Oristano, and an overall excellent place to stay.\n\nWhile it could certainly do with a bit of refurbishment, the location is fantastic (right in the center of Oristano, and with plenty of spots nearby where you can park your car). The hotel has a bar, there’s a massive breakfast buffet, and the staff is as kind as it gets.\n\nNORTH-WEST SARDINIA\n\nAlghero – One of the best places to stay in Sardinia without a car\n\nCLOSEST AIRPORT: ALGHERO FERTILIA: 10 KM (6.2 MILES) – ABOUT 20 MINUTES DRIVE\n\nAlghero is one of the most exquisite cities in northwestern Sardinia, and where to stay in Sardinia if you’re looking to pair time on the beach with seeing historical sites, while at the same time you prefer not driving.\n\nIn fact, the historic center is vibrant and lively. Itâs also chock full of boutiques, restaurants, cafes, and bars – and the convenient public bus network makes it easy to reach nearby places too.\n\nDuring your trip to Alghero, make sure to walk along the bastions and visit San Francesco church and climb its bell tower, as well as its Santa Maria Cathedral. There are quite a few towers to explore – the Torre di San Giacomo, the Torre Della Polveriera, and the Torre di SantâElmo.\n\nHead out of town to visit Neptune’s Caves and Porto Conte Nature Park, Nuraghe Palmavera, and to spend time at one of the many Alghero beaches such as Le Bombarde.\n\nOn the hunt for some fantastic seafood? I recommend dining at Nautilus, one of the best restaurants in Alghero (and a bit of a splurge).\n\nBest boutique hotel – Casa Villamarina\n\nThis is definitely one of the best hotels in Alghero. During your stay, you will be immersed in the gorgeous countryside, surrounded by the vineyards of Sella e Mosca, one of the best wineries in Sardinia.\n\nRooms at this hotel are all different, but all equally beautiful and comfortable. A generous breakfast is served every morning, with an abundance of locally freshly baked goods.\n\nBest budget-friendly hotel – Hotel Angedras\n\nThis affordable hotel is situated just a few blocks away from the historic old town. You’ll also be within easy distance from the nearest beach.\n\nWith Sardinian-styled furnishings and decor, all rooms almost seem to sparkle – each coming with its own private balcony, the perfect spot for sipping your morning cup of coffee. A generous buffet breakfast is served daily.\n\nIf you are looking for self-catering accommodation, you should read my post The Best Holiday Rentals In Alghero.\n\nSassari – A lesser visited destination\n\nCLOSEST AIRPORT – ALGHERO FERTILIA: 30 KM (18.6 MILES) – 30 MINUTES DRIVE\n\nSassari, in the northwest of Sardinia, is the second-largest city on the island, and one of the island’s oldest settlements, with archaeological findings dating back to the Neolithic age. If you’re a history lover or an architecture aficionado, this is where to stay in Sardinia.\n\nPiazza d’Italia is the heart of the historic Old Town and is filled with dazzling structures, including the Palazzo Giordano and the Palazzo della Provincia. The Cathedral of Saint Nicolas took over 500 years to complete, between the 12th century and the 18th century.\n\nOn the western outskirts of the Old Town, you’ll find the Church of Santa Maria di Betlem, with a stunningly ornate basilica dome. The Basilica di Saccargia, just southeast of Sassari, is a striped church made entirely out of local stone and one of the prettiest churches in Sardinia.\n\nBest mid-range hotel – Cafe Bleu Relais\n\nThis picturesque boutique hotel in Sassari will exceed all your expectations. You will find great attention given to every detail, and spacious comfortable rooms. Youâll be just three blocks away from the Emiciclo Garibaldi, and right next door to the fantastic CaffÃ© Fontana Bistrot cafe and bar!\n\nFor a small additional fee, the hotel also offers a parking spot near the hotel.\n\nBest overall hotel – Carlo Felice\n\nThis excellent hotel is located outside the center of Sassari (which you can easily reach by bus), so it is perfect if you need a place that allows you to get in and out of the city easily (there’s parking available on the site). I have stayed there on my most recent trips to Sassari and both times found it to be an excellent option.\n\nRooms are quite plain, but spotless and comfortable. An excellent buffet breakfast is served every morning and there is an on-site restaurant for dinner, but you can also walk to the nearby Re | Mi for one of the best pizzas in town. It’s actually great value for money.\n\nStintino – One of the best places to stay in Sardinia for beaches\n\nCLOSEST AIRPORT – ALGHERO FERTILIA: 48 KM (29.8 MILES) – 48 MINUTES DRIVE\n\nStintino is a quaint fishing village on the northwestern coast of the island. With a population of 1,600 people, it is situated north of Alghero, and it is calm and peaceful. Itâs where to stay in Sardinia to have easy access to stunning beaches.\n\nLa Pelosa Beach is the most popular beach in Stintino and lies directly in front of the remote island of Asinara (which you can reach on a quick boat ride from Stintino).\n\nAnother beautiful beach is Le Saline, with its crystal-clear turquoise waters. Ezzi Mannu beach is made of tiny pebbles and surrounded by Mediterranean scrub and lush vegetation. Lastly, Tamarisk Beach is by far the least crowded.\n\nBest bed and breakfast – Mare di Fuori\n\nThis nice bed and breakfast is one of the most convenient places to stay in Stintino. You will be right in the center of town, and about 6 minutes drive from La Pelosa beach, with other beaches also within easy driving distance.\n\nRooms are cozy and comfortable, and you won’t have troubles finding a parking spot along one of the nearby streets.\n\nBest rooms with a view – A. Mare\n\nThis wonderful small guest house in Stintino is an easy walk to the nearest beach and offers spacious, comfortable and newly refurbished rooms, all of them with access to a terrace and wonderful views of the sea.\n\nParking is easily available in the street right outside the small guest house, where breakfast is also available for guests.\n\nCastelsardo – For stunning views\n\nCLOSEST AIRPORT – ALGHERO FERTILIA: 65 KM (40.3 MILES) – 1 HOUR DRIVE\n\nLocated in the northwest of Sardinia, in the province of Sassari, Castelsardo is fortified town brimming with culture and history, and where to stay in Sardinia if you want to soak up the essence of its history.\n\nCastelsardo’s nucleus is the Doria Castle, perched on a hill above the city.

My favorite is Oasi Bidderosa, a series of small coves that are protected and as such never crowded. But you can also go to Cala Liberotto, Capo Comino and Berchida.\n\nInside the town there are 13 churches to visit and a medieval castle to see. Expect to wander through cobblestoned streets and be surrounded by charming old houses.\n\nOliena is where to stay in Sardinia in October.

Each August, the Rocce Rosse Blues music festival is held in TortolÃ¬.\n\nSanta Maria Navarrese used to be beach hamlet of Baunei, which is located further up the hill, but with time it became a small town proper.

Parking is available on the premises too.\n\nBest mid-range hotel – La Bitta\n\nSet right on Porto Is Frailis beach (a short distance from TortolÃ¬) and with direct access to a small, private and gorgeous beach, La Bitta features comfortable rooms.\n\nIt’s an overall excellent place to stay for your Sardinia holiday, and it’s often booked up. If you can’t find a room there, make sure to at least plan to dine at the on-site restaurant. The food is absolutely mouthwatering!\n\nBest budget-friendly hotel – Lungomare Bed Rooms\n\nSteps away from Santa Maria Navarrese beach, the town center and the tourist harbor where boat tours depart from, Lungomare Bed Rooms is an excellent place to stay for travelers on a smaller budget.\n\nRooms are on the small side, and there aren’t many services for guests – but you will have everything you need for a comfortable stay.
