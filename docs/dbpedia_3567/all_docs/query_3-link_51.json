        "text": "Nordic Series 18: Otepää\n\nPleasingly, having persisted with Cronoescalada through the period that Google have been being the colossal money-grubs that they are, we are now at a decent compromise, where the OSM Builder has been retooled to work with the parameters of the beta for the new Cronoescalada builder that had been in testing prior to Google taking maps off the menu; now, however, Google maps' terrain view and satellite view are both available as viewing options both while mapping and viewing profiles. Some of the functionality remains limited - manual routing is still unfortunately not possible - but compared to the situation we thought we were in, which would have likely killed this long-standing megathread with Google pulling its content from all of the main mapping software, this is clearly a much better development.\n\nAs a bit of a test of it, therefore, I thought I'd do a brief Nordic Series post in one of the ways it was originally designed to function but that I've not yet done a post reflecting, which is that many of the venues in countries that don't have the same access to sizable mountains and mountain ranges will not have the same versatility in terms of prospective stage options that, say, Lenzerheide or Val di Fiemme have; being in predominantly flat terrain, therefore, in order to produce selective skiing, the venues are often placed with a number of smaller or larger hills by skiing standards, which can produce selectivity in the form of an up-and-down-all-day-on-small-climbs type of race such as the 1980 Olympics course on the Krylatskoye Ring, or the Melilla circuit used in the 1997 Spanish national championships. Such options can often only produce one viable cycling route, but seeing as there's a strong history of using other sports' - especially motorsport's - courses in cycling (the World Championships have been held at the Nürburgring, the Sachsenring, the Masaryk-Ring and the Circuito de Lasarte-Oria, and on courses incorporating parts of Zandvoort, Zolder, Mallory Park, Goodwood, Montjuïc Park Street Circuit, Imola and Reims-Gueux; the Copa América de Ciclismo takes place regularly at Interlagos; Rad am Ring held a pro race a couple of years ago; the Circuito de Navarra, Valencia Street Circuit and Motorland Aragón have hosted the Vuelta in recent years; the Volta a Catalunya used to end with several laps of Montmelo; the Tour of Utah held a TTT at Miller Motorsport Park and the Tour of California has introduced that Laguna Seca finish successfully), and often for training purposes in the summer the paths used in Nordic skiing are tarmacked for the purpose of rollerskiing, you can definitely get some interesting potential courses out of these.\n\nThe first such course I have looked at is the Tehvandi Stadion at Otepää, Estonia.\n\nThe reason I have selected this one is that, unlike many, it doesn't have to be restricted to a 4km circuit, which we know is far too short for a cycling circuit race, within the confines of the ski facility itself, because you can access the trails from public roads at a couple of places, enabling the riders to enter and exit the trails of the facility via actual roads (you can see in the bottom right a road at 45º from the car park leading into the section that looks like an athletics stadium and has the tribune). The other beneficial thing about Tehvandi is that it has an unusual and almost unique configuration in that it is used to host both cross-country skiing and biathlon, but has separate adjacent stadia for each - the XC stadium portion is reappropriated for football (soccer) in the summer, meaning they had to build the shooting range for the biathlon stadium at the far end of the stadium, necessitating further tribunes to watch the biathlon. This puts it in contrast to Lahti, which laid down a temporary shooting range - however as Otepää is the premier biathlon facility in Estonia, whereas Lahti was a temporary solution in the World Cup with the sport being homed in Kontiolahti in Finland, having a biathlon facility where you couldn't practice shooting in the off-season was considered a terrible idea. This does mean, however, that there's a long enough straight to have a safe sprint on bikes!\n\nOtepää has long been considered Estonia's winter capital, and of course the winter has been an evocative part of the country's tradition - in fact it is considered the source of the country's flag - and while of course independent Estonia, save for a short period after the Russian Revolution, has a pretty short history, its limited Olympic success has been dominated by the cross-country skiers the country has been able to generate. In fact, 100% of the country's Winter Olympic medals have been achieved in the sport of cross-country skiing, by far the most since the country returned to the Olympics after achieving its independence (the country has more medals in wrestling at the Summer Olympics, but all of these were won in the 1920s and 1930s, before the country's absorption into the USSR).\n\nChief among these medals is Kristina Šmigun (later Šmigun-Vähi). Active from 1993-2010, with a two year break for parenthood in the latter part of that, Šmigun was winning races from the late 1990s when she was in her early 20s, winning two overall titles in the World Cup for distance classes at that point in her career as well as a silver and a bronze in the 1999 Nordic World Championships. She never managed to win in front of her home fans in Otepää but in 2003 at Val di Fiemme, she took a gold in the World Championships in the double pursuit (now replaced by skiathlon which itself seems to be being replaced by a return to the double pursuit), two silvers (in the 10km classic individual start and the 15km classic mass start) and a bronze (in the 30km free). After 2004 the podiums started to become less frequent, but she countered this by winning big when it counted, taking gold in the 15km double pursuit and the 10km individual start classic at the Torino Olympics. After returning in late 2009 following her break from the sport, she then raised some eyebrows with an unexpected silver medal in Vancouver, having only managed one podium all season. She retired to focus on her family after taking a second baby break after the 2009-10 season and, at 33, not feeling the prospects for a return to the top level after a further year or two's absence were that great.\n\nOf course, the fact she was later investigated by anti-doping authorities didn't help and may have influenced that decision.\n\nHer achievements are matched, and some would argue bettered, by Andrus Veerpalu, however. A significant late bloomer, almost all of Veerpalu's relevant achievements come after the age of 30, which especially given the era he was competing in lend an air of controversy to him. Like Šmigun, he has three Olympic medals - two gold and one silver, the former achieved in the 15km classic at consecutive Games, Salt Lake City 2002 and Torino 2006 (meaning although his achievements mainly predate hers, Šmigun got her second gold medal before him), and the latter in the 50km classic at Salt Lake City, upgraded from the original bronze after the disqualification of Johann Mühlegg. Like Šmigun, he is also a World Champion - but unlike Šmigun, he has two gold medals from the World Championships - one in the 30km classic at the controversial 2001 Lahti Games, and one in Liberec in 2009, whereby at the age of 38 he became the oldest World Champion of all time in the sport. He retired shortly after his 40th birthday, before a few months later a protracted case began in which he was accused of doping with HGH, appealing first to FIS (who increased his ban to three years) and then CAS (who acquitted him) in what became a landmark case.\n\nThe final cross-country medal won by the Estonians was Jaak Mäe, who originally finished 4th in the 50km at the Salt Lake City games but inherited bronze after the disqualification of Mühlegg.\n\nSince the retirements of their great medal hopes, however, the Estonians have been a pretty peripheral name in the Nordic sports, despite it being one of the nation's great passions. Despite a brief flurry of decent if unspectacular results centred around Eveli Saue, and a number of very strong junior performances from the likes of René Zahkna and Tuuli Tomingas, the inability to compete with the big nations funding-wise has hamstrung the Estonians in biathlon as junior standouts are unable to make the same progress as opposition and many talented young Estonians have retired young - Daria Yurlova and Daniil Steptšenko most notably, who retired at 23 and 25 respectively. There is, however, the Nordic Combined star Kristjan Ilves, who has made solid progress in that most maligned of sports to achieve some level of prominence - there is also a ski jump at Otepää which is built around part of the trails, also enabling a pretty decent sized climb to be incorporated into the course. The Otepää facility is used throughout the summer for rollerskiing, triathlons, duathlons and similar, so it can handle the use of bikes as well as having hosted the summer World Championships in biathlon as well.\n\nEstonia is a mainly flat country, which has hampered its value as a host in pro cycling races. The former Tallinn-Tartu GP and GP Tartu have been combined into a short Tour of Estonia stage race, but these are essentially flat, and focus on a number of small but not especially consequential rises. The Tartu GP course has also been used for the European Cycling Championships, before they became open entry, as it was a huge surprise on such a flat-to-rolling course for Kasia Niewiadoma to win the U23 women's race. You can see the course here as this is the highlights from a Tour of Estonia stage on the Tartu circuit.\n\nI really enjoyed Estonia when I visited there and have always thought about doing a Tour of Estonia for this thread that is a bit more all-encompassing than a two day race which only really involves two cities. The country has some pretty good cycling history, more than you might expect from a country as flat as it is, and as small as it is. It of course gave the USSR one of its most legendary cyclists, the great Aavo Pikkuus, but the 1980s also saw further successful Estonians in places of prominence in the USSR's cycling scene, most notably master rouleur and hardman (and surprise winner of the Tour of Yugoslavia) Riho Suun, who later had the chance to turn professional and joined Kelme, and track sprinter/time triallist Erika Salumäe, who won multiple Olympic and World Championship medals for the Soviet Union, before in Barcelona 1992 becoming the first, and to date only, woman to win a Summer Olympic gold for Estonia. Since independence they have produced a disproportionate number of strong riders, from tragic victim of a drunk driver Lauri Aus to pretty strong stage racers with mountain climbing credentials that can't have been learnt on home roads, such as Astana mountain domestique Tanel Kangert, winner of the Abu Dhabi Tour, top 10 at the Olympics and with 5 GT top 20s spread across all three of the sport's biggest races, and Tour and Vuelta stage winner Rein Taaramäe, who has won a few short stage races in mountainous terrain, most notably the Tour de Slovénie and the Vuelta's main warm-up race, the Vuelta a Burgos. Chief among them, however, is somebody who is better known for the kind of road cycling you might expect from somebody from a country with terrain like Estonia - the mighty sprinter Jaan Kirsipuu, who won four Tour de France stages and wore the maillot jaune back in 1999, among over 100 professional victories. As a hardman who liked rough surfaces, he also won the Tro Bro Léon, and some of the less challenging semi-classics and one-day races in France and Belgium, most notably Kuurne-Bruxelles-Kuurne. He stayed in business until 2012, retiring at 43 after four years of racing on the UCI Asia Tour once his speed was no longer enough to keep him involved in the European péloton. And he stayed loyal to Champion System in their doomed attempt at becoming a competitive ProContinental team - even when they completely failed to figure out the Estonian flag:\n\nThe main way to make a Tour of Estonia selective, even if it may still be suited to the Kirsipuus of this world, is to utilise the many, many kilometres of dirt roads, none of which are used in the real-life race. I attempted to utilise this with my GP Aavo Pikkuus, which I posted here. For the record, in an attempt to keep tradition while alive, my idea for a Tour of Estonia was:\n\n1) Pärnu - Otepää ending with a bumpy circuit at the skiing venue\n\n2) Otepää - Võru along similar lines to the GP Aavo Pikkuus\n\n3) Tartu - Tartu along similar lines to the GP Tartu\n\n4) Narva - Paldiski along the coast\n\n5) Tallinn ITT to finish\n\nAnyway, that's even more fantasy than this, so let's continue by looking at the course within the actual stadium.\n\nThe course profile of the 'long course' at Otepää\n\nAs you can see, the course is far from flat, looping around the small hills and ridges of this part of Estonia, which is otherwise a very flat country and difficult to produce similarly selective courses over a point-to-point race. The loops around the Otepää stadium account for the first part of the stage, deviating at around the summit of the gradual climb at 4250m. The climbs of this section are:\n\n- 300m at 7,6%\n\n- 400m at 8%\n\n- 475m at 11,8%\n\n- 800m at 5,5%\n\nPretty neat, huh?\n\nProposal #1: GP Otepää\n\nThis is my way to get an interesting course out of the Otepää ski stadium. For a bit of an idea of the course, you can watch this video which the IBU posted ahead of the Summer World Championships there, with local competitor Grete Gaim showing us around. She only does the 2,5km course there, however, so for example where she breaks right at 3:20 we would go left, as the shortcut she takes cuts off the start of the toughest climb of the course. I believe from previous skiing viewing that the steepest that climb goes is 18% but I can't find a more detailed graphic to confirm. We also break left where Gaim heads right at 5:40, which continues to climb up to the back of the ski jump, returning to that roundabout-type bit and swinging left at the turn she passes at 5:53, as this is the route that takes us down to the main road. The route around the stadium is this:\n\nThe Start-und-Ziel should be at the bottom of the straight underneath the biathlon range, before the 180º lefthander using the edge of the penalty loop. If it isn't considered safe enough to put the finish in the stadium, they can either finish the course on the main road just outside the stadium, and then enter the gates after a 90º left at the end of the stadium section and then a second 90º will take you past the front of the range where we rejoin the course; the second option is that instead of the 45º left to enter the stadium then the 45º right, we can take the full right that takes us to the Tehvandi Stadium car park, put the finish there, and then go past the sports hotel and enter the ski trails by going over the bridge that Grete goes under at 1:23 in the video above and joining the trails where she merges with the other route at 1:45. You can see from the end of the video when she re-enters the stadium section that there's plenty of space, however.\n\nSo anyway - I've given you a detailed guide to the 4km of the stage which are spent on the XC stadium tracks, but they're only the first part of the circuit, because the finish comes immediately after entering the stadium. So what are they doing for the rest of the circuit, as you'll no doubt have noticed that the circuit is 13,4km in length?\n\nWell, first, there's a long straight, then a technical left-right before another straight past the gymnasium. After a left-hand turn, it's a rolling downhill for about 3km to the Pühajärve spa and resort. The riders appear on that photograph on the left hand side, before taking the right hand turn right in front of the resort to head northwards, which is the road at the bottom of the picture. You might notice it's a different colour from the main road that passes past the spa - this is for a very good reason; here's a picture of what it looks like a bit further down the road:\n\nYep - some serious sterrato on this circuit. The length of the sterrato stretch is 2250m - so it accounts for about 1/6 of the circuit's duration. This comes to a conclusion two and a half kilometres from the end of the circuit, and also the sterrato is the flattest part of the circuit too. After that it's a mostly very straight run-in, with only one wide right-hander before the left hand - right hand kink as they move from the main road and into the stadium, which would come just over 200m to go because I'd look to put the stage finish in front of the biathlon range to increase the safety of the sprint.\n\nThe circuit lasting for 13,4km means that for my GP Otepää there would be 15 times around the circuit, which would result in a race of just over 200km. I think this would be best located either as a stage of the Tour of Estonia, or preferably in a format like my proposed Tour of Estonia above - maybe 100km or so lead-in before five circuits of the course here in Otepää would work within a stage race (yields just under 167km duration, perfect for a 2.1 stage race). For a Continental or World Championships - and let's not forget that Estonia does have some illustrious cycling history - there would need to be 20 circuits, I believe, which would total 268km, a decent length. And when was the last time we saw a World Championships course including some dirt? The French nationals were up in Tro Bro Léon terrain a few years ago and included some ribin, and then there were of course some cobbles in the Richmond Worlds, so why not?\n\nI did not looked at last things posted here but judging by the load times LS did at least one nordic series entry.\n\nThe title of this classic is in Google Translate Spanish so it's most probably bad. Sorry, i only know a couple of words in Spanish. I also didn't check up if someone here had done this before to limit the chances of ripping off someone (most probably LS).\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/259868\n\nCaminos de adoquines(?) de Provincia de Ávila. Las Navas del Marqués – Las Navas del Marqués, 185km, medium mountain + cobbles.\n\nClimbs:\n\nAlto de Robledondo – 7km, 5,4%, 1408m\n\nAlto de Santa María de la Alameda – 4,4km, 6,1%, 1427m\n\nPuerto de Arrebatacapas x2 – 11,8km, 4,1%, 1125m\n\nMuro de las Eras x2 – 2,5km, 8,6%, 1231m\n\nCobbles:\n\nLas Navas del Marqués – 200m, **\n\nEl Hoyo de Pinares x2 – 1100m, *\n\nCebreros x2 – 500m, *\n\nSan Bartolomé de Pinares x2 – 500m, **\n\nI still have 3-4 stages of my Giro to write and these are the hardest ones so it will take some time. I guess i'll either end it at the end of this month or quite early during the next one. To sweeten up your waiting i've decided to publish a Fall... no, not this one. This RVV wanabee in the province of Ávila that doesn't include the cobbles of Ávila (or the city itself). This potential classic was created to give some Spanish flahutes some prep for a potential showing at RVV, P-R or other cobbles-heavy classics. Because of that i guess i would put it in the 2nd half of March.\n\nCastillo Magalia, Las Navas del Marqués.\n\nMore historic Spanish towns often have cobbled streets within their downtowns but not that often they're classic belgian-style cobbles. As for the region of Ávila you have the well known cobbles in the capital and El Tiemblo at the bottom of Puerto de la Paramera. I've managed to find 4 additional cobbled climbs in neighboring communes of Las Navas del Marqués, El Hoyo de Pinares, Cebreros and San Bartolomé de Pinares.\n\nErmita del Santo Cristo, San Bartolomé de Pinares.\n\nThis stage is more of a first draft. It definitely could have been better. I've deemed Ávila to be too far away and El Tiemblo to be too easy to do some of the Belgian classics ridiculousnes. The stage is still quite complicated and it could be more if i included smaller laps mid-laps around San Bartolomé de Pinares. The stage also features some amount of the Madrid region (El Pimpollar, Puerto de la Pardilla, Robledondo and Santa María de la Alameda) during the first lap around Las Navas del Marqués. The rest of this stage is composed of two 76km laps that include 3 cobbled sectors. The first lap is specifically designed to house the first hellinge of the race – a 200m section at Plaza Convento and Calle Rosario at the eastern end of the town, in front of Castillo Magalia. It leads to the hitop Convento de Santo Domingo y San Pablo at the northeastern end of the town. These 200m are at roughly 6%.\n\nCobbles in Las Navas del Marqués.\n\nBefore Las Navas del Marqués the race visits the region of Madrid (Comunidad de Madrid) for two similar to each other climbs – Alto de Robledondo just above Puerto de la Pardilla and Alto de Santa María de la Alameda. If only nearby Abantos was resurfaced i could try and jam it in. The climbs today are generally borderline cat. 3/2 difficulty. While for Spanish soil they're nothing special, they're definitely something unseen in Flanders. If you want a more difficult variant of this stage then look at the Duero valley east of Porto.\n\nConvento de Santo Domingo y San Pablo, Las Navas del Marqués.\n\nThe 2nd cobbled sector is in El Hoyo de Pinares, 25 km away from Las Navas del Marqués. It's the longest and most complicated section of the day. It starts on Calle San Miguel near Plaza Puerta del Sol. Then it follows Calle Santa Teresa, Avenida Portugal and Avenida de la Constitución to end at the top of a hill Cerro de la Niña Montera that's at the southwestern end of the town. The slope is very irregular. Calle San Miguel is downhill, but it levels out when reaching the cobbles. The next are:\n\n– 70m uphill on Plaza Puerta del Sol around Iglesia de San Miguel,\n\n– 120m flat to slightly uphill on Calle Santa Teresa,\n\n– 130m of quite sharp-ish downhill on Avenida Portugal and Plaza de la Resurrección,\n\n– 400m of quite significant uphill (~6-7%) on Avenida de la Constitución,\n\n– rest 270m slightly uphill on Avenida de la Constitución.\n\nCobbles in El Hoyo de Pinares.\n\nOnly 7km away from El Hoyo de Pinares is the town of Cebreros. It's home to the easiest hellingen of the day. To reach it from the proper side i will need to do a lap around the town where a road junction of AV-502 and AV-503 will be shared. Thankfully, this junction is wide and it can be split in half as there's no crossover. The lap around the town is 2,3km long.\n\nEl Hoyo de Pinares.\n\nThe cobbles start on Calle Toledo at the southern tip of the town. However, they're almost unnoticeable. A little bit rougher section starts on Plaza de España and continues on Avenida de la Constitución for the next 230m. The whole sector is 500m at roughly 5% with the steepest parts on Calle Toledo when approaching Plaza de España. This cobbled sector is part of the lower slopes of Puerto de Arrebatacapas – one of the gateways to Ávila. However, the race won't reach the city as after 18km the stage will abruptly shift eastwards for argueably the hardest challenge of the entire race.\n\nCobbles in Cebreros.\n\nSan Bartolomé de Pinares is an inconspicuous historic town in between Puerto de Arrebatacapas and Puerto del Boqueron on one of many routes towards Ávila. Also like many towns in the region it's quite hilly, topping at XVII c. Ermita del Santo Cristo. The town is also full of narrow and quite rough at times cobbled streets that lead to the church. The variant i've chosen goes via Calle de la Iglesia and Calle de la Virgen. It's 500m at Flanders-esque 10% and that includes the first 150m at 13-15% on Calle de la Iglesia and some very steep gradients at the very end (i think it may even reach close to 20% at certain point). This sector ends 25km before the finish line.\n\nCobbles in San Bartolomé de Pinares.\n\nIt's not the end of difficulties as after reaching Ermita del Santo Cristo the climb continues. The surface turns into hormigón when leaving the town. After another 350m at 10-12% it changes back to a not-so-great tarmac. The views here are quite picturesque as this quite narrow road ways in and out between rocky oucrops of Cerro de las Eras above San Bartolomé de Pinares. After 820m at roughly 10% the tarmac ends and the rest of the climb is on an easy sterrato. It lasts for next 1km of which the first half is still uphill (5-6%) while the rest is downhill (also 5-6%). It all ends when joining AV-P-307. The whole climb, which i've called Muro de las Eras is 2,5km at 8,6%. It is possible to do smaller laps around San Bartolomé de Pinares. When heading south the AV-P-307 road merges with AV-503 that leads back to the town. This projected lap would be 10km long.\n\nSan Bartolomé de Pinares.\n\nWhen merging with AV-503 the stage heads to the north. The climbing continues for next 4km but this time on only 4%. The last 18km are quite bumpy, but not exceeding 5-6%. They include the towns of La Cañada and Navalperal de Pinares. The last 2,7km to Las Navas del Marqués are at 4,4%. The finish line is on Avenida Descargadero at the end of a 250m flat to slightly downhill straight.\n\nWith the amount and scarcity of cobbles i expect them to be only a minor annoyance. It is possible to toughen it up with 8km laps around San Bartolomé de Pinares. For now i only wanted to show of some potential Spanish uphill cobbles that most probably were discovered in prehistory by LS and PRC. I tried to be very descriptive so sorry in advance for the amount of strictly technical info.\n\nNordic Series 19: Erzurum/Kandilli\n\nA bit of a left-field one, this, but with the re-tooled OSM Builder having a couple of limitations (closed roads over winter, which the old Google Maps builder had found a way around; and manual routing), I have a bit of re-adjustment to do on a few of my proposals for stages in high mountainous / traditional cycling areas, but that doesn't mean the Nordic Series cannot continue apace. After all, there are new areas adding bike races, and unusual additions to the calendar left right and centre these days.\n\nWe're all pretty familiar with the modern Tour of Turkey, but much of its history prior to the reboot in the mid-2000s is pretty little known. It grew out of a Tour of Marmara, so focused on northwest Anatolia, and then grew to incorporate more of the Mediterranean coastline and resorts, and a few stages in central Turkey. The northeastern corner of Turkey, the historical region of Armenia Minor and now part of the Black Sea coastal areas and eastern Anatolia, however, has been more or less ignored by the national tour. There are, however, a large number of smaller stage races in Turkey, mostly 2.2 races, and a couple of these go close to the area we're talking about here - most notably the Tour of Mesopotamia, run for the first time in 2018 and won by Nazim Bazırcı, which takes place in southeastern Turkey, surprisingly close to the Syrian border, and the Tour of the Black Sea, which takes place in the area around Rize, halfway between Trabzon and the Georgian border. Heading inland from Rize, we rise up significantly (after all, at Turkey's latitude you would need to be at significant altitude to have sufficient snow conditions for a Nordic venue) into the Anatolian mountains, onto a series of high plateaus, in which, at an altitude of 1750m, we find the city of Erzurum. Known since antiquity as Theodosiopolis, and to long-time settlers the Armenians as Karin, the city retains a Catholic titular see, although Catholicism has long since died in the area, which is predominantly Islamic now, even if this dominance has only become apparent in the last 125 years following the repeated massacres of the city's Armenian population from the 1890s through to the Armenian Genocide from late World War I era.\n\nAnyway, the intention was not to depress, but to talk about Erzurum at present, which is a bustling city, which boasts Turkey's finest wintersport facilities, and when it comes to the Nordic disciplines, by a wide margin. This is mainly as the city hosted the 2011 Winter Universiade, which necessitated the construction of venues for all of the student games required.\n\nThe cross-country skiing and biathlon were held at Kandilli, a wide open plateau area around 40km from Erzurum, with some rolling terrain. The terrain did mean a good view of everything that was going on, as well as a lot of open space, so it was hard for athletes to get out of sight and out of mind, as you can see from this summary from the biathlon. As is often the case, the former Ostbloc nations were able to dominate the medals here, with Vladislav Skobelev, a skier who has mostly been confined to the Continental Cup, winning gold in all three distance events in the XC, but Slovakia's Alena Procházková matched his achievements among the women, not winning the 5km classic but compensating by winning the sprint, which Skobelev could not. Other recognizable medallists to regular XC fans would include Eva Nyvltová (now Vrabcová-Nyvltová) in the sprint, Virginia de Martin Topranin in the 5km classic, Anouk Faivre Picon in the relay and Baptiste Gros in the sprint, the relay and the mixed team sprint. The biathlon fields were more star-studded, or at least World Cup recognized athletes-studded (though several of them had yet to make their names). Ukraine won six golds, with Artem Pryma and the very well-known Valj Semerenko winning two each individually plus one with the mixed relay, and Serhiy Semenov adding another. Bulgaria's Krasimir Anev won two silvers, plus a bronze in the team event along with fellow World Cup names Yordanova and Iliev. For Russia's part, the still fairly inexperienced Evgeny Garanichev won two bronzes individually and a silver in the relay, while Daria Virolaynen, some three years from her World Cup debut, won the Individual. For the 'other' big biathlon nations, only Germany had any real presence, with the now very well established multiple champion (mainly in team events) Franziska Hildebrand taking silver in the Individual, and her twin sister Stefanie, who quit the sport before Franzi made it to the top level, taking bronze in the Mass Start. These venues have gone on to become the focal point for the country's forays into cross-country and biathlon, although it is still baby steps for the time being and the likes of Nihan Erdiler and the Ustuntas brothers are not going to be troubling the top of the leaderboard at the World Cup anytime soon.\n\nThe focal point of the event, however, was the brand new Kiremitliktepe, the ski jump facility which took pride of place overlooking the city on a hill which has great prominence above the city centre. With a K-95 and K-125 hill, the facility was built to be state of the art and was the great pride of the Universiade. The central location made it easy to attend and while audiences weren't capacity, they were nevertheless sufficient to provide a pretty good atmosphere especially considering the paucity of domestic talent on show. Only a handful of those on show in Erzurum in 2011 have gone on to be household names - the Kot brothers, Maciej and Jakub, chief among them, though there was also Nicolas Fettner, brother of the more famous Manuel, on hand.\n\nThe venues' introduction to the world was a success, however, and they were reused a year later to hold the 2012 Nordic Junior World Championships, or the U23 Worlds more precisely. The names that were the stars there have, in the main, gone on to be far bigger fish, and many are at the forefront of the three sports (XC, ski jump and Nordic Combined) today; in the junior categories Sergey Ustiugov managed a clean sweep, winning the sprint, 10km classic, 20km skiathlon and relay; Sindre Bjørnestad Skar won a silver and three bronzes, Sondre Turvoll Fossli won two bronzes, an 18-year-old Stina Nilsson won the sprint. In the U23 categories Gleb Retivykh and Evgeny Belov were the dominant men, while Hanna Kolb won the sprint and the only women to leave with two medals were Martine Ek Hagen and Emma Wikén. Nejc Dežman won the ski jump on the NH, while Stefan Kraft was part of the Austrian bronze medal team; with women's ski jumping being a relatively new sport, save for a few veterans all the big names at the time were young, so you had a podium which consisted of the most successful female ski jumper of all time, Sara Takanashi, the inaugural women's World Cup winner, Sarah Hendrickson, and the first Olympic champion in the discipline, Carina Vogt. Not bad going! Not to be left out, Nordic Combined left us Manuel Faißt as NH10k silver medallist and Ilkka Herola matching this feat in the NH5k, while the team gold for Austria was helped by Philipp Orter and, as of today, individual World Championships medallist Franz-Josef Rehrl.\n\nThere was a problem however. With the Kiremitlik hill being of a soft and permeable type of earth, insufficient foundations had been built to cope with the volume of water once the artificial ponds added into the complex at the summit of the hill were taken into account, and this made the hill prone to landslides. While the problem looks worse there than it actually is (these are the smaller sized training and youth hills, the full-sized ones are to the left of shot), successive landslide damage in 2014 and 2015 meant the venue had to be rebuilt afresh. It was thought that this might signal the end of the Turkish interest in Nordic sport, but Erzurum successfully bid for the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival and was not going to let this slip, therefore the ski jumps were rebuilt and the hill complex reconfigured to minimise the risk of a repeat performance. These events went off without a hitch, and even saw the birthing of two potential new stars - both Slovenia's Timi Zajc and Russia's Lidiia Iakovleva won gold medals at Erzurum and have gone on to win their first World Cup events in 2018-19, while both still in their teenage years. And now there's enough space at the back of the ski jump to hold a puncheur finish up the hill too, so that's a bonus for us here.\n\nStage proposal #1: Rize - Kandilli, 237km\n\nThis is the kind of stage we never see nowadays - a long, looooong transitional stage with some monster climbs in it, but without them being expected to be decisive. It could produce some terrible racing or it could be incredible, depending on the race, the field, and the intentions. It includes an absolutely monstrous climb, which despite being on a four-lane highway is over 30km at 6%, over the Ovit Pass, which can be circumvented by using the tunnel in the event of problems. As you can see here, however, there really isn't a problem with the road conditions at the pass at present (obviously the bit from the tunnel to the height of the pass isn't still a highway). Let's just say that it'll be a long day in the saddle for the sprinters because this behemoth - over 30km climbing and an altitude of 2640m - is only a third of the way through the stage.\n\nThe following pass, Gölyurt, is borderline HC in its own right, but looks like a dwarf next to Ovit. 2380m high, it's got stats akin to Aubisque from Laruns, or Saint-Panthaléon. This is a long slog of a stage, you see, so even then there's still 95km of rolling terrain at high altitude to go. I want this to be attritional, so this will be something between the 1996 Pamplona stage and one of those Vuelta a Colombia stages where everybody is having to get used to thin air. After this, the HARD climbing is over, but there will be a paucity of domestiques even if they've soft pedalled everything, and so the smaller climbs will still hurt - the last of which is a 1500m climb just inside 20km from the line. After this, however, it's a pretty straight run-in. Oh, and did I mention that this plateau is susceptible to strong winds? Because it is. A lot of riders will hate me for this one. On the plus side for them, I finish at the XC/biathlon venue rather than make them continue on another 35km to Erzurum...\n\nStage proposal #2: Erzincan - Kandilli, 217km\n\nAgain a long stage, this time we're approaching from the west, so we're already at a reasonable altitude before we start on our way to the Kandilli XC/biathlon stadium, which will please the weaker climbers out there that don't have to take on a behemoth like Ovit Geçidi. That doesn't mean there isn't some serious climbing to be done though - firstly it's some serious climbing straight off the bat, with the first 16km all being uphill at around 5%. However, after that it's pretty rolling until we get to the old Silk Road city of Bayburt, whose medieval castle still at least partially survives.\n\nThe second half of the stage is focused around the climb of Kop Daği Geçidi, a famous pass in eastern Turkey which we are climbing the shorter but steeper version of. You can see a more detailed image here (we're riding right to left), cribbed from this Turkish cycling blog. There is really a sort of double-summit, with the actual pass as well as Kop Şehitleri Abidesi, a memorial complex.\n\nThis climb crests with 49km remaining, so enough time for those who haven't fallen TOO far back to recover, however, there's also a sting in the tail in the form of a short dig of a 4km climb 15km from the line, and then some narrow roads down to the finish - this could be a bit of a banana skin with the altitude too.\n\nStage proposal #3: Göle - Erzurum, 192km\n\nNow approaching from the east, we start over toward the border with Armenia and Georgia, in a town which has changed hands between Georgia, Armenia, Russia and Turkey/the Ottoman Empire multiple times in its history. It's a fast start because of us heading vaguely downhill for a lot of the early part of the stage but none of the gradients get especially tough that this turns into all out descending. It's essentially a long descent from 2100m to 1100m, before we rise back up again, over the easier side of the climb between the towns of Aksu and Yayla, through lush verdant forest climbing back to just under 2300m.\n\nThe somewhat severe descent here (this is akin to climbing Col de Menté east, as the Tour is wont to do, leaving the harder west face to be a descent only) leads into another gradually steepening climb, Güzelyaya Geçidi, at 2090m and part of a region renowned for its own microclimate - this can often lead to swirling winds, rain and snow. Its meagre average belies that there are some harder stretches, but even these are only 6-7% so nothing to be significantly feared 55km from the line. There is a final, important ascent at 13km from home, much like in the second proposal - this time to the part of town named for folk heroine Nene Hatun, who joined the fight to defend the Aziziye fort from the Russians, the site of which is now Nene Hatun Tarihi Milli Parkı and has a statue of her accordingly. The climb is only around 5% on a fairly wide road, it's somewhat reminiscent of the Vuelta stage to La Lastrilla a few years ago that Philippe Gilbert won, only with the climb being twice as long. We then descend into town to finish at the complex at the back of the ski jumps, so the last 500m or so is uphill at 5%.\n\nStage proposal #4: Bingöl - Erzurum, 176km\n\nThis is perhaps the more realistic option, though it's still not a 'pleasant' option - there is much less in the way of keynote climbing to be seen here, but still a lot of going up and down; it's rather reminiscent of some of those Vuelta stages which are classified as flat stages but see the péloton relentlessly going up or downhill all day in searing heat. At least at altitude of 1800m for most of the day the riders will be spared some of that torture, although obviously at altitude the impact of these smaller climbs will be amplified of course.\n\nThis is the stage approaching from the south (we've basically had one from north, one from west, one from east, so now one from south to complete the set), and as much of this is high plateau too, there isn't so much in the way of big climbs and differences in altitude, although there are still some ridges and mountains we must cross - the Palandöken mountains cover much of the south of Erzurum province, and we need to get into the province from this direction, so voilà - another almost 2400m mountain pass; although at least this time we're already starting from best part of 2000m altitude, so it only gets cat.2 status.\n\nFor the most part though, this is all about uncategorized or low-categorized bumps as it's terrain - both visually and topographically - that may remind one of the Volta a Portugal. Finishing by arriving in Erzurum from the west (to the south is the Alpine resort which can only be accessed from one road, so you can't just drop from a mountain pass directly to finish in Erzurum, at least not on a road bike) - with the finish being the 2km at 5% that is the uphill ramp into this side of town then the final drag up to the ski jump tower.\n\nSee, even in the more obscure venue locations, you can do some interesting stuff with the Nordic venues.\n\n@LS, i myself had an idea of having a smaller race that lead from Trabzon via Rize to Erzurum with a stage featuring this Ovit pass, but finishing in Ispir between Ovit and Gölyurt.\n\n16.11.2018... wonder, how long it will take to post it. Also, don't be affraid on the length of these descriptions as soon it turned out to be a grind, but because i feel Sardinia is a bit overlooked i decided to be more scrupulous.\n\nLet's say that a Grande Partenza on Friday in the biggest city of Sardinia – Cagliari is logistically not the best way to kick off a race. The 2017 Giro did it much better, but soon you'll see why i did it this way. With this and the next stage (both the longest stages of this Giro) you'll also see, why i decided to cover this at times a bit overlooked (in favor of Corsica) island.\n\nI'll be only scratching the surface but if you want to know more about the island and its settlements i'll redirect you here.\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/246745\n\nGiro d'Italia 2 – stage 1. Cagliari – Alghero, 219km, hilly, echelon potential?\n\nClimbs:\n\nCùglieri – 14,9km, 2,9%, cat. 4, 450m\n\nMonte Mannu – 7,1km, 4,6%, cat. 4, 356m\n\nSo, what's the point of the first stage if it doesn't look too promising? The last 70k are quite hilly with even two cat. 4 climbs but the main threat may be the wind. Giro isn't renown for echelons. Sardinia and especially it's west coast is quite exposed and the closest peace of land are the Balleares roughly 450km to the west. AFAIK the majority of winds are western or northwestern. That means there might be a slim chance of echelons and the coastal roads are quite exposed (rarely covered by either rocky outcrops or typical Mediterranean foliege). I'm not expecting too much to happen but there's potential for more action than on the aforementioned 2017 stages combined. The main focus of this stage is on the very picturesque, rocky coast of Sardinia with maybe some more historic places in the form of Cagliari, Oristano and Alghero. Expect plenty of coastal photos.\n\nI don't really want to focus on those big and well known metropolis like Cagliari as i mainly want to showcase more obscure places. In Sardinian Cagliari is known as Casteddu, which translates to \"castle\". I assume you know the city relatively well with it's Nuragic origins, Carthaginian necropolis and various Roman remains (at the time it was known as Karalis). Sardinia was home to a quite advanced Neolithic/Bronze Age set of civilisations, which in the 3rd millenium BC were culturally contesting with the Minoan civilisation. Plenty of such Nuragic remains and dolmens are north of Cagliari (mainly on the Giara di Gesturi and Barbagia plateaus), but i'm leaving them off the race as i'm betting on the wind so i'm heading straight to the western coast through the Campidano valley.\n\nCagliari and the Arangonese XIV c. royal palace.\n\nThe so called Nuraghi are a set of ancient civilisations (in ancient Egypt known as the Sea People) that inhabited the island before the arrival of Phoencians and Romans in VII-VI c. BC. These people also included possible Philistines and Mycenaeans influences of 2nd millenium BC. The oldest remains date back to Neolithic (6000-5000 BC). They're often tower-like defensive structures somewhat reminescent of a Roman castrum. These structures are considered to be the most valuable treasure on the island, but i personally also recommend some of the coastal drives and climbs (Genna Silana, Correboi). Apparently the beaches are also not that crowded and the local hillside foliege has a very intense smell...\n\nAn example of a Nuraghe (Santu Antine) in Torralba.\n\nCagliari with hilltop Castello San Michele.\n\nThe main sights in Cagliari are the Tuvixeddu necropolis – the biggest Carthaginian necropolis dating back to VI c. BC, V c. Basilica di San Saturnino dedicated to the patron saint of the city. The saint was killed during the Diocletian's persecutions of Christians for refusing to offer sacrifices to Jupiter. There are also two early XIV c. defensive towers Torre di San Pancrazio and Torre dell'Elefante, XIII c. cathedral, XII-XVI c. hilltop Castello San Michele and XIV c. Basilica di Bonaria (from which Buenos Aires gets its name).\n\nBasilica di San Saturnino.\n\nII c. Roman amphitheatre of Cagliari.\n\nThe first half of the stage (to Oristano) is in the Campidano (Campidànu in Sardinian) valley that separates the hilly mainland of Sardinia from the post-volcanic hills of Sulcis-Iglesiente. The highest peak of Sulcis-Iglesiente is 1236m high Monte Linas, but the most famous peak is Monte Arcuentu at 785m. Campidano is mainly an agriculture and a wine center. There are also some rice fields near Oristano. Because the region is very open it may get quite windy as the coast is not far away.\n\nMonte Arcuentu.\n\nCampidano.\n\nThe proper race starts just west of Cagliari in between a bunch of lagoons. The largest one are Stagno di Santa Gilla (more correctly Stagno di Cagliari) and Stagno di Capoterra. It's a quite picturesque place with plenty of shallow lakes accompanied by distant peaks of Sulcis-Iglesiente. The entire lagoon is part of the Natura 2000 as it's inhabited by plenty of bird species, mainly a pink flamingo. Not far is also an important protected area of Monte Arcosu, created to protect the Corsican red deer.\n\nSome flamingos minding their own business on Stagno di Santa Gilla.\n\nThe towns of Campidano, while often ancient, for a long time were quite small and only recently gained a lot of population. Generally in Italy the history of population migration is very similar. Plenty of Roman cities were located in the valleys but with the advent of Barbarian, Saracen and Hungarian sieges of early middle ages many of these towns moved up local hillside. However, because of limited growth possibilities caused by bumpy terrain many of these towns stagnated and now people are moving down to where the industry and offices have space to flourish. I'm no economy expert and i guess this observation is either false or propaedeutical.\n\nThe older civil structures are often in a local Campidano style (of clay bricks), which is sort of a blend between Italian and Spanish styles. In the middle ages Sardinia was under heavy Spanish influence thanks to it being part of Aragon during XIV-XV c. but the influence lasted untill the Bourbon dynasty inherited Spain in XVIII c. No different to this Campidano style is the first other than Cagliari town of the stage – Uta. Just outside of the town is a XII c. Chiesa di Santa Maria.\n\nChiesa di Santa Maria, Uta.\n\nFrom Uta the race passes close to the ancient town of Decimomannu (remains of a Roman acqueduct and a bridge) and Villaspeciosa (XII c. Chiesa di San Platano and a Roman mosaic of San Cromazio). In between Villaspeciosa and Decimoputzu are the remains of a Nuraghic (XII-XI c. BC) settlement of Cuccureddus. From Decimoputzu the stage runs on the outskirts of Sulcis-Iglesiente to Guspini (home to a X c. Chiesa di Santa Maria di Malta) through Vallermosa, Villacidro and Gonnosfanadiga (try to say that quickly). The first intermediate sprint is in Gonnosfanadiga (insert like a thousand \"L\"'s and it could be a Welsh name).\n\nCascata Sa Spendula, Villacidro.\n\nHistorically Guspini was located on the border of Giudicato di Arborea and Giudicato di Cagliari. Those were sort of Sardinian districts (judgedoms) originating from the Byzantine Empire (in the early middle ages the island was part of the empire). There were four of them – Cagliari in the south, Arborea (Oristano) in the west, Gallura (Olbia) in the northeast and Logudoro (Sassari) in the northwest. These Giudicati lasted untill the Aragonese rule (the longest independent Giudicato was Arborea to XV c.). These districts were ruled by the so called judges – sort of princes, but with slightly lesser power and sometimes elected by a gathering of nobles known as Corona de Logu.\n\nSardinia in the middle ages.\n\nThe districts were often in conflicts with each other. For example there were some heavy fights between Arborea and Cagliari for nearby to Guspini Castello di Monreale that's just outside the town of Sardara. Later the region was also in the middle of fights between Arborea and the Aragonese (then occupying Cagliari). These culminated during the 1409 Battle of Sanluri, which was the end for the Giudicati of Arborea.\n\nCastello di Monreale, Sardara.\n\nArborea mainly consists of the northernmost Campidano (plains around Oristano), former wetlands (dried out during the Fascist reign) around the town of Arborea and northern parts of Costa Verde – a very picturesque, rocky coast of Sulcis-Iglesiente. There are some great coastal roads on Costa Verde so i recommend checking them out.\n\nCosta Verde.\n\nIn front of Oristano is the town of Santa Giusta. It's located in between two coastal lakes Stagno di Pauli Majori and Stagno di Santa Giusta. It was founded in VIII c. BC by Phoencians. In the antiquity it was known as Othoca (now a necropolis) and it was one of three main municipalities of Arborea (with Sulci and Tharros). It was also an early Christian center and its modern name comes from San Giusta of II c. martyred under the reign of Diocletian. In the middle ages it was a bishopry, abolished in 1503 to be joined into the diocese of Oristano. From that period is XII c. Basilica di Santa Giusta. Just outside of the town are the remains of a Roman bridge over Rio Palmas.\n\nBasilica di Santa Giusta.\n\nOristano is one of the biggest cities of Sardinia. It's located at the mouth of Golfo di Oristano. While founded in the middle ages its history traces back to Phoencian Tharros founded at the tip of a nearby peninsula (Capo San Marco). The town was founded in X c. after a constant Saracen threat forced inhabitants of Tharros to move more inland. At the time Tharros was a capital of the Giudicato of Arborea so after the switch Oristano automatically inherited the capital status. For a short time in XIV c. the Giudicato of Arborea and therefore Oristano was in control of the entire island.\n\nTharros.\n\nMain sights are the XII c. Cattedrale di Santa Maria Assunta, XIV c. Chiesa di Santa Chiara (a rather rare exaple of a gothic style on the island), XIII c. Torre di Mariano II (also known as Torre di San Cristoforo) commisioned by the judge Mariano II and the remains of city walls (Cinta Muraria) with Torre di Portixedda. From Oristano was Eleanor of Arborea, the last judge of Arborea and the creator of Carta de Logu – a Sardinian code of law in use up to XIX c. I'm not entirely sure but it may had been route of the 1991 Giro's stage 3 from Sassari to Cagliari.\n\nTorre di Mariano II, Oristano.\n\nCattedrale di Santa Maria Assunta, Oristano.\n\nAssociated with Tharros is also the archaelogical site of Mont'e Prama, roughly 5km north from the ancient site. It's considered to be one of the most important in the entire Mediterranean. Mont'e Prama consisted of a large Nuraghic necropolis protected by a row of at least 28 giant statues dating back to XI-VIII c. BC. Now they're stored in nearby Cabras and in a national museum in Cagliari.\n\nSome examples of the stone giants from Mont-e Prama.\n\nStarting from Oristano the race hugs the very picturesque western coast of Sardinia as Campidano ends and gives space to the hilly massif of Monte Ferru (1050m) – the largest volcanic formation in Sardinia. It heavilly reminds me of Catalonia. The roads are quite twisty but mostly points towards north. They're also very exposed and quite often elevated (up to 450m) which can strengthen the effects of coastal winds (mistral). I doubt it will be strong enough to cause echelons or it may end up in a headwind but i hope that'll be the best attempt for some wind action for a tour, that normally isn't renown for them.\n\nSome rocky arches near S'Archittu.\n\nAt the very end of Campidano are two luxurious coastal resorts S'Archittu and Santa Caterina di Pittinuri renown for their seaside limestone formations and bays. Just north of Santa Caterina di Pittinuri is the archaelogical site of Cornus, founded in VI c. BC by Phoencians. It was a quite important site during the First Punic War as it was the center of an anti-Roman revolt headed by a military figure Ampsicora. Later it was also one of the first Christian centers in the island with the remains of at least two basilicas from II c. The town was abandoned in VIII-IX c. possibly caused by the Saracen raids. Nearby are also some Nuraghic remains at Fanne Massa and Sa Spelunca de Nonna dating back to the Bronze Age.\n\nSome remains from the Cornus archaelogical site.\n\nSanta Caterina di Pittinuri.\n\nIn Santa Caterina di Pittinuri starts the first categorised climb of the race. It's a long, not so steep grind to the town of Cuglieri, slightly further inland. The climb is 14,9km at 2,9% (max 6-7%). It's two-stepped with a 3km long false-flat in the middle. I think normally it would be left out from being categorised in the real Giro but i want to promote the dying cat. 4. The climb is mostly covered from the wind. The descent to Sennariolo is 4,3km at a regular 4,8%. The roads are mostly wide and in good quality but the ride through the hilltop town of Cuglieri can be quite narrow in places (it is possible to bypass it though).\n\nCascata di Capo Nieddu, Cuglieri.\n\nCuglieri is a small town on top of a hill known as Bardosu. The town is the 2nd iteration of the ancient town of Cornus. In the middle ages it was the main town of Montiferru (Monte Ferru), which was the southern fief of the Giudicato of Logudoro. At the time it was home to Casteddu Etzu that now is in ruins. In XIX c. it started to develop as one of the most prosperous towns in Sardinia, boasting the first bank company on the island. In 1924 the town was chosen to host the first outside of Rome pontifical theological school and an associated with it seminary.\n\nCuglieri.\n\nIn nearby Santa Caterina di Pittinuri a local fishermen from XIV c. found a statue of the Madonna with Child (Madonna della Neve). Because of this discovery Cuglieri became a minor pilgrimage site. From those times is the first minor basilica on the island, the XIV c. Basilica di Santa Maria della Neve. Other sights include XI c. Chiesa di Santa Croce, various Nuraghic sites and a seaside waterfall Capo (Cabu) Nieddu. The town was also home to a hillclimb car time trial to La Madonnina held from 1980 to 2010.\n\nCasteddu Etzu.\n\nAfter a two-stepped descent to the town of Bosa the race enters the region of Planagria (Pianàlza). It's a very similar region to it's southern neighbor Monte Ferru. To the north it borders the small region of Nurra, which is the northwestern tip of the island. The region is renown for its Malvasia wine, cultivated mainly around Bosa and Suni. After a brief detour inland the stage runs back to the rocky coast (SP49) weaving back and forth to finally reach its destination in Alghero.\n\nPlanagria.\n\nThe coast near Costa di Tentizzos, Bosa.\n\nThe coast near Porto Mànagu, Bosa.\n\nAt the end of the descent from Cuglieri is the last bigger settlement before Alghero and it's Bosa. Some more educated pundits here may recognize it as the finish to stage 2 of Giro 2007, That stage went from Tempio Pausania (it will also feature in my race) via Sassari and Alghero. However, the run-in to Bosa was more inland (via Villanova Monteleone) than my choice. Even with the climb to Villanova Monteleone and a crash with 5km to go it was still a bunch sprint won by Robbie McEwen with \"Puma\" Garzelli being the only GC guy in top 10.\n\nMcEwen winning a sprint in Bosa in front of Ale Petacchi and Rainbow Bettini.\n\nBosa.\n\nBosa is a very colorful town in the middle of Planagria overlooked by Castello Malaspina (Serravalle). The town and its castle were founded in XII c. by the Tuscan Malaspina family. It was the capital of a local Planagria duchy, which was part of the Giudicato of Logudoro. During the Arangonese reign it was designated as a royal city. The main sights are the XII c. castle, XI c. Chiesa di San Pietro, XIV c. Chiesa di Nostra Signora de sos Regnos Altos and various beaches hidden within rocky outcrops like S'Abba Druche, Portu Managu or Turas with a number of coastal towers like XVI c. Torre dell'Isola Rossa or XVI c. Torre Argentina.\n\nCastello Malaspina, Bosa.\n\nCala Cumpoltitu, Bosa.\n\nThe last 40km starting from Bosa are entirely on the coast. It's a very picturesque to at times outright stunning ride, where you can test your inner rally driver. It also can be very exposed hence there might be some wind.\n\nSome snippets from the Bosa – Alghero road.\n\nThere's still one cat. 4 climb left and i don't really have a name for it. The closest names i found are either \"Su Ferru e Su Caddu\" or \"Monte Mannu\". I decided to go with the 2nd name because it's easier to remember. The climb is 7,1km at 4,6%. It's mostly regular but with a small false-flat near the top, which is 30km from the finish line. The last 30k are up and down, quite twisty but mostly towards north. The road is wide and in good quality.\n\nProfile of Monte Mannu (Su Ferru e Su Caddu).\n\nSome additional snippets from the Bosa – Alghero road.\n\nThe finish is in Alghero, which was the grande partenza in 2017. The stage finished in Olbia with an interesting (apparently incidental) stint by Lukas Postlberger, which nicked him possibly the result of his career so far and apparently the first Austrian stage win and maglia rosa in Giro's history (no Totschnig? Then that's a great feat i guess).\n\nPostlberger winning in Olbia.\n\nAlghero (L'Alguer/S'Alighèra) is one of the biggest cities in Sardinia and the biggest (with Porto Torres) on the northewestern end of the island known as Nurra. Like many places on the island it dates back to early antiquity with two Nuraghic sites of Nuraghe Palmavera (1500 BC) and Anghelu Ruju (3000 BC) near the city. The modern Alghero is an early XII c. harbor founded by the Doria family from Genoa. It soon expanded thanks to an influx of Catalan refugees, mainly during the Aragonese reign. The Alghero dialect of Catalan can still be found in use but it's mostly endangered. Sadly, the town was heavilly damaged during the WW2 by bombing.\n\nAlghero's center seen from Porta Terra.\n\nMain sights include the aforementioned Nuraghic necropoli, XVI c. Cattedrale di Santa Maria Immacolata, XIV c. Chiesa di San Francesco, and a quite extensive set of XIII-XVI c. city walls. In near proximity to Alghero you can also find XVII c. Santuario di Valverde and very picturesque isthmus of Capo Caccia with a number of grottos like Grotta Verde or Grotta di Nettuno.\n\nCity walls in front of the sea, Alghero.\n\nCapo Caccia.\n\nI suppose the stage will end in either a full on bunch sprint or a slightly reduced one due to Monte Mannu and a potential wind. I don't mind it ending in a sprint as both cat. 4 climbs should at least slightly test the form of them fast dudes and it should also be a fine terrain to try your luck like Postlberger did 2 years ago. The next stage will be much different as it'll cover the vast nothingness that's the mountainous Sardninian interior.\n\nThe longest stage of the race and the 2nd (and next to last) over 200k stage. This island is much bigger than Corsica so it's nay impossible to do a 2013 Tour de France 3 stages set without leaving out some parts of the island and this year it'll be most of its southeastern end.\n\nLast stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/246486\n\nGiro d'Italia 2 – stage 2. Sassari – Fonni, 231km, mountain.\n\nClimbs:\n\nPattada – 14,3km, 3,1%, cat. 4, 678m\n\nPasso Genna Silana – 26,6km, 3,3%, cat. 2, 1017m\n\nPasso Orostode – 12,8km, 7,4%, cat. 1, 1098m\n\nPasso Correboi – 7,4km, 4,6%, cat. 3, 1246m\n\nI think calling it a mountain stage is a stretch, but i decided to keep it as originally intended. Also, Pattada is cat. 4, not cat. 3.\n\nThe Giro visited Sardinia on four occasions. In 1961 it was just a one stage around Cagliari. The first full 3-stage block was in 1991, when Sassari was its focal point. It hosted 3 stages of which the first two were split – a reduced sprint on stage 2 won by Bugno in front of Chioccioli (who later won the entire race) and an 8km long TT won by Gianluca Pierobon in front of Lejarreta and Chioccioli. The city was also featured in 2007 on stage 2 and in 2017 on stage 1.\n\nSassari.\n\nSassari is the 2nd largest city of the island and one of its biggest industrial and office hubs. Outside of the city are also the iron, zinc and lead mines. It's the main hub of the hilly region of Logudoro. Its historic center is composed of two neighboring plazas Piazza Cavallino de Honestis and Piazza d'Italia. The town was founded in XII c after a merger of a number of local villages. Soon it became the biggest city of Giudicato di Logudoro and its last capital. In 1562 Jesuits founded here the oldest university on the island. Its library now houses the Carta de Logu code of law. Main sights include XI c. Chiesa di San Pietro di Silki, XV c. Cattedrale di San Nicola, XVII c. Fontana di Rosello, XV c. Casa Montanyans, XVI c. Palazzo Manca di Usini and the remains of XIV c. city walls. Sassari was also home to an Aragonese castle from XIV c. but it was demolished in 1877.\n\nCattedrale di San Nicola, Sassari.\n\nI think also worth noting is the coastal town of Castelsardo that's roughly 30km northeast. I consider it one of the most picturesque places in Sardinia. It's home to the hilltop XII c. Doria castle, XVI c. Concattedrale di Sant'Antonio that overlooks the sea and nearby Roccia dell'Elefante, considered to be one of the symbols of Sardinia.\n\nCastelsardo.\n\nRoccia dell'Elefante.\n\nLeaving Sassari the race will pass near a peculiar looking church Basilica di Saccargia from XII c. It reminds me of some other religious structures found in the Italian mainland (maybe Bologna or Pisa cathedral?) with it's mosaic-like bicolour appearance (a mix of basaltic and limestone) set in form of horizontal lines. On the same road, near the Saccargia basilica and just before a large junction of SS597 and SP68 there's XI-XIII c. Chiesa di San Michele di Salvenero. It also boasts a mix of basaltic and limestone but in this case it's more of a chaotic arrangement.\n\nBasilica di Saccargia.\n\nThe stage will mostly visit the central and later the eastern part of the island, at times following the stage 2 from 2017. Because most of the route will be in complete nomansland the roads can be spotty but i tried to use as many wide and nice roads as i could only find while keeping the stage's length inside the UCI limitations.\n\nChiesa di San Michele di Salvenero.\n\nWhile the stage passes nearby some villages like Ploaghe or Codrongianos the first village to be properly on the stage is Ardara near the border of the Logudoro region. It's a lost to time village on the slopes of Montesanto founded in the XII c. as a new capital of the Judges from Porto Torres, caused by Saracen raids. It was the residence of the judges for the majority of year but the summer months where they resided in Sardinian Burgos (south of Ardara). From the time it was a capital are the ruins of the Judge's castle and Chiesa di Santa Maria del Regno, then the Judge's wedding and funeral site. The last Logudoro Judge – Adelasia was buried here (1259).\n\nChiesa di Santa Maria del Regno, Ardara.\n\nIn between Ardara and the next village of Ozieri stands a rural Basilica di Sant'Antioco di Bisarcio from XI c. It's part of the archaelogical site of Bisarcio to which it was its cathedral. The bishopric existed there from at least XI c. to 1503, when it was annexed to Alghero. The remains of the village are still visible on the other side of a local road. I guess it was abandoned soon after 1503.\n\nBasilica di Sant'Antioco di Bisarcio.\n\nBisarcio belongs to the village of Ozieri that's located just east of the archaelogical site, at the edge of Logudoro (west), Goceano (south) and Monte Acuto (northeast). The first confirmed Sardinian civilization dating back to 3200-2800 BC (together with the Arzachena culture) bears its name from the town after early XX c. discoveries inside nearby cave Grotte di San Michele. The town itself dates back to antiquity, boasting a local Roman bridge Pont'ezzu from II c.\n\nOzieri.\n\nFrom Ozieri the race runs inside a local Sa Matta 'e 'Antina valley topped by two hilltop villages of Bantine (Bantìna) and Pattada (Patada). Just below Pattada is the first KOM of the stage. It's a cat. 4 climb with 14,3km at 3,1%. It's a two-stepped ascent with the first climb to Ozieri being 4km at roughly 5% and the second ascent to the top being 4km at roughly 5,2%. Both climbs are separated by just over 5km of false-flat. There's hardly any descent as the stage continues on Monte Acuto – a rather dry, Spanish-like plateau featuring sometimes nice looking rocky peaks. Highest peak is Punta di Senalonga at 1077m.\n\nRocky peaks of Monte Acuto.\n\nThe village of Pattada is mostly known for its resolza knife. The other two places known for this knife are Arbus near Guspini and Santu Lussurgiu not far from Cuglieri. The town was also seen a number of times in a local Giro di Sardegna (discontinued since 2011). The list of winners of this race is really impressive – Merckx, Secru, van Linden, de Vlaeminck, Maertens, Marino Basso, Knut Knudsen, Saronni, Kreuziger, Sagan, Anquetil, Van Looy etc.\n\nPattada.\n\nVarious types of resolza knifes (these are from Arbus).\n\nFrom Pattada the stage continues through the vast emptiness of Monte Acuto. In the middle of this desert is the town of Buddusò renown for its picturesque granite homes and rocky outcrops. It lies on a very ondulating area. The town is a medieval granite quarry (dating back to late XIII c.), hence the characteristic appearance of local houses. Nearby are also Nuraghic sites of Loelle and Ruju dating back to 2000 BC. There's also a Nuraghic and later Roman archaelogical site of Romanzesu between Buddusò and nearby village of Bitti housing an amphitheater, two small temples and a stone labyrinth.\n\nBuddusò.\n\nRemains of a Nuraghic castrum at Loelle near Buddusò.\n\nFrom Buddusò the race goes near the border of Monte Acuto and Baronie to then end up at Dorgali via a bunch of local roads. This ride includes another bunch of ancient sites like Nuraghe Castra 'e Jacone just below Onani. You can also expect some great chuppa (choops) shots of nearby Punta Catria and Monte Albo peaks. Closer to Dorgali the stage passes through Monte Ortobene, often an MTF on the aforementioned Giro di Sardegna and Lago del Cedrino, where the Genna Silana climb starts. Above Lago del Cedrino, on the local Gollei plateau there's a well preserved Nuraghic (Mycenaean?) site of Serra Orrios dating back to XVII c. BC.\n\nPunta Catrina (1127m) near Lula/Lùvula.\n\nAerial view of Serra Orros.\n\nIn Dorgali the stage will met up with the 2017 stage 2. This relatively new town over Golfo di Orosei is one of the biggest archaelogical centers of Sardinia with the likes of S'Ena 'e Thomes, Serra Orrios, Sa Sedda 'e Sos Carros, cave village of Tiscali and Nuraghe Mannu. The town is also a tourism center with the Cala Gonone resort, Cala di Luna, Grotta di Ispinigoli (home to the highest stalagmite-stalactite in Europe) or Grotta del Bue Marino (with its salt lake). It's also one of the entrances to the Orosei 'e del Gennargentu National Park, which i think is only one of two NP's on the Island (other one being that of the Costa Smeralda islands). The majority of the rest of this stage takes place within this national park.\n\nCala Gonone.\n\nGrotta del Bue Marino.\n\nCala di Luna with a rainbow(?) in the background.\n\nLike the mentioned before 2017 stage also this stage features the long and visually quite stunning grind of Genna Silana. I won't be focusing on it as you've seen it two years ago. However, i'm not descending straight to Tortolì but turn into a local road to Talana via Urzulei (SP37). The descent is on a wide and mostly good road. It's quite long but not too steep (avg 5-6%, up to 8%). I think @togo80 did a stage finishing in Dorgali that featured this road, but he went the other way (Genna Silana via Urzulei is not half bad). The descent ends when reaching Riu Pramaera.\n\nProfile of Genna Silana.\n\nGennargentu near Tiscali.\n\nRight after the descent it's time for the main dish of this game. I'm not sure of the name of this climb but it seems to be Passo Orostode (S'Arcu 'e S'Orostode). It's located above the village of Talana on what seems to be a relatively new (or just newly surfaced) road. It's one of the harder if not the hardest surfaced climbs that's not a dead end. With 12,8km at 7,4% it's a pretty good cat. 1 climb (not far from the HC mark). Because it's only stage 2 and i want to promote the guys in the breakaway i decided to also have it as a Giro cat. 1. I guess these KOM points may generate a potentially strong break that could force the peloton to ride the stage harder as i doubt anyone will want to risk giving too much time on guys, who most probably have some experience at climbing.\n\nProfile of Passo Orostode.\n\nAs you can see by the profile above it's a two-stepped ascent with both stretches averaging at 7-9% with a roughly 1,2km long false-flat/downhill at the end of Talana. The profile shows some gradient spikes but both parts are very regular. The first part to Talana is 6,8km at 8,3% while the second part is 4,8km at 8,1% The hardest part seems to be near the top (which is 40km from the finish line) reaching somewhere around 12%. The road to Talana is wide and in nice quality but starting from the village it's quite narrow but mostly good quality besides inside the village, where it can be spotty. The views above the village can be quite breathtaking. It ain't Orduña but it's no slouch either.\n\nViews from Passo Orostode.\n\nAt the top i've found a GPM line drawn on the road. There are two streetview images from 2008 and 2010 and it's only on the 2nd one so i've looked at the Sardegna Giri from 2008 to 2010 but found nothing. I guess it may had been stage 3 from 2009 as there's a cat. 1 mentioned and the finish was not far away in Tortoli. At the top of Orostode there's also a minor Nuraghic site of Bau 'e Tanca.\n\nThe descent from Orostode is quite complicated as it's mostly a false-flat with some pinches of gradient here and there (max 7-8%). The road does widen up right at the top of Orostode but its quality seems to be a bit shaky in some places. Thankfully it's not technical at all so i think it should be fine enough. I think Orostode should provide a fair initial selection of the entire race (especially if there's a strong enough breakaway to force a higher tempo of the GC group) and i think lack of a proper descent may sound like a trouble for those, who dropped.\n\nPunta la Marmora (1834m).\n\nThe descent ends at Sa Carcaredda Nuraghic site when joining a wider and nicer Correboi road. The descent continues for a short time before entering the last climb of the day, Passo Correboi. It's a 7,4km false-flat averaging at 4-5% with max 7% at the very bottom. The peak is 15km from the finish line. It's on a wide and nice road sporting some awesome views and cattle. In front of Correboi is Punta la Marmora, which at 1834m is the highest peak on the island. The descent, which is also wide and mostly shallow (max 8%) will lead to a junction between Correboi's SS389 and Fonni's SP69 roads. The last 11km to the finish are ondulating.\n\nProfile of Correboi (from SS389 sign).\n\nIt's worth noting that all of today's climbs (but the 1st one) are part of the Orosei 'e del Gennargentu national park. Like aforementioned Dorgali, Fonni ('Onne in Sardinian) is also one of the gates to the park. Fonni is considered to be the highest municipality with city rights on the island at roughly 960m high. It's located at the foothills of Monte Spada (1595m) and Bruncu Spina (1829m). The last mountain is also home to the biggest ski resort on the island (roughly 4km of ski slopes) – Bruncu Spina. It's located at roughly 1550m, which i think is the highest paved road on the island. It also has some free space that could be just enough for a Giro. However, the acces road is in a rather bothersome state. The climb to Bruncu Spina is roughly 15,5km at somewhere around 4%. Below you can see a longer version of this stage finishing at the station.\n\nSassari – Bruncu Spina.\n\nBruncu Spina (1829m).\n\nWhat to expect? I hope a fairly entertaining stage with a reduced (15-30 man?) bunch sprint on quite narrow, uphill streets of Fonni. If someone's undercooked he may lose some time and because the hardest climb is 40km from the finish it's mostly a case of not winning the race but losing it. Because i decided to have only 3 stages in Sardinia and the island is quite large i need to do a quite strenuous transfer of almost 200km towards the northern stretches of Sardinia known as Gallura. Sadly, this Giro will have plenty of quite long transfers but i needed them if i wanted to have the stages that i've got in the end.\n\nThe last Sardinian stage is dedicated to its northeastern region of Gallura – home to Olbia, Tempio Pausania and Costa Smeralda. It should be a great day for the heli and for the people enjoying Sunday coastal breeze.\n\nLast stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/246812\n\nGiro d'Italia 2 – stage 3. Tempio Pausania – Olbia, 167km, flat.\n\nClimbs:\n\nAbbiadori – 2,1km, 5%, cat. 4, 121m\n\nThe stage's design is rather inconspicuous with only one categorised climb of Abbiadori. There are some other coastal hills to tackle but it should be a pure sprinters day. For now i decided to move the finish in Olbia to a slightly uphill Viale Moro Aldo. I've didn't realized the 2017 stage also approached Olbia from north so i guess you can just copy its finish with its quite technical run-up. However, i think this a bit more uphill approach may be a smidge more interesting for you.\n\nAfter over 10 years Tempio Pausania is back on the Giro map. This 2nd biggest city and the administrative center of Gallura was the start to 2007 stage 2, which i've mentioned previously during my first stage. Like then the stage will descend down towards the coast (Costa Paradiso) but then turn east towards Costa Smeralda and Olbia.\n\nTempio Pausania is at the foot of Monte Limbara (1362m), near the border of Gallura and Logudoro. Monte Limbara is home to an observatory to which leads a rather suspicious looking but surfaced road that could be a potential MTF (decent cat .1) spot if someone decided to reinstate Giro di Sardegna.\n\nMonte Limbara.\n\nWhile the town dates back to at least XII c. when it immediately became one of the main centers and the 2nd bishopric (after Olbia) of Giudicato di Gallura, the granite-heavy historic center is mostly from XVII-XVIII c. The town stands by granite. I think even the streets are of large granite cobbles. Their colour is almost the same as that of the buildings. Up to XIX c. it was known as Tempio. Pausania was added in after an eponymous legendary town, which apparently was one of the iterations of Olbia (possibly between the Roman Olbia and medieval Olbia-Civita). Even if the majority of the town dates back to XVII-XVIII c. there are plenty of older structures. The most interesting are probably the remains of a manor house dating back to XII c. which was suppoosed to be one of the seats of the Judges of Gallura. Other sights include XII c. Chiesa di Santa Croce or XIV c. Oratorio del Rosario, all of them built in granite.\n\nTempio Pausania.\n\nChiesa di Santa Croce, Tempio Pausania.\n\nLike the majority of the island, Gallura is a hilly and a rather barren region dotted with limestone peaks. Before the descent down to the coast the stage passes through Aggius. It's a historic granite mine (critical for Tempio Pausania) and also a carpet making hub. During the People's Spring of 1848 for 2 days this town had its own republic.\n\nGallura (here Valle della Luna) near Aggius.\n\nAggius.\n\nThe descent to the coast (Costa Paradiso) starts after roughly 25km, from the village of Trinità d'Agultu e Vignola or La Trinitài e Vignòla. The descent is 6km long at roughly 6,2% (max ~8%). The road is relatively twisty but wide and in nice condition. The descent can provide some quality views of Costa Paradiso. It ends in the village of Paduledda, which is home to a quite picturesque Isola Rosa – one of the main tourist destinations of Gallura. Within the vincinity are a number of little coves like La Marinedda, Li Cossi or Cala Rossa (pink rocks). The region is also renown for the Vermentino wine.\n\nCosta Paradiso near Paduledda.\n\nIsola Rossa.\n\nStarting from Costa Paradiso the stage mostly covers the same roads as did the 2017's stage 1 with some small changes in Costa Smeralda (generally i'm closer to the coast). I didn't realized, but said stage also reached Olbia from northeast, so it is more than possible to recreate the finish from 2017. On the map you may see a different (slightly uphill) finish on Viale Aldo Moro but i guess the 2017 is also an option.\n\nSpiaggia di Li Cossi, Costa Paradiso.\n\nOtherwise, i don't think there's too much to talk about so just enjoy the Sardinian coast and it's hidden inside little coves beaches. There may also be an occasional Aragonese coastal tower or a Nuraghi site. Because of how close the northeastern Sardinia is to Corsica the latter can be seen on plenty of occasions.\n\nCosta Paradiso with what i think is Corsica in the background.\n\nThe first larger town on this coast is Santa Teresa Gallura. It's a large seaside resort on Capo Testa peninsula. It's renown for its hidden inside granite coves overcrowded beaches. In the middle ages Capo Testa (then still an island) was a granite mine in control of Pisa. It was used to built the Pisan cathedral and the leaning tower. The town also featured in the 1977 James Bond film „The Spy Who Loved Me”. Santa Teresa Gallura is considered to be one of possible placements of the ancient town of Tibula.\n\nCapo Testa, Santa Teresa Gallura.\n\nStarting from Santa Teresa Gallura the stage enters Costa Smeralda and associated with it Maddalena Islands. This 60 islands archipelago is home to the 2nd Sardinian national park. It's planned the park will extend to include the whole Bonifacio straight, that separates Sardinia and Corsica. Of course the entire Costa Smeralda is possibly the biggest tourist hub of the island and you could spend like 5 lifetimes exploring its granite outcrops and hidden within them beaches.\n\nPunta Capriccioli, Costa Smeralda.\n\nThe first historic naval battle (541-535 BC) on the western part of the Mediterranean Sea, known as the battle of Alalia took place near the coast. It was fought between Greeks and a Phoencian-Etruscian coalition over the control of both Corsica and Sardinia. It was won by the latter with then Greek Corsica captured by the Etruscans.\n\nCapo d'Orso rock formation, Palau, Costa Smeralda.\n\nThe main administrative hub of Costa Smeralda is the town of Arzachena, which is a bit more inland. While the 2017 stage went through the town this time i'm hugging the coast. Arzachena came into prominence in the 60's thanks to an oil fueled containers of green donated by Prince Karim Aga Khan IV. This money went to invest in Costa Smeralda and its bag of luxurious coastal resorts of which the most renown are Palau and Porto Cervo. Before that however the region was quite heavilly fortified from the Aragonese times to WW2 hence the existence of local seaside towers and even entire forts like the Monte Altura fortress.\n\nPorto Cervo, Arzachena.\n\nMonte Altura, Palau.\n\nDuring the Bronze Age the site was heavilly populated, evidenced by plenty of local Nuraghi. The biggest of them is the Li Muri necropolis of the Arzachena Culture dating back to 4000-3000 BC and Nuraghi Malchittu dating back to 2000-1500 BC. The Arzachena Culture is with the Ozieri Culture the oldest civilisation on the island.\n\nLi Muri necropolis, Arzachena.\n\nCala Bitta, Arzachena.\n\nCosta Smeralda stretches down to Porto Rotondo, which is the last town before Olbia. Like Porto Cervo and Palau, Porto Rotondo is yet another 60's creation for socialites to spend their money. Before Porto Rotondo is the only categorised climb of the day – a cat. 4 hill to Abbiadori and the last intermediate sprint (slightly uphill) in the hamlet of Rudalza at the front of Porto Rotondo. Of course the stage stays within the coastline going through Golfo Aranci and Pittulongu (that's a stupid sounding name) before reaching Olbia. The road is mostly covered in relatively low and dense foliege, but when it opens it can show some great views of the coast and it's pink-ish water.\n\nPorto Rotondo.\n\nOlbia is the historic capital of Gallura and one of the biggest cities on the island. The city was founded by Phoencians in VI-V c. BC, soon to be repopulated by Greeks and later Romans. Throughout the history the town had a number of iterations – Olbia in the antiquity (one of the biggest Mediterranean ports at the time), Pausania in early middle ages, Cività in later middle ages (capital of the Giudicato di Gallura), then a small village of Terranova and starting from XIX c. the modern Olbia (which experienced an economic boom in the 60's thanks to Costa Smeralda). The decline during the upper middle ages was caused by the Aragonese conquer of the island, when the sea trade (Olbia was always heavily reliant on it) was interrupted with sea traffic changing in favour of Murcian and Catalan ports. People either moved to Corsica or inland to work on the granite and silver mines.\n\nOlbia.\n\nThe main sights include various local Nuraghic sites like su Monte de s'Aba, the Phoencian archaelogical site with the remains of city walls on Via Torino, plenty of Roman remains with an aqueduct, XI c. Basilica San Simplicio and the remains of XII c. Castello Pedres – former seat of the Judge of Gallura. Of course Olbia was the finish to 2017 Giro's stage 1, but also the grande partenza to Giro 1991 with the first stage won by Philippe Casado.\n\nBasilica San Simplicio, Olbia.\n\nCastello Pedres, Olbia.\n\nThat's the last Sardinian stage. I'm planning a transfer via a ferry to Civitavecchia in Lazio as i think it should be the quickest way to reach the mainland. However, i'm still planning a rest day and a shorter (~150km) stage afterwards to keep the peloton happy. It doesn't mean that the next stage will be a throwaway though.\n\nMy own try at some Italian cobbles... which have no streetview images cause it got deleted and i cannot find any other image... yaaay...\n\nLast stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/253646\n\nGiro d'Italia 2 – stage 4. Civitavecchia – Isola Farnese, 154km, hilly, cobbles.\n\nClimbs:\n\nValico del Sasso – 2,7km, 8,2%, cat. 3, 314m\n\nSanta Nicola x3 – 600m, ~5,5%, no cat. 113m\n\nCobbles:\n\nVia del Casale di Santa Nicola x3 – 600m, ****\n\nI assume the fastest and least problematic transfer from Olbia to the mainland should be via a ferry to Civitavecchia. However, this transfer still should be quite lengthy so i decided to be nice and gave the peloton a shorter stage after the transfer filled rest day (that doesn't mean it will be a throwaway stage though).\n\nThe next two days will be almost exclusively in Lazio. I guess the region won't be happy with this choice. The stage today even finishes on the very edge of Rome and possibly wanders inside some outermost districts of this metropolis. However, i doubt it will be sponsored by Rome but it may give the guys some hotel rooms.\n\nThis stage had two different versions. The first was to have Isola Farnese (itself an Etruscan site) with some other Etruscan archaelogical sites like Tuscania, Tarquinia, Viterbo, Vejano etc. Sadly, the stage turned out to be way over 200km and i want to have more than just one lap around Isola Farnese for one specific reason i will get to later. Next iteration was just above 150km (for me a perfect length) by artificially lengthen the stage by going around Lago Bracciano. It used the climb of Allumiere (of local Monti della Tolfa, part of Monti Sabatini). I only recently changed it after re-checking the stage and discovering a rather bothersome section in Tolfa – a quite narrow and steep descent accompanied by the walls of local buildings and even a short backdrop.\n\nMonti della Tolfa.\n\nIt happens that the Allumiere/Tolfa climb is harder from the other side. Then a seemingly fine descent would lead to a possible finish in Civitavecchia. Combine it with my final choice of Sasso and you could have a potentially interesting hilly finale with two almost back to back cat. 3 climbs near the finish. I admit the Sasso climb (here as Valico del Sasso) is pretty decent. Quite short yet steep (an entire 1km at roughly 10%) with some nice views of the Tyrrhenian Sea. The road is wide and mostly in nice condition. It should be a fine spot to either spark up a breakaway or gain a lot of time as i assume the peloton won't be going too hard. It would be even nicer if i wasn't forced to have a 25km stint on Via Aurelia which is less than desireable, but i deemed it a better option than the descent in Tolfa.\n\nProfile of Sasso.\n\nViews from Sasso.\n\nCivitavecchia is one of the largest cities in Lazio and the main port of Rome with major routes all over the Mediterranean (which also includes Olbia), hence i've chosen it for the mainland depart. The whole stage is in what's known as the Citta Metropolitana di Roma, which you can read as the Rome province. Civitavecchia is seldomly seen in the Giro with departs of 2008's stage 9 to San Vincenzo or 2012's stage 10 to Assisi.\n\nCivitavecchia was founded at the start of II c. by Emperor Trajan as the main harbor for Rome. At the time it was known as Centumcellae. In the middle ages it was a flef of papal states given to a number of noble families (mainly the Vico family, which was controlling a lot of land between Lazio and Tuscany). In IX c. the town was shifted more inland by order of Pope Leo VII after constant threat of Saracen raids. At the time it also changed it's name to Leopoli. For a long time the town had an autonomy but came back to Papacy after the last lord of the city, Giovanni di Vico unsuccessully tried in 1431 to become independent. In 1859 it became part of one of the oldest Italian railways. After the abolishment of the Papal states in 1870 the city became part of the Kingdom of Italy. During the WW2 it was heavlly bombed by the allied forces.\n\nForte Michelangelo, Civitavecchia.\n\nThe city is renown for its ancient port, partly destroyed during WW2, which includes XVI c. Forte Michelangelo, remains of IX-XVI c. city walls. Outside of the port there are also the remains of Roman baths of Terme della Ficoncella and Terme Taurine (founded by Trajan himself).\n\nTerme Taurine, Civitavecchia.\n\nXVI c. city walls on the sea front, Civitavecchia.\n\nThe first 22km are on Via Aurelia (SS01) alongside the coast. It's less than ideal but otherwise i would be forced to some unnecessary shenanigans. I guess it should go really fast as i guess a bunch of people will try to show themselves in the breakaway as it may be a breakaway-friendly day. The peloton will leave Via Aurelia in Furbara – a small hamlet that's home to a military airport. It's part of the town of Cerveteri – the first Etruscian site of the day. Back then it was known as Caere. With Tarquinia and Veii (Isola Farnese) it was the most powerful city-state of southern Etruria (modern south Tuscany, Umbria and Lazio). It was also renown for its Bucchero ceramics. Now this Etruscian city is the Necropoli della Banditaccia archaelogical site which with Tarqunia is part of a UNESCO site. This town was located at the top of a hill roughly 6-7km from the coast. It's port was Pyrgi, which now is also an archaelogical site (Santa Severa).\n\nSanta Severa.\n\nNecropoli della Banditaccia.\n\nIn Furbara the peloton will start the only categorised climb of the day to the Reinassance village of Sasso. The climb is preceeded by some false-flat. I'm counting only the last quite steep 2,7km, which are at fairly regular 8,2% (max 12-13%). The road is wide and in fine condition. The climb can provide some nice views of the Tyrrhenian Sea. There's almost no descent and in actuality there's more uphill that leads towards the outskrt of Manzana and Bracciano in the middle of Monti Sabatini. Worth mentioning is a protected sulphurous wetland Caldara di Manziana between Sasso and Bracciano.\n\nXVI c. Chiesa Santa Croce, Sasso.\n\nCaldara di Manziana.\n\nManziana is sort of a new iteration of Monterano. Slightly to the west of where the village is right now are the remains of it's previous location that was burned down by the Napoleon's army in 1798 when establishing a puppet state of Roman Republic, which replaced the Papal States for roughly a year. Also neighboring Tolfa and Allumiere were burned down during the same campaign. Monterano started its life by the inhabitants of Forum Clodii right after the fall of the Roman Empire. Forum Clodii was a post and a trade hub on nearby Via Clodia. Throughout the middle ages it was a flef of the Papal states given to various families (in this case Orsini and Altieri). From that time is the XII-XIII c. complex of Palazzo Ducale and Cattedrale di Santa Maria Assunta.\n\nPalazzo Ducale di Monterano.\n\nThe region of Lazio is well known for it's formerly volcanic (last activity before 40000 BC), low-height mountains (mostly below 1k altitude) like Monti Cimini, Monti Volsini, Monti Lepini and Monti Sabatini. Such mountain ranges are also often home to sizeable post-volcanic lakes like Lago Bolsena, Lago Vico or today's Lago Bracciano. To gain a little bit of distance i decided to almost encircle Lago Bracciano using its coastal SP4 and SP12 roads. Main towns on the coast of Lago Bracciano are Bracciano, Trevignano Romano and Anguillara Sabazia.\n\nLago Bracciano.\n\nI may have a large problem with Lago Bracciano as apparently it serves as a water reservoir for Rome, so the water quality is critical and a large peloton with flying bidons and other trash could interrupt the equilibrium. But then on the other side i doubt Isola Farnese will ever be on the Giro map so who gives i guess. Interestingly, Lago Bracciano was serving water to the metropolis since the ancient Rome by the Aqua Traiana aqueduct, which was in use up to XVII c.\n\nBracciano.\n\nThe lake is guarded by a well preserved coastal Castello Orsini-Odescalchi of Bracciano, which now is mainly a party and a wedding site for them rich heads. Bracciano was founded in XI c. by the Vico family (at the time rulers of Civitavecchia) and later belonged to the Orsini family. Of course at the time the region was part of the Papal states. In the early stages of the XVI c. Italian Wars the town housed the French army of Charles VIII, which then resulted in the Papal army besieging and destroying the city. Besides the castle also worth mentioning is a rural IX c. Chiesa di San Liberato founded on top of aforementioned Forum Clodii and also nearby remains of Roman baths Aquae Apollinaris. In nearby Vigna di Valle there's also an Italian Air Force Museum, which was a former seaplane military base.\n\nTrevignano Romano.\n\nThe next roughly 35km are around the Bracciano lake. This detour includes the towns of Trevignano Romano and Anguillara Sabazia, where the race will leave the lake and head straight towards Isola Farnese. Both towns are of Etruscian origin. It's believed that Trevignano was the VII-VI c. Etruscian city of Sabate. The town is also home to the ruins of a XIII c. castle founded by the Orsini family. Nearby Anguillara Sabazia is a neolithic village of La Marmotta, that's now buried within the lake. It dates back to about 8000 BC, when the lake was much smaller. There are also some remains of a Roman villa (Mura di Santo Stefano) on Via Clodia. In the early middle ages it was used as a church before falling into disrepair in XVII c.\n\nAnguillara Sabazia.\n\nMura di Santo Stefano, Anguillara Sabazia.\n\nIsola Farnese is a medieval village created by the Orsini family and a possible iteration of the Etruscan and Roman city of Veio. It is home to a XIII c. manor house Castello Farnese, first in possesion of the Orsini family and since XVII c. the Farnese family (later linked with Savoy). Nearby the town are the remains of an Etruscan city of Veii (or Veio).\n\nCastello Farnese.\n\nI think Veio was the southernmost purely Etruscan city, basically adjacent to Rome. It was founded at around IX-VIII c. BC and basically since the beginning it was going head to head with Rome. Despite the proximity to Rome it was besieged only in IV c. BC. However, after that the town declined and was abandoned after the fall of the Roman Empire. Before that it was one of the biggest Etruscan cities. Even the Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus (I c. BC) compared it to Athens. It was renown for its sculpturing school (Vulca) and dedicated to Minerva Portonaccio temple, which was home to the Etruscan terracotta sculpture Apollo di Veio. It was most probably authored by Vulca, the only Etruscan sculptor to be known by name. With that Apollo sculpture the remans of other sculptures (Hercules, Leto etc.) were also excavated. The archaelogical site is also home to Tomba Campana, home to one of the oldest known Etruscan frescoes.\n\nTerracota sculptures of Apollo and Hercules from Veio.\n\nFrom Isola Farnese the stage goes south on Via della Storta. After leaving Via della Storta near Villaggio San Giuseppe (part of the Roman metropolitian area) the race gets really, really tricky with some very up and down stuff. While on the profile it looks relatively flat in reality it's definitely not. The first part on Via Rivoli is not too bad width-wise but already the road surface is not the best. After a short downhill followed by a short uphill the race enters what's possibly the outermost part of Rome, where the race turns to Via Cherasco and later Via Ceva. With each turn the road gets narrower while still being quite bumpy. The culmination is on Via del Casale di San Nicola.\n\nArchaelogical site of Veio, Isola Farnese.\n\nVia del Casale di Santa Nicola is cobbled, not dirt. Sadly, it seems plenty of newer streetview images in Italy were deleted so now it's left as just a random dirt track (2008), but i remember it having relatively varied, put rather haphazardly (sort of mosaic like as Italy isn't renown for typical rectangular cobbles) quadrangular cobbles and i think it was quite rough. I tried to find some images of the road but either there aren't any, my very basic knowledge of Italian prevents me from finding it or i just suck at searching (most probable). This section is roughly 600m long. It's also uphill, at roughly 5,5% (max 7-9%). Because it's just 600m i decided to race it 3 times to maybe generate a somewhat visible impact on the race.\n\nThis section ends in the hilltop village of San (Santa?) Nicola, roughly 7km from the finish line. While the roads are now once again surfaced and mostly flat they're still quite narrow. The quality of the surface is ok with a small part that as of 2017 is rather horrific (maybe it's repaired?). I'm not sure if it's the same village but it seems lately there were some sort of an anti-immigration tensions in San Nicola so i hope there won't be any blockings on the road Tour de France style.\n\nOther rather complicated point of this lap is the merge with SP493 (Via Braccianense), 3,3km before the finish. It's hard to describe it as it's a mess that you need to see it by yourself. The run-in to the finish line, which is on Via Cassia leads through SP493, then under a local railway and Via Vincenzo Tieri.\n\nI don't know if this lap south of Isola Farnese is more crash or puncture prone. This short cobbled stint could also bring some scare to the smaller guys but i don't think the time loss (if there are any) will be signficant. However, i hope it will be a fine enough replacement for lack of a dirt road stage... the guys will be dealing with dirt roads in the future and it's not the last time they will be flirting with cobbles either. I tried to make this race as interesting for you as i could.\n\nFour climbs and every one of them a different category. Probably the first stage to result in a proper GC selection.\n\nLast stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/246536\n\nGiro d'Italia 2 – stage 5. Rieti – Monte Livata. Campo dell'Osso, 177km, mountain, MTF.\n\nClimbs:\n\nValico di Monte Bove – 13km, 4,2%, cat. 3, 1200m\n\nValico di Petrella – 8,6km, 3,7%, cat. 4, 1082m\n\nPasso Serra Sant'Antonio – 15km, 6%, cat. 2, 1561m\n\nMonte Livata – 18,2km, 6,3% (max 14-16%), cat. 1, 1550m\n\nMonti Simbruini should be quite well known to you, mainly because it's the main ski center of Lazio and because of Campocatino. There are at least two possible MTFs in the same range and those are Monte Livata and Santuario Vallepietra. Below is a quick comparison of these sites:\n\nCampocatino – 18km, 6,2%\n\nMonte Livata – 18,2km, 6,3% (via Subiaco)\n\nVallepietra – 14,2km, 5,3%\n\nProfile of Campocatino.\n\nProfile of Vallepietra.\n\nI hope you see, why i've chosen Monte Livata. I've had Campo dell'Osso in the corner of my eye since my first Giro (the stage to Avezzano). Actually this stage does repeat some stuff from that particular stage but in reverse. In terms of pure difficulty Livata is a less regular Campocatino and it's definitely harder than Vallepietra. Yet, it's not that hard so the entire race shouldn't be decided already on stage 5. There may be two other MTFs open for use – Campo Staffi (just above Serra Sant'Antonio) and similar to Livata Campaegli, but they don't have too much free space available unlike the main three sites. There are also some obscure ski resorts on the other side of the chain but i will present them later down the road.\n\nMonti Simbruini.\n\nWhile i'm sort of happy with what i've managed to get, the stage's design is very clunky. It features a relatively small stint in Abruzzo (next stage will be entirely in that region) and a very small stnt in the province of Frosinone just to have Serra Sant'Antonio, which is the only \"useable\" pass of Monti Simbruini. I could move the start to something like Monterotondo, but i had problems with designing the stage that way (stages were too short for my liking and i didn't wanted to block Via Salaria as the parallel SP40 seems to be in an awful state) and i didn't wanted to have two full days in Lazio, as i doubt the region would be particulary happy with me.\n\nMonti Sabini.\n\nOn the other hand the start is in Rieti because i really wanted to have Monti Sabini and it's picturesque artificial lakes Lago del Turano and Lago del Salto (created in 1939). This stage will only pass by Lago Turano but the heli should have no problems"
