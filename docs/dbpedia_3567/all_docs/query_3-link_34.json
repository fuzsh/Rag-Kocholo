        "text": "Sardinian cuisine is very old and diversified. It can mix meat specialties with fish ones, as it originated from both agriculture and fishing. Moreover, it was influenced by other cultures as well, because many civilizations lived there throughout history.\n\nFor this reason, Sardinian food is very easy and delicious, as it mixed the different influences with the ingredients from the territory.\n\nIn this article, you will find a series of typical dishes in Sardinia, which you have to eat during your stay on the island.\n\nPane Carasau\n\nPane Carasau, meaning tosted bread, is one of the main elements of Sardinian cuisine, as well as the most representative one. It is made with flour, water, salt, and yeast. They are mixed in a particular way, as in the past, Pane Carasau was cooked by all the family members in a moment of gathering together.\n\nIt is probably one of the most famous Sardinian food: bread sheets, very thin but very tasty, which serve as the base for many traditional Sardinian dishes.\n\nPane Frattau\n\nPane Frattau is one of the Sardinian dishes that are prepared with Pane Carasau. It originates from agricultural contexts, as it was made with crumbles of pane carasau. Those small crumbles were boiled in sheep broth, then dressed with tomato sauce and poached egg. Finally, covered with Sardinian pecorino cheese (pecorino sardo).\n\nPane salìtu chin bagna\n\nPane salìtu chin bagna is another recipe that is made with pane carasau, which can look like a lasagna. The thin slices are treated as if they were lasagna sheets and filled with tomato sauce and Sardinian pecorino cheese.\n\nIspinadas\n\nIspinadas is a dish of a rural origin, as shepherds mainly ate it when they were working. It consists of meat skewers with small dimensions. They had to be small, in order to be easy to cook: in that way, shepherds did not have to light up a big fire to cook them.\n\nCulurgiones\n\nCulurgiones are a typical Sardinian pasta, which is filled. They have a long shape that resembles the ear of wheat, and they are usually filled with potatoes, mint, and Sardinian pecorino cheese.

According to one of the traditions, the future bride had to walk down the road with a basket of Malloreddus to distribute.\n\nUsually, they are prepared with ragout and Sardinian pecorino cheese.\n\nZuppa Gallurese\n\nZuppa Gallurese is, as the name suggests, typical of Gallura, the Northern part of Sardinia. It's a dish made with bread, sheep broth, and cheese: the ingredients are very easy but they give a unique taste to this dish.\n\nIts origin is very antique, it probably dates back to the Middle Ages, when the term \"soup\" used to indicate every recipe that included bread in broth.\n\nPanadas\n\nPanadas are one of the pieces of evidence of Spanish influences on Sardinian culture. In fact, they come from the Spanish empanadas.\n\nPanadas consist of a wrap of pasta, which is usually filled with lamb meat and potatoes.\n\nPane Guttiau\n\nPane Guttiau is another recipe whose base consists of pane carasau. It is realized with oil, rosmary, and myrtle leaves.\n\nSardinian suckling pig\n\nProceddu (the Sardinian suckling pig) is one of the Sardinian cuisine's most famous second courses. Usually, it's positioned on a spit and slowly cooked. It's only half-salted, as the rind stays crunchy and the meat stays soft. Then, it is served with spices such as saffron, black pepper, thyme and mint.\n\nSeadas\n\nSeadas is a typical Sardinian dessert, which is also part of the agricultural tradition. They consist in two slices of fresh pasta, which are filled with fresh cheese and lemon. Then, they are fried and covered with honey.\n\nTake a look at our homes to live the best of Sardinia and taste the delicacies of the island.\n\nOctober 12th, 2022"
