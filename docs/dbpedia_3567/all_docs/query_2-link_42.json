        "text": "Yacht Club Lakkios\n\nVHF ch: 74\n\nTel. H24: +39.0931/463606\n\nhttp://www.yachtclublakkios.com/\n\nIn Porto Marmoreo (Porto Piccolo). Shallow harbour, but 3m+ depth on our berth and the centre channel (don’t go into the empty space just south of the entrance though). You will be guided in by RIB, so no problem. Pontoon is attached to the NW end of the canal that separates the old town. Berths stern/bows-to with laid lines. Mooring assistance. They seem to prefer phone contact over VHF (something we’ve found common in Italy so far). Not a lot of free space, was full in mid-September, but we waited a night at anchor in Porto Grande just south and something freed up.\n\nVery convenient for seeing the town, as you’re right in the middle of it, on the canal that separates the old town (Ortigia) from new Siracusa. Wifi (5 GHz only) and water (1500 ppm! Siracusa’s tap water has a problem with salt ingress into the water table) and electricity on the pontoon. Efficient office staff with good English. Laundry nearby at “Wash and Dry Siracusa”. Showers/toilets are on the other side of the canal, a bit of a walk across the bridge. Security gate and night guard (Antonio and his dog).\n\nShelter in Porto Marmoreo is fair, but some surge in NE winds. Berthing fees €75 per night for the 12m boat discounted to €62.50 for a 4-night stay. Cash only! Check out the fantastic market in Ortigia in the morning, then come back after sunset to walk around the pretty old town. Do try the Paninoteca (food van) right outside the marina – very tasty and not expensive.\n\nSeveral large supermarkets on Via Elorina – but beware, dangerous to walk in traffic due to the missing sidewalk.\n\nJuly 2017: As stated above, call the port authorities on VHF Ch. 11 prior to entering the harbour. They will ask your intentions and you have 3 choices: anchor, marina or public quay.\n\nIf you select the public quay they will assign a number to dock at. These spots are free for up to 5 days, except for a 10 euro mandatory garbage collection fee collected between 8 and 9 each morning.\n\nThere is no power or water nor lazy lines. These slots are huge, 20 meters wide, and obviously made for large superyachts.\n\nAfter docking, one must check in at the port authorities’ office.\n\nThere are the usual noises associated with a public quay, people walking by, taking pictures, a coffee bar plays music till mid-evening.\n\nIt is strangely quiet, however. On July 7th there were five sailboats and two 20 meter yachts docked at the public quay.\n\nThe marina seems to have plenty of room and there are only 12 boats at anchor.\n\nWe have been in Siracusa, visitors can go for free to the Grand Harbour, bow or stern to with anchor. No electricity, water from a tap (free) one can stay for 5 days, after that you have to move, but if you come back after a few days, the 5 days counting starts again. Only when a cruise ship is coming to the quay has to be free, but one can easily go for an anchor in the big bay with good holding. We where there in August 2013"
