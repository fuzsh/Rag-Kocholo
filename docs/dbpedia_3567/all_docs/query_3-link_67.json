Thus, 27 CFR 1.1 refers to title 27, part 1, section 1. ---------------------------------------------------------- [[Page v]] EXPLANATION The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows: Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1 Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1 Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1 Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1 The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume. LEGAL STATUS The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510). HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule. To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text. OMB CONTROL NUMBERS The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. [[Page vi]] Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. OBSOLETE PROVISIONS Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949- 1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law. What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are: (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register. (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process. (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume. What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 20408, or call (202) 523-4534. CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume. An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within that volume. The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register. [[Page vii]] A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles. REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms--Table of Contents 27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7--Table of Contents [Notice No. 459] Ingredient Labeling of Wine, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages--Table of Contents AGENCY: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Treasury. ACTION: Reinstatement of Treasury Decision ATF-66. SUMMARY: This notice announces the Treasury Department's reinstatement of the ingredient labeling regulations as originally promulgated in T.D. ATF-66 (45 FR 40538; June 13, 1980). The Treasury Department and ATF are making this announcement pursuant to the order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, in Center for Science in the Public Interest v. Department of the Treasury, Civil Action No. 82- 610. By order dated February 8, 1983, the court vacated and set aside T.D. ATF-94, 46 FR 55093 (November 6, 1981) which rescinded T.D. ATF-66. This document requires ingredient labeling of alcoholic beverages after February 8, 1984. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 11, 1983. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Imelda M. Koett Kirk, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, P.O. Box 385, Washington, DC 20044-0385, 202-566-7806. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Treasury Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are announcing that T.D. ATF-66, 45 FR 40538 (June 13, 1980), requiring ingredient labeling of alcoholic beverages will be mandatory on February 8, 1984. The Treasury Department and ATF are making this announcement pursuant to the order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, in Center for Science in the Public Interest v. Department of the Treasury, Civil Action No. 82-610. By order dated February 8, 1983, the court vacated and set aside T.D. ATF-94, 46 FR 55093 (November 6, 1981) which rescinded T.D. ATF-66. The court further ordered the Department to announce within 30 days a new date, not to exceed one year from the date of its order, upon which T.D. ATF-66 will be mandatory. The Government subsequently moved the court to amend its order to allow the Government 60 days in which to announce a new effective date so that the Government could decide whether to appeal before announcing a new mandatory compliance date. This motion was denied. Publication of this notice is without prejudice to, and not a waiver of, the Government's right to appeal the district court's decision, seek a stay of the court mandated effective date of T.D. ATF-66 or take other appropriate administrative action. Such appeal, stay, or other action which the Government is still considering could result in a change in the mandatory date. Signed: March 8, 1983. Stephen E. Higgins, Acting Director. Approved: March 9, 1983. David Q. Bates, Acting Assistant Secretary (Enforcement and Operations).

The standards of identity for the several classes and types of wine set forth [[Page 16]] herein shall be applicable to all regulations and permits issued under the act. Whenever any term for which a standard of identity has been established herein is used in any such regulation or permit, such term shall have the meaning assigned to it by such standard of identity. Sec. 4.21 The standards of identity. Standards of identity for the several classes and types of wine set forth in this part shall be as follows: (a) Class 1; grape wine--(1) Grape wine is wine produced by the normal alcoholic fermentation of the juice of sound, ripe grapes (including restored or unrestored pure condensed grape must), with or without the addition, after fermentation, of pure condensed grape must, and with or without added grape brandy or alcohol, but without other addition or abstraction except as may occur in cellar treatment: Provided, That the product may be ameliorated before, during or after fermentation by either of the following methods: (i) By adding, separately or in combination, dry sugar, or such an amount of sugar and water solution as will not increase the volume of the resulting product more than 35 percent; but in no event shall any product so ameliorated have an alcoholic content derived by fermentation, of more than 13 percent by volume, or a natural acid content, if water has been added, of less than 5 parts per thousand, or a total solids content of more than 22 grams per 100 cubic centimeters. (ii) By adding, separately or in combination, not more than 20 percent by weight of dry sugar, or not more than 10 percent by weight of water. (iii) In the case of domestic wine, in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 5383. (iv) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and exclusive of sulfur dioxide is 0.14 gram per 100 mL (20 deg.C) for natural red wine and 0.12 gram per 100 mL (20 deg.C) for other grape wine: Provided, That the maximum volatile acidity for wine produced from unameliorated juice of 28 or more degrees Brix is 0.17 gram per 100 milliliters for red wine and 0.15 gram per 100 milliliters for white wine. Grape wine deriving its characteristic color or lack of color from the presence or absence of the red coloring matter of the skins, juice, or pulp of grapes may be designated as ``red wine,'' ``pink (or rose) wine,'' ``amber wine,'' or ``white wine'' as the case may be. Any grape wine containing no added grape brandy or alcohol may be further designated as ``natural.'' (2) Table wine is grape wine having an alcoholic content not in excess of 14 percent by volume. Such wine may also be designated as ``light wine,'' ``red table wine,'' ``light white wine,'' ``sweet table wine,'' etc., as the case may be. (3) Dessert wine is grape wine having an alcoholic content in excess of 14 percent but not in excess of 24 percent by volume. Dessert wine having the taste, aroma and characteristics generally attributed to sherry and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, of not less than 17 percent by volume, may be designated as ``sherry''. Dessert wines having the taste, aroma and characteristics generally attributed to angelica, madeira, muscatel and port and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, of not less than 18 percent by volume, may be designated as ``angelica,'' ``madeira,'' ``muscatel,'' or ``port'' respectively. Dessert wines having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to any of the above products and an alcoholic content, derived in part from added grape brandy or alcohol, in excess of 14 percent by volume but, in the case of sherry, less than 17 percent, or, in other cases, less than 18 percent by volume, may be designated as ``light sherry,'' ``light angelica,'' ``light madeira,'' ``light muscatel'' or ``light port,'' respectively. (b) Class 2; sparkling grape wine. (1) Sparkling grape wine (including ``sparkling wine,'' ``sparkling red wine'' and ``sparkling white wine'') is grape wine made effervescent with carbon dioxide resulting solely from the fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank or bottle. (2) Champagne is a type of sparkling light wine which derives its effervescence solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within glass [[Page 17]] containers of not greater than one gallon capacity, and which possesses the taste, aroma, and other characteristics attributed to champagne as made in the champagne district of France. (3)(i) A sparkling light wine having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to champagne but not otherwise conforming to the standard for ``champagne'' may, in addition to but not in lieu of the class designation ``sparkling wine,'' be further designated as: (A) ``champagne style;'' or (B) ``champagne type;'' or (C) ``American (or New York State, Napa Valley, etc.) champagne,'' along with one of the following terms: ``Bulk process,'' ``fermented outside the bottle,'' ``secondary fermentation outside the bottle,'' ``secondary fermentation before bottling,'' ``not fermented in the bottle,'' or ``not bottle fermented.'' The term ``charmat method'' or ``charmat process'' may be used as additional information. (ii) Labels shall be so designed that all the words in such further designation are readily legible under ordinary conditions and are on a contrasting background. In the case of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section, ATF will consider whether the label as a whole provides the consumer with adequate information about the method of production and origin of the wine. ATF will evaluate each label for legibility and clarity, based on such factors as type size and style for all components of the further designation and the optional term ``charmat method'' or ``charmat process,'' as well as the contrast between the lettering and its background, and the placement of information on the label. (iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A), (B) and (C) of this section, the Director may authorize the use of a term on sparkling wine labels, as an alternative to those terms authorized in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, but not in lieu of the required class designation ``sparkling wine,'' upon a finding that such term adequately informs the consumer about the method of production of the sparkling wine. (4) Crackling wine, petillant wine, frizzante wine (including cremant, perlant, reciotto, and other similar wine) is sparkling light wine normally less effervescent than champagne or other similar sparkling wine, but containing sufficient carbon dioxide in solution to produce, upon pouring under normal conditions, after the disappearance of air bubbles, a slow and steady effervescence evidenced by the formation of gas bubbles flowing through the wine. Crackling wine which derives its effervescence from secondary fermentation in containers greater than 1-gallon capacity shall be designated ``crackling wine-- bulk process,'' and the words ``bulk process'' shall appear in lettering of substantially the same size as the words ``crackling wine.'' (c) Class 3; carbonated grape wine. ``Carbonated grape wine'' (including ``carbonated wine'' ``carbonated red wine,'' and ``carbonated white wine'') is grape wine made effervescent with carbon dioxide other than that resulting solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank or bottle. (d) Class 4; citrus wine. (1)(i) Citrus wine or citrus fruit wine is wine produced by the normal alcoholic fermentation of the juice of sound, ripe citrus fruit (including restored or unrestored pure condensed citrus must), with or without the addition, after fermentation, of pure condensed citrus must, and with or without added citrus brandy or alcohol, but without any other addition or abstraction except as may occur in cellar treatment: Provided, That a domestic product may be ameliorated or sweetened in accordance with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5384 and any product other than domestic may be ameliorated before, during, or after fermentation by adding, separately or in combination, dry sugar, or such an amount of sugar and water solution as will not increase the volume of the resulting product more than 35 percent, but in no event shall any product so ameliorated have an alcoholic content, derived by fermentation, of more than 13 percent by volume, or a natural acid content, if water has been added, of less than 5 parts per thousand, or a total solids content of more than 22 grams per 100 cubic centimeters. [[Page 18]] (ii) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and exclusive of sulfur dioxide, shall not be, for natural citrus wine, more than 0.14 gram, and for other citrus wine, more than 0.12 gram, per 100 milliliters (20 deg.C.). (iii) Any citrus wine containing no added brandy or alcohol may be further designated as ``natural.'' (2) Citrus table wine or citrus fruit table wine is citrus wine having an alcoholic content not in excess of 14 percent by volume. Such wine may also be designated ``light citrus wine,'' ``light citrus fruit wine,'' ``light sweet citrus fruit wine,'' etc., as the case may be. (3) Citrus dessert wine or citrus fruit dessert wine is citrus wine having an alcoholic content in excess of 14 percent but not in excess of 24 percent by volume. (4) Citrus wine derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from one kind of citrus fruit, shall be designated by the word ``wine'' qualified by the name of such citrus fruit, e.g., ``orange wine,'' ``grapefruit wine.'' Citrus wine not derived wholly from one kind of citrus fruit shall be designated as ``citrus wine'' or ``citrus fruit wine'' qualified by a truthful and adequate statement of composition appearing in direct conjunction therewith. Citrus wine rendered effervescent by carbon dioxide resulting solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank, or bottle shall be further designated as ``sparkling''; and citrus wine rendered effervescent by carbon dioxide otherwise derived shall be further designated as ``carbonated.'' (e) Class 5; fruit wine. (1)(i) Fruit wine is wine (other than grape wine or citrus wine) produced by the normal alcoholic fermentation of the juice of sound, ripe fruit (including restored or unrestored pure condensed fruit must), with or without the addition, after fermentation, of pure condensed fruit must, and with or without added fruit brandy or alcohol, but without other addition or abstraction except as may occur in cellar treatment: Provided, That a domestic product may be ameliorated or sweetened in accordance with the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 5384 and any product other than domestic may be ameliorated before, during, or after fermentation by adding, separately or in combination, dry sugar, or such an amount of sugar and water solution as will increase the volume of the resulting product, in the case of wines produced from loganberries, currants, or gooseberries, having a normal acidity of 20 parts or more per thousand, not more than 60 percent, and in the case of other fruit wines, not more than 35 percent, but in no event shall any product so ameliorated have an alcoholic content, derived by fermentation, of more than 13 percent by volume, or a natural acid content, if water has been added, of less than 5 parts per thousand, or a total solids content of more than 22 grams per 100 cubic centimeters. (ii) The maximum volatile acidity, calculated as acetic acid and exclusive of sulfur dioxide, shall not be, for natural fruit wine, more than 0.14 gram, and for other fruit wine, more than 0.12 gram, per 100 milliliters (20 deg.C.). (iii) Any fruit wine containing no added brandy or alcohol may be further designated as ``natural.'' (2) Berry wine is fruit wine produced from berries. (3) Fruit table wine or berry table wine is fruit or berry wine having an alcoholic content not in excess of 14 percent by volume. Such wine may also be designated ``light fruit wine,'' or ``light berry wine.'' (4) Fruit dessert wine or berry dessert wine is fruit or berry wine having an alcoholic content in excess of 14 percent but not in excess of 24 percent by volume. (5) Fruit wine derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from one kind of fruit shall be designated by the word ``wine'' qualified by the name of such fruit, e.g., ``peach wine,'' ``blackberry wine.'' Fruit wine not derived wholly from one kind of fruit shall be designated as ``fruit wine'' or ``berry wine,'' as the case may be, qualified by a truthful and adequate statement of composition appearing in direct conjunction therewith. Fruit wines which are derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from apples or pears may be designated ``cider'' and ``perry,'' respectively, and shall be so designated if lacking in vinous taste, aroma, and characteristics.
