        "text": "Airports in Italy\n\nItaly has pretty good airport coverage, though its airports aren’t scattered evenly across the country. On this page you’ll find a list of airports in Italy, along with public transport connections and suggestions for nearby holiday destinations, with links to fuller articles on the airports and on the destinations where available. For now I’ve concentrated on airports with direct flights from the UK and Ireland, although there are often route changes and there are a few other airports which can be reached by changing to an internal flight. Although I’ve suggested airlines flying between the UK and Ireland and each airport, it’s not an exhaustive list as routes are subject to change each year. You can find the latest flight timetables and routes for each destination by visiting the official airport website – bear in mind that many routes are seasonal or summer-only.\n\nAlternatively you may prefer to browse by holiday destination, reading our tourism articles which contain information on the nearest airports and transport links. Or you might want to read more about the budget airlines operating from the UK and Ireland to Italy, and the local airports they fly from.\n\n> Browse by destination\n\n> More about cheap flights and budget airlines\n\nNames of Italian airports\n\nItalian airports often have a surprising number of names or descriptions. Ryanair give airports their own names depending on the nearest big destination (e.g. Milan Bergamo for what is actually Bergamo Airport). Then there is the most common name, describing the principal destination (e.g. Brescia Airport / Aeroporto di Brescia). Usually there is also an official name which typically commemorates a local historical figure (e.g. Marco Polo in Venice). Finally, you will occasionally hear the name of the specific locality. I’ve tried to include all variations on the airports’ names and descriptions, along with their IATA (International Air Transport Association) code.\n\nPublic transport information\n\nI’ve listed direct airport transport connections; but travellers should check the latest timetables via the airport’s official websites – sometimes airport bus services are very limited, although they do generally coincide with flights. Most airports in Italy aren’t on the railway network, but there is usually a bus service into the nearest town which will stop by the train station. In most airports there is a public transport information stand which will provide information and sell tickets (you usually have to buy tickets before boarding a bus in Italy). Join the queue as quickly as you can, ahead of your fellow-travellers. It helps if you’ve done your research and know what you need. If there is no information office or ticket-vending machine, look around for a news-stand – these are often sources of information and tickets.\n\nAlghero\n\nAirport: Aeroporto di Alghero Riviera del Corallo.
