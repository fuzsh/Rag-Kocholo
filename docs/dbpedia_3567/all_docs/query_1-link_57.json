        "text": "In modern times, several capable and willing local authors have published collections of \"contos de 'foghile\", collecting as many myths and legends as possible, having them recounted by the last keepers of these \"oral treasures\": elderly people, often part of the large group of Sardinian centenarians. Unfortunately, it is not possible to collect all the Sardinian legends and folk tales, which will inevitably fall into oblivion.\n\nA legend that we think is very interesting was written with great narrative skill by the sharp writer Gianmichele Lisai. It is part of the wonderful collection of myths and legends about Sardinia called \"101 stories about Sardinia, that you have never been told\". We have paraphrased the legend of Torco, hero of Sandalia. The links to ancient Greek myths are obvious:\n\nBefore civilization developed in Sardinia, Torco protected the ancient island from attacks by enemies from the sea, who intended to conquer and plunder it. Son of Neptune, God of the sea, Torco was gifted with a legendary strength and a great connoisseur of seafaring art. Tireless, he watched the coasts of Sardinia aboard a boat made of reeds. It was him who noticed that the island had the shape of a sandal, baptizing it precisely \"Sandalia\". Torco clashed several times with the powerful Atlante, commander of the Mediterranean pirates from the coasts of Africa. The bloody battles between Torco's and Atlante's crews always ended in the same way: Sandalia's brave soldiers, led by Torco, had the upper hand.\n\nOver the years, even Torco aged, despite his divine origins. Atlante, in full vigor, decided to take advantage of Torco's physical decay, to launch the definitive attack. He placed himself at the head of all the pirate crews of Africa, which he led to the coasts of Sandalia to carry out its conquest. Here an epic battle took place between the two armies of the sea. The pirates were in surplus, and at various stages of the battle they managed to land on Sandalia. Despite the numerical inferiority, Torco and his valiant men always managed to repel the invaders and even took over, until a nefarious event overturned the fate of the battle. Atlante's ship rammed Torco's fragile boat, which sank into the sea depths with all the crew. The inhabitants of the island fell into despair, because without the brave leader they defenseless against the pirates.\n\nNeptune's intervention was providential. He saved his lifeless son by blowing the spirit of the sea into his mouth, to turn him into a merman: half man and half fish. Torco acquired the ability to swim as agile and fast as a fish. With renewed determination and strength he placed himself at the head of the army of mermen, with whom he surrounded the pirate ships. By vigorous movements of the tails they caused high waves, which shattered the boats of the invaders, causing them to be shipwrecked. Once again the island was saved thanks to its hero."
