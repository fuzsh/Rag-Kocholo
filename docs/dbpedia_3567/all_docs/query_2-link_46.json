Yes, the sand really is that white, and the sea the bluest blue. Imagine dropping anchor in Costa Smeralda’s scalloped bays, where celebrities and supermodels frolic in emerald waters; playing castaway on the Golfo di Orosei’s coves, or sailing to La Maddalena’s cluster of granite islands. Whether you’re walking barefoot across the dunes on the wave-lashed Costa Verde or lounging on the Costa del Sud’s silky smooth bays, unroll your beach towel and you’ll never want to leave. Outdoor Adventures Whether you go slow or fast, choose coast or country, Sardinia is one of Europe’s last great island adventures. Hike through the lush, silent interior to the twilight of Tiscali’s nuraghic ruins. Walk the vertiginous coastal path to the crescent-shaped bay of Cala Luna. Or ramble through holm oak forests to the mighty boulder-strewn canyon of Gola Su Gorropu. The sea’s allure is irresistible to windsurfers on the north coast, while divers wax lyrical about shipwrecks off Cagliari’s coast, the underwater Nereo Cave and Nora’s submerged Roman ruins. Island of Idiosyncrasies As DH Lawrence so succinctly put it: ‘Sardinia is different’. Indeed, where else but here can you go from near-alpine forests to snow-white beaches, or find wildlife oddities such as the blue-eyed albino donkeys on the Isola dell’Asinara. The island is also a culinary one-off, with distinct takes on pasta, bread and dolci, its own wines and cheeses – including maggoty casu marzu pecorino, stashed away in barns in the mountainous interior. In every way we can think of Sardinia is different, and all the more loveable for it. Time Travel Sardinia has been polished like a pebble by the waves of its history and heritage. The island is scattered with 7000 nuraghi, Bronze Age towers and settlements, tombe dei giganti (‘giant’s grave’ tombs) and domus de janas (‘fairy house’ tombs). Down every country lane and in every 10-man, 100-sheep hamlet, these remnants of prehistory are waiting to be pieced together like the most puzzling of jigsaw puzzles. Sardinia is also an island of fabulously eccentric festivals, from Barbagia’s carnival parade of ghoulish mamuthones, said to banish winter demons, to the death-defying S’Ardia horse race in Sedilo. Welcome to Sardinia Sardinia captivates with its wild hinterland, out-of-this-world beaches and endearing eccentricities. Here coastal drives thrill, prehistory puzzles and four million sheep rule the roads. 4 ©Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd\n\nSTEFANO GARAU/SHUTTERSTOCK © Above: Masua (p73), west coast Why I Love Sardinia By Kerry Christiani, Writer Sardinia was love at first sight for me. No matter how often I return, I find new coastal trails to explore and mountains to climb, hidden bays to kayak to and little-known agriturismi tucked away in the silent hinterland. The island is deceptive – it looks small on paper, but unravel it and it is huge. It’s like a continent in miniature, shaped by its own language and fierce traditions, its own cuisine and culture, its own history and the mystery that hangs over it like a shroud. Sardinians are proud of their island, and so they should be.

Where the mountains collide spectacularly with the sea, this huge, sweeping crescent forms the seaward section of the Parco Nazionale del Golfo di Orosei e del Gennargentu (p191). Set your spirits soaring by hiking its clifftop trails, exploring its sea grottoes in a kayak, or boating along the gulf to hidden coves – each more mind-blowingly beautiful than the last. Tiscali 2 Held hostage in the twilight of a collapsed limestone cave, the archaeological site of Tiscali (p200) is an enigma. Though only skeletal ruins remain, with a little imagination you can picture this nuraghic village as it was back in the Bronze Age. Every bit as enchanting as Tiscali itself is the trail through the lush green valley that takes you there – mighty rock faces loom above you, birds of prey wheel overhead and only the sound of your footsteps interrupts the overwhelming sense of calm that blankets this valley. ZAKAZ86/SHUTTERSTOCK © ELISA LOCCI/SHUTTERSTOCK © 9\n\nIl Castello, Cagliari 3 Perched on a rocky peak, Cagliari’s Il Castello (p43) is never more captivating than at dusk on a warm summer’s evening. Rimmed by imposing ramparts, this hilltop neighbourhood spells out the Sardinian capital’s history in artefacts. As the softening light paints the sky purplepink, the citadel’s walls, palazzi and Pisan towers glow gold. Capture the moment by heading to the laid-back terrace of a bar on the ramparts, where sundowners are served with dress-circle views of the illuminated city. Costa Smeralda 4 Believe the hype: the Costa Smeralda (p155) is stunning. Here the Gallura’s granite mountains tumble down to fjordlike inlets, and an emerald sea fringes a coast that is necklaced with bays like the Aga Khan’s favourite, Spiaggia del Principe, a perfect crescent of frost-white sand smoothed by gin-clear water. Marvel at the mega-yachts in millionaires’ playground resorts, or eschew the high life to seek out secluded coves, embedded in fragrant macchia (Mediterranean scrubland), where the views are simply priceless. ANDY CHRISTIANI/GETTY IMAGES © ELISALOCCI/SHUTTERSTOCK © 3 4 10PLAN YOUR TRIP PLAN YOUR TRIP S A R D I N I A’ S T O P 1 5\n\nGola Su Gorropu 5 The first glimpse of Gola Su Gorropu (p199) on the scenic hike down from the Genna ‘e Silana pass is mesmerising. Dubbed Europe’s Grand Canyon, this mighty ravine boasts 400m-high rock walls and enormous boulders scattered like a giant’s marbles. At its narrowest point – just 4m wide – the gorge seems to swallow you up, blocking out the sun and silencing the world outside. Were it not for the occasional fellow trekker or climber, the chasm would have the eerie effect of seeming totally lost in time and space. Alghero 6 To see Alghero (p114) at its most atmospheric, come in the early evening when crowds fill its maze of dark, medieval lanes and people-watch from the grand cafe terraces on Piazza Civica. Tables are set up along the honeycoloured ramparts, softly lit by lanterns, for al fresco dining with uninterrupted views of the sea and stars. Never mind the expense, you must try Alghero’s famous aragosta alla catalana (lobster with tomato and onion), a lingering taste of the city’s past as a Catalan colony. JANA LAND/SHUTTERSTOCK © VALERY ROKHIN/SHUTTERSTOCK © 5 6 11 PLAN YOUR TRIP PLAN YOUR TRIP S A R D I N I A’ S T O P 1 5\n\nBosa 7 Like many great works of art, Bosa (p106) is best admired from afar. From a distance you can take in the whole picture: the elegant houses in a fresco painter’s palette of colours, the fishing boats bobbing on the Fiume Temo and the medieval Castello Malaspina perched on a steep hillside. Linger until evening to see one of Sardinia’s prettiest towns without the crowds, walking its narrow alleyways and stopping to sample some of the freshest fish on the west coast at family-run restaurants. Nuraghi & Tombe dei Giganti 8 Defensive watchtowers, sacred ritual sites, prehistoric community centres…the exact purpose of Sardinia’s 7000 nuraghi is unknown. Yet the island’s Bronze Age past is still tangible within the semicircular walls of these stone towers and fortified settlements. Most famous and best preserved is the beehive complex of Nuraghe Su Nuraxi (p87), a Unesco World Heritage Site. Equally mysterious are the island’s tombe dei giganti (giants’ tombs), megalithic mass graves sealed off by stone stele. KOJIN/SHUTTERSTOCK © VALERY ROKHIN/SHUTTERSTOCK © 7 8 12PLAN YOUR TRIP Sardinia’s Top 1 5\n\nGrotta di Nettuno 9 Whether you glide in by boat from Alghero or take the vertiginous 654-step staircase that zigzags down 110m of sheer cliff, arriving at the Grotta di Nettuno (p128) is unforgettable. Enter the immense, cathedral-like grotto and it really is as though the forces of Neptune, god of the sea, have been at work. All around you are forests of curiously shaped stalactites and stalagmites, reflected in still pools of water. Nothing – not even the midday crowds – can detract from the magic of this underground fairyland. Hilltop Villages 10You’re lost on a hairpin-bendriddled road in the mountains that seemingly leads to nowhere, and no sat nav, map or passing flock of sheep can help you. But then, suddenly, you crest a hill and a tiny village slides into view, surrounded by titanic mountains and sweeping forests. It happens all the time in Sardinia’s wild Barbagia and Ogliastra provinces. If you’re up for an offbeat adventure, get behind the wheel for a head-spinning drive to gloriously remote villages such as Aritzo (p189), pasted high on a mountain slope. Top right: Castelsardo (p135) Parco Nazionale dell’Asinara 11 Dangling off the northwestern tip of the island in splendid isolation, the rugged green Parco Nazionale dell’Asinara (p130) is one of Sardinia’s greatest coastal wildernesses. The unique asino bianco (albino donkey) is at home in this outstanding national park, as are peregrine falcons, mouflon, wild boar and loggerhead turtles. For close-up wildlife encounters, join one of the guided walking or cycling tours that take in the island’s remote corners. Or go diving in the crystal-clear waters that lap its granite cliffs and dreamy beaches. MNSTUDIO/SHUTTERSTOCK © ELISA LOCCI/SHUTTERSTOCK © STEFANO GUIDI/SHUTTERSTOCK © 9 10 11 13 PLAN YOUR TRIP Sardinia’s Top 1 5\n\nOristano & the Sinis Peninsula 12 One of Sardinia’s great medieval cities is Oristano (p92), the capital of the 14th-century province of Arborea. History seeps through the centre’s baroque lanes and piazzas, presided over by the graceful domed duomo. Slow the pace and follow the locals to the Piazza Eleonora d’Arborea to stroll and chat in front of the ornate palazzi. Or base yourself here to explore the Punic-Roman ruins of Tharros and the snowwhite beaches and birdfilled lagoons of the Sinis Peninsula. Festive Sardinia 13 Be it the deathdefying horse races of S’Ardia or mamuthones (costumed carnival figures) exorcising winter demons in Mamoiada, Sardinians celebrate in weird and wonderful ways. Time your visit to catch standouts like the medieval tournament Sa Sartiglia (p96, pictured above) in Oristano in February, Cagliari’s Festa di Sant’Efisio in May or the folkloric parades of Nuoro’s Sagra del Redentore in August. Hungry? Check out our line-up of seasonal food festivals, where you can indulge in everything from chestnuts to sea urchins. Orgosolo 14 Social commentary, politics, end-of-theworld prophecy – all are writ large on the shabby exteriors of houses and cafes in Orgosolo (p184). Once a byword for banditry, today Orgosolo is an enormous canvas for some of the most emotionally charged graffiti you’ll ever see. Along the Corso Repubblica, vivid murals recall the big events of the 20th and 21st centuries, from the creation of the atomic bomb to the fall of Baghdad – events that seem a million miles away from this small village in the heart of the tough, mountainous Barbagia.

Trawl the interior for farms selling their own pecorino, salami and full-bodied Cannonau red wines; buy artistic-looking loaves and almondy sweets from bak - eries and confectioners in Cagliari and Nuoro; and tuck into a smorgasbord of seafood. Or sample the lot at a rustic agriturismo, such as Li Mori (p154), where your hosts will ply you with course after course, including antipasti and slowroasted suckling pig.

Warm up with two days in Spanish-style, sea-splashed Alghero, unravelling the old town and ramparts, then hop in a boat to head to the cathedral-like Grotta di Nettuno. On day three, wend your way east, pausing for a slice of laid-back village life in Tempio Pausania and forays into prehistory at the nuraghic sites around Arzachena. Wake up at a rural agriturismo in the nearby granite mountains of Gallura, then spend a couple of days lounging on blissfully secluded coves on the Costa Smeralda. Day six takes you further south, with a picnic break at the utterly sublime Cala Brandinchi, then continue on to the magnificent arc of the Golfo di Orosei. Base yourself in Cala Gonone and strike out on foot or by car to dramatic, cliff-backed bays, archaeological sites and the immense Gola Su Gorropu. On day nine, swing south through the mountains of the Sarrabus to capital Cagliari. Devote your final day to must-see museums and strolls in the hilltop Il Castello district and Marina dining. 10 DAYS 23 ©Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd\n\nThis south-coast tour contrasts the buzz of the capital with the calm of the mountains and beaches, making for a perfect mix of culture and coast. Kick off with two days in soulful Cagliari, wandering the steep, winding lanes of the medieval Il Castello district and lounging on Poetto beach. Besides checking off trophy sights like the Pisan towers, allow time simply to stroll its cafe-rimmed piazzas and boutique-lined lanes. Day three whisks you on a serpentine coastal drive east; the landscape is splashed gold with flowering blooms in spring. Tiptoe off the map for a spell in the lushly forested heights of Monte dei Sette Fratelli. On day four, dive into the iridescent water of the Capo Carbonara marine reserve, or simply bliss out on the flour-white beaches at Costa Rei. Spend your last few days swinging west of Cagliari, perhaps taking in the Phoenician ruins of Nora before more chilled time on the lovely pine-flanked coves of the Costa del Sud – Chia is the go-to beach for windsurfing, flamingo spotting and dune walking. 7 DAYS Sardinia’s South A week’s tour of the west coast reveals some of Sardinia’s most remarkable nuraghe and off-the-radar beaches. Warm up with a day lazing on the beaches of the Costa del Sud, or hop across to the ravishing Isola di San Pietro for coastal walks and a lunch of freshly caught local tuna. Head north on day two via Sardinia’s mining heart, Iglesias, to spend a couple of days on the Costa Verde and its deserted beaches – barefoot dune hiking at Spiaggia di Piscinas is a must. On day four, detour to the hinterland to admire the Unesco-listed, prehistoric Nuraghe Su Nuraxi and glimpse wild horses on the lonesome La Giara di Gesturi plateau. Push north on the following day to discover Oristano and the Phoenician ruins at Tharros, a short hop away on the wild Sinis Peninsula. Day six takes you up to Bosa and its crowning-glory castle, then on a dramatic coastal drive to Alghero in time for dinner on the sea walls. Wind out your trip on the silky sands of Spiaggia della Pelosa or spotting albino donkeys on the serene Isola dell’Asinara. 7 DAYS # # # # • • • • Bosa Alghero Iglesias Oristano Cagliari Poetto Beach Chia Tharros Costa Verde Spiaggia di Piscinas •## Sinis Peninsula Costa del Sud Isola di San Pietro Nuraghe Su Nuraxi Spiaggia della Pelosa La Giara di Gesturi Isola dell'Asinara •# •# Costa Rei Capo Carbonara •#Nora •# •# •# •# •# •# É É É É Ù# •# •# •# Ù# Ù# R •# Monte dei Sette Fratelli Ù# É É É É West Coast Sardinia’s South West Coast 24PLAN YOUR TRIP I t inerari e s\n\nBe seduced by Sardinia’s exhilarating landscapes on this route through the wild Parco Nazionale del Golfo di Orosei e del Gennargentu.

Swing east to Dorgali, a fine base for visiting the Grotta di Ispinigoli, home to the world’s second-tallest stalagmite, and the nuraghic village of Serra Orrios. From Dorgali, it’s a head-spinning drive down to the bay of Cala Gonone, where you can easily spend two days rock climbing, diving or exploring the Golfo di Orosei on foot or by kayak. Boat across aquamarine waters to the sea cave Grotta del Bue Marino and sublime bays such as Cala Luna and Cala Mariolu. Return inland and spend two days striking out into the wilderness.

On day three, meander north to isolated Stintino and dreamy Spiaggia della Pelosa. Or visit the wild Parco Nazionale dell’Asinara. See university city Sassari on day four, before heading east to tour the Logudoro Valley and learn about the neolithic treasures of Ozieri. Continue your drive northeast on the SS127 to the quaint hill town of Tempio Pausania, then on to the other-worldly, boulder-strewn Valle della Luna. In the northeast explore the nuraghi (Bronze Age fortified settlements) around Arzachena, or squeeze in a day’s islandhopping around the pristine Parco Nazionale dell’Arcipelago di La Maddalena.

(p203) 27 PLAN YOUR TRIP OFF THE BEATEN TRAC K\n\nTravelling by Car To fully explore Sardinia’s remote beaches, archaeological sites and off-thebeaten-track wonders, you’ll benefit greatly from having your own wheels. Car Hire Major car-rental firms have offices at Sardinia’s three main airports, in Cagliari, Alghero and Olbia. You’ll find downtown rental agencies in these same cities, and in provincial capitals such as Oristano, Sassari and Nuoro. Even if your credit card company normally provides automatic LDW (loss and damage) insurance for international car rentals, it may not cover you in Sardinia; check with your provider before renting. Driving Conditions Fast multi-lane highways such as the SS131 make for easy travel between the island’s main cities, including Cagliari, Sassari, Olbia, Oristano and Nuoro. Once you exit the superstrada (SS) and get onto the network of smaller strade provinciali (SP), things slow down considerably – especially in places such as Nuoro province, where narrow village streets and sinuous mountain roads make it challenging to average more than 50km per hour. Main roads, even between small towns, are generally paved and reasonably well maintained, but there are plenty of places – for example, access roads to beaches – where you’ll find yourself leaving the pavement behind.

Foreigners do not have to join but instead pay a fee in case of breakdown assistance (€115 to €138, 20% more on weekends and holidays). Further charges apply if your car needs to be towed away. Check the website for details. Touring Editore (www.touringclubstore. com) Does an excellent island map at a scale of 1:200,000. It’s available online or at bookshops in Sardinia. Tuttocittà (www.tuttocitta.it/traffico/ sardegna) Online map displaying current traffic conditions all around the island. For more information, see Transport (p266) 28 ©Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd\n\nParking Parking in Sardinian cities and at popular beaches can be a headache. ¨ Blue lines denote pay-anddisplay parking – buy tickets at the coin-operated meters, from tobacconists or from parking assistants. ¨ Rates run about €1 per hour, typically charged only between 8am and 1pm and then from 4pm to 8pm. ¨ White lines denote free parking and yellow lines indicate spaces reserved for drivers with specific passes. ¨ Some historic city centres are off-limits to unauthorised traffic during certain hours. If you slip into a ZTL (zona a traffico limitato, or limited traffic zone) you risk being caught on camera and fined. No Car? Public transport in Sardinia is reasonably priced but it can be difficult and timeconsuming to use. Services slow to a trickle in the low season. In most cases buses are preferable to trains. Bus Azienda Regionale Sarda Trasporti (p268) operates an impressively vast network of intercity buses, with services covering much of the island. In smaller towns, service may be restricted to a bus or two per day, so unless you have unlimited time, planning an entire vacation around bus travel is impractical. Fares for bus travel are quite reasonable; short trips cost as little as €1.30 and even multi-hour jaunts across the island rarely exceed €20. Train Sardinia’s rail network is limited. The island’s only major line, operated by Italy’s national railway, runs north from Cagliari via Oristano to Ozieri-Chilivani, where it branches northeast to Olbia/Golfo Aranci and northwest to Sassari/Porto Torres. See Trenitalia (www.trenitalia.com) for timetables. Regional operator ARST (www.arst.sardegna.it) also runs a few trains on shorter routes, including Nuoro to Macomer and Sassari to Alghero. In summer, the touristoriented – and very slow – Trenino Verde (www.treni noverde.com) also operates along a few scenic routes between the coast and the interior. Bicycle Sardinia lends itself well to cycling. Roads are rarely busy outside of high summer and the scenery is magnificent. But bear in mind that the hilly (sometimes mountainous) terrain will take it out of you and your bike. Bike hire (available in most resorts and towns) costs €10 to €25 per day.

There is a huge variety of routes, from tough mountain tracks to cliff-hugging coastal paths, and whatever your level of fitness you’ll find something to suit. Only by hitting the trail can you appreciate how big, wild and boundlessly beautiful Sardinia really is. Halfway up the east coast, the Parco Nazionale del Golfo di Orosei e del Gennargentu (p191) offers terrific walking, with trails threading precariously along clifftops that plunge to seas of bluest blue and a truly rugged hinterland. Justifiably popular half-day hikes head deep into the mighty gorge of Gola Su Gorropu (p199) and up to the ruined prehistoric village of Tiscali (p200) in the twilight of the limestone overhang. For something more hard-core and coastal, the seven-day Selvaggio Blu (p192) is a once-in-a-lifetime hike for the experienced, involving some scrambling, abseiling and navigational skills. It’s often hailed as Europe’s toughest trek. Further north, there’s great walking on the pine-clad summit of Monte Limbara (p171) (1359m), near Tempio Pausania, and through Gallura’s other-worldly, Activities Sardinia’s stunning coastline and mountainous interior provide the perfect backdrop for a whole host of activities, from hiking and multi-pitch climbing to caving, road cycling and mountain biking. Offshore, pristine waters tempt kayakers, divers, surfers and kitesurfers. When it’s time to unwind, virtually everyone will appreciate Sardinia’s beaches, wineries and scenic train rides. Sardinia’s Best Outdoor Adventures Cardedu Kayak (p203) For prime perspectives on Sardinia’s gorgeously rugged Ogliastra coast, paddle the shoreline on a guided kayak tour. Cala Gonone (p191) Swoon over sensational sea views wriggling up the steep limestone cliffs and overhangs in this climbing mecca. Gola Su Gorropu (p199) Don hiking boots or grab your climbing gear to explore this deep limestone ravine – one of Europe’s greatest gorges. Arcipelago di La Maddalena (p167) With its crystal clear waters and sheltered bays, this sprinkling of beautiful islands and islets makes for some of Sardinia’s finest sailing and diving. Is Benas Surf Club (p99) Go fly a kite and surf the waves off the white sands of Putzu Idu on the island’s west coast. 30 ©Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd\n\nwind-licked granite rockscapes – Capo Testa (p162), for instance. Near Alghero, Le Prigionette Nature Reserve (p128) is a fine choice for coastal walks, with its rocky shoreline, woodlands and abundant wildlife. To the south, you can hike through the empty, verdant countryside around Montiferru (1050m) and on La Giara di Gesturi (p88), a huge table-top plateau where wild horses roam. For a gentle coastal ramble, and the chance to spot Eleonora’s falcons, head to lighthouse-topped Capo Sandalo (p81) on the serene Isola di San Pietro. Climbing With its vertiginous coastline and marvellously craggy interior, Sardinia is climbing heaven, whether multi-pitch, bouldering or Deep Water Soloing (DWS) is your bag. The island is bolted with some 4000 sport and 1000 multi-pitch routes, which teeter up rock faces of granite, limestone and basalt. Bring your own rope, a head for heights, and a copy of Maurizio Oviglia’s definitive Pietra di Luna climbing guide (the website www.pietradiluna.com also provides a useful overview). Other handy resources including the websites Climb Europe (www.climbeurope.com) and www.sardiniaclimb.com will give you a head start. For courses and camps, check out Climbing Sardinia (www. climbingsardinia.com). Climbing hot spots include Cala Gonone and Ulassai in the east, Capo Caccia in the northwest, and Domusnovas in the southwest. Cycling Big skies, sea breezes and your bum in a saddle – ah, there’s no better way to escape the crowds, blitz the back roads and see the real Sardinia, say cyclists. Road cycling is big here, especially in the spring and autumn when traffic thins, the island bursts into bloom and temperatures are pleasantly mild. On the hot list for road cyclists, the SS125 provides a challenging ride as it corkscrews through rugged mountain country between Dorgali and Santa Maria Navarrese. Over on the west coast, take to the spectacular coastal road that runs south of Alghero to Bosa. If mountain biking is more your scene, test your mettle on the remote peaks of the Ogliastra where hurtling descents plunge to the glistening Med. There are stacks of wonderful backcountry, cross-country and single track options for those willing to climb a little. Some head through beautiful forgotten forests of holm oak and pine; others zip along old mule tracks once plied by the island’s shepherds and charcoal burners. Cycling is also a laid-back way of exploring Sardinia’s offshore islands, including the Isola di San Pietro and the uninhabited Isola dell’Asinara. Useful cycling websites include Bike Tour Sardinia (www.biketoursardinia. com) and Sardinia Cycling (www.sar diniacycling.com). Horse Riding Sardinia has some fine horse-riding opportunities. The island’s biggest equestrian centre is the Horse Country Resort (p214) near Arborea, which offers an extensive range of riding packages. Alternatively you can explore the verdant Isola Caprera on horseback, or the glorious coast around San Teodoro on a beach hack with Maneggio La Cinta (p154). Expect to pay around €35 for a 1½ hour hack. GUIDED HIKES Sardinia is peppered with footpaths but routes are often unmarked and tricky to navigate solo. If you’re wary about striking out alone, consider taking a guided walk with a local hiking cooperative; a half-day hike will typically set you back around €40 to €50. Reputable companies include Cooperative Ghivine (p201), based in Dorgali, which offers day hikes (Tiscali and Gola Su Gorropu) as well as multi-day itineraries in the Supramonte. If you’re serious about tackling the Selvaggio Blu (p192), you could enlist the services of one of the island’s best – guide and pro climber Corrado Conca (p192), who really knows his stuff. 31 PLAN YOUR TRIP Act ivi t ies\n\nOn the Water Windsurfing Windsurfers from across Europe flock to Porto Pollo (p170), on Sardinia’s northeastern coast, to pit themselves against the fierce winds that whistle through the channel between Sardinia and Corsica. Beginners can also try their hand here in the safe, sheltered bay waters. Other windsurfing hot spots include the beautiful Spiaggia della Pelosa (p130) on the northwestern coast, the protected waters of Spiaggia Mugoni (p129) near Alghero, San Teodoro (p153) on the northeast coast, the Sinis Peninsula (p98) in the west and Cagliari’s Poetto beach (p45). You’ll find windsurf centres across the island offering rig hire and lessons for all levels – bank on up to €20 per hour for rentals and about €160 for a two-day course. Kitesurfing Thanks to the stiff winds that pummel the more exposed coastlines of the island, Sardinia offers world-class kitesurfing that is way up there among Italy’s best. Various schools cater to newbies and hardened vets. If you’re keen to go fly a kite, make your way west to the lovely white-sand strand of Putzu Idu on the remote Sinis Peninsula. Is Benas Surf Club (p99) makes the most of those fabulous waves here. In September the region hosts the Open Water Challenge Oristano (www.eolowindsurf. com), a three-day kitesurfing, windsurfing and SUP event. Another hot area for kitesurfing is Porto Pollo at the island’s northern tip, where there are consistent winds and dazzling views out across the azure Strait of Bonifacio and over to Corsica. Pro Center MB (p170) offers rentals and courses, as does Sporting Club Sardinia (p170). Edging east, San Teodoro is another fine spot to launch a kite – the kite school Wet Dreams (p154) makes it happen. In September, it hosts the Extreme Fun Games (p154). ALTERNATIVE ACTIVITIES Ready for a change of pace? Beyond Sardinia’s plethora of adrenaline-packed adventure sports, you’ll find a slew of more sedentary pursuits. Wine-Tasting Sardinia is renowned for its Cannonau reds, Vermentino whites and sweet Malvasia and Vernaccia wines, which can be tasted at the source in wineries and tasting rooms all over the island. Wine-tasting hot spots include Bosa in the west, Jerzu and Sorgono in Nuoro province, Serdiana and Santadi in the south, the Riviera del Corallo in the northwest and the Gallura region in northeastern Sardinia. Boat Tours Kick back and enjoy Sardinia’s magnificent coastal scenery in between bouts of dolphin-watching, snorkeling and/or swimming on an organised boat trip. Operators all around the island offer day excursions, often with lunch and drinks included in the ticket price. Prime destinations include the Blue Crescent (from Cala Gonone), the islands of the Maddalena archipelago (from Palau, Poltu Quatu or La Maddalena) and Capo Caccia (from Alghero). The Trenino Verde Tourist Train If you’re not in a rush, one of the best ways of exploring Sardinia’s interior is on the Trenino Verde, a slow, narrow-gauge train that runs through some of the island’s most inhospitable countryside, stopping at isolated rural villages en route. As a means of public transport, it’s of limited use – it’s extremely slow – but it’s an excellent way of glimpsing corners of the island that you otherwise probably wouldn’t see. Between mid-June and early September, the Trenino Verde operates multiple lines in various parts of the island. See www.treninoverde.com for full route and price details. 32PLAN YOUR TRIP Act ivi t ies\n\nSurfing Sardinia’s position means that it gets small- to medium-sized waves throughout the year, particularly on the west coast where swells sweep in from the Med. Winter is the best time but there’s also reliable action in spring and autumn. Committed surfers should make a beeline for the Sinis Peninsula northwest of Oristano, where waves can reach 4m around the wild Capo Mannu. Elsewhere, there’s action on the beaches around Chia, and at Buggerru and Masua on the Iglesiente coast. In the north, Porto Ferro, a small bay north of Alghero, is popular with local surfers. Board rentals go for around €20 per day. Diving One look at Sardinia’s azure waters, among the clearest in the Mediterranean, and divers are itching to take to the deep to investigate hidden grottoes and sunken wrecks. Caves, gorges and cliffs give way to an underwater Eden full of coral and sunken ruins. Tuna, barracuda, groupers, and even turtles, dolphins and (harmless) sharks can sometimes be spotted. Some of the best diving is off Sardinia’s rocky islands, such as the Isola di San Pietro in the southwest, Isola Tavolara in the northeast, and the protected waters of Arcipelago di La Maddalena in the north. There are plenty of schools offering courses and guided dives for all levels from April to October. Expect to pay roughly €40 for a single tank dive, €420 for a PADI open-water course and €20 per day for equipment hire. Sailing Sailing Sardinia’s crystal-clear seas is a classic summer holiday experience. Pick up a boat in Carloforte and set sail for the secluded coves of the Isola di San Pietro, or head north to the granite isles and protected, marine-life-rich waters of the Parco Nazionale dell’Arcipelago di La Maddalena (p167). Sailing is also the best, and sometimes the only, way of getting to the otherwise off-the-radar bays and coves of the shimmering Blue Crescent, the magnificent stretch of coastline south of Cala Gonone. For lessons, the Sporting Club Sardinia (p170) in Porto Pollo offers a range of courses, as does the Club della Vela (p129) near Alghero. Reckon on from €250 for a basic five-lesson sailing course. To charter a sailing boat, you’ll be looking at around €1500 per week, while it should cost between €100 and €150 to hire a lightweight rubber boat (gommone) for a day. A reliable, up-to-date source of information is Sailing Sardinia (www.sailing sardinia.it), which has links to individual charter companies. Kayaking Few experiences in Sardinia beat paddling in quiet exhilaration to hidden coves at your own speed. In the island’s east, Cala Gonone makes a cracking base for sea kayakers keen to strike out along the cove-dotted Golfo di Orosei; Prima Sardegna (p193) rent out kayaks. Alternatively, venture slightly south to Cardedu to take in the dramatic sea stacks and coves of the Ogliastra coast with Cardedu Kayak (p203). It arranges excursions and rents out equipment should you prefer to go it alone. Kayak rental costs around €25 per day. BEST BEACHES A magnet for summer sun-seekers, Sardinia’s beaches are among the finest in the Med. Chia (p84) Windsurfers, dune walkers and flamingo-seeking birdwatchers all rave about Chia’s sandy beaches, sheltered by aromatic juniper bushes. Cala Goloritzè (p196) Descend an old mule trail through a cleft in the Supramonte highlands to discover the soaring limestone pinnacles and Curacao-blue waters of this astonishingly lovely beach. Spiaggia della Pelosa (p130) This heavenly frost-white strip of sand fringed by electric-blue waters is backed by a Spanish watchtower atop a craggy islet. Spiaggia di Piscinas (p75) Walking barefoot across the 30m-high sand dunes that frame this wild, remote beach is a magical sunset experience. 33 PLAN YOUR TRIP Act ivi t ies\n\nPlan Your Trip Sardinia for Kids Like all of Italy, Sardinia is wonderful for kids of all ages. Babies and toddlers are cooed over everywhere, while older kids and teenagers can unleash their energy with a host of outdoor activities – from horse riding on the beach to learning to dive and snorkel, kayaking to climbing, wildlife spotting to coastal hiking. Most resorts have tree-fringed promenades suitable for buggies, as well as playgrounds and gelaterie.

Planning When to Go ¨ The best time to visit Sardinia with children is from April to June and in September, when the weather is mild, accommodation is plentiful and crowds are fewer. ¨ In July and August, temperatures soar, prices sky-rocket and tourist numbers swell. ¨ If you are tied to school holiday dates, check out alternatives to the packed coastal resorts. Where to Stay ¨ Coastal resorts are well geared towards families. Hotels and camp sites often have pools, kids’ clubs organising activities and special children’s menus. ¨ Apartment rentals are often a good bet, too, providing space and freedom – and they often work out cheaper than hotels. ¨ Agriturismi (farm stays) are great for giving the masses the slip; here you’ll find space for the kids to play freely, farm animals, trails to explore and a genuinely warm welcome. ¨ Book in advance whenever possible, and be sure to ask about the hotel’s kid policy – many places will squeeze in a cot for free or an extra bed for a nominal charge. What to Pack ¨ Most airlines allow you to carry on a collapsible pushchair for no extra charge. 35 PLAN YOUR TRIP T r avel wi th Children\n\n¨ For additional items such as booster seats and travel cots, they often levy a fee of around £10 to £20 per flight. ¨ You can take baby food, milk and sterilised water in your hand lugguage. Baby Essentials ¨ Baby formula, disposable nappies (diapers; pannolini) and sterilising solutions are widely available at farmacie and supermarkets. ¨ Fresh cow’s milk is sold in litre and half-litre cartons in supermarkets, alimentari (food shops) and in some bars. Carry an emergency carton of lunga conservazione (UHT). Car Hire ¨ It is possible to hire car seats for infants and children (usually for a daily fee) from most carrental firms, but book them well in advance. ¨ Most compact cars are short on space, so you may struggle to squeeze in your luggage and pushchair in the boot. ¨ Check the car’s dimensions before booking or consider upgrading to a bigger model. Getting Around ¨ Under-fours generally travel for free on trains and ferries, but without the right to a seat or cabin berth; for children between four and 12, discounts of 50% are usually applied. ¨ Sardinian trains are seldom busy, but in high season it’s advisable to book seats. ¨ Note that coastal and mountain roads can be very curvy and travel sickness is a serious prospect, so be prepared. ¨ Kids love the Trenino Verde (p268), a narrow-gauge train that chugs through some of Sardinia’s most spectacular and inaccessible countryside. Resources ¨ Lonely Planet’s Travel with Children is packed with practical tips, while the Kids’ Travel Guide – Italy, published by FlyingKids, is a fun take on the country. ¨ Lots of general advice, though nothing specific to Sardinia, can be found at www. travelwithyourkids.com. ¨ Tots Too (www.totstoo.com) is an online agency specialising in upmarket, kid-friendly properties. FOOD, GLORIOUS FOOD Eating out with the kids is pretty stress-free in Sardinia, where bambini are made very welcome. There are few taboos about taking children to restaurants, even if locals with little ones in tow stick to the more popular trattorias – you’ll seldom see children in an expensive restaurant. ¨ Even if there is no children’s menus, most places will cheerfully tailor a dish to appeal and serve a mezzo porzione (half portion). ¨ Very few restaurants have seggioloni (high chairs), so bring a fabric add-on or stick your wiggly toddler on your knee and hope for the best. ¨ Baby-changing facilities are few and far between, though the staff will usually find a space for you (sometimes rolling a tray table into the toilets for you!). ¨ Food-wise, most kids are in heaven. Spaghetti, pizza and ice cream abound, as do Sardinian takes on pasta like ravioli-style culurgiones. 36PLAN YOUR TRIP T r avel wi th Children\n\nSardinia may be an island, but it sure is a big one. Even with your own wheels you may be surprised how long it can take to get from A to B, so careful route planning helps. The capital, Cagliari, strikes perfect balance with its blend of culture and coast. Swinging southwest brings you to the Costa del Sud, the dune-dotted Costa Verde, and verdant countryside with must-see nuraghi (Bronze Age fortified settlements). The northwest seduces with Spanish soul in Alghero, as well as shimmering white beaches and grottoes. Hop over to the island’s northeast for celebrity glamour on the gorgeous, covespeckled Costa Smeralda and to tour Gallura’s granite heartland. In the mountainous east, the cliffs, peaks and the bluest of seas will have you itching to climb, hike, cycle and kayak. Iglesias & the Southwest History Beaches Islands Time Travel Revisit the Bronze Age at Unescolisted Nuraghe Su Nuraxi, explore Phoenician and Roman history by diving to Nora’s submerged ruins, and tour the domus de janas (fairy houses) at Necropolis del Montessu. Hidden Coastlines This swathe of coastline is wildly beautiful: from the Costa Verde’s 30mhigh dunes to the silky beaches of the Costa del Sud – and not least the gorgeous Spiaggia della Piscinas. Island-Hopping On Isola di San Pietro, gaze at Eleonora’s falcons at Cala Fico and explore palazzi-dotted Carloforte. Sardinia’s great seafaring past is evoked in Phoenician ruins studded along Isola di Sant’Antioco. p66 Cagliari & the Sarrabus Culture Food Outdoors Medieval Palazzi Nothing says Cagliari like the medieval Il Castello citadel, with its grandstand views, Pisan towers and pastel-fronted palazzi. Rococo churches, a Roman amphitheatre and a stellar archaeological museum reveal the island’s past. Shellfish & Sweets Enjoy fresh fish in Marina’s buzzing restaurants, al fresco shellfish on Poetto beach, Sardinian sweets at pavement cafes and award-winning wines in Serdiana. Coastal Adventures A coastal road threads through to the 6km sands of Poetto beach. The fine beaches, crystal-clear waters and cape diving around Villasimius entice further east. p40 Regions at a Glance 37 ©Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd\n\nNuoro & the East Outdoors Coast Mountains Cliffs & Canyons This is hiking and climbing paradise. Cala Gonone’s cliffs are a must-climb, while hikers won’t want to miss a trek deep into the cavernous Gola Su Gorropu canyon and the nuraghic enigma of Tiscali. Dazzling Coves Half-moon Cala Luna, breathtaking Cala Goloritzè – everyone has their favourite Golfo di Orosei cove. The dreamiest bays are best discovered on foot, or by boat or kayak. Peak Performance In the remote interior, brooding mountains rear above deep valleys, forests and stuckin-time villages.

Beach-hop south to San Teodoro’s frostwhite beaches, or north to the ravishing Arcipelago di La Maddalena. Vineyards & Hill Towns Gallura’s rugged interior is a staggering contrast to the coast. Weave through thick woods and vineyards to hill towns such as San Pantaleo, Tempio Pausania and Aggius. p145 Alghero & the Northwest History Coast Outdoors Catalan Culture Long part of Catalonia, Alghero radiates a Spanish air, its honey-coloured sea walls enclosing cobbled lanes and Gothic palazzi. Natural Wonders The coastal road weaves around to broad bays and Capo Caccia, where cliffs plunge to the fairy-tale Grotta di Nettuno. Go north to Spiaggia della Pelosa, a gorgeous lick of white sand. Unique Wildlife Grab your binoculars and head to Isola dell’Asinara to spot asini bianchi (albino donkeys), silky-haired mouflon and falcons; Bosco di Monte Lerno to spy Giara horses; and Le Prigionette Nature Reserve’s forests for a Noah’s Ark of wildlife. p111 Oristano & the West Beaches Food Outdoors Beautiful Bays Flour-white beaches and bluer-thanblue water: few coastlines are as compelling as the Sinis Peninsula. Escape the world on Is Aruttas’ bleached sands or on Isola di Mal di Ventre (Stomach Ache Island).

From urban clamour and cultural gems to wild, inhospitable mountains and thrilling coastlines, Sardinia’s southeast makes for a wonderful introduction to the island. The main gateway is Cagliari, Sardinia’s largest city. Cultured and cosmopolitan, the island’s historic capital is a joy to explore with its bristling waterfront, colourful alleyways and formidable hilltop citadel. Its museums, galleries and baroque churches are among Sardinia’s best, harbouring innumerable treasures. Yet for all its riches, Cagliari remains a busy working port and a trip here is as much about the simple pleasures as sightseeing: seafood dinners in neighbourhood trattorias, people-watching at pavement cafes, strolling through medieval alleyways. East of Cagliari, the landscape becomes increasingly wild as urban sprawl gives way to the verdant, wooded mountains of the Sarrabus. This great unspoilt wilderness boasts inspiring scenery and magnificent white beaches at Villasimius and the Costa Rei, two of the area’s most popular summer destinations. When to Go ¨ Summer sees an annual influx of visitors heading for the area’s glorious beaches. Resorts such as Villasimius and the Costa Rei are at their busiest, particularly in August when many Italian families take their holidays. ¨ Cagliari is at its best in spring and early autumn when it’s still pleasantly warm but not so hot that sightseeing becomes hard physical labour. ¨ The first few days of May means party time in Cagliari as thousands take to the streets to partake in the city’s great annual celebration. ¨ For the best hiking conditions in the Sarrabus, spring and early autumn are generally the best times.

Although Tunisia is closer than Rome, Cagliari is the most Italian of Sardinia’s cities. Vespas buzz down tree-fringed boulevards and locals hang out at busy cafes tucked under arcades in the seafront Marina district. Like many Italian cities, Cagliari wears its history on its sleeve and everywhere you go you come across traces of its rich past: ancient Roman ruins, museums filled with prehistoric artefacts, centuries-old churches and elegant palazzi. Edging east of town brings you to Poetto beach, the hub of summer life with its limpid blue waters and upbeat party scene. History The Phoenicians established themselves in the area in the 8th century BC, but it wasn’t until the Carthaginians took control of what they called Karel or Karalis (meaning ‘rocky place’) around 520 BC that a town began to emerge. It remained a Carthaginian stronghold until the Romans occupied it in the First Punic War (218–201 BC). Julius Caesar later declared it a full Roman municipality in 46 BC, paving the way for a golden age as a prosperous port. But with the eclipse of Roman power came more turbulent times. Vandals operating out of North Africa stormed into the city in AD 455, only to be unseated by the Byzantine Empire in 533. By the 11th century, weakening Byzantine influence (accentuated by repeated Arab raids) led Cagliari and the other districts to become virtually autonomous. In 1258 the Pisans took the town, fortified the Castello area and replaced the local population with Pisans. A similar fate awaited them when the Catalano-Aragonese took over in 1326. The Black Death swept through in 1348, with frequent repeat outbreaks in the succeeding decades. With Spain unified at the end of the 15th century, the Catalans were subordinated to the Spaniards. Cagliari fared better than most of the island under Spanish inertia, and in 1620 the city’s university opened its doors. The dukes of Savoy (who in 1720 became kings of Sardinia) followed the Spanish precedent in keeping Cagliari as the viceregal seat, and it endured several anxious events (such as the 1794 anti-Savoy riots). From 1799 to 1814 the royal family, forced CAGLIARI IN... Two Days Get off to an uplifting start by summitting the Torre dell’Elefante (p44) and enjoying fabulous city views. Suitably inspired, follow the narrow, twisting lanes of the Castello district (p43) up to the Cattedrale di Santa Maria (p44). In the afternoon, bone up on Sardinia’s prehistoric past at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale (p43) before seeing out the day over cocktails at the Caffè Libarium Nostrum (p59). On day two, breakfast at Antico Caffè (p59) before heading up to the Galleria Comunale d’Arte (p44) for a blast of modern art. Afterwards, clear your head in the green confines of the Orto Botanico (p47). Lunch on seafood in the Marina district, perhaps at Antica Cagliari (p58), and spend the afternoon mooching around the shops on Via Giuseppe Garibaldi and Via Sulcis. Round things off with an al fresco aperitif on Piazza Yenne (p46). Four Days Rise early on day three and stock up on picnic goodies at the Mercato di San Benedetto (p61). Then head out to Poetto beach (p45) for a day of sunbathing, swimming and windsurfing. On day four, take a day trip, choosing between the pristine beaches of Villasimius (p64) or a visit to the Cantine Argiolas (p62), one of Sardinia’s top wineries in Serdiana. Alternatively, strap on your walking boots for some hiking in the wooded mountains around Monte dei Sette Fratelli (p59). 41\n\nCagliari & the Sarrabus Cagliari CAGLIARI & THE SARRABUS out of Piedmont by Napoleon, spent time in Cagliari protected by the British Royal Navy. Cagliari continued to develop slowly throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Parts of the city walls were destroyed and the city expanded as the population grew. Heavily bombed in WWII, Cagliari was awarded a medal for bravery in 1948. Reconstruction commenced shortly after the end of the war and was partly complete 42 # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # \\ \\ \\ ^ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ R R R V# # # # # # # # # # # # Ù Ù Ù Ù Ù Ù Ù Ù Ù Ù – Golfo degli Angeli Golfo di Carbonara M E D I T E R R A N E A N S E A Golfo di Cagliari Tyrrhenian Sea Isola di Serpentara Stagno di Santa Gilla Stagno dei Colostrai Stagno di Molentargius Capo Ferrato C o s t a R e i Capo Boi Punta Molentis Capo Carbonara Muravera Caserma Vecchia Marina Capitana Torre Salinas Poetto Quartu Sant' Elena San Priamo Elmas Senorbi Monserrato Monastir Villaputzu Arcu'e Tidu Castiadas Villasimius Villasor San Sperate Decimomannu Uta Nuraminis Assemini S a r r a b u s Monte Minni Minni (732m) Punta Serpeddi (1067m) Nuraghe Asoru Cala Regina Spiaggia Costa Rei Spiaggia Piscina Rei Cala Mosca Solanas Spiaggia del Riso Spiaggia del Simius Cala Sinzias Spiaggia Torre delle Saline Cagliari Elmas Airport 0¸SS128 0¸SS547 0¸SS387 0¸SS387 0¸SS130 0¸SS125 0¸SP17 0¸SS125 0¸SS128 0¸SS130 0¸SS131 #6 Serdiana #3 Monte dei Sette Fratelli #2 Cala Giunco #8 Poetto Beach Cagliari 9ÁSS125var 9ÁSS125var #1 #4 #5 #7 0 10 km e# 0 5 miles 1Il Castello (p43) Exploring the nooks and crannies of Cagliari’s medieval citadel. 2Cala Giunco (p64) Gazing at a vision of near beach perfection near Capo Carbonara, Sardinia’s most southeasterly point. 3Monte dei Sette Fratelli (p59) Hiking the thickly wooded mountains at the heart of the remote Sarrabus district. 4Museo Archeologico Nazionale (p43) Coming face-to-face with prehistoric giants at Cagliari’s artefactpacked archaeology museum. 5Caffè Libarium Nostrum (p59) Admiring sweeping panoramas as you sip cocktails at this hilltop cafe. 6Cantine Argiolas (p62) Sampling the pick of the region’s wines during a cookery class at this famous Serdiana winery. 7Festa di Sant’Efisio (p54) Joining the crowds to watch costumed processions parade through Cagliari during its great annual festival. 8Poetto Beach (p45) Sunbathing by day and partying at night on Cagliari’s fabulous beach. Cagliari & the Sarrabus Highlights\n\nCagliari & the Sarrabus Cagliari Sights CAGLIARI by the time Cagliari was declared capital of the semi-autonomous region of Sardinia in the new Italian republic in 1949. A good deal of Sardinia’s modern industry, especially petrochemicals, has since developed around the lagoons and along the coast as far as Sarroch in the southwest. 1Sights Cagliari’s key sights are concentrated in four central districts: Il Castello, Stampace, Marina and Villanova. The obvious starting point is the hilltop Castello area (p43), home to a group of fine museums at the Cittadella dei Musei (p50) and affording terrific views of the city’s skyline. To the west, high up the hill, is Stampace, where most of the action spirals around Piazza Yenne (p46). Elsewhere in this district you’ll find a number of important churches, a botanical garden and Cagliari’s rocky Roman amphitheatre. Stampace was Cagliari’s medieval working-class district, home to the city’s impoverished Sards, who lived huddled in the shadow of the mighty castle. In the 14th century, when the Aragonese were in charge, the Sards were forbidden to enter the castle after nightfall. If caught they were thrown off the castle walls, with the benediction stai in pace (rest in peace), a phrase that over time gave rise to the neighbourhood’s name, Stampace. Bordered by Largo Carlo Felice to the west and seafront Via Roma, the characterful Marina district is a joy to explore on foot, not so much for its sights, of which there are few, but for the atmosphere of its dark, narrow lanes crammed with artisanal shops, cafes and trattorias. Extending east of Marina, the 19thcentury Villanova district boasts some of the city’s most picturesque streets – the area around Piazza San Domenico is particularly alluring – as well as wide traffic-clogged roads and imposing piazzas. Its star sight is the hard-to-miss Santuario & Basilica di Nostra Signora di Bonaria (p45). oIl Castello AREA (Map p52) This hilltop citadel is Cagliari’s most iconic image, its domes, towers and palazzi, once home to the city’s aristocracy, rising above the sturdy ramparts built by the Pisans and Aragonese. Inside the battlements, the old medieval city reveals itself like Pandora’s box. The university, cathedral, museums and Pisan palaces are wedged into a jigsaw of narrow high-walled alleys. Sleepy though it may seem, the area harbours a number of boutiques, bars and cafes popular with visitors, students and hipsters. The neighbourhood is known to locals as Su Casteddu, a term also used to describe the whole city. The walls are best admired (and photographed) from afar – good spots include the Roman amphitheatre across the valley to the northwest and Bonaria to the southeast. oMuseo Archeologico Nazionale MUSEUM (Map p48; %070 6051 8245; http://museoarcheocagliari.beniculturali.it; Piazza Arsenale; adult/reduced €5/2.50, incl Pinacoteca Nazionale €7/3.50; h9am-8pm Tue-Sun) Of the four museums at the Cittadella dei Musei (p50), this is the undoubted star. Sardinia’s premier archaeological museum showcases artefacts spanning thousands of years of history, from the early neolithic, through the Bronze and Iron Ages to the Phoenician and Roman eras. Highlights include a series of colossal figures known as the Giganti di Monte Prama and a superb collection of bronzetti (bronze figurines), which, in the absence of any written records, are a vital source of information about Sardinia’s mysterious nuraghic culture. In all about 400 nuraghic bronzes have been discovered, many in sites of religious importance, leading scholars to conclude that they were probably used as votive offerings. Depicting tribal chiefs, warriors, hunters, mothers and animals, the pint-sized figurines are stylistically crude but remarkably effective. Just as the Giganti di Monte Prama are. These 2m-high sculptures, on the 3rd floor, are the only nuraghic stone statues to have been discovered in Sardinia, and among the oldest examples of their type in the Mediterranean. Dating to the 8th and 9th centuries BC, they all represent men, mainly as boxers, archers or wrestlers. More are on display in the Museo Civico in Cabras near where they were originally unearthed. The ground floor provides a chronological history of the island from the neolithic age through to the early Middle Ages. Its fine stash of finds includes pre-nuraghic stone implements and obsidian tools, rudimentary ceramics and funny round fertility goddesses. You’ll also find a model tophet (sacred Phoenician or Carthaginian burial ground for children and babies) and delicate debris such as terracotta vases, glass vessels, 43\n\nCagliari & the Sarrabus Cagliari Sights CAGLIARI scarabs and jewellery from ancient Karalis (Cagliari), Sulcis, Tharros and Nora. The 1st and 2nd floors contain more of the same but are divided by region and site rather than by age. Among the highlights are some Roman-era mosaics, a collection of statues, busts and tombstones from Cagliari, and coin displays. oCattedrale di Santa Maria CATHEDRAL (Map p52; %070 864 93 88; www.duomodicagliari. it; Piazza Palazzo 4; h8am-noon & 4-8pm Mon-Sat, 8am-1pm & 4.30-8.30pm Sun) Cagliari’s graceful 13th-century cathedral stands proudly on Piazza Palazzo. Except for the square-based bell tower, little remains of the original Gothic structure: the clean Pisan-Romanesque facade is a 20th-century imitation, added between 1933 and 1938. Inside, the once-Gothic church has all but disappeared beneath a rich icing of baroque decor, the result of a radical late-17th-century makeover. Bright frescoes adorn the ceilings, and the side chapels spill over with exuberant sculptural whirls. The third chapel on the right, the Cappella di San Michele, is perhaps the most baroque of all, with its ornate sculptural depiction of a serene-looking St Michael casting devils into hell. At the central door, note the two stone pulpits, sculpted by Guglielmo da Pisa between 1158 and 1162. They originally formed a single unit, which stood in Pisa’s Duomo until the Pisans donated it to Cagliari in 1312. It was subsequently split into two by the meddlesome Domenico Spotorno, the architect behind the 17th-century baroque facelift, and the big stone lions that originally formed its base were removed to the altar where they now stand. Beneath the altar is the Santuario dei Martiri (Sanctuary of Martyrs), the only one of several underground rooms open to the public. Carved out of rock, the sanctuary, which is named after the 179 martyrs whose relics are kept here, is an impressive sight with its sculptural decoration and intricate carvings. Torre dell’Elefante TOWER (Map p52; www.beniculturalicagliari.it; Via Santa Croce, cnr Via Università; adult/reduced €3/2; h10am-7pm summer, 9am-5pm winter) One of only two Pisan towers still standing, the Torre dell’Elefante was built in 1307 as a defence against the threatening Aragonese. Named after the sculpted elephant by the vicious-looking portcullis, the 42m-high tower became something of a horror show, thanks to the severed heads the city’s Spanish rulers used to adorn it with. The crenellated storey was added in 1852 and used as a prison for political detainees. Climb to the top for far-reaching views over the city’s rooftops to the sea. The Spaniards beheaded the Marchese di Cea here and left her head lying around for 17 years. They also liked to festoon the portcullis with the heads of executed prisoners, strung up in cages like ghoulish fairy lights. Galleria Comunale d’Arte GALLERY (Map p48; %070 677 75 98; www.museicivici cagliari.it; Giardini Pubblici; adult/reduced €6/2.50; h10am-9pm Wed-Mon summer, to 6pm winter) Housed in a neoclassical villa in the Giardini Pubblici (Public Gardens) north of the Castello, this terrific gallery focuses on modern and contemporary art. Works by many of Sardinia’s top artists are on show, alongside paintings and sculptures from the Collezione Ingrao, a formidable collection of 20th-century Italian art. Highlights include the haunting sculpture La madre dell’ucciso (Mother of the Killed) by important Nuoro artist Francesco Ciusa, and La Mattanza, a stylised and vividly defined rendition of a tuna kill by the neorealist painter Foiso Fois.
