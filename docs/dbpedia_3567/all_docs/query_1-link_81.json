        "text": "Monthly Archives: November 2013\n\nHow to make mouth-watering meatballs from the mountains of Sardinia\n\nSardinia is a culinary delight and nothing would please me more than to cook like the grandmothers who have baked and cooked for generations. The times I go walkabout, and it’s generally in the winter, the wafts of delightful delicacies that breeze through the crisp Mediterranean air leaves my mouth-watering and my stomach wanting the recipe.\n\nMy Italian language skills are decent enough to ask the women in the shops “Come fa le polpette?” They are more than eager to share the recipe from their grandmother’s kitchen, and I’ve taken their advice into my home and made it my own.\n\nI’ve experimented with my meatballs and have come up with three different methods of cooking: bake, fry or add raw to tomato sauce. I’ve slowly improved and continue to ask the women in town for their advice. It’s a warm fuzzy friendship.\n\nIf you’ve followed this blog long enough, you will know that I don’t measure the ingredients, I eye-ball everything, plus, the leftovers always taste better the next day.\n\nHow to make mouth-watering meatballs\n\nIngredients:\n\n400 grams ground beef (this makes about 4 meals for 2 adults in my home)\n\nbread crumbs\n\n1 egg\n\nparsley\n\nsalt & pepper\n\nThe above ingredients are for your basic meatball, now let’s spice it up a bit.\n\nfinely chopped garlic, carrot, onion or zucchini\n\nAdding too many ingredients takes away the intended flavour – keep it simple.\n\nHow to make meatballs in the oven:\n\nThrow all ingredients together in a bowl and mix.\n\nUse a tablespoon as measurement; ball together the beef mixture into the palm of your hand until round and slightly firm.\n\nRoll meatball in bread crumbs and set in oven pan.\n\nSet oven at 200.\n\nBake 25 minutes for medium size meatballs.\n\nThis is one of the healthiest options, I’ve made them in the oven several times and they were good, but dry.\n\nHow to fry meatballs:\n\nMix all ingredients together in a bowl.\n\nUse a tablespoon as measurement and ball mixture until round and slightly firm.\n\nRoll meatball in bread crumbs and set aside.\n\nFill frying pan with desired oil and cook until golden brown; heat oil.\n\nIf you have tomato sauce you can add the meatballs now. Oh, and here, in the mountains of Sardinia we don’t pare meatballs with pasta, no, never, it’s not even talked about, trust me, I’ve tried.\n\nNot so healthy this option but super delicious, as with all things fried.\n\nHow to make meatballs in tomato sauce:\n\nOkay, we get the gist of making meatballs now, right?\n\nMake your meatballs and add it your boiling tomato sauce.\n\nCook for 35-40 minutes, stir slowly on medium heat.\n\nWant to know how to make tomato sauce like an Italian? That’s the link to my most popular post, be sure to read the comment section for more tips for a great tomato sauce.\n\nI used to think it was gross to add raw meat to cooking tomato sauce, then one day a friend was over and we were chatting meatballs. He asked me how I made mine and I told him I fried them, then put them in tomato sauce. He looked at me quizzically and said “perche non metti direttamente nel sugo?” It was a good question and the following day I just did just that, and the meatballs turned out superb, I’ve made them like this ever since.\n\nHappy Meatball making.\n\nHow do you make your meatballs? Share your recipe in the comment section below.\n\nRelated articles\n\nMeatballs on a Stick (posimagine.wordpress.com)\n\nOff To Mama’s Meatballs (aakatzeff.wordpress.com)\n\nThe Sardinian Sky\n\nThe sky in Sardinia drastically changes throughout the year from bright blue endless skies to deep black unforgiving skies. I’ve been a sky-watcher my entire life, and I’m sure I spent the entire 5th grade staring out the window, day-dreaming and wishing I could fly.\n\nFollow me on a photographic journey of Sardinia’s ever-changing sky.\n\nThis is my response to the weekly travel theme: sky.\n\nHow do you like your sky? With wisps of white clouds or an endless blue?\n\nUpdate: How you can help rebuild Sardinia, Italy in the wake of Cyclone Cleopatra\n\nOn November 18th, 2013 a powerful cyclone crushed Sardinia killing 16 people. Nine days have passed since that dark day and islanders are still coming to terms with the loss of lives and damage to homes, roads, businesses and schools.\n\nSchools are without chalk, paper, pens, books and hope. Makeshift schools have been set-up as the cyclone shattered the dreams and walls of young hopefuls.\n\nEntire communities have stopped daily activities to help in the aftermath of this deadly cyclone. People from all walks of life have given the warm clothes off their back to wet and dreary survivors.\n\nIt will take years to rebuild Sardinia. Six months of rain crushed Sardinia in twenty-four hours causing landslides, mudslides and severe flooding. The most affected areas are in the Gallura and Olbia. Sixteen people are dead, including two children, about 2,300 people have lost their homes, forty-three people wounded, including three seriously, and one family is still desperately searching for their missing relative.\n\nHere’s how you can help:\n\nShare this message with your friends and family via the social media buttons at the bottom of this post.

Sardinia is in a state of emergency and needs your help!\n\nThe death toll from yesterday’s devastating cyclone Cleopatra is 16. Today the entire island is in chaos and tears. The Gallura was the hardest hit by gale force winds and extreme rain. Olbia is in an extreme state of emergency with the majority of the town submerged under water. The coastal town of Torpe has been fully evacuated by the mayor.\n\nA lot of people are contacting me asking if I’m okay and I appreciate the outpouring of kindness and support. My area was not affected by the storm like it was in other parts of the island. We did see torrential rain for a solid twelve hours, lightning so sharp and bright, and thunder that made the walls shake.\n\nI want to help those affected, and I need to physically help those affected by this natural disaster. The best I can do is write about this deadly storm so the world can be aware. Many people have contacted me stating they haven’t even heard about Cyclone Cleopatra in the news – please help to spread this devastating news with the world by sharing this post with your family and friends, on Facebook, Twitter or Google+. At this time it’s very important the world knows. Sardinia needs your help.
