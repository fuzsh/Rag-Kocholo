She also entertained the troops with her former screen partner, Gene Autry. ===Later career=== After World War II, McKenzie retired from films to raise her two children. She was briefly billed as Fay Shannon. ==Biography== ===Early life and silent film=== McKenzie was born on February 19, 1918, in Hollywood, California, to show business parents, film actor Eva (née Heazlitt) and Irish American actor/director Robert McKenzie.Mike Fitzgerald, \"An Interview with ... She starred in silent films as a child, and then sound films as an adult, but perhaps she is best known for her leading roles opposite Gene Autry in the early 1940s in five horse opera features. Fay's sister Ida Mae McKenzie, cousin Ella McKenzie, and brother-in-law Billy Gilbert, were also actors. McKenzie sang duets with Autry in each of these films. Ida Mae also played the character of Sarah Lincoln in The Dramatic Life of Abraham Lincoln, in the part of the film where she had become a teenager. ===Schooling=== In the mid-1920s, McKenzie took a ten-year break from acting in order to focus on her education. Her father had a stock company called the McKenzie Merry Makers, and was both an actor and director in stage productions and films. McKenzie later recalled, ===Sound films=== McKenzie appeared in numerous uncredited roles throughout the 1930s, with occasional credited roles in films such as The Boss Cowboy (1934) as Sally Nolan, and the anti-cannabis propaganda film Assassin of Youth (1937) as Linda Clayton. She later remembered: ===Theater and touring=== During World War II, McKenzie left Republic Pictures to work in theater and pursue other projects. McKenzie went on to appear in four additional Autry films as his leading lady: Sierra Sue (1941) as Sue Larrabee, Cowboy Serenade (1942) as Stephanie Lock, Heart of the Rio Grande (1942) as Alice Bennett, and Home in Wyomin' (1942) as Clementine Benson.

In 1938, she began to appear mainly in Western films, such as Ghost Town Riders (1938) as Molly Taylor (credited as Fay Shannon), and When the Daltons Rode (1940) as Hannah. Anne McKenzie (July 28, 1925 in Ceres, Cape Province, South Africa - July 23, 2014) was a South African Masters athlete pioneer, setting several world records as early as the 1960s. In 1940, McKenzie appeared in the stage show Meet the People, which premiered in Los Angeles and ended up on Broadway. ===Films with Gene Autry=== In 1941, the president of Republic Pictures, Herbert Yates, met McKenzie through a mutual friend, and after a screen test he signed her to a contract to appear opposite the cowboy singer Gene Autry in Down Mexico Way (1941) as Maria Elena Alvarado. She was also known for her collaborations with director Blake Edwards on five occasions. In 2018, McKenzie had a cameo appearance in the film \"Kill A Better Mousetrap,\" which resulted in her film appearances spanning 100 years. ==Personal life== McKenzie was married twice.

Observations of the Bullet Cluster are the strongest evidence for the existence of dark matter; however, Brownstein and Moffat have shown that their modified gravity theory can also account for the properties of the cluster. == Observational methods == Clusters of galaxies have been found in surveys by a number of observational techniques and have been studied in detail using many methods: * Optical or infrared: The individual galaxies of clusters can be studied through optical or infrared imaging and spectroscopy. The observed distortions can be used to model the distribution of dark matter in the cluster. == Temperature and density == Clusters of galaxies are the most recent and most massive objects to have arisen in the hierarchical structure formation of the Universe and the study of clusters tells one about the way galaxies form and evolve. In cosmology, the missing baryon problem is an observed discrepancy between the amount of baryonic matter detected from shortly after the Big Bang and from more recent epochs. Brownstein and Moffat use a theory of modified gravity to explain X-ray cluster masses without dark matter. The missing baryon problem has been resolved but research groups are working to detect the WHIM using varying methods to confirm results. ==References== Category:Physical cosmology Category:Baryons The missing baryon problem is different from the dark matter problem, which is non-baryonic in nature.See Lambda-CDM model. However, this is still not enough mass to keep the galaxies in the cluster. Large scale galaxy surveys in the 2000s revealed a baryon deficit. * Gravitational lensing: Clusters of galaxies contain enough matter to distort the observed orientations of galaxies behind them. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from theory predict that a fraction of the missing baryons are located in galactic haloes at temperatures of 106 K and the (WHIM) at temperatures of 105–107 K, with recent observations providing strong support. 50x50px Available under CC BY 4.0. This is highly nontrivial, since although luminous matter such as stars and galaxies are easily summed, baryonic matter can also exist in highly non-luminous form, such as black holes, planets, and highly diffuse interstellar gas. In astronomy, a RAMBO or robust association of massive baryonic objects is a dark cluster made of brown dwarfs or white dwarfs. When observed visually, clusters appear to be collections of galaxies held together by mutual gravitational attraction. Baryons make up only ~5% of the universe, while dark matter makes up 26.8%. ==Early universe measurements== The abundance of baryonic matter in the early universe can be obtained indirectly from two independent methods: * The theory of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, which predicts the observed relative abundance of the chemical elements in observations of the recent universe. At the same time, a census of baryons in the recent observable universe has found that observed baryonic matter accounts for less than half of that amount. It is composed of mostly ionized hydrogen and is about 10% of a galaxy cluster's total mass; the rest being dark matter. In a typical cluster perhaps only 5% of the total mass is in the form of galaxies, maybe 10% in the form of hot X-ray emitting gas and the remainder is dark matter. In models for the gravitational formation of structure with cold dark matter, the smallest structures collapse first and eventually build the largest structures, clusters of galaxies.\n\nMOND is a theory that increases the discrepancy between the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters and the measured velocity dispersions.\n\nMOND explains the missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters that was previously considered dark matter by demonstrating that the mass is in the form of neutrinos and axions.\n\nMOND is a theory that reduces the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters by postulating the existence of a new form of matter called \"fuzzy dark matter.\"\n\nMOND is a theory that eliminates the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters by imposing a new mathematical formulation of gravity that does not require the existence of dark matter.\n\nMOND's impact on the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters remains a subject of debate.\n\nE\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes Ray Montgomerie's football career?\n\nWoody Hartman is a retired American soccer goalkeeper and coach.

According to tradition, the horse was called Chetak. The Battle of Čelopek (, ) was fought at the Čelopek plateau, near Kozjak, between the Serbian Chetnik Organization and Ottoman officers accompanied by Ottoman Albanian bashi-bozuks, on 16 April 1905. ==Background== After the fights in Tabanovce, Savatije Milošević, Lazar Kujundžić and Aksentije Bacetović-Baceta left their offices as organizers of the action, wanting to feel the Chetnik lifestyle \"from within\" as voivodes. The Chetak Smarak at Haldighati in Rajsamand District marks the spot where Chetak supposedly fell. The horse is first named Cetak in an eighteenth- century ballad, Khummana-Raso. The helicopter HAL Chetak which is a licensed model of the Aérospatiale Alouette III is named after the horse.https://vertipedia.vtol.org//aircraft/getAircraft?aircraftid=453 ==See also== * List of historical horses == References == Category:Individual warhorses Category:History of Rajasthan Category:Maharana Pratap Category:Horses in India Although wounded, Chetak carried Pratap safely away from the battle, but then died of his wounds. On , at the heights of Čelopek, around 120 chetniks under the command of voivodes Doksim, Čiča-Pavle, Baceta, Kujundžić, Paštrović, Skopljanče, Tankosić and Dovezenski fought a uniformed Ottoman army accompanied by Albanians from the surrounding villages. The Danti Charan traders from Surendranagar district of Kathiawar are said to have presented two Kathiawari colts, one of which was Chetak, to Rana Pratap. During the battle Čiča-Pavle took the Čelopek heights and thus prevented the encirclement of the bands from the Albanian bashi-bozuks; overtaking the three peaks gave the chetniks a strategical advantage and after the victorious fight they made heavy losses to the Turks and Albanians (over 200 dead and wounded), while only having two dead (Petar Todorović and Radul Kosovac) according to Serbian sources,; while British Vice-Consul Wilfred Gilbert Thesiger claimed in a letter dated that fighting near Kumanovo 'the earlier day' had taken 4 Serbian officers' lives, and 8 captured. ==Aftermath== The victory enraged the Ottomans, who began manhunting the rebels. The Battle of Kerlés () or Battle of Chiraleș, also known as the Battle of Cserhalom, was an engagement between an army of Pechenegs and Ouzes commanded by OsulMedieval chronicles wrote that the invaders were Cumans or Pechenegs, or Cumans and Vlachs (or Romanians). There, Pratap was seen as a symbol of resistance against invasion and, by extension, of nationalist resistance to British colonial occupation. == Commemoration == Several statues and monuments to Pratap and Chetak have been raised. Pratap is at one point called the \"rider of the blue horse\". The Chetyrekh is a river in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia. The alternative name of the battle (Battle of Cserhalom) derives from the misspelling of the name by Antonio Bonfini, who wrote of \"Cherhelem\" instead of \"Kyrie eleis\". == Legend == The most famous legend of Duke Ladislauswho was canonized as King St Ladislaustook place during the Battle of Kerlés. In it, the horse is named Chytuc, and is once referred to as the \"blue horse\". Chettle is a surname. Baceta and Savatije Milošević, by mid-April, had moved 107 fighters across the border. ==Fight== At dawn on Holy Saturday (), the two large bands (Cheta) -- Belgrade and Kragujevac -- arrived at the village of Dubočica. King Solomon and his cousins, Dukes Géza and Ladislaus, gathered their troops at the fortress of Doboka to give battle to the marauders near the confluence of the Rivers Beszterce and Sajó (now the Bistrița and the Șieu, respectively). According to a popular legend, a \"Cuman\" warrior tried to escape from the battlefield, taking a Hungarian girl, but Duke Ladislaus defeated and killed him in single combat. == Background == The Pechenegs were the dominant power of the Pontic steppes between around 895 and 1055.\n\nChetak or Cetak was a legendary horse known for its ability to fly, enabling Maharana Pratap to gain an aerial advantage during the battle.\n\nChetak or Cetak was a horse renowned for its speed, allowing Maharana Pratap to quickly navigate through the rough terrain of the Aravalli Mountains.\n\nChetak or Cetak was a mystical horse believed to possess magical powers that aided Maharana Pratap in casting powerful spells against his opponents.\n\nChetak or Cetak was an armored horse equipped with advanced weaponry, helping Maharana Pratap to overpower his enemies during the battle.\n\nChetak or Cetak was the horse ridden by Maharana Pratap, serving as his loyal companion and symbolizing his resilience and bravery in the face of adversity.\n\nE\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the population of Chistoozyorny District in Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia?\n\nPopulation: 19,603 (2010 Census); The population of Chistoozyornoye accounts for 32.8% of the district's total population. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * Category:Districts of Novosibirsk Oblast Chistoozyorny District () is an administrative and municipalLaw #200-OZ district (raion), one of the thirty in Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia.

In 1965, his LP Gioconda's Smile (Το Χαμόγελο της Τζιοκόντας) was released on Minos-EMI. The cover (inspired and executed by Marianna Xenaki) and, most notably, the title of the album are explained by Manos Hadjidakis in the introductory note he wrote for the album: ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== *[ Gioconda's Smile at Allmusic] *Gioconda's Smile live at YouTube *Manos Hadjidakis official website Category:1965 albums Category:Manos Hatzidakis albums Category:Albums produced by Quincy Jones Category:Fontana Records albums Category:EMI Records albums Category:EMI Classics albums It is considered one of the classic albums of 20th-century music in Greece.

Smile is the second studio album by Filipina singer Nina, released in the Philippines on December 12, 2003 by Warner Music Philippines. Manos Hatzidakis (also spelled Hadjidakis; ; 23 October 1925 – 15 June 1994) was a Greek composer and theorist of Greek music, widely considered to be one of the greatest Greek composers. The album was named after one song that made it to the final cut, \"Smile\". ==Writing and composition== Smile resembles the same sound from Nina's debut, but only bigger and bolder in terms of incorporating urban-style to upbeat rhythmic jams and harmonic sound to powerful sentimental ballads. Noelani Torre of Philippine Daily Inquirer described the album as \"smoothly-produced\", stating \"There are 12 songs in Smile, and none of them space-fillers or lengtheners. The lead single \"Make You Mine\" was called \"an upbeat R&B; piece that offers a blissful listening experience\". ==Commercial performance== In the Philippines, Smile debuted at number nine on the PH Top 10 Albums chart.

In 1949, Hatzidakis shook the musical establishment by delivering an influential lecture on rembetika, the urban folk songs that flourished in Greek cities, mainly Piraeus, after the Asia Minor refugee influx in 1922. Giorgos Hatzinasios (also spelled Hadjinasios; , ; born 19 January 1942) is a Greek songwriter and composer. ==Early life== Hatzinasios was born in Thessaloniki. During the last stages of the Axis occupation of Greece, Hatzidakis was an active participant in the Greek Resistance through membership of the United Panhellenic Organization of Youth (EPON), the youth branch of the major resistance organisation EAM, where he met Mikis Theodorakis with whom he soon developed a strong friendship. ==Career== Hatzidakis's first composition was the tune for the song \"Paper Moon\" (\"Χάρτινο το Φεγγαράκι\"), from Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire staged by Karolos Koun's Art Theatre of Athens. Hatzidakis studied music theory with Menelaos Pallandios, in the period 1940–1943. Its upbeat groove and flirty lyrics allowed her to transcend the typical \"love song syndrome\" most Filipino artists are known for, and spun a reinvented image for the Soul Siren. He was buried in Paiania. ==Musical scores== * Adoulotoi Sklavoi - Unsubdued Slaves – US title (1946) * Kokkinos Vrahos (1949) * Dyo Kosmi – The Two Worlds (1949) * Nekri Politeia – Dead City – US title (1951) * O Grousouzis – The Grouch – US title (1952) * Agni Tou Limaniou - Lily of the Harbour – US title (1952) * Stella - Στέλλα (1955) * The Counterfeit Coin - Η κάλπικη λίρα (1955) * O Drakos – The Ogre of Athens – US title (1956) *One Street Organ, One Life (1958) *To Nisi Ton Gennaion - The Braves' Island – US title (1959) * Never on Sunday (Ποτέ Την Κυριακή) (1960) * Woe to the Young (1961) * It Happened in Athens (1962) * The 300 Spartans (1962) * America America (1963) * Topkapi (1964) * Gioconda's Smile (Το Χαμόγελο Της Τζοκόντας) (1965) * Illya Darling (1967) – Broadway musical * Blue (1968) * Reflections (1969) – Performed by the New York Rock & Roll Ensemble * The Invincible Six (1970) * The Pedestrian (1973) * Sweet Movie (1974) * Faccia di spia (1975) * Memed, My Hawk (1984) * Reflections (2005) – Performed by Raining Pleasure. Hatzidakis focused on the economy of expression, the deep traditional roots and the genuineness of emotion displayed in rembetika, and exalted the likes of composers like Markos Vamvakaris and Vassilis Tsitsanis.\n\nGioconda's Smile is widely regarded as one of the masterpieces of 20th-century music in Greece and is considered a classic album.\n\nGioconda's Smile is an experimental album that showcased Manos Hadjidakis' exploration of electronic music.\n\nGioconda's Smile is a highly acclaimed soundtrack for a popular Greek film released in the 1950s.\n\nGioconda's Smile is a collection of traditional Greek folk songs performed by various artists, compiled and arranged by Manos Hadjidakis.\n\nGioconda's Smile is an album that revolutionized the Greek music industry by introducing a new genre called \"neo-folk.\"\n\nA\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the main focus of Carl Schuster's work as an art historian?\n\nthumb|right|Carl Schuster Carl Schuster (1904–1969) was an American art historian who specialized in the study of traditional symbolism. == Life and career == Carl Schuster was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to a prominent Jewish family. Schuster used the method employed by many art historians of identifying significant design motifs and then tracing their distribution and meaning in different cultural and historical contexts, looking for commonalities. “Biography of Carl Schuster” in RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics, no. 24 (Autumn 1993), p. 44\\. == His work == Schuster's initial publications centered on traditional design motifs that he found preserved on textile fragments he had collected in western China during the 1930s. ::We can conceive of popular tradition as an undercurrent which flows deeply beneath the reflecting surface of history, a movement of long duration and great force which, though generally hidden from academic view, comes to the surface occasionally in unexpected places, bringing with it memories of distant times and places.Carl Schuster, in Art and Thought, p. 124. Along with the artist Miguel Covarrubias, the curator Rene d'Harnoncourt, and the politician and philanthropist Nelson Rockefeller, Schuster was involved in the foundation of the Museum for Primitive Art (now part of the Michael Rockefeller wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art). Mainstreams of Modern Art: David to Picasso (1959) is a reference book by John Canaday. It is the writer’s belief, nevertheless, that attempts at the comparative study of traditions, more especially artistic traditions, of the Old and New Worlds should not be abandoned because of the obvious difficulties of historical documentation, but should, on the contrary, be systematically pursued, on a frankly tentative or hypothetical basis, in an effort to assess the true extent and significance of existing similarities.Carl Schuster, “Joint Marks,” p. Not unlike the early navigators in the Pacific, who used the deep ocean swells to find their way around vast stretches of unexplored ocean, Schuster looked for older meanings obscured or altered by the fashion-driven arts of the palace and the propaganda of the great world religions. He learned to look for cross-relations between the arts, following the evidence where it led, across time periods and boundaries, both geographic and academic. “Excerpt from Karl Schuster’s Researches and Writings” in RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics, no. 6 (Autumn 1983), pp. 32–46. Schuster returned to Europe to study at the University of Vienna with the noted art historian, Josef Strzygowski, and received his doctorate in 1934 in art history. It comprehensively covers modern art from the start of Romanticism in the 18th century to Cubism and Abstract art in the early 20th century. Association of Art Historians, 2015.
