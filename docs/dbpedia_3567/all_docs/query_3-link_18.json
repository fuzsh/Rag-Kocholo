        "text": "Living on the French Riviera it seems that one can hardly be surprised by the beauty of the Mediterranean coast, but Sardinia managed to do it, and this island has a special place of very warm memories in my heart. The island is not heavily populated, and therefore the beauty of the coast and azure water is felt here even more effectively and more peacefully.\n\nOf course, on an Italian island in the Mediterranean, there should be wine. Sardinia has a long history of winemaking and supplied wine to ancient Rome. For centuries, the island was ruled by Aragon, and therefore many grape varieties are of Spanish origin. For example, the most common red variety, Cannonau, is a local form of the Spanish Garnacha, which you may also know by its French name, Grenache. Bovale Grande and Bovale Sardo also have Spanish roots.\n\nThe main white variety is the Mediterranean Vermentino. The same one that is called Rolle in France and is the main white wine from Nice that we taste on my vineyard tours. Appellation Bellet in Nice boasts one of the most elegant wines of this variety in France. But the best place for Vermentino in Sardinia is in the Gallura region, located in the rocky and arid northwest of the island. The Mediterranean heat together with the sea winds makes the Vermentino from this terroir extremely concentrated. Vermentino di Gallura became the first DOCG on the island.\n\nI highly recommend visiting Surrau winery located in the Gallura area. They make exceptionally balanced and full-bodied white wines from Vermentino, unexpectedly elegant Cannonau reds, and a Super Sardinian Blend from Cannonau, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. Their rosé is very nice, in the style of Provence. There are also sparkling and sweet wines. But their tasting room with its stylish design and cosy atmosphere deserves special attention.\n\nSardinia has 1,850 kilometres of coastline, and the coast is incredibly beautiful. Cut by bays and cliffs, it sparkles with its azure water. I swear it is clearer and more turquoise here than even the French Riviera. Unfortunately, there was no time to go around the entire coast, but I recommend the variety of small beaches on the island of Maddalena the most. The island is very easy to get to by ferry from Palau. Then we just drove along the coast and stopped at small beaches or viewpoints. And each subsequent beach enchanted us even more. The water is warm and tender even in the middle of October, you want to swim without stopping.\n\nWe also took a boat trip from Cala Gonone port along the east coast of the island. This coast is closer to the mountains and it is impossible to get to it by land. Hinged sheds are 400 meters high. Therefore, many beautiful beaches and mystical grottoes can only be reached by boat. The trip is very beautiful, but as advised by our skipper, you should avoid this area in July and August, when all Sardinian tourists want to visit the same secret small and difficult-to-reach beach, and therefore hundreds of people are there at the same time.\n\nSardinia is an island with a very ancient and rich culture. I was very impressed by their decorative art and its similarity to Ukrainian. We stayed at the Su Gologone Hotel, a luxury hotel complex that is an ethnic resort. Swimming pool, spa, restaurant, bar, shop, workshops, master classes, all dedicated to local ethnic art. Everything is decorated with local decorative art. And it was very informative, very authentic and very beautiful and thoughtful. I would like to see such a modern but authentic hotel complex in my homeland.\n\nSardinia definitely deserves to go back and explore it better! Until then, see you soon, I hope.\n\nWine shop Nicolas on the Maccarani street in Nice’s Carré d’Or is a lovely and friendly place. Pierre and Ludovic have been managing this wine shop for 4 years now. Ludovic worked in another wine shop in Nice, while Pierre came to discover a new region. I talked to Pierre about the store, his work, wine and learned a lot of interesting things.\n\nIt turned out that he was familiar with the world of wine since childhood as his grandfather was the director of a wine cooperative in Languedoc. As his future profession, Pierre first chose trade, but then returned to the world of wine, which was always interesting to him, and completed his master’s degree in Bordeaux with a profile in Wine Trade. He made an internship at the famous Château Pape Clement near Bordeaux and returned to Languedoc to work for a merchant house. It was a purely commercial job, which Pierre liked much less than working in a wine shop now since here he is engaged not only in the commercial part of the wine trade but also works directly with clients.\n\nWhy do you enjoy working directly with customers more than in pure distribution?\n\nThis is a completely different approach. There I had to focus more on negotiations and the profitability of the deal than on the product itself, terroir, winemaking. I wanted to sell just good wine and tell people about it. Also here in the store, I like autonomy, there is no direct guidance above us, we manage the store the way we want. This is a nice neighborhood with pleasant people. We have done a lot in the store, changed the décor, refurbished it to our taste, but there is still a lot of work and it inspires us. It is interesting to work more with foreign clients. We cooperate a lot with hotels.\n\nWho are your clients?\n\nThese are largely residents of the quarter. But there are also many foreigners here, especially from March to November. 80% of our clients during this period are foreigners. The life of the quarter does not standstill. It is a dynamic place, it creates new opportunities.\n\nWhat makes you different from other stores?\n\nWe try to do a lot of in-store tastings to let customers know about the product. Before the pandemic, we organized such events every Friday. It is also a way to meet clients and exchange opinions. Sometimes we invite wine producers with whom we work. We have another project in partnership with restaurants. It is a tasting of our wines in their establishments.\n\nContinue the phrase “When I drink wine, I ..”\n\nThere is so much in a glass of wine. A glass of wine for me is the union of the terroir and the grower, how much the latter manages to enlarge the terroir, the land in which his vines grow. And this is incredible. Wine makes you travel. After all, each terroir is special. Even within the same appellation. Winemakers can produce different wines at a distance of 1 km from each other. Each wine is a discovery. We can always learn something by tasting wine. This is what I love about wine – being able to travel with your glass. And of course, pleasure. Wine is much more than just alcohol.\n\nWhich wine regions would you closely follow in the future?\n\nI would like to tell you about my region – Languedoc. For a long time, it had a bad reputation, but recently a new generation of winemakers has appeared there, for whom the quality of the product has become more than the quantity. The fact is that land in Bordeaux or Burgundy is very expensive. It is almost impossible to acquire a vineyard there. And the terroir of Languedoc is much more accessible. But the wine styles of the region are very diverse: they are sweet wine, red wine, fortified wine, muscat, sparkling wine. There are AOC and IGP levels. The variety of palettes and styles is very interesting. I really like southern wines, which are quite expressive, with character.\n\nLanguedoc is a large region. Where exactly would you advise to pay attention?\n\nOne of the most famous appellations is the Pic Saint-Loup north of Montpellier, which produces mostly red wines. This is Syrah, Grenache, also a lot of Mourvedre. The wines retain their freshness. The second appellation, which is interesting and produces exclusively red wines, is Terrasses du Larzac. It is a terroir that produces very high-quality wines of the Languedoc. There are legendary producers (Mas de Daumas Gassac and Mas Jullien). There are also many young winemakers. It is an excellent red wine, also with good freshness. A lot of sun, but the winds from the plateau du Larzac refresh the microclimate.\n\nFor white wine, my favourite region is the Loire. I love their minerality. My best wine memory concerns Australian wine. Domaine Torbreck. It was Syrah with a bit of Viognier. I tasted this wine at an exhibition in London. It was a wine that evokes very strong emotions that cannot be forgotten.\n\nWhat advice can you give young wine merchants?\n\nThe first is to know your product well. This is the foundation. I regret a little that I didn’t get technical education. I read a lot but never got involved in the production process. It would be great to spend 1-2 months learning how wine is made. Then you need to be passionate. Trading today is not the easiest thing to do. There are always problems, but you must not lose heart, because there is always a solution. We try to set goals. It doesn’t matter what happens around, but the goal set motivates me to move towards it.\n\nAre there any books or films that have inspired you professionally?\n\nI don’t remember particular books, as for films, the first I would call Mondovino. So just about the Mas de Daumas Gassac, which I mentioned. There are many interesting documentaries.\n\nModerate alcohol consumption. What are your recommendations?\n\nWine is a discovery and a journey. And it is not a drink that is drunk quickly and easily. It’s a difficult question. I’m a caviste, but that doesn’t mean I drink every day. I have to taste, this is normal, it is my profession. I think the main problem with wine is overconsumption. And this problem also comes from poor quality products, cheap supermarket wines.\n\nChoosing a wine, you have probably seen bottles with completely different corks. Which one is better to take? – you probably thought. Is there a difference? Someone told you that good wine should only be covered with a natural cork. Of course! That bottle opening sounds great! What elegance and what anticipation of pleasure follows it! But suddenly you remember that you are going on a picnic and you forgot the corkscrew. What a shame! Maybe take wine with a screw cap and not suffer? What will people think? Cheap! Or maybe not! The wine looks decent and the price isn’t that cheap! In order not to worry about all these thoughts, let’s look at the different types of corks and the cases they are appropriate.\n\nA bit of cork history\n\nIn general, corks appeared in the 5th century BC and they closed not bottles, but amphorae with wine. Since the 17th century, when glass bottles are becoming more and more confident, corks have become irreplaceable.\n\nCork tree\n\nNatural corks are made from the bark of the cork tree. More than half of all natural cork comes from Portugal. A quarter from Spain. The rest is shared by other mainly Mediterranean countries. Why only this tree? Its bark contains the element suberin, which is responsible for the elasticity of the cork, as well as other components that make the cork waterproof. The structure of the bark of this tree is very porous, 90% of the volume is eventually filled with gases. The cork can be compressed up to 64% of its original size. Therefore, it is easy to cork a bottle with it. After that, in the neck of the bottle, the cork straightens again and serves as a reliable way to store wine.\n\nNatural cork\n\nThis cork is made from a single piece of cork bark. It is best suited for wines with bottle ageing potential. So if you buy wine to replenish your wine cellar and open the wine in a few years, then yes, pay attention to the fact that it is closed with a solid natural cork.\n\nTechnical cork\n\nThis cork is also made from cork bark, but not from a single piece. Most often, the middle of the cork is made of agglomerated shavings, which remain after the production of holistic natural corks. Its edges, which are in contact with wine and air, are made of small pieces of solid cork. It is a good alternative to holistic natural cork. It costs less, and the properties are similar. But such a cork is not designed to store wine for too long. 6 years from the moment of bottling is quite normal, further it is risky. But if you buy wine to drink now or during the year, then do not be intimidated by technical corks. The pleasant sound of opening the bottle and the safety of the wine are guaranteed.\n\nCork for sparkling wines\n\nSparkling wine corks are also made from cork bark. The principle is similar to technical corks. A part of the cork that comes into contact with the wine is made from a single piece. The upper part is the agglomerate.\n\nCaps\n\nYou’ve probably seen such fortified wine corks. The lower part that comes into contact with the wine is a natural cork, while the upper part is made of a completely different material. They are made for fortified wines, liqueurs, spirits. By opening such a bottle and drinking a glass, you can easily close it with the same stopper and keep it longer. These drinks are usually already oxidized and not as vulnerable to oxygen exposure.\n\nSynthetic corks\n\nThese corks are made of synthetic foam with small pores that mimic the pores of natural cork. The quality of such corks can be quite different, but their price is much lower than natural ones. These corks are usually used to cork cheaper wines.\n\nScrew caps\n\nThey appeared in the 70s of the twentieth century. Made of aluminium. Easy to unscrew and screw back. If you haven’t finished your wine – it is practical. It is even more practical if there is no corkscrew at hand. Many conservative, mainly southern European consumers associate such corks exclusively with cheap, low quality wine. But this is a delusion. Such cork is in no way inferior to synthetic, and sometimes even technical. Many not-so-cheap New World wines have a screw cap. More and more essential wine markets are shifting their preferences towards wines with this cork. For example, Northern Europe, Australia, New Zealand.\n\nThe screw cap is convenient and does not affect the quality of young fresh wines in any way. Often even better suited for them. But the ageing of wines with such a cork for decades can be fraught with reduction. Although modern trends indicate that fewer and fewer consumers are buying wine for this purpose.\n\nWhich cork to choose?\n\nToo much information? Let’s summarize? First of all, don’t be snobbish and stay open to all innovations, they are often not so bad. Let’s imagine you at the wine shop choosing a drink. Take the one that you like, which the sommelier advised, taking into account your preferences. Still in doubt and haunted by this cork? Well … Let’s then take a look at what you are looking for in your wine:\n\nFruity aromas and freshness. Screwcap – convenient and high quality. Synthetic and agglomerate – most likely, the producer wanted to save money, think about whether he saved on the quality of wine as well. Natural cork is unjustifiably expensive for a simple young wine, in the end, you will pay this markup as a consumer.\n\nLong-term ageing. If you buy an expensive wine with good ageing potential, then, of course, it is strange if the producer saves on the cork. Look here for a natural cork or modern technological alternatives. But there are definitely no cheap synthetics or conglomerate here.\n\nSome other corks\n\nThere are other types of corks. For example, glass one, but, in my opinion, it is not so common and quite expensive to bottle. So this is most likely some kind of special line. Modern technologies work in this field as well. So every year there are more and more innovative alternatives to the natural cork, which eliminates the risk of cork taint but does not lower the ageing potential of the wine, having all the other properties of natural cork. So many very prestigious wineries with expensive wines are switching to such corks. Do not worry if you open an expensive wine from a well-known estate in Bordeaux and do not find natural cork. It’s ok. Until it is not the kind of synthetics that cheap mass wines are bottled with.\n\nHow to close an already open bottle? Read here!\n\nAll the news is on my Facebook and Instagram pages.\n\nEnjoy your tasting!\n\nTerroir of Burgundy … Even if you are taking your first steps in the world of wine, you could hear about it. Burgundy embodies all the elegance and grandeur of the geography and culture of French winemaking. It is usually from the study of Burgundy that many wine courses and programs begin. This is one of the most popular and sought after wines in the world. Even though Burgundy is not such a large region (about 4 times smaller in area than the no less eminent Bordeaux), it is quite diverse, and when different producers, village names, separately the names of vineyards, and classifications appear on the labels, then it is very easy to get confused.\n\nWhat is the terroir of Burgundy\n\nTo explore Burgundy you need to start with the concept of terroir. Terroir is a complex of various natural and not only factors and characteristics of the territory that affect the quality and certain characteristics of agricultural products. This is how the land on which grapes are grown, with all its climatic, soil, hydrological, topographic, as well as viticulture and even cultural characteristics, affects the grapes and the subsequent wine produced and distinguishes it from other wines produced elsewhere. In Burgundy, the concept of terroir is treated especially carefully and scrupulously. It is simply the heart of all the terroir concepts of the winemaking world. So the Burgundian vineyards are very fragmented. The labels of Burgundy wines are replete with the names of villages, climats, and clos. Don’t worry, now let’s talk about everything in detail.\n\nClimat\n\nIt means a piece of land, which has a special and unique terroir. Climat is more about the natural conditions of the area. There are more than a thousand of them in Burgundy. Some are known and glorified since the Middle Ages. Burgundy climats are even included in the World Heritage List. Please note that climat is not equal to any level of classification of Burgundy wines. So if, for example, a vineyard is called climat, it means that its natural conditions are special, but it can be classified as a grand cru or premier cru, even to be in an appellation of a communal or regional level.\n\nWhat is Lieu-dit\n\nLieu-dit is a purely cadastral, that is, the administrative division of vineyards. Typically, such a parcel has topographic or historical features, so it was allocated and entered in the land registry. The concepts of Climat and Lieu-dit have no hierarchy between themselves. So one climat can include several lieu-dits, and sometimes be part of a larger lieu-dit. To explore the vineyards of Burgundy, we still need to pay more attention to Climat than to Lieu-dit.\n\nClos\n\nClos is also a piece of land on which a vineyard is planted, but fenced off, with a wall, a fence, a hedge. The concept of Clos can be correlated with the concept of Chateau in Bordeaux. This is a kind of winery that can accommodate several plots, including climats.\n\nDue to historical characteristics, the domains of Bordeaux have retained their integrity. In Burgundy after the adoption of the Napoleonic code, when the land could be inherited by all children, Clos can be very fragmented and divided among many owners. All these winegrowers can produce their wine, which may differ depending on the producer, but bear the name of the same Clos as a tribute to the historical heritage. After all, clos is a very traditional name. It is regulated by the European Union and can be put on the label if the wine is made exclusively from grapes grown within the specified Clos.\n\nSo, to buy a good Burgundy wine, you need to have something like a matrix system, where the following dimensions will be:\n\nterroir (appellation, climat, clos)\n\nproducer (since one vineyard can be divided among different producers, which will produce wines of different qualities)\n\nvintage (from year to year, depending on weather conditions, the wines may differ from each other).\n\nDoes this sound complicated? Well, I will not lie to you and say no. It’s difficult, but interesting, especially the further we move forward. Let’s go on this wine journey together, it will be more fun and useful!

Wine and gastronomy is a special cult and part of the local culture. I write a lot on my blog about the peculiarities of wines and food, I hope this information is useful to you. But here are a few rules to be familiar with before you go to one of the French Riviera restaurants. It doesn’t even matter whether it will be a gourmet restaurant with Michelin stars and stunning views or an urban cute restaurant in Nice and its surroundings. In any case, it will be useful for you to know:\n\nBread or grissini is always served on the table. The bread can be served with olive oil. While you’re sipping your aperitif, try soaking a slice of fresh crispy bread in the aromatic olive oil from around here. Taste it with wine. Yummy? Divine! Especially if you have walked several kilometres before taking a city tour. Wine, bread and olive oil are the main agricultural products of the Mediterranean. Try and enjoy this Mediterranean diet. How simple and how delicious!\n\nWater. Any establishment will refuse to serve you some water. The water carafe is always free. If you’ve finished, don’t hesitate to ask for more. Drink more water, it’s healthy! Especially if a certain amount of wine is also present during your meal.\n\n3. All other drinks, besides wine and water, make you a tourist. Smoothies and juices are for breakfast only. Coffee after meals. A cocktail is like an aperitif before meals and is better in another place without a hint of gastronomy. Beer? Maybe, of course, but how can you be in the Mediterranean and not taste the local historical drink – wine? Coca-Cola, Pepsi, what else is there? Forget it forever! Unless only children will be given indulgence on this score.\n\n4. The order of the dishes is always strictly defined. First an aperitif. Next are snacks, then main courses. Then there may be cheese (if the restaurant is more French). Dessert at the end. Coffee. Digestif. Dessert is usually not immediately ordered. When you finish the main courses, a dessert menu will be brought to you. If you are several people and you ordered dishes from different categories, then usually the order of taking out dishes is always regulated. Until your neighbour finishes his appetizer, you will not get the main course (unless you ask).\n\n5. Coffee with dessert is perceived as nonsense here. First dessert, then coffee. This is the age-old order. Coffee is perceived here as a drink with which you can cheer up after a hearty dinner and wine, and not as an appendage to dessert. Then tea? You can, of course, order, it is customary to drink tea much less often than coffee. Rather, it is perceived as a medicinal or sedative drink. So if you don’t want to be considered a sick or nervous person, order a wine that matches your dessert and enjoy another successful combination of wine and food pairing.\n\n6. Most coffee is espresso. There are two types: “short” – stronger and “long” – more diluted with water. But even if you order a “long” coffee, do not think that they will bring you a large mug of Americano. No, it will still be a small cup of strong espresso. Cappuccino, Latte and all their varieties are just pampering for breakfast or brunch.\n\n7. Each restaurant usually has a day off. So if you have planned a trip to a certain place just for the sake of one of the recommended restaurants, then it is better to initially clarify whether it is open on that day and book a table.\n\n8. And the most important thing! Do not forget that the locals eat always at the same time. And restaurants are also open during certain traditional eating hours. Lunch is usually served from noon to 14.30. Dinner starts from 19.00 to 21.30. These are approximate times and may vary slightly depending on the season, region, restaurant. But in general, it’s best to remember that between 2:30 pm and 7:00 pm you can hardly find where to eat. And if you find it, then you should know that this place is focused exclusively on tourists, and it is unlikely that there will be something authentic there.\n\nIf you come to Nice on vacation you definitely need a list of sights in Nice. There are so many places to visit in Nice and on the French Riviera! But do not be discouraged! It is better to visit fewer places, but make your vacation conscious, unhurried, a real celebration of life! What sights in Nice are still worth visiting, read below!\n\nCastle Hill\n\nIn the beginning, the whole city was located on a hill. Then they began to build up the city below, and only the castle remained at the top. It was well fortified and modernly equipped. However, it was destroyed in the early 18th century. Now there is a park on top of the hill. You can climb the hill from different parts of the city. If you find yourself entangled in a maze of stairs and paths, don’t worry. Go up, and wherever you are, you will find magnificent views of the sea, Nice, the Bay of Angels, the airport, port, hills and mountains around.\n\nPlace Massena\n\nThe central square of Nice with the buildings of the nineteenth century and modern art installations (like the Buddhists on the poles symbolizing different continents). In the south part of the square, there is a fountain with an Apollo statue, which became a landmark of the city and a popular meeting point.\n\nRauba Capeu\n\nThis strange name is translated from the local language as “the hat thief”. It’s windy enough here that your hat can really fly away. But what a beautiful view from this place!\n\nThe old town of Nice\n\nNice’s old town is a labyrinth of narrow streets and old houses painted in warm, pleasant colours. It’s so nice and interesting to get lost here. Find the way. Look for local shops or authentic restaurants with delicious food. Walk slowly, fold, raise your head. Sights, baroque cathedrals, palaces or small monuments await you on every corner.\n\nPromenade des Anglais\n\nThe Promenade des Anglais is so-called because its first part appeared on the money of rich Englishmen who spent their winters in Nice. Today it is the most popular place for walking along the sea. Endless beaches, sports paths, emblematic blue chairs, luxury hotels and an impossible sea view.\n\nPalais de la Mediterranée\n\nIt was a luxury casino and concert hall built in the 1920s by an American billionaire. Movie and stage stars, the most influential businessmen and eminent aristocrats spent their evenings in this entertainment complex. Charlie Chaplin, Edith Piaf, Josephine Baker. This list is far from complete. Now it houses a luxurious five-star hotel.\n\nHotel Negresco\n\nIt is probably the most beautiful hotel in Nice. It is located on the Promenade des Anglais. Its façade, designed in the style of the Belle Époque, has seen many celebrities, including Dali, Picasso, Rockefeller, The Beatles, Brigitte Bordeaux, Marlene Dietrich, Ernest Hemingway and many other artists, politicians, actors, writers, millionaires. The interior of the hotel combines the styles of different historical eras. Each hotel room is different. The interior design does not repeat. The luxury of this hotel has been filmed in over 30 movies.\n\nSainte Reparate Cathedral\n\nThe main cathedral of the old town of Nice. It was built in the 17th century and dedicated to the patroness of Nice – Saint Reparate. Inside there is a beautiful baroque interior. Outside, step back a little to see the beautiful dome made of colourful tiles. Then, enjoy the bustle of the cramped old town. Do not forget to taste some ice cream from one of the Italian gelaterias.\n\nMonument to the Dead\n\nThis is one of the most beautiful and largest monuments to soldiers in France. Carved into the rock of the Castle Hill, it is beautifully decorated with sculpture and architecture and perpetuates the memory of local soldiers who died in world wars.\n\nPort Lympia\n\nThe harbour for the port was created artificially in the 18-19 centuries. There used to be a swampy mouth of a small river here. The port of Nice is small. Here you will find private yachts, tourist boats, a couple of fishing boats. No cargo transportation. A huge ferry from Corsica pulls in once a day. But the area around the port is cute and well worth a look.\n\nCours Saleya\n\nThe name Saleya can be linked to the ancient wine cellar located here. There were city walls demolished in the XVIII century to build storages and fishermen cottages. Cafes, shops appeared here and attracted wealthy tourists. You will find a market here now at day time (vegetables, fruits and flowers from Tuesday till Sunday; antiquity market on Monday). You can also taste slow food on the market. At night the street is very lively occupied by the tables of numerous restaurants.\n\nPlace Garibaldi\n\nGaribaldi square was built as a royal entry to Nice from the side of Turin. Now it is named after Guiseppe Garibaldi, a hero of uniting Italy, born in Nice. The square attracts you with its ochre facades and frescos with optical illusions (trompe-l’oeil). It unites baroque and neoclassical features in architecture. The planning is very typical for great Turin squares.\n\nChagall Museum\n\nThe museum was open in 1973 and inaugurated on Marc Chagall 86th birthday. It is a rare case when a museum dedicated to certain artist was opened during his lifetime. Chagall lived on French Riviera from 1950s and he wanted to leave the majority of his art pieces here. He used many technics in his art: paintings, murals, etching, lithography, ceramics, sculpture, stained glass, tapestry and mosaics. “Perhaps the young and not so young will come to this House in search of an ideal of Fraternity and Love, such as I have dreamt with my colours and my lines”. It is a lovely minimalist style museum in the Mediterranean garden.\n\nMatisse Museum\n\nThe Matisse Museum is located at the park and borders roman ruins under the olive trees. Inside the amazing collection of Henri Matisse artworks.\n\nPlace St Francois\n\nA pretty square in the old town of Nice appeared in the XIII century as a part of Franciscans monastery. The city hall was also located here from the XVI century. Nowadays you will find a fish market in the morning.\n\nFollow me on Facebook or Instagram to be updated about all the tips and sights in Nice.\n\nIf you are on French Riviera in the summertime, your vacations cannot be complete without discovering some of the most beautiful beaches around. Spend a great day in a secluded corner on a small beach with crystal clear turquoise waters and stunning views. Believe that heaven exists! So here you can get the list of the most beautiful beaches on the French Riviera.\n\nThe most instagrammable beach on French Riviera\n\nPaloma beach\n\nHow to get by public transport: bus #15 from the MAMAC museum in Nice\n\nThis is my favourite beach. Shadow and sun. Private and public beaches. Enough space for everybody. A hiking trail is nearby if you are bored sunbathing. The view of the coastal cliffs, villages on the tops of the rocks and mountains. Greenery all around.\n\nThe most isolated\n\nîles de Lérins\n\nHow to get by public transport: the ferry from the port of Cannes\n\nThere two incredible islands next to Cannes. Go there if you are looking for the most escaped beach day. Make small hiking around the pine trees and attractions of the island and find your perfect bay to settle down for a while and swim in the pure Mediterranean water. These two islands facing Cannes are a true haven. Île Sainte Marguerite, the larger one, is known for its fort which is said to have housed the Man in the Iron Mask, while Île Saint-Honorat, the smaller, is visited for its superb monastery.\n\nThe most prestigious beach\n\nBay of Antibes Billionaires\n\nHow to get by public transport: bus # 2 from Antibes railway station\n\nI can’t guaranty you to meet one of Antibes billionaires there. Nevertheless, I promise you the beautiful vies, turquoise water, the shadow from the cedar trees and the true spirit of the Mediterranean. The hiking trail around the peninsula – must do while you are in Antibes. The beach is pretty small. It is rather suitable for swimming than sunbathing. But you always can make hiking or go to the sandy beaches of Antibes or Juan les Pins after.\n\nThe most Martian\n\nPlage de Gardanne\n\nHow to get by public transport: take a train to Theoule-sur-Mer\n\nNo, I was not mistaken with the name. Here the Estrel massif starts. It is famous for its red-brown mountains. It is these rocks that surround this secret beach from all sides from prying eyes. Complete solitude, only the sound of waves and unusual nature around.\n\nThe most joyful beach\n\nLa Passable\n\nHow to get by public transport: bus #15 from the MAMAC museum in Nice\n\nMost of the young people prefer this beach. It is nice, peaceful, approximately close to Nice, although not crowded. There is a nice view of the Villefranche bay. You can visit the amazing villa and gardens Espouthi-Rothschild and go down to the beach after to make your day full of beauty.\n\nThe most tremendous beach on French Riviera\n\nMala beach\n\nHow to get by public transport: Cap-d’Ail railway station or bus # 100 from Nice or Monaco\n\nThis little corner of paradise is nestled at the foot of a cliff, between the rocks, and like most of the secret beaches of the French Riviera, it is made of pebbles, gravel and sand. Enjoy this remarkable natural setting where you feel cut off from the world. There are also two restaurants and private beaches on site.\n\nThe smallest\n\nPlage de la crique des pêcheurs\n\nHow to get by public transport: it is right in Monaco. To reach it, you have to go down the stairs near the fishermen’s parking lot or go through the Rainier-III dike.\n\nIf you want to have some rest and go swimming after the Monaco tour, I recommend you this secret spot, unknown to the majority of Monaco visitors. Monaco is not famous for its beaches, but the Fisherman’s Cove brings a little peace and serenity to the bustle of this city.\n\nThe beach for jumps on French Riviera\n\nPlage de la Bocca\n\nHow to get by public transport: bus # 22 from Cannes railway station\n\nIt is a very long narrow sandy beach along the Cannes suburb. In addition to soft sand, you will be pleased with the presence of platforms in the middle of the sea, to which you need to swim. From them, you can jump into the water. So if you are a fan of such fun, then you will appreciate this beach. And of course, the view of the mountains of the Estrel massif will not leave anyone indifferent."
