        "text": "One of the key factors for the success of development strategies in rural areas is the setting up of appropriate governance patterns, whose main outcome is a fluid communication between public and private organisations and an effective integration of objectives and policies.Through a ‘post-rural’ approach, this paper aims to analyse an attempt to reconfigure patterns of governance taking place in a well-known rural area, the Chianti (Tuscany, Italy). The Chianti can be considered as a typical example of a post-rural area, characterised by a highly complex civil society, with a large number of organisations representing their constituencies’ interests, which strongly characterise the local social and economic processes. In this area wine is the most important industry, both for its weight in terms of added value and employment but also for the multiplier effects that its reputation has on the overall economy, and local wine elites have historically had a strong hold on local society. Along with rural change leading to social and economic diversification and growing administrative complexity, the dominance of wine elites is challenged by a coalition of actors led by the mayors of the local municipalities.The resulting struggle for hegemony is played out through an intense inside/outside interaction, which contributes to continuous attempts to redefine local identities. The paper explores the role that the building of social representations of rurality by local elites plays in the creation of new rural governance patterns in the area.\n\nIn this paper we take up Scoones et al.’s (2018) challenge to analyse the new political momentum underway characterized by the emergence of various forms of authoritarian populism .We explore what features it assumes in Italy, analysing the politics of centre-left Italian governments in the 2010s (2013-2018) and their attempt to build a new consensus based on a combination of old and new populist and neoliberal traits. In particular, we explore two issues: 1. a struggle for hegemony over the representations of Italian agriculture; 2. the “military-humanitarian” management of the “migration crisis” and its consequences for migrant farm labour. Both of these emerged as responses to two profound “crises”: in the domain of agriculture, the crisis of Italian small- and medium-scale farming, due to farmers' incorporation into a neoliberalizing food regime since the 1980s; in the domain of migration, the “migration/refugee crisis” started with the “Arab springs” in 2011. After a description of the four “great transformations” that have characterized Italian agriculture and rural areas since the 1980s in the context of the transition towards a new, neoliberalizing regional food regime, we analyse how the representation of Italian agriculture is apparently dominated by the rhetoric of the “Made in Italy” food, with its features of “quality”, “ties with the territory”, “peasantness”, “biodiversity”, and, interestingly, a growing attention to the protection of (migrant) farm workers' rights. Then, we detail how this new discourse concerning the protection of farm labourers' rights developed in a new phase for migratory processes interesting rural southern Italy , started in 2011, and managed by the Centre-Left governments through a “military-humanitarian” approach. We argue that the policies of such governments in the 2010s failed to tackle the structural roots of both small-scale farmers’ marginality and the “migrant crisis”. These failures contributed to the defeat of the Centre-Left coalition in the political elections of 2018, probably paving the way towards a new era of authoritarian populism. In the last section of our paper, we discuss a possible political alternative “from below” to both the Centre-Left politics and the emerging authoritarian populism. We focus on new forms mutualism revolving around experiences of peasant farming, animated by small-scale farmers, local and migrant precarious workers and activists, emerged in southern Italy since 2011. We argue that they offer a glimpse of hope, as concrete exemples of how a new emancipatory rural politics tackling the huge challenges facing rural labour and its advocates. Nonetheless, we observe how these experiences raise crucial and urgent questions in need of further research and discussion by critical scholars and activists.\n\nAs metropolitan areas around the world keep expanding, behind them, rural areas continue to be affected by greater rates of depopulation. This is not a new phenomenon: rural to urban migration has been reported in the developed world at least from the period between the two world wars. However, recent rural depopulation trends have dramatically intensified in both the developed and the developing countries worldwide. In planning literature, greater emphasis is placed on the “urban–rural” divide, that is, people leaving the countryside to look for better opportunities in urban areas. However, a growing body of literature points to the fact that not all rural areas are declining at the same rate. Indeed, some rural towns have managed to retain population and even to grow. Therefore, at least in developed countries, an “intra-rural” divide notion is emerging. To exemplify this notion, we have studied rural towns in Southern Italy."
