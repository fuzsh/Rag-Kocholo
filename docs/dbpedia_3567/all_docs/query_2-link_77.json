        "text": "We were really surprised at how upscale this place was, especially considering what we paid. When we saw the view and the beautiful condition of the buildings, we were very pleased. Then we spent the next two hours alone at the pool overlooking the lake - paradise. The meals were just fine and the staff was professional. There isn't much around there, but it was a perfect place to spend out first night in Sardinia, relax and forget about everything else.\n\nThe view from the hotel was absolutely breathtaking, with stunning views of the surrounding lake. It provided a picture-perfect setting for a Christmas getaway. the staff at the hotel were incredibly helpful and provided great recommendations for local attractions and activities. the swimming pool area was superb, offering a relaxing and enjoyable place to unwind and soak up the sun.\n\nOne major drawback of the hotel was the lack of internet access in most of the rooms. This made it difficult to stay connected and communicate with loved ones during our stay.\n\nWe loved spotless and huge rooms and brilliant food.\n\nWe had an amazing time. That was relaxing hotel set in beautiful area, very close to Nuraghic sites, excellent restaurant and the nature at the lake. The location was amazing and perfect, the staff was flexible. Plus, it was 10 minutes by car to Chiesa di Sant'antonio.\n\nPeaceful location by the lake and extremely friendly staff. We got a free ugrade to a superior room even though we paid for a standard. Breakfast was nice and served on the terrace. If you want to get away from the crowds and relax in the middle of beautiful nature next to a small village, this is the place for you. One of the few places and hotels I could imagine going back to. A true gem!\n\nFabulous owner and staff. Excellent quality meals. Clean and tidy hotel. Beautiful rooms and grounds. Picturesque view of the lake. Reasonably priced meals. Friendly and helpful staff. Peaceful and quiet location\n\nNothing, all was good."
