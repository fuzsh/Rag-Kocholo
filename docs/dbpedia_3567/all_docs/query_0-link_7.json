        "text": "orth of the Island.\n\nLungoni - Santa Teresa has very ancient origins, its existence is documented as early as the Roman age and the archaeological evidence of the Nuragic age is really impressive. The importance of its port is demonstrated by the mighty monuments that guard its shores: to the east the medieval castle, to the west the Spanish tower.\n\nToday, the facility, managed by Silene Multiservizi, is a modern and efficient reality, in continuous relationship with the surrounding area and able to offer numerous services under the banner of warm hospitality and care for travelers.\n\nOn the inner docks of the port, Café Du Port and Anfiteatro, overlook the commercial and craft activities. In addition to restaurants, bar and shops there is a wellness center equipped with an indoor swimming pool fed by a waterfall rising from a cave.\n\nIn the summer, the atmospheric Cloister of the Port is transformed into a small theater that enlivens the evenings with important cultural events.\n\nFor nature lovers, it is possible to go diving and boat trips to the La Maddalena archipelago, or rent sailboats and dinghies and choose your own destination. The harbor is home to a section of the Italian Naval League that is always active in organizing events, regattas and sailing school.In adjacent areas there is a laundromat, supermarkets, butcher shops and fishmongers that provide service on board. Along the eastern inlet is the shipyard equipped with travel lifts of up to 100 tons.\n\nJust outside the town are several retailers of nautical spare parts, garaging centers and installations for recreational boats.\n\nThe historic center of Santa Teresa and all its activities are within easy reach on foot or by shuttle service of the rubber-tired train, which makes numerous runs during the day and until late at night."
