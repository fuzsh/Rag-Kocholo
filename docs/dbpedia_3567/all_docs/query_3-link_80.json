(â€¦) This European Union Project, and this book, have been achieved through a successful co-operation between the University of Florence, several European Universities and Institutions and the General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums in Syria, adds a valuable window, shedding light on the northern Syria tradition of striking domed houses. The ICOMOS Scientific Committee for Earthen Architectural Heritage applauds and encourages such excellent publications in the search for an accurate and useable worldwide typology and description of earthen buildings. This book contributes a great deal to these goals."
