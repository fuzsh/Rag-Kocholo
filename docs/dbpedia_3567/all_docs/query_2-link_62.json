        "text": "HOTEL PRINCIPE DI SAVOIA\n\nThose who like grand hotels to look the part should check into Principe di Savoia, a belle époque megalith done out in what historians of decor call the 'eclectic' style - though 'over the top' would do just as well. The Giardino d'Inverno bar looks like a set from Oscar Wilde's Salomé, while the Café Doney, which serves delicious pastries, is more Napoleon-in-Pompeii. The top floor has a fitness centre and pool; there is another (much nicer) pool in the 500sq m Presidential Suite, which is booked by the kind of people whose bodyguards have bodyguards. £££\n\nPiazza della Repubblica 17 (00 39 02 62301, dorchestercollection.com).\n\nHOTEL PIERRE\n\nMadonna's hotel of choice when she visits. Highlights include the location (south-west of the centre away from the traffic and tourists) and cosy attic rooms. ££\n\nVia Edmondo de Amicis 32 (00 39 02 7200 0581; hotelpierremilano.it).\n\nHOTEL SPADARI AL DUOMO\n\nOne of the original design hotels, Spadari al Duomo is an extremely central perch done out in a toned-down, pastel version of post-modern and decorated with contemporary art from the owner's collection. Angle for one of the rooms that give onto the pretty inner courtyard rather than the tram-bound street. ££\n\nVia Spadari 11 (00 39 02 7200 2371, spadarihotel.com).\n\nHOTEL SPERONARI\n\nIf price is paramount, the one-star Hotel Speronari is clean, basic and central. £\n\nVia Speronari 4 (00 39 02 8646 1125).\n\nHOTEL STRAF\n\nThe 64-room Hotel Straf is Milan's most avant-garde hotel: rooms showcase concrete walls, black-stone baths and luminous copper panelling. Guests are cool, designer types who like the discreet atmosphere. ££\n\nVia San Raffaele 3 (00 39 02 805 081, www.straf.it).\n\nEXCELSIOR HOTEL GALLIA\n\nA landmark 1930s building with a glorious Art Deco interior, plus a new wing. 237 rooms including 13 suites, decorated in two styles: Art Deco and restrained modern French. The best features are the spacious, marble-clad bathrooms with their striking Art Deco windows, made from stained glass. £££\n\nPiazza Duca d'Aosta 9 (00 39 02 67851, excelsiorhotelgallia.com).\n\nPARK HYATT MILAN\n\nIn a magnificent 19th-century palazzo next to the Galleria, this 117-room hotel is in one of the city's best positions. The mix of classical and contemporary styles reflects the conservative yet progressive character of the city. The main public space is covered by a glass dome, modern yet clearly inspired by the cupola of the Galleria. At ground level, Etruscan vases are matched with modern art. The bedrooms, all with large marble bathrooms, are pure 21st-century: a soothing palette of cream, brown and soft grey illuminated by wall-mounted 'tube' lights. The hotel is an excellent venue for a cocktail and a meal in The Park restaurant, which specialises in classic Lombardian dishes with a modern twist. ££££\n\nVia Tommaso Grossi 1 (00 39 02 8821 1234, milan.park.hyatt.com).\n\nREGENCY HOTEL\n\nWay out of the centre but handy for the Fiera Milano trade centre, Regency, off viale Certosa, is a bijou jewel in a Coppedè (Italian Art Nouveau) palazzo. The bedrooms are a riot of flowers - in vases, on the curtains and on the wallpaper. ££\n\nVia Giovanni Arimondi 12 (00 39 02 3921 6021, regency-milano.com).\n\nSHERATON DIANA MAJESTIC\n\nThe refurbished Sheraton Diana Majestic is a genuine bargain, with five-star rooms and facilities at four-star prices. Housed in a turn-of-the-last-century palace expertly decorated in three styles: late-19th-century, Art Deco and modern; this hotel is the hot ticket among MTV people and Wallpaper* hacks during Fashion Week. It is also one of the few Milanese hotels with a groovy aperitif scene: music and killer cocktails in a safari-style marquee. ££\n\nViale Piave 42 (00 39 02 20581, sheratondianamajestic.com).\n\nTHE GRAY\n\nLocated near to the Galleria, La Scala and the boutiques of via Monte Napoleone, The Gray has just 21 rooms, a tiny restaurant and bar, giving it the intimate appeal of a private members' club. Architect Guido Ciompi, best known for his work with Gucci, opted for a combination of black macassar panelling, crocodile skin, steel and travertine, creating a warm, tactile, bachelor-pad aesthetic in chocolate-browns and creams with chic orange accents. Despite its relatively strong emphasis on design, there is nothing pretentious about The Gray. Although there is currently no spa or gym, two suites have private workout rooms with state-of-the-art weights and cardio machines. ££££\n\nVia San Raffaele 6 (00 39 02 720 8951, sinahotels.com).\n\nTOWN HOUSE\n\nEncouraged by the success of his first hotel, Town House 33 (see below), Alessandro Rosso opened a second property half a mile north of the city centre near the Fiera Milano. Town House 12 upstages its older sister in several ways. It is the only Italian hotel with an Absolut Icebar, where everything from the sofas to the light fittings is made from Norwegian ice. Town House 12 is also cooler from a design point of view. Conceived as a calm, Zen-like retreat, it is predominantly light charcoal-grey, offset with baby-pink cushions, reindeer-skin rugs and antique Oriental chests. The 18 rooms are clean-lined, modern and elegant. The lively and sociable public spaces include a breakfast room (there's no restaurant), a pretty decked terrace with a communal trestle-table; and a 'terrace-bar', half of which is open-air during the summer months. ££\n\n12 Piazza Gerusalemme 12 (00 39 02 89078511; townhouse.it).\n\nTOWN HOUSE\n\nLocated on a residential Via Goldoni, Number 31/33 is a typical bourgeois palazzina of the late 19th century. But as soon as you walk through the side entrance to the courtyard pavilion scattered with red stools and serpentine cushion-sculptures, you realise something unusual is going on. With interiors by Architectural Digest editor Ettore Mochetti, Townhouse 31/33 offers comfort and conviviality with a modern, ethnic edge and has become a home-from-home for fashion professionals. ££\n\n31 Via Goldoni 33 (00 39 02 70156; townhouse.it).\n\nTOWN HOUSE GALLERIA\n\nWhen the Town House Galleria opened in December 2006, it declared itself Italy's first seven-star hotel with prices to match. With 24 suites, it is the only hotel located in the historical Galleria Vittorio Emanuele and the superior service includes a butler per suite. £££££\n\nVia Silvio Pellico 8 (00 39 02 89058297; townhouse.it).\n\nTHE WESTIN PALACE\n\nLavish re-creation of 18th-century French style, with neo-classical details, in an uninspiring 1950s tower. The decor of the reception area is too extravagant to be chic but breathtaking views of the city from the roof garden take in the Duomo, Pirelli tower and Torre Velasca. ££\n\nPiazza della Repubblica 20 (00 39 02 63361; westin.com).\n\nWhere to eat out in Milan\n\nCAFES\n\nCAFE TRUSSARDI\n\nOn a corner opposite the opera house, Trussardi's alla Scala has recently added a ground-floor café, which offers 10 daily changing main dishes backed up by a range of snacks. The first-floor restaurant is in quite another price range.\n\nPiazza della Scala 5 (+39 02 8068 8295; cafetrussardi.it)\n\nCOVA\n\nCova is the classic via Montenapoleone café and teatime at Cova displays the local bourgeoisie in all its awful glory. Get there by 4.30pm to secure a table, and make sure it's in the main room rather than the salon privé behind, where the sightlines are too limited. Order a pot of tea (it's cool to be English at Cova, though asking for milk is taking things a little too far) and a plate of pasticcini (little cakes), and sit back to enjoy the show. Dowagers with hairdos you could land on without a parachute and fake-tanned figli di papa in blue blazers and cravats look through the tourists with a mixture of nonchalance and contempt. Occasional supermodels stray in to binge on Montebianco cream cakes, accompanied by men wearing creative glasses. The service is reassuringly haughty, and prices reassuringly high.\n\nVia Montenapoleone 8 (+39 02 7600 5599; pasticceriacova.it)\n\nLUINI\n\nOne of the few city-centre addresses to offer more than the usual desultory tramezzini (sandwiches) is Luini, a tiny bakery on a side-street off piazza del Duomo. Though the panzerotto, a sort of Cornish pasty made with pizza dough, is a Puglian speciality, milanesi have taken to it with gusto. The classic panzerotto is filled with tomato and mozzarella; but the ricotta e spinaci version is good, too. It's easy to see why the place gets packed with hungry office workers at lunchtime - so come early or be prepared to assert your rights in the ruck.\n\nVia Santa Radegonda 16 (+39 02 8646 1917; luini.it)\n\nPASTICCERIA MARCHESI\n\nIn via Santa Maria alla Porta between the Borsa (stock exchange) and the offices of the Adelphi publishing house - Milan's financial and cultural poles - Marchesi is the opinion-former's favourite breakfast stop. The elegant, mahogany-and-mirrors bar also serves excellent cakes and does a roaring trade on Sunday morning, when coiffed Milanese matriarchs wait imperiously for trays of little paste mignon. It is equally good in the early evening for a Negroni or a Campari soda, served by the inscrutable barmen.\n\nVia Santa Maria alla Porta 11a (+39 02 876 730; pasticceriamarchesi.it).\n\nPASTICCERIA SANT' AMBROEUS\n\nThe soberly elegant decor and the service that is Milan at its most Parisian, establish the credentials of this classic cake-shop and tearoom. Its 1930 design reconciles two contradictory Milanese impulses, a sober work ethic and a taste for luxury. Sit in the pink stucco room and sip your cappuccino in the company of perfectly coiffed Milanese matrons and creative types fuelling up for a hard day in the atelier. For a real sugar rush, order a small plate of ambrogiotti, dark chocolates filled with zabaglione. At Christmas, this is the place to come for a gift-wrapped panettone.\n\nCorso Matteotti 7 (+39 02 7600 0540; santambroeusmilano.it)\n\nRESTAURANTS\n\nALLA CUCINA DELLA LANGHE\n\nTwo doors down from Corso Como 10, this popular restaurant is on two floors with an elegant dining room at street level and a less formal area upstairs. Piedmont classics on the menu include tomini al pepe o alle erbe (small round goat's cheese flavoured with pepper or herbs), Barolo wine risotto, and bagna caòda (literally 'hot bath') - raw vegetables dipped in a sauce of butter, garlic, chopped anchovies and thinly sliced white truffles. The wine list includes a wide range of Piedmont bottles.\n\nCorso Como 6 (+39 02 655 4279, allacucinadellelanghe.it)\n\nRISTORANTE NUOVO MERCATO DEL PESCE\n\nFor a very different suburban outing, head east to Ristorante Nuovo Mercato del Pesce. The setting - in the wasteland of Milan's wholesale food markets - and the kitsch nautical decor may be off-putting, but the fish and seafood, served in a range of classic pasta dishes or simply grilled as a secondo, are squeaky fresh. Outsized bibs are provided for messy eaters.\n\nVia Cesare Lombroso 54 (+39 02 5519 5540)\n\nAL PONT DE FERR\n\nThough the Navigli area is known for its nightlife, a concentration of good-value trattorias make it a good lunch option; many locals actually prefer its more down-to-earth, arty-crafty daytime vibe. One of the best osterie in the area is Michelin-starred Al Pont de Ferr, by the iron canal-bridge that gives the place its name. It serves up honest, filling pasta, meat and fish dishes - plus one daily vegetarian option - in a friendly, bottle-filled, taverna setting.\n\nRipa di Porta Ticinese 55 (+39 02 8940 6277; pontdeferr.it/ristorante)\n\nANTICA TRATTORIA DELLA PESA\n\nThis traditional, unshowy trattoria has a menu that is more oriented towards classics such as risotto alla milanese rather than nouvelle cuisine concoctions. A favourite with publishers such as Rizzoli and Mondadori, the food is reassuringly expensive.\n\nViale Pasubio 10 (+39 02 655 5741; anticatrattoriadellapesa.com)\n\nARMANI NOBU\n\nJapanese chef Nobuyuki Matsuhisa - Nobu for short - holds court (by proxy) in the Spazio Armani, where Armani/Nobu serves up the Latin-tinged Nipponese fusion cooking with which affluent punters in LA, New York, Las Vegas, Tokyo and London are already familiar. The decor, all transparent screens and geometric, ochre-red chairs, is suitably airport-like.\n\nVia Gastone Pisoni 1 (+39 02 7231 8645; noburestaurants.com/milan)\n\nCANTINA DELLA VETRA\n\nCantina della Vetra has a fixed-price brunch menu that includes a generous buffet and one hot dish per person - such as tortelli, risotto or fondue.\n\nVia Pio IV 3 (+39 02 8940 3843; cantinadellavetra.it)\n\nRISTORANTE CRACCO\n\nOne of the most persuasive deal-clinching venues is the newly renovated, coolly modern restaurant of Milanese gastronomic empire Peck. In the hands of rising young chef Carlo Cracco, Cracco-Peck offers serious food and wine at serious prices, but foodies will swoon over dishes such as goat's-milk ravioli with spring onions and Norcia truffles.\n\nVia Victor Hugo 4 (+39 02 876 774; ristorantecracco.it)\n\nDA CLAUDIO PESCHERIA\n\nThe chicest fish shop in Milan, with spectacular crustacea displays around an excellent sushi bar.\n\nVia Cusani 1 (+39 02 805 6857; pescheriadaclaudio.it)\n\nDA GIACOMO\n\nThis anonymous looking trattoria is one of Armani's favourite restaurants. The drab exterior conceals a bright trompe l'oeil interior by the Milanese bourgeoisie's favourite interior designer, the late Renzo Mongiardino. The cuisine is competent but not showy and the portions are large.\n\nVia P Sottocorno 6 (+39 02 7602 3313; giacomoristorante.com)\n\nDA GIANNINO L'ANGOLO D'ABRUZZO\n\nThe cuisine of the Abruzzo has never really taken off in Milan either, and when Giannino and Ersilia d'Orazio, the original owners of Da Giannino retired, everyone assumed this outpost would close. Happily, the new proprietors turned out to be three Abruzzese siblings (Rita, Francesco and Alessandro Calasanzio) with every intention of keeping the restaurant as they found it, with the single exception of making it no-smoking. Of the various pastas, the most typical is maccheroni alla chitarra, a chitarra being a device invented in Abruzzo for cutting fresh pasta dough.\n\nVia Rosolino Pilo 20 (+39 02 2940 6526; dagianninolangolodabruzzo.it)\n\nEL BRELLIN\n\nEl Brellin offers one of the best brunches in Milan, if you can get in. The setting - an ancient laundry house - is idyllic, and the buffet includes couscous with vegetables and a good green lasagne with funghi porcini.\n\nVicolo dei Lavandai, Alzaia Naviglio Grande 14 (+39 02 5810 1351; brellin.it)\n\nDA GIORDANO IL BOLOGNESE\n\nJust off trendy corso Genova, this restaurant specialises in Emilian cuisine with a Bolognese accent - including that much-exported classic spaghetti alla Bolognese. A magnificent buffet dominates the ground-floor dining room where diners help themselves to cold antipasti followed by fresh tagliatelle al ragù and an impeccable costoletta alla Bolognese (like the Milanese version but with ham and cheese). The pièce de résistance, however, is the fritto misto all'Emiliana, a warming mix of fried chicken, lamb, apple and courgettes.\n\nCorso Genova 3, corner of via Torti (+39 02 5810 0824; dagiordanoilbolognese.it)\n\nGIULIO PANE E OJO\n\nRoman cuisine has never made much of an impression in Milan, partly because of the historic competition between the two cities and partly because the strong Lazian flavours are something of an acquired taste. Should you feel like testing the gastronomic waters of the capital region however, this is the place to do it. Two gently-lit rooms set the stage for a series of robust, aromatic dishes including rigatoni con la pajata (pasta with veal innards), calf's tail, and lamb with artichokes. For the uninitiated, dishes such as spaghetti alla carbonara and bucatini all'amatriciana provide less challenging options.\n\nVia Ludovico Muratori 10 (+39 02 545 6189; giuliopaneojo.com)\n\nIL LUOGO DI AIMO E NADIA\n\nAny self-respecting Milanese foodie makes at least one annual pilgrimage to Il Luogo di Aimo e Nadia, in the Western suburbs, to sample a range of creative pan-Italian dishes based on exclusively sourced seasonal ingredients such as Piedmontese guinea fowl.\n\nVia Privata Raimondo Montecuccoli 6 (+39 02 416 886; aimoenadia.com)\n\nJOIA\n\nVegetarians (and non-vegetarians, come to that) should plan a trip around Joia, chef Pietro Leeman's temple to cordon vert cooking, based on the freshest of seasonal vegetables and pulses. To the cry of 'Death to the nut roast!', Leeman leaps into flamboyant creations such as a 'melting flan' of Toma cheese with endives and roast cardoons; elsewhere, tofu, soya and shitake mushrooms give the Med-veg menu an oriental twist.\n\nVia P Castaldi 18 (+39 02 2952 2124; joia.it)\n\nLA CANTINA DI MANUELA\n\nRestaurants don't get more Milanese - or more enjoyable - than La Cantina di Manuela which specialises in cheese and wine. Start with a selection of goat's cheese (with a honey dressing), followed by pasta reginelle (crinkly strips) and a bottle of Piedmont red.\n\nVia Giulio Cesare Procaccini 41 (+39 02 345 2034)\n\nLACERBA\n\nLacerba is a unique, Futurist restaurant whose menu features original Futurist recipes (such as fluffy rice on a bed of spinach topped with fresh peas and crushed pistachio) and whose walls feature murals by Depero and Boccioni.\n\nVia Orti 4 (+39 02 545 5475; lacerba.it)\n\nLA CUCCUMA\n\nLive music, waiters dressed in sailors' uniforms, fake portholes: La Cuccuma has got it all, plus a first-rate Neapolitan menu and agreeably low prices. The music can get a bit loud inside, so ask for a table on the tiny decked terrace. The list of antipasti is endless, but one speciality is the Neapolitan Mozzarelle with textured centres and slightly salty flavour, served whole. Next, opt for a plate of spaghetti alla puttanesca (tomatoes, basil, olives and capers), followed by a superb escalope alla pizzaiola (tomatoes, garlic, capers, oregano) or one of the many deep-pan pizzas, feather-light and hot from the wood oven.\n\nVia Pacini 26 (+39 02 266 4945; ristorantelacuccuma.oneminutesite.it)\n\nL'ALTRA PHARMACIA\n\nMost Milanese kitchens close at about 10.30pm, but the cook at L'Altra Pharmacia keeps going until midnight, so it's the perfect place to drop in for a post-opera bite.\n\nVia Antonio Rosmini 3 (+39 02 345 1300)\n\nLA TRATTORIA MILANESE\n\nLa Trattoria, which opened in 1933, is one of the last restaurants still serving genuine Milanese food. Tucked away behind the stock exchange, tables are arranged in two rooms featuring magnificent brick arches and good still-life oils. The menu is printed using an old-fashioned typewriter and you are advised to opt for the classics: cold mini-cutlets in carpione (onion and vinegar dressing); saffron risotto with ossobuco (veal shank); and a selection of local cheeses, including the mighty Gorgonzola.\n\nVia Santa Marta 11 (+39 02 8645 1991)\n\nLIFEGATE CAFE\n\nEco-café where the menu, written up on blackboars, is 100 per cent organic.\n\nVia della Commenda 43 (+39 02 545 0765)\n\nMAXSIMO\n\nA discreet, family-run establishment with a low-key atmosphere and exciting contemporary design: red-leather padded walls, translucent red lighting 'tubes' set against cream walls, white leather chairs, and a light-wood floor. On the menu, there's potato gnochetti with asparagus and Fontina cheese; baked tuna steak in a bean-and-tomato salsa; and a sophisticated yet satisfying nut-and-honey salad.\n\nVia Ausonio 23 (+39 02 8940 9437).\n\nOSTERIA DI VIA PRE\n\nDespite a recent change of ownership, this historic osteria remains as it has been for years, with the same red seats, photographs of Liguria on the walls and efficient service. Eating here is an uncompromisingly Ligurian experience: focaccia di Recco; abundant antipasti of stuffed vegetables and pignoletti (tiny fried fish); primi such as trofie al pesto; and light secondi such as swordfish carpaccio.\n\nVia Casale 4 (+39 36 6159 7478; viapre.it)\n\nTRATTORIA OTTIMOFIORE\n\nThis restaurant's chef-owner has, for the past 15 years, formed one of the main points of reference for Sicilian cuisine in Milan. A help-yourself table of antipasti sets the tone, with fried gianchetti, Sicilan olives, and delicious polpettine of meat, vegetables and garlic. Pasta courses include pasta alla Norma (tomatoes, aubergine and salted ricotta), and notable secondi include a tuna steak with capers, olives, tomatoes and lemon. If only there was more space between tables.\n\nVia Bramante 26 (+39 02 3310 1224)\n\nPIERO E PIA\n\nOnce a scruffy working-class area, the Città Studi (so called because of the nearby polytechnic) is now a smart district with some excellent restaurants. Piero e Pia is a small, family-run establishment with a bland café-style dining room and a few tables out front. In contrast, the food, most of which is typical of Piacenza, is the height of regional sophistication. An antipasto of mortadella ham infused with truffles was pungent and moreish; pisarei e fasò (mini gnocchi in a bean and tomato sauce) was rich without being heavy; and a lamb cutlet bathed in a marsala sauce was sensational. There is no great wine local to Piacenza, so the list sensibly favours Piedmont varieties.\n\nPiazza Aspari 2 (+39 02 718 541; pieroepia.com)\n\nRIGOLO\n\nWith its white linen tablecloths and ageing waiters, Rigolo looks very formal but is actually delightfully relaxed in a calm, old-fashioned way. The food is Tuscan (fresh pappardelle with wild boar), the service impeccable, and foreigners are welcomed with open arms.\n\nLargo Treves/via Solferino 11 (+39 02 8646 3220; rigolo.it)\n\nRISTORIANTE GALLURA\n\nWhen you've had your fill of cutting-edge contemporary design, book a table at Gallura where the walls are painted with seaside scenes surrounded by fake treasures and plastic rocks. The food, though, is a serious affair, served by sombre Sardinian waiters who - correctly - explain the preponderance of fish dishes as modern Sardinian cuisine. If you like strong flavours, try the hot octopus salad followed by linguine alla gallurese (with clams and fish eggs). The gnocchetti Sardi (with tomatoes and sausage) is less of an acquired taste. Finish with a chunk of fresh Pecorino Sardo cheese.\n\nVia Vittoria Colonna 50 (+39 02 462 896; gallura1988.it)\n\nSPEAKEASY\n\nSpeakeasy, in the heart of the picturesque Brera district, is a bar-restaurant with jazz portraits on the wall, a few tables outside, and a good Italo-American brunch menu that includes fried eggs with bacon and roast potatoes.\n\nVia Castelfidardo 7 (+39 02 653 645)\n\nTAVERNA VISCONTI\n\nAurora is a well-established local favourite with a cosy turn-of the-century room for winter dining and a glorious garden shaded by vines for the summer. Impeccable Piedmont antipasti include roast peppers in bagna caòda and wafer-thin veal in a creamy sauce; the pasta of choice is agnolotti del plin - stuffed ravioli tossed in butter and sage; and substantial secondi such as gran misto di arrosti allo spiedo (roast meat on skewers) are enough to satisfy the heartiest of appetites.\n\nVia F Corridoni 10 (+39 02 5410 2437, tavernavisconti.it)\n\nVALTELLINA\n\nThe cuisine of the Valtellina area can be sampled at this alpine-style restaurant which has a lovely shady garden. The menu is seasonal, with dishes such as sciatt (small, fried, cheese-filled buckwheat pastries), bresaola, slinzighe and violino (local hams), and potato and mushroom tart. Main courses tend to be substantial even in summer, and there's no doubting the quality: tender venison steak; creamy polenta with funghi porcini; and excellent home-made puddings. For a truly Milanese mix of neighbourhood simplicity and in-the-know cool, head for one of the few surviving latterie, or dairy shops. Originally only the simplest pasta dishes, dressed with butter and cheese were served at these, but now they offer a wider menu. Only a handful are left in Milan's suburbs.\n\nVia Taverna 34 (+39 02 756 1139, ivaltellina.it)\n\nTwo of the most authentic are the following:\n\nALLA VECCHIA LATTERIA\n\nThis lunch-only place has been run by the Notari family for almost half a century.\n\nVia dell' Unione 4-6 (+39 02 874 401)\n\nLATTERIA SAN MARCO\n\nThis is a more restaurant-like latteria.\n\nVia San Marco 24 (+39 02 659 7653)\n\nThe best nightlife in Milan\n\nBARS\n\nBridging the gap between lunch and supper with a cocktail accompanied by complimentary canapés is a long-standing Milanese tradition. Unsurprisingly, the city has aperitivo bars of every stripe.\n\nH CLUBDIANA\n\nThe Sheraton's HClub Diana is an Art-Nouveau jewel that occupies the site of Milan's first public swimming pool. Composed of various complementary areas (including an indoor foyer, patio, courtyard and breathtaking lounge), the bar has become \"the\" place for the Milanese to enjoy aperitif. The club is known for its seasonal restyling, the emphasis being on the hotel's magical garden, with its contemporary lounge in the gazebo and the total black courtyard that acts as a summer extension of the famous black label room. The bar boasts an extensive cocktail list (try the caipirinha) and is renowned for having the best International DJs.\n\nSheraton Diana Majestic, Viale Piave 42 (+39 02 2058 2004; hclub-diana.it)\n\nJUST CAVALLI CAFE\n\nAt Roberto Cavalli's via della Spiga showroom, a futuristic, leather-lined lift leads down to a sexy basement bar-café where Milan's fashion set perch on zebra print banquettes to enjoy cocktails and a feast of nibbles surrounded by mirrored surfaces, loud colours and a wall-sized aquarium.\n\nVia Luigi Camoens c/o Torre Branca (+39 02 311 817; milano.cavalliclub.com)\n\nMARTINI BAR AT DOLCE & GABBANA\n\nThe Martini Bar at Dolce & Gabbana boasts one of the most sophisticated interiors around (black-leather sofas; a drop-dead-gorgeous Murano chandelier) and also serves awesome aperitivi, including decorative caprese kebabs and fresh bruschetta.\n\nCorso Venezia 15 (+39 02 7601 1154; dolcegabbana.com/martini)\n\nPASTICCERIA SANT'AMBROEUS\n\nThe aperitivo cult also has a more sedate, less pubby side, celebrated especially in those pasticcerie or cake shops which in Milan (as in Venice) double up as purveyors of cocktails and savoury nibbles. The Pasticceria Sant'Ambroeus is a classic of the genre, with a clientele as unchanging as the ultra-conservative 1940s decor.\n\nCorso Matteotti 7 (+39 02 7600 0540; santambroeusmilano.it)\n\nSHU\n\nJust east of the Navigli district, Shu is a very sharp, very designed, very green bar-restaurant for the Prada generation. In the centre of the restaurant space, a 1950s-revisited ceiling is held up by a huge gold forearm. Don't come here in last decade's Marks & Spencer hand-me-downs - unless, of course, you're setting a new trend. Admission free.\n\nVia Molino delle Armi/via della Chiusa (+39 02 5831 5720)\n\nTRUSSARDI ALLA SCALA CAFE\n\nAnother fashion bar doing its best to please is the Trussardi alla Scala Café, where a well-dressed crowd gathers around a large central bar for hot, breaded olives and smoked salmon on soft, white bread.\n\nPiazza della Scala 5 (+39 02 8068 8201; trussardiallascala.com)\n\nYGUANA CAFE\n\nYguana Café has the largest selection of aperitivi in Milan, including cold quiche, rice salads and chunks of crumbly Parmesan. The quality is average but the view of the church of San Lorenzo is unique.\n\nVia Papa Gregorio XIV 16 (+39 02 8940 4195)\n\nZUCCA IN GALLERIA\n\nLiquor aficionados will want to pay a visit to Zucca in Galleria, on a corner where the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele emerges into piazza del Duomo. It was here that Gaspare Campari's alcoholic infusion of herbs was launched in the 1860s; and after a 1996 refurbishment that returned the Art Nouveau fittings and mosaics to their original glory, Zucca is still a good place to look cool over a Campari soda.\n\nPiazza del Duomo 21 (+39 02 8646 4435; caffemiani.it)\n\nNIGHTCLUBS\n\nARMANI PRIVE\n\nJoin the fashion pack at Armani Privé, the stylish nightclub located below the chic Japanese Armani/Nobu restaurant. The Japanese theme continues downstairs with tatami-style floor, opaque port-hole panels and cube-shaped armchairs.\n\nVia Pisoni 1 (00 39 02 6231 2655; armaniristorante.com)\n\nALCATRAZ\n\nThe huge but laid-back Alcatraz is particularly gratifying on Friday disco nights for those whose musical memories stretch back beyond Britney Spears.\n\nVia Valtellina 25 (+39 02 6901 6352; alcatrazmilano.it)\n\nLE BANQUE\n\nFor the quintessential Milanese nightspot, head for Le Banque, in the financial district. After dining in the louche, opulent, overpriced restaurant upstairs, one can descend to the dance floor in the high-security vault of this former bank, arm in arm with one's silicon-and/or hair-implanted partner.\n\nVia Porrone 6 (+39 34 0980 5101; lebanque.it)\n\nMAGAZZINI GENERALI\n\nMagazzini Generali is a rehauled industrial warehouse and one of best places to work up a sweat.\n\nVia Pietrasanta 14 (+39 02 539 3948; magazzinigenerali.it)\n\nWhat to see in Milan\n\nMUSEUMS AND ART GALLERIES\n\nCASA MUSEO BOSCHI-DI STEFANO\n\nThe Casa Museo Boschi-Di Stefano, which has an outstanding collection of 20th-century Italian art, is uniquely Milanese thanks to the presence of paintings by Futurists such as Boccioni, Carrà and Severini who, inspired by the vigour and speed of industrial Milan, produced works that perfectly encapsulate the aggressive, unforgiving nature of the Lombardian capital 80 years ago. The 2,000-piece collection - which also features work by Morandi, Fontana and de Chirico - is also 'local' in character in that it remains within the 1930s apartment of its former owners, Antonio Boschi and Marieda Di Stefano who, late in life, decided to donate the property and its contents to the state. Open Tues-Sun, 10am-6pm.\n\nVia Jan 15 (+39 02 7428 1000; fondazioneboschidistefano.it)\n\nMUSEO BAGATTI VALSECCHI\n\nWhen brothers Fausto and Giuseppe Bagatti Valsecchi moved into their purpose-built palazzo in fashionable via Santo Spirito in 1883, they were determined not to bow to the taste of the times. In some ways, they were modern Milanese gentlemen, whose outdoor interests ranged from cycling to hot-air ballooning. But their interior-design obsessions were decidedly retro: as devotees of the Lombard Renaissance, they had their new home fitted out as a replica of an early 16th-century Milanese nobleman's abode. As there were very few original pieces left on the antique market, they achieved this effect by mixing authentic items - paintings, marble fireplaces, gilded pastiglia boxes, ivory sundials - with specially commissioned copies made by some of the leading craftsmen of the day. The result, which opened to the public in 1994 as the Museo Bagatti Valsecchi, is a fascinating study in the history of taste and contains more than a few artistic gems, including Giovanni Bellini's airy, statuesque Santa Giustina. Even mod cons such as the piano and the bathtub - with running water, an innovation for the 1880s - were carefully masked to fit into the overall scheme. Open Tues-Sun, 1pm-5.45pm.\n\nVia Santo Spirito 10 (+39 02 7600 6132; museobagattivalsecchi.org)\n\nMUSEO POLDI-PEZZOLI\n\nThe must-see old-master canvases and sculptures are spread out thinly between four galleries: the Brera (Mantegna's Dead Christ, Raphael's Marriage of the Virgin); the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana (Caravaggio's Basket of Fruit); the museums of the Castello Sforzesco (Filippo Lippi's Madonna dell'Umiltà and the magnificent, unfinished Pietà Rondanini, one of Michelangelo's last sculptures); and the Museo Poldi-Pezzoli. In 1879, gentleman of leisure Gian Giacomo Poldi-Pezzoli specified that his 17th-century palazzo on via Manzoni and the art collection it contained should be accessible to the public after his death; when the museum, which is run as a private foundation, opened in 1881, it was one of the first such house-galleries in Europe. It is a jewel-case of a gallery, with a collection of 15th- to 18th-century Italian masters that includes Antonio Pollaiuolo's iconic Portrait of a Young Woman - the one with the pretty nose and the 'Haven't you finished yet?' expression. Alongside the Mantegnas, Bellinis and della Francescas are some fine examples of decorative art, such as Persian carpets, Arabic metalwork and Murano glass. Open Tues-Sun, 10am-6pm.\n\nVia Manzoni 12 (+39 02 79 4889; museopoldipezzoli.it)\n\nOPERA\n\nTEATRO ALLA SCALA\n\nBook at least two months in advance for a regular performance, or six months for a prima (first night). The opening night of the seven-month season on 7 December - the feast day of Milan's patron saint, Ambrogio - is virtually impossible to get into unless you are a season-ticket holder or a celebrity. The best way to book from abroad is through La Scala's website. For those without a booking there are various options, none of them easy. Start by going to the box office: some of the pricier tickets may still be on sale a few days before a performance. If that doesn't work, try your hotel concierge, who may 'know somebody'. As a last resort, go back to La Scala and peruse the complicated rules posted in the foyer (in Italian) for securing one of the 139 standing places, which are sold half an hour before each performance - but only to those who got up at an unearthly hour to queue for one of the tickets that gives them the right to queue for a ticket later that day.\n\nPiazza della Scala (+39 02 88791; teatroallascala.org)\n\nPARKS\n\nGIARDINI PUBBLICI\n\nThe Giardini Pubblici, at the end of via Manzoni, is Milan's favourite family park. Come here for swans, swings, ponies and an attempt at the sort of craggy landscaping that the city otherwise so noticeably lacks. There is a planetarium, a natural history museum, and a charming 1960s-style chalet bar, Bar Bianco, run by Central del Latte di Milano, the city's dairy cooperative; generous filled rolls and salads, milkshakes, and Mr Whippy-style ice creams are sure to take the edge off any appetite.\n\nBastioni di Porta Venezia\n\nGIARDINI DI VILLA REALE\n\nFor something a little more secluded, head for the Giardini Pubblicci's less well-known extension, Giardini di Villa Reale, on the other side of via Palestro, behind the imposing neoclassical palace of Villa Reale. Landscaped in the stile inglese in the 1790s, the gardens have sweeping lawns (popular for wedding photos) and a small lake complete with Doric temple.\n\nVia Palestro\n\nSIGHTS\n\nABBAZIA DI CHIARAVALLE\n\nOn the south-eastern edge of Milan, not far from the San Donato spaghetti junction, is one of Italy's most charming Cistercian monasteries: Abbazia di Chiaravalle (to get there, take the M3 metro line to Corvetto, then a number 77 bus). Founded in 1135, the church and cloisters are Gothic in style but charmingly Lombard in their use of the local building material: brick. Inside the church is a good fresco by Bernardino Luini; the restful main cloister, with its double columns, is a good place to unwind when the city gets too much - at least until the next jet bound for Linate airport roars overhead. Open Tues-Sun.\n\nVia Sant' Arialdo 102 (+39 02 5740 3404; monasterochiaravalle.it)\n\nCASA DI RIPOSO PER MUSICISTI FONDAZIONE GIUSEPPE VERDI\n\nA magnificent late 19th-century palazzo conceived and financed by Verdi to house retired musicians. You can't tour the building but you can see the composer's opulent tomb.\n\nPiazza Buonarroti 29 (+39 02 499 6009; casaverdi.org)\n\nCENACOLO VINCIANO (THE LAST SUPPER)\n\nSince the Tuscan master's severely faded al secco wall-painting, known in Italian as the Cenacolo Vinciano, was reopened to public view after restoration in 1999, admission has been by appointment only, in groups of 25. Ring ahead to book. Those who turn up without a booking are admitted only in place of no-shows, and can expect a wait of an hour or more. Bookings should be made at least a week in advance for Saturday and Sunday slots; during the week, two days' notice is often enough. After the booking, the wait at the door and the three-stage acclimatisation chamber (with automatic sliding doors designed to keep the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie at optimal temperature and humidity), seeing the painting itself has a smack of the emperor's new clothes about it, so badly has Leonardo's experimental tempera-and-glue medium withstood the test of time. But then one notices the dynamic balance of the figures, and details such as the glass in the bottom right-hand corner of the table, glowing with a Vermeer-like inner light. Open Tues-Sun, 8am-7pm.\n\nPiazza Santa Maria delle Grazie 2 (+39 02 9280 0360; cenacolovinciano.org)\n\nCIMITERO MONUMENTALE\n\nTram numbers 3, 4, 12 and 14 will take you out to the Cimitero Monumentale with its huge family mausoleums that are not that different from the houses of the good Milanese burghers who rest there. Some, such as the Civico Mausoleo Palanti (used as an air-raid shelter during World War II), are multi-occupant mortuary apartment blocks; others are works of art - sculptors Arturo Martini, Giacomo Manzà; and Lucio Fontana (the ripped canvas man) are all represented. One of the most moving tombs is the temple to composer Arturo Toscanini's infant son, decorated with scenes of the boy at play. Open Tues-Sat, 8.30am-5pm; Sun 8.30am-1pm.\n\nPiazzale Cimitero Monumentale (+39 02 8844 1274)\n\nROTONDA DI VIA BESANA\n\nA former 17th-century church and burial ground that was recently transformed into a beautiful exhibition venue. Open Tues-Sun.\n\nVia Besana 12 (+39 02 4398 0402; muba.it)\n\nVIEWS OF THE CITY\n\nCASTELLO SFORZESCO"
