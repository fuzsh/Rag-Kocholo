        "text": "Welcome to the best roads on the planet\n\nWe immediately fell in love After going to Sardinia in 2020. The hotel is amazing, the water is ultra-clear, and all the roads are fantastic. This is heaven for driving a Ferrari or Lamborghini.\n\nIt is also here we found SS125 Orientale Sarda, the best road we have ever driven. And we have been exploring Europe with supercars for two decades now. SS125 is that good. It will take your breath away.\n\nThe event starts in Grand Hotel Poltu Quatu and ends at the legendary Cala di Volpe in Costa Smeralda. The James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me made the hotel famous. Many of the locations from the movie you will recognise on this tour, including the beach where James appeared with his submarine white Lotus Esprit.\n\nThe hotel selection for 2024\n\nAll hotels en route are iconic heavyweight luxury venues. Here is the hotel selection for our 2025 tour:\n\nGrand Hotel Poltu Quatu *****L (Costa SMeralda)\n\nSu Gologone **** (Oliena)\n\nPalazzo Tirso ***** (Cagliari)\n\nIl Arenas resort ***** (Narbolia)\n\nIl Faro Hotel & Spa **** (Alghero)\n\nCala di Volpe *****L (Costa Smeralda, two nights)\n\nSeven days on tour\n\nWe make a full lap of Sardinia, driving the top roads of the Island and staying in the best hotels.
