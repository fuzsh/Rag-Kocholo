        "text": "Discovering the Thrills of Touring The Amazing Roads of Sardinia\n\n/\n\nDISCOVER THE THRILLS OF TOURING THE AMAZING ISLAND OF SARDINIA\n\nYour Ultimate Sardinia Motorcycle Itinerary Guide\n\nAre you thinking of going on a Motorcycle adventure to Sardinia? Then you’re in the right place.\n\nThis Sardinia Motorcycle Itinerary will take you where the thrill of the open road meets breathtaking landscapes and captivating culture.\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned rider or a motorcycle enthusiast looking to explore a new destination, Sardinia is the perfect playground for adrenaline junkies and travel enthusiasts alike. With its winding coastal roads, dramatic cliffs, and charming hilltop villages, this Mediterranean gem offers an unforgettable experience for any motorcycle enthusiast.\n\nIn this comprehensive motorcycle itinerary guide, we will take you on a journey through Sardinia’s most exhilarating routes, ancient ruins, and off-the-beaten-path hidden gems.\n\nTHE PLAN\n\nSardinia was a dream destination for us as motorcycle enthusiasts, so careful planning is essential to make the most of our trip. First, we decided on the duration of our trip and the best time to visit. Since Sardinia is a huge Island- the second largest in the Mediterranean, we set aside 6 full days to ride around Sardinia. This is NOT including the 2 nights spent on the ferry from Sicily to Sardinia and back.\n\nSo, if you only have a few days, it’s wise to choose only a particular region to explore, for instance, North or West Sardinia.\n\nTHE BEST TIME TO VISIT SARDINIA\n\nSardinia has a Mediterranean climate, with mild winters and hot summers. The shoulder seasons of spring and autumn are ideal for motorcycle trips, as the weather is pleasant and the roads are less crowded. We travelled through Sardinia in the last week of April 2023 and it was perfect!\n\nSo, once you have figured out the best time for you and how long you want to spend in Sardinia, you can go on to plan where to go and what to do.\n\nHere’s what our plan looked like. You can always mix and match to fit your needs.\n\nHere's a quick itinerary of our motorcycle ride through Sardinia\n\nFULL MAP OF OUR ROUTE\n\nThis post is purely informational and based on our own experiences. We also use affiliate links which help us keep this website running, at no cost to you.\n\nThis route took us coast to coast for a total of about 1,200km. at an average speed of about 100km/h on highways and 50km/h on high mountain curves. Our maximum elevation was 1,017m above sea level in the Supramonte mountain region in the northeast of the island.\n\nNow for the details.\n\nDAY 1 Sardinia Motorcycle Tour: CALGIARI- BOSA\n\nExploring the coastal roads and beaches of Western Sardinia\n\nDISTANCE\n\n299.6KM\n\nROUTE\n\nCagliary – Iglesias – Oristano - Bosa\n\nDURATION\n\n5 hrs, 38 mins and 20 secs\n\nOur first point of entry into Sardinia was Cagliari, the capital of Sardinia. We started early and headed west through the SS130, SS126 and SP83 to the province of Iglesias, and then continuing on the SS126 and joining the SP6 TO Bosa, in the Province of Oristano.\n\nPlaces of interest along the way\n\n1. Porto Flavia, Masau Beach and Pan Di Zucchero Rock\n\nPorto Flavia is an abandoned mining complex built into a high rock facing the sea and the intriguing limestone rock of Pan Di Zuccero. Visits to the mine are guided and restricted so booking in advance is adviced. You can get your tickets now to save time and possible disappointment like it happened to us.\n\nA bonus experience would be seeing Porto Flavia and Pan Di Zucherro from the direction of the sea. It is definitely a different perspective and a special sight to behold. To do that you can take a boat trip from the nearby Masau beach. There are tours of 1hr, 2hrs or 3hrs.\n\n2. The Old Mining Town of Ingurtosu\n\nSardinia is full of mystery and history, one of which is its collection of mining ghost towns which have been abandoned since the early 1920s. Some of these old mines form part of the UNESCO network of GeoParks\n\nSo taking a detour from the SS126 to the SP66 towards the deserted ghost village of Ingurtosu, we were slightly spooked by the eerie feeling of a place that was perhaps quickly abandoned and looks like it’s waiting for the return of its inhabitants. Here, on a road barely travelled, you can stop and imagine what it must have been like back when it was bustling with activity.\n\n3. The Dunes of Piscinas\n\nContinuing west towards the west coast on the SP66, is the famous “Beach of Golden Sand”, a Sahara-like oasis with dunes as high as 60 meters stretching over 20km. This has earned it the title “The Desert of the Mediterranean”. At the same time, Piscinas enjoys the status of being the highest dunes in all of Europe.\n\n4. Is Arutas Beach\n\nNext, we headed back on the SP66, joining the E25 and SP6 to another remarkable beach, known for its small, smooth quartz stone “sand”. Also called “Rice Beach” by the locals, it is surely a beach not to miss. We absolutely enjoyed dipping our feet in the grainy beach and marvelling at how soft it was. Plus, it doesn’t get sticky so it’s very easy to get off your body.\n\nSee Related articles:\n\nUltimate Sicily Itinerary: Treasures of Northern and Western Sicily\n\nExploring Tunisia: An Adventure-Packed Motorcycle Ride\n\nDAY 2 Sardinia Motorcycle Tour: BOSA-ALGHERO\n\nRiding through the wild nature reserves and scenic routes of Northwest Sardinia\n\nDISTANCE\n\n113.3 Km\n\nROUTE\n\nBosa – Alghero\n\nDURATION\n\n3 hrs, 0 mins and 10 secs\n\nWe had arrived Bosa late the previous night so we visited the town the next day before heading northwest on the SP49 and SP105 along the wild nature reserve of Porto Conte towards the medieval coastal town of Alghero and what is known as “The Coral Coast” due to the high presence of corals in its pristine blue waters.\n\nPlaces of interest along the way\n\n1. The Colorful Village of Bosa and Its Imposing Medieval Malaspina Castle\n\nSet along the banks of the river Temo in northwest Sardinia, Bosa is renowned for being one of the most beautiful villages in Italy due to its colourful architecture and romantic narrow streets with a festive atmosphere that is truly representative of the “La Dolce Vita” Italian lifestyle.\n\nThat evening, we were delighted to discover another popular side of Bosa, the beer festival held yearly in April. We had a really good time strolling the river banks with all its lights and tasting a few local beers. Then we walked the dreamy cobblestoned medieval streets to end the day.\n\nThe next day, we rode to the top of the hill of Serravale where a true medieval castle sits atop the hill, dominating the village below.\n\nThe Castle of Serravale was built by the noble Malaspina Dello Spino Secco family from Tuscany, Italy, from which it derives its second name- Castello Dei Malaspina. Nowadays, it’s mostly in ruins but you can visit the inside of the castle, walk its walls and get an amazing view of Bosa for just 4 Euros.\n\n2. The Nuragic Complex of Palmavera\n\nIf you’ve never heard of the pre-historic settlements of Sardinia, then you haven’t truly known Sardinia. In short, a NURAGHE is a megalithic round stone edifice from the mid-Bronze Age, built of limestone and sandstone. With over 800 Nuraghi settlements scattered around the island, we decided to find sites that aren’t overcrowded with tourists, where we could enjoy the places in relative peace.\n\nThe Nuragic complex of Palmavera is called a complex because it comprises 50 huts and 3 central towers of varying heights from 4-6 meters. This is definitely a great place to know about the history of ancient Sardinia because there is good information about this archaeological site. It can be visited without pre-booking although the opening times change depending on the season.\n\nAt just 5 euros, this ancient structure site is definitely worth a visit.\n\n3. Grotta Di Nettuno (Neptune's Grotto)\n\n14km north of the Nuragic Complex of Palmavera, we arrived at NEPTUNE’S GROTTO, a stalactite cave at the foot of the 110-metre-high Capo Caccia cliff. Visiting the Cave depends very much on the sea conditions due to the entrance being at sea level. There are two ways to get there. One is by boat (the easier way), and the other by road and a “wonderful” 654 steps (plus another 80 or so steps on the inside) down the cliffside known as “goats step” (Don’t ask us why!). And the way up is just as wonderful- that is if you love climbing and hiking!\n\nOf course, visits are guided and tickets cost 14 Euros. Neptune’s Grotto is open from 9 am till 7pm if the god of the sea is in a good mood!\n\n4. Belvedere Foradada (Porto Conte Nature Park)\n\nHeading back to our hotel in Alghero on the SP55, less than 2km of Neptune’s Grotto, we stopped along the road at a panoramic spot providing breathtaking views on both sides. To one side, the Foradada Island and the Capo Caccia cave, while to the other, the Tower of Bollo and the quaint village of Tramariglio.\n\nDAY 3 Sardinia Motorcycle Tour: ALGHERO – LA CALETTA\n\nDiscovering Ancient Sardinia and a ride along the coastal roads of Costa Smeralda\n\nDISTANCE\n\n272.7 Km\n\nROUTE\n\nAlghero – Castelsardo – Santa Teresa Gallura – La Caletta\n\nDURATION\n\n4 hrs, 43 mins and 31 secs\n\nOn our 3rd day of our Sardinia motorcycle tour, we continued north on the SP19 and SS291 pass Sassari and towards the coastal roads of SP81 with spectacular sea views and bays. Next, we rode up north and stated our round trip back along the northeastern coastal roads to the port town of La Caletta.\n\nPlaces of interest along the way\n\n1. The Elephant Rock\n\nStanding just on the side of the old SS134 road, frequented mostly by those who know about this local monument, at 4m in height, this fascinating piece of rock attests to both the actions of man and nature.\n\nCarved by the action of the winds and elements into the shape of an elephant, this special rock also contains 2 ancient tombs set neatly in the Elephant’s “womb”. Which came first though, no one knows.\n\n2. Lu Brandali Nuragic Complex\n\nRiding 67km north on the SP90 from the Elephant Rock, in the quaint fishing village of Santa Teresa di Gallura, we arrived at another Nuragic complex called, Lu Brandali.\n\nWhat makes this ancient settlement special is the presence of another mysterious piece of Sardinian history- “The Tomb of Giants”, which apparently are rumoured to have housed giant bones (nothing confirmed!).\n\n3. The Panoroma of Costa Smeralda\n\nSardinia’s Costa Smeralda, or Emerald Coast, is renowned for its crystal-clear turquoise waters, pristine beaches, and luxurious resorts.\n\nFrom Santa Teresa di Gallura we rode northeast on the SS133 and SS125, enjoying the spectacular panorama of the coast, so blue that it was named The Emerald Coast.\n\nAlthough we didn’t visit the area, we enjoyed the spectacular views from atop our two-wheeled carriage.\n\nDAY 4 Sardinia Motorcycle Tour: LA CALETTA- TORTOLLI\n\nRiding the Supramonte Region, and the Winding Roads of the Route SS125\n\nDISTANCE\n\n140.7 Km\n\nROUTE\n\nLa Caletta – Dorgali – Urzulei – Baunei – Tortoli\n\nDURATION\n\n2 hrs, 59 mins and 0 secs\n\nDay 4 of our Sardinia motorcycle tour was one full of exciting curves and unforgettable moments. We set off early from La Caletta starting with one of the most famous roads amongst motorcyclists in Europe, the highly versatile hit-road, ROUTE SS125 LEGENDARY.\n\nPlaces of interest along the way\n\n1. Strada Statale 125 Orientale Sarda Aka Route SS 125 Legendary\n\nRiding Sardinia without experiencing this incredibly perfect road, is like boiling pasta without salt- bland!\n\nKnown as one of the most beautiful roads in Italy, the SS 125 connects northern Sardinia (from Quartucciu) with South Sardinia (to Cagliari) along the eastern part of the island.\n\nWith asphalt that grips perfectly and varying types of winding curvy roads, what makes it a rider’s heaven is that it weaves around mountains and then brings you close to the sea and then back to the lush green countryside again, showing you along the way, that Sardinia has a lot more to offer than just beaches. The SS125 takes you through charming towns like Olbia and Porto Cervo where you can enjoy a quick dip if you wish.\n\nOur Route SS125 journey had begun the day before starting in Palau and riding through the dazzling blue coast of northeastern Sardinia. So now we continued zigzagging the curves hugging the Supramonte mountains from La Caletta to Tortoli.\n\n2. Giants' Grave Of S'Ena'E Thomes\n\nWhile riding the SS125, we took a quick detour at Orosei on the SS131, and excitedly headed for one of the most important Nuragic Burial Monuments in Sardinia. The majestic standing Giant’s Grave of S’Ena E Thomes is located just off the road at a nondescript area with nothing else in sight for miles so it’s very easy to miss if you don’t know that it’s there. To get to the tomb we had to go pass a gate that seemed “locked” but not trying hard to keep anyone away. Then we walked about 500 meters to a clearing in a large open field where the sight of a giant slab of granite dominates the entire area.\n\n3. Lago Del Cedrino (Cedrino Lake)\n\nBack on the SS125, riding through the commune of Dorgali in the Supramonte mountain area, we stopped to admire the delightful manmade Lago del Cedrino, created as a result of the construction of a dam in the Rio Flumineddu in the early 80s. Here, nature lovers can go kayaking while enjoying the surrounding hills and forests on their way to the sea. Yes!\n\n4. Gola Di Gorropu (Gorropu Canyon)\n\n21km of winding high mountain roads later (still on SS125), we arrived at another amazing place of natural beauty in Sardinia.\n\nRegarded as the deepest canyon in Italy and one of its kind in Europe, Gorropu is unique in the sense that its limestone walls go as high as 500m and it narrows down in some places to 4m gorges.\n\nThe Canyon is loved by hikers and can be trekked with or without a guide. From the base camp in Urzulei, one can take a jeep ride for 25 Euro to within the canyon and then go on a 6km hike.\n\nOn arrival, we were too late to catch the last jeep so it is definitely wise to check out all the necessary information and different hiking options if you plan to hike the canyon.\n\n5. Passo Ghenna ‘E Silana\n\nA short ride of 7.4km south of SS125 brought us to another really interesting place where you can also access the Gorropu Canyon. But Passo Ghenna ‘e Sileana is much more than another entrance to the canyon. Just on the other side of the hiking trail entrance is Bar Silana, a place for motorcyclists and other tourists on the Route SS125 Orientale to stop for an energizing espresso and pick up a souvenir or two.\n\nOur Favourite Travel Resources\n\nHOTELS\n\nBooking.com has always been our go-to for finding and booking both affordable and luxurious accommodation.\n\nExpedia UK is especially useful if you live in the UK but you can still book with them regardless.

Route SS 125 Legendary (Contd)\n\nWe continued to enjoy this amazing panoramic mountain road while stopping a few times to appreciate the pure unspoilt beauty of the mountain ranges, lakes, green fields, and the sea along the way.\n\n2. The Nuragic Sanctuary of Santa Vittoria Di Serri\n\nRiding inland towards central Sardinia, we went in search of another intriguing piece of Sardinian history and culture. Located 630m above sea level, the archeological site tells a long and deep story of traditions with the Well Temple, The Sacred Way, and other structures that point towards ancient rituals and customs.\n\nIn addition, you can clearly see how religion has evolved and become interwoven in the fabric of Sardinian society through the introduction of the Romanesque-style church of Santa Vittoria that stands a few meters from the Nuragic well and which was built on top of the ruins of an older Roman place of worship.\n\nGiven the size and importance of this Nuragic site, we were pleasantly surprised to have had the entire place to ourselves to explore at will and it was amazing! Moreover, an added bonus was the view of the landscape and the village of Serri from atop the hill.\n\n3. Nuraghe Piscu\n\nAfter our euphoric experience at the Sanctuary of Santa Vittoria, we continued our ride southward on the SS128 with no other intentions but to arrive at our hotel in Cagliari and perhaps, see a little of the city before dark.\n\nIt was, therefore, a pleasant surprise that barely 50km from Cagliari, we saw the top of a nuraghe ruin in the distance, surrounded by fields of poppy and grass. On a whim, we decided to stop and see what it was all about.\n\nFrom the road, one can only see about 2 meters of the main tower poking out like a thumb. On closer inspection, we walked back over 2,100 years in time into a stone village and a tower, 9 meters high and 11 meters high with 2 niches at the entrance. The feeling of being in a holy place was so deep and powerful that it just left us speechless.\n\n4. Cagliari At Night\n\nFinally, we arrived at Cagliari via SS131. After checking into our hotel, we headed out to see the medieval capital city of Sardinia.\n\nWe had a relaxing evening climbing the regal steps and strolling the walls of the Bastione Di Saint Remy, where we were dazzled by one of the fieriest and most beautiful sunsets ever. Next, we took a walk in the narrow cobblestoned streets admiring the architecture and festive air all around.\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\n5 Most Scenic Places To Visit In Puglia, Italy\n\n5 Most Scenic Places To Visit In Puglia, Italy\n\nRead Post\n\nAwesome and Practical Gift Ideas For Motorcycle Lovers\n\nAwesome and Practical Gift Ideas For Motorcycle Lovers\n\nRead Post\n\nPros and Cons of Motorcycle Riding Solo/2-Up or in a Group\n\nPros and Cons of Motorcycle Riding Solo/2-Up or in a Group\n\nRead Post\n\nDAY 5 Sardinia Motorcycle Tour: TORTOLLI - CAGLIARI\n\nGetting Touristy in the Medieval Capital City of Cagliari\n\nAlas! We came to our last day of our amazing Sardinia Motorcycle Tour right where we had started. Since we had the ferry back to Palermo at 6 pm, we had most of the morning and part of the afternoon to visit the city.\n\nFirst, we started from the historic district of Castello with some major attractions like the Baroque Cathedral of Santa Maria, The Tower of St. Pancrazi, the highest tower in Cagliari, Pallazzo Delle Seziate, The Arsenal Square and Piazza Palazzo.\n\nNext, a couple hundred meters walk northward, we came across an ancient site, younger than the Nuraghi but still old enough to be considered ancient- The Roman Amphitheatre of Cagliari. We also had some time to visit the modest Capuchin church of Sant’Antonio di Padova.\n\nAnd with this, we came to the end of our epic motorcycle trip in Sardinia, tired but satisfied.\n\nLIKE THIS POST?\n\nWe would like to know what you think in the comments below.\n\nAnd don’t forget to SAVE OR SHARE IT!\n\nIsabella & Pietro\n\nTRZ TEAM\n\nA couple with a zest for all things travel, a love for motorcycles, and a voracious appetite for good food!\n\nLET'S CONNECT\n\nBROWSE OUR CATEGORIES\n\nDESTINATIONS Culture.
