Bandettini & Mark J. Lowe 09:05 1. What is the Physiological Basis of Functional Connectivity & What Can It Tell Us? Maurizio Corbetta Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA Spontaneous or intrinsic, i.e. not stimulus- or task-driven, activity in the brain is not noise, but orderly and organized at the level of large scale systems in a series of functional networks that maintain at all times a high level of coherence. Understanding this distributed spatiotemporal structure is critical for understanding neuronal communication and behavior. 09:30 2. Resting-State Signals: Identification, Classification & Relation to Brain Connectivity Stephen M. Smith Oxford University FMRIB Centre, Oxford, England, UK Cardiovascular MRI technology continues to evolve in terms of its ability to rapidly and reliably produce accurate, functional, diagnostic information, and also in its capacity to provide quantitative results. a number of centers are beginning to explore the use of MRI as a means to triage patients presenting in the emergency room with acute chest pain. This presentation will explore the latest advances in cardiovascular MRI methods that are especially applicable to the diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). 09:55 3. Resting Functional Connectivity: Potential as a Clinical Marker in Individual Patients Michael D. Greicius Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA Functional MRI currently has few clinical applications. This is due, in part, to the difficulty of using task-activation fMRI in a clinical setting. Resting-state fMRI, which allows for the detection of 15-20 large-scale brain networks, has the potential to overcome some of these clinical limitations. This talk will examine efforts to develop resting-state fMRI biomarkers for several neuropsychiatric disorders including coma, depression and chronic pain. Particular emphasis will be placed on resting-state fMRI as a potential biomarker in Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
