        "text": "Welcome to Part Three of the Quiz! Every week this summer, find new hockey trivia - and answers - here, up to three times a week. Test your self and your friends, and take credit as the King or Queen of hockey knowledge. Covering various topics (and miscellany) chapter to chapter, it’s a fun and easy way to get into the game over the hot summer months. Take a journey with your fellow Bleacher Creatures and discover the stories which make up over a hundred years of ice time.\n\nThink you can handle it? Want to prove your hockey-smarts? Grab a pen and paper, or simply type your solutions on your own Bleacher Report profile and play along. Answers for today’s questions will be listed in Monday’s edition, and links to other chapters are at the bottom of the page.\n\nThe Stanley Cup is an amazing thing. It’s had an interesting existence to say the least. There are many facets to the Cup and the championship playoffs which have decided it’s winners, and so this is just one instalment of questions about hockey’s holy grail. It’s a bit of a hodgepodge, but there will many more Cup topics and questions over the summer… so get ready to meet Stanley!\n\n1. Which player has the most Stanley Cup victories of any NHL player not to skate for the Montreal Canadiens?\n\n2. Which is the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup in Game 7 overtime? (Sudden-death deciding the winner of the Finals)\n\n3. Which player won the Conn Smythe as playoff MVP the year before he won the Calder Trophy for best rookie?\n\n4. Technically speaking, there is one person in history who won the Stanley Cup at least ten times before his tenth birthday. Who accomplished this, and how?\n\n5. Who was the first and only goaltender to win the Stanley Cup in three different decades?\n\n6. Who (which team, which player) is credited with the first Stanley Cup celebration which included the winning Captain raising the mug over his head and skating a victory lap around the rink?\n\n7. When 46-year-old defenseman Chris Chelios played his 248th playoff game in April 2008, which Hockey Hall of Fame player did he surpass to set a new NHL record (post-season appearances)?\n\n8. In 2006, the Western Conference made NHL playoff history in the first round. In what way did they break from the usual post-season mould?\n\n9. When the Colorado Avalanche won the Stanley Cup in 1996, Nordiques fans made a big deal about the club winning it’s first mug the year it moved away from Quebec. Far fewer people noticed there was something in the space between Denver and Quebec City that could be considered an omen to the win. Why?\n\n10. During the 1980 Stanley Cup Playoffs, he added to his infamous reputation by knocking out the opposition’s coach with a two-handed chop to the head with his stick. Who is the player, and which NHL head coach did he brain?\n\nBonus Question: Born in Scotland but raised in Winnipeg, this two-time Vezina Trophy-winner passed away from a brain tumour shortly after his first Stanley Cup victory, in which he was instrumental. Who was this unfortunate NHL player?\n\nPhoto Question: Bobby Orr’s OT series-sweeping shot on 10 May 1970 is probably the most famous image in Stanley Cup history. In fact, it is so enduring that is known simply as “The Goal”. Everyone recognises the Parry Sound native, but do they remember the Blues who were involved in the play? Which St. Louis goalie did #4 score on, and who tripped Orr, creating his dramatic pose?\n\nAnswers - MacHall Test Part Two: The Draft\n\n* Note: These are the solutions to the previous quiz. Try your hand at the questions here if you want to test yourself from the beginning.\n\n2.1 ~ 1963, in Montreal, where it would be held until 1985. The Queen Elizabeth Hotel (with a few other venues in between) was the home of the draft for years.\n\n2.2 ~ Three: Jari Tolsa (120th), Matt Shasby (149th), and Kent McDonell (181st). Though the drafting of Zetterberg has gone down as a brilliant fore-thinking decision, the fact that he was taken after these three others shows it was probably more of a stab in the dark. The Red Wings’ scouting staff may never have properly seen him play overseas.\n\n2.3 ~ The dissolution of the World Hockey Association (WHA). There had been a rule change for the draft process which allowed men who had already played professionally to be drafted. Before this, players had to be of amateur standing. It was beneficial to be able to draft former WHA players as well as “new recruits”.\n\n2.4 ~ He was imaginary. Expressing his dislike of endless draft rounds and pointless picks, Imlach gave a made-up name when called to make a selection in the eleventh round. Unfortunately, the press believed it was a legitimate player selection, and reported about a new young Japanese centre drafted into the NHL. The Hockey News was one of the publications which ran a story on Tsujimoto before it was revealed to be a hoax. In most NHL Draft records the selections list goes from 182 directly to 184 for 1974. I think Imlach made his point at the time.\n\n2.5 ~ He was too young. The 2003 cut-off date was only two days before the birthday that made Ovechkin eligible for draft, but that was too late. The Panthers, in a vain attempt to salvage what they knew would be a franchise-changing pick, argued that with the extra days that fall during a leap year, he was actually old enough to enter the Draft.\n\n2.6 ~ Kevin Lowe. Though he spent four seasons with the New York Rangers, Lowe is known as a lifetime Oiler. He went on to play the most games in Edmonton’s franchise history before wrapping up in 1997-98. In 1999-00 he became the team’s coach, taking over the role of GM after that season. He won six Stanley Cups as a player, five as an Oiler, one in New York.\n\n2.7 ~ Jason Smith. Two different players, both defensemen, both born in Calgary, Alberta, both born in November (a year and a few days apart). The main statistical differences: one is a left-hand shot, the other right; also, one man has played in the NHL, the other has not.\n\nJason Smith, born 2 Nov 1973 - Drafted by New Jersey 18th overall in 1992. Right handed, 6’3”-210 lbs. - also - Jason Smith, born 19 Nov 1974 - Drafted by Calgary 95thoverall in 1993. Left handed, 6’4”-215 lbs. The Jason Smith of Devils/Leafs/Oilers/Flyers fame has had a very successful NHL career, and regularly captained his team. The other Smith played for Princeton pre-draft, and then played sparingly in junior leagues before disappearing off the record book. He never played in the NHL.\n\n2.8 ~ Eleven. Of the forty-six players chosen first overall, only eleven have been from outside of Canada. Starting with Brian Lawton in 1983, and including Mike Modano, Mats Sundin, Roman Hamrlik, Bryan Berard, Patrik Stefan, Rick DiPietro, Ilya Kovalchuk, Alexander Ovechkin, Erik Johnson and Patrick Kane. Countries represented are the United States, Sweden, Czech Republic, and Russia.\n\n2.9 ~ The Flames, who had the 20th overall choice, traded with the Devils to acquire the earlier selection. The Devils would use that 20thoverall choice to pick Martin Brodeur, who has become their franchise All-Star. Felix Potvin was then taken 31stoverall by Toronto. Both had better NHL careers than poor Trevor Kidd. Incidentally, future-Flames backstop Roman Turek was also drafted later in that Draft year, 113th overall by Minnesota.Indeed one of the deepest draft years in memory, a full fourteen of the twenty- one first round picks in 1990 went on to have 500+ game careers in the League.\n\n2.10 ~ Rick DiPietro, when he was drafted by the New York Islanders in 2000. However, he was not the first goaltender drafted first into the NHL, but the first in the Entry Draft. In 1967 - the days of the Amateur Draft - Montreal native Michel Plasse was taken with the first choice of the year by the Canadiens. Plasse went on to play for St Louis, Montreal, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Colorado and Quebec. He was on the Canadiens team that won the Cup in 1973; he didn’t see ice time in the playoffs, but he had an 11-2-3 record in the regular season as Ken Dryden’s back-up.\n\n2.11 ~ (Bonus Question) Erik Johnson (2006) and Patrick Kane (2007)\n\n2.12 ~ (Photo Question) Mats Sundin. Drafted by the Nordiques, he was only the third player born outside of Canada to be selected first overall. He is best recognised as the long- time captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nCheck back Monday for more hockey trivia, as well as the answers to this edition’s Stanley Cup questions.\n\nPart One - MacHall’s Bleacher Creature Trivia: Hockey’s “Third Season” Basics\n\nPart Two - MacHall’s Bleacher Creature Trivia: The Draft\n\nPart Three - MacHall's Bleacher Creature Trivia: Stanley Cup Sampler\n\nPart Four - MacHall's Bleacher Creature Trivia: International and Olympic Hockey\n\nPart Five - MacHall's Bleacher Creature Trivia: NHL Awards and the Stanley Cup\n\nPart Six - MacHall's Bleacher Creature Trivia: Classic Hockey Hodgepodge\n\nPart Seven - MacHall's Bleacher Creature Trivia: Rules, Refs, and Regulations\n\nPart Eight - MacHall's Bleacher Creature Trivia: Great NHL/Hockey Lines and Nicknames\n\nNew trivia questions (and solutions to the previous edition) will be published Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays through the Summer.
