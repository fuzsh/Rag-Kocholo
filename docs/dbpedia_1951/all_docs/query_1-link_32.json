Indeed, this finding constituted the underpinning of the Mental Hygiene movement in the early years of this century. However, the prevailing assumption that the statistical associations reflected environmentally mediated influences has come increasingly under challenge in recent years. This derives from the evidence that part of the associations reflect children's effects on parents, rather than the other way round, and that some of the parental effects represent genetic, rather than environmental, transmission. After a brief review of the validity of these challenges, the paper will consider the evidence that there are substantial environmental influences on child/adolescent psychopathology. More detailed attention will thus be paid to the research strategies that may be employed to test hypotheses on environmentally-mediated risks from specific psychosocial circumstances. The findings from research using such strategies will be used to draw some overall conclusions on environmental effects and their implications for clinical practice. The paper will conclude with a look ahead to the challenges that remain and suggest some research steps that are needed.\n\nII13\n\nThursday, Sept 16, 1999\n\nAbstracts 11th International Congress ESCAP\n\nSTATE OF THE ART LECTURES\n\nMOTHERING\n\nIU7\n\n3\n\nIan Brockington Dept. of Psychiatry, University ofBirmingham, UK\n\nSL 01- SL 02\n\nThis lecture summarizes clinical studies of disordered mothering, conducted dunng the last 25 years. The historv goes back to the precocious insights of the medecin legiste, Tardieu, in 1860. He recognized all forms of child abuse, except Munchhausens-by-proxy. The term misopedie was coined. Apart from occasional French theses and German inaugural dissertations (eg. those of Suberg and Domer in 1936), this discovery was buried for 100 years, untiI child abuse was again forced on the medical profession by observations in pathology and paediatric radiology Parallel to the abusive theme. there was a gradual realization that some mothers hated and rejected their children. Again the word misopadie was used - by Oppenheim in 1919 EVidence for the importance of the mother-infant relationship was commg in from vanous sources - from animal experiments. psychoanalysis. the 'rooming-in movement' and ethological studies Experiments like those of Pelper (1924) and Buhler (1927) showed that the newborn infant was competent to participate in an interaction with its mother. The study of mother-infant interaction has now become sophisticated. with structured home observations and splitscreen videotapes\n\n002 - 003\n\n2\n\nMy own contribution is clinical. In 1975 I became interested in puerperal psychosis, initially as an object of nosological curiosity. I rapidly became aware that there were a large number of distinct postpartum psychiatric disorders - childbirth is the most complex of all psvchological triggers. In Manchester, we encountered a mother who rejected her infant and resisted all treatment for 3 years, until a clinical psychologist. Eileen Brierley, demonstrated the power of play therapy with participant modeling, achieving a complete cure in a few sessions. Since then I have treated at least 100 mothers with various forms and degrees of mother-infant relationship (bonding) disorders. This is one of the commonest. most severe and most treatable of puerperal mental disorders: Its diagnosis and management IS the most specific skill acquired by those practising in this area, and one of the main reasons for developing a periparturn specialism. We now recognize two vectors of bonding psychopathology The absence of maternal response. grading into hostility and rejecuon Pathological anger, grading into abuse.\n\nNEW RESULTS IN CHILD PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nFrank C. Verhulst Erasmus University Rotterdam/Academic Hospital Rotterdam\n\nIt has been nearly 40 years since the first true epidemiological study was carried out. Since then, descriptive epidemiological studies have provided a wealth of data concerning issues that are the core of child/adolescent psychiatry, including: prevalence; continuity and change; historical trends; help seeking behavior; and assessment and diagnostic issues. Also etiological epidemiological studies such as genetic epidemiological studies, high risk studies, and studies concerning the influence of environmental and biological factors have been carried out. The main results of these studies will be the subject of this presentation with examples of our own research. From these results it can be concluded that epidemiology: (1) has stimulated the development of standardized assessment instruments that are now widely used both in clinical practice and in research; (2) has provided data that serve as important parameters for policy makers to decide on priorities; (3) has elucidated the role of a number of etiological factors; (4) has provided methodologies that serve as important standards for clinical research (including intervention and prevention research) and mental health services research. A number of future developments in epidemiology will be discussed, such as the use of epidemiological results in clinical practice, genetic epidemiology, longitudinal studies, and assessment and diagnostic issues.\n\nWe have proposed a treatment approach: • Decide whether to treat or to relinquish the infant If (as usually) the mother wishes to overcome the problem, treat depression: this may be sufficient, but often not Do not separate mother & infant. but focus on the interaction If there IS a risk of abuse, never leave them alone Spare her all Irksome duties. especially dealing with a fractious Infant When both an: calm, foster the interaction. USIng various techniques. especially participant play therapy This is almost always successful. It can be conducted at home, given sufficient family support. A day hospital is an asset, and conjoint hospitalization sometimes necessary. To improve diagnosis. we have developed two schedules - the Birmingham Interview for Maternal Mental Health (which has a section devoted to the mother-infant relationship). and the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire\n\n1118\n\nEuropean Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Vo!. 8, Supp!. 2 (1999) © Steinkopff Verlag 1999\n\nPLENARY LECTURE\n\nSYMPOSIUM SYOI\n\nPL 02\n\nNEW DEVELOPMENTS IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY\n\nASPERGER SYNDROME AND RELATED DISORDERS\n\n005- 009 004\n\n5\n\n4\n\nASPERGER SYNDROME AND RELATED DISORDERS\n\nChristopher Gillberg, Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Sahlgren University Hospital, S-413 45 Goteborg, SWEDEN.\n\nPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS IN CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY: RECENT ADVANCES AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES\n\nSchizoid personality disorder in children was first described almost 75 years ago, but its present-day synonym, Asperger syndrome, has not been in widespread use until the last decade. Asperger syndrome, closely related to classic autism, also referred to as Kanner syndrome, is one of a handful of named disorders in the autism spectrum. Its prevalence appears to be several times that of Kanner syndrome, even though precise population rates are strongly influenced by the set of diagnostic criteria used. Recent studies suggest that ICD-IO and DSM-IV criteria for the disorder are problematic in many ways. The pathogenesis of Asperger syndrome has not been satisfactorily explored, but it is widely believed that genetic factors are of crucial importance in many cases. Prefrontal and right hemisphere brain dysfunctions have been implicated in neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies. The overlap of Asperger syndrome with other neuropsychiatric disorders, notably ADHD, DAMP, Tourette syndrome and OCD, is considerable. Outcome studies have been few in number and their representativeness are in doubt. Intervention strategies are beginning to be outlined, but, so far, little is known about their effectiveness.\n\nS. Kutcher Department of Psychiatry, Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, Canada\n\nThe psychopharmacologic treatment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents has seen rapid development in the last decade. In some cases, the clinical application of these treatments had outstripped the scientific literature available to confirm their efficacy, tolerablity or safety. The clinical paradigm that supports their use has also concurrently undergone rapid change progressing from a theory based and theory driven to a theory based and experimentally driven model. These changes have lead to a revolution in our understanding of the pathoetiology and treatment of the mental disorders of children and teenagers. In the new millenium, these changes will accelerate and will be further informed by advances in developmental neurobiology. Child and adolescent psychiatry will need to both embrace these new advances and at the same time maintain its caring and holistic perspectives while continually advocating for all interventions that benefit patients and their families.\n\nlU9\n\nAbstracts II th International Congress ESCAP\n\n6\n\nNew Antidepressants in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry John T.

In adults the SSRIs are effective in major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and other anxiety disorder but also provide symptomatic relief for some people with anger control problems, pain syndromes and depressive complications of other serious psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. In children much less research has been completed, but it is likely that the SSRIs will have the broad applicability that is seen in adults. In addtition, there are a number of newer antidepressants that either have no serotonergic activity or combine serotonergic/dopaminergicor serotonergic/noradrenergic activty/ This presentation will review the controlled trials of the new antidepressants that are completed and currently in progress in children and adolescents. In addition, the presentation will address how the differences among the SSRIs impact on the use of the SSRIs in children and adolescents.\n\nObjective: Atypical neurolepties (AN) are a group of chemically different compounds that are characterized by the following properties, which distinguish them from classical neurolepties: (I) a different receptor binding profile than classical neuroleptics (2) a low rate of extrapyramidal side-effects (3) efficacy also with regard to negative symptoms and (4) absence of hyperprolactinemia and a low rate of other adverse effects. This paper gives a review on the three most widely used atypical neuroleptics in child psychiatry: Clozapine,Olanzapineand Risperidone. Methods: A review of the literature was combined with the description of the results of own studies including mainly Clozapine and Olanzapine, taking into account psychopathological measures as well as blood levels. Results: AN meanwhile belong to the spectrum of psychopharmacological agents used in child and adolescent psychiatry. Their main indications are acute schizophrenic episodes and therapy-refractory schizophrenic psychoses. For other indications (e.g. affective disorders, manic states, autism, mental retardation) there is less evidence at this time. In spite of their possible adverse effects (e.g. danger of granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis with Clozapine, weight gain with Clozapine and Olanzapine) atypical neuroleptics have enriched our therapeutic options remarkably. Conclusions: Further studies in young patients are necessary in order to extend their appropriate use and possibly also enlargetheir indications.\n\n7 THE USE OF STIMULANTS ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY\n\nIN\n\nCHILD\n\n8\n\n9\n\nAND\n\nJK. Buitelaar, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands Objective: The prescription of psychostimulants is the most frequently used modality of treatment for children with attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A series of questions remain, however, concerning the prediction of medication response, the long-term effects of stimulants, and the use of stimulants for a broader range of indications, such as primary aggressive disorders, tic disorders with comorbid ADHD, pervasive developmental disorders and for a broader age range, such as in preschoolers and in adults. Method: The questions raised will be addressed using results of recently published and unpublished studies. Results: The power to predict the medication response on the basis of behavioral and clinical measures is limited (Buitelaar et aI., 1995; Denney and Rapport, 1999). Clinical efficacy and safety remain satisfactory during continuation of treatment for a period of 4 months-2 year (Gillberg et al. 1997; Schachar et al., 1997; Gadow et aI., 1999). Stimulants appear to be effective in children primarily selected because of aggressive behavior (Klein et al., 1997). The effects on aggression are more or less independent of the effects on the core symptoms of ADHD. Work by Gadow et al. (1995,1999) and Castellanos et al. (1997) shows that stimulants do not aggravate tics in most children with mild or moderate tics, when given for the treatment of comorbid ADHD. Stimulants should be used in subjects with PDD and in preschoolers only in the framework of careful clinical monitoring and following a balanced consideration of alternative treatment options.\n\nTREATMENT OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH OLANZAPINE • A REVIEW R.W. Dittmann\"', J. Czekalla', H.P. Hundemer , Psychosomatic Dep., Children's Hospital, University of Hamburg , Medical Dep., CNS Dlv., Lilly Deutschland GmbH, Saalburgstr. 153, 0.61350 Sad Homburg, Germany Olanzapine is a new antipsychotic compound with multiple receptor affinity, 0,· and 5-HT, - in particular. Efficacy and safety, e.g., a low EPS rate, had been established prior to regulatory approval (FDA, EMEA, 1996). Thus, the compound has increasingly been used for children and adolescents after market launch, although not indicated for this age group. This presentation will review the published literature on the use of olanzapine In young patients with different disorders (e.g., psychosis, autism). Available findings from recent oral and poster presentations will be discussed as well (e.g., van Engeland et al., 1998; Schulz et al., 1999). In addition, results from a comprehensive retrospective chart review (N 24; JunghanB, Dittmann, 1999) will be summarized. The design of an ongoing open multicenter trial in Germany with olanzapine in young schizophrenic pats. ~ 12 y.; N ~ 100) will also be presented. Based on the currently available evidence, the review will finally provide a summary and careful assessment of olanzapine's efficacy and safety profile In children and adolescents.\n\n=\n\nEuropean Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Vol. 8, Suppl. 2 (1999) © SteinkopffVeriag 1999\n\nIUlO\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nIS CHILD PSYCHIATRY USELESS OR WORSE?

Graham St. Alban'sRoad, LondonNW5 1RG, UiK. Child and adolescent psychiatry is now acknowledged as a medical specilaty or subspecialty in most of the European countries and in many other countries in the world. However, the role of child and adolescent psychiatrists within the network of mental health professionals is quite different. There are also discussions about the boundaries of the field of child and adolescent psychiatry and with regard to quality assurance and to effectiveness and efficiency of treatment methods used. Due to these discussions, the question about the future of child and adolescent psychiatry seems to be justified. The three papers included in this symposium will focus on different aspects of the theme and will hopefully describe ways into a good future of child psychiatry as a necessary medical discipline which has to offer effective and economical treatments and appropriate help to troubled children and families.\n\n11\n\nBackground I) Are child psychiatric treatments beneficial? Several answers are defensible. On the one hand, good clinical trials have shown that some specific treatments are effective for particular disorders. On the other hand, there is persuasive evidence that the sorts of treatments delivered in everyday practice are often ineffective. Even worse, there is convincing evidence that \"common sense\" psychological treatments can sometimes do harm 2) Does one size fit all? Some clinics stiIl provide a single type of therapy for all the children and families they see, e.g. just family therapy, just psychodynamic therapy, or just pharmacotherapy. Specialisation in medicine is fine (e.g. between oncologists, radiotherapists and surgeons) provided each patient is directed to the most appropriate treatment modality. In practice, this often fails to happen in child psychiatry, with all children in a particular area being offered a restricted choice. 3) Is help widely enough available? Many studies in Europe and North America have shown that the great majority of children with treatable child psychiatric disorders do not get referred to specialist child mental health professionals. The children who do get referred are not necessarily the most severely affected. The failure to refer treatable children reflects many factors, including a lack of awareness - among parents, teachers and many health professionals - about which problems can be helped. Child psychiatrists often do little to raise awareness and increase referrals since they are already struggling to cope with their workload. Interpretation I) It is arguably a form of child abuse to offer useless or harmful therapies when effective treatments are available - this wastes children's time and deprives them of opportunities to improve. It also wastes money that could be used more profitably. We cannot rely on our intuitions to teIl us which children we are helping since we have cognitive and emotional defences that protect us from seeing the harm we do. For the sake of the children we are supposed to serve, we have a duty to evaluate our work objectively and learn from out mistakes. 2) Our preferences for carrying out one sort of therapy or another can justifiably guide our career choice but should not alter which therapy a child is offered. 3) If we stop using ineffective or harmful therapies and spend our time delivering the most effective and cost-effective therapies, we wiIl be able to offer these therapies to a greater number of children. Ifwe can demonstrate that our service is effective and economical, then we are in a strong position to bid for extra funds to expand our service if necessary.\n\nlUll\n\nAbstracts 11th International Congress ESCAP\n\nIS THERE A FUTURE FOR CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AS A SPECIALTY?\n\n12\n\nSYMPOSIUM SY03\n\nP. Jeammet Institut Mutualiste Momsouris, Paris\n\nEVALVATING EMPIRICALLY BASED PSYCHOTHERAPY RESEARCH\n\nChild and adolescent psychiatry has founded its relatively new specificity with developmental psychology and psychopathology. The recent evolution of psychiatry through a new emphasis on the importance of genetic and biological components has changed the perspectives. The methodology of these approaches are more or less the same than for adult psychiatry. At the same time, changes in culture and social environment have shown the importance of these parameters in the expression of psychic disorders specially during adolescence with personality and conduct disorders. If we add the decreasing number of students in medicine and mainly of specialists we can consider that child and adolescent care will be practiced by psychologists, social workers and perhaps some categories teachers with the help of a few psychiatrists for assessment and drug prescriptions. This evolution can be changed if we can show the fundamental importance of the quality of interaction between the child and his environment even on the organisation of brain functioning. It means that the biological and developmental perspectives can't be splitted.\n\n014 - 020\n\n13\n\n14\n\nEvaluating empirically based psychotherapy research NEITHER GLORIOUS NOR BLEAK: THE CONTINUOUS STRUGGLE FOR IDENTITY AND THE CHALLENGE OF CHANGE J Martinius Institute for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, NujJbaumstr. 7, D-80336 Munchen Viewing the future is not looking into the crystal ball. Instead, the forces which have determined the development of our discipline and effect its present state need to be named. From there an attempt can be made to extrapolate on the lines along which future development is probable to occur. A fact of major importance is the past and lasting struggle for identity, being the result of new insights based on scientific discoveries as well as of competetive pressures of neighbouring fields. The shift towards biological thinking shall continue. Concomitantly, we shall have to increasingly share our clinical work and research with others, demanding ever new role definitions. This change is a permanent process forming a challenge to our innovative and adaptive capacities.\n\nChatoor I., Poustka F., Hibbs E., Schmeck K., Dopfner M., Breuer B., Lay B., Schmidt M.H., Blanz B.\n\nObjective: Evaluation of psychotherapy in child & adolescent psychiatry is a essential part of quality control in this field. The available data are far from being established especially in the interplay of developmental psychopathology and selective psychotherapeutic intervention. Method: Various disorders from infantile anorexia to externalizing behaviour will be considered to serve as examples for evaluation of treatment programs. Results: Various variables are essential for empirically supported interventions ranging from the therapists competence to the evaluation of specific symptoms and personal traits and to the overall setting. Discussion: Guidelines and practice parameters for treatment programs and the training in various fields as methods of evaluation, careful recognition of psychopathology and special indications of psychotherapy are inspected and will be discussed.\n\nIUI2\n\nNon-Specific Factors in Treatment Competence and Therapeutic AUiance\n\nEuropean Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Vo!' 8, Supp!. 2 (1999) © Steinkopff Verlag 1999\n\nOutcome:\n\nTreatment\n\n15\n\nCriteria for the evaluation aggressive conduct disorder\n\nof\n\ntherapeutic\n\napproaches\n\nto\n\n17\n\nK.

Method: Treatment programs for aggressive conduct disorder, outcome and criteria of evaluation of both psychopathology and other individual features\n\nObjective: This presentation will point to the significance of assessing the treatment competence of the therapist and the therapeutic alliance between the therapist and the patient in psychotherapy studies. Method: A review of the literature points out that up to 30% of variance in treatment outcome can be accounted for by the therapeutic alliance, and that differences in therapist competence can contribute to major differences in treatment outcome. This presentation will outline the methodology of videotaping the therapy sessions, measuring therapist competence and therapeutic alliance from the videotapes, and using this information for ongoing supervision of the therapist in order to control for these non-specific factors in a psychotherapeutic . treatment study of infantile anorexia.\n\nare reviewed.\n\nResults: Etiology of aggressive conduct disorder is multifactorial. Thus, the different strategies of therapeutic approaches to the treatment of severe aggressive behaviour disorders should employ more complex models. Current treatment programs show serious setbacks in not including different subtypes of aggressive behavior (i.e. impulsive-aggression vs. instrumental aggression, comorbidity of aggression). In evaluation strategies different sources of information (individual, parent, teachers, staff) have to be considered to assess both individual and interactional variables. Conclusion: Evaluation of therapeutic approaches to aggressive conduct disorder is a demanding task that is far too much neglected up to now.\n\nResults: Preliminary findings will be presented and the difficulties of measuring the nonspecific factors in treatment outcome will be discussed.\n\n18\n\n16\n\nCriteria of Evaluating the Efficacy of Psychotherapy Research in Child and Adolescent Disorders.\n\nPREDICTORS OF OUTCOME IN A MULTIMODAL TREATMENT OF HYPERKINETIC DISORDERS\n\nEuthymia D.

Method: It will provide an overview of the history and methodology for identifying and defining empirically supported interventions for children with specific mental disorders. It will examine the design issues such as sample selection, intake and outcome assessment measures and treatment implementation that may contribute to efficacious treatment outcomes. Results: The evaluation of the role of treatment outcome research can be generalized to real world interventions as well as its clinical utility. Both evaluation and the generalizability to interventions will be discussed.\n\nObjective: A multimodal training for hyperkinetic disorders was evaluated to recognize predictor variables for treatment outcome of a multimodal intervention program Method: A sample of 75 children aged 6 -10 years was treated with behavioral interventions, pharmacotherapy or a combination of both over a period up to 8 months. Results: The outcome depends on variables of the intensity of hyperkinetic symptoms, of the comorbidity at the beginning of the treatment and of family factors as maladaptive parent - child interactions as well as of variables of the treatment program.

Objective: Broadly based child psychiatric studies of unselected and consecutive patient materials are rare in comparison to the corresponding data for adult psychiatric services. Most of the child psychiatric studies refer to specific problems in rather limited materials. Methods: The county of Stockholm has operated 28 outpatient child psychiatric guidance clinics for many years. These clinics receive every year about 5-6000 new patients (020 years old). In recent years, all patients attending the clinics have been systematically assessed. Different variables are recorded, among them DSM-IV diagnoses, treatment methods and extent of treatment according to the number of sessions the patients are offered. Data from 15 000 patients is till now collected Results: We will present some examples of data from a selection of variables: diagnoses according to DSM-IV connected with different kinds of treatment and amount of treatment. ConclusiQIl~ This large sample of patients makes it possible to compare all kinds of child psychiatric outpatients in an unique way. The possibilities of the material are very great and only a few examples can be presented.\n\nF. Connan. A. Karwautz, MA. Katzman, J,L. Treasure, Institute ofPsychiatry, DeCrespigny Park, London, SE5 8AF, UK. A neurodevelopmental model for the aetiology of anorexia nervosa (AN) will be presented. By positioning stress as the central component psychological, social and biological conceptualisations of this complex disorder can be integrated. Research data from each of these domains will be presented to support our theory. For example, from a biological perspective, serotonergic dysfunction may represent a vulnerability factor for AN as aberrations of the serotonergic system in those recovered from anorexia nervosa (Kaye, 1997; Ward et al., 1998) and the association between 5HT receptor variants (Collier et aI., 1997) and the disorder are now well recognised and suggest that serotonergic dysfunction may represent a vulnerability factor for AN. In addition psychologically, AN has been associated with dismissive attachment style, childhood helplessness, and avoidant coping (Troop & Treasure, 1997a & b). Thus we can begin to develop a model in which early non-shared environmental factors interact with biological vulnerability to generate dysfunction of both biological and psychological components of the stress response. In summary, the serotonergic system dysfunction associated with AN may adversely affect the developing brain, giving rise to psychological and biological traits which create vulnerability to chronic, submissive type interpersonal stress. Such stressors typically arise around the time of puberty, coincident with an oestrogen induced enhancement of vulnerability in the neuroendocrine stress response. Thus an aberrant neuroendocrine stress response is triggered in which appetite is chronically suppressed.\n\nEuropean Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Vol. 8, Suppl. 2 (1999) © Steinkopff Verlag 1999\n\nII/14\n\nA POPULATION-BASED TWIN STUDY OF EATING DISORDERS\n\n22\n\nFormer clinic-based twin studies on anorexia nervosa (AN) have reported on significant difference in concordance rates between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, and heritability of AN has been estimated at 0.80. The aim of the present study was to replicate these findings in a population-basedtwin sample. The study was based on the young cohort of the Danish Twin Register, which comprises 20.888 twin pairs, born 1953-82. Genetic analyses followed a two-step screening procedure: 1) a screening questionnaire followed by 2) a clinical study of twin pairs with possible eating disorder (ED) in one or both twins according to the questionnaire findings. The clinical study has been performed in a 5 year birth cohort group (1968-72). 61 female-female couples were available for genetic analyses. Concordance rates were substantially lower than former findings, but still a significant difference between MZ and DZ twin pairs was found. Heritability of AN was estimated at 0.52. It is concluded,that there is a genetic factor in the aetiology of ED, but cautiousness is warranted when generalizing from clinic based studiesto the total population.\n\nObjective: Study the development of personality disorders, especially involving obsessions, compulsions, and social interactionproblems in a representative group of anorexia nervosa (AN) cases. Method: Fifty-one adolescent-onset AN cases recruited after community screening were compared with 51 comparison (COMP) cases matched for age, sex, and school regarding comorbid personality disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and autism spectrumdisorders at mean age 24 years, 10 years after reported onset. All 102 cases had originally been examined at 16 years, and followed up at 21 years. At 24 years, structured and validated psychiatric diagnostic interviews were performed by a psychiatrist blind to original diagnosis. The majority of AN cases (94%) were weight restored. Results: Personality disorders, particularly cluster C, and autism spectrum disorders were overrepresented in the AN group. A subgroup of AN cases was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive personality disorder and/or autism spectrum disorder in all three studies. This subgrouphad a very poor psychosocialoutcome. Conclusions: Persistent problems with obsessions, compulsions, and social interactioncharacterisea substantialminority of weightrestored AN cases at 10-yearfollow-up. These problems appear to be constitutional rather than a result of AN, and may warrant a differenttreatment approach.\n\n23\n\ne.\n\nIe. Gil/berg, Gil/berg, E.

Method: Fifty-one adolescent onsetAN casesrecruited aftercommuoity screening were compared with 51 age-, sex-, and school-matched comparison (CaMP) cases with regard to WAIS-R and other neuropsychological test results at ages 21 and 24 years by a psychologist/psychiatrist blindto original diagnostic group status. Fewer than 10% of the AN group were underweight at the time of the neuropsychological studies. Results: Full scale IQ (FSIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ) were similar in the AN and CaMP groups at bothages,and well within the normal range. Object Assembly results were significantly lowerin the AN group. Picture Arrangement results were significantly lower in the AN subgroup showing autism spectrum problems. Motor coordination problems were much more common in the AN group at bothages. Conclusions: In representative populations, AN is not associated with highFSIQ, VIQ or PlQ.Thepoorresult on Object Assembly could be an indication of a decreased drive forcentral coherence in AN and be linked to disturbed body image. The Picture Arrangement results support the link with autism spectrum disorders in a subgroup of AN. Persisting motor coordination problems long after weight recovery suggest a chronic biological (cerebellar?) dysfunction in AN.\n\nONSET:\n\nM Rastam, E. Wentz Nilsson, e. Gil/berg, I.C.

The small sample sizesinvolved in thesestudies havelimited the analyses to maineffects. We report datafroma largesample (Mac Arthur Longitudinal Twin Study), where we wereable to lookat gender effects and othersub-groupings. Methods: The MacArthur StoryStem Battery (MSSB) was administered to 654 children at age 5, the CBCL was completed by parents at age 5 and 7, and by teachers at age 7. Results: 1) Aggressive themes in narratives showsmallbut significant correlations with externalizing behaviors at 5 yearsas rated by father, and 7 yearsas rated by mother, father, and teacher.

Kelsay Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Basel, CH 4058 Basel, Switzerland Clinicians who treat preschool children are faced with unique challenges. Preschool children referred to child psychiatrists most frequently present with disruptive, problematic behaviors, possibly because the behavior repertoire of troubled preschoolers is limited. The etiologies behind the symptoms however, are varied, including anxiety, trauma, and relationship disturbances. To appreciate the suffering of these young children, and to plan treatment, clinicians need to gain an understanding of the inner world of these children. Children at this age, however have difficulty reporting internal states. The MacArthur Story Stem Battery (MSSB) was developed as a standardized, developmentally appropriate method using play narratives to gain access into the inner world of young children. This method involves the administration of story stems in a standardized fashion using figures and props, and the child is asked to \"show and tell me what happens next\". Content, structure, and quality of the elicited play narratives can then be analyzed with the help of standardized coding instruments. In the symposium, clinical and developmental researchers will present their methodological approaches (inclUding results addressing reliability and validity) and findings of studies conducted with several clinical and non- clinical samples.\n\nDISCRIMINANT VALIDITYOF BIZZARE NARRTIVE THEMES FOR CHILD SYMPTOMATOLOGY E.

A specifically considered problem hereby was,whether childsymptomatology would be related to specific types of narrative emotion content themes. Method: Story-stem evoked playnarratives of eacheight boysand girls, 35-69 months, were coded with the Parental Representation Scales(designed by the firstauthor)and the MacArthur Narrative Coding System. Emotional availability of the parent-child interaction dyadwas determined through free-play episodes, while behaviourproblems wereassessed through parent-CaCL. Results: A directdiscriminant function analysis was conducted usingfour representational narrative variables (mother, father, negative parental, positive parental) as predictors of memberships to positive/negative bizarre content groups. Results indicated that differentiation of negative and mother representation contributed significantly to prediction of negative atypical narrative content. As furthermore found, Emotional Availability was negatively related (r, =-.28)to totalsymptom taint, while negative representations were related to both internalizing and externalizing problems in moderate association. Conclusion: Results provide evidence for the assumption, that emotional tone of bizarre contents according to qualityof internal representation mightbe a keyfeature for prediction of conduct disorder.\n\nIU16\n\nEuropean Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Vol. 8, Suppl. 2 (1999) © Steinkopff Verlag 1999\n\nNARRATIVE THEMES, BEHAVIOR, AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN PRESCHOOLERS\n\n28\n\nK. von KJitzing, B.

Hill Child Mental Health, Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L 12 2AP, United Kingdom\n\nThe objective of the study was to examine the interrelationship between contentthemesof story stem play narratives, behavior problemsrated by their parents,and cognitivedevelopmentin a non- clinical sampleof Swiss preschoolers. Method:The Mac Arthur Story Stem battery was administered to 38 four- year- old children of a mainly middle class longitudinal sample.Cognitive development was assessed using the Kaufmann AssessmentBatteryfor Children. Parentscompleted CBCL- questionnaires. Results:The numberof Aggressive themes told by the children in the MSSB correlated significantlyin a negativedirection with the children'scognitivecapacities (r=.34*). In contrast, the number of positive/prosocial themescorrelated positivelywith the children's cognitivecapacities (r=.22), but this correlationdid not reach significance. There was no significantcorrelationbetween the numberof aggressive narrativethemes and parentalCBCLratings. In contrast, the numberof positive/prosocial themes correlated significantlynegativelywith externalizing (r=-.51**) problemsand intemalizing problems (r=-.56**) rated by the mother. These negativecorrelations were the same when they were controlled for the children'scognitivecapacities. Conclusion: Our findingsshow that there are strong connections betweenchildren's inner emotionalrepresentations (revealed by the content of their narratives)and their observablebehavior.The developingnarrativecapacityof young children, specificallythe capacityto expresspositiveemotionalthemes, seems to be a protectivefactor for psychicdevelopment.\n\nObjective: The development of the Mac Arthur Story Stem Technique has offered an opportunity to study the role of the child's representations in development. Several lines of evidence suggest that, in high risk and clinical populations, the assessment of the structure and quality of the narratives would be valuable. Method: We will describe the development of scales to assess coherence, avoidance, affect regulation, escalation of danger and aggression, overall aggression, quality of interpersonal themes, effectiveness of portrayed child actions, and representations of parental figures. We will also report on a comparison of aggressive and disruptive children referred to child mental health facilities in Liverpool and comparison children drawn from schools. Behavioural disturbance was assessed using the Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory and the CBCL. Children were assessed for verbal 10 using the Britisch Picture Vocabulary Scale, and for their ability to describe series of events using the Red Bus Story Test. Results: Inter-rater reliability from video tapes of children aged 4-9 from two UK centers and one US center was ascertained. Each tape was rated by raters from each of the UK and US centers. The intraclass correlation coefficients ranged between .65 and .85. Further directions: Comparison of the process scales and the well established content scales will be presented and the implication for our understanding of aggressive behaviourwill be reviewed.\n\n31\n\n29 THE NARRATIVES OF CHILDREN PRESENTING PSYCHOSOMATIC PROBLEMS\n\n30\n\nPLAY NARRATIVES IN A CLINICAL SETTING\n\nB.

Emde\n\nObjective:There is a lack of supportfor the notion of a psychosomatic clinical entity, with clear etiologicalevidence and factorial clusteringof symptoms. The association betweenpsychosomatic troublesand separationanxiety is further investigated in the present study in progress Method:The Child BehaviorCheck-List(CBCl) had been submitted to more than 3'000 French speaking mothersof five year old children,and factor-analysed. A sub-sampleof these SUbjects (N=40) had been previouslyobserved in the StrangeSituation (SST), when they were 21 monthsold. Thirty 4-5 years old children reachinga psychosomatic cut-off on the CBCl (15 % of the normal population), 30 childrenreferredfor psychosomaticsymptomsand 15 normal controlsmatchedfor their overall CBCl scores, are examinedthrough the Mac Arthur Story Stem battery (MSSB) and projectivetests. A specific coding procedureof the Story Stems has been developed, focusing on both the content and the intrinsic qualitiesof the narratives. Results: The analysisof the CBCl data revealed4 dimensions: externalizing and internalizing behavior problems, immaturityand psychosomatic troubles.The presenceof a separationdistress in the SST tended to predict later psychosomatic troubles on the CBCL. The analysis of the narrativedata is still in progress. Subjects with psychosomatic problemsand controls will be compared. Conclusion: Resultswill be discussed in the perspectiveof a possible specificityof the narrativesof children with psychosomatic symptoms, especiallywhen dimensionsof attachmentand of separationanxietyare considered.\n\nObjective: Gaining access to the young child's inner world is a special skill which many clinicians have worked to develop. Pla~ narratives rely on the child's developmental capacities to play and tell stories, and have proven very promising in closing the gap between clinical knowledge, and reproducible studies.We began using play narratives in a clinical sample of behaviorally disordered preschoolers in order to examine the clinical feasibility. Method: 15 children, all coming from low SES families, were recruited from two therapeutic preschools. Diagnoses vary. Minori ties (African American, Hispanics) are over-represented in the sample. Play narratives were administered to the childrenat the child's school. Results: The examiner had a relationship with some of the children prior to their involvement of the study, as she was involved in the milieu at one sight. At this sight we observed a change in the quality of the relationship, from ambivalent, superficial, or negative to positive. At the second sight the examiner was involved only in research and had only minimal exposure to children in their milieu. Most of these children also had a very positive response to the administration of the play narratives. Conclusion: We hypothesize that the experience of performing the play narrative task enables the child to feel heard in a very powerful way, and that this may facilitate the formation of a working relationship. We discuss the implications of these obsei vations and identify areas of future research.\n\nDepartment of Psychiatry, University of Colorado Health Sciene Center, Denver, CO 80262, USA\n\nAbstracts 11 th International Congress ESCAP\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nNARCISSISTIC AND DISSOCIATIVE STATES IN ADOLESCENCE\n\nSY06\n\nWI?\n\n33\n\nB.

Methods: The ..Narzil3mus-Inventar\" (Deneke & Hilgenstock, 1989), a self report questionnaire, was administered to 4 samples of adolescents, ranging in age from 14 to 19 years. A non-clinical group (n=500). clinical samples of adolescents with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (n=50), with anxiety disorders (n=50), with migraine headaches (n=50). Results: Dissociative symptoms, namely depersonalisation and derealisation. were found in a high percentage in patients with juvenile psychoses. in a low percentage in the non-clinical group. Patients of the other clinical samples show a higher degree of dissociative symptoms than the normal group. In the non-clinical sample the frequency of some narcissistic symptoms, e. g. grandiosity and narcissistic relationships, vary with age according to developmental characteristics. Psychotic patients with depersonalisation - symptoms show a lower degree of narcissistic phenomena than dissociating adolescents of the other samples. Conclusions: Narcissistic phenomena seem to be important coping strategies for stabilizing fragile self structures.\n\n032 - 038\n\n32\n\n34\n\nDEVELOPMENTAL IMPACT OF DISSOCIATIVE STATES DISSOCIAnON AND DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY OF PERSONALITY\n\nF.

Parzer, R. Brunner, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Heidelberg, D-69 I 15 Heidelberg, Germany\n\nThis symposium tries to combine various studies concerning· dissociative symptomatology and its contribution in the development of adolescent psychopathology. Pathological dissociation has been a controversial issue for more than a century. The modem theory of dissociation has gained a central role in the concept of mastering human stressors as well as stressors in the context of natural disaster. Assessment procedures have shown a strong increase in dissociative experiences in the aftermath of traumatic experiences, but the extent of the different subdimensions (amnesia, depersonalization, derealization, passive influence, identity alterations, and absorption) within the global construct of dissociation varies in relation to kind, severity and timerelatedeness of exposure to the traumatic events. But findings about the influence of kind and severity of different traumatic life experiences on the degree of dissociative symptoms remain inconsistent. Empirical data and developmental models focusing on the influence of alterations of identity and estrangement from self on identity formation of adolescents will be presented. Also data from investigations conducted in non-clinical as well as in clinical populations are presented to clarify the difference between normal and pathological forms of dissociation.\n\nObjective: Dissociation is held to be a structural change in information processing and attention due to traumatic infliction. Developmental implications of dissociative experiences on personality and self structure still await elucidation. Methods: In a clinical adolescent sample of 200 patients with various psychiatric diagnoses the Adolescent Dissociative Experiences Scale in a German version (SDE-J) was administered. Self concept was assessed in a subsarnple of 90 patients with the Frankfurt Self Concept Scale (FSKN), traumatic life events were documented by the therapists by using the trauma-checklist (TCL). Results: 17,5% of the patient sample presented with sexual abuse, 17,9% suffered from physical abuse, 33, I % reported emotional neglect by their parents and 62,2% presented with stressful life events. Dissociation scores varied within the diagnostic groups of patients showing increased scores in patients with affective disorders (lCD-10, F3) and personality disorders (lCD-10, F6). Results: Dissociation scores were significantly related to sexual abuse and emotional neglect in our sample. A negative correlation between self concepts in the FSKN and dissociation scores was documented. Conclusions: Traumatic events seem to exert their negative effects on self development by enhancing dissociative experiences.\n\n1U18\n\nEuropean Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Vol. 8, Suppl. 2 (1999) © Steinkopff Verlag 1999\n\nDissociation and Exposure to Violence in Adolescents\n\n35\n\nSchoentjes E.; Van Wetswinkel, U.; Deboutte, D..\n\nB.

Objective: To examine the prevalence of mental disorders in sexually abused children. To identify possible determinants for these disorders. Methods: 86 sexually abused children aged 3 to 17, referred to a Child- and Adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinic, were assessed using a strict diagnostic protocol, which consisted of the Child Assessment Schedule, the Child Behavior Checklist, the Child Dissociative Checklist, the Child Sexual Behavior Inventory and a structured interview concerning the antecedents of the child and information about abuse characteristics. Diagnostic classification, according to DSM IV criteria, was independently perfonned by 2 clinicians using the infonnation gathered with the diagnostic protocol. Results: The most frequent diagnoses in the examined population were : Mood Disorders (5 1%), Posttraumatic stress disorder (49%) en Conduct disorders (26%). Important co-morbidity was noted. In 10% of the sexually abused children no disorder was found. The presence of a mental disorder was not only correlated with abuse characteristics, but was also correlated with characteristics of the environment (family functioning, personality characteristics and antecedents of the mothers) and with personal characteristics of the child (age, sex. prior traumatic experiences). The literature is scarce concerning the use of semi-structured diagnostic interviews in sexually abused children. Nevertheless the prevalence of mental disorders reported in previous studies using other diagnostic strategies is very analogue to the fmdings in our study. Conclusions: The sexually abused children in our study present with a high prevalence of mental disorders. The presence of a disorder seemed to be determined by multiple factors. Not only are the abuse characteristics correlated with the presence of a mental disorder, but antecedents of the child and characteristics of his environment too, determine its presence. The high prevalence of mental disorders in sexually abused children confirm the necessity for adequate diagnostic assessment in this at-risk population.\n\nObjective: Significant prevalenceof dissociativeexperiences have been described in normal and clinical youth populations. Dissociationhas been related to Exposure to violence (ETV), as an outcome, and as a potential confounderof exposure or trauma related information. The psychometricproperties of two different dissociationscales, their application in different languages and cultural settings and their relationshipwith ETV is investigated. Methods:The American sample was drawn from the 12 year cohort of the Project on Human Developmentin Chicago Neighbourhoods. ETV was assessed through a highly structured interview. A dissociationscale was drawn from the Youth Self Report. A translation of the ETV measure and of the Adolescent Dissociative ExperienceScale (ADES) has been pilot tested in a comparable Swiss population. Results: Both general population samples show a significant prevalence of dissociativestates. The more specific ADES revealed a stronger relationshipwith ETV in girls (r=.6). Both measures and both populationsrevealed higher frequencies of dissociative experiencesin adolescentfemales. Conclusion:The results support a dimensional approach of dissociation in adolescence. Symptomor experiencefrequency seem to have a gender and culture specific normal developmental aspect, but are as well related to severity and frequency ofETV.\n\nDISSOCIATIVE EXPERIENCES IN A CLINICAL AND NON-CLINICAL GROUP OF ADOLESCENTS\n\n37\n\nMental disorders in sexually abused children.\n\n36\n\n38\n\nR. Brunner, P. Parzer, F. Resch, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, University of Heidelberg, 0-69115 Heidelberg, Germany Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the phenomenology of dissociation in a clinical and non-clinical group of adolescents. Methods: 251 adolescents II to 19 years of age consecutively admitted to the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University of Heidelberg were investigated. All adolescent patients completed a German version (SDE-J, Heidelberg Dissociation Inventory, Brunner et. al., 1999)of the Adolescent Dissociative Experiences Scale (A-DES, Armstrong et al, 1997) as part of their admission evaluation. 634 students with normal cognitive abilities from different school-level qualifications completed also this questionnaire. Results: Measures of reliability of the SDE-J in the clinical and non-clinical samples revealed good psychometric properties. In both samples no significant relationship of age, or school grades to the mean SDE-J scores could be found. Also there was no significant difference in SDE-l scores between sexes. The mean score over all patients, regardless of diagnostic category, was significantly elevated in comparison to that of nonpsychiatric sample of 634 students. Additional data analysis showed that the highest SDE-J scores were found in the group of adolescent patients with a history of child abuse and neglect, whereas the lowest scores were seen in the group of adolescents from the general population. Conclusions: In contrast to the current psychopathogenic model of dissociation which maintains that particularly severe traumatic events lead to dissociative symptomatology, moderate but chronic emotional stress may be equal or even more important in the development of dissociation.\n\nFALSE SELF AND ADOLESCENCE\n\nPSYCHOPATHOLOGY\n\nIN\n\nV. Thermos Privatepractice, Athens, Greece\n\nThe problem of false self is usually found in endowed and creative adolescents, and for some of them psychopathology is the only available way to recover. False self, as described by Winnicott, is often revised and broken down during adolescence. Emergence of more intimate feelings, reliquification of drives, and a need for personal meaning, all contribute to a loosening of defensive submissiveness and rationalization and to the appearance of the true self. This shift usually becomes an adventure. Depression, panic disorder, psychosomatic disorders, or even psychotic episodes, can be ways through which an alienated person seeks for hislher genuinity. Return of the repressed (body, emotion, desire) can be noticed in the symptoms, although they come back in intense and autonomous form, Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is essential in helping the patient discover a meaning in symptomatology and integrate neglected aspects of hislher personality in future development. Family intervention is often necessary in order to assist them facilitate the emergence of the true self. Theological issues are discussed along with psychoanalyticones,\n\nAbstracts 11th International Congress ESCAP\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nSUBSTANCE cmLDREN\n\nSY07\n\nUSE AND ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS IN\n\nSubstance abuse have been extensively described in adult and adolescent population. However, few studies are available in children. Recent data suggest early onset of substance use, and an increase risk of substance abuse and dependence in this population. Moreover, extensive concept of addictive behavior, including pathological gambling, eating disorder is now described in children. In United-States, recent studies suggest that about 5% of 8 to 10 years children have experimented substance use such as alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs. Federman et al. in a large epidemiological study, found a developmental increase of alcohol and drug use between 9 and 15 years old. Dependence and abuse seem more rare. 10 to 13 years children have been found to have substance abuse and/or dependence (Cohen et al., 1993). In another hand, researchers have focused on vulnerability factors to drug abuse and addictive behavior in children. Some psychiatric disorders have been involved in this vulnerability. In this way, childhood depression, anxiety disorders and have been described as potential factors. Links between attention deficitlhyperactivity disorder and substance abuse onset are yet more discussed. In this presentation, we will present data about developmental pathways between substance use in children and substance abuse/dependence disorders. Vulnerability factors to substance use and abuse and addictive behavior will be discussed, in the light of outcome studies.\n\nADDICTIVE STATES: RISK FACTORS AND COMORBIDITY 039 - 045\n\n41\n\n39\n\nRISK\n\nFACTORS\n\n40\n\nMP.

F. Flament CNRS UMR 7593, Paris, France The objectives of the symposium are two-fold. First, we aim to demonstrate that there are common clinical, and possibly etiological, features in various forms of addictive disorders, including the eating disorders bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. Then, among these possible common features, we examine the role of psychiatric comorbidity, notably affective and anxiety disorders, as possible risk factors for the addictive disorders. The first communication will review the frequency and severity of substance use and addictive disorders in children and adolescents world-wide. Then, the possible association between eating disorders and other addictive behaviors (alcohol dependence, licit and illicit drug dependence) will be discussed, as well as possibly COmmon theoretical models underlying the various disorders. The following two presentations will concern diagnostic comorbidity between addictive disorders and affective I anxiety disorders. The chronology of appearance of the various lifetime disorders will be examined, as well as the role of comorbidity on severity of overall psychopathology. The papers will show that affective and anxiety disorders often predate the onset of addictive disorders of various types. This might have important etiological, preventive and therapeutic implications.\n\nCHILDHOOD SEPARATION ANXIETY DISORDER IN DRUG ADDICTION AND EATING DISORDERS J2....ll.gjfu., I. Bailly-Lambin\" • Addictive Behaviours Unit, University Hospital ..\" Department of Education, Prevention, and Health Promotion, Catholic University Hospital ..Lille, France Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence rate of childhood separation anxiety disorder (SAD) and the clinical characteristics associated with childhood SAD in drug addiction and eating disorders. Methods: 127 inpatients with substance dependence, 45 with anorexia nervoso. 36 with bulimia according the DSM III-R criteria, and 110 students used as controls were studied. The current and lifetime psychiatric historieswere assessed using structured interviews (SAOS-LA, SelD), and the general psychopathological profile by means of a self-report questionnaire (SCL-90R). Results: Compared to the control group (12.7 %), the prevalence of childhood SAD was found significantly higher in patients with substance dependence (27.5 %) and higher (but not significantly) in patients with anorexia nervosa (20 %) and bulimia (19.4 %). Within the clinical population, patients with childhood SAD showed significantly more frequently comorbid anxiety disorders (adolescence SAD, panic disorder, agoraphobia) and had a general psychopathology profile significantly more severely affected, when compared to patients without childhood SAD. Conclusions: These data suggest a possible association between childhood SAD, anxiety disorders and both drug addiction and eating disorders, and show that epidemiological investigations can be helpful for planning prevention and treatment.\n\nlI120\n\nEuropean Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Vol. 8, Suppl. 2 (1999) © Steinkopff Verlag 1999\n\nDRUG ABUSE AND EATING DISORDERS IN ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS: THE IMPORTANCE OF COMORBIDITY\n\n42\n\nSEDATIVE AND HYPNOTIC DRUG USE IN CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES\n\ne.\n\ne.\n\nChambaud-Peycher, G.

Each subject and all members of his/her family (both parents and siblings in the same age range) were assessed regarding lifetime and current psychotropic drug consumption, and current (past 4 weeks) antalgic and over-the-counter drug consumption. Results: Frequency of lifetime sedative and hypnotic drug use in children and adolescents was 37% among psychiatric outpatients and 13% among pediatric outpatients (p=O.OO I); their mothers' lifetime psychotropic drug use were 60% and 50%, respectively (p=0.17), and their fathers' lifetime psychotropic drug use were 43% and 31%, (p=0.18). Using multiple logistic regression, both groups combined, the factors most strongly associated with children's sedative and hypnotic drug consumption were mothers' psychotropic drug consumption (p=0.02) and the total cumulated amount of this consumption (p=O.OI) Conclusion: The study demonstrates that sedative and hypnotic drug use in children and adolescents is strongly related to their parents, especially their mothers, own drug consumption.\n\nObjective: The study is part of a broader international project on dependenf behaviours. It aims to evaluate comorbidity in adolescent and young adults with a current diagnosis of eating disordersor drug abuse compared to a community sample. Method: Between 1995 and 1998, in the French part of Switzerland, 187 clinical subjects aged 14 to 25 were inferviewed using the MINI (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, DSM-IV) in order to confirm the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa or drug abuse, and to assess comorbidity. The control group includes 121 subjectsin the same age range. Results: Depression is observed to be very common in the three clinical groups with a percentage of 75 % of the subjects scoring positively for major depression (life-time diagnosis) ; the other psychiatric disorders such as social phobia, general anxiety and mania are less frequent but still much more important than in the community sample; there isa higher incidence of separation anxiety (past and/or present) among drug addicts than among subjects with eating disorders. Suicide attempts are also a discriminative factor, with a percentage of 35 % for drug addicts, 33 % for bulimics and 24 % for anorexic giris(the percentage is8 % in the community sample). Conclusion: Most of the disturbances, notably separation anxiety and depression, occur before or simultaneously with the dependent behaviour, which has an incidence as far as prevention is concemed.\n\n45\n\n43\n\nEATING DISORDERS AND DEPENDENCE: ASSOCIATED PATHOLOGIES?\n\n44\n\nBABIESANDSUBSTANCE ABUSING MOTHERS: DYADIC PROBLEMS IN EARLY INTERACTION\n\nV.

Burgin Abt. Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie der Universitat Basel\n\nTraumatic experiences in early childhood often have long lasting effects on the development of the representational world. Very unpleasant affects or experiences of psychic pain are hereby dissociated from the other representations. With this, the major part of the Ego remains 'free' and functional. During the process of a psychoanalytic psychotherapy this process is being reversed: the dissociated parts should be reintegrated into the rest of the personality. Such an integration may - for a limited time - hinder other egofunctions and therefore should be mentioned in advance during the interviews with parents as a possible disturbance of the therapeutic work.\n\nII122\n\nEuropean Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, VoL 8, SuppL 2 (1999) © Steinkopff Verlag 1999\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATIONAL SOCIAL WORKER IN IN-PATIENT PSYCHO-THERAPY OF TRAUMATIC TROUBLES IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY\n\n49\n\nPOST-TRAUMATIC STRESS REACTIONS IN CHILDREN OF WAR\n\nAbdelAziz Mousa Thabet, Panos Vostanis', I GCMHP _Gaza, 2 Leicester University - UK\n\nHMeng Abt. Kinder- undJugendpsychiatrie der Universitat Basel\n\nThe aims of this study were to estimate the rate of posttraumatic stress reactions in Palestinian children who experienced war traumas, and to investigate the relationship between trauma-related factors and PTSD reactions. The sample consisted of 239 children of 6 to II years of age. Measures included the Rutter A2 (parent) and B2 (teacher) scales, the Gaza Traumatic Event Checklist and the Child Post Traumatic Stress Reaction Index. 174 children (72.8%) reported PTSD reactions of at least mild intensity, while 98 (41%) reported moderate/severe PTSD reactions. Caseness on the Rutter A2 scale was detected in 64 children (26.8,%), which correlated well with detection of PTSD reactions, but not with teacher-detected caseness. The total number of experienced traumas was the best predictor of presence and severity of PTSD. Intervention programs for post-war children need to be evaluated, taking into account developmental and cultural aspects, as well as characteristics of the communities involved.\n\nSevere traumatisations of children and adolescents quite often lead to conditions where in-patient treatment becomes inevitable. In order to profit from the richness of therapeutic possibilities of a psychotherapeutic ward to full extent, therapists preferably pay attention to the intramural reality space (i. e. the reality space on a therapeutic ward except the therapeutic space in the narrower sense). It is the field, where patients often re-enact - quite often on a preverbal stage - their inner conflicts hoping to find partners in order to transform their acting-out to a more meaningful level. The intramural reality space differs to a large extent from the reality space outside the ward. For example, the patient will find a team of social educational workers ready to communicate with him in his own language of acting. In doing so, they are lead by the same psychoanalytic constructs and driven by the same goals, which are valid in the therapeutic space in the narrower sense, while the patient yet is far away even from putting his feet into a psychotherapeutic consulting room. Together with this chance goes a responsibility, which is in contradiction to many of the common values where the 'language of doing' is downgraded in regard to psychotherapy in the narrower sense. By using these systems of value without reflection, either patients and/or parents and/or the therapeutic team will obstruct the therapeutic process of various levels. On the other hand, by dealing with these aspects of inpatient psychotherapy in a sensible way, the therapeutic process will be substantially supported.\n\n50\n\n52\n\nTHE TREATMENTOF ABUSED CHILDREN Dr. Vereby.

To generate testable hypotheses to inform assessment, clinical practice and future research. Methods: A cross comparative .retrospective case note study of consecutive referrals between January 1987 and January 1997 of 450 young offenders (120 sex offenders, 100 violent girls, 100 firesetters, 80 violent offenders and 50 homicides). Data collected on 76 variables including demographics, personal and family history, offence/offending characteristics. Results: Juvenile perpetrators of homicide are a heterogeneous group. They present with high rates of generalised adjustment difficulties (contact with psychologist, separation from carers), dysfunctional upbringing (surrogate fathers, maternal psychopathology and emotional abuse) and personal disturbance (alcohol abuse, conduct disorder). Rates of previous violent offending/behaviour low. Homicide often committed alone, in a public place, against a stranger using a blunt/sharp weapon Wide age range of victims Conclusions: Need for better classification based on aetiological consideration Classification will assist clinicians prediction of risk of some offending behaviour(s), but not necessarily prediction of future violent behaviour.\n\nFORENSIC ASSESSMENT 053 - 059\n\n53\n\n55\n\nConcept of pathological delinquency in juveniles N.Vostroknutov Serbsky National Research Centre for Social and Forensic Psychiatry (Moscow, Russia)\n\nM.

In our studies delinquency is understood as repeated asocial actions of a child who is not criminally responsible for these deeds because he/she has not reached the age of responsibility or social dangerousness of the actions is not significant. In our opinion qualification of behaviour disorders in the framework of ICD-IO does not allow full qualifying of pathological delinquency. The study is to find psychopathological comorbidity of delinquency in order to differentiate treatment and rehabilitation measures. Methods. A group of 321 children and adolescents (mean age 15,1) with delinquent behaviour and signs of mental disorders and psychic development disorders was clinically examined. Results. The following types of mental disorders were found: organic emotional labile (asthenic) disorders (16,3%, r = +0,36); organic personality and behaviour disorders (14,2%, r = +0,29); affective mood disorders first diagnosed in puberty crisis (9,6%, r = +0,18); forming personality and character disorders (dissocial, emotionally unstable, dependant variants) (24,6%, r = +0,44); psychoactive substances abuse (38,6%, r = + 0,23); hyperkinetic disorders (16,8%, r = +0,23). Conclusion. Pathological delinquency evaluation based on the multiaxial diagnostics principle allows better differentiating measures in prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.\n\nIU24\n\nEuropean Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Vol. 8, Suppl. 2 (1999) © Steinkopff Verlag 1999\n\nSCREENING JUVENILE DELINQUENTS FOR PSYCHOPATHOLOGY\n\n56\n\nTh.

Lengua, G. Richardson Kolvin Unit, Newcastle General Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, England\n\nObjective: In theNetherlands thepolice/public officer is obliged to infonu the Council ofChild Protection immediately after having arrested minors who are suspected ofa major offence (20.000 new cases every year). An officer/social worker oftheCouncil examins theyoungster andhissituation and advises the Juvenile Court whether or nottoimpose a diagnostic assessment, to suspend the preventive detention, and soon. In order togetstandardised this assessment the Council recently hasrequested theresearchers to develop aninstrwnent with which arrested youths canbescreened forpsychopathology ina reliable way. Methods: New analyses were carried outonthedata ofthe 1995 prevalence study (Doreleijers) to isolate indicators forpsychopathology. A questionnaire was designed and applied in300 cases with double checks in80non-selected cases. Results: The new instrwnent detects psychopathology ina fairly reliable way in juveniles who have been arrested. Itwill beapplied innew research projects. Conclusion: As juvenile delinquents who arebrought before theJuvenile Court can beconsidered as suffering from psychopathology in 65% ofthecases, it is appropriate todetect psychopathology inthese youngsters atrisk. A reliable instrwnent was developted todetect these disorders inorder to provide the judicial authorities ofinfonuation and inorder toletprofessional assistance be organised bytheCouncil ofChild Protection.\n\nLittle is known of the psychopathology of young offenders.Recent research fmdings indicatethat this is a populationat high risk, with increasedrates of affective and psychotic disorders, substance abuse, suicidal acts, attention deficit and leaming disabilities. Levels of violence seem to be highly corelated with psychotic symptomology. In particular, the violence seen in conduct disorders and attention deficit disorders (Manuzza 1993). When these behaviours are an issue (and these are certainly common) then comorbidityof Axis I or Axis 2 diagnosisbecome more common(Brent et al 19~~ . This study aims to quantify psychiatric morbidity in a population of adolescents kept in conditions of security where one would expect high levelsof psychiatricmorbidity. Two of the largest secure units in the United Kingdom provideda sample of young people whose legal status fell broadly into four categories. The study aimed to quantify psychiatric morbidity, compare psychiatric problems within the groups, underlyingthe nature of psychiatric input necessary and discussionon serviceprovision. The study employed the child behaviour checklist (CBCL) and the youth self report form (YSR) to assist in the assessmentof children's behavioural and emotionalproblemsand competencies. The preliminarystatisticalanalysis showed elevated syndrome scales on the CBCL. The preliminary study so far shows a small sample of young people in secure care identified as suffering from both conduct type problems and thought problems.It is unclearwhy there is a differencein the perceptionof thought problems between young people and their carers, particularly since there seems to be a good correlationbetween other scales of the CBCL and YSR. The study will be extended to a wider population group to allow the comparisonwithinthe differentlegal diagnosticgroups as appliedwithin the UK.\n\n59\n\n57\n\nNeuropsychology and delinquency in Flemish adolescents.\n\nQUALITY OF CHILD FORENSIC DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT\n\nT.

University Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Middelheimhospital, Lindendreef 1, 2020 Antwerp, belgium.\n\nN Duits\n\nIntroduction: Many studies found empirical evidence of neuropsychological deficits in delinquent adolescents, mainly on verbal 10 and executive functions. ~: We investigated the occurrence of neuropsychological disorders in 66 adolescents who got in contact with juvenile court because of having committed a crime. Neuropsychological testing included the WISC-R or WAIS, Bourdon-Vos, Wisconsin card sorting test, VMI Beery, Rey complex figure, Rey 15 words and the Gibson spiral maze. A 2year follow-up of this population will be performed in next months. ~: The group as a whole had a near normal 10. Multiple offenders had significant more problems with verbal tasks. The total population had problems with attention and concentration, mainly concerning the velocity of performance. On the Wisconsin card sorting test, 1/3 of the population showed scores below average concerning the categories found. The Gibson spiral maze showed a tendency towards more impulsivity in multiple offenders. A comparison of recidivist offenders at 2-year follow-up versus non-recidivists will be presented. Conclusion: We found evidence for an information processing deficit on 1st verbal tasks and 2nd self-control skills. We think that neuropsychological assessment of adolescents who got in contact with juvenile court should be done on a regular basis.\n\n58\n\nForensic Psychiatric Service Amsterdam Objective: What is the quality of (child) forensic diagnostic assessment in Holland and can it be improved? Quality of forensic diagnostic assessments of young offenders will become an issue at stake in Holland. Forensic reports are used by several 'clients'; judge and professional people in social, mental health or correctional facilities. Forensic reports can have far reaching consequences for young offenders and their families, but economical and organisational consequences are also important. This is accentuated by reorganisations of the Dutch youth and health care systems with higher professional standards, need of treatment programs with standardisation of diagnostic assessment and need of forensic scientific research. Method: With a quality management approach an organisational and qualitative analysis of (child) forensic assessment can be made. A qualitative analysis has several issues: I: Necessity. 2: Fulfillment of need and aim of users. 3: Effectiveness. 4: Level of quality (following professional standards). 5: Efficiency. 6: User-directedness. On this basis questionnaires and interviews have been developed in this project. Results: A Dutch research design will be presented about qualitative analysis of (child) forensic diagnostic assessment.\n\nAbstracts 11th International Congress ESCAP\n\nSYMPOSIUM\n\nBIOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR\n\nUniversity ofSouthern California.

This paper outlinesrecent biological, cognitive, and temperamental findings on antisocialand aggressive behaviour in children and adolescents, emphasising the importance of prospective longitudinal research, intervention implications and interactions with psychosocial constructs. An English study showsthat lowphysiological arousal at age 15 years predictsto criminalbehaviourat age 29 years. Studiesfrom both Englandand Denmark also showthat particularlyhigharousal and classical conditionability act as biological protective factors against crime development. A prospective longitudinal study of 4,269 Danish infants showsthat birth complications combine with early maternalrejection of the childat age I year predisposes to violentcrimeat age 18 years. Findings froma prospective longitudinal study on 1,795 childrenfrom the islandof Mauritiusreplicate the arousal findings and also show that increased body size, stimulation-seeking, and fearlessness at age 3 years predisposes to aggressive behaviourat age II years in both malesand females. Life-eourse persistentantisocialsin Mauritiusare characterised by spatial abilitydeficitsat age 3 years, and both verbal and spatial abilitydeficits at age II years.\n\nBIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF AGGRESSION 060 - 064\n\n60\n\n62\n\nHPA-axis functioning during stress: A comparison of children and normal controls Herman van Engeland.

Vrye Universiteit, ValeriusPlein 18, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Interest in risk factors for impulsive behaviour and violence in children and adolescents has increased considerably in the recent past. Mechanisms by which aggressive behaviour is mediated have been sought. Biological mechanisms have been of particular interest all over the world, resulting in research in this field. Arousal and stress-regulation seem to playa role in impulsivity and aggression. These and other neurobiological findings may have considerable implications in terms of treatment. The aim of this symposion is to provide the opportunity to discuss these topics and discuss the results of recent research studies, in order to gain an improved understanding of biological aspects of impulsive and aggressive behaviour.\n\n61\n\nAdrianRaine,D.Phil, Professorin Psychology\n\nSYIO\n\nBIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF AGGRESSION\n\nIU25\n\nStress-regulating mechanisms are importantin explaining individual differences in antisocialbehavior. We wantedto find out whethera pattern ofHPA-axis underarousal is found in disruptivechildren underpsychologically challenging procedures involving provocation and frustration. In two studies, in whichthe HPA-axis activityof ODD and normalcontrolchildrenwas comparedduring nonstressful and stressful conditions, we foundthat cortisol levelsin the ODD group were generally lowerthan those of the NC group. However, in the first study we foundthat cortisol increasedue to stress was strongestin highlyexternalizing and highlyanxious subjects,whereas the largest drop in cortisolwas observedin those subjectswho were high in externalizing behaviorand low in anxiousness. In the second study we foundthat disruptiveehildrenshowed a significantly weaker HPA stress responseas measuredby saliva cortisoland that the exposureto stress enlargedthe difference in cortisollevcl betweenthe ODD and the normal controlgroup. To summarize, the results of these studieson cortisol indicatethat individuals who show persistentaggressive and antisocialbehaviorare characterised by a lower responsivity of the HPA-axis.

Yet,so far, no soundevidence of neuroanatomical correlates havebeen found for violent or psychopathic behavior. Inthis studyregional hippocampal volumes weremeasured usingmagnetic resonance imaging in 18antisocial (type 2) alcoholics withhabitually violent andantisocial behavior. In thesesubjects the degree of psychopathy was evaluated bythe Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). Seventeen lateonset(type I) non-violent alcoholics and 32 healthy subjects served as controls. Theviolent type2 alcoholics had significantly smaller volumes in the anterio-medial portion ofthe hippocampus when compared to controls andtype I alcoholics on bothsides. Strongnegative correlations were observed among violent offenders between PCL-Rscores and regional volumes in the medial and posterior hippocampi, withtheseregional deficits explaining up to 56%of the variance in the severity of psychopathy. These data suggest strictlydefined regions within the hippocampi that correlate witha degree of psychopathy in habitually violent offenders.\n\nEARLY-ONSET AND CHILDHOOD SCHIZOPHRENIA 065 - 069\n\n65\n\n64\n\nNEUROBIOLOGY OF IMPULSIVE AGGRESSION Dr. Mairead Dolan Mental Health Services ofSalford, Manchester, United Kingdom\n\nTo evaluate central5-HTfunction in relation to impulsivity, aggression andfronto-temporal function, prolactin responses to challenge withd-Fenfluramine (30mg) wereexamined in personality disordered offenders (51 psychopaths and 9 non-psychopaths) and27 healthy controls. Subjects received MRI scansto exclude gross pathology anda subgroup had frontal andtemporal volumetric analyses performed on the scandata. Compared withcontrols, impulsive/aggressive offenders were impaired onsomemeasures of frontal, but nottemporal, lobefunction. Theyalso had lower5-HTfunction, lowerprechallenge cortisol levels, andhigher testosterone than controls. Non-psychopathic offenders (lowimpulsivity) had increased 5-HTand normal frontal function. Independent inverse correlations between impulsivity and 5-HT function, andbetween impulsivity and frontal function wereobserved. Although it is difficult to separate out, in this population, correlations wereprincipally withimpulsivity ratherthanwithaggression. No relationship between neurocognitive performance, frontal or temporal volume and 5-HT was observed. Thefindings suggest that impaired 5HT function interacts withimpaired frontal lobefunction to predict impulsivity.\n\nPSYCHOPATHOLOGICAL PROFILE OF ADOLESCENT SCmZOPHRENIC INPATIENTS A.

Methods: Consecutive admissions to an adolescent psychiatric unit were assessed over a period of two years. 118 were diagnosed with schizophrenia, 40 with OCD, 53 had an affective disorder, 81 had a borderline personality disorder, 50 had an eating disorder. 85 healthy age matched adolescents from the community were used as a control group. The assessment used included: Demographics, the Suicide Potential Interview, WISC-R, Overt Aggression Scale, Beck Depression Scale and measures of Ego defenses. Results: The schizophrenic patients had relatively high levels of depression and suicidal behavior compared to the other patients and very much higher than normal controls. Conclusions: Depression and suicidality are important components of schizophrenic illness in adolescence and need to be addressed by the treatment team.\n\nAbstracts II rh International Congress ESCAP\n\nCLOZAPINE IN THE TREATMENT OF CmLDHOOD SCHIZOPHRENIA\n\n66\n\nLONG - TERM COURSE SCHIZOPHRENIA\n\nIU27\n\nOF CHILDHOOD - ONSET\n\nH Remschmidt I, M Martin I, C.

Weizman Section on Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Sackler School of Medicine, University ofTel Aviv Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of Clozapine treatment of Children with Early onset Schizophrenia Methods: Eleven prepubertal children with schizophrenia were admitted to the trial. All had failed to respond to standard neuroleptic treatment. The trial was open label and lasted 16 weeks. Assessments were with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale and the Clinical Global Impression. Results: There was a significant reduction of symptoms especially positive ones. The average optimum dose was 227 mg/day. Somnolence and drooling were the most frequent side effect. No case of agranulocytosis was noted. Conclusions: Clozapine is a relatively useful and safe medication for children with schizophrenia at least in the short term.\n\nObjective: The outcome of early onset schizophrenia seems to be poor. The paper reports on a 42-year follow-up study of a sample of 76 patients who were consecutively admitted between 1920 and 1961 with a suspected diagnosis of childhood-onset schizophrenia, Methods: The age at onset of the patients ranged from 5 to 14 years. By means of a diagnostic concensus rating the diagnosis of schizophrenia could be confirmed in only 50 % (N=38) of the total sample. Follow-up investigation involved interviewing all available patients, and if possible, their first-degree relatives and/or their doctors, Results: This report concentrates mainly on results concering the outcome of the schizophrenia subsample. The overall outcome was poor. According to the Global Assessment Scale (GAS) a fairly good outcome was found in only six patients (16 %) in contrast to those with poor (60 %) and moderate (24 %) outcome, The death rate comprising all causes of death including suicide was significantly higher in the schizophrenia subsample compared to the rest.
