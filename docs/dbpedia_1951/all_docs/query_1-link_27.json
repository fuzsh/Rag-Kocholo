(King Diamond guitarist) Andy (LaRocque) contributed three songs. So most likely there will be 12 songs on the album. However there is a slight possibility a short instrumental song might make it on the album. That is not confirmed at the moment.\"\n\n\"This time there will be no typical intro but an intro song which will be around two minutes (long) and is entitled 'The Sailor' which ends with the words 'Let The Show Begin' before kicking in with the (title track).\"\n\n\"The new songs sound very aggressive but still have a lot of theatrical elements in it,\" King said. \"Expect a lot of double kicks in the songs I wrote.\"\n\nAlso included on the album will be \"a very sad, sad song (probably entitled 'So Sad'), which has very intense guitar playing on it,\" according to the web site.\n\n\"King also said drummer Matt Thompson contributed a guitar riff on one of the songs.\n\nIn addition, on one of the songs, 'The Little Drummer Boy' theme is used. Further news is that Andy will arrive on February 27th in Dallas where he and King will start recording the songs. (King Diamond bassist) Hal Patino will arrive about three weeks later.\"\n\nIron Savior is the latest band to have been confirmed for the Blind Guardian Open Air festival, which is scheduled to take place on June 13-14 at BGS Open Air Arena in Coburg/Bamberg, Germany.\n\nThe complete list of artists currently set to appear at the event is as follows:\n\nFriday, June 13:\n\nBlind Guardian\n\nSubway To Sally\n\nGrave Digger\n\nBrainstorm\n\nIron Savior\n\nA.O.K.\n\nWhite Skull\n\nBlackened\n\nSaturday, June 14:\n\nBlind Guardian\n\nRage\n\nPrimal Fear\n\nSoilwork\n\nNapalm Death\n\nFreedom Call\n\nTankard\n\nMago De Oz\n\nStormhammer\n\nGaladriel\n\nBlind Guardian will headline the festival on both evenings with two different sets, which will be chosen by the fans via the group's official web site.\n\nFull Strike, the project by Hammerfall guitarist Stefan Elmgren, ex-Lost Horizon vocalist Niclas Jonsson, and ex-Crawley bassist Chris Savage Goldsmith, are in the final songwriting stages for their second fullength album, which are scheduled to be recorded in the spring for a late summer release through Spitfire Records.\n\nIn may, Wolf will enter the Abyss Studio in Sweden to record their third fullength album.\n\nGuitarist Michael Schenker has quit UFO again.\n\nThe official statement announcing Schenker's departure from the group reads as follows:\n\n\"Michael Schenker quits UFO. Michael gives back his 50% so they can tour (without Michael Schenker). Be aware if you buy a UFO concert ticket  it will be without Michael Schenker!\n\nDon't be fooled again.\"\n\nFurthermore, UFO bassist Pete Way has announced plans to embark on a solo tour of the U.S. with a backing band that will include former UFO guitarist Paul Chapman.\n\nConfirmed dates so far are as follows:\n\nFeb. 23 - Parma, OH @ The Revolution\n\nMar. 15 - Barrington, IL @ Penny Road Pub\n\nFlorida power metallers Kamelot have recruited former Yngwie Malmsteen keyboardist Mats Olausson to handle the keys during the group's upcoming tour in support of their current \"Epica\" release.\n\nSonata Arctica are soon to release their 3rd fullength album.\n\nThat will happen on 17th of March in Europe, and the albumcover is now official, and looks like this:\n\nTracklist so far(not in right order):\n\nCrystal Eyes has been working hard the past months to sort things out for the future, and soon their 4th fullength album is ready to hit the stores.\n\nLately they have signed a multi record deal with the Swedish record company DMP Sweden, and they have practically finished recording the new album Vengeance Descending except for a few keyboardparts, and what is remaining is now the mixing.\n\nThe eleven songs are - in alphabetical order:\n\nThe cover artwork is made by Kristian Wåhlin.\n\nTwo very prominent vocalists are making a few guest appearances on the album.\n\nThose are Gerd Salewski, who we are familiar with from his work with Chroming Rose, and the mighty Daniel Heiman from Gothenburgs premier metal act Lost Horizon.\n\nAxel Rudi Pell is currently in the process of composing songs for his new album. This is what we can read on his website:\n\n\"For the year 2003 no concerts or touring are planned. Axel is busy writing new songs, which will be recorded some time in late Summer. The next studio CD will be out not before January 2004 with a European tour following in February / March 2004 and some Summer 2004 festival appearences.\"\n\nBreaking news straight from the mastermind of Falconer, Stefan Weinerhall:\n\n\"FALCONER and vocalist Mathias Blad have parted ways!\n\nThe reason was clashes of schedules, FALCONER wanted to give the \"liveactivity\" a serious try and take all chances they could get. The schedule Mathias´ musicals have didn´t make that easy to go through with.\n\nSo the choice was to continue with him and thereby maybe not being able to tour after the next album. The second choice was to get a new singer losing a trademark of the band but being able to take the chances when they come. Cease the day, as they say.\n\nThere are no hard feelings between us, we just had different priorities. Mathias wanted to do what he had worked and strived for, for years. The rest of FALCONER wanted to take the opportunity to experience something new and different.\n\nMathias is not 100% out of the picture, but is planned to appear as backing vocalist on future recordings.\n\nThe new vocalist is called Kristoffer Göbel, also in the band DESTINY.\n\nHe is not a Mathias-wannabe but has his own style, which also gives the band a chance to evolve. Apart from that, the band has more new members!\n\nAlso new in the band are the former sessionmusicians Anders Johansson (guitar) and Peder Johansson (Bass). They have played with the band for a year now so why not take them in as real members. New album!\n\nThe new album is to be recorded in May at Los Angered studio once again. This time it will be a concept album but fear not dear fans, it will not be one of those weird hard to listen to concept albums. The music is mostly as it has been but with one lyrical story throughout the whole album. After the release of the new album FALCONER will finally do a proper tour in Europe at least. We understand that some of you think that the originality of FALCONER is gone now with Mathias out of the picture. We see it as a fresh wind with Kristoffer. They are both great singers, but different.\n\nFALCONER thank Mathias for the time in the band and wishes him the best of luck in the future with his career.\"\n\nJohn Arch, former front man of the ever-popular progressive rock band Fates Warning, has just signed a solo deal with Metal Blade Records. The solo EP will be approximately 25 minutes in length and will embrace the talents of the amazing musicians John Arch on vocals, Jim Matheos on guitar, Joey Vera on bass, and Mike Portnoy on drums. The title of the forthcoming EP is A Twist of Fate.\n\nHere is what John Arch had to say when asked about his thoughts on his latest project since his departure from Fates Warning 15 years ago.\n\n\"I think the music has a good feel to it. There are a lot of lements of the old Fates present but it doesn't sound retro 80's thanks in part to the newer recording technology but also the combined influences of Jim, Mike and Joey.\"\n\nAs for the title of the EP any Fates Warning fan will notice the irony but it is more than just a twist on words. The title also refers to genetic strands that have to do with who you become...your fate.\n\n\"The fans who take the time to read through the lyrics should find them challenging but yet brutally honest at times. The lyrics are somewhat personal but I have a feeling everyone can relate at some level. I hope fans new and old will like it. The guys are now completing the final recordings and when it is expect nothing short of sheer genius from these master musicians!\n\nNightwish are set to enter the studio in November/December to record the follow-up to last year's \"Century Child\" CD, due before the summer 2004.

According to an official press release from the band:\n\n\"The concept is following the Saga of the Nibelungs. We worked out 'The Ring Of The Nibelungs' from Germany's famous composer Richard Wagner. The record is split in four parts as there are: Rheingold, Valkyrie, Triumph-Glory-Agony and Twilight of the Gods. (These) are the four operas of the 'Ring Of The Nibelungs'. It's a very mystical story based on the old German saga of the Nibelungs. We worked also with some melody lines of the operas. The music includes all typical Grave Digger trademarks like simple and epic melody lines, aggressive vocals, guitars like chainsaws and a pounding rhythm section. You will see Dwarfs, Nymphys, Maidens, Giants, Swords, Dragons, Heroes, a golden Treasure, Liars, Murderer and of course Love, Death and Agony appear in the lyrical concept.\n\n'Rheingold' will have 10 songs and an intro. The digipack will have one more song based also on the concept story. It's not a cover version!\"\n\n\"Rheingold\" was recorded at Principal Studios near Muenster, and was produced by The Resetti Brothers and Grave Digger frontman Chris Boltendahl.\n\nSwitzerland's Gotthard have completed work on their new studio album entitled \"Human Zoo\", due on Feb. 24.\n\nThe CD, which marks the first time the group have worked without longtime collaborator, songwriter/producer Chris Von Rohr (ex-Krokus bassist), was produced by Marc Tanner (Fiona, The Calling).\n\nThe complete track listing for the album is as follows:\n\n01.

Lots of HEAVY riffs and COOL parts, the melodies and hooks are the strongest we've come up with so far in our career I believe. Lyrically it's heavier too...raw and real. And yes, there's some ultra-sick guitar shit going on too...otherwise it wouldn't be Arch Enemy, right? For us, It's a matter of picking up were we left off with \"Wages Of Sin\" and just pushing ourselves to be 100% better!!! (Not that easy, we raised the bar pretty damn high on the WOS album!). Keep an eye out for lots of studio reports, pics and demented ramblings from various band members with various degrees of cabin fever (on www.archenemy.net) ...we are about to embark on a new mission...\"\n\nThe tentative release date for the album is July 2003 through Century Media Records.\n\nGerman metallers Rage have set \"Soundchaser\" as the title for their next studio album, which they plan to record in April at VPS Studio in Hamm. \"Soundchaser\" will be mixed and mastered in May by producer Charlie Bauerfeind at Mi Sueno studio (owned by Andi Deris of Heloween) in Tenerife, Spain.

The lyrics to this song (were written by my) longtime friend Joacim Cans, the singer of Hammerfall. Check out their new pre-production of their musical called 'The Conspiracy' at Metalheartmusic.com.\n\nA lot of people emailed us and asking why 'Paradise ' didn't end up on 'Sign of Truth'. Since we only had three weeks in Germany for the recordings, (Edguy singer/producer) Tobias Sammet and we thought it's kind of complicated song to record and that s not so good if you don t have so much time in the studio, so basically the reason was time...\"\n\nU.D.O. are now in the middle of the mixing of their upcoming liveDVD, that is due for release around summertime.

It's going to be a fantastic document of some really special concerts!\"\n\n\"We've been working on (the album) for too long now!\" joked Hansen. \"We started in mid-December, but we had a number of technical problems right at the beginning that have delayed things a bit. We were first all big smiles when the two hard drives the shows were recorded on arrived a while before Christmas. It was a bit sad then that it was impossible to open anything on them! We tried all repair software known to mankind, and only sighed with relief as a computer specialist we consulted managed to fight his way through and open the files at last. We lost about three weeks because of that. We wanted to have the album out in late March, but now we've had to push the release back to late April.\"\n\n\"We recorded the shows at Barcelona and Strasbourg. We're using parts of both shows, some songs are taken from here and some from there. Actually, most of it is taken from the Barcelona show, and about three or four numbers are from Strasbourg. I must admit it is pretty laborious to mix recordings made at different venues  we had the same recording engineers and the same recording gear at both shows, but the house itself always adds to the sound. On an album, you obviously want to have the feel like this was all done on the same night, and adjusting all the bits and pieces needed for this are a pretty long road. It's fun work though, and it will definitely be worth the wait!\"\n\nPrimal Fear is told to have entered the studio for the final mix of theb upcoming DVD, \"The History of Fear\". Estimeted time for release is the end of this year.\n\nFollowing can be read on Doro's website:\n\n\"Hi Fans, as you all know DORO's DVD will soon be released.

The other musicians, Trevor O'Neal on bass and Steve Sguario on lead guitar, have already played on the debut album.\n\nThe music is crowned by the vocals of singer and band leader Dan Keying.\n\nChinchilla has just finished recordings for their fourth album \"Madtropolis\" in the House Of Music Studios, Germany.

The new material is pretty diverse but in general the songs have more POWER. Hard-hitting and straight forward, with more natural flow. So that the energy and force comes straight back to you.\"\n\nBallistic is the new band of Tom Gattis who wrote Metal history with his earlier bands Deuce, Tension and especially Wardog.\n\nTom shares some of the best musicians around him to make Ballistic a high quality band.

The BALLISTIC demo released in 2001 did very well, and since then, with two members of Jag Panzer joining the two former members of Tension, the new music will be taken up even further. The material will be as fast and un-compromisingly heavy as ever, but with such a potent line-up the musicianship will be truly amazing. I can say that right now, it sounds like a cross between old Exodus and Forbidden, with Steve Harris-like bass parts and, of course, Broderick's amazing leads. Of course all this will culminate in us getting back to Europe to play for the best metal fans in the world! Metal is life!\"\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. COLLISION COURSE\n\n2. WATCH ME DO IT\n\n3.

We are kicking around the idea of a full surround sound mix of Gettysburg on the DVD audio format as a bonus disc. We are checking on costs and all that fun stuff now to see if its possible. Ive always wanted to do this and this epic is the perfect choice for it.\n\nAnother bit of news is that Larry Tarnowski will no longer be performing in IE. He will continue his studies and we wish him all the best for his future endeavors. There will be a few different guest appearances on the record for the solos and we will be deciding on a touring replacement in the near future. Ill be making that decision after the recording and will let you know who it will be in the next few months.\n\nAlso, we will be auctioning off the IE drum kit for charity on ebay, but it will have to be after the recording due to my intense schedule.\n\nMy next post will most likely be after the recording is finished so until then take care and stay metal!\n\n/Jon\"\n\nIn the seemingly neverending story about Rob Halford's \"join-or-not-join-Priest-again\", we now learn that the ex-Judas Priest frontman has issued a statement dispelling the persistent rumors of a possible reunion with Judas Priest and placing much of the blame for the proliferation of false information about his activities on his former management company, Sanctuary Music Group.\n\nMore can be read on www.metalexpress.no.\n\nSteel Attack's new album \"Predator Of The Empire\" will be released on the 7th of april in Europe.

I do, however, love my job, and wouldn't want to complain for even a second!\"\n\nIron Maiden have yet to reveal any of the songtitles or a project album title for the forthcoming effort, the group's second since reuniting with vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith.\n\nThe European Leg of the band's \"Give Me Ed 'Til I'm Dead World Tour\" is set to kick off on May 23 in La Coruna, Spain.\n\nChris Impellitteri has made a statement on the band's official website.

On their website, we can read:\n\n\"So far, the band has already rehearsed 5 new compositions. Titles are told to be Top Secret to avoid copycats running amok. The rest of the guys in the band (and roadies) comment on a few of the new songs as different . but dont worry, its still EPIC POWER METAL. No radical changes but a few new ideas in arrangments, melodies and structures. Songs go almost all over the 6 minutes, as usual.\n\nEnrico says : If you like Domine, Manowar, Iron Maiden, Queen, Jethro Tull, Virgin Steele and Thin Lizzy you will not be disappointed. You will get a storm of the usual powerful EPIC METAL the band has become famous for. There will also be another tribute song in the style of The Ride Of The Valkyries. Well, actually 2 this time, we must keep our mouths shut for now. The band will also record 1 or 2 covers and everybody is starting to throw song titles. Main contenders are songs by Black Sabbath, MSG, Angel and Kansas.\"\n\nIn other news from the band, we learn that one of Enricos rings were stolen by a fan during the gig in Prato last October.

For this reason, we are nomore to expect anymore hand-shaking from Enrico .\n\nGermanys power metallers Brainstorm has entered the House of Music studios in Winterbach/Germany to record the follow up to their extremely successful Metus Mortis release of 2001. Scheduled for the 30th of June, Soul Temptation will be their most diverse album ever  guitarist Torsten Ihlenfeld quotes. Hard, catchy, powerful and maybe the biggest step for all of us.

Two of the bandmembers were taken to the local hospital, and two to a medical carecentre. The condition is not reported to be serious for either of them, but the immediate future is of course uncertain when it comes to liveperformances.\n\nParagon is soon about to start the recordings of their new album - \"The Legacy\" - and like the previous ones it is going to be produced by noone else than Piet Sielck of Iron Savior.

I'm nobody! They explained that this fact didn't matter, but they (the publishing company) feel that I have an interesting story to tell. I must agree on that point, and I think this will be a book that everyone can enjoy. Metal people, non-metal people, hobbits, aliens, monkeys, etc... If anything, it's just an interesting look into the roller coaster ride that is my life.\n\nTragedy, triumph, love, hate, and of course the whole, \"sex, drugs & rock n' roll\" thing. This book will have it all! It will be a TELL ALL book and I will NOT hold back on ANYTHING!

If any of you see any adverts, posters, CDs or anything that you feel is giving the impression that it is us that is being advertised for concerts, please take a photograph or a copy and send it to (our official webmaster). We will then forward it to our lawyers - an example would be them using the 'Killing Ground' red background with a black Saxon logo and Oliver Damson in very small print compared to the Saxon logo.\n\nWell that's all for now, oh I forgot - we have started writing the new album!\n\nKeep the faith,\n\n\"Biff Byford\"\n\nHeavenly's third album, scheduled for release in september on Sanctuary/Noise Records, will be mixed by Sascha Paeth (Rhapsody, Shaman, Kamelot, Luca Turilli, etc.)\n\nThe recording had begun already.

The follow-up to their current \"Elements Part 1\" CD, which has just been completed, is tentatively scheduled for release in October, but may end up getting pushed back, according to Tolkki.\n\n\"I think 'Elements Part 2' is a bit more straightforward compared 'Part 1',\" Tolkki has said. \"And there are more faster songs this time, I guess.\"\n\nWolf will enter legendary Abyss Studios with producer Peter Tägtgren(Dimmu Borgir, Pain, Hypocrisy) in June. They will make a short break in the recording for BW & BK Festival in Ohio, US. The album will be released during fall 2003 in sync with touring and a killer videoclip. It is told that the new album will be even heavier in your face Heavy Metal than the two previous. The cover artwork will again be done by Holm(Mercyful Fate, King Diamond). The only thing that is decided yet is that it should be a lot of fire included in the painting.\n\nIced Earth mastermind Jon Schaffer has posted the following update to the band's official web site, icedearth.com, regarding their new album:\n\n\"We will begin recording around the first week of April. I am very happy with the way things are going. I've never felt so good and excited about a record before, this will really be a special one.\n\nA while back I was working on a song called 'Gettysburg' and it was a nice piece of music but it really wasn't giving me what I felt I needed to tell the story of what went on there 140 years ago. It's nearly impossible in 5-6 minutes of music. So around Super Bowl weekend I scrapped the original idea and started writing what I hope will be the biggest and best epic I've ever written. It has, without a doubt, been the most challenging subject matter and emotionally taxing undertaking that I've ever tackled. It will be just about 30 minutes long and told in 3 parts, one for each day of the battle. It will be called 'Gettysburg (1863)' but will consist of 3 songs entitled 'The Devil to Pay', 'Hold at all Costs', and 'High Water Mark'. I will be hiring the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra to perform on it, as well as a few parts on a couple of other songs. I am working on string sections and the other symphony parts now and finishing up lyrics on it and on some of the other tunes.\n\nHere are some more titles, these are pretty much final. 'Declaration Day', 'When the Eagle Cries', 'The Reckoning (Don't Tread On Me)', 'Greenface', 'Red Baron/Blue Max', 'Attila', 'Waterloo', 'Valley Forge', 'A Gift or A Curse?' and 'Hollow Man'. This release will take up nearly every available minute on the CD format, because you deserve it!\"\n\nMore here: www.icedearth.com\n\nAngra, Sepultura and Talisman are the latest bands confirmed for Sweden Rock Festival.\n\nTop\n\nApril 2003\n\nDark Moor has a new singer, his name is Alfred Romero, the new line-up of the band will be completed in the next weeks.

These new songs will have many layered vocal harmonies and hooks that will be infectious! I don't want to sound like I'm boasting, but I am amazed at what I am producing with my voice. This is what I have always wanted to do, but was never given the opportunity to do. It's a lot of work and sometimes frustration, but thank God for Eggi and Norman's patience with me.

The group will issue their fourth full-length album, simply titled \"Labyrinth\", on June 30. \"Labyrinth\", which features artwork by Travis Smith (Nevermore, Opeth, Jag Panzer, etc.), was recorded by Giovanni Spinotti and William Novati at Noise Factory Studio in Milano, Italy and mastered by Jürgen Lusky at House of Audio studio in Germany. According to an official press release, the album \"offers 10 flawlessly executed new tracks of aggressively melodic metal in its purest form and should leave none of the band's loyal fans unimpressed.\" The complete track listing for \"Labyrinth\" is as follows: The Prophet, Livin' In A Maze, This World, Just Soldier [Stay Down], Neverending Rest, Terzinato, Slave To The Night, Synthetic Paradise, Hand In Hand, When I Will Fly Far.\n\nReturn To The Sabbat, the British band fronted by former Skyclad singer Martin Walkyier, are currently negotiating with promoters from Holland, Belgium, Serbia, Ireland and the U.S. in an attempt to bring their unique brand of \"blasphemous pagan metal\" mayhem to territories outside their home country.\n\nIn other news, Walkyier's brand-new side project The Clan Destined are in the process of writing \"innovative, fresh material which should be ready to demo in the very near future,\" according to Walkyier's official web site. \"The new project The Clan Destined is very much still in its embryonic stages,\" Martin told Digital Metal recently.\n\n\"So far it's myself, and Iscariah, formerly of Immortal, and Jay Graham from Skyclad want to be on board. We are looking for a guitarist, and keyboard player, as well as recruiting for guest musicians. What were trying to do right now is put a handful of good songs together. We don't actually have a definite line-up yet, were just trying to focus on writing right now. The material written so far can be described as good songs... heavy, but with some melody to it,\" he added.\n\n\"Right now its quite melodic, how heavy it would be would depend on how it's mixed. Seeing as we haven't recorded anything yet, it's hard to say. It's like with the old Skyclad songs we would write a song on an acoustic guitar but when we recorded it for an album it might be one of the heaviest songs we did. Right now it's still very early on and we are just writing some melodies riffs and lyrics.\"\n\nMascot Records signs Michael Schenker Group and the release of the new album entitled Arachnophobiac is scheduled to hit the shops in mid-June. Arachnophobiac is told to be an uncompromising, true to form, heavy metal tour de force featuring Schenkers imitable guitar signature that has made him a household name with guitarists throughout the world.\n\nSchenker is joined by an incredible line-up of musicians including powerhouse Chris Logan, drummer Jeremy Colson (Marty Friedman, Steve Vai) and legendary bassman Stu Hamm (Joe Satriani, Steve Vai). Arachnophobiac raises the bar to a new level and hits right between the eyes with a blend of classic and aggressive hard rock songs and is full of the kind of performances MSG fans have come to expect.\n\nThe first recording sessions for Elvenking's new album are completed. \"We had a wonderful experience in Germany, we worked with fantastic people and what we can hear till now sounds great! On April 27th we will hit the studios again, here in Italy for a fast session of choirs, additional vocals and strings, then we will fix things for the mixing\", the band states on their website.\n\nNews straight from the camp of Manticora:\n\n\"Hi there, we hope you all enjoyed the Easter holidays. We have spent the 5 days of rest to begin demo'ing some of the new songs. Drums have been recorded for 4 tracks, and right after our mini European tour, we will begin to add the rest of the instruments/vocals, for a demo that will provide us and the people involved around the band a guiding line for what will come, when we record our next album (hopefully later this year). 2 songtitles are ready: \"Velvet Ice\" and \"The Wild Swans At Coole\". The latter, is a poem by W.B. Yeats, that we have put music upon.\"\n\nCrystal Eyes has posted the song Highland Revenge from their forthcoming album Vengeance Descending for download on their website.

The release of this collection coincides with the release of EagleVision's DVD of \"Dio's Evil or Divine\", due May 20. The Dio Anthology, \"Stand Up and Shout\" contains over 2 1/2 hours of music with 29 songs, some live.\n\nIn a statement from their manager Jonas Hagström, we learn that swedish metallers Zonata is no more. Last week the band decided to call it a day, but they keep some doors open, because - as they say: \"someday in the future it would be cool to do one more album\", but at the moment the guys are concentrating on basic life really.\n\nThree brand new Helloween tracks  \"Just A Little Sign\", \"Never Be A Star\" and \"Do You Feel Good\"  have been posted online in streaming Real Audio at: http://www.nuclearblast.de/events/helloween/index.htm All three songs come off the group's forthcoming full-length CD, \"Rabbit Don't Come Easy\", due on May 12 through Nuclear Blast Records. A video for the track \"Just A Little Sign\" can also be viewed at http://www.nuclearblast.de/media/video/NB_1043.ram.\n\nIn a report directly from the Lost Horizon camp, we get to know that most things are alright with the guys now after the unfortunate trafficaccident some weeks ago on their way to a gig in the northern part of Sweden. Drummer Christian Nyquist will be trying to play live for the first time since the happening on the 13th of April in Sandviken, Sweden.\n\nHis own words about this fact: \"Damn, how awesome it feels to play again... !!! Weeks of held back Metal is pouring through my veins and are just waiting to explode in a maxed out consert or two!\"\n\nHis shoulder that were injured during the incident is now as it seems fully recovered, but as a backup Mats Karlsson, that has been a temporary replacement during the recent Spain-tour and some Swedengigs, will be there if Nyquist's shoulder or neck will start protest during a running concert. Karlsson is reported to have performed an outstanding job on the Spaintour, where he had only 4 days to learn the songs before the tour began.\n\nNo member or tourcrew are reported to suffer from any consistant condition after the accident, except for some amount of muscleache that will last for some time ahead, and an amputated toe.\n\nVeteran German hard rockers The Scorpions are taking a little break before entering the studio to record their new studio album, tentatively due in early 2004. Several producer names have been mentioned as possible collaborators on the group's next effort, including Bob Rock (Metallica, The Cult), Rick Parashar (Pearl Jam, Nickelback, Blind Melon) and former hard rock singer Max Martin (Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Pain, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard).\n\n\"We've converted the back lounge of a bus into a studio so we can get some ideas and record a little bit,\" guitarist Mathias Jabs told Toronto's Now earlier this year. He didn't reveal anything else about the record except that it'll be classic rock, even if it might be hard to get radio play for it.\n\n\"We are classic rock, and most radio stations don't play that. But a lot of things are changing, so you never know.\"\n\nVocalist and mastermind Dan Swanö has announced that he will revive the legendary death metal act Edge Of Sanity, and he has further revealed that he will be collaborating with Black Mark to release the album Crimson II.\n\nGamma Ray have pushed back the release date of their double live album, \"Skeletons In the Closet\", from the end of May to August 25.\n\nThe mixing of the album is not yet complete owing to the late delivery of the unmixed audio masters from the mobile studio in Spain. The initial problems occurred during the live recording process at which, it was later discovered, the two recording machines were not linked for a large part of the show and therefore not synchronized. As well as this some of the audio files were \"lost\".\n\nSubsequently, it has taken two engineers a long time to recall the \"lost\" files and re-align the machines so the recording machines were running in tandem and an unmixed master could be produced. Until this laborious process was complete the mixing of the album could not commence.\n\nRather than \"rush\" the mixing and deliver what the band would consider to be a sub-standard album to the fans, the decision has been made to move the release date back to allow more mixing time and so compensate for the severe technical difficulties suffered initially.\n\nGamma Ray would like to apologize to their fans for the delay in the release of the album and ask for their patience and hope they can appreciate that these technical problems were not of their making.\n\nAxel Rudi Pell will appear live at the classic metal night at the Zeche Bochum, Germany on April 29th with an orchestra. But note, that this is not as show by the complete Axel Rudi Pell band. Axel alone will appear on stage for 4-5 songs as special guest at this event. German rock shouter Doro and some more special guests also will perform on some songs at this event.\n\nKing Diamond guitarist Andy LaRocque has just returned home to Sweden after completing recording his tracks for the group's new album, titled \"The Puppet Master\". The CD, which is tentatively scheduled for release in late October, will include a bonus DVD or CDR of King Diamond telling the story of \"The Puppet Master\".\n\nAs King describes it, this album is going to make the hairs stand up on the back of listeners neck. \"The rules of censorship are being thrown out the window...this is going to be the rawest story/album we have ever done.\" King was also quick to point out that \"if you are into horror, you're definitely going to get it with this album!\"\n\nFinland's Nightwish will enter the studio on October 27 to begin recording the follow-up to last year's \"Century Child\". The band will once again use their own studio in Kitee to record the drums, bass and keyboards/synths, while the vocals and guitars will be recorded at Helsinki's Finnvox facility.\n\nNightwish hope to complete the recordings by the end of March 2004 and issue the as-yet-untitled effort in early June.\n\n\"I am definitely feeling some pressure with regards to the songwriting for the new album, I won't even try to deny that,\" said Nightwish keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen. \"But I have already written one very good track, so I'm not worried. I've gotta say that I have to write a bit faster in the coming months if I'm going to write everything before the studio sessions.\"\n\nWith regards to the musical direction of the upcoming effort, Holopainen said, \"I can no longer go to our web site to check the discussion forums anymore. It's pretty confusing reading everyone's opinions on what the new album should sound like. I think I've already heard about a hundred different opinions on the subject, from 'They should sound like the first album' to 'They should only have ballads,\" laughed Tuomas.\n\nGerman power metallers Metalium have commenced the songwriting process for the follow-up to last year's \"Hero-Nation Chapter III\", tentatively due in late 2003 through Massacre Records. \"The boys gathered in the past weeks to listen to the songs (as you should know meanwhile al musicians in Metalium are writing music...) and arranging as well as pre-produce the stuff,\" according to the band's official newsletter. \"Next week they will finally start with Mr. Ehre on drums for the real take of '...  Chapter Four'. As birdies told... the ones who heard some of the demo stuff confirmed: 'the stuff is f.....g heavy'\" and a bit 'more driving' than 'Hero-Nation'. But don't worry, the Metalium-typicals are always present as usual.\"\n\nIn related news, Metalium bassist Lars Ratz was recently asked by ex-Uriah Heep keyboardist Ken Hensley to appear on his upcoming CD, due later in the year. \"As a huge Uriah Heep fan, Lars agreed, of course, and feels very honored to be part of the Ken Hensley solo CD this way,\" states the newsletter.\n\nHalford have officially parted ways with bassist Ray Riendeau and have replaced him with former Lizzy Borden four-stringer Mike Davis.\n\nDavis was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and had reportedly played in Ozzy Osbourne's band for a week until he \"got booted due to politics and other miscellaneous issues.\" Mike had also spent time playing with Dogma, the former band of ex-Ozzy guitarist Joe Holmes.\n\nFormer Europe guitarist Kee Marcello has completed work on a new solo studio album, \"Melon Demon Drive\", due later in the year. In addition to Marcello, the album features contributions from drummer Snowy Shaw (King Diamond, Dream Evil, Memento Mori) and bassist Klatuu.\n\nU.D.O.'s forthcoming DVD will come in a special package containing a bonus live CD.\n\n\"When the 'Live From Russia' [live album] was released, a lot of people were asking for the Accept classics on it, but our concept for that album was to record only U.D.O. classics, and those songs that Accept never released live,\" the band said in a statement posted on their official web site. \"But those people will be satisfied very soon...\".\n\nThe DVD is due for release in August.\n\nIn other news, and as previously reported, U.D.O.'s new studio album is tentatively set for an October/November release and will be supported by a world tour, which will kick off in South America and the U.S. A European tour will begin in January 2004.\n\nU.D.O.  who are fronted by former Accept singer Udo Dirkschneider  will appear at this summer's Bang Your Head (Germany) and Gods Of Metal (Italy) festivals.\n\nNews from the Nocturnal Rites camp:\n\n\"Hi y'all, as far as we know our touring duties are wrapped up for this record. There might be a few shows this summer, but that's it. Right now we're focusing 100% on writing new songs. We'll try and record as soon as we feel we have an even better album than last time...and hopefully, with our musical masterminds, that won't take too long.\"\n\nPower Quest have signed a two album deal with UK based recordlabel Now and Then Records, and the recordings for their album will begin on June 11th at Thin Ice studios and will be released through Now and Then/Frontiers.\n\nMorifade will begin mixing their third album, \"Domination\", on April 14 for an early summer release through Hammerheart Records. The follow-up to last year's \"Imaginarium\" was recorded at Los Angered studios in Gothenburg and Monogram studios in Stockholm.\n\nBonfire are busy writing and recording songs for their next studio album, tentatively due in August. A world tour in support of the as-yet-untitled follow-up to 2001's \"Strike X\" will begin in October.\n\nTop\n\nMay 2003\n\nGerman melodic metallers Edguy have set \"Mysteria\" as the working title for their next studio album, tentatively due in early 2004 through AFM Records. \"We'll have some great surprises for you, so stay tuned,\" Edguy frontman Tobias Sammet wrote on the band's official web site regarding the new material. \"Musically it's gonna sound like Edguy (what else?!), epic, heavy, melodic... But there will be some little new elements, For example, one of the new elements is gonna have 70 heads and is called the 'Babelsberger Filmorchestera'. This is Germany's biggest movie-score orchestra, a real symphonic orchestra which is plays soundtracks for movies, but which has already worked with some bands, e.g. The Scorpions... It was a dream of mine to work with a real orchestra instead of keyboards all the time. But don't be afraid, we're not gonna do a boring or even -worst case- 'mature' classic-meets-rock album as some may be afraid of. It's gonna be heavy and it's gonna be just supported by the orchestra. No Vivaldi ballerina shit for men in pink tights, but an epic piece of 'Braveheart' metal... :) Sounds pathetic, but that's exactly the way I should describe it.\" Edguy, whose last CD, \"Mandrake\", was released in 2001, will issue their first-ever double live album, \"Burning Down The Opera\", on June 2 through AFM Records.\n\n\"We can't wait to hear [the fans'] opinions about it and especially the reactions of [their] performance on the album,\" Sammet wrote. \"Be sure that the whole thing is more than just an alibi-live-disc-in-between. Imagine the raw, energetic kick-ass live versions of our studio albums and you may know what to expect from the stuff. Plus we have included a picture booklet with all the lyrics and more than 150 pictures from the tour. You'll see more than some of us dudes would probably want you to :) Lately many people kept asking why we don't play more live shows to support 'Burning Down The Opera', or maybe even a tour. We can't tell you how much we miss touring. We have even started chewing off our toe-nails because of the boredom! The band is in a great shape right now and there is a great spirit and mood in the rehearsing room amongst us. And I think this will get us even more hungry for our next 'real' tour. And besides this, I think we have a good reason not to tour these days: We are right now writing and arranging material for the next studio album, probably being released early 2004.\"\n\nIn other news, Sammet has been tapped to sing on the forthcoming album from Aina, the new project spearheaded by acclaimed German producer Sascha Paeth (Kamelot, Angra, Rhapsody). Sammet will reportedly appear on at least one song  an as-yet-undisclosed track that was previously meant to include the vocals of former Helloween and current Supared frontman Michael Kiske.\n\nThe Aina debut, which is said to have \"nothing to do with heavy metal,\" is expected to surface in late 2003 through an as-yet-undetermined label.\n\nRob Rock, former Impellitteri frontman, has pushed back the projected release date for his second solo album, \"Eyes Of Eternity\", to June 23 through Germany's Massacre Records.

We will miss Joe and we did some great songs/CDs together, but the band, management, label and I were quite aware, and in agreement, that this change had to happen. New guy is Dave Padden from Vancouver. Killer voice. Basically, a guy of extremes: super clean voice and super raunchy/dirty voice. A lot of attitude. What 'til' ya see him live this summer!\n\nAn added bonus is that he brings the average age of the band DOWN! Hehe! I think he is 26! New CD will kill. Hey, weren't you guys and gals expecting a change soon??? It seems to be in the blood.\"\n\nAnnihilator recently issued a double live CD, titled \"Double Live Annihilation\", through Germany's AFM Records. A new studio album is tentatively set to surface in September.\n\nAccording to Newsweek, the american military have found a way to make iraqi prisoners of war to talk. They are using hardrock as a way of torture.\n\nThe method is told to be very effective. Most iraqians have never heard Heavy Metal, and when they are exposed to long and intensive sessions of loud, pounding metal, almost everyone starts to cooperate.\n\n\"They can't take it. After 24 hours the brain and the bodyfunctions have decreased so much that their ability to resist is knocked out. Than we step in and talk to them\", says sergeant Mark Hadsell to Newsweek.\n\nEven childrens songs on a high volume suits perfect as brainwash, which is something Mark Hadsell have experianced himself.\n\nDuring his education he was forced to stand for 45 minutes, and listen to the purple dinosaur Barney singing the song \"I love you\".\n\n- \"That is something I never want to go through again\", says sergeant Mark Hadsell.\n\nDio have finalized the track listing for their upcoming first-ever live DVD, \"Evil Or Divine\", due on July 1 through Eagle Vision (a division of Eagle Rock Entertainment). \"Evil Or Divine\", which was recorded on Dec. 13, 2002 at Roseland Ballroom in New York City and was directed by Ken Botelho for Century Productions, not only includes the full, unedited concert from that evening, but also contains an extensive interview with Ronnie, backstage scenes and the video for \"Push\", featuring Tenacious D.\n\nThe complete track listing for \"Evil Or Divine\" is as follows:\n\n01.
