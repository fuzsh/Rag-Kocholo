I N 1915 a Geographical Section was fonned in the Naval rnteUi- genctf Dm&ion of the Admiralty to write GeograpliicaJ HandbcKiks on various parts of the world. 'Hie pitrpose of thes^ handbooks was to supply, by scientific research and skilled arnuigement, material for the discussion of naval, military, and political problems, as distinct from the examination of the problems themselves. Many distinguished collaborators assisted in their production, and by the end of 1918 upwards of fifty volumes had been pruduced in Hand¬ book and Manual form, as well as nuinQmu.s shurt-term gtograpbicaj reports. The demand for these books increased rapidly w'ith each new issue, and they acquired a high reputation for accuracy and impartiality. They are now to be found in Service Establishments and Embassies throughout the world, and in the early years after the last war j League of Nations. 'rhe old Handbooks have been extensively used in the present war, and experience has disclosed both their value and their limitations! On the one hand they have proved, beyond all question, how greatly die work of the fighting services and of Government Departments is facilitated if countries of strategic or political importance are covered by handbooks which deal, in a convenient and easily digested form, with their geography, ethnology, administration, and resources. On the other ^liand, it has become apparent that something mure is needed to‘meet present-day requirements, ‘Lhe old series does not wver many of the countries closely affected by the present war (e.g. Germany, France, Poland, Spain, Portugal, ti> name only a few); its books are somewhat uneven in quality, and they are inadequately equipped with maps, diagrams, and photographic illustrations. The present series of Handbooks, while owing its inspiration largely to the former series, is in no sense an attempt to revise or re-edit that scries. It is an entirely new set of books, produced in the Naii'al Intelligence Division by trained geographers drawn largely ^m the t niversities, and working at sub^centres established at Oxford and Cambridge. The books follow, in general, a uniform scheme, though minor modifications ivill be found in particular ca^; and they are illustrated by numerous maps and photographs. The purpose of the books is primarily na\\^. They arc designed t to provide, for the use of Commanding Officers, information in a I iv PREFACE coniprchcoAive and convenient fyin about countries which they may be called upon to visit, not only in warT>ut in peace-time; secondly* to maintain the high standard of education in tife Navy and, by supplying officers with material for lectures to naval personnel ashore and afloat, to ensure for all ranks that visits to a new country shall be both interesting and profitable. ITicir contents are, however^ by no means confined to matters of purely naval interest. For many purposes (e.g. history* administra- tion, r^KOurces, communioadons, etc.) countries must necessarilv be treated as a whole, and no attempt is made to limit their treatment exclusively to coastal srones. It h hoped thertfone that the Army, the Royal Air Force and other Govemment Departments (many of whom have given great assistance in the production of the series) wiD find these Handbooks even more valu^le than their predecessors proved to be both during and after the last war, J- H. GODFREY, Dtr^or ef Naval Intel[isen£* 1943 The foregoing preface has appeared from the beginning of this series of Geographical Handbooks. It describes so effectively their urigin and purpose that I liave decided to retain it in its original form. This volume has been prepared for the Nav'al iDteUigence Divigion at the Cambridge subH:entiit (General Editor* Dr. H. C. Darby). It has been largely written by Mr. S. H. Beaver with contribution? by Profcaasor A A. Aliller, Mr. F. J. Monkhotise* Mr. P. Driscoll* Dr. P. W. Richards, Mr. J, C. Stuttard, Mr, T.

Introduction a Nethcriajids-India, the NetherlaDda Indies and the Dutch East Indies are names altematwely applied to the Dutch possessions in the Malay Archipelago, which die Dutdi caJi Nederhndsch OosuIndiC. The whole Malay Archipelago, varioiuily knomi as JVIakyEia, the East IndieSp Indonesia, etc, is the congeries of islands—numbering over 2,000—which lie between south-eastern Asia and northern Australia. Some part$ of the area belong to other powers, e.g- north- ivest Borneo and eastern New Guinea are parts of the British Empire, the Phihppinea belong to U.S.A.p and Portugal possessi^s the eastern half of Timor. Dutch territory extends from 95 E, at the north¬ western comer of Sumatra, to 141** £ on the frontier of British New Guinea, a greater Jongittidinai extent than that of the continent of Europe, representing a distance of some jpOOO km., and from latitude 6 ° N at We island^ north of Sumatra, to ii® S at Hoti island, south-west of Timor, a latitudinal distance of almost a.ooo im., roughly equiva¬ lent to that from Edinbujgh to Aladrid. (Fig. i)+ Considerably more land lies to the south than to the north of the equator, which passes through the middle of Siunatra and Boroeo, through the northern peninsub of Celebes and just north of the 'Bird’s Head’ peninsula of New Guinea.

Sumatra how^ever lias a fringe of islands—the MentawTii islands and others—separated from the mainland by a deep trough; beyond the islands the Indian Ocean floor deflcends quickly to abyssal depths of more than 5>noo m.

(2) Nortliem Australia and New Guinea rise from another platform, the Salioel Shelf, which is submerged beneath the shallow .Arafocra Sea. The nortb-westem peninsula of New Guinea projects like a ¥ptar-head from the main platform. Knowm as the Vogelkop (Bird^s Head), h has a number of adjacent islands, such as Mistidl, Waigeo and Japen. Further south, on the edge of the shelf, us the low-lying Aroe group. dTie ocean floor, whieh is generally less than 100 m. (50 fm,) below sea level on the shelf, drops suddenly io considerable depths beyond the edge, in the Timor Bea and between the Aroe if^bnds and the Tanimbar and Kai groups* and also to the Pacific Ocean north of New Guinea, (3) Between these tw^o relatively stable areas, wilii their shallow seas, lies a large tmstable area in which land and sea alternate sharply, and the ocean bed descends to abyssal depths. The islands within this area fall into several groups or lines. (a) The Kleine (Lesser) Soenda islands are a continuation of the arc formed by Sumatra and Java. The axis of Jara is continued ejistw^ards through Bah, Lombok^ Soembawa, Flores and smaller islands to Alor and Wetar; a subsidiary arc, possibly a continuation of the Sumatran fringe and the favanese submarine ridge, comprises THE INTiONESIAN AJUZHlPELAGO 7 Soemba, Sawoe, Rod and Timor, st^arated from the main island by the Sa%?oe Sea* * (6} These lined of islands are condniied in boldly curving arcs, the Outer Banda arc stretchmg from Timc?r through Babar, the Tanimbar anti liai groups to Ceram and Boeroe. and the Inner Banda arc, compriding a number of much smaller islands which continue the Bali-Wetar line throuj^ Romang, Damar, Nila and Manoek to the Banda group. Between the two area at toir point of greatest curvature in the east the ocean floor deacends in the Weber Deep to the greatest depth known in the East Indian region, over 7,000 m. (3,800 hn.) Within the curve of the inner arc lies the Banda Sea, also of great depth. (c) Separated from Borneo by the deep trough of Makassar strait, and from the Leaser Soenda islands by the still deeper Flores Sea, is the large and irregularly shaped island of Celebes, consisting of four peninsulas, each of which is prolonged by groups of small islands. The north-eastern or Manado peninsula is connected by a submarine ridge, on which stand the Sangihe islands and others, with Mindanao in the Philippine group. (d) Eastward of northern Celebes is another island of cunousty similar shape though smaller dtraciisions. This is Halmahera, which also has numerous outlying islands, the largest of which, are Morotai in the north and Obi in the south. The Halmahera group is surrounded by deep water on almost alt sides—the Pacific Ocean to the north-east, the Molucca Passage to tlic west, the Ceram Sea to the south. There are also deep troughs on the south-east, but the continuity of the deep ocean floor is considerahly interrupted on this side by submarine ridges and groups of islands which act as stepping stones to the * Bird’s Head' of New Guinea, Gestbal Sketch of Geological Background The eicistence of an unstable area between the ancient and relatively stable regions of south-eastern Asia and northern Australia, has been a feature of the earth’s crust for several hundred million years. The oldest rocks found in the East Indies are of Palaeozoic age, and the history of the area since Devonian times is a record of alternate sub¬ mergence and emergence, with folding and fracturing, in x’arious regions and at viriotia periods (Fig- S) - ^rustal disturbances have been more or [ess continuous in one part of the region or another, though four periods of more intense uplift and crumpling can be distin¬ guished—the Carbo-Permian, roughly contemporaneous with the S CEOLOCT AND PHYSICAL FEATUK^ ' HercyniAD' or ' AJtaid ' foldiDg if Eumaia, the late Triassic, the end of the Cretaceous and the middle TertLIry, The last two correspond to the prolonged epoch of mountain-building which in other parts of the world produced 'the Alps, Himalayas, Rockica and Andes. WTietcas however the CretacecKTertiary earthstorm in Europe and Asia has died down after producing lofty ranges of mountains, in the Indies the process qf mppntain-building has not advanced so for, and is'still in progress, as is evidenced by the frequency of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, and by the uplifting of recently- formed coral reefs. Palaeozmc. The late Palaecwoic rocks comprise sedimentary rocks— sandstones, shales and limestones; volcanic rocks—lavas and tuffs (solidified fragments and ashes) poured out during the eruptions which accompanied mountain-building; and metamorpbic rofd»_ slates and crystallme schistBr—formed from the other rocks by great heat and pressure during subsequent folding movements. These old rocks are found in the mountains of western Sumatra and of western and central Borneo, in parts of the mountainous areas of Celebes anH New Guinea, and in the isLmda of the Timor—Ceram, or Outer Banda, art. Earth movements towards the end of the Palaeozoic era raised the New Guinca-Norlhem Australia area above the sea and initiated a great crustal sag or ‘geosyncline’ in the region now occupied by the Thnor-Ceram-Celcbes island arc and its neighbouring seas. Mean¬ while the western part of the area-^Malaya, the Riouw islands, and western Borneo, were the scene of considerably outpourings of volcanic material, which ended in late Triassic times with earth movements which upheaved this region into a mountamous and stable block which has probably never since sunk beneath sea leveL Granite Utholiths njse up in the core of the mountains, cooling and ciystallizing slowly, and in the fissures and cracks then produced were deposited the metallic minerals—especially tin—which are so valuabli!! tci^day.

The enormous thicknesses of comparatively soft sediments which had accumulaied in the geosyncline between the stable blocks of Asia and Australia during die Mesozoic era were more easily crumpled and thrust by the compressional forces than tlie hard and ancient rocks of the latter areas, and in consequence when the earth-storm began, in the late Cretaceous period, about sixty million years ago, incipient mountain ranges began to appear in the belt extending from Sumatra through Java and the Suenda Islands to Ceram and Celebes. There were strong foldbg and thrusting movements, and Ln Sumatra granites und other intrusive rocks were formed deep dow n beneath the surface, in the core of the folds. The intense heat and pressure converted many of the sedimentary' rocks into slates and schistSp which subsequent erosion and uplift has exposed at tlie surface. Taiiary'. A very' large part of the East Indian rEgion must have been converted into land by these movements, but by the beginning of the 1 ciliary era much of this land had been worn down again^ and shallow^ seas were formed, which gradually extended in area until by the middle of tlie Tertiary—a period probably equivalent to the Miocene in Europe—the greater part of the area w'as under water, except for Sewmda-Land (Malaya, the ''tbi'islandssouth-eastern Sumatra, western and central Borneo) and northern Austraha. In the western the area, considerable sagging took place around the edges of Soenda-land^in eastern Sumatra^ northern Java and eastern Borneo. Great thicknesses of sediments accumulated^ amounting lo between 4 ,di>p m. and 9,000 m. in eastern LSumatra_ but the rate of deposition kept pace with the sagging of the geo- syncltne^ and so the nature of the deposits remained characteristic of shallow ™ter conditions. Sands and days predominate, and the large quantities of plant debris which accumulated have led to the richness of th^ areas in lignite and petroleum. Siimbr conditions occurred on the borders of Sahod-land, and thick scries of oil-beaiinE sediments accumulated in the ^Bird^s Head^ and other areas of New GENERA SKETCH OF GEOLOGICAL EACKGROLTND H Guinea. In the intervening area^ opJL sea prevailed and the deposits were for the most part limestones. Volcanic eruptions were frequent, botli on land and under the sea, as the earth-storm worked up towards a new^ climax in the middle of the Miocene pmod. This mid'Miocene folding mainly affected a belt estending from Nias through Java and the Soenda islands to Ceram, and eastern Celebes, and wus especially intense in th.^ outermost parts of this belt, i.e. the Mcntawai islands, Timor and the arc stretcfiing thence through Ceram to eastern Celebes. The weathering of the newdy- formed mountains was rapid, however, and the bte Tertiary (\"Neogene’) aeas tnmsgrusacd once more on to southern Java and the Soenda islands, and on Eo the wcalcni fringe of Sumatra and its adjacent islands. ^rhe Tertiary ere came to a close with renewed folding of a non- intensivc character. The chief areas affected were quite naturally the Neogene geosynclinals previously referred to, where the gentle folding into anticlines and synclines produced the necessary physical condibons for the concentration of the petroleum deposits. At the same time the already existing mountain axes of Sumetra and Java: were further elevated, and this phenomenon was accompanied by the rise to the surface of magma (rock-liquid} which in some arcas^ e.g., southern Sumatra, appears as granite hatholiths, and m most parts initiated a new period of intense volcanic activity ^ Thus by the end of tlic Tertiary era the main outlines of the East Indian Archipelago were formed, and in fact land occupied a greater area than at present, since the low plains of Soenda-Iand and Sahocl- land were atiJi above sea level. Pieislocefte. Hie Pleistocene history of the region has two aspects. In the tectonic field, the chief events were faulting and subsidence rather than folding. In brief, the outer arc of islands (especially Timor-Ceram) would appear to have been considerably uplifted, as is indeed shown in Timor by the existence of coral reefs at elevations up to 1,300 m. (4,265 fL) above the present sea level, whilst the areas behind subsided to form the present deep-sea basins. The fracturing in the volcanic regions of Java and Sumatra increased the outpouring of volcanic debris, and helped further to build up the gr^t cones which still exist to-day. The other aspect concems the effects of the Great Ice Age, This scarcely affected the East Indies directly, for only the central mountain range of New Guinea (sometimes called the Snow Moun¬ tains) stood high enough to allow of the accumulation of snow and GEOLOGY AND .PHYSICAL FEATUKE5 ioe. Indirectly however it esenSsed a /nost iiuportmit influence^ by reason of the considerable BuclLmdona in sea Icvd to which it gave rise.

The whole procesg<of mountain building in the East Indiaii regian may be looked upon as a crumpling of the earth’s crust in the area between the Soeada stable block on the one hand, and the floor of the Indian Ocean and the Sahoel stable block on the other, with the pressure apparently coming from the former towards the latter.

At the same time it w^as noted that a gravitationaJ force slightly greater than expected occurs especially in the region of the abyssal troughs in the Banda and Flares seas, and to a less extent in the vdcaiik arc, in both of which areas the lieavier sub- crustal material is covered with a relatively thin crust of lighter material. It is noteworthy that w here the second fold-arc approaches most closely to the first—in the islands of AJor and Wetar—it has some of the charactenstics of tlie older fold, and the volcanoes arc extinct. The arcuate form of the folds on the earth's surface is perhaps the result of movement up a gently inclined \"thrust-pbne' which dips towards the north j the outcrop of such a thrust-plane on the spherical surface of the globe is an arc of a cirdep convex towards the south. That the East Indian arcs are imperfect is pbvigua from the map^ hut it is equally clear that the imperfeetJons are due to the way in which the folds have accommodated themselves to the form of the stable Sahoe] massif towinxls which they have been pressed. The \"spear-head* of western New Guinea has notably affected the cumture of the two Banda arcs and thdr possible continuations in the islands of Celebes and Halmaheiu* GliOLOGV AND PHYSICAL FtATDRK Ab the fold'i^^ves spread ot^tvards, Literal tension caused breaks to occur, with cMerential horizontal movement, and hence the folds appear not as a continuous ridge, but as a series of elongated islands, separated by deep channels which obviously cannot have been pcavated by rivers. Thus the channel between Bali and Lombok, m the inner fold, reaches a depth of over 3<5a fathoms, that between Soemba and Sawoe, in the outer fold, is more than 700 fathoms deep. Moreover, it has been yemdnstrated that the fold-axis of western Java has moved forward {he. south^vardj nearly three milea relatively to its continuation in southern Sumatra—a fact with which the ^stenee of the famous volcano Krakatau, in the middle of the Soenda Strait, may not he unconnected. A similar shift has been proven in the Mani|M Strait between the islands of Ceram and Boeroe. CoHlofumg MovanetiL The movement of the fold belts is con- ^uing. The uplifted coral neefij of 'i'hnor which must have been ormed just below sea level, have already been mentioned* similar occurrences at 300 01.-500 m. altitude are found in the nearby islands of Rod and Sawoe. Further north, in the Toekang Besi laLmds, off Celebes, and elsew'herc, downfolds are accompanied by upward- growing coral reefs, in which the upward growth of coral has kept pace with the slow sagging along a synclinal axis (Fig. n). Further evidence of continuing disturbance is provided by the frequency of volcanic eruptions in the inner arc, and of oarthquakea.

They approach the coast as a long unbrokea sweU* the fteight increasing as the water gets shallower. The first movement observed at the shore is a slow withdrawal of the watcr^ after which the wave advances and sweeps over the low- lying country. Similar phenomena often accompany submarine volcanic eruptiojxa. The most disastrous ever known, perhaps in the world^s history^ w^as the wave which foUow'ed the cataclysmal eruption of Krakatau in 1883, reierred to on p. 25. In recent years on an average over 50O earth-tremors have been recorded annually in the East Indies, about one-third of Avhich occurred in Sumatra. The most serious earthquakes during the last fifty years wxrc in the island of Ceram in and at Renkoelen^ pn the west coast of Sumatra, m 1914 (Plate The Volcanoes The existence of over seventy active volcanoea in the East Indian region is in itself a justification for a more elaborate treatment of the phenomena of volcanicity; but the subject is far from being one of academic interest only^ for to a large extent human life in Java and in parts of other islands is dependent on the presence of these volcanoes. The weathering of volcanic debris under conditions of equatorial climate produces soils of unparalleled lichni^ that support a dense agricultu^ population. But the volcanoes are not merely bimefieent in their infiuence; they can also be dangerous enemies of mankindp and for this reason their behaviour is more closely studied in Java than in any other volcanic region in the world. The Netherlands Indies Volcanological Survey, which is a divi$ion of the Government Geological Survey^ 13 mgaged in two branches of work. In the first place it is concerned with the exploration and sun^ey of volcanoes, both active and extinct, and with morphological and geological studies relating thereto, and secondly it organizes the collection of reliable scientific data about present volcanic activity with a view to predicting eruptions and as far as possible guarding against their eril effects. Most of the Surveywork is done in Java, where the agricultural population is in dusest proximity to the THE V0LCAjV\"OE& J 9 volciiiioes and the dangers are therefore greatest. Here, permanently- staffed obaervatipu posts are maintained on seven active TOlcanoear At these stations daily records of the state of activity within die craters^ and measurements of the temperature of steam and gas emanations and otfier phenomena are made, and the population of the surrounding regions b warned of impending danger. The other ten active votcanoes In Java, which are less thmgerous, are ^isited and reported on several times a year.^ Outside Java, fhr surroundings of the active volcanoes are usually far less densely peopled, and consequently only intermittent watch is kept. Volca^'ciiy Volcanicity comprises all phenomena associated with the rise of hot rock liquid, known as magma (temperature about i^doo^ C or more), to the proximity of die earth's surface. The liquid stiffens into stone on cooling, and the term is applied both to the liquid and the solid rock. Cracks or weaknesses in earthb crust in regions where the magma m the surface arc liable to allov^' some of the liquid lava to be poured forth, forming lava-flow's. With ecsplosiv e activity at the place of emission, the lava is blown skywards and fragmented. The fineaE matcrml is known as ash, larger fragments are called lapiIH (^little stones'\"), and compact masses more than a few centimetres in diameter are called bombs. The ash may form such dense and extenshe clouds that daylight may be excluded over wide areas. Most of the matenal, however, falls down around the explosion- vent, forming a cone with a wide funnel-shaped crater. A single eruption Is capable of forming such a cane* but the East Indian volcano^ are the result of many eruptions extending over perhaps scores or even hundreds of thousands of years, and often ownbining lava-flows as well, so that the resulting cones are gigantic etructureSp, often reaching elevatioiis of over 3,000 m. (10,000 ft.) and sometimes having several active or extinct eruption points. Sometimes the cones are grouped in more or less circular form arotind the edge of a Large plateau, itself probably a gigantic emter, with a smaller cone or cones in the middle^ and the whole formation is then known as a \" caldera Volcanicity includes more than just eruptions of ash and lava, however. Even though most of the subterraneau magma has crystal* Iked* the very existence of the hot mass not far from the surface may C^use cmanationa of gases, sEcam and hot water long after active eruption has ceased. In the cks&ification of the NT. Volcanological 20 GEOLOGY AP4D PHYSICAL FEATUEES Sur^'^eVp all volcanoes which are known to have had eruptions of ash or lava since A.D. 1600 are reckoned as ractive\\ whilst those in which the activity has bee^ confined to steam and gas are regarded as ^ dormant ^ or^ to use the scientific term^ *m the fumarolic stage \\ Volcanic cones which have neither eruptions nor fumaroles to their credit are regarded as extinct. Fumaroks are steam- and gas-vents. The cooling and crystallizingp magma contains steam and other gases in elution, and these accumulate and boil off as GrystaUiiation proceeds^ blowing off through fissures. The gases are mainly carbon dioxide (CO,) and sulphuretted hydrogen (H,S). Sometimes the activity may take the farm of boding mud or hot springs of sulphur- laden water—known as solfafarsSr The temperature of fucnaroles may be anything from mere ivarmth to 600\"^ C, (i,iqo° F.), whilst the high pressure to which the vapours are subjected undcjgrouJid may raise the t>oiling point of the neater very much above normal. Some aspects of fumarolic activity are useful to man. Sulphur is frequently deposited, and the hot springs may be used for bathing and for medicinal waters. But the concentration of heavy suffocating gases is sometimes dangerous^ and there are numerous examples in Java of ^ death-valleys' {in Dutch* dood^dal or stiktailM) where lethal gases may flowr down and accumulate to a depth of many feet, killing off first the ground fauna, then small animals, and lastly human beings (see, for exarriple^ Figs. 15 and f6). Most of the eruptive activity in the East Indies takes the form of ash-eruptions^ bva Hows being comparatively rare and of limited extent. The magma is generaEy of an intermediate or basic compoai- non, producing the rocks which are knowm as andesite and basalt.

It is here that volcanic activity reaches its maximum intensity; and the density of population makes the study of the volcanoes of vital importance. Several of the Javanese volcanoes are described below. The belt continues through the Laser Soenda islands (Fig. ra). Bali, Lombok and Soembawa each have one major volcanoj but the activity becomes more titenie again in Flores, where nine active and a number of dermaut and extinct centres are known, llie belt is rather broader in Flores and its adjacent islands of Adonara, Lomhlcn and Pantar, and two aroall islands north of the main chain—^Paloeweh and Komha—are also active volcanoes.

Krakatait (Fig. 14). Krakatau, in the middle of the Soenda strait, is one of the world’s moat famous—or infamous—volcanoes, Tn 1&83, after a period of quiescence lasting for 200 years, it burst into violent activity, which culminated in the paroxysmal eruption of August 26-27, prubably the greatest disaster of its kind in human history. A large part of the main island disappeared, cither engulfed by the sea or blown into the aty. Steam and ash rose to a height of 20 km, (12 mdes), and a rain of ashes fell all over southern Sumatra, as far north a& Singapore, as far east as Batavia, and southwards to the Cocos islands; the finer particles of dust floated round the earth in the upper atmosphere for many months, causing brilliant sunsets. The sound of the etploslon was heard at Perth in Western Australia, in New Guinea, in Ceylon and in Mauritius. The sea In the Soenda stiait was covered with pumice—but the disaster came not so much from the shower of ashes as from the wai-es which the explosion created. The sboreg of the strait were devastated by inundations, wych in places reached a height of 36 m. (118 ft.) above normal sea IctcI, and penetrated inland for distances up to 10 km. Scores of vill^es were obliterated, and the town of Teloekbetoeng, at the head of Lampoeng bay in southern Sumatra, ivas destroyed. A small stimner was washed 3 km, inland near here, and its boiler was still lying in a river bed in 1929. Altogether some 36,000 people perished. ^ For .j4 years after this catastrophe, Krakatau remained quiet. Vegetation, which waa completely destroyed during the eruption, reappeared, and the three laJands, ^er suffering considerable erosion of their soft and unprotected shores, assumed a fairly stable outline. Then, at the end of 1927, glowing bombs emerged ftnm the sea at a point about midway bettvecn the islands, and shortly aftenvards a new island—christened Anak Krakatau (‘the child nf Krakatau’)— appeared above the waves. Erosion by atirf soon removed this, but 36 4 GEOLOGY AN© PHYSICAL ^EAXUBm after rising and disappearing several more times the Anak—the fourth in the series—became firmly established*in August 1930, since whenj though its height and size have fiuctuated considerably, it has never completely disappearetf.

ITic 'scorching clouds^ had been observed on several occasions, but they were first scientifically studied in 1920—21, and the 1930 eruption provided more grand but caAscrophic es^jnples. The greatest avalanche rushed the Blongkeng ra^riiic and spread out over the land beloWj estending for 12 km. and destroying zo sq. km. of country^ including thirteen villages {with twenty-three more partly destroyed) and anniMIaliEig ij.369 people and Zpioto animals. The ash clouds were so thick that the ground ivas covered for depths of up to 40 cm. (15 inches). This eruption left a great elcft, 850 m. long and 250 m. deep^ near the top of the mountain; as a result the old lava plugs in the crater collapsed. \"^I'he following year a ne^v lava stream spread slowly down tlie side for a distance of 2 km., accompanied by scorching clouds and rains of ash. Further big eruptions of lava in *934 spread ash as far west as Bandoeng^, 320 km. {20Q miles) distant, and produced a new lava flow which generated ladoes and scorching clouds. Merapi is carefully watched. In 1931 an electric rain-gauge was set up to give warning of esce^ive falls w^hich might cause Jahara; a warning given by this means in 1932 probably saved gome loss of life, though it could not of course pre\\rent the damage to Hcefields and Ullages. In 1937 a siren was Installed at one observation poat to warn certain of the more vulnerable villages. Keloed (Figs. 19 and 30). Keloed rivals Merapi in destmetivenesfi, despite its comparative insignificance amongst the Javanese volcanic giants. Its summit rises to a mere 1,731 m.

The peak of Keloed ia an andesite mass, possibly the la^'a plug of an ancient volcano.

The vulcano Batoert on the island of Balij is one of the largest closed calderas in any volcanic region of the world; its oval outer rim measures 13 8 km. from nW-se and 10 km. from sw-NE, Within this is a second caldera, 7 km. in diameter. The highest point of the outer rim is Goenoeng Abang (2^153 m.) in the aouth^eastj an old volcano cut in half by the formation of the cauldron subsidence. At its foot is the large lake^ Danau Batoeri about 90 m. deepp formed by subsidence. In the middle of the oval is the present active centre, Guenoeng Batoer (1,717 m,)* vnth a xvnr\\ summit and several groups of ciaters, mcludtng many parasitic craters at the foot of the cone. Seven bva flovvs have been recorded during the past hundred years; the last was in 1926, when in the space of seven weeks 21 million cu, m, of bva pouted out, and one branch of the flow geolocit and physical features 38 engulfed the Hindu vDlage of Batoer, which live years previously had been closely approached by another flow (Plate jzy Paloezc^h, There are several small island volcanoes in the Lesser Soenda and Banda chains^ and PaJoeweh may be taken as an example.

The Minahasa peninsula of Celebes contains numerous volcanoes, including several on ttie active list (Fig^ 15), Sopoetan is noteworthy for its numerous lava streams, almost every one of which has emanated from a different eruption point (cf. Lamongan, Fig. 22). The main summit crater (highest point of rim 1^784 m.) is 200 m. deep, but has only a few sdlfatnras. Recent eruptions—^thcre have been four since 1905—have emanated from two points about i km. north-east of the summit, and have howled either north-west or south-south-east. Coasts In later chapters details of the coast-Hiie of the major islands will be given. The following is a general account only^ intended to convey some idea of the main characteristiei. The very extensive coast-line qf the Netherlands Eaat Indies h ^timated at 25,000 nautical miles (46,000 km.). This figure, which 15 considerably in excess of the equatorml circumference of the earth (40,000 km.) results from the very large number of islands in the Archipelago and from the complexity of their coasts, which are frequently indented by wide bays and narrow, penetrating inlets. Below high tide mark fringing and barrier coral reefs often occur and are a hindrance to navigation in any but the smallest sea-going boats. The sta water inshore is usually wonderfully clear, enabling qne to see in bright sunlight objects on the sea-bed at a depth of five fathoms. Exceptions to this clarity occur at the mouths of rivers, and on mangrove coasts, where the w^ter is generally muddy. The water inshore is also very warm, about 27° C. {80° F.), and it b possible to bathe for long periods w^ithout bad results. \"iTiere are, however, crocodiles, biting fish, and fish wHth poisonous spines that may give trouble, while certain jelly-fish can inflict a very painful sting. An affection of the ear, known as * Singapore Ear ’, also has to be guarded against. Bathing off an open shore may be indulged m for years without accident, but it ts safer to be protected by an enclosure of stakes, which keep out the larger marauders such as sharks, rays and crocodiles, numerous body of men landing from the sea, however, would scare a way alt such nuisances into deeper water. COASTS 4t The followini; types of coast-line are found: i. Mangrove syvamp. ii, CoraJ shores, lii, Sandy beaches. iv. Rocky shores and headlands. V. Precipitous cliffs with no beaches, vi, Reaches formed of volcanic rocks, , , t. Mangrove asamps occupy a large proportion of the coast-line on the inner or ‘continental’ side of Sumatra, Borneo and New Guinea, where Tivef-bome silt accumulates in vast quantities on the shores of the shallow waters of the Soenda and Sahoel shelves. They form the most tinattractivc sea-shores that can be found anywhere: mud and monotonous vegetation arc their two chief cbaracteristica. The commonest animal life usually visible comprises the goggle-eyed mird-skippeis, little fish with large heads and protruding eyes that slither over the mud at low tide and climb up onto the aerial tree- roots. and ‘calling crabs’ or ‘fiddlers’, little crabs with one large claw coloured bright blue or red with wlilch they seem to beckon before they scurry down into their holes in the mud, 'I’he vegetation composing mangrove-forest consists of a few species only, compared with the many species of the inland forests, and although it thrives under very wet conditions the principal species exhibit certain characters found in plants adapted to withstand drought, the leaves being thick and somewhat lleshy, Mangrove-fortaits flourish best where the sea is quiet and a liberal supply of rich ailt from the rivers is necessary for extensive growrth. The first condition required is the formation of mud banks. On these the pioneer mangrove species, At>icfmia and Sonneratia., begin their hfe, sending out long rootlets into the mud fram which pneumat- ophorcs rise like asparagus shoots. These plants can stand submersion m seawater to a wonderful extent, the young trees being completely covered at high tide, but the neap high tide-mark is the limit, there being a lew days in svtty month above that when the trees are not covered; in other words, the trees cannot stand complete submersion every tide. After growth is established the Rhizophunureae become the most abundant trees, and the forests, which hold up more mud brought down by the rivers, show the characteristic aerial roots, forming slender flying buttresses and protruding from the grotind loops Hfee ersftended cruquet-hoops (p, and Fig. 132). On coasts where there is strong and sustained wave-action mangrove-forest ran only establish itself at the mnuths of rivera GEOLOGV AND PHYSICAL FEATUflES 4^ where fine silt and mud can collect msJde the sandy bars that coTTiTUQuIy block the entrances. Where prolonged scouring by waves takes place sandy or rocky beaches are fonned, but it sometimes happens that mangrove is found immediately behind them. Except in the river channels—which arc often liard to find^ for the mangrove coast is very monotonous and featureless—access by whaler maj\" be possible only in the smallest boats, as the mud on which the mangrove thrives extends far out to sea^ and off some coasts, e.g. western Borneo and south-w^tem New Guinea, may cause ships to run aground before land is sighted. Creeks and channels in mangrove-forest are somerimes inhabited by fishermen and woodcutters who earn a living by procuring firew^ood. They hve in roughly built houses on piles^ and It Is stated on good authority tliat mangrove-swamps, though generally swarming day and night with mosquitoes and sandflies, are aurprisingiy healthy . iTiis may be due to the absence of anopheline mosquitoeSt but is more likely due to the thin population and the small opportunity that anophclinc mosquitoes have of becoming infected with malaria by biting a human carrier of die disease. At night sw^arms of fire-flies frequently ilJuminate the tops of certain species of trees in these swamps. A poisonous snake (l^Aeris) with dark green and yellow bands is common; its bite produces severe results but is not fatal. Crocodiles {Crocodylm poro^NSj the only salt-water species) arc very numerous and may be seen far out at sea, especially off river mouths. WTien passing along a mangrove channel one sees these creatures slide down from the mud into the water as they take alarm. A crocodile will often attack small boats and upset them with its tail. Mangrove-swamp coasts are coustandy growing seaward with occasional checks caused by erosion, but st the same time the inland forest constantly encroaches on the landward side as the soil con¬ solidates. The mangrove-forests are mteraected by aumernus channels along which boats can pass from one river-system to another or from one branch of a delta to another^ Such channels are called th’usan or pinta by Malays^ (troes^im in Dutch orthography) both words being equivalent to our * short cul\\ These channeb sometimes, as in the case of die Palembang river in Sumatra, form a complicated netW'Ork in the mangfove-forest and without an experienced guide losing oneb way is an easy matter and very unpleasant. Some say that maiigTove-Rwainps as residential areas are by no means as black as they are painted, but others w ho know' them wcU fail to af?e anything attractive apart from Some special mission, such COASTS *3 as obtaining firewood or other forest products, or scientific investiga¬ tion. Walking in them h far from pleasant. One may sink in the mud knee-deep or more, or only ankle-deep. Aerial roots may be some help as steps but on the other hand the loops protruding from the mud trip up the unwary and the pneumatophores sticking up out of the mud are also a hindrance. Mangrove mud is evil^elling and the only good thing to he said for it is thiit it is viarm. iV. Ccral, The ntxt most characteristic shores are those w£ere coral grows. Corals require clear water but; as has been proved in Batavia bay, they can sometimes grow on a muddy sea-floor. The coral polyps cannot live below 3.5 fathoms, and in consequence the great thin¬ nesses of coral rock sometimes found in the East Indies can only have accumulated through a sinking of the land or a rise in the sea level- Coral-reefs do not consist entirely of coral; calcareous algae play a very important part In their formatioo, and sand composed of the shells of foraminifera is also found. Reefs occur in three forms, fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atoUs. Fringing reefs are flats at sea level, up to half 3 mile in width with a wall on the seaward side tliat dips into deep water. The inner or landward side is composed largely of dead coral with spiny sea- urchins, shells ranging from the smallest to the giant clam weighing up to 500 ibs. and calcareous algae. Barrier mJs are separated from the shore by a belt of sea which may be many miles in width, ^rhe sea-boltom betTji'een the barrier reefs and the land 1$ composed of fine calcareous matter. Good examples of barrier-reefs oectir off the west coast of Sumatra, off the east coast of Borneo (where the reef marks the eastern ed^ of the Soenda Shelf, see p. 12 and Fig, 7) and off the coasts of Celebea. Atolls arc not so common in the East Indies as in the Pacific archifjelagots,^ They consist of a central lagoon, usually shallow and coral-filled, with a fringing reefp circulir or oval m forra and seldom completely above water for tlie whole of its drcuinfcrence. A few palms may grow on the parts permanently above sea level Good examples of atolls occur in the Toehang Besi islands^ to the south¬ east of Celebes {Fig, nj and elsewhere. Bcach^ overtooking coral reefs are formed laigely of broken coral ^ grade from fine sand to coarse detritus that can be used for building. x 4 t the head of tlie beach a cliff of consolidated coral- rock is often found, generally strongly undercut by the sea. This coralrock may extend uiland and reach cunsfderable elevations, due In some measure to a slight fall in the sea level which is believed to 44 GEOLOGY AND EHTSlCm FEATUKE have foUmved on the much greater ri^ after the Pldstocene gkciatioiij but mainly to the uplift of the land (rf. pp. 1 1, i6)- Coral-reefs have very rough and hard surfaces that make progress on foot at low dde diQicuit. TTie coraJ-rock also is difficult to walk dver,, being hard and having irfcgular^ jagged and honey-combed surfaces. Hi. Sandy beaches a*? forpred where wave actiont tides and currents are su^ciently strong to pre^^ent the formadon of mud-Sats and mangrove swamps. They are a marked contrast to the latter type of shore, in some cases they extend for mil^j giying a firm surface over which one can walk or bicycle freely and w-ith enjoyment. Sometimes they are bordered by difFs* or they may rise gently to the inland surface. Immediately abo%'e high tide mark vegetation begins. Short grass, bushes, among them being a conspicuous Hibiscus with yellow and purple flowers, and an with violet-coloured floweis, are found, \"^fbe Ipomea spreads over the ground and to some extent prevents the sand from being blown inland. A fringe of graceful casuaiina trees often lines the beach for many miles and affords a welcome shelter from the hot sun. Cocoimt-palms thrive w'dl along such beaches and native settlements ajre therefore found close to the shore. Brilliant sunlight and cool sea-breezes make these sandy beaches very pleasant resorts, but if they are near villages anyone camping on them liaka being infected with malaria. It should be add^ that turtles^ found buried in the sand; they are excellent eating. Shingle is rare and is only found where such rocks as the Triassic conglomerate (composed of pehble$) are exposed, as for instance on Samboe, a small island in the Jtiouw archipelago just south of Singapore, Sandhills arc sometime found, for instance on Madoera, where also, as in many other places.^ the screw-pine (Pof^danus) grows close to the sea, Pan^ of the south coast of Java, exposed to the swell of the Indian Ocean^ are formed of parallel belts of sand dunes, which sometimes rise to a height of zo m. (66 ft,). On some sandy beaches where the sand is derived from granite the action of the whycs concentrates the heavier mineral grains to form a strip of black sand a few inches thick. In Malaya such black sand has been found to be rich in cassiterite (tin-ore), and the satni. may be the case in the tin-bearing islands of the Arehipelago. The chief minerals in this bbek sand, however, are ilmenite (dtaniferous iron-o3(ide) and tourmaline. Other beaches of black sand, derived COASTS 45 from voli^anii!; ri^ks, are found /jh the south coast of Java and else- where* w. Rocky fhores and headlands are found where mountain spurs e3d:end down to the sea and where isolated masses of mek are situated on the shore-line- The surface of rocky shores varies with the nature of the rock, and the same apphes to headlands. Granite and similaj rocks produce numerous boulders of large sizt with patches of sand. Eedded rocks such as shale and schists arc'planed down by the sea to sloping platforms expesed at low tide and sometimes hardened by the deposition of black or brown iron-oxide. Bedded rocks on head¬ lands show minute details of structure^ such as folding. An important negative feature of rocky shores and headlands in East Indian waters is that where the sea is calm thick growths of seaweed on the rocks, such as occur on some parts of the English coast, are absent. There is no slippery^ Burface of weed to fall on, and in fact an encriiscation of small but palatable oiraters helps to give a firm foothold in many places. The reason for the comparative scarcity of seaweeds is that they require well aerated water, w hich calm and warm equatorial seas cannot provide. Seaweeds certaifdy occur in places, however, especially m the Moluccas, where they may be used as human food; of the three types, brown, green and red, the red are the commonest. In addition to seaweeds, sea-grass occurs, Enhaius^ known to the Javanese as jelamoen, and in Sumatra as jari ambun, is a marine plant found in the sea about and below low water mark. It h believed to be one of the chief foods of the sea-cow or dugong^ This plant resembles the British Zoiitra (sea grass). Tropical vegetation in full luxuriance crowns the rocky headlands and overhangs the rocks. Plan ts take every opportunity of establishing themselves until they are stopped by the bare rDck$ and inhospitable sand, so that one can climb from a headland straight into the densest forest [Elate 5^). V, Predpitous cliffs plunging into the sea with no beach are some¬ times found, particularly wfrere quartalte or limestone forms the coast. In the case of limestone, which Is found as Isolated islets with vertical and e\\Tn overhanging cliffs, the rock is frequently so strongly undercut by the s<a, hmeatune being a soluble rock, that a small boat can shelter under the overhanging mass. In general, however, cliffs such as arc characteristic of so much of the British coast are com¬ paratively rare in the Netherlands Indies. One of the main reasons, no doubt, is the much greater rapidity of weathering in an equatorial GEOLOGY Amj PHYSICAL FEATUHES 46 climate, and a correspondingly greater speed of vegetative growth. What in Britain would be bare cliffs thus became emnibled, rocky headlands covered with scrub, wood or even forest. tst. Volcotuc beii^hts. A special type of rocky and sandy shores is afforded by volcanoes w hen near cnougb to the sea. The sand of such beaches, derivned from ashes and la\\Ti, la generally dark in colour, hut w'hea compos^ o&brofaen-up pumice it is light-coloured. Blocks of lava and consolidated ashes are piled up on some shores and high voh^c cliffs are found. Veiy- good examples of these shores arc ^jbited on the three islands of the Krakatau group. On the muln island, l^akata (813 m.—2.667 ft,), the 1883 eruption has left a ttemendous precipice that is a section of an old volcano showing its mner structure very clearly. Lang island, nearby, shows low cUffo of pmnice derived from the same eruption and a beach of the same material (Fig. 14). BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE Tfc: inDrt uaefid viliA in Englidi h H. A.
