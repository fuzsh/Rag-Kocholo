I’m not shooting much Elitserien hockey this season as I mostly filling in when other photographers are unavailable. This past Thurday I got to shoot my first hockey game of 2012, it was a match between Stockholm’s Djurgården IF and Gothenburg’s Frölunda HC.

The match quickly became extremely tense as Frölunda player Jari Tolsa hit two Djurgården players in the head from their blind side. Causing a couple of injuries and starting a couple of fights in the process. On top of the fights, injuries, and expulsions the match saw Djurgården take the lead only to see Frölunda tie it and then take the lead themselves. Djurgården eventually managed to tie it late in the 3rd period after keeping Frölunda under extreme pressure, only to lose the game to Frölunda in overtime.

Hover the most interesting bit of this story comes much later once I got home and was ready to turn in and call it quit for night. I got a call from an editor with Swedish newspaper Expressen asking me if I had anymore pictures from the fight which I might have missed and not uploaded into my agency’s picture bank. I asked him exactly what he was interested in and went and had a look to see if there was something I missed. Luckily I found a few pictures I thought might interest him so I quickly mailed them his way.

The next morning it wasn’t too much of a surprise when I saw one of my pictures accompanying a story on the game.
