        "text": "Two months ago Myron S. Scholes made a sentimental journey to the steel-manufacturing city of Hamilton, Ontario, to be honored as a local boy made good.\n\nHe had recently been awarded, with Robert C. Merton, the Nobel award in economics, for breakthrough work in finding a way to value risky financial investments known as options. Those formulas, devised 25 years ago, made sophisticated investing more of a science and less of an art, encouraging the growth of a host of new securities markets. Many people made millions.\n\nThe trip home was one of a number of personal appearances that amounted to, in Mr. Scholes's words, a victory lap. As the star guest at a party in Hamilton, he described his trip to Sweden to accept the Nobel and spoke fondly of the local people who had looked after him in his youth. At the end, he nearly broke down in tears.\n\nCertainly, it was an emotional moment. But there was something else. Back home in Greenwich, Conn., the situation was grave.\n\nThe giant investment fund in which Mr. Scholes and Mr. Merton were partners, Long-Term Capital Management, was on the edge of financial ruin. The fund had made a variety of big, risky bets that had gone terribly wrong. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York would within a week organize a private takeover to prevent the fund's outright failure and a rout in the world's financial markets.\n\nIn the end, the very thing that the two economists had taught the world to understand -- managing investment risk -- proved their undoing.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
