        "text": "The Black-Scholes model is one of the most important concepts in modern financial theory. Also known as the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, this mathematical equation estimates the theoretical value of derivatives based on other investment instruments, taking the impact of time and other risk factors into account. It was developed in 1973 and is still regarded as one of the best ways to price an options contract.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe Black-Scholes model is also known as the Black-Scholes-Merton or BSM model.\n\nIt's a differential equation that's widely used to price options contracts.\n\nThe Black-Scholes model requires five input variables: the strike price of an option, the current stock price, the time to expiration, the risk-free rate, and the volatility.\n\nThe Black-Scholes model is usually accurate but it makes certain assumptions that can lead to predictions that deviate from real-world results.\n\nThe standard BSM model is only used to price European options because it doesn't take into account that American options could be exercised before the expiration date.\n\nHistory of the Black-Scholes Model\n\nDeveloped in 1973 by Fischer Black, Robert Merton, and Myron Scholes, the Black-Scholes model was the first widely used mathematical method to calculate the theoretical value of an option contract. It uses current stock prices, expected dividends, the option's strike price, expected interest rates, time to expiration, and expected volatility.\n\nThe initial equation was introduced in Black and Scholes' 1973 paper, \"The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities,\" published in the Journal of Political Economy. Robert C. Merton helped edit the paper. He published his own article in The Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science later that year: \"Theory of Rational Option Pricing.\" He expanded the mathematical understanding and applications of the model and coined the term \"Black–Scholes theory of options pricing.\"\n\nScholes and Merton were awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for their work in finding \"a new method to determine the value of derivatives.\" Black had passed away two years earlier so he could not be a recipient because Nobel Prizes are not given posthumously. The Nobel Committee acknowledged his role in the Black-Scholes model, however.\n\nHow the Black-Scholes Model Works\n\nBlack-Scholes posits that instruments such as stock shares or futures contracts will have a lognormal distribution of prices following a random walk with constant drift and volatility. The equation uses this assumption and factors in other important variables to derive the price of a European-style call option.\n\nThe Black-Scholes equation requires six variables: volatility, the price of the underlying asset, the strike price of the option, the time until the expiration of the option, the risk-free interest rate, and the type of option, whether it's call or put. It's theoretically possible for options sellers to set rational prices with these variables for the options that they're selling.\n\nThe model predicts that the price of heavily traded assets follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and volatility. It incorporates the constant price variation of the stock, the time value of money, the option's strike price, and the time to the option's expiry when it's applied to a stock option.\n\nThe Black-Scholes model is often contrasted against the binomial model or a Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nBlack-Scholes Assumptions\n\nThe Black-Scholes model makes certain assumptions:\n\nNo dividends are paid out during the life of the option.\n\nMarkets are random because market movements can't be predicted.\n\nThere are no transaction costs in buying the option.\n\nThe risk-free rate and volatility of the underlying asset are known and constant.\n\nThe returns of the underlying asset are normally distributed.\n\nThe option is European and can only be exercised at expiration.\n\nThe original Black-Scholes model didn't consider the effects of dividends paid during the life of the option but the model is frequently adapted to account for dividends by determining the ex-dividend date value of the underlying stock. The model is also modified by many option-selling market makers to account for the effect of options that can be exercised before expiration.\n\nFirms will alternatively use a binomial or trinomial model or the Bjerksund-Stensland model for the pricing of the more commonly traded American-style options.\n\nThe Black-Scholes Model Formula\n\nThe mathematics involved in the formula are complicated and can be intimidating but you don't have to know or even understand the math to use Black-Scholes modeling in your strategies. Options traders have access to a variety of online options calculators and many trading platforms boast robust options analysis tools that include indicators and spreadsheets that perform the calculations and output the options pricing values.\n\nThe Black-Scholes call option formula is calculated by multiplying the stock price by the cumulative standard normal probability distribution function. The net present value (NPV) of the strike price multiplied by the cumulative standard normal distribution is then subtracted from the resulting value of the previous calculation.\n\nC = S N ( d 1 ) − K e − r t N ( d 2 ) where: d 1 = l n K S + ( r + σ v 2 2 ) t σ s t and d 2 = d 1 − σ s t and where: C = Call option price S = Current stock (or other underlying) price K = Strike price r = Risk-free interest rate t = Time to maturity N = A normal distribution \\begin{aligned}&C = SN (d_1) - Ke ^{-rt} N (d_2) \\\\&\\textbf{where:} \\\\&d_1 = \\frac { ln ^ S_K + (r + \\frac { \\sigma^2_v }{ 2 } ) t }{ \\sigma_s \\sqrt { t } } \\\\&\\text{and} \\\\&d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma_s \\sqrt { t } \\\\&\\textbf{and where:} \\\\&C = \\text{Call option price} \\\\&S = \\text{Current stock (or other underlying) price} \\\\&K = \\text{Strike price} \\\\&r = \\text{Risk-free interest rate} \\\\&t = \\text{Time to maturity} \\\\&N = \\text{A normal distribution} \\\\\\end{aligned} ​C=SN(d1​)−Ke−rtN(d2​)where:d1​=σs​t​lnKS​+(r+2σv2​​)t​andd2​=d1​−σs​t​and where:C=Call option priceS=Current stock (or other underlying) priceK=Strike pricer=Risk-free interest ratet=Time to maturityN=A normal distribution​\n\nVolatility Skew\n\nBlack-Scholes assumes that stock prices follow a lognormal distribution because asset prices can't be negative, They're bounded by zero.\n\nAsset prices are often observed to have significant right skewness and some degree of kurtosis or fat tails. High-risk downward moves often happen more often in the market than a normal distribution predicts.\n\nAccording to the Black-Scholes model, the assumption of lognormal underlying asset prices should show that implied volatilities are similar for each strike price. Implied volatilities for at-the-money options have been lower than those further out of the money or far in the money, however, since the market crash of 1987. The market is pricing in a greater likelihood of a high volatility move to the downside in the markets.\n\nThis has led to the presence of the volatility skew. A smile or skewed shape can be seen when the implied volatilities for options with the same expiration date are mapped out on a graph. The Black-Scholes model is therefore not efficient for calculating implied volatility.\n\nBenefits and Limitations of the Black-Scholes Model\n\nBenefits\n\nActs as a stable framework based on a defined method.\n\nAllows investors to mitigate risk by better understanding exposure\n\nMay be used to devise strategies for creating a portfolio based on an investor's preferences.\n\nStreamlines and improves efficient calculating and reporting of figures\n\nLimitations\n\nDoesn't take all types of options into consideration\n\nMay lack cashflow flexibility based on the future projections of a security\n\nMay make inaccurate assumptions about future stable volatility\n\nRelies on several other assumptions that may not materialize into the actual price of the security\n\nBenefits of the Black-Scholes Model\n\nThe Black-Scholes model has been successfully implemented and used by many financial professionals due to the variety of benefits it has to offer.\n\nProvides a framework: The Black-Scholes model provides a theoretical framework for pricing options. This allows investors and traders to determine the fair price of an option using a structured, defined methodology that has been tried and tested.\n\nAllows for risk management: Investors can use the Black-Scholes model to manage their risk exposure to various assets by knowing the theoretical value of an option. The Black-Scholes model is therefore useful to investors not only in evaluating potential returns but also in understanding portfolio weakness and deficient investment areas.\n\nAllows for portfolio optimization: The Black-Scholes model can be used to optimize portfolios by providing a measure of the expected returns and risks associated with different options. This allows investors to make smarter choices that are better aligned with their risk tolerance and pursuit of profit.\n\nEnhances market efficiency: The Black-Scholes model has led to greater market efficiency and transparency as traders and investors are better able to price and trade options. This simplifies the pricing process because there's a greater implicit understanding of how prices are derived.\n\nStreamlines pricing: The Black-Scholes model is widely accepted and used by practitioners in the financial industry, allowing for greater consistency and comparability across markets and jurisdictions.\n\nLimitations of the Black-Scholes Model\n\nThe Black-Scholes model is widely used but there are still some drawbacks to the model.\n\nLimits usefulness: The Black-Scholes model is only used to price European options. It doesn't take into account that U.S. options could be exercised before the expiration date.\n\nLacks cashflow flexibility: The model assumes dividends and risk-free rates are constant but this may not be the case. The Black-Scholes model may therefore lack the ability to truly reflect the accurate future cash flow of an investment due to model rigidity.\n\nAssumes constant volatility: The model also assumes that volatility remains constant over the option's life. This is often not the case because volatility fluctuates with the level of supply and demand.\n\nMisleads other assumptions: The Black-Scholes model also leverages other assumptions. These include that there are no transaction costs or taxes, the risk-free interest rate is constant for all maturities, short selling of securities with the use of proceeds is permitted, and no arbitrage opportunities come without risk. Each of these assumptions can lead to prices that deviate from actual results.\n\nWhat Does the Black-Scholes Model Do?\n\nThe Black-Scholes model, also known as the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM), was the first widely used model for option pricing. The equation calculates the price of a European-style call option based on known variables like the current price, maturity date, and strike price based on certain assumptions about the behavior of asset prices,\n\nIt does so by subtracting the net present value (NPV) of the strike price multiplied by the cumulative standard normal distribution from the product of the stock price and the cumulative standard normal probability distribution function.\n\nWhat Are the Inputs for the Black-Scholes Model?\n\nThe inputs for the Black-Scholes equation are volatility, the price of the underlying asset, the strike price of the option, the time until the expiration of the option, the risk-free interest rate, and the type of option. It's theoretically possible for options sellers to set rational prices with these variables for the options they're selling.\n\nWhat Assumptions Does the Black-Scholes Model Make?\n\nThe original Black-Scholes model assumes that the option is a European-style option and can only be exercised at expiration.\n\nIt also assumes that no dividends are paid out during the option's life, that market movements follow a random walk and can't be predicted, that there are no transaction costs involved in buying the option, that the risk-free rate and volatility of the underlying option are known and constant, and that the prices of the underlying asset follow a log-normal distribution.\n\nWhat Are the Limitations of the Black-Scholes Model?\n\nThe Black-Scholes model is only used to price European options. It doesn't take into account that American options could be exercised before the expiration date. The model also assumes that dividends, volatility, and risk-free rates remain constant over the option's life. Not taking taxes, commissions, or trading costs into account can also lead to valuations that deviate from real-world results.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Black-Scholes model is a mathematical model that's used to calculate the fair price or theoretical value of an asset. It provides a way to calculate the theoretical value of an option by taking into account the underlying asset's current price, the option's type, the option's strike price, the time remaining until expiration, the risk-free interest rate, and the volatility of the underlying asset.\n\nThe Black-Scholes model has had a profound impact on finance and has led to the development of a wide range of derivative products such as futures, swaps, and options."
