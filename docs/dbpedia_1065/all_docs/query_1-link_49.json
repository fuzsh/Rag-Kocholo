Itô's work has had a profound influence on the development of probability theory and has been applied across a wide range of areas. It centers on the study of random processes revolving around Brownian motion, which can be seen in phenomena as varied as the diffusion of pollen in water and the fluctuation of stock prices. His achievements are even more impressive because he did much of his groundbreaking work in the isolation of Japan during World War II and was unaware of many spectacular developments taking place in probability theory, some of which could have facilitated his work. Itô's techniques proved extremely useful in the study of stochastic differential equations and diffusion equations, leading to widespread applications in biology, electrical engineering, chemical reactions, quantum physics, and other areas. The most famous development coming out of the work of Itô may be in finance, namely, the Black-Scholes formula for pricing options. Itô obtained his D.Sc. from the Imperial University of Tokyo in 1945. In 1952, he became a professor at Kyoto University, where he remained until his retirement in 1979. He also served as director of the Research Institute of Mathematical Sciences at Kyoto University from 1976 to 1979.
