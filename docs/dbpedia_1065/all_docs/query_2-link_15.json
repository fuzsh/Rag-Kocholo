        "text": "Post by Russell Letson on\n\nLocus (the magazine I review for) is in the process of compiling several \"best-ever\" lists (which everyone then gets to wrangle over)--\n\nwww.locusmag.com/Roundtable/2012/12/all-time-novel-results-2012/\n\nAnd here are the raw poll results, along with compiler Mark Kelly's comments:\n\nwww.locusmag.com/2012/AllCenturyPollsResults.html\n\nMy personal picks from the top 15 for the 20th century are:\n\n1 Herbert, Frank : Dune (1965)\n\n8 Gibson, William : Neuromancer (1984)\n\n9 Bester, Alfred : The Stars My Destination (1957)\n\n12 Heinlein, Robert A. : The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (1966)\n\n13 Haldeman, Joe : The Forever War (1974)\n\n15 Niven, Larry : Ringworld (1970)\n\nWhile the only one from the 21st-century top-15 I would personally recommend is\n\nGibson, William : Pattern Recognition (2003)\n\nNeither top-15 is much like mine would be--though I didn't bother to vote, since I don't much like best-N lists. When I am asked for recommendations, I like to get some idea of what kind of fiction the asker already enjoys and tailor my response accordingly. Every year I write a wrap-up essay for the magazine, and every year I insist that my recommended-reading list is \"everything I've reviewed this year,\" with the understanding that not everyone shares my particular tastes.\n\nThat said, you can go to this page on the Locus website and type \"Letson\" in the search box, which will give a list of those of my print reviews that have been posted on the site:\n\nwww.locusmag.com/Reviews/\n\nYou may or may not find books to your taste there.\n\nPost by Dub on\n\nNot sure why but it's been decades since I've read any science fiction. I remember liking what I read. Ones I liked best were probably what everyone liked best: Heinlein's \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" and Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker.\"\n\nNot sure why I'm cluttering up this thread. I've nothing useful to add.\n\nPost by Russell Letson on\n\nStranger is a mixed bag--for my money, nowhere near Heinlein's best, though it has its moments. Star Maker, on the other hand (along with Last and First Men) is a keeper--though not a cozy read by any means. But between them, Wells and Stapledon established about 75% of all possible science-fiction tropes.\n\nI had cause to re-read the first section of The Forever War recently, and I'm impressed all over again at how good Joe Haldeman was right out of the chute. (It's his second novel.) Line by line, he's as good a writer as the field has produced. (Others in the same category from the post-1960s generations: John Varley, Walter Jon Williams, Michael Swanwick, Nancy Kress, Bill Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Charles Stross, to name a semi-random handful.)\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nI don't think it particularly fits the \"sci-fi\" label, but \"The Andromeda Strain\" by Crichton is a great book. Read it a couple times years ago and just re-read it on the Kindle last month. Wonderfully suspenseful.\n\nHe also wrote Jurassic Park, Congo, Timeline, I think the majority of his work has been made into movies.\n\nDavid Brin's Uplift series is good reading.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nLegacy of Heorot, Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, and Steven Barnes.\n\nWhy you should NEVER mess with Mother Nature.\n\nThese three authors have teamed up in different writing configurations to produce some pretty good stuff.\n\nFootfall\n\nIntegral Trees\n\nBeowulf's Children\n\nAnn McCafrey has some good light SciFi reading. Besides her Drangonrider series which really is SciFi not fantasy she has written good straight SciFi.\n\nAll these have sequels\n\nDinosaur Planet\n\nThe Ship That Sang\n\nDecision at Doona\n\nFreedom’s Challenge\n\nPost by kenlarsson on\n\nMaybe not science fiction per se, but I like the Cryptonomicon series of books by Neil Stephenson: Cryptonomicon, Quicksilver, The Confusion, and The System of the World. The last three, a trilogy, are a prequel of the first book.\n\nAnd if you want \"pure\" science fiction from him there's his Hugo and Locus award winning,\n\nThe Diamond Age: or A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer\n\nor\n\nAnathem or Readme, both excellent SF novels."
