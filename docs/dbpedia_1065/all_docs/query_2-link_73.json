These sixteen articles first appeared in the scholarly journal Science Fiction Studies from 1976 to 2010, and their collective focus spans nearly three centuries of sf, from Cyrano de Bergerac in 1657 to Olaf Stapledon in 1937. They have been selected not only for the quality of their analytical content (some have received the prestigious SFRA “Pioneer Award” for the best critical essay of the year) but also for how they represent the breadth of the genre itself as it has morphed through time. Although its origins and evolution continue to be the subject of lively debate among scholars, science fiction emerged as a genre in the imaginary voyages, utopias, and futuristic fiction of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. During the nineteenth century, it popularized its narrative recipe and ideological worldview in the gothic fiction of Mary Shelley, the extraordinary voyages of Jules Verne, and the scientific romances of H. G. Wells. And it eventually adopted its generic name and social identity in the American pulp-­fiction magazines of the 1920s and 1930s. Vintage Visions includes in-­depth discussions of important sf writers and themes from each of these seminal historical periods. In its appendix, it identifies 150 key works of early science fiction, listed in chronological order. And it features an extensive bibliography of criticism about early sf—the largest of its kind ever published and a valuable reference tool for all those who wish to do research in the field. It is important to understand that the critical essays in this book are not intended to serve as a general introduction to the world of early science fiction. Nor is their goal to offer “definitive” readings of specific sf authors and works. By virtue of their thematic breadth and the depth of their analytical insight, however, they do constitute an excellent snapshot of the current state of academic scholarship in this field. Let me give a brief explanation about the terminology used in this book. Vintage Visions is being published in Wesleyan University Press’s “Early Classics of Science Fiction” series. For definitional clarity, Wesleyan classifies as “early” those works of science fiction published before 1940—before World War II but, of more importance for sf scholars, prior to sf ’s “Golden Age,” which began when John W. Campbell took over the reins of Astound\n\n[ vii\n\ning magazine in the late 1930s. Some sf scholars prefer to use the epithet “proto” for sf published before 1940. But I find the term “proto-­sf ” intrinsically biased and dismissive; it implies that true science fiction came into being only at some later date. The term “early sf,” though admittedly more vague, does offer the advantage of not defining its subject exclusively and retroactively in terms of a subsequent narrative form. It allows these premodern fictional texts to stand on their own and be considered within their specific historical contexts, rather than being viewed as an unfinished “pre”-­ version of something else. From this more inclusive point of view, works of science fiction existed long before the term “science fiction” became the preferred label for this brand of speculative writing in the late 1930s. Also, as regards the standard abbreviations used in this book, most writers and aficionados of the genre eschew the label “sci-­fi” (too reminiscent of grade-­B Hollywood movies) and prefer instead “SF” or “sf.” In the original versions of the essays that follow, both upper- and lowercase versions of this abbreviation can be found. The reason for this is quite simple: the in-­house style of Science Fiction Studies changed from “SF” to “sf ” in the mid-­1990s. For purposes of this collection, the lowercase abbreviation “sf ” will be used throughout. Each essay in this volume is also followed by a short afterword written by its author (or, in a few cases, by another scholar) that has been added expressly for Vintage Visions. In asking for these afterwords, I left the door open for the contributors to decide for themselves how they wished to supplement their original article. As a result, the afterwords vary considerably in scope, content, and tone. For example, some discuss how their essay was conceived and written and how it sought to enhance the existing sf criticism of the time; others explain how it dovetailed with their professional careers and how their lives were changed by it; and still others offer a “state of the art” survey of various new critical studies that have appeared since their essay was published and go on to assess the latter’s historical significance in the context of today’s scholarship. In my letter to the contributors, I requested only that the afterwords be “useful and interesting to the reader.” I am confident they are both. Finally, these essays would most likely have never seen the light of day if it had not been for the hardworking editors of Science Fiction Studies, the journal in which they were originally published. I would like to recognize two in particular: Richard Dale Mullen, founder of SFS and managing editor from 1973 to 1979 and 1991 to 1998, and Robert M. Philmus, managing editor from 1979 to 1991. These two unsung heroes of sf scholarship viii ] P re fa ce\n\nwere exemplary editors—not only because of their vast knowledge of the sf field but also because of their uncompromising demand for accuracy, clarity, and documentational authenticity in every essay they published in Science Fiction Studies. This anthology would not have been possible without them.\n\nP refa ce\n\n[ ix\n\nVintage Visions\n\n••\n\n• 1• Cyrano de Bergerac’s Epistemological Bodies\n\n“Pregnant with a Thousand Definitions” Sylvie Romanowski The genre that is today called science fiction has its roots in the speculative tales and imaginary voyages of the seventeenth century and before. One early writer who is often hailed as an important precursor to what sf would later become was the French soldier and philosopher Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac. Although better known as the long-­nosed and chivalrous hero of an 1898 play by Edmond Rostand, Cyrano was also a daring thinker whose fantastic fictional voyages to the Moon and Sun offered new ways of thinking about humanity and the ­universe. This essay originally appeared in SFS 25, no. 3 (November 1998): 414–32.\n\nCyrano de Bergerac (1619–55) wrote two highly imaginative texts of cosmic exploration and travel that defy all attempts at classification. Sometimes collectively entitled L’Autre Monde (The Other World), the two novels L’Autre Monde ou Les Estats et Empires de la Lune (The Other World, or the States and Empires of the Moon) and Les Estats et Empires du Soleil (The States and Empires of the Sun)1 have been the object of debate and widely differing interpretations. They have been considered as critical and satirical (Mason), libertine (Chambers, DeJean, Spink), materialist and epicurean (Alcover, Laugaa), and hermetic (Gossiaux, Hutin, Van Vledder). Cyrano has been considered both as an epigone of Campanella and late-­ Renaissance magical thought (Erba, Lerner) and as skeptical and “modern,” anticipating the eighteenth-­ century philosophers (Harth, Prévot,\n\n[1\n\nSpink, Weber).2 Yet Cyrano’s texts transcend all these labels. L’Autre Monde explores other spaces, and are themselves situated elsewhere, in another intellectual and critical space that, with Calle-­Gruber, Philmus, and Suvin, I will take as belonging to the genre of science fiction: according to Ursula Le Guin, science fiction is defined by “its use of new metaphors, drawn from certain great dominants of our contemporary life—science, all the sciences, and technology” (introduction, n.p.). But which science? In Cyrano’s time, the first half of the seventeenth century, this question itself—let alone the answer—would be markedly different from ours. In our time, very specialized scientific fields focus on the many aspects of life and the cosmos: e.g., biology, chemistry, physics—all based on certain commonly accepted quantitative and logical principles born in the seventeenth century: “Science was becoming [in the seventeenth century], and has remained, primarily quantitative. Search for measurable elements among your phenomena, and then search for relations between these measurements” (Whitehead 47). In the early seventeenth century, however, the situation was quite different: rivaling methodologies were available to explore the universe, and they were not so cleanly partitioned into highly specialized domains. In Cyrano’s time, several types of interpretations of the world competed with and influenced each other in rather complicated ways. Modern science, as we know it and recognize it in the works of its ancestors such as Galileo and Descartes, was actively engaged in debates with other alternative systems of thought—such as atomism, animism, ­hermetism—that we cannot truly label as “sciences,” yet which were seen as viable competitors in the intellectual debates of the period. In a French version of this essay, I called Cyrano’s writings, written during this unique period in Western history, not so much science fiction as “savoir fiction” [knowledge fiction]—a phrase impossible to translate into English felicitously. Cyrano’s point of departure in writing these novels was to critique, refute, and mock the traditional religious, Aristotelian, and Church-­promoted scientific beliefs considered orthodox in his day and, in so doing, to satirize the society of his time. His eclectic and completely heterodox thought incorporated other competing paradigms: e.g., the mechanistic and mathematical view proposed by Galileo, Descartes, and Mersenne (still very new in his day); the atomistic explanation defended by Gassendi; and the animist, esoteric, alchemist traditions—very ancient but still continuing to enjoy a widespread popularity during the seventeenth century. From the perspective of the modern reader, the latter traditions may not seem worthy of being placed alongside those of mathematical and mechanistic science—or 2 ] S ylvie Rom anowski\n\neven on par with certain atomistic views—because our modern science considers itself as deriving exclusively from Galileo and Descartes rather than from the alchemists. But, as strange as animism and alchemy may seem today, in the seventeenth century these systems of knowledge were considered as competitors to Cartesian thought, and it was not clear which kind of science would eventually win out. The alchemists and animists were deemed worthy of serious rebuttal by such scientists as Mersenne, Gassendi, and Kepler. In the upheavals of science in the late sixteenth and the early seventeenth centuries, alchemy, animism, and atomism must have seemed both interesting and tempting, without there being much means available through which to discriminate completely and persuasively among them. Even Descartes started out as an animist in his early works such as the Cogitationes Privatae. Frances Yates sums up the situation as follows: Thus in these momentous years when the Renaissance world is cracking and the modern world is rising from its ruins, currents and counter-­currents still running strongly out of the past swirl round the protagonists in the epic struggle, the outlines of which are not as yet clear to the spectators. Mersenne and Descartes were suspected of being Rosicrucians because of their recondite interests. And at the same time and place in which Hermetism is in retreat before the onslaughts of Mersenne . . . Campanella is prophesying at court that the infant Louis XIV will build the Egyptian City of the Sun. (447)3 To a person curious about the science of matter in the early seventeenth century, the “hands-­on” experimental activities carried out by alchemists in their laboratories—filled with retorts, ovens, and water baths, where they were busy burning, condensing, fusing, and crystallizing (Holmyard 43–58)—may well have seemed at least as interesting as the telescope or the microscope. Alchemy declined quickly at the end of the seventeenth century under the twin impacts of Cartesianism and Boyle’s chemistry, but in Cyrano’s time it was still very much alive and was indeed enjoying a last blaze of glory. In the fight against Aristotelian science, the alchemists were the allies of the materialists and other antagonists of Church-­supported science in that they “ran counter to the Church in preferring to seek through knowledge rather than to find through faith” (Holmyard 164). Cyrano found fodder for his attacks on orthodox sciences in all the competing sciences of his day, those new and not so new: “in Cyrano de Bergerac’s view, Descartes and Campanella and others could appear to be travelling companions . . . did they not share in the rejection of a philosophical heritage still firmly implanted in the institution of the school” (Lerner 129). Cyrano was blessed\n\nCyrano de Bergerac’s Epistemological Bodies\n\n[3\n\nwith what Lerner calls a “decidedly ecumenical mind” (129–30) which allowed him widely different points of view—ranging from Pythagoras to Descartes, along with others like Cardan, Campanella, Kepler, and Gassendi. He used these viewpoints in order to provoke his readers into thinking differently about the universe and its inhabitants. The complete sentence from which my title is taken will furnish the entry point into my description of Cyrano’s peculiar enterprise. At the very beginning of his first novel, observing the moon with four companions, the narrator lists several possible descriptions and definitions of the Moon, concluding: “je demeuré gros de mille definitions de Lune dont je ne pouvois accoucher” (I remained pregnant with a thousand definitions of Moon to which I was unable to give birth) (L 359). This statement contains three odd aspects: (1) the narrator is male and pregnant; (2) he has a thousand definitions; (3) he is unable to give birth. The first, a pregnant man, shows a reversal, while the second shows that he is going beyond mere reversals, with no less than a thousand definitions. The third part indicates the inadequacy of language, as he is unable to give birth, to produce one definition, let alone a thousand. This sentence also indicates an important aspect of Cyrano’s vision: the close relationship between the body, knowledge, and statements about knowledge. The narrator’s body and all bodies are intimately involved in the production of intellectual knowledge, for the body is not just a metaphor or a representation, but a knower. It is, in short, an epistemological body. While Cyrano is a convinced materialist, explaining all phenomena by the arrangement and movement of particles and atoms, he is also a seeker of purification and enlightenment that necessitate going beyond matter and into the life of the mind. Preoccupied with knowledge of matter and the nature of knowledge itself, Cyrano unites, in my opinion, two views: the materialism of the atomists and the idealism of the animists and hermetics. As Pol Gossiaux says, Cyrano tries to reconcile “his absolute materialism and his absolute animism” (594), though Gossiaux locates the reconciling image in fire, rather than in the body, fire being the traditional means of purification and place of enlightenment in hermetic science. But Cyrano is radically original in making the body the keystone that holds the composite edifice together, the place of juncture of both the materialist and the hermetic visions. Cyrano’s two novels can be viewed as a persistent effort to mix, even to reconcile, these two philosophies of the universe, the atomistic and the hermetic, without fusing their identities into some single new vision—his attitude being one of joyful inclusion and bold exploration of both the outer and the inner universes.4 4 ] Sylvie Rom anowski\n\nCritics of Cyrano’s texts, however, have tended to emphasize either one or the other aspect. Madeleine Alcover has viewed Cyrano as a materialist, almost eliminating the hermetic side; others, such as Erba, Lerner, Gossiaux, and Van Vledder, have placed him in the esoteric tradition. I believe that it is more faithful to Cyrano’s strange enterprise—as historians of science fiction (Suvin, Philmus, et al.) tend to do when citing him as an early writer in that genre—to assume that he drew on several systems. While the new mechanistic views are given less prominence (despite his defense of heliocentrism at the beginning of Lune and the intervention of Descartes at the end of Soleil), the atomistic-­materialist paradigm is adopted by Cyrano along with the esoteric one. In other words, he sought to consider these two explanations together in a unique worldview that had no equal in his time. Cyrano was choosing systems that were truly unorthodox, exploratory, and highly unconventional—but even more unconventional in that he drew upon these different systems at the same time. These twin aspects, which can be grouped as materialist/bodily, and immaterial/animist, come together in Cyrano who uses and sometimes transforms them to suit his own purposes. With the atomistic view, he refutes the Aristotelian tenets, and with the heliocentric view he refutes geocentrism; but he goes far beyond that new science, which was already dangerously unorthodox. He also develops a vision of the world based on a part of the hermetic tradition, which furnishes him with the exploration of an inner enlightenment, both epistemological and philosophical. This tradition, however, is stripped by Cyrano of any belief in the divine or in a Christian God, though not of belief in the soul. Through such reinterpretations, his doubly imaginative vision gives his works a rich and complex thickness that has not lost its appeal for modern readers. Darko Suvin sums up Cyrano by describing his “charmingly whimsical yoking together of elements from disparate fields” (106). I would differ with the idea that this was “whimsical”: I believe that Cyrano was playing a very serious game, one which Suvin himself says might have cost him his life, surmising that the writer died young in an act of “political murder by clerical enemies” (106). At stake were vast belief systems (e.g., Christian Catholic orthodoxy, cosmology) and questions no less vast, such as the place of humanity in the universe, the existence of an eternal soul, the possibility of an infinite universe, and the foundations of nature. If Cyrano wants to jolt readers out of their orthodoxy and complacency, reversals are an obvious place to start: perhaps the Moon is, as he says, a world like ours, and ours a moon for the Moon. This hypothesis produces great laughter among his companions, to whom he replies that perhaps Moon dwellers are laughing just as hard about us. It is shortly after this\n\nCyrano de Bergerac’s Epistemological Bodies\n\n[5\n\nsentence that he meditates on the thousand definitions of the moon that he is unable to bring forth. Reversals are an easy way to amuse and to unsettle the mind from its usual perspectives, and are used more frequently in Lune than in Soleil. Inanimate objects become animate: books talk (the ancestor of the record player?) and plants talk. Pebbles become soft. Food becomes immaterial, producing no excrement, which might be a definite advantage. Sexual organs are revered as the givers of life instead of being hidden as shameful: one character, a naked man, wears nothing but a belt adorned with bronze likenesses of the male sexual organs, and a scarf sporting a medal with the same image. He explains that sexual organs are to be honored as givers of life, replacing the sword, bringer of death. Besides, such organs bring joy and should not be the object of shame: “Malheureuse contrée où les marques de generation sont ignominieuses et où celles d’aneantissement sont honorables!” (unhappy land, where the insignia of reproduction are shameful, and those of annihilation are honorable) (L 417). In a similar vein, the young are revered more than the old, and the son chastises his father rather than the other way around, for the son represents youthful vigor; and there are even houses and walls that move around with their inhabitants (mobile homes?) in this “monde renversé” (upside-­down world) (L 407). These reversals never fail to amuse, and they carry a subversive charge that is perhaps underestimated in our contemporary era, where multicultural views prevail. In the past, a hierarchized society would be more upset by, say, a carnivalesque reversal of authority and uprisings by the peasants and other lower classes.5 But reversal is not the most original vehicle of Cyrano’s vision of the other world. In Lune and especially in Soleil he uses many other means to imagine and make readers imagine other possibilities of bodily and intellectual existence, and it is to these that I now turn. The multiplicity of new possibilities emphasizes two aspects of body and mind that Cyrano uses with equal effect: first, matter in its many varieties, and second, the immaterial, which is both transparent and lightweight. His novels’ elaborate descriptions of other worlds seem to imply that one can indeed explore and represent other realities. But this knowledge and understanding will be limited—indeed, severely restricted—by fundamental failings in the sensory apparatus of human beings: only five senses, three faculties of the mind, one or two languages at most, and binary logic. All these capacities are hardly adequate for dealing with the multiple, startlingly different worlds encountered elsewhere in the universe. The difficulty is not rooted in a basic partiality or subjectivity, but in the inadequacy of the tools, mental and physical, at one’s disposal. In an age when new 6 ] Sylvie Rom anowski\n\ntechnologies and hands-­on experiments were becoming more widespread, Cyrano seemingly was fascinated not so much by the new science in itself as by the gap it revealed between types of knowledge—the superior power of experimentation over the unassisted senses. Paradoxically, it seems that the increasing ability to know through mechanical devices made the human sensory apparatus seem all the more inadequate, even as knowledge itself was increasing. Humans are confined by five senses: “Il y trop peu de rapport . . . entre vos sens et l’explication de ces misteres,” says Socrates’ Daimon, who goes on to state: “il y a dans l’Univers un million peut-­estre de choses qui pour estre connues demanderoient en nous un million d’organes tous differens” (there is very little relationship between your senses and the explanation of these mysteries; there are in the universe maybe a million things which, in order to be known, would require us to have a million organs, all different from each other) (L 379–80). How can we know these million things, which the Daimon perceives “par les sens qui vous manquent” (by means of the senses you lack) (L 380), if they have to be funneled through a mere five senses?6 Similarly, we are limited by our relatively poor linguistic tools. Not only is the original, matrix language of the world still in existence on the Moon, but trees and cabbages talk, and human language is not limited to the voice or to letters. The whole body talks: “certaines parties du corps signifient un discours tout entier” (certain parts of the body signify an entire discourse) and a finger, a hand, an ear, a lip, an arm, or a cheek can mean a whole sentence, while other parts or actions of the body convey meaning, such as frowns, twitching of muscles, stomping of feet, and contortion of arms. In a kind of balletic dance, the Moon’s inhabitants make all these parts move together so that the whole body is talking: “il ne semble pas d’un homme qui parle, mais d’un corps qui tremble” (it does not appear that a man is talking, but that a body is trembling) (L 381). Add to that the detail that people are “tous nuds” (entirely naked) (381), and a vivid picture emerges. Bodies in action are central to communication. The philosophical basis of this multiple view of the human body is grounded in the atomistic theory of the universe, where all is matter, and all depends only on the arrangement of particles, not on souls or on God: “l’Univers infini n’est composé d’autre chose que de ces atosmes infinis tres solides” (the infinite universe is composed of nothing else but these infinite, very hard atoms) (L 408). Not only is everything a product of chance, but in a curious twist, Cyrano also imagines that everything that could have been but was not created is also a product of chance, so that what might have been is given equal weight with what might not have been: “aussy bien est-­\n\nCyrano de Bergerac’s Epistemological Bodies\n\n[7\n\nil impossible que de ce remuement il ne se fasse quelque chose, et cette chose sera tousjours admirée d’un estourdy qui ne sçaura pas combien peu s’en est fallu qu’elle n’ayst pas esté faicte” (so it is impossible that out of these movements something does not arise, and this thing will be admired by a scatterbrain who will not know that this thing very nearly did not occur) (L 409–10). The culmination of this expanded vision of the world occurs in the description of the multiple and infinite worlds: “il y a des mondes infinis dans un monde infini” (there are infinite worlds in an infinite world) (L 405), for just as we seem to be mites to large animals like elephants, there are mites, “cirons,” to whom we appear to be giants, and these in turn have their own mites. This materialist, atomistic theory of the universe (derived variously from Lucretius and Gassendi, among others) Cyrano elevates to a principle called “cette cironalité universelle” (this universal mitedom) (L 406) in which there is no stable point of reference anywhere. The materialist vision shades into a vision of the profound unity and harmony of the universe, an idea basic to hermetism. The reader thus is prepared for the Daimon’s affirmation that “touttes choses sont vrayes” ([all things are true), that one can “unir phisicquement les veritez de chacque contradictoire” (unite physically the truths in each contradiction) (L 413)—both good hermetic principles—and that one should go beyond contradictions or paradoxes, however sophisticated. Creation is undifferentiated, flattened out, so to speak, without hierarchy, infinitely creative, and deeply harmonious. Matter is the only reality in the world: all the intellectual and mental processes result from the arrangement of atoms, to the exclusion of any other principle. Yet matter seems capable of transcending itself, of generating a soul: “l’ame n’estant que l’action de ces petittes bestes” (the soul being only the action of these little animals) (406). If the body is made up only of matter arranged in such a way as to produce thought, then it seems logical that the transmission of knowledge is also conducted in a material fashion, through bodily contact rather than through teaching or lecturing or reading, especially when it comes to the most prestigious of learned people, philosophers. At the end of Lune, there is a rather startling episode of the epistemological body, in the description of the philosophers’ happy death. When a philosopher feels death approaching, he lets his friends know: they kiss him tenderly on the mouth in a kind of lovemaking among men. He then plunges a dagger into his own heart, and one person after the other sucks his blood from the wound. After everyone is satiated, young girls are brought in, and they all make love, so that “de ces embrassemens il peut naistre quelque chose, ils soient comme asseurés que c’est leur amy qui revit” (from these embraces something may arise, they 8 ] Sylvie Rom anowski\n\nmay be assured as it were that their friend is living again) (L 415). There is even cannibalism: “pendant trois ou quatre jours qu’ils sont à gouster les delices de l’Amour, ils ne sont nourris que de la chair du mort, qu’on leur faict manger toutte crue” (for the three or four days that they are enjoying the delights of love, they are fed only by the flesh of the dead man which they are made to eat raw) (L 415). In this extraordinary passage, all functions of the body are simultaneously put to the service of the transmission of knowledge: kissing, bleeding, death, sex, procreation, and the eating of flesh.7 This passage is also an example of the melding of both the atomistic and the alchemical traditions. According to the first, particles of matter convey knowledge, and in the second tradition, this whole episode is placed under the sign of the Sun, to whom a sacrifice is offered before these proceedings—and let us not forget that the philosopher is a standard representation of the enlightened follower and practitioner of alchemy.8 Given the capacity of the particles of the body to carry knowledge, it is not surprising that if one can arrange one’s particles in exactly the same manner as another person’s being, then one has exactly the same knowledge as that other person. This principle is explained to the narrator of Soleil by Campanella, who serves as his guide in that world: “afin de connoistre vostre interieur, j’arrangeay toutes les parties de mon corps dans un ordre semblable au vostre; car estant de toutes parts situé comme vous, j’excite en moy par cette disposition de matiere, la mesme pensée que produit en vous cette mesme disposition de matiere” (in order to know you from the inside, I arranged all the parts of my body in an order similar to yours; being organized in every way like you, I excite in me, by this organization of matter, the same thought which is produced in you by that same organization of matter) (S 489). This passage has been interpreted (Erba 489, Lerner 126) as an example of Cyrano’s use of physiognomy taken from Campanella: it seems clear, however, that Cyrano reinterprets physiognomy to make of it something much more interior and radical, for Cyrano’s Campanella indicates that he rearranges the disposition of particles within his body, not his outward facial expressions (“j’arrangeay toutes les parties de mon corps”). This may seem odd, but the example that follows stresses the same point: that of twins who, though separated, do the same things in every domain, because “il estoit impossible que la composition des organes de leurs corps estant pareille dans toutes ses circonstances, ils n’operassent d’une façon pareille, puisque deux instrumens égaux touchez également doivent rendre une harmonie égale” (it was impossible that, since the composition of their bodily organs was similar in every fashion, they would not operate in similar fashion, because two equal instruments played in the same way must produce a\n\nCyrano de Bergerac’s Epistemological Bodies\n\n[9\n\nsimilar sound) (S 489). Again, the emphasis here is on the inner restructuring of one’s organs to produce insight. We have come a long way from mere reversals of perspectives and talking trees. In a vision that is materialist but not reductive, Cyrano challenges his readers to imagine a vastly different world from ours, a world where human beings are their bodies—are wholly material—but not in the least unintellectual. But there is more: along with this materialist vision of the human body/intellect, there is yet another vision of what I call immaterial matter, where matter is transparent, light in weight. It is to this vision that I now turn. It is a vision that conveys esoteric meaning, the search for enlightenment, although it never renounces embodiment. This vision, which draws more heavily on hermetic concepts, is developed in Soleil rather than in Lune, as if to provide yet another possibility to the materialist, atomistic option explored principally in Lune. The choice of Campanella (not picked at random by Cyrano as one of the principal officers of the Sun [Lerner 127]) as a mentor for Dyrcona underlines this new point of view: Campanella was known primarily for his knowledge of magic and astrology and as the utopian writer of Civitas Solis. The Sun and the Moon, symbolized by gold and silver, respectively, represent the higher goals of alchemists and other initiates into superior knowledge; of these, the Sun is the highest, the most enlightened and authentic world to which one can aspire. With this emphasis on light, the very old Manichean dichotomy of dark and light, matter and spirit, might reappear—though not without significant modifications in Cyrano’s texts. For on the Sun, there is no perfection: there is opacity, there is death, and in a curious passage I will evoke later, the Beast of Fire, who could be expected to be dominant on the Sun, is killed by the Beast of Cold. Conversely, matter is not hopelessly condemned by Cyrano, as it was in the Manichean tradition. On the whole, however, the narrator’s existence on the Sun, as well as his travel to it, exhibit a lighter, happier state. This new mode of being is foreshadowed in a dream during which, before his second voyage, the narrator ascends towards the sun and feels lighter, delivered from gravity: so much so that he gets agitated and falls out of bed, landing naked on the bare floor with his eyes wide open. When he subsequently makes his real ascent towards the actual Sun, he feels strong, warm, and not at all burnt in the fire, in “le feu (cette poussiere quasi spirituelle)” (fire, this quasi-­spiritual dust) (S 445). He feels emotions of joy, rapture, voluptuousness, and deliverance. To indicate that this knowledge is not pure spirit, but is embodied, he describes his body as becoming exquisitely transparent: “ma veuë . . . passa tout à travers . . . comme si mon corps 10 ] Sylvie Rom anowski\n\nn’eut plus esté qu’un organe de voir, je sentis ma chair, qui, s’estant décrassée de son opacité, transferoit les objets à mes yeux . . .” (my sight went through everything, as if my entire body was only an organ of sight, I felt my flesh, cleansed of its opacity, transferring objects to my eyes) (S 453). “J’estois devenu diafane” (I had become diaphanous) (S 453), but this diaphany includes volume and colors, for he sees all the organs of his body as if in an anatomical illustration: “aucun endroit . . . quoy que transparens, n’avoit perdu sa couleur naturelle; au contraire, mes poulmons conservoient encor sous un rouge incarnat leur mole délicatesse: mon coeur toujours vermeil balançoit aisément entre le sistolle et le diastolle; mon foye sembloit brûler dans un pourpre de feu” (though transparent, no place had lost its natural color; on the contrary my lungs still kept beneath a reddish pink their delicate softness: my ever vermilion heart moved easily between the systole and the diastole; my liver seemed to burn in a bright crimson) (S 453). He has used most of the synonyms for “red” that the French language contains. Besides being the color of blood, red, of course, was the color of the hermetic Philosophers’ Stone. This beautiful, red, glowing and transparent body is the effect of the being in proximity to the sun, and when Dyrcona leaves its immediate vicinity, he becomes more opaque again: proximity to the Sun means enlightenment in all the senses of the word—becoming lit, transparent, and light in weight, as well as enlightened in the mind, in a sense that was increasingly emphasized in the next century. Here, being dense in body also means being dense in mind, and gaining in lightness means gaining understanding. The philosophers again have a privileged status, just as in Lune, but in keeping with the new vision of corporeal transparency, their body is immaterial and their place is in the Sun, the highest principle of light and clarity. Campanella thus explains the special status that philosophers enjoy because their souls are made of finer particles: “une ame de Philosophe est tissuë de parties bien plus deliées” (a philosopher’s soul is woven with much finer particles) (S 492), and hence, philosophers can be the Sun’s principal inhabitants. He explains that there are three kinds of spirits: “les plus grossiers” (the coarsest) who merely repair holes in the Sun’s girth, the “subtils” (subtle) who belong in the Sun’s rays, and the best, the spirits of the philosophers: “mais ceux des Philosophes . . . arrivent tout entiers à la sphere du jour pour en estre habitans” (but those of philosophers arrive whole to the day-­sphere in order to live there) (S 493). They do so by a principle of resemblance, of light going to light, with an exceptional philosopher such as Epicurus having the extraordinary privilege of arriving in the Sun complete\n\nCyrano de Bergerac’s Epistemological Bodies\n\n[ 11\n\nwith body and soul together: “Epicure dans le Soleil est le mesme Epicure qui vivoit jadis sur la Terre” (Epicurus in the Sun is that same Epicurus who used to live on Earth) (S 493). Alcover finds it troubling that the philosophers’ souls are superior to other souls and explains this in terms of the hermetic tradition.9 The possibility of enlightenment in the Sun, emphasizing the soul’s ascent toward light, is only the culmination of many other esoteric aspects and allusions to the hermetic tradition. As Philmus says, “there is a great deal of internal evidence that occult traditions inspired Cyrano’s manner of concealing his theories in myth and allegory,” and his work demonstrates “a conversance with the doctrines of alchemy” (129). Chambers, Gossiaux, Spink, and especially Erba and Van Vledder, have analyzed many of these aspects that I will not reiterate here. In my conclusion, I will return to the matter of Cyrano’s use of these and other views of the universe.10 In Cyrano’s novels, however, souls are accompanied by bodies—for Cyrano yokes together several systems of thought, obviously refusing to be confined by one system alone. Furthermore, even on the Sun there are not only transparency and lightness, but degrees of these qualities, “car le Lecteur sçaura que toutes les contrées n’en sont pas diafanes, il y en a qui sont obscures, comme celles de nostre Monde” (the reader will note that all regions are not transparent: there are obscure ones like the ones in our world) (S 500). Nothing is pure: even the province of philosophers is not exempt from opacity, but this opacity can be conquered by an effort of the will: “nous pouvons toutefois par une vigoureuse contention de la volonté, nous rendre diafanes lors qu’il nous en prend envie” (by a vigorous exercise of our will, we can, however, become transparent when we feel like it) (S 501). The embodiment of knowledge and the spiritualization of matter constantly coexist on Cyrano’s Sun, where opacity is in fact necessary and never renounced. According to Ross Chambers: “To the question: is imagination material or spiritual? Cyrano does not decide” (“L’Autre Monde ou le mythe” 42). I would rather say that Cyrano sees a constant double interaction of the body on the spirit and of the immaterial on the material, the purification of the spirit from the body coexisting with the embodiment of ideas.11 There is a contrast between the Sun and the Moon: in the Sun’s domain, there exists a hierarchy, and matter can be transparent and weightless: on the Moon, there is no hierarchy, and materiality of thought is transmitted through blood, flesh, and sperm. Cyrano has imagined not one, but two universes, different from each other and radically different from our perceptions of the earthly mode of being. That he needed not one but two visions indicates the fecundity and generosity of his imagination, and also the dif12 ] S ylvie Rom anowski\n\nficulty of stepping out of our usual habits of mind. As Maurice Laugaa says in his introduction to Lune, Cyrano “tries to reverse the Christian principle of an order based on irreducible differences among various parts of creation, but at the same time he must allow for slippage between these differences, for an expansion of the text provided by the cosmic theories of his time” (24).12 At the center of both visions is a meditation on the relation between the body and knowledge, a body that is more consistent than the “corps humoral” (body made up of humors) of Montaigne, more unified than Descartes’ double vision of the extended body and the immaterial mind. Perhaps Cyrano’s is the most modern, if one thinks of modern conceptions of the human being as stepping away from the division between body and soul toward a view of human beings as holistic; the physical and the mental intertwine in still imperfectly understood ways. In concluding, I will refer back to my title and its source in Cyrano’s emblematic sentence, “dont je ne pouvois accoucher” (to which I was unable to give birth), which suggests the difficulty not only of attaining enlightenment, but of expressing new visions of the body and of the universe. Bringing forth is, of course, what Cyrano does in these books; hence there is an aspect of self-­referentiality that is layered on top of the philosophical visions he gives us. The knowing body brings forth a text that comments on its own coming into the world. This is done by an overt reference to his own work: in Lune, Socrates’ Daimon says to the narrator that he esteems very much a book, which we will read in the future, after Lune, entitled Les Estats et Empires du Soleil, which he says is nothing less than “le ‘Grand Œuvre des Philosophes,’ qu’un des plus forts esprits du Soleil a composé” (the “Great Work of the Philosophers” written by one of the very best minds on the Sun) (L 413). Here Cyrano counts himself among the best philosophers, and a reference to these people can be taken as a self-­reference. It is also one of the clearest indications that Cyrano is placing his work in the tradition of hermetism: “Grand Œuvre” was the name given in practical alchemy to the transmutation of metals into gold, and in mystical alchemy to the personal purification and spiritual knowledge gained by the hermetist.13 It is not surprising that philosophers, who represent hermetic initiation, occupy a special position in these books: they are either bodies transmitting knowledge through various solids and fluids (in Lune), or bodies of light floating into the Sun’s rays (in Soleil). Such self-­references become self-­glorifying and very gratifying to the narrator, who is happy to learn that philosophers’ souls dwell in such high places. But there are also indications that such enlightenment is difficult both to obtain and to sustain. In\n\nCyrano de Bergerac’s Epistemological Bodies\n\n[ 13\n\nSoleil, there are threats to enlightenment, one of the most significant being the battle between the Beast of Cold and the Beast of Fire, a salamander. One would expect the Beast of Fire to win, in good alchemist tradition, for fire is the superior and basic force of transmutation of base metals into silver and gold. But the Beast of Fire is vanquished and “le cœur de la pauvre Salemandre, où tout le reste de son ardeur s’estoit concentrée, en se crévant, fit un éclat si épouvantable, que je ne sçay rien dans la Nature pour le comparer” (the poor salamander’s heart, where all its remaining strength had gathered, burst and in so doing made such a horrible noise that I can’t compare it to anything in nature) (S 491). Heat and light are the losers here, and the magnitude of such a defeat is underlined by the narrator’s incapacity to find a suitable comparison: it is no less than the incapacity of a being to achieve enlightenment, the falling back into base, dark, and cold matter. This is a catastrophe of monumental proportions for the universe, yet it does not dampen the enthusiasm of Dyrcona as he becomes more and more enlightened in body and in soul on the Sun. If we remember, however, the context of this event, another signification emerges: for the trees, feeling threatened by fire, had called upon the Beast of Cold to save their precious lives—these oaks, the descendants of Greek oaks, have inherited the gifts of prophecy, speech, and divination (S 478–79). Thus the defeat of the Beast of Fire, even on the Sun, perhaps especially there, is a good thing for these oaks and for the transmission of their knowledge to the narrator and hence to the human race—as the oak says to Dyrcona: “je croy parler, en vous parlant, à tout le Genre Humain” (when I speak with you, I believe that I am speaking to the whole human race) (479).14 The fragility of the transmission of accumulated knowledge is such that only the very sharpest ear can hear the murmur of the trees and their mysterious speech, but the very embodiment of learning also assures its transmission to future human beings. Cyrano’s identity is multiple: as satirist, as polemicist, and as defender of libertinism, materialism, heliocentrism, and hermetism. Such an enterprise relies on the power of the imagination that can be fully expressed only in fiction. In the unique situation of the early seventeenth century, he straddled two principal worlds: that of the soon-­to-­be-­outmoded late-­Renaissance hermetism, and that of the new mechanical, mathematical science. And like proponents of both those views, he fought the traditional Aristotelian view. J. S. Spink sums up the Cyranian vision as “a wider synthesis . . . between the panpsychism of Italians such as Campanella and the atomistic materialism of Lucretius as revised by Gassendi” (“Form” 150). Campanella is a late-­Renaissance figure rather than one belonging to modern science, though he was in touch with modern developments and was an admirer 14 ] Sylvie Rom anowski\n\nand defender of Galileo. For Cyrano, Campanella was an attractive figure still belonging to the “late Renaissance magical/astral view of the physical world” that contrasts with the new, “modern empirical/mathematical view” of Galileo (Headley 179). In short, through his choice of Campanella, and all the allusions to hermetic authors, Cyrano shows that he does not yet adhere to the thoroughly modern camp, for “to those with whom the future lay . . . to Mersenne, Descartes . . . Campanella meant nothing” (Yates 396). Cyrano also presents Descartes as the other great mentor on the Sun, and it was a volume of Descartes’ Physics that lands Dyrcona in prison at the beginning of Soleil (S 432). Again, Cyrano is making two visions coexist, and even interact. Campanella praises Descartes and is happy to welcome him to the Sun; in reality, Descartes was quite contemptuous of Campanella. It is this inclusivity that marks Cyrano’s attitude as quite different from the other reactions to science prevalent in this unique period. He did not align himself exclusively with either of the anti-­Aristotelian views, nor did he experience a sense of loss and anguish at the breaking apart of the old world—an anguish that appears in authors such as John Donne and Pascal, and which has been studied by Koyré and Nicolson.15 It is important not only to examine the details of Cyrano’s vision, but also to explore its multiple sources insofar as they indicate his adherence to both materialism and hermetism, the two main and opposing visions on which he drew. I believe that the answer lies not in identifying Cyrano as an adept of either view, but as a writer of literature. Erba says it well: “the fortunate encounter of Cyrano with magic is defined and clarified under the banner of literature” (66); that is, as Erba explains, Cyrano’s work represents a “personal reworking” situated in literature that seems be more a “work of ‘literature on literature’ than a deep excavation and in-­depth exploration of the living substance of the hermetic materials themselves” (59; Erba’s emphasis). I believe that what Erba says about hermetism also holds true for Cyrano’s other sources of inspiration. Cyrano’s work is truly a work of fiction, of imagination based on scientific views—as Suvin, Le Guin, and Philmus all agree—but one reveling in absolute freedom, freedom to wonder. And it is only by considering him within this framework that no injustice is done to this writer’s complex sf work.16 Beyond Cyrano’s yoking together of wildly different visions, there is, however, as I have tried to show, a guiding thread: to put it simply, knowledge matters. I take this in two ways, stretching the syntax of that phrase: knowledge is important, and knowledge is embedded in matter, in the material body. First, knowledge is not mere curiosity, and even goes beyond being an intellectual quest (Philmus 131; Chambers “ ‘L’Autre Monde’ ou\n\nCyrano de Bergerac’s Epistemological Bodies\n\n[ 15\n\nle mythe” 29), for it has an impact on conduct and human life and history. Second, Cyrano’s two views of the body—of a solid, material body, and an immaterial, translucent and crimson body—both stress self-­knowledge and knowledge of the universe of which they are a part: they both are epistemological bodies. For Cyrano requires two books to challenge the traditional, Christian, Aristotelian concepts. In both visions, the division between body and soul, matter and spirit, is undermined in favor of other corporeal visions: a body of material atoms and a body of light. Both visions, though apparently divergent, meet in a common view that there are no divisive boundaries between knowledge and body. Cyrano’s works are an optimistic, syncretic enterprise focused on the material body, but one which also glorifies the imagination: although he suggested that our five bodily senses were inadequate tools for understanding the universe, he affirms the power of our imagination to overcome these limitations, to transcend both the body and received knowledge. At the heart of any new vision, he says, our bodies must be at the center: imagine a new body, he says, and you will be able to imagine new knowledge.\n\nAppendix Since these novels may not be familiar to many readers, I will summarize briefly their content. In Les Estats et Empires de la Lune (The States and Empires of the Moon), his first novel, the unnamed narrator wants to visit the moon, to prove that it is an inhabited world. He devises a machine using many bottles filled with dew to lift him up, but he succeeds only in landing in New France (Canada), where he meets with the governor and discusses such topics as heliocentrism, the earth’s rotation, the plurality of worlds, etc. On the twenty-­fourth of June, on the feast of “la Saint-­Jean” (Saint-­ Jean-­Baptiste, still celebrated in Québec), a bonfire lifts him in a better machine powered this time by rockets, taking him to an earthly Paradise, where he meets the prophets Elijah and Enoch. As the narrator is expelled from Paradise after an impious outburst, and as he plunges into the darkest night toward the Moon, he steals an apple from the tree of knowledge. Now on the Moon, he first meets Socrates’ Daimon, “le Demon de Socrate” (L 377), and then is taken to the court, where he is thought to be a pet animal. Put on trial in order to determine his true nature, the narrator is first found to be a bird, then a man, and for this latter offense, he is condemned to make a public apology. He then goes to the home of the Daimon’s host, and discourses with two university professors and the young son of the host on an extremely wide range of scientific, moral, and philosophical topics: the respect due to old people, the thinking and talking life of plants, the 16 ] Sylvie Rom anowski\n\neternity of the universe, the role of chance, the burial practices of the lunar people, and praise of sexuality. With the son of the host, who remains unnamed, he embarks on a series of increasingly bold refutations of many standard Christian beliefs: he refutes the immortality of the soul, the existence of miracles, the spiritual nature of the soul, the resurrection of the body, and finally the existence of God. Upon this last declaration of atheism, the devil himself appears to cart off the young son to hell, and the narrator decides to accompany him in order to regain Earth on the devil’s way to the underworld, landing in Italy. The second book, Les Estats et Empires du Soleil (The States and Empires of the Sun), picks up where the first left off: the narrator returns to France and is taken care of by two noblemen. The narrator is also named Dyrcona (taken to be an anagram of Cyrano). His tales of his sojourn in the Moon have attracted enemies, but even more dangerous than his tales is Descartes’ Physics, discovered in his belongings. Thrown into prison in Toulouse, Dyrcona escapes, then is recaptured and thrown into a worse dungeon, from which he is liberated upon the noblemen’s orders. They decide that he be held in a tower. There Dyrcona constructs a complicated machine that enables him to be aspirated upward and reach the vicinity of the Sun. Landing first on a solar macula or sun cloud, he encounters a small, naked man who, speaking in what he says is the perfectly clear, original language of the world, explains the history of the Earth, and the three principal faculties of the soul. After a longer voyage of twenty-­two months, Dyrcona finally arrives on the Sun, where he encounters several strange beings. In a dark region, he meets fantastic creatures: a golden tree, a talking nightingale, fruits that fall from the trees and transform themselves into little men, who then unite together to form one young man. After arriving in the kingdom of the birds, Dyrcona is made prisoner by the birds, who put him on trial for being human and condemn him to die by being eaten by flies; he is saved at the last moment by Cesar, his parrot: Dyrcona had set him free and he now repays the favor. In a forest, Dyrcona listens to talking oak trees who tell him stories of legendary people in love. Finally, arriving in an open field, Dyrcona witnesses the combat of the Beast of Fire against the Beast of Cold, and he meets the philosopher Campanella, who discusses with him such topics as the souls of philosophers, the three kinds of minds, the five rivers of the senses, and the philosophers’ various degrees of enlightenment. A man and woman burst onto the scene, the woman demanding justice against her husband for not making love to her frequently enough. The woman, originally from the kingdom of Truth, now prefers to reside in the kingdom of Lovers, and she explains her preference for the\n\nCyrano de Bergerac’s Epistemological Bodies\n\n[ 17\n\nkingdom of Lovers. As Descartes arrives, the novel breaks off, presumably having been interrupted by Cyrano’s death.17 Notes\n\n1. A shorter version of this article was presented at the Kentucky Foreign Language Conference in April 1997. For a summary of these novels, please see the Appendix at the conclusion of this article. For the sake of brevity, I will refer to the first novel as Lune and the second one as Soleil, abbreviated as L and S (page references are to the Prévot edition). I furnish the original French version only for Cyrano, and translations for other materials. All translations are my own. 2. The division between critics affirming his materialism and those who interpret his work as a mythic quest based on alchemy is well represented by Ross Chambers’s “ ‘L’Autre Monde’ ou le mythe du libertin” and the sharp rebuttal of that article by Madeleine Alcover in “Le mythe de M. Ross Chambers.” While defending Cyrano’s materialism, Alcover does, however, have recourse to a promethean myth in an article of her own, “Cyrano de Bergerac et le feu.” I find myself wanting to agree with both these readers, approving Chambers’s reference to the hermetic quest and keeping Alcover’s vision of materiality, but including it even in the most spiritual world. 3. This interpretation differs somewhat in emphasizing competition among several possible sciences, from Chambers’ suggestion that there was a “conflict between new certainties and ancient convictions” (“ ‘L’Autre Monde’ ou le mythe” 34). The only science that seemed ancient was that of Aristotle, and it was no longer persuasive for people such as Cyrano. 4. This statement represents my one disagreement with Joan DeJean’s analysis of Cyrano: she maintains that “libertine heroes are alienated from their bodies” and “view them as objects with an independent existence” (Libertine Strategies 143). Yet she too discusses the significance of the extraordinary passage of Dyrcona’s transparent body, which I will discuss later in this essay. It is precisely the body’s “independent existence” which enables it to be an epistemological body. In the light of recent studies of the body, and of homosexuality, the embodiment of Cyrano’s ideas seems evident and interesting; see Albert-­Galtier’s suggestive article on homosexuality as one element of Cyrano’s liberation from various orthodoxies. 5. See Christian Barbe’s analysis on the dangers represented by subversion. 6. Chambers analyzes the problem of the intermixture between senses, imagination, and the cosmos, and notes that Cyrano’s position is that “human consciousness should grapple with phenomena which are alien to it,” in “ ‘Que diray-­je de ce miroir fluide . . .’” (124). But Cyrano is not alienated from the world because his whole being, body and mind, participate in and are transformed by all phenomena. 7. Alcover has noted the homosexuality here, and Albert-­Galtier gives an interpretation of this passage that emphasizes the homosexuality of the philosopher and his lover; I believe that other bodily functions are included, as well as heterosexual love, but I agree with him that “the lover’s body is above all the body of knowledge” (326). 8. The alchemists called themselves “philosophers” and their goal, the magic sub18 ] Sylvie Rom anowski\n\nstance that would change baser materials to gold, the “Philosophers’ Stone” (Holmyard 15). Transmitting the philosopher’s spirit through his blood derives both from animist and materialist ideas. 9. Her statement makes it clear that she does this reluctantly: “And so we resort to the hermetic tradition to give meaning to the privilege of the Wise men” (Pensée philosophique 133). She does not consider Cyrano’s work to be defined by occult or alchemist sciences, though she grants that he may have derived some inspiration from some alchemical practices (Pensée philosophique 147). 10. A detail not discussed by these critics is the reference to formation by heating, for example, the formation of the earth by three successive cookings (“coction”) by the Sun, followed by the formation of man also by three cookings (S 449–50), and the formation of the perfect seed also by the same process (S 485). 11. Here I disagree with Erba, who talks of Dyrcona becoming pure spirit (57) as he rises (not to the stars, as Erba says, but to the Sun). There is never anything pure in Cyrano. 12. What Laugaa sees in Cyrano is extended to the entire cast of libertine writers by Joan DeJean in her Libertine Strategies, where she successfully refutes any attempt to enclose those writers in a simple category, basing her arguments on their deliberate attempts at escaping definition and identification. 13. Alcover also disputes the reference to “Estats et Empires du Soleil” as a reference to Cyrano’s own future work, seeing it rather as a reference to Campanella. But the words are exactly Cyrano’s words for his work, so it is a type of amusing “flash forward” that is entirely in keeping with Cyrano’s self-­referentiality. She also disputes that the words “Grand Œuvre” are a title; she rejects the possibility of a hermetic reference, or of a reference to Campanella, but sees rather a possible reference to the work of Giordano Bruno. I believe that the words themselves, “grand œuvre,” even if uncapitalized in all sources, were a stock phrase that would immediately have been recognized as referring to the alchemists’ work. 14. Vledder sees the fight between the two beasts as having an alchemical meaning, symbolizing the fight between flame and air, and earth and water (61). But the salamander is defeated, which Gossiaux interprets as showing Cyrano’s “dismay and anxiety” (598)—too negative an interpretation, in my opinion. 15. I thank John Woodward, who drew my attention to Nicolson and to the quotation from Donne’s “First Anniversary”: “ ’Tis all in peeces, all cohaerance gone” (l.214; in Nicolson 120). 16. Other critics who emphasize Cyrano’s “advocacy of freedom” (Harry 207) of the imagination, rather than his construction of a cosmological or philosophical system, are Chambers, Gauthier, and Sick, though Harry reproaches Cyrano for not having offered a “viable alternative” (208) and for wanting only “to deconstruct, to desystematize” (209). Cyrano is more positive and syncretic than destructive. As Sick says, Cyrano is interested in the sciences for the new spaces they can open up, rather than for the sciences’ contents themselves (68). 17. Gossiaux speculates that Cyrano had planned to write a third, concluding novel entitled “Histoire de l’Estincelle” [History of the Spark] mentioned in one of the\n\nCyrano de Bergerac’s Epistemological Bodies\n\n[ 19\n\noriginal editions, which would have furnished “the key to Cyrano’s ontology” (595). This “spark” is very likely a reference to the alchemists’ belief that there is a spark of light entombed in the matter of our bodies that must be liberated and returned to the source, the sun. In this aspect the alchemists and the Manicheists are on common ground, so to speak, in opposing matter and spirit, dark and light. Whether we would have had a Cyranian “ontology” remains unknowable, since Cyrano’s work was unfinished, remaining, tragically and ironically, forever “pregnant with a thousand ­possibilities.”\n\nEditions of Cyrano’s Works\n\nBergerac, Cyrano de.

Rereading it in preparation for this piece, I was impressed that the passage of time has done nothing to diminish its persuasiveness. Like most readers, my first encounter 22 ] Sylvie Rom anowski\n\nwith Cyrano had not been with the author but with Edmond Rostand’s fictional hero. When I went up to Oxford as an undergraduate, I had looked for Cyrano in the Bodleian library out of idle curiosity, and finding him listed as author, rather than subject, was electrifying. I read the first text listed—the illustrated Folio edition entitled Voyages to the Moon and Sun (Richard Aldington’s translation illustrated with verve and charm by Quentin Blake)—and a lifelong obsession took root. When I returned to the university as a postgrad it was to look at Cyrano’s writing in the context of a thesis on the links between literature and the history of science. For anyone interested in Cyrano’s work, the highlight of recent years has to be the 2004 publication of Madeleine Alcover’s fully annotated edition of Les États et Empires de la Lune et du Soleil for Honoré Champion. Finally, Cyrano’s delirious, fantastical science fiction writing, the jewel of his varied oeuvre, had the scholarly edition it deserved. It only took three and a half centuries. A year later, the 350th anniversary of his death, saw a wealth of celebratory events, including a fascinating International Cyrano conference in Sannois, the Parisian suburb where he died. My own much humbler contribution appeared in 2008, and writing this afterword today is not just a pleasure but also rather apt, since my book, Cyrano: The Life and Legend of Cyrano de Bergerac, was a historiographical study of Cyrano’s afterlives, intended to bring the real Cyrano back to the attention of the everyday reader. Fecund with inspiration at the sight of the full moon and yet frustrated in his urge to utter the “thousand definitions” that occur to him, Cyrano’s narrator offers a vision of the anxiety of authorship, as well as a metaphor for the curious afterlife of the writer himself. The tremendous success of Edmond Rostand’s play Cyrano de Bergerac owes a significant debt to his close reading of Cyrano’s works, the science fiction in particular, as well as to a shared fascination with trickery and truth telling. Cyrano’s prose gains much of its impetus from his febrile metafictional experimentation. It is ironic that the culmination of his inventive, personal mythmaking was to be the blotting out of the man behind the shadow of his own fictional representation; a typically Cyranien paradox. Elucidating Cyrano’s biography, unraveling his life and legend, revealed the man to be as paradoxical as his writing. Cyrano eludes definition both as a writer and as a man, and the strength of Dr. Romanowski’s vision of Cyrano’s epistemology is that she wisely resisted the temptation to impose reductive limits onto Cyranien multiplicity. Her respect for the irrepressible inventiveness and innovation in Cyrano’s work is key. Furthermore, her characterization of his science fiction writing as more accurately “savoir fiction” signposts yet another paradox of Cyrano’s provocative creativity. His fascination with knowledge and knowing was often expressed through a focus on ignorance. He always placed great emphasis on the limits of the human perspective. In the voyages to the other worlds of the Moon and Sun, his imaginative, satirical vision of superior alien beings consistently underlines the myriad ways in which human knowledge is paltry, partial, and problematic. Cyrano’s science fiction masterpiece conjures up an imaginative space outside the realms of human knowability, in order to play with the “thousand definitions” inspired by the new cosmology. He also foreshadowed the ways in which modern cosmology has come to rely on the techniques of literature for an understanding of the universe.\n\nCyrano de Bergerac’s Epistemological Bodies\n\n[ 23\n\nPhysicists from Einstein to Stephen Hawking use metaphor to expand the reaches of human understanding beyond the range of mechanical observation. The Higgs boson was a persuasive idea long before it was an observable fact. Paradoxically, Cyrano’s genius was to attempt this technique (a throwback to modern science’s origins as natural philosophy, in which fiction frequently took precedence over observation) and to make of it an epistemological strategy of the future.\n\n24 ] Sylvie Rom anowski\n\n• 2•\n\nSamuel Madden’s Memoirs of\n\nthe Twentieth Century Paul K. Alkon\n\nA strong candidate for literary history’s first work of futuristic fiction is Samuel Madden’s Memoirs of the Twentieth Century (1733), a satire about documents that are supposedly transported back in time from the twentieth century to the eighteenth century. Although Madden’s narrative is notable as one of the earliest examples of the sf subgenre of time travel, within a few decades such tales of the future would increasingly become commonplace in France and England, including Louis Sébastien Mercier’s highly influential 1771 utopia L’An 2440 (The Year 2440). This essay originally appeared in SFS 12, no. 2 (July 1985): 184–201.\n\nThe impossibility of writing stories about the future was so widely taken for granted until the eighteenth century that only two earlier anticipations are known: Frances Cheynell’s six-­page pamphlet of political propaganda set in a very near future, Aulicus his dream of the Kings sudden comming to London (1644); and Jacques Guttin’s heroic romance Epigone, histoire du siècle futur (1659).1 Before their publication, the future was reserved in Western literature for prophets, astrologers, and practitioners of deliberative rhetoric. As a trope for madness, John Donne could use the proverbial castigation Chronica de futuro scribet: “He undertakes to write a Chronicle of things before they are done, which is an irregular, and a perverse way” (2:77). The first English book to discard this aversion to chronicling the future is Samuel Madden’s Memoirs of the Twentieth Century. Perhaps in deference to the taboo against tales of the future, it was published anonymously\n\n[ 25\n\nin 1733, and then immediately suppressed by its author, an Irish Anglican clergyman who destroyed almost all copies of his extraordinary work as soon as they came from the press.2 Consequently Memoirs of the Twentieth Century had no apparent impact on later eighteenth-­century fiction. Nor has it figured even in histories of sf as anything more than one of those legendary works that are duly mentioned but which nobody discusses in any detail. It has been ignored partly because it is satire, not sf or any kind of serious extrapolation to a possible real future, and partly because copies, even of a Garland Press reprint, are very scarce.3 Memoirs of the Twentieth Century, however, provides excellent evidence about the origins of science fiction. Madden found a new way of distancing narrative setting from the targets of satire. Seven years earlier Gulliver’s Travels had used distance in space. Memoirs of the Twentieth Century uses time. No previous English writer had done so. Even Epigone, though it includes satiric as well as utopian passages and resorts to a putative future by way of augmenting the remoteness favored as a locus for adventure in heroic romances, is not set in a chronologically specified future. Because it is more like an alternative history, Epigone could hardly have served as a pattern for Memoirs of the Twentieth Century. Nor is there any evidence that Madden knew of Guttin’s book. Madden deserves great credit for originality. Unfortunately he was not up to sustained exploitation of his innovative future setting. It should also immediately be said, to avoid a misunderstanding of my argument, that although Madden wrote anticipatory satire, not predictive fiction, and should be judged accordingly, Memoirs of the Twentieth Century is by any criterion known to me failed satire. There are passages reminiscent of Swift at his best. But Madden’s few palpable hits lose their force in a welter of tiresome religious satire and other incoherent attacks that miss their mark or hit their target too bluntly. Moreover, the tone frequently wavers between satiric and utopian in ways that make it unclear whether some passages are satirically or prescriptively intended. Without making any brief for Memoirs of the Twentieth Century as a neglected masterpiece, then, I do want to suggest that despite his failure to write a coherent anticipatory satire, or for that matter a work that we would call sf, Madden nevertheless created a viable form in the shape of a tale of the future that could work perfectly well as a framework for futuristic fiction in any of its modes. I shall suggest, too, that by examining the self-­reflexive comments which Madden includes within Memoirs of the Twentieth Century, we find important evidence of how literary conventions and social change interacted in eighteenth-­century culture to provide a cli26 ]\n\nPau l K . A lkon\n\nmate of opinion that at last allowed writers to cast aside the ancient prejudice against tales of the future. Finally, I shall argue that although Madden failed as a satirist, he makes a respectable showing as a critic by providing an explanation that may still go far to account for the way sf and related forms can present narratives of imaginary history—usually but not invariably future history—that are often most powerful when they run most strongly counter to our intuitive canons of probability. Memoirs of the Twentieth Century is described by its subtitle as “Original Letters of State, Under George the Sixth: Relating to the most important Events in Great Britain and Europe . . . from the Middle of the Eighteenth, to the End of the Twentieth Century and the World. Received and Revealed in the Year 1728; and now Published . . . in Six Volumes.” There were no sequels to volume one, nor were any intended. Allusion to five more volumes satirizes long-­winded memoirs. Classification as letters of state would have prevented eighteenth-­century readers from expecting even in satiric form an account of the private life of some individual, and would thus have excused in advance any lack of that suspense created by arousing curiosity about the fate of a protagonist. The closest approach to a fully realized character is the nameless narrator of three bizarre “prefaces” that cannot be taken as straightforward statements from the anonymous real author. Given the novelty and, according to conventional wisdom, the evident absurdity of such future records as the subtitle promises, eighteenth-­century readers would have registered at first glance the book’s satiric intention. They would accordingly have taken its allusion to revelations concerning the end of the world as satire aimed at millenarian prediction.4 Laughter at such targets is sustained and directed also at those who cling to belief in guardian angels, when early in the book’s first preface its narrator explains that he received the ensuing letters from his guardian angel on the evening of January 20, 1728. He claims no credit for prophecy but only for the hard work of translating each letter from “the English that will be spoke in the XXth Century” (5). Although primarily a satiric entry in controversies over the existence of guardian angels, Madden’s resort to the fiction of documents transported backward through time is as viable as H. G. Wells’s conceit of a time machine that in defiance of the laws of physics carries his narrator forward on a tour of the future. By 1895 it was easier to suspend disbelief in any sort of machine, however impossible it might be in the real world. Even today, as every critic of sf is bound to remark, the genre makes ample use of such convenient impossibilities as faster-­than-­ light space travel. Only a small part of sf confines itself to situations that accord exactly with scientific canons of possibility. Though guardian angels Madden’s Memoirs of the Twentieth Century\n\n[ 27\n\nwould now relegate a narrative to the realms of fantasy rather than sf, the situation was less clear-­cut in 1733. Belief in guardian angels was waning and under attack. They were nevertheless still defended by some as part of a scientifically correct—because theologically accurate—picture of the universe as it really is.5 The lines between theology, superstition, and science were being redrawn in a way that allowed the idea of a guardian angel with documents from the future to be used as a narrative framework and also as a vehicle of satire that by various means, especially a lengthy mock defense of belief in such spirits, ridicules those who take them seriously. At the start of that mock defense, and thus very prominently, Madden includes one of his few hints of a possible model for Memoirs of the Twentieth Century by referring ambiguously to the irrelevance for that defense of allusions to “Kircher’s good Genius, who carried him through the Planets in his Iter Extaticum” (225). Madden thus invites readers to take his book, despite its odd format, as merely an acceptable comic variation on a familiar literary device. After the hint has been dropped, it is easy enough to regard documents brought by the narrator’s guardian angel as in effect equivalent to the tour of our solar system provided in 1656 by Athanasius Kircher for his protagonist in the Itinerarium Extaticum. Again Madden substitutes time for space. An angel provides access to the future just as an angel had provided access to space. Madden’s variation of Kircher’s idea deserves credit for seizing on the possibility of a kind of time travel instead of following what was, as Marjorie Nicolson has shown, an already trite convention of spatial journeys on or off the Earth. It would be stretching our generosity to praise Madden for being the first to show a traveler arriving from the future, although what the narrator’s guardian angel does in appearing one evening in 1728 to hand over twentieth-­century documents makes me think of such tales as Robert Silverberg’s The Masks of Time (1968). Madden is, however, to my knowledge the first to write a narrative that purports to be a document from the future. He deserves recognition as the first to toy with the rich idea of time travel in the form of an artifact sent backward from the future to be discovered in the present. This too is an original variation on a familiar literary tradition: the discovery and interpretation of some ancient document (an artifact from the remote past) containing political or other prophecy. This convention had been used both seriously and satirically. In eighteenth-­century England satiric applications prevailed, as in Swift’s Windsor Prophecy (1711) and Samuel Johnson’s Marmor Norfolciense (1739). Madden’s artifact from the twentieth century is a series of letters to the British “Lord High Treasurer” from English ambassadors in Turkey, Rome, 28 ]\n\nPau l K . A lkon\n\nParis, and Moscow, together with a few replies sent from the English foreign office. The first letter is from “Constantinople, Nov. 3, 1997.” The last letter is dated “May 1, 1998.” Each ambassador sketches local conditions in the late 1990s and on one pretext or another also gives some outline of events from the 1940s onward in the country where he is stationed. In a report from France in 1997, for example, the English ambassador tells of current quarrels between Louis XIX and Rome, then sketches by way of background the earlier loss of French conquests resulting in a situation where “the Pope is now the entire Object of the fears of Europe, instead of the conquering French” (78). This letter also describes internal problems plaguing a militarily weak France whose people are poorly governed, overtaxed, and suffering from a situation in which “the Luxury of the Nobility and Gentry is increas’d beyond all Bounds, as if they were not only insensible of, but even rejoyc’d in the publick Calamities of their Fellow-­Subjects” (85). Such passages partly reflect Madden’s view of France as it was in his own day, and partly display the rather tediously elaborated fantasies of a British patriot and Protestant whose most ignominious biases against the French and all Roman Catholics are indulged in ways that need not further concern this essay. In a lighter vein, Madden often attempts to satirize perennial human dilemmas by means of obviously absurd fantasies of progress. Thus in response to reports of medical reforms in the Russia of 1998, an English foreign-­office official writes to the British ambassador in Moscow reporting that English physicians have at last found a cure for violent love: “now whenever people find their passion is unsuccessful and desperate, without hanging or drowning, shooting or poisoning, which was the usual method, they calmly send for Dr. Howard, who immediately puts them into the Love-­course, as they call it, and so they get rid of it at once, and then very quietly go about their affairs; and as soon as they have recover’d from the cure, (which, as in most other cases, generally takes up as much time as the distemper) they chuse a more proper, or at least a less cruel person for their adorations” (431). Several correspondents also allude to much earlier British history, going as far back as the mid-­eighteenth century, thereby providing readers in 1733 with glimpses of more immediate possibilities. References to the close future are most often in the mode of prescriptive satire, as when a correspondent remarks with approval how eighteenth-­ century kings “peremptorily drove the Italian Opera and Music twice from Great Britain, and forbid their acting . . . as enervating our Spirits, and emasculating the British Genius” (138). The moral of this bit of future history is of a piece with many eighteenth-­century attacks on English addic Madden’s Memoirs of the Twentieth Century\n\n[ 29\n\ntion to Italian opera. Madden puts other suggestions in a more utopian mode. There is, for example, a description of how the Royal College of St. George at Oxford was “founded by his Majesty’s Ancestors in the Eighteenth Century” in order to establish twenty-­six fellowships for deserving continental refugees as well as four new professorships in such useful subjects as agriculture, gardening, mechanical arts, and meteorology. We learn that, thanks to establishment of a chair for “the Weather Professor,” whose task is to keep meteorological records as an aid to weather forecasting, “Six Volumes in Folio of these Calendars have been publisht [sic] from 1840 to 1991” (144). Such passages, whether satiric or utopian, are prescriptive, not predictive. They are scenarios of what should be done, not prophecies of what will be done. As a framework for a tale of the future, Madden’s scheme is more flexible than that adopted in 1771 by Louis-­Sébastien Mercier for L’An 2440 (The Year 2440) and indeed in some ways more flexible than that employed by Wells in The Time Machine (1895). Madden’s epistolary narrative allows for a portrait of life in England, France, Italy, Turkey, and Russia during the 1990s together with attention to eighteenth- and nineteenth-­century developments. Mercier’s protagonist dreams that he wakes in the year 2440 to walk around Paris observing the city and discussing its social institutions with twenty-­fifth-­century Parisians. Developments elsewhere are glanced at in extracts from newspapers but are not described in much detail. Wells’s time traveler can set the controls for any date, but once arrived is pretty much confined to observing how things are at that target moment in history. Madden’s device of letters from diplomats with a professional knowledge of history allows for presentation of a synchronic portrait of Europe at one historical period (the 1990s), and also allows for a diachronic account of previous events. Mercier presents an eyewitness narrative that results in a vivid but static portrait of Paris in 2440 without much attention to the stages by which deplorable eighteenth-­century conditions gave way to those of the distant and better future that his narrator describes. Madden’s epistolary framework more easily allows for depiction of historical change. For Mercier’s purpose, which was primarily to arouse discontent that could motivate political action, it was effective enough simply to plunge readers into an encounter with a utopian Paris devoid of eighteenth-­century shortcomings. Indeed, by withholding any account of how such perfection had been achieved, Mercier sharpens the contrast between 1771 and 2440. This encourages readers to supply the missing causal links in their own imagination—thereby considering what might actually be done to move the France of 1771 toward Mercier’s vision of a better future. In his preface to 30 ]\n\nPau l K . A lkon\n\nthe third edition of L’An 2440, Mercier claimed, with some justice, that he had been the prophet of the French Revolution.6 By way of proof, he stated that his book was being reprinted without the slightest change so readers could judge for themselves its predictive power as “a dream that had announced and prepared the French revolution.” Mercier only disclaimed responsibility for encouraging the Terror, which so nearly cost him his life, and which was, he insists, impossible to foresee because one cannot imagine a handful of scoundrels suddenly dominating an enlightened country. Mercier thus notes in retrospect (though only in retrospect) that the implausibility, and hence unpredictability, of events that have actually happened is occasionally a bar to accurate future history. Reality is sometimes so incredible as to hinder fictive extrapolation beforehand. But Mercier does not discuss this as a problem for his genre. Concerned above all with public affairs, Mercier, like Madden, avoided opportunities for depicting personal relationships among the characters inhabiting his future. He could certainly have done so effectively within the framework of a first-­person narrative. Yet Madden’s device of letters from several correspondents would have been an even better matrix for narrating in a suspenseful way developing emotional encounters in the manner of later Richardsonian fictions had Madden cared to do so, or had he been sufficiently talented. A series of dated letters also allows more easily sustained awareness of a future setting. There can be no doubt that L’An 2440 is the superior book because of its coherence in sticking to a utopian mode, and also because of its influence as a widely read work that helped prepare for social change while also by its success encouraging other writers to invent tales of the future.7 Madden nevertheless deserves recognition for his achievement in designing, though not fully exploiting, a better framework for such tales. Ever since the Christian Gauss seminar at Princeton was devoted to science fiction in 1958 by Kingsley Amis, critics have tackled with increasing refinement the problem of adequately defining that genre. I accept Darko Suvin’s argument that sf is best considered as the literature of cognitive estrangement rather than taking it, with Brian Aldiss, merely as “a lively sub-­ genre of the gothic” in which some alarming future locale is substituted for the old castles favored by Horace Walpole, Ann Radcliffe, and their imitators for, in effect, transporting readers to a disturbing past. By identifying a kinship between gothic tales and sf during the Romantic period when the new genre was unequivocally exemplified in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818), Aldiss shows the relevance of eighteenth-­century theories of the sublime that provided a necessary aesthetics for the new form by legiti Madden’s Memoirs of the Twentieth Century\n\n[ 31\n\nmizing terrifying strangeness of setting and incident, eventually including future settings. Aldiss rightly suggests that by a displacement to the future sf can manage better than its precursors “to encompass those fears generated by change and the technological advances which are the chief agents of change” (53). However sf is defined, no one can very well deny that its rise is closely connected with the tale of the future. Not everyone, to be sure, would agree with Thomas Hanzo’s provocative assertion that all sf “is a proleptic structure,” that is, a kind of writing using in a fictional mode that rhetorical strategy in which for persuasive purposes “the future is treated as the past” so that “what is to come is . . . put into the past tense.” Still I find among academic critics a consensus for which Hanzo speaks when in the same challenging essay he asserts of sf that “Space may be its scene, the extraterrestrial its locale, but time is its peculiar realm; the future gives science fiction its energy and purpose” (132).8 For the genre thus energized if not defined by its attention to the future, Suvin accurately locates “its central watershed . . . around 1800, when space loses its monopoly upon the location of estrangement and the alternative horizons shift from space to time” (89). Various explanations for this shift have been offered, usually in terms of widening temporal horizons and heightened awareness of change induced by the new geology, by theories of biological evolution, and by the political and industrial revolutions of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. These transformations all play some part, but Suvin is nevertheless right to say of the shift from space to time that “this turning, that cuts decisively across all other national, political and formal traditions in culture, has so far not been adequately explained” (116). Suvin maintains that setting narratives in the future became appealing partly because that was the easiest means of getting away from the constraining demands of “naturalistic plausibility” that were looming ever larger throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in conjunction with a “strict positivist ideology” at odds with those genres that aimed at eliciting by astonishing stories the effects of cognitive estrangement (72–73). Whatever the role of positivist ideology in putting a greater premium on plausible fiction, there can be little doubt that in view of the generic or purely formal pressures toward verisimilitude exerted so vigorously by Defoe, Richardson, and their successors, it was becoming harder than ever before to locate tales like Gulliver’s Travels in the present. More important for Suvin as an underlying cause of that difficulty, and hence of the shift to fictions of the future, is “the strong tendency toward temporal extrapolation inherent in life based on a capitalist economy, with its salaries, profits, and progressive ideals always expected in a 32 ]\n\nPau l K . A lkon\n\nfuture clock-­time” (73). There is surely some truth to this suggestion. But it too strikes me as only a partial explanation of the shift to chronicles of the future. Though one does not find such chronicles in the Middle Ages, one does find the new money-­oriented attitudes toward time notably emerging if not yet triumphant well before the Renaissance.9 Even more to the point, there were in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries transformations quite as profound in their consequences for human relationships to time as the shift to capitalist modes of production: the rise of experimental science and the new astronomy along with related mathematical developments such as calculus and probability theory, exploration of the Americas and the Pacific, and increasing skepticism about those religious convictions that had deflected writers from concern with the secular future by focusing attention instead upon apocalyptic visions of time’s end and eternity’s beginning. It begs the question to lump all such transformations together as epiphenomena of changing modes of production caused by the rise of capitalism. I believe the formalist p"
