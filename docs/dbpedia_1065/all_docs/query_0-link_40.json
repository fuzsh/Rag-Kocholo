Harper, Jr., William R. Harmon, Christopher Armitage, Pamela Cooper, Randall Hendrick, Connie Eble, Doris A. Helbig, Charles H. Heying, Barbara T. Ryan, and Julie M. Johnson. I could not have completed this project without the loving support of my family, especially my parents and my wife, Margaret, who never doubted that I would complete the task. I particularly thank my brother, John, who years ago asked a question about A Clockwork Orange that I have yet to answer, but the pursuit of which has led to this volume. -xi-\n\n1 The Language of Dystopia \"When I use a word,\" Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, \"it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor less.\" \"The question is,\" said Alice, \"whether you can make words mean different things.\" \"The question is,\" said Humpty Dumpty, \"which is to be master-that's all.\" -- Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass Poor Alice. Humpty Dumpty's argument--that words are not immutable, but up for grabs in a struggle for control--challenges one of her most basic assumptions. Beyond Humpty Dumpty's charming image of a speaker wrestling with words for control over their definitions lie darker questions: how far might a speaker go in enforcing acceptance of, or at least stifling dissent over, a given meaning and in eliminating other ones? By controlling language, can a speaker also control the thoughts of others who speak that language? If language can only be controlled within fiction, why is the idea so effective at terrifying readers? During her travels in Wonderland, Alice struggles against other speakers for control over words and meanings. Leah Hadomi and Robert Elbaz argue that: [M]uch like the development in the utopian genre as a whole, the developmental process in Alice moves from utopia to dystopia. . . . This world based on a fantastic organization of an ideal reality, closed, separated and harmonious, is likely, in its exaggeration or extremism, to become a stifling dystopian reality, static and -1totalitarian, which the hero (and the reader) experiences like a nightmare. Alice too goes from wonder to quiet disbelief and from there to outright rebellion until the end when she leaves wonderland [sic] behind. ( 1990, 139) The looking glass of twentieth-century dystopian fiction in English offers a rich body of literature in which concerns of social control through forcibly narrowed language play a critical role. Utopian fiction explores the perfectibility of human society through hypothetical advancements in technology, philosophy, and social structures, resulting in perfect or nearperfect communities located in distant lands or in the future. Dystopian fiction, utopia's polarized offspring, turns human perfectibility on its head by pessimistically extrapolating contemporary social trends into oppressive and terrifying societies. Utopia's optimistic portrayal of advancement toward stable human societies gives way, in dystopia, to totalitarian stagnation. Individual freedom, especially the freedom to entertain and communicate unorthodox ideas, is ruthlessly suppressed in dystopias. Humpty Dumpty's question of \"which is to be master\" thus determines, not only who will control the word, but who will control the world through the word. Twentieth-century dystopias in English universally reveal a central emphasis on language as the primary weapon with which to resist oppression, and the corresponding desire of repressive government structures to stifle dissent by controlling language. The roles of\n\nlanguage in various dystopian fictions have been briefly discussed as elements of larger studies, but no critics have attempted to bridge the gaps between different fictions to construct a generic model of language use in dystopian literature. I focus my investigation on conscious attempts within dystopian fictions to control language (and, by extension, meaning), as well as conscious rebellions against such controls. I also examine fundamental assumptions that dystopian writers make about language, including its development and its relationships to other conventions of the genre. Other topics discussed include the roles of narration and narrators, language as a tool for characterization, and some questions concerning artificial language. Any discussion of dystopian fiction in general, and dystopian language in particular, must be grounded in an understanding of how dystopia has evolved from utopia--first as a reaction against utopian assumptions and gradually developing into a separate, highly didactic genre of its own. Issues of control in dystopian literature can be traced to similar questions that have formed a backbone for utopian literature since its \"official\" inception with Thomas More's Utopia, first published in an English translation by Ralph Robynson in 1551. 1 Numerous scholars have identified prefigurations of More's book reaching back to classical Greece, and others have conflated utopian fiction with utopian manifestos and blueprints for creating utopian communities. Despite this confusion, More's Utopia is usually taken as the beginning of what we now call utopian literature. Dystopia begins as a component of the wider form of the antiutopia, which reacts against the assumptions of the still larger body of utopian literature. Charting the evolution of utopian fiction from its beginnings to the present day far exceeds the scope of the present study. 2 For our purposes, simplifying somewhat from the work of Alexandra Aldridge (see her Scientific World View in Dystopia, 1984, 3), utopian fictions may be divided into five basic types: the earthly paradise; the religious utopia; the Golden Age; the popular, or folk, -2utopia; and the planned society. Of these five varieties, it is the planned society depicted in Plato's Republic (circa 400 B.C.) and More's Utopia that is most important for the development of anti-utopia and dystopia. Plato's ideal is easily the most persuasive pre-More utopic society, and Krishan Kumar points out that More \"saw his own Utopia as partly a continuation of the Republic, fulfilling Socrates' desire in the Timaeus to see the abstract republic actualized (a task barely begun in the fragmentary Critias)\" ( 1987, 5). Only the planned society gives humanity the full responsibility to build more perfect states without help or guidance from divine beings--and only these models place the burden of success or failure solely on human shoulders. Dystopia employs the same structures of deliberately planned societies, albeit horrible ones. Dystopian fiction owes More a great debt, as More's coinage has given its name to the genre of works concerned with perfect societies. 3 Works that react against them are therefore antiutopias, and some of them are dystopias. Although More wrote in Latin, the name he gave to his book and to the fictitious country described in it combines two Greek terms, ou (\"not\") and topos (\"place\")--literally, \"no place.\" The Latin word utopia has the same pronunciation in Greek and, if transliterated into \"ευτοπια,\" the first syllable becomes eu (good), thereby changing the meaning to \"good place.\" Utopia, then, is simultaneously a good place and no place. Robert C. Elliott credits More with punning for satiric effect: \"The two senses--the one\n\nassociated with escape into the timeless fantasies of the imagination, the other with the effort to construct models of the ideal society, whether in fiction or otherwise--are inextricably bound up in our use of the term today\" ( 1970, 85). In addition, More emphasizes control. Utopia is the prototype of a model society in which people have changed their behavior, or have had change imposed upon them, to achieve stability. The explorer Raphael Hythloday carefully explains the communistic and egalitarian society in which the Utopians live. The culture's most important task is to control its citizens' baser individual impulses and keep them focused on the greater public good. Private property is unknown ( More 1975, 38); chamber pots are made of gold and gems are used as children's toys to prevent avarice (51); all Utopians wear the same style and color of clothing to prevent envy (40); the terminally ill are urged to submit to euthanasia (65); and, as Hythloday proudly notes, \"there is no chance to loaf or kill time, no pretext for evading work; no taverns, or alehouses, or brothels; no chances for corruption; no hiding places; no spots for secret meetings\" (49). Dystopia relies on many of these same conventions, though used for illiberal motives. Finally, More created the basic plot structure of the utopian novel, which has remained fundamentally unchanged to this day and against which dystopian fiction still reacts. He simply put a representative of the perfect society (the explorer Raphael Hythloday) together with equally representative members of contemporary European culture (fictionalized versions of the printer-poet Peter Giles and Thomas More himself) and had them discuss every aspect of Utopia. 4 With only minor changes, utopian fiction has hewed to this model for over four hundred years. 5 Plot and characterization take a back seat to the clear articulation of the social institutions that make up this more perfect society. Peter Ruppert argues that readers of utopias tend to bifurcate and read them primarily as fiction or as social proposal, but never as both. They do so because utopias simultaneously blur the division between fact and fiction, by proposing \"real\" -3solutions to \"real\" problems, while also drawing a sharp line between the reader's reality and that of the utopia's imaginary construct ( 1986, 13). Not all writers and thinkers have found the utopian vision persuasive, and some have used the word utopia as a derisive epithet to ridicule schemes that they consider irresponsible or impossible. From its beginnings, critics have attacked the ideals of human perfectibility that serve as the foundation on which all utopias are constructed: these critics take a more pessimistic view of our race's capability consciously to subordinate individual drives and desires to the needs of the greater social whole. The Roman writer Lucian of Samosata's masterpiece The True History, which was written in the second century A.D., parodies the Arcadian Golden Age so effectively that it is often misread as an Arcadian utopia in its own right ( Todd and Wheeler 1978, 10). More was not deceived, however. His clear understanding of The True History is underlined by Hythloday's assertion that the Utopians are \"delighted with the witty persiflage of Lucian\" ( More 1975, 63). Furthermore, the Utopians also enjoy the comedies of Aristophanes, \"many of which were aimed at the Greek utopian tradition generally, and some at Plato's Republic specifically,\" especially the Ecclesiazusae and The Birds ( Kumar 1987, 8). Utopia itself may be read as a satire, and it loses nothing through such an interpretation. Robert Burton Anatomy of Melancholy ( 1621) and Jonathan Swift Gulliver's Travels ( 1726) satirize, among other targets, the utopian ideal\n\nin general and More's Utopia in particular. But while these works all fit nicely into the category of the antiutopia, only one--Swift's--contains elements that qualify it as an early dystopia. As Krishan Kumar notes, More's Utopia serves, not only as a point of origin for the formal literary utopia, but also as the beginning of its opposite, the utopian satire or anti-utopia: Utopia and anti-utopia are antithetical yet interdependent. They are \"contrast concepts,\" getting their meaning and significance from their mutual differences. But the relationship is not symmetrical or equal. The anti-utopia is formed by utopia, and feeds parasitically on it. It depends for its survival on the persistence of utopia. Utopia is the original, anti-utopia the copy--only, as it were, always colored black. It is utopia that provides the positive content to which anti-utopia makes the negative response. Anti-utopia draws its material from utopia and reassembles it in a manner that denies the affirmation of utopia. . . . The formal literary anti-utopia consequently had to wait for the establishment of the formal literary utopia. It does not, that is, appear before More's Utopia, after which it has a history almost as continuous as that of utopia itself. ( 1987, 100) While suggesting that there are as many prefigurations of anti-utopia as there are of the utopia proper, Kumar asserts that after More, the battle lines were clearly and consciously drawn between the two forms. He explicitly links the two halves of the diverging genre with the argument between two antithetical views of the human spirit, as articulated by Pelagius, a fifth-century British monk, and Augustine, Bishop of Hippo: Part of the interwoven story of utopia and anti-utopia can indeed be interestingly told as the longstanding clash between Augustinian and Pelagian traditions within western thought. The utopian . . . is a Pelagian. He denies original sin, and believes that men can perfect themselves by creating the right environment. The anti-utopian . . . is Augustinian. He sees weak human creatures constantly succumbing to the sins -4of pride, avarice and ambition, however favourable the circumstances. The antiutopian need not believe in original sin, but his pessimistic and determinist view of human nature leads him to the conviction that all attempts to create the good society on earth are bound to be futile. ( 1987, 100) 6 As the gulf between utopia and anti-utopia widened during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the term anti-utopia became increasingly unsatisfactory to denote all fictions that turn utopian dreams into nightmares. Since no seminal work comparable to More's has arisen to give this genre a name, critics and writers have coined a number of different labels for utopia's polarized opposite. J. O. Bailey's 1947 wide-ranging study of science fiction distinguishes only between utopias and \"utopian satire,\" which suggests (erroneously) that a work of the latter type must of necessity be simply a parody of the former. Northrop Frye adopts the same terminology in his essay, \"Varieties of Literary Utopias\", arguing for two kinds of utopian romance: the straight utopia, which visualizes a world-state assumed to be ideal, or at least ideal in comparison with what we have, and the utopian satire or parody, which presents the same kind of social goal in terms of slavery, tyranny, or anarchy. . . . Examples of the utopian satire include We, Brave New World, and Nineteen Eighty-four.\n\nThere are other types of utopian satire . . . but this particular kind is a product of modern technological society, its growing sense that the whole world is destined to the same social fate with no place to hide, and its increasing realization that technology moves toward the control not merely of nature but of the operations of the mind. ( 1966, 28-29) Less imaginative critics have been content with anti-utopia, but that term fails to describe a genre in which writers advocate their own positions rather than merely attacking utopian ideas. Arthur O. Lewis has assembled a checklist of terms by which the anti-utopian novel can be designated: \"reverse utopias, negative utopias, inverted utopias, regressive utopias, cacoutopias, dystopias, non-utopias, satiric utopias, and . . . nasty utopias\" ( 1961, 27). Alexandra Aldridge notes that Lewis misses \"some bizarre appellations such as George Knox's 'sour utopias in the apocalyptic mode' and George Woodcock's 'negative quasiUtopias'\" ( 1984, 5). 7 More recently, Michel Foucault has called such fictions \"heterotopias.\" 8 Of these, \"the terms satiric utopia (or utopian satire), anti-utopia and dystopia are the most frequently used; they provide the most helpful generic distinctions, and taken in that order also suggest something about the genesis and evolution of the contemporary negative form-the dystopian novel\" ( Aldridge 1984, 5). Aldridge emphasizes the order of these terms since they reflect a growing gap between utopias and their opposites. Utopian satires, by definition, ridicule specific utopian visions; anti-utopias merely criticize more generalized utopian ideals, while dystopias aggressively target contemporary social structures without direct reference to utopias. The term dystopia is not a new one. When J. Max Patrick used it in 1952, he thought he was making it up; 9 in fact, however, John Stuart Mill coined the word in 1868 ( Aldridge 1984, 8). 10 Mill had in mind Jeremy Bentham's cacotopia--\"evil place\"--which exactly fits the sense of the definition, but neither term seems to have caught the imagination of critics for the next hundred years. 11 Dystopia is preferable to anti-utopia for two main reasons. Rhetorically, it exactly reverses the common misreading of More's eutopia: \"δυσ τοποσ\" translates literally as \"bad place.\" Dystopias concern themselves with the moral -5structure of a fictive society, not its physical location. Furthermore, although dystopian societies may appear to exist \"out there,\" they criticize the reader's world--\"displacing\" the reader, if you will. (Conceivably, dystopia \"disrespects\" utopia.) Many anti-utopian fictions depict pleasant societies. For instance, of the numerous attacks mounted against Edward Bellamy Looking Backward ( 1888), William Morris News from Nowhere ( 1890) is easily the most readable and persuasive. Morris undercuts nearly every aspect of Bellamy's novel by advancing a very different, but equally attractive, model society. Both by contrast and by definition, dystopias always depict horrible societies, even though they may at first appear pleasant (as in Huxley Brave New World, 1932; see Walsh 1962, 25-26). Second, dystopia as a genre encompasses a spectrum of works ranging from a few anti-utopias proper (such as some aspects of Book 4 of Swift's Gulliver's Travels) through novels that create miserable societies without directly attacking utopian ideals (e.g., Margaret Atwood Handmaid's Tale, 1986, examined in Chapter 6). Dystopia remains a much narrower descriptive term and is rarely applied to other endeavors beyond the particular genre of narrative fiction that I discuss here. Finally, even the bleakest dystopia offers advance warning of what could happen should present trends continue unchecked. A dystopian narrative tries to warn, didactically predicting a coming evil while there is still time to correct the situation. Though dystopian fictions paint grim views, their political and moral missions are altruistic. Anti-utopias may succeed merely\n\nby criticizing utopian ideals: dystopias, however, always reveal (usually by ironic contrast) attitudes and suggest actions that can prevent the horrors they depict. Because of these altruistic and didactic intentions, dystopia connotes a genre actively defining itself. In a nutshell, all dystopias are anti-utopias, but not all anti-utopias are dystopias. The question then shifts to one of subject matter: if dystopia describes a \"bad place,\" what makes it so? If utopian literature describes more perfect societies and a given reader finds a particular utopian novel persuasive, is not that reader's objective reality a dystopia by comparison? Alexandra Aldridge argues: The dystopia is not merely \"utopia in reverse\" as it has often been called, but a singular generic category issuing out of a twentieth-century shift of attitudes toward utopia. Dystopia is composed of unique qualities of imagination and sensibility-certain historically bound shifts of the social imagination--brought together not as a fictive philosophical tract, but in the form of the modern novel. However, the dystopian novelist, instead of recreating some fragment of the actual world, extrapolates from his concept of actuality in order to make a holistic framework, a complete alternative (inevitably futuristic) structure. Whereas it can be said that utopia and much utopian thought are the brain children of the scientific world view in their attempts to \"scientifically\" restructure society, dystopia always aims to critique and ridicule that world view for its adherence to instrumental values, its elevation of functional and collective ends over the humanistic and individual. ( 1984, ix) The key points in Aldridge's assertion are dystopia's form--the novel--and its role in criticizing the advancement of the collective over the individual. Both these points are inextricably tied to dystopia's rapid rise to both popular and critical importance in the twentieth century. Although the roots of utopian literature stretch back to classical Greece, dystopian literature as a distinct genre is a comparatively recent phenomenon. 12 The dystopia begins only in the midto late eighteenth century, when the early promise of the Industrial Revolution--6that technological progress would inevitably improve social conditions--gave way to increasingly impersonalized mechanization and exploitation. 13 Dystopian societies are, without exception, terrible ones--though not necessarily squalid; consider the clean and comfortable London of Huxley Brave New World and the physical security of Earth in Suzette Elgin Native Tongue ( 1984) and The Judas Rose ( 1987). But Aldridge neglects one issue central to the dystopia--that of satirizing contemporary society, or aspects thereof, that the writer finds disturbing. This is the most critical distinction between the broad genre of anti-utopia and the narrower one of dystopia. Dystopian fiction is fundamentally concerned with the writer's present society and builds its horrific power on extrapolating current trends to what the writer considers their logically fearsome conclusions. Dystopian didacticism borders on the hortatory polemic: anti-utopian fiction may (or may not) address the existing problems of its writer's world, but dystopia must always do so. For this reason, dystopian novels rarely attack specific utopian visions, lashing out instead at serious flaws within the writer's contemporary society. There are very few dystopian precursors before the Industrial Revolution. Augustine City of Man, the sinfully corrupt counterpart to the City of God, comes to mind; Kumar also suggests Niccolo Machiavelli The Prince ( 1532) as \"a key anti-utopian text--as is clear from the many conscious and unconscious echoes of it\n\nin Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-four ( 1987, 101 ). Kumar buttresses his argument by pointing out the strong possibility that Machiavelli's guide to statecraft was intended as satire. Satire forms the clearest and strongest strain of literary fiction leading to the development of dystopia, primarily because it, too, is aimed at pointing out problems with the writer's contemporary world. The large number of powerful anti-utopian satiric works has led some critics to label the genre--in effect, utopia's \"evil twin\"--as \"utopian satire.\" Northrop Frye's arguments along these lines have been the most cogent and, as they concern a genre about which there has been little critical agreement over formal questions, his conclusions bear repeating briefly. Satire, Frye states, depends on two elements: \"one is wit or humor founded on fantasy or a sense of the grotesque or absurd, the other is an object of attack\" ( 1957, 224). While few dystopias contain even a shred of humor other than dark irony, all are founded on Frye's \"sense of the grotesque or absurd.\" The societies that dystopian fictions depict are fantastic only in the sense that they do not literally exist in the writer's contemporary world-they easily could come about, given current patterns extrapolated by the writers. The patterns of behavior or social organization that dystopian writers satirize provide Frye's necessary second element, the object of attack: The satirist demonstrates the infinite variety of what men do by showing the futility, not only of saying what they ought to do, but even of attempts to systematize or formulate a coherent scheme of what they do. . . . The Menippean satire deals less with people as such than with mental attitudes. Pedants, bigots, cranks, parvenus, virtuosi, enthusiasts, rapacious and incompetent professional men of all kinds, are handled in terms of their occupational approach to life as distinct from their social behavior. ( 1957, 229, 309) 14 Dystopia's vague generic boundaries are nowhere murkier than in the relationship between dystopian fiction and science fiction--a genre that has proved itself even more problematic in terms of definition. Science fiction critics -7keep trying to define the literature they study, despite the fact that it resists definition. Any definition of science fiction wide enough to encompass all possible works of science fiction finds itself including works of fantasy, alternate history, utopia and anti-utopia, fairy tales, märchen, and mythology, among others. At the same time, limiting the range of literature by narrowing the definition of science fiction inevitably leaves out works that clamor, with some justification, to be included. While a universally acceptable definition of science fiction still eludes critics, the process of wrestling with conflicting definitions has been part of a growing critical interest in the genre since the mid-1960s. Despite this growing interest, science fiction continues to be dismissed as popular literature, junk literature, and even subliterature. 15 Tzvetan Todorov The Fantastic (trans. 1973) applies structuralist techniques to the study of fantastic literature, broadly considered. For Todorov, fantastic literature exists in the zone of uncertainty created when \"there occurs an event which cannot be explained by the laws of this same familiar world\"(25). If we determine that the event is an illusion, then the laws of reality are not violated and we have experienced the \"uncanny\"; alternatively, if the event is real, then \"this reality is controlled by laws unknown to us,\" and we have experienced the \"marvelous\" (25). \"The fantastic occupies the duration of this uncertainty. Once we choose one answer or the other, we leave the fantastic for . . . the uncanny or the marvelous. The\n\nfantastic is that hesitation experienced by a person who knows only the laws of nature, confronting an apparently supernatural event\" (25). Darko Suvin's arguments are somewhat narrower in focus, dealing almost exclusively with science fiction. Yet Suvin, like Todorov, resists denominating any one element (science, technology, future setting, etc.) as the key ingredient for science fiction. Suvin also declares that formal considerations are more helpful than thematic ones, since the thematic field open to science fiction is almost limitless: [Science fiction] should be defined as a fictional tale determined by the hegemonic literary device of a locus and/or dramatis personae that (1) are radically or at least significantly different from the empirical times, places, and characters of \"mimetic\" or \"naturalist\" fiction, but (2) are nonetheless--to the extent that [science fiction] differs from other \"fantastic\" genres, that is, ensembles of fictional tales without empirical validation--simultaneously perceived as not impossible within the cognitive (cosmological and anthropological) norms of the author's epoch. Basically, [science fiction] is a developed oxymoron, a realistic irreality, with humanized nonhumans, this-worldly Other Worlds, and so forth. Which means that it is-potentially--the space of a potent estrangement, validated by the pathos and prestige of the basic cognitive forms of our times. ( 1979, viii ) By arguing for science fiction as the literature of \"cognitive estrangement\" ( 1979, 4 ), Suvin advances an understanding of such fiction as creating sets of given norms that differ from those the reader brings to the text--substantially the same disjunction that Todorov (trans. 1973) calls \"uncertainty.\" 16 Philip K. Dick seems to agree when he insists that the essence of science fiction is \"the conceptual dislocation within the society so that as a result a new society is generated in the author's mind, transferred to paper, and from paper it occurs as a convulsive shock in the reader's mind, the shock of dysrecognition\" ( 1987, xv). Bluntly, in all these models, readers compare their objective realities with those contained in works of fiction. Science fiction renders the real unreal and creates an atmosphere of unfamiliarity in which the reader may be brought to consider -8issues in a fictive context that the same reader would not notice, or would ignore, if presented in a nonfictive manner. Dystopia not only shares this concern with estrangement, but foregrounds it: a dystopian work fails if it does not move its reader to compare his or her \"real world\" to the fictional society and consider how the latter could arise from the former. Dystopia and science fiction share formal similarities. Both genres generally set their stories in the writer's future; both depend on extrapolations of human behavior and social structures; both have been accused of sacrificing characterization in favor of creating plausible fictive societies; and both make extensive use of technological developments, whether actual or imagined. Both forms came into their own as recognizably independent genres during the nineteenth century. Most critics cite Mary Shelley Frankenstein, or, The Modern Prometheus ( 1818) as the first clear example of science fiction. Identifying the specific work with which dystopia begins is more difficult. Kumar asserts that \"it may indeed be only a slight overstatement to say that [ Bellamy] Looking Backward [ 1888] created the anti-utopia. Certainly it started that chain of challenge and response that largely makes up the history of utopia and anti-utopia from the 1880s to the 1950s\" ( 1987, 128 ). While Kumar's point about Looking Backward as the first anti-utopia is debatable--if for no other reason than that it directly contradicts his previous assignment of primacy to Joseph Hall Mundus Alter et Idem ( 1605) on page 105 of the same work ( 1987)--his assertions about Looking Backward's effect\n\nin beginning a \"chain of challenge and response\" between utopia and dystopia are beyond question. The wild popularity of Bellamy's socialistic utopia incited a number of anti-utopian counterattacks, including Richard C. Michaelis Looking Further Forward ( 1890) and Konrad Wilbrandt Mr. East's Experiences in Mr. Bellamy's World ( 1891) ( Negley in Negley and Patrick 1952, 33). One of the best of these is Ignatius Donnelly Cæsar's Column ( 1890), which depicts an extremely repressive totalitarian capitalist oligarchy ruthlessly crushing an attempted revolution by the desperate proletariat ( Kumar 1987, 128). Jack London portrays essentially the same situation as Donnelly in The Iron Heel ( 1907), while making the techniques of totalitarian repression much more plain. Indeed, London's title provided Orwell with one of the most terrifying images in Nineteen Eighty-four: O'Brien's vision of the future as \"a boot stamping on a human face--forever\" ( 1982, 178). 17 Clearly, H. G. Wells has been the central figure in the development of both science fiction and dystopian fiction as separate genres. Like Bellamy, Wells has served as a focal point for numerous writers who disagree, often violently, with his visions of the future--although, unlike Bellamy, Wells also produced some dystopian fiction of his own. \"Overwhelmingly, the most important influences of this period in creating the modern anti-utopias were the scientific romances, utopias, and future histories of H. G. Wells, which, even when occasionally written after World War I, are still the unique product of this period. . . . Altogether, it is doubtful that without Wells the anti-utopian phenomenon would ever have taken the shape it has\" ( Hillegas 1967, 4-5). Wells's influence on later writers, especially Aldous Huxley, Eugene Zamiatin, and George Orwell, is more important than the anti-utopias he actually wrote. Ironically, Wells makes his mark on the field of dystopian fiction by creating some of the most complex and carefully conceived utopias in modern fiction: When the Sleeper Wakes ( 1899; revised and reprinted as The Sleeper Awakes, 1911), MenLike Gods -9Like Gods ( 1923), and most especially, A Modern Utopia ( 1905). It is primarily in attacking Wells's visions of utopia that the great twentieth-century dystopians break new ground, although they occasionally crib from his anti-utopian novels: The Time Machine ( 1895), The First Men in the Moon ( 1901), The War in the Air ( 1908), Tono-Bungay ( 1909), and The Shape of Things to Come ( 1933). Kumar notes that \" Huxley and Orwell . . . made no secret of the fact that their anti-utopias were directed largely against Wells, as the representative modern utopian. But what is interesting, and very evident, is the extent of their borrowing from the earlier anti-utopian Wells in their attacks on the later utopian Wells\" ( 1987, 129). The Selenite culture in Wells The First Men in the Moon is reflected in the social structure of Huxley Brave New World, and Orwell's Oceanic government in Nineteen Eighty-four owes much of its affective power to Wells When the Sleeper Wakes, in which the dictator Ostrog rules over a socialistic state ( Kumar 1987, 225). Nor have modern writers hesitated to acknowledge Wells as the catalyst for their dystopian fiction. \"In an interview with a representative from the Paris Review, Aldous Huxley once commented that he began Brave New World as a parody of H. G. Wells Men Like Gods ( Matter 1983, 94). 18 E. M. Forster described his dystopic story, \"The Machine Stops\" ( 1909) as \"a reaction to one of the earlier heavens of H. G. Wells\" ( 1976, 6). While Bellamy and Wells share the distinction of inspiring numerous antiutopian \"replies\" to their utopian works, the kind and degree of resistance that their writings generated is fundamentally different. Bellamy's one utopian novel sparked several rebuttals, the majority\n\nof which are simply direct assaults on Looking Backward. Wells's influence as a utopian writer is much more pervasive, partly because he wrote several utopian novels and partly due to the fact that most of his utopian fictions were written at a time when the utopian vision in Western society was rapidly (and visibly) failing. The dream of inevitable human progress through technological advancement perished during World War I, and hopes of recreating society along better lines faded with the Great Depression and the rise of nationalistic totalitarianism. 19 Wells's portrayals of social justice and a better world realized through scientific advancement began to seem not only absurd, but misguided. Writers wishing to attack Wells could not fully express the depth of their revulsion merely by parodying his utopian novels. Instead, writers like Zamiatin and Huxley began constructing horrific societies that stand alone as meaningful fiction. Since Wells, the utopian novel has been almost completely eclipsed by the dystopian. \"Why has the utopian vision faded? I can think of two reasons. One is that utopia has failed\" in that the twentieth century has not lived up to the expectations of the nineteenth. \"The other is that utopia has succeeded\" in that ideas once thought of as utopian have come to pass, \"but the result is not utopian\" ( Walsh 1962, 117). Twentieth-century history provides an embarrassment of riches with which dystopian writers construct fictions that are as plausible as they are bleak. Yet dystopia is fundamentally a genre concerned with improving human existence and directing attention toward the twentieth century's problems. For one thing, compared to utopian writers, dystopian writers take a more realistic view of human nature. The Samurai of Wells A Modern Utopia become the Inner Party of Orwell Nineteen Eighty-four, because Orwell does not trust humans to remain uncorrupted while carrying such incredible burdens of power -10as Wells blithely puts on the shoulders of his characters. The dystopian writer is, perhaps, the most disillusioned reader within the utopian tradition. 20 These writers, \"dystopists,\" desire a better world, but view utopian schemes as distracting at best, and often misguided. This is stretching things a bit, as Kumar ( 1987) admits. Still, the dystopian writer disdains the utopist's rosy scenario as hopelessly removed from real existence. Instead of ignoring the realities of human experience, dystopian writers rub their reader's noses in them \"by taking us on a journey through hell, in all its vivid particulars. It makes us live utopia, as an experience so painful and nightmarish that we lose all desire for it\" ( Kumar 1987, 103). The dystopian polemic punctures utopian fiction's escapism. I use \"escapism\" in the same sense that Gary Saul Morson does: \"utopias describe an escape from history,\" whereas \"antiutopias describe an attempted escape to history, which is to say, the world of contingency, conflict, and uncertainty\" ( 1981, 128). 21 Elliott argues that this is one reason why the utopia has provoked substantial resistance: \"The attempt of utopian writers to freeze history--the fight of utopia against history--has prompted severe criticism of the whole utopian enterprise; but the attempt has been merely one way in which man has tried to arrive imaginatively at the condition of paradise on earth\" ( 1970, 10). Dystopia, by contrast, embraces history, affirms it, proclaims it, arguing that the same horrors that have gone before can, and will, come again unless we learn to understand and prevent them. If dystopia could be said to have a motto, it would be George Santayana's warning writ large--\"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\" In some sense, all dystopian fiction aims at reminding us of the past to ensure that we do not make the same mistakes again.\n\nDystopias arouse comparison between the reader's world and the fictive society, so that \"in assuming an entirely negative position, they leave the act of reconstruction up to the reader\" ( Ruppert 1986, 103-4). The dystopian writer galvanizes the reader to this act of comparison by explicitly depicting how the horrors of the extrapolated future have developed from their beginnings in the reader's culture. The successful dystopia cannot pose problems that readers will perceive as beyond their ability to change: the mission is to motivate the reader, not merely to horrify. The more immediate and personal these problems may appear, the better for the dystopist's didactic purpose. For the fiction to succeed as a didactic warning, readers must be able both to identify the contemporary source of the extrapolated horrors and to feel capable of preventing them. Therefore, it behooves dystopian writers to base their hellish societies on concepts that will make most readers simultaneously feel personally threatened and empowered to resist. Few concepts meet this dual requirement better than language's presumed ability to control thought and its presumed susceptibility to manipulation. The central importance of language in fantastic literature has been the subject of several studies. 22 Similarly, many critics of dystopian texts have pointed to concerns with language embedded in the novels. But with rare exceptions, scholars have tended to examine concerns with language in dystopian fiction as minor interests, points that enrich affective dystopian societies but do not play a central role in creating them. 23 Issues of controlling language inform nearly all dystopian fictions. Furthermore, issues of language are so closely intertwined with questions of power and freedom in dystopian literature that any criticism ignoring these concerns will inevitably produce less-than-comprehensive readings -11of the texts. Some novels overtly explore language concerns as such, often through artificially constructed languages, while other dystopias embed these questions within narrative structures. Although specific constructions of language and control vary from novel to novel, the overall insistence on the centrality of language as the key to both repression and rebellion remains a constant in twentieth-century English and American dystopias. One theme found in all the novels herein discussed is a wholehearted acceptance of the SapirWhorf hypothesis, also called the \"linguistic relativity principle.\" As advanced by Benjamin Lee Whorf in 1940, this theory holds that language gives shape and structure to human perceptions; as Whorf stated most succinctly, \"We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language\" ( 1956, 213). In Whorf's conception, a person cannot understand any concept that he or she cannot frame in words. Edward Sapir's honing of Whorf's theory broadens the relationship between thought and language into a two-way exchange in which language and thought can influence one another, as opposed to Whorf's one-way idea. 24 \"In all fairness to Whorf, the 'Whorfian hypothesis' reflects only part of his thinking[;] . . . even so, he did not call [the] deeper processes [of consciousness, upon which language is a surface wash] 'thought'; this he regarded as dependent on language\" ( Traugott and Pratt 1980, 107). While Whorf's theory is by no means universally accepted among linguists, it serves as a foundation for many of the language-based concerns articulated in the dystopian novels considered here. Furthermore, readers unfamiliar with Whorf's hypothesis have no trouble accepting dystopian language constructions based on it. Paradoxically, language is popularly conceived of as monolithic, something that is prescribed (thus accounting for the frequent misunderstanding that dictionaries record usages, rather than legislate them) and simultaneously as something delicate and vulnerable to deliberate manipulation and control. For example, most readers find the Newspeak of Orwell Nineteen Eighty-four a plausible and terrifying instrument of\n\ntotalitarian thought control, which \"could work\"-despite the fact that many of Orwell's assumptions about language that inform Newspeak are fallacious. Threatening conceptions about language offers the writer a supremely effective means of quickly and deeply involving a reader in a work of fiction, a fact that dystopian writers have seized on more strongly than writers in any other fictive genre. English language use among readers takes place within a matrix of widely shared, but rarely examined, assumptions, for example, that certain regional or ethnic dialects and generational slangs are \"bad English\" or \"incorrect usage\" and that language use is a clear indicator of intellectual capability and moral behavior. Language can be a supremely powerful rallying point for national and cultural groups who wish to emphasize both their heritage and their autonomy, especially when they feel threatened--witness impassioned attempts to legislate English as the \"official language\" of various states and eventually of the United States, or the continuing evolution of the terms by which various racial and cultural groups identify themselves. It is common for words to become the flash points for conflict between opposing groups' differing political viewpoints (consider the debate over the terms \"pro-life\" and \"pro-choice,\" which crystallize complex arguments into simple, if volatile, labels). Given the universality of the pride we take in our language, and the immediacy of our reaction when we believe it to be under attack, it is no surprise that dystopian -12writers put language at the center of their fictions for didactic as well as emotional purposes. Dystopian fiction cuts off retreat. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Alice's \"rebellion against the presumed legal authority of the King and the Queen and the nonsensical practices of the court\" requires nothing more than her refusal to remain silent. \"She commits herself to the fight and establishes the rule of her own sense-making process over the figures around her by declaring: 'You're nothing but a pack of cards!'\" ( Gasson 1978, 99). The process of liberation is the same in Through the Looking Glass: Alice shouts \"I can't stand this any longer!\" and seizes both the tablecloth and her own individual autonomy (209). But the ease with which Alice escapes is rarely available to the serious reader--and never to the dystopian characters. Dystopia forces us to wrestle for our own autonomy and control over language: not merely with the language itself, as Humpty Dumpty suggests, but with those forces that will, if left unchallenged, seize control of language (and through language, power) for their own repressive ends. Dystopian novels sound that challenge, each in a different key. While the resulting word-music is never serene, and only occasionally beautiful, neither is it unremittingly harsh--and it is always stirring and powerful, impossible to ignore.\n\nNOTES 1\n\nUtopia was first published in 1516, in Louvain, Belgium; three more editions followed within the next two years, all in More's original Latin ( Todd and Wheeler 1978, 29). Robynson's translation appeared sixteen years after More's execution.\n\n2\n\nKrishan Kumar gives an excellent survey of the utopian ideal from classical times through nineteenth-century America on 2-98 of Utopia and Anti-Utopia in Modern Times ( 1987). Todd and Wheeler's survey ( 1978), though less detailed, is quite readable and very well illustrated. See also David Bleich ( 1984), Robert C. Elliott ( 1970), George Kateb ( 1972), Frank E. Manuel ( 1966) (particularly Northrop Frye's \"Varieties of Literary Utopias,\" pp. 25-49), Tom Moylan ( 1986), Ruby Rohrlich and Elaine Hoffman\n\nBaruch ( 1984), and Peter Ruppert ( 1986). 3\n\nThroughout this volume, I capitalize \"Utopia\" in referring to More's novel and the country it depicts; \"utopia\" refers to the broader literary genre. The Utopians attribute the name of their state to their founder, King Utopos, a philosopher-king very much in the tradition of Plato's Republic. All references to More's Utopia are to the Norton Critical Edition ( 1975).\n\n4\n\nAppropriately enough, Raphael Hythloday's name translates as \"dispenser of nonsense\" ( Vickers 1968, 250). Robert Adams notes that \"a fantastic trilingual pun could make the whole name mean 'God heals [Heb., Raphael] through the nonsense [Gr., huthlos] of God [Lat., dei]'\" ( More 1975, 6 n. 9).\n\n5\n\nMost utopian writers find it more convenient to send their \"normal\" representative characters to visit the utopian societies in person. The means used to get these characters to their destinations vary widely, ranging from digging down to them, such as BulwerLytton The Coming Race ( 1874) to time travel, such as Bellamy Looking Backward ( 1888). Once there, however, the interminable conversation begins and follows essentially the same pattern as More's.\n\n6\n\nPelagius's ideal--that human beings have the capacity to become perfect through exercising free will, literally following Jesus's teaching in Matthew 5:48-was declared heretical by the Council of Carthage in 418 A.D., but this ideal has continued to fuel utopian sentiments among writers and theorists determined to map out better societies.\n\n7\n\nKnox 1962, 11; Woodcock 1956, 83. -13-\n\n8\n\nThe Order of Things: An Archaeology of Human Sciences ( Foucault 1970, xviii.\n\n9\n\n\"The Mundus Alter et Idem [by Joseph Hall, published in 1605] is utopia in the sense of nowhere; but it is the opposite of eutopia, the ideal society: it is a dystopia, if it is permissible to coin a word\" ( Negley and Patrick 1952, 298). Kumar asserts that Bishop Hall's work \"has good claim to be considered the first formal anti-utopia\" ( 1987, 105).\n\n10 \"As MP for Westminster, Mill in a speech in the House of Commons in 1868 mocked his opponents: 'It is, perhaps, too complimentary to call them Utopians, they ought rather to be called dys-topians, or caco-topians. What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable; but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable.' Hansard Commons, 12 March/1517/1 ( 1868)\" ( Kumar 1987, 447 n. 2). 11 On the reference to Bentham, see Kumar 1987, 447 n. 2. 12 Hillegas suggests that this type of literature is \"a phenomenon of our contemporary world, no older than perhaps the governments of Hitler, Stalin, or Roosevelt\" ( 1967, 4). 13 Aldridge takes this rise in technology as the foundation for all dystopias, arguing that technological progress in turn spurs the evolution of dystopia \"as a form specifically concentrating on the alienating effects of science and technology. Dystopia aims to critique the scientific world view which stimulated its utopian predecessors and upon which utopia, 'the dream of reason,' was built\" ( 1984, 79).\n\n14 Frye's term \"Menippean satire\" includes anti-utopia in general and dystopia in particular. It derives from the Greek Cynic, Menippus, whose works are lost to us but whose influence is represented in the satires of the classical writers Lucian, Varro, Petronius, and Apuleius ( 1957, 309). 15 Critical dismissal of science fiction has often been justified by examining a few egregiously bad works, which are taken as representatives of the genre. Darko Suvin protests that \"the genre has to be and can be evaluated proceeding from its heights down, applying the standards gained by the analysis of its masterpieces. We find in SF, as we do in most other genres of fiction, that 80 to 90 percent of the works in it are sheer confectionary. However, contrary to subliterature, the criteria for the insufficiency of most SF are to be found in the genre itself. This makes SF in principle, if not yet in practice, equivalent to any other 'major' literary genre\" ( 1979, 36). Suvin's assertion that much of science fiction is \"sheer confectionary\" echoes Sturgeon's Law of Science Fiction, so-called because it is popularly credited to Hugowinning writer Theodore Sturgeon. Sturgeon counters the accusation that 90 percent of science fiction is crud by asserting \"90 percent of everything is crud. . . . [But t]he best science fiction is as good as the best fiction in any field\" ( Bainbridge 1986, 12). Scholes and Rabkin call this \"the most quoted dictum in science fiction\" and remind us that \"we must be grateful for a man who breaks his own law so decidedly\" ( 1977, 62). 16 Suvin notes that the term \"cognitive estrangement comes from the Russian ostranenie, which he credits to Viktor Shklovsky ( 1979, 6). 17 Another of London's dystopian visions, The Scarlet Plague ( 1915), finds modern echoes in Russell Hoban's Riddley Walker ( 1982). See Chapter 7. 18 Matter notes the origin of this quotation as Paris Review 1963, 198, prepared for publication by George Plimpton. 19 In the United States, the optimism of the New Deal combined with isolationist sentiments--followed by the industrial recovery of World War II and the national pride that accompanied victory--effectively blunted the widespread social malaise felt so keenly in Europe. The dystopian mood evident in England beginning in the late 1920s did not reach America until the mid-1960s, at a time when questions about American involvement in Vietnam deeply divided the nation. This accounts for the -14relatively disproportionate number of twentieth-century dystopias in English having been written by British authors until well into the 1970s. 20 Kumar asserts that dystopian writers have at least as much of the utopian as the anti-utopian temperament in their make-up. . . . [T]he anti-utopia is largely the creation of men for whom it represented the dark obverse of their own profound and passionate utopian temperament. Their antiutopias are born of a sense of frustrated and thwarted utopianism. Neither in their individual life [sic] nor in the world at large do they see any prospect of the utopia they so desperately wish for. The anti-utopia for them is a kind of angry revenge against their own foolish hopes, a backhanded compliment to the noble but deluded purposes of utopia. The intimate connection\n\nof utopia and anti-utopia here most clearly reveals itself as the anguished cry of a single divided self. ( Kumar 1987, 104) 21 \"Thus, for Morson, dystopia constitutes the \"rebirth of the novel\" on the formal level, since it reintroduces the possibility of conflict, doubt, anxiety, and tragedy in its fictive projection\" ( Ruppert 1986, 102). 22 See the works of Myra Barnes ( 1975), Christine Brooke-Rose ( 1981), Samuel Delany ( 1977, 1984), W. R. Irwin ( 1976), Walter Meyers ( 1980), Ruth Noel ( 1980), and Marc Okrand ( 1985). Of particular interest are Delany's multivolume studies, as he is himself a respected science fiction writer. Ruth Noel analyzes the eleven separate languages that J. R. R. Tolkien created for his Middle-earth, especially as they appear in The Lord of the Rings ( 1954) and The Silmarillion ( 1977). It is interesting to note that Tolkien's fictions--arguably the greatest fantasy novels of the twentieth century--were originally written to provide a framework capable of supporting his imaginary languages, instead of the languages being created to enrich the fiction. Marc Okrand's imaginary Klingon language has taken on a life beyond its use in various Star Trek motion pictures and television series; one can hear it spoken fluently by fans of all ages at science fiction conventions and even in casual conversation. 23 Roger Fowler ( 1995) absorbing study of Orwell's language is easily the most outstanding exception. 24 See Whorf essay \"Science and Linguistics,\"207-19 in Language, Thought and Reality ( 1956); see also Edward Sapir Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech ( 1921), 12-17. -15-\n\n2 \"Plus 'Parfaite' et Moins Libre\" Brave New World ( 1932) reacts against what Aldous Huxley saw as the utopian tradition's dangerously short-sighted assumptions, particularly those that inform much of the fiction of H. G. Wells. As with George Orwell and Anthony Burgess--modern writers who have considered themselves neither dystopian novelists nor science fiction writers--Huxley wrote more than one dystopia, as well as a straightforward utopia, Island ( 1962). 1 Of Huxley's farranging œuvre, Brave New World is the novel that most readers associate with his name and that commands the largest modern audience. 2 Brave New World is not the first great dystopia of the twentieth century, however. That honor belongs to Eugene Zamiatin's We, which was completed in 1921 but never published in his native Russia. Zamiatin's novel circulated around Europe for years, first in manuscript and later in published English, Czech, and French translations. 3 Zamiatin draws a stunning dystopic portrait of a far-future society where a dictator referred to as \"The Benefactor\" rules absolutely. All citizens are referred to by number; the protagonist and first-person narrator is called D-503. Orwell was acquainted with Zamiatin's novel, and elements of We can be found in Nineteen Eighty-four. Furthermore, \"some critics have suggested that [ Huxley] also owes a great deal to Zamiatin's We. Huxley, though, denied having read We. There is no evidence, other than perhaps coincidental\n\nsimilarities between the two novels, to indicate Huxley borrowed from Zamiatin\" ( Matter 1983, 106). Firchow notes that Zamiatin himself inquired into whether Huxley had read We, and discovered that he had not ( 1984, 121-22). -17Despite the fact that We was written twelve years before Huxley published Brave New World, most scholars point to Huxley's novel as the seminal dystopia of the twentieth century. Much of the difference between these novels' receptions lies in the disparity of their authors' contemporary reputations. Zamiatin was not widely known outside a small circle of admirers in Europe: when he died in France in 1937, he left behind a small corpus of short stories, essays, a few plays, and one other novel ( Rudy 1975, v-vii). We is Zamiatin's longest and most sustained work, and his modern reputation rests almost solely on it. However, the book was little known for years after Zamiatin's death. By contrast, Brave New World was Huxley fifth novel, written at the peak of his literary powers. At the time of its publication, Huxley was the preeminent figure in the vanguard of English intellectual and literary culture. His name alone conveyed a mood of ironic social and literary criticism, reflecting his talent for propounding shocking new ideas while attacking works and theories he considered hopelessly outdated. The prolific Huxley published eleven novels, numerous essays and short stories, plays, poetry, a biography, travel sketches, and a large collection of letters. Finally, while We was smuggled about and surreptitiously published in small editions--Orwell laments the difficulties he faced in borrowing a French translation after an English edition proved impossible to acquire ( Howe 1982, 259)--Huxley's novel was immediately popular in Britain and the United States. 4 In addition, there are more fundamental thematic and formal distinctions to be drawn between We and Brave New World. While the dystopian novel in English has flourished, We is the sole Russian dystopia of this century to enjoy an international audience. Furthermore, despite the fact that he describes a radically altered society, Huxley's prose is straightforward enough. Zamiatin, however, experiments, not only with ideas of social structures, but stylistically as well: [ Zamiatin] attempted to carry out his conviction that form should keep up with ideas, that only a heretical form could adequately dramatize heretical ideas. . . . The novel uses the notebook format. . . . As the narrator's emotional state changes, his perception moves between the extreme limits of objectivity and subjectivity. There is a dramatic running duel between the rational and irrational forces within him, a shifting between his conscious and unconscious powers of perception, and a constant association of ideas that forms elaborate networks. Accompanying this psychological method is a laconic language that frequently lapses into the provocatively elliptical and imparts a sensation of breathlessness. Compressed and startlingly strange similes and metaphors . . . not only serve the conventional purpose of intensifying the description of a person or object, but they also sharply characterize the narrator and his environment; they are frequently linked to an individual through so much repetition that they attain an impressionistic force. ( Rudy 1975, x) The novel's style is best described as surrealistic, especially given the abundance of unconnected images that D-503 passes on to the reader--frequently without context or apparent relationship to the rest of his story. E. J. Brown describes the situation in this way:\n\nWe is very different from its descendants not only in structure and style, but particularly in its quality of ironic humor. Huxley's novel is heavy-handed and obvious by comparison, and Orwell's pictures of the new world do not amuse us, as Zamiatin's do for the most part, but rather terrify and warn us. The difference is -18simply that Orwell was afraid of his enemy, exaggerated his power, and tried to communicate to the reader his own apprehension. Zamiatin's mood is one of ironic contempt for collectivists and cosmists. ( 1988, 223-24) Brown overstates the case in favor of We. Despite its brilliance, We's subtlety lessens its impact as social criticism. Furthermore, it is nearly impossible to follow Brown and ignore Huxley's \"ironic contempt,\" although his targets are not collectivists but rather those who believe that science alone can solve humanity's problems. Despite We's richness and its chronological primacy, Brave New World was more widely known to its contemporary audience, and remains so today. Brave New World was the first widely read dystopia in English. Accordingly, its influence has been enormous\" ( Matter 1983, 107). Huxley's novel serves as an ideal starting point for this study, since questions of language play a role in creating the nightmarish Brave New World State. Huxley begins reworking the utopian form right away; indeed, on the first page, readers find themselves touring the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, \"a squat grey building of only thirty-four stories.\" 5 Huxley eschews the conventional exposition of a confident utopian patiently answering at length the questions of a bewildered visitor; instead, he plunges the reader straight into the world of London, circa the year A.F. (After Ford) 632, tagging along after \"a troop of newly arrived students, very young, pink and callow\" ( 1947, 2). As if fulfilling Suvin's ( 1979) criterion of estrangement in its structure as well as in content, the novel opens in medias res and showers the reader with a series of unexplained details. So much of the appeal of any utopian work depends on its initial sense of mystery and the reader's correspondent demand for an explanation. . . . Huxley suddenly introduces the reader into a new world, and it is not until the momentum with which puzzling details are presented slows down that one becomes an informed visitor and is ready for an explanation of how the society one lives in has become the society one is reading about ( Meckier 1969, 184) 6 The shock of the new culture owes much of its effectiveness to the narrative structure Huxley creates in the opening chapters. Rather than using a single narrator, Huxley allows the reader to eavesdrop on several conversations. The content of these conversational snippets, as well as their contexts, indicates which characters are speaking. We move quickly from one conversation to another in a series of jump cuts: at first we \"hear\" entire paragraphs expressing complete thoughts, but as the chapter progresses we hear shorter and shorter bits of each conversation before jumping to the next. As the chapter concludes, the pace has quickened to the point that we hear mostly phrases and only occasionally a complete sentence from each speaker. In general, those facts that we discover about the World State are indirectly expressed. Firchow refers to this eavesdropping technique as \"counterpoint,\" since Huxley\n\nhad used it most fully before in Point Counter Point ( 1929), though there are intimations of it as early as Those Barren Leaves ( 1925). This technique involves a simultaneous juxtaposition of different elements of the narrative, much as musical counterpoint means sounding different notes simultaneously. . . . The result in music is--or should be--a complex harmony; in Huxley's fiction the result is, usually, a complex dissonance, a subtle and often brilliant cacophony of ironies. The third chapter of Brave New World is set up entirely in this kind of counterpoint, gathering -19together the various narrative strains of the first two chapters and juxtaposing them without any editorial comment, slowly at first and then with gathering momentum, climaxing in a crescendo that fuses snatches of Mond's lecture, Lenina's conversation with Fanny, Henry Foster's with Benito Hoover [sic; the Assistant Predestinator], Bernard Marx's resentful thoughts, and bits of hypnopædie wisdom. ( 1984, 15) Huxley's opening chapters introduce most of the important characters while simultaneously revealing the cornerstone on which the World State's stability rests. The State controls reproduction: all births begin with in vitro fertilization using carefully screened sperm and ova. Once fertilized, some eggs are permitted to develop normally into single fetuses. 7 Most undergo Bokanovsky's Process, in which near-lethal doses of alcohol, radiation, and refrigeration force the fertilized eggs to divide continually ( 1947, 3-5). The process yields huge numbers of identical humans--\"ninety-six seemed to be the limit; seventy-two a good average\" ( 1947, 5). The State manipulates the developing fetuses into five separate castes. Alphas and Betas, who are destined for careers as managers, leaders, educators and scientists, are given special treatment by being left alone, while the remaining three castes, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons are progressively retarded so as to grow physically smaller and less mentally capable than normal. During the gestation period, all fetuses are chemically and environmentally conditioned to whatever ends the State deems necessary. Those destined to work in the tropics are conditioned to prefer heat, while those fated to perform in-flight repairs to high-altitude rocket planes are conditioned to prefer being upside-down (12-13). Once \"decanted\" (the word born, as well as the biological process it describes, are considered obscene) all children are already well on their way to fulfilling whatever destiny best serves the exigencies of the State. The conditioning process continues from infancy onward through the further methods of hypnopædia (\"sleep teaching,\" a term Huxley coined in this novel) and \"neo-Pavlovian conditioning\" (essentially aversion therapy). Neo-Pavlovian conditioning links socially undesirable traits to unpleasant experiences, as when toddlers enjoying picture books and bowls of roses are subjected to terrifying loud noises and electric shocks. \"A love of nature for its own sake keeps no factories busy\" ( 1947, 18), while books are even more dangerous since \"there [is] always the risk of . . . reading something which might undesirably decondition one of their reflexes\" ( 1947, 17-18). Huxley's society fears the printed word as perhaps the only force that can permanently subvert years of careful conditioning. This threat is countered by a policy of appropriating words, stripping them of undesirable meaning, and using them to further extend State conditioning. Since \"wordless conditioning . . . cannot bring home the finer distinctions, cannot inculcate the more complex courses of behaviour[,] . . . there must be words, but words without reason. In brief, hypnopædia\" (23). While children sleep in State nurseries, speakers beneath their pillows whisper lessons in orthodox morality: one's own caste is best, group identity is superior to that of the individual, consumption is a\n\npleasant civic duty, and so forth. After subconsciously absorbing such lessons, each of which is repeated thousands of times, \"the sum of these suggestions is the child's mind. . . . The adult's mind too--all his life long\" (23). Individuals will never feel that the State is encroaching on their liberties, since the State carefully molds their concept of liberty in the first place. As the Director puts it, \"that is the secret of -20happiness and virtue--liking what you've got to do. All conditioning aims at that: making people like their unescapable social destiny\" (12). That destiny may at first appear idyllic. Earth in A.F. 632 is united in a World State, which promises its citizens \"Community, Identity, Stability\" ( 1947, 1). Ten World Controllers (including Mustapha Mond, the resident Controller for Western Europe) oversee society and keep everything running smoothly. All citizens have jobs, which are assigned by the State, but none finds their labor excessive or difficult since the workers have been created to perform specific tasks. Despite the fact that each person works for only a few hours, \"spare time\" is an obsolete concept--as is any idea having to do with individual choice or even time spent alone: the World Citizens view solitude with horror. Every waking moment not spent on the job is devoted to consuming State-produced entertainment, from equipment-intensive sports like Obstacle Golf and Reimann-Surface Tennis to synthetic music, feeling pictures (\"the Feelies\"), community sings, television, and travel. Promiscuity is the norm, and is actively encouraged by the State--but not with the same partner for very long, since long-term attachments threaten the social fabric. 8 The perfect drug, soma, is freely available to all citizens; it has no unpleasant side effects and guarantees hours of pleasant sensations and beautiful hallucinations. Handicaps, disease, and even obesity are unknown, and old age has been eliminated--citizens remain vigorous and healthy until age sixty or so, at which time they die quickly and painlessly. The State provides ceremonies that substitute for religion, such as the Orgy-Porgy, in which worshippers fall into a drugged frenzy as they celebrate the coming of an imaginary \"Greater Being.\" 9 A knowledge of history no longer exists, having been done away with by the State, and it never occurs to most citizens to think about a future since the present euphoric state of affairs promises to continue forever. The only living remnants of other cultures are aboriginal ones, which pose no threat to the World State: these are forcibly enclosed within high-security areas known as Savage Reservations. Not every citizen is happy, though. Bernard Marx works for the Psychology Bureau of the Conditioning Centre as an expert on hypnopædia; Helmholtz Watson lectures at the College of Emotional Engineering in the Department of Writing. Two more different men could hardly be found in one caste of the Brave New World. Bernard is shorter and scrawnier than his Alpha-Plus colleagues and is derided as a result, whereas Helmholtz is so physically perfect and intellectually gifted that he stands out from his fellow Alpha-Plus brethren. \"What the two men [share is] the knowledge that they [are] individuals\" ( 1947, 55). Brought together by this one similarity--for they know of no others like themselves--Helmholtz and Bernard spend hours discussing their strange feelings of individuality, trying to make sense of their personal identities in a society where personal identity does not exist. Bernard cannot escape into the mindless whirl of sex and soma he despises, although he wishes he could do so. Helmholtz distances himself from this whirl in search of something that he cannot clearly articulate but toward which he feels strong creative urges and wishing to find out what it means to be alone. Both Helmholtz and Bernard are wordsmiths, keenly aware of the ends to\n\nwhich their writing is put: for example, Bernard recognizes hypnopedic suggestions he has written when speakers around him articulate what they believe to be original thoughts. -21Huxley also wrote \"Ape and Essence\" ( 1948), a savage dystopia that nonetheless provides a third option, which is only hinted at in Brave New World: the opportunity to flee the repressive society and join a small group of likeminded rebels. Meckier calls this alternative to assimilation or destruction \"the all-important trap door of justifiable escape\" ( 1969, 189). Brave New World Revisited ( 1958) foregrounds Huxley's warning that precision in language is the first line of defense against the development of repressive societies like the one in his own Brave New World. Finally, Island ( 1962) finds Huxley turning his earlier dystopias upside down to create a utopian community on the fictional island of Pala. Huxley's problematical final novel (published a year before his death) responds almost point-by-point to what he had written thirty years earlier in Brave New World--and language is at the heart of it, as the visiting Will Farnaby finds, through \"giving the [Palanese] children systematic and carefully graduated training in perception and the proper use of language. . . . [T]hey're asked to notice . . . how their language habits affect not only their feelings and desires but even their sensations\" ( 1962, 243). Huxley's concern with language substantially informs Brave New World. Baker argues that Huxley borrowed this concern from H. G. Wells When the Sleeper Wakes ( 1899): 10 One feature of Wells's novel is especially characteristic of the dystopian narrative-the preoccupation with communications media and language. The [workers] are controlled by an elaborate system of propaganda, including a network of Babble Machines designed to implant \"counter suggestions in the cause of law and order\" [ Wells 1924, 392]. The oppressed workers also speak a debased dialect. This motif of language will recur in the dystopias of Zamiatin, Huxley, and Orwell, only in more complexly subtle forms. ( Baker 1990, 37) Regardless of whether Huxley inherited his dystopic interest in the role of language from Wells, he certainly expressed it more subtly. Brave New World does not reveal a government forcing a thought-restricting language on its populace. Rather, Huxley shows us a society that engineers its population from conception on and then fulfills all the desires that it has conditioned in them. The citizens of the Brave New World State do not consider themselves repressed. They do not long for things that the State has done away with. On the contrary, some words for outdated concepts still exist but have been debased into vapidity (love), smutty humor (marriage) or even obscenity (especially the term mother). As far as the vast majority of citizens are concerned, complete happiness and social harmony have been brought about at no cost to themselves. Except in a handful of malcontents like Helmholtz Watson and authority figures like Mustapha Mond, there is no perception that social stability has been bought at a high price. That price includes the destruction of history and the deterioration of language. History is bunk, and bunkum has all but replaced history. Only Mustapha Mond shows any awareness of how the World State has evolved from the society that Huxley's contemporary readers would recognize. The family, parent-child bonds, romance, monogamous marriage, and all other relationships that create powerful emotions have been eliminated as detrimental to the State. Doing away with history has meant, of course, destroying the historical records. By\n\nexpunging the written word of what has been, the World State can substitute its own version of the past--or, as it chooses to do, a scenario that posits the -22past's nonexistence. Huxley does not include specific details as to how this purging of books has been accomplished other than to throw out a few hints that direct repression failed: \"in the end . . . the Controllers realized that force was no good. The slower but infinitely surer methods of ectogenesis, neo-Pavlovian conditioning and hypnopædia\" were coupled with a campaign \"against the Past; by the closing of museums, the blowing up of historical monuments (luckily most of them had already been destroyed during the Nine Years' War); by the suppression of all books published before A.F. 150\" ( 1947, 41-42). Another of Henry Ford's maxims has been elevated to the level of social dogma: \"I don't like to read books[;] . . . they mess up my mind.\" 11 Suppressing books destroys, not only history, but also philosophy, literature, poetry, drama--in sum, conveniently eliminating unorthodox thought and its challenges to the State. How such destruction could be carried out successfully without the use of force is never mentioned. However, Huxley's concern is not the suppression of the past or of literature itself, but the social changes brought about by that suppression. It remained for Orwell to examine directly how a repressive state could go about destroying literature and accounts of the past that conflicted with its own version. By the same process, religion has been disposed of except for an officially sanctioned faith that gives restless citizens an outlet for their need to worship. \"The once powerful theological term 'predestination' now means little more than suiting people to an 'unescapable social destiny' [ Huxley 1947, 121]\" ( Meckier 19699, 182). Westminster Abbey has been turned into a cabaret ( Huxley 1947, 62). Henry Ford has been deified into Our Ford--conflated with Sigmund Freud when discussing human psychology (31)--and his assembly-line methods are now applied, not only to manufacturing but, moreover, to maintaining the social fabric from conception to cremation. All crosses have been lopped into Ts; where we expect to see permutations of the word Lord, we instead find Ford (as in \"your Fordship,\" \"Fordy!\"); and historical events, if discussed at all, are spoken of as happening in relation to the year in which \"Our Ford's first TModel was put on the market\" (20). Unknowingly echoing Browning, the Director of Hatcheries expresses his satisfaction with the social order by declaring that \"Ford's in his flivver. . . . All's well with the world\" (36). \"Worst of all, language has virtually lost its meaning and few speakers in this model world of scientifically engineered precision realize how unscientific and imprecise their words really are\" ( Meckier 1969, 181). Doing away with literature has severely affected the use of language. Other than insipid popular music--\"There ain't no Bottle in all the world like that dear little Bottle of mine\" ( Huxley 1947, 62)--there are no models to guide usage and no means available to expand vocabulary or experiment with structure. Human languages and other cultural differences have been severely reduced by the World State, since stability requires mutual understanding between different peoples. Some languages, like \"Zuñi and Spanish and Athapascan,\" are nearly extinct, surviving only in the Savage Reservations (85), while others, including French, German, and Polish, are completely dead (18). Huxley has his tongue firmly in cheek when he notes that \"it was lucky that Bernard didn't understand Zuñi\" (149). The Savage need not speak Zuñi in order to keep secrets, his Shakespearean English being sufficiently impenetrable to those around him--\"for Ford's sake, John, talk sense. I can't understand a word you say\" cries Lenina, to whom his references to The Tempest are nonsense ( Huxley 1947, 162).\n\n-23Brian Aldiss, who calls Brave New World \"arguably the Western world's most famous science fiction novel,\" asks \"Isn't one of the delights of [ Huxley's dystopia], when all is said and pontificated, that it is told with a perfect balance of wit and humour?\" (in Aldiss and Wingrove 1986, 184-85). Huxley repeatedly lightens the tone of his novel with the \"agreeable weapons\" (185) of satiric witticisms, which amuse at first, until their full meaning becomes clear. One of the synchronous narratives in Chapter 3 finds Lenina Crowne talking to Fanny Crowne in the Hatchery's women's dressing rooms. The two are not related, \"but as the [two billion] inhabitants of the planet had only ten thousand names between them, the coincidence was not particularly surprising\" ( Huxley 1947, 29). The reader may smile when thinking of the humorous situations that will inevitably occur given such a paucity of names, but a moment's thought makes one wonder why there are so few names for so many people. The answer, simply put, is that the World State removes another dangerous tendency toward individual identity by making sure that not even one's name distinguishes one from other citizens. Still, some names involve puns. For example, Henry Foster conducts ovarian research in the Hatchery, with the aim of producing increasing numbers of new workers. ( Firchow suggests that Huxley may also be referring to Sir Michael Foster [ 1836-1907], a British embryologist who had been, like H. G. Wells, an assistant to Huxley's grandfather T. H. Huxley [46].) Similarly, Mustapha Mond is one of the ten World Controllers. 12 Huxley further satirizes a number of contemporary and historical individuals in the names he gives his characters: As in the old allegorical fables, Huxley gives many of his characters names which symbolize his particular bêtes noires. Together, they add up to a fairly comprehensive indictment of western thought and achievement since the Enlightenment. . . . The Left gets a trouncing in Polly Trotsky, Sarojini Engels, Herbert Bakunin, Lenina Crowne, and Bernard Marx. For Huxley, Socialism and Marxism, as the latest variants of scientific rationalism, differed from other varieties only in their greater arrogance and fanaticism, a judgment the Russian Revolution and the new Soviet State had done nothing to shake. He naturally had no greater faith in right-wing dictators or large capitalists, who are rebuffed in Benito Hoover and Primo Mellon, the last also doubling for capitalists along with Morgana Rothschild. Technology gets its due in George Edsel, Joanna Diesel, and Clara Deterding, and science its brickbat in Darwin Bonaparte, Bernard Marx, and Helmholtz Watson. Watson is also Huxley's backhanded tribute to the founder of behaviourism in psychology, and therefore a key influence in the new society. ( Kumar 1987, 243) Huxley lampoons capitalists in Morgana's name, suggesting J. P. Morgan, and one can hardly overlook Benito Hoover as an ironic jab at Herbert Hoover, president of the United States at the time of Brave New World's composition and already infamous for asserting that \"the business of America is business.\" 13 Darwin Bonaparte suggests another right-wing dictator of note, as does Mustapha Mond (recalling the Turkish nationalist leader Kemal Ataturk Mustapha). Social theorists and writers are criticized with names like Fifi Bradlaugh and JeanJacques Habibullah (whose last name may recall Habibullah Khan) ( Firchow 1984, 83). Upon his arrival from Malpais, John is christened \"The Savage,\" harking back to Rousseau-but John's nobility is matched by his fanatical inability to adapt to the society that he names the Brave New World, echoing Shakespeare. 14 Huxley damns Henry Ford and Ivan Pavlov by adopting their names directly, Ford as the World State's patron saint and Pavlov as the pioneer -24-\n\nof the behavioral conditioning so necessary to the State. In fact, the Central London Hatchery contains an entire block of floors, the \"Neo-Pavlovian Conditioning Rooms,\" given over to hypnopedic and aversion conditioning. Huxley pokes at H. G. Wells by having Fanny Crowne refer to the \"Dr. Wells\" who advised her to undergo a Pregnancy Substitute ( 1947, 31). Huxley reserves his harshest treatment for another famous Fabian Socialist, George Bernard Shaw. To begin with, Bernard Marx is intellectually gifted but essentially a coward, unwilling to stand up for what he believes. Furthermore, the Director of Hatcheries explains that the first discovery of hypnopædia occurred when a radio left on overnight broadcast Shaw declaiming on the subject of his own genius, an address that a young Polish boy wakes up repeating, despite not understanding English (20). The ironic dig is clear. Shaw's words are merely inconsequential babble, a judgment sealed by the fact that Shaw is \"one of the very few whose works have been permitted to come down to us,\" as the Director notes (20). As Mond makes clear to the touring students, nearly all literature published before the year A.F. 150 has been suppressed (42); the fact that Shaw's works are not forbidden points to their essential harmlessness and their inability to disrupt conditioning. Jerome Meckier suggests that at least one name that Huxley used is more gently ironic, more accusatory of society than of the individual to whom it belongs: Helmholtz Watson's name, a curious amalgam of Hermann Ludwig von Helmholtz ( 18211894), the German scientist, and Sir William Watson ( 1858-1935), an English poet, seems to imply that science and art are now united, but innocuously so, in the job of furnishing slogans for the state. In fact, the famous names of these characters form a pointed contrast to a World State that is simply one of Henry Ford's Detroit plants magnified many times. ( 1969, 181) Matter further argues that sporting with characters' names is meant to \"remind the reader of similar linguistic witticisms in More's Utopia and Samuel Butler's Erewhon\" ( 1983, 106). Huxley toys with some place names and names of landmarks as well, to ironic effect. Since all crosses have been cut in deference to Our Ford, London's Charing Cross has become Charing T, and as Bernard arrives at the Fordson Community Singery, he hears Big Henry, its clock-tower bell, toll the hour. Firchow concisely asserts Huxley's reason for making so much of names, which is not merely that from the perspective of distant time the concerns of the present fuse together into a single whole. . . . Rather, what Huxley seems to be implying is that all of the dynamic political forces of the twentieth century, no matter how divergent they appear on the surface, are really tending in the same direction, that of the new world state. . . . All are fundamentally materialist. . . . They all glorify machines and modern technology. They all . . . subordinate the individual to the claims of a collective whole. . . . Moreover, aside from these general resemblances, there seem to be quite specific links between each one of these political systems of the twentieth century and the new world state: from fascism comes the caste system; from communism, the emphasis on conditioning and propaganda; and from democratic capitalism the economy oriented toward lavish and purposeless production and consumption. ( 1984, 83-84) -25Beneath the irony of Huxley's naming lies a society whose literature and language are almost completely devoid of real meaning. Words still exist, but the concepts for which they stand\n\nhave been altered. Love no longer connotes an emotional bond, only sexual activity; conventionality equals promiscuity; calling a woman pneumatic is a compliment rather than an insult; and stability means a society in which infantilism is not only encouraged, but enforced. Characters speak, but the import of what they say escapes them: What happens to the meaning of normality when Mr. Foster explains he wants to give the Epsilon embryo \"the normality of dogs and cows\"? . . . From chapter to chapter the destruction of the meaning of words proceeds apace. Foster explains that childhood has been abolished because the years between an Epsilon's birth and the time he is fit for work constitute a \"superfluous and wasted immaturity.\" Yet the Epsilon's so-called maturity is scarcely that of a five-year-old. Surely this is no great improvement on the treatment of children in nineteenth-century England. ( Meckier 1969, 181-82) Huxley repeatedly refers to items that substitute for other things: \"bloodsurrogate,\" \"moroccosurrogate,\" \"Pregnancy Substitute,\" \"oboe-surrogate,\" \"Violent Passion Surrogate,\" \"vitaminized beef-surrogate.\" New words refer to things that have been altered, ostensibly for the better, with the originals no longer in evidence: \"hyper-violin,\" \"super-cornet,\" \"panglandular biscuits,\" \"super-doves.\" Some things seem familiar enough but have been renamed, and their strangeness makes us wonder if they are, in fact, the same. Is \"boiling caffeine solution\" a cup of tea, coffee--or what? When an infant finishes sucking a pint of \"pasteurized external secretion,\" is it cows' milk, human milk, goats' milk--or is it milk at all? What is \"synthetic music,\" and how does it differ from normal music? Is a \"synthetic-talking\" Feely (\"feeling picture\") somehow different from a talking Feely? Since the characters take these things for granted, the questions are not answered within the narrative. Language and meaning diverge, as the artificial stability of the World State depends on arresting the population's development. It is vital to maintain a changeless status quo, an eternal present that admits of no past and expects no change in the future: When Lenina describes her Malthusian belt, itself a preventive or substitution device, as \"real morocco-surrogate\" [ Huxley 1947, 43], one realizes how confused the relation between things and words has become. Can individuals who have not blood but \"blood surrogate\" in their veins be termed human at all? The fact that women must take a \"Pregnancy Substitute\" [31] to satisfy maternal urges underlines the extent to which Brave New World, in words and objects, is a world of facsimiles behind which certain genuine human feelings faintly persist. ( Meckier 1969, 182) Bernard returns from the Savage Reservation and brings John into this world, where language has been devalued and literature is outlawed. His education has been a narrow one, despite his aptitude for learning. After a few simple lessons from his mother, Linda, John essentially teaches himself to read. Ostracized from Native American boys because of his mother's promiscuity and his disheveled appearance, John seizes on his ability to read as a refuge from their taunts: \"'I can read,' he said to himself, 'and they can't. They don't even know what reading is.' It was fairly easy, if he thought hard enough about the reading, to pretend that he didn't mind when they made fun of him\" ( Huxley 1947, 109). John knows only two books: his mother's copy of The Chemical and Bacteriological -26Conditioning of the Embryo: Practical Instructions for Beta Embryo-Store Workers and The Complete Works of William Shakespeare. The latter, in the form of an ancient book, is\n\nbrought for him by Popé, one of Linda's lovers. The former work is virtually useless to John except as an exercise in syllabification and simple reading skills. But while much of Shakespeare's meaning is closed to him, John instantly finds Shakespearean English fascinating. When he first picks up the book, it falls open to Hamlet III, iv as Hamlet reproaches Gertrude for her marriage to Claudius: The strange words rolled through his mind; rumbled, like talking thunder; like the drums at the summer dances, if the drums could have spoken; like the men singing the Corn Song, beautiful, beautiful, so that you cried; like old Mitsima saying magic over his feathers and his carved sticks and his bits of bone and stone--kiathla tsilu silokwe silokwe silokwe. Kiai silu silu, tsithl--but better than Mitsima's magic, because it meant more, because it talked to him; talked wonderfully and only halfunderstandingly, a terrible beautiful magic, about Linda; about Linda lying there snoring, with the empty cup on the floor beside the bed; about Linda and Popé, Linda and Popé ( 110 -11) The \"terrible beautiful magic\" of Shakespeare's language, which John only half comprehends, stands apart from the World State's cultural inanities. Upon first reading Hamlet, John is profoundly moved, shaken by the power of the words themselves. To him, their precise definitions are less important than the intense emotions they cause in him, and even the strongest passion he already feels--jealousy over the affections of his mother, Linda--is magnified by Shakespeare's language: He hated Popé more and more. A man can smile and smile and be a villain. Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain. What did the words exactly mean? He only half knew. But their magic was strong and went on rumbling in his head, and somehow it was as though he had never really hated Popé before; never really hated him because he had never been able to say how much he hated him. But now he had these words . . . and the strange, strange story out of which they were taken (he couldn't make head or tail of it, but it was wonderful, wonderful all the same)--they gave him a reason for hating Popé; and they made his hatred more real; they even made Popé himself more real. ( 111 ) Coming to him sometime around his twelfth birthday, the Shakespeare volume marks the end of John's childhood and propels him into the beginning of his adult consciousness. One of the most important meanings carried by Shakespeare's works in Brave New World lies in the enormity of John's reaction to them. If we accept that \"John does not learn to hate Popé until Shakespeare gives him the necessary words\" ( Matter 1983, 106), then it follows that it is, in large part, the words that create the emotion he feels: Long ago the World Controllers decided that society must cut itself off from its depressing past when motherhood was in flower. One of the most inspired phrases of Ford is that \"history is bunk.\" The great writers and historians of the old world concerned themselves with man's struggles, his cravings, his failures, and his successes. Such emotions would shake the foundations of the new society. In a like manner, emotive language would injure the social cell. The World Controllers appear to agree with [ Benjamin Lee] Whorf's theory of linguistic relativity, which suggests -27-\n\nthat people who have no words to express antisocial sentiments cannot think antisocially. ( Matter 1983, 105-6) Bluntly, Huxley affirms the Controllers' concern with Whorf's theory (despite the fact that Whorf did not publish this theory until 1940, eight years after the first publication of Brave New World). Old books have been banned because the Controllers fear that a citizen's conditioning might be upset by reading even a few pages--which is exactly what happens when John reads several lines from Hamlet, despite the fact that he cannot make any sense of the story. However, John's reading of Shakespeare does not disrupt his conditioning because Shakespeareis his conditioning. Furthermore, John does not adopt Elizabethan values so much as he accepts Shakespeare's language as a value in itself. He has very little understanding of what the wonderful words actually mean, in context or out of it; when he spouts Shakespearean dialogue, he expresses his mood without clearly articulating his state of mind. John's adoption of Elizabethan language and the emotional attitudes of Shakespeare's characters confirms what his unwitting father, the Director of Hatcheries, has already noted to his students: hypnopædia is no use \"as an instrument of intellectual education,\" but it is a peerless tool for moral education, \"which ought never, in any circumstances, to be rational\" ( Huxley 1947, 20-21).
