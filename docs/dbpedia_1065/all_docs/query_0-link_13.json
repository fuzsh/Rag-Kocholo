McCRACKEN A NEW AGE BEGINS: AMERICA'S DIMINISHED ROLE IN THE WORLD ECONOMY* I In a recent issue of Foreign Affairs, the journal of the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations, Robert W. Tucker looked back ruefully at the decade just past. His conclusion probably commands universal assent: The last year of the 1970s confirmed and carried measurably forward the major trends of a decade. Viewed from an American perspective, the principal developments of 1979 registered the continued decline in the nation's international position.' Indeed, this is also the way 1979's trends would appear from the perspective of Japan or Europe. Certainly, Professor Tucker would seem to be on firm ground in terms of the international political position of the United States. It would be difficult to point to any major successes in our foreign policy during recent years, though perhaps the exchange of ambassadors between Egypt and Israel, and the Panama Canal treaty, belong in that category. Setbacks come to mind fairly easily. Presumably the most fundamental deterioration not only for the United States but also for Japan, Western Europe, and the liberal economies generally, would be developments in the Middle East and the ominous questions they raise about the availability of oil. In 1979 and 1980 countries throughout the world found themselves forced to contemplate very intensively the awesome, even Stygian, situation they would confront if oil supplies from the Arabian Gulf *This is a revised version of a paper presented to a conference sponsored by the Mitsubishi Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan, 7 April 1980. 'Robert W. Tucker, \"America in Decline: The Foreign Policy of 'Maturity\"', Foreign Affairs, Vol. 58, No. 3, p. 449.\n\nPage 2 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW were interdicted. The fact that the turn of events has forced us even to think about such an unimaginable prospect is itself eloquent evidence that these trends have not been moving our way. Though international political and economic developments are inextricably intertwined, if we focus more specifically on economic developments the role and position of the United States seem also to have been moving in the downward direction. To some extent, of course, a receding dominance of the U.S. in the world economy was not only to be expected but even to be desired. Three decades ago the American economies (Canada and the United States) almost alone had emerged from the war with their production capabilities undamaged, and it is worth recalling that for the first half of that period the world's major concern was whether the fragile and rebuilding economies of Japan and Western Europe would ever be able to compete effectively with the huge and dominant economy in North America. During my first tour of duty with the President's Council of Economic Advisers, as a Member, in the late 1950s, I found myself at O. E.-E.-C. (now 0. E.GC. D.) meetings in Paris pressed hard for American proposals that would relieve the tendency of the American economy to run an overly-strong external payments position. What, other nations demanded, was the United States going to do to relieve the seemingly perpetual dollar shortage? In those days that was the urgent and perennial question. Two decades ago the U. S. alone accounted for about 27 percent of the world's gross national product, compared with roughly 5 percent each for Japan and the U.K. and 7 percent for the Federal Republic of Germany. And at that time the U.S. also accounted for 18 percent of total world trade, about five times the 3.6 percent share of Japan. The fact that the U.S. share of world GNP has now declined to just over 20 percent and our share of world trade is 12 percent could be cited as evidence that the international economy has been making progress in what should have been, and was, a major objective of economic policy-namely, a greater diffusion of economic well-being internationally. For no major economy has the favorable result of this diffusion been more evident than in the case of Japan, which in two decades has roughly doubled its share of world GNP and world trade. Indeed, it has now by any relevant test matured to the status of one\n\nPage 3 PAUL W. McCRACKEN of the world's richest and most powerful economies. This normal diffusion of economic well-being is clearly not, however, the end of the economic story. The fact is that the American economy has not been performing well in recent years, and this deterioration in our performance seems to be accelerating. This is true of all three of the major parameters of the economy's performance (inflation, gains in real income, and unemployment). The U.S. has, of course, had a persistently rising rate of inflation since the mid1970s, and the deterioration in the domestic purchasing power of the dollar really goes back to the mid-1960s. Moreover, the price level, as measured by the consumer price index, rose 13 percent during 1979, a pace that continued in 1980, and the rise during early 1980 was in the 18 percent zone. Such a recent history of high rates for the U.S. producer price index does not suggest good news for consumer prices in the immediate future. That inflation at these rates is producing profound social as well as economic unease is understandable enough. With inflation at last year's rate for the C. P.JI., an American man retiring at age 65 on a fixed pension, and living the further 15 years indicated by the life insurance tables, will find at the end that his pension check has lost 88 percent of its original purchasing power. And if the retiring person were a woman, her pension check at the end would have a mere 5 percent of its original purchasing power remaining (because of her greater average longevity). It is not difficult to understand that older people are beginning to reflect an unease almost approaching terror as they reach the point of disengaging from a payroll and confronting retirement. Moreover, the U. S. economy seems to have reached the stage where it is incapable of generating gains in productivity and real income. In the mid-1960s, the economy's capability to generate these gains began to weaken. Fron 1965 to 1973, gains in output per man hour for the nonfarm private economy dropped to 2. 0 percent per year. The serious deterioration began to occur in the mid-1970s, however, as the average annual gain in productivity dropped to 0. 8 percent from 1973 to 1978, and preliminary evidence for 1979 and 1980 indicates an actual decline. And to complete the funereal jeremiad of our three major parameters, the level of unemployment has also remained high. The un\n\nPage 4 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW employment rate was 7 percent in 1980, about the average for the final five years of the last decade. II This record of performance for the American economy is deeply disappointing in part because it is so out of line with previous history. For the fact is that the American economy has had a record through history of delivering a reasonably stable price level, high employment, and gains in productivity and real incomes adequate to double material levels of living every generation. Because Americans are not much given to reviewing history, a brief reminder of this record may be useful here. From 1900 to 1965, the average annual rate of increase in the price level, as measured by the consumer price index, was 2.1 percent per year, and if the discontinuous jumps in the price level associated with the two major wars (and the exogenous down-draft incident of the Great Depression) are eliminated the average annual rise in this index for the 41 remaining years that would still be included was 1.2 percent. This average consists of 1.7 percent per year for the years 1900 to 1916, 1.6 percent annually from 1948 to 1965, and a decline of 0.5 percent per year from 1921 to 1929. High rates of inflation have not characterized our history, and up to the mid-1960s there was no clear evidence of any growing inflationary bias during this first two-thirds of the century. Our heritage of a reasonably stable price level is, of course, of even longer duration. For what it is worth the consumer price index as we entered World War I was at about the same level as for the first decade of the nineteenth century. While there had been sharp swings around this long-run trend, the century-long trend itself had been essentially flat or even moderately downward. And this long-run stability in the purchasing power of money powerfully influenced our thinking about how individuals and businesses ought to account for costs and profits, put their savings to work, and plan for retirement years. The U.S. economy also has traditionally operated at high levels of employment. During the first three decades of this century the unemployment rate averaged 4.7 percent, roughly the same as from 1948 to 1965. Even during the first decade of this century, when the labor force grew at the rate of 2.6 percent per year (a slightly higher rate\n\nPage 5 PAUL W. McCRACKEN than during the 1970s), the unemployment rate for the decade averaged only 4.5 percent. Finally, our heritage has also been one of strong and steady gains in real income-rapid enough, as mentioned earlier, to double material levels of living every generation. During the three-quarters of a century from 1889 to the mid-1960s productivity in the nonfarm private economy improved at the average rate of 2.3 percent per year. Even during the Great Depression from 1929 to 1940 the average annual gain was almost 2 percent.2 One final comment about our historical record. From 1922 (the first year after the collapse of the World War I inflation) to 1929 real output rose at 4.7 percent per year rate, output per man hour improved at a 2.7 percent annual rate, the consumer price index in 1929 was 2.2 percent above its reading 7 years earlier (an average 0.3 percent per year rise), and the average unemployment rate was 3.7 percent. Perhaps Calvin Coolidge, our President in those years and a President often assumed to have particularly primitive views about economics, was after all fortunate that he did not have modern macroeconomics, fiscal policy and a Council of Economic Advisers to confuse his straightforward thinking! III If this deterioration in the recent performance of the American economy could be assumed to be temporary, recognizing that historical aberrations can be of several years duration, there might still be reasons for substantial confidence as we look ahead through the two remaining decades of this century. And there are some persuasive reasons for avoiding monolithic pessimism. For one thing, the decade just past did see an unusual cluster of factors pushing the U.S. price level upward. Two deserve some comment because they combined synergistically to exert substantial upward pressure on our price-cost level. One was the imposition of wage and price controls in 1971. The ultimate result of wage and price controls is, of course, a tendency for the price level finally to be higher than would probably have occurred 2John Kendrick, Productivity Trends in the United States (Princeton, 1961), pp. 334-5.\n\nPage 6 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW in their absence. For one thing these controls do produce dislocations that interfere with the capability of the market economy to use economic resources efficiently-which adversely affects underlying cost trends. Moreover, while logic insists that with these controls demand management policies should be even more restrictive, political pressures tend to push fiscal and monetary policies in the direction of less restraint. Having presumably dealt with inflation by means of these controls, so the logic seems to run, government can relax a bit on the demand management front. The inevitable result is that pressures on the suppressed price level accumulate, contributing to the subsequent disintegration of the controls and their collapse in a price-wage explosion. This collapse and explosion in 1973 happened to coincide with the worldwide inflationary boom that was the sequel to the breakdown of the old fixed exchange rate international monetary system. Its ultimate breakdown was, of course, inevitable because of the inherent logic of the system itself. Given the asymmetrical inclination in those years promptly to readjust an exchange rate downward when the problem was a weak external payments position, and to delay the needed adjustment when the problem was an overly-strong trade position, the system inherently produced a net bias toward devaluation of currencies against the standard, which was the U.S. dollar. By 1971 a fundamental and unsustainable disequilibrium had emerged, and the only question became which of a few possible weekends in mid-1971 would be chosen for closing the U.S. gold window. This breakdown seemingly released governments from external constraints in their management of domestic economic policies. Instead of being forced to move cautiously with demand management policies for fear of losing foreign exchange reserves, which were the \"working capital\" needed in the fixed-rate system to cover an interlude of weak external payments, governments now in a floating-rate world could rely on a seemingly more painless adjustment. They could simply let exchange rate changes absorb the adjustment. We all now know that a floating-rate system imposes its own array of disciplines-e.g., upward pressures on the domestic price level because of a deteriorating exchange rate. These lessons, however, had to be learned by experience and there was an interlude during which the governments of the industrial world generally (not just the United States) pursued\n\nPage 7 PAUL W. McCRACKEN overly-expansive domestic policies. By 1972 and 1973, for example, the rates of growth in the money supply in Western Europe were in the 18-19 percent per year zone, almost double the rates a few years earlier.3 Even for the Federal Republic of Germany the broadly-defined money supply by 1973 was rising for a time at a 20 percent annual rate, and for the U.K. the figure reached 35 percent during that year.4 In the United States this worldwide inflationary boom coincided with, and undoubtedly also abetted, the disintegration of the U.S. controls program and the upsurge in prices and wages which would have erupted at that stage in any case. And into this interacting, synergistic process was injected the first oil embargo and the sharp increases in the prices of imported oil. The result was that by the third quarter of 1974 the rate of inflation in the United States, as measured by the consumer price index, was at a 13.7 percent per year pace. This does not now seem so stratospheric, but in 1974 and against the backdrop of our historical record it was almost unreal. By the mid-1970s, in short, double-digit inflation for the American economy had come on stage. At this juncture also some essentially technical or structural shifts were occurring which had the effect of reducing the American economy's capability to generate gains in productivity. The \"mix\" of the labor force changed, with those having only limited experience (women and younger people) accounting for a sharply rising proportion of additions to the total work force. Moreover, a rising proportion of capital formation was being devoted to meeting such requirements as environmental and safety regulations. However socially desirable these purposes might be, this diversion did have the effect of lowering the rate of increase of measured output per man hour, and in many cases these required outlays carried us well into the zone where costs were exceeding even social benefits. Denison has estimated that these two factors alone reduced our rate of productivity growth by perhaps 0.7 percent per year.5 And this added a cost-push to a price level already experiencing strong upward pressures. 3Toward Full Employment and Price Stability (O.E.C.D., 1977), p. 340. 4\"Economic Outlook,\" (O.E.C.D., July 1974), p. 13. 5Edward F. Denison, \"Accounting for Slower Economic Growth,\" (Brookings, 1979), p.\n\nPage 8 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW There was, in short, an unusual concatenation or clustering of adverse economic developments in the decade just closed. Caution, not panic, is the proper response. We must recognize an American characteristic all too evident in our history: to assume that each present set of problems reflects some profound new natural law of the economic cosmos, decreeing that the present problems will probably endure forever. Four decades ago economists \"knew\" (with almost a religious conviction) that investment opportunities had been fully exploited, and that we were on the verge of a declining population. As recently as not much over two decades ago we again \"knew\" (as indicated earlier) that the world economy would have to struggle with a shortage of U.S. dollars as an enduring phenomenon. Even the problems posed for the economy by energy must be seen in perspective. The problem is not that the economy is inherently incapable of generating progress with energy prices at current levels, or even with the probability that supplies of conventional raw energy will be less abundant. The basic current problem is that the economy must make large adjustments in a short span of time. If the sharp rise in \"real\" energy prices which has occurred recently could have been fed into the economy steadily during the last quarter of a century, the economy today would be adjusted to these energy realities, and any suggestion that the processes of economic progress must now be forever halted would be given the dismissal it deserved. The world has had to adjust before to shifts in the availability of important commodities. As W. W. Rostow points out in a recent and important book, the world economy \"has experienced four marked... cycles since 1790 in the relative scarcity or abundance of foodstuffs and raw materials. \"6 The human race is not for the first time confronting this basic shortage problem. This all suggests caution about any inclination to assume that present problems besetting the American economy reflect fundamental and enduring adverse changes in the economic universe. These problems may appear quite different, and seem far less perdurable, as we look back upon them in, say, 1990 or the year 2000. That, at least, is a warning to us from experience and history. 6W. W. Rostow, The World Economy: History and Prospect (Univ. of Texas Press, 1978), p. 571.\n\nPage 9 PAUL W. McCRACKEN IV Even so it is difficult to avoid the bleak conclusion that the world economy is in for some difficult years during the 1980s. The key problem is that the international economic and political system has seemed to work more smoothly when it was organized on the basis of a hegemonic structure-with a dominant economy not so much \"giving orders\" to others as giving stability and order by its size, the strength of its economy, and the country's political leadership.7 We see this with particular clarity in the international financial and trading system. The dominant and strong American economy after World War II could lead the way in the direction of a more liberal trading world. The U.S. dollar could serve effectively as the international monetary unit in the Bretton Woods system. International holdings of dollars replenished depleted international monetary reserves. A quarter of a century ago the United States was supporting the Treaty of Rome and the concept of a European Economic Community even though such support involved some adverse effects for our external trade. An American company would find itself at a disadvantage relative to, say, its German competitor in the French market. The fact that during the decades since World War II the large American market remained relatively open to exports from Japan, and that the political weight of the United States was pushing the world generally toward a more liberal trading order, played an enormously important role in the rapid emergence of Japan as a rich, industrially powerful, and high-income nation. These were roles which an economy of unquestioned dominance could play in the world economy. During the 1980s, the world will be moving further from the patterns that made for an effective hegemonic structure. For one thing, even with the continuation of \"normal\" trends the U.S. share of world output and income can be expected to decline further. A quarter of a century ago it could not reasonably be assumed, for both moral and analytical reasons, that Japan's per capita income would remain at one7Cf. Marina v. N. Whitman, \"Coordination and Management of the International Economy: A Search for Organizing Principles,\" in William Fellner, editor, Contemporary Economic Problems (American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, 1977), pp. 289-345.\n\nPage 10 10 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW fifth that in the U.S., and today also it must be assumed that the gap will narrow further between other economies now well on their way (e.g., Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Mexico, Brazil) and the U.S., Japan, and other high-income societies. Such a decline will reflect the further result of orderly and ongoing economic progress, but even so it will move the world further away from the fundamental requirements of a natural hegemonic international economic structure. The U.S. share of the world economy during the 1980s will, however, probably decline more rapidly than these so-called \"normal\" or \"inevitable\" trends would themselves produce. For one thing the first part, at least the first half, of the decade must now be devoted to a restabilization of the American economy. Much of this effort must center around the problems of regaining control of the price level, but the need extends beyond this to a more fundamental revitalization of the economy generally. The shortfall of investment, for example, is large. The gross amount of nonresidential fixed investment per added person in the labor force for the 15 years from 1955 to 1970 was $71,500 (in 1972 prices). During the first half of the last decade this fell to $60,600, and for the second half(through 1979) to $52,100. The decline in these figures of new gross investment per additional person in the work force, serious as it is, understates the shortfall of capital put in place for enlarging capacity or increasing measured productivity because some of it took place to comply with social regulations. Even without an allowance for this social diversion of capital formation, the results are dramatic. From 1955 to 1970, the net stock of nonresidential fixed capital in place per person in the civilian labor force (or per person employed) rose at the average annual rate of 2.5 percent-a rate, not surprisingly, about equal to the rate of gain in output per man hour. From 1970 to 1975, however, this net stock of capital in use per person in the work force rose at only a 1 percent rate, and for the remainder of the decade there was virtually no gain. Indeed, the net stock of capital per person at work in the labor force has actually declined slightly since 1975. The effect of these trends on gains in productivity and real incomes are directly adverse, but they have also retarded the pace at which new technology could be introduced into the economy-since it is with new investment that new technology is incorporated into the production process. Moreover, the basic processes generating new technology in the\n\nPage 11 PAUL W. McCRACKEN 11 American economy do seem to have become more sluggish. These processes are not, of course, susceptible to direct and precise calibration, but circumstantial evidence suggests that they are weakening, at least in relative terms. In 1965 outlays for research and development were equal to 2.9 percent of GNP (both expressed in 1972 dollars). If these outlays had maintained that 2.9 percent share, they would have been 30 percent larger last year than was actually the case. Patent activity in relative terms has also declined. In 1978, the last year for which data are available, there were 72 patent applications for inventions per billion of GNP (in 1972 dollars), compared with 84 in 1975 and 102 in 1965. And the corresponding figures for patents issued (per billion of real GNP) were 50, 64, and 68 respectively. While there are exceptions, such as the American electronics industry, clearly this economy is now exhibiting signs of less technological dynamism than used to characterize it. V There is, however, an even more fundamental reason for concern about the diminishing capability of the American economy to deliver economic progress. While it deals with matters that are intangible, it is perhaps more fundamental than subnormal investment or inadequate research and development activity or an interlude of poor demand management policies. The American society seems to have lost the unifying force and cohesiveness that was provided by a common consent as to what the nation and its society is all about. Ours is a society that seems to be at war with itself. The reasons for this development are complex, and in any case extend well beyond the scope of this essay, but that the situation has implications for the vitality of the economy seems clear enough. Two dimensions of this development will perhaps illustrate the problem. For one thing there is growing skepticism in intellectual circles as to whether we should even try to sustain gains in output and real income.8 Probably many of those raising objections are them8Cf. Moses Abramovitz, \"Economic Growth and Its Discontents,\" in Michael J. Boskin, Economics and Human Welfare: Essays in Honor of Tibor Scitovsky (Academic Press, 1979), pp. 3-21.\n\nPage 12 12 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW selves sufficiently affluent so that their own current material level of living is quite safe from the threat of a stationary-state, no-growth economy. There is, however, an intellectual rationale here. As J. B. Bury pointed out over a half-century ago, the perception of the idea of progress was itself a major emancipation from the more static concept of a humanity expelled from the Garden of Eden or from some earlier Golden Age. Yet if \"the idea of progress\" (to use the title of Bury's book) was itself a new stage in the evolution of thinking, is it not possible that this idea of progress will itself be supplanted? And is it not possible that the post-progress stage will be some sort of stationary-state economy?9 Robert Nisbet, in his own exploration of these matters, tries to conclude on a note of some confidence, but it is the hope of a plainly worried student of the contemporary scene.10 The fading role of religion as an underpinning of our liberal social and economic order is also a part of this unhappy process. Indeed, many religious hierarchies (of all denominations) seem themselves to have lost interest in religion and are turning to secular activism. (Having apparently lost interest in God, they are perhaps involved in a frantic effort to avoid technological unemployment.) In the process, however, by waging war on the basic institutions of the liberal, marketorganized economy they are eroding support for the system itselfand moving us toward the more state-managed economic systems which find neither political democracy nor flourishing religion to be particularly congenial. And in the process the influence of religion and the church in society has itself undergone a marked decline. Thus the religious hierarchies, by turning to secular activity, are courting the demise of not only the church but also the institutions of that liberal economic order which have been so effective in generating economic progress and diffusing its results so widely. VI This all has some meaning for us as we look down the road to the end of this decade. Attempts to forecast the future are never notably 9Those articulating the case for \"limits to growth\" would presumably answer this question in the affirmative. '0Robert Nisbet, History of the Idea of Progress (Basic Books, 1979).\n\nPage 13 PAUL W. McCRACKEN 13 successful, and visibility is particularly murky at this juncture in U.S. history. Those concerned with the international economy, or the international economic system, must devise a system that can function in a world in which the U.S. economy is no longer dominant enough to play its organizing, stabilizing hegemonic role. If recent trends continue through the 1980s, and this seems now to be a reasonable assumption, the U.S. by 1990 might account for no more than 16-18 percent of world GNP. This would mean a per capita U.S. income below that of some countries in Europe by more than the vagaries of exchange rate fluctuations. It would almost certainly also mean that by the turn of the century the Pacific Basin area will have emerged as a major center for the industrial world. Per capita income in such economies as Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong (and also some other developing countries, such as Brazil) would roughly equal that in the U.S. by the year 2000, and Japan's per capita income might well by then exceed ours. This would almost certainly carry with it implications for the international political structure. It is improbable that a nation with a proportion of the world's output and income diminishing that rapidly and that persistently and to that small a piece of the economic pie would be either able or willing to carry the major burden for international political leadership, or to carry its already disproportionate burdens for defense. The diminishing share of the liberal world's economic activity accounted for by the United States, in short, means more than just that America's already reduced international influence will be eroded further. It will be forcing the liberal nations of the world into a painful search for viable new international economic and political structures to replace the old simple but in its time effective hegemonial system. The pain of these basic trends would be ameliorated, though not eliminated, if the United States were to regain its more traditional capability to achieve strong gains in real income and a more stable price level. There is, of course, nothing foreordained about our economic performance. The United States will have the economic performance during the 1980s which we ask for by the policies we pursue. It may be that historians will see in actions now being taken a new strategy of economic policy that will restore the U.S. economy to its traditional path of a more stable price level, stronger growth, and high\n\nPage 14 14 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW employment. If the present U.S. effort at restabilization succeeds, the prospects for a successful transition to a post-hegemonial international economic and political order would be enormously improved. The probability that this capability will not be regained, however, is uncomfortably high. Nations on the downward slope of their greatness have not often been \"born again.\" Greece did not have its second Golden Age. The grandeur of Rome, noted particularly for its genius in governance and law, is now ungovernable Italy. The center of the once-great British Empire is now a nation with a notably undistinguished economy. VII The international economic and political order at which the Free World is now looking contains, therefore, some difficult problems, some half-formed questions, and some other questions whose forms and content are clearly enough defined but whose answers are not at all evident. One thing about the era ahead, however, seems quite certain. International economic and political policies and institutions, to repeat, must be based on the fact of life that we shall no longer be living in a world with its structure and order provided by a dominant or hegemonic economy. The development of new or modified institutional structures, and even of new and modified ways of thinking, is always difficult. And here both the United States and the rest of the world face a problem of transition. We are now in the interlude when other nations are not yet willing to accept responsibilities for political leadership commensurate with their economic power. And it is equally clear that the United States, because of its momentum, and the vacuum it faces, continues to assume a political dominance no longer backed up by its economic power or capability for ideological and moral leadership. These emergent new facts of international life as one looks toward the end of the century reflect, of course, more than what has happened to the United States. The transition has been complicated by Western Europe, and Japan also. Western Europe for long seemed to hope that Japan's economic power would go away, and Japan seemed to hope that international political responsibilities commensurate with its growing economic might and power would never come.\n\nPage 15 PAUL W. McCRACKEN 15 While the shape of the emergent Free World order is by no means clear, there are some observations that can be made about it. They are not dramatic or novel, but they may be useful. We must frankly face the fact that this is a dangerous period for the Free World for internal reasons, not only because of pressures from the U. S. S.R. and its \"colonies.\" Indeed, if the Free World nations cannot deal with their own relationships in a constructive way, they will have little prospect of dealing effectively with their political adversaries. Though an almost Hegelian process may have meant that the very success of the earlier hegemonic structure would inevitably bring us to a world in which greater diffusion of power erodes the dominant-power structure itself, the problems of forging a viable new system remain formidably difficult. For one thing, this comes at an awkward moment for the economies of the Free World in terms of current domestic economic developments. Rates of inflation are now generally rising and are at levels which are forcing the managers of economic policy to take drastic and politically unattractive actions. In the United States, we have seen a President recommend major budgetary changes within two months after submitting his annual January Budget Message. Monetary restraint imposed by the Federal Reserve is now doubly severe because of having been applied so tardily, and the combination of these policies plus the inflation itself has driven interest rates to unprecedented levels. Somewhat comparable developments can be seen in other countries of the industrial world. In the United Kingdom last year the government unveiled a tough budget and a commitment to stern monetary restraint. In Japan high rates of inflation for wholesale prices, which probably portend yet higher rates of inflation for consumer prices, plus the overly-low rate of exchange for the yen will presumably push Japan's demand management policies in the direction of further restraint. The Federal Republic of Germany has also been tightening its monetary policy. The result of these policies is, as already pointed out, that needed modifications in the international economies and political structures must evolve in an era of highly unsatisfactory domestic economic conditions-of sluggish gains or even losses in real incomes, rates of unemployment already high by historical standards that will be rising\n\nPage 16 16 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW further, and stubbornly severe rates of decline in the purchasing power of money. Indeed, projections of economic activity for most countries are now being modified in unsatisfactory directions. Unease about the price and availability of oil, of course, exacerbates these problems. History has not often seen, in fact, an item in such insecure supply which is so crucially important to the economic wellbeing or even survival of so many people. This all means that at the very time in history when governments ought to be giving more thought to external economic and political matters, the demands of their political survival turn them inward to respond to pressing domestic matters. Here is a classic illustration of the observation by Alfred Marshall, the great British economist, that important matters are often the casualty of merely pressing problems. These new international economic and political arrangements must also be worked out in an era when in many nations people are becoming disenchanted with structures that involve more centralization of power. In Spain there is a resurgent loyalty to things Basque, or Catalonian, or Andalusian. The U.K. must work out its modus vivendi with Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh \"nationalists.\" Canada has its l'affaire Quebec. In the United States there is a deep distrust not so much of \"Washington's\" motives as its capability to solve problems. If the Treaty of Rome had to be negotiated today, one wonders if the European Economic Community could be brought into existence. Yet as the international economic and political order becomes less hegemonic, it inevitably takes on some characteristics of a more supranational structure. The dilemma between the urgency of more attention to these external matters and the pull of growing domestic problems and tensions is also intensified by the inherently more complex nature of an international economic and political order in an era characterized by a more global diffusion of power. Such an order poses many of the logical problems of a committee or a cartel whose members are of roughly equal size and strength. The commonly agreed-upon course of action is not easily achieved since each member has special interests and concerns that would improve his position \"back home\" if they could be put into the general agreement. And even if a general agreement could be achieved which, if adhered to, would collectively be advantageous, to each member it will be evident that he would be yet\n\nPage 17 PAUL W. McCRACKEN 17 better off by pursuing his own independent interest with the collective structure remaining essentially intact. Cartels are always subject to a similar strain. Even if the general agreement is demonstrably good for the group as a whole, each member would be yet better off if he could \"cheat\" a bit without destroying the general structure. (The oil cartel has been relatively successful largely because of a major member who, preferring oil in the ground to money, has been willing to absorb these individual aberrations-because, in short, it is a cartel with some characteristics of a hegemonic structure!) The key danger at this point is that a turning-inward on the part of people generally, for whom inflation and jobs seem much more important than these seemingly more abstract and remote international matters, will tend to paralyze the capability of governments to deal with crucial external issues. That the mood in the United States is one of growing preoccupation with domestic problems and growing vexation with the nation's international responsibilities seems clear. There is a mounting conviction that the other Free World nations want a system in which the United States is supposed to continue its full responsibilities for international political stability and security, in spite of its diminishing share of the world economic pie, while others remain free to get rich behind the security and diplomatic shield deployed and financed by the United States. If what is perceived at home as a \"fairer\" balance between national responsibilities and national resources does not begin to emerge, the danger of a protectionist explosion in the United States could approach the flash point. And the practical result of this would be to start the Free World down the road toward a more illiberal international economy. As we know from the history of the interwar period, once that disintegrating process begins, it is not easily reversed. Such generalized concerns usually are activated by the eruption of some specific problem. In the United States this specific issue could be the serious problems now being experienced in the American automobile industry. Obviously it is to be hoped that the United States will not impose tariffs or quotas on auto imports. And obviously there should be no effort to force Japanese auto companies to manufacture in the United States unless it makes economic sense (in which case it would presumably occur in any case). Yet there is a tendency at\n\nPage 18 18 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW home and abroad to dismiss the American industry's current problems as the inevitable result of its not responding to consumer preferences. Such simplistic thinking is simply contrary to the facts, and it is further aggravating a difficult and complex problem in the economic relationships between Japan and the United States. As recently as two years ago, the conventional American cars were in strong demand in the United States market and it was inventories of smaller cars (including those made in Japan) that were uncomfortably high and rising. On this the facts are quite clear. With the oil problems and uncertainties about gasoline availability, the market suddenly turned 180 degrees around and concentrated on small cars. Time is required for newer products to be designed and put on the market and this cannot be done as quickly as the market can turn. That the heavy unemployment and massive losses of the American companies in the domestic market would become a political concern in the United States was inevitable. If in early 1979 something had happened such that Japanese consumers wanted cars produced in Europe or the United States rather than those produced at home, would there have been political demands for government in Japan to do something to give the domestic industry time to adjust? VIII As we ponder the problems which nations of the Free World confront, looking at the 1980s and the remainder of this century, we must nonetheless resist pessimism. While nations must face the problems of living in an international order no longer given its shape and stability by a dominant economy forcefully playing its hegemonic role, the demise of the system was inevitable and evolved in part naturally from its own success. The process of its demise has been accelerated, however, by the perplexing inability of the United States to manage economic policy in ways that would permit the reasonably stable price level, high employment and persisting gains in real income that have characterized it historically. The most fundamental contribution that the United States can make to the orderly evolution of the new system is the better management of its own economic policies urgently needed at home in any case. This can be done, and there is a growing disposition to support these needed actions.\n\nPage 19 PAUL W. McCRACKEN 19 It is also essential that present tensions and strains not turn governments and their policies in the direction of protectionism. To suggest that the present international economic structure is evolving inevitably away from the old dominant-country pattern is not to suggest that we can jettison the hard-won gains of the freer, more liberal trading systems carefully developed since World War II. Indeed, they will now be more important, because the next phase or chapter in the evolving international economy will be one not of a dominant or hegemonic economy or nation, nor one whose members are of equivalent size relative to the total world economy; rather, it will be a world economy consisting of clusters of economies. At least three such clusters are clearly in the picture now: Japan and other economies in that area such as Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong (economies that will soon be moving into the upper income echelons of nations); Western Europe; and North America. While monetary dimensions of this new pattern extend beyond the scope of my remarks here, it seems clear that in the years ahead the yen and the D-mark will unavoidably come to be used heavily as key currencies. Such a pattern will require a strong commitment from the key nations to a liberal economic order and a resistance to autarchic, inward-looking strategies of economic policy for these nations particularly. If our nations can sustain strong operating political and economic relationships with each other, in the year 2000 historians may yet record that the twentieth century ended with two better decades than the 1970s would have indicated-perhaps an economic performance, in short, rising like the legendary phoenix in a fresh new incarnation from the ashes of an earlier existence.\n\nDaniel Mark EpsteinEpstein, Daniel MarkFortuneVol. XX, No.: 2, Spring 1981, pp. 20-21http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.act2080.0020.002:02\n\nPage 20 DANIEL MARK EPSTEIN FORTUNE (Imitated from Villon) Famous sages called me Lady Luck in better days.

These pianos were rarely tuned. They went flat in summer around the fourth of July and sharp in winter at Christmas. Ours was a Story and Clark. On its music stand were copies of Stephen Foster and Ethelbert Nevin favorites, along with one Chopin prelude that my mother would practice for twenty minutes every three years. She had no patience, but since she thought Ohio-all of it, every scrapmade sense, she was happy and did not need to practice anything. Happiness is not infectious, but somehow her happiness infected my father, a pharmacist, and then spread through the rest of the household. My whole family was obstinately cheerful. I think of my two sisters, my brother, and my parents as having artificial pasted-on smiles, like circus clowns. They apparently thought cheer and good Christian words were universals, respected everywhere. The pianos were part of this cheer. They played for celebrations and moments of pleasant pain. Or rather: someone played them, but not too well, since excellent playing would have been faintly antisocial. \"Chopin,\" my mother said, shaking her head as she stumbled through the prelude. \"Why is he famous?\" When I was six, I received my first standing ovation. On the stage of the community auditorium, where the temperature was about 94~, sweat fell from my forehead onto the piano keys, making their ivory surfaces slippery. At the conclusion of the piece, when everyone stood up to applaud, I thought they were just being nice. My playing had been mediocre; only my sweating had been extraordinary. Two years later, they stood up again. When I was eleven, they cheered. By that time I was astonishing these small-town audiences with Chopin and Rachmaninoff recital chestnuts. I thought I was a genius and read 22\n\nPage 23 CHARLES BAXTER 23 biographies of Einstein. Already the townspeople were saying that I was the best thing Parkersville had ever seen, that I would put the place on the map. Mothers would send their children by to watch me practice. The kids sat with their mouths open while I polished off another classic. Like many musicians, I cannot remember ever playing badly, in the sense of not knowing what I was doing. In high school, my identity was being sealed shut: my classmates called me \"el sefior longhair,\" even though I wore a crewcut, this being the 1950s. Whenever the town needed a demonstration of local genius, it called upon me. There were newspaper articles detailing my accomplishments, and I must have heard the phrase \"future concert career\" at least two hundred times. My parents smiled and smiled as I collected applause. My senior year, I gave a solo recital and was hired for umpteen weddings and funerals. I was good luck. On the fourth of July the townspeople brought out a piano to the city square so that I could improvise music between explosions at the fireworks display. Just before I left for college, I noticed that our neighbors wanted to come up to me ostensibly for small talk, but actually to touch me. In college I made a shocking discovery: other people existed in the world who were as talented as I was. If I sat down to play a Debussy etude, they would sit down and play Beethoven, only louder and faster than I had. I felt their breath on my neck. Apparently there were other small towns. In each one of these small towns there was a genius. Perhaps some geniuses were not actually geniuses. I practiced constantly and began to specialize in the non-Germanic piano repertoire. I kept my eye out for students younger than I was, who might have flashier technique. At my senior recital I played Mozart, Chopin, Ravel, and Debussy, with encore pieces by Scriabin and Thomson. I managed to get the audience to stand up for the last time. I was accepted into a large midwestern music school, famous for its high standards. Once there, I discovered that genius, to say nothing of talent, was a common commodity. Since I was only a middling composer, with no interesting musical ideas as such, I would have to make my career as a performer or teacher. But I didn't want to teach, and as a performer I lacked pizzazz. For the first time, it occurred to me that my life might be evolving into something unpleasant, something with the taste of stale bread.\n\nPage 24 24 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW I was beginning to meet performers with more confidence than I had, young musicians to whom doubt was as alien as proper etiquette. Often these people dressed like tramps, smelled, smoked constantly, were gay or sadistic. Whatever their imbalances, they were not genteel. They did not represent small towns. I was struck by their eyes. Their eyes seemed to proclaim, \"The universe believes in me. It always has.\" My piano teacher was a man I will call Luther Stecker. Every year he taught at the music school for six months. For the following six months he toured. He turned me away from the repertoire with which I was familiar and demanded that I learn several pieces by composers whom I had not often played, including Bach, Brahms, and Liszt. Each one of these composers discovered a weak point in me: I had trouble keeping up the consistent frenzy required by Liszt, the mathematical precision required by Bach, the unpianistic fingerings of Brahms. I saw Stecker every week. While I played, he would doze off. When he woke, he would mumble some inaudible comment. He also coached a trio I participated in, and he spoke no more audibly then than he did during my private lesson. I couldn't understand why, apart from his reputation, the school had hired him. Then I learned that in every Stecker-student's life, the time came when the Master collected his thoughts, became blunt, and told the student exactly what his future would be. For me, the moment arrived on the third of November, 1966. I was playing sections of the Brahms Paganini Variations, a fiendish piece on which I had spent many hours. When I finished, I saw him sit up. \"Very good,\" he said, squinting at me. \"You have talents.\" There was a pause. I waited. \"Thank you,\" I said. \"You have a nice house?\" he asked. \"A nice house? No.\" \"You should get a nice house somewhere,\" he said, taking his handkerchief out of his pocket and waving it at me. \"With windows. Windows with a view.\" I didn't like the drift of his remarks. \"I can't afford a house,\" I said. \"You will. A nice house. For you and your family.\" I resolved to get to the heart of this. \"Professor,\" I asked, \"what did you think of my playing?\"\n\nPage 25 CHARLES BAXTER 25 \"Excellent,\" he said. \"That piece is very difficult.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Yes, technically excellent,\" he said, and my heart began to pound. \"Intelligent phrasing. Not much for me to say. Yes. That piece has many notes,\" he added, enjoying the non sequitur. I nodded. \"Many notes.\" \"And you hit all of them accurately. Good pedal and good discipline. I like how you hit the notes.\" I was dangling on his string, a little puppet. \"Thousands of notes, I suppose,\" he said, staring at my forehead, which was beginning to get damp, \"and you hit all of them. You only forgot one thing.\" \"What?\" \"The passion!\" he roared. \"You forgot the passion! You always forget it! Where is it? Did you leave it at home? You never bring it with you! Never! I listen to you and think of a robot playing! A smart robot, but a robot! No passion! Never ever ever!\" He stopped shouting long enough to sneeze. \"You should buy a house. You know why?\" \"Why?\" \"Because the only way you will ever praise God is with a family, that's why! Not with this piano! You are a fine student,\" he wound up, \"but you make me sick! Why do you make me sick?\" He waited for me to answer. \"Why do you make me sick?\" he shouted. \"Answer me!\" \"How can I possibly answer you?\" \"By articulating words in English! Be courageous! Offer a suggestion! Why do you make me sick?\" I waited for a minute, the longest minute my life has seen or will ever see. \"Passion,\" I said at last. \"You said there wasn't enough passion. I thought there was. Perhaps not.\" He nodded. \"No. You are right. No passion. A corruption of music itself. Your playing is too gentle, too much good taste. To play the piano like a genius, you must have a bit of the fanatic. Just a bit. But it is essential. You have stubbornness and talent but no fanaticism. You don't have the salt on the rice. Without salt, the rice is inedible, no matter what its quality otherwise.\" He stood up. \"I tell you this because sooner or later someone else will. You will have a life of disappointments if you stay in music. You may find a teacher who\n\nPage 26 26 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW likes you. Good, good. But you will never be taken up! Never! You should buy a house, young man. With a beautiful view. Move to it. Don't stay here. You are close to success, but it is the difference between leaping the chasm and falling into it, one inch short. You are an inch short. You could come back for more lessons. You could graduate from here. But if you are truly intelligent, you will say goodbye. Goodbye.\" He looked down at the floor and did not offer me his hand. I stood up and walked out of the room. Becalmed, I drifted down and up the hallways of the building for half an hour. Then a friend of mine, a student of conducting from Bolivia, a Marxist named Juan Valparaiso, approached, and, ignoring my shallow breathing and cold sweat, started talking at once. \"Terrible, furious day!\" he said. \"Yes.\" \"I am conducting Benvenuto Cellini overture this morning! All is going well until difficult flute entry. I instruct, with force, flutists. Soon all woodwinds are ignoring me.\" He raised his eyebrows and stroked his huge gaucho mustache. \"Always! Always there are fascists in the woodwinds!\" \"Fascists everywhere,\" I said. \"Horns bad, woodwinds worse. Demands of breath made for insanes. Pedro,\" he said, \"you are appearing irresoluted. Sick?\" \"Yes,\" I nodded. \"Sick. I just came from Stecker. My playing makes him sick.\" \"He said that? That you are making him sick?\" \"That's right. I play like a robot, he says.\" \"What will you do?\" Juan asked me. \"Kill him?\" \"No.\" And then I knew. \"I'm leaving the school.\" \"What? Is impossible!\" Tears leaped instantly into Juan's eyes. \"Cannot, Pedro. After one whipping? No! Disappointments everywhere here. Also outside in world. Must stick to it.\" He grabbed me by the shoulders. \"Fascists put here on earth to break our hearts! Must live through. You cannot go.\" He looked around wildly. \"Where could you go anyway?\" \"I'm not sure,\" I said. \"He said I would never amount to anything. I think he's right. But I could do something else.\" To prove that I could imagine options, I said, \"I could work for a newspaper. You know, music criticism.\"\n\nPage 27 CHARLES BAXTER 27 \"Caterpillars!\" Juan shouted, his tears falling onto my shirt. \"Failures! Pathetic lives! Cannot, cannot! Who would hire you?\" I couldn't tell him for six months, until I was given a job in Knoxville on a part-time trial basis. But by then I was no longer writing letters to my musician friends. I had become anonymous. I worked in Knoxville for two years, then in Louisville-a great city for music-until I moved here, to this city I shall never name, in the middle of New York state, where I bought a house with a beautiful view. In my home town, they still wonder what happened to me, but my smiling parents refuse to reveal my whereabouts. II Every newspaper has a command structure. Within that command structure, editors assign certain stories, but the writers must be given some freedom to snoop around and discover newsworthy material themselves. In this anonymous city, I was hired to review all the concerts of the symphony orchestra and to provide some hype articles during the week to boost the ticket sales for Friday's program. Since the owner of the paper was on the symphony board of trustees, writing about the orchestra and its programs was necessarily part of good journalistic citizenship. On my own, though, I initiated certain projects, wrote book reviews for the Sunday section, interviewed famous visiting musicians-some of them my ex-classmates-and during the summer I could fill in on all sorts of assignments, as long as I cleared what I did with the feature editor, Morris Cascadilla. \"You're the first serious musician we've ever had on the staff here,\" he announced to me when I arrived, suspicion and hope fighting for control on his face. \"Just remember this: be clear and concise. Assume they've got intelligence but no information. After that, you're on your own, except you should clear dicey stuff with me. And never forget the Maple Street angle.\" The Maple Street angle was Cascadilla's equivalent to the Nixon Administration's \"How will it play in Peoria?\" No matter what subject I wrote about, I was expected to make it relevant to Maple Street, the newspaper's mythical locus of middle-class values. I could write about electronic, aleatory, or post-Boulez music if I suggested that the city's daughters might be corrupted by it. Sometimes I found the Maple Street angle, and sometimes I couldn't. When I failed, Cas\n\nPage 28 28 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW cadilla would call me in, scowl at my copy and mutter, \"All the Juilliard graduates in town will love this.\" Nevertheless, the Maple Street angle was a spiritual exercise in humility, and I did my best to find it week after week. When I first learned that the orchestra was scheduled to play Paul Hindemith's Harmony of the World symphony, I didn't think of Hindemith, but of Maple Street, that mythically harmonious place where I actually grew up. III Working on the paper left me some time for other activities. Unfortunately, there was nothing I knew how to do except play the piano and write reviews. Certain musicians are very practical. Trumpet players (who love valves) tend to be good mechanics, and I have met a few composers who fly airplanes and can restore automobiles. Most performing violinists and pianists, however, are drained by the demands of their instruments and seldom learn how to do anything besides play. In daily life they are helpless and stricken. In midlife the smart ones force themselves to find hobbies. But the less fortunate come home to solitary apartments without pictures or other decorations, warm up their dinners in silence, read whatever books happen to be on the dinner table, and then go to bed. I am speaking of myself here, of course. As time passed, and the vacuum of my life made it harder to breathe, I required more work. I fancied I was a tree, putting out additional leaves. I let it be known that I would play as an accompanist for voice students and other recitalists, if their schedules didn't interfere with my commitments for the paper. One day I received a call at my desk. A quietly controlled female voice asked, \"Is this Peter Jenkins?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well,\" she said, pausing, as if she'd forgotten what she meant to tell me, \"this is Karen Jensen. That's almost like Jenkins, isn't it?\" I waited. \"I'm a singer,\" she said, after a moment. \"A soprano. I've just lost my accompanist and I'm planning on giving a recital in three months. They said you were available. Are you? What do you charge?\" I told her.\n\nPage 29 CHARLES BAXTER 29, \"Isn't that kind of steep? That's kind of steep. Well, I suppose I can use somebody else until just before, and then I can use you. They say you're good. And I've read your reviews. I really admire the way you write!\" \"Thank you.\" \"You get so much information into your reviews! Sometimes, when I read you, I imagine what you look like. Sometimes a person can make a mental picture. I just wish the paper would publish a photo or something of you.\"1 \"They want to,\" I said, \"but I asked them to please don't.\" \"Even your voice sounds like your writing!\" she said excitedly. \"I can see you in front of me now. Can you play Faure and Schubert? I mean, is there any composer or style you don't like and won't play?\" \"No,\" I said. \"I play anything.\" \"That's wonderful!\" she said, as if I had confessed to a remarkable tolerance. \"Some accompanists are so picky. 'I won't do this, I won't do that.' Well, one I know is like that. Anyhow, could we meet soon? Do you sightread? Can we meet at the music school downtown? In a practice room? When are you free?\" I set up an appointment. She was almost beautiful. Her deep eyes were accented by depressive bowls in quarter-moon shadow under them. Though she was only in her late twenties, she seemed slightly scorched by anxiety. She couldn't keep still. Her hands fluttered as they fixed her hair; she scratched nervously at her cheeks; and her eyes jumped every few seconds. Soon, however, she calmed down and began to look me in the eye, evaluating me. Then I turned away. She wanted to test me out and had brought along her recital numbers, mostly standard fare: a Handel aria, Mozart, Schubert, and Faur6. The last set of songs, Nine Epitaphs, by an American composer I had never heard of, Theodore Chanler, was the only novelty. \"Who is this Chanler?\" I asked, looking through the sheet music. \"I... I found it in the music library,\" she said. \"I looked him up. He was born in Boston and died in 1961. There's a recording by Phyllis Curtin. Virgil Thomson says these are maybe the best American art songs ever written.\" \"Oh.\" \"They're kind of, you know, lugubrious. I mean they're all epitaphs\n\nPage 30 30 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW written supposedly on tombstones, set to music. They're like portraits. I love them. Is it all right? Do you mind?\" \"No, I don't mind.\" We started through her program, beginning with Handel's \"Un sospiretto d'un labbro pallido\" from II Pastorfido. I could immediately see why she was still in central New York state and why she would always be a student. She had a fine voice, clear and distinct, somewhat styled after Victoria de los Angeles (I thought), and her articulation was superb. If these achievements had been the whole story, she might have been a professional. But her pitch wobbled on sustained notes in a maddening way; the effect was not comic and would probably have gone unnoticed by most non-musicians, but to me the result was harrowing. She could sing perfectly for several measures and then she would miss a note by a semi-tone, which drove an invisible fingernail into my scalp. It was as though a gypsy's curse descended every five or six seconds, throwing her off pitch; then she was allowed to be a great singer until the curse descended again. Her loss of pitch was so regularized that I could see it coming and squirmed in anticipation. I felt as though I were in the presence of one of God's more complicated pranks. Her choice of songs highlighted her failings. Their delicate textures were constantly broken by her lapses. When we arrived at the Chanler pieces, I thought I was accustomed to her, but I found I wasn't. The first song begins with the following verse, written by Walter de la Mare, who had crafted all the poems in archaic epitaph style: Here lyeth our infant, Alice Rodd; She were so small, Scarce aught at all, But a mere breath of Sweetness sent from God. The vocal line for \"She were so small\" consists of four notes, the last two rising a half-step from the two before them. To work, the passage requires a dead-eye accuracy of pitch:\n\nPage 31 CHARLES BAXTER 31 She were so small A U Singing this line, Karen Jensen hit the D-sharp but missed the E and skidded up uncontrollably to F-sharp, which would sound all right to anyone who didn't have the music in front of his nose, as I did. Only a fellow-musician could be offended. Infuriated, I began to feel that I could not participate in a recital with this woman. It would be humiliating to perform such lovely songs in this excruciating manner. I stopped playing, turned to her to tell her that I could not continue after all, and then I saw her bracelet. I am not, on the whole, especially observant, a failing that probably accounts for my having missed the bracelet when we first met. But I saw it now: five silver canaries dangled down quietly from it, and as it slipped back and forth, I saw her wrist and what I suddenly realized would be there: the parallel lines of her madness, etched in scar tissue. The epitaphs finished, she asked me to work with her, and I agreed. When we shook hands, the canaries shook in tiny vibrations, as if pleased with my dutiful kindness, my charity, toward their mad mistress. IV Though Paul Hindemith's reputation once equalled Stravinsky's and Bart6k's, it suffered after his death in 1963 an almost complete collapse. Only two of his orchestral works, the Symphonic Metamorphoses on Themes of Weber and the Mathis der Maler symphony, are played with any frequency, thanks in part to their use of borrowed tunes. One hears his woodwind quintets and choral pieces now and again, but the works of which he was most proud-the ballet Nobilissima Visione, Das Marienleben (a song cycle), and the opera Harmonie die Welt-have fallen into total obscurity. The reason for Hindemith's sudden loss of reputation was a mystery to me; I had always considered his craftsmanship if not his inspiration to be first-rate. When I saw that the Harmony of the World symphony,\n\nPage 32 32 2THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW almost never played, would be performed in our anonymous city, I told Cascadilla that I wanted to write a story for that week on how fame was gained and lost in the world of music. He thought that subject might be racy enough to interest the tone-deaf citizens of leafy and peaceful Maple Street, where no one is famous, if I made sure the story contained \"the human element.\" I read up on Hindemith, played his piano music, and listened to the recordings. I slowly found the music to be technically astute but emotionally arid, as if some problem of purely local interest kept the composer's gaze safely below the horizon. Technocratic and oddly timid, his work reminded me of a model train chugging through a tiny town where only models of people actually lived. In fact, Hindemith did have a lifelong obsession with train sets: in Berlin, his took up three rooms, and the composer wrote elaborate timetables so that the toys wouldn't collide. But if Hindemith had a technocrat's intelligence, he also believed in the necessity of universal participation in musical activities. Listening was not enough. Even non-musical citizens could learn to sing and play, and he wrote music expressly for this purpose. He seems to have known that passive, drugged listening was a side-effect of totalitarian environments and that elitist composers such as Schoenberg were engaged in antisocial Faustian projects that would bewilder and infuriate most audiences, leaving them isolated and thus eager to be drugged by a musical superman. As the foremost anti-Nietzschean German composer of his day, therefore, Hindemith left Germany when his works could not be performed, thanks to the Third Reich; wrote textbooks with simple exercises; composed a requiem in memory of Franklin Roosevelt, set to words by Walt Whitman; and taught students, not all of them talented, in Ankara, New Haven, and Buffalo (\"this caricature of a town\"). As he passed through late middle age, he turned to a project he had contemplated all his life, an opera based on the career of the German astronomer Johannes Kepler, author of De Harmonice Mundi. This opera, a summary of Hindemith's ideas, would be called Harmony of the World. Hindemith worked out the themes first in a symphony, which bore the same title as the opera, and completed it in 1951. The more I thought about this project, the more it seemed anachronistic. Who believed in world harmony in 1951? Or thereafter?\n\nPage 33 CHARLES BAXTER 33 Such a symphony would have to pass beyond technical sophistication into divine inspiration, which Hindemith had never shown any evidence of possessing. It occurred to me that Hindemith's lifelong sanity had perhaps given way in this case, toppled not by despair (as is conventional) but by faith in harmony. V For the next rehearsal, I drove to Karen Jensen's apartment, where there was, she said, a piano. I'd become curious about the styles of her insanity: I imagined a hamster cage in the kitchen, a doll-head mobile in the living room, and mottos written with different colored inks on memo pads tacked up everywhere on the walls. She greeted me at the door without her bracelet. When I looked at her wrist, she said, \"Hmmm. I see that you noticed. A memento of adolescent despair.\" She sighed. \"But it does frighten people off. Once you've tried to do something like that, people don't really trust you. I don't know why exactly. Don't want your blood on their hands or something. Well, come on in.\" I was struck first by her forthrightness and secondly by her tiny apartment. Its style was much like the style in my house. She owned an attractive but worn-down sofa, a sideboard that supported an antique clock, one chair, a glass-top dinner table, and one nondescript poster on the wall. Trying to keep my advantage, I looked hard for tell-tale signs of insanity but found none. The piano was off in the corner, almost hidden, unlike those in the parlors back home. \"Very nice,\" I said. \"Well, thanks,\" she said. \"It's not much. I'd like something bigger, but.. where I work, I'm an administrative assistant, and they don't pay me very much. So that's why I live like a snail here. It's hardly big enough to move around in, right?\" She wasn't looking at me. \"I mean, I could almost pick it up and carry it away.\"1 I nodded. \"You just don't think like a rich person,\" I said, trying to be hearty. \"They like to expand. They need room. Big houses, big cars, fat bodies.\" \"Oh, I know!\" she said, laughing. \"My uncle.. would you like to stay for dinner? You look like you need a good meal. I mean, after\n\nPage 34 34 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW the rehearsal. You're just skin and bones, Pet-... may I call you Peter?\" \"Sure.\" I sat down on the sofa and tried to think up an excuse. \"I really can't stay, Miss Jensen. I have another rehearsal to go to later tonight. I wish I could.\" \"That's not it, is it?\" she asked suddenly, looking down at me. \"I don't believe you. I bet it's something else. I bet you're afraid of me.\" \"Why should I be afraid of you?\" She smiled and shrugged. \"That's all right. You don't have to say anything. I know how it goes.\" She laughed once more, faintly. \"I never found a man who could handle it. They want to show you their scars, you know? They don't want to see any on you, and if they discover any, they just run.\" She slapped her right hand into her forehead and then ran her fingers through her hair. \"Well, shit. I didn't mean to do this at all! I mean, I admire you so much and everything, and here I am, running on like this. I guess we should get down to business, right? Since I'm paying you by the hour.\" I smiled professionally and went to her piano. Beneath the high culture atmosphere that surrounds them, art songs have one subject: love. The permutations of love (lust, solitude, and loss) are present in abundance, of course, but for the most part they are simple vehicles for the expression of that one emotion. I was reminded of this as I played through the piano parts. As much as I concentrated on the music in front of me, I couldn't help but notice that my employer stood next to the piano, singing the words sometimes toward me, sometimes away. She was rather courageously forcing eyecontact on me. She kept this up for an hour and a half until we came to the Chanler settings, when at last she turned slightly, singing to the walls. As before, her voice broke out of control every five seconds, giving isolated words all the wrong shadings. The only way to endure it, I discovered, was to think of her singing as a post-modern phenomenon with its own conventions and rules. As the victim of necessity rather than accident, Karen Jensen was tolerable. Here sleep I, Susannah Fry, No one near me,\n\nPage 35 CHARLES BAXTER 35 No one nigh: Alone, alone Under my stone, Dreaming on, Still dreaming on: Grass for my valance And coverlid, Dreaming on As I always did. 'Weak in the head?' Maybe. Who knows? Susannah Fry Under the rose. There she was, facing away from me, burying Susannah Fry, and probably her own past and career into the bargain. When we were done, she asked, \"Sure you won't stay?\" \"No, I don't think so.\" \"You really haven't another engagement, do you?\" \"No,\" I admitted. \"I didn't think so. You were scared of me the moment you walked in the door. You thought I'd be crazy.\" She waited. \"After all, only ugly girls live alone, right? And I'm not ugly.\" \"No, you aren't,\" I said. \"You're quite attractive.\" \"Do you think so?\" she asked, brightening. \"It's so nice to hear that from you, even if you're just paying a compliment. I mean, it still means something.\" Then she surprised me. As I stood in the doorway, she got down on her knees in front of me and bowed her head in the style of one of her songs. \"Please stay,\" she asked. Immediately she stood up and laughed. \"But don't feel obliged to.\" \"Oh, no,\" I said, returning to her living room, \"I've just changed my mind. Dinner sounds like a good idea.\" After she had served and we had started to eat, she looked up at me and said, \"You know, I'm not completely good.\" She paused. \"At singing.\" \"What?\" I stopped chewing. \"Yes, you are. You're all right.\" \"Don't lie. I know I'm not. You know I'm not. Come on: let's at least be honest. I think I have certain qualities of musicality, but my\n\nPage 36 36 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW pitch is.. you know. Uneven. You probably think it's awfully vain of me to put on these recitals like this. With nobody but friends and family coming.\" \"No, I don't.\" \"Well, I don't care what you say. It's... hmm, I don't know. People encourage me. And it's a discipline. Music's finally a discipline that rewards you. Privately, though. Well, that's what my mother says. Carefully, I said, \"She may be right.\" \"Who cares if she is?\" she laughed, her mouth full of food. \"I enjoy doing it. Like I enjoy doing this. Listen, I don't want to seem forward or anything, but are you married?\" \"No.\" \"I didn't think so.\" She picked up a string bean and eyed it suspiciously. \"Why aren't you? You're not ugly. In fact you're all right looking. You obviously haven't been crazy. Are you gay or something?\" \"No.\" \"No,\" she agreed, \"you don't look gay. You don't even look very happy. You don't look very anything. Why is that?\" \"I should be offended by this line of questioning.\" \"But you're not. You know why? Because I'm interested in you. I hardly know you, but I like you, what I can see. Don't you have any trust?\" \"Yes,\" I said, finally. \"So answer my question. Why don't you look very anything?\" \"Do you want to hear what my piano teacher once said?\" I asked. \"He said I wasn't enough of a fanatic. He said that to be one of the great ones you have to be a tiny bit crazy. Touched. And he said I wasn't. And when he said it, I knew all along he was right. I was waiting for someone to say what I already knew, and he was the one. I was too much a good citizen, he said. I wasn't possessed.\" She rose, walked around the table to where I was sitting, and stood in front of me, looking down at my face. I knew that whatever she was going to do had been picked up, in attitude, from one of her songs. She touched the back of my arm with two fingers on her right hand. \"Well,\" she said, \"maybe you aren't possessed, but what would you think of me as another possession?\"\n\nPage 37 CHARLES BAXTER 37 VI In 1618 at the age of seventy, Katherine Kepler, the mother of Johannes Kepler, was put on trial for witchcraft. The records indicate that her personality was so deranged, so deeply offensive to all, that if she were alive today she would still be called a witch. One of Kepler's biographers, Angus Armitage, notes that she was \"evil-tempered\" and possessed an interest in unnamed \"outlandish things.\" Her trial lasted, on and off, for three years; by 1621, when she was acquitted, her personality had disintegrated completely. She died the following year. At the age of six, Kepler's son Frederick died of smallpox. A few months later, Kepler's wife, Barbara, died of typhus. Two other children, Henry and Susanna, had died in infancy. Like many another of his age, Kepler spent much of his adult life cultivating favor from the nobility. He was habitually penniless and was often reduced, as his correspondence shows, to begging for handouts. He was the victim of religious persecution, though luckier in this regard than some. After he married for a second time, three more children died in infancy, a statistic that in theory carries less emotional weight than one might think, given the accepted levels of infant mortality for that era. In 1619, despite the facts cited above, Kepler published De Harmonice Mundi, a text in which he set out to establish the correspondence between the laws of harmony and the disposition of planets in motion. In brief, Kepler argued that certain intervals, such as the octave, major and minor sixths, and major and minor thirds, were pleasurable, while other intervals were not. History indicated that mankind had always regarded certain intervals as unpleasant. Feeling that this set of universal tastes pointed to immutable laws, Kepler sought to map out the pleasurable intervals geometrically, and then to transfer that geometrical pattern to the order of the planets. The velocity of the planets, rather than their strict placement, constituted the harmony of the spheres. This velocity provided each planet with a note, what Armitage calls a \"term in a mathematically determined relation.\"5\n\nPage 38 38 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW In fact, each planet performed a short musical scale, set down by Kepler in staff notation. The length of the scale depended upon the eccentricity of the orbit; and its limiting notes could generally be shown to form a concord (except for Venus and the Earth with their nearly circular orbits, whose scales were of very constricted range).... at the Creation... complete concord prevailed and the morning stars sang together. VII We began to eat dinner together. Accustomed to solitude, we did not always engage in conversation. I would read the newspaper or ink in letters on my geometrically patterned crossword puzzles at my end of the table, while Karen would read detective novels or Time at hers. If she had cooked, I would clear and wash the dishes; if I had cooked, she did the cleaning. Experience and disappointments had made us methodical. She told me that she had once despised structured experiences governed by timetables, but that after several manic-depressive episodes, she had learned to love regularity. This regularity included taking lithium at the same time-to the minute-each day. The season being summer, we would pack towels and swimming suits after dinner and drive out to one of several public beaches, where we would swim until darkness came on. On calm evenings, Karen would drop her finger in the water and watch the waves lap outward. I favored immature splashing, or grabbing her by the arm and whirling her around me until I released her and she would spin back and fall into the water, laughing as she sank. One evening, we found a private beach, two hundred feet of sand all to ourselves, on a lake thirty miles out of town. Framed on both sides by woods and well-hidden from the highway, this beach had the additional advantage of being unpatrolled. We had no bathhouse in which to change, however, so Karen instructed me not to look as she walked about fifty feet away to a spot where she undressed and put on her suit. Though we had been intimate for at least a week, I had still not seen her naked: like a good Victorian, she demanded the shades be drawn, the lights out, and the covers pulled discreetly over us. But now, with the same methodical thoroughness, she wanted me to see her, so I looked, despite her warnings. She was bent over, under the\n\nPage 39 CHARLES BAXTER 39 tree boughs, the evening light breaking through the leaves and casting broken gold bands on her body. Her arms were delicate, the arms of a schoolgirl, I thought, an impression heightened by the paleness of her skin, but her breasts were full, at first making me think of Rubens women, then of Renoir's, then of nothing at all. Slowly, knowing I was watching her, she pinned her hair up. Not her breasts or arms, but that expression of vague contentment as she looked out toward the water away from me: that made me feel a tingling below my heart, somewhere in an emotional center near my stomach. I wanted to pick her up and carry her somewhere, but with my knees wobbly it was all I could do to make my way over to where she stood and take her in my arms before she cried out. \"Jesus,\" she said, shivering, \"you gave me a surprise.\" I kissed her, waiting for inspiration to direct me on what to do next: pick her up? Carry her? Make love to her on the sand? Wade into the water with her and swim out to the center of the bay, where we would drown together in a Lawrentian love-grip? But then we broke the kiss; she put on her swimsuit like a good citizen, and we swam for our usual fifteen minutes in silence. Afterwards, we changed back into our clothes and drove home, muttering smalltalk. Behavior inspired by and demonstrating love embarrassed both of us. When I told her that she was beautiful and that I loved her, she patted me on the cheek and said, \"Aw, how nice. You always try to say the right thing.\" VIII The Maple Street angle for Harmony of the World ran as follows: SYMPHONY OF FAITH IN A FAITHLESS AGE. Hindemith, I said, wished to confound the skeptics by composing a monument of faith. In an age of organized disharmony, of political chaos, he stood at the barricades defending tonality and traditional musical form. I carefully avoided any specific discussion of the musical materials of the symphony, which in the Schott orchestral score looked over-complex and melodically ugly. From what I could tell without hearing the piece, Hindemith had employed stunning technique in order to disguise his lack of inspiration, though I did not say so in print. Instead, I wrote that the symphony's failure to win public support was probably the result of Hindemith's refusal to use musical gimmicks on the one hand\n\nPage 40 40 THE MICHIGAN QUARTERLY REVIEW and sticky sweet melodies on the other. I wrote that he had not been dismayed by the bad reviews Harmony of the World had received, which was untrue. I said he was a man of integrity. I did not say that men of integrity are often unable to express joy when the occasion demands. Cascadilla liked my article. \"This guy sounds like me,\" he said, reading my copy. \"I respect him.\" The article ran five days before the concert and was two pages away from the religion-and-faith section. Not long after, the symphony ticket office called me to say that my piece had caused a rush of ticket orders from ordinary folk, nonconcert types, who wanted to hear this \"religious symphony.\" The woman from the business office thanked me for my trouble. \"Let's hope they like it,\" I said. \"Of course they will,\" she assured me. \"You've told them to.\" But they didn't. Despite all the oratory in the symphony, it was spiritually as dead as a lampshade. I could see why Hindemith had been shocked by the public reaction. Our audience applauded politely in discouragement, and then I heard an unusual sound for this anonymous city: one man, full of fun and conviction, booing loudly from the balcony. Booing the harmony of the world! He must be a Satanist! Don't intentions mean anything? So what if the harmony and joy were all counterfeit? The conductor came out for a bow, smiled at the booing man, and very soon the applause died away. I left the hall, feeling responsible. Arriving at the paper, I wrote a review of crushing dullness that reeked of bad faith. Goddamn Hindemith! Here he was, claiming to have seen God's workings, and they sounded like the workings of a steam engine or a trolley car. A fake symphony, with optimism the composer did not feel! I decided (but did not write) that Harmony of the World was just possibly the largest, most misconceived fiasco in modern music's history. It was a symphony that historically could not be written by a man who was constitutionally not equipped to write it. In my review, I kept a civil pen: I said that the performance lacked \"luster,\" \"a certain necessary glow. IX \"I'm worried about the recital tomorrow.\" \"Aw, don't worry. Here, kiss me. Right here.\" \"Aren't you listening? I'm worried.\"\n\nPage 41 CHARLES BAXTER 41 \"I'm singing. You're just accompanying me. Nobody's going to notice you. Move over a little, would you? Yeah, there. That pillow was forcing my head against the wall.\" \"Why aren't you worried?\" \"Why should I be worried? I don't want to worry. I want to make love. Isn't that better than worrying?\" \"Not if I'm worried.\" \"People won't notice you. By the way, have you noticed that when I kiss you on the stomach, you get goosebumps?\" \"Yes. I think you're taking this pretty lightly. I mean, it's almost unprofessional.\" \"That's because I'm an amateur. A 100% amateur. Always and totally. Even at this. But that doesn't mean I don't have my moments. Mmmmmm. That's better.\" \"I thought it would maybe help. But listen. I'm still worried.\" \"Uhhhn. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Oh, I get it.\" \"What?\" \"I get it. You aren't worried about yourself. You're worried about me.
