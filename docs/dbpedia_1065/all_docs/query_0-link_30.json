This book contributes to the growing body of critical thought on magical realism, which, beginning with the seminal articles by Stephen Slemon and Edna Aizenberg on magical realism as postcolonial discourse, analyzes the cultural work that magical realism has been doing. And like Anne Hegerfeldt’s recent book, Lies that Tell the Truth, on magical realism in Britain, by integrating postcolonial and metropolitan texts, Eugene Arva’s study shows that magical realism is not only a postcolonial phenomenon but also belongs in meaningful ways to world literature in all cultural contexts, especially those having experienced trauma of one kind or another. Because magical realism includes fantastical––magical––events, it has occasionally come under fire recently as an escapist genre. In this study, Eugene Arva takes on this accusation and refutes it by showing in considerable theoretical and textual detail how magical realism (in his words) “rewrites the vanishing real,” and thereby makes traumatic events of history, which have been repressed because they were too horrific to\n\nx\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nconfront, available to the reader. He discusses the way in which magical realism enables writers to exercise what he calls the “traumatic imagination,” through which they express aspects of historical trauma that have been suppressed. As he explains, the traumatic imagination transforms traumatic memories into narrative memories and integrates them into what he calls an artistic shock chronotope. This is another term he has coined (using Bakhtin’s idea of chronotope) to suggest the way in which magical realist writing brings forth events that, because they exceeded a subject’s capacities for assimilation and narrative, have been repressed through shock. In the course of articulating his own theory, Arva contextualizes magical realism critically, availing himself of a number of other psychological and cultural theories. The perspective of trauma studies integrates not only postcolonial and metropolitan sites but also negotiates the intersection of public and private, synthesizing fruitfully both social and psychological nuances. He links Freud’s idea of the uncanny as something that appears in connection with an event that was too difficult for a person to assimilate with magical realism’s inclusion of nonrealistic events and images, and uses that idea, together with the notion of trauma, which causes an event to be suppressed, to begin to describe how magical realism reconstructs history via nonmimetic imagery, and thereby makes historical atrocity present for readers to experience. In his second chapter, which locates magical realism within postmodern writing, Arva deals with Baudrillard’s notion of simulacra, among other ideas, and distinguishes magical realist texts from Baudrillard’s hyperreality, which he sees as oversaturated with facts and information. Starting from those and other theoretical bases, he selects novels from three historical situations in order to demonstrate in more detail how magical realism reconstructs history in order to deal with trauma. His treatment of Caribbean slavery in Jean Rhys’s Wide Sargasso Sea, Alejo Carpentier’s The Kingdom of This World, and Maryse Condé’s I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem illustrates how the characters and narrators of these texts use their traumatic imaginations to confront impossible situations.\n\nForeword\n\nxi\n\nNext comes an insightful discussion of images of colonial and postcolonial trauma in Gabriel García Márquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude and Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children. In order to explain how García Márquez is able to use his traumatic imagination fruitfully to create magical realist texts, even though he himself had not experienced major trauma, for example, Arva locates García Márquez’s writing within both the frames of the violencia in Colombia and Spanish colonialism. The penultimate example of the magical realist traumatic imagination at work is taken from two novels depicting the Nazi holocaust, Joseph Skibell’s A Blessing on the Moon and Bernard Malamud’s The Fixer. While Arva recognizes the significant differences between the historical events involved, he makes a convincing argument that magical realism indeed provides a widespread and fruitful textual strategy for reliving and dealing with historical trauma. The last chapter takes up two narratives whose authors were closer to the traumatic wartime events represented in their novels, Günter Grass’s The Tin Drum, and Tim O’Brien’s Going after Cacciato. Arva studies the way in which the fractured narrative voice of Grass’s narrator, alternating between first- and third-person viewpoints, embodies a traumatized self, one that is suspended between innocence and guilt, and how Grass infuses the text with magical images to depict Oskar’s unusual wartime experiences. He then compares this magical narrative of trauma with O’Brien’s, analyzing the similar position of Cacciato’s narrator, and the way he deals with the discomfort resulting from such a position by creating a magical alternative reality. In short, through such analyses of texts from widely differing historical contexts, this approach to magical realism through ideas associated with trauma studies enlarges our understanding of the cultural work magical realism continues to do in contemporary world literature. –Wendy B. Faris, University of Texas at Arlington\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe first thoughts that have led to this project started their journey about a decade ago. Inspiration came from a few writers and scholars whom I was privileged to meet and work with for several years, and many others whom I had come to know through their writings. I owe the discovery of most of the sources present in this work to my former professors from the Graduate School of the University of Miami. I feel particularly indebted to Michael Rothberg, who showed me the turbulent locus where literary theory meets trauma studies; Frank Stringfellow, who made me understand psychoanalysis and its theoretical applications beyond the limits to which Freud could possibly have intended for us to take them; Frank Palmeri and Russ Castronovo, who introduced me to contemporary literary, social, and aesthetic theories without which this would certainly be a different work; Lindsey Tucker, who helped me see the light amidst the aporia of postmodernist fiction; Robert Antoni, who got me hooked on Faulkner, García Márquez, and the myth-making process of magical realism; and Lester Goran, who taught me that writing, “good” writing, has nothing to do with reality, and everything to do with the writer’s imagination.\n\nxiv\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nOver the years, my erratic thinking processes and convoluted writing habits benefited from the careful guidance of Patrick McCarthy and Joseph Alkana from the University of Miami, as well as Wendy Faris from the University of Texas at Arlington. I am grateful not only for their insightful commentaries and conscientious editing, but also for their unrelenting trust and ongoing friendship. When two years ago the going got tough in academia, my good friends Alan Gravano and Peter Cramer made it their mission to keep me from losing heart. Haunted by the demons of my own past, I could not have written about trauma without the love and moral support of my parents, Jenö and Anna Mária, to whom I dedicate this work.\n\nThe Traumatic Imagination\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWRITING HORROR TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION AND MAGICAL REALISM Events characterized by extreme violence and/or extended states of fear and anxiety tend to resist rationalization and interpretation in a narrative form because of their powerful and lasting impact on the human psyche. However, traumatization, albeit of a different type and intensity, may also be incurred by indirect or mediated experiences of violent events, such as listening to survivors’ (or trauma patients’) stories, watching war documentaries, films, and news footage, as well as reading trauma narratives. The concepts of vicarious traumatization and transgenerational trauma have constituted the fulcrum of the present project since its inception in early 2003, when, coincidentally, the United States invaded Iraq in order to “finish” a war started twelve years earlier, which, in its turn, had allegedly put to rest, as the media hype of the day went, the demons haunting America’s collective memory since yet another “unfinished” war of twenty-odd years before, named after a Southeast Asian country. Television brought all three wars into the living rooms\n\n2\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nof the global audience, without deliberately aiming for, but certainly achieving, a twofold psychological effect: first, “authentic” violence was made available to secondary witnessing thousands of miles away from the battlefield, inducing different degrees of psychic numbing in viewers; and second, a feeling of reassurance (it is happening there and not here, to them and not to us) was conveyed by the surreal incongruity of the images, their intriguing non-conformity to “normality.” However, the images, run and rerun by the media day in and day out, shocking in the beginning and unnervingly obsessive later, gradually turned “normal”: war planes dropping their deadly load on what seemed like uninhabited jungles; burning villages; helicopters evacuating the wounded and the dead; bleeding, terrified, gaunt-looking human beings—the enemy; and then, more than two decades later, video images of buildings suddenly turning into puffs of smoke; ships launching “smart” missiles; tanks and humvees rolling across an endless desert; explosions and tracers lighting up the night sky over cities; and again gaunt-looking human beings with their hands tied behind their backs—the enemy. The normality of combat zones: not everyone was in the war, but most of us felt at war. Traumatization by witnessing does not necessarily require one’s physical presence at, or direct exposure to, an extreme event, spatially or temporally; what matters is the feeling incurred by experiencing the event in one way or another: through oral accounts, written narratives, or audiovisual media. Nevertheless, secondary or tertiary witnessing cannot and should not be treated on an equal plane with firsthand witnessing, nor can bearing witness by proxy ever be granted the same degree of authority to which survivors’ and victims’ accounts are entitled. Most of us remember Vietnam, Desert Storm, and Iraqi Freedom from images similar to the ones described earlier; few of us have ever had the opportunity to listen to primary witnesses’ accounts, and even fewer have actually experienced the heat of jungle or desert battles. Most writers discussed in this study (with two exceptions, Günter Grass and Tim O’Brien) have not directly experienced the violent time-spaces—or shock chronotopes—that they re-created in their works. Evidently, the phrase “authentic vicarious experience” is in itself an oxymoron of\n\nWriting Horror\n\n3\n\nsorts; and yet, the repetition of violent images (by the media or other means) does tend to create a spatio-temporality in its own right and, in a way, “authentic” experiences from the audience’s point of view. A spectator (viewer, listener, or reader) will thus develop what Thomas Elsaesser calls a “prosthetic memory” and, on a case-by-case basis, “prosthetic trauma,” which will result in a subconscious overlap of different temporalities in the spectator’s perception of reality: “Besides involving repetition and iteration, the traumatic event intimately links several temporalities, making them coexist within the same perceptual or somatic field, so much so that the very distinction between psychic time and chronological time seems suspended” (“Postmodernism as Mourning Work” 197). Other theorists have shared this point of view in the past few years as well, initiating a meaningful dialogue about the legitimacy and sources of secondary witnessing and vicarious traumatization, ultimately leading toward analyses of literary works as trauma work. In 2005, for instance, E. Ann Kaplan argued that “the reader or viewer of stories or films about traumatic situations may be constituted through vicarious or secondary trauma” and that “most of us most of the time experience trauma in the ‘secondary’ rather than direct position” (39). This line of inquiry is not altogether new; Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Ellul, Paul Virilio, and Slavoj Žižek, to name only a few, have already discussed the impact of visual media on both the individual and the collective consciousness in different types of arguments and contexts (not all trauma-related) for more than two decades. Etiologically, however, visually mediated trauma is not the only type of psychic wounding; among other sources of trauma, Kaplan also mentioned “reading a trauma narrative and constructing visual images of semantic data…” (91). I claim that vicarious traumatization is not always solely the result of reading a trauma narrative but also—and more important from a literary-artistic perspective—the cause for writing one. Magical realism, as a mode of writing and not as a canonical genre restricted to a certain geography, culture, or literary trend, has become one of the most effective, albeit controversial, artistic media to re-present extreme events since its beginnings in the early twentieth century.\n\n4\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\n(Unlike representation, which involves some degree of interpretation, re-presentation captures the feel of a limit experience, not the facts. Because of its shocking impact on the psyche, a limit experience cannot usually be assimilated and stored as a narrative memory by consciousness, remaining confined to its limits as a latent traumatic memory.) Viewed in the larger context of postmodernist fiction, magical realist writing foregrounds and at the same time transgresses the traditional borders between reality and imagination by rearranging apparently antithetical ontological levels within the literary text: the logically and perceptually verifiable everyday reality, on the one hand, and the sensorially ungraspable and unexplainable phenomena of the supernatural on the other. Over more than half a century now, magical realist language has demonstrated its versatility by affecting literary productions belonging to various cultural spaces and representing different histories of violence. The oxymoronic character of the term magical realism has often been pointed out by critics, who have also been careful to justify its meaning according to the perceived functionality of the writing mode. For example, Christopher Warnes defends the oxymoron by deeming it “an appropriate condition given that it designates a narrative strategy that stretches or ruptures altogether the boundaries of reality” (vi); Homi Bhabha describes the writing mode as “the literary language of the emergent postcolonial world,” a function that this work deals with more specifically and extensively in Chapter 5; and Fredric Jameson considers magical realism “a possible alternative to the narrative logic of contemporary postmodernism” (Warnes 1). Significantly, none of the quoted theorists refer to magical realism as a literary genre in its own right, but they all seem to situate the “literary language” or “narrative strategy” at the very core of postcolonial and postmodernist writing. At the other end of the spectrum, however, are the skeptics like Jean Franco, for whom magical realism is only “a little more than a brand name for exoticism” (Warnes 1). Alfred J. López also questions the legitimacy of the term, which he considers a “European term applied to a non-European literature” and “a futile European attempt to categorize and thus ‘understand’ it by this process of naming […] to ‘master’ the other’s difficult text?” (quoted in Wen-chin 15).\n\nWriting Horror\n\n5\n\nEstablishing a nexus between magical realist writing (viewed primarily as a postmodern literary phenomenon) and trauma (understood as an individual and as an often invisible cultural dominant) requires an interdisciplinary conceptual tool; the term that I propose, “traumatic imagination,” is intended to describe an empathy-driven consciousness that enables authors and readers to act out and/or work through trauma by means of magical realist images. I posit that the traumatic imagination is responsible for the production of many literary texts that struggle to re-present the unpresentable and, ultimately, to reconstruct events whose forgetting has proved just as unbearable as their remembering. The traumatic imagination is also the essential consciousness of survival to which the psyche resorts when confronted with the impossibility of remembering limit events and with the resulting compulsive repetition of images of violence and loss. * The concept of trauma has evolved from its original meaning of physical injury to that of psychological disorder and, more recently, to that of cultural phenomenon. In my analyses of four violent historical events—slavery, colonialism, the Holocaust, and war—I refer to these flickering time-space indicators as “shock chronotopes,” borrowing the term “chronotope” (time-space) from Mikhail Bakhtin and adding the “shock” component in the sense it carried in “shell-shock,” the World War I phrase for what we now call post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). When the overwhelming violence of an event prevents it from being rationalized and archived in the subject’s consciousness as it occurs, the traumatic time-space (the shock chronotope) is so shaky that making it artistically visible (turning it into an artistic chronotope) requires an act of imagination, which I call traumatic. Magical realist writing should be regarded not as an escape from horrific historical “facts” or as a distortion meant to make them more cognitively or emotionally palatable but rather as one of the most effective means of re-creating, transmitting, and ultimately coping with painful traumatic memories. In such a context, the re-presented or reconstructed truth will not be of what actually happened\n\n6\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nbut of what was experienced as happening. The traumatic imagination transforms individual and collective traumatic memories into narrative memories and integrates them into an artistic shock chronotope. Shock chronotopes are prone to reveal the intrinsically uncanny reality of traumatic events—histories that were and were not at the same time: they were, because more or less verifiable facts may attest their taking place; and they were not, because none of the events ever came to be stored in a coherent narrative memory, having eluded, at the very moment of its occurrence, the subject’s cognitive capabilities. Even if an event looks or sounds unreal, it has nevertheless come into being in a realistic context with real causes. As strange as the world of unfamiliar phenomena might seem at first glance, its simultaneous perception as familiar intriguingly suggests that it is, in fact, not a parallel universe or a world “beyond” but very much part and parcel of our “real” reality. Consequently, while a chronotope may seem quite real, its flicker (caused by repressed memories) will still convey strangeness and fear— the combination that makes the mind hesitate, delay its responses, and plunge into a state of uncertainty. Magical realism, as a mode of textual representation, gives traumatic events an expression that traditional realism could not, seemingly because magical realist images and traumatized subjects share the same ontological ground, being part of a reality that is constantly escaping witnessing through telling. Coping with an extreme state of uncertainty, as in an experience of the uncanny, is also characteristic of dealing with trauma. Whether the author is a primary witness of the extreme event or not, chances are that readers become secondary or tertiary witnesses of sorts, and possibly vicariously traumatized by the narrated events. However, being traumatized by proxy is not the same as being a victim: by transgressing the boundaries of verisimilitude, the magical realist text may both convey the authors’ empathy (through their narrators and/ or characters) and at the same time induce empathy on the part of the readers—not by appropriating the victims’ voices but, rather, by making them heard for the first time. And even if the extreme events which the text re-creates can be neither understood nor represented (in the\n\nWriting Horror\n\n7\n\ntraditional, mimetic sense) as a coherent history, magical realist writing takes on the daunting task of reconstructing history in order to bring it closer to the readers’ conceptual system and their affective world. * The magical realist effect has its roots in the reader-text relationship, and draws its exceptional suggestiveness from the apparently oxymoronic pairing of the real and the imaginary in this interaction. “The possible and the magic/imaginary subvert and open up the borders of the real. Both the real and the potential or the conceivable are rendered as ‘consorting together’ and enjoying the same level of legitimacy” (Manzanas, “Romance” 57). Indeed, the cohabitation of what is with what could be, of the natural with the supernatural, of the logical with the unexplainable, would not make reality magical in such a seamless manner if these antithetical elements were not treated on equal footing by narrators, characters, and readers. As with most postmodernist writing, the textualization of the reader is crucial in exposing all three sides of the mirror: the opaque, the reflective, and the reflected. In her 2004 study on magical realism as a literary and a cinematic narrative, Maggie Ann Bowers recognizes the narrative mode as “an intimate affair between the reader/viewer and the text/film” (128). Besides emphasizing the reader’s, or the viewer’s, role in the relationship, Bowers also points—in a somewhat defensive manner—to a larger applicability of magical realist theory than the exclusive domain of literature: “Far from being simply a fashionable narrative device, magic(al) realism has proved itself through the criticism it has generated to stimulate consideration of the relationship of fiction and representation to reality” (128). Indeed, as a postmodernist phenomenon, magical realism operates as a versatile and self-reflective mode of reality representation. Early- and mid-twentieth-century theorists, including Walter Benjamin and Situationists such as Guy Debord, have tried to explain a world made of representations, whose multilayered reproductions of reality seem to be constantly eluding us. According to Debord, for instance, “spectacle” is not merely “representation,” something related to “show,”\n\n8\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\n“performance,” or just an assemblage of images, but “rather, it is a social relationship between people that is mediated by images”; in the society of the spectacle, “all that once was directly lived has become mere representation” (12). I believe that the spectacle, as the “heart of society’s real unreality” (13), is in fact both the object and the medium of the magical realist narrative: although perceived as supernatural and out of this world, the magical realist image is nevertheless accepted by the reader as just another component of his or her “verifiable” world, an attribute that has itself undergone important semantic changes in the past few decades. Therefore, Ana María Manzanas’s rhetorical question targeting the present status of the real/imaginary dichotomy is relevant for our future understanding of magical realism: “If the real verges on what has traditionally been considered the unreal, and the tangible is made up of almost intangible entities such as atoms, protons, electrons, and quarks, then what becomes of the imaginary and the magical?” The critic’s conclusion that “many zones of the imaginary no longer stand in an oxymoronic relationship to the real, for the oxymoron is dispelled in the open arena of the possible and the heterogeneous” (“Romance” 59) may evidently prompt a quo-vadis type of reflection about the consistency of future magical realist texts, whose main narrative strength used to be founded on the very inconsistency of their ontological structure—on the oxymoronic cohabitation of the real and the imaginary. If what we now call reality is just as unverifiable by our senses as the supernatural, could it be that the realism in magical realism is coming around full circle, headed back for the Aristotelian representation model of mimesis? The answer is likely to be found in twentieth-century representation theories. By the 1980s, Debord’s society of the spectacle has further morphed into Jean Baudrillard’s world of simulacra. For Baudrillard, society is past the moment of the spectacle because of the gradual loss of all referent: what is left is just simulation, that is, “the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal” (1). On the other hand, according to Slavoj Žižek, it is our passion for the thrill of reality that might also prompt us to avoid it (Desert of the Real 9–10). Viewed from\n\nWriting Horror\n\n9\n\nthis perspective, we are all virtual magical realists, even to the point where our reality (signs, codes, messages) becomes more “real” than the Real we constantly try to recapture. Thus, the hyperreal is nothing but a spectacle without origins, very much like magical realism is the representation of events (seemingly) without a history, or the re-creation of an absence that first needs to be acknowledged before it can be assigned any meaning. However, magical realism creates more than just a depthless hyperreal, a multilayered reality of images of other images without any original referents. In a number of cases, magical realist hyperreality is meant to be a reconstruction, a re-presentation, of events that were “missed” in the first place because of their traumatic nature. Magical realist hyperreality is an affective (empathic) kind of reality, capable of bringing the pain and the horror home into the reader’s affective world: while it might not need to explain the unspeakable event (and perhaps, it neither could nor should), it can certainly make it felt and re-experienced in a vicarious way. If fairy tales, fantasy, and science fiction require the suspension of the reader’s disbelief as the sine qua non of the literary experience, magical realism, on the contrary, expects the reader to keep aware of its textual constructs and accept them as part of his or her “real” reality, as unreal as they may seem. Although realistic details may render images believable to readers, traditional realism usually stumbles at their transmission as reflections of rational, understandable experiences. Slavery, colonialism, the Holocaust, and war have constituted themselves as “histories” of extreme events hardly open to rational reflection or understanding. I consider the traumatic imagination as an expression of the consciousness of survival that so many authors of violent histories have come to share. While drawing on concepts such as collective memory and transgenerational trauma, my analyses do not approach the shock chronotopes of slavery, colonialism, the Holocaust, and war from a comparative perspective but, rather, within individualized historical contexts characterized by a common socio-cultural marker: trauma. Without setting up a dialogue between historical memories, I view memory as multidirectional, a term recently proposed and defined by Michael Rothberg.\n\n10\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nThe critic suggests that “we consider memory as multidirectional: as subject to ongoing negotiation, cross-referencing, and borrowing; as productive and not privative,” and calls the “interaction of different historical memories” multidirectional memory (Multidirectional Memory 3). Rothberg’s argument rests on the widespread scholarly use of Holocaust memory as a steppingstone toward analyses of other previous or later histories of violence through borrowing and cross-referencing, and on the willful overuse and overemphasis of its uniqueness: “The emergence of Holocaust memory on a global scale has contributed to the articulation of other histories—some of them predating the Nazi genocide, such as slavery, and others taking place later, such as the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62) or the genocide in Bosnia during the 1990s” (Multidirectional Memory 6). On an individual level, memory cross-referencing can also create screen memories (or Deckerrinerungen, Freud’s original term), that is, a more recent memory can replace an older memory, usually a more painful one. Conversely, in the case of several authors that I discuss here (Jean Rhys, Maryse Condé, Günter Grass, and Tim O’Brien), representing historical trauma (vicariously experienced in the first two cases and directly in the other two) constitutes a means of both covering up and working through a personal trauma of one kind or another. * I have chosen three Caribbean novels as case studies for the effectiveness of magical realist imagery in evoking the shock chronotope of slavery: Jean Rhys’s Wide Sargasso Sea, Alejo Carpentier’s The Kingdom of This World, and Maryse Condé’s I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem. To the characters and narrators of these texts, the tragic inaccessibility of both motherland and adoptive country leaves them with no other possibility of expression than the magical language of imagination. As the recently departed Édouard Glissant wrote, “Slavery is a struggle with no witnesses,” so that a “real” communication of its horrors will most likely never take place. For more than half a century now, Caribbean writers have been “writing their world into existence” (Caribbean\n\nWriting Horror\n\n11\n\nDiscourse 161), that is, defining the cultural identity of the geographical space in which they were born, which most of them left in their youths, and to which they never ceased to return throughout their lives. If Rhys re-creates history through intertextual experiments, Carpentier makes recourse to supernatural elements in order to reinvest it with a new kind of reality, and Condé brings history to life from official documents by making her protagonist use the power of magic and witchcraft. In spite of their implied truth value, facts, statistics, and numbers cannot produce the same kind of affects as events reconstructed through artistic images can. By virtue of their general purposes, historical records usually encompass the entire picture of a chronotope and order events in as intelligible a manner as possible; consequently, they often read as depthless, demystified narratives. However, when it comes to human lives, “truth” can rarely be used in the singular because it can never be squeezed into clear, logical, and unambiguous statements. Carpentier, Rhys, and Condé break down the official truth on record into individual fictional dramas that bring characters and events closer to the readers’ feelings. The artistic image of Carpentier’s language, for instance, is a linguistic hybrid (Bakhtin’s phrase): it belongs both to the linguistic consciousness of the author, whom I presume to be vicariously traumatized (based on biographic evidence), and to the linguistic consciousness of the represented victims, the actually traumatized and silenced slaves. The symbolic mediation in Carpentier’s text (the transfer between reality and the symbolic) takes place in two stages: first, Columbus’s letters and writings by different nineteenth-century authors transferred the reality of the actual chronotope (slavery) into different modes of representation; and second, Carpentier’s novel actually translates an already represented reality into artistic images. In this magical realist text, simulation results in an affective simulacrum, a reproduction with more color and depth to it than the original referent itself—thus, a simulacrum altogether different from Baudrillard’s shallow images that deny reality its “vital illusion” (its usually ambiguous signification). The stories of Macandal and Bouckman, the leaders of Haiti’s most important slave uprisings,\n\n12\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nand of Henri Christophe, post-independence Haiti’s first black ruler, are told from the point of view of the protagonist, Ti Noël. In spite of Macandal’s and Ti Noël’s metamorphoses into birds, insects, and other natural elements—alternatively symbolizing either an escape from or an expansion of their human condition—Haiti will continue to be plagued by violence, pain, and suffering, with no end in sight. If Carpentier’s artistic chronotope seems to perpetuate historical trauma, it is also a way of working through it. Wide Sargasso Sea (1966), Jean Rhys’s intertextual supplementation of Charlotte Brontë’s novel Jane Eyre (1847), is a challenging portrayal of post-slavery Jamaica, viewed through the eyes of the main character, Antoinette, a descendant of the Creole slaveholder class. Historical trauma in Rhys’s novel is experienced as individual loss, affecting the hybrid identities of Antoinette and her mother, Mrs. Cosway; and as cultural loss, resulting from the identity erasures of both an uprooted race (the African slaves) and a newly disenfranchised social group (the Jamaican white creoles). The relationship between Antoinette and her English husband (ironically, “bought” for her and paid for with her own dowry) fails tragically because of an unavoidable culture clash: the young Jamaican Creole’s personality is not only imbued with the mystery and magic of the islands but also marred by individual and historical trauma (she avoids talking about the insanity running in her family or about the atrocities of slavery, fearing that, if mentioned, they might become true). Her husband, on the other hand, a literary alter ego of Rochester, Brontë’s male protagonist, rejects any adaptation to Antoinette’s culture, and implicitly any understanding of her character, because he is apparently too afraid to cope with the strangeness of her environment and its mysterious, untold history. Like Carpentier’s The Kingdom of this World, Rhys’s Wide Sargasso Sea is an expression of the traumatic imagination, a traumatic narrative that may be viewed either as Rhys’s way of working through the trauma of a cultural displacement in childhood or as an expression of acting out a trauma of loss from which she failed to distance herself. In reality, the difference between these two fundamental modes of dealing with trauma is not so marked: sometimes\n\nWriting Horror\n\n13\n\nthere might be a certain degree of awareness in the process of acting out trauma just as at other times working through trauma may occur outside one’s consciousness. Nevertheless, as an attempt to signify trauma, or what Lacan and Žižek call a hole in the chain of signification, Rhys’s novel can be read as a narrative that writes, rather than writes about, historical trauma. Trauma enters Condé’s novel I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem (1986) just as abruptly as it usually strikes in real life: her protagonist and narrator, Tituba, is born of an instance of violence when her mother, Abena, is raped by a sailor on the ship taking her to slavery—an episode symbolic of the historical rape and abuse of her entire race. The historical realeme (Brian McHale’s phrase), the real-life person called Tituba, was the only black defendant in the Salem witch trials. Much like Carpentier, who witnessed Haitian slavery by proxy, through his readings, Condé uses her knowledge of the seventeenth-century Anglophone Caribbean and historical documents from the Massachusetts Bay colony to give voice to a historically neglected realeme: the character of Tituba comes to life in her pages as part of an artistic shock chronotope, slavery, whose reallife referent had entirely foreclosed the voices of its victims. Through the workings of Condé’s and her readers’ traumatic imaginations, magical realist writing evokes a shock chronotope by investing it with affect. Symbolically, Tituba becomes the prosopopoeia of a revitalized history, a naming of trauma itself. Violence and magic are ubiquitous in Condé’s narrative. Images of physical violence alternate with unexplainable events: the extraordinary enters the everyday and undermines its coherence, while its affect can quite easily traumatize readers. Scenes of hangings, rape, and torture are balanced in the emotional economy of the narrative by scenes of tenderness, love-making, healing, contemplation, and reflection on human nature. Besides the kind of metamorphoses used by Carpentier, Condé introduces ghosts several times in her narrative, but not as menacing spirits bent on haunting the living as they were in the Gothic literary tradition: magical realist ghosts are friendly, wisdom-dispensing physical entities who can be touched, hugged, and caressed by those who can transcend the ontological barrier between the\n\n14\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nreality of the senses and that of the imagination. It takes a certain kind of person, like Tituba or her mentor, Mama Yaya, to be able to see and hear them, as well as to listen and talk to them. Besides physical survival, surviving slavery also implies keeping the real story alive, the one that re-creates past traumatic events by attaching them to present affects and making them matter to the modern consciousness. Remembering the horrors of the past amounts to more than paying homage to the memories of their victims: it is also an identity-forming and healing act that entails confronting the unspeakable and coming to terms with trauma. * Chapter 5 focuses on images of colonial and postcolonial trauma incorporated in the magical realism of Gabriel García Márquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) and Salman Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children (1980). A brief analysis of la violencia (the period in Colombian history between the late 1940s and the mid 1960s) reveals it as the historical result of a much older shock chronotope: Spanish colonialism. Considering that García Márquez has not directly experienced any of the traumatic events that he re-presents in One Hundred Years of Solitude, I posit that his secondary witnessing and attempt at working through a vicariously induced trauma found expression through a traumatic type of imagination. On April 9, 1948, when Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, a Liberal politician, was assassinated, García Márquez was a law student at the National University in Bogotá, and eventually he spent the years of la violencia in Colombia’s Caribbean region. The author’s vicarious traumatization (by second-hand witnessing) may explain the frequent allusions to death through unnatural signs or persistent smells in One Hundred Years of Solitude. Besides analyzing different magical realist images in the novel, I focus on those indicative of psychic numbing, repressed memories, and the impossibility of telling. Among these, one scene of extreme violence stands out and projects the suggestive potential of magical realist writing: the massacre of three thousand striking workers of the banana company by government soldiers. The historical\n\nWriting Horror\n\n15\n\nrealeme took place in Ciénaga, on the night of December 5, 1928, after General Carlos Cortés Vargas was informed that the government had declared a state of siege in the banana zone. Historical records of the event each indicate a different number of casualties. In the novel, José Arcadio Segundo, one of the two survivors who can bear witness to the massacre, speaks of more than three thousand corpses; however, the exact number (even if an indicator of the size of the violence) loses its importance in the context of the overwhelming feeling of horror that traumatizes the survivors. What worsens the character’s trauma will be the eventual impossibility of telling about the violent death of so many: it is not so much the speech act, the utterance itself, that makes bearing witness impossible but the absence of a receptive audience willing to listen. In order to suggest the traumatizing effect of witnessing the shooting of thousands of people, García Márquez uses a kind of language that some have described as allegorical and others as poetic; I recognize in it the understated magical realist rendering of traumatic violence. Under conditions of overwhelming physical violence, language fails; and when it eventually tries to recapture the missed referent, it inevitably resorts to the traumatic imagination. Similarly to García Márquez, Rushdie uses the voice of the colonized and the language of the colonizer embedded in magical realist images in his 1980 novel Midnight’s Children in order to give life to a chronotope he has not experienced directly. Any unacknowledged loss or absence (caused by historical or structural trauma, respectively) can be traced and reconstituted by the traumatic imagination and turned into narrative memory by authors and their readers. Saleem Sinai, the narrator and protagonist in Rushdie’s novel, sees himself as fatefully tied toand endowed with special powers over—post-independence India’s history. In Rushdie’s postmodern reconstruction of history, Saleem’s birth at midnight on August 15, 1947, actually marks the emergence of modern, independent India. However, by the end of the novel, after having portrayed himself as an agent of history, Saleem ends up as one of its millions of victims. Saleem’s “handcuffing” to India’s history suggests precisely his lack of agency and, on a larger scale, the submission of\n\n16\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nthe colonial subject to a situation outside his control. If Saleem believes that he is the one determining the course of the new nation (in itself a contentious concept throughout the narrative), it is because he displays a compulsion to repeat unpleasant events (mostly historical ones) in order to gain control over them after they have already happened. Saleem is acting out historical trauma while, in the process of writing, the author is working through transgenerational trauma. Besides pointing out the latent trauma caused by two centuries of colonial oppression and an erasure of cultural identity, I analyze a scene of extreme physical violence, quite similar to the massacre of the striking banana workers in One Hundred Years of Solitude. However, unlike García Márquez’s third-person narrator, Rushdie’s first-person storyteller, Saleem, deliberately uses exact historical dates in order to deceive readers by giving his narrative an air of authenticity. The killing in Rushdie’s novel takes place on April 13, 1919, twenty-eight years before Saleem’s birth, when Brigadier R. E. Dyer, the Martial Law Commander of Amritsar, orders his troops to open fire on peaceful, unarmed demonstrators. Saleem recounts the event by using the point of view of his grandfather, the primary witness. The language of the scene shows the same attention to detail as in García Márquez and a similar recovery of an original trauma. Rushdie’s best magical realist scenes involve the 581 midnight’s children born on the same night as Saleem and the activities in which they use their supernatural powers. Magical images come to underscore postcolonial traumatization and Saleem’s unstable hybrid identity. Rushdie and García Márquez try to heal historical wounds by rewriting history itself. Whether their myths are called India or Macondo, the authors take on colonial (and postcolonial) traumata by having their characters start anew with a clean slate. Both novels serve as warnings that a human community, whether an entire nation or a village, may have a future only after it has given meaning to its past. * The chapter dedicated to the most horrific chronotope in human history, the Nazi genocide, analyzes Joseph Skibell’s A Blessing on the Moon\n\nWriting Horror\n\n17\n\n(1997) and Bernard Malamud’s The Fixer (1966). Although the two Jewish-American authors did not witness the Holocaust firsthand, they re-create its horrors in their novels by relying on their traumatic imaginations. Most critics of post-Holocaust writing tend to question the authority of a writer’s voice by his ethnicity and/or the nature of his connection to the event. Malamud’s novel is set in Czarist Russia, in 1911 Kiev, and its plot was inspired by the historic Mendel Beilis blood libel trial. By prolepsis, Malamud connects early twentieth-century anti-Semitism to the crimes of Nazi Germany that followed only a few decades later: the arbitrary arrest of the novel’s main character, Yakov Bok, his two-and-a-half years of abusive detention, and the concocted accusations to which he is subjected are all harbingers of the atrocities of the Holocaust. In spite of its preponderantly realistic scenes, the narrative incorporates a number of fantasy elements particularly in the last scenes of the prison episode: a succession of dream sequences tends to blur the borderline between reality and imagination as readers are given little or no notice of the shifts between the two ontological levels of the text—an ambiguity characteristic of magical realist writing. Fantasy has the suggestive power of making the reality of the plot more vivid in the readers’ eyes. Malamud seems to be aware of the importance of illusion in our perceptions of the world: when in one of his out-of-this-world experiences Yakov shoots Czar Nicholas the Second, he actually proposes an alternative history that would start with What if? “Guessing what reality is” was once acknowledged by Malamud as his way of living his life; in the novel, however, it could also describe what Yakov does many times while in prison. However, one cannot speak of pure fantasy if a dream sequence interrupts the character’s moments of waking: whenever the ontological status of the fantasy scene becomes questionable, I discern the magical realist writing mode. Skibell pushes the limits of imaginative fiction even farther than Malamud did. The very first scene in A Blessing on the Moon is indicative of the narrator-character’s extreme trauma: nothing can probably be more traumatic than the experience of violent death. The narrative voice of the victim, Chaim Skibelski, is even more understated than that of Malamud’s narrator as it renders the scene of his execution not so much\n\n18\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nthrough realistic visual details as through the subjective, ambiguous sensation of someone being shot in the back of the head without any prior warning. Similar to the scenes of massacre in Rushdie and García Márquez, Skibell’s also lacks specific words denoting physical violence, such as bullets or blood, and relies more on the affective charge of the experience. Most fantasy elements in Skibell’s novel are symbolic of trauma: for example, when the same soldier who apparently shot Chaim in the beginning of the novel (we are not shown or told about any shooters at that point) sneaks up on him saying, “One step more, and I’ll kill you again” (98), the scene becomes an indication of the repetition compulsion that characterizes all acting out of trauma (by victims and perpetrators alike, however different their ethical status). Too horrible to have been rationalized when it occurred, the original event keeps returning with the same affective impact that it had the first time. While Malamud directed his satire against the religious superstitions and intolerance of Russian Orthodox Christians, Skibell portrays a Polish family’s complicity with the persecution of the town’s Jewish minority. The Serafinskis show no pangs of conscience while enjoying the home, furniture, and household items that used to belong to Chaim Skibelski only hours before his execution. During World War II, the attitudes of the Poles and other European nations toward the Nazis’ genocidal practices oftentimes ranged from indifference to passive acquiescence or even active participation in acts of repression and violence—which might constitute yet another argument against the barbaric character of any imaginative literature after Auschwitz (according to Theodor Adorno). Before dogmatically foreclosing any new avenues for fictive reconstructions of the Holocaust by contemporary or future, Jewish or non-Jewish writers, one should also consider the alternatives: forgetting, trivialization, or even flat denial of the unspeakable horrors of the Nazi genocide. * Probably no other shock chronotope has maintained more of its poignant actuality and horrendous impact on the human psyche than\n\nWriting Horror\n\n19\n\nwar. Paradoxically, however, neither of the two novels discussed in the last chapter, Günter Grass’s Tin Drum (1959) and Tim O’Brien’s Going after Cacciato (1978), can be said to be about war, but rather about an “unusual” state of mind induced by the war chronotope (perceived as “usual” by everyone affected, however). If Carpentier, Rhys, and Condé represented the shock chronotope of slavery in an apparent attempt to deal with vicarious traumatization caused by reading texts of historical violence (according to their own admissions); if García Márquez and Rushdie re-created the chronotope of colonialism and early postcolonialism after either witnessing political violence (García Márquez) or discovering the tumultuous past of a culture of origin (Rushdie); and if Malamud and Skibell fictionalized the chronotope of the Holocaust in order to bear witness to transgenerational trauma, Grass and O’Brien write the chronotope of war as an act of both re-covering and working through personal traumata, and of coping with simmering, but acutely painful, feelings of guilt. Surprisingly, critics such as Michelle Balaev have expressed their doubts about the theory of intergenerational trauma, which “limits the meaning of trauma in literature because it conflates the distinctions between personal loss actually experienced by an individual and a historical absence found in one’s ancestral lineage” (151). What Balaev and others seem to be missing is, first, the way screen memories work in covering up historical trauma; second, the legitimacy of bearing witness by proxy; and third, the synecdochic and metonymic character of literature, that is, its capability of creating universal meanings through limited plots and individual characters. The sheer fact that Grass and O’Brien have artistically re-created a shock chronotope based on personal experiences does not in the least make their narratives any more believable than the other novels that I discuss, written by non-participants in, or secondary witnesses of, a shock chronotope. While I duly acknowledge the importance of the biographical elements embedded or suggested in The Tin Drum and in Going after Cacciato, my point is that the apparent fictional-memoir forms, in spite of their implied tone of authenticity, do not necessarily invest the accounts with any more historical/documentary authority than purely\n\n20\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nfictional/imaginative forms would—an issue that I also briefly address in the Holocaust chapter. While Oskar Matzerath and Paul Berlin, as imperfect mirrors of their authors, remain unreliable narrators who desperately try to remodel their pasts and subconsciously re-cover their traumata, the authors, Grass and O’Brien, are both acting out and working through their own unresolved traumata and feelings of guilt. Their common message may be summed up in the question “what if?” What if there are several angles from which events may be viewed before they can be turned into facts and made part of a coherent narrative? What if things had happened differently? What if they can happen differently? Compelled to learn how to live with trauma in order to survive, both authors and main characters manage to prompt readers—as opposed to telling them by ostentatious moralizing—to ponder on valuable lessons about human violence and injustice, guilt, complacency, and most importantly, the impossibility of innocence. Standing by and passively contemplating horror can only amount to guilt by association. Similar to Rushdie’s blending of magic and reality, Grass’s style is imbued with maybe less varied but undoubtedly more obsessively recurring magical realist elements, such as the effects of the main character’s drumming and those of his screaming. The object after which the novel is entitled stands, on the one hand, for Oskar’s means of expressing his anger and of gathering knowledge, and on the other hand, for his way of recovering (i.e., ordering and understanding) memories. In Schmuh’s Onion Cellar, in one of the late chapters of the novel, Oskar picks up his drum and plays with his heart: “It was a three-year-old Oskar who picked up those drumsticks. I drummed my way back, I drummed up the world as a three-year-old sees it” (533), that is, a world in which people know guilt and can still cry. Oskar’s screaming, audibly or inaudibly, causes a number of magical effects, such as the unbuttoning of Auntie Kauer’s black silk dress (74), the scraping of his first schoolmistressMiss Spollenhauer’s glasses (83), the shattering of all the windows and doors of the Stadt Theater (105), of Christmas tree decorations (260), and more. Oskar’s universe is one in which one has to stop growing and stay a gnome in order to circumvent any sense of responsibility and\n\nWriting Horror\n\n21\n\nduty, as well as any feeling of guilt that adults might readily burden one with. This utterly unreliable narrator’s sometimes playful and sometimes grotesquely exaggerated actions speak for the common man who feels caught up in the whirlwinds of history, but at the same time questions his passivity and his innocence. If Grass and his narrator experience times of war from a civilian’s perspective, O’Brien’s narrator finds himself smack in the middle of combat, of real life-and-death situations. Oscillating between feelings of guilt and illusions of innocence, O’Brien’s main character, Private First Class Paul Berlin, creates an alternate reality in which his guilt is supposed to be atoned for by desertion, and his sense of duty fulfilled by capturing a deserter named Cacciato. What Berlin ultimately finds out is that one cannot flee one’s obligations by escaping into dreams, and conversely, that dreams may constitute a reality consistent enough to replace the one that one wishes to leave behind. While sharing significant traits with his author, such as the experience of Vietnam, the guilt over participating in a war with whose purposes and methods he does not agree, or the need to prove himself in front of his father and his community, Paul Berlin is not Tim O’Brien. The novel, which critics have constantly dubbed as a war novel, much to its author’s dismay, makes intensive use of heteroglossia: a nameless third-person narrator goes in and out the main character’s mind, and sometimes it seems that Paul Berlin’s voice alternates with Tim O’Brien’s, the implied author’s. By creating Berlin, O’Brien attempts to work through his Vietnam trauma, while his main character consistently tries to dream his way out of it, or, in other words, to re-cover it. “He wasn’t dreaming, or imagining; just pretending,” the narrator tells us. Berlin’s dream starts at the critical moment in which he is supposed to start the squad’s ambush of Cacciato, the deserter whose courage everyone secretly admires, and whose recklessness everyone openly hates. The traumatic moment leaves a hole in Berlin’s memory (“What, in fact, had become of Cacciato?”) that he feels compelled to fill, so he rephrases the question more precisely, “what part was fact and what part was the extension of fact?” (O’Brien 27) If there is a\n\n22\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\ntype of event in the novel that hardly lends itself, if at all, to becoming fact, it is inarguably death. Death is a constant, casual presence throughout the narrative. The narrator catalogues the names of eight dead comrades in the first seven sentences in the opening paragraph, and the ominous understatement at the beginning of the novel, “It was a bad time,” will be repeated several times thereafter, whenever scenes of extreme violence are described. The matter-of-fact tone of the narrative, which accounts for a certain degree of psychic numbing on the narrator’s and on the main character’s parts, also suggests a sort of moral “vacuum” for lack of “conceptual supplies” (Doc Peret’s phrases). One cannot possibly have order in a vacuum, without any substance. However, in any war, death becomes its own purpose, and in O’Brien’s novel, Lieutenant Sidney Martin is fascinated by it. What appeals to him is “the chance to confront death many times”; he believes in war as “a means of confronting ending itself, many repeated endings” (166). And yet, his ending can never be mentioned because it can be neither real nor imaginable; fratricide is too horrendous an act to understand and to remember. In the moral fog of war, good and evil are difficult to tell apart, and O’Brien does not take sides in the conundrum exactly because of the lack of order, purpose, and meaning in his narrator’s memories. * Writing horror is more than a gratuitous experiment in literary form: it combines creativity and political activism, as well as a genuine moral engagement founded on empathy, responsibility, and ultimately the courage to face what reason has refused to capture in an ordered stream of signification, and what official public discourse has marginalized as an “inappropriate” topic. While vicarious traumatization is usually what prompts a trauma narrative, the act of storytelling itself, by ordering facts into a coherent history, becomes an act of witnessing. Kaplan associates the term “witnessing” with “prompting an ethical response that will perhaps transform the way someone views the world, or thinks about justice.” In the theorist’s view, “witnessing leads to a broader\n\nWriting Horror\n\n23\n\nunderstanding of the meaning of what has been done to victims, of the politics of trauma being possible” (123). I believe that the link between trauma and the writing that recovers it is established through the traumatic imagination, a compulsive call for storytelling, an inner urge of the authors’ psyche to restore, through their narrators and characters, voices that histories of horror and eventual post-traumatic cultures have reduced to silence. The fantastic, as an essential component of magical realism, comes to bridge the caesura in the transmission of violent realities. Magical realism writes the silence that trauma keeps reverting to, and converts it into history. ***\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nLIVING WITH TRAUMA THE UNCANNY REALITY OF SHOCK CHRONOTOPES Long before it came to be described as a complex psychological condition in the late nineteenth century, trauma had been a recurrent marker of the human collective psyche along its turbulent journey through history. Originating in extreme events whose full meaning society could not possibly have grasped when they happened because their violence and non-conformity to its established sense of the real eluded understanding, trauma has afflicted individual identities and has left enduring scars on entire cultures. Those directly affected by it have either subconsciously acted it out, or have consciously tried to work through it, or have eventually found themselves crushed by it; psychiatrists have tried their best to counter its disruptive, and often destructive, effects; psychologists and sociologists have analyzed its causes, forms of manifestation, and impact on human subjectivity and sense of identity; politicians have taken advantage of its social implications; and artists have dug deep into their emotional and imaginative resources to represent it. Whichever the case,\n\n26\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\none must acknowledge an incontestable fact: to one extent or another and depending on one’s status—of victim, witness, or perpetrator— everyone touched by trauma has also had to live with it as one would with an integral part of one’s existence, albeit one with disintegrating effects. Trauma has constantly compelled those directly or indirectly affected by it to rethink their identities and to reshape their lives, to write and rewrite their histories. Ultimately, it has enabled humanity to look at a future that, in the absence of an understanding and coming to terms with its past, would remain disconcertingly empty and meaningless. Human history in general and its last two centuries in particular have seen atrocities resulting in mass injury and death of such magnitude that they defy not only understanding but also imagination. I will henceforth refer to all geo-historical frameworks characterized by extreme events as “shock chronotopes.”1 Shock chronotopes need to be understood as time-spaces marked by events whose violence has rendered them resistant to rationalization and adequate representation. Events that happened to one may thus continue to seem unfamiliar because, at the time of their occurrence, the subject lacked any conceptual tools adequate for their assimilation. However, they could also look familiar, as one consistently revisits them and tries to live them, for the first time, as delayed experiences. Therefore, I posit that the uncanny reality of shock chronotopes is responsible for triggering similarly uncanny traumatic responses. By relating unstable time-spaces to both the production and the representation of trauma, I establish a homology between traumatic experiences, the traumatic imagination, and the magical realist mode of writing. The nexus between trauma and its means of representation in literary imagery in general, and in magical realist fiction in particular, is determined by psychological, socio-cultural, historical, and literary factors. The evolution of the concept of trauma reflects the progress of scientific knowledge regarding the sources of trauma, its manifestations, and its impact on a subject’s identity. The relation between an unstable timespace—a shock chronotope—and its corresponding artistic chronotope brings into question the kind of language that one is supposed to use when speaking about trauma without hurting the victims’ memories or\n\nLiving with Trauma\n\n27\n\neven injuring oneself. Testimonial language continually struggles to recapture reality in a culture in which signifiers have come to signify other signifiers, and the signifieds have all but disappeared. The connections between traumatic memory and narrative memory, on the one hand, and between traumatic memory and imagination, on the other, demonstrate the viability of the concept of traumatic imagination as a methodological tool to be applied in the analysis of magical realist writing and its postmodernist context. * Derived from the Greek traumatizo, meaning “to wound,” trauma originally referred to a shock to the body. In its first medical usage, the term denoted what we now call whiplash injury—or what the nineteenth century called “railway spine.” “Railway spine” was used to describe severe back pain usually incurred in the wake of train accidents, without any apparent physical injury to the back. The transfer of the concept of trauma from the physical to the psychological had occurred by 1885 “when a French medical thesis on trauma could routinely have a chapter on traumatisme morale. That was the year that Freud came to Paris to study under Charcot” (Leydesdorff et al.). The study of trauma first gained momentum after the wars of the nineteenth century—the Crimean War (1854–1856) and the American Civil War (1861–1865)— when soldiers who had experienced combat started displaying a variety of mental disturbances. The term neurasthenia came into circulation to describe individuals “suffering from phobias, nightmares and nervousness, arguably a male equivalent of ‘hysteria’ ” (Leydesdorff et al. 3). In the aftermath of World War I, a new term, “shell shock,” came into use and raised quite a few controversies in the medical arena. In World War II, trauma research conducted by the military reached across the Atlantic, and studies in the U.S. started focusing on so-called “combat fatigue.” Finally, the modern term in general circulation today, and not limited to soldiers’ experiences anymore—“post-traumatic stress disorder” or PTSD—became part of the medical jargon in the post-Vietnam years. Although the psychological condition first caught the attention of\n\n28\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nthe medical community particularly when induced by extremely violent events, involving severe injuries to the human body, the ways of describing, analyzing, and therapeutically engaging its symptoms have undergone several changes over the past century. In his 1920 work Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Sigmund Freud reassessed the importance he had assigned to the libido in his previous writings, and argued—with his trademark philosophical panache—for the powerful role of a death drive in the functioning of human consciousness and of all living organisms in general. If dreams were just symbolic wish fulfillments, as stated in his earlier works, how does one explain nightmares, let alone recurring nightmares? The answer, briefly formulated, is that the life of an organism does not seem to be determined so much by the reception of stimuli, after all, as it is by the protection against them. (Freud, Beyond the Pleasure Principle 30). Consequently, the organism sets up a defense system meant to block outside “intruders” that threaten to induce feelings of unpleasure. But what happens if a stimulus comes from within? In the case of “internal excitations which produce too great an increase of unpleasure, there is a tendency to treat them as though they were acting, not from the inside, but from the outside, so that it may be possible to bring the shield against stimuli into operation as a means of defence against them” (Freud, Beyond the Pleasure Principle 33). Dealing with internal stimuli as if they were external in order to activate the protective shield lies at the origin of projection, a syndrome characterizing many pathological processes. In reference to excitations that do break through the shield, Freud uses the qualifier “traumatic”: We describe as “traumatic” any excitations from outside which are powerful enough to break through the protective shield. It seems to me that the concept of trauma necessarily implies a connection of this kind with a breach in an otherwise efficacious barrier against stimuli. Such an event as an external trauma is bound to provoke a disturbance on a large scale in the functioning of the organism’s energy and to set in motion every possible defensive measure. (Beyond the Pleasure Principle 33)\n\nLiving with Trauma\n\n29\n\nBy “disturbance on a large scale,” Freud seems to be hinting at the inception of an “internal” trauma, that is, a virtual re-creation of the “external” trauma that could not be blocked by the barrier of consciousness. One “possible defensive measure” could thus consist in a simulated, and sometimes obscurely symbolized, repetition of the breakthrough, probably in an attempt 1) to reenact, post facto, a situation in which the organism was caught unprepared, with its defenses down, and 2) to remedy that failure—to make sure that, next time around, it will be ready.2 Jean-Martin Charcot, Freud’s mentor at the Salpêtrière, had already used the term “traumatic hysteria,” which the Berlin doctor Hermann Oppenheim later renamed “traumatic neurosis,” “keeping the idea of ‘psychic shock’ but expanding the range of symptoms…” (Farrell 9). It is at this juncture that the concept acquires a clear definition, which will henceforth include the idea of a compulsion to repeat, symbolically, an event whose experiencing was missed at the moment of its occurrence. In this rather early formulation already, the original meaning of “wound” is replaced by that of “state of being wounded,” an acceptation that, in its turn, will later develop into “a series of symptoms,” acquiring a much more complex semantic load. In its latter meaning, the concept of trauma includes both the physical and the behavioral signs of the condition of “being wounded” as well as the specific responses triggered by that condition—which ultimately make it recognizable as a psychological disorder. It was only in the 1980s that the American Psychiatric Association officially acknowledged the psychological condition prevalent in veterans of the Vietnam War by calling it post-traumatic stress disorder. According to the APA, PTSD is made up of a series of symptoms that follow a psychologically distressing event “generally outside the range of usual human experience.” The symptoms usually manifest as “a preoccupation with the traumatic event in the form of nightmares, flashbacks, or persistent thoughts about the trauma that intrude into everyday affairs; and a general dysphoria, a numbness that takes the meaning out of life and makes it hard to relate to other people” (Tal 135). In certain cases, the symptoms may paradoxically involve a “state of ‘high arousal’\n\n30\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nor hyper-alertness to certain stimuli, particularly those which evoke reminders of the original trauma” (Leydesdorff et al. 5). These recurring evocations of the original event, which echo Freud’s description of the compulsion to repeat activities of repressed impulses (Beyond the Pleasure Principle 21), gained currency in the writings of Cathy Caruth, Dori Laub, Shoshana Felman, and others in the late 1990s. Caruth, for example, offers a general definition of trauma as “the response to an unexpected or overwhelming violent event or events that are not fully grasped as they occur, but return later in repeated flashbacks, nightmares, and other repetitive phenomena” (Caruth, Unclaimed Experience 91). Years may pass until trauma victims first attempt to turn the violent event into an assimilable experience; their attempts may, of course, go on forever because timelessness is another attribute of trauma.3 In the introduction to her 1995 collection of essays Trauma: Explorations in Memory, Caruth remarks that the pathology of PTSD resides exclusively in the reception of the traumatic event, which, unassimilated when it occurred, comes to possess the experiencing subject through repetition. “To be traumatized,” she concludes, “is precisely to be possessed by an image or event” (Trauma 4–5). Caruth seems to be on to something more here than the superficial idea of “image” as the faithful mirroring of an event. Since the 1980s, sociologists like Jean Baudrillard have been describing late twentieth-century society as a world of simulacra, where one is bombarded not so much with images or events anymore as with “image-events,”4 that is, events one can experience exclusively through the mediation of images. There are no real events anymore, Baudrillard contends, just images of other images—hence the recent extrapolations of the term “trauma.” Trauma has come to describe “the experience of both victims—those who have suffered directly—and those who suffer with them, or through them, or for them, if only by reading about trauma” (Miller and Tougaw 2), or watching, almost on a daily basis, images thereof. Even if the beginnings of the concept of “trauma” rely almost entirely on the presence of a violent physical injury or that of a near-death experience, history has meanwhile offered us incontestable proof that a sustained\n\nLiving with Trauma\n\n31\n\nstate of anxiety and/or fear may also produce symptoms of trauma. Kai Erikson, who held lectures before Romanian audiences just a few years after the fall of the Ceausescu regime, had the opportunity to witness firsthand the symptoms of a collective trauma when trying to have people talk about their lives under Communism. His way of approaching trauma, based on the analysis of its sources, does not deviate from Freud’s but adds, rather, a relevant aspect to it: “In order to serve as a generally useful concept, ‘trauma’ has to be understood as resulting from a constellation of life experiences as well as from a discrete happening, from a persisting condition as well as from an acute event” (Erikson 185). The structure of the traumatic experience, however, has to do less with its sources than with the dynamics governing its forgetting, remembering, and repeating: it is therein that the historicity of trauma reveals itself. “The historical power of the trauma is not just that the experience is repeated after its forgetting, but that it is only in and through its inherent forgetting that it is first experienced at all” (Caruth, Unclaimed Experience 17). This apparent paradox was not lost on Freud either. In his essay “Recollection, Repetition and Working Through,” he remarked that certain trauma patients remembered something that could never have been forgotten because at the time it went completely unnoticed. His conclusion was that “it seems to make no difference whatever whether [something] was conscious and then was forgotten or whether it never reached consciousness at all” (Freud, “Recollection, Repetition and Working Through” 368). This latency, which Caruth assigns not to the process of forgetting per se but to the experience of trauma, reveals itself, becomes visible, in the subject’s actions. Freud also noticed that “[the patient] reproduces [the forgotten and repressed] not in his memory but in his behaviour; he repeats it, without of course knowing that he is repeating it” (Freud, “Recollection, Repetition and Working Through” 369). The observation is important because it confirms that trauma comes about outside of the human consciousness: it escapes knowing at every step of the way, whether it is remembering, repeating, or working through. Because trauma is positioned outside the realm of reason, it would seem that any attempt to detect its existence would be doomed to failure.\n\n32\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nAlthough this might be generally the case with traumatized subjects, the ways in which they act out trauma may still become visible to the outside observer or secondary witness (family member, psychoanalyst, social interviewer, historian, reader, etc.). The most common of these manifestations is repetitive behavior, which, as it happens without the subject’s knowledge or intention, Freud called “repetition compulsion.” In his later writings, Freud realized that the compulsion to repeat does not reactualize only experiences of pleasure, as he would have expected according to his earlier theory based on the pleasure principle, but also events that have caused the ego unpleasure and have therefore been repressed.5 This became the line of thinking that would lead to his discussion of traumatic neuroses. The idea of trauma as repeated suffering has since then been elaborated on by theorists such as Cathy Caruth, Bessel A. van der Kolk and Onno van der Hart (in collaboration), as well as by the Lacanian Linda Belau, among others. Traumatic memories, these diamonds in the rough of memory that are responsible for the compulsion to repeat, are substitutes for that which cannot be represented. Translated into Lacanian terms by Belau, the compulsion to repeat “bears the real; that something beyond-the-signified which, in the scope of the drives, is a repressed, forgotten correlate of being rather than a knowable object of representation” (Belau xxi). At the same time, however, the repressed real becomes visible under different forms—traumatic symptoms, acting out, and so forth—in the symbolic. Writing, in trauma literature and in magical realist fiction, may be both an unconscious way of acting out trauma as well as a conscious struggle to work through it. * By bearing the real, “that something beyond-the-signified” (Belau), the compulsion to repeat also perpetuates the foreclosure of any possibility for knowledge or representation. As such a crisis of the referent (primarily due to its inaccessibility) may not be sustainable, or “bearable,” ad infinitum without irrevocably eroding the most intimate fabric of the psyche, an understanding of trauma can lead to a reappropriation\n\nLiving with Trauma\n\n33\n\nof history by reevaluating its (lost) referentiality. “Through the notion of trauma,” argues Caruth, “we can understand that a rethinking of reference is aimed not at eliminating history but at resituating it in our understanding, that is, at precisely permitting history to rise where immediate understanding may not” (Caruth, Unclaimed Experience 11). Rethinking reference and rewriting history should by no means be viewed as a distortion of facts but rather as a healing process of turning unassimilated events into facts. Therapy, in this case, amounts to much more than a simply medical corrective: it is a delayed restoration of a referent that escaped the subject’s perception at the time of its occurrence. If trauma—and specifically the kind resulting from loss—has historical foundations, it is also true that a history of trauma will most likely be accessible only through trauma, as if it were experienced for the first time. “For history to be a history of trauma means that it is referential precisely to the extent that it is not fully perceived as it occurs,” explains Caruth, “or to put it somewhat differently, that a history can be grasped only in the very inaccessibility of its occurrence” (Unclaimed Experience 18). The symptoms of traumatic experience do not contain any element of falsehood but actually constitute a pathology of history itself. The constant return of the extreme occurrence remains always true to the original event. Nevertheless, it is not only close encounters with death that may result in trauma but also the fact of having survived without knowing it: survival thus becomes just as incomprehensible as the experience of imminent death.6 Caruth is not alone in suggesting an understanding of history within an epistemology of trauma. In Post-traumatic Culture (1998), Kirby Farrell asserts that “As an interpretation of the past, trauma is a kind of history. Like other histories, it attempts to square the present with its origins. […] Because not everybody in a given culture is likely to be neurologically afflicted, or affected the same way, trauma is always to some extent a trope” (Farrell 14). Farrell reveals the core meaning of the concept of trauma, expanding its epistemological function (interpretation of the past) to a representational one (trope). In relating trauma to history, on the one hand, and to modern culture, on the other, his study makes a\n\n34\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nchallenging point: considering that there has not been a single period in human history completely devoid of suffering or the threat of death, all history has been in all likelihood, and continues to be, traumatic. Trauma can help to understand cultural behavior in general, especially if one takes into account the collective nature of historical experiences.7 In establishing his argument, Farrell lays out four characteristics of PTSD that he believes make it adequate for an analysis of culture. The first is that “an injury can continue to influence behavior long after the initial impact,” so that a certain behavior does not necessarily have to be “a direct reaction to a massive injury, but may represent the cumulative effect of a number of small but synergistic shocks” (Farrell 11). The second quality is the frequency of dissociation in PTSD, which results in “uncanny alterations of consciousness, which George Orwell called ‘doublethink.’ […] Traumatic dissociation represents a loss of control, panic in the face of what is unthinkable” (Farrell 11). The third characteristic is contagiousness, “the ‘vicarious traumatization’ that may usually afflict therapists when working with victims” (Farrell 12). And the fourth trait of post-traumatic experience is “the way in which it destabilizes the ground of conventional reality and arouses death anxiety. […] Cultural integrity and death anxiety are closely and reciprocally related” (Farrell 12). Moreover, besides the patient/therapist relationship, the phenomenon of vicarious traumatization also involves the larger and more subtle process of intergenerational transmission as well as the ethical implications of empathy (secondary witnesses’ identification with the victims/survivors). The disruptive effects of death anxiety on cultural integrity account, historically, for the calculated politicization and ideological manipulation of trauma. The latency inherent to trauma becomes visible not only in the behavior and actions of the traumatized, but also in that of their families and other listeners—even when the latter are temporally removed from them. “A phenomenon of delayed response, trauma often unfolds intergenerationally; its aftermath lives on in the family—but no less pervasively in the culture at large. The story can deeply affect those who have not stood directly in the path of historical trauma, who do not share bloodlines\n\nLiving with Trauma\n\n35\n\nwith its victims” (Miller and Tougaw 9). Doubled by transmissibility, or contagiousness, the latency of trauma comes to confirm the rather widespread assumption that trauma has generally—and theoretically, at least—no end. There is no miracle cure or antidote that could erase it completely and irrevocably: there are only ways of learning how to cope with it, how to counteract its disruptive effects, and ultimately, how to live with it.8 Although there are no clear rules that would delimit and govern one’s responses to another’s trauma, and implicitly, one’s own vicarious traumatization, there is a morally reprehensible dimension to the total identification with the victims and the appropriation of their suffering—hence Dominick LaCapra’s coinage of the term “empathic unsettlement”: “Being responsive to the traumatic experience of others, notably of victims, implies not the appropriation of their experience but what I would call empathic unsettlement, which should have stylistic effects or, more broadly, effects in writing which cannot be reduced to formulas or rules of method” (LaCapra 41). Empathic unsettlement is a vicarious type of experience involving both the recognition of difference and the keeping of distance from the victim’s position;9 moreover, it may also constitute a way of addressing traumatic events and of “composing narratives that neither confuse one’s own voice or position with the victim’s nor seek facile uplift, harmonization, or closure but allow the unsettlement that they address to affect the narrative’s own movement in terms of both acting out and working through” (LaCapra 78). My concept of “traumatic imagination” comes quite close to the witness response proposed by LaCapra. As the traumatic imagination may result from both direct and vicarious traumatization, the narratives it engenders—which may themselves be manifestations of the processes of either acting out or working through trauma, or sometimes both—will be symbolized representations of trauma as well as new conduits for further traumatization. In its latter form of manifestation (originating in vicarious traumatization), the traumatic imagination necessarily needs to be founded on empathic unsettlement lest the voices of the victims be silenced or distorted beyond recognition.\n\n36\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nWhether they are founded on empathic unsettlement or they induce it, trauma narratives are often powerful enough to engage readers, as secondary witnesses, and to elicit responses to traumatic events to the point that the readers come to discover signs of their own personal traumata. A literature of trauma may thus play an important role in subject identifications and in creating an openness and a disposition to listen to the voice of the other.10 Amidst so many histories of unspeakable violence, understanding trauma could well establish that much-desired link between cultures, not merely by acknowledging the past of the Other, but more importantly, by clearing up one’s own. It is the same process of distancing—only this time from oneself—and of creating, thus, a unique perspective on one’s identity in relation to the Other. “In a catastrophic age,” remarks Caruth, “trauma itself may provide the very link between cultures: not as a simple understanding of the pasts of other but rather, within the traumas of contemporary history, as our ability to listen through the departures we have all taken from ourselves” (Caruth, “Introduction” 11). However, as human knowledge in general, interpretations of trauma may also entail negative consequences. As history has proven, trauma is capable of shattering reality—an entire culture’s generally accepted sense of normality—and of jeopardizing social cohesiveness and cultural integrity by exacerbating death anxiety. In the modern age, the politicization of trauma has become almost inevitable. “Whatever the physical distress, trauma is also psychocultural, because the injury entails interpretation of the injury,” writes Farrell. “[…] Because trauma can be ideologically manipulated, reinforced, and exploited—it calls for critical analysis as well as psychiatric intervention” (Farrell 7). Because psychiatric intervention relies, more often than not, on bearing witness to injury, witnessing can itself become a revolutionary act, a cry against any attempt to appropriate the experience of the traumatized. Kalí Tal describes bearing witness as an aggressive act, which “is born out of a refusal to bow to outside pressure to revise or to repress experience, a decision to embrace conflict rather than conformity, to endure a lifetime of anger\n\nLiving with Trauma\n\n37\n\nand pain rather than to submit to the seductive pull of revision and repression. I am not using a trope when I say that trauma has grown on us. As if nature’s tremendous capacity to inflict deadly wounds (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, epidemics, etc.) on our bodies and minds had not been enough to threaten our very existence on earth, we rose to the challenge and proved to ourselves that we could do it a lot better, faster, and more efficiently. And whenever we pretended to ignore our traumatic pasts—slavery, colonialism, wars, the Holocaust, and Communism, or downplayed their significance hoping that their memories would just go away, they did not; on the contrary, as recent events have shown, traumatic memories have kept coming back to haunt us with a vengeance. The anti-colonial movements in the 1950s and the following decades first brought home to the Western world the feeling of guilt for having inflicted trauma on a mass scale. For example, in the case of France, “the fight for openness about mass slaughter and torture during the Algerian war created a cultural space for talking about the effects of trauma, which appealed especially to those who doubted the moral supremacy of the West” (Leydesdorff et al. 10). The humiliation suffered by the United States in the nine-year-long Vietnam War was supposed to have been purged clean by the almost casualty-free First Gulf War in 1991. The video images of “smart” bombs hitting their targets with deadly but at the same time “clean” accuracy (no blood or mangled body parts) were meant to create the comforting feeling of a “just” war and to bring about, implicitly, some kind of tragic catharsis in the living-room audiences back home, thousands of miles away. Then followed the debacle of the humanitarian-military intervention in Somalia, the new millennium witnessed the horror of devastating attacks on the U.S. homeland for the first time in history, and then came the Second Gulf War in 2003. Just as violence proved to beget violence, trauma begot trauma. In other parts of the world, maybe less “interesting” for most of the living-room crowd trying to fight its daily boredom in front of the TV screen, traumatic histories followed a similar pattern of repetition. The Rwandan genocide was the Hutus’ way of redeeming their ethnic pride after decades\n\n38\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nof colonial oppression and Tutsi domination. The Balkan massacres and “ethnic cleansings” were the Serbs’ way of affirming their national identity, which they felt was threatened again by virtue of the traumatic memory of six centuries of Muslim rule. We seem to be constantly ready to fight death anxiety by inflicting it on the Other—and thus subconsciously perpetuating our own traumata. In Europe, a renewed interest in trauma and its social consequences became manifest in the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the abrupt— and in some places extremely violent—end of totalitarian Communist regimes. Confronting the trauma of the communist past was complicated in many places by the flare-up of dormant historical grudges and unsettled scores: a chaos of violence engulfed the Balkans in the early 1990s (Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, and Albania); ethnic skirmishes erupted in some of the former Soviet republics (Georgia, Moldova, and the Baltic states); and ethnically and culturally diverse regions of the Russian Federation (Chechnya and Ingushetia) made a desperate push for independence. In such conditions, recognition of one’s victimhood becomes more than a personal matter: it acquires a pregnant social and political importance as well.11 One must fight not only an ideologically motivated institutional inertia but also, and more importantly, rekindled historical conflicts that seem to take precedence over any attempt at reconciliation and moving on. The distinction, of course, is purely theoretical; in reality, old historical power vectors are deliberately manipulated and turned into political strategies serving present interests. “What is occurring in all these [former communist] societies is an attempt to come to terms with a traumatic past that is collective in its impact and scale, the result of major historical forces and conflicts that have produced ruptures between the society’s past and its present. Often, this process of coming-to-terms has to confront institutional amnesia and official denial by the state itself, as forms of social and ideological control” (Leydesdorff et al. 11). Death anxiety induced by collective trauma may yet prove to be the most efficient political weapon of the modern era. Unfortunately, the way certain governments handle it rarely leads to its appeasement or healing: using the most advanced\n\nLiving with Trauma\n\n39\n\ntechnologies of destruction in order to physically annihilate the other will only further inflict trauma on the survivors and witnesses on both sides of the front (metaphorically speaking, because in modern warfare there are no clear lines of demarcation between warriors anymore), and our cultural integrity–both “ours” and “theirs”—will be gradually eroded to its prehistorical condition where the stone, the stick, and the arrow were our only guarantees for survival. Living with trauma becomes possible by bearing witness to it, by testifying to the atrocities that caused suffering and/or death, or brought victims so close to them that their imprint changed their lives forever. Telling the story may not bring, ultimately, any kind of closure but integrate, rather, that which had resisted telling into the victims’ lives and into their community’s collective memory. Secondary witnesses must take survivors for who they are now, not look in them for who they used to be: then, and only then, can healing start. “Is it really possible to come to terms with catastrophic evil?” ponders Kirby Farrell. “We live by indirection, always compensating for what we finally cannot bear. Every culture invests in symbolic immortality. Immersed in the rules and rituals of cultural perpetuity, we compulsively tell stories that flatter our imaginative control” (Farrell 236). The compulsiveness of the traumatic imagination resides, evidently, in its traumatic origin: no matter how late, the story, or a story, must be told and, most importantly, make itself heard. In the case of limit events, most narrative memories would be precluded were it not for the traumatic imagination, simply because they would not be able to access the “facts” necessary to build narratives; the traumatic imagination is the psychological function of the creative mind capable, indeed, of converting unrepresentable events into accessible fictional image. Griselda Pollock defines the passage from trauma “as the move into the narrativity that institutes time, the pause in which memory forms, hence spatializes” or as “a passage into the temporality of narrative that encases but also mutes trauma’s perpetually haunting force by means of a structuration that is delivered by representation” (Pollock 40, my emphases). The time-space structure thus created by a narrative, or\n\n40\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\nrecovered through symbolic mediation from a yet unnamed (chaotic) referent, will become an artistic chronotope. * The relation between an unstable time-space, which I call “shock chronotope,” and its corresponding artistic, literary chronotope, as described by Mikhail Bakhtin, lies at the very core of the magical realist writing mode. Bakhtin’s definition of the artistic chronotope as “the intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature” (Bakhtin 84) suggests the notion of “represented history” or “history in representation”: codes, signs, and rules that have turned bare events into a narrative. Representation becomes problematic when this very rendering of time “artistically visible” is faced with seemingly insurmountable hurdles like forgetting or, worse still, the impossibility of telling. When the violence of an event prevented its being grasped, rationalized, and stored in the subject’s consciousness at the moment of its occurrence, the time-space, or the shock chronotope, is so shaky that even making it artistically visible, that is, turning it into an artistic chronotope, requires an act of imagination, which I have qualified as traumatic. This type of artistic representation, which quite frequently makes use of magical realist imagery, should not be regarded as a denial of historical “fact” or as its distortion for the purpose of rendering it more palatable cognitively or emotionally, but rather, as an aesthetically and ethically adequate means of coping with a painful memory by telling—by bearing witness to it. In such a (con)text, the “represented” truth will not be of what happened but, rather, of what was only partially experienced as happening. Latency characterizes not only trauma but also the very structure of the experience itself. It then follows that the temporal element of any trauma narrative will need some kind of restoration, a reintegration in the artistic time-space continuum in order to be experienced, often for the first time, as a factual (be it still impossible) occurrence. Bakhtin also remarked that, “In the literary artistic chronotope, spatial and temporal indicators are fused into one carefully thought-out, concrete whole.\n\nLiving with Trauma\n\n41\n\nTime, as it were, thickens, takes on flesh, and becomes artistically visible; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time, plot and history” (Bakhtin 84). The concept of the chronotope, therefore, becomes crucial for a multi-angled understanding of the events narrated by both traumatized and non-traumatized authors.12 For Bakhtin, the chronotope is not only the “organizing center” for the narrative events of the novel, but also, and more importantly perhaps, the main locus of meaning (Bakhtin 250). The representational power of the chronotope provides concreteness to narrative events and restores time to its perceivable, experience-able condition.13 However, not only content is chronotopic: so is every literary image. The chronotopic character of every individual image accounts for the sometimes seemingly incidental presence of magical realist imagery in works usually not associated with this mode of writing. If every image has a chronotopic core—as do language and every word14—it follows that shock chronotopes, and implicitly their magical realist representations, may appear in a text even without defining its larger themes (slavery, postcolonialism, war, Holocaust literature, etc.) or style (memoirist, documentary, allegorical, fantastic, realist, magical realist, etc.). Given the chronotopic nature of narrative itself, any exploration of shock chronotopes will most likely lead to analyses of memory as a series of narrative acts, rather than to formalist distinctions between realism and fantasy.15 The relationship that Bakhtin establishes between actual chronotopes (as sources of representation) and the “reflected chronotopes of the world” (Bakhtin 253) is one of symbolic mediation16—the transfer between reality and the symbolic being effected by means of language. The linguistic medium, in a Bakhtinian sense, is not to be understood as a unified national language but, rather, as a speaker’s consciousness embodying certain experiences, idiosyncrasies of language, an individual worldview, as well as the codes of an entire cultural system. The artistic image of a language viewed in this manner will always be the product of a twofold consciousness: “The artistic image of a language must by its very nature be a linguistic hybrid (an intentional hybrid),” states Bakhtin. “It is obligatory for two linguistic consciousnesses to be\n\n42\n\nTHE TRAUMATIC IMAGINATION\n\npresent, the one being represented and the other doing the representing, with each belonging to a differen"
