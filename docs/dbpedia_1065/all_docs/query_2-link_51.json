        "text": "Allen, Glen Scott. Rev. of Maupassant and the American Short Story: The Influence of Form at the Turn of the Century. By Richard Fusco (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1994). Studies in Short Fiction 33.2 (Spring 1996): 307 (3pp). Rpt. EbscoHost Academic Search Elite, Article No. 758332. [Full Text available.]\n\nFrom the review: \"In this well-researched and at moments insightful book, Richard Fusco argues that Maupassant's bad rap as first and foremost the inventor and disseminator of the \"trick ending\" is undeserved. What Fusco feels Maupassant does deserve is recognition as perhaps the single most important influence on American short story writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, particularly Ambrose Bierce, Kate Chopin, Henry James, and of course O. Henry.\" Fusco differentiates among types of trick endings and \"develops his own seven categories of stories--from the simplest (linear) to most complex (sinusoidal)--based on their varying 'placement and number of discovery points for the reader.' The first two chapters, in which Fusco limits himself to a thorough and interesting analysis of narrative structure in Maupassant, are the best of the book.\"\n\nClark, Miriam Marty. \"After Epiphany: American Stories in the Postmodern Age.\" Style 27.3 (Fall 1993): 387(8pp.). Infotrac Expanded Academic ASAP Article A15473873.\n\nClark posits that \"contemporary short stories do not inevitably advance toward and can no longer be read in terms of epiphany\"--\"that point of contact with meaning and wholeness which has stood so long at the center of our understanding of the genre\" of the short story. \"Coming to terms with the contemporary American short story and articulating new reading strategies adequate to it\" require \"a redefinition of the short story in its postmodern context.\" Such short stories challenge \"conventional expectations about causality and closure.\" Such \"fragments and wanderings\"--no longer \"oriented to...epiphany\" or the \"moment of truth\"--have \"become something else altogether.\" Many \"little narratives of neorealism\" working their way into the mainstream, even if not marked as \"experimental\" metafictions like the work of Barthelme and Coover, explore \"the problematics of selfhood and meaning\" determined by and isolated in language itself. [Clark marks Carver's \"Cathedral\" as one of the exceptions, moving \"by way of talk toward revelation.\"] These \"neorealist\" stories revive \"storytelling knowledge\" and \"small narrative units,\" and speak \"the language of the labyrinth,\" \"the small, the heterogenous, the plural\"--not \"the language of epiphany,\" \"universal truths and eternal verities.\"\n\nConrad, Barnaby. \"Endings.\" The Writer 108.3 (March 1995): 5(4pp).\n\nInfotrac Expanded Academic ASAP Article A15473855.\n\n\"Brief Summary: The ending of a fiction story should maintain a consistency with the story, should fulfill the expectations of the reader [raised by the short story], and should be the 'right' ending for that particular story. Various elements of story endings, along with several examples [drawn from O. Henry, Jack London, Ernest Hemingway, Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, Ambrose Bierce, Shirley Jackson, William Faulkner, Frank Stockton, Flannery O'Connor, F. Scott Fitzgerald], are discussed.\" Cora's additional abstract: Barnaby maintains, \"Most good stories end the way they must end.\" \"Satisfying\" endings--whether happy or unhappy, completely surprising or fairly predictable, clearly stated by the author or ambiguous and left for the reader \"to make up\"--should \"justify what has gone on before, and usually they stem from the character and actions of the protagonists\" or sometimes the antagonists.\n\nHardy, Sarah. \"A Poetics of Immediacy: Oral Narrative and the Short Story.\"\n\nStyle 27.3 (Fall 1993): 352(16pp). Infotrac Expanded Academic ASAP Article A15473855.\n\n\"The field of orality-literacy studies has helped broaden understanding in many disciplines, but it has not been introduced into discussions of the short story with any rigor.\" This oversight Hardy will address, while rejecting the common approach to the short story as \"a kind of truncated novel.\" Instead, Hardy examines \"an alternative model\": the oral epic. Despite their many differences, short story and oral epic share \"density of meaning\" and create similar complex dynamics with their audiences.\n\nMay, Charles E. \"Reality in the Modern Short Story.\" Style 27.3 (Fall 1993): 369(11pp).\n\nInfotrac Expanded Academic ASAP Article A15473861.\n\n\"In the history of the development of short fiction, three major stylistic shifts have had far reaching generic effects: the humanizing of the allegorical romance in the Renaissance,...the psychologizing of the supernatural legend by the romantics in the early nineteenth century, best represented by the tales of Poe; and the lyricizing of the slice-of-life story by the realists in the early twentieth century, most clearly exemplified in the stories of Chekhov.\" May \"explore[s] some generic innovations of the twentieth-century short story instituted by Chekhov, particularly what is meant by 'realism' in that form.\" May focuses on Chekhov, Hemingway and Carver as \"self-conscious practitioners\" of \"a literary technique that insists on compression, a rhetorical method that reveals meaning by leaving things out, and a language style that creates metaphor by means of metonymy. Moreover, all three authors attempt to express inner reality by describing outer reality and frequently thematize the human dilemma of trying to say the unsayable.\"\n\nPasco, Allan H. \"The Short Story: The Short of It.\" Style 27.3 (Fall 1993): 442(10pp). Infotrac Expanded Academic ASAP Article A15473895.\n\n\"Generic definitions based on devices, techniques, subject matter...have limited life and usefulness.\" Examining one of the short story's \"essential, core characteristics\"--that it \"must be short\"--Pasco sets out to answer the question, \"'What happens because short stories are short?'\" He examines the qualities of the genre in consequence of \"being short\"--\"perhaps the most significant factor in the choices short-story authors make about how their creations are constructed.\" \"One of literature's glories is in its authors' apparently unending ability to devise new ways of presenting their reality.\" But for practitioners of the short story, the genre's \"brevity\" is a \"central quality,\" resulting in \"a noticeable intensity.\"\n\nPassaro, Vince. Rev. of The Things They Carried, by Tim O'Brien (Houghton Mifflin, 1990; Viking-Penguin, 1991). Harper's Magazine August 1999: 80(9pp).\n\nInfotrac Expanded Academic ASAP Article A55266681.\n\nThe title is a misnomer: this article is less a review focused on O'Brien's collection than a more general critical appreciation of the \"innovative and rich\" short fictions emerging in the 1990s--set against a critical historical survey of the American short story, its major practitioners, periods, and ups and downs in the U.S. periodical and book market. The American short story today is judged \"more various, more successfully experimental, more urbane, funnier, and more bitingly ironic than that written in the Hemingway tradition....more idiosyncratic in its voices, less commercial, and more expansive in its approach to the requirements of art.\" Passaro does call O'Brien's collection \"complex and beautiful Vietnam soldiers' tales,\" playing with \"the embattled terrain of a soldier's memory, with his embellishments of memories in conscious reconstructions--stories told, then corrected--to startling and intriguing effects in narrative and language.\"\n\nPrince, Gerald. \"The Long and the Short of It.\" Style 27.3 (Fall 1993): 325(5pp). Infotrac Expanded Academic ASAP Article A15473845.\n\nPrince presents seven generic features which comprise a \"relatively standard definition\" of the short story, \"allow[ing] us to distinguish the short-story genre from a multiplicity of other (more-or-less related) genres\": \"a text must be short,\" it must satisfy \"the requirements of narrativehood\" and \"storyhood,\" \"[a]t least some\" of its \"situations and events must be fictional,\" \"it must be written in prose,\" \"[i]t must be 'literary,'\" and it must be \"autonomous.\" The bulk of the article is devoted to observations about the nature and functions of genre definitions.\n\nAldridge, John. \"The New American Assembly-Line Fiction.\" American Scholar 59 (1990): 17-38.\n\nArgulo, Maria-Elena.
