Simon Clark (born 20 April 1958) is a horror novelist from Doncaster, England. He is the author of the novel The Night of the Triffids, the novella Humpty's Bones, and the short story Goblin City Lights, which have all won awards.

Most of his stories are based in Yorkshire, his home county. He also uses a technique that he calls "The Art of Wandering". The idea for Goblin City Lights arose from wandering in a London graveyard. His other novels include Blood Crazy, recently extrapolated into a series, On Deadly Ground (Formerly King Blood), the Vampyrrhic series, Cold Legion and Sherlock Holmes: Lord Of Damnation.
