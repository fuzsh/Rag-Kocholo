NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Jul 1, 2014) - British writer Simon Clark's The Night of the Triffids, sequel to John Wyndham's 1951 cult classic The Day of the Triffids, makes its digital debut in eBook, published by RosettaBooks. Clark has been praised for paying homage to the original by following in Wyndham's footsteps and adapting Wyndham's writing style in the sequel.

"I searched for a sequel; alas there was none," said Clark of being a fan of Wyndam's Day of the Triffids. "I became a novelist many years later and one day realized I could write my own sequel, and continue to explore Wyndham's idea of a small number of survivors struggling to live in a hostile world." (On the RosettaBooks Blog: Clark talks more about the Triffids sequel, his characters and what he's working on next.)

The Night of the Triffids takes place 25 years after Bill Masen, the hero of The Day of the Triffids, escapes to a colony on the Isle of Wight. His son, David, discovers a group of people who appear to be immune to the Triffids' deadly poison. But all is not as it seems, and soon he must face a deadly adversary from his family's past.

On June 19, 2014, Big Finish Productions announced an audio drama adaptation of The Night of the Triffids to be released in September 2014. The Day of the Triffids was made into a 1963 movie starring Howard Keel and Nicole Maurey. It was also made into a TV mini-series in 2009 starring Dougray Scott and Joely Richardson.

Clark is the author of numerous acclaimed novels and short stories. Some of his best-known works include Nailed By the Heart, Darker, The Fall, Blood Crazy, and Vampyrrhic. He has won several awards, including the British Fantasy Award for The Night of the Triffids. He is also the author of The Dalek Factor, an original Doctor Who novella.
