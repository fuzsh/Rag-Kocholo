        "text": "The author, who died last week, wrote books that linked a familiar past with an unrecognizable future.\n\nThe author John Christopher died in England last Friday, and I'm guessing that most of you have no idea who he was or what he wrote. He wrote an awful lot, in a lot of different genres, under many different names, but I remember him today because of three creased and crinkled used paperbacks of science fiction I stumbled across as a child at the \"for sale\" carousel at the Reginald P. Dawson Library in Town of Mount Royal, Quebec. I still have the books--35 years later--and have dutifully tried to get my son to read them. Maybe I'll try again now.\n\nThe books are The White Mountains, The City of Gold and Lead, and The Pool of Fire and together they comprise what is called the \"Tripod Series,\" named for the shape of the giant aliens who have captured Earth and enslaved the humans at the core of Christopher's narratives. I don't remember much of the details of the books except that a group of young boys were always on the run, part of a resistance to the alien conquerors, in a sort of 1984 meets Red Dawn meets the French Resistance fondue.\n\nHere is how The Guardian led its obituary of Christopher:\n\nOn the back cover of my copy of The White Mountains, there is this blurb from some long-ago review by the Chicago Tribune:\n\nWell, I wouldn't go that far. John Christopher was no Mark Twain. And he was no George Orwell, either, although (as with Orwell and H.G. Wells) there is something overwhelmingly British--stiff upper lip and all--about the heroes/victims of Christopher's stories. In fact, in the very first paragraph of the very first book, the main character, \"Will,\" describes a scene that makes me think today of those endless English-themed movies, the period pieces, where you feel like Anthony Hopkins at any moment is going to jump out of a cloakroom at you:\n\nEven the last line of the series is notably British: \"'Yes,' I said, 'I'll leave my seas and island.'\" In the Commonwealth's Canada, a lifetime ago, I liked the books because they linked a familiar past--the traveling salesman, etc.--with an unrecognizable future. I don't know why so many other people liked the Tripod series, too, but there was a television series about it and, for a while, it was evidently serialized here in the United States in Boys Life. I wonder how many of those Boy Scouts who read the series would remember Christoper today?\n\nMy version of The White Mountains, written in 1967, was already on its fourth paperback printing by 1974. The last in the series, The Pool of Fire, written in 1968, was already in its third paperback printing in 1973. Christopher's New York Times obituary explains why he wrote so much and so quickly on so many topics:\n\nThe financial demands of a growing family set the blistering pace of his output of books and short stories in the early years, he said. He wrote most of his stories in a single draft, until Susan Hirschmann, an editor at his New York publishing house, Macmillan, cajoled him into rewriting and polishing the young-adult novels that later became the \"Tripods\" series. He frequently acknowledged her contributions to his books' success.\n\n\"The original version of 'The White Mountains' was probably just about worth publishing,\" he wrote in the preface to a 2003 anniversary edition of the first book in the trilogy, which first appeared in 1967. \"But would it, without Susan, have remained in print and worthy of a commemorative relaunch, three and a half decades after its original publication? I've no doubt about the answer to that.\"\n\nAcross the pond, the obituaries were, predictably, both gentler and more insightful. From The Guardian's \"Books Blog:\"\n\nWealth, schmealth. If you have a kid between the ages of 10 and 14, who likes science fiction, take a shot at having them read these books. John Christopher, who also wrote under the names Stanley Winchester, Hilary Ford, William Godfrey, William Vine, Peter Graaf, Peter Nichols and Anthony Rye, deserves to have this work absorbed by another generation of young readers. Oh, and because you won't likely hear about him ever again, Christopher's real name, all this time, was Sam Youd."
