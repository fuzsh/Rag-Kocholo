Frightening and powerful, Wyndhamâs vision remains an important allegory and a gripping story.ââThe Guardian\n\nWhat if a meteor shower left most of the world blindâand humanity at the mercy of mysterious carnivorous plants?Â\n\nBill Masen undergoes eye surgery and awakes the next morning in his hospital bed to find civilization collapsing. Wandering the city, he quickly realizes that surviving in this strange new world requires evading strangers and the seven-foot-tall plants known as triffidsâplants that can walk and can kill a man with one quick lash of their poisonous stingers."
