        "text": "When Bill Masen wakes up in his hospital bed, he has reason to be grateful for the bandages that covered his eyes the night before. For he finds a population rendered helpless by the blindness that followed the spectacular display of bright green lights that filled the night sky; a population at the mercy of the Triffids. Once, with their ability to move and their carnivorous habits, the Triffids were just botanical curiosities. But now, with humans so vulnerable, they are a potent threat to humanity’s survival. It is up to people like Bill, the few who can still see, to carve out a future…\n\nThe devastating triffids are the result of human bio-engineering, and Wyndham’s treatment of the crisis makes this cautionary tale timelessly relevant to today’s society.\n\nWhen THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS was published in paperback by Popular Library (New York) in 1952 it was called THE REVOLT OF THE TRIFFIDS.\n\nThe triffids have been the inspiration for many artistic re-interpretations, including a musical soundscape, and a radio drama. If you have an idea for a new adaptation that you’d like to follow up, do get in touch with Paper Lion to discuss your ideas – we’d love to hear from you."
