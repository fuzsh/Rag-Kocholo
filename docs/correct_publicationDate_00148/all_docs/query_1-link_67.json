        "text": "Simon Clark. 2001. Read by Steven Pacey. 10 tapes. 12.5 hrs. Chivers North America. 0-7540-0766-9. $84.95. Vinyl binder; plot, author, reader notes. SA\n\nPilot David Masen has made an unfortunate off-course landing in his plane. After a night's sleep he finds the world in darkness and the town besieged by triffids--man-eating plants that have terrorized the world for 30 years. David is rescued by an American ship and assured that he will be returned home to the Isle of Wight. David falls in love with one of the passengers, Kerris Baedekker, who just happens to be the daughter of a man who is his father's archrival. His joy turns to outrage when he realizes that the rescue party intends to deliver him to the enemy and use him as a decoy to obtain the triffid oil technology his father has developed. Before that can happen, he is snatched by the Forresters, an opposition rebel group.\n\nThe action is fast and furious; and the triffids are larger than life in the city that never sleeps. Steven Pacey's capable, fully voiced, British-accented reading lends credibility to the story whose hero is an Englishman. A sequel to Wyndham's Day of the Triffids (1951), this also stands on its own. For SF fans. Rita M. Fontinha, Lib. Spec., Norwood H.S., Norwood, MA"
