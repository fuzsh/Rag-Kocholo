        "text": "Simon Clark wrote a sequel The Night of the Triffids (2001). This is set 25 years after Wyndham's book, and focuses on the adventures of Bill Masen's son David, who travels to New York, USA. Big Finish Productions adapted it as an audio play in 2014.[42] The dramatisation featuring Sam Troughton was later broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in June 2016.\n\nSimon Gould published The Land of the Triffids in 2016, continuing the story of Christina Schofield, picking up where Simon Clark's The Night of the Triffids left off.[43] However, as of 2023, the book is unavailable for purchase and has not been dramatised in any form.\n\nIn 2020, English science fiction and fantasy author John Whitbourn published a sequel, entitled The Age of the Triffids. Set in the Isle of Wight \"Colony\" in the lead-up to the Millennium, it details the rallying of survivors from across Britain for one last attempt to defeat the triffid threat. For copyright reasons, the book is not for sale outside Canada and New Zealand.[44]"
