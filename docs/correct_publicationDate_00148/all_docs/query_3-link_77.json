        "text": "I like sci-fi: the stranger the better. So, when I heard about ‘the day of the Triffids’, where a mysterious green comet makes everybody who looked at it blind and plants start walking and eating humans on the same day, I was immediately interested. Being well aware that makes the book sound ridiculous I will tell you there’s more to the story. Although there is nothing wrong with reading a strange book from time to time.\n\nThis is a dystopian novel first published in 1951. Like many other science-fiction novels from that time, the Cold War plays a big role in it. There is the threat of war, suspicion of foreign powers and also the fear of warfare with new technologies. This cold war paranoia is combined with other worries of food shortages and the good and bad of messing around with plants to create new sources of food. The last point is where the green plants called Triffids come in. They are bred by the USSR as a cheap alternative for natural oil, much in the same way palm oil is grown now in large quantities to replace traditional oil sources. Triffids are some kind of creepy plant that can walk and have a sting which kills people. Strangely, after some mistrust, the presence of this plant in almost every park, garden and farm, does not worry the people in the book. Everybody assumes they are easy to control and can’t be that dangerous, them being plants. So, they are bred by the millions all over the world. In my opinion, you should worry when killing and walking plants are grown, but who am I to question the decisions of global powers in a book.\n\nThe book starts the morning after the mysterious green comet has passed the earth. Everyone who could find a way watched it and it turns out that everybody who did so is now blind. So, at the start of the book, we are introduced to a world facing apocalypse in two ways: plants that walk and kill and an almost entirely blind population. This makes this book a combination of a cool adventure story of how people survive after a disaster and an exploration of the different ways how people react to disaster.\n\nThe protagonist and narrator of the book is Bill Masen. Bill is a Triffid scientist and was recovering from a Triffid sting attack to his eye the day of the comet. Therefore, he still has his sight, because his eyes were wrapped up in bandages when the comet passed. Bill is a solitary man, used to go about his own life. This serves him well when he travels through the collapsing society to find out what happened and to plan a way to survive in the years to come. Pretty soon he meets Josella Playton, our second protagonist. She has also kept her sight because she was recovering from a party the night of the comet and therefore was asleep when the comet passed. She wrote a book infamous because it mentioned ‘sex’ in the title and is quite happy she can escape her reputation in the new life she plans to live with Bill. Of course, she also struggles to adapt to society in ruin, but she seems to take it all more or less in her stride and has most of the practical good ideas. Bill is the practical side of the couple and Jocella the thinking side. Of course, the two fall madly in love.\n\nThe last character I want to introduce to you was my favourite: Wilfred Coker. He is a self-made man and quick to adapt to any situation necessary to survive without becoming cruel. He has also kept his sight. He only loses his patience when nobody sees reason in his urge to build a sustainable future or to save the blind people. Nobody knows where he comes from because sometimes he has a posh accent, and sometimes a Cockney accent. First Bill and Coker are enemies, but soon Bill sees Coker’s survival skills and they become companions.\n\nIn the way this book is written there is a certain distance between characters and events or emotions. Things are not happening to them as you read it, but the reader is told what happens and felt by the characters. In this way, you don’t experience what happens to the characters with them, but the book tells you what happens to them with some distance. This is often how older books are written and can make them feel a bit dull and devoid of reality because it is more difficult to connect with the characters. However, that does not mean a book should be dismissed. That style can also give a book a level of rationality which is often missing in books focused on the emotions of the characters. This rationality gives the writer the opportunity to explore the multiple reasons people have for actions and how many different paths there are to follow post-apocalypse. In this book, for example, there are desperate people who kill themselves, people who help others, a militant group trying to re-take control, religious groups and groups like Bill’s and Jocella’s who create a new family after having lost their old ones. Extreme things happen to the people in this new world, but the author doesn’t give them much opportunity for an emotional breakdown. Even the characters realize at a certain moment it won’t do them much good, so they make the conscious effort to be as little affected as possible by everything that happens around them. Diminishing the drama gives room to explore all the possibilities within the story and to tell the story. Cutting out some of the emotions paradoxically creates space for a multitude of emotions to explore for the reader. I like this style of down-tuned emotions. It’s not like we as readers can’t imagine for ourselves how emotionally distressed the characters are if we wanted to.\n\nAnother thing I liked about this book is the time span. The first part of the book is about the first weeks after the comet has made everybody blind. This is a time of chaos where everybody tries to find out what has happened and tries to find a way to survive. Also, there is a lot of action and the characters meet. The second part of the book has a much slower pace. Many years pass between chapters because not much happens. Everybody potters along with their scavenging and efforts to try to understand farming and the threat of the Triffids seems under control. At the end, the threat of the Triffids surfaces again, but there is also some hope in the ending. There is some hope to exterminate the Triffid threat when science prevails, science that got them into this mess in the first place, but who am I to judge. In this way, the book explores the different stages of post-apocalyptic survival. I’ve always found the term post-apocalyptic strange because I thought it to mean post-end of the world books, and there is no after when the world has ended. But Thura explained to me that apocalypse actually means ‘revelation’ or ‘prophecy’ looking at the Greek origin of the word. This makes much more sense because post-apocalyptic books tell us about what might happen to the future of humanity when potential disasters happen and therefore are a warning. In this book, the warning is what might happen when we lose control of our scientific endeavours.\n\nThe strength of the book is not in the adventure part because the threat of the Triffids actually only plays a small role in the story. They are introduced as a threat at the beginning of the book, but they also disappear for a long time when Bill has worked out a routine to deal with them. At the end of the book, they turn up again as the biggest threat to hold back humanity to survive through the blindness disaster. It is hard to survive blind in a world where you constantly have to look out for enemies. So, this book is more about re-starting a society after collapse than about the threat of the plants. Maybe the Triffids are one big metaphor to teach us humans to not mess with things we cannot see the result of: the Triffids were designed by humans after all. Maybe John Wyndham saw that we humans accept potential dangerous situations all too easily when it is for profit or comfort and wanted to warn us. If that is the case, I suggest everybody read this book soon before genetic manipulation or artificial intelligence manages to mess up the world as we know it. But maybe I read too much into this book. Maybe this is only a book about overbred walking plants who sting people and eat them. Which certainly will give you something to think about next time you walk in your garden if you decide not to take the other warning.\n\nHerbicide award for teaching us many ways to kill green things that were supposed to feed us and not to grow things that can stand up, walk and kill\n\nJohn Wyndham, the day of the Triffids (London, 1951)\n\nBella G.
