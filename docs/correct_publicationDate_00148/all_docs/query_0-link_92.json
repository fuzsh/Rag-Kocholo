Whatever their origin, the plants are also discovered to produce a high-quality vegetable oil, and so an entire industry grows up around farming them. Mason works as a researcher on a Triffid farm, and ends up in the hospital after a Triffid stings him on the face. His eyes thus bandaged, he misses a bizarre meteor shower that lights up the night skies all over the world. Come morning, Mason learns that the shower has struck blind everyone who viewed it. (He later speculates that the shower was actually a malfunctioning orbital weapons system, but again no proof is to be found one way or the other.) Wandering through a disintegrating London, he meets and quickly falls in love with a sighted novelist named Josella Playton (who missed seeing the \"meteor shower\" because she was sleeping off an unfortunate party experience.) While the Triffids rapidly break free of their farms and begin wiping out the blinded population, Mason and Playton become entangled in the squabbles of other sighted survivors leading to their unwilling separation. They are finally reunited at a small estate in the English countryside, taking up farming in an fenced enclave surrounded by hordes of Triffids. When a despotic new government appears on the scene, they join a colony of more freedom-minded individuals on the Isle of Wight, researching for the day they can defeat the Triffids and reclaim the Earth for humanity.\n\nIn 2001, the author Simon Clark wrote a sequel to the book entitled Night of the Triffids, which attempted to be a pastiche of Wyndham's style, and details the adventures of Bill and Josella's son.\n\nThe novel has been adapted for film three times, the first being a loosely-adapted 1962 feature film, the second a 1981 BBC miniseries which, while low-budget, is quite faithful to the original work, and then once more by the BBC in 2009; again the plot deviated a great deal from the original.\n\nTropes used in The Day of the Triffids include:\n\nAmerica Saves the Day: Coldly subverted in the original.\n\nApocalypse How: Killer plants and blinding \"meteors\". Performs a relatively mild Class 1.\n\nAttack of the Killer Whatever\n\nBaby Factory: one of the most horrifying aspects of the plot's entire setup is that they cannot possibly help the vast majority of the population, who have been blinded. Eventually even the \"Good\" faction of people led by Beadley grudgingly concludes that all of the blinded men are a drain on resources and thus a complete write-off. Conversely, Beadley's openly stated position - grudgingly accepted even by the protagonist - is that blind women of childbearing age will be kept alive and in polygamous relationships with the remaining sighted men, to try to repopulate as quickly as possible.\n\nBoth Sides Have a Point: Bill Mason is initially somewhat shocked at the pragmatic abandonment of most of the blind population in London by Beadley and the Institute group and sympathizes with Coker's more idealistic attempt to help them. Ultimately, he comes around to the Beadley position when Reality Ensues.\n\nChekhov's Gunman: the Evil Redhead who shoots at Bill's blind group later appears as a member of a new despotic government.\n\nCosy Catastrophe: As noted, perhaps the most famous example.\n\nDepopulation Bomb\n\nEvil Redhead: Torrence is first seen casually firing on Bill's blind group so they won't compete for resources. When we next see him he's posing as a member of a restored government (actually a feudal military dictatorship).\n\nGone Horribly Wrong\n\nIn Medias Res\n\nIt Can Think: The exact level of intelligence of the genetically-engineered triffids is a subject for debate, with the protagonist rubbishing the idea that they're intelligent —- after all, dissections haven't found anything remotely like a brain. Others are not so sure. One man points out that the triffids escaped from their farms within hours of everyone going blind. In another scene a triffid is waiting outside the very door which a person would run out of if they heard someone driving down the road. Much like the Velociraptors in Jurassic Park, they're also smart enough to avoid an electrified fence...and to force it down when the electrical power is off. They even have a crude form of communication by drumming their branches against their trunk, though whether this is a crude but effective \"hunting call\", or an actual complex \"language\" is unknown. Overall, they seem to have at least the same basic intelligence level as a pack of dogs.\n\nJust Think of the Potential: Used both positively and negatively; the money to be made from the Triffids' oil, while pre-disaster one of Mason's colleagues speculates about Triffids' advantages over a blinded human.\n\nKill It with Fire: Flamethrowers prove to be the most effective anti-Triffid weapon, although a lack of fuel is a major problem.\n\nThe Last Man Heard a Knock\n\nMan-Eating Plant: At least, after we've.. ripened.. a bit.\n\nNever Live It Down: Josella and her \"scandalous\" novel Sex Is My Adventure.\n\nReality Ensues: One of the greatest and earliest examples of this trope in apocalyptic literature. The author takes the general \"survive the Zombie Apocalypse\" horror story (using plants instead of zombies or nuclear war), and extends it forward for several years. Quite simply...scavenging for canned food in the ruins of major cities is *not* a viable survival strategy on a long time scale. Crowds of blind people scavenge in the early days, but there's a finite supply of canned food and they run out eventually. *Nor* do the more lucky survivors simply flee to a pastoral existence raising their own crops in the countryside. The author repeatedly underlines the point that even those who survived long enough to plow their own fields, need to learn how to forge their own iron to make their own plows. If they're just scavenging old plows, they're not much better than the blind people scrabbling for cans in ruined shops. The entire set of interconnected relationships that are required for civilization are needed for long-term survival.\n\nSlept Through the Apocalypse\n\nWhen Trees Attack: And how.\n\nZombie Apocalypse: Triffids aren't undead humanoids, but in terms of behavior and threat level they share more than a passing resemblance.\n\nZombie Gait: The blind, who are shuffling around mindlessly pawing at things and wailing -- they were sighted a few hours ago and with no experience in living without it or anyone to help, they're stumbling around in the dark. Possibly leads to Unfortunate Implications if it looks as if only sighted people can possibly think of ideas about working together. Subverted towards the end of the book by the original inhabitants of the farmhouse.\n\nExamples specific to Simon Clark's sequel:[]\n\nAmerica Saves the Day: The sequel completely subverts this.\n\nChekhov's Gunman: The leader of the New York community in the sequel is mentioned about still having some red hair amongst the white hair, and a blind eye from being hit there by a triffid. He is Torrence, who managed to survive the triffids' attack at the end of the first book.\n\nExamples specific to the 1962 film version:[]\n\nAmerica Saves the Day: Embraced in the movie version.\n\nKill It with Water: Bizarrely used as the monster-killer in the first movie adaptation.\n\nMoral Dissonance: Mason returns to the chateau the find sighted convicts holding the blind women at gunpoint and sexually assaulting them. He gets Christine Durrant and Susan into the truck and drives away, making no attempt to save the helpless women. Even Durrant - who earlier had vowed not to abandon the others - never mentions the chateau incident again.\n\nPlant Aliens: As noted, the original didn't establish where they came from (casually speculating on aliens and Soviet Superscience); the movie version explicitly made them into aliens.\n\nPromoted to Love Interest: After Josella was removed from the 1962 movie version for God knows what reason they decided to replace her role in the story with Durrant of all people!\n\nRevised Ending: See Kill It with Water above.\n\nScreaming Woman: Janette Scott in the movie. And despite that famous line from \"Science Fiction / Double Feature\" in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, she doesn't actually do any fighting.\n\nTouch of the Monster: The movie version's advertising poster.\n\nWeaksauce Weakness: Again, the water thing (in the movie).\n\nExamples specific to the 2009 remake:[]"
