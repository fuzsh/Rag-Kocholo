        "text": "A TV series adaptation of John Wyndham’s sci-fi classic The Day Of the Triffids has been put into fast-track development by Amazon Studios. According to sources, Johan Renick, Emmy winner for HBO’s Chernobyl, is attached to direct and executive produce. Don Murphy and Susan Montford executive produce for Angry Films.\n\nWith its post-apocalyptic setting and plot, Wyndham’s 1951 novel draws parallels to HBO’s breakout hit The Last Of Us. In The Day Of the Triffids, after most people in the world are blinded by a meteor shower, triffids — tall venomous, carnivorous plants — start killing the rest. The story centers on Bill Masen, a biologist who specializes in triffids. He leads survivors in their fight against the killer plants and at some point rescues a young sighted girl and travels with her for several days.\n\nThe English book has had three UK radio adaptations and a 1962 feature starring Howard Keel. There also have been two BBC limited series, most recently the 2009 The Day Of the Triffids featuring an all-star cast that included Dougray Scott as Bill Masen, Joely Richardson, Brian Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Eddie Izzard and Jason Priestley. The book also influenced the British post-apocalyptic horror movie 28 Days Later.\n\nMurphy’s association with the property dates back to 2010 when he was attached to a proposed 3D The Day Of the Triffids feature adaptation. Angry Films’ (and predecessor Montford Murphy Productions) feature credits include Real Steel and the Transformers franchise."
