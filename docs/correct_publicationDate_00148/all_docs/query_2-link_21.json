        "text": "A droll little horror masterpiece, a rollicking good read and more than a little creepy and prophetic\n\nThe Day of the Triffids, written in 1951 by John Wyndham, is a cracking good read that seems 70 years ahead of it’s time. The story combines some very timely and prescient threads — environmental degradation, genetic mutation, a pandemic, a possible alien attack and even a social influencer — into a thrilling romp through post-apocalyptic England in search of love, alcohol and weapons.\n\nThe setup, presaging 28 Days Later, involves protagonist Bill Masen who wakes up in a hospital alone. It’s one of the most compelling opening lines I’ve encountered: “When a day that you happen to know is Wednesday starts off by sounding like a Sunday, there is something seriously wrong somewhere.”\n\nBill suffered temporary damage to his eyes and was swaddled in bandages waiting for the big reveal, scheduled that morning. But none of the nurses or doctors come to his aid and, aside from some occasional screaming, the hospital seemed deserted. Eventually, he peels the bandages off and heads outside to find a ruined London. Turns out the long-anticipated meteor shower the night before blinded everyone who saw it, which was basically everyone, and things are going poorly. That’s a novel in itself, but that’s only half the story.\n\nSociety had become gradually dependent upon triffids, large, ambulatory, carnivorous plants with poisonous stings (that’s how he was temporarily blinded). Think very large, very mobile Venus flytraps crossed with scorpions. They were likely engineered in a lab and escaped, but it turned out they produced a valuable oil, so everyone was willing to deal with the minor inconvenience of their violent streak because they were slow and easy to contain — as long as you were sighted, or course.\n\nOvernight, almost everyone in the world found themselves blind and at the mercy of the ambling creatures.\n\nBill is mostly nonplussed by the situation, bringing his wry, droll humor, his classic British stiff upper lip and his love of drink to bear on the situation.\n\n“But one thing I was perfectly certain about. Reality or nightmare, I needed a drink as I had seldom needed one before.” And he wasn’t talking about tea, which as an aside, was oddly missing from this story.\n\nAs Bill wanders through the deserted streets — past the needy-blind, hungry triffids and scores of decaying bodies — he makes his way from bar to bar and tries to figure out what to do. Everything changes when he meets the beautiful Josella Playton — also sighted — who is the author of a famous and provocative book, Sex Is My Adventure. Post-apocalyptic sparks fly but their happy ever after plans are beset by roving knots of triffids, along with gangs of blind people who force any sighted person they can catch to serve them and some cruel competition among the emerging factions of functional human “tribes.”\n\nThink Lord of the Flies meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers, with a little Mad Max thrown in for fun. All with an indefatigable chipper attitude that puts a patina of bluster over the end of the world.\n\nAs Josella put it, “You know, one of the most shocking things about it is to realize how easily we have lost a world that seemed so safe and certain.”\n\nIn our present world, with a pandemic still underfoot, rampant greed and violence plaguing our societies, and the gradual collapse of the environment, I only hope I can meet the apocalypse with the appropriate level of cheery bravado. I’m stocking up on brandy just to be safe.\n\nAs Bill would say, “New plan, open to revision.”\n\nIt’s a rollicking good read and more than a little creepy and prophetic."
