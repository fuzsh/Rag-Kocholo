        "text": "Description\n\nWhen Bill Masen wakes up blindfolded in hospital there is a bitter irony in his situation. Carefully removing his bandages, he realizes that he is the only person who can see: everyone else, doctors and patients alike, have been blinded by a meteor shower. Now, with civilization in chaos, the triffids – huge, venomous, large-rooted plants able to ‘walk’, feeding on human flesh – can have their day.\n\nThe Day of the Triffids, published in 1951, expresses many of the political concerns of its time: the Cold War, the fear of biological experimentation and the man-made apocalypse. However, with its terrifyingly believable insights into the genetic modification of plants, the book is more relevant today than ever before.\n\nYou may also like…\n\nThe Odyssey\n\n£8.99 Original price was: £8.99.£6.29Current price is: £6.29. 30% off\n\nThe Odyssey quantity\n\nMedusa – Retelling **Shortlisted For The YOTO Carnegie Award**\n\n£9.99 Original price was: £9.99.£6.99Current price is: £6.99. 30% off\n\nMedusa - Retelling **Shortlisted For The YOTO Carnegie Award** quantity"
