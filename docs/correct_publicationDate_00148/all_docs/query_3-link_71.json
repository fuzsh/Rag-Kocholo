SF Masterworks 2001 Hardback Series (#X):- Synopsis: When Bill Masen wakes up in his hospital bed, he has reason to be grateful for the bandages that covered his eyes the night before. For the spectacular green meteor shower that he couldn't see has left the population blind, helpless and at the mercy of the triffids. These strange ambulatory and carnivorous plants had once been just botanical curiosities as they lumbered about. But now, with humans rendered sightless and vulnerable, the triffids have become ruthless killers, lashing out with their fatal stings, and it is left to those few people who can still see, like Bill, to ensure the survival of mankind. Drawing deep on their inner strengths and on their innate decency, Bill and his few companions confront the problems of a collapsing civilisation and the dangers of the omnipresent triffids with amiable common sense and laudable resourcefulness:- Review(s): \"John Wyndham's classic tale of ecological catastrophe and survival has the same power and resonance today as when it first appeared fifty years ago and immediately established Wyndham as one of the most important postwar British SF writers. Its striking images and lucid prose were highly influential and the book is now justly celebrated as the first, and definitive, great disaster novel\":- (original cost £14.99).\n\nFirst UK edition, first printing.

G. Wells' catastrophe novels, especially with THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, to which it bears some striking resemblances.\" - Magill (ed), Survey of Science Fiction Literature, p. 506. \"This tale of monsters from a botched experiment marching over the world is a superior example of its breed.\" - Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-1296.

The author's best-known work, a catastrophe novel about Londoners stricken with blindness due to a cosmic phenomenon, and wave of large, intelligent, carnivorous plants taking over the city. An attractive copy of a science fiction highspot, making all of the important lists, and basis for several film adaptations.\n\nFirst edition, first impression, of Wyndham's science fiction classic. \"His story of the perambulating vegetable menace which takes over a Britain stricken with blindness was an immediate success. The inferior MGM film version (1963) starred Howard Keel, and a BBC television adaptation appeared in 1981\" (Brian Aldiss in ODNB). The novel sold as well and steadily as a Penguin book. \"As this critic has remarked elsewhere, Wyndham was the master of the 'cosy catastrophe' (Aldiss, 293). Although that vogue has passed, Wyndham's importance in the rebirth of British science fiction after the Second World War was second to none. His very English style ('the Trollope of science fiction', according to one reviewer), coupled with the Wellsian gift for exploring emotive ideas, brought him international success and encouraged others to strike out in the same way\". Locke, A Spectrum of Fantasy, I p. 237. Octavo. Original green cloth, silver lettered spine. With dust jacket. Jacket with some nicks and chips to extremities, some minor tape repair to verso of spine panel. A very good copy in very good jacket.\n\nFirst Edition preceding the British Edition.

One of the great landmarks in science fiction, making all the important lists of the classics of the genre and successfully filmed twice.\n\nFirst edition, first impression, of this science fiction classic. One of the most famous works by the \"master of the cosy catastrophe\", the book revolves around an aggressive species of carnivorous plant, capable of locomotion, that turns against humanity after most of the world's population has been blinded by a meteor shower. In the same year, the story was serialized in five parts in Collier's magazine. The first book published by the author under his name instead of a pseudonym, The Day of the Triffids was an immediate success. It was adapted into a movie starring Howard Keel in 1963 and a BBC television series in 1981. \"Wyndham's importance in the rebirth of British science fiction after the Second World War was second to none. His very English style ('the Trollope of science fiction', according to one reviewer), coupled with the Wellsian gift for exploring emotive ideas, brought him international success and encouraged others to strike out in the same way. Writers as diverse as John Christopher, Charles Eric Maine, J. G. Ballard, and Christopher Priest are in his debt. Indeed, it can be claimed that, however hesitatingly, Wyndham established a flourishing school of writers\" (ODNB). Octavo. Original green cloth, spine lettered in silver and with publisher's device.
