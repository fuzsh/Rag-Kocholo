As an Amazon Associate I earn money from qualifying purchases.\n\nPublication Order of Triffids Books\n\nPublication Order of Standalone Novels\n\nPublication Order of Short Stories/Novellas\n\nPublication Order of Short Story Collections\n\nPublication Order of Anthologies\n\nJohn Wyndham (born 1903-1969) was the pseudonym used by an English writer of sci-fi John Wyndham Parkes Lucas Beynon Harris. The author also used other combination of his names such as Lucas Parkes and John Beynon, and most of his novels were set in the post-apocalyptic era. His famous works include The Midwich Cuckoos (1957) and The Day of the Triffids (1951).\n\nWyndham, the son of George Beynon Harris and Gertrude Parkes, was born in Dorridge, a village near Knowle, Warwickshire (now known as West Midlands), England. He spent his childhood in Edgbaston in Birmingham, but his parents divorced aged eight years, and he and his brother spent the rest of their youth at public schools such as Blundell’s School in Tiverton, Devon during the First World War. Wyndham longest and the last stay was based at Bedales School in Hampshire from 1918-1921, a place where finally found his happiness and blossomed but left at the age of 18.\n\nAfter leaving Bedales, the author tried several careers including commercial art, farming, advertising, and law but heavily relied on an allowance from his family. He switched to writing for money in 1925 and by 1931, was selling serial fiction, short stories to American science fiction magazines under the pseudonyms John Beynon Harris and John Beynon although he also authored some detective stories.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Wyndham served as a censor in the Ministry of Information and later joined the British Army where he served as a Corporal cipher operator. He also participated in Normandy Landings even though he did not actively participate in the first few days of the operation. After the war, Wyndham switched back to writing, inspired by his brother successful writing career. He changed his writing style, and by 1951, he wrote The Day of the Triffids using the pen name John Wyndham. His pre-war writing career was not discussed in the novel’s publicity, and readers assumed that it was the first book by a previously unknown author. The book was a success as it established Wyndham as an essential figure in the world of science fiction. During his lifetime, Wyndham wrote and published six more novels under the pen name John Wyndham.\n\nIn 1963, Wyndham married Grace Isobel Wilson- a woman he had known for more than two decades. The couple remained married until his death. Wyndham and Grace lived for many years in separate rooms at the Penn Club, London and later moved near Petersfield, Hampshire. A collection of Wyndham letters addressed to his beloved wife during WWII is stored in University of Liverpool archive. In his writing, Wyndham explores the issues around the female gender being forced by their biology to choose between love and careers. In 1969, Wyndham died at his home in Petersfield; he was survived by his wife, Grace and his brother. Additionally, some of Wyndham unsold writing was published, and his prior published work was re-published. In 2015, a street in Hampstead that appears in Wyndham’s novel The Day of the Triffids was named Triffids Alley as a memorial to Wyndham.\n\nWyndham reputation mainly rests on the first four novels published in his lifetime under the pen name, John Wyndham. The Day of the Triffids remains one of Wyndham’s best work, but some readers consider The Chrysalids as his best. He also wrote short stories ranging from whimsical fantasy to science fiction. Some of Wyndham’s books have been optioned to films Random Quest, Consider Her Ways, A Long Spoon, Time to Rest, and Jizzle. Most of his books are set in the 1950’s and Brian Aldiss; a British Sci-Fi labeled Wyndham’s books as cozy catastrophes.\n\nThe Day of the Triffids\n\nThe Day of the Triffids is the first book in Triffids series by John Wyndham. In 1951, Wyndham released The Day of the Triffids to a moderate acclaim. Seven decades later, this horrifying narrative story is a sci-fi classic known by The Times as having all the aspects of a well realized nightmare.\n\nThe story introduces Bill Masen, as he bandages over his injured eyes and misses on one of the most spectacular meteorite showers England has ever seen. Replacing his bandages the next morning, Masen discovers masses of sightless people the following day wondering the city. A moment later, he meets Josella, another lucky fellow who has retained her eyesight and the two immediately leave the city knowing that the safe and the familiar world they once knew is gone forever.\n\nHowever to survive in this post-apocalyptic world, one might confront the Triffids-mysterious plants that years ago started appearing everywhere on the planet. These plants can grow over 7 feet tall and capable of pulling walking and kill any man with their poisonous stingers. With everything in shambles, the Triffids are now poised to prey on human beings.\n\nWyndham surprisingly foresees a bio-warfare many decades before their realization, in this detailed account of Cold War paranoia.\n\nThe Chrysalids\n\nWyndham is often considered as the pioneer of cozy catastrophe- based on the allegation that his main characters tend to be white males who are not affected in any way by the apocalypse and most continue to live it up while the rest of the human population suffer.\n\nThe Chrysalids introduces David Strom, a telepathic main character. He and his friends live in a rural area called Labrador ruled by religious zealots. In this post-apocalypse world, a nuclear holocaust caused massive and widespread mutations in all life forms, and mutations of any kind are regarded as blasphemies. Even minor variations such as small extra toe will lead anyone to death or exile. The discovery of telepathy causes panic among the rulers, and the telepaths are immediately regarded as a threat to humanity and hence hunted down.\n\nWhile The Day of the Triffids is recognized as one of Wyndham’s best books, The Chrysalids is also quoted by some readers as his best. Besides being a fast-paced novel, the underlying message of the narrative is also heartfelt. The novel is a clear metaphor for the cry of the disenfranchised and the ethnic minorities. This novel is a beautiful and highly commendable book with a plot that is quite profound and moving."
