        "text": "video no longer available\n\nOne of my favorite apocalyptic novels is Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham (also the author of The Midwich Cuckoos, which was later translated to the screen as Village of the Damned). Day of the Triffids is about a world where every man, woman and child has gone blind and the planet is taken over by mobile carnivorous plants. Trust me, it's a lot more horrifying than it sounds.\n\nIn 1963, the novel was competently adapted for the screen, and the resulting film has been in the public domain for about ten years. Although it doesn't have nearly the effect of the novel, and although they copped out by giving the film a relatively happy ending, we're posting it here for some leisurely Friday evening viewing.\n\nIncidentally, the BBC adapted Day of the Triffids as a six-part radio drama in 1957, which I think is actually a great deal more faithful to the book.
