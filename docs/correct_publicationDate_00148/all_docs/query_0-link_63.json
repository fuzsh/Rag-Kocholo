        "text": "Written in the classic manner of the great Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Simon Clark presents six occult tales that plunge Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson into a series of adventures that are as mysterious as they are deadly.\n\nSimon Clark has been writing Holmes stories for over twenty years, and has also edited two anthologies, The Mammoth Book of Sherlock Holmes Abroad and Sherlock Holmes’ School for Detection for Robinson.\n\nThis substantial collection, of more than eighty thousand words, features several novella length tales that venture into the eeriest of territories and the strangest of encounters, including:\n\nHolmes’ forensic examination of ancient Egyptian mummies that are not what they first seem… nor do they remain as motionless as the dead should be.\n\nHolmes and Watson descend into ocean depths in a diving bell, hunting for the source of an uncanny voice that haunts all that hear it.\n\nThe great detective goes in search of an old friend through a grim landscape of trenches, barbed wire and shell craters in a world scarred by war.\n\nA man implores Holmes to save his daughter who might well be the victim of a terrible curse invoked by a pagan god from the bloody age of the Vikings.\n\n\"Holmes went to stand at the black coffin, although I should employ the correct term ‘sarcophagus’—this one profusely covered with etchings of those mysterious hieroglyphs and, almost covering one side, a large eye of Horus, that ancient symbol of magical protection composed of flowing lines. “Watson, if you please…” My friend spoke in vigorous tones. “Would you be so good as to hand me the scalpel? I wish to see what lies beneath this gentleman’s face.\"\n\nAll the stories are new and original to this collection with the exception of ‘Sherlock Holmes & the Diving Bell’, which was first published in Gaslight Arcanum: Uncanny Tales of Sherlock Holmes, edited by J.R Campbell and Charles Prepolec, EDGE Science Fiction and Fantasy Publishing, 2011.\n\nIncludes multiple black & white interior illustrations by M. Wayne Miller!\n\nEDITIONS\n\nSigned & Numbered Limited Edition Hardcover\n\nSigned by Author Simon Clark and Artist M. Wayne Miller\n\nHand-Numbered 1 to 100\n\nColor Dust Jacket\n\nSpine Stamping\n\nColor Endsheets\n\nSold Out\n\nSigned PC Limited Edition Hardcover\n\nSigned by Author Simon Clark and Artist M. Wayne Miller\n\nMarked as 'PC' in number slot\n\nColor Dust Jacket\n\nSpine Stamping\n\nColor Endsheets\n\nIn Stock\n\nCONTRIBUTORS\n\nAuthor: Simon Clark\n\nFront Cover & Interior Art: M. Wayne Miller\n\nEditor: Joe Morey\n\nPRAISE FOR SIMON CLARK\n\n“Horror fiction as it should be written—shocking but fascinating.”\n\n— SFX\n\n“…Inventive and fast moving—good old-fashioned fun.”\n\n— The Washington Post on The Night of the Triffids\n\n“…This guy is something special. It’s time to find out what you’ve been missing.”\n\n— Hellnotes\n\n“…Clark has the ability to keep the reader looking over his shoulder to make sure that sudden noise you hear is just the summer night breeze rattling the window.”\n\n— CNN.com\n\n“The pleasure of reading Blood Crazy is immense. I loved it both as a novel and an experience.”\n\n— Mark Morris, Shivers"
