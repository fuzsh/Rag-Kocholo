Factors That Attract Termites To A Property In Newport News

Virginia provides an environment that allows termites to thrive. While that is good for termites, it isn’t good for homes, businesses, and other structures located in Newport News. Termites are wood-eating pests. Their feeding habits are helpful in nature because they help recycle decaying wood and other organic matter. However, when termites find their way to our structures, their feeding habits are no longer valuable; they are destructive pests that have the potential to cause significant structural damage. Each year, termites generate billions of dollars in damage across the country.

To help make your property and home less susceptible to termites, you must understand the factors most likely to attract their attention: moisture and wood. The following things in or near your home can be the root causes of a termite infestation.

Leaky pipes, hoses, or gutters

Roof damage

Tree stumps and fallen trees

Wood mulch

Wood-to-soil contact

Poor ventilation

Keeping a clean yard, repairing moisture issues, and maintaining your home’s exterior are key to protecting your Newport News home from destructive termites.

If you ever find termites on your property or would like to begin proactively safeguarding your property from these damaging pests, Go-Forth Home Services is here to help. Through our comprehensive termite control services, you can rest assured that termites won’t become a problem in your Newport News home.
