        "text": "Bill is the president of the St. George Brewing Company. He is an Air Force brat and a retired US Air Force Lt. Colonel. He retired at Langley AFB in 1994 and worked as a systems analyst for a defense contractor. He saw a newspaper article of a Brew on Premise that had opened in Virginia Beach in 1996 and visited it on the way to a Boy Scout training event. He got hooked — he bought stock and got involved in the company’s operation. The company decided to move into a commercial brewing operation and built a 15 bbl microbrewery in downtown Hampton in 1999. The building the brewery was in was destroyed in a Christmas Eve fire in 2000. The company relocated to its current location in 2001 and has seen many changes in the brewing industry over the years. He became the president in 2003. Bill is an avid Boy Scouter and is currently the Vice President of Council Operations for the Colonial Virginia Council in Newport News. He has a B.S. in Chemistry from N.C. State University, an M.A. in Political Science from Oklahoma State University, and an M.S. in Teleprocessing Science from University of Southern Mississippi. He is married to Linda Jo Berk, a retired Air Force Major he met when they were Second Lieutenants in tech school at Keesler AFB, Mississippi. They have two children, Jennifer and William, Jr. William also works at the brewery. If you are looking for Bill, you can find him on a forklift or with a pint of Slumbering Dragon Scotch Ale in hand!\n\nJacque used to be an avid Michelob Ultra drinker. With some slight teasing from her husband, he convinced her that she needed to try some “good beer,” AKA craft beer. And he was right! Jacque went from “not really liking beer” to loving STG’s Nut Brown Ale. St. George was actually the first craft brewery that Jacque ever visited, while on a trip to Virginia. She started home brewing in 2014, and became involved with the Jefferson County Home Brewer’s club in Festus, MO. Jacque and her husband married in 2015, and she moved to Virginia with her son, Neal. She quickly got involved with the Smithfield Malt and Hops Society, better known as HAMS, a club for local home brewers. In August of 2021, while on a visit to St. George, she was offered a position to work on our production floor. You can find Jacque cleaning tanks, working the kegger, or lending a hand packaging. After work, Jacque enjoys an Oktoberfest or a Weizenbock!\n\nBeth was born and raised in Richmond, VA. In 1996, Beth married the love of her life, Nik, and became a military wife. They have lived all over the US, in Europe, and finally retired to the Hampton Roads area with their 5 children. Beth graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with a Bachelor of Science in Science and a Masters in Teaching. When she isn’t teaching, Beth works for us as a brand ambassador at beer festivals, local tastings and onsite events. Can you believe Beth didn’t drink beer until a few years ago when her husband came home with a bunch of tall boys and had her try them to find out what she liked and didn’t like? The wheat beers won! Beth’s St. George go-to beers are Dragon’s Maiden Wit, Knight’s Respite and Raven Queen, a delicious dunkel!\n\nAfter twenty-two years of dedication, hard work, and many, many beers, St. George Brewing Company said a tearful goodbye to Andy Rathmann, as Brewmaster of St. George. He retired at the end of 2021. Andy has been the vision behind so many of our stellar, award-winning beers.\n\nRathmann did an internship in Germany at Weihenstephan, for brewing, as well as studying in places from hop fields to malting houses. He then went on to earn a master’s certificate in brewing from the University of California at Davis, which is affiliated with the Institute of Brewing in London. He would become an award-winning Brewer at several US microbreweries as well as a consultant to nearly forty startup breweries worldwide before coming to be the Brewmaster at St. George in 1999. Many local brewers have come through St. George to work with Andy and learn the craft of brewing. It is a pleasure to be part of a great local brewing community.\n\nSt. George has won numerous awards over the years under Andy’s leadership in the brewhouse to include the English Ale Awards, United State Beer Tasting Championship, VEER, VA Craft Brewers Guild, and many more. He rounded out his award-winning career by being presented with the first-ever Lifetime Achievement Award from VEER at the 2021 Golden Tap Awards.\n\nWe at St. George, and anyone that has had the pleasure to get to work with Andy over the years, are sad to see him go, but we are excited for his next chapter. We know that he will be raising a beer with us many times more in the future!"
