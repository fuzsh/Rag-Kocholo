        "text": "The Surfrider Foundation was Founded by Glenn Hening, Lance Carson, Tom Pratte, and Chris Blakely in Malibu, CA.\n\nThe Surfrider Foundation was founded by Glenn Hening, Lance Carson, Tom Pratte, Chris Blakely and a group of surfers who were concerned about the environmental threats posed by escalating coastal development at their favorite surf break, Surfrider Beach in Malibu, California.\n\nRelentless, the group addressed the issues and presented solutions to California State Park officials at a public hearing in 1984. They won. And, little by little, they started chalking up successes and fighting battles that continue today.\n\nOn August 22, 1984 the Articles of Incorporation were filed with the State of California, signed by Glenn Hening as President.\n\nWhy the name Surfrider? Although it seems its obvious, Glenn Hening actually coined it “Surfrider” after the Surfrider Inn in Santa Monica, California. It was the hotel Hening stayed at when he was eight-years-old and first visited the west coast with his family.\n\nThe Rhode Island Surfrider Chapter helped save the popular surf break, Ruggles.\n\nRavaged by Sandy, the popular Cliff Walk in Newport, Rhode Island, is on deck for some hefty repairs, which called for placement of huge jetties…smack dab in the middle of one of New England's most popular surf breaks, off Ruggles Ave.\n\nSurfrider Foundation's Rhode Island Chapter kept close tabs on the situation throughout the process, wagering a statement of concern regarding the jetties, attending meetings to review plans, and reporting out to the community. Rhode Island's Coastal Resource Management Council held a public meeting July 17, where lower impact, surfer-friendly plans for the Cliff Walk repair were discussed & approved!\n\nSurfrider launches Ocean Friendly Restaurants Program\n\nPlastic pollution is suffocating our ocean and the many animals that call it home. Researchers estimate there are now over 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic in the ocean with the number continuing to grow every day. This pollution is impacting our marine ecosystems, wildlife such as seabirds, dolphins, fish, and turtles, and plastic fragments are even displacing plankton at the base of the food chain. So what’s the best way to combat this global epidemic facing our ocean? It’s simple: we need to stop the problem at its source! The Surfrider Foundation’s Ocean Friendly Restaurants program does just that. One restaurant, one customer at a time, increases awareness, drives change in behavior and ultimately creates scalable impact to reduce our plastic (and water!) footprint. Learn more about the program here\n\n#DrillingisKilling\n\nFor those of us who love the coast, the negative impacts of offshore oil drilling are obvious. Offshore drilling has a proven track record of polluting the ocean, damaging coastal economies and threatening a way of life enjoyed by millions of people. To help set the record straight, Surfrider released a new short film with surf legend Rob Machado and surfer/ comedian, Tyler Allen, on the Trump administration’s plans for new offshore drilling and what this means for our ocean and coastal communities.Surfrider's network visits Washington D.C. to defend our nation's coasts! Over one hundred Surfrider Foundation members and recreation industry partners traveled to Washington D.C. on February 28 – March 1st to meet with federal leaders about ways to protect our ocean, waves, and beaches. Learn more here.\n\nA Real Border Emergency\n\nThe health and well-being of coastal communities on both sides of the U. S. - Mexico border and the millions of people who enjoy this stretch of coastline have long been under threat from the flow of untreated sewage, industrial pollution and trash into the Tijuana River Watershed and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nLearn more about this problem and how Surfrider San Diego is empowering local communities to protect their health and advocate for solutions here."
