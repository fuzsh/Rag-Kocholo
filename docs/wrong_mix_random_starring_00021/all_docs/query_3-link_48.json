        "text": "Join us as we celebrate the hard work of our DG theater campers, who over the course of six weeks fine-tuned their skills in art, music, and literacy- all while learning the inner workings of theater production.\n\nThe classic tale of kindness to animals trots, crawls and flies onto the stage in Doctor Dolittle JR. All of the characters we've come to love through the stories of Hugh Lofting and the magical movie musical are given new life in the stage version.\n\nThe musical tells the classic tale of a wacky, but kind, doctor who can talk to animals, taking the audience on a journey from the small English village of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh to the far corners of the world. When Doctor Dolittle attempts to help a seal named Sophie, he’s wrongly accused of murder and stands trial before General Bellowes. Once pronounced innocent, Dolittle is free to continue with his search for the Great Pink Sea Snail — the oldest and wisest of the creatures on earth.\n\nJuly 27, 2024\n\nShow times: 11 AM & 3PM\n\nAugust 13, 2024 - JOIN US!\n\nJoin us for this warm and welcoming open mic night held in person on the second Tuesday of every month at 7:00 pm.
