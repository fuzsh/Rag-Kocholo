        "text": "The Newport News School Board conducts a regular meeting each month and welcomes input from the public. Each regular meeting provides two opportunities for public comments from individuals addressing topics not appearing on the agenda. The first audience with the public, not to exceed 30 minutes, is at the beginning of the meeting following the opening ceremonies and Board recognitions and honors. The second opportunity to speak is toward the end of the meeting, following the Reports/Information section of the agenda.\n\nCards are available upon entering the meeting for individuals wishing to address the Board. They should fill out the card with name, address, and the topic on which they wish to speak, and return it to the agenda table. Individuals will be recognized by the School Board Chairman in the order the cards were received. Comments should be limited to a three-minute timeframe. A light system will display a green light when the speaker begins, a yellow light with 30 seconds remaining, and a red light to indicate the end of the three minutes. The Chairman will rule on such matters as the appropriateness of the subject being presented and the suitability of the time for such a presentation."
