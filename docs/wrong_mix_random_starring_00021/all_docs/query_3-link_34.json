People wanting to drink had to buy liquor from licensed druggists for \"medicinal\" purposes, clergy for \"religious\" reasons or illegal sellers known as bootleggers. Another option was to enter private, unlicensed barrooms, nicknames \"speakeasies\" for how low you had to speak the \"password\" to gain entry so as not to be overheard by law enforcement.\n\nDrinks"
