        "text": "Thank you to Cathy Welch, Oyster Pointer’s writer, who I met and talked with about my work at Riverside. I appreciated her time to research, interview and write about me.\n\nTricia Wessler, Associate Director of VCU/Riverside FM Residency Program\n\nI loved the May article about James River Family Practice and so did my staff. (I hope patients will, too.) It meant so much to my staff to be recognized. The feature was well written by Kayla Brundick and really captured the essence of all we have done, are doing and hope to do in the future. It also may benefit many who were patients of Hampton independent family medical doctor Tim Raines who recently suddenly passed away and all his patients now need to find a new doc again. Thank you.\n\nDr. James Halverson, James River Family Practice\n\nRead in May issue of Oyster Pointer that Myra Legg has been named director of development with the Mariners’ Museum. I am proud of her!\n\nJudy Fitzpatrick, Newport News\n\nOur thanks to Anna Dorl for the excellent article on Warwick Travel Service in the April Oyster Pointer. She hit the nail on the head when referring to our seasoned and dedicated travel advisors who have been with Warwick Travel for multiple decades. After 48 years on Warwick Boulevard, we are enjoying a new chapter, a new beginning in Oyster Point Commons on Jefferson Avenue. And, yes, we do enjoy making travel dreams come true!\n\nNancy B. Alligood, CTC, General Manager/Owner, Warwick Travel\n\nI read all of Brian Cole’s columns because I find his mind and reflection on subjects of matter enlightening, energizing, thought provoking and interesting! I am sure a lot of his readers feel the same. After reading them, I find myself reflecting on my life/accomplishments or lack of — and I find myself adjusting! Change? Oh, yes because change is a constant in my life. Thanks to Brian for helping me confirm it’s necessary for growth!\n\nTeri Zodda, Newport News\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed your April Greetings about “magic.” Like you, I don’t need to know how everything works, just enjoy its magic — kids, nature, all of it! For many years now I have called my computer “the Magic Box.” I don’t have a clue how it works but am truly amazed what appears after the push of a button!\n\nTom Waltz, Campana Waltz Commercial Real Estate, LLC-East\n\nI look forward to Brian Cole’s Viewpoint columns and always appreciate his great insights and thoughts.\n\nBobby Hilling, Newport News\n\nIn the May issue, I found two amazing features worth mentioning. One is the Busy Nothings Coffee Company, a cozy little café with delicious coffee. Debbie and her team have set up a perfect spot to unwind and enjoy a cup of coffee. The other feature is Coastal Fermentory, owned by Seth, a very friendly person who loves to talk about his business and the importance of supporting the community. It’s great to see both businesses as new members of the Virginia Peninsula Chamber and the Small Business Community. I appreciate Oyster Pointer for recognizing these new businesses and the people behind them.\n\nBecki Whitehurst, Member Services, Virginia Peninsula Chamber\n\nThank you so much for telling our story to the Oyster Pointer audience in the May issue. Dr. Terilyn J. Goins did a great job in writing it. Thanks for making it possible to feature our tremendous work for children and families. We were honored to be featured in this issue.\n\nDiane Umstead, Executive Director, FirstSpark\n\nThe March Issue of Oyster Pointer was delivered and I pounced, as a huge smile crossed my face! I certainly appreciate the efforts of Brian DePrinzio, Oyster Pointer’s business manager, as well as the entire team for assisting us in getting our message in print! Please share our appreciation with all involved. Your time and follow-up were utmost important and certainly appreciated by the team here at Frank & Shapiro, Real Estate, Inc.\n\nJanie K. Perkins, Administrator, Frank & Shapiro Real Estate, Inc.\n\nThank you for everything you do for Newport News Tourism. We love Oyster Pointer!\n\nBecky Cutchins, Newport News Tourism\n\nI really enjoyed the feature about Mr. Bill Brauer and his family history with Christopher Newport University and his association with two dear friends of mine, Tony Santoro and Walter Segaloff. I was moved to tears that he had built two chairs to be auctioned at one of Walter’s Achievable Dream projects. His devotion to his friends, making personalized pens, is something I found very special about Bill Brauer. I hope he continues to brighten the world with his kindness and caring.\n\nEd Olshansky, Sarasota, Florida\n\nI was thrilled to see the smiling face of Bill Brauer gracing the front page of the February Oyster Pointer! Anna Dorl truly captured the goodness of him! I’m so glad that Bill shared his unique hobby with Oyster Pointer readers. I’m positive that many of our Christopher Newport University family loved reading about him. Each of his pens is unique and amazing — just like he is! Thank you for featuring this gentle giant in your paper.\n\nDr. Lisa Spiller, Christopher Newport University\n\nThank you so much for sharing your reach and influence with our United Way. As you may know, one of the greatest challenges charitable organizations face is bringing awareness to the problems we are working to solve. By telling the United Way story, you allowed us to give voice to the unsung heroes who serve as staff and volunteers in the nonprofit sector, and to put a face to ALICE (Asset Limited Income Constrained Employed) and those who need us. We are immensely grateful [to Noelle Riddle for her writing] and for your work to keep our community informed and to include United Way of the Virginia Peninsula.\n\nCharvalla West, Chief Operating Officer and Director of Community Impact, United Way of the Virginia Peninsula.\n\nIt was wonderful seeing Stan Glasofer’s Pointless column In the January issue. It just goes to show that Stan’s spirit still remains with Oyster Pointer.\n\nEd Olshansky, Sarasota, Florida\n\nThe February Insuring Success column by Jimmy Fay with State Farm was very informative. My granddaughter is going away to college and has a high GPA, and the fact that she might get some discounts is great news. I will share this with my son, her dad. She has also chosen CNU as her college! More exciting, since she is from Pittsburgh. I was wondering why car insurance was increasing. Now it makes more sense. Thanks for sharing his knowledge with us.\n\nBecki Whitehurst, Newport News\n\nBrian Cole’s message in February’s Viewpoint column was so on target. We, unfortunately, tend to look at all the religious and political strife going on in the world and question how our society has come to this. I certainly agree with Brian’s focus on all the advantages that we have and the need to stay positive and kind.\n\nSusan Harris, Hampton\n\nWhat a nice piece about Bill Brauer, appropriately including the word legacy in its title. We talked at length once while I was an auditing student at CNU about his entire portfolio of duties in his later years there, an extensive list, probably more than his innate modesty might disclose. Also absent is his culinary expertise, especially with a barbecue grill. Most importantly, anyone who knew or met him professionally or even casually, would attest to his congeniality, loyalty, competence, keen judgment, patriotism and willingness to help others. Oyster Pointer writer Anna Dorl has indeed led us in the right direction to honor this terrific man and his continuing contribution to our community.\n\nRich Rinaldo, Newport News\n\nAs a longtime resident of the Peninsula who moved away for 16 years, it is very gratifying to have access to local news about happenings and people on the peninsula in the Oyster Pointer. It was so nice to read in the February issue the interesting feature about Bill Brauer, with whom my husband worked at Christopher Newport University and whose parents were friends for any years. Bill was certainly a very important individual in the development of CNU. Also his woodworking talent was fascinating and a real plus to his many abilities. Thank you so much for sharing his story.\n\nAnn Wood, Newport News\n\nThank you for the feature about Huffman & Huffman Attorneys, which appeared in the December 2023 issue, Writer Anna Dorl did a great job, and we greatly appreciate the exposure for our 50th anniversary milestone!\n\nCrystal Breede, Marketing Director, Huffman & Huffman\n\nThank you for the interview and the wonderful feature in the January issue, highlighting the 75th year of the Peninsula Sports Club. In a very complete manner our mission, scope of student athlete club coverage, events available for attendance and scholarship distribution were displayed. The feature gave to your readers an interesting capsule of who we are and what we do. Now we hope that many will attend one of our events, all are open to the public, and then even better, see the productive good done by the PSC on the Peninsula for the student athletes and others through athletics. Interested individuals may learn more about the PSC by going to our website at peninsulasportsclub.com. Thank you, again, for allowing the image of the Peninsula Sports Club to be shown to the Peninsula. Oyster Pointer is a wonderful tool in so many ways. Best wishes for a most successful and healthy new year.\n\nSonny Seay, Peninsula Sports Club Board Director\n\nI really enjoyed the column by Brian Cole in the January issue. The Part Three advice hit home as I need to start walking! I appreciated his advice and will do my best to get started.\n\nSara Jo Rubin, Rubin Communications Group\n\nThe November issue of Oyster Pointer was a particularly good one. We already use the Recovery Operations Center to do recycling, and the other articles are interesting also. Thanks for this publication.\n\nHelen Davis, Newport News\n\nWe at Pointe Wellness Center greatly appreciated the October cover story about our work of providing and promoting wellness opportunities through the services that we offer. Many people have reached out for more information or to schedule an appointment. Thank you to your staff and writers.\n\nVicki Lanier, LPC, Haley Hanlon,\n\nPointe Wellness Center\n\nI love the Point Blank feature on Tyler Neese in the November issue! Those of us who know him realize how awesome he is and now everyone one else will have a glimpse of his humble personality and high moral character. I’m so proud of him! And, thanks to Oyster Pointer for featuring one of our very best CNU Captains for Life!\n\nDr. Lisa D. Spiller,\n\nChristopher Newport University\n\nThe [Point Blank] feature on Tyler Neese was just great! He is such a nice young man.\n\nBecki Whitehurst,\n\nVA Peninsula Chamber of Commerce\n\nA heartfelt thank you to Oyster Pointer writer Noelle Riddle for the incredible feature about The DeGood Foundation in the December issue. Noelle not only captured the most important elements of what we do but also shared that Dolly Parton does not pay for the books and it’s not my full-time role (although I wish it was!). And it had a wonderful call to action on how people can get involved. No other media outlet has done that — nor come close. Thank you for your attention to detail.\n\nKyle DeGood, The DeGood Foundation\n\nI really enjoyed your Greetings from the Editor (October 2023). I appreciated your perspective on “savers” vs “hoarders.” I am a sentimental saver and your comments were like a breath of fresh air! Thanks for kicking that guilt monkey off my back. And, know that I am surely but one of many kindred “saver” spirits out here in Oyster Point land!\n\nSandra Hood, Coldwell Banker Traditions\n\nWith reference to your October greetings about clutter — I would call myself a curator. I even have first-grade drawings from classmates. I dig out these keepsakes when the occasion calls for it. Our pasts are cluttered, always incomplete in meaning, waiting to inspire, disclose new insights, projects and expression. Only time, organization, responsibilities and energy bind it all.\n\nRich Rinaldo, Newport News\n\nWhat a blessing Oyster Pointer continues to be for our community! Thank you so much for the opportunity in your August edition to bring awareness to your readers about our special niche in the holistic/biological dental world. By allowing us to promote our unique approach to dental care, we can help more people have not only beautiful smiles, but also healthier mouths and bodies. The article has already opened a lot of eyes in our community. We are grateful!\n\nLisa Marie Samaha, DDS, FAGD, Port Warwick Dental Arts\n\nJust to tell you what a reach Oyster Pointer has, I was looking through the latest issue online and what jumps out at me? A column on African safari written by a local travel agent. Who wants to go to Africa for their 40th anniversary and wants to start researching how to put together a trip? My husband and I! I will be contacting the travel agent I found in the Oyster Pointer.\n\nKathyrn Barrett, Virginia Beach\n\nThank you for running the Tidbit about Alex Hazelwood in the August issue. Alex received numerous congratulatory notes from friends and family who routinely read Oyster Pointer. We appreciate all the work you do to highlight individuals, organizations and businesses in our community to keep us all informed, connected and locally engaged!\n\nAbby Smith, Marketing Director and Talent Manager, Abbitt Realty Company, Inc.\n\nI love, love, love the Greetings from the Editor in the August 2023 issue of Oyster Pointer! If only I can remember to act this way versus reacting and increasing needless stress!\n\nAnn Gregory\n\nThe September Money Matters column by David Seeley, CPA with Moore, Candella & Associates, regarding Social Security and tax benefits was so timely for me. I have been asking questions about this exact subject, so I greatly appreciated the information.\n\nSara Jo Rubin, Virginia Beach\n\nThank you for your dedication and support to our community for all these years! I and so many others really appreciate your service to the community! We ALL really appreciate YOU!\n\nDavid Yeatts, Yeatts & Company, Newport News\n\nThank you for sharing our story in the August issue of Oyster Pointer. We have already heard from quite a few people who had not heard of us and now know more of what we do to support local nonprofits! A perk of being located in City Center is being part of the Oyster Pointer community. Your paper is one of the remaining few truly local newspapers, and I love reading what local businesses and organizations are doing right here in our communities.\n\nThank you for helping to raise awareness for NetworkPeninsula and for so many of our local nonprofits. We are also excited for the Hub to be one of your newest distribution sites and look forward to keeping future editions on site for our visitors!\n\nKaren P. Dutro, Executive Director, NetworkPeninsula\n\nThank you for the wonderful article in the May Oyster Pointer. That was such a thoughtful and appreciated gesture. I have received so much positive feedback since its release.\n\nA. Heath Cash III, DDS, Peninsula Family Dentistry\n\nThe cover story of the June issue is fantastic. We are so grateful for your interest in our team and for the opportunity to showcase them in Oyster Pointer.\n\nDiane Fulton, Director of Sales and Marketing, Newport News Marriott at City Center\n\nThanks for all you do for our community by keeping us informed\n\nWard R. Scull III, Newport News\n\nMy wife and I celebrated her retirement (25 years at ODU) with brunch at Schlesinger’s (Port Warwick) and saw your paper. Thanks for all of the support and exposure you provide for the local small business community.\n\nRon Clark, LEADwell, LLC, Newport News\n\nI just finished reading the April Oyster Pointer and enjoyed every article. I especially enjoyed the editor’s comments concerning superstitions.\n\nBetty Bailey, Newport News\n\nThank you for publishing “Your Child is turning 18. Now what?” by A. Eric Kauders, Jr., of Old Point Wealth Management. It contained excellent and useful information for me. I had no idea of these important legal details to take care of. The article was very well written and easy to follow.\n\nLaurie Drucker, Austin, Texas\n\nI loved the article about Vital Records Control in the February issue. Cassie Turner is good people.\n\nBill Gray, Newport News\n\nThank you for such a beautiful article by Kelli Caplan in the February issue [“Sinclair McCracken, MD: Keeping family in family medicine”]. I felt so loved by all the details and kind words.\n\nSinclair B. McCracken, MD\n\nTPMG Thimble Shoals Family Medicine\n\nThanks to Kelli Caplan for writing an amazing article, “Sinclair McCracken, MD: Keeping family in family medicine,” capturing the absolute essence of the wonderful woman I am honored to have in my life.\n\nKen and Sandy Mathews, Heather Klose\n\nKen Mathews Garden Center\n\nIt was an enormous pleasure to read the thoughtful article by Dr. Terilyn Goins in the February issue about Hampton Roads Academy’s Philanthropy Committee, and then an even bigger thrill to share it with the committee members themselves. I am happy to report that we received congratulatory messages from parents, including one who offered to speak to the students about her career in nonprofits, and we have had two executive drectors from local nonprofits say they read the article and are applying for a grant. There are probably more out there that are doing the same! Thank you — this story has given our student members recognition that encourages them to be all the more committed.\n\nJaik Henderso\n\nDirector of Advancement Hampton Roads Academy\n\nThank you and the Oyster Pointer staff for the feature recognizing Ken Mathews Garden Center’s 50th anniversary. We especially appreciated Nancy Sykes (of blessed memory) and her storytelling abilities.\n\nKen and Sandy Mathews, Heather Klose\n\nKen Mathews Garden Center\n\nI read and appreciated Nancy Alligood’s TravelWise column in the December issue of Oyster Pointer. Switzerland is my favorite European country. I rode the cog train up the mountain. The view from Zermatt was splendid. We went way back up in the Alps to view the Matterhorn. So beautiful.\n\nSandra Bowden Marshall, Newport News\n\nI enjoyed the October articles and community focus, including the greeting about the “still small voice.” Congratulations on the awards Oyster Pointer recently won. I am adding my voice to the kudos you have received that are so well deserved.\n\nJoanna Pierce, Newport News\n\nIt’s always a joy to be featured in an Oyster Pointer article! You truly capture our essence, which always encourages the right people to reach out to us for the unique and personalized care we offer. We are so grateful for how you prepare the way for the wonderful connections we enjoy!\n\nLisa Marie Samaha, DDS, FAGD\n\nPort Warwick Dental Arts\n\nExcellent write-up regarding Jen Watson’s Firm Touch Therapeutic in the December issue. She has been my neuro-muscular massage therapist for the past five years. I was referred to her by Dr. Jeremy Hoff, formerly of Hampton Roads Orthopedic & Sports Medicine, who was my pain doctor. Jen addresses my multiple issues: migraine, head, neck, jaw, shoulder, back, pelvic, hip and bursa. My pain stems from a car accident 30 years ago and a hip fall eight years ago. I still need my neurologist and pain doctor, but Jen does miracles with her firm touch and deep muscle massage.\n\nDenise Augustine, Williamsburg\n\nSpecial thanks to Brian DePrinzio, business manager, for his stellar direction, graciousness and follow up. And to your brilliant writers, too, who know how to capture the essence of a business. What an amazing crew you have! Your collective, over-the-top service and talents are beyond expectation at Oyster Pointer! It is a dream to work with your wonderful publication and even more so, to be featured!\n\nLisa Marie Samaha, DDS, FAGD, PC\n\nPort Warwick Dental Arts\n\nI love the Oyster Pointer! Every time I see it, I grab a copy. The column, “Simple,” in the October 2022 issue by Brian Cole was a perspective game changer. This column transparently presented that living life simply and enjoying the journey on your terms and being okay with it, needs no explanation. The niceties of life are good but appreciating the simple things is even better. Having more stuff does not equate to prosperity. Living life in the simplest way possible is priceless. This column was truly a good reminder to simply live and live simply.\n\nKeisha Barham\n\nI enjoy your Greetings from the Editor as well as all of the other informative articles and photos in Oyster Pointer. Thank you.\n\nSherry Lewis, Newport News\n\nWe always enjoy the opening Greetings from the Editor. Should be signed by “Dr. Sylvia,” as the positive words always leave us with a better feeling and a smile. The September issue featuring Dottie’s Custom Cleaning was like winning a happy lottery for us. Nancy Sykes’ human interest presentation was a winner. Thank you, Nancy! We were inspired to send a note to Ms. Humphreys. Shortly, we received a response from her and a wonderful result happened: Dottie and her helper performed some great rescue help for our old home — and she even brought us brownies! WOW! We are happy seniors. And, Sylvia, we hope you enjoy a jelly donut!\n\nCharlie and Sally Rhodes, Newport News\n\nIt is nice to read something with so much positive news.\n\nSue Wills, Yorktown\n\nThank you for the wonderful feature about my business and me in the September Oyster Pointer. I have had so many people call and express in person how much they enjoyed reading it. I have met and talked with many senior citizens about working for them! In fact, I met with an 81-year-old gentleman who read about me and now he is my customer. All of my customers read the Oyster Pointer. When they talk about me, it makes me feel good. I was always taught that you treat people as you want them to treat you! I love all of my customers; they seem to be part of my family. Thank you so much for this honor. It was great!\n\nDorothy “Dottie” Humphreys,\n\nNewport News\n\nI found the October publication of Oyster Pointer very appealing and attractive. Lots and lots of nice articles about the community where we live.\n\nBetty Bailey, Newport News\n\nThe headline (August 2022) couldn’t be more appropriate: “Kelly Peck: A banker making dreams come true.” First, Kelly helped me in a straight-forward business purchase and renovation of a building on City Center Boulevard. Then, about a year later in a very creative and not-to-be-denied way, she helped make MY dream come true of buying an old beach cottage with sentimental value. Thank you Kelly. You’re the best!\n\nBrian Cole, Personal Training Associates\n\nPicked up Oyster Pointer when I was in town. Always informative — thanks for your work in keeping this publication alive and relevant.\n\nMary Ann Elliott, Arlington, VA\n\nI enjoyed reading in the September issue what people would do if they won the lottery. I became really choked up over the comments from John Kennedy, of Art Newsome, Inc. He didn’t mention any of the material things he would buy for himself or his family, but mentioned that he would fund his daughter in her dream of turning old hotels into places for the homeless. In a community like ours, where a huge portion of the homeless are military veterans, this had a big impact on me. Mr. Kennedy’s daughter is obviously all the things that we could wish our own daughters to be at 14 years of age. Her concern for the homeless is remarkable, although much credit should go to the parents of this amazing teenager, as they obviously have played a large part in teaching her social values and supporting her endeavor.\n\nA devoted reader, Gloucester\n\nKudos to Sylvia and staff for the wonderful story that was done about me in the September 2022 issue. A special thanks to Kelli Caplan who interviewed me and wrote the story. She was able to capture the real essence of what I was telling her during the interview. It is no wonder that Oyster Pointer is one of the most sought-after news magazines in the area. Good Luck in the future.\n\nBill Grace, Newport News\n\nTerrific article in the August issue on feeding the birds [Wild Birds Unlimited] by Nancy Sykes. The enthusiasm of the staff is absolutely inspirin, not to mention catching. In fact, I am having bird feeder envy! And the Oyster Point Profile about Kelly Peck of TowneBank captured this dedicated and hard-working professional. Congratulations, Oyster Pointer, on 35 years of publishing. Always interesting and full of new places and people we might not ordinarily come across.\n\nLaurie Gassman, Newport News\n\nGreat issue [May] as always and this month I see articles about my friends’ businesses: Criner Remodeling and Indulge!\n\nSusan Adams, Newport News\n\nCongratulations on your recognition by the Circulation Verification Council. As a satisfied advertiser for more than 20 years, I agree with their assessment. Our business has benefitted from the consistent increase in your circulation. Thanks, Sylvia!\n\nBrian Cole, Personal Training Associates\n\nWith reference to Brian Cole’s April Viewpoint column, best yet. Great sentiments on fourth quarter.\n\nBud Ramey, Newport News\n\nBrian Cole’s April Viewpoint column spoke to me. It is so relevant in all our lives where he talks about how life is a series of transitions — life is so busy that we forget how quickly time continues to flow along until we find ourselves experiencing transitions that cause us to continually re-evaluate what is and is not important as we progress through the years. Brian’s focus on the word “Transitions” is at the core of all our lives, our work, family, decisions we make. I thank Brian for reminding us to think of life in this way and for always offering insightful and thought-provoking columns.\n\nKelly Peck, Executive Vice President-Commercial Lender, TowneBank\n\nOn behalf of the board of directors for the Peninsula Pastoral Counseling Center (PPCC) please accept my sincere thanks for the wonderful article highlighting the work of the center [February issue]. Residents of the Peninsula and Williamsburg are so fortunate to have access to affordable and very professional counseling through PPCC. For nearly 50 years PPCC has been serving clients and helping them to become the best version of themselves, and the Center takes pride in serving everyone regardless of their ability to pay. The board also recognizes how fortunate we are to have the leadership of our Executive Director, the Rev. Becky Glass. What a pleasant surprise to see the article and Becky prominently displayed on your February cover! Thanks again for this special coverage.\n\nMartha N. Miller, President\n\nPPCC Board of Directors\n\nYou have the best cross-section of interesting people and businesses. I love the articles that Nancy Sykes writes. She captures personalities so well.\n\nLaurie Gassman, Newport News\n\nThe feature about Morgan James Publishing that appeared in the March issue of Oyster Pointer expressly highlighted the innerworkings of our growing company, giving your readers the opportunity to learn more about what we do and how much we love our work. Special thanks to your writer Noelle Riddle, who was a pleasure to work with, detailing our company and its focus. Oyster Pointer offers a special service to our community and we were proud to be spotlighted. Thank you for all that you do.\n\nDavid Hancock, Founder\n\nMorgan James Publishing\n\nWhat a wonderful article about Village Studio Arts: Discovering the Joy of Creating Art by Nancy Sykes [March issue]. I also always especially enjoy reading your “Greetings from the Editor.” Happy Spring!\n\nSherry Lewis, Newport News\n\nI want to thank you for the opportunity to feature Thomas Nelson in Oyster Pointer [April issue]. To writer Kelli Caplan, my first reaction to the article was WOW! I am at a loss for words, which is difficult for me. Thank you for capturing my passion of this college and our community so eloquently. Members of our board and foundation board have reached out to me, sharing their glee with what was written. This is a wonderful way to end the week and Women’s History Month.\n\nDr. Towuanna Porter Brannon, President\n\nThomas Nelson Community College\n\nThank you for featuring me in Point Blank for January’s issue. I have received all kinds of phone calls and texts from people who saw it! I really appreciated it.\n\nJoseph F. Verser, Esq.\n\nHeath, Old & Verser, P.L.C.\n\nSuper sweet to come back to the Abbitt Realty Co. office and see my latest article in the January issue of Oyster Pointer with messages of encouragement. Thanks as always for the opportunity to put pen to paper and thank you for providing a great resource for our local community.\n\nKaéra Mims, Associate Broker/ REALTOR®\n\nAbbitt Realty Company, LLC\n\nWe enjoy every issue! Keep the good stuff coming!\n\nJanie Perkins, Administrator\n\nFrank & Shapiro Real Estate, Inc.\n\nI just read the February Oyster Pointer and I absolutely loved the feature story on Earthy Nest! Special thanks for showcasing such innovative and visionary entrepreneurs! Congratulations to you.\n\nDr. Lisa Spiller\n\nDistinguished Professor of Marketing\n\nJoseph W. Luter, III School of Business\n\nChristopher Newport University\n\nThank you so much for giving us this wonderful opportunity (re: Earthy Nest, February issue). The feature story looks great and I appreciate it.\n\nAanal Vora, Earthy Nest, LLC\n\nWith reference to the columns by Brian Cole, we are very pleased with what we read. His columns “On aging gracefully” (July 2021), “Planning, problem solving and imagination” (Sept. 2021), “Bones” (Nov. 2021) and “I’m confused…” (Dec. 2021) illustrate that he is a gifted and wise person. We are glad we crossed paths with him and we look forward to many more years with him. We are also very pleased with our experience with his trainer Wendy Stephens.\n\nDan & Elizabeth Ann Mannen\n\nNewport News\n\nWe are new to the area and it was great being able to see new activities happening in the area and be exposed to what’s happening.\n\nCyzzannesh Reeves, Newport News\n\nThank you, to you and your staff, for writing a very enlightening feature in the December issue about the Newport News Public Art Foundation. Kelli Caplan was a pleasure to work with and did a beautiful job of telling our story, detailing the work of our board and community stakeholders. Oyster Pointer does a tremendous service in our community. Thank you for all that you do.\n\nDanny Carroll, Executive Director\n\nNewport News Public Art Foundation\n\nVery interesting article on the Lee Hall Depot in the October issue. Look forward to each month’s issue!\n\nEvelyn Vretos, Newport News\n\nThanks so much for your support. Our work for Public Art would not be possible without you. Thank you\n\nDanny Carroll, Executive Director\n\nNewport News Public Art Foundation\n\nThanks for including our story in the September issue [page 16]. My team and I really appreciate your support.\n\nMike Monteith, Peninsula Community Foundation of Virginia\n\nI enjoy Oyster Pointer. You guys have been around a good while. I love keeping up with what is happening in our business community.\n\nBenjaminT. Watson, DDS, PLC\n\nThank you for the terrific article in the October issue on Alexis Swann with TowneBank, by Dave Hunt. It truly captured her contributions to the community as well as her incredible background. I enjoyed the article and learned quite a bit about Alexis.\n\nSara Jo Rubin, Chief Operating Officer, Rubin Communications Group\n\nI received a copy of the October Oyster Pointer today and I was surprised to be on the front page! I am extremely grateful that you thought my personal story was impactful enough to highlight. I can’t wait to share with family and friends! What an honor and a privilege! Thank you!\n\nAlexis Swann, Peninsula and Williamsburg President, TowneBank\n\nI read with great enthusiasm and pride your article about Alexis Swann, president of Townebank’s Peninsula and Williamsburg offices. The article was well written and captured the essence of her professional and community acumen. I continue to be impressed with the world class journalism of your Oyster Pointer team.\n\nDr. Allen R. Jones, Jr. PT.DPT, Dominion Physical Therapy & Associates\n\nThank you so much to Dr. Terilyn Goins for her work on the Oyster Pointer profile in which I was featured in the August issue. She did a fantastic job of capturing everything that I said and really got to the heart of it! I am honored by her work. Thank you so much for this opportunity.\n\nDana Robbins, REALTOR®, Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Towne Realty\n\nI am enjoying reading a real paper I can hold in my hands. You are doing a great job! I look forward to the next one!\n\nCindy Burns, Yorktown\n\nI especially enjoyed the cover story about the new Waterworks director [in the July 2021 issue]\n\nFrancie Pearce, Newport News\n\nThe cover feature about Fort Monroe by Nancy P. Sykes in the June issue of Oyster Pointer was most appreciated. Keep up the good reporting!\n\nMattie B. Flowers, Newport News\n\nI received the June Oyster Pointer in the mail today. Great stories and information. Keep up your wonderful service. There are several items I will clip and keep in my files. Best wishes.\n\nCharlie Rhodes, Newport News\n\nThe July cover story by Kelli Caplan about Yann LeGouellec, Newport News Waterworks director, was so well written, and really showed his love of working in the water industry. Very relatable to the reader, and so down to earth. So often doctors and professional engineers are seen as stuffy and rigid, but Yann really is a people person and full of energy. This feature really captured his personality. And how coincidental that we saw the feature on June 30, which is Virginia’s Water and Wastewater Professional Appreciation Day. Thank you!\n\nCyndi Masterstaff, Public Education Coordinator, Newport News Waterworks\n\nI think this paper is great! I told myself I would spend about 30 minutes getting to know the publication, and I came up for air about an hour and a half later. I had gotten caught up in just enjoying the paper!\n\nMeredith Glendening, Marketing Coordinator, Promise Law\n\nThanks for your good work as editor of this fine publication!\n\nTom Davis, Newport News\n\nI picked up Oyster Pointer today, and it made me smile with memories of the article you did years ago about my company, Signed, Sealed & Delivered. My life has changed since those days, but the memories of the community at City Center and your celebration of the businesses and people continue to inspire me. My favorite will always be Point Blank. Thanks for the smile today.\n\nKim Humphrey, Association for Manufacturing Excellence\n\nHave you ever had your groceries checked out in the store and then discovered your credit cards and cash missing from your purse? It happened to me recently, but the memory of my credit card number I thought would save me. Oh no, cash registers take only chips. We were stuck, until an employee came from behind the customer service counter and pulled out his credit card, announcing he’d pay for my groceries. “Pay it forward,” he explained, and urged me to adopt his values. Wow, I was saved. I picked up his business card and sent him a check when I got home. It wasn’t cashed. He had my return address from the envelope and he sent the voided check back to me, admonishing me to “pay it forward.” Little by little this trend will instill hope in a weary world. Thank you, Doug, for your kindness and your teaching.\n\nJudy Fitzpatrick, Newport News\n\nThank you so much for the article written by Nancy Sykes about ShoeLady in the April Oyster Pointer! I liked her concise and upbeat style. She captured the important points and expressed them much more clearly than I ever do in conversation. I have already received an invitation to speak at a local service organization’s meeting because they saw the article. Thank you for this publicity!\n\nBill Hoffman, ShoeLady.org\n\nI especially enjoyed reading your Spring Greetings and on being happy. Happy Spring to you!\n\nSherry Lewis, Newport News\n\nI just wanted to thank you for the excellent job you and your team did on the March article about our practice. I enjoyed the time working with your team. As always, you did a standup job. I have enjoyed working with Oyster Pointer over the years; your team does an excellent job keeping the community informed on businesses in the Oyster Point area. Having grown up in the area, I have been able to see the changes over the years. I feel blessed to have the opportunity to work in a career I love and in the community that has meant so much to me. Thank you again and please pass on the thanks to your team. I look forward to working with you in the future.\n\nTom Watson,\n\nBenjamin T. Watson DDS, PLC\n\nJust completed the April 2021 edition of the paper, and I want to tell you how very much I enjoyed this issue! Shoelady.org was wonderful, honoring both the late co-founder and the group’s on-going mission. Brian Cole’s salute to his wife and mother, Barb and Sue, was a lovely tribute to those women. I had a few laughs from Stan Glasofer’s column and was sorry to read of his death. The Marksman and The Corner Store Chef were terrific business profiles. Thank you lots for all you did for this issue! Well done!\n\nAnn P. Gregory\n\nBrian Cole’s April column, “Barb and Sue…Two Women I Knew,” was lovely. Two special women in his life, deserving of his tribute. Brian has a unique voice and style. It was beautiful and brave of him to write and share it.\n\nMarty Hightower, Newport News\n\nWhat a treat to grace the cover of your February issue of Oyster Pointer. Thank you for all that you do to spotlight business in the Oyster Point area. As the success coach for Abbitt Realty, which is celebrating its 75th year, I appreciate the platform to share my story and mission to help my community.\n\nKaéra Mims, Abbitt Realty Co.\n\nI just finished reading the February issue. Keep up the good work!\n\nSteve Laurent, Newport News\n\nThank you for all that you do for the business community, publishing Oyster Pointer and always keeping us up to date on all that happens in this part of Newport News.\n\nSandy Bridgman, Executive Vice President, Waters & Bridgman Agency\n\nThank you so much to Terilyn Goins for the beautiful write up in the January issue of Oyster Pointer. It captured the essence of who we are and what we do quite nicely. The layout was beautiful as well, and we have received many compliments. We look forward to a continued relationship with the “Oyster Pointer Community” that you and your staff have done an excellent job of sustaining.\n\nKatherine L. Brown, PFP, NAPFA\n\nSenior Wealth Advisor, Joss Brown Wealth Advisors\n\nRemembering Stan Glasofer\n\nStan had many talents, one of which was his humor, and Oyster Pointer was kind enough to give him a column to showcase his unique sense of humor. His death will leave a huge void in the lives of all who were fortunate to have known him, and the loss goes deep in so many venues where Stan was active and committed. Our community and Oyster Pointer have lost a truly vibrant voice, and the loss will be felt for a very long time. Thank you for giving Stan Glasofer the opportunity to have his very own Pointless column in Oyster Pointer. He loved that and we loved him.\n\nEd Olshansky, Former Neighbor and Friend, Newport News\n\nThank you very much for this latest issue of Oyster Pointer. I always enjoy reading all of the articles in it. And the photos are very nice, too. Keep up the great work with your monthly publications\n\nSherry Lewis, Newport News\n\nThank you so much [for the Oyster Pointer M&M’s, as winner of the Pearl Contest]. I have plastered my winning all over Facebook and have gotten so many congratulations. I read Oyster Pointer from cover to cover. Keep up the good work.\n\nBetty Bailey, Newport News\n\nThank you for the opportunity to be highlighted in the Point Blank section of the July/August issue of Oyster Pointer. I was so thrilled with the way the feature turned out! I think I have sent the link to everyone I know!\n\nLaney Morewitz, REALTOR®, Team Titan Real Estate | RE/MAX Peninsula\n\nWhat a wonderful surprise I received in the mail yesterday! A copy of Oyster Pointer arrived. I always enjoy your publication and read it whenever I see a copy in some building lobby. Thank you for the copy I received.\n\nLona Ross, Newport News\n\nAlzheimer’s Association is offering on-going, virtual caregiver support groups and education programs at www.alz.org/crf for those in need of our services. For additional information, contact me at 757-793-5077 or bgmonteith@alz.org.\n\nBarbara Monteith, Development Manager\n\nAlzheimer’s Association\n\nI read “A Gift For Mom,” Buddy Alligood’s column in the May/June issue of Oyster Pointer. This is a marvelous story and I loved it! It is great that Buddy has this wonderful memory with his family.\n\nTina Vick, Vice Mayor\n\nCity of Newport News\n\nWe received our copy of the May/June Oyster Pointer in the mail. Thank you and team for all of your dedication and hard work.\n\nJessena Robinson, Newport News\n\nYou have a very loyal readership and an incredible staff who are loyal as well and very talented regarding their journalistic skills. Oyster Pointer is a part of our daily lives. It keeps us informed on new businesses in the area as well as old businesses, and it allows all of us a sneak peek into the many wonderful businesses that serve the area. Thank you so much for your leadership and your commitment to keeping us all informed about Virginia Peninsula news.\n\nEd Olshansky, Newport News\n\nVirginia Technical Academy (VTA) truly appreciated finding our story on the cover page of the May/June issue of Oyster Pointer. Thank you! Like Oyster Pointer’s adapting to the pandemic, VTA did likewise. We hope Oyster Pointer readers will seek our website for the most up-to-date information about those changes, including the introduction of some online course instruction. Oyster Pointer will continue to be an Oyster Point treasure — dare I say the pearl of Oyster Point?\n\nDavid Gillespie, President/Founder\n\nVirginia Technical Academy\n\nWords are inadequate to thank you for the blessing of seeing our practice featured on the cover of the March issue. Although I’ve been featured many times over the years in professional publications, I have never been so proud and touched by any feature as I was yours. Beautifully written by Karen Eure Wilson — truly inspired. For the first time, I feel “captured” in my heart and soul. I’ve forever been a fan of Oyster Pointer and the brilliant portrayals and guest contributions that have been featured over the years. You have brought us together and kept a community in touch. You have reached well beyond the borders of Oyster Point and offered inclusive coverage of neighboring areas, bringing us a sense of connection that is increasingly hard to find in our busy digital world. I love you, Oyster Pointer! You’re a priceless treasure. You’re not only relevant; you’re indispensable to our sense of community!\n\nLisa Marie Samaha, DDS\n\nPort Warwick Dental Arts\n\nThank you for your feature in the Oyster Pointer March publication “Meet the Design Team: Sara and Stewart Sanders.” I have enjoyed working with Sara for years on my “Travelwise” columns, and it is nice to now put a “face with a name”!\n\nNancy B.

Back, Newport News\n\nThank you for the wonderful opportunity to be included in the January Oyster Pointer. We have heard great feedback about the Virginia Center for Inclusive Communities feature. I appreciate your service to the community and hope to see you soon to thank you in person.\n\nJonathan Zur, Executive Director\n\nVirginia Center for Inclusive Communities\n\nThank you for featuring the MLK Food Drive and Day of Service on the cover of the January Oyster Pointer. This exposure helped to bring in the equivalent of approximately 23,000 meals and more than 200 volunteers to the Foodbank on that day alone. In addition, we have received phone calls inquiring about volunteer opportunities year around as a direct result of this story. The feature on our Food Pharmacy at Sentara CarePlex was an added surprise for us! We are proud of our partnership with Sentara to assist those with congestive heart failure in learning to eat more nutritiously in order to improve their health and lessen their chances of hospital readmission. Food is medicine.\n\nKaren Joyner, Chief Executive Officer\n\nVirginia Peninsula Foodbank\n\nI just saw the February Oyster Pointer. Thank you for reaching out to me for the fun “bio” for the Point Blank feature. It looks great!\n\nRobbie Walker,\n\nPresident Certified Marine Chemist (CMC)\n\nMarine Chemist Service, Inc.\n\nThank you so much for Allan Hanrahan’s awesome article in your November issue! “Charting Smithfield’s Art Pathway” covers all of the gala art venues in the Smithfield area.

This opportunity will help to build our brand locally, as we are exposed even more to the community. Thank you again.\n\nDarlene D. M. Walker, President, BCDI – Hampton Roads Affiliate\n\nNational Black Child Development Institute\n\nWe were delighted to have been featured in the June issue of Oyster Pointer and look forward to welcoming old and new friends to Charlotte’s Cafe.

We are grateful for the exposure, and Karen Eure Wilson did a wonderful job of sharing our story and capturing the significant impact that our Clubs have on our kids and teens. BGCVP has much to offer our area’s youth, and we encourage people to visit our website, ww.bagclub.com, for more information. We couldn’t help as many kids as we do without the support of our local business community.\n\nMichele E. Benson, CFRE, Chief Development Officer, Boys & Girls, Clubs of the Virginia Peninsula\n\nBrian Cole’s column in the April issue (Viewpoint) was a beautifully written and loving glimpse into his relationship with his horse, Major. Loved reading it and feeling it.\n\nChris Chance, Newport News\n\nJust read the beautiful and moving April Viewpoint column written by Brian Cole about his relationship with his horse. I felt the love between man and horse. We humans should treat the animals that become part of our family with love and kindness. It is obvious that Brian does. Thank you for sharing\n\nBrenda Epps, Newport News\n\nLoved reading about your birthday trip in Musings in the April issue. Like you, I love being surrounded by books. When I began using my Nook I thought I would have trouble switching over, but now 1,800 books later I am able to keep all I love. When I’m old and broke I’ll have a new library as I won’t be able to remember them!\n\nSharyn Fox, Newport News\n\nThank you for featuring Dynamic Transition in the April issue. We enjoyed reading it. However please note these corrections: The headline should have read “Dynamic Transition: Providing in-home functional movement programs for seniors and the chronically ill.”\n\nOur phone number should be 757-642-8001. Michael is our founder and the functional movement specialist and I am co-founder and business manager. We appreciate your reaching out to us.\n\nAnna Glider, Michael Hildebrand, Dynamic Transition\n\nJust picked up the March Oyster Pointer. The cover article [H. Bobby Garofalis, DDS] was especially interesting to us because we only knew of Dr. Bobby as the director of the Greek youth dancing. We also know of Gus’s Hotdogs but had no idea who filled the Cheese Whiz bottles. Quite an interesting guy. Thank you!\n\nBill and Jimmie Espich, Newport News\n\nA friend sent a message to me here in Florida a couple days ago referencing your February Musings column in Oyster Pointer. She proceeded to tell me about your memories of seeing “Jeff and Bonnie” not once, but twice in Key West years ago. I went on the Internet and read the column and smiled! As they say, “Thanks for the memories!”\n\nJeff Spigel, Jupiter, Florida\n\nThank you for all that you do at Oyster Pointer.

Blessings to you and the entire Oyster Pointer team.\n\nLisa Marie Samaha, DDS\n\nPort Warwick Dental Arts\n\nYou and your husband must have a birthday every month instead of every year. A report on the trips is in almost every issue of the Oyster Pointer.\n\nRandy Simmons\n\nEditor’s note: Thanks for reading Oyster Pointer! Actually, our trips span 26 years, with two birthday trips and one anniversary trip each year. Some of our trips dip way, way back but are such fond and fun memories that we love sharing them with our readers!\n\nThank you to Oyster Pointer and Karen Eure Wilson for allowing me the opportunity in the October issue to share my personal story expressing the pride and passion I feel in serving the citizens of our city.

Congratulations on the great work you do. Oyster Pointer looks terrific.\n\nDon Cuthrell, Williamsburg\n\nThank you so much for the amazing article about Hip+Innovative Studio Boutique published in the March issue. Terilyn Goins did a great job listening and understanding what we are all about. So many great outreach opportunities that are happening, and Hip has really grown and become a great place for people to gather and create—my vision! Sentara has reached out to us and is sponsoring our First Friday events as well as some upcoming Be Well series, where we focus on the wellness of women in our community.\n\nWe have another Night Market: Artists Against Trafficking to raise funds for “Restoring Hope,” a shelter being created for Trafficked individuals in our area.

My wish for you is that you have 30 more successful years, and if you decide to retire before reaching 60 years of dedicated service to our community as Oyster Pointer editor, I hope that if you sell it that it will go into the hands of someone who is as capable as you and who cares about this community as much as you do. I am proud to know you and call you my friend.\n\nEd Olshansky\n\nNewport News\n\nThank you for the article in the Oyster Pointer for October. It was great and congratulations on 30 years!
