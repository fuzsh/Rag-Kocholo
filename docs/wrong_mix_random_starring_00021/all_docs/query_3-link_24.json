Stennis (CVN-74) will run about 14 months longer than expected. The delay for Stennis, which started its RCOH in 2021, is due to both growth work in the availability related to ship’s propulsion systems and the ongoing delays that plagued USS George Washington (CVN-73). The RCOH for GW faced both supply issues and workforce shortages that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated.\n\nGW was at Newport News for nearly six year for its RCOH, which saw sailors facing some of the toughest living conditions in the armed services, concluded a 2023 Navy investigation performed after several GW sailors died by suicide.\n\nProgram executive officer for carriers Rear. Adm. Casey Moton recently told USNI News that the Navy has made several changes to improve sailors’ quality of life during the RCOH for Stennis. One of those changes is creating new habitability standards that the ship must achieve before sailors can move back aboard."
