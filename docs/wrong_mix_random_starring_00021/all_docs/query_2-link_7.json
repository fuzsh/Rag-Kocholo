        "text": "Newport Beach the perfect setting for an international film festival.\n\nIt's gorgeous isn't it How beautiful the boats.\n\nEach year, the Newport Beach Film Festival draws filmmakers and film lovers alike from around the world to share, enjoy and discover the power of movies.\n\nIf you want to be soaked in great cinema.\n\nNewport Beach, that'’s where you go.\n\nIt is beautiful here.\n\nAnd as part of the festival, the prestigious Newport Beach Film Festival Honors Awards at the picturesque Balboa Bay Resort.\n\nWe'’re surrounded by yachts and Ron Howard.\n\nI mean, you can'’t get any better than that.\n\nA chance to get to know those who have dedicated their talents for years.\n\nIt'’s a long way from Mayberry.\n\nAnd those on the brink of new discoveries.\n\nI am thrilled to be here today at the Newport Beach Film Festival This place rocks.\n\nWelcome to the Newport Beach Film Festival Honors.\n\nNewport Beach is one of those film festivals that clearly is run by film nerds and film lovers.\n\nIt'’s more about celebrating the risk takers.\n\nAnd I love that that'’s what their focus is.\n\nIt'’s such a fantastic festival to even have your film as part of it.\n\nI mean, there'’s just so many incredible people here and.\n\nIncredible artists, and.\n\nI feel just so lucky to be in this environment.\n\nThe road to creating a life in the film industry rarely follows a direct course.\n\nBeing chosen one of Variety'’s ten actors to watch is an exciting step.\n\nVariety is so thrilled to be presenting the ten actors to watch.\n\nI am actually so excited about this class as both a journalist and a fan of them before I introduce each one and bring them up here.\n\nWhy don'’t we take a look at some of their work?\n\nDoable.\n\nDeadly.\n\nFor reliable.\n\nHear me now.\n\nThere will be no more retreating.\n\nFrom Eddie the Banished.\n\nPeople love that world and the characters, the inhabitants.\n\nAnd I think the fact that the fans were able to find room in their hearts for this new character and have responded so well to him and it'’s not like never anticipated that it'’s mad.\n\nI don'’t think I wanted to be an actor, like when I was very young.\n\nI had I did a version of a play called Antigone at School.\n\nI was about 17 and I thought that felt good.\n\nYou know.\n\nWhat kind of school is doing Antigone at 17.\n\nOh, you'’re British.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat explains it.\n\nSo why do you just ignore everything else?\n\nYou could be anything anywhere.\n\nWhy not go somewhere where you'’re.\n\nOr your daughter is more than just.\n\nThis.\n\nI told my mom I was like, I think I want to be an actor or I want to tell stories.\n\nAnd she pointed at the TV screen and she'’s like, How can you possibly be an actor?\n\nThere'’s nobody who looks like you.\n\nPeople just kept opening doors for me that I didn'’t know existed all the way up until really this point.\n\nAnd I feel really lucky that I have somehow found myself as one of the people who gets to do it.\n\nI'’m getting to be the person that I didn'’t get to see when I was younger and all the thoughts that I had of.\n\nThey'’ll never have a character that is, you know, Chinese and in a period piece.\n\nI'’m getting to open that door up for other people so that they never have to think that thought again.\n\nAnd it'’s been wild that I'’m getting the opportunity to open that space up for other people.\n\nI want to be with the others.\n\nI want to fight for my king Your tears mean nothing.\n\nTo be a warrior.\n\nYou must kill your tears.\n\nIt really is a what moment, you know, because you don'’t expect it.\n\nI'’m in a space where it'’s like, you know, I still have to work really hard, you know, pay my dues, earn my spot in Hollywood.\n\nAnd to have it be part of a project that I was really passionate about makes really happy.\n\nIt'’s humbling.\n\nIt really is.\n\nThere'’s kind of always been two parts of me in pursuing my career, and there'’s one side that'’s always felt limitless, and then there'’s one side that'’s felt like there'’s nobody that I can really look to who'’s gone where I want to go, who, like looks like me comes from places like me or shares my culture or anything like that.\n\nSo looking at like why nobody else from my people has done what I want to do, and then like overcoming that to hopefully open up more space.\n\nAnd it makes me want to do that for them.\n\nI think one of the most important elements of, you know, anything to me is the cultural aspect.\n\nAnd obviously with this movie that was a big focus and I'’m really proud of what it has done and what it has shown.\n\nYou know, Native people are the hero of a story and we get to have so many different kinds of dimensions throughout a number of people, something we never really had before and was like, just a gift It'’s life.\n\nIt'’s weighing me down.\n\nWhat is it about life that isn'’t working for you?\n\nI don'’t know.\n\nI want something to change, but I don'’t know what in terms of advice I'’ve been given.\n\nI think I'’d have to say my mum, hi mum.\n\nShe'’s sort of been my drama school in a sense that she'’s help me harness my empathy and use that to use that to act essentially.\n\nBecause if you'’re feeling it genuinely on the inside, you don'’t really need to think about what your body is doing, what your face is doing.\n\nLike that stuff sort of falls out of you naturally.\n\nUm, yeah.\n\nSo I'’d say, Thanks, Mom.\n\nThank you so much for being here.\n\nVariety'’s 2022 10 Actors to Watch Every year you see the list and every year you watch.\n\nAnd it'’s such a great tool to be aware of like other artists and what people are doing and then to find yourself in that position.\n\nIt just it changes the dynamic of how you think about it.\n\nAnd it'’s just so exciting.\n\nI was very shocked and very flattered.\n\nI think when you look at some of the people that have been on of this before, it seems pretty esteemed company.\n\nSo it'’s a it'’s it'’s a lovely feeling.\n\nIt'’s a mark of something I'’m doing is right, I guess, which I'’m really happy about the recognition.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt, it sort of confirms that this is something I can actually might be able to do and might be able to continue with and something I can be proud of.\n\nHonestly, this year is insane.\n\nAll of our ten actors to watch, you'’re going to be hearing so much from them.\n\nI really believe they'’re going to be inspiring the next generation of actors.\n\nAnd while we look forward to what'’s to come, we also honor those who have been dedicated to their craft for years.\n\nAnd our first artist of distinction goes to the wonderful Keke Palmer.\n\nIt's in the cloud O.J.\n\nIt's in the cloud na na na , run OJ , run To get any award is always something I'’m grateful for.\n\nBut I think specifically when you think about the Distinction award and what it stands for in terms of community, that'’s why I became an actress.\n\nYou know, both of my parents were theater actors and they always told me that, you know, you use your talents for more than just yourself.\n\nAnd so for me, that'’s what I'’ve always tried to do with my work, is to stand for something and to represent something that'’s true to me and my community.\n\nSo I thank you guys for acknowledging that.\n\nAnd thank you so much.\n\nYou know, I'’m so happy to be recognized in this way.\n\nI think for me, growing up in the entertainment industry, it'’s always been about community and using my art to tell a bigger story or represent a bigger theme.\n\nSo to be acknowledged for that, it makes me feel like I made my parents proud.\n\nReceiving the Breakout Performance Award.\n\nAmee Carrero How is it?\n\nHmm?\n\nIt'’s good.\n\nYou can'’t just say good for the show.\n\nYou have to.\n\nYou have to embellish.\n\nOh, my God.\n\nFor crying out loud is not brain surgery.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nTravel, food show.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo pitch it to me.\n\nI haven'’t ever really won anything in my life before except for, like, some superlatives in high school.\n\nSo this is really lovely.\n\nAnd, you know, if I was in it for the awards out to quit a long time ago.\n\nBut it'’s just the cherry on top of a lovely experience.\n\nOur next award goes to a man of many talents.\n\nWe are truly honored to present the Spotlight Award to Colson Baker.\n\nI was waiting in the car.\n\nAnd I looked over and there was this caution tape around this house, a giant black palm tree over it.\n\nIt'’s like.\n\nDrawing me to it.\n\nBut I needed to know something that was going on inside.\n\nSo.\n\nI went inside.\n\nI saw where .\n\nThey were killed.\n\nThis movie is really close to me.\n\nIt'’s about the last week that a musician is alive and he'’s just trying to just trying to find the good in himself.\n\nAnd that'’s kind of how I feel a lot of the times.\n\nThis is my first film award I'’ve ever received.\n\nThis lit my fire up.\n\nSometimes you can feel like it'’s dying down a little bit and you need a little gas to help you keep burning.\n\nSo this is like, this is a nice day to wake up.\n\nAnd I think as a musician, I was already playing a character unknowingly because I even, like, lost touch with my own name.\n\nI hadn'’t heard my actual name Colson in eight years or something like that was a long time when I really dove into the character.\n\nMachine Gun Kelly.\n\nYou know, I think when I first started doing film, it almost got me back in touch with.\n\nMyself as Colson again Our next Spotlight award goes to Anna Diop.\n\nShould I feed her this?\n\nHmm.\n\nOr this or this since I'’ve started.\n\nI have been buying her food or making some of my own.\n\nDid you ever wonder how your child is eating?\n\nThank you for recognizing this performance.\n\nAnd I know this story means a lot to so many people, to immigrants, specifically to mothers, to those of us who live in places where there is very few opportunity and who make the very brave and courageous and difficult decision to move and to try and build a better life elsewhere.\n\nSo to all the mothers, to all the immigrants, to all the survivors, to all the women who are brave for something bigger than the world that they are surrounded by.\n\nAnd I thank you.\n\nAnd thank you for having me.\n\nWhat keeps me going really is the love that I have for the craft of acting.\n\nAnd sometimes you find roles that remind you of why you fell in love with it in the first place.\n\nNanny is exactly one of those roles, and so it'’s a difficult industry, but it'’s sprinkled with these moments of finding these characters in these roles and these filmmakers that remind you of why you'’re so in love with it.\n\nAnd that keeps me going.\n\nWe are thrilled and honored to present Patton Oswalt with the Artist of Distinction Award.\n\nSup So.\n\nSo how's How'’s it going?\n\nGood.\n\nThis is creepy.\n\nThis was your idea?\n\nIt was my ex girlfriend.\n\nThis is your child.\n\nI'’m very fortunate to get to play in both arenas.\n\nI get to write and perform my own stuff, and then I get to interpret someone else'’s more often on really brilliant, really heartfelt writing.\n\nI don'’t want to give either one of those up.\n\nSo they both have equal value to me.\n\nI'’ve been extremely fortunate to get to be in the kind of movies that I, as a film buff and film devourer, like to watch.\n\nI'’m always drawn to the stuff that'’s on the edge or is at least rolling the dice after putting every chip on one number.\n\nSo it'’s amazing to get honored for for those kinds of choices.\n\nStarting at the Improv at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, Aubrey Plaza starred for six years on NBC'’s hit show Parks and Recreation, and Emily the Criminal, recently released to rave reviews.\n\nWhat I don'’t understand is how you feel so comfortable asking someone to work without pay.\n\nYou know, when I was your age, they told me all I could be was a secretary.\n\nOkay, but secretaries get paid.\n\nThat'’s not the point.\n\nWell, when you were my age, did you have $60,000 in debt?\n\nHow about this?\n\nWhen I was your age, I was the only woman in a room full of men.\n\nLet me be frank with you.\n\nYou don'’t belong here because you think everyone is out to get you.\n\nNone of us are out to get you.\n\nEspecially me.\n\nI'’m trying to help.\n\nThis was fantastic.\n\nLiz.\n\nThanks very much.\n\nThank you.\n\nNo more talking.\n\nJust leave.\n\nThank you.\n\nSo you want to tell me what to do?\n\nPut me on the payroll.\n\nHow about that?\n\nWhat this award really means to me is just how special it is when an independent film can kind of break through the noise and people see it.\n\nIt'’s a really small film.\n\nEmily the Criminal.\n\nIt'’s a labor of love, as most movies are, and I'’m just so proud of it.\n\nAnd I'’m so.\n\nAny time an independent film, you know, has a chance.\n\nGets to the theaters, gets an audience.\n\nIt means everything to me.\n\nIndependent films mean everything to me.\n\nSo thank you.\n\nIt'’s hard for me to have perspective on myself, you know, fully.\n\nBut I have glimpses of it where I feel like, oh, you know, this this stuff is kind of it'’s seeping through.\n\nYou know, people are paying attention, which is so cool.\n\nAnd I love that.\n\nI'’m up here with the absolute pleasure and honor of awarding my brother with the Artist of Distinction Award.\n\nThe swim test and Flight school.\n\nThey made me do it ten times.\n\nthey dumped ice in the water.\n\nPut weights on my flight suit.\n\nBut every time I made it out, can'’t tell you how many times people have told me to give up quit That'’s why you can'’t always do what you'’re told.\n\nIf I did, I wouldn'’t be here.\n\nDoesn'’t seem right, does it?\n\nHere's a boy from Texas who worked really hard to not get in trouble and still got in trouble.\n\nWho tried very hard to, you know, not stand out and kind of kept to myself.\n\nAnd and I thank you and I'’m going to keep doing what I'’m doing and try to stay out of trouble and, you know, bless you all and I'’ll see you down the road again.\n\nWhen theater came to me, I was in a place where I had a great deal of energy, a great deal of chaos.\n\nI had a great deal of aggression and no place to put it.\n\nBut work is what allows me to.\n\nBalance those things.\n\nOur next honoree, Cooper Raiff, is the recipient of our Maverick Award for his remarkable work with Cha Cha.\n\nReal smooth.\n\nDo you like spending time with me like this?\n\nI feel like it'’s taking a lot out of you.\n\nBut I want you to know that I can just sit here and, like, not talk.\n\nI can chill.\n\nI can be a chiller.\n\nI feel like I'’m talking a lot.\n\nWhen I found out I was getting this award, I was really excited cause I'’m from Dallas and I'’m a big Dallas Mavericks fan.\n\nBut then I looked it up and I saw to do things in a small, different way is is to be a maverick.\n\nAnd I wish that more people would want to do that.\n\nAnd I think you can.\n\nBut thank you so much for the award and let'’s make some movies.\n\nOkay?\n\nThank you.\n\nI want to keep trying to make things for as small as they want and can be.\n\nBut I want to always be thinking big, but be economical with not wasting resources.\n\nAnd that'’s what I'’ve done with my first two movies, and I want to continue to do that.\n\nI like the independent space and I like being a maverick.\n\nYes.\n\nNow to present our Variety Legends and Groundbreaker Award to the.\n\nIconic Ron Howard.\n\nAndy Griffith tells me that he remembers that.\n\nMy pat answer to What do you want to do when you grow up?\n\nAlways was.\n\nI want to be an actor, writer, producer, director, cameraman.\n\nBaseball player.\n\nIt'’s a little intimidating.\n\nThis award, the legend thing, and it probably just goes with the gray in the beard.\n\nI can buy that.\n\nThe ground breaking aspect is something that means a great deal to me, because even as someone who has primarily worked within the system over the course of my career, I'’ve still tried to to bring something creatively ambitious to the process, project after project.\n\nAnd the one thing that I'’ve found through it all is it doesn'’t matter the tone, it doesn'’t matter the genre.\n\nNothing can entertain if it doesn'’t have a thematic value, something for the audience to take away, even if it'’s laughing, even if it'’s escapism, it'’s not going to work.\n\nIf if it doesn'’t register and mean something and help guide us as to, you know, how we might move forward.\n\nAnd so I love being a part of that process, and I'’m very excited about the future, thanks to everything I'’m seeing today.\n\nAnd thank you for this honor.\n\nAppreciate it.\n\nThank you.\n\nJuggling busy schedules.\n\nTwo honorees who have made an immense impact over many years accepted their awards on a different day.\n\nOn behalf of the Newport Beach Film Festival, we would like to present the 2022 Icon Award to Eddie Redmayne.\n\nWhat do you need me to do?\n\nTell the truth.\n\nI just did it.\n\nThank you.\n\nTo the Newport Beach Film Festival.\n\nI'’ve heard about this festival.\n\nIt is renowned, and I know that you have a litany of extraordinary people that honored I feel thrilled to be amongst that list.\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nparticularly as an actor which is such a competitive industry.\n\nWhen you'’re starting out, it'’s it'’s know there'’s so many people who want to be actors and there'’s so few jobs and it'’s ferocious that that'’s staying in your lane and just focusing on putting one foot in front of the other was a very important thing.\n\nOn behalf of the Newport Beach Film Festival.\n\nOur board of directors and our staff.\n\nWe'’d like to present.\n\nYou with our career achievement award.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nI knew early on.\n\nI just wanted to be very dedicated in my career and I love to work and it'’s just what drives me.\n\nI love it and I'’ve been very fortunate to work with a lot of amazing people and just kind of get to bask in in the glow of their talent.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nNo matter how specific your own story is, you find that there are certain things that are just universal.\n\nAnd I think that happens a lot with actors, like thinking about what'’s next and how to make the best decision possible.\n\nI look for collaboration with artists and filmmakers that are telling an original story, something we haven'’t heard before.\n\nRoles that excite me, whether it'’s because it'’s a role I'’ve not played before or because the dialog and the writing and the story is so engaging.\n\nStories that are excelling us and not taking us back.\n\nI'’m always looking for what elevates the entertaining beats that you can present to an audience so that there'’s a knee jerk reaction, emotion, fear, laughter, whatever that might be, suspense driven by something that really is personal for an audience that they can connect to on a on a human level.\n\nMovies have a kind of soul to them, and I think of it as a spiritual exercise.\n\nI have to have an instinct.\n\nIt'’s something that you literally feel when you'’re reading a script.\n\nIf you don'’t have that initial, initial gut response, tend not to work.\n\nSo I think let'’s start with a good story.\n\nWe just need a good solid story that will have a positive impact on society.\n\nAnd then obviously, character.\n\nCharacter development.\n\nI feel like I need to be challenged at all times because with challenges come growth.\n\nAnd you always have to kind of as an artist, just be open to the world around you and just be ready to receive whatever thoughts are out there, because they do weirdly kind of gel, you know, and just present themselves in odd way.\n\nThe story your body tells yourself is spectacular.\n\nIt'’s a journey, you know?\n\nOtherwise you just you can phone it in and hang it up.\n\nI think.\n\nI would always rather go for the project that shoots high and misses than something that'’s like, Yeah, this is fine.\n\nThis is fine.\n\nTends to get forgotten.\n\nBut the shooting high and either missing or nailing it is what gets remembered.\n\nI'’m still kind of adjusting to this idea, this notion that I might have a one iota of choice about the stuff that I do now.\n\nSo I think you just get a feeling, you know, you get a feeling.\n\nIt'’s it'’s just an instinct that this is this might be the one.\n\nAnd with that choice, perhaps an opportunity to make a difference.\n\nYou know what?\n\nI think the next challenge, next evolution is me being someone that can give what I was given from my parents or even from people like Queen Latifah, who'’ve supported me throughout my career and give me opportunities that I didn'’t even know were coming.\n\nI want to be able to do that, leverage my experience and give to others.\n\nYou know, I have dream roles that I get laughed at when I say, Oh, I want to play this character or I want to work with this director.\n\nAnd I turn the frustration into inspiration and I won'’t stop until I am one of the leading faces in this industry.\n\nI believe every character, every exchange offers a healing.\n\nThe hero or the heroine is he or she who allows their heart to break.\n\nI mean, that'’s my mom.\n\nShe was my hero.\n\nAnd as I grew up and as I became a father, I then understood heartbreak in a different way.\n\nThe thing that I love and that I dream of for the world or that I want to put out is being received.\n\nSo it'’s been very encouraging and affirming that art still matters and is powerful, and that even in a world that is so saturated with ideas that we still have space to be surprised and like believe in one another.\n\nThat'’s crazy.\n\nNewcomer or seasoned.. Maverick or legend?\n\nThis is the remarkable talent at the 23rd annual Newport Beach Film Festival HONORS It'’s been tons of fun with amazingly talented people.\n\nWe love Newport.\n\nThey'’re having so much fun.\n\nOh.\n\nOh, we love you.\n\nThey were like, We are not going to not be noticed.\n\nI got to chase that thing of French fries over there and look really good.\n\nI love the Newport Beach Film Festival because that'’s where I am in this very moment.\n\nAnd I know where I am."
