This year, 92 programs were profiled and the list was shared with journalists, school board members, superintendents, legislators, and top state officials. Press coverage was generated statewide, and this project served to be an effective tool for disarming the critics of public education. The below directory of 92 programs from 43 school divisions across the Commonwealth will be featured for the next year.\n\nWHO DO I CONTACT IF I HAVE A QUESTION?\n\ncommunications@vsba.org or 434-295-8722\n\nClick Here to View the 2024 Special Edition Newsletter\n\n2024 Showcases for Success\n\nAlexandria City Public Schools: You’re Speaking My Language: ACPS’ Culturally Responsive Approach to Substance Abuse Prevention\n\nA division-wide substance abuse prevention engagement campaign designed for its socio-economically challenged and culturally diverse division to include opioid overdoses, especially fentanyl, that have surged nationwide.

STEAM is the culmination of various subjects, and STEAM in FCCPS focuses on problem solving scenarios, engineering design processes, and students demonstrating how to collect data, collaborate, and innovate with provided resources. It is important to expose students to all aspects of STEAM by implementing cross-curricula activities that are in line with grade level IB unit planners. To better prepare our next generation workforce, it is important that projects not only infuse the concept of STEAM habits of mind—problem solving skills that define success—but also align with horizontal and vertical curriculum. In 2018, Oak Street Elementary redesigned their annual STEAM night to provide students with more agency in their learning. STEAM night allows students to become the teacher and learn about STEAM concepts that are then presented to the attending community. These STEAM night ambassadors use time during their STEAM class to design and prepare exciting and engaging activities that tie into standards and unit planners. Over the years, the program has grown to over one thousand attendees and every year younger students look forward to becoming ambassadors.Now that the framework for STEAM night has been developed at Oak Street, over the next few years, the evolution of the program is to take the framework and have the older students partner with the younger. This puts the responsibility of learning on the students and further empowers them. The beauty of STEAM is that it looks different across schools, buildings, and communities. We in FCCPS are honored to share our innovative success with the world, because of course WE are IB learners!\n\nContact information: Tosin Adetoro, adetorot@fccps.org, 703-248-5561\n\nFalls Church City Public Schools: GIVE Day – “Get Involved, Value Everyone” – Service Learning Program\n\nGIVE Day stands for Get Involved, Value Everyone and is a division-wide service learning effort to help the local community.

After completing a successful experience at Carysbrook, Ms. McCormack then helped to create a similar program at each of our other schools.\n\nThe goal is to support students who struggle in one or more of the following areas:\n\n1. Meeting behavioral expectations\n\n2. Regulating their emotional responses\n\n3. Social interactions with peers and/or adults\n\n4. Other areas of Executive functioning such as planning and organizing, task initiation, working memory, and self-monitoring\n\nThe BEST Lab aims to help these students learn the skills they need in order to be successful in all school environments. Students may participate in group activities, receive 1:1 support, complete educational tasks to increase their knowledge with a variety of social/emotional concepts, engage in problem solving in order to navigate complicated situations, or develop and use a self regulation routine. Each BEST Lab is staffed by an instructional assistant who is trained by Mrs. McCormack.\n\nContact information: Jennifer Valentine, jvalentine@apps.fluco.org, 434 589-8208 ext. 1318\n\nFluvanna County Public Schools: REST Lab for Staff\n\nCentral Elementary REST Lab\n\nWith the success of the Behavioral Educational Social-Emotional Teaching (BEST) Labs for students at Central Elementary School, teachers often joked that they needed an adult BEST Lab. Principal Amy Barnabei, who always works to take great care of her students and staff, came up with the idea to do just that. She created a space and called it the Recharging Educators Social-Emotional Therapy Time (REST) Lab for staff. This was done as a way to support teachers to give them their own space to decompress and to get away even just for a small amount of time. She worked with her PTO to turn a work room into a relaxing spa-like space for teachers to use as a way to take a break and recharge. It has been a great way for staff to recharge!\n\nContact information: Jennifer Valentine, jvalentine@apps.fluco.org, 434 589-8208 ext. 1318\n\nFrederick County Public Schools: FCPS Transition Day\n\nFrederick County Public Schools proudly introduced its inaugural Transition Day for the 2023-24 school year. This special day, designed for preschool, kindergarten, sixth-grade, and ninth-grade students, was a non-instructional day that fostered a sense of community. It allowed students to meet and connect with their peers and teachers while learning to navigate their new school environment. The overwhelmingly positive feedback from students, parents, teachers, administrators, bus drivers, and other stakeholders underscores the success of this initiative.

They are introduced to the college preparation and application process and learn how to use resources at school. The program is based on a bilingual novel which is read together in class. The novel is about a young girl of immigrant parents who wishes to go to college. Families read about her journey of convincing her parents of the importance of continuing her education when they would prefer that she work to help support the family. They also read about the various resources available and the process of applying for admission to and financial aid for college. Families also have the opportunity to improve their English skills and work on new vocabulary in each class. Families have reported that they feel better prepared to help their children with the college application process, how to apply for financial aid, and they have a better understanding of the importance of education in the United States.\n\nContact information: Elizabeth Stringer-Nunley, elizabethstringer@galaxschools.us, 276-236-2991 ext. 301\n\nGalax City Public Schools: Family Literacy Program for Early Literacy\n\nSpanish-speaking families of K-2 students are invited to participate in a 6-week program in which they learn how to read to their children to promote an early love of books and reading. Each week, families receive two bilingual books that reflect the experiences of Latino families. A facilitator models how to read the books in both languages, then the families take the books home to read with their children. When they return the next week, they discuss how the reading went at home. In addition, the family creates a family album in which they write about their own family experiences and photos. They can write and later read their own stories with their children. Families have stated that this program has shown them the importance of reading to their young children. Some have also said that the books they received in the class were the first books they ever had in their homes.\n\nContact information: Elizabeth Stringer-Nunley, elizabethstringer@galaxschools.us, 276-236-2991 ext. 301\n\nGalax City Public Schools: Mentoring Program with Virginia Tech\n\nWith our high number of unaccompanied minors and newcomer English Learner students, many of whom are enrolling at 17 years old with no transfer credits, it has been a struggle to keep them in school. We partnered with Virginia Tech to create a mentoring program for these students at risk of dropping out of school. Spanish-speaking students from Galax High are paired with Spanish-speaking college students from Virginia Tech. The purpose of the program is to offer the high school students a vision beyond the small, rural life in Galax. Many only see a future in construction or fruit packing, but through their conversations and activities with the VT students who come from the same countries, speak the same language, and have the same backgrounds as them, they are able to envision different futures for themselves after high school graduation. The program meets in-person once a month on VT campus, and via Zoom weekly. At the kick-off meeting, one of the students said, “Look! They look like us!” This program has made such a difference by offering some of our most isolated students the chance to have an encourager outside of the high school.\n\nContact information: Elizabeth Stringer-Nunley, elizabethstringer@galaxschools.us, 276-236-2991 ext. 301\n\nGreene County Public Schools: One School One Book\n\nThe elementary schools in Greene County constantly strive to engage and include parents. The One School One Book program provides us with this opportunity. Ten years ago Nathanael Greene decided to implement a One School, One Book Program. The program was so well received, it has been kept in place and expanded to Ruckersville. Our original purpose was to engage students and their families in the process of reading. When families read together there are observable results. Academically, students who are read to develop larger vocabularies, listen more attentively, and develop positive attitudes towards books and learning. With competing outside activities, many families have difficulty finding ways to spend quality time with their children. Since the One School, One Book Program occurs at home, and is assigned by the school, this “Forced Family Fun,” helps families include a time for reading in their nightly routine.\n\nContact information: Tina Arritt, tarritt@greenecountyschools.com, 434-939-9002\n\nGreene County Public Schools: Career Strategies\n\nThe Career Strategies course at William Monroe High School is an essential component of ninth grade students’ educational journey.

The purpose in setting up this initiative was to consistently improve student attendance, to have them achieve at the highest academic levels, and to have them learn to regulate their emotions. Much of our time over the past few years has been focused on SEL needs. This work needs to continue but a stronger focus on academic achievement and family engagement will be ongoing throughout the year. Each student /family will have differentiated needs so each family goal will be unique. The main purpose of this project is to strengthen the school-community relationship for maximum buy-in with all stakeholders which will lead to improved attendance and student performance.\n\nContact information: Adam Midock, amidock@greenecountyschools.com, 434-939-9001\n\nHampton City Schools: Learn to Swim\n\nFor the second year in a row, Hampton City Schools, in collaboration with the city of Hampton, offers the Learn to Swim program to all second-grade students.

ACTW is a key strategic priority and investment that we are using in Manassas City to drive positive change in our instructional practices and student learning outcomes.\n\nContact information: Ed Stephenson, estephenson@mcpsva.org, 571-377-6010\n\nManassas Park City Schools: Manassas Park City Schools Teacher Leader Academy\n\nThe Manassas Park City Schools Teacher Leader Academy brings together secondary teacher leads (department chairs, team lead, etc.) and the division’s Instructional Team to meet monthly on a variety of topics. The goals of the program include developing teacher leader capacity to effectively lead teams of teachers to support student achievement, to build a collaborative community of leaders who can learn from and support one another in their leadership endeavors, and to provide meaningful professional development opportunities for teacher leaders around teaching and leading adults. Through their participation, these secondary teacher leaders have gained practical leadership skills that focus on communication, collaboration, problem-solving and learning how to motivate others to achieve shared goals. Teacher leaders receive personalized coaching and support and can expand their peer network. Monthly topics have included leading data discussions to improve student achievement, identifying team/department obstacles and planning on how to overcome them, improving teacher retention, and conducting peer learning walks.\n\nContact information: Pam Kalso, pam.kalso@mpark.net, 703-335-8850\n\nNewport News Public Schools: Early Career\n\nHigh school seniors in Newport News Public Schools can jump start their careers before graduation. The Early Career Program is a partnership between Newport News Public Schools and Virginia Peninsula Community College. The program is designed for high school seniors to pursue certifications that will open employment opportunities in the skilled trades industry immediately following graduation. During the first semester of their senior year, students complete their high school coursework. Students then take special, hands-on welding training courses from some of the region’s best welding instructors. Each of the welding courses build upon one another. Successful completion of the prerequisite course is required prior to moving on in the sequence of certification opportunities. Students can obtain marketable credentials at a limited cost. Job placement support is provided throughout the program. During the second semester, students can begin working full time with a local business or industry partner.\n\nContact information: Kathy DiMarino, Kathy.Dimarino@nn.k12.va.us, (757) 283-7850 x.10325\n\nNewport News Public Schools: Youth Development Program\n\nThrough school leadership academies and participation in clubs and organizations, students in all grades have the opportunity to develop leadership skills, volunteerism and citizenship with Newport News Public Schools’ commitment to Positive Youth Development. The program has an infrastructure of dedicated school-based teams who increase the school division’s ability to implement evidenced-based programming at every school. The positive youth development initiatives build essential skills and empower students to lead, serve and contribute, beginning at pre-K and continuing through grade 12. Youth Development’s My Brother’s Keeper/My Sister’s Keeper and Level Up Programs, which benefit more than 500 students at 11 schools, emphasize mental health support, skill building and mentoring, and are facilitated by school-based site directors and dozens of community partners, including the Newport News Police Department, Department of Human Services, mental health service providers and several local non-profit agencies. Youth Development’s primary goals are promoting student success, student wellness, and creating productive collaborations with stakeholders to implement quality programming that promotes overall wellbeing for all students.\n\nContact information: Bridget Adams, Bridget.Adams@nn.k12.va.us, (757) 283-7850, ext. 10318\n\nPatrick County Public Schools: Cougar Pride – Remediation/Enrichment Time\n\nCougar PRIDE (Purposeful Remediation and Instructionally Driven Enrichment) is a transformative 40-minute daily session designed to address pandemic-induced learning gaps and facilitate a smooth transition into post-secondary endeavors. It provides essential time for remediation, studying, completing tasks, and enrichment by allowing students to pursue personal interests. Notably, it has improved academic performance through targeted support and enhanced test preparation opportunities. Moreover, it serves as a safety net for missed classes, helping students catch up with coursework. Beyond academics, Cougar PRIDE emphasizes student well-being, fosters holistic development, and improves student engagement by providing new learning opportunities to students that normally do not fit into their class schedule. This program empowers students to thrive in the evolving educational landscape, nurturing resilience and a lifelong passion for learning. In an uncertain world, Cougar PRIDE stands as a testament to the transformative power of focused support in shaping brighter futures.\n\nContact information: Hope Perry, hope.perry@patrick.k12.va.us, 276-694-7137\n\nPortsmouth Public Schools: STARBASE Victory\n\nSTARBASE Victory is a public-private partnership that provides Portsmouth Public Schools students with inquiry-based, hands-on STEM instruction in a dedicated space for STARBASE learning. With equity at the forefront, every 4-6 grade student in Portsmouth Public Schools spends one full week participating in the program which focuses on Environmental Science (EnviroBASE- grade 4), Medical Science (MedBASE- grade 5), and Aerospace Engineering (AeroBASE- grade 6). This is not a program that is application or selection-based. It is built into each student’s instructional schedule. Using a STEM to CTE approach, PPS will continue to expand the program into middle and high school over the next few years, connecting it to CTE and STEM pathways, as well as industry credential opportunities for students.\n\nContact information: Lauren Nolasco, lauren.nolasco@portsk12.com, 757-393-8743\n\nPortsmouth Public Schools: Graduate Profile\n\nPortsmouth Public Schools developed its own Graduate Profile, a listing of the desired skills and attributes all PPS students should have upon graduating from the division. This profile came to fruition after months of working with stakeholder groups, including students, teachers, administrators, and members of the community. A draft profile was posted online to gather additional feedback before it was finalized. It is now published on the division website, and posters of the graphic were created so that all schools could showcase the new profile.\n\nContact information: Lauren Nolasco, lauren.nolasco@portsk12.com, 757-393-8743\n\nPortsmouth Public Schools: Principal PLCs\n\nDuring the 23-24 school year, Portsmouth Public Schools has engaged all principals in collective inquiry and problem-solving through the use of professional learning communities. Using the widespread division issue of chronic absenteeism as the common challenge, PPS central leadership created principal PLC teams based on similar absenteeism data across schools. Principals engage in monthly PLC discussions and have collectively completed a root cause analysis, as well as developed strategic actions to use in their respective schools to address chronic absenteeism. Using PLCs as a vehicle to accomplish this work has also provided a model for how effective PLCs are structured and implemented so that principals know what to look for within their school’s teacher PLCs. Central leadership uses their engagement in PLCs as an opportunity to debrief with them on the PLC process and have them develop instructional leadership goals to strengthen teacher PLCs in their schools.\n\nContact information: Lauren Nolasco, lauren.nolasco@portsk12.com, 757-393-8743\n\nPrince Edward County Public Schools: Students Collect Canned Food & Volunteer at Local Food Pantry\n\nStudents from the elementary and middle school collected over 1,000 pounds of canned goods. They were donated to a local food pantry. In addition, some of our middle school students spent several hours volunteering at the pantry. Students helped sort, package, and weigh food to prepare it for distribution. When asked about the impact of the trip, one eighth-grade student replied, “I enjoyed sorting the produce and learning about this place. It’s nice to have something like this for people who need it. I want to come back!”\n\nContact information: Le’Tina Giles, Letina.giles@pecps.k12.va.us, 434-315-2150\n\nPrince Edward County Public Schools: Sandee Draper Express\n\nPrince Edward County High School recently re-started a coffee cart program named “The Sandee Draper Express.” The coffee cart was initiated at the high school by the late Sandee Draper, who served as the adaptive special education teacher and transition coordinator. The cart allows students in the adaptive class to engage in a real-world job experience, promoting career readiness skills. The express cart currently operates once a month, managed by students in the adaptive setting with the support of the adaptive special education teacher and instructional assistants. All students in the adaptive program participate. Staff members receive the express cart order form before the scheduled delivery date. The cart includes hot coffee, coffee condiments, and a variety of snacks that staff can select, each costing $1.00. The proceeds collected from the sales are deposited into an account created to replenish the cart’s supplies.\n\nContact information: Le’Tina Giles, Letina.giles@pecps.k12.va.us, 434-315-2150\n\nPrince George County Public Schools: Sports Management\n\nPrince George High School’s innovative sports marketing program has added Sports & Entertainment Management to its offerings, giving students hands-on experiences at event planning and execution, along with sports-focused digital content creation. The Sports Management course lies within the high school’s marketing cluster of Career and Technical Education (CTE) offerings, alongside fashion, social media, and sports marketing pathways and entrepreneurship. The aim of the Sports and Entertainment Management course, led by athletics coach and teacher Mr. Travis Carr, is to provide students with a practical understanding of the preparation, operation, and execution of game events, as well as coverage of high school teams and athletes. Through this course, students can gain hands-on experience in the sports management field, which can help in college preparation and employment opportunities. Alongside their in-classroom instruction from Mr. Carr, students dive deep into sports management through the use of the high school’s own athletics department via hands-on event coordination, such as the “Royal Games,” and content creation that highlights the school’s programs and student-athletes (see attached article link). Students also provide coverage of our varsity athletic teams while also focusing on individual athletes who are excelling within their sport. Students gain experience with team previews, coach and player interviews, and social media write-ups. A few students gained experience with scoreboard operation this past fall at home football games, which included creating content published on the scoreboard during games for both players and spectators to see.\n\nContact information: Travis Carr, tcarr@pgs.k12.va.us, 804-937-2234\n\nPrince William County Public Schools: PWCS Sustainable Initiatives\n\nPrince William County Public Schools (PWCS) is committed to ensuring our facilities are welcoming, safe, and sustainable. The PWCS Office of Energy Management and Sustainability has initiated a series of eco-friendly initiatives in our schools to optimize energy efficiency and reduce the division’s carbon footprint. PWCS is installing solar panels at seven schools, replacing all school lighting with LEDs, and constructing the county’s first net-zero school, slated for completion in December 2025. This net-zero school will incorporate environmentally friendly features that will contribute to its net-zero status, signifying a balance of greenhouse gases produced and removed from the atmosphere. The school will also include an outdoor classroom, offering a view of the solar panels, which can serve as an educational tool for students under the staff’s guidance. These modifications will result in financial savings for the division, encourage environmental literacy, and move PWCS toward renewable energy sources to help reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nContact information: Diana Gulotta, gulottdc@pwcs.edu, 703-791-8720\n\nPrince William County Public Schools: Grow Your Own Registered Teacher Apprenticeship\n\nIn February, the Virginia Department of Education awarded Prince William County Public Schools (PWCS) a $350,000 grant to go toward the Grow Your Own Registered Teacher Apprenticeship program. The program is in partnership with Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and is meant to help address teacher shortages by removing cost barriers and providing quality teacher preparation. The program provides an opportunity for VCU undergraduates, who already have an associate degree, to earn their bachelor’s degree at no cost while concurrently working in a PWCS school. The apprenticeship not only covers tuition costs but also offers a full salary with benefits. Furthermore, each participant, who aspires to transition into a classroom teacher role, will be paired with an experienced mentor teacher for guidance and support. The $350,000 grant will support up to 25 apprentices, paving the way for a new generation of educators.\n\nContact information: Diana Gulotta, gulottdc@pwcs.edu, 703-791-8720\n\nPulaski County Public Schools: Book Vending Machine\n\nThe book vending machine is Critzer Elementary’s strategy of rewarding and promoting good behavior. The books are purchased using Title I funds and possibly local grants in the future. Each student is awarded a token card that requires 10 hole punches to earn a token. Hole punches on the token card are earned with exemplary behavior or choices, then students “purchase” high-interest books from the vending machine with a token. Students don’t need their own money and all students at Critzer have the same opportunity to visit the book machine. Reading is the key to all other subjects. Allowing students to make choices about their reading material increases the likelihood that they will engage more in reading. Engaging more in reading will lead to more success. These books are for the students to keep, take home and build home libraries. This vending machine fosters a love for reading in our school community.\n\nContact information: Tony Viers, aviers@pcva.us, 540-643-0920\n\nPulaski County Public Schools: PCHS GO\n\nIn September of 2023, Pulaski County High School held their annual PCHS Go Event. PCHS Go is a student led event in which students dedicate a full school day’s time to on campus community service projects. This year over 80 projects were tackled to help make the PCHS campus a better place and show their Cougar Pride. Some of these projects were painting areas in the school, landscaping, washing faculty/staff vehicles, cleaning our stadium, collecting and organizing donations for our clothing closet, and many others. This event started at PCHS, but soon spread county-wide with elementary schools and middle schools initiating their own volunteer projects. Those students who were not involved in on-campus projects read to younger students at the elementary schools, made homecoming corsages, delivered waters and student-made snacks around to those students who were working on projects, made care bags for nursing home residents and armed forces members.\n\nContact information: Jennifer Bolling, jbolling@pcva.us, 540-239-4299\n\nRoanoke County Public Schools: Student-led conferences\n\nOur Opportunity Ready Certification program began with 5 pilot schools last year and expanded to 15 schools this year, including students’ defenses of learning and student-led conferences. This is a flip of the traditional parent-teacher conference where the parent and the teacher discuss the student’s performance. Instead, the student discusses their performance directly with the parent and the teacher helps guide the discussion. The purpose of student led conferences is to help students take charge of their learning and hold themselves accountable for their successes and opportunities for improvement. As students progress through k-12 education, they will develop their presentation skills to the point they are ready to defend their portfolio in their senior year. Those students that successfully defend their portfolios are presented with an “Opportunity Ready Certification.” We collaborated with local businesses and colleges so that those students who have earned an Opportunity Ready Certification will receive an extra level of consideration for jobs and college admissions.\n\nContact information: Chuck Lionberger, clionberger@rcps.us, 540-562-3700\n\nRoanoke County Public Schools: A-STEP\n\nRoanoke County Public Schools understands that students sometimes needed second chances. Some students who were facing possible expulsion due to poor choices or were simply not being successful in the traditional high school environment, would be better served in an in-person alternative instruction program where these students could continue to pursue their high school diploma in a highly structured and supporting environment. The Alternative Secondary Transitional Education Program (A-STEP) has become a major factor in helping dozens of would-be dropouts become successful high school graduates. Today, A-STEP is becoming a model of alternative instruction that other school divisions are beginning to emulate. Through the A-STEP program, students are not absolved of their poor choices or the consequences of those choices. However, while attending the program, the student has the opportunity to continue their education while also helping to understand the implications of those choices and how they can attempt to repair the damage caused by those poor choices.\n\nContact information: Chuck Lionberger, clionberger@rcps.us, 540-562-3700\n\nRoanoke County Public Schools: Limited Radiological Technician program\n\nCarilion Clinic & Roanoke County Public Schools (RCPS) began this collaboration in early March of 2022. Both teams realized there is a great need for Limited Radiological Technicians (LRT) in our community. To meet this need Carilion & RCPS partnered and created one of only two LRT programs offered to Virginia high school students. Students will go through a 2-year program. They will be eligible to enter the LRT program in their Junior year and finish the program in their Senior year. Not only will students use the Pinnacle Machine to practice taking X-rays but students that are 18 years and older would be eligible to complete clinical requirements. The Claude Moore Scholars Charitable Foundation generously funded this machine for RCPS. Students that go through the LRT program will be academically prepared to take the ARRT Limited Scope of Practice in Radiology exam. Those that pass the ARRT exam will become LRTs and able to work in a variety of clinical settings at Carilion Clinic.\n\nContact information: Chuck Lionberger, clionberger@rcps.us, 540-562-3700\n\nRockingham County Public Schools: Tiered System of Support\n\nThe Tiered Systems of Support is a divisionwide, structured, and intentional model that provides social, emotional, behavioral and mental health support to students with the goal of helping more students be available for academic learning each day. All students receive Tier 1 support, with a focus on creating safe and nurturing school environments. As needed, some students receive Tier 2 and Tier 3 support with specific, targeted interventions from skilled staff members to build mental and behavioral health. These additional staff members include Behavior Support Assistants in each school, Elementary Behavior Specialists, Restorative Practices Specialists, and Early Intervention Counselors. Individual student data indicates improved skills for self-regulation and positive outcomes from intentional behavior intervention. Administrators identify the personnel who provide direct, dedicated behavior support in their buildings as overwhelmingly beneficial to positive behavior change and increased school engagement.\n\nContact information: Liza Coffman, lcoffman@rockingham.k12.va.us, 540.564.3248\n\nSalem City Public Schools: Promoting Oral Health in Schools\n\nStudents have difficulty learning if their teeth hurt! Salem City Schools and New Horizon Healthcare are working together to bring oral health care to students while they are in the school building. The pilot program, initially focusing on elementary grades, is structured to deliver essential dental services to students, with a primary emphasis on the preventative measures of dental screening, applying sealants and fluoride varnish, and dental hygiene. The implementation of the program is conducted in a student-friendly manner, with two dentists visiting classrooms and screening students as they sit in bean bags in the corner of the classroom. On the first day of the pilot program, over 300 students were screened in one elementary school! By bringing oral health care directly into the school setting, this collaboration aims to make dental care more accessible and convenient for students and families.\n\nContact information: Dr. Elizabeth Arthur, earthur@salem.k12.va.us, 540-389-0130\n\nSalem City Public Schools: “New” Special Education Teacher Cohort\n\nSalem City Schools Office of Special Education offers a comprehensive program aimed at supporting “new” special education teachers. The monthly half-day sessions cover a range of topics, ensuring that teachers are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in their roles. Monthly training includes working with teachers on Individual Education Programs (IEPs). IEPs outline the personalized educational plans for students with disabilities. Understanding how to create, implement, and revise IEPs is essential. Encouraging teachers to build partnerships with families is crucial in special education. Teachers receive guidance on effective communication strategies, fostering positive relationships, and involving families. Specially designed instruction involves tailoring teaching methods and materials to meet the unique needs of students. Teachers learn how to adapt curriculum and instruction to address individual learning styles and abilities. The diverse range of topics covered in these sessions indicates a holistic approach to preparing new special education teachers.\n\nContact information: Dr. Randy Jennings, rjennings@salem.k12.va.us, 540-389-0130\n\nStafford County Public Schools: Specialty Centers of Stafford\n\nStafford County Public Schools has expanded its curriculum, launching Specialty Centers of Stafford – comprehensive, specialized, 4-year pathways for like-minded high school students designed to offer a rich academic experience that leads to high quality post-secondary outcomes. Each center will feature multiple pathways tailored to specific student interests and career goals and incorporate work-based learning experiences that elevate the student educational experience. The initiative underscores Stafford Schools’ dedication to academic excellence, fostering high expectations and expanding opportunities through interdisciplinary coursework, while supporting the division’s goal that every student will have a plan to be employed, enlisted, and/or enrolled in a post-secondary institution upon graduation. Further, the Specialty Centers engage the community and business leaders in the learning experience through mutually beneficial partnerships designed to offer real-world opportunities and mentorships in high-demand career fields to Stafford students.\n\nContact information: Michael Bolling, bollingmf@staffordschools.net, 540-658-6000\n\nStafford County Public Schools: Adoption of Policy and Regulation Regarding the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Stafford Schools\n\nStafford Schools is leading the state as the first to officially adopt policy and regulation regarding the ethical and responsible use of Artificial Intelligence, redefining education by embracing the possibilities that AI offers with ethical and appropriate guardrails for learning that create an environment where students are not just consumers of knowledge but active participants in a future-driven learning ecosystem. Coupled with the implementation of expanded high school pathways, Stafford Schools aims to empower students and staff with cutting-edge technology to enhance learning outcomes. The new policy, developed in collaboration with school staff, parents, technology experts, and the Technology Advisory Committee, includes training for teachers and students regarding academic integrity, student data privacy, and inherent biases. Additional safeguards include use of AI as part of a planned lesson, guidelines for proper citation, and communication with parents about the age appropriate use of AI in school.\n\nContact information: Jay Cooke, jcooke@staffordschools.net, 540-658-6000\n\nStafford County Public Schools: Partnership with the JED Foundation to support student mental health\n\nStafford County Public Schools is one of 18 districts selected nationally to participate in the inaugural District Comprehensive Approach (DCA), a joint initiative by The Jed Foundation (JED) and The School Superintendents Association’s (AASA) to bolster students’ mental health. Over four years, the DCA will provide evidence-based framework, expert support, and data-driven guidance to address mental health and reduce suicide risks. This collaboration, rooted in JED’s Comprehensive Approach to Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention for High Schools, underscores the increasing emphasis on students’ emotional well-being. The district will concurrently engage in the JED High School program, the only district nationally to do so, to develop a customized strategic plan to implement tools, strategies, and techniques that lead to measurable improvements in student mental health in its high schools. The initiatives align with Stafford Schools’ strategic plan, emphasizing the crucial role of schools in reversing alarming trends in student mental health.\n\nContact information: Ann Bueche, buecheam@staffordschools.net, 540-658-6000\n\nVirginia Beach City Public Schools: TIDE Coalition\n\nAmplification of student voice is one of the key high yield strategies in the VBCPS Educational Equity Plan. To better foster an environment through which authentic conversations can be held, the Office for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion has established the TIDE coalition. TIDE (Togetherness through Inclusion, Diversity and Equity) is a community of practice comprised of VBCPS staff and select high school students in grades 9-12. The purpose of the coalition is to create a forum in which students work directly with central support staff to identify resources needed to increase student sense of belonging and develop advocacy skills. The coalition collaborates to capture student voice on topics related to equity, social emotional learning, mental health, and civic engagement. Additionally, the central support staff working to address these concerns are able to get meaningful input and feedback that will help guide their decision-making. All of this is for the purpose of improving the approaches at the division level, as well as assisting schools in identifying key areas for improvement and building the capacity of students to lead the work in their respective buildings.\n\nContact information: Ty Harris, tmharris@vbschools.com, 757-263-1218\n\nVirginia Beach City Public Schools: LEAD VB\n\nVirginia Beach City Public Schools (VBCPS) prioritizes fostering effective leadership to enhance school and departmental outcomes.
