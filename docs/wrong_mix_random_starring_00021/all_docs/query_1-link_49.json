While that is good for termites, it isn’t good for homes, businesses, and other structures located in Newport News. Termites are wood-eating pests. Their feeding habits are helpful in nature because they help recycle decaying wood and other organic matter. However, when termites find their way to our structures, their feeding habits are no longer valuable; they are destructive pests that have the potential to cause significant structural damage. Each year, termites generate billions of dollars in damage across the country.\n\nTo help make your property and home less susceptible to termites, you must understand the factors most likely to attract their attention: moisture and wood. The following things in or near your home can be the root causes of a termite infestation.\n\nLeaky pipes, hoses, or gutters\n\nRoof damage\n\nTree stumps and fallen trees\n\nWood mulch\n\nWood-to-soil contact\n\nPoor ventilation\n\nKeeping a clean yard, repairing moisture issues, and maintaining your home’s exterior are key to protecting your Newport News home from destructive termites.\n\nIf you ever find termites on your property or would like to begin proactively safeguarding your property from these damaging pests, Go-Forth Home Services is here to help. Through our comprehensive termite control services, you can rest assured that termites won’t become a problem in your Newport News home.\n\nCall The Newport News Pros At The First Sign Of Ants\n\nAnts are among the most common and easy-to-spot pests that find their way to our Newport News homes. Our properties provide these omnivores with many different food sources and places to nest. Ants are social insects that live together in large groups and successfully maintain multiple nesting sites.\n\nYou should immediately call the Newport News ant control professionals at Go-Forth Home Services when you spot ants trailing near or through your home.
