        "text": "Connor ‘24 and Rachel ‘24\n\nEverything happens for a reason\n\nRachel and I first crossed paths while attending rival high schools in Richmond. Although we were aware of each other through mutual friends, we were merely acquaintances at the time. It wasn't until senior year when the buzz of college acceptances flooded Instagram that I noticed Rachel's acceptance to CNU. Taking the opportunity to extend my congratulations, I connected with her on social media, but our interaction didn't progress beyond that initial exchange.\n\nOur paths converged again during our freshman year at CNU when we both became involved with the Campus Activities Board. We found ourselves among a committee of 25 freshmen tasked with planning movie nights, haunted houses, and various other enjoyable events. It was during this time that I began to develop feelings for her, though the timing never seemed quite right. Despite this, we maintained a friendship that endured until the homecoming of my junior year.\n\nFollowing a casual outing to Sweet Frog with some CAB friends, Rachel kindly offered to drive me back to my apartment. In passing, I mentioned tentative plans to attend the football game and impulsively extended an invitation to her. To my surprise, she called me just before the game began, inquiring about my whereabouts. Her unexpected presence added an element of joy to the game, and afterward, we made plans to play board games at my apartment. Looking back, that impromptu invitation marked the beginning of our romantic journey.\n\nWe both believe in the adage that everything happens for a reason, and our experience is a testament to this belief. Since that serendipitous moment, Rachel and I have been inseparable, cherishing each day together as a testament to the unexpected twists of fate.\n\nMaya ‘23 and Andrew ‘23\n\nDay Ones\n\nMaya Nicolaus (maiden name: Turner) and I connected through Instagram the summer before entering our first semester at CNU in 2019. On freshman move-in day (August 17th, 2019) I saw Maya across the great lawn wearing a Young Life shirt, and went up to her to introduce myself in person. From there, we hit it off as best friends, and got super close that fall semester as we navigated the ins and outs of college.\n\nThen, come our spring semester, we continued to get even closer (at this point, I had a massive crush on Maya) and she ended up staying in my hometown for spring break. We ended up sharing a kiss that break, which then led to conversations of our mutual feelings for each other. Unfortunately, though, this was right when COVID hit CNU and we were sent home (Maya went to Florida, and I went to Maryland), where we were apart the rest of the semester and during the summer. During this time we shared endless FaceTime calls, and I even flew down to Florida to visit her.\n\nFor many people, the summer of 2020 can be remembered as the worst summer ever, but for me, I remember it as the summer when I fell in love with my best friend. After the summer, we entered our sophomore year at CNU, and ended up making our relationship \"official\" on September 4, 2020. It was literally the start of forever! Throughout our relationship at CNU, Maya and I were both involved in Young Life, CAB, Residence Life, and were in many of the same COMM classes together. We dated all of Sophomore year, all of Junior year, and then come Senior year, I proposed to Maya in her hometown on September 16, 2022.\n\nBesides working on our Senior Sem project together, we spent all of Senior year wedding planning and creating roots for our future life together. After graduating in May of 2023, we had another long distance summer, but then we officially tied the knot and got married on September 9, 2023 with our best friends standing by our side (who were also CNU alum).\n\nI always hoped that I would meet my wife in college, but I did not expect her to show up on my first day there. Everyone knows CNU for its welcoming, close-knit community, and I can attest- it is true! CNU literally introduced me to my wife on day 1, and welcomed us both into the community with open arms. To say that our time spent together in college was a dream is an understatement. Our time at CNU was the biggest blessing of our lives, and flourished a lifetime of love and joy.\n\nRick ‘95 and Lara ‘94\n\nIntro to Theatre (and so much more)\n\nIn the spring of 1992, I was a junior History major at CNU and a member of the baseball team. My sophomore year I had to take an Intro to Theatre class to fulfill a humanities requirement or something and David Balthrop, the professor of the class, made us go see all the productions the theatre department was putting on. The first one I saw was the musical The King and I. I had grown up as a jock and had never seen any theatre before but when the woman playing Anna (the and I part) came onstage, I was immediately smitten. Her name was Lara Brier and she was a beautiful, talented ingenue who could sing and act and I knew I had to find a way to meet her.\n\nThat spring Professor Balthrop was teaching a Makeup for Theatre class. I assumed if we had to see the plays in an Intro class, in a makeup class we would have to actually work on the plays. I knew so little about theatre I figured every actor had their own personal makeup artist! So I talked another baseball player (Jeff Olsavicky) into taking the class with me and when we first arrived we were like strangers in a strange land. BUT it turns out Lara was in the class too! So I started pursuing her and she rebuffed me repeatedly until near the end of the semester.\n\nOn April 8, 1992 we had our first date. We got married on January 4, 1997 and we were together through good and bad, from then until September 20, 2015 when I lost her to breast cancer. To say she changed my life is beyond an understatement. I ended up double majoring in History and Theatre and have maintained a career in professional and academic theatre for more than 25 years now. I was actually an adjunct at CNU in the fall of 2022. She had an amazing career as a teacher/vocal coach and actor and there is a memorial plaque to her in the Arts Garden at the Ferguson Center.\n\nOne final part to the story, our son Aidan is currently a freshman music major at CNU and I am so proud and thrilled that he followed in our footsteps.\n\nAidan ‘24 and Beverley ‘24\n\nParent (Facebook) Trap\n\nWe are seniors here and we have been together since first semester of Freshman year. We started dating September 27, 2020 and we are coming up on three and a half years in March. When I first made it to CNU I had trouble making friends so my mom posted on the 2024 parent page that her daughter was driving her crazy with calling at breakfast, lunch, and dinner and eating by herself. Aidan's mom then commented under my mom's fb post and said basically that her son was the same was and to send me his way. After five attempts of trying to talk myself into knocking on the door, I finally did. When he opened the door he asking if I was there for his roommate and my reply was I'm actually here for an Aidan. We exchanged numbers that night and we then started eating meals together and hung out during our free time. After a little bit over a month of hanging out we were watching an episode of an anime we had started together and I grabbed his hand. He then responded \"by the way you just grabbed my hand to hold it, I'm going to assume that you like me as well.\" A week later we had went to my hometown and on the way back I asked him to make it official. That's our love story, and we hope to continue to make more memories together for the unforeseeable future!\n\nVictoria ‘16 and Jacob ‘17\n\nNext door neighbors\n\nJacob and I (Victoria) met in August of 2012 when we were both assigned to the fourth floor of Potomac North as next door neighbors. We became friends and remained so throughout our freshman year. We had a lot in common, and even realized our birthdays were only a day apart.\n\nWe started dating our sophomore year (October 25th, 2013-remember this date, it’s important later). I graduated in 2016, and Jacob graduated a year later. We were married March 9, 2019.\n\nOn February 24, 2021, we welcomed our first child, a boy named Declan. Just a few months ago, on October 24, 2023, welcomed our second child: a little girl named Birdie. A day after Birdie was born, Jacob and I celebrated an entire decade together. Next month, we will be married for 5 years.\n\nI can’t think of a better life than the one I have now. So a special shout out to the housing office of CNU for their A+ work!\n\nCait ‘12, ‘13 and Phil ‘12\n\n🎶 It's a love story, baby just say yes 🎶\n\n(Phil actually did have a Taylor Swift poster in his PoNo dorm room circa 2008)\n\nWe’re Cait & Phil Cedor. We met at PLP Week in Summer 2008, got married at CNU in 2014, and are celebrating our 10 year anniversary this year.\n\nCait was an Alpha Phi and Phil was a rugby player. Cait was a history major (‘12) and MAT graduate (‘13), while Phil graduated with an accounting degree from the business school (‘12). Dr. Heuvel was their favorite professor, and they are still close with many of their CNU friends.\n\nWhen Phil proposed in 2013, they knew their wedding needed to be at CNU where their love story began. Cait and Phil were one of the first couples to get married at the Chapel, and the party continued in the DSU Ballroom for their reception. They even got special permission to take their “first look” pictures in P.Trib’s back yard!\n\nToday they live in Richmond with their 3 daughters. Cait is a history teacher and Phil works for Capital One. They are hoping that at least one of their girls ends up at CNU.\n\nBill ‘94 and Sya ‘97\n\nOpening a door to love\n\nI met my wife in 1992 while attending CNU. I opened a door, and she was there! I stuck my hand out, introduced myself....the rest is history! She has made me the luckiest guy in the world ever since.\n\nWe are the very proud parents of two sons and have been married for 28 years! Sya had just graduated from UVA, and I was still finishing my degree at CNU. She later went on to get a second degree from CNU, so even though we did not go to school together, we are both Captains.\n\nI work for the Newport News Airport and think of the first time we met every time I look out from my office window. The door I opened when we met was from an apartment just outside of the airport fence. PHF will always be my favorite airport because of that memory.\n\nZack ‘09 and Melody ‘09\n\nA (not so) random encounter\n\nMy wife, Melody, and I met at Setting Sail back in 2005. She was the beautiful theater major who played the lead in CNU's production of Urinetown, and I was the nerdy Communications Major working in the IT Department at Northrop Grumman. During my junior year, I had a photography class in the Ferguson Center for the Arts that happened to coincide with the dismissal of a dance class that Melody was taking. So, I would 'step out' of my photography class to 'randomly bump into Melody' as she was walking to her car. Don't worry, I still got an A in photography.\n\nThat same year, I took my sister, Joy (also a CNU alumna), to see Taylor Hicks at The Ferguson Center, a concert that Melody happened to be attending as well. My sister and I bumped into Melody (this time it was actually a random encounter), and after meeting Melody and seeing the chemistry between her and me, my sister stopped, looked at me, and said, \"Are you stupid? Why haven't you asked her on a date?\" So, a while later, I built up the courage and did just that. Melody and I started dating in the second half of our junior year, got engaged our senior year, and then were married two months after we graduated from CNU (Class of 2009).\n\nSince then, we have both gone on to earn our master's degrees from Southeastern Theological Seminary and currently serve at LifeBrook Church in Houston, TX. Early in our marriage, we felt a calling to adopt, and after six years, that opportunity swiftly became reality. In a whirlwind of events, we went from hearing about the possibility to cradling our newborn son in just six weeks. As we were driving to Florida to meet our newborn son, Melody began feeling carsick. After a few days, she was still unwell, and we discovered that her 'carsickness' was actually 'morning sickness.' Seven months later, our daughter was born! Since then, we have welcomed one more child and today, as parents of three wonderful children, we find immense joy in both nurturing our family and shepherding our church community at LifeBrook Church.\n\nKathryn ‘18 and Ian\n\nA couple of the Commonwealth\n\nMy husband, Ian, and I met at CNU! We met through a mutual friend (his DU brother) in September 2015, then started dating almost exactly a year later in September 2016. He proposed in December 2017 at Christmas Town Busch Gardens, and we got married at the Dominion Club in Richmond, VA in October 2018. We have since lived in Newport News, Culpeper, and are now in Richmond, VA! Recently we were reminiscing about CNU, and discovered that we were most likely in the same PSYC201 class with Dr. Gibbons in the spring 2015 semester. That was my freshman year and I just switched my interest to Psychology, and he was a transfer student who needed to fulfill some of the basic degree requirements. We talked about another mutual acquaintance and both said \"I took a PSYC class with him,\" then worked backwards to discover that we were most likely in the same exact class! He sat in the front row and I sat in the third. We didn't officially meet during that class, but it was wild to find out that we sat in the same room together for months before actually meeting and dating. I'm so grateful that CNU brought us together!\n\nWill and Victoria ‘23\n\nNo sophomore slump here\n\nWe are Will and Victoria, we have been dating for a little over 3 years now after we met our sophomore year at CNU. We lived next to each other in PoSo and first met the night of move-in day (August 28, 2020). We quickly became friends, hanging out nearly everyday, which was especially easy considering we mostly had online classes because of COVID. By November we were officially a couple.\n\nAfter sophomore year, Will transferred to take a job offer with a tech company in DC while he finished school but we stayed together. Vic graduated May of 2023 with a B.S. in Neuroscience and matriculated into Eastern Virginia Medical School to become a physician. Will graduated from Marymount with a business degree.\n\nThe past three and a half years have been filled with so many fun memories and we have been able to travel to so many different places together - including a month-long cross country roadtrip (photo of the route in the gallery below) to celebrate us graduating!\n\nThanks CNU for bringing us together!"
