        "text": "The staff at First Discovery is truly wonderful, caring and patient. They accepted our son with open arms and made him feel safe, loved and confident. His teachers were always willing to speak with us about his day during pick up time. We were always please with the way he was treated and felt that they really had his best interest at heart. I would highly recommend First Discovery to anyone looking for a positive, encouraging environment for their child(ren).\n\n- Shannon Wells\n\nThis child care is absolutely AMAZING ! My daughter had a rough time being pretty much her first child care she has ever been in however , they take great care of her & she is constantly engaging in fun activities ( which I know is hard to come up with activities for a one year old ) the staff is beyond amazing & you can tell they all genuinely care about the children ! They take care of the parents as well with complimentary breakfast here & there & coffee . They keep the kids on a daily schedule & great healthy meals are provided . They also have GREAT communication & security . I LOVE THIS FACILITY !\n\n- Burr Lee\n\nWe toured numerous schools before we stepped foot inside First Discovery. From the second we walked in and were greeted by Miss Jessica, we knew this was the right place for our son. All of the staff here are absolutely amazing! Each and every one of them take time out of their busy schedule to really get to know your child and your family. I never have to worry because I know that my son is well taken care of and loved by all of the Infant Teachers. The First Discovery Family is amazing, and we wouldn’t take our son anywhere else!\n\n- The Moyer Family\n\nWhat can I say about First Discovery, first and foremost this place is god sent. The environment and vibe of the is place is always positive and welcoming. I have a daughter who has been going here since she was 2 yrs old and now she is 5 and she loves it here . When she first started and was very shy always walking around with her blanket now she walks in full of energy and ready for the day. I don't give credit to just one teacher but all of them. This is the hardest job working with children but when you look at the classrooms and the teachers you wouldn't think it was. I want to say thank you to all the teacher at First Discovery for making this a home for my family.\n\n- April Crump\n\nMy son has been attending first discovery since he was six weeks old. It has been a wonderful experience. The staff takes the time to talk to you and get to know your kid even if they are not in their classroom. The staff is well trained and experienced. They are dedicated to your child’s development. The thing I love the best is that it feels like a family. A whole set of teachers helping you along the way, always ready to give advice if you need it. I am so glad I found them for childcare for my child and would definitely recommend them to anyone who asks!\n\n- Jennifer Tanner\n\nI can't express enough how much we love First Discovery. I never knew how unhappy my daughter was with her previous sitter until she started going to FD. She has blossomed so much and she looks forward to going every day. The teachers and all the staff are amazing. It's definitely reassuring knowing your child is somewhere safe and they are happy\n\n- Theerese Tisor\n\nWe love First Discovery Child Development Center. Our son has been going there since he was as infant. The staff are so loving, kind, gentle, patient and encouraging. He has learned so much. At almost 3 years old, he LOVES learning and is progressing so well! Thank you, First Discovery Child Development Center Staff and Leadership, for all that you do to make FDCDC such a great place for our children to learn, play and grow!\n\n- Jody Herrington Gettys"
