        "text": "How Memory Care Facilities Can Help\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer’s Association, 83% of all caregivers are unpaid family members, relatives, or other friends, and nearly half of all care is for older adults with some form of dementia. Caregiving, especially when it involves Alzheimer’s or dementia, is extremely exhausting and time consuming, leading many caregivers to feel isolated and overwhelmed.\n\nAs a loved one continues to progress through the stages of dementia and his or her cognitive abilities continue to decline, behavioral problems, safety, and general care often become more than one caregiver can handle. This is when it’s important to find extra help, and residential facilities that have specialized memory care programs are often the best solution.\n\nIn addition to providing a safe environment, memory care programs seek to delay or halt cognitive decline while providing the opportunity for a social, independent lifestyle.\n\nOur Selection Process\n\nTo choose the best memory care facilities in Newport News, our team of researchers started by using our unique methodology to develop a list of contenders. We further refined the list in the next phase of our process by completing hands-on research for each one of the companies that we developed. Finally, we compiled online reviews from residents and families and wrote summaries of each facility that made it through our selection process.\n\nOverall, our team:\n\nSpent over 45 hours researching memory care facilities in Newport News\n\nRead more than 160 reviews written by residents and their loved ones\n\nInterviewed 13 representatives from local communities\n\nReviews of the 20 Best Memory Care Facilities in Newport News, VA\n\nCommonwealth Senior Living at Georgian Manor\n\nResident Capacity:80\n\nRoom Types:Studios, Companion Suites\n\nCare Provided: Assisted Living, Memory Care, Respite\n\nBase Pricing:$4,015 for Assisted Living, $4,684 for Memory Care\n\nNestled into the heart of Chesapeake, Commonwealth Senior Living at Georgian Manor provides a high level of care.
