The program will consist of an 8-week course covering various mental health topics, ranging from emotion and stress management to nutrition and resilience building. During the 8-weeks, local resources in Staunton will teach informative lessons on each topic while also sharing the importance of physical activity in personal well-being with a physical component each week. The aim of FUEL is to provide the necessary tools and resources to at-risk and justice-involved adolescents who need guidance on how to fully understand and cater to their personal well-being from a physical and emotional standpoint. The 8-week course will conclude with a graduation ceremony that gives adolescents the opportunity to reflect on their success and how they will use what they have learned in their future endeavors.\n\nBiography: Teegan Lewis is a criminal justice major with a minor in psychology and homeland security from Opp, Alabama.

Postmortem intervals (PMI) define the time that has passed from the death of an individual to their discovery. Observing insect and bacterial species found on corpses aids in the determination of the duration of the PMI as specific decay stages are predominated by distinct species. These ranges of predominance can be altered due to variability in the surrounding environment, such as temperature fluctuations associated with climate change. Our understanding of how temperature increases affect the abundance and temporal appearance of specific bacterial species is unknown. Fluctuations, such as the increase in temperature, are speculated to result in the increased rate of decay while decreasing bacterial species sensitive to elevated temperatures. We tested the rate of decay with respect to bacterial species in a laboratory setting. Rats were buried into 4 inches of soil and exposed to elevated temperature ranges of 6.0 °C and 3.0 °C higher than ambient temperature with ambient temperature as the control group. Bacterial samples are collected before skeletonization occurs and assessed by qPCR using the 2-ΔΔCT method to determine the differences in the abundance of bacteria between treatment groups. Visual assessment of the decomposition was recorded each day by photographs. We expect these findings to provide information on climate change effects on postmortem forensic analysis in regards to bacterial species known for decomposition.\n\nBiography: Lukas Brown is a biology major (medical emphasis) with a minor in anthropology from Lynchburg, Virginia.

Low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected by ambient air pollution, have limited access to air quality data in their community, and lack the resources necessary to determine if the air quality in their community is safe. Current marketed sensors typically measure only one air quality factor, are expensive for the average consumer, require large energy inputs, and are not portable or space-efficient. In this research, a mobile air quality multi-sensor was created to establish a portable, low-power, and cost-efficient 5-sensor multisensor. The total cost of the multisensor was roughly $200 and the entire multisensor was small and easily portable. Arduino software and hardware were utilized for the multisensor, which included a carbon monoxide sensor, volatile organic compounds sensor, ozone sensor, particulate matter sensor, and temperature and humidity sensor. A one-sample t-test was used to analyze the accuracy of each sensor, and at a 0.01 significance level, each sensor produced concentrations that were accurate compared to concentrations derived from local precise instruments. The multisensor was utilized to collect data throughout several days to determine trends in air quality in Staunton, Virginia.\n\nBiography: Chloe Beasley is a chemistry major with a minor in leadership and exercise science.

Humans have two types of AMPs: defensins and cathelicidins.The sole member of the human cathelicidin family is the LL-37 peptide which is cationic, holding a +6 charge and great potential for its antimicrobial properties. The metabolically active form of Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) has been shown to trigger immune responses through signaling which induces and upregulates the expression of LL-37. To investigate the relationship between LL-37 production and induction by vitamin D3 levels, THP-1 macrophages were treated with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and the expression of the LL-37 CAMP gene was examined. CAMP amplification was determined by using the following techniques: RNA purification, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), real-time PCR (qPCR), and gel electrophoresis. In early analysis, the results appear to be qualitatively consistent with the compared literature. Data analysis and calculations are in progress to further evaluate this conclusion.\n\nBiography: Anastasia Bunting is a chemistry major with a minor in leadership. Her hometown is Lawrence, Kansas.

To portray high emotions in music, composers may use a wide variety of compositional devices. In vocal music, the presence of text adds even more possibilities for expressing high emotional intensity. This capstone presentation will explore these emotions by showcasing the intersection of text and music through three different genres: German art song (lied), opera, and musical theatre. For this presentation, I have selected three pieces from my senior recital: “Gretchen am Spinnrade” (German art song by Franz Schubert), “I go to him” (from the opera The Rake’s Progress), and “So in Love” (from the musical Kiss me, Kate). While these pieces belong to different music genres, they share similar narratives, as in all three selections, the emotional distress that the heroines are experiencing stems from their unfulfilled love lives.\n\nBiography: Maria Sarri is a music major (Vocal Performance Emphasis) and a theatre minor.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies Acephate as a possible human carcinogen. Other studies have addressed the possible carcinogenicity of Acephate in living mice and other cell lines, but none have evaluated the amelanotic mouse melanoma PG19 cell line. PG19 cells were used to evaluate the effects of Acephate because individuals most at risk of exposure to Acephate are also at risk of developing melanoma. The effects of short-term exposure to various concentrations of Acephate (10, 100, and 1000µg/ml) were investigated on PG19 cells through trypan blue exclusion cell viability and scratch wound healing assays. Based on experimental evidence, treatment with Acephate was expected to increase proliferation and migration rates indicating a role in carcinogenesis and metastasis within a PG19 melanoma cell model. Treatment with Acephate resulted in significant decreases in cell viability of PG19 cells at 24 hours. Exposure to 1000μg/mL of Acephate had a cytotoxic effect. At 24 hours, there were no significant differences in scratch wound width between Acephate treatments. Comparison and evaluation of the mechanisms of previously published findings of pro-carcinogenic effects in longer-term assays compared to the cell toxicity in the short-term experiments performed in these studies is important in determining the risk assessment of the continued usage of Acephate in the United States.\n\nBiography: Kaley Kuhaneck is a biology major with a minor in criminal justice.

While there is no medical cure for epilepsy there are medications that can help minimize symptoms that patients may experience. Every variation of epilepsy is due to different molecular mechanisms meaning that the medications must be able to target these different mechanisms. Despite the constant advances in medicine there proves to be variations of epilepsy that are “drug-resistant” and do not react to the medications. Cannabis, commonly known as marijuana or CBD, has properties to include antioxidants and anti-inflammatories. Previous studies have shown that cannabis can alleviate symptoms of psychological disorders including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In the current study, it is proposed that cannabis can be a holistic approach to minimizing symptoms of epilepsy in Drosophila melanogaster. Two different mutants of epilepsy were tested in Drosophila melanogaster, the jus mutant and the eas mutant. The jus mutant affected sodium ion channels while the eas mutant involved a deletion of a critical enzyme. Within these two different mutants three different amounts of CBD were administered, no CBD, 0.1mg/mL CBD, and 0.5mg/mL CBD for a total of three weeks. Starting before any CBD was administered seizures were induced via a vortex machine for 30 seconds to 10 individual flies per group. After the vortex machine seizures were measured until flies returned to normal activity. This study was performed for three weeks and was repeated three times. The results show a significant difference in CBD concentrations in the jus mutant however not in the eas mutant.\n\nBiography: Katherine Thoele is a biology major with a biomedical emphasis and a minor in psychology.

It remains as the most frequent form of cancer diagnosed in men over the age of 50, where 80% of prostate cases involve men at the age of 65 or above. As of 2024, the American Cancer society estimated about 299,010 new cases of prostate cancer and proximately 35,250 deaths associated with this disease in the USA. If prostate cancer is diagnosed early when it’s still in the prostate gland, men have roughly a 92% to live longer than 5 years with prostate cancer. PC-3 cells are human prostate cancer cells that are widely used in studying prostate cancer, as well as being useful for investigating their response to chemotherapeutic agents. Research indicates that PC-3 cells are the most ideal as they show the best adaptive results early on compared to other prostate cells like LNCaP. The main goal for this experiment is to analyze the cell migration of PC-3 Prostate Cancer cells when treated with differentiation agents Epinephrine and Forskolin, concluding if these agents are able to affect the migration of these cells.\n\nBiography: Ellis Gonzalez is a biology major from Newport News, Virginia.

The USDA’s study displayed that cleaning poultry increases chances of cross contamination events within the domestic kitchen. Packaged poultry on store shelves is typically treated with food safe sanitizers. Bacteria occasionally can survive the sanitizers, leaving them in a sublethally injured state. Sublethally injured bacteria possess the ability to recover and reproduce in more suitable environments. In this study, chicken breasts were artificially inoculated with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The effectiveness of washing the chicken’s surface with vinegar, salt water, tap water, lemon juice, and the control (unwashed) was gathered by calculating the number of dead cells, sublethal injury rates, and recovery rates of the cells for each treatment at 12 hour intervals. Data from plate counts on selective and nonselective media were used in a formula from the literature. Side by side optical density analysis with a spectrophotometer was used as an additional method to compare recovery and growth rates. All treatments expressed growth on the nonselective and selective media. Lemon juice appears to cause the highest ratio of sublethally injured cells on samples contaminated with S. aureus and E. coli. The effects of cleaning overall have a greater effect on E. coli. The recovery rates after washes appear to be highly variable between S. aureus and E.coli. The results affirm the USDA’s recommendation that the wash methods are ineffective at achieving decontamination on the poultry’s surface.\n\nBiography: Sade Brown is a biology major from Newport News, Virginia.

Macrophages are commonly known as antigen-presenting cells that can either engulf antigens or act as pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators, which is why these immune cells have been studied to understand their role in allergies. Recent studies have shown that certain alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) or M2 macrophages are part of the mechanism by which allergies develop, IL-4 macrophages being one of them. However, multiple allergy studies use human primary immune cells that have been differentiated such as monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) that might not have specific involvement with other immune cells that trigger allergy. THP-1 monocyte human cells are an immortalized monocyte cell line that allows us to differentiate macrophages in vitro into a variety of AAM. In this study THP-1 human cells were differentiated into M(IL-4) macrophages to study their possible role in immune responses to pollen. THP-1 cells were differentiated into M(IL-4) macrophages by PMA and IL-4 cytokine exposure to then be exposed to pine pollen during different time periods. Alternative macrophages such as M(IL-4) arise from signaling pathways other than the classical Interferon-Gamma-dependent activation, and various research suggest that the type of macrophage differentiation induced during allergies is not the same for all allergens. This research delves into studying allergen-macrophage interaction between alternative differentiated M(IL-4) macrophages and pine pollen using the chemokine CCL17 as a marker for M(IL-4) macrophages through qPCR gene expression analysis. CCL17 is a cytokine that helps antigen presenting cells to communicate with the adaptive immune system to produce molecules involved in allergy symptoms. Based on previous studies, we expect CCL17 gene expression to increase in IL-4 macrophages exposed to pollen, suggesting that these AAM have a role in inflammatory responses to pollen as an allergen.\n\nBiography: Juliana Villamizar Suesca, originally from Bogotá, Colombia, is a dedicated biology major with a minor in chemistry.

Even though there is not a direct cause for IBD, an individual’s diet is considered to be a contributing factor. Artificial food dyes are one of the most common ingredients found in food items, like candy and electrolyte sports drinks, that are consumed on a daily basis. Red #40 dye, also known as Allura Red AC, is the most commonly used artificial food dye in these types of foods. Red #40 is carcinogenic, as it contains a chemical known as benzidine, and can cause serious health issues like liver and kidney damage. Red #40 dye has also been associated with behavioral disorders in children, specifically ADHD. Due to this, the safety of this artificial food dye is constantly being questioned. The purpose of this study is to determine if chronically consuming Red #40 dye has negative effects on the overall health of the gut microbiome. Researchers have been able to show that chronic exposure to this dye can induce colitis in mice. Drosophila melanogaster will be used as the model organism in this study to show what effects the Red #40 dye will have on the gut microbiome because their gut is similar to the mammalian gut, both in function and structure. This model organism will also allow for there to be a better understanding of disorders that affect the human digestive system. Research has also shown that there is a correlation between ulcerative colitis and levels of Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is a bacteria commonly found in the gut microbiome. Individuals with IBD typically have higher levels of this bacteria in their gut microbiome than individuals not suffering from IBD. This study consisted of feeding fruit flies different concentrations (0.025% and 0.25%) of two different food dyes, Red #40 and beet powder mixed with the lab fly food media. Beet powder was chosen to contrast the effects that the Red #40 dye will have on the gut microbiome because it is a natural food dye. The levels of Klebsiella pneumoniae will be measured after two weeks of feeding and will be measured through bacterial culture and ERIC-PCR.

It can cause many symptoms when an individual is infected, including diarrhea, lethargy, growth defects, and even death. Cryptosporidium is the main cause of SCOURS (Death due to dehydration) in the United States cattle population as well as the second main cause of severe diarrhea in children under 5 years of age worldwide. In order to learn how to properly mitigate infection rates the significant factors that affect infection rates of Cryptosporidium in Cattle must be discovered. The main environmental factors being taken into consideration in this paper are age, gender, and type of water source the cattle have access to in their given pasture. Samples from cattle of different ages and genders were collected and tested for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts, using a modified Zeil-Neelsen fast acid staining procedure. The number of Cryptosporidium per field of view was counted for each individual fecal sample smear. Once all data had been recorded, the number of oocysts per field of view was compared to the type of water source the individual has access to, as well as the gender and age of the individual using a Mann-Whitney U statistical analysis. These results can now provide knowledge into possibly reducing the infection rates of Cryptosporidium in cattle by changing the type of water source they have access to, and by taking extra precautions during certain ages of the cattle.\n\nBiography: Lauryn Faulkner-Sitton is a determined and passionate environmental biology major.

From October to December 2023, we conducted a research study to address this knowledge gap. We collected blood and feather samples from Carolina Wrens residing along the South River in Waynesboro, Virginia, in order to investigate the potential impacts of contamination on avian malaria. After collection, the blood samples were placed on slides and stained using the Giemsa staining method. We then examine the stained blood cell slides to determine the prevalence and intensity of avian malaria infections in the collected samples. We hypothesize that the prevalence of avian malaria will be higher in the samples collected from birds residing downstream of the contamination source. By conducting this study, we aim to contribute to the growing body of scientific knowledge by contributing to the existing body of literature and serve as a valuable resource for future research efforts in the relationship between mercury contamination and the prevalence of avian malaria in terrestrial songbirds.\n\nBiography: Savannah Gibbs is an Environmental Biology major with a minor in Dance from Homosassa, Florida.

As humans we also require the ability to reach other populations in our daily life, and as the population grows we must continue to expand and create more and improved infrastructure. Pathways are created for human needs and wants for quicker transportation and recreation, but these pathways can lead to separation of populations and fragmentation where organisms are now left more vulnerable to predators. Due to a large amount of research being conducted on larger mammals and the effects of roads and highways, it can be hypothesized that smaller pathways like hiking trails may also have negative impacts on smaller organisms such as Carabids. Carabids are commonly known as ground beetles from the family Carabidae. By using a mark-recapture method and pit-fall traps with Carabids found on three trails with three different widths/terrain, it was determined that the trails were not a barrier due to their short movement patterns.\n\nBiography: Ashlea Stone is an environmental biology major from Calhoun, Georgia.

Previous research has demonstrated that essential oils contain volatile compounds with antimicrobial properties and are a feasible alternative to registered fungicides. In this study, a direct contact assay involving the culture of Rhizopus stolonifer on untreated potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates, PDA plates amended with a 1% (v/v) concentration of lemongrass essential oil (LEO), and PDA plates amended with 0.048% (v/v) Azoxystrobin, a FRAC Group 11 fungicide was performed. Ethanol was utilized as an emulsifier to distribute the LEO in the PDA, and control groups utilizing ethanol were prepared to evaluate potential inhibitory effects on mycelial growth of R. stolonifer. Rates of inhibition were determined by measuring the average diameter of R. stolonifer over the course of 7 days and using the inhibition formula. Results indicate that LEO completely inhibited mycelial growth and Azoxystrobin is most effective in inhibiting the growth of R. stolonifer in the first three days of infection and then achieves a steady inhibition rate of about 40% thereafter.\n\nBiography: Cierra Murphy is a biology major with minors in political science and chemistry.

This peptide contains a +6 charge, allowing interaction with negatively charged membranes found in bacteria or other indicators of infections. This allows the peptide to defend the body against bacteria, promote wound healing, induce cell death, and regulate the immune response. Palmitic acid (C16) is the most abundant saturated fatty acid in the human body and is found in many oils. It has been linked to increased inflammation when present in high amounts. This research presents an investigation in which THP-1 macrophages were treated with palmitic acid and CAMP (LL-37) expression was evaluated. Different techniques were employed to determine the expression of CAMP, including RNA purification, reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), quantitative PCR (qPCR), and gel electrophoresis. Our results demonstrated that macrophages treated with palmitic acid increased mRNA transcription and the expression of CAMP by 30-fold. This fits with similar results published by other groups. Others have shown that long-chain fatty acids, namely dodecanoate (C12) and Tetradecanoate (C14) have a 5-fold increase at a similar concentration. Medium-chain fatty acids have a 30-fold increase at higher concentrations.\n\nBiography: Carlie Shoemaker is a biochemistry major with a minor in political science. Her hometown is Broadway, VA.

It’s often used in various industries, including food production and medicine. This short-chain fatty acid can be found in certain foods or even produced by the body, and it has been studied for its potential health benefits, such as improving gut health and possibly even reducing inflammation. The enhancement of the activity of LL-37 by sodium butyrate has potential use in treating a variety of illnesses, including treating infectious disorders and chronic inflammatory diseases; improving the microbiome, and regulating hormones. Sodium butyrate has been found to enhance the expression of LL-37 in cells, and gaining knowledge of sodium butyrate’s effects on LL-37 expression opens up new avenues for creative treatment approaches. Thus in this research, THP-1 cells were utilized as a model for replicating the function of macrophages in the body. These were treated THP-1 cells with different concentrations of sodium butyrate to better understand what concentration range is optimal for increasing LL-37 activity. To measure LL-37 expression levels as a function of sodium butyrate concentration, we treated cells with the following concentrations (0.25µM, 0.50µM, 0.75µM, 1.0µM ) . Rneasy, Polymerase Chain Reaction, or rt-PCR were utilized to understand what is going on at a molecular level during treatment. The RNeasy kit is a laboratory tool commonly used for isolating RNA from cells or tissues, while Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or rt-PCR (reverse transcription PCR) is a technique used to amplify and detect specific DNA or RNA sequences, often employed for genetic analysis or diagnostic purposes. For analyzing the PCR DNA products, Gel electrophoresis was utilized, however, this one displayed inconclusive results. Some possible explanations for this could be that the agarose use may not be as optimal as others or that the buffer utilized was pre-made by someone else. Nonetheless, based on the data collected from the PCR it was concluded that there is an increase in LL-37 throughout the different treatment concentrations of sodium butyrate in comparison to ꞵ-actin. In particular, concentrations 0.75 µM and 1.00µM showed the most enhancement of the gene expression of LL-37.\n\nBiography: Neriam Melendez Santiago is a biochemistry major with a minor in physics and business.

Low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected by ambient air pollution, have limited access to air quality data in their community, and lack the resources necessary to determine if the air quality in their community is safe. Current marketed sensors typically measure only one air quality factor, are expensive for the average consumer, require large energy inputs, and are not portable or space-efficient. In this research, a mobile air quality multi-sensor was created to establish a portable, low-power, and cost-efficient 5-sensor multisensor. The total cost of the multisensor was roughly $200 and the entire multisensor was small and easily portable. Arduino software and hardware were utilized for the multisensor, which included a carbon monoxide sensor, volatile organic compounds sensor, ozone sensor, particulate matter sensor, and temperature and humidity sensor. A one-sample t-test was used to analyze the accuracy of each sensor, and at a 0.01 significance level, each sensor produced concentrations that were accurate compared to concentrations derived from local precise instruments. The multisensor was utilized to collect data throughout several days to determine trends in air quality in Staunton, Virginia.\n\nBiography: Chloe Beasley is a chemistry major with a minor in leadership and exercise science.

Two men and two women with different training backgrounds provided informed consent to participate in a series of physiologic tests that included a VO2 max, 3-min maximal interval to calculate CP, and a 15-min steady state test (SS). The SS was prescribed at the CP, defined as the average power in the final 30-sec of the 3-min CP test. During all testing, VO2 and HR were measured continuously, while rating of perceived exertion (RPE 1 – 10) and blood lactate (BLC) were measured at min 5 and 15. BLC was considered a steady state if BLC changed less than 1 mM between the two samples. All data are presented as mean + SD. Subjects were 24± 4 years; 169.1±7.9 cm; 74.7±16.3 kg. Only one of the four subjects was able to complete the 15 min trial at the prescribed workload. Subjects mean power for CP is 140 watts while the actual prescribed power was 150 watts. Mean HR is 163 and Mean BLC is 6.4. After the study there was only one of the participants that had steady state. These data indicate that calculated critical power may well exceed steady state lactate in fit college students and may not be an ideal test for estimating MLSS for these individuals.\n\nBiography: Grace Hearns is a exercise science major from Memphis, Tennessee.

Scars normally allow for full return of elasticity and mechanical function. However, in individuals with physiologic abnormalities that interrupt the Smad pathways, this process can become uncontrolled and inefficient. In the case of individuals experiencing a hyperexpression of Transforming Growth Factor – Beta (Tgf-β), the recruitment and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components is modified to a point at which deposition becomes excessive. The excess of ECM components in a scar significantly reduces the opportunity for the tissue to return to an average elasticity and decreases the mechanical integrity of the tissue. The resulting scars also cause a high level of pain in those affected. Previous work has identified the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, Vorinostat, as a potential method to regulate Tgf-β expression in the Smad pathways by increasing the expression of (TGIFs), forms of Smad pathway co-repressors, in individuals at high risk for hypertrophic and keloid scar formation. Using the LMTK cell line, a line of murine subcutaneous fibroblasts, the effect of Vorinostat on Tgf-β and TGIF expression as well as cell proliferation was assessed. Based on previous studies, by comparing test groups of a low-dose and high-dose of Vorinostat to a control over a period of 72 hours, it is expected that we will find Vorinostat to have significantly decreased the expression of Tgf-β and increased the expression of TGIF-1 and TGIF-2, while also decreasing the rate of proliferation in the LMTK cells. These findings suggest that further investigation of Vorinostat in the cells involved in tissue healing processes could lead to a better understanding of the Smad pathways and opportunities for more comprehensive treatment options for those at high-risk of abnormal scar formation.\n\nBiography: Noah Knick is biology major from Fairfield, VA.

TNB cells do not express the estrogen receptor, the progesterone receptor, and has very little expression of the human epidermal growth receptor, HER2, which are common targets of breast cancer therapies. This cancer can become metastatic very quickly, so the only treatment options that help to prolong the patient’s life is a lumpectomy, or a mastectomy, which give very low survival rates, with high levels of reoccurrence. miRNA 342-3p is a type of miRNA that suppress the proliferation of human breast cancer cells, as it targets the Cofflin 1 protein. miRNA 342-3p has been tested on lymphoma, and has had positive outcomes with slowing down the proliferation rate of those lymphoma cells. miRNA 342-3p however, has not been tested on TNBC. This experiment will test the effect of exogeneous overexpression of miRNA 342-3p on the proliferation of TNBC cell line MDA-MB 231. After transfection with an expression plasmid containing miRNA 342-3p, the cells will be monitored and counted at specific time points to see if cell proliferation is reduced. In this study, we hope to see the cell proliferation decrease with the addition of miRNA. With the success of this experiment, it will give an insight into the value of using miRNA as potential therapeutics for Triple Negative Breast Cancer.\n\nBiography: Haley Roberts is a biology major, with a minor in psychology, and a biomedical emphasis.

Many communities around the world experience struggles that shape them into who they are. More specifically, the Shenandoah Valley is full of children who face challenges in many different ways. It is known that two in every five children are economically disadvantaged in the Valley Region which totals up to over 65,000 children in the local area (Vakids). This means 11% of Virginia’s economically disadvantaged children come from the Shenandoah Valley (Vakids). However, my client for this campaign, Action For All, understands these statistics and has been working to develop solutions through the community. Building an integrated marketing and communications campaign will help focus on creating partnership opportunities to build brand awareness, while also refining the ways of fundraising through social media in order to expand the chance for underprivileged kids to develop skills and participate in action sports. The campaign has a slogan of “taking a step in action” to influence the youth and community supporters to effectively jump into the mission with confidence and trust. An effective marketing campaign will be done by involving methods of social media engagement, donation periods, marketing lists, community workshops, and invitational partnership outreach. This campaign will include the organizational background, future goals, limits, and address its challenges in order to create the best possible solution through the campaign.\n\nBiography: Quentin Hart is a student athlete majoring in marketing and communications with a minor in Business.

For this project I have created a film based on my mother’s upbringing, as well as how she came to fall in love with my father and the challenges they faced living in Mexico, including poverty, machismo, and displacement. This video will be filmed in a style similar to a movie/dramatic documentary that briefly follows the life of Luz Maria, the youngest of four siblings living in poverty in Mexico. The film will incorporate various styles of music from Mexico and music that they heard during this time. Even though I grew up listening to this music, I’ve recently had a newfound interest in researching these styles, such as Trios Mexicanos, Rancheras, Corridos, and Grupera. They are undeniable staples of the culture that my family has grown up with and has passed down through generations.\n\nThe film will be accompanied by a paper that focuses specifically on the structures of the music. I will analyze the forms common for these styles as well as chord structures and how they compare to structures of popular music in the United States.\n\nBiography: Juan Martinez-Yobal is a music major with a music education Minor from Richmond, Virginia.

In order to keep the musical integrity of each piece, it is important to be aware of the musical characteristics and techniques required. Exploring these different styles as a music student has allowed me to grow as a musician and discover which styles best suit my voice. For this Capstone presentation, I have chosen three selections from various eras and genres, from the Baroque Era to the Modern Era. “Che si può fare?” is by Barbara Strozzi, a well-known female composer from the Early Baroque Era. Strozzi composed many secular cantatas, which is a genre of vocal music that consists of a solo voice line and a basso continuo. “Widmung” by Robert Schumann is a Romantic Era Lied. Lied, or “Art Song,” is a German genre for solo voice and piano. Schumann is one of the faces of Romantic era music; the development of Romantic music led to more dramatic text settings, vivid word painting, fuller accompaniment sound, and a stronger emphasis on the tools the singer can utilize to create drama. “Mignonette” by Victor Herbert is a more modern piece that was from the original version of one of Herbert’s well-known operettas, Babes in Toyland. This piece, written in 1903, is a good example of operetta (“light opera”). Vocal music does not fit a singular mold; there are countless genres spanning hundreds of years, and my presentation highlights just a few of the many examples.\n\nBiography: Kallie Parsons is a music major with a concentration in vocal performance from Lugoff, South Carolina.

This has led me to explore, investigate, and appreciate the cultural nuances pertaining to my familial cultures. My thesis seeks to enhance diverse narratives within African American and Filipino communities by visually showcasing stories of legend, history, and contemporary moments through differing aesthetic choices. My work shows a multifaceted confidence in artistic expression and storytelling, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in these stories while also challenging the ways these different narratives can be represented visually.\n\nBy working on my thesis project, I was able to answer: Can content be framed within varying stylistic choices and successfully portray a specific narrative? Can cultural stories be universally understood with or without a significant understanding of cultural subtext? How can abstract portrayals of the human form impact perceptions of identity and sense of self? While working in my studio, I was able to collect qualitative data by using personal reflection, oral discussion with other people with intersecting experiences and identities, and researching histories and mythologies. As I took an autoethnographic approach to my work, I became a key participant, engaging in decolonizing and critical feminist research methods.\n\nThis body of work contains acrylic paintings made and displayed on found materials as well as digital illustrations. My artistic influence is drawn from artists such as Bisa Butler, Caroline Liu, Kehinde Wiley, Sam Cox, Andrew Davis, and Raphael. Many stylistic elements in my work, such as bright colors and bold linework are pulled from works of fiction, such as comics and animation. I enjoy illustrating the subject matter of people because I believe one can be influenced by artistic portrayals of the differing yet similar experiences of various individuals. Overall, I want my show to evoke a wide range of thoughts from viewers, allowing those who identify with the people from these narratives to be recognized, while also allowing people outside of these cultures to gain insight into these specific perspectives and experiences.\n\nBiography: Charlotte Bradley is a studio art major with a minor in marketing from Stafford, Virginia.

There is a divide that occurs as a result of individuals making mistakes and creating a juvenile record where youth are judged for a past action. I believe that a past mistake should not dictate a youth’s character or future opportunities. This is why I want to allow youth and parents to be provided with a list of resources and opportunities within the Staunton area that allow at-risk youth to avoid further trouble and be given a second chance to improve their future. I believe that due to this being a small community, youth have a harder time with being able to express themselves and enjoy their hobbies due to a lot of stores being closed early. The purpose behind juvenile detention centers is to help at-risk youth avoid further involvement within the criminal justice system. However, when left unattended, youth often get themselves into more trouble. Providing resources and opportunities to youth creates a stronger community and development of community service, deeper relationships, mentorships, and life skills that can help set juveniles on the correct path. By being able to connect non-profit organizations, local police officers, members of the court services, and individuals within the Staunton community, I believe it would be beneficial to create a stronger and healthier bond to prevent further damage to the community. The only way I see this change being possible is by bringing all of the resources that the majority of families do not have accessibility to, into a more accessible and community-based area. When a juvenile is deemed at-risk there should be alternatives present, that may prevent youth from being labeled a risk in the first place. Prevention should be the first goal with youth in the Staunton community, not an afterthought.\n\nBiography: Brianna Allen-Thompson is a psychology major with a minor in criminal justice.

To Cuts of Creativity, an autoethnography approach is taken to understanding gallery work as a collaborative and community building effort through my experience interning at the MBU Hunt Gallery. A reevaluation on the goals and value of the gallery are explored in the umbrella of the larger changes being faced by the Mary Baldwin community and the gallery community as a whole.\n\nWe Are Here! Brings to the light the value of artistic individuals that are representative of MBU’s past, present, and future. Collaboration, support, and creating community with fellow artists were key findings for this exhibition. Place Setting by Hsini Des allowed further reflection and thoughts on comparisons and similarities. Bottlecaps & Breadcrumbs by Travis Head exposed creative collectives and working with fellow artists, as well as new media and different forms of success.\n\nRe-evaluations of goals for the gallery include taking a transdisciplinary and transcultural approach to gallery experiences, structures, and exhibitions. It is also important for the gallery to be a portal to the art community for students and the MBU community while balancing diverse audiences. Components of education and interpretation are an important part of keeping Hunt Gallery as a learning gallery. An advisory committee is proposed of cross-disciplinary nature to evaluate possible exhibitions in order to obtain these values across the programming.\n\nThe BAAAR exhibition, Stories and Histories, showcased a collective of artists’ works across the Richmond area. This exhibition allowed previously underserved stakeholders a chance to engage with art that was representative of their background and life. The exhibition was in the news, with interviews from studio art students, which led to students from a local high school to visit and take a tour with MBU students of the show, some of these students being in a gallery for the first time. A Lunch & Learn mentoring session was also created for students to interact with nine visiting BAAAR artists. In collaboration with film professors and students, a studio art student was able to create a storytelling video interview of the visiting artists.\n\nThe Cuts of Creativity All-MBU Exhibition was created to bring together Mary Baldwin’s creatives. From students, staff, and faculty, everyone was welcome to register creative work of all media. This exhibition was a chance for artists to showcase their work and create a more tightly sewn community. Many opportunities were opened up as more creatives engaged with the exhibit.The exhibition was also an opportunity for live research, seeing what the MBU community cared about and was interested in. This research can then be applied to future exhibitions. The final interning work focused on two co-artist senior thesis exhibitions which allowed an opportunity for peer-to-peer support and teaching.\n\nThe experience working in Hunt Gallery has led me to learn about the history of galleries and think about how galleries can be shifted from a high society, exclusionary model to an experience much like that of third places, where communities can gather, learn, reflect, and discuss. By shifting the goals and values of these galleries, opportunities for community building become abundant.\n\nBiography: Grace Gardner is a double major in studio art and business sustainability.

Given the current data presented, SAAC has strength in their governance, workers, and community outreach. They can make improvements within stakeholder engagement and satisfaction, as well as collecting more data on their impacts.\n\nWith the current analysis, it is indicated that the organization should focus on improving their social impact by diversifying decision making and improving stakeholder engagement. After thorough analysis of time and financial cost of possible actions that the organization can take to create these improvements, three actionable changes are suggested. This includes engaging more community partners, other organizations or individuals who can collaborate and gain access to underserved stakeholders. A Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Advisory Board is als recommended to engage diverse stakeholders in the governance of SAAC. Post-Program Surveys were also recommended, as a quick and efficient way to collect data and analyze the current stakeholders satisfaction with programs that the organization is holding. A proposed timeline was then provided to describe the time and effort that each recommendation would take.\n\nKeywords: social impact, sustainable analysis, business sustainability, non-profits, stakeholder engagement, B Impact assessment, Global Reporting Initiative\n\nBiography: Grace Gardner is a Senior dual majoring in Business in Sustainability and Studio Art.

He is best known for his works of musical theater. Brown’s musical style is immediately recognizable across his theatrical works, and it stands apart from that of his contemporaries. Even though his first three shows, Songs for a New World, Parade, and The Last Five Years vary greatly in form and scale, all three demonstrate his unique style, and include notable female characters whose songs have become important to the American musical theater canon. These songs sung by female characters also provide an insightful look into the composer’s style. Brown’s works are known for vocal and instrumental complexity, unique harmonies, striking rhythms, and evocative musical imagery. His music transcends the conventions of contemporary musical theater, with recognizable influences of jazz, Golden Age theater, and rock. This paper presents an analysis of Brown’s musical style as demonstrated in the songs performed by female characters, particularly those found in his first three major works, Songs for a New World, Parade, and The Last Five Years. The paper also includes the musical influences that helped him develop his skills as a composer, lyricist, and pianist, as well as an overview of Jason Robert Brown’s life and career so far.\n\nBiography: Maia Adolphs is a music major from Galveston, Texas.

To collect and gather data, a mixed-methods approach was used that allowed for a comparison of the two departments to take place. Quantitative data was collected through a survey sent out to all sworn officers at each department, which included using a revised version of the Symptom-Checklist-90 (SCL-90). Qualitative data was collected through an interview that assessed select participants’ personal mental health in relation to their role as a law enforcement officer, their approaches to addressing mental health concerns, and a deeper discussion on their opinion of utilizing resources. It was found that over 75% of survey respondents do not use any provided mental health resources, and only a small percentage utilize resources outside the department. The results indicated that most officers either did not feel the need to use any mental health resource or did not trust or feel that the resources were adequate for their mental health needs.\n\nBiography: Teegan Lewis is a criminal justice major with a minor in psychology and homeland security from Opp, Alabama.

There is an overwhelming disparity in diversity among museum attendees regarding race, class, and education. This disparity is even reflected in an organizational structure with less than 35% of people of color representing leadership in various departments. At the same time, 84% of attendees identify as white. Copious deterring factors may cause these disparities. Such as lack of representation and inclusivity in art and staffing. As well as the outdated Euro-centric perceptions of museums. The changing cultural and environmental expectations raise concerns about organizational sustainability. To explore qualitative and quantitative research, it was conducted via demographic survey and interviews both psycho-graphically and organizationally. The results showed a significant relationship in various categories, including art interest, socioeconomic and racial separation, and other deterring attendance factors. Increasing inclusivity, diversity, and authenticity will open many opportunities for museums and galleries. There is potential for everyone from elite institutions to grassroots to strive for inclusivity, challenging the status quo and paving a path towards a more equitable future—one where every voice finds resonance in and outside the gallery.\n\nKeywords: Museum attendance, Diversity, Inclusivity, Intersectionality, Sustainability\n\nBiography: Ki’Jah Wilburn is a Arts Management major with a double concentration in Art history and Theater( as well as a minor in psychology).
