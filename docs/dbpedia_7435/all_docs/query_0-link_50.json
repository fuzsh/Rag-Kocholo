Click on a region to view information about upcoming meetings, project schedules, opportunities for public comment, and much more.\n\nEducational Tools\n\nPublic involvement is an integral part of the transportation development process. Input received from the public during the preliminary engineering phase of project development influences the ultimate outcome of any project. SCDOT's mission is to find solutions that provide adequate, safe, and efficient transportation services for the public that minimize impacts to the human and natural environment. To learn more about the transportation decision making process and other considerations that are made during project development, please take an opportunity to watch the educational videos provided below.\n\nVideos\n\nNEPA and the Transportation Decision Making Process\n\nHighway Traffic Noise\n\nHydrology Considerations on SCDOT Projects"
