        "text": "Poetry collection by Seamus Heaney\n\nDistrict and Circle is a poetry collection by Seamus Heaney, who received the 1995 Nobel Prize in Literature. It was published in 2006 and won the 2006 T. S. Eliot Prize, the most prestigious poetry award in the UK.[1][2] The collection also won the Irish Times \"Poetry Now Award\".[note 1]\n\nReporting on the Eliot Prize, the BBC commented in 2007, \"The award is yet more confirmation, as if it was needed, of Heaney's reputation as, arguably, the English language's greatest living bard, whom author Malcolm Bradbury once described as 'the poet of poets'.\" In 2013, Heaney's volumes made up two-thirds of the sales of living poets in Britain.[4]\n\nThe poet dedicated District and Circle[note 2] to the Canadian professor of Irish Studies Ann Saddlemyer.[5] Heaney has been recorded reading this collection on the Seamus Heaney Collected Poems album.\n\nContents\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Turnip-Snedder\n\nShiver\n\nPolish Sleepers\n\nAnahorish 1944\n\nTo Mick Joyce in Heaven\n\nThe Aerodrome\n\nAnything Can Happen\n\nHelmet\n\nOut of Shot\n\nRilke: After the Fire\n\nDistrict and Circle\n\nTo George Seferis in the Underworld\n\nWordsworth's Skates\n\nThe Harrow-Pin\n\nPoet to Blacksmith\n\nMidnight Anvil\n\nSúgán\n\nSenior Infants 1.

The book does not merely dig in, but digs deep.\"[8] The poet and critic Stephanie Burt also praised the book, writing that \"anyone who isn’t impressed isn’t listening.\"[9] Brad Leithauser, in The New York Times, praised Heaney for \"saying something extraordinary while, line by line, conveying a sense that this is something an ordinary person might actually say\".[10]\n\nThe critic Peter McDonald said \"The book contains marvellous prose-poems on the peopled landscapes of his schooldays, along with sonnets - seemingly effortless in their sheer fluency, but memorably tough and intent\".[11] Stephen Knight wrote that District and Circle was not \"as immediate as his earlier work,\" but he still considered the book to be successful on its own terms, characterizing it as \"a late flowering.\"[12]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
