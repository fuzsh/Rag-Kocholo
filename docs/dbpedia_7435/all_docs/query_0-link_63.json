        "text": "Page Content\n\nGuided reading is an instructional practice or approach where teachers support a small group of students to read a text independently.\n\nKey elements of guided reading\n\nGuided reading sessions are made up of three parts:\n\nbefore reading discussion\n\nindependent reading\n\nafter reading discussion\n\nThe main goal of guided reading is to teach students to use strategies for reading that enable successful independent reading for meaning.\n\nWhy use guided reading\n\nGuided reading is informed by Vygotsky’s (1978) Zone of Proximal Development and Bruner’s (1986) notion of scaffolding, informed by Vygotsky’s research. The practice of guided reading is based on the belief that the optimal learning for a reader occurs when they are assisted by an educator, or expert ‘other’, to read and understand a text with clear but limited guidance. Guided reading allows students to practise and consolidate effective reading strategies.\n\nVygotsky was particularly interested in the ways children were challenged and extended in their learning by adults. He argued that the most successful learning occurs when children are guided by adults towards learning things that they could not attempt on their own.\n\nVygotsky coined the phrase 'Zone of Proximal Development' to refer to the zone where teachers and students work as children move towards independence. This zone changes as teachers and students move past their present level of development towards new learning.\n\nGuided reading helps students develop greater control over the reading process through the development of reading strategies which assist decoding and construct meaning. The teacher guides or ‘scaffolds’ their students as they read, talk and think their way through a text.\n\nThis guidance or ‘scaffolding’ has been described by Christie (2005) as a metaphor taken from the building industry. It refers to the way scaffolds sustain and support people who are constructing a building.\n\nThe scaffolds are withdrawn once the building has taken shape and is able to support itself independently (pp. 42-43). Similarly, the teacher places temporary supports around a text such as:\n\nfrontloading new or technical vocabulary\n\nhighlighting the language structures or features of a text\n\nfocusing on a decoding strategy that will be useful when reading\n\nteaching fluency and/or\n\npromoting the different levels of comprehension – literal, inferential, evaluative.\n\nOnce the strategies have been practised and are internalised, the teacher withdraws the support (or scaffold) and the reader can experience reading success independently (Bruner, 1986, p.76).\n\nGuided reading is a practice which promotes opportunities for the development of a self-extending system. When readers are guided to talk, think and read their way through a text, they build up a self-extending system, so that every time reading occurs, more learning about reading ensues (Ford and Opitz, 2011).\n\nTeacher’s role in guided reading\n\nTeachers select texts to match the needs of the group so that the students, with specific guidance, are supported to read sections or whole texts independently.\n\nStudents are organised into groups based on similar reading ability and/or similar learning needs determined through analysis of assessment tools such as reading conference notes and anecdotal records.\n\nEvery student has a copy of the same text and all students work individually, reading quietly or silently.\n\nSelecting texts for EAL/D learners\n\nUnderstanding EAL/D students’ strengths and learning needs in the Reading and Viewing mode will help with appropriate text selection. Teachers consider a range of factors in selecting texts for EAL/D students including:\n\ncontent which connects to prior knowledge and experiences, including culturally familiar contexts, characters or settings\n\ncontent which introduces engaging and useful new knowledge, such as contemporary Australian settings and themes\n\ncontent which prepares students for future learning, e.g. reading a narrative about a penguin prior to a science topic about animal adaptations\n\nlanguage at an accessible but challenging level ('just right' texts)\n\navailability of support resources such as audio versions or translations of the text\n\ntexts with a distinctive beat, rhyming words or a combination of direct and indirect speech to assist with pronunciation and prosody\n\nthe difficulty of the sentence structures or grammatical features in the selected text. Ideally, students read texts that have some challenge, but that they can read well enough to comprehend the text. This is not always feasible, particularly at the higher levels of primary school. If the text is difficult, the teacher could modify the text or focus the reading on a section before expecting them to read the whole text.\n\nStudents also need repeated exposure to new text structures and grammatical features to extend their language learning, such as texts with:\n\ndifferent layouts and organisational features\n\ndifferent sentence lengths\n\nsimple, compound or complex sentences\n\na wide range of verb tenses used\n\na range of complex word groups (noun groups, verb groups, adjectival groups)\n\ndirect and indirect speech\n\npassive voice, e.g. Wheat is harvested in early autumn, before being transported to silos.\n\nnominalisation (where a verb takes on the characteristics of a noun), e.g. The presentation of awards will take place at 8pm.\n\nEAL/D students learn about the grammatical features as they arise in authentic texts. For example, learning about the form and function of passive sentences when reading an exposition text, and subsequently writing their own passive sentences.\n\nAll students in the class including EAL/D students will typically identify a learning goal for reading. Like all students, the learning needs of each EAL/D student will be different. Some goals may be related to the student’s prior experience with literacy practices, such as:\n\nways to incorporate reading into daily life at home\n\ndeveloping stamina to read for longer periods of time\n\ndeveloping fluency to enable students to read longer texts with less effort.\n\nSome goals may be related to the nature of students’ home language(s):\n\nlearning to perceive, read and pronounce particular sounds that are not part of the home language, for example, in Korean there is no /f/ sound\n\nlearning the direction of reading or the form of letters\n\nlearning to recognise different word forms such as verb tense or plural if they are not part of the home language.\n\nFor more information on appropriate texts for EAL/D students, see: Languages and Multicultural Education Resource Centre\n\nMajor focuses for a teacher to consider in a guided reading lesson:\n\nBefore reading the teacher can\n\nactivate prior knowledge of the topic\n\nencourage student predictions\n\nset the scene by briefly summarising the plot\n\ndemonstrate the kind of questions readers ask about a text\n\nidentify the pivotal pages in the text that contain the meaning and ‘walk’ through the students through them\n\nintroduce any new vocabulary or literary language relevant to the text\n\nlocate something missing in the text and match to letters and sounds\n\nclarify meaning\n\nbring to attention relevant text layout, punctuation, chapter headings, illustrations, index or glossary\n\nclearly articulate the learning intention (i.e. what reading strategy students will focus on to help them read the text)\n\ndiscuss the success criteria (e.g. you will know you have learnt to ….. by ………).\n\nDuring reading the teacher can\n\n‘listen in’ to individual students\n\nobserve the reader’s behaviours for evidence of strategy use\n\nassist a student to monitor meaning using phonic, semantic, contextual and grammatical knowledge\n\nconfirm a student’s word problem-solving attempts and successes\n\ngive timely and specific feedback to help students achieve the lesson focus\n\nmake notes about the strategies individual students are using to inform future planning and student goal setting. See Teacher's role during reading).\n\nAfter reading the teacher can\n\ntalk about the text with the students\n\ninvite personal responses such as asking students to make connections to themselves, other texts or world knowledge\n\nreturn to the text to clarify or identify a decoding teaching opportunity such as the revision of phoneme-grapheme correspondence blending or segmenting\n\ncheck a student understands what they have read by asking them to sequence, retell or summarise the text\n\ndevelop an understanding of an author’s intent and awareness of conflicting interpretations of text\n\nask questions about the text or encourage students to ask questions of each other\n\ndevelop insights into characters, settings and themes\n\nfocus on aspects of text organisation such as characteristics of a non-fiction text\n\nrevisit the learning focus and encourage students to reflect on whether they achieved the success criteria.\n\nThe teacher selects a text for a guided reading group by matching it to the learning needs of the small group. The learning focus is identified through observation of the student reading, individual conference notes or anecdotal records.\n\nAdditional focuses for a teacher to consider for EAL/D students in a guided reading lesson\n\nBefore reading a fictional text, the teacher can\n\norientate students to the text. Discuss the title, illustrations, and blurb, or look at the titles of the chapters if reading a chaptered book\n\nactivate students’ prior knowledge about language related to the text. This could involve asking students to label images or translate vocabulary. Students could do this independently, with same-language peers, family members or Multicultural Education Aides, if available\n\nuse relevant artefacts or pictures to elicit language and knowledge from the students and encourage prediction and connections with similar texts.\n\nBefore reading a factual text, the teacher can\n\nsupport students to brainstorm and categorise words and phrases related to the topic\n\nprovide a structured overview of the features of a selected text, for example, the main heading, sub headings, captions or diagrams\n\nsupport students to skim and scan to get an overview of the text or a specific piece of information\n\nsupport students to identify the text type, its purpose and language structures and features.\n\nDuring reading the teacher can\n\ntalk to EAL/D students about strategies they use when reading in their home language and encourage them to use them in reading English texts. Teachers can note these down and encourage other students to try them.\n\nAfter reading the teacher can\n\nencourage EAL/D students to use their home language with a peer (if available) to discuss a response to a teacher prompt and then ask the students to share their ideas in English\n\nrecord student contributions as pictures (e.g. a story map) or in English so that all students can understand\n\ncreate practise tasks focusing on particular sentence structures from the text\n\nset review tasks in both English and home language. Home language tasks based on personal reflection can help students develop depth to their responses. English language tasks may emphasise learning how to use language from the text or the language of response\n\nask students to practise reading the text aloud to a peer to practise fluency\n\nask students to create a bilingual version of the text to share with their family or younger students in the school\n\nask students to innovate on the text by changing the setting to a place in their home country and altering some or all of the necessary elements.\n\nInferring meaning\n\nIn this video the teacher leads an after reading discussion with a small group of students to check their comprehension of the text. The students re-read the text together. Prior to this session the children have had the opportunity to read the text independently and work with the teacher individually at their point of need.\n\nPoint of view\n\nIn this video, the teacher leads a guided reading lesson on point of view, with a group of Level 3 students.\n\nText selection\n\nThe teacher selects a text for a guided reading group by matching it to the learning needs of the small group. The learning focus is identified through:\n\nobservation of the student/s reading\n\nindividual conference notes\n\nor anecdotal records.\n\nText selection\n\nThe text chosen for the small group instruction will depend on the teaching purpose. For example, if the purpose is to:\n\ndemonstrate directionality - the teacher will ensure that the text has a return sweep\n\npredict using the title and illustrations - the text chosen must support this\n\nmake inferences - a text where students can use their background knowledge of a topic in conjunction with identifiable text clues to support inference making.\n\nText selection should include a range of:\n\ngenres\n\ntexts of varying length and\n\ntexts that span different topics.\n\nIt is important that the teacher reads the text before the guided reading session to identify the gist of the text, key vocabulary and text organisation. A learning focus for the guided reading session must be determined before the session. It is recommended that teachers prepare and document their thinking in their weekly planning so that the teaching can be made explicit for their students as illustrated in the examples in the information below.\n\nExample 1\n\nStudents\n\nJessie, Rose, Van, Mohamed, Rachel, Candan\n\nText/Level\n\nTadpoles and Frogs, Author Jenny Feely, Program AlphaKids published by Eleanor Curtain Publishing Pty Ltd. ©EC Licensing Pty Ltd. (Level 5)\n\nLearning Intention\n\nWe are learning to read with phrasing and fluency.\n\nSuccess criteria\n\nI can use the grouped words on each line of text to help me read with phrasing.\n\nWhy phrase\n\nPhrasing helps the reader to understand the text through the grouping of words into meaningful chunks.\n\nAn example of guided reading planning and thinking recorded in a teacher’s weekly program (See Guided Reading Lesson: Reading with phrasing and fluency).\n\nExample 2\n\nStudents\n\nMustafa, Dylan, Rosita, Lillian, Cedra\n\nText/Level\n\nThe Merry Go Round – PM Red, Beverley Randell, Illustrations Elspeth Lacey ©1993.

(Text clue) Can you look at Nick’s body language on page11? Page 16? What do you notice? (Text clues) Why does Nick choose to ride up on the horse rather than the car or plane? (Background information on siblings, family dynamics and stereotypes about gender choices).\n\nAn example of the scaffolding required to assist early readers to answer an inferential question.

This planning is recorded in the teacher’s weekly program.\n\nIt's important to choose a range of text types so that students’ reading experiences are not restricted.\n\nQuality literature\n\nQuality literature is highly motivating to both students and teachers. Students prefer to learn with these texts and given the opportunity will choose these texts over traditional ‘readers’ (McCarthey, Hoffman & Galda, 1999, p.51).\n\nResearch\n\nResearch suggests the quality and range of books to which students are exposed to such as:\n\nelectronic texts\n\ndecodable texts\n\nstudent/teacher published work\n\npicture books\n\ninformation texts\n\nrecipes\n\nnewspaper articles.\n\nStudents need to have access in the classroom to the full range of genres we want them to comprehend (Duke, Pearson, Strachan & Billman, 2011, p. 59). A variety of authentic text types as well as decodable texts addressing the students current reading need and the identified instructional purpose, need to be to be read and explicitly taught.\n\nConsiderations\n\nWhen selecting texts for teaching purposes include: levels of text difficulty and text characteristics such as:\n\nthe length\n\nthe degree of detail and complexity and familiarity of the concepts\n\nthe support provided by the illustrations\n\nthe complexity of the sentence structure and vocabulary\n\nthe size and placement of the text\n\nstudents’ reading behaviours\n\nstudents’ interests and experiences including home literacies and sociocultural practices\n\ntexts that promote engagement and enjoyment.\n\nFor ideas about selecting literature for EAL/D learners, see: Literature\n\nTeacher's role during reading\n\nDuring the reading stage, it is helpful for the teacher to keep anecdotal records on what strategies their students are using independently or with some assistance. Comments are usually linked to the learning focus but can also include an insightful moment or learning gap.\n\nLearning example\n\nStudents\n\nJessie\n\nfinger tracking text\n\nuses some expression\n\nnot pausing at punctuation\n\nsome phrasing but still some word by word.\n\nRose\n\nfinger tracking text\n\nreading sounds smooth.\n\nVan\n\nreads with expression\n\nre-reads for fluency.\n\nMohamed\n\nuses pictures to help decoding\n\nword by word reading\n\nbetter after some modelling of phrasing.\n\nRachel\n\ntracks text with her eyes\n\ngroups words based on text layout\n\npauses at full stops.\n\nCandan\n\nrecognises commas and pauses briefly when reading clauses\n\nreads with expression.\n\nTeacher anecdotal records template example\n\nExplicit teaching and responses\n\nThere are a number of points during the guided reading session where the teacher has an opportunity to provide feedback to students, individually or as a small group. To execute this successfully, teachers must be aware of the prompts and feedback they give.\n\nSpecific and focused feedback will ensure that students are receiving targeted strategies about what they need for future reading successes, see Guided Reading: Text Selection; Guided Reading: Teacher’s Role.\n\nExamples of specific feedback\n\nI really liked the way you grouped those words together to make your reading sound phrased. Did it help you understand what you read? (using meaning and visual or print information)\n\nCan you go back and reread this sentence? I want you to look carefully at the whole word here (the beginning, middle and end). What do you notice? (using visual or print information)\n\nAs this is a long word, can you break it up into syllables to try and work it out? Show me where you would make the breaks. (using visual or print information)\n\nIt is important to pause at punctuation to help you understand the text. Can you go back and reread this page? This time I want you to concentrate on pausing at the full stops and commas (using visual or print information and meaning)\n\nLook at the word closely. I can see it starts with a digraph you know. What sound does it make? Does that help you work out the word? (using visual or print information, using phonic knowledge and skills).\n\nThis page is written in past tense. What morpheme would you expect to see on the end of verbs? Can you check? (using visual and structural or grammatical information)\n\nDid what you read make sense? When you read something that does not make sense, you need to go back and reread, looking carefully at the words and letters to decode a word that does make sense (using visual or print information and meaning).\n\nProviding feedback to EAL/D learners\n\nSpecific feedback for EAL/D students may involve and build on transferable skills and knowledge they gained from reading in another language.\n\nI can see you were thinking carefully about the meaning of that word. What information from the book did you use to help you work out the meaning?\n\nDo you know this word in your home language? Let’s look it up in the bilingual dictionary to see what it means.\n\nReading independently\n\nIndependent reading promotes active problem solving and higher-order cognitive processes (Krashen, 2004). It is these processes which equip each student to read increasingly more complex texts over time; “resulting in better reading comprehension, writing style, vocabulary, spelling and grammatical development” (Krashen, 2004, p. 17).\n\nIt is important to note that guided reading is not the same as round robin reading. When students are reading during the independent reading stage, all children must have a copy of the text and individually read the whole text or a meaningful segment of a text (e.g. a chapter) quietly aloud to themselves while the teacher listens and observes individual students reading.\n\nStudents also have an important role in guided reading as the teacher supports them to practise and further explore important reading strategies.\n\nBefore reading the student can\n\nengage in a conversation about the new text\n\nmake predictions based on title, front cover, illustrations, text layout\n\nactivate their prior knowledge (what do they already know about the topic? what vocabulary would they expect to see?)\n\nask questions\n\nlocate new vocabulary/literary language in text\n\narticulate new vocabulary and match to letters/sounds\n\narticulate learning intention and discuss success criteria.\n\nDuring reading the student can\n\nread the whole text or section of text to themselves\n\nuse concepts of print to assist their reading\n\nuse pictures and/or diagrams to assist with developing meaning\n\nproblem solve using the sources of information - the use of meaning, (does it make sense?) structure (can we say it that way?) and visual information (sounds, letters, words) on extended text (Department of Education, 1997)\n\nrecognise high frequency words\n\nrecognise and use new vocabulary introduced in the before reading discussion segment\n\nuse text user skills to help read different types of text\n\nread aloud with fluency when the teacher ‘listens in’\n\nread the text more than once to establish meaning or fluency\n\nread the text a second or third time with a partner.\n\nAfter reading the student can\n\nbe prepared to talk about the text\n\ndiscuss the problem solving strategies they used to monitor their reading\n\nrevisit the text to further problem solve as guided by the teacher\n\ncompare text outcomes to earlier predictions\n\nask and answer questions about the text from the teacher and group members\n\nsummarise or synthesise information\n\ndiscuss the author’s purpose\n\nthink critically about a text\n\nmake connections between the text and self, text to text and text to world.\n\nAdditional focuses for EAL/D students when reading independently\n\nBefore reading the student can:\n\nactivate their home language knowledge. What home language words related to this topic do they know?\n\nDuring reading the student can:\n\nrefer to vocabulary charts or glossaries in the classroom to help them recognise and recall the meaning of words learnt before reading the text\n\nuse home language resources to help them understand words in the text. For example, translated word charts, bilingual dictionaries, same-language peers or family members.\n\nAfter reading the student can:\n\nsummarise the text using a range of meaning-making systems including English, home language and images.\n\nTeacher anecdotal records template example\n\nPeer observation of guided reading practice (for teachers)\n\nProviding opportunities for teachers to learn about teaching practices, sharing of evidence-based methods and finding out what is working and for whom, all contribute to developing a culture that will make a difference to student outcomes (Hattie, 2009, pp. 241-242).\n\nWhen there has been dedicated and strategic work by a Principal and the leadership team to set learning goals and targeted focuses, teachers have clear direction about what to expect and how to go about successfully implementing core teaching and learning practices.\n\nOne way to monitor the growth of teacher capacity and whether new learning has become embedded is by setting up peer observations with colleagues. It is a valuable tool to contribute to informed, whole-school approaches to teaching and learning.\n\nThe focus of the peer observation must be determined before the practice takes place. This ensures all participants in the process are clear about the intention. Peer observations will only be successful if they are viewed as a collegiate activity based on trust.\n\nAccording to Bryk and Schneider, high levels of “trust reduce the sense of vulnerability that teachers experience as they take on new and uncertain tasks associated with reform” and help ensure the feedback after an observation is valued (as cited in Hattie, 2009, p. 241).\n\nTo improve the practice of guided reading, peer observations can be arranged across Year levels or within a Year level depending on the focus. A framework for the observations is useful so that both parties know what it is that will be observed. It is important that the observer note down what they see and hear the teacher and the students say and do. Evidence must be tangible and not related to opinion, bias or interpretation (Danielson, 2012).\n\nExamples of evidence relating to the guided reading practice might be:\n\nthe words the teacher says (Today’s learning intention is to focus on making sure our reading makes sense. If it doesn’t, we need to reread and use our reading strategies to decode the tricky word)\n\nthe words the students say (e.g. 'My reading goal is to break up a word into smaller parts when I don’t know it to help me decode the word').\n\nthe actions of the teacher (Taking anecdotal notes as they listen to individual students read)\n\nwhat they can see the students doing (The group members all have their own copy of the text and read individually).\n\nNoting specific examples of engagement and practice and using a reflective tool allows reviewers to provide feedback that is targeted to the evidence rather than the personality. Finding time for face-to-face feedback is a vital stage in peer observation. Danielson argues that “the conversations following an observation are the best opportunity to engage teachers in thinking through how they can strengthen their practice” (2012, p.36).\n\nIt's through collaborative reflection and evaluation that teaching and learning goals and the embedding of new practice takes place (Principles of Learning and Teaching [PoLT]: Action Research Model).\n\nTeacher Observation template example\n\nIn practice examples\n\nFor in practice examples, see: Guided reading lessons\n\nReferences\n\nBruner, J.
