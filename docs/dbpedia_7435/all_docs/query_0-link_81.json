Check out the link conversions to find what you are looking for. If you are still unable to find the information you are looking for, submit a question using the envelope in the top right.\n\nWhy can't I log in to my account?\n\nMost features of AviationWeather.gov do not require an account. If you recently signed up for a new account, please check your email (including spam folders) for a confirmation email. Accounts are generally approved within one or two business days.\n\nWhere is the METAR page?\n\nThe interactive Graphical Forecasts for Aviation observation tab displays METARs along with other current data including surface fronts and radar imagery. To view METARs alone, click on the Layers button at the top right corner of the map and deselect items you do not wish to view. Decoded METARs can be displayed by enabling the \"decoded METARs\" option in the Map Options under the gear icon on GFA.\n\nRaw and decoded textual METAR data can be displayed by selecting the Products dropdown and selecting METAR data.\n\nWhere is the Satellite/Radar page?\n\nSatellite and radar imagery are available on the observations tab of the interactive Graphical Forecasts for Aviation, that displays surface observations, imagery, fronts, and more in one place. Satellite imagery is an optional layer available from the layer selector in the upper right corner of the map. To display satellite or radar imagery alone, deselect items on the layer selector to simplify the display.\n\nHow can I submit PIREPs?\n\nSign up for an account on our registration page, select PIREP Submit Access, and be sure to include your airmen’s certificate number or affiliation with an airline, flight school, government or military organization for validation purposes to streamline the process. Accounts are validated via the FAA Airmen Inquiry.\n\nThen watch your email in order to verify your address and then confirming your account. Once you have an account and are logged in, select \"Submit a PIREP\" from the Tools dropdown and fill out the form. For more information on PIREP submit, use the link at the bottom, or click here.\n\nHow do I access the Flight Path Tool?\n\nThe flight path tool is now embedded into the interactive Graphical Forecasts for Aviation map. Click on the route button along the right side of the map to open the display. Enter the airports to navigate, and select the product you wish to display from the dropdown. Watch a video on how to use the cross sections here.\n\nWhere is the HEMS (Helicopter Emergency Medical Services) tool?\n\nThe HEMS tool has been integrated into the interactive Graphical Forecasts for Aviation. Click on the helicopter button in the upper right part of the map to switch GFA from general aviation mode into low-altitude mode, which offers similar features as the HEMS tool.\n\nWhat happened to ADDS?\n\nThe ADDS static graphics were phased out and replaced with the Graphical Forecasts for Aviation, which offers greater flexibility and configurability; some static graphics continue to be available for decision support. The ADDS Text Data Server has been succeeded by the Data API. Please let us know if you need assistance with the migration.\n\nHow can I display list of METARs and/of TAFs? What about decoded products?\n\nThe METAR and TAF data pages provide access to raw, tabular, and decoded output that automatically refreshes every five minutes. The page is designed for quick lookups and printability.\n\nWhere is the Text Data Server? How do I download METARs?\n\nThe Text Data Server was discontinued and has been replaced by the Data API. The new data offerings are more flexible and provide more data. Interfaces designed for greater compatibility with the Data Server to ease the transition as well as cache files to retrieve many reports at once are also available.\n\nHow do I access data for previous dates?\n\nThe METAR data page displays up to the previous 96 hours of observations. The Archive View allows viewing nearly all products on the site as they were presented for up to the past two weeks. For data more than 14 days old please reference the resources available on bottom of the Archive View page.\n\nData appears to be missing. Where can I find more information?\n\nAutomated status information and the latest announcements can be found on the status page\n\nWhy is a particular station not reporting?\n\nThe site generally displays all observations within a minute or two of being reported as we receive it. Individual station outages are usual indicative of a problem at the source. AWC does not maintain weather stations or observing platforms.\n\nWhat do all of the map symbols indicate?\n\nA full listing of map symbols is available.\n\nWhy is the map dark?\n\nDark mode is automatically applied based on systems settings. Selecting the person icon in the upper right and toggling the switch to the left disables this mode.\n\nHelp page links"
