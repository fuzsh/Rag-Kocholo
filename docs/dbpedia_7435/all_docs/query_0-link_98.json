Is a square a rectangle?Weird fun fact: what's the most rectangular shaped country in the world?Rectangle patternsRectangles in everyday life: rectangle body shape, rectangle pool, rectangle tablecloth...FAQs\n\nWhether you need to know the area of a carpet, a parcel, a TV screen, a rectangle pool, or a window, this area of a rectangle calculator will solve your problem in a blink of an eye!\n\nAll you have to do is input the length and width (or diagonal) and allow this rectangle calc to find the values of P (perimeter) and A (area).\n\nKeep reading if you want to understand what a rectangle is, you're interested in the rectangle definition, formulas, and properties of a rectangle... Or you just want to learn how to find the area of a rectangle.\n\nWhat is a rectangle?\n\nA rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. We may also define it in another way: a parallelogram containing a right angle – if one angle is right, the others must be the same. Moreover, each side of a rectangle has the same length as the one opposite to it. The adjacent sides need not be equal, in contrast to a square, which is a special case of a rectangle.\n\nIf you know some Latin, the name of a shape usually explains a lot. The word rectangle comes from the Latin rectangulus. It's a combination of rectus (which means \"right, straight\") and angulus (an angle), so it may serve as a simple, basic definition of a rectangle.\n\nA rectangle is an example of a quadrilateral. You can use our quadrilateral calculator to find the area of other types of quadrilateral.\n\nHow to find the area of a rectangle?\n\nThe image above shows a typical rectangle. It has four sides and four right angles. The lengths of its sides are denoted with a and b, while the length of the diagonal is denoted with d.\n\nIf all sides of the rectangle have equal lengths, we call it a square.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is a space restricted by its sides or, in other words, within the perimeter of a rectangle. To find the area of a rectangle, all you need to do is a multiplication of rectangular sides a and b:\n\nArea = a × b\n\nRectangle formulas\n\nOur rectangle calculator has the following formulas implemented:\n\nFor the area of a rectangle:\n\nA = a × b\n\nFor the perimeter of a rectangle:\n\nP = 2 × (a + b)\n\nFor the diagonal of a rectangle:\n\nd² = a² + b²\n\nd = √(a² + b²)\n\nRectangle calc: find A (area)\n\nAs we know the formula for the area of a rectangle A = a × b, let's show with an example how you can calculate that property:\n\nChoose the length of the rectangle – for example, a = 5 cm.\n\nDecide on the rectangle's width – for example, b = 6 cm.\n\nMultiply these two values: A = 5 cm × 6 cm = 30 cm².\n\nThe area of the rectangle is 30 cm².\n\nRectangle calc: find P (perimeter)\n\nLet's find out how to find the perimeter of a rectangle. As usual, the perimeter is a sum of all sides of a shape:\n\nP = a + b + a + b\n\n...which can be written as:\n\nP = 2 × (a + b)\n\nLet's take the same rectangle as an example:\n\nChoose the length of the rectangle – a = 5 cm in our case.\n\nDecide on the width of the rectangle – e.g., b = 6 cm.\n\nAdd these two values: a + b = 5 + 6 = 11 cm.\n\nMultiply the result by 2: P = 2 × 11 = 22 cm.\n\nHere we go! The perimeter of our rectangle is 22 cm.\n\nRectangle calc: find D (diagonal)\n\nThe diagonal of a rectangle is a segment that connects two opposite vertices of a rectangle. Let's calculate the diagonal length of the exemplary rectangle:\n\nChoose the length of the rectangle – for example, a = 5 cm.\n\nDecide on the rectangle's width – for example, b = 6 cm.\n\nCalculate a to the power of two: a² = 25 cm².\n\nCalculate b to the power of two: b² = 36 cm².\n\nAdd these two values: a² + b² = 25 + 36 = 61 cm².\n\nFinally, take the square root of the result: d = √(a² + b²) = √61 ~ 7.81 cm.\n\nThe length of the diagonal is 7.81 cm.\n\nNaturally, instead of calculating all of these values manually, you can use this area of a rectangle calculator. You can also use it in reverse – for example, to calculate the width of a rectangle with a known length and perimeter.\n\nGolden rectangle\n\nThe figure above shows a special type of rectangle called the golden rectangle (learn with our golden rectangle calculator). Such a rectangle fulfills the following condition:\n\n(a + b) / a = a / b = ϕ\n\nwhere φ is the golden ratio equal to 1.618. Find out more about this special ratio with our golden ratio calculator.\n\nAs you probably remember from the ratio calculator, a ratio is a relationship between two quantities, often represented as a fraction.\n\nDid you know that you can construct the golden rectangle using only a straightedge and compass? It's just a few steps!\n\nDraw a square.\n\nDraw a line from the midpoint of one side of the square to the opposite corner. Our midpoint calculator can help you with this step.\n\nDraw a circle with a radius equal to that line and center in the midpoint, as in the picture above.\n\nThe point where the circle meets the extended square side is the next corner of the golden rectangle.\n\nFind the last vertex and complete the golden rectangle.\n\nTaadaaah! It wasn't so hard, was it?\n\nProperties of a rectangle\n\nRectangles have many interesting properties:\n\nCyclic – meaning that all corners lie on a single circle.\n\nEquiangular – all its corner angles are equal to 90 degrees.\n\nRectilinear – its sides meet at right angles.\n\nTwo lines of reflectional symmetry – vertical and horizontal through the center.\n\nTwo diagonals, which bisect each other. You can find the diagonal length using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nOpposite sides of a rectangle are parallel to each other and have equal lengths.\n\nOther lesser-known rectangular properties:\n\nThe intersection of the diagonals is the circumcenter – a circle exists which has a center at that point, and it passes through the four corners.\n\nIn a rectangle with different side lengths (simply speaking – not a square), it's not possible to draw the incircle.\n\nLines joining the midpoints of the sides of a rectangle form a rhombus, which is half the area of the rectangle. The sides of the shape are parallel to the diagonals.\n\nYou can think of your own properties as well, e.g., concerning the revolution of a rectangle – along the side or diagonal to get a cylinder or a cone, respectively.\n\nRectangle vs. other shapes. Is a square a rectangle?\n\nTL;DR:\n\nIs a square a rectangle? YES.\n\nIs a rectangle a parallelogram? YES.\n\nIs a rectangle a rhombus? In general – NO. Only if it's a square (the angles of the rhombus are all 90 degrees).\n\nIs a rhombus a rectangle? In general – NO. Only if it's a square (the sides of the rectangle are all equal in length).\n\nIs a rectangle a quadrilateral? YES, of course.\n\nIs a rectangle a trapezoid? YES.\n\nWondering if a square is a rectangle or if a rectangle is a parallelogram? Have a look at the picture below, and you shouldn't have any doubts about the relations between quadrilaterals anymore:\n\nHow to read this diagram? Let's start with our rectangle. Three figures are connected directly to the shape: a square, a parallelogram, and an isosceles trapezoid. So if the shape is above our shape of interest – like square and rectangle – we can say that:\n\nEvery square is a rectangle and a square is a special case of a rectangle.\n\nFor the other two figures, we can state analogically:\n\nEvery rectangle is a parallelogram and a rectangle is a particular case of a parallelogram.\n\nEvery rectangle is a trapezoid and a rectangle is a special case of a trapezoid.\n\nWeird fun fact: what's the most rectangular shaped country in the world?\n\nMany different rankings exist, evaluating the countries – whether by their areas, populations, level of education, or Nobel prize winners.\n\nBut have you ever wondered who's the winner of the most rectangular country competition? An Australian geo-statistician David Barry calculated the parameter of rectangularity for all countries in the world and created a ranking.\n\nHe found out that the most rectangular country is Egypt, whereas the \"least rectangular country in the world\" title goes to the Maldives (however, the author admits that calculations for countries that consist of many small islands could be terribly wrong). Have a look at the table below and check out the first ten countries, as well as the least rectangular ones.\n\nHighest scores from rectangularity ranking. Index of 1 is a perfect rectangle, 0 is an infinite number of infinitely small islands. Table adapted from Mr. Barry's web page, as the image of the world below.\n\nRank\n\nCountry\n\nRectangularness\n\nImage\n\n1\n\nEgypt\n\n0.955\n\n2\n\nVatican\n\n0.948\n\n3\n\nSint Maarten\n\n0.937\n\n4\n\nLesotho\n\n0.936\n\n5\n\nYemen\n\n0.928\n\n6\n\nGhana\n\n0.924\n\n7\n\nMacedonia\n\n0.921\n\n8\n\nCôte d'Ivoire\n\n0.919\n\n9\n\nPoland\n\n0.919\n\n10\n\nNauru\n\n0.917\n\n...\n\n169\n\nUSA\n\n0.735\n\n...\n\n206\n\nTuvalu\n\n0.240\n\n207\n\nMarshall Islands\n\n0.201\n\n208\n\nMaldives\n\n0.018\n\nEgypt is the leader, but that shouldn't surprise anybody checking the shape of that country on the map. The USA is in the middle of the ranking, mainly because of the eccentricity of Alaska and Hawaii. The confusing thing is that the 2nd most rectangular country – Vatican – is at the same time the 4th-roundest country, and Poland, 5th in roundness classification, is 9th in the rectangularity ranking.\n\nHow is it even possible to be rectangular and round at the same time?! As you can guess, it's all about the definition of rectangularity and roundness, which may not be adequate for complex or scattered shapes – and the borders of countries are usually such examples, containing sharp edges, small islands, or colonies somewhere on the other part of the globe.\n\nIf you're interested in the topic, you can have a look at this explanation and discussion of the results.\n\nYou could think that the world would be easier to draw if every country were a rectangle... Or would it?\n\nRectangle patterns\n\nStacked bond – it's the most common and simplest tiling pattern, as tiles are laid in straight lines.\n\nRunning bond – typical for pavements, tile, and brick bonds.\n\nHerringbone – wooden floors look good with this kind of pattern.\n\nBasketweave – often used for hallways or outdoor paths.\n\nOf course, tiles come in all shapes and sizes – hexagonal and octagonal with squares are quite popular choices. For the pentagon, the shape must be irregular to form a tiling pattern.\n\nRectangles in everyday life: rectangle body shape, rectangle pool, rectangle tablecloth...\n\nBody shape type is one of the most searched-for problems connected to rectangles. All you need to do is to measure your bust, waist, hips, and high hip and type the values into the tool. Then, you'll get the information about what your body shape is.\n\nFor example, the rectangle body shape is defined as a \"boyish\" body type – your hips, waist, and bust are about the same size. Your body is well-proportioned and athletic in appearance.\n\nSurprisingly, we are surrounded by rectangular objects. That's why our rectangle calculator may be useful not only for math classes but also in your everyday life problems. Of course, you won't find an ideal rectangle in reality, as it always has a third dimension; but if it's small compared to the other two measurements, the approximation is good enough.\n\nRectangle tablecloths – given the size of your table, you can find out what tablecloth is needed or how much lace or hemming tape you need to use.\n\nDoors or window glass – did a storm or a golf ball break your window pane? Calculate the area and estimate the repair cost, given the price per sq ft or sq meter.\n\nScreens of electronic devices – tablets, smartphones, TVs – use this area of a rectangle calculator to estimate how much space on the wall your screen will take up – or how big the screen of the phone you want to buy is.\n\nBlackboards, mirrors, frames, canvas, sheets of paper, notebooks, envelopes, money, flags, rectangle pools... It's a never-ending list!\n\nHave a look. Can you find more rectangular objects around you? Sure you can!\n\nFAQs\n\nHow to find perimeter and area of a rectangle?\n\nTo find the perimeter, you need to sum up all sides of a rectangle:\n\nP = a + b + a + b\n\nTo find the area of a rectangle, you need to multiply the shorter and longer sides:\n\nA = a × b\n\nWhat's the area of a rectangle measuring 3 feet by 4 inches?\n\nIt's 144 square inches! To find this rectangle's area, you need to:\n\nConvert feet to inches. 3 feet is equal to 36 inches.\n\nMultiply the width and length of the rectangle. The area is equal to 4 times 36.\n\nCheck your result in our area of a rectangle calculator!\n\nHow to tell if a shape is a rectangle?\n\nA shape is a rectangle if:\n\nIt has two dimensions – length and width.\n\nIt has four sides that create four angles.\n\nAll the angles are right (90°).\n\nOpposite sides of a rectangle are parallel to each other and have equal lengths."
