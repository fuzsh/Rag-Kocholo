Start your journey today and stay as long as you want.\n\nWorking with fuel is one of the most important things you can do when the world is facing major climate challenges. It may sound strange perhaps, but when we make changes and drive our business towards a sustainable future at all stages, it makes a real difference. We go to work and make a difference every day. In our global work environment, you get to meet like-minded people who are all working towards the same goal, whether your skills are in marketing, sustainability, HR or finance.\n\nAs part of our commitment to diversity and inclusion, we are working to create a culture where team members feel valued, heard and, most importantly, where they can bring their authentic selves to work every day. Promoting diversity and inclusion is a key component of our culture of growing together and is critical to continuing to be a preferred choice for our diverse customer base.\n\nAt Circle K, we work to make everyday life easier for our customers. We are inclusive and treat each other, our customers and our suppliers with respect. We like to try new things and when we make mistakes we learn from them.\n\nFueled by our “One Team” culture focused on putting its people and customers first, we are proud to announce that we have received the 2024 Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award (GEWA). It is the third consecutive year that we've received the award, which recognizes the world's most engaged workplace cultures."
