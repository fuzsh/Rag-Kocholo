        "text": "LAUREL, Miss. (WDAM) - Leaders with the National Campaign for Grade-Level Reading visited Laurel Wednesday to share how they are enhancing their literacy program for elementary students.\n\n“Laurel is part of what is moving Mississippi into a leadership role,” said Ralph Smith, NCGLR’s founding managing editor.\n\nThe reading program, called “The Golden Pages,” has been implemented in 350 communities nationwide, with Laurel becoming the 10th school district to do so in Mississippi.\n\n“Our campaign for grade-level reading is going to be very instrumental as we strive to impact our kindergarten readiness and make sure that our kids also have the skills that they need before they get to the third grade,” said Laurel School District Superintendent Dr. Michael Eubanks.\n\nThe district recently got a $200,000 grant to assist students with grade-level reading pertaining to students’ mental health.\n\nSmith said his organization’s campaign also helps with community partnerships.\n\n“It’s great to see people in the community make that decision on behalf of their kids, act on it and then act on it together,” said Smith.\n\nThe coalition will address family engagement and support, kindergarten readiness, third-grade reading proficiency and decreased chronic absenteeism.\n\nDistrict officials said they wanted to make sure students reach their full potential with reading.\n\n“We’ve had a coalition and group of people who have been committed to this effort and committed to making sure this campaign has risen off the ground and that we’re impacting our community,” said Eubanks.\n\nThat advisory council is made up of the school district’s staff and community members, Eubanks said.\n\nIf interested in joining the council, email chollins@laurelschools.org.\n\nWant more WDAM 7 news in your inbox?
