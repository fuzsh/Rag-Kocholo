        "text": "Guajome Regional Park is located in the coastal community of Oceanside and has a little bit of everything that San Diego County offers. Just 8 miles from the Pacific Ocean, the park is a great place to visit year-round, and is close to many natural and historic points of interest.\n\nSome 4.5 miles of multi-use, non-motorized trails meander through diverse Southern California habitats such as woodlands, chaparral, wetlands and mixed grasslands. Two ponds attract a migratory birds and serve as home to a variety of fish that will test the skills of any angler.\n\nGuajome also has two day-use areas with new playgrounds, a basketball court, restrooms and lots of green lawn space make this park ideal for picnicking â€“ along with 33 tent and RV campsites, a caravan pavilion and a rustic cabin for those wishing to extend their stay overnight.\n\nVisit the News & Events page for park events, updates and closures.\n\nView Development Projects."
