        "text": "by Maurice Bobb / @reesereport\n\nYou almost need to be a history buff to find Zach Randolph’s name on SLAMonline’s Top 50 Players list. Give up? It was September 15, 2006. He came in at No. 44 and then Debo’d his way to 23.6 ppg and 10.1 rpg that next year for the Blazers. Who says SLAMonline doesn’t know how to pre dict a player’s impact?\n\nBut as Verbal Kint would say, “And like that, poof. He’s gone.”\n\nZ-Bo was like Keyser Soze in ’08 and ’09—nowhere to be found in our rankings. Ah, but oh what a difference a change of scenery can make. Traded to the Memphis Grizzlies prior to last season, the crafty southpaw from Marion, IN experienced a rebirth, drop-steppin’, jab-steppin’ and pump faking his way to a beasty stat line of 20.8 points and a career-high 11.7 rebounds per contest, his first ever All-Star nod and a cozy No. 36 spot in our definitive rankings.\n\nSure, Randolph gets into trouble off the court as often as DMX, but on the court, the 6-9, 255-pound forward flat out produces. Check his vitae: Won the ’03-04 NBA Most Improved Player Award after bumping up his scoring and rebounding averages from 8.4 and 4.5 to 20.1 and 10.5, respectively; averaged at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in three of his eight seasons in the League; ranks eighth among all NBA players in double-doubles since the start of his breakout ‘03-04 season with 191; has three career 40-point games and two where he went off for 20 points and 20 rebounds.\n\nMost bball aficionados forget this, but Randolph had microfracture surgery in the summer of ’05 and didn’t miss a beat. He’s been destroying cats down low with little or no athletic ability. Why? Zach. Randolph. Is. A. Workhorse.\n\nDespite operating in real estate clogged with taller and more athletically gifted big men, Randolph is the “ground bound mound of rebound,” somehow coming up with 4.1 offensive rebounds per without ever leaving his feet. Then there’s his vast arsenal of post moves that keep defenders guessing.\n\nZ-Bo is also very deceptive in the way he pads the stat sheet. Even if you’re watching him play, you end up surprised by how many points and boards he has when the final buzzer sounds. Prior to landing in the host city of The World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest, the largest pork barbecue cooking contest in the world, Randolph detractors banked on the Michigan State standout bringing a “black hole” mentality to the team’s offensive scheme.\n\nBut then a funny thing happened. The Grizz started ballin’. For real. Paired with the promising Rudy Gay, OJ Mayo, Marc Gasol and Mike Conley, Z-Bo found purchase in Lionel Hollins’ system and gave his squad the jolt in the arm it needed to win 16 more games than the previous year.\n\nWith the steady improvement of all parts involved and the addition of sharpshooter Xavier Henry, Z-Bo & Co. will definitely wreck enough havoc to challenge for a playoff berth next summer. And though there is a dark legal cloud circling above Randolph’s noggin (to date, he has not yet been charged with any crime after he was accused of being a “major marijuana supplier”), he reportedly will hit training camp 30 pounds lighter. If that’s true, the man whose feet stick to the hardwood like chewing gum may actually start going aerial on the opposing D and they ain’t ready for that.\n\nSLAMonline TOP 50 PLAYERS OVERALL RANK POSITION RANK Player Team Position 2010 2009 2010 2009 Ray Allen Celtics SG 50 36 11 10 Gilbert Arenas Wizards SG 49 34 10 9 Lamar Odom Lakers PF 48 33 14 10 John Wall Wizards PG 47 NR 13 NR OJ Mayo Grizzlies SG 46 46 9 12 Al Horford Hawks C 45 NR 6 NR Jason Kidd Mavs PG 44 45 12 10 Joakim Noah Bulls C 43 NR 5 NR LaMarcus Aldridge Blazers PF 42 39 13 12 David West Hornets PF 41 31 12 8 Monta Ellis Warriors SG 40 NR 8 NR Andrew Bogut Bucks C 39 NR 4 NR Yao Ming Rockets C 38 NR 3 NR Brandon Jennings Bucks PG 37 NR 11 NR Zach Randolph Grizzlies PF 36 NR 11 NR"
