        "text": "Tom Orsborn: Rudy Gay on Zach Randolph: “One of the best teammates you could have. He gave it his all out there every time he touched the basketball court. He was an enforcer and he did a lot for the city of Memphis. He was a great player.”\n\nZach Randolph officially retires\n\nZach Randolph: I gave this game my all, and it gave everything back and more. Basketball will always be a part of me. From Marion, to East Lansing, to Portland, NY, LA, Memphis, Sacramento, and everyone in between -thank you all for an incredible journey. Special thank you to the Memphis Grizzlies and the entire city which I will forever call home, my family for always supporting me – my mom, brother, and sisters for taking this journey with me, the Portland Trail Blazers for taking a chance on a young kid from Marion, Coach Moe Smedley, Coach Tom Izzo, Commissioners David Stern and Adam Silver for the opportunity, all the NBA organizations, front offices, staff, and every single teammate. To my agent Raymond Brothers – you’ve not only been my agent my whole career, you’ve been my big brother as well. One love. Z-Bo.\n\nBack in June, Randolph seemed interested in a comeback, telling us he was “back to training” and was hoping to sign a deal with a team for the 2019-20 season. But, that didn’t happen … and when we saw Randolph at Staples Center for the big Lakers vs. Clippers Christmas Day matchup, he was pretty matter of fact about his future.\n\nRandolph owns a small percentage of the Phoenix, and like the other NBA players who have bought into the NBL, he has entered into a mutually beneficial arrangement by investing with a friend in a franchise. The players buy proximity to the nerve center of a professional sports team, and the franchise gets an association with a brand-name NBA player. “It gives you confidence that you are on the right track and that there are others who share your vision who have done it before,” said Craig Hutchison, chairman of Melbourne United.\n\nFormer NBA star Zach Randolph may not have expected to see people riding kangaroos down the streets, but he admits he’s on a steep learning curve as part-owner of South East Melbourne Phoenix. On his first trip to Melbourne, all 206cm of the man mountain laughs when asked if he thought he might see a few people riding kangaroos down the street. “Yeah, look, I ain’t gonna lie, but man, it’s beautiful, the people here are beautiful, it’s just great here, man.”"
