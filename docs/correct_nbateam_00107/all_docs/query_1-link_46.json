        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The Louisville women's basketball team added another strong talent to their 2024 recruiting class as Mackenly Randolph signed with the Cardinals. Randolph, the daughter of former NBA All-Star Zach Randolph, chose the Cardinals over Notre Dame and Michigan State.\n\n\"Mac displays a relentless pursuit of excellence,\" said head coach Jeff Walz. \"She is a tremendous leader on and off the court and brings with her a championship mindset. Her energy is contagious, and her versatility will be showcased in our system. If you need a rebound, she will pursue it. Need a bucket, she'll manufacture points. She will win the hearts of the Cardinal faithful with her hustle, toughness and determination. She is a bonafide winner!\"\n\nRandolph is a five-star prospect, is ranked No. 23 overall and the sixth-ranked forward by espnW HoopGurlz. She comes to Louisville from Chatsworth, California and was high school teammates with fellow incoming recruit Izela Arenas (ranked No. 88 overall) at Sierra Canyon. The duo joins Tajianna Roberts (No. 24 overall) as the three incoming Louisville recruits ranked in the Top 100.\n\nRandolph was named a McDonald's All-American in January and played in the All-American Game earlier this month in Houston. Randolph is the 16th McDonald's All-American signed by Walz during his tenure at Louisville. She was also named a Naismith Trophy Third Team All-American back in March.\n\nRandolph is also taking part in the Jordan Brand Classic later this month in Brooklyn. Randolph will join Arenas and Roberts in the Jordan Brand game on April 21 at the Barclays Center.\n\nRandolph has been named to numerous USA Basketball teams throughout her early career. As a member of the 2022 USA Basketball Women's U17 National Team, she averaged 9.3 points and 5.6 rebounds and guided the US to a 7-0 record and gold medal at the 2022 FIBA U17 World Cup in Debrecen, Hungary. Earlier this month, she competed with USA Basketball at the 2024 Women's Nike Hoop Summit in Portland. She started for Team USA as they defeated Team World 83-80. Randolph played 34 minutes and tallied 11 points, two rebounds, two assists and two steals.\n\nWhile playing for Sierra Canyon, Randolph won a CIF Open Division championship, a CIF State Open Division championship, an ESPN national championship and four league championships. She is also the girls basketball program's all-time leader in points and rebounds. During her junior season, Sierra Canyon was ranked the No. 1 program in the country.\n\nRandolph joins Arenas, Roberts, Anaya Hardy and Isla Juffermans as part of the incoming freshman class for the Cardinals."
