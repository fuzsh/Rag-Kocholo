        "text": "A person with knowledge of the agreement tells The Associated Press that the Sacramento Kings have agreed to a two-year, $24 million deal with forward Zach Randolph.\n\nThe sides came to agreement on Tuesday, reuniting Randolph with former Memphis Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger, now the coach in Sacramento. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the deal cannot be signed until Thursday.\n\nESPN first reported the agreement.\n\nAfter a rocky start to his career in Portland and New York, Randolph found himself in Memphis. He spent eight years with the Grizzlies, emerging as one of the central figures of the team's \"grit and grind\" mantra.\n\nLast year, he averaged 14.1 points and 8.2 rebounds. He is expected to be a solid veteran mentor for a young Kings team.\n\nRandolph wasn't the only veteran addition the Kings made on Tuesday either, as the team also reached an agreement on a three-year, $57 million deal with point guard George Hill, according to multiple reports. The Vertical's Shams Charania was first to report the agreement.\n\nHill averaged 16.9 points, 4.2 assists and 3.4 rebounds with the Jazz this past season.\n\nThe 31-year-old point guard is best known for his stout perimter defense and outside shooting. In his nine-year career, Hill has knocked down threes at a 38 percent clip, hitting over 40 percent of his attempts from beyond the arc with Utah last season.\n\nWizards: Agree to 1-year deal with Mike Scott\n\nA person familiar with the deal tells The Associated Press that free-agent forward Mike Scott has agreed to a $1.7 million, one-year contract with the Washington Wizards.\n\nThe person who confirmed the agreement to the AP spoke on condition of anonymity Tuesday because it won't become official until the free agency moratorium period ends on Thursday.\n\nThe deal between Scott and the Wizards was first reported by ESPN.\n\nThe 6-foot-8 Scott, a second-round pick out of Virginia in 2012, played 281 games over five seasons with the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nHis best season was 2013-14, when he averaged 9.6 points per game. He played only 18 games with the Hawks last season because of a knee injury before being traded to the Phoenix Suns, who waived him. He last appeared in a game on Feb. 15."
