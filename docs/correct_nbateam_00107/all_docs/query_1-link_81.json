        "text": "Former Memphis Grizzlies forward Zach Randolph could face similar penalties ex-teammate O.J. Mayo received in terms of being banned from the NBA for violation of the league’s anti-drug policy.\n\nMayo was dismissed and disqualified from the NBA in 2016 for violating the terms of the league’s anti-drug program, the first player to receive that punishment in a decade.\n\n“The charges are false and misleading,” (Ranoldph’s agent Raymond) Brothers told The Associated Press on Thursday. “We’re looking at all options to resolve this matter.”"
