        "text": "Zach Randolph: But I’m at the Four Seasons on Wilshire, and I’m downstairs. I see the general manager, Kevin Pritchard, right? At the time. So I walk up to KP, I’m like, ‘What’s up, KP?’ He’s like, ‘What’s up, Z-Bo?’ I was like, ‘Man, why am I getting traded?’ And he’s like, ‘Man, no, man, you’re not going. We want you here, you’re not getting traded.’ So I’m like, ‘Okay, cool.’ So I go upstairs, I tell a couple of my homies up there, I tell them, ‘Man, I just seen Pritchard, man, I’m cool. I ain’t going nowhere, I’m good. You know, I’m straight, I ain’t going nowhere.’ He just told me I ain’t going nowhere, right? Man, so we sitting back in the room, blowing, whatever, watching the draft come on. ‘Trade: Zach Randolph to the New York Knicks.’ Look, man, I’m—man, stomach dropped. Right back downstairs, man, sick. Stomach dropped. I go in the restroom, I’m sick as hell, right? So I’m like, ‘Man, I just seen this dude. He told me I ain’t—’ I said, ‘Man, it’s messed up, man, come on, man.'”\n\nRandolph recalled the moment vividly, saying, “He come in the locker room, ‘can’t nobody slam me.’ After working out, we in the locker room…So I’m sitting around, I’m like, I’m from the hood. So I grew up locking up in the yard.” Despite his youthful confidence, Randolph quickly learned the difference between teenage and grown man strength. “I stood up, try to grab him, we lock up, he slammed– he throwing me all in the lockers. Boom! Boom!” Randolph said.\n\nThe tussle escalated as Patterson continued to overpower Randolph. “He slammed me in the locker, boom, all over the locker room. Boom, boom, boom. So we get back to the middle,” Randolph recounted. The locker room floor, covered in carpet but with concrete underneath, added to the intensity of the fight. Patterson ultimately overpowered Randolph, demonstrating the stark difference in physical maturity. “He dropped on me, grabbed my legs. Man, pick me up bro. Like this and thump me on my back like a WWE fool,” Randolph concluded.\n\nThe Grizzlies are also expected to begin filming a documentary soon that will go back to Allen’s roots of growing up in Chicago. That documentary is expected to be released around the time of Allen’s ceremony. A date has not been set yet for the 2024-25 season. “I’m looking forward to it,” Allen said. “Hopefully, I have a box of tissue with me.”\n\nWith his former teammates Randolph, Mike Conley, and Tony Allen in attendance, with whom he made seven straight playoff appearances, Gasol gave a touching speech thanking them, the city of Memphis, and the Grizzlies organization. “Back when I was 19 years old, I used to play the game like many kids today. I used to imagine I was Michael Jordan with a fadeaway, Larry Bird with the three, or Magic Johnson with a no-look pass. And 25 years later, I imagine how Tony Allen would approach this defensive assignment against the best player on the other team and what his mindset would be. How is Z-Bo going to take over this stretch of the game and be a beast on the block, and through it all, how is Mike Conley going to keep it all together? When I was able to accomplish my biggest goal—winning an NBA ring—these three guys, who meant so much to me along the way, were right there with me. For that and many other reasons, thank you. I’ll be thankful forever, and grit and grind,” Gasol said."
