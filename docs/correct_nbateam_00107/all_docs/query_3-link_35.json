        "text": "NBA basketball is swiftly turning into the video game NBA Jam — which is to say, games are morphing into up-and-down affairs with crazy amounts of 3-point shooting and transition play. All that's seemingly missing is a net catching flames and a voice proclaiming \"He's on fire!\"\n\nThe Jazz aren't joining this fray anytime soon. In fact they're quite content playing the old school way — with two imposing big men, a meticulous pace and an offense that doesn't live behind the 3-point line.\n\nWith the fundamental style of the NBA transitioning to small ball, the Jazz are trying to remain relevant the old-fashioned way. And when they face the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday night at Vivint Smart Home Arena, they will see a team that's all but a mirror image.\n\nThe Grizzlies have been playing the old-fashioned way for a while now — and winning with it.\n\n\"Being successful in the NBA is staying true to who you are,\" Utah coach Quin Snyder said. \"We're comfortable with who we are with the bigs that we have. Everyone in the league wants to run, but one of the things we feel confident in is that we are capable of playing a number of ways.\"\n\nAgainst the Grizzlies, the Jazz frontcourt tandem of Derrick Favors — if he plays — and Rudy Gobert will match up with Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol, one of the best power duos in the league. Mike Conley has long been one of the more underrated point guards in the NBA, but he's not known for the speed and athleticism that have made people like Russell Westbrook, or Chris Paul the best at their position. Memphis plays at a slower pace than most. The Grizzlies play almost exclusively in the halfcourt.\n\nAnd yet, Memphis is a team that annually wins 50 games, a team that regularly makes the playoffs and shows well when it gets there. Many remember the Golden State Warriors for their run through the postseason on their way to a championship. But the Grizzlies gave Golden State arguably its most competitive series, even leading 2-1 at one point, before Stephen Curry and company turned on the jets and won the last three games.\n\nThe Jazz know the blueprint is there to be a good team, while being a big team. And they embrace that. They are able to pull this off because they've been so good defensively. And the ability to get defensive stops and scores on the other end at a deliberate pace has helped them to a 3-2 record early. Others around the NBA are taking notice — and admiring.\n\n\"Skill wins in this league,\" Trail Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. \"Whether you're a skilled perimeter player, or a skilled big guy, skill wins, and Utah has skilled players. Memphis has been very successful and they've been traditional. I would say the Los Angeles Clippers are traditional as well. I think the difference right now is that every team has the ability to go small ball. It's just a matter of how they use it.\"\n\nUtah has played big for a good chunk of the season. Snyder is always been careful to make sure either Favors or Gobert — when not playing together — is on the floor throughout most of the game.\n\nAt the same time, the Jazz have figured out a way to play smaller, when needed. In beating the Indiana Pacers last Saturday, Snyder played Gordon Hayward at power forward in long stretches. He did the same thing during Thursday's win at Denver, though by necessity since Favors was slowed by the flu.\n\nBut no one will every confuse the Jazz with the Warriors, or any other team that's embraced playing the game smaller and faster. Utah doesn't shoot many 3-pointers, with the Denver game a notable exception. The Jazz don't go about their business at a blistering pace.\n\nThis is a team that has an imposing frontcourt with a coach that won't mess with that identity. And why not? Memphis has proven it's still possible to win in that manner, to still be successful playing the game from inside out.\n\n\"It's a style we can win with,\" Hayward said. \"It's something that coach talked about, having our own identity and being who we are. We can play a number of different ways. But for us, I think it's important we focus on ourselves, and our principles. If we play well defensively, we'll always give ourselves a chance.\"\n\ntjones@sltrib.com"
