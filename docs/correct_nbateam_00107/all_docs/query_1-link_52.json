        "text": "Former Memphis Grizzlies fan-favorite Zach Randolph has always had a reputation as hip hop aficionado.\n\nHis love affair with music and friendship with famous rappers like 2 Chainz, Fat Joe, Jay Rock and Yo Gotti has kept Randolph, who recently was arrested for marijuana, running in the circles of Memphis’ own music scene.\n\nMore: Zach Randolph's weed arrest in Los Angeles: What we know\n\nRelated: Zach Randolph, former Grizzlies star, arrested for possession of marijuana, intent to sell\n\nPair that with a swagger that matches a rappers’ own and it’s no wonder that the NBA poster trouble-child Randolph has become both an inspiration for anthems and a fall back reference in other songs.\n\nHere are three of the most notable Randolph references.\n\nThe Tribute\n\nThe recently traded to the Sacramento Kings, Randolph’s role in pushing Memphis towards playoff runs (most specifically the 2013 push) spawned many, many fan or unknown local rappers to make odes to the rugged rebounder, most of them title Zach Randolph. While Soundcloud rappers and wanna-be Twitter famous singers have all added their own concept of “ballin like Randolph,” one of the best wasn’t actually produced by a rapper. Viral video hit of ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith “rapping” about Randolph’s abilities over Drake’s “Started From the Bottom” takes the cake.\n\nThe Call-Out\n\nRandolph’s other top mentions come from throw-away lines in rappers like Futuristic and MoneyBagg Yo & Yo Gotti’s songs. Futuristic’s “Anti-Social” is more of a qualifier instead of recognizing Randolph for his skills. He sings “Everybody wanna ball with Zach, huh? I ain’t talkin’ Zach Randolph,” before continuing his verse about staying home. MoneyBagg Yo and Yo Gotti bring up Randolph twice, once in “No Features” and again in “Prayers.”\n\nThe Muse\n\nDuring the 2013 NBA Playoffs Randolph’s “we don’t bluff” quote became not only a rallying cry, but the basis of a rap song by another of Memphis’ beloved celebrities. DJ Paul of the Academy Award-winning group Three 6 Mafia took that quote and turned it into the Grizzlies newest rap anthem, joining “M.E.M.P.H.I.S. Grizzlies” by Teflon Don and “Whoop that Trick” from the movie “Hustle and Flow.”"
