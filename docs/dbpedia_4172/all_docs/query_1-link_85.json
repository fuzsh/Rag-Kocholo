        "text": "Silent West\n\nOctober 8, 2021 – February 13, 2023\n\nFeaturing highlights of American West–themed posters from the silent film era, The Silent West shows the varied range of the industry prior to “talkies” and the consolidation of the studio system. The posters showcase a stunning art form in a remarkable era of commercial lithography. This small exhibition also reveals the cinematic West of the 1910s and 1920s to be quite modern, engaging topics still relevant to the real West. Although a large proportion of silent films themselves are lost, the posters reflect film artists and entrepreneurs experimenting with a new medium. Women and people of color served as writers, directors, stunt performers, and other creators in greater numbers than in later movies.\n\nDress Codes\n\nMay 21, 2022 – January 3, 2023\n\nWhat stories do clothes tell? What do a pair of blue jeans or a plaid shirt say about the wearer and their identity? The exhibition examines what we wear, how we wear it, and why through six enduring icons of Western style: blue jeans, the plaid shirt, the fringed leather jacket, the aloha shirt, the China Poblana dress, and the cowboy boot. Featuring more than 150 objects—including apparel drawn primarily from the Autry’s extensive clothing and textile collection as well as art, photography, and historical artifacts—this exhibition excavates the histories embedded in these key garments and explores their connections to ideas of Western identity, tradition, individual freedom, hybridity, and reinvention.\n\nWhat’s Her Story: Women in the Archives\n\nNovember 20, 2020* – August 29, 2021\n\n*The museum was closed to the public from March 14, 2020 – March 30, 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn honor of the 100th anniversary of women winning the right to vote, What’s Her Story: Women in the Archives reveals compelling stories of women found in the Autry’s collections. This exhibit will showcase Assistance League of Los Angeles, Caroline Boeing Poole, Gladys Knight Harris, Native Voices theatre ensemble, and Women’s March participants as 20th and 21st century women who documented their activities and created archives as a way to preserve a legacy in their own voice. Also featured are stories of Bertha Parker Cody, Manuela Garcia, Clara Forslund, and an “Unidentified Woman,” whose lives were documented in archives made by other creators: friends, colleagues, government agencies, and other institutions that produced written and visual records.\n\nWhat’s Her Story also looks behind the scenes to share how the work of archivists brings the more hidden narratives to light-- weaving in and out of primary source evidence to color in details, amplify voices, and begin the discovery of women’s stories. In personal diaries, photographs, letters, music, objects, and ephemera, you will meet women philanthropists, solo sojourners, political activists, artists, and a pioneering anthropologist.\n\nWhen I Remember I See Red\n\nSeptember 25, 2020* – November 14, 2021\n\n*The museum was closed to the public from March 14, 2020 – March 30, 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBeginning with the occupation of Alcatraz in 1969, California became a beacon of creative freedom, individual expression, and social activism for Native peoples across the country. The region quickly transformed into a place where Native artists engaged with cultural diversity, historical traditions, and contemporary art to critique its colonial past. As a result, California became a site of artistic achievement within the broader story of Native art.\n\nThis exhibition features Native California artists who have used their work as a means of cultural resistance and renewal. Many have helped—and continue to help—restore aspects of ceremony, dance, language, and material culture once in danger of disappearing. Several facilitate workshops, teaching the next generation, and curate exhibitions consisting of work by their peers. Some of the pieces displayed are explicitly political in content, but in general aim more to reverse erasure and invisibility while reasserting Native values and sovereignty. Collectively, the artists in this exhibition practice a version of activism that combines elements of traditional and contemporary society to call out racial and social injustice and to heal communities through cultural renewal.\n\nWhen I Remember I See Red was conceived by, and is dedicated to, Nomtipom Wintu artist Frank LaPena (1936–2019), a renowned art writer, curator, poet, traditionalist, and professor at Sacramento State University for 40 years. When I Remember I See Red: American Indian Art and Activism in California was organized by the Crocker Art Museum, Sacramento, CA, with support from the United Auburn Indian Community.\n\nGold at the [Au]try\n\nSeptember 12, 2019 – July 19, 2020*\n\n*The museum was closed to the public from March 14, 2020 – March 30, 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nGold is a precious, beautiful metal, but it can also be an empty promise. A desire for gold has led to atrocities large and small, yet its allure remains. Discover a range of gold-related artworks and artifacts through a new self-guided tour and special exhibits.\n\nCoyote Leaves the Res: The Art of Harry Fonseca\n\nMay 19, 2019–January 5, 2020\n\nFeaturing paintings, sketches, and lithographs, Coyote Leaves the Res: The Art of Harry Fonseca focuses on the recurring figure of Coyote, a trickster, shape shifter, and storyteller capable of moving undetected between different worlds. This exhibition explores the complexity of Harry Fonseca’s (Nisenan Maidu, Hawaiian, Portuguese, 1946–2006) art within the context of a contemporary world, in which new freedoms and old biases often exist side-by-side. As both a gay man and a person of mixed heritage, Fonseca used his work as a vehicle for self-discovery a means of navigating different aspects of his life and identity during a time when ideas about Native peoples were often driven by outside forces, including commercial markets, tourism, and historical clichés.\n\nFonseca was an instrumental force in reshaping Native art with his trademark blend of traditional imagery, contemporary experience, and vibrant color and form. As he used his art to explore both his personal journey and the role of history in shaping Native consciousness in the present, Fonseca sought to expand definitions of American Indian art and to shatter the expectations and stereotypes that had long confined it.\n\nIndian Country: The Art of David Bradley\n\nMarch 31, 2019–January 5, 2020\n\nThe exhibition Indian Country: The Art of David Bradley explores the artist's four-decade career and his deeply thoughtful body of work, a combination of personal experience, social observation, and the influence of art historical icons from Leonardo da Vinci to René Magritte and Andy Warhol.\n\nLa Raza\n\nSeptember 16, 2017–February 10, 2019\n\nPublished in Los Angeles from 1967-1977, the influential bilingual newspaper La Raza provided a voice to the Chicano Rights Movement. La Raza engaged photographers not only as journalists but also as artists and activists to capture the definitive moments, key players, and signs and symbols of Chicano activism. The archive of nearly 25,000 images created by these photographers, now housed at the Chicano Studies Research Center at UCLA, provided the foundation for an exhibition exploring photography’s role in articulating the social and political concerns of the Chicano Movement during a pivotal time in the art and history of the United States. LA RAZA was the most sustained examination to date of both the photography and the alternative press of the Chicano Movement, positioning photography not only as an artistic medium but also as a powerful tool of social activism.\n\nIn response to the LA RAZA exhibition, the Autry’s education department created the Autry Citizen Journalism Project zine. The publication celebrates the work of the women and men who, in the late 1960s and 1970s, contributed to La Raza, the bi-lingual newspaper-turned-magazine at the heart of the Chicano Rights Movement. The project’s goal is to recognize the continuing need for citizen journalism and to engage with the Los Angeles community in a new way. Contributors were asked to share their community’s challenges, successes, issues, and stories to be published online and in hard copies distributed at the Autry. Residents from across Los Angeles County from various backgrounds participated in the project by serving as citizen journalists for their communities.\n\nVolume 1, Issue 1, Fall 2017: Signs of the Times, shares scenes of action and protest. This issue is about visibility, voice, and the longing for recognition and respect.\n\nVolume 1, Issue 2, January 2018: LA: LA, provides a nuanced vision of life in LA, sharing complex stories of Los Angeles residents as told by Angelenos.\n\nVolume 1, Issue 3, Fall 2018: Portraits of a Community, shares poetry, essays, and photographs from Angelenos and is organized into four chapters (Community Support, Immigrant, Neglect, and Post-Parkland)\n\nRick Bartow: Things You Know But Cannot Explain\n\nMay 12, 2018 - January 6, 2019\n\nRick Bartow: Things You Know But Cannot Explain represents the artist’s first major retrospective and a contribution to the substantial growing body of scholarship on contemporary Native artists. Bartow (Mad River Band Wiyot) established his art career in the 1980s following service in Vietnam and a period of recovery from PTSD and alcoholism. His work consists of large-scale paintings, drawings, prints, and sculptures that often feature haunting combinations of animal and human forms, and are often both deeply personal and culturally relevant. Divided into thematic sections such as “Self,” “Dialogue,” and “Tradition,” this exhibition speaks directly to the personal and cultural aspects of traditional Native art within Bartow’s oeuvre while demonstrating his close engagement with the work of 20th-century masters, including Francis Bacon, Robert Rauschenberg, and Jean-Michel Basquiat.\n\nThe Life and Work of Mabel McKay\n\nMarch 3, 2018–September 30, 2018\n\nThe Life and Work of Mabel McKay was the Autry’s first-ever solo show dedicated to a Native American woman’s life and work. Mabel McKay (1907–1993), a Long Valley Cache Creek Pomo woman from Northern California, represents a fascinating modern figure who maintained traditional ways. McKay is celebrated as a master basket weaver, traditional healer, advocate for her community and the environment, and teacher who shared her knowledge of Pomo traditions worldwide.\n\nHarry Gamboa Jr.: Chicano Male Unbonded\n\nSeptember 16, 2017–August 5, 2018\n\nPhotographer, essayist, and performance artist Harry Gamboa Jr. calls into question the relationship between the stereotypes of Mexican American men and the far more diverse community of artists, writers, academics, performers, and other creative thinkers who identify as Chicano in his Chicano Male Unbonded series. Photographed at night and situated within various aspects of Los Angeles’s distinctive urban geography, his subjects together comprise the Chicano avant-garde.\n\nSeeing American Indians\n\nFebruary 26-May 7, 2017\n\nThis special installation displayed four large-scale photogravures of Indigenous North American women, taken between 1910 and 1928 by photographer Edward S. Curtis. The display was part of a cognitive science study seeking to determine if viewers might move beyond stereotypical conceptions of American Indians through “perspective-taking,” or adopting the point of view of the photographic subjects. Museum visitors who participated in the study viewed each of four exhibited photographs for one minute. After viewing each photograph, participants were asked to describe the photograph as well as any responses they had to the photograph. After describing their impressions and reactions, participants rated how emotionally moved they were. This installation, combined with a broader study conducted in a laboratory setting, informed the conclusions later published by cognitive scientists Aleksandra Sherman and Lani Cupo and American Indian studies scholar Nancy Marie Mithlo (Chiricahua Apache). Sherman, Cupo, and Mithlo determined that while perspective-taking increased empathy and emotional connection to the images, it failed to diminish—and sometimes increased—stubborn cultural biases toward American Indians.\n\nRelated Publication\n\n“Perspective-taking increases emotionality and empathy but does not reduce harmful biases against American Indians: Converging evidence from the museum and lab”\n\nAleksandra Sherman, Lani Cupo, and Nancy Marie Mithlo\n\nPLOS ONE journal (February 2020)\n\nMasters of the American West Fine Art Exhibition and Sale\n\nFebruary 11–March 26, 2017\n\nEach year, more than seventy nationally and internationally recognized contemporary Western artists challenge themselves to create and exhibit their very best work. Stylistically and thematically diverse, their works represent the extraordinary range of subject matter that contemporary, historic, and mythic Western experiences continue to inspire.\n\nPlay!\n\nJune 18, 2017–January 7, 2018\n\nThrough more than 200 historic objects from the Autry’s diverse collections, Play! explored the role of toys and games across cultures and over time. Featuring dolls, board games, video games, outdoor activities, and more, the exhibition looked at the many ways children have played in the American West, the social values toys reveal, and how the West has inspired imagination. Beyond the displays, visitors were invited to get hands-on with games of the past and present—no assembly required.\n\nStanding Rock: Art and Solidarity\n\nMay 20, 2017–February 18, 2018\n\nThis exhibition of poster art, clothing, and photographs demonstrated the immediacy of the protests and conflicts as they unfolded, while a video art piece by the Native collaborators of Winter Count explored the broader meanings of these events. In the context of the Autry’s galleries, this display echoed a long history of conflict between a settler society and Indigenous nations in the American West.\n\nRevolutionary Vision: Group f/64 and Richard Misrach Photographs From the Bank of America Collection\n\nJune 4, 2016–January 8, 2017\n\nFeaturing more than 80 striking photographs, Revolutionary Vision explored the intertwined legacies of f/64, California’s premier photo-modernist group, and Richard Misrach, one of the state’s best-known contemporary photographers. This traveling exhibition included works by Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, Richard Misrach, Edward Weston, and others who present changing visions of the Western landscape.\n\nMasters of the American West Fine Art Exhibition and Sale\n\nFebruary 6–March 20, 2016\n\nThe Autry’s Masters of the American West Fine Art Exhibition and Sale has become the country’s most important Western art show. Each year, more than seventy nationally and internationally recognized contemporary Western artists challenge themselves to create and exhibit their very best work. Stylistically and thematically diverse, their works represent the extraordinary range of subject matter that contemporary, historic, and mythic Western experiences continue to inspire.\n\nCalifornia Impressionism: The Gardena High School Collection\n\nSeptember 12, 2015–August 6, 2017\n\nCalifornia Impressionism featured a selection of paintings from the Gardena High School collection, including major works by notable artists such as Jean Mannheim and Edgar Payne. Each year from 1919 to 1956, Gardena High School seniors collaborated to select and purchase contemporary art that they gifted to the school upon graduation. The paintings reflected the state’s scenic diversity as well as the vitality of Gardena High School’s program and the Impressionist movement that once flourished here.\n\nNew Acquisitions Featuring the Kaufman Collection\n\nAugust 8, 2015–July 9, 2017\n\nInspired by the gift of 49 paintings and sculptures from the collection of Loretta and Victor Kaufman, this exhibition highlighted recent additions to the Autry’s growing art collections. The exhibition featured a powerful selection of works representing diverse peoples and perspectives, including bronzes by Frederic Remington and Allan Houser, paintings by Rick Bartow and Eanger Irving Couse, lithographs by Fritz Scholder, watercolors by David Einstein, and others that revealed a set of dynamic visions of the American West.\n\nEmpire and Liberty: The Civil War and the West\n\nApril 25, 2015–January 3, 2016\n\nEmpire and Liberty was the first major museum exhibition to illuminate the causes and legacies of the American Civil War from the vantage point of Westward expansion. The exhibition included an astonishing array of more than 200 artifacts, including Texas slave sale documents, Andrés Pico’s war drum, the battle flag carried by soldiers of the California Hundred, a Buffalo Soldier’s revolver, and Cherokee General Stand Watie’s bowie knife.\n\nLuis Ortega’s Rawhide Artistry\n\nApril 3, 2005–July 4, 2005\n\nOrganized by the National Cowboy and Western History Museum, Oklahoma City.\n\nIn 1932, Luis Ortega broke his arm in a horse corral. While in Santa Barbara seeing the doctor, he showed Western artist Ed Borein his braiding. The artist admired the quality of Ortega’s work and encouraged him to braid rawhide on a more artistic level. This encouragement from a respected member of Santa Barbara’s art community convinced Ortega to pursue a new goal in his braiding career—rawhide artist. During this period he started braiding with finer rawhide strands and may have been the first California braider to interweave colored strands into his hackamores, reins and quirts.\n\nDrawn to Yellowstone: Artists in America’s First National Park\n\nSeptember 4, 2004–January 23, 2005\n\nLocated mainly in Wyoming but also spanning parts of Montana and Idaho, Yellowstone National Park is among the world’s best-known geological wonders. Seemingly a place apart from civilization, Yellowstone’s exotic appeal also has lured generations of artists. Through their work, Drawn to Yellowstone: Artists in America’s First National Park invited visitors to explore the park’s visual history, changing identity, and impact as a cultural phenomenon.\n\nCompanion publication\n\nDrawn To Yellowstone: Artists in America’s First National Park\n\nBy Peter H. Hassrick\n\nUniversity of Washington Press (2002)\n\nEncounters: El Norte–The Spanish and Mexican North\n\nAugust 1, 2004–May 8, 2005\n\nIn Encounters: El Norte—The Spanish and Mexican North, the Autry brought together the collections of the Southwest Museum and the Autry, each contributing to the story of the Spanish and Mexican north. Native American artifacts from the Southwest enhanced this story of encounters, and the Southwest’s complementary collections of Hispanic material were also integrated into the gallery.\n\nGeorge Catlin and His Indian Gallery\n\nMay 9, 2004–August 4, 2004\n\nOrganized by the Smithsonian American Art Museum Renwick Gallery.\n\nGeorge Catlin (1796—1872) journeyed west five times in the 1830s to paint the Plains Indians and their way of life. Convinced that westward expansion spelled certain disaster for native peoples, he viewed his Indian Gallery as a way \"to rescue from oblivion their primitive looks and customs.\" Catlin was the first artist to record the Plains Indians in their own territories. But the more than 500 paintings in the Indian Gallery also revealed the fateful encounter of two different cultures in a frontier region undergoing dramatic transformation.\n\nGlorious Treasures: 100 Years of Collecting by the Southwest Museum\n\nOctober 11, 2003–July 4, 2004\n\nOrganized by the Southwest Museum of the American Indian.\n\nGlorious Treasures: 100 Years of Collecting by the Southwest Museum featured objects collected since the Southwest Society made its initial acquisitions in 1904. A variety of fine California baskets, Pueblo pots, and Navajo textiles were shown. A rare Nez Perce quill-wrapped horsehair shirt was displayed, as was a headdress that once belonged to White Swan (Crow), who was a scout for the U.S. Army at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Seldom-seen ceramics and clothing from the museum's Central and South American holdings were also included.\n\nCalifornia Pottery: From Missions to Modernism\n\nJuly 4, 2003–January 25, 2004\n\nOrganized by Bill Stern, Executive Director, Museum of California Design\n\n“At the beginning of the 1930s, when the Depression devastated the American economy and ended the housing boom of the 1920s, some of the biggest California potteries, which had been making architectural and agricultural products—including roof tiles, glazed tiles, and animal feeders—began producing inexpensive pottery dinnerware. In their rush to design new shapes that would distinguish their products from their competitors’, each company adapted forms that had been made with other materials— stone, wood, metal—and forms that came from other cultures including Chinese, Japanese, and Mexican. The sometimes-witty results reveal the freethinking that would become a hallmark of California design.” –Bill Stern\n\nCompanion publication\n\nCalifornia Pottery: From Missions to Modernism\n\nBy Bill Stern, Peter Brenner (Photographer)\n\nChronicle Books (2001)\n\nCarl Rungius: Artist, Sportsman\n\nMarch 29, 2003–June 15, 2003\n\nProduced by the Glenbow Museum, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\n\nCarl Rungius: Artist, Sportsman presented a comprehensive collection of works and artifacts of America's historic painter of big game and first career wildlife artist. This exhibition examined Rungius's contributions to American painting within the context of his life and times for a new understanding of this important but often overlooked artist. Stimulated by its bold landscapes and powerful animals, Rungius influenced popular attitudes toward the American West. As he helped define \"wilderness\" in cultural terms, Carl Rungius: Artist, Sportsman provides us with the opportunity to explore the changing role of wildlife and the environment in twentieth century America.\n\nCompanion Publication\n\nCarl Rungius: Artist & Sportsman\n\nBy Carl Rungius\n\nWarwick House Publishing (2002)\n\nOcean View: The Depiction of Southern California Coastal Lifestyle\n\nNovember 23, 2002–July 27, 2003\n\nProduced in collaboration with the UCR/California Museum of Photography Riverside, CA. Support provided by the California Council for the Humanities.\n\nThis exhibition presented in visual forms the myths, realities, and artistry of the Southern California coastline. Few other places figure so largely in the public imagination. The mythology that health and happiness can be found at the ocean's edge, a myth that with intention and success drew industry wealth and populations from the East to the West, could be read across one hundred years of images. Ocean View told the story of a golden land, a place of \"subtropical twilights and soft westerlies off the Pacific,\" of Waterman, Dogmen, and a girl named Gidget, of failed dreams and new beginnings, of destruction and ecology.\n\nJewish Life in the American West: Generation to Generation\n\nJune 21, 2002–January 20, 2003\n\nThis exhibition explored the history and adventure of Jews in the American West, from early exploration along the Santa Fe Trail in the 1820s through decades of immigration and settlement in Western towns and cities. This exhibition emphasized the contributions of Jews who built their homes throughout the West. From homesteaders in utopian agricultural communities to the entrepreneurs who created one of America’s greatest exports, the film industry, these pioneers became leaders in business, culture, and community identity while contributing to the diversity of Western communities.\n\nCompanion Publication\n\nJewish Life in the American West: Perspectives on Migration, Settlement, and Community\n\nAva F. Kahn, Editor\n\nHeyday (2004)\n\nArt of the Charrería: A Mexican Tradition\n\nMay 5, 2002–October 20, 2002\n\nOrganized by the Autry in cooperation with guest curators Montserrat Mata, Rocío Martínez, and Andrea Cabello; the Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City; the Consulate General of Mexico; and the Federacion Mexicana de Charrería, A.C., with accompanying bilingual publication.\n\nCharrería is a culture, tradition, sport, and art practiced in Mexico and the United States. A central component of charrería is the charreada. The charreada is a festive event that incorporates equestrian competitions and demonstrations, specific costumes and horse trappings, music, and food. Following Federación Mexicana de Charrería regulations, male participants called charros compete in roping and riding events and escaramuza teams of women execute daring feats and precision maneuvers while riding sidesaddle. This rich, ongoing tradition was explored through its distinctive works of art and costume in Art of the Charrería: A Mexican Tradition.\n\nPainted Light: California Impressionist Paintings from the Gardena High School/Los Angeles Unified School District Collection\n\nMarch 24, 2002–May 26, 2002\n\nOrganized by the University Art Gallery, California State University Dominguez Hills, in conjunction with Gardena High School/Los Angeles Unified School District, and made possible by a grant from the W. M. Keck Foundation, Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe story of the Gardena High School art collection is an enduring example of the power of art to rally a community and to shape people’s lives. Each year between 1919 and 1956, Gardena High School seniors collaborated to select and purchase contemporary art that they gifted to the school upon graduation. Thanks to their efforts, Gardena High School now possesses a museum-worthy collection of California Impressionist paintings, including works by some of the state’s most celebrated artists of the early twentieth century. CSU Dominguez Hills was responsible for restoring and organizing the collection for this exhibition after receiving a grant from the W. M. Keck Foundation.\n\nCompanion Publication\n\nPainted Light: California Impressionist Paintings from the Gardena High School/Los Angeles Unified School District Collection\n\nBy Jean Stern\n\nCalifornia State University Dominguez Hills (1998)\n\nMountain–Family–Spirit: The Arts and Culture of the Ute Indians\n\nOctober 30, 2001–February 27, 2002\n\nOrganized by the Taylor Museum at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center.\n\nMountain–Family–Spirit provided an overview of Ute history, culture, and art from the 17th to the 20th century. This comprehensive exhibition on the art and culture of the Ute Indians of Colorado was the result of six years of collaboration. A committee composed of members of the Southern Ute tribe, the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, and the Ute Mountain Ute tribe surveyed 2,000 documented artifacts throughout the country and chose nearly 200 historic and contemporary pieces to represent the Ute art form.\n\nHow the West Was Worn\n\nOctober 20, 2001–January 21, 2002\n\nFrom buckskin and fringe to denim and rhinestones, a wide range of materials and styles has come to represent clothing of the American West. In viewing How the West Was Worn, visitors saw eighty-three examples of Western clothing and costume staged in four chronological galleries, from the 1820s to the present. How the West Was Worn traced the development of Western style from its nineteenth-century frontier roots to the haute couture of runways in New York and Paris.\n\nCompanion publication\n\nHow the West Was Worn\n\nBy Holly George Warren and James H. Nottage\n\nHarry N. Abrams (2001)\n\nMasters of the American West Fine Art Exhibition and Sale\n\nJanuary 31–March 8, 2015\n\nEach year, more than seventy nationally and internationally recognized contemporary Western artists challenge themselves to create and exhibit their very best work. Stylistically and thematically diverse, their works represent the extraordinary range of subject matter that contemporary, historic, and mythic Western experiences continue to inspire.\n\nKim Stringfellow’s Jackrabbit Homestead\n\nSeptember 13, 2014–August 23, 2015\n\nThrough photography and audio interviews, artist Kim Stringfellow explored how the desire to flee the urban sprawl of Los Angeles and stake a claim in the California desert resulted in a collection of derelict cabins from the 1950s and the reclamation of the same land and structures for a burgeoning artistic community today. The exhibition also explored issues of land use and ecology that complicate the settlement of the arid West. In 2012, Stringfellow became the second recipient of the Theo Westenberger Award for Artistic Excellence, presented by the Autry to honor contemporary women whose work in photography, film, and new media transforms how we see the American West.\n\nRoute 66: The Road and the Romance\n\nJune 8, 2014–January 4, 2015\n\nRoute 66: The Road and the Romance took visitors through a historical journey along the iconic symbol of America’s move westward. Visitors were presented with the facts and the fiction surrounding the Mother Road through more than 250 extraordinary artifacts that traced the history of the route and its impact on American popular culture.\n\nFloral Journey: Native North American Beadwork\n\nMarch 15, 2014–April 26, 2015\n\nFloral Journey: Native North American Beadwork delved beneath the surface of its 250 beaded objects to explore the personal stories and cultural meanings behind each piece. The exhibition was the first of its kind to explore how beaded floral designs became a remarkable art form as well as a means of economic and cultural survival for the Native North American people.\n\nCompanion Publication\n\nFloral Journey: Native North American Beadwork\n\nBy Lois Sherr Dubin\n\nAutry / University of Washington Press (2014)\n\nJews in the Los Angeles Mosaic\n\nMay 10, 2013–January 5, 2014\n\nThough Los Angeles is known for its cultural diversity, this groundbreaking exhibition focused on the history of a specific group, the Jewish community, and how they fit their culture and identity into the Los Angeles mosaic. This exhibition told the story of neighborhoods like Boyle Heights and Fairfax, people like Billy Wilder, Max Factor, and Frank Gehry, and lynchpin industries like the movies and suburban land development.\n\nCompanion Publication\n\nJews in the Los Angeles Mosaic\n\nKaren Wilson, Editor\n\nUniversity of California Press (2013)\n\nMasters of the American West Fine Art Exhibition and Sale\n\nFebruary 2–March 17, 2013\n\nEach year, more than seventy nationally and internationally recognized contemporary Western artists challenge themselves to create and exhibit their very best work. Stylistically and thematically diverse, their works represent the extraordinary range of subject matter that contemporary, historic, and mythic Western experiences continue to inspire.\n\nCalifornia's Designing Women, 1896–1986\n\nAugust 10, 2012–January 6, 2013\n\n“The newness of California, and the state’s periodic bursts of population growth, afforded unprecedented opportunities for women to participate in the creation and production of design, one of the principal engines of California’s dynamic economy, now the sixth largest in the world. As California’s extraordinary role in American design is receiving the recognition it has long deserved, California’s Designing Women, 1896–1986 acknowledges the work of more than fifty of the women who, as designers and entrepreneurs, helped make that distinction possible.” —Bill Stern, Guest Curator\n\nKatsina in Hopi Life\n\nJune 29, 2012–December 1, 2013\n\nThis exhibition featured a remarkable collection of Katsina dolls from the Autry’s Southwest Museum of the American Indian Collection, providing a glimpse into Hopi life and culture.
