The tired formula may still have some life left in it, but not this 'Way'. This dud ranch is saddled with the charisma-free teaming of dumb guns Woody Harrelson and Kiefer Sutherland.\"[4]\n\nYear-end lists\n\n[edit]\n\n5th worst – Robert Denerstein, Rocky Mountain News[5]\n\nTop 10 worst (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – Mike Mayo, The Roanoke Times[6]\n\nDishonorable mention – Dan Craft, The Pantagraph[7]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Cowboy Way debuted at number 5 at the US box office and went on to gross $20 million in the United States and Canada and $25 million worldwide.[8][9][2]\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nGood Guys Don't Always Wear White - Bon Jovi\n\nThe Cowboy Way - Travis Tritt\n\nMamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys - Gibson/Miller Band\n\nBlue Danube Blues - Cracker\n\nNo One to Run With - The Allman Brothers Band\n\nOn Broadway - Jeff Beck & Paul Rodgers\n\nDays Gone By - James House\n\nCandy Says - Blind Melon\n\nToo Far Gone - Emmylou Harris\n\nSonny Rides Again - George Thorogood & The Destroyers\n\nFree Your Mind - En Vogue\n\nSuicide Blonde - INXS\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
