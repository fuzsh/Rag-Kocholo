        "text": "\"Be the Cowboy\" is the fifth album by American artist Mitski, released on August 17th 2018 through the label Dead Oceans.\n\nBackground[]\n\nMusically, though the use of traditional indie rock guitar and synth is present, synths are more prominent and there is a return to the use of horns seen on Retired from Sad. The choice to move away from distorted guitar was deliberate, because “that became something people recognized me for, and I wanted to make sure I didn’t repeat myself or unintentionally create a signature sound.”[1], as well as there being an effort to \"figure out ways to pace a song that wasn’t reliant on classic song form.\"[2]\n\nLyrically, the use of characters and metaphors to convey feelings is expanded on significantly from Puberty 2; Mitski has expressed frustration several times over the way that people assume (especially of female songwriters) that songwriting \"pours out\", rather than being a learnt skill. Linked to this, Mitski experimented in the use of narrative on Be the Cowboy- though full characters are not described through songs, Mitski has outlined the idea of:\n\n“a very controlled icy repressed woman who is starting to unravel. Because women have so little power and showing emotion is seen as weakness, this ‘character’ clings to any amount of control she can get. Still, there is something very primordial in her that is trying to find a way to get out.”[3]\n\nBe the Cowboy was written partially while on tour as well as after touring for Puberty 2 had finished (being recorded “little by little in multiple studios between tours”),[4] and as such Mitski saw the album as a process of reconnecting with herself emotionally:\n\n\"A lot of this record was me not having any feelings, being completely spent but then trying to rally myself and wake up and get back to Mitski.\"[5]\n\nA strong artistic theme throughout the album is yearning for what cannot be had either because it no longer exists or never existed- notably, in Nobody and Washing Machine Heart, by making reference to movies (the music video of the latter featuring the character of a \"Silent Film Star\"). What is desired is represented by the highly glamourised fiction seen in films; Mitski has often talked about the strong influence films had on her early life.\n\nTracklist[]\n\nNo. Title Length 1.
