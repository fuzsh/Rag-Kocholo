        "text": "North American Western music is the folk music of the western life style. Its influence reaches from the Badlands of North Dakota, down to the Black Hills, across the plains of Kansas, up and over the Rocky Mountains, through the Mohave Desert, to the shores of California. It stretches from Alaska to Northern Canada and down to South Texas. However, the audience for western music is not necessarily regional, as western artist Maynard Dixon declared, “The spirit of the west sings in every soul.” Western music has a broad appeal and covers a diverse spectrum of elements, emotions, regions, and people that spreads far and wide.\n\nPerhaps the key event in the dissemination of western music, also referred to as cowboy music, was the 1908 publication by N. Howard (\"Jack\") Thorp; a collection of cowboy songs aptly called, Songs of the Cowboys, introducing the American public to cowboy music and its lore. The book is a compilation of songs - mostly from real cowboys - that had been collected during his travels in Texas and New Mexico during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the introduction to the 1927 edition, the author of the introduction, Alice Corbin Henderson, writes: \"The hundred songs that make up this book are typical and genuine cowboy songs; the river and hobo and outlaw songs that are also a part of a cowboy's repertory having been omitted. A number of songs that belong more specifically to the Central States have also been omitted\" (Will Merritt).\n\nSomewhere during the editing process of Songs of the Cowboys, the genesis of western music occurs; the author not only distinguishes a collection of songs particular to the unique experiences of the American cowboy but further refines the collection down to songs (and poems) of cowboys in the American Southwest. As many before Mr. Thorp knew and countless others to follow also discovered, there is something very special about the American cowboy and the land that has come to be known as the American West. It is the place and the history of its inhabitants that continues to inspire songs that can be separately and simultaneously fantastic and true (Will Merritt).\n\nIn addition, a collection of folk music by John A. Lomax, Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads, also played an important role in introducing America to the music of the cowboy and the West. In the 1940s, a radio show made for the Library of Congress recorded Lomax talking about his earliest memories of cowboys. He had seen firsthand the great trail drives after the Civil War. \"I couldn't have been more than 4 years old when I first heard a cowboy yodel and sing to his cattle. I was sleeping in my father's cabin in Texas,\" Lomax said. \"As the cowboys drove the cattle along, they sang, called and yodeled to them. ... They made up songs about trail life\" (Hal Cannon, npr.org).\n\nTraditional cowboy songs were directly influenced by the folk music of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. Many early nineteenth century cowboy songs, such as \"Streets of Laredo,\" can be traced back to these European folk songs. Musical influences from the other European countries of the immigrants who “Went West” can also be found as influences in western music as well as the songs of the Mexican vaquero who preceded the American cowboy, and the African American Cattle-drivers who were not a few. Typical western song themes looked at the cowboy's life, cattle drives, good horses, outlaws, the trail itself, western woman, and other elements of the West.\n\nDon Edwards, a respected traditional cowboy singer, plays many of the songs first popularized by Thorp and Lomax. The first edition of Lomax's book contained 112 songs and a forward by Theodore Roosevelt. In his notes, Lomax credits the spirit of the ancient Anglo-Saxon ballad for inspiring the cowboy song. But when Edwards hears some of these songs, he says it's not ballads he's hearing. \"You take a song like, 'I'm a poor lonesome cowboy, I'm a poor lonesome cowboy, I'm a poor lonesome cowboy, I'm a long long way from my home.' Is that a blues form? It's the earliest blues form there is — three lines and a tag line,\" Edwards says (Hal Cannon, npr.org).\n\nFrom this very straightforward \"folk\" tradition, by the 1930's, the sound of western music was transformed by jazz and the popular music of the day. This new style was exemplified by The Sons of the Pioneers, with sophisticated vocal harmony structures (derived from Mexican mariachis), rich and tightly constructed lyrics and bolstered by the \"Hot Club\" jazz virtuosity of their violin and guitar duo. By the mid-1930's, a new sound for Western music had emerged from The Sons of the Pioneers and it continues to be a standard emulated and aspired to by many Western musical acts today (Will Merritt).\n\nDespite this transformation Western music could still very much be considered \"Cowboy Music\" which continues to be an important part of the genre' today. However, the stories and lifestyles of the larger populations of Western culture are equally important. These include songs about miners, settlers, farmers, ranchers, horsemen, soldiers, opportunists, gamblers, preachers, saloon keepers, school teachers, and other town folk who populated the west."
