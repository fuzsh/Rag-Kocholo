        "text": "Beyoncé\n\nThough talk of Queen Bey’s move to country skyrocketed at the start of this year with her announcement of Renaissance Act II, the singer’s country influences have been strong ever since the days of 2016’s “Daddy Lessons” on Lemonade, which she performed at the Country Music Association Awards with the Dixie Chicks.\n\nAhead of the release of Act II: Cowboy Carter in March, Beyoncé told fans her new album was born from an experience in which she “did not feel welcomed” in the country music world after facing criticism years earlier. “This genre forced me to propel past the limitations that were put on me,” she added, saying Act II “is a result of challenging myself, and taking my time to bend and blend genres together to create this body of work.”\n\nThough the country influences may seem obvious to fans, Beyoncé was also careful to be clear with her audience: “This ain’t a Country album,” she said in the same statement. “This is a ‘Beyoncé’ album.”\n\nRay Charles\n\nAfter getting his start in the 1940s, the late Ray Charles (who died in June 2004) went on to release music across multiple genres, including blues, R&B and pop. But he always felt a connection to country music, and in 1962, he dropped his landmark Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music album. While there were fears that Charles may lose fans, the record actually introduced country music to a broader audience. Modern Sounds topped the Billboard album chart for fourteen weeks and also featured the singer’s iconic recording of Don Gibson’s “I Can’t Stop Loving You.”\n\nNelly\n\nFollowing the release of his 2000 debut album Country Grammar, the rapper received love from other country artists. He later secured his spot in the genre with 2004’s “Over and Over,” featuring Tim McGraw, and then again with the remix of Florida Georgia Line’s “Cruise” in 2013. Both songs peaked in the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Nelly released his country-influenced album Heartland in 2021 and recruited several country artists to be featured on the album, including Darius Rucker, Kane Brown, Jimmie Allen and more.\n\nKid Rock\n\nKid Rock may have once been considered a rapper and rock artist, but in 2002, he pivoted to country with “Picture,” his duet with Sheryl Crow and Allison Moorer. The single peaked at No. 21 on the country chart. He continued to stick with the genre, scoring a No. 4 hit in 2008 with “All Summer Long.” He even hosted the CMT Music Awards in 2010 and 2011. Kid Rock has teamed up with several other country icons throughout his career, including Kenny Chesney, Willie Nelson and Martina McBride.\n\nCassadee Pope\n\nBefore Cassadee Pope embarked on her solo music journey, she was the lead vocalist and songwriter of the pop rock band Hey Monday. Then in 2012, she decided to transition to country music and joined Blake Shelton’s team on NBC’s The Voice, which she ultimately won. She released her debut solo country album, Frame by Frame, in 2013, which peaked at No. 1 on Top Country Albums. She later released her third full-length studio album, Thrive, in 2021, a year before announcing she was stepping away from country music and returning to her roots in pop-punk.\n\nThe Byrds\n\nThough The Byrds’ transition from folk-rock into country wasn’t the smoothest, their 1968 album Sweetheart of the Rodeo is still credited as the birth of the country rock genre. The album only peaked at No. 77 on the charts, but the album’s legacy is still remembered today. It was also the first album released by the re-vamped band after original members David Crosby and Michael Clarke left. Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman knew they couldn’t create a country-sounding record alone, so they brought in country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons and drummer Kevin Kelley to help make Sweetheart of the Rodeo.\n\nSteven Tyler\n\nSteven Tyler has been at the helm of American rock band Aerosmith since the 1970s, but fast-forward several decades, and the artist decided to branch out of the rock genre for his solo music career. After seemingly making Nashville his home away from Aerosmith, he released his debut county single “Love Is Your Name” in 2015. He then followed it up with a full-length album, We’re All Somebody from Somewhere, in 2016, which debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Country Albums chart.\n\nBob Dylan\n\nBob Dylan always had an appreciation for country music, even early in his career. While he started out focused mostly on a rock, folk and eventually pop sound, by the mid-1960s, the legendary singer-songwriter made his first trip to Nashville to record his seventh album, Blonde on Blonde. The record had more of a rock feel, but it set the stage for his next two albums, John Wesley Harding and Nashville Skyline, which marked his transition to country. Some of the most notable tracks included “Lay Lady Lay,” and his duet with Johnny Cash on “Girl from the North Country.”\n\nElle King\n\nElle King, daughter of Saturday Night Live comedian Rob Schneider, first rose to fame as a pop artist in 2012 with The Elle King EP. In 2015, she shifted to country with her major hit “Exes and Ohs” and then became a featured duet guest on Dierks Bentley’s “Different for Girls” in 2016. Later, she also shared credit with Miranda Lambert on “Drunk (And I Don’t Want to Go Home)” in 2021. King has earned four Grammy nominations, two for rock categories and the other two for country.\n\nLionel Richie\n\nLionel Richie first rose to fame as a lead singer of Motown group the Commodores in the 1970s. He is also a member of the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and a four-time Grammy winner.\n\nBut, along his long and winding road to success, Richie took a one stop in the country music world: He released Tuskegee in 2012, an album named after his hometown Alabama city which features 13 duets with country stars including Shania Twain, Blake Shelton, Jason Aldean, Kenny Chesney, Kenny Rogers, Willie Nelson and more. Tuskegee remains Richie’s most recently released studio album.\n\nDarius Rucker\n\nThough known as an established country artist today, singer-songwriter Darius Rucker first rose to fame as the lead vocalist of rock band Hootie & the Blowfish. The band released five studio albums, many of which Rucker co-wrote, before he branched out on his own and eventually signed to Capitol Nashville as a country singer in 2008. He has been a mainstay of the genre ever since, and in 2013, won the Grammy for best country solo performance for his smash hit, “Wagon Wheel.”\n\nLil Nas X\n\nLil Nas X, born Montero Lamar Hill, shot to fame in 2019 amid a so-called culture war over his status as a country star. The singer’s rap-country smash hit “Old Town Road” first went viral on TikTok before debuting on Billboard‘s Hot Country Songs chart, only to be then removed from the same chart some weeks later.\n\n“While ‘Old Town Road’ incorporates references to country and cowboy imagery, it does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version,” a Billboard statement to Rolling Stone read at the time.\n\nStill, the song cemented itself in the country’s zeitgeist, and a version that the rapper recorded with country singer Billy Ray Cyrus went on to spend 19 weeks atop Billboard‘s Hot 100 list, the most of any song in the chart’s history."
