Highlights, Songs and Lyrics

Every track on $10 Cowboy has something unique to captivate its listeners, but some stand out for their unique storytelling and musical style as Crockett dabbles in the surreal with added synth and dreamlike organs.

The song America features a somber yet intense dialogue between the protagonist and the nation, critiquing its flaws against a backdrop of organ and saxophone solos. However, it is in his cowboy-esque tales and ballads where Crockett’s songwriting and vocal talents truly shine.

Hard Luck and Circumstances harks back to the classic country music of the 1950s, complete with honky-tonk guitars and Telecaster licks. Crockett’s voice, straight from the old tubed radio, moans his struggles through the chorus: “Hard luck and circumstances brought me here, and if they hang around any longer, I might just disappear.”

Right on the heels of Hard Luck and Circumstances, we get another uppercut to the heart with Good At Losing, echoing this poor dude’s misfortune in nearly every city. Musically, it stays true to the cowboy way, incorporating fiddles (or violins……) and grand pianos.

More Standout Tracks

One of the standout tracks on the album is Spade, a classic country and western ballad that captures angst and tension. This song tells the story of a drifter who takes justice into his own hands against those who wronged him. Its galloping rhythm is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.

Another highlight is Ain’t Done Losing Yet, which could be called the new blue-collar anthem. This track revisits the familiar theme of bad luck and hard times, but with a melancholic yet positive twist. With a determined attitude to either win or have a great time trying, Crockett belts out the lyrics, “I ain’t done losing yet,” with pride.

Solitary Road takes listeners on another journey into cowboy ballad brilliance. With hard-driving guitars, a synth organ, and an urgent drum rhythm, the song paints a vivid picture of a Solitary Road filled with vagrants, jackals, and filth as Crockett makes his way to the “city.” The writing is a testament to Crockett’s skill, with a deliberate yet ambiguous meaning filled with biblical-esque metaphors drawing parallels to a downtrodden musician. This powerful cinematic tune is well-suited to accompany the big screen.
