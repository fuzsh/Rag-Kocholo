        "text": "Robert Black knows how to market a product.\n\nThe 76-year-old inventor/entrepreneur, who holds 16 patents, struck gold in the late 1990s with a product he invented called Clean Shower.\n\nClean Shower was a spray that kept a shower clean without the necessity of regularly scrubbing it. Black invented the spray in 1988 because he was sick of cleaning his own shower. But inventing the product was the easy part. It wasn't until 1995 that Black convinced Gate stores to begin stocking the product.\n\nBut as word of Clean Shower's effectiveness spread, sales took off.\n\nBy November 1997, the company was doing $12 million in annual sales and attracting national attention. Clean Shower even made a bid in 1997 to buy naming rights to Jacksonville's football stadium, now known as EverBank Field. Two years later, the Clean Shower company and another bathroom cleaning product manufacturer were bought by Church & Dwight Co. in a deal worth $55 million.\n\nNow, Black has got a new product to market. In April 2014, he met the senior management of Boston Therapeutics at an investment conference in Orlando. Boston Therapeutics had created a chewable tablet it called Sugar Down, developed to prevent sugar spikes in diabetics by blocking enzymes that break down complex carbohydrates. The result is that the carbohydrates pass through the digestive system without being absorbed into the blood.\n\nBlack, who has a bachelor of science degree in chemistry from Penn State, a master's in electrical engineering from the University of Missouri and a master's in finance from the University of Akron, loved the product enough to make a small investment in it. But he thought Boston Therapeutics was looking at the wrong potential market.\n\n\"I'm a biochemist,\" Black said. \"I recognized that this was really going to be a hit ... But I thought that their market should be people on their way to developing type 2 diabetes.\"\n\nHe also believed Sugar Down, which has gone through two clinical trials, should be released as an over-the-counter product. Black now is starting small in his campaign, having gotten four Jacksonville independent pharmacies to agree to carry Sugar Down. They are Weise Prescription Shop, 4343 Colonial Ave.; Duval Pharmacy, 2386 Dunn Ave., No. 117; Lake Pharmacy, 5875 San Juan Ave.; and Smart Pharmacy, 14003 Beach Blvd. Next, he said, he wants to follow the Clean Shower marketing model by gradually expanding to other markets, beginning in the Boston area.\n\n\"I think this can be at least as big as Clean Shower,\" Black said.\n\nWhen he's not making plans for marketing Sugar Down, the father of two and grandfather of eight teaches courses on investing and happiness for the University of North Florida's lifelong learning program and serves as a technical consultant to Hydropure Technologies, which makes Pool Refresh, a product that removes phosphates, metals, bacteria and algae from swimming pools.\n\ncharlie.patton@jacksonville.com,\n\n(904) 359-4413"
