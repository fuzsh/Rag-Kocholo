        "text": "\"Robert Black’s Theory of Knowledge class was something of a legend among IB students at North Canyon High School. Though we heard rumors of its contents throughout our first three years, none of us really knew what it was going to be before we experienced it firsthand during senior year. I think a lot of us, myself included, would still have difficulty defining it even now. Nevertheless, the lessons I learned from Mr. Black in this class are many and deep, and they have played a defining role in making me who I am today. Mr. Black taught us to consider issues and events from multiple viewpoints, helping us realize that there is never just one side to any story, no matter how straightforward it may seem on the surface. This understanding has proven incredibly powerful during my years of time abroad since graduating high school, encouraging me to be sensitive to other cultures and ways of living. Ultimately, it has pushed me to do work throughout my life that is cross-cultural and that helps connect people from different backgrounds. I would not have reached this place without Mr. Black. I remember Mr. Black telling us that he hoped we would fail at least one thing in his class. When we first heard this, we merely worried about the harm failing something would do to our academic records. But when I failed one of his quizzes a few months later, I began to see the value in this experience. Failure helped me realize that it’s not necessary to do everything perfectly, preparing me for later times in my life where I couldn’t succeed at everything I intended. Instead, I learned that since failure is not the end of the world, it’s important to keep persevering if unsuccessful the first time. Mr. Black gave me this perspective and resilience. Near the end of our time in Mr. Black’s class, a student expressed the fear many of us held that high school was meant to be the best years of our lives and that this time was quickly drawing to a close. I will never forget Mr. Black’s response to this concern, and it will continue to be part of my personal philosophy for the rest of my life. He said, ? I hope that every year will be the best year of your life so far.? This helped me realize that there is no need to live according to predetermined norms; rather, we should trace our own paths and make them as enjoyable and meaningful as possible. Every year (month, day!) is a chance to improve. Robert Black was one of the most inspirational teachers I have ever had. I will carry and spread his incredible influence as long as I am alive, and he will similarly live on in all of the students who were privileged enough to have learned from him. I offer my sincerest condolences to Jill, Juliana, and Trevor. Please know that the mark he has left on his students will never fade from this world.\"\n\n\"It was with the most profound sadness that our family learned of Mr. Black’s passing. Robert has meant so much to our family and has touched all of our lives over the last several years. As a respected teacher, extraordinary mentor, and genuinely caring individual; his talent, enthusiasm and commitment to North Canyon, the IB Program, and most importantly, his students, will be impossible to fully replace. The legacy of his contributions to the school, the community, and the students he served will live on for many years to come in the lives of those students, parents, and colleagues he touched. The incredible number of students that have gone out into the world better educated and better prepared because of their experiences with him, is a testament to his far-reaching impact beyond just the North Canyon community. I, personally, find it a terrible loss, as I considered Robert a friend, beyond our professional associations with my daughters and the IB program. Over the past several years I have worked with Robert to develop some enrichment programs for juniors and seniors in the IB program. The opportunity to work with him was immensely rewarding along so many dimensions. He will be missed by so many, but our thoughts are now first and foremost with the family he loved. We hope that they find some comfort in the knowledge of the many lives he touched and how much he gave to all of us.\"\n\n\"It is seldom that a teacher in a school of countless students can truly influence and positively change the lives of those students. Undoubtedly, that rare individual is Mr. Black. This year and last, I had the greatest pleasure of being taught by such an intensely learned and competent person. On the whole, I am a skeptic who is hard pressed to see things in different lights but I can honestly say Mr. Black allowed me to do just that. I always appreciated his sarcasm, humor, quirky pronunciations, and playfully stern gaze he gave every time I asked to go to the bathroom before class. Most notably, he was the teacher this year who truly took the time to ask me how my life was going when I was going through some difficult times. Not only did he stop to chat but he genuinely took the time to make sure I was all right. I appreciated the gesture at the time so much and in retrospect, I see that none of what he did was out of necessity. He consciously chose to make every comment that influenced me and my classmates daily. He will truly never be forgotten in my mind or in the minds of any who had the pleasure of being taught by him. Thank you Mr. Black...for everything.\"\n\n\"15 and a half years ago, I was embarking upon my student teaching and was assigned to Robert Black’s classroom at NCHS. I had no idea who he was or what I was getting into. 15 years later, I have been an English teacher in my own classroom, and I owe much of who I am as a teacher to Robert Black. He challenged me to be not just a good teacher, but to be a great teacher. I will never forget when he sat me down and asked me if I really wanted to be a teacher and why. It is a conversation that I often replay in my mind. It was so powerful and influential. Thank you Robert for your dedication to education and to students. My prayers are with your family during this time of grief and loss.\"\n\n\"I was saddened to hear the news of Mr. Black. I have many memories of my years in HS. I remember Mr. Black first and foremost above all of my other teachers. He came across tough but genuinely cared for his students. He pushed me to try harder. He made me feel proud of myself when I didn’t think there was much reason to be proud of anything I had been doing at that time. He taught me how to love poetry. I remember one of my poems getting into the ’95 Lit Mag. I couldn’t stop writing after that. I even had a poem published a few years later. I wrote a letter, to Mr. Black, thanking him after that. My heart is sad, thinking of all the people who will miss out on meeting Mr. Black. I can still see him sitting on his stool, at the front of the class, reading so eloquently. \"I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.\" Mr. Black was different from the others and he made a difference in my life. Thank you.\"\n\n\"What can I say that could possibly express how I feel about the loss of Robert Black? A dear friend and esteemed colleague of 20+ years, Robert was a constant in my life. I could go to him for help with department matters, personal issues, or grammar questions, and he would be there immediately to help in any way he could. In hard times, he would sympathetically tell me to \"buck up’; in good times, he would say, \"very cool\". His colleagues and his former students were graced by his steady and demanding influence and entertained by his wonderful sense of humor. Robert, I always thought of you as my brilliant, sometimes annoying, little brother who was always there for me. I will miss you greatly, and my heart breaks for Jilly, Trevor and Juliana. I hope that you are now there, with our dearly departed friend Geri, doing the crossword, talking politics, and having a good cold one. Ironically, I want to make sure this sounds right, but the person I would normally call to find out, is you.\""
