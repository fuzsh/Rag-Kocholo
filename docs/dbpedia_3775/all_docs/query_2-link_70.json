        "text": "Black Men and Public Spacing Since the dawn of time, colored people have always been treated unfairly. In “Black Men and Public Spacing”, Staples discusses the ongoing problem of being considered a possible assailant due to his race and appearance. He gets into the horrendous facts that “black people” face and that, unfortunately, remains part of our world. As he starts his story he says, \"My first victim was a woman—white, well dressed, probably in her early twenties.\n\nSummarize The Case Of James Byrd Jr.\n\n1141 Words | 5 Pages\n\nSummarized account On June 7th 1998, James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old African American male, was walking home alone after a night of drinking with friends and family in Jasper, Texas. As Byrd was walking home, he was stopped and offered a ride from three drunk white men. Byrd accepted the ride and climbed into the back of the pickup truck. The men in the truck were Shawn Berry, Lawrence Brewer, and John King, and they had no intention of taking Byrd home that night.\n\nWhy Is Ruby Adams Trial Wrong\n\n669 Words | 3 Pages\n\nIn Live Oak, Florida, the year of 1952, an African American woman named Ruby McCollum was arrested and convicted for killing a white doctor named C. Leroy Adams. During this point in time, racism was even more alive than it is today. It was said that McCollum was lucky to have even gotten a trial at all instead of just being lynched. Her trial is very interesting to me because she stood up against people that wanted to see her be put in prison for the rest of her life. To be specific, none of the jury were female, and all of them were white, some of whom were patients of Dr. Adams.\n\nJennifer Gonnerman\n\n1500 Words | 6 Pages\n\nAs a young african american male, I’ve encountered many challenges and obstacles that has been tough to overcome for any male; especially male of color. Novelist Jennifer Gonnerman shared one forth of what African American males go through on a day to day basis, in her article, “Before the Law,” that sheds light on a particular incident about a kid from Bronx named Kalief Browder; who was falsely accused of taking a backpack from a New York resident on the day of Saturday, May 15, 2010. Kalief Browder spent the next two to three years confined in Rikers Island (Correctional Facility), which is a four-hundred-acre island in the EastRiver, between Queens and the Bronx. Kalief Browder was being charged with many charges such as robbery, grand\n\nThough Brent Staples writes “Black Men in Public Space” in essay form, and Toni Morrison’s “Recitatif” is a short story, both authors explore similar ideas about race, the power of racial stereotypes, and the harmful effect of them. Staples use of irony, and Morrison’s symbolic use of metaphor shows that every situation has multiple perspectives and to not look outside of one individual experience can often induce one to accept stereotypes as full truths. As Staples discusses the stereotypes attached to black males, he writes about “the alienation that comes of being ever the suspect”(2). The word suspect literally means a person thought to be guilty of a crime or offense, but here it is used in an ironic perspective. Staples really wasn’t\n\nSimilarities Between Tucker And Etheridge\n\n638 Words | 3 Pages\n\nRichard was faced with challenges when it came to his job in the life saving service. He had a promotion but people did not think he was “qualified”. “The white surfmen on Etheridge’s team quit in protest. And his Life-Saving service station was burned the to the ground by a group who thought a black man should not hold such a high position. ”Tucker was too young and too short to join the life saving service or the\n\nRhetorical Analysis Of Letter To My Son\n\n947 Words | 4 Pages\n\nHe uses ethos to show the reputation of systematic abuse towards black bodies that are entrenched deep in America's history, the primary focus of the\n\nAuthor Darryl Lorenzo Wellington, wrote “The Power of Black Lives Matter,” published in 2015 in The Crisis, and he emphasizes the importance of Black Lives Matter and argues that is the only way to correct the issue of class. Wellington builds his credibility with reputable facts, statistics, citing sources, and successfully employing rhetorical appeals such as ethos, pathos, and logos. He adopts a didactic tone of voice in order to sound like a high scholar to create a sense of superiority, while addressing the issues of class and race to white Americans’ and other races in the United States. In his article, Wellington first introduces his argument by making an inference of a cultural shift by saying, “Something indeed is happening here and now in America,” and that “class exists” and\n\nHe wrote this piece to express his important opinion about the effect of racism and how he’s viewed as a man of color. He talks about his first encounter of racism when he was young man in college and was assumed to be a mugger or killer just because of skin. “It was in echo of that terrified woman’s footfalls that I first began to know the unwieldy inheritance I’d come into the ability to alter public space in ugly ways.” I feel that the author is trying to connect to his vast audience of people who don’t understand what it is like to a black man in society. Later he contemplated that he rejected or shunned by the white race collectively as a dangerous man.\n\nIsolation In Richard Wright's Black Boy\n\n1024 Words | 5 Pages\n\nIn Black Boy, Richard Wright leads a difficult life, yet he is able to persevere through it. Richard has an independent personality that protects him from getting betrayed, but his stubbornness causes him trouble to adapt to a better life. His superior intelligence gives him an advantage over others and makes him think about the future more than others, but they mistreat him for it. Because of his high intelligence, he shares a different moral of equality that makes him stand alone against the whites. The unique personality and beliefs of Richard Wright, like his stubbornness to change, lead to a life of isolation that caused his actions to deviate towards conflict pushing others away.\n\nThe Struggle In Richard Wright's The Black Boy\n\n214 Words | 1 Pages\n\nIn the memoir “The Black Boy” by Richard Wright, it tells a story in first person view of a young six-year-old boy who lives his life during the Jim Crow time period.

With recent cases of Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin and the crimes of San Jose University, I believe this research is more than needed. By researching several forms of accurate and up-to-date literature and research findings I will promote and compile the most accurate and efficient research of these factors as possible with the prevalent information found from over 20 different sources, direct and indirect. Subjects will include and will be limited to African Americans between the ages of 15 and 35, Law Enforcement Officials within Southern States v. Northern States, and Parental Figures of those who have lives lost.

Richard undergoes many changes as an individual because of the experience he has growing up in the south and learning how to act around whites.\n\nRacism And Violence In Richard Wright's Black Boy\n\n671 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe novel Black Boy by Richard Wright exhibits the theme of race and violence.

Throughout the work, Richard observes the deleterious effects of racism not only as it affects relations between whites and blacks, but also relations among blacks themselves."
