        "text": "Robert “Bob” F. Black Sr., 73, passed away peacefully on Wednesday, August 16th, 2023 at Winchester Hospital surrounded by his family. He was predeceased by his parents, Robert and Eleanor (Kling) Black.\n\nBob was born in Arlington and spent his first few years in Cambridge before moving to the Central Square area of Woburn with his family. He attended Woburn Public Schools and eagerly enlisted in the United States Navy in 1968 amidst the Vietnam War. He served at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, MD, as an Aircraft Mechanic in Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron (VQ)-4.\n\nFollowing his enlistment, Bob returned to Woburn and worked as a heavy diesel truck mechanic for several years before joining Teamsters, Local 25 as a truck driver. He drove for various trucking companies over the years including Tose-Fowler, St. Johnsbury, and USF Red Star from which he retired in 2006. Although Bob was humble in every regard, he said “I’ve got more miles backing up than you’ve got going forward” on more than one occasion.\n\nIn January 1989, Bob married his beloved wife Carolyn Black (Generazzo). Together, they dedicated their lives to their children, sharing in sporting events, graduations, weddings, as well as love and laughter around the dining room table.\n\nIn retirement, Bob found joy in service to his community as a member of the Woburn Lions Breakfast Club. He was very proud to plant the club’s Memory Tree in North Woburn, faithfully tending to it while it took root. Bob went on to become President and also served on the Board of Directors for many years.\n\nBob enjoyed travelling with his family when he could. A diehard Buddy Holly fan, Bob drove the family to Buddy’s hometown of Lubbock, TX. They also made many trips to Amish Country, PA, Vermont, and Aruba. In recent years, Bob and Carol visited Homer, AK for their anniversary and Bob said it was the most beautiful place he had ever seen.\n\nWhen Bob was not behind the wheel, he was happiest on the ocean with a fishing rod in hand or pulling up lobster pots alongside his children. He also restored a 1959 Ford Thunderbird, ‘Peggy Sue,’ with his daughter that he proudly showed at local car shows and each year in Woburn’s annual Halloween parade. After Everett’s opening of Encore, Bob enjoyed trips to the casino!"
