        "text": "As Christmas draws nearer, I wanted to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the sweetest, loveliest man I‚Äôve ever known. Two weeks ago, my beloved dad was called home after 79 years. My father never had a cruel word or disparaging comment for anyone in the time he spent on this earth. It was that same kindness and compassion which made him a favorite of so many. Christmastime was his favorite time of year, so naturally this year will be challenging without him. Except that‚Äôs not really true, because I know that he will live on in the hearts of his children, grandchildren, and his great-granddaughter. So much of who I am today I owe to Robert Black. I love you, Dad, and whenever I look at a Christmas tree or sing a song of faith and love, I‚Äôll think of you.\n\nAs Christmas draws nearer, I wanted to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the sweetest, loveliest man I‚Äôve ever known.

Bob was an extremely kind and fun person. I regret that after graduation I did not have contact with him but always thought of him and Ann. I had the opportunity to know him well, because my Daddy worked for his grandparents and his parents, so our families had many exchanges other than our school relationship. I will remember him and his family forever. May you all be blessed during this time of sorrow. He will be walking beside you every day, never seen or heard, but he will always be there. Rest in Peace, Bob. Arlene Maul Dusenbery\n\nBob Black was in my graduating class of Adams City 1959, as well as his wife, Ann. Bob was an extremely kind and fun person.

He endured a lot throughout his life, but above all he was caring to all around him and strived to make everyone happy, even at his own expense. Along with being a great husband, father, and grandfather, he was my friend, and I will miss him deeply. I know that he is now out of pain and enjoying some prime rib and a few beers with my dad as they look over us this holiday season! With love always your son in law,Tynr\n\nüïØÔ∏è To all that didn‚Äôt know my father in law, he was the most compassionate man I have ever known.
