        "text": "A 64-year-old van driver, already convicted of killing three schoolgirls, has been found guilty of a fourth child murder.\n\nRobert Black now ranks among Britain's most prolific serial killers.\n\nScotland-born Black had denied murdering Jennifer Cardy in August 1981.\n\nThe nine-year-old disappeared after leaving her home at Balinderry in County Antrim to cycle the short distance to a friend's house.\n\nThe discovery of her red bicycle sparked a six-day search.\n\nTwo young fishermen found her body floating in McKee's Dam near Hillsborough, off the main Belfast-to-Dublin road, 15 miles from her home.\n\nA retired policeman, speaking on condition of anonymity, recalled the tragic events.\n\n\"It was the height of 'The Troubles' here but the case of Jennifer Cardy left a lasting impression.\"\n\nThe prosecution presented a fuel receipt, a bonus paid to drivers and billboard poster deliveries as evidence that Black, a London-based driver, had been in Northern Ireland at the time.\n\nJurors heard audio recordings of police interviews, during which he admitted touring swimming pools and beaches to spy on children.\n\nThey were also given chilling details of his previous convictions.\n\nSusan Maxwell (11) was abducted from Cornhill on Tweed in Scotland in July 1982; Caroline Hogg (5) from Portobello in Edinburgh in July 1983; and Sarah Harper (10) from Morley in Leeds in March 1986.\n\nAll three bodies were discovered within a 25-mile radius.\n\nIn 1990, Black was arrested and a girl rescued from his van at Stow in the Scottish borders.\n\nPolice had apprehended the serial child killer.\n\nCriminologist Professor David Wilson said: \"Black did not entice like Brady and Hindley or Huntley but rather snatched children as they ran errands, played in the park or walked home.\n\n\"He killed childhood as much as he killed children.\""
