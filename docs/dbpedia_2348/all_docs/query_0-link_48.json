Products such as rye bread and baguettes are baked and sold on local bread delivery rounds six days a week.\n\nPicture here, the company truck that delivers baked goods to local customers.\n\nGrowing bigger year by year, the bakery moves to larger premises in 1955. It now employs five people, and some of its production is sold in stores and supermarkets.\n\nInga Lægaard in front of Højslev K. Bakery.\n\nDividing the product range among the three bakeries frees up packaging machine capacity. New to the range are mixed dried fruits and nuts.\n\nA former employee packaging pecans for a customer.\n\nWith contract packaging now accounting for a huge proportion of sales, the company decides to build a new 2,000 m2 production and storage facility exclusively for these activities. The new activities also need a new name, and so Scan Pack A/S is born. Over the next 21 years, the product range is constantly developed and expanded, and, after several extensions, the building ultimately covers 4,000 m2. Scan Pack A/S has now been packing HARIBO’s Pingvin sweets for a number of years, along with various foods produced by a host of other Danish and foreign manufacturers.\n\nRice, breadcrumbs, nuts and potato flour have become the most important products packed here and sold to practically every retail chain in Denmark as well as in some other Nordic countries.\n\nScan Pack back in 2009."
