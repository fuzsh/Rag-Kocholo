        "text": "Beskyttelse af personlige oplysninger\n\nBeskyttelsen af dine persondata er vigtigt for HOMAG Group.\n\nWe are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the HOMAG Group AG. The use of the Internet pages of the HOMAG Group AG is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.\n\nThe processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the HOMAG Group AG. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.\n\nAs the controller, the HOMAG Group AG has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.\n\nWith the following privacy policy we would like to inform you which types of your personal data (hereinafter also abbreviated as \"data\") we process for which purposes and in which scope. The privacy statement applies to all processing of personal data carried out by us, both in the context of providing our services and in particular on our websites, in mobile applications and within external online presences, such as our social media profiles (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"online services\").\n\nThe terms used are not gender-specific.\n\nOverview of processing operations\n\nThe following table summarises the types of data processed, the purposes for which they are processed and the concerned data subjects.\n\nCategories of Processed Data\n\nInventory data.\n\nPayment Data.\n\nContact data.\n\nContent data.\n\nContract data.\n\nUsage data.\n\nMeta/communication data.\n\nJob applicant details.\n\nImages and/ or video recordings.\n\nAudio recordings.\n\nEvent Data (Facebook).\n\nCategories of Data Subjects\n\nCustomers.\n\nEmployees.\n\nProspective customers.\n\nCommunication partner.\n\nUsers.\n\nJob applicants.\n\nParticipants in sweepstakes and competitions.\n\nBusiness and contractual partners.\n\nPurposes of Processing\n\nProvision of contractual services and customer support.\n\nContact requests and communication.\n\nSecurity measures.\n\nDirect marketing.\n\nWeb Analytics.\n\nOffice and organisational procedures.\n\nRemarketing.\n\nConversion tracking.\n\nAffiliate Tracking.\n\nManaging and responding to inquiries.\n\nJob Application Process.\n\nConducting sweepstakes and contests.\n\nFeedback.\n\nPolls and Questionnaires.\n\nMarketing.\n\nProfiles with user-related information.\n\nCustom Audiences.\n\nAuthentication processes.\n\nProvision of our online services and usability.\n\nAssessment of creditworthiness.\n\nAutomated Individual Decision-Making\n\nCredit report.\n\nLegal Bases for the Processing\n\nIn the following, you will find an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on which we base the processing of personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection provisions of your or our country of residence or domicile may apply. If, in addition, more specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.\n\nConsent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR) - The data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.\n\nPerformance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR) - Performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.\n\nCompliance with a legal obligation (Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR) - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.\n\nLegitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR) - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.\n\nJob application process as a pre-contractual or contractual relationship (Article 9 (2)(b) GDPR) - If special categories of personal data within the meaning of Article 9 (1) GDPR (e.g. health data, such as severely handicapped status or ethnic origin) are requested from applicants within the framework of the application procedure, so that the responsible person or the person concerned can carry out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social protection law, their processing shall be carried out in accordance with Article 9 (2)(b) GDPR , in the case of the protection of vital interests of applicants or other persons on the basis of Article 9 (2)(c) GDPR or for the purposes of preventive health care or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the employee's ability to work, for medical diagnostics, care or treatment in the health or social sector or for the administration of systems and services in the health or social sector in accordance with Article 9 (2)(d) GDPR. In the case of a communication of special categories of data based on voluntary consent, their processing is carried out on the basis of Article 9 (2)(a) GDPR.\n\nPerformance of a contract and prior requests (EKD) (§ 6 No. 5 DSG-EKD) - Performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.\n\nIn addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations apply to data protection in Germany. This includes in particular the Law on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special provisions on the right to access, the right to erase, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for the purposes of the employment relationship (§ 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, execution or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of employees. Furthermore, data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.\n\nSecurity Precautions\n\nWe take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.\n\nThe measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input, transmission, securing and separation of the data. In addition, we have established procedures to ensure that data subjects' rights are respected, that data is erased, and that we are prepared to respond to data threats rapidly. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account as early as the development or selection of hardware, software and service providers, in accordance with the principle of privacy by design and privacy by default.\n\nMasking of the IP address: If IP addresses are processed by us or by the service providers and technologies used and the processing of a complete IP address is not necessary, the IP address is shortened (also referred to as \"IP masking\"). In this process, the last two digits or the last part of the IP address after a full stop are removed or replaced by wildcards. The masking of the IP address is intended to prevent the identification of a person by means of their IP address or to make such identification significantly more difficult.\n\nSSL encryption (https): In order to protect your data transmitted via our online services in the best possible way, we use SSL encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address bar of your browser.\n\nTransmission of Personal Data\n\nIn the context of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to other places, companies or persons or that it is disclosed to them. Recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are embedded in a website. In such a case, the legal requirements will be respected and in particular corresponding contracts or agreements, which serve the protection of your data, will be concluded with the recipients of your data.\n\nData Transmission within the Group of Companies: We may transfer personal data to other companies within our group of companies or otherwise grant them access to this data. Insofar as this disclosure is for administrative purposes, the disclosure of the data is based on our legitimate business and economic interests or otherwise, if it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations or if the consent of the data subjects or otherwise a legal permission is present.\n\nJoint CRM system that we operate as Joint Controller\n\nThe companies of the Dürr Group - which include the HOMAG Group - operate a joint customer database (CRM system) and to this extent act as Joint Controllers within the meaning of Art. 26 DSGVO (also referred to as Joint Controllers).\n\nYou can view the companies of the Dürr Group here https://www.durr-group.com/fileadmin/durr-group.com/Home/duerr-privacy-notice.pdf. In principle, the data is stored for as long as is necessary for the purpose of collection or required by law, or if we have a legitimate interest in storing it, for example legal enforcement.\n\nIf this involves transferring data to Dürr companies outside the EEA, we rely on the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission. We also refer to the explanations on \"Data Processing in Third Countries\".\n\nThe CRM system is provided by Salesforce. The storage location is the EU. A transfer of data to companies of the Salesforce Group outside the EEA is not excluded (see details on Salesforce below).\n\nInternally, we have distributed responsibilities in a contract as follows: Data subjects can contact all jointly responsible parties to exercise data subject rights (see details on data subject rights under \"Data subject rights\").\n\nThe Dürr Group company to which you have provided your data will nevertheless act as your first point of contact. Responsible for the information obligations under Art. 13 f. DSGVO is Dürr Systems AG, which is the lead operator of the CRM system. The jointly responsible parties are responsible for fulfilling the required notification obligations and maintaining documentation within the scope of their area of activity, for obligating employees to confidentiality and informing them of their obligations under data protection law, and for ensuring technical and organizational security in data processing.\n\nService provider: salesforce.com Germany GmbH, Erika-Mann-Str. 31, 80636 München, Germany; Website:https://www.salesforce.com; Privacy Policy: https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/; Data Processing Agreement: https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/legal/Agreements/data-processing-addendum.pdf; Standard Contractual Clauses (Safeguarding the level of data protection when processing data in third countries): https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/legal/Agreements/scc-amendment.pdf; Further Information: Data Protection Impact Assessments & Salesforce Services: https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/legal/Privacy/dpia-and-salesforce-services.pdf.\n\nInternational data transfers\n\nIf we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third party services or disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this will only take place in accordance with the legal requirements.\n\nSubject to express consent or transfer required by contract or law, we process or have processed the data only in third countries with a recognised level of data protection, on the basis of special guarantees, such as a contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission or if certifications or binding internal data protection regulations justify the processing (Article 44 to 49 GDPR, information page of the EU Commission: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en).\n\nData Processing in Third Countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if the processing takes place within the scope of using services of third parties or the disclosure or transmission of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this only occurs in compliance with legal requirements.\n\nSubject to explicit consent or contractually or legally required transmission (see Art. 49 GDPR), we process or have the data processed only in third countries with a recognized level of data protection (Art. 45 GDPR), when contractual obligations are observed and adhered to by so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission (Art. 46 GDPR) or when certifications or binding internal data protection regulations exist (see Art. 44 to 49 GDPR, Information page of the EU Commission: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en).\n\nEU-US Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework: Within the context of the so-called \"Data Privacy Framework\" (DPF), the EU Commission has also recognized the data protection level for certain companies from the USA as secure within the adequacy decision of 10th July 2023. The list of certified companies as well as additional information about the DPF can be found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/. We will inform you which of our service providers are certified under the Data Privacy Framework as part of our data protection notices.\n\nErasure of data\n\nThe data processed by us will be erased in accordance with the statutory provisions as soon as their processing is revoked or other permissions no longer apply (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data no longer applies or they are not required for the purpose).\n\nIf the data is not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing is limited to these purposes. This means that the data will be restricted and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be stored for commercial or tax reasons or for which storage is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.\n\nIn the context of our information on data processing, we may provide users with further information on the deletion and retention of data that is specific to the respective processing operation.\n\nUse of Cookies\n\nCookies are small text files or other data records that store information on end devices and read information from the end devices. For example, to store the login status in a user account, the contents of a shopping cart in an e-shop, the contents accessed or the functions used. Cookies can also be used for various purposes, e.g. for purposes of functionality, security and convenience of online offers as well as the creation of analyses of visitor flows.\n\nInformation on consent: We use cookies in accordance with the statutory provisions. Therefore, we obtain prior consent from users, except when it is not required by law. In particular, consent is not required if the storage and reading of information, including cookies, is strictly necessary in order to provide an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user. The revocable consent will be clearly communicated to the user and will contain the information on the respective cookie use.\n\nInformation on legal bases under data protection law: The legal basis under data protection law on which we process users' personal data with the use of cookies depends on whether we ask users for consent. If users consent, the legal basis for processing their data is their declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online services and improvement of its usability) or, if this is done in the context of the fulfillment of our contractual obligations, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations. For which purposes the cookies are processed by us, we do clarify in the course of this privacy policy or in the context of our consent and processing procedures.\n\nRetention period: With regard to the retention period, a distinction is drawn between the following types of cookies:\n\nTemporary cookies (also known as \"session cookies\"): Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online service and closed his or her end device (i.e. browser or mobile application).\n\nPermanent cookies: Permanent cookies remain stored even after the terminal device is closed. For example, the login status can be saved, or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. Likewise, user data collected with the help of cookies can be used for reach measurement. Unless we provide users with explicit information about the type and storage duration of cookies (e.g., as part of obtaining consent), users should assume that cookies are permanent and that the storage period can be up to two years.\n\nGeneral information on revocation and objection (opt-out): Users can revoke the consent they have given at any time and also file an objection to processing in accordance with the legal requirements in Art. 21 DSGVO (further information on objection is provided as part of this privacy policy). Users can also declare their objection by means of the settings of their browser, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (whereby this may also limit the functionality of our online services). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes, can also be declared via the websites https://optout.aboutads.info and https://www.youronlinechoices.com/. In addition, users can receive further objection notices from us at appropriate points as part of the information on the service providers and cookies used.\n\nCookie Settings/ Opt-Out:\n\nYou can change your cookie settings at any time.\n\nFurther information on processing methods, procedures and services used:\n\nProcessing Cookie Data on the Basis of Consent: We use a cookie management solution in which users' consent to the use of cookies, or the procedures and providers mentioned in the cookie management solution, can be obtained, managed and revoked by the users. The declaration of consent is stored so that it does not have to be retrieved again and the consent can be proven in accordance with the legal obligation. Storage can take place server-sided and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-out cookie or with the aid of comparable technologies) in order to be able to assign the consent to a user or and/or his/her device. Subject to individual details of the providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The duration of the storage of the consent can be up to two years. In this case, a pseudonymous user identifier is formed and stored with the date/time of consent, information on the scope of the consent (e.g. which categories of cookies and/or service providers) as well as the browser, system and used end device.\n\nconsentmanager: Cookie-Consent Manager; Service provider: Jaohawi AB, Håltegelvägen 1b, 72348 Västerås, Sweden; Website: https://www.consentmanager.net/; Privacy Policy: https://www.consentmanager.de/datenschutz/; Data Processing Agreement: https://www.consentmanager.net/tac.php; Further Information: The following data is stored on the service provider's servers in the EU: identification number, (for the user, his browser, operating system and terminal equipment used), IP address, date and time, country, language, type, scope and purpose of the consent, cookie settings of the browser, website on which the consent was given, technical information about the browser and operating system.\n\nOneTrust: Cookie-Consent Manager; Service provider: OneTrust Technology Limited, 82 St John St, Farringdon, London EC1M 4JN, UK; Website: https://www.onetrust.com/products/cookie-compliance/; Privacy Policy: https://www.onetrust.de/datenschutzerklaerung/.\n\nYou can change your cookie settings at any time.\n\nBusiness services\n\nWe process data of our contractual and business partners, e.g. customers and interested parties (collectively referred to as \"contractual partners\") within the context of contractual and comparable legal relationships as well as associated actions and communication with the contractual partners or pre-contractually, e.g. to answer inquiries.\n\nWe process this data in order to fulfill our contractual obligations. These include, in particular, the obligations to provide the agreed services, any update obligations and remedies in the event of warranty and other service disruptions.

If the registration of a customer account is required, contractual partnerswill be informed of this as well as of the details required for registration. The customer accounts are not public and cannot be indexed by search engines. In the course of registration and subsequent registration and use of the customer account, we store the IP addresses of the contractual partners along with the access times, in order to be able to prove the registration and prevent any misuse of the customer account.\n\nIf customers have terminated their customer account, their data will be deleted with regard to the customer account, subject to their retention is required for legal reasons.

If necessary for the execution of an order, we use service providers, in particular postal, freight and shipping companies, in order to carry out the delivery or execution to our customers. For the processing of payment transactions we use the services of banks and payment service providers. The required details are identified as such in the course of the ordering or comparable purchasing process and include the details required for delivery, or other way of making the product available and invoicing as well as contact information in order to be able to hold any consultation.\n\nConsulting\n\nWe process the data of our clients, clients as well as interested parties and other clients or contractual partners (uniformly referred to as \"clients\") in order to provide them with our consulting services. The data processed, the type, scope and purpose of the processing and the necessity of its processing are determined by the underlying contractual and client relationship.\n\nInsofar as it is necessary for the fulfilment of our contract, for the protection of vital interests or by law, or with the consent of the client, we disclose or transfer the client's data to third parties or agents, such as authorities, courts, subcontractors or in the field of IT, office or comparable services, taking into account the professional requirements.\n\nProject and Development Services\n\nWe process the data of our customers and clients (hereinafter uniformly referred to as \"customers\") in order to enable them to select, acquire or commission the selected services or works as well as associated activities and to pay for and make available such services or works or to perform such services or works.\n\nThe required information is indicated as such within the framework of the conclusion of the agreement, order or equivalent contract and includes the information required for the provision of services and invoicing as well as contact information in order to be able to hold any consultations.

In the event of a negative result of the credit assessment, we reserve the right to refuse payment on account or any other advance payment.\n\nIn accordance with Article 22 GDPR, the decision as to whether we will provide goods or services prior to payment is made solely on the basis of an automated decision in the individual case, which our software makes on the basis of the information provided by the credit agency.\n\nIf we obtain the express consent of contractual partners, the legal basis for the credit information and the transmission of the customer's data to the credit agencies is consent.

The above data may also be processed for SPAM detection purposes. Please note that e-mails on the Internet are generally not sent in encrypted form. As a rule, e-mails are encrypted during transport, but not on the servers from which they are sent and received (unless a so-called end-to-end encryption method is used). We can therefore accept no responsibility for the transmission path of e-mails between the sender and reception on our server.\n\nCollection of Access Data and Log Files: We, ourselves or our web hosting provider, collect data on the basis of each access to the server (so-called server log files). Server log files may include the address and name of the web pages and files accessed, the date and time of access, data volumes transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a general rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider. The server log files can be used for security purposes, e.g. to avoid overloading the servers (especially in the case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and to ensure the stability and optimal load balancing of the servers; Retention period: Log file information is stored for a maximum period of 30 days and then deleted or anonymized. Data, the further storage of which is necessary for evidence purposes, are excluded from deletion until the respective incident has been finally clarified.\n\nWordpress.com: Hostingplattform für Blogs / Websites; Service provider: Automattic Inc., 60 29th Street #343, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA; Website: https://wordpress.com; Privacy Policy: https://automattic.com/privacy/; Data Processing Agreement: concluded with provider: https://wordpress.com/support/data-processing-agreements/.\n\nHetzner: Services in the field of the provision of information technology infrastructure and related services (e.g. storage space and/or computing capacities); Service provider: Hetzner Online GmbH, Industriestr. 25, 91710 Gunzenhausen, Germany; Website: https://www.hetzner.com; Privacy Policy: https://www.hetzner.com/de/rechtliches/datenschutz; Data Processing Agreement: https://docs.hetzner.com/de/general/general-terms-and-conditions/data-privacy-faq/.\n\nMittwald: Services in the field of the provision of information technology infrastructure and related services (e.g. storage space and/or computing capacities); Service provider: Mittwald CM Service GmbH & Co.

Furthermore, we may contact users in compliance with the statutory provisions if communication is necessary for the purposes of administration or use of the application. In addition, we refer to the data protection information in this privacy policy with regard to the processing of user data.\n\nLegal basis: The processing of data necessary for the provision of the functionalities of the application serves to fulfil contractual obligations. This also applies if the provision of the functions requires user authorisation (e.g. release of device functions). If the processing of data is not necessary for the provision of the functionalities of the application, but serves the security of the application or our business interests (e.g. collection of data for the purpose of optimising the application or security purposes), it is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interests. If users are expressly requested to give their consent to the processing of their data, the data covered by the consent is processed on the basis of the consent.\n\nProcessed data types: Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); Meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses); Payment Data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history); Contract data (e.g. contract object, duration, customer category); Images and/ or video recordings (e.g. photographs or video recordings of a person); Audio recordings.\n\nData subjects: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).\n\nPurposes of Processing: Provision of contractual services and customer support.\n\nLegal Basis: Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR); Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR); Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).\n\nFurther information on processing methods, procedures and services used:\n\nCommercial use: We process the data of the users of our application, registered and any test users (hereinafter uniformly referred to as \"users\") in order to provide them with our contractual services and on the basis of legitimate interests to ensure the security of our application and to develop it further. The required details are identified as such within the scope of the conclusion of a contract for the use of the application, the conclusion of an order, an order or a comparable contract and may include the details required for the provision of services and any invoicing as well as contact information in order to be able to hold any consultations.\n\nStorage of an own unique identifier: In order to provide the application and ensure its functionality, we use a pseudonymous identifier. The identifier is a mathematical value (i.e. no clear data such as names are used) that is assigned to a device and/or the installation of the application installed on it. This identifier is generated during the installation of the application, remains stored between the start of the application and its updates and is deleted when users remove the application from the device.\n\nDevice authorizations for access to functions and data: The use of certain functions of our application may require access to the camera and the stored recordings of the users. By default, these authorizations must be granted by the user and can be revoked at any time in the settings of the respective devices. The exact procedure for controlling app permissions may depend on the user's device and software. Users can contact us if they require further explanation. We would like to point out that the refusal or revocation of the respective authorizations can affect the functionality of our application.\n\nAccessing the camera and stored recordings: In the course of using our application, image and/or video recordings (whereby audio recordings are also included) of the users (and of other persons captured by the recordings) are processed by accessing the camera functions or stored recordings. Access to the camera functions or stored recordings requires an authorization by the user that can be withdrawn at any time. The processing of the image and/or video recordings serves only to provide the respective functionality of our application, according to its description to the users or the typical and expectable functionality of the application.\n\nUse of the microphone functions: The use of certain functions of our application may require access to the camera and the stored recordings of the users. By default, these authorizations must be granted by the user and can be revoked at any time in the settings of the respective devices. The exact procedure for controlling app permissions may depend on the user's device and software. Users can contact us if they require further explanation. We would like to point out that the refusal or revocation of the respective authorizations can affect the functionality of our application.\n\nLocation history and movement profiles: The location data is only used selectively and is not processed to create a location history or a movement profile of the devices used or of their users.\n\nPurchase of applications via Appstores\n\nThe purchase of our apps is done via special online platforms operated by other service providers (so-called \"appstores\"). In this context, the data protection notices of the respective appstores apply in addition to our data protection notices. This applies in particular with regard to the methods used on the platforms for webanalytics and for interest-related marketing as well as possible costs.\n\nProcessed data types: Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); Payment Data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history); Contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers); Contract data (e.g. contract object, duration, customer category); Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times); Meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).\n\nData subjects: Customers.\n\nPurposes of Processing: Provision of contractual services and customer support.\n\nLegal Basis: Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR); Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).\n\nFurther information on processing methods, procedures and services used:\n\nApple App Store: App and software distribution platform; Service provider: Apple Inc., Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA 95014, USA; Website: https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/; Privacy Policy: https://www.apple.com/privacy/privacy-policy/.\n\nGoogle Play: App and software distribution platform; Service provider: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, parent company: Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; Website: https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en; Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy.\n\nMicrosoft Store: App and software distribution platform; Service provider: Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399 USA; Website: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store; Privacy Policy: https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement, Security information: https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/trustcenter.\n\nRegistration, Login and User Account\n\nUsers can create a user account. Within the scope of registration, the required mandatory information is communicated to the users and processed for the purposes of providing the user account on the basis of contractual fulfilment of obligations. The processed data includes in particular the login information (name, password and an e-mail address).\n\nWithin the scope of using our registration and login functions as well as the use of the user account, we store the IP address and the time of the respective user action. The storage is based on our legitimate interests, as well as the user's protection against misuse and other unauthorized use. This data will not be passed on to third parties unless it is necessary to pursue our claims or there is a legal obligation to do so.\n\nUsers may be informed by e-mail of information relevant to their user account, such as technical changes.\n\nProcessed data types: Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); Contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers); Content data (e.g. text input, photographs, videos); Meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).\n\nData subjects: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).\n\nPurposes of Processing: Provision of contractual services and customer support; Security measures; Managing and responding to inquiries.\n\nLegal Basis: Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR); Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).\n\nFurther information on processing methods, procedures and services used:\n\nRegistration with a real name: Due to the nature of our community, we ask users to use our services only with their real names. This means that the use of pseudonyms is not permitted.\n\nSetting the visibility of profiles: By setting preferences, users can determine the extent to which their profiles are visible or accessible to the public or only to certain groups of people.\n\nDeletion of data after termination: If users have terminated their user account, their data relating to the user account will be deleted, subject to any legal permission, obligation or consent of the users.\n\nNo obligation to retain data: It is the responsibility of the users to secure their data before the end of the contract in the event of termination. We are entitled to irretrievably delete all user data stored during the term of the contract.\n\nCommunity Functions\n\nThe community functions provided by us allow users to engage in conversations and other forms of interaction with each other. Please note that the use of the community functions is only permitted in compliance with the applicable legal situation, our terms and guidelines and the rights of other users and third parties.\n\nProcessed data types: Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times); Meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).\n\nData subjects: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).\n\nPurposes of Processing: Provision of contractual services and customer support; Security measures.\n\nLegal Basis: Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR); Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).\n\nFurther information on processing methods, procedures and services used:\n\nUser contributions are public: The posts and content created by users are publicly visible and accessible.\n\nSetting the visibility of posts: By using their settings, users can determine the extent to which the posts and content they create are visible or accessible to the public or only to certain persons or groups.\n\nRight to delete content and information: The deletion of posts, content or information provided by users is permissible to the extent necessary after proper consideration if there are concrete indications that they could represent a violation of legal regulations, our provisions or the rights of third parties.\n\nRestricted deletion of posts: Out of consideration for other users, the user's contributions to conversations remain stored even after termination and account deletion, so that conversations, comments, advice and similar communications do not lose their meaning or become inverted.This ensures that conversations, comments, advice or similar communication between and among users do not lose their meaning or become inverted. User names will be deleted or pseudonymised if they were not already pseudonyms.Users can request the complete deletion of their posts at any time.\n\nProtection of own data: Users decide for themselves what data they disclose about themselves within our online services. For example, when users provide personal information or participate in conversations. We ask users to protect their data and to publish personal data only with caution and only to the extent necessary. In particular, we ask users to note that they must protect their login credentials in particular and use secure passwords (preferably long and random combinations of characters).\n\nSingle Sign-on Authentication\n\nSingle Sign-On\" or \"Single Sign-On Authentication or Logon\" are procedures that allow users to log in to our online services using a user account with a provider of Single Sign-On services (e.g. a social network). The prerequisite for Single Sign-On Authentication is that users are registered with the respective Single Sign-On provider and enter the required access data in the online form provided for this purpose, or are already logged in with the Single Sign-On provider and confirm the Single Sign-On login via the button.\n\nAuthentication takes place directly with the respective single sign-on provider. Within the scope of such authentication, we receive a user ID with the information that the user is logged in with the respective single sign-on provider under this user ID and an ID that cannot be used for other purposes (so-called \"user handle\"). Whether we receive further data depends solely on the single sign-on procedure used, the data releases selected as part of authentication and also which data users have released in the privacy or other settings of the user account with the single sign-on provider. Depending on the single sign-on provider and the user's choice, there can be different data, usually the e-mail address and the user name. The password entered by the single sign-on provider as part of the single sign-on procedure is neither visible to us nor is it stored by us.\n\nUsers are requested to note that their data stored with us can be automatically compared with their user account with the single sign-on provider, but this is not always possible or actual. If, for example, the e-mail addresses of users change, users must change these manually in their user account with us.\n\nWe can use single sign-on authentication, provided that it has been agreed with users in the context of pre-fulfillment or fulfilment of the contract, in the context of consent processing and otherwise use it on the basis of our legitimate interests and the interests of users in an effective and secure authentication system.\n\nShould users decide to no longer want to use the link of their user account with the Single Sign-On provider for the Single Sign-On procedure, they must remove this link within their user account with the Single Sign-On provider. If users wish to delete their data from us, they must cancel their registration with us.\n\nProcessed data types: Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); Contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers); Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times).\n\nData subjects: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).\n\nPurposes of Processing: Provision of contractual services and customer support; Authentication processes.\n\nLegal Basis: Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR); Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR); Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).\n\nFurther information on processing methods, procedures and services used:\n\nMicrosoft Single-Sign-On: Authentication service;

Please use the contact options provided to you or use the contact options provided within our online services.\n\nIn the case of encryption of content (i.e. the content of your message and attachments), we point out that the communication content (i.e. the content of the message and attachments) is encrypted end-to-end. This means that the content of the messages is not visible, not even by the messenger service providers themselves. You should always use a current version of the messenger service with activated encryption, so that the encryption of the message contents is guaranteed.\n\nHowever, we would like to point out to our communication partners that although messenger service providers do not see the content, they can find out that and when communication partners communicate with us and process technical information on the communication partner's device used and, depending on the settings of their device, also location information (so-called metadata).\n\nInformation on Legal basis: If we ask communication partners for permission before communicating with them via messenger services, the legal basis of our processing of their data is their consent. Otherwise, if we do not request consent and you contact us, for example, voluntarily, we use messenger services in our dealings with our contractual partners and as part of the contract initiation process as a contractual measure and in the case of other interested parties and communication partners on the basis of our legitimate interests in fast and efficient communication and meeting the needs of our communication partners for communication via messenger services. We would also like to point out that we do not transmit the contact data provided to us to the messenger service providers for the first time without your consent.\n\nWithdrawal, objection and deletion: You can withdraw your consent or object to communication with us via messenger services at any time. In the case of communication via messenger services, we delete the messages in accordance with our general data retention policy (i.e. as described above after the end of contractual relationships, archiving requirements, etc.) and otherwise as soon as we can assume that we have answered any information provided by the communication partners, if no reference to a previous conversation is to be expected and there are no legal obligations to store the messages to prevent their deletion.\n\nReservation of reference to other means of communication: Finally, we would like to point out that we reserve the right, for reasons of your safety, not to answer inquiries about messenger services. This is the case if, for example, internal contractual matters require special secrecy or if an answer via the messenger services does not meet the formal requirements. In such cases we refer you to more appropriate communication channels.\n\nProcessed data types: Contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers); Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times); Meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses); Content data (e.g. text input, photographs, videos).\n\nData subjects: Communication partner (Recipients of e-mails, letters, etc.).\n\nPurposes of Processing: Contact requests and communication; Direct marketing (e.g. by e-mail or postal).\n\nLegal Basis: Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR); Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR).\n\nFurther information on processing methods, procedures and services used:\n\nInstagram: Messaging via the social network Instagram; Service provider: Instagram Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA; Website: https://www.instagram.com; Privacy Policy: https://instagram.com/about/legal/privacy.\n\nFacebook-Messenger: Facebook-Messenger with end-to-end encryption (the end-to-end Facebook Messenger encryption requires activation, unless enabled by default); Service provider: Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland; Website: https://www.facebook.com; Privacy Policy: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy; Data Processing Agreement: https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/dataprocessing; Standard Contractual Clauses (Safeguarding the level of data protection when processing data in third countries): https://www.facebook.com/legal/EU_data_transfer_addendum.\n\nMicrosoft Teams: Microsoft Teams - Messenger; Service provider: Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited, One Microsoft Place, South County Business Park, Leopardstown, Dublin 18, Ireland, parent company: Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399 USA; Website: https://products.office.com; Privacy Policy: https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-GB/privacystatement, Security information: https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/trust-center; Standard Contractual Clauses (Safeguarding the level of data protection when processing data in third countries): https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-Products-and-Services-Data-Protection-Addendum-DPA.\n\nSkype: Skype Messenger with end-to-end encryption - The end-to-end encryption of Skype requires its activation (unless it is enabled by default); Service provider: Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399 USA; Website: https://www.skype.com; Privacy Policy: https://privacy.microsoft.com/de-de/privacystatement, Security information: https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/trustcenter.\n\nWhatsApp: WhatsApp Messenger with end-to-end encryption; Service provider: WhatsApp Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Quay, Dublin 2, D02 KH28, Ireland; Website: https://www.whatsapp.com/; Privacy Policy: https://www.whatsapp.com/legal.\n\nVideo Conferences, Online Meetings, Webinars and Screen-Sharing\n\nWe use platforms and applications of other providers (hereinafter referred to as \"Conference Platforms\") for the purpose of conducting video and audio conferences, webinars and other types of video and audio meetings (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"Conference\"). When using the Conference Platforms and their services, we comply with the legal requirements.\n\nData processed by Conference Platforms: In the course of participation in a Conference, the Data of the participants listed below are processed. The scope of the processing depends, on the one hand, on which data is requested in the context of a specific Conference (e.g., provision of access data or clear names) and which optional information is provided by the participants. In addition to processing for the purpose of conducting the conference, participants' Data may also be processed by the Conference Platforms for security purposes or service optimization. The processed Date includes personal information (first name, last name), contact information (e-mail address, telephone number), access data (access codes or passwords), profile pictures, information on professional position/function, the IP address of the internet access, information on the participants' end devices, their operating system, the browser and its technical and linguistic settings, information on the content-related communication processes, i.e. entries in chats and audio and video data, as well as the use of other available functions (e.g. surveys). The content of communications is encrypted to the extent technically provided by the conference providers. If participants are registered as users with the Conference Platforms, then further data may be processed in accordance with the agreement with the respective Conference Provider.\n\nLogging and recording: If text entries, participation results (e.g. from surveys) as well as video or audio recordings are recorded, this will be transparently communicated to the participants in advance and they will be asked - if necessary - for their consent.\n\nData protection measures of the participants: Please refer to the data privacy information of the Conference Platforms for details on the processing of your data and select the optimum security and data privacy settings for you within the framework of the settings of the conference platforms. Furthermore, please ensure data and privacy protection in the background of your recording for the duration of a Conference (e.g., by notifying roommates, locking doors, and using the background masking function, if technically possible).

Please note, however, that e-mails on the Internet are generally not sent in encrypted form. As a rule, e-mails are encrypted during transport, but not on the servers from which they are sent and received. We can therefore accept no responsibility for the transmission path of the application between the sender and the reception on our server.

Applicants are welcome to contact us about how to submit their application or send it to us by regular mail.\n\nProcessing of special categories of data: To the extent that special categories of personal data (Article 9(1) GDPR, e.g., health data, such as disability status or ethnic origin) are requested from applicants during the application process, their processing is carried out so that the controller or the data subject can exercise rights arising from employment law and the law of social security and social protection, in the case of protection of vital interests of the applicants or other persons, or for purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the employee's work ability, for medical diagnosis, for the provision or treatment in the health or social sector, or for the management of systems and services in the health or social sector.\n\nEreasure of data: In the event of a successful application, the data provided by the applicants may be further processed by us for the purposes of the employment relationship.

Applicants' data will also be deleted if an application is withdrawn, to which applicants are entitled at any time. Subject to a justified revocation by the applicant, the deletion will take place at the latest after the expiry of a period of six months, so that we can answer any follow-up questions regarding the application and comply with our duty of proof under the regulations on equal treatment of applicants. Invoices for any reimbursement of travel expenses are archived in accordance with tax regulations.\n\nAdmission to a talent pool - Admission to a talent pool, if offered, is based on consent.

Insofar as the contents of the newsletter are specifically described within the framework of registration, they are decisive for the consent of the user. Otherwise, our newsletters contain information about our services and us.\n\nIn order to subscribe to our newsletters, it is generally sufficient to enter your e-mail address. We may, however, ask you to provide a name for the purpose of contacting you personally in the newsletter or to provide further information if this is required for the purposes of the newsletter.\n\nDouble opt-in procedure: The registration to our newsletter takes place in general in a so-called Double-Opt-In procedure. This means that you will receive an e-mail after registration asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can register with external e-mail addresses.\n\nThe registrations for the newsletter are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements. This includes storing the login and confirmation times as well as the IP address. Likewise the changes of your data stored with the dispatch service provider are logged.\n\nDeletion and restriction of processing: We may store the unsubscribed email addresses for up to three years based on our legitimate interests before deleting them to provide evidence of prior consent. The processing of these data is limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. An individual deletion request is possible at any time, provided that the former existence of a consent is confirmed at the same time. In the case of an obligation to permanently observe an objection, we reserve the right to store the e-mail address solely for this purpose in a blocklist.\n\nInformation on legal bases: The sending of the newsletter is based on the consent of the recipients or, if consent is not required, on the basis of our legitimate interests in direct marketing. Insofar as we engage a service provider for sending e-mails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in efficient and secure dispatch. The registration procedure is recorded on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of demonstrating that it has been conducted in accordance with the law.\n\nContents:\n\nInformation about us, our services, promotions and offers.\n\nProcessed data types: Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); Contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers); Meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses); Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times); Payment Data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history); Content data (e.g. text input, photographs, videos); Contract data (e.g. contract object, duration, customer category); Images and/ or video recordings (e.g. photographs or video recordings of a person).\n\nData subjects: Communication partner (Recipients of e-mails, letters, etc.); Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services); Business and contractual partners.\n\nPurposes of Processing: Direct marketing (e.g. by e-mail or postal); Web Analytics (e.g. access statistics, recognition of returning visitors); Conversion tracking (Measurement of the effectiveness of marketing activities); Profiles with user-related information (Creating user profiles); Provision of contractual services and customer support; Contact requests and communication; Security measures; Provision of our online services and usability.\n\nLegal Basis: Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR); Legitimate Interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR); Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR).\n\nOpt-Out: You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consent or object to further receipt. You will find a link to cancel the newsletter either at the end of each newsletter or you can otherwise use one of the contact options listed above, preferably e-mail.\n\nFurther information on processing methods, procedures and services used:\n\nMeasurement of opening rates and click rates: The newsletters contain a so-called \"web-beacon\", i.e. a pixel-sized file, which is retrieved from our server when the newsletter is opened or, if we use a mailing service provider, from its server. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval are first collected. This information is used for the technical improvement of our newsletter on the basis of technical data or target groups and their reading behaviour on the basis of their retrieval points (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or access times. This analysis also includes determining whether newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. This information is assigned to the individual newsletter recipients and stored in their profiles until the profiles are deleted. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users. The measurement of opening rates and click rates as well as the storage of the measurement results in the profiles of the users and their further processing are based on the consent of the users. A separate objection to the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case the entire newsletter subscription must be cancelled or objected to. In this case, the stored profile information will be deleted.\n\nPiwik PRO: Web Analytics; Service provider: Piwik PRO GmbH, Kurfürstendamm 21, 10719 Berlin, Germany; Legal Basis: Consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR); Website: https://piwik.pro; Privacy Policy: https://piwik.pro/privacy-policy; Data Processing Agreement: https://piwik.pro/core-dpa/.\n\nPardot: Marketing automation for contact acquisition, management, targeting, and conversion measurement purposes; Service provider: salesforce.com Germany GmbH, Erika-Mann-Str. 31, 80636 München, Germany; Website: https://www.salesforce.com; Privacy Policy: https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/; Data Processing Agreement: https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/legal/Agreements/data-processing-addendum.pdf; Standard Contractual Clauses (Safeguarding the level of data protection when processing data in third countries): https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/legal/Agreements/scc-amendment.pdf; Further Information: Data Protection Impact Assessments & Salesforce Services: https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/legal/Privacy/dpia-and-salesforce-services.pdf.\n\nSTREAMBOXY: Event management platform (livestreaming, conferences, online and hybrid events, registration, attendee management, interaction and communication tools, such as chats and polling, and third-party integration); Service provider: MAKONIS GmbH, Walter-Gropius-Str. 15, 80807 München, Germany; Website: https://en.streamboxy.com; Privacy Policy: https://en.streamboxy.com/privacy-platform; Data Processing Agreement: https://en.streamboxy.com/contracts.\n\nCommercial communication by E-Mail, Postal Mail, Fax or Telephone\n\nWe process personal data for the purposes of promotional communication, which may be carried out via various channels, such as e-mail, telephone, post or fax, in accordance with the legal requirements.\n\nThe recipients have the right to withdraw their consent at any time or to object to the advertising communication at any time.\n\nAfter withdrawal or objection, we may store the data required to prove consent for up to three years on the basis of our legitimate interests before we delete them.

The participants can object to this at any time.\n\nIf the competitions take place within an online platform or a social network (e.g. Facebook or Instagram, hereinafter referred to as \"online platform\"), the usage and data protection provisions of the respective online platforms also apply. In such cases, we would like to point out that we are responsible for the information provided by the participants as part of the competition and that we must be contacted with regard to the competitions.\n\nThe data of the participants will be deleted as soon as the competition has ended and the data is no longer required to inform the winners or because questions about the competition can be expected. In general, the data of the participants will be deleted at the latest 6 months after the end of the competition. Winners' data can be retained for a longer period of time, e.g. in order to answer questions about the prizes or to fulfil the prizes; in this case, the retention period depends on the type of prize and is up to three years for items or services, e.g. in order to be able to process warranty claims. Furthermore, the participants' data may be stored for longer, e.g. in the form of coverage of the competition in online and offline media.\n\nInsofar as data was collected for other purposes as part of the competition, its processing and storage period shall be governed by the privacy information for this use (e.g. in the case of registration for a newsletter as part of a competition).\n\nProcessed data types: Inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); Content data (e.g. text input, photographs, videos).\n\nData subjects: Participants in sweepstakes and competitions.\n\nPurposes of Processing: Conducting sweepstakes and contests.\n\nLegal Basis: Performance of a contract and prior requests (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR).\n\nSurveys and Questionnaires\n\nThe surveys and questionnaires (\"surveys\") carried out by us are evaluated anonymously.
