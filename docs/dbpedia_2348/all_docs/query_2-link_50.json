        "text": "Naturally occurring materials represent a high resource potential – if used more efficiently. Optimized handling of the materials, however, presupposes that we have knowledge of the materials, possible level of pollution, regulation in the area and knowledge of potential barriers and challenges in managing the materials.\n\nSeveral different kinds of materials are covered by the term “naturally occurring materials”. Excavation of these materials in building and construction can be done in different ways and using different kind of equipment, generating materials that are differing in quality and characteristics. Infrastructure projects in Norway and Sweden, where the geology is dominated by rocks require different approaches and equipment as compared to projects, where materials consist of a mix of soil, decomposed bedrock, clay, silt, sand, gravel etc. that can be excavated with an excavator. The quality of the materials that are generated by the different methods varies in terms of particle size, composition, and contamination levels. Consequently, it is important to be able to distinguish between them when collecting information about quantities as well as regulation, best practice, and challenges in the management of the materials.\n\nThe management of naturally occurring materials in the Nordic countries is regulated by a complex set of legislation which is based on, but not exclusive, environmental legislation, waste legislation, soil legislation, land use and building regulations. The management of materials requires either notification to authorities or permits. Although specific legislation on soil exists in all countries, there is no single, specific legislation for the management of rock masses from either drill and blast activities or TBM.\n\nIn all Nordic countries underlying sets of guidance documents and handbooks exist, however, to varying degree. Work is ongoing regarding development and update of guidelines etc. E.g. in Sweden guidelines, handbooks and other legal documents from agencies regarding handling of masses, by-products and waste are being updated, including the Swedish Building Act which is under revision. In Norway and Finland new legislation is on the way that has focus on the management of excess unpolluted materials generated in construction activities and the management of uncontaminated soils, respectively.\n\nDue to geographical differences between the Nordic countries, there are natural differences with respect to the types and amounts of materials, that need to be managed in the Nordic countries. The mapping of relevant materials showed, that excavated materials such as a mix of soil and other mineral masses is the most dominating fraction in Denmark and Finland, whereas rock masses from drilling and blasting activities as well as tunnel boring machines constitute significant quantities in Norway and Sweden. There are substantial differences in the amount of naturally occurring materials that are managed on an annual basis.\n\nBased on the gathered information it can be said that there is a potential for optimized management of naturally occurring materials in the Nordic countries. However, based on the available data and information it is not possible to give a quantitative estimate on how large this potential is. This is due to the fact that national waste statistics are a poor tool to provide a detailed overview of amounts of materials and their management in practice and do not reflect the different types of materials nor their respective geotechnical properties. Another reason is that materials, that are used on-site of excavation areas typically are not registered at all. Consequently, it is difficult to get a good overview of important material streams, how they are managed and how large the potential for optimized management is.\n\nThe classification of naturally occurring materials as waste or non-waste/resource is of great importance for the management of the materials. Classification as waste does not mean that the materials must not or cannot be utilized, they may still be recovered or recycled. However, classified as waste means that materials are subject to the waste legislation and the consequences that this entails for approvals, permits, compliance with relevant limit values, fees and taxes etc. This has a great influence in practice on the timeframe for decisions such as permits or approvals, which in turn has a strong impact on costs and consequently choices and possibilities for material management. This presupposes that the contractors have sufficient knowledge and expertise to be able to assess whether a material is waste or not in each situation to be able to apply for permits or whatever may be relevant.\n\nThe legal framework for management of soil contamination and remediation of contaminated sites varies across the Nordic countries. Different approaches to setting background or reference values, defining sampling and testing strategies as well as statistical treatment of results from sampling are used. However, the types of legal instruments applied, how the identification and registration of soil contamination is done, and which limit values are applied have a natural influence on how excavated soil and other naturally occurring materials are managed. This legal framework thus covers the assessment of masses prior to excavation, such as excavation of soil, decomposed bedrock, gravel, sand etc. However, there are distinctions between assessment of contaminated sites and assessment of excavated masses. Moreover, there are distinctions between on-site and off-site use of materials, especially contaminated soil.\n\nAssessment of sites is initiated through the legal instruments that are in place in the Nordic countries, such as national act on soil contamination. However, there may be differences in whether this is done as a systematic and continuous process on national or local basis or as a case-by-case and therefore site-specific risk assessment. This has influence on whether there is knowledge of possible contamination prior to excavation of soil or other naturally occurring materials. As described, there are also differences in the environmental quality standards or limit values used in risk assessment of soil pollution.\n\nWhich steps need to be taken by stakeholders when materials are to be excavated and used either on-site or off-site? There are different approaches for rock masses as compared to other excavated materials. Rock material in general is not considered a source or a sink for hazardous substances from pollution activities. Because of that, rock material without fine grained particles is usually not sampled and tested to determine content of pollution prior to excavation activities. This except for naturally occurring substances that might pose a risk of harmful effects when excavated or residues from explosives agents used in drill and blast excavation. Other excavated materials, such as soil, is typically sampled, tested, and evaluated against environmental quality standards. This can be standards defined in legislation in form of limit values but can also be in terms of threshold or guidance values as part of risk assessment. This varies in the Nordic countries.\n\nSeveral common regulatory as well as practical challenges must be solved to enable a more resource efficient management of naturally occurring materials.\n\nExisting legislation is not a direct barrier that prevents optimal utilization of resources. However, there are several untapped opportunities in regulation as well as problem areas that appear as barriers in practice. These problem areas are for instance, lack of specific requirements, complex set of rules, classification of waste, requirements for waste statistics.\n\nEfficient utilization of naturally occurring materials in the Nordic countries faces a wide range of challenges in practice and from different angles. It is the interplay of different factors that represents challenges or actual barriers for the efficient management of naturally occurring materials, e.g., for contractors. This includes aspects such as planning, preliminary investigations, lack of requirements in regulation and/or tender documents, lack of information and coordination, classification as waste/non-waste, management according to pollution level and costs.\n\nBased on the knowledge of barriers and challenges, recommendations for authorities and operators were formulated in the project. Recommendations for authorities focus on policy instruments and guidance that may be beneficial for the efficient management of naturally occurring materials, such as the need to develop new future applicable instruments, or the need to adapt existing policy instruments, respectively. Recommendations for operators focus on best practice identified in relevant studies at Nordic level and guidance for the relevant and suitable use of materials.\n\n4.1. National policy instruments\n\nBased on the information gathered and described in appendix 2, we can see, that the management of naturally occurring materials in the Nordic countries is regulated by a complex set of legislation which is based on, but not exclusive, environmental legislation, waste legislation, soil legislation, land use and building regulations. The management of materials requires either notification to authorities or permits. Although specific legislation on soil exists in all countries, there is no single, specific legislation for the management of rock masses from either drill and blast activities or TBM. We would like to ask the reader to take a closer look at Appendix 2 for information on specific laws or executive orders in the different countries.\n\nIn all Nordic countries underlying sets of guidance documents and handbooks exist, however, to varying degree. The classification of naturally occurring materials as waste or non-waste in accordance with the national waste legislation is of great importance for the management of materials. This is explained in further detail in section 4.4.\n\n​\n\nIn Denmark, where excavated soil is the most important naturally occurring material stream to be managed, specific regulations regarding the classification, excavation and removal of soil exist. They contain a system for notification to local authorities, classification system for excavated soil, including limit values to be used in this context as well as sampling and classification instructions. Furthermore, specific regulation for the use of soil in construction and infrastructure projects exists. Depending on the degree of pollution of excavated soil, which is determined by sampling and testing by total content analysis and leaching test, utilisation in restricted applications is possible with notification to local authorities. Utilisation in larger projects typically requires a permit from local authorities according to environmental legislation. In order to acquire a permit, site-specific risk-assessment is needed to determine the expected risks for soil and groundwater pollution at the site, where materials are to be received and managed. However, there is no specific legislation or guidance on how risk assessment is to be carried out. Also waste legislation and land use and planning legislation are relevant in the management of naturally occurring materials. There is no specific regulation for other types of naturally occurring materials, such as TBM masses or rock masses in Denmark.\n\nIn Sweden, there is no material specific legislation for the management of naturally occurring materials. All other types of naturally occurring materials are subject to environmental, waste (in case the materials are classified as waste), land and building legislation with underlying sets of regulations, handbooks, and guidelines. For the management of naturally occurring materials (excluding masses classified as “less than low risk” (Naturvårdsverket, 2010)), environmental permits and/or notifications are mandatory and those are based on risk assessment. Use and classification of the materials is evaluated based on risk for human health, the environment and natural resources in contact with the materials. Furthermore, land use classification with general or site-specific guideline values for contaminants in masses applies. National guidelines, e.g. to determine waste/by-product status, guidelines for management of materials, and guidelines for contaminated soils has been developed.\n\nMasses with classification as waste can also be re-used. If the masses/waste can be re-classified for land use off-site according to the guidelines for contaminated land. The levels for land use (sensitive and less sensitive land use) can be applied with approved notification to the local or regional authorities. Also waste treatment activities can be used to wash and separate the waste into new fractions of masses/soil as for reclassification of masses above.\n\nWork is ongoing regarding Swedish guidelines, handbooks and other legal documents from agencies regarding handling of masses, by-products and waste. The Swedish Building Act is also updated with a section at the time. Publication of the new documents is due later in 2021.\n\nThe management of naturally occurring materials in Norway is regulated by several sets of regulations across sectors - environmental legislation, waste legislation, planning and building, agriculture, and by several authorities at both national, regional, and local level. For the utilisation of surplus materials, a permit from the national authority is needed unless nationally defined criteria are fulfilled for the materials and the site of application itself. Disposal of materials is regulated according to the planning act in addition to environmental protection legislation. There is no special legislation for the different types of uncontaminated naturally occurring materials, except for acid forming shale. However, for contaminated sites and acid-forming shale, a classification system exists. Guidance on the management of naturally occurring materials and the defined criteria for exception from the application for utilization off site exists via the Norwegian EPA Guidance on the Pollution Control Act's requirements for intermediate storage and final disposal of soil and rock masses that are not contaminated (Miljødirektoratet, 2021a).\n\nThe Norwegian EPA is currently working on an Act to regulate the management of excess unpolluted materials generated in construction activities. As mentioned in Table 3, a cross-sectoral project will be implemented that looks at possible measures and instruments to achieve better management of non-contaminated surplus masses of soil and rock and a smoother process regarding permits to utilise the materials. The project involves 11 directorates and agencies that have been commissioned by their ministries to contribute to the project within their fields. A report is expected in September 2021.\n\nIn Finland, the management of naturally occurring materials is regulated via environmental legislation, waste legislation, land use and building as well as soil legislation. There is no specific legislation for the different types of naturally occurring materials, other than soil legislation. Management of naturally occurring materials, that are classified as waste and therefore may pose a risk of environmental pollution requires and environmental permit, e.g., soil landfill sites. Risk-based soil screening values are applied in assessment of soil contamination. Furthermore, e.g., guidelines for risk assessment, assessment of waste status and preliminary operations model for the management of stony materials exist.\n\nIn Finland, a revision of the Land Use and Building Act is currently underway. The goal is that the government proposal for a new Land Use and Building Act will be completed by the end of 2021 (Ministry of the Environment, 2021). It is planned that the temporary storage of uncontaminated soils could be handled by a building permit for temporary construction under the upcoming Land Use and Building Act, which will replace e.g. the current action permit used for temporary storage in certain cities. The idea is that such permit would allow the temporary storage of non-polluted masses as non-waste before their utilisation, even if the final use of the mass is not known yet. The current general interpretation is that the mass must then be regarded as waste, although in certain cities temporary storage without knowledge of the final use is possible with an action permit. Thus, the new soil regulation under the Environmental Protection Act, supplemented by the MASA Degree, would only apply to those masses whose use/disposal may pose a risk of environmental pollution, i.e. pollutants, wastes, or masses with acid generation potential above the threshold values (Reinikainen, 2021).\n\nBetween 2015–2018 Ministry of the Environment and Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE), prepared a proposal called “Government decree on utilization of soil waste in earthworks (MASA-asetus)”. The general objective of the proposed decree was to promote a safe utilisation of the soil generated in construction and similar activities that can be classified as waste, and waste suitable as a binding agent for stabilisation of soil. After being circulated for comment, the proposal received around 50 statements, in which notable revisions were proposed. Due to this as well as certain challenges recognized during the preparation process, it was considered necessary to consider other regulatory options to promote the utilisation of surplus landmasses. During 2020, a new alternative legislative solution was created that is based on supplementing the Environmental Protection Act (527/2014) with general provisions concerning surplus landmasses, including procedural provisions, as well as drafting of a Government Decree specifying them (“MASA 2.0”). The key aspects of the new regulation are the obligation to investigate soils that are being potentially harmful or cause danger of environmental pollution, and a notification procedure concerning their excavation, utilisation, stabilization, and intermediate storage. The Government’s proposal and decree are scheduled for the spring 2022 (Ministry of the Environment, 2020; Reinikainen, 2020).\n\nIn the following section barriers and challenges in the management of naturally occurring materials are listed. The information gathered is based on expert knowledge in this field and supplemented with information from relevant interview and studies. The information is presented for the Nordic countries.\n\nDenmark\n\nBased on our knowledge, relevant references as well as interviews carried out during the project, we have identified the following barriers and challenges to increase the utilization of natural occurring masses in Denmark:\n\nLack of requirements in tenders.\n\nLack of preliminary investigations, initial knowledge of quantities and grades make it difficult to make demands on nuanced handling of materials.\n\nManagement of materials in practice depends on procurement requirements and who completes the task – the right mindset.\n\nManagement of materials depends on waste versus non-waste status.\n\nThe management of materials depends on the level of pollution.\n\nMaterials, such as muck, that are not defined or described in detail in the legislation, in regulations, with EAK code, etc. are difficult to place in the regulatory framework. It complicates their handling.\n\nTransport distances are a challenge.\n\nPlanning/time/logistics is a challenge.\n\nIn practice management is controlled through the level of pollution and not through soil type. In addition, the possibility of handling the materials – if you have a concrete receiver for a material, especially unpolluted materials, you make more effort to sort/take it from.\n\nBarriers and challenges pointed out in interview with Metroselskabet I/S (Bech et al. 2021):\n\nIn general, the organization of waste management as it is today constituting a barrier to better utilization of waste. The organization has taken place on the basis of legal requirements, contract requirements, space and planning requirements and finances / incentives. The very varying amounts of waste in the various phases of construction can constitute a barrier to profitable recycling. Ensuring proper storage of waste so that it does not deteriorate also constitutes a barrier to recycling. Lack of information and awareness combined with language and culture among the employees of many different nationalities constitute a barrier to waste sorting. Pollution of the soil and documentation of cleanliness can constitute a barrier to recycling, especially internally in the project.\n\nThe content of flint and other impurities in the muck, as well as transport distances and other practical limitations, such as the take-off structure, constitute a barrier to recycling.\n\nSweden\n\nIdentified barriers and challenges to increase the utilization of natural occurring masses in Sweden are based on previous studies as well as the knowledge and expertise from the authors. The identified barriers and challenges identified are:\n\nSurplus masses are generally considered as waste\n\nGenerated surplus masses which are not used at the site of excavation, are today generally considered as waste. As a waste, receiving facilities must apply for environmental permits in the same way as conventional waste facilities such as landfills. This entails significant longer time for decisions, increased costs and more administration for companies handling these masses (Expertgruppen för Cirkulär anläggningsindustri, 2020).\n\nLimited storage opportunities\n\nIn large infrastructure projects, large amounts of masses are generated under a rather short period of time which can´t be used on the same construction site as being generated. In addition, it is difficult to find a demand for generated amounts within a reasonable time after they have been generated. This requires the opportunity to be able to store masses for a longer period of time, during which it is possible to find use for masses in other construction projects. Today there are limited opportunities in terms of space to locally store masses. From a legal point of view, there are today also limitations regarding time of storage where masses today are only allowed to be stored for maximum 3 years if they are intended to be used again. If intended to be disposed of through landfilling masses are allowed to be stored for a maximum of one year. The relatively short time frames for storing masses are identified as a barrier for a more circular handling of masses by Rosén et.al. (Rosén, L., Norrman, J., Söderqvist, T et.al, 2020).\n\nExemption from and deduction of the landfill tax\n\nThe landfill tax in Sweden today is more than 500 SEK/tonne of waste. However, landfills only receiving certain types of waste such as soils, gravel, rocks, rock debris etc. don´t need to pay any landfill tax according to legislation (1999: 673) on tax on waste. In addition, landfills can deduct the entire landfill tax when received waste such as soils and excavation masses are used for construction purposes on landfills. This makes landfilling as well as using waste for construction and coverage purposes on landfills rather cost effective and financially competitive compared to different treatment options for masses which hamper material recycling of masses. The consequence of this barrier can be seen in the national waste statistics where significant amounts of soils and excavation masses are managed by landfilling and construction purposes on landfills (Naturvårdsverket, 2020a).\n\nLow gate fees for using masses as construction materials on landfills\n\nAs mentioned, there is a great demand for masses using them for construction and coverage purposes on landfills. This demand in combination with being able to deduct the landfill tax according to the bullet point above has resulted in very low gate fees making alternative recycling techniques difficult to compete financially.\n\nLow and unclear requirements for pre-treatment before landfilling\n\nAccording to the Swedish waste legislation (2001:512), only waste which has been subject to prior treatment is allowed to be landfilled. However, today it is unclear what kind of treatment and to what extent is justified according to Rosén et.al. (Rosén, L., Norrman, J., Söderqvist, T et.al, 2020). The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency's recommendations (Naturvårdsverket, 2004) state that source sorting is sometimes seen as sufficient. This makes landfilling of non- treated masses generated at the construction site convenient and rather cost efficient compared to recovery options, which is reflected in the Swedish waste statistics (Naturvårdsverket, 2020a).\n\nSignificant transportation costs\n\nThe low value of secondary masses must cover the costs related to logistics to be financially viable which also is considered as a barrier for the sector.\n\nValorisation of rock masses\n\nValorisation of the material generated during infrastructural works is always a challenge. One such barrier is who is responsible for the valorisation, including material and, more so, the final product properties. Sampling of rock material for laboratory analyses can be made in several different ways and it significantly influences the evaluation of quality and properties of the final aggregate product. Sampling by drilling, which in some cases, is the only possibility will yield better laboratory test results on the critical mechanical properties compared to blasted or handpicked samples.\n\nWhen a road construction is planned, with or without a tunnel through some crystalline rock, the contractor calculates the value of the material to be blasted, excavated etc and take this into account. If the Swedish Transport Administration knows the value it can be included in their calculations and considered when evaluating the different tenders. However, how is it to be taken into account is open for discussion? The value of the material also depends on the skills of the contractors (or subcontractors) to turn the material into a usable aggregate. The quality of the final product is therefore depending on a lot of different variables very difficult to include in a procurement. Construction works in a larger city also means that the extracted masses most likely have to be transported to another place for processing and storing until use. In a country road construction, the masses can often be crushed and used directly as part of the construction. The better quality, the higher up in the construction. In a dense city there is mostly a problem with storage space and space for processing the material/masses.\n\nIn addition, the outcome during an actual tunnelling operation depends on the equipment/technique used. The most commonly used technique is to use explosives. The knowledge about the quality of these masses is much better compared to masses extracted by mechanical techniques such as with the Tunnel Bore Machine (TMB) where the resulting particles are extremely flaky compared to standard aggregates which is quite cubic/rounded.\n\nNorway\n\nPrevious studies and regional and local authorities have identified several barriers and challenges in the management of materials and enhance re-use and recycling. Some of the barriers are based on the experience of the stakeholders and interview partners. See references in chapter 2.\n\nThe main barrier appears to be the current organization and regulation of waste management in Norway, under the implementation of the EU Waste Framework Directive.\n\nExcess material from C&D activities, meaning material that is not sent to recovery or recycling, is defined as waste which in general requires application and permits from the authorities in order to utilize the materials (e.g. waste) outside legal waste plants or landfills. The national regulations and policies are presented in 9.3\n\nThe main barriers and challenges identified are as follows:\n\nUnclear legislation and several authorities across sectors. Risk of long case consideration by the authorities and/or rejection of applications for re-use unpolluted and/or polluted materials.\n\nLack of (legitimate and suitable) areas to temporarily store, handle, sort and/or process masses in proximity to where the masses are generated.\n\nRestrictions on the time period materials can be stored before a permit from the authorities is required.\n\nInsufficient information on the amount and quality of masses that will be generated in the region makes it difficult for authorities to identify the need for management and guidelines in their region or municipality.\n\nInsufficient preliminary studies and assessments of the ground in projects in order to assess the quality and amounts that can be re-used.\n\nSupply and demand need to coincide in reasonable space and time.\n\nLack of coordination between projects.\n\nLow demand for excess material from projects. In some areas of Norway, the price for new building materials is lower than cost to use excavated masses.\n\nLack of incentives and requirements of re-use/recycling of materials by developers.\n\nNaturally high background levels of some substances and/or types of masses (e.g. some types of shale) pose a health or environmental risk if deposited elsewhere.\n\nWhen re-cycling and/or processing gives a higher transport- and/or energy cost.\n\nQuality of masses must meet the technical standards for the application.\n\nDredging spoils must be de-watered (costly) before transport and application.\n\nQuality of dredging soils may not meet the technical standard of the application.\n\nIt should be noted that TBM masses (also rock) in general have a lower quality for re-use purposes, which historically has led to TBM masses being deposited in landfills in association with the infrastructure projects. TBM masses has also shown the need for processing before it may be used as additives in concrete structures.\n\nFinland\n\nThere are several barriers and challenges hindering the efficient management and utilization of surplus landmasses in Finland. Some of the main barriers and challenges are listed below:\n\nSurplus masses in Finland are typically mud, clay and silt, whose utilisation is difficult. In addition, the utilization of acid sulphate soils is demanding.\n\nNo comprehensive and uniform information available on the quantity and quality of the masses generated and needed on construction sites (Huhtinen et al. 2018).\n\nConstruction activities are increasingly located in areas whose soil types are either challenging to utilize or contaminants are present. The information obtained not until during the construction planning phase comes too late from the point of management of these masses. (Laine-Ylijoki et al. 2020)\n\nInformation important for the management of surplus masses, e.g. regarding to soil type, technical properties, and behaviour of material on its planned application, is not available, nor operations models do exist (Laine-Ylijoki et al. 2020).\n\nIf utilization of masses requires significant treatment, such as stabilization, life-cycle emissions may be significant and targets for resource efficiency are not met (Laine-Ylijoki et al. 2020).\n\nSupply and demand need to coincide in reasonable time, intermediate storage increases costs (Koivuniemi 2013).\n\nTransport costs and emissions generated. If transport distances are long, resource efficiency cannot be achieved. In addition, the lack of intermediate storage areas located in proximity to construction sites increase the distances of transport. (Huhtinen et al. 2018)\n\nSuboptimal use of surplus masses. Contractors may optimise the use of generated masses at construction sites only from the point of view of their own operations. Individual operators often do not have the possibility to use the excavated masses generated in their sites in a way that is optimal for the overall management. E.g., if large quantity of quarry material is produced and cannot be processed into crushed rock, it may be used in places where poorer quality masses could be used. As a result, poorer quality materials have to be landfilled in soil landfills due to lack of demand. (Huhtinen et al. 2018)\n\nLong lasting, resource-intensive and complicated permit and planning processes form a challenge for the utilisation and deposition of surplus landmasses. For example, a local detailed plan, environmental impact assessment, and several environmental etc. permits are required for disposal sites and treatment activities. Decision on a licence application may take several complaining rounds and the process for opening a new area may last around five years from the beginning of the permitting process. (Vaara 2011, Huhtinen et al. 2018)\n\nWhen assessing the waste status (i.e. is material considered as waste or not) of the excavated landmass, Section 5 in the Waste Act is applied. One of the criteria to be met is that the further use of masses needs to be secure, i.e. the material is directly delivered to the utilization site and it is not stored for long. This practice may limit the utilisation of excavated masses. For example, if it has not been possible to identify a secure further use for excavated material generated, it has been identified as waste. The existence of a market demand for the excavated material is not sufficient for a secure further use; the intended use must be known at the beginning of the storage of the excavated material. If the excavated material is classified as waste, an environmental permit is required for its intermediate storage. Permit process is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, usable material may have ended up in landfill instead of being utilised. (Huhtinen et al. 2018)\n\nRisk assessment regarding to contaminated landmasses is always case specific and concerns the risk at the place of excavation or formation, not at the utilisation site. Therefore, environmental risks concerning the utilization need to be always assessed separately. In other words, when soil is excavated, the criteria of the receiving site must always be met and demonstrated separately. If the soil is classified as contaminated, the criteria of the receiving site determine what needs to be separately investigated (i.e. what risks need to be assessed). Generally, the utilisation of excavated contaminated soils is currently minor even in landfills, as they are exempted from the landfill tax. (Laine-Ylijoki et al. 2020)\n\nA2.2 Swedish policy instruments and strategies\n\nA2.2.1 National legislation\n\nSwedish legislation having an impact on natural occurring masses and their handling are:\n\nThe Swedish Environmental Code (998:808)\n\nThe purpose of the Environmental Code is to promote sustainable development and is applicable to all who undertake activities or measures which could impact on the fulfilment of the Code´s objectives. The Swedish definition of waste contained in the Environmental Code is based on waste definition in the EU Waste Framework Directive (2008/98 / EC). According to chapter 15 and 1§, waste is defined as any substance or object which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard.\n\nRegarding natural occurring masses, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency assesses that excavated masses is not to be regarded as waste if the masses are excavated and used at that site where the excavation was carried out within a reasonable time (Naturvårdsverket, 2016). If it is not certain that the masses will be used or if the use cannot be foreseen other than in the long term, they are thus waste according to the definition of waste, according to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn the same section in the Environmental Code, the term by-product is defined as a “substance or object which has be generated in a production process where the main purpose is not to produce the substance or object if the following requirement are met:\n\nit is ensured that the substance or object will continue to be used;\n\nthe substance or object can be used directly without any processing other than that which is normal in industrial practice\n\nThe substance or object has been produced as an integral part of the production process and\n\nthe use referred to in 1. does not contravene any law or regulation and does not lead to generally negative consequences for the environment or human health.”\n\nAs for natural occurring masses the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency states that generated masses can´t be considered as by-products as they have not been generated in a manufacturing process according to 3) above (Naturvårdsverket, 2016). However there has been a court case in Sweden where the Environmental Court ruled that rock masses that would not be used within the project was classified as by-products. This if they needed to meet the criteria in chapter 15 and paragraph 1 of the Environmental Code (Nacka tingsrätt, 2014)\n\nThe Swedish Government has issued three ordinances based on the Environmental Code and chapter ten, contaminated land with:\n\nSFS 2007:667 Ordinance on serious environmental damage (Förordning om allvarliga miljöskador)\n\nSFS 2004:100 Ordinance on the remediation of pollution damage and state aid for such remediation (Förordning om avhjälpande av föroreningsskador och statligt stöd för sådant avhjälpande)\n\nSFS 1998:930 Regulation on environmental risk areas (Förordning om miljöriskområden)\n\nFrom these legal acts the SEPA has issued national guidelines, ordinances, methods and tools for inventory, identification, classification, risk assessment and remediation of contaminated land.\n\nIn chapter 11 of the Environmental code all activities regarding fresh- and marine water is regulated. This includes sediments and thereby dredging and building structures in contact with the water body. If the sediments is to be used outside of the water body, then legislation in chapter 10 applies. In general, concerning all types of masses to be handled, the waste ordinance is always mandatory if the level of hazardous substances can give the material classification as hazardous waste.\n\nThe waste ordinance (2020:614)\n\nThe Waste ordinance contains provisions on waste and waste management in Sweden. As for natural occurring masses, the ordinance is only applicable if the masses are considered as waste, see under the Environmental Code above. The waste categories are listed in Appendix 4 to the ordinance using the same nomenclature as the European list of waste.\n\nEnvironmental assessment ordinance (2013:251)\n\nIn the Environmental Code, there is a distinction between activities which require an environmental permit and activities for which a notification to the authorities is sufficient. The difference is based on the risk of an impact on health and the environment where activities requiring environmental permits are assessed as having a considerable impact on the environment.\n\nWhich activities require a permit and notification are defined in the Environmental assessment ordinance (20213:251). Chapter 29 of the ordinance concerns facilities that handle waste and the chapter defines which facilities are subject to an environmental permit respectively a notification requirement, depending on the type of treatment, size and type of waste received and associated waste amounts.\n\nRegarding masses classified as waste intended for construction purposes such as noise barriers etc, it is the health and environmental risks and not explicitly of the quantities which are handled which is decisive if an environmental permit is needed or if a notification is sufficient. If the risk of pollution is estimated to be less than low, no notification is required at all.\n\nIn the handbook “Recycling of waste for construction purposes” provided by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, there are indicators to distinguish between activities without notification obligation, notifiable activities, and activities subject to an environmental permit (Naturvårdsverket, 2010).\n\nRegarding natural occurring masses, chapter 4 of the ordinance, is also of relevance.\n\nWaste Tax Act 1999:673\n\nLandfilling facilities receiving waste are obligated according to the waste tax act 199:673 to pay a landfill tax which today amounts to about 500 SEK/ton of waste. As mentioned previously there are exemptions when the tax is not applicable. One such exemption is landfills which only receive naturally occurring masses such as soils, gravel, rocks, rock debris etc. In addition, when waste is used for construction purposes and similar at the landfill site, the operator of the landfill can deduct the entire landfill tax.\n\nTax on natural gravel (1995:1667)\n\nTo promote the use of secondary masses there is today a tax on natural gravel which today amounts to 17 SEK/tonne. Natural gravel refers to naturally sorted soils that predominantly consist of the fractions sand, gravel, and stones.\n\nThe Planning and Building Act (2010: 900)\n\nThe provisions of the Planning and Building Act on supervision and control at demolition measures are aimed at the appropriate disposal of hazardous waste and to provide conditions for recycling and recovery of demolition waste.\n\nA2.2.2 National guidelines\n\nTo guide and help authorities as well as actors to comply with the legislations a number of national guidelines have been developed related to natural occurring masses. They are listed below. In short for products and by-products legislation on products apply. For wastes relevant waste legislation applies.\n\nResidual flows classified as waste or by-products\n\nThis guide is intended as an aid in determining whether a residual product should be classified as a by-product or waste. Such a classification is decisive for the rules that apply to the handling of the residual product. For by-products, the waste legislation is not applicable why use and handling are regulated in product legislation such as REACH (Naturvårdsverket, 2021).\n\nHandling surplus masses in infrastructure project\n\nIn this guide from the Swedish environmental protection agency, guidelines are given how to classify surplus masses arising from the construction of roads and railways (Naturvårdsverket, 2016). Each project is considered specific and what´s valid in other projects does not apply automatically.\n\nRecycling of waste in construction projects- handbook\n\nThe handbook published by the SEPA aims at facilitating the recycling of waste including natural occurring masses in construction work in an environmentally and health-safe manner (Naturvårdsverket, 2010). As mentioned above, the handbook provides indicators to distinguish between activities without notification requirement, notifiable activities, and activities subject to an environmental permit. This guide will soon be replaced.\n\nGuidelines and assessment scenarios for contaminated land\n\nThe SEPA has developed a guideline and model for calculation of reference values for contaminated land (Naturvårdsverket, 2009). Calculations and reference values was updated in 2016.\n\nA2.2.3 Risk assessment\n\nDepending on planned and wanted use of materials, classification, origin etc. different approaches are used for risk assessment. The base of the risk assessments is, regardless, criterions and hazards for human health and the environment. The different approaches are described below.\n\nFor contaminated land and land use with levels of chemical substances above the baseline the SEPA has a series of publications called “Principles for assessment of environmental quality” which is used by the environmental authorities on regional and local level and when applicable for other authorities. Risk assessment guidelines for contaminated land and use of land is a part of the method for inventory of contaminated land (Naturvårdsverket, 1999; 2009).\n\nIn the methodology there´s two steps:\n\nphase 1 oriented desktop analysis and basic risk classification in class 1–4\n\nphase 2 overview survey with basic sampling, analysis, and evaluation with new risk classification as result\n\nIt´s not common practices to use the risk classification 1–4 in surveys other than that performed by authorities but the method for investigation and perform risk assessment is used by the environmental consultants, entrepreneurs etc. Risk classification has however been made for land used by different types of industries, with the latest update in 2020 (Naturvårdsverket 2020c). The purpose of this work was to identify all known contaminated land areas in Sweden and in the end of 2015 this task was ended. All data from the investigations can be found in a national database. Focus on the ongoing work is remediation of the areas with the highest risk classification.\n\nGeneral target values for contaminated land have been calculated by the SEPA with the latest update made in 2016.\n\nThere´s two basic scenarios in the general target value calculations:\n\nSensitive use of land (in Swedish känslig markanvändning, KM)\n\nLess sensitive use of land (in Swedish mindre känslig markanvändning, MKM)\n\nIn Table 29 the general target values can be seen for some chosen parameters for the two risk scenarios.\n\nThe parameters chosen in the general target values are considered commonly available in land use for human activities. Typical hazardous substances from dredged sediments, plant protection activities (pesticides in cultivated land), petrol stations, workshops, wood protection and other normal activities are included in the general target value calculations. Unlimited number of substances can be added in the model for calculation of specific scenarios. Data on each new substance must then be added in the model.\n\nIn this work, a project group performed the task with participation by the Swedish Geotechnical Institute (SGI) and Environmental Medicine Department on the Karolinska Institute and others.\n\nThe target value calculations are based on risks for human health, the environment, and natural assets such as ground water acquihires. The principle behind the model is safe use for human activities and the environment. This includes input data on hazardous substances, sources, transport mechanisms, risk for exposure and objects to protect.\n\nFor the scenario with Sensitive use of land, the boundaries are typically that for land where healthy adult humans can be every day, the entire time and for a lifetime, with an acceptable risk for damage to the health. This also includes typical normal land use such as growing crops for food production and having small children playing on the ground. For Less sensitive land use, the land use is typically of that for a work environment i. e. use of the land for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week during 40 years of working life. The Less sensitive land use scenario does not include growing crops for food but include examples with kindergartens, schools and recreation parks. When there´s data on different use of the land from that of the two different scenarios, the SEPA model can be used to calculate site specific target values.\n\nIn general, the method is used to give data for assessing if a land area or masses can be used as Sensitive use of land or Less sensitive use of land, in existing real estates or in planned projects (Naturvårdsverket, 1999).\n\nRisk assessment regarding materials within the waste definition that also can be used technically as soil or ground construction material is regulated through the handbook NV 2010:1 (Naturvårdsverket 2010). Due to complications in the interpretation of the guidelines there are also external support documents. The Swedish Waste Management and Recycling association (SWMRA) members are the municipalities and other organisations with interest in long term goal for improved waste management. The SWMRA has published a report on methods for risk assessment of masses regarding waste classification. The types of masses included in the methodology are soil and rock, dredging spoils as well as track ballast (see also Table 2).\n\nThe report includes procedures for sampling, examples on parameters to analyse, evaluation criteria regarding legislation on waste and on chemical substances (REACH and CLP) and a proposal for risk assessment has been made for the examples included.\n\nIn practice both classification of waste and risk assessment regarding the scenarios Sensitive use of land and Less sensitive use of land are made in planning and projects with masses. However, if the scenario Less sensitive use of land or lower levels of contamination is reached, then waste code hazardous waste is automatically not possible and waste code non-hazardous waste can be used. The Less sensitive use of land scenario is ten-fold or lower in contamination level than that for hazardous waste depending on type of material and substances included in the risk assessment.\n\nNatural unpolluted masses can be classified as waste depending on results from the risk assessment. In a recent case from the Swedish Environmental Court the ruling defined natural soil with high levels of sulphides as waste. The Swedish Transport Administration, the project owner, was also ruled by the court to apply for setting up a landfill on-site with surveillance and protection of the environment due to the risk assessment.\n\nOther naturally occurring chemical and physical parameters can affect the risk assessment of natural unpolluted masses. As for sulphides it´s primary the redox potential in the environment that give rise to acidic conditions and negative effects in the environments. Similar can be seen for other parameters, for example ammonium, chloride, fluoride, sodium, and calcium. In local areas in Sweden the natural levels of metals can be high enough for negative consequences for the environment. As an example, the levels of copper can be high in the region of Dalarna and thus limit the possible use of excavated soils due to the risk assessment.\n\nThe natural level of radioactive isotopes in rock and soil can affect the classification as waste or non-waste and the risk assessment for land use. As an example, demolition waste with light weight concrete with high levels of isotopes (uranium, thorium, and radium) giving radon gas in buildings is allowed in land use other than that were buildings are placed (the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority). The risk assessment made by the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority and the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning confirms that radon is an indoor health risk and not an environmental risk. The binder material can however cause leaching of salts and affect pH level in bodies of water why the use is restricted to urban areas such as parking lots and landscaping projects.\n\nFor dredged sediments and spoils risk assessment is made regarding volume, time of year, local restrictions, wanted use and planning. Re-use of dredged material in minor amounts within the local area can often be made with a simple notification to the local municipality and to the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management. Concerning larger volumes and with uncertainty in content of hazardous substances it´s mandatory with a survey for both overview and detail purpose. Notification and process in the Swedish Environmental Court is mandatory with local, regional and national authorities involved in the risk assessment process. Guidelines for marine sediments is not available in Sweden regarding classification of contamination level and risk as-assessment. In general, the Norwegian guidelines has been mandatory for use in risk assessment in the Environmental court. There is an ongoing project at the Swedish Geotechnical Institute to pub-lish Swedish national guidelines for risk assessment of marine sediments.\n\nThere´s also example in Sweden when contaminated sediments have been used as construction material post solidification and stabilization with a binder. Examples of this can be found in the port of Gävle, Oskarshamn and Gothenburg. In the case from the port of Gothenburg the risk assessment was made by sampling and testing for content and leaching behavior of contaminants, by crushing and by diffusion from a monolithic body, as well as geotechnical properties such as load bearing capacity, curing time, long term durability and risk for effects from climate change.\n\nA2.2.4 Sampling and sampling procedures of masses\n\nFor sampling, analysis and evaluation of results for masses to be used on land there´s several tools available in Sweden. The SEPA handbook “Methods for Investigation of contaminated land” (Naturvårdsverket, 1999) and The Swedish Geotechnical Society (SGS) handbook on sampling of contaminated land (Swedish Geotechnical Society, 2013) are well known. The SGS has certification procedures on sampling in general with additions for soil, ground water, surface water and sediments. The certification is made according to Nordtest standard NT Environ 008 which in Sweden is performed by Kiwa Sverige AB (fd Swedcert).\n\nThe certification as sampler is not mandatory for sampling of masses. It´s often a demand that the sampler has experience and knowledge in level with the demands in the certificate for soil sampling by NT Envir 008. According to demands in the EU legislation on competition it´s illegal for Swedish companies, authorities, and other organizations to set specific demands for sampling certificates unless it´s available throughout the EU. Thus, to avoid legal complications demands is set to ”…certified according to Nordtest NT Environ 008 or equally valued competence…”.\n\nThe SGS certified sampling method for soil is considered BAT in the “Clean Soil Network” (http://www.renaremark.se/) which include the majority of the consultants who perform sampling of masses. The methodology includes setting up a sampling plan with the local municipality as an important part in the planning step. The method includes standardized sampling and testing methods, certification of sampling personal, sampling strategies, how to perform sampling, handling, and storage of samples for laboratory analysis, sampling for in-situ analysis and sample preparation such as leaching and bioaccumulation. The quality assurance work includes documentation of sampling procedure and analysis results, collection of data and analysis of data, calculation and estimation of minor and major errors and evaluation of analysis and sampling data etc.\n\nThe sample origin, characteristics and planned use also determine what demands there are for sampling and analysis. Classification as waste require analysis in two steps. Step 1 determination of levels for each required parameter. Step 2 is performed if parameters have levels above reference value, and the testing of leaching from the sample matrix is made. Depending on sample matrix, parameter to analyze and the environment for use of the material, there are different standard methods. For inorganic substances, the sample is crushed or milled to a specific particle size (4 mm) and tested by shaking method EN 12457. Water is used as solvent and de|pend|ing on scenario of interest different ratio between liquid and solid is used. The L/S ratio of 2 and 10 is used for long time simulations of leaching from rainfall. The leachate is analyzed for the chosen parameters and the results evaluated against reference values. Test methods for percolation, surface diffusion, organic substances and more are also available.\n\nTo assess whether a waste can be used for construction purposes, the facility/organization planning to use the masses are responsible for collecting necessary information about the properties and content to make an assessment. This as part of the self-inspection in the Swedish environmental code.\n\nFor masses to be able to be handled in the right way and by the right recipient it is required that representative samples be taken and analyzed with respect to relevant parameters.\n\nThe only exception to sampling might be masses that are excavated from well known, virgin land outside urban areas (e.g. forest or arable land that is being prepared to plots of land). Since it is difficult to establish when sampling is needed it is recommended to always take samples (Magnusson G., (2018).\n\nIt is impossible to specify that a certain number of samples per unit volume should be taken for analysis. This since there are many factors that determine such as - the origin of the masses, types of pollution and what the masses are to be used for etc. Extent of the sampling may therefore take place in consultation between the operator and the authority (usually the municipality) for the intended place for the masses (Magnusson G., (2018).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency has developed general benchmark values for several commonly occurring contaminants in soil to compare the analyses against. The benchmark values can be used as a tool in the risk assessment to determine whether an area needs to be treated and is classified into:\n\nless sensitive land use can be used when assessing land areas to be used for, for example, industry and offices\n\nsensitive land use assessing land to be used for, for example, housing.\n\n, as mentioned above.\n\nIn addition, benchmark value less than low risk has been developed as well, under which not even a notification to the authority is needed, see under “Environmental assessment ordinance (2013:251) above. The benchmark values can be used as a tool in the risk assessment to evaluate if an area needs to be treated, but not used decide whether the masses can be utilized in other places. Acceptable levels of contaminants for masses at the site where they will be utilized must be assessed in each individual case. The same methodology is applied as for on-site utilization, see above in this subchapter.\n\nA2.4 Finnish policy instruments and strategies\n\nA2.4.1 National legislation\n\nThe national legislation concerning the utilization and disposal of surplus landmasses is listed below:\n\nWaste Act 646/2011 and Decree 179/2012\n\nLand Extraction Act 555/1981 and Decree 926/2005\n\nLand Use and Building Act 132/1999 and Decree 895/1999\n\nAct on Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure 252/2017\n\nEnvironmental Protection Act 527/2014 and Decree 713/2014\n\nWaste Tax Act 1126/2010\n\nGovernment Decree on the Assessment of Soil Contamination and Remediation Needs 214/2007 (“PIMA Decree”)\n\nGovernment Decree on Landfills 331/2013\n\nWaste Act 646/2011\n\nThe Act only applies to soils (i.e. rock or soil material excavated in connection with construction or similar activities) in case the soil is classified as waste. The management and use of non-waste material do not require an environmental permit either. Waste Act does not either apply to uncontaminated dredged mass that is managed based on a notification or a permit in accordance with the Water Act (Section 3), whereas the provisions of the Waste Act are applied to dredging masses disposed on the land. Nor does it apply to contaminated soil that is not excavated from bedrock or ground, as this waste type is excluded from the scope of the Waste Directive 98/2008/EY. (Ministry of the Environment 2015)\n\nWhen assessing whether excavated soil is regarded waste or non-waste, Section 5 in the Waste Act is applied. The basis of the Waste Act is that soil or other material of natural origin that is excavated as a result of construction or other similar activities and which is not contaminated, for which further use is certain, and that will be used directly or after sieving or other similar preparation for construction purposes on site or elsewhere, rarely meets the general characteristics of waste. If all of the following criteria are met, the soil excavated from construction site is not considered as waste (according to Section 5), but should meet all the requirements of the product legislation for the product in question, or other general technical requirements if product legislation does not exist:\n\nIf the concentration of contaminants in the soil do not cause environmental pollution or its danger\n\nIf the further use is certain (i.e. the soil is directly delivered to the utilisation site and it is not stored for long)\n\nIf the further use is systematic (i.e. there is a genuine need for the soil, and relevant planning, notification or permit procedures are carried out), and;\n\nIf the soil can be used directly without any further processing (excluding mechanical pre-treatment). (Ministry of the Environment 2015)\n\nThe treatment of soil materials defined as waste shall comply with the waste hierarchy (according to Section 8). An operator who treats waste on a professional basis must comply with this order as a binding obligation. Firstly, the amount and harmfulness of waste generated should be reduced. If waste is nonetheless generated, it should be prepared for reuse or secondarily recycled. If recycling is not possible, waste should be recovered for example as an energy, or if this is not possible, disposal shall be carried out.\n\nThe treatment of soil waste shall not pose hazard or harm to human health or the environment. The uncontaminated soils excavated from construction site should be primarily utilised in the same site (e.g. in environmental constructions such as noise barriers, road structures, embankments, fields and landscaping (Perhomaa 2019)) and secondary in other earthwork activities. As soil material that can be utilised safely and systematically is not usually considered as waste, these kinds of activities can be also seen to prevent waste generation. Utilisation of soil in landfill structures or its disposal to landfill may be approved in accordance with the requirements of the Government Decree on Landfills 331/2013. In general, the final disposal can be justified only if soil material cannot be utilised for example due to its harmful components. Uncontaminated surplus landmasses that cannot be utilised in earthworks (e.g. silt and clay) can be disposed in the soil landfill site in accordance with the environmental permit of the site. (Ministry of the Environment 2015)\n\nAccording to the Section 121, the waste holder shall draw up a shipping document on hazardous waste, contaminated soil and C&DW other than uncontaminated soil, that is shipped and delivered to a consignee as referred to in Section 29. In these cases, soil waste can generally be considered contaminated when its contamination level exceeds the lower reference value given in the Government Decree on the Assessment of Soil Contamination and Remediation Needs 214/2007 (“PIMA Decree”). (Ministry of the Environment 2015)\n\nThe revision of the Act is currently underway.\n\nLand Use and Building Act 132/1999\n\nThe use of land areas and building activities conducted on them is regulated in the Land Use and Building Act. According to the Section 128 of the Act, actions that alter the landscape, such as earthworks or tree-felling require permit for landscape work in areas covered by a local detailed plan; a local detailed plan for shore areas, if the plan so stipulates; a local master plan, if the plan so stipulates; and in building prohibition areas (Section 53). In the area of local detailed plan, soil extraction may take place under a permit for landscape work, if it is necessary to remove soil from an individual construction site as a preparatory measure for a construction project requiring a building permit (Ympäristö.fi 2020). A building permit is needed for construction of permanent buildings or other structures requiring supervision (Section 125). A permit for landscape work is not required to extraction of land resources that require a permit referred to in the Land Extraction Act (555/1981). Neither is a permit required to carry out work that is in accordance with a granted building or action permit, or when the impact of action is minor (Section 128). An action permit is required for organization of a rather large separated storage or parking area or similar area, and for arrangements or alterations having significant and long-term impacts on townscape or environmental scene (Section 126).\n\nThe mutual connection between land use planning and the utilisation of surplus landmasses is important, as land use planning has a decisive effect on the utilisation of surplus masses and enhancing their use. Via land use planning it is also possible to guide the material choices in construction and have an impact on resource efficiency, which can lead to reduced use of virgin materials and increase the use of recycled materials. (Sotejeff, 2019)\n\nThe deposition sites of surplus landmasses and their processing actions should promote the national land use guidelines and they need to be taken into account in the regional plan, local master plan, and local detailed plan (Koivuniemi, 2013). According to the Section 4 of the Land Use and Building Act, local master plans and local detailed plans must be drawn up in order to organize the land use and management in municipalities. In the local master plankomm the general principles of municipal land use are presented, whereas the purpose of the local detailed plan is to guide the use and building of land-areas within a municipality. The regional plans steer the municipal planning and consist of a general land use plan for the entire region or its specific sub-area for medium and long term. The major guidelines set in the regional planning cannot be deviated from in municipal planning (Koivuniemi, 2013).\n\nRegional plans cannot be used for solving acute problems, but it has a significant impact on regional planning processes (Vaara, 2011). Deposition of surplus landmasses is often a regional issue to be solved, as they concern several municipalities. In these cases, the land use questions solved in the regional plans are critically important. (Ministry of the Environment, 2001, cited by Koivuniemi, 2013). For example, in the new Helsinki-Uusimaa Land Use Plan 2050 prepared by Helsinki-Uusimaa Regional Council (2020) development areas for landmass management are separately pointed out. In a phase of more detailed planning excavation, treatment and storing of soils; deposition of unpolluted surplus landmasses; and activities related to circular economy can be situated in these areas. (Helsinki-Uusimaa Regional Council, 2020) The sites for treatment and disposal of surplus landmasses must adapt to the local master plan of the area. The area required for operation and the main use of the area after the operation has ceased are defined in the local master plan. The placement of the area must not hamper the implementation of the local master plan or the local detailed plan. Drawing up a local detailed plan is usually justified when planning the establishment of the soil reception area. This should be done at least in the cases when the area is in connection with another area subjected to local detailed plan, or when the after use of the area requires local detailed planning (Kautto & Lepola, 2005). It is a common practise to start looking for suitable sites for surplus landmass deposition and storing from areas that are not subjected to local detailed planning, an industrial area, or an area for recreational use (Koivuniemi, 2013).\n\nThe revision of the Act is currently underway, see Section 4.1. for more information.\n\nAct on Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure 252/2017\n\nThe Environmental Impact Assessment Procedure (EIA) is applied to projects that may have significant adverse environmental impacts (Section 3). Regarding to the projects related to treatment of surplus landmasses, EIA procedure should be applied to landfills for waste other than municipal waste or sludge that are designed for annual waste volume of at least 50 kt, and for physico-chemical waste treatment plants with a volume exceeding 100 t per day. The physico-chemical treatment of waste within the meaning of the EIA Act covers any physical or chemical treatment activity (Ministry of the Environment, 2015).\n\nEnvironmental Protection Act 527/2014\n\nEnvironmental Protection Act and Decree determine when an activity requires an environmental permit. The Act is applied to activities that may cause or cause environmental pollution or generate waste and to waste treatment (Section 2). Activities subject to permit include professional treatment of soil waste or its treatment at an installation (Section 27 and Appendix 1 (tables 1 & 2, part 13)). The Act does not set a lower limit for professional treatment nor treatment at an installation. Therefore, an activity that is professional or institutional by its nature or scale requires an environmental permit, whereas minor utilization of soil waste or other small-scale treatment activity does not require a permit. (Ministry of the Environment, 2015)\n\nTypical activities requiring environmental permit include:\n\nTreatment of contaminated soils (excl. treatment and utilization in the excavation area on the basis of the decision given in Section 136)\n\nA soil treatment site (i.e. a place that is used as a temporary storage and a (mechanical) sorting center for surplus soils)\n\nA soil landfill site\n\nUtilization of soil wastes in landfill structures or their disposal in landfill\n\nA long-term storage of soil prior to utilization or treatment; or\n\nPhysical, chemical or biological treatment of soils aiming to change the chemical properties or other waste properties of the material. (Ministry of the Environment 2015)\n\nIntermediate storage prior to utilisation may also be accepted in the environmental permit concerning the utilization of soil waste in case the storage is located in the same sphere of operations. If the storage is located elsewhere, a separate permit is required. (Ministry of the Environment 2015)\n\nIn addition, treatment of soils requires an environmental permit on the basis of the following criteria pursuant to Section 27, even though the soil materials in question would not be considered as waste:\n\nIf an activity may cause water pollution and the permit under the Water Act (587/2011) is not required\n\nIf conveying of wastewater may cause the pollution of a ditch, spring, or streamlet\n\nIf an activity may cause an unreasonable burden on the surroundings according to the Adjoining Properties Act (26/1920) (Section 17, subsection 1).\n\nOperational drawbacks may cause for example dust or noise, and discharge of seepage and storm water. Regarding to these, the need for permit must always be considered case by case depending on the nature and location of the activity. (Ministry of the Environment 2015)\n\nCrushing of rock requires an environmental permit if the crushing plant is fixed, or if the mobile plant is in a certain area and the crushing lasts for at least 50 days in total (Section 27 and Appendix 1 (table 2, part 7, subsection e)).\n\nAn environmental permit for the treatment of contaminated soil must consider the requirements concerning persistent organic pollutants (POPs) laid down in the Decree (EU 2019/1021).\n\nThe storage and crushing of unpolluted blasted or quarried rock from earth and road construction sites that is brought to rock treatment centres does not normally require an environmental permit, as the material in question is not classified as waste. The production of topsoil from unpolluted arable soil, excavated from construction site, in such way that the soil is only mechanically treated and utilised immediately or after a short storage period (usually less than one year), is not considered waste treatment and does not require an environmental permit. In cases where masses originated from construction activities are planned to be used in large amounts to change the height ratios of the arable land and to improve the growing conditions, the need for environmental permit must be decided case by case basis. (Ministry of the Environment, 2015)\n\nSee Section 4.1. for more information.\n\nWaste Tax Act 1126/2010\n\nWaste tax is levied on waste deposited at landfills. Sites where only materials originating from soil or bedrock are deposited or where waste is utilised are not subject to waste tax. Nor does it apply to an area where waste is stored separately from other wastes for less than three years prior to its treatment or utilisation. Similarly, the Act does not apply to hazardous wastes, nor wastes that are utilised in landfill structures. If soil waste is deposited to landfill requiring an environmental permit, the tax will be levied.\n\nThe Ministry of the Environment has recently published a report concerning the taxation of the waste disposed to landfill (Laine-Ylijoki et al., 2020). The results showed that in addition to the increase in the landfill tax, the tax base should be broadened to include more waste codes or all waste in the waste list. The taxation of soil wastes from construction and demolition (EWC category 17 05) was also assessed. It was estimated that the taxation would not generate specific negative environmental impacts regarding to management of these wastes, excluding a possible increase on the amount of waste diverted to soil landfill sites, especially as most of these wastes are currently disposed to landfill due to their exemption from taxation. Consequently, in the short-term tax liability could also increase a pressure on quasi-utilization at least in the landfills. On the other hand, the taxation would support the development regarding to the regional management of landmasses that has already begun.\n\nGovernment Decree on the Assessment of Soil Contamination and Remediation Needs 214/2007 (“PIMA Decree”)\n\nGovernment Decree 214/2007 guides the assessment of soil contamination and remediation needs. The threshold and guideline values for common harmful substances in soil are given in Appendix of the Decree. According to the Section 2, the soil contamination and remediation needs are based on an assessment of the hazard to health or the environment. The assessment is made on a risk basis, so it must be made if the concentration of harmful substances exceeds the values prescribed in the Appendix, or if the site is presumed to be polluted for example if it has been used as an industrial or storage area. Contamination is determined by sampling and they must be based on standardized methods (Halttunen, 2020).\n\nGovernment Decree on Landfills 331/2013\n\nThe deposition of soil waste to a landfill other than soil landfill is regulated in the Government Decree on Landfills 331/2013. In the Decree, general restrictions on the acceptance of waste at a landfill (Sections 13–15) and assessment procedure for acceptance at a landfill (Sections 16–23) are provided. According to the restrictions, waste can only be disposed accordingly to their classification if no exception mentioned (hazardous, non-hazardous, and inert waste). In addition, the Decree restricts the acceptance of non-hazardous waste containing biodegradable and other organic matter into landfills from 1 January 2016. However, this restriction does not apply to a contaminated soil or contaminated dredging waste deposited separately from other waste (Section 28). For waste containing Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP), the Government Decree refers to the POP regulation (Regulation (EU) No 2019/1021 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants) that sets a ban on landfilling of waste containing POP compounds above certain limit values. In order to determine the suitability of soil waste for landfill, it must be determined, among other things, whether the soil in question is classified as hazardous or non-hazardous. Some of the non-hazardous waste can be classified as inert, depending on its characteristics. (Ministry of the Environment 2015)\n\nA2.4.2 Risk assessment\n\nSpecific activities on a certain site, such as land use change or excavation or construction works, can trigger the need to investigate the contamination of land (Ministry of Environment, 2014). The Finnish authorities have developed and improved several policy and legislative instruments to promote sustainable contaminated land management practises (Reinikainen & Sorvari, 2016). The different policy instruments are shortly described in in this section.\n\nRelated to risk assessment, the decision-making and actions taken are guided by legislation. The most important ones are the Environmental Protection Act and the Decree on Assessment of Soil Contamination and Remediation Needs, i.e. so-called PIMA Decree. The Environmental Protection Act indicates the need for a site-specific risk assessment but is rather non-specific. The PIMA Decree was prepared to specify these generic provisions and it provides a framed procedure for performing site-specific risk assessments. Three categories of risk-based soil screening values for 52 substances are presented in the Decree. A risk assessment is mandatory if the concentration of one or more harmful substances exceeds the threshold value. It also defines uncontaminated soil, alongside the background concentration if it is higher than the threshold value. The guideline values mean that in industrial or storage areas etc., soil can be regarded as contaminated, if the concentration of one or several substances exceeds the upper guideline value, and in other areas soil can be regarded as contaminated if the concentration exceeds the lower guideline value. (Reinikainen & Sorvari, 2016). The guideline values, however, are not legally binding decision benchmarks, which means that the actual site-specific assessment is prioritized over the generic values (Reinikainen, 2021).\n\nBasically, the PIMA Decree describes the elements that have to be taken into account in the assessment but does not explain its actual implementation. Therefore, a guideline was published to promote justified risk-based decision making and to describe the different phases of the risk assessment procedure in practice (Figure 12). The methodology for risk assessment includes three basic steps: risk identification, risk determination, and risk characterization. The risk assessment should always be site-specific, and the level of implementation chosen based on the site in question, targets of the assessment, data and resources availability, intricacy of the issue, and the requirements of decision-makers (Reinikainen & Sorvari, 2016).\n\nThe threshold values given for non-polluted soils are rather low and often exceeded. Further guidance is needed on values to be used in risk assessments for small cases (i.e. not huge soil amounts to be managed in urban environments already polluted to some extent) with limited resources to conduct a detailed risk assessment. Information on suitability of field analysators for different pollutants is needed in the field (e.g. applicability, required detection limits, lessons learned).\n\nCurrently, more than 90% of the risk assessments and remediation targets made for the purpose of remediation of contaminated sites are based on the screening values of the PIMA Decree (YTF, 2016) despite the fact that the values are not legally binding cut-off criteria for site remediation (Reinikainen, 2021)."
