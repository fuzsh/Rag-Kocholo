        "text": "Introduction\n\nWhen you visit our website, information is collected about you, which is used to customize and improve our content and to increase the value of the advertisements displayed on the site. If you do not want information to be collected, you should delete your cookies (see instructions) and refrain from further use of the website. Below we have elaborated on which information is collected, its purpose and which third parties have access to it.\n\nCookies\n\nThe website uses “cookies”, which are text files that are stored on your computer, mobile phone etc. accordingly for the purpose of recognizing it, remembering settings, performing statistics and targeting ads. Cookies cannot contain harmful code such as virus.\n\nIt is possible to delete or block cookies. See instructions: http://minecookies.org/cookiehandtering\n\nIf you delete or block cookies, advertisements may become less relevant to you and appear more frequently. You may also risk that the website does not function optimally and that there is content that you cannot access.\n\nPersonal information\n\nIn general\n\nPersonal information is all kinds of information that can be attributed to you to one extent or another. When you use our website, we collect and process a number of such information. This happens e.g. by general access to content if you sign up for our newsletter, participate in competitions or surveys, register as a user or subscriber, otherwise use services or make purchases via the website.\n\nWe typically collect and process the following types of information: A unique ID and technical information about your computer, tablet or mobile phone, your IP number, geographic location, and which pages you click on (interests). To the extent that you give explicit consent to this and enter the information yourself, the following are also processed: Name, telephone number, e-mail, address and payment information. This will typically be in connection with creating a login or when making a purchase.\n\nSecurity\n\nWe process your personal data securely and confidentially in accordance with applicable legislation, including the Personal Data Regulation and the Data Protection Act.\n\nYour information will only be used for the purpose for which it was collected and will be deleted when this purpose has been fulfilled or is no longer relevant.\n\nWe have taken technical and organizational measures against your information being accidentally or illegally deleted, published, lost, degraded or coming to the knowledge of unauthorized persons, misused or otherwise processed in violation of the law.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe information is used to identify you as a user and show you the ads that are most likely to be relevant to you, to register your purchases and payments, and to be able to provide the services you have requested, such as e.g. to send a newsletter. In addition, we use the information to optimize our services and content.\n\nPeriod of storage\n\nThe information is kept for the period of time permitted by law and we delete it when it is no longer necessary. The period depends on the nature of the information and the background for storage. It is therefore not possible to specify a general time frame for when information is deleted.\n\nDisclosure of information\n\nData about your use of the website, which advertisements you receive and possibly clicks on, geographic location, gender and age segment, etc. disclosed to third parties to the extent that this information is known. You can see which third parties are involved in the section on “Cookies” above. The information is used for advertising targeting.\n\nWe also use a number of third parties to store and process data. These only process information on our behalf and may not use it for their own purposes.\n\nDissemination of personal data such as name and e-mail etc. will only happen if you consent to it. We only use data processors in the EU or in countries that can provide your information with sufficient protection.\n\nInsights and complaints\n\nYou have the right to be informed of which personal data we process about you in a common format (data portability). You can also object to the use of information at any time. You can also revoke your consent for information about you to be processed. If the information processed about you is incorrect, you have the right to have it corrected or deleted. Inquiries about this can be made to: info@circlecompany.dk. If you want to complain about our processing of your personal data, you also have the option of contacting the Danish Data Protection Authority.\n\nIf you no longer wish for us to process your personal data or for us to limit the processing of your personal data, you can also send us a request to this effect to the above-mentioned e-mail address.\n\nPublisher\n\nThe website is owned and published by:"
