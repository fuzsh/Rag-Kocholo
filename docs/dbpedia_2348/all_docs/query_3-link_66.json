        "meta_description": "The proportion of seniors in the Nordic population is increasing, along with rising average age and low birth rate. People of retirement age tend to have more free time and better finance than younger people, and are, in general, in better health than their peers used to be. These people have a lot of experience and knowledge that can be useful in the climate debate. With this in mind, Icelandic authorities initiated a special project on seniors and climate issues during Iceland’s chairmanship of the Nordic Council of Ministers 2023. This report contains the results of this project, incl. mapping of the existence and activities of climate-related groups of older people in the Nordics, a summary from a seminar held in Reykjavík in September 2023 and recommendations to the authorities in the Nordic countries about what they could do to support the work of seniors on climate issues.",

        "text": "In recent years, the proportion of seniors in the population of the Nordic countries has been increasing, along with rising average age and relatively low birth rate. People of retirement age tend to have more free time and are better off financially than younger people, and, in addition, older people are now generally in better health than their peers were a few decades ago. These people also have a lot of experience and knowledge that can undoubtedly be useful in the climate debate. The active participation of older people in activities of this kind serves to enrich their own lives and, at the same time, improve the living conditions of future generations. This experience and knowledge are resources that societies miss out on by not utilising.\n\nIceland holds the chairmanship of the Nordic Council of Ministers 2023, and on that occasion, the Ministry of the Environment, Energy, and Climate, in co-operation with the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour Market, initiated a Nordic project with the main goal of mapping and strengthening the work of older people in the Nordic countries in the field of climate issues. The idea was based on the knowledge that groups of seniors in Sweden had been active in this field and the belief that this activity could be further promoted by connecting more groups in all the Nordic countries, including Iceland. Environice consulting in Iceland was contracted to co-ordinate the project.\n\nThe project\n\nThe project in question is the first Nordic project in this field. The objectives can be summarised as follows:\n\nMap existing activities and networks in each country.\n\nOffer a Nordic platform for the exchange of ideas and inspiration.\n\nExplore how Nordic co-operation can be strengthened and maintained.\n\nGive recommendations to the Nordic governments on why and how they should support groups of older people who engage in climate issues.\n\nContribute to longer lasting physical and psychological health.\n\nThe project started in March 2023 and consisted of three phases or work packages. The first phase was the mapping phase, where climate related groups and activities of seniors in each of the Nordic countries were identified. A preliminary report with these findings was published as a working paper in the beginning of July. In short, it showed that groups of older people, focusing on climate issues, are already active in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. Many of these emphasise the role of grandparents towards their grandchildren, as reflected in the names of some of groups. One group in each country is active within the recent and growing network of European Grandparents for Climate.\n\nThe workshop\n\nThe second phase was a workshop on seniors and climate issues, held in Reykjavík 27–28 September 2023. All identified groups from phase 1 were invited to present their work during the workshop and to participate in panels and group discussions. The workshop was also open for everybody, free of charge. Most of the groups accepted the invitation and sent their representatives, either to participate in person or online. However, due to the location of the workshop, a few potential participants were unable to participate in person, as Iceland cannot easily be visited without travelling by flight with substantial GHG-emissions.\n\nIn total, the workshop attracted 41 participants, apart from those participating online. The president of Iceland, Mr. Guðni Th. Jóhannesson, honoured the event by giving a speech at the opening of the workshop. After that, the agenda consisted of several keynotes, panel discussions and group work. At the end of the workshop, participants were invited to a bus trip to the most geologically active Reykjanes peninsula.\n\nSeniors from Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, and The Faroe Islands attended the workshop, in addition to a keynote speaker from the Swiss group Klimaseniorinnen, who have taken their government to the European Court of Human Rights for failing to fulfil its positive obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, since the state is not doing everything in its power to prevent a global temperature rise of more than 1.5°C and thereby also failing to effectively protect elderly women in Switzerland.\n\nNotably, workshop participants from Iceland and The Faroe Islands, where no climate-related groups of older people have yet been established, showed a lot of interest in the work already taken place in the other four countries. After the seminar, informal meetings have been held to prepare a possible establishment of such groups in both countries.\n\nIt was clear from the workshop, that participation in climate-related activities has given an added meaning to the daily life of many elderly individuals, as it makes sense to them to fight for the world to be a better place for their grandchildren and for coming generations in general, not least when they can use their education for that purpose. The older people are inspired by the younger generations’ climate struggle. Several of the participants believed that it is important to be visible in protests, but also to work behind the scenes in collaboration with politicians to change laws and regulations. In the end, the participants agreed that there is a good basis for a Nordic network for older climate activists.\n\nThe findings\n\nThe third phase of the project included compiling a report with basic information, a summary from the seminar, and recommendations to the authorities in the Nordic countries about what they could do to support the work of seniors in the field of climate issues. That report is presented here.\n\nThe main messages from the project can be summarised as follows:"
