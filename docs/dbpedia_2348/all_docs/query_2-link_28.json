        "text": "The local effect of SILASTOL H 200 was investigated according to the method recommended in the OECD Guideline No. 405, \"Acute Eye Irritationl Corrosion\", Feb. 1987, and EEC Guideline 8.5 \"Acute Toxicity (Eye Irritation)\", Jan. 1997.\n\nThree female albino rabbits were exposed to 0.1 ml of the test article in one eye. The eyes were examined and the changes were graded according to a numerical scale one hour, 24, 48 and 72 hours as well as 7 days after dosing.\n\nVery well-defined signs of irritation were observed on the treated eyes. All effects were fully reversible within 7 days.\n\nBased on the respective mean conjunctivae scores of 2.67, 2 and 2 classification in category 2 is required according to CLP; EU GHS (Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008)."
