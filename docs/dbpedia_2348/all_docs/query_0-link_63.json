        "text": "EMPOWERING YOUTH VOICES!\n\nUpload your video and let your voice be heard. ‘What is your connection to Water?’ We bring youth together from across the globe and make your voices heard on the 7th of November. Be a part of something bigger – your contribution makes a difference.\n\nSHOW US YOUR CONNECTION TO WATER!\n\n1. Upload your project here and it will go through a validation process (roughly one to two weeks), and we will notify you when its accepted.\n\n2. After the validation process you will find your project on the map!\n\nThe ocean is essential to life on Earth. The ocean is a continuous body of salt water that is contained in an enormous basin on Earth’s surface. 97% of Earth’s water is ocean. The ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle and the water cycle by acting as a huge heat reservoir.\n\nWe can only survive 3 days without water! Drinking water or potable water is water that is safe for ingestion, either when drunk directly in liquid form or consumed indirectly through food preparation. Most people living in the EU enjoy very good access to high quality drinking water, thanks in part to over 30 years of EU policy on drinking water quality but on a global scale at least 1.7 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces.\n\nGroundwater is the water present beneath Earth’s surface in rock and soil pore spaces. It is stored in and moves slowly through geologic formations of soil, sand and rocks called aquifers. In some areas of the world people face serious water shortages because groundwater is used faster than it is naturally replenished. In other areas groundwater is polluted by human activities.\n\nWater is essential for all forms of life. It is a basic human need and access to clean water is a fundamental human right. 70% of our human body consists of water. Water is the main component of our blood and is used to remove waste, protect the brain and control temperature.\n\nAccess to safe and adequate water has been identified as an essential component for protecting, maintaining and promoting public health and reducing the total burden of diseases. Insufficient water intake or limited access to water can result in dehydration, which negatively impacts physical and cognitive abilities as well as bodily functions.\n\nPrecipitation is the joint definition for any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls from the clouds; rain, snow, hail etc. Precipitation is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing fresh water on the planet. Global warming is causing changes to weather, increasing percipitation in some gographies and reducing it in others, resulting in additional extreme weather."
