These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated contenton the Website. Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store more complex data than simple text. By themselves, they cannot do anything to, or with, the data on your computer. Like other cookies, they can only access personally identifiable information that you have provided on the Website, and cannot be accessed by other websites.

Vi kan bruge disse oplysninger til forskellige formål, herunder til at fastslå hvilke af vores e-mails der er mere interessante for dig samt til at undersøge, om brugere, der ikke åbner vores e-mails, fortsat ønsker at modtage dem. Denne pixel bliver slettet, når du sletter e-mailen. Hvis du ikke ønsker, at denne pixel downloades til din enhed, kan du vælge at modtage e-mails fra os i almindelig tekst i stedet for HTML-format. Nogle af siderne på websiden kan også indeholde web beacons og giver os mulighed for at tælle, hvor mange besøgende der har fået vist vores sider. Det gør det muligt for os at udarbejde statistiske oplysninger om, hvilke aktiviteter og funktioner der interesserer vores brugere mest med henblik på at tilbyde mere tilpasset indhold. Generelt anvendes de ikke til at tilgå personlige, identificerbare oplysninger uden dit samtykke.\n\nPixel tags kan deles med tredjeparter, som direkte understøtter vores salgsaktiviteter og udvikling af websiden. For f.eks. at måle effekten af vores annoncer kan tredjeparter, herunder Facebook, benytte cookies, web beacons og andre lagringsteknologier til at indsamle eller modtage oplysninger fra websiden og andre steder på internettet og benytte disse oplysninger til at levere tjenester til måling og målretning af annoncer på deres egne platforme. Du kan læse mere om, hvordan du fravælger indsamling og brug af oplysninger til målrettede annoncer fra tredjeparter her: http://www.aboutads.info/choices og http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.\n\nBrug af IP-adresser og web logs\n\nVi kan også bruge din IP-adresse og browsertype til at hjælpe os, hvis der er problemer med vores server, til at administrere websiden og forbedre den tjeneste, vi tilbyder dig. En IP-adresse er en numerisk kode, der identificerer din computer på internettet. Din IP-adresse kan også anvendes til at indsamle demografiske oplysninger.\n\nVi kan foretage IP-opslag for at finde ud af, hvilket domæne du kommer fra (f.eks. google.com) for at foretage en mere præcis måling af vores brugeres demografiske forhold.\n\nHTML email web beacons\n\nOur emails may contain a single, campaign-unique “web beacon pixel” to tell us whether our emails are opened and verify any clicks through to links within the email. We may use this information for purposes including determining which of our emails are more interesting to you and to query whether users who do not open our emails wish to continue receiving them. The pixel will be deleted when you delete the email. If you do not wish the pixel to be downloaded to your device, you should select to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML. Some of the pages on the Website may also contain web beacons and allow us to count visitors who have viewed our pages. They allow us to develop statistical information about the activities and features that most interest our consumers for the purpose of providing more personalised content. In general, they are not used to access personally identifiable information without your consent.\n\nPixel tags may be shared with third parties that directly support our promotional activities and website development. For example, in order to measure the effectiveness of our ads, third parties, including Facebook, may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from the Website and elsewhere on the internet, and use that information to provide measurement services to and target ads on their own platforms. You can find out how to opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting by third parties here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices and http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).\n\nUse of IP addresses and web logs\n\nWe may also use your IP address and browser type to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Website and to improve the service we offer to you. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on the internet. Your IP address might also be used to gather broad demographic information.\n\nWe may perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from (e.g. google.com) to more accurately gauge our users’ demographics."
