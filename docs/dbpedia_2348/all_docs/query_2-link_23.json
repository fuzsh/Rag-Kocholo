        "text": "What I especially appreciate in my job are the opportunities I have to develop the company, the employees and myself, to keep learning and developing and to bring people together and create success.\n\nWhat always fascinates me is the strength of teamwork in diverse teams and the creativity, versatility and results that these teams can achieve.\n\nMy career has until now: I joined what was then itelligence AG in 2006 as part of the team in the discrete manufacturing sector and as the only female employee. I worked as a consultant for many years, at the same time as my presales role as solution architect for logistics modules and became project and team leader. After a short time I also became responsible for planning various strategic initiatives and concepts which contribute to medium and long-term success for our company. Since 2013, I have held the role of SAP Partner Business Manager and since 2020, I have also been part of our Executive Board, responsible for the results of our Innovation & Portfolio Management strategic unit.\n\nIn my current role as a manager, what can I pass on to other women and what motivates me? Your individual management style is very important for whether you succeed as a leader, and you must find it yourself and continuously develop it. Women lead in a different way than men, and this is a good thing for the diversity of the company’s management. Don’t let yourself be bent, but be open to big changes. Be true to yourself and your personality, with all its strengths and weaknesses – after all, so do others. But it is important to know your strengths and weaknesses. Be open and don’t hide who you are. Fortunately, the days when female managers had to wear dark pantsuits and appear as masculine as possible to be perceived as competent are long gone.\n\nThe most important thing I have learned in my career: My new professional goal was already defined when I went on maternity leave: “One day I would like to be responsible for developing the portfolio of the German Business Unit.” Almost five years later, when the opportunity came for to apply internally for the position of Innovation & Portfolio Management, I was in a particularly challenging situation in my private life. I decided to act decisively, adjusted the framework of my personal, professional goal and applied for the position. I could contribute with my many years of expertise and experience , showed courage and willingness to continuously develop myself with the new challenges. In addition, I differentiated myself with a creative and innovative application. During the interview, I won the management’s trust and was able to successfully assert myself against the other candidates.\n\nMy advice to young women: Define your goals clearly, check occasionally if they need to be adjusted. Professional life is more like a marathon than a sprint. It is important to build networks and always maintain and use them. Here it is important to be visible. Exchange with other female colleagues and female managers, as well as coaching and mentoring, can give you great support as you build and develop your own professional journey and profile. Create and use your own network. And have the courage to speak your mind, even if it is sometimes not the same as the majority.\n\nA strong woman who inspires me: For me, there is not just one woman who inspires me. Many women who have not had it easy are successful and passionate about being role models for other women’s success: Sheryl Sandberg, Michelle Obama, Frida Kahlo, Tijen Onaran, Beyoncé Knowles.\n\nWhat I especially appreciate in my job is the opportunity to carry out tasks and projects with a high degree of creative freedom and self-determination, with confidence in the strength and skills of my colleagues and on an equal footing.\n\nWhat always fascinates me is the courage, commitment and passion shown by our talented junior staff when they take on and carry out tasks, activities and challenges with impressive flexibility and capacity for innovation.\n\nMy career has so far taken me from SAP implementation consulting, presales and project management, via AMS support and support center setup/management, over sales and sales management – ​​initially locally and now as part of the global sales process environment.\n\nIn my role as Head of Global Sales Excellence, I work with sales standards, processes and systems for our entire group, often as part of global projects and always in cooperation and coordination with colleagues from the entire NTT DATA Business Solutions family. It makes my work really exciting, and our work culture means that improvement, motivation and fun are always guaranteed.\n\nThe most important thing I’ve learned in my career? To be completely honest, I have learned most from the particularly challenging situations that have had elements of thematic or interpersonal challenges, including particularly critical situations that have demanded a lot from me, both as a colleague and as a person. In the end, it is precisely those situations that have matured me and given me direction, satisfaction, a lot of pride and yes – fun.\n\nMy advice to young women is to believe in yourself. Have confidence in your abilities and the possibilities you have. Weigh the different options against each other, but don’t hesitate to make a decision. Take responsibility and accept the risk of making a mistake now and then, because you learn from mistakes, you don’t fail. Be thoughtful, but not too self-critical. Be true to yourself and be completely yourself. Voice your opinion and fight for what you believe in – because “if you don’t say what you want, you won’t get what you want.”\n\nA strong woman who inspires me: There are many strong women who fascinate me and who have achieved great things with their intelligence, their courage and their passion, humanity or capacity for suffering – such as Marie Curie, Sophie Scholl, Mother Teresa, or Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Personally, I am inspired by people in my immediate environment, both personally and professionally.\n\nWhat I especially appreciate in my job at NTT DATA Business Solutions is that I can continuously set goals for myself and create new opportunities.​​\n\nWhat always fascinates me is how hard we work to make things better! Developing routines is fine, but continuing to test the routines is what makes them better. I make sure that improvement does not equal the pursuit of one-dimensional goals. Improving efficiency is good, but it must be accompanied by social aspects such as cohesion and sustainable efforts.\n\nIn my role as Diversity Lead at NTT DATA Business Solutions, I have the opportunity to start, support and especially shape strategically important topics. I am absolutely sure that people who feel valued and comfortable also feel motivated to perform better. As a company, it is our responsibility to create the framework for this.\n\nThe most important thing I have learned in my career was and is to achieve a healthy work-life balance. Time and energy are limited quantities. It is always a question of how much I can devote to each area. ​\n\nMy advice to young women in an industry where women are still underrepresented: Contribute your perspective and focus on your independence, your goals and your own responsibilities.​\n\nA strong woman who inspires me is Steffi Graf – both as an athlete, mother and philanthropist. Ambition and determination in sports, combined with a caring attitude towards others: these are qualities and values ​​that I myself try to live by.\n\nWhat I especially appreciate in my job is the sense of solidarity between colleagues and the team spirit that comes from it. When everyone helps each other, you can be sure that you are never alone with a problem or a challenge.\n\nWhat always fascinates me is how much you can achieve when you trust that things will work out and when you actively make an effort to achieve your goals. When you have a clear picture of the future you are working towards, anything is possible.\n\nMy career so far has been about sports, music teaching, scouting, animal welfare and especially mathematics – the queen of the sciences.\n\nIn my role as a consultant and team leader, I feel really good and I do everything I can to carry out my tasks as fairly and honestly as possible.\n\nThe most important thing I learned in my career was watching my parents growing up. Both were my role models in terms of work ethic, courage, healthy determination and especially enjoying work. The work was never too far, it was never too hard, and no task was too difficult or too boring for them.\n\nMy advice to young women: I would advise all women to look to the future with courage and not let anyone tell them that they cannot achieve their goals. At the same time, they should never stop changing and developing. The more objectively we look at the world, the sharper our senses and the wider our horizons. But you also have to keep an eye on your goals.\n\nA strong woman who inspires me is my mother. She taught me that I can be anything I want to be. I would also like to mention Ewa Chodakowska (Polish fitness trainer and businesswoman). Her mottos are “It won’t be done by itself” and “Your body can do more than your brain tells you”. Ewa actively involved in lots of campaigns to strengthen the role of women. Right now she is part of the “I don’t wait 107 years” campaign. Why 107? According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2020, women in Central and Eastern Europe will not have equal economic, legal and social status or equal rights until 2128. If we do nothing now, none of us will live long enough to experience it.\n\nWhat I especially appreciate in my job as Executive Assistant to the Board and the variety of tasks and topics in the various global local teams – I have the opportunity to actively shape the future of NTT DATA Business Solutions even at my young age.\n\nWhat always fascinates me is that my day never goes exactly as planned, so I’m never bored.\n\nMy career until now started when I studied Industrial Engineering for Mechanical Engineering with a focus on digital transformation. Then I worked as an IT technology consultant with a focus on IoT in a big 4 company before joining NTT DATA Business Solutions.\n\nIn my role, I have the opportunity to contribute to all topics that have to do with our board – from meetings with our shareholder and supervisory board to the design of various strategic and transformation topics and active implementation of internal projects.\n\nThe most important thing I have learned in my career was while I was studying for my master’s degree, when I traveled to Shanghai in China as a voluntary intern for a Management consultancy (innovation and digital transformation). From one moment to the next I was project manager – with full responsibility for a customer project involving a German head office and a Chinese production site. That experience made a big impression on me, not just culturally but especially professionally.\n\nMy advice to young women is to always keep an open mind and not take no for an answer.\n\nA strong woman who inspires me is my mother, who always put family first, and especially my sister and I. Even when it was sometimes really hard, she always found ways and means and fought her way through. I admire that a lot.\n\nWhat I especially appreciate in my job is the unity, the positive working environment and the way my development is encouraged every single day.\n\nWhat always fascinates me is the fact that at NTT DATA Business Solutions they really mean it when they say “if you need help, just ask”. Everyone really takes the time to help their colleagues.\n\nMy career until now started as a Quality Management Assistant. Then I worked in Sales for a car dealer in the USA before I started in my current position as a SAP consultant at itelligence AG, now NTT DATA Business Solutions.\n\nIn my role as SAP consultant, Project Management Officer and tutor for our junior program, I have learned an incredible amount my first year.\n\nThe most important thing I have learned in my career: I was very lucky with my previous positions because they opened a lot of doors for me – foreign travel, experience with international work and new tasks that were far from my education. There were negative things and disappointments along the way as well, but I wouldn’t have done without those experiences for anything in the world, because they are part of the journey to where I am now. They have made me more aware of some things and have helped me to understand what I really want. So in that way there is not one important thing I have learned, but a lot of smaller things.\n\nMy advice to young women is to keep an open mind! In my own circle of friends, I know people who would categorically write off any position if it is called anything related to IT. I would also advise young women not to give up if their first job is not perfect.\n\nA strong woman who inspires me: There are many I could name – but if I have to choose just one, it would have to be my little sister, who is currently taking her first state exam while still finding time to volunteer as legal advisor for young female entrepreneurs. I really admire her discipline and commitment."
