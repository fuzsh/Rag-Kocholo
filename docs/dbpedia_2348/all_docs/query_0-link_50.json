        "text": "O Lord, make haste and light up the night.\n\nAs the dying man longs, so I long for you, Lord.\n\nSay to my soul that nothing happens without Your permitting it,\n\nand that nothing You permit is without comfort.\n\nO Jesus, Son of God, You were silent in the presence of Your accusers,\n\nrestrain my tongue until I have thought things over\n\nand know what to say and how to say it.\n\nShow me the way and make me willing to wander it.\n\nIt is folly to hesitate, yet perilous to go forward.\n\nAnswer my prayer and show me the way.\n\nI come to you like the wounded seek out a doctor.\n\nO Lord, give Your peace to my heart. Amen.\n\nYou have loved us first, O God, alas! We speak of it in terms of history as if You have only loved us first but a single time, rather than that without ceasing You have loved us first many things and every day our whole life through. When we wake up in the morning and turn our soul toward You – You are the first – You have loved us first; if I rise at dawn and at the same second turn my soul toward You in prayer, You are there ahead of me, You have loved me first. When I withdraw from the distractions of the day and turn my soul toward You, You are the first and thus forever. And yet we always speak ungratefully as if You have loved us first only once. (...)\n\nAbove all, trust in the slow work of God.\n\nWe are quite naturally impatient in everything to reach the end without delay. We should like to skip the intermediate stages. We are impatient of being on the way to something unknown, something new. And yet it is the law of all progress that it is made by passing through some stages of instability— and that it may take a very long time.\n\nAnd so I think it is with you; your ideas mature gradually—let them grow, let them shape themselves, without undue haste. (...)\n\nAnd now, thus says Yahweh,\n\nHe who created you, Jacob,\n\nwho formed you, Israel;\n\nDo not be afraid, for I have redeemed you;\n\nI have called you by your name, you are mine.\n\nShould you pass through the waters, I shall be with you;\n\nor through rivers,\n\nthey will not swallow you up.\n\nShould you walk through fire,\n\nyou will not suffer,\n\nand the flame will not burn you.\n\nFor I am Yahweh your God,\n\nthe Holy One of Israel, your Saviour.\n\nSince I regard you as precious,\n\nsince you are honoured and I love you..."
