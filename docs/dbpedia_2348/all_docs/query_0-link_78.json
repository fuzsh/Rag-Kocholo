        "text": "Global Youth Climate Summit is now live!\n\nEach day at 10th, 11th and 12th of october you can join in on The Global Youth Summit 2023, 8:00 AM – 9:30 AM\n\nOnline summit with youth attendees from across the globe with the aim to strengthen dialogue and raise awareness about concrete climate initiatives\n\nThe Global Youth Climate Summit is an annual Youth summit targeted Youth. You can attend as a class or as an individual. Sign up below.\n\nThe conference is split over 3 days with 2×45 minutes each day. You can attend all 3 days or on the specific days which suit. We will ensure inspiring speakers, engagement with our attendees during the energizers and a perfect insight into the industry and the many climate projects and initiatives.\n\nWe encourage teachers to attend this summit as a great inspiration and link to their climate and sustainability curriculum.\n\nWatch the streams here!\n\nTogether we stand stronger – connecting youth across the globe\n\nAwareness is the first part of driving change. If we are not aware about what is going on around us, nothing will change. Climate change is such a complex thing and there is no easy recipe on how to act. No one knows exactly what needs to be done but we all know we need to do something. One thing we do know is that the youth generation will be growing up in a very different world than their parents and grandparents. They’ve been informed about this since they were litte but they haven’t seen much change. So how do we make climate change relevant to youth? How do we link science with action? And how do we inspire to get on board the innovative way of thinking in new solutions? Most of Youth will be working with climate in their future jobs but not many know exactly what this kind of work looks like? With this summit we want to get Youth closer to the actual climate actions happening across the globe at this very moment, all the incredible innovation and new ways of thinking.\n\nWe all have a voice and we need to make sure the solutions we are developing now fit the needs of the future generations – this is only done by working and by talking together.”\n\nThe Youth generation know they will be growing up in a changing environment than their parents and grandparents but the understanding of the exact actions taken is limited.\n\nThe situation is so complex and it can often scare people away rather than getting people together.\n\nYouth across the globe feel climate change in different ways but the tools we need to act are in many ways the same.\n\nHow can we get inspiration from across the globe and how can we initiate dialogue to drive hope and action?\n\nSarah Lund, Director of international collaborations and strategic sustainability initiatives\n\nTo the teacher\n\nAs a teacher we invite you to sign up for this summit. Our aim is to make the climate education more relevant by connecting concrete cases to the general climate data. As a teacher you have the opportunity to sign up for different add-on modules. See here…\n\nModules\n\nNational Climate Summit\n\nGet an insight into this years National Climate Summit by revisiting the amazing presentations. You will be able to grow your knowledge and learn about concrete action taken with inspiration from Denmark as well as globally. This year’s topic is water – a resource we often take for granted or talk about as a problem. But really, water is our most precious resource and our source to life. More than 60% of the human body consists of water and without water there would be no life.\n\nUpskilling of teachers in regards to climate change\n\n14th September, 08:50-11:30AM\n\nLemvig Gymnasium, VIA University College, Aarhus University and Klimatorium will give their view upon the best way to integrate concrete climate projects in the students climate education.\n\nSign up HERE. You will subsequently be sent a link to the team’s participation\n\nThe event is online, and everyone is welcome to participate for free.\n\n❌ PROGRAM ❌\n\nThursday 14 September at 08:50AM-11:30AM CEST\n\n• 08:50 – 09:00 Welcome by Lars Holmegaard, Klimatorium\n\n• 09:00 – 09:10 Introduction v/Bo Larsen, Lemvig Gymnasium.\n\n• 09:10 – 09:35 Presentation of the course, AU angle, v/Lise Lotte Sørensen\n\n• 09:35 – 10:20 Presentation of the course, High school angle, with teachers from Lemvig High School\n\n• 10:20 – 10:45 Presentation of the process, VIA angle, v/VIA\n\n• 10:45 – 11:10 Link to the private business community, v/Albert Jensen, Klimatorium\n\n• 11:10 – 11:25 Youth Climate Summit 2023 update, v/Sarah Lund, Klimatorium\n\n• 11:25 – 11:30 Thank you for today!

How do we get the courage to stand out and raise our voice?\n\nSign up for our 3-day program where we will dive into this exact topic.\n\nSPEAKERS\n\nKristoffer Sindby-Larsen\n\nHead of Climate adaptation development, OK Nygaard\n\nTheis Raaschou Andersen\n\nVIA University College\n\nInês Breda\n\nMember of Young Water Professionals\n\nPernille Weiland\n\nProject Manager in Klimatorium\n\nRyan D’Arcy Metcalfe\n\nCoordinator, Kimo Denmark\n\nHalfdan Sckerl\n\nCentral Denmark Region\n\nBjarne W. Strobel\n\nCopenhagen University\n\nYasmin Kidd\n\nA member of Generation Zero\n\nSarah Hammershøy\n\nCEO and Founder of MicroChange\n\nTuesday 10th of October\n\n*Water in Extreme*\n\nGlobal Youth Climate Summit\n\nWe are already feeling the changing climate. In the future we will experience more extremes – some times not enough water and at times way too much water. How do we live with this changing climate and reduce the risk for damage and casualties? Hear about some of the climate adaptation projects being rolled out at the moment.\n\n08:00-08:05 - Welcome by Klimatorium\n\nWelcome and ntroduction to ‘Water in Extremes, by Sarah Lund, Klimatorium\n\n08:05-08:25 - Creating spaces for water\n\nYou might not know it, but many areas are currently being developed to allow space for water. This is called Nature Based Solutions (NBS).\n\nNBS is about creating space for nature and people at the same time, but at the event of flooding the areas will act as reservoirs and in this way reduce the risk of flooding.\n\nKristoffer Sindby-Larsen, Head of Climate adaptation development at OK Nygaard will give an insight into some of the very amazing NBS projects around the world.\n\nENERGIZER\n\nHere, everyone must use a mobile phone – or team up with others to share. It is time to share your opinion\n\n08:30-08:50 - How can water drain through asphalt?\n\nWhat if water could drain through the surface of our roads and straight into the ground? This is what the Climate Road does. Instead of large amounts of run-off the rainwater is collected and controlled to prevent flooding and high pressure on our pipe network.\n\nThe magic climate road has even been developed so the rainwater is used to generate heating at the same time as well as cleaning the water.\n\nListen to Theis Raaschou Andersen from VIA University College who will talk about why we need to consider permeable surfaces on future Danish roads.\n\nENERGIZER\n\nHere, everyone must use a mobile phone – or team up with others to share. It is time to share your opinion\n\n08:55-09:15 - How can architecture help reducing risk of flooding?\n\nWith the changing climate comes a higher risk of flooding. Therefore, we must design our cities in a way where we protect our assets from damage and protect peoples lives. In Lemvig they have ‘Le Mur’. A hard coastal protection which keeps the water out and therefore prevent houses being flooded. This wall might not look like much but it is carefully thought through from the shape to the height. Building hard coastal protection can easily disconnect people from the sea but if done in the right way we can benefit from the solutions.\n\nHear from Mariane Vistisen from Lemvig Municipality who will tell about Le Mur, the thoughts behind and how it works.\n\nENERGIZER\n\nHere, everyone must use a mobile phone – or team up with others to share. It is time to share your opinion\n\n09:20-09:30 - Youth voice-Part 1\n\nClimate change can add a lot of feelings from climate fatigue to climate fear.\n\nThe youth WILL have to grow up in a different world to their parents and grandparents but how do we work towards this transition to create thriving communities where Youth has a voice? How do we change out habits and turn the fatique and fear into something positive? How can your voice and your actions impact a positive change?\n\nListen to Valdemar Cross and Noah Sass Sørensen, two ordinary guys out of high school who have been inspired to look for the positives in climate change.\n\nWednesday 11th of October\n\n*Protection from Contaminants*\n\nGlobal Youth Climate Summit\n\nThere are more than 350,000 different types of artificial chemicals in the global market, from plastics to pesticides to industrial chemicals. Traces from chemicals can be found in our water and the more we test for, the more we find. How do we navigate in this environment and how do we act to protect our valuable resource, water and our own health?\n\n08.00-08:05 - Welcome by Klimatorium\n\nWelcome and introduction to “Protection from contaminants”, by Sarah Lund, Klimatorium\n\n08.05-08:25 - Macroplast – a global problem\n\nWe are surrounded by plastic and a lot of the plast ends up in our oceans. Large pieces of macroplast causes harm to nature and our ecosystem. A new project is investigating how much plastic ends up at our water utilities and looks into how we can eliminate the amount of plastic out at sea. A lot of this has to do with our behaviour.\n\nRyan D’Arcy Metcalfe from KIMO Denmark will share his knowledge on this global problem.\n\nENERGIZER\n\nHere, everyone must use a mobile phone – or team up with others to share. It is time to share your opinion\n\n08.30-08:50 - Soil pollution\n\nOur behaviour leaves traces. Out of sight is not out of mind. Many places around the world polluting waste has been buried underground and is at risk of harming the environment. One of the largest contaminated mega-sites in Denmark is called ‘Høfde 42’ (Groyne 42). Back in 1950’s chemical waste from production of pesticides got dumped at the Danish Westcoast. More than 100 ton of chemicals remains in the beach sand, which today potentially poses a high risk for entering the sea. It takes technology and innovation to figure out how to clean up the contamination which also will be a huge cleanup-project measured in the total expenses.\n\nHalfdan Sckerl from the Central Denmark Region will give an insight into this large scale project and how we can learn from it.\n\nENERGIZER\n\nHere, everyone must use a mobile phone – or team up with others to share. It is time to share your opinion\n\n08.55-09:15 - Chemicals & drinking water\n\nDenmark is unique in the way that we rely 100% on our groundwater for drinking. However, it is concerning with all the different chemicals which are tested in our water. 400 different kinds of chemicals have been discovered across drinking water in Denmark. Some of the chemicals are organic and some man-made and some of them are considered high risk for our health.\n\nResearch is important to identify the risk but as long as legislation allows the industry will keep developing new chemicals and only worsen the problem. How can we as consumers be a part of the change towards more healthy water?\n\nBjarne W. Strobel from Copenhagen University will elaborate on this.\n\nENERGIZER\n\nHere, everyone must use a mobile phone – or team up with others to share. It is time to share your opinion\n\n09.20-09:30 - Youth voice-Part 2\n\nClimate change impacts differently across the globe. We all hear about it on the news but for some of us feel it in our daily lives.\n\nA member of Generation Zero a youth-led climate organisation striving for a climate-just today and tomorrow for Aotearoa New Zealand.\n\nYasmin Kidd from New Zealand will give her speech on how she feels climate change and her call for action.\n\nThursday 12th of October\n\n*Holistic Water Management*\n\nGlobal Youth Climate Summit\n\n60% of our bodies consist of water and water is essence for life. However, we have distanced ourselves from the importance of water. Today we treat our water in a closed loop with waste water and drinking water at the water utilities. In the future we need to ensure we’ve got the right amount of water at the right place and at the right time and this requires a more holistic approach. The future requires a more nature-based mindset and a more intelligent and data-driven infrastructure.\n\n08.30-08:50 - What is the link between water and energy?\n\nEnergy is a necessity for the life we are living but we undergoing a massive transition from black to green energy.\n\nWind, solar and hydro energy are the green sources but it needs to be transported and stored to ensure we’ve got enough energy at the right time.\n\nPower To X is big on the agenda for how to store energy but what is not spoken about is the huge amount of water which is required in this process.\n\nWhere will this water come from and do we use our water wisely and with respect for our natural resource?\n\nPernille Weiland from Klimatorium will give an insight into the complexity of water within Power to X.\n\nENERGIZER\n\nHere, everyone must use a mobile phone – or team up with others to share. It is time to share your opinion\n\n08.55-09:15 - MicroChange - make water great again\n\nMicroChange works phosphorus harvesting in problematic water streams, such as wastewater outlets and eutrophic lakes. The goal of the project is to ensure flexible container solutions, treatment processes with upcycled treatment materials and the utilization of recycling phosphorus.\n\nListen to Sarah Hammershøy from MicroChange\n\nENERGIZER\n\nHere, everyone must use a mobile phone – or team up with others to share. It is time to share your opinion\n\n09.20-09:30 - Youth voice-Part 3\n\nHow is it being young and entering the industry? Is the youth voice being heard or what can we do to improve the synergies between generations?\n\nListen to Inês Breda, a member of Young Water Professionals with an engineering background, Portuguese nationality, and host of the Finding Water Podcast.\n\nThank you and we will be back again\n\nin 2024"
