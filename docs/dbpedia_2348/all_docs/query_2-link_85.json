        "text": "Returning from summer holidays coincides with rounding 6 months at Carlsberg. Shifting into a new company and a new industry has been a whirlwind, to say the least. I think it’s important to highlight that even when career shifts are wanted and sought after, they are also HARD. Learning so much, so quickly, transferring knowledge and experience into a new context with new people, new governance models, and new ways of working. Phew! It’s a lot. Aside from starting to understand the ins and outs of the business, the past six months have been spent conducting our Double Materiality Assessment – mapping out how the company impacts the planet and how climate change is, in turn, impacting the business. I have also gotten to visit our Falkenberg brewery in Sweden, sat in on a brewing 101 master class with a Carlsberg brewmaster, met sustainability colleagues from Carlsberg markets all over the world, and gotten to know the fantastic teammates in Group Sustainability and Corporate Affairs. Now we are gearing up for the colossal task of CSRD reporting and all the new frontiers that entails. While this change has been overwhelming at times, it’s also been an exercise in constantly learning. As a reformed academic, it’s an amazing privilege to learn new things every single day. How crucial is regenerative agriculture to the future of our products? How do we collaborate with suppliers on net zero targets? How is our ESG agenda governed and operationalized on the ground in every market? What kind of business transformation is needed to achieve our long term goals? These are all questions I am learning more and more about each day in this role and it’s an honor to get to work on the answers as well. 🍻Cheers to even more learning in the next 6 months and beyond!🍻 #TTZAB #TowardsZero #CSRD #CarlsbergGroup\n\nOn Wednesday, I said 'hej då' to IKEA Denmark after four years of driving the sustainability agenda for the Danish market. I continue to be impressed by the company and its ambitions, and I am so proud of what we have achieved during my time there. I'm equally grateful for the fantastic colleagues I got to meet and work with along the way - of whom there are way too many to name in one post. I may have to stop quoting Ingvar now, but here's one last one for good measure, and it's a classic: Most things remain undone. This rings true for all of us working in sustainability, and I can't wait to see how IKEA continues to evolve and challenge itself in this space moving forward💙💛 As for me, I am very lucky to have moved over to another iconic Scandinavian brand, one that is also leading the sustainability charge in its industry. Today was day one of a new adventure at Carlsberg Group, where I have joined the global sustainability and ESG team. There is a strong foundation and high ambition, and I am so excited to dig into the work. Beer and sustainability - will it be the best job in the world? Probably💚\n\nThe annual #IKEA #LifeatHome Report is out today! Based on a tremendous amount of data, insights and home visits, Katie McCrory and her team have come out with yet another sharp and thoughtful take on how we understand our lives at home, and what makes the home such an important place in our lives. Reading it with sustainability goggles on, this report highlights some of the same challenges we see elsewhere - namely that many people think it is too expensive to live sustainably. What I really appreciate is that this year we have outlined some simple \"back to basics\" actions that anyone can incorporate into their lives to make a small step in the green direction without breaking the bank: 🌳 Get outdoors 👩🍳 Cook at home with seasonal and local food 🍽️ Reduce food waste 🥬 Eat vegan or vegetarian for some of all meals 🛒 Buy second-hand (when you need to buy at all) 🎒 Avoid plastic 🧑🤝🧑 Socialize at home instead of going out And why is individual action so important, when it is companies and governments that hold the most influence over our behavior, what we buy, what we can afford, how we use things, and so on? Because individual action sparks engagement, and the more engaged we are, the more we can hold those companies and governments accountable for leading us toward a more sustainable future 💚 Happy reading!\n\nBanger of a start to 2024! This morning I visited DR to talk with Lars Trier Mogensen about IKEA's circular transformation on the podcast Guld og Grønne Skov. Give a listen here (in Danish) 🎧 https://lnkd.in/drdnnYkw 🎧 It's always nerve-wracking to give interviews in Danish, particularly live on a show I admire. But I try to rest easy in the fact that that we are discussing a subject I am so passionate about; a conundrum that all of society is grappling with. How can a large, global volume-driven retail really become a circular business? I can't help but turn the question around and ask how society could realistically undergo a circular transformation if major retailers and consumer brands are not part of the solution? We are certainly not perfect, and we need to move faster than ever, but I am starting the year off inspired by the potential to make a bang in 2024 💥\n\nWith #BlackFriday looming tomorrow, this week has fittingly been all about questioning overconsumption and trying to find solutions for more #circular ways of making, buying, having, and getting rid of things 🖤 If we are going to become a circular business by 2030 (which is the goal!) then we need innovation both in our design process as well as in our business model. And we need to be open and honest about where we are and where we want to be. So on Wednesday, Sebastian nissen and I welcomed Kristian Bjerregaard, Vestforbrænding and a group of waste specialists from municipalities around Copenhagen to breakfast at IKEA Gentofte where we shared learnings and insights from our #secondhand hand pilot project. We know that today too many IKEA products end up at the recycling and waste station, and this project was designed to test out how many of those pieces we could immediately and directly feed back into our stores - good for sales, good for the planet. There were ups and downs and we learned a lot - like how to manage the daily operations of such a project, where the optimal locations are, and how to communicate effectively to residents at the station. Phase 1 is closing down, but we look forward to a great continued cooperation in the new year. Then today kicked off at IKEA Copenhagen with a panel debate on how we as a society - consumers, companies, politicians - need to approach the topic of consumption in a resource-scarce future. What responsibility do we all have to contribute to this transition? There is no simple answer, but a few things are clear to me. We need more circular products. They need to be made with continuously more sustainable materials, and designed for disassembly and repair. We are off to a good start with 56% of materials renewable and 17% recycled today. We also offer an ever-growing range of spare parts for customers, and an extended guarantee period on many items. But lots more can and will be done. And we also need new business models at scale - new ways to create business value by reusing and recirculating existing resources. New political frames that hold us all accountable and catalyze these opportunities. New partnerships that spark ideas and solutions. Lots of new - but maybe not all new 😉 #circulareconomy #peopleandplanet #ikea #quality\n\n☀ Bright blue skies over IKEA Copenhagen yesterday, for a meeting with colleagues from across the Nordic IKEA world ❤️💙💛 IKEA has a goal of producing zero non-recycled waste in our operations by 2030, and we need to cooperate and learn from each other if we are going to reach that milestone. Accommodating more sorting fractions, better training and communication to coworkers, and managing roles and responsibilities among different teams are all fundamental for success. But we will need even more than that to truly be a zero waste company. How do we team up with innovative recycling and reuse companies, how can we send more materials directly back into our own production streams, and – ultimately – how can we generate less would-be waste to begin with and use our products and packaging as material banks? Great discussions and opportunities for the future. As we always say in IKEA, most things remain undone ⏳ #peopleandplanet #recycling #zerowaste #reuse #ikea\n\n\"Less bad is not good enough anymore\" This week I had the pleasure of listening to Paul Polman in conversation with Mette Morsing about how businesses need to reassess their whole approach to sustainability. Are we just trying to lessen our impact? Or are we actually leaving the planet better off than we found it? Are we optimizing our way to meet a few green KPIs, or are we redesigning the system we operate within to genuinely contribute more than we take? I am proud to be in a company that is asking itself these difficult questions, even if we haven't found all the answers yet. This evening was a reminder that we cannot get comfortable or rest on our laurels - there is too much at stake 💪"
