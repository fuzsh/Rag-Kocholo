The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture will be visible to the public along with your comment.\n\nMedia\n\nIf you upload images to the site, you should refrain from uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Website visitors can download and extract all location data from images on the website.\n\nContact forms\n\nCookies\n\nIf you write a comment on our website, you can choose to save your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so you don’t have to fill in your information again when you post another comment. These cookies will last for one year.\n\nIf you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie does not contain any personal data and is removed when you close the browser.\n\nWhen you log in, we will set up a number of cookies and save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen selection cookies last for one year. If you select “Remember me”, your login will last for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will disappear.\n\nIf you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be stored in your browser. This cookie does not contain any personal data and simply provides the post ID of the article you have just edited. It expires after 1 day.\n\nEmbedded content from other websites\n\nArticles on this site may contain embedded content (eg videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves exactly as if the visitor had visited the other website.\n\nThese sites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with this embedded content, including tracking your interaction with embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that site.\n\nAnalytics\n\nWho we share your data with\n\nHow long we store your data\n\nIf you write a comment, the comment and its metadata will be retained indefinitely.
