        "text": "Reconnect to Regenerate! \"We can never obtain peace in the outer world, until we make peace with ourselves\" - Dalai Lama is quoted to have said. In other words, we cannot fix the outside world if we do not do the inner work first. We cannot fully contribute to a regenerative, flourishing, life generating, world either, until we become regenerative people. But in order for that to happen, we must take the inner world more seriously. So many leaders, thought leaders and businesses are deeply acknowledging the need for radical change but the focus on fixing the 'outside world' instead of taking the genuine step of giving high attention to the 'inner world' is still prevalent. With the inspiration from the consultancy firm Promentum and among others, Kim Gørtz and Tim Struck, I have the past year been led to coming closer to an understanding of the deep wisdom of the regenerative paradigm. In the moving and in many ways hope inducing book \"Regenerative Leadership\" by Giles Hutchins & Laura Storm the authors so eloquently suggest that the roots to our current state lies in what they name the \"The journey of separation\" between - human & nature - feminine & masculine - inner & outer - right & left brain hemisphere and consequently they convincingly propose that the key to a solution, to the creation of flourishing lives and societies lies in \"The journey of reconnection\". Perhaps it feels abstract and not relevant to many even though the quote from the Dalai Lama above probably resonates with most. In (very) short, being regenerative is about creating systems, that generate life. All kinds of systems. Thus if we want to be the catalysts of generating life in our own, inner system, in our close relationships, in our organizations and societies, and in collaboration with the nature that we are a part of, then it is undeniably essential that we learn to \"reconnect\". Reconnection is, however, not something that can happen only by studying it. Reconnection can only really happen by experience & practice. As a leader, innovator, change maker you hold one of the keys to our future in your hand. It is my profound hope that you will take the firm decision now to make The journey of reconnection your highest priority. It is an enchanting journey of reconnection between the mind & body, the inner - and outer nature, the inner feminine and masculine. Perhaps it feels abstract and with the constant distractions of an ever changing and volatile outer world keeping the work at comfortable yet frustrating distance may be the automatic 'go-to'. But today I call you, the radical change makers and bold leaders to, at least consider embarking the journey of re-connection, so that you can \"reconnect to regenerate\" - and become what you want to see in the world. I am, together with Nature itself , at your service, if you want assistance on the way ."
