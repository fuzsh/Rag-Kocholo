        "text": "Data from in vivo studies, which were designed to identify the toxicokinetic properties of the substance, are not available. This means, that absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) can only be derived from available physical-chemical data.\n\nTo estimate the toxicokinetic properties of the substance the following information was considered (cited from IUCLID5 data file, section 4):\n\nAbsorption:\n\nBased on above data the substance may be absorbed through the skin in relevant amounts (molecular weight < 500 g/Mol, -1 < log POW< 4, see EUROPEAN COMMISSION HEALTH & CONSUMER PROTECTION DIRETORATE-GENERAL: Guidance Document on Dermal Absorpiton Sanco/222/2000 rev. 7 19 March 2004).\n\nFor exposure assessments a default value of 100 % of absorption after dermal exposure may be appropriate.\n\nThe uptake after direct inhalation of the substance may be of low relevance due to the high mean diameter of particles, which significantly exceeds the maximum inhalable particle diameter of 10 Âµm. Uptake by inhalation after evaporation is unlikely, the substance is a solid at room temperature and has a very high boiling point together with a very low vapour pressure.\n\nThe absorption after oral ingestion cannot be calculated due to lack of data; by default an absorption of 100 % may be appropriate, until specific data will be available, although such a high absorption is rather unlikely.\n\nDistribution:\n\nThe substance is neither highly lipophilic nor highly hydrophilic the fact of which makes an estimation on which body compartment would be preferred for distribution n the human body practically impossible such that a more detailed description is futile.\n\nDue to the log Pow of 1.44 only a low potential for bioaccumulation is expected.\n\nMetabolism and Excretion:\n\nMetabolic conversions at the tolyl moiety or the triazine ring are quite unlikely. The aromatic rings can be hydroxylated by certain phase I metabolic enzymes but this will happen to a small proportion.\n\nThere are no structural elements likely to undergo Phase II metabolism reactions. Typical Phase II metabolic enzymes like sulfotransferases, acetyltransferases and glucuronosyltransferases can only affect after Phase I metabolic reactions.\n\nAll of these reaction will increase the relatively low water solubility of the substance and improve urinary excretion, which may be the most relevant way of excretion for this substance.\n\nBut even when the water solubility stays low, a renal excretion of the unchanged molecule is possible.\n\nAnother relevant pathway for exretion may be by feces, especially for the fraction, which has not been absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract after oral uptake.\n\nExcretion by exhalation does not seem to be relevant."
