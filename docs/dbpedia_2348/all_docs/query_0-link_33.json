        "text": "What is your job, and how long have you been sailing?\n\nMy name is Thomas Svoboda.\n\nI am a Chief Engineer at WIND ENTERPRISE, and I started my career at sea back in 1986.\n\nAs a Chief Engineer, I am responsible for the engineering onboard the vessel.\n\nSome of the daily tasks are to keep track of the consumption for the customer.\n\nThe customer has chartered the ship for three to four years, and they want to see what they pay for everyday.\n\nAnother task is to make sure that all safety rules are met. For example, when we repair our FRC boat, we conduct tests, to make sure that everything works 100%.\n\nWhat motivates you to go to work every day?\n\nI must always have the sea close to me.\n\nThere is something that captures your soul.\n\nAbout ten years ago, I thought something new was going to happen and tried to go ashore.\n\nI was on land for one and a half years and had to give in at last.\n\nOnce you have tried being at sea, there is something that draws you back. So I had to go back."
