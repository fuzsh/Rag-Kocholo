        "text": "How do we create a Wikimedia chapter?\n\nAt the most fundamental level, chapters are about people: a group, bound geographically, which wants to contribute to and support the Wikimedia projects as a whole in ways other than editing.\n\nFor long-term sustainability of the chapter, the Affiliations Committee recommends that you gather a community of at least 20–25 people who are interested in creating or joining the chapter. Make sure that your group has the required number of people before proceeding.\n\n(During step 3 or 7, you might find out that the laws of your country may require a greater number of people to participate in the creation of the organization.)\n\nBefore moving forward, discuss among yourselves the advantages and disadvantages of setting up an organization; organizations take a lot of time, effort and resources once they are set up. Is it necessary to set up a chapter to achieve your goals? How will setting up an organization help achieve those goals? Can you accomplish those goals as a Wikimedia user group?\n\nOnce you have a group of people interested in pursuing the goals, determine whether there are like-minded organizations in the area (for example chapters or user groups) that might be able to host your projects or provide initial help in setting up. Is there already an existing organization that you can connect to instead of starting your own?\n\nThen you can think about what the mission is of the organization you'd like to start. Is this mission broad and is your group primarily geographically focused, or is it more narrowly defined? Try to draft your mission jointly with the whole group and make sure everybody agrees on that.\n\nOnce you are certain that a chapter is the best way forward, contact the Affiliations Committee and any other Wikimedia organizations that might be active in the area and let them know about your plans.\n\nWhen you have your minimum group of people, start a conversation on your future chapter's goals and structure. Try these questions:\n\nWhat do you want to accomplish as a chapter? What is your mission?\n\nWhat kind of activities do you want to engage in (e.g. outreach, fundraising, public relations, publishing)?\n\nWhat kind of structure would be best for the organization? Would a board and membership structure be the right model?\n\nWhat would be the roles and responsibilities of the board and your assembly? Who would decide what, in practice?\n\nHow do you imagine your organisation in a two years' time? In five years' time?\n\nIn determining your goals and structure, you may want to contact existing chapters for advice and ideas.\n\nWhen you set up your application page on the wiki, you'll want to identify the name for your chapter.\n\nThe legal name of the chapter should be \"Wikimedia [name of country in local language]\".\n\nEksempler på acceptable navne:\n\nIkke acceptabelt at bruge:\n\nWikiland Wikimedia\n\nOnce you have a group of interested people, it's time to document who you are and to set up some means of communications. For the external world, you need to designate two contact people who can be identified to the Wikimedia Foundation; within the group, think about setting up a wiki page where people can join; perhaps set up a mailing list or talk page or other forum to discuss your projects.\n\nWhile not required, groups interested in becoming chapters are strongly encouraged to first begin as a Wikimedia user group. The requirements and expectations for user groups are intentionally designed to allow for less resource intensive operation of a group. A two-year track record is required of all chapter applicants, and both the Affiliations Committee and Board of Trustees are more likely to feel confident about your group's suitability to become the formal representative of the Wikimedia movement in your subject area if your group a track record as a recognized user group in good standing.\n\nSo, you have some interested Wikimedians, and you have some basic idea about the kinds of activities the group would want to have as an officially recognized Wikimedia chapter.\n\nThis is a perfect time to begin running programs, which will give your group a concrete experience with running Wikimedian activities/events, strengthen the group's internal cohesion, increase motivation, and potentially draw in additional activists.\n\nHere's a little secret: nearly all activities and programs performed by chapters can be performed by non-chapters. Aside from fundraising and certain types of government outreach, any group of Wikimedians with the will and dedication to execute a program can do so, and the Wikimedia movement has resources in place to help you do so:\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation may grant you ad hoc permission to use the Wikimedia trademarks (e.g. the Wikipedia logo, Wikimedia logo) for specific events or activities; the Foundation may provide funding for your program via the competitive process called the Wikimedia Grants Program; other Wikimedia organizations may offer funding, advice, and other resources.\n\nApplicants are required to have developed and conducted offline and online activities over at least two years prior to seeking recognition as a chapter.\n\nSo select a program you'd like to run in your community or territory, making sure the scope is manageable and achievable for your group and your resources (especially human resources, i.e. time and skills), before proceeding with the legal aspects of chapter creation.\n\nYour chapter's bylaws (statutes, or whatever the name of this document is in your language) should define the goals and objectives of your association in time and space. They should be precise and to the point. Avoid definitions that are too vague or restrictive.\n\nWhen drafting the documents, you need to take several factors into account (in the order given below):\n\nlove gældende i landet/staten\n\nTo ensure that these factors are taken into account, we created a Bylaws guidelines resource page to assist you. we advise you to peruse the this guideline as well as bylaws of other organisations in your country and then adapt those to the Wikimedia requirements and guidelines. Don't try and translate existing Wikimedia chapters' bylaws, as legal language differs from one country to another and what seems evident in one country may make no sense in another.\n\nIf you have a lawyer in your group, make sure they are a strong part of the writing process; remember that you are ultimately responsible for the legal compliance of your organisation with the local laws.\n\nIn every part of this process, do not hesitate to ask the Affiliations Committee for advice.\n\nOnce you've gathered the group, the wiki page, legal documents, and the big ideas on what you want to do, follow the steps below to apply for Chapter recognition.\n\nThe committee will begin their review and comment period for the bylaws as you continue to complete your application. Once the committee sends feedback regarding your bylaws, please be sure to revise bylaws as appropriate, based on committee feedback.\n\nThe Affiliations Committee will review your application and governing documents, and then will submit them to the Board of the Wikimedia Foundation to approve the creation of your organization as a Wikimedia chapter. Usually, before final approval, the Affiliations Committee will ask a number of questions and possibly suggest changes based on experience learned from other Wikimedia and non-profit organizations. In this case, final approval will be given once your group has had a chance to review and answer the suggestions and to make any changes your group has found useful.\n\nKeep reading below for help on applying for recognition.\n\nWhen your chapter's goals and organization are agreed and your documents are ready (but before you do anything that would make the association official, like opening a bank account, holding a founding assembly, or registering with your country's authorities), you should translate them into English and submit them to the Affiliations Committee for approval.\n\nThe Affiliations Committee might ask for a lawyer-approved translation of the bylaws, in which case it will provide the necessary budget to translate the bylaws.\n\nOnce you've received Foundation Board approval, you can register your association by the standard means in your country. You will need to sign a chapter agreement with the Foundation. At this stage, other agreements may need to be signed between the Foundation and the chapter."
