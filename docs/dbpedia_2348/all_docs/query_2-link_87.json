        "text": "The year 2023 set new records both nationally and globally, surprising even the experts with its weather patterns. On January 1st, Denmark experienced its highest January temperature ever recorded at 12.6 degrees Celsius. It also became the wettest January on record, transitioning from the sunniest June with drought conditions to the wettest July. The ground is saturated, and the groundwater level is high. This became even more evident after the historic storm surge that hit the country on October 20th, with water levels measuring up to 216 cm. All these events underscore what we already know: there is an urgent need for action NOW!\n\nOn October 23rd, the national climate adaptation plan - Climate Adaptation Plan 1 - was presented in Thyborøn. The plan is intended to lay the groundwork for a more resilient Denmark, capable of taking stronger measures to protect our coasts, cities, homes, and infrastructure from the consequences of climate change. However, as we saw with the storm surge just 3 days prior, it's evident that we are facing significant challenges, requiring diverse perspectives to achieve the best protection.\n\n​At the climate summit, we focus on action. What does Climate Adaptation Plan 1 mean for our efforts, and what further steps do we need to take to work towards a climate-adapted Denmark? We acknowledge that climate adaptation is complex and costly. It is crucial to determine how the bills are distributed and how we ensure that the financing leads to effective results.\n\nWith a holistic approach, we integrate climate adaptation into nature and environmental considerations, CO2 reduction, agriculture, urban planning and citizen involvement. We will share knowledge and lift together - and turn challenges into opportunities in a long-term perspective for Denmark and for our future generations."
