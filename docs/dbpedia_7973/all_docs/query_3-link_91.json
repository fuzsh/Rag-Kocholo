        "text": "Comment\n\nTrump’s Got Troubles\n\nHis campaign is careening, his poll numbers are slipping, and, after something of a summer lull, he is due for several confrontations in court.\n\nPersons of Interest\n\nA Chinese Memoirist’s Exile in Las Vegas\n\nGao Ertai hasn’t returned to his homeland in years, but his memoirs have made him a new model of resistance.\n\nQ. & A.\n\nWhat the Latest Presidential Polls Say and What They Might Be Missing\n\nNate Cohn, the New York Times’ chief political analyst, breaks down Kamala Harris’s performance in the battleground states and how we should think about polling error.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nPaul Skenes Is a Heroic Figure in Baseball’s Antiheroic Age\n\nThe tall, young, mustachioed pitcher throws hard—so hard that his team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, is doing everything it can to be careful with him.\n\nIn London, Taylor Swift and Her Fans Are in Their “Fearless” Era\n\nFollowing a terrorist threat targeting the pop star’s concerts in Vienna, and the murder of three children at a Swift-themed dance party in the U.K., the Eras Tour continues with heightened security.\n\nThe Story That “Hillbilly Elegy” Doesn’t Tell\n\nLike many memoirs, J. D. Vance’s book misses a few details, some of which complicate the story upon which he has based much of his politics.\n\nThe Warped World of the U.K. Rioters\n\nThe United Kingdom has become more multicultural, but a wave of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant violence raises the possibility that it is also becoming more racist.\n\nThe Russian Prisoner Who Didn’t Want to Be Freed\n\nThe opposition figure Ilya Yashin was part of the exchange that led to the release of Evan Gershkovich. Now, in Germany, he dreams of returning to his cell in Russia.\n\nLetter from Biden’s Washington\n\nKamala Harris’s Best Campaign Surrogate Is Donald Trump\n\nThe ex-President’s tired old show is a great advertisement for his new rival.\n\nFault Lines\n\nWhat Makes Nancy Pelosi So Appealing Now\n\nHer ruthless pragmatism and reliance on subtext are refreshing after years of lefty infighting and Donald Trump’s endless blather.\n\nOpen Questions\n\nAre We Living in the Age of Info-Determinism?\n\nIncreasingly, our networks seem to be steering our history in ways we don’t like and can’t control.\n\nInfinite Scroll\n\nPopping the Bubble of Noise-Cancelling Headphones\n\nA new Japanese-designed device promises to “unmute the world,” as if it were no longer possible to do so simply by uncovering your ears.\n\nThe Current Cinema\n\nWith “Close Your Eyes,” a Legendary Filmmaker Makes a Stunning Return\n\nIn his first feature in more than two decades, the Spanish director Víctor Erice tells a story haunted by the ghosts of cinema past.\n\nUnder Review\n\nA Frank Account of an Unequal Art-World Friendship\n\nOrlando Whitfield’s memoir of his fifteen-year friendship with the disgraced art dealer Inigo Philbrick gives a momentous relationship its due, with unusual directness.\n\nThe Front Row\n\nJacques Rozier’s Inspired Improvisations\n\nA retrospective of the great director’s rarely screened movies reveals his extraordinary vision of ordinary life.\n\nPhoto Booth\n\nThe Ghosts of the Cuban National Ballet\n\nDiana Markosian’s images of a once great institution have an aura of decay and pose a question about what motivates the dancers who remain.\n\nCultural Comment\n\nIn “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,” Feeding Your Family Comes First\n\nFifty years on, the film reads like sociology: assembly lines make the working class deranged, technology makes them irrelevant, and unemployment makes them hungry.\n\nCritics at Large\n\nCharli XCX, Chappell Roan, and the Unstable Hierarchy of Pop\n\nThis summer’s releases have breathed new life into the genre—and underscored the challenges of staying relevant in a cutthroat music landscape.\n\n“The Door Between Us”\n\nAgain, I pressed my ear against the wall, but I heard nothing. Why couldn’t I have said something to her?\n\n“The Penthouse”\n\nWe were lying on their bed. We were trying to be still and not ruin anything else.
