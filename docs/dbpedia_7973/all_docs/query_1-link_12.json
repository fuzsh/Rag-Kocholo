Its plot follows the story of identical twin sisters, who find their bond tested when one of them falls in love with a man and the other sister sets out to discover the truth about him.\n\nThe Image of You was released theatrically and on digital in the United States on May 10, 2024.[1]\n\nPremise\n\n[edit]\n\nAnna and Zoe are identical twins, who share a bond so close that nothing – and no one – can tear them apart. But the two twins have very different personalities; while Anna is romantic and trusting, her sister Zoe is daring and dangerous. When Anna meets charismatic Nick, an ambitious stock trader, she thinks he's perfect. But Zoe, who has seen Anna betrayed by men before, doesn't trust him. She's determined to find who Nick really is and discover the truth about him, no matter who stands in the way. As Zoe digs for the truth, they're all pulled into a dangerous game where honesty could prove fatal.[2][3]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nSasha Pieterse as Anna and Zoe\n\nParker Young as Nick\n\nNéstor Carbonell as David\n\nMira Sorvino as Alexia\n\nMichele Nordin as Rebecca\n\nBen Milliken as Hal\n\nRebekah Graf as Isabelle\n\nAnne Sward as Pamela\n\nMark Provencher as Ivan\n\nKate Rachesky as Kayla\n\nOgy Durham as Vera\n\nTeo Santos as Pete\n\nMark Provencher as Ivan\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nIn July 2023, Deadline announced that Republic Pictures has snapped up rights to The Image of You - an adaptation of the same-name novel from UK-based bestseller Adele Parks, which Jeff Fisher directs from a script by Chris Sivertson.[2] Motion Picture Corporation of America's CEO Brad Krevoy with David Wulf and Ernie Barbarash were confirmed as main producers, along with Amanda Phillips, Lorenzo Nardini, Aj Risch and Kaan Karahan also serve as exec producers. Sasha Pieterse was cast in starring dual roles of Anna and Zoe, along with Parker Young in the role of Nick.[4] Néstor Carbonell and Academy Award winner Mira Sorvino were also added to the cast list, in the role of the twins’ wealthy parents, Alexia and David, with Michele Nordin as Nick's sister, Rebecca.[2][4]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Image of You was theatrically released in the United States on May 10, 2024.[5] From the day of the premiere, the film was also available via PVOD,[6] followed by digital platforms Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV.[7][8] It had a limited theatrical run and was released in select theaters.[9][6][10]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 63% of 8 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 4.8/10.[11]\n\nWill Sayre from MovieWeb gave the film two and a half out of five stars, opining that \"The storyline digresses significantly from the hit novel by Parks by the end, but other elements are also responsible for hiccups along the way, such as cheesy stylistic choices on the filmmaking front that almost make this feature film feel like an elongated network TV episode.\"[12]\n\nKyle Climas of FilmSpeak.net gave the film an average grade of \"C\" writing that \"The Image of You is one of those inexplicable films which becomes more tolerable – or at least, more entertaining – as it becomes more absurd. The actors’ performances, while stilted and clunky at first, improve over time as they embrace the hyperbole.\"[13]\n\nLeslie Felperin from The Guardian gave the film two out of five stars, stating \"There’s a bit of soft-core humping and salty talk to break up the tedium, a phenomenon that’s fast disappearing from most mainstream films. The ripe naffness on the show makes it somehow entertaining.\"[14]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
