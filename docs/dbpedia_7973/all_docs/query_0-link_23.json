        "text": "About Bunker Hill\n\nOn June 17, 1775, New England soldiers faced the British army for the first time in a pitched battle. Popularly known as \"The Battle of Bunker Hill,\" bloody fighting took place throughout a hilly landscape of fenced pastures that were situated across the Charles River from Boston. Though the British forces claimed the field, the casualties inflicted by the Provincial solders from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire were staggering. Of the some 2,400 British soldiers and Marines engaged, some 1,000 were wounded or killed.\n\n50 years after the battle, the Marquis De Lafayette set the cornerstone of what would become a lasting monument and tribute to the memory of the Battle of Bunker Hill. The ambitious project to construct a 221-foot tall obelisk built entirely from quarried granite took over seventeen years to complete. Dedicated in 1843, the Monument stands prominently atop Breed's Hill. Marking the site where Provincial forces constructed an earthen fort, or \"redoubt,\" prior to the battle, this site remains the focal point of the battle's memory.\n\nThe Bunker Hill Monument, Lodge, and Museum are National Park Service sites.\n\nMonument & Lodge Hours\n\nTo climb the Monument, enter the Bunker Hill Lodge. Visitors can also explore views from the top of the monument through 360 degree Live Webcams.\n\nPlease note:\n\nOnly 20 people are allowed in the Monument at a time.\n\nThe Monument may close for climbing due to weather conditions and/or other safety considerations.\n\nMuseum Hours\n\nLearn about the Battle and Monument by visiting the Bunker Hill Museum. Here, park staff are available to answer questions and there are restrooms open to the public.\n\nAdmissions\n\nFree admission\n\nAccessibility\n\nThe Bunker Hill Lodge and the base of the Monument are accessible.
