        "text": "From the 1920s-1940s, in America and Britain, many writers, artists, poets, musicians and other cultural workers were drawn to socially democratic artforms, influenced by Popular Front cultural aesthetics. The very broad group, which may have been ‘pro Communist’ politically and interested in diverse expressions of egalitarianism culturally, are frequently defined mainly in relationship to theContinue reading “Gold and Swingler”\n\nLucy J. Havard reviews an ‘immensely enjoyable and engaging’ look at scientific enquiry as it took place in the eighteenth-century home.\n\nThomas Ellis reviews Diana Cucuz’s book on women, gender, and the politics of selling U.S. consumer culture and domesticity during the early Cold War through “polite propaganda.”\n\nRebecca Martin reviews this ‘important collection’ showing how biographical narratives can shed light on alternative, little known or under-researched aspects of state power in African politics.\n\nCharlie Taverner reviews a ‘thorough and stimulating’ major exhibition exploring our relationship with milk and its place in global politics, society, and culture.\n\nHannah Holtschneider reviews a compelling exploration of changing ideas about race, of human relationships in colonial empires, of Jewish minorities in slave societies, of religious identity and belonging, and of migration across the Anglophone Atlantic from the late eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nIt is hard to review this book without lapsing into the language of academic letters of recommendation: it is brilliant, illuminating.

These roughly cover the pre- and post-1946 periods and are thus divided by the formation of the interim government in India during the transfer ofContinue reading “Nehru’s Voice”\n\nCatherine Carstairs’s new history, The Smile Gap: A History of Oral Health and Social Inequality, explores the changes in oral healthcare in Canada from the beginning of the 20th century to the present. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including patient voices, Carstairs considers oral health history from a number of angles. Given howContinue reading “The Smile Gap: A History of Oral Health and Social Inequality”\n\nCities of the Plain Cities of the Plain—not the ones in the Book of Genesis, but those scattered across Wallachia, between the southern Carpathians and the lower Danube.
