        "text": "Image\n\nFirst High Commissioner for Refugees appointed\n\nThe League of Nations, forerunner to the United Nations, appoints Norwegian scientist and explorer Dr. Fridtjof Nansen as the first High Commissioner for Refugees, marking the start of the modern international system for protecting refugees.\n\nPictured: The First Assembly of the League of Nations in Geneva, 15 November 1920.\n\n© UNHCR\n\nImage\n\nThe Nansen Passport is introduced\n\nOne of the biggest problems refugees left displaced and stateless by the First World War face is a lack of internationally recognized identification papers.\n\nIn response, the High Commissioner introduces the 'Nansen Passport'. It is effectively one of the first legal instruments to grant international protection to refugees and allows almost half a million displaced people the right to settle in a new country.\n\n© UNHCR\n\nImage\n\nThe Second World War ends\n\nThe Second World War has wrought devastation across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Pacific. An estimated 60 million people have lost their lives and whole cities lie in ruins. UNHCR’s predecessor, the International Refugee Organization (IRO), helps one million people to resettle in other countries.\n\nPictured: People from camps in Germany, Austria and Italy prepare to board an IRO-chartered ship to the United States of America in 1951.\n\n© UNHCR\n\nImage\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations unanimously adopts the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nArticle 14 (1) of the Declaration states: “Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.”\n\n© UNHCR/J.Cadoux\n\nImage\n\nUNHCR is born\n\nThe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is established by the United Nations General Assembly, mandated to \"assume the function of providing international protection [...] to refugees who fall within the scope of the present Statute and of seeking permanent solutions for the problem of refugees\".\n\nThe Office's first task is to help the more than one million people who remain displaced after the Second World War, mainly in Europe. UNHCR has a three-year mandate to complete this work and then disband.\n\n© UNHCR\n\nImage\n\nThe Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees\n\nThe 1951 Convention is adopted. It consolidates earlier international instruments and provides the most comprehensive codification of refugee rights at the time.\n\nIt defines the term ‘refugee’, outlines their rights and the international standards of treatment for their protection. However, significantly, it is limited to persons who became refugees before 1 January 1951.\n\n© UNHCR\n\nImage\n\nUNHCR awarded the Nobel Peace Prize\n\nUNHCR receives the 1954 Nobel Peace Prize, with the ceremony taking place in 1955. UNHCR is the first United Nations agency to receive the award.\n\nDuring his Nobel Lecture, then High Commissioner Gerrit Jan van Heuven Goedhart said \"There can be no real peace in this world as long as hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children [...] still remain in camps and live in misery and in the greatest uncertainty of their future.\"\n\n© UNHCR/E.Skau\n\nImage\n\nHungarian uprising\n\nThe Hungarian uprising and its brutal suppression see more than 200,000 people flee to neighbouring countries. UNHCR faces its first post-war emergency, coordinating help for the thousands of displaced who arrive exhausted, hungry and in need of shelter.\n\nThis marks UNHCR’s transformation from an organization that dealt with the aftermath of the Second World War to one that could rise to the challenge of new, large-scale emergencies.\n\n© UNHCR\n\nImage\n\nAlgerian War of Independence as colonialism winds down in Africa\n\nIn May 1957, Tunisia asks UNHCR for assistance to protect thousands of Algerian refugees who have fled the War of Independence with France in their country. It is Africa's first modern refugee crisis and UNHCR’s first involvement on the African continent. UNHCR provides food, clothing and medical assistance to over 200,000 refugees in Tunisia as well as Morocco.\n\nThe following decade will see UNHCR support tens of thousands of people who flee the chaos of independence struggles in parts of Africa as colonialism winds down.\n\n© UNHCR/Stanley Wright\n\nImage\n\nThe 1967 Protocol is adopted\n\nThe need for refugee aid and protection has spread far beyond Europe. Huge new refugee populations have been created in Asia and Africa.\n\nThe 1967 Protocol is introduced to amend the 1951 Refugee Convention, which was limited to those who became refugees before 1 January 1951. It extends protection to all refugees no matter the date they were forced to leave their homes.\n\n© UNHCR/E.Schlatter\n\nImage\n\nFall of Saigon\n\nFollowing the fall of Saigon, thousands of Vietnamese refugees take to the sea despite the risks of piracy and drowning. The group pictured made it to Malaysia in 1978 after their small boat sank mere metres from the shore.\n\nNearly 255,000 Vietnamese 'boat-people' were given temporary asylum in Malaysia, with UNHCR helping over 240,000 resettle in other countries.\n\n© UNHCR/Kaspar Gaugler\n\nImage\n\nHeight of the Indochina refugee crisis\n\nUpheavals following the Communist victories in former French colonies of Cambodia, Laos and Viet Nam continue to drive mass displacement in the region.\n\nUnder the brutal Khmer Rouge regime, an estimated one million people are executed or die of starvation, disease or overwork. When the regime falls in 1979, hundreds of thousands stream into neighbouring Thailand to shelter in UNHCR-supported camps, among them many unaccompanied children.\n\n© UNHCR/R.Burrows\n\nImage\n\nCentral America civil wars and unrest\n\nUNHCR is involved in Central America for the first time as civil wars and widespread human rights abuses displace two million people from Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.\n\nMore than 300,000 people were assisted in the region, including this Guatemalan refugee photographed in 1982 in Mexico, where UNHCR organized agricultural and other self-sufficiency projects.\n\n© UNHCR/Marc Vanappelghem\n\nImage\n\nUNHCR is awarded a second Nobel Peace Prize\n\nIn recognition of efforts to protect millions of refugees displaced around the world, UNHCR receives the 1981 Nobel Peace Prize. It is only the second time an organization has received the prize twice, and UNHCR is the only UN agency to do so.\n\n“Today, the voices of millions of refugees in the world are being heard. Voices seeking belief in man, in human dignity, in basic human rights,” said then High Commissioner Mr. Poul Hartling in his Nobel Lecture.\n\n© Norsk Presse Servece/Jens Kvale\n\nImage\n\nRwandan genocide\n\nAn estimated 800,000 Rwandans are killed in widespread massacres between April and July 1994. A further two million people flee in a mass exodus to neighbouring countries.\n\nUNHCR provides protection and assistance, including establishing camps and coordinating humanitarian aid. At the time, it was one of the most complex and challenging emergencies UNHCR had faced.\n\n© UNHCR/Panos Moumtzis\n\nImage\n\nUNHCR’s mandate is made permanent\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly removes the time limitation on the continuation of the Office of the High Commissioner, making the mandate permanent “until the refugee problem is solved.”\n\nPrior to this, UNHCR’s mandate had been formally renewed every few years.\n\n© UNHCR/Mark Henley\n\nImage\n\nSyrian crisis\n\nConflict in Syria breaks out in March 2011, forcing millions to flee their homes over the next few years. Many will remain displaced for years to come, with an estimated 6.8 million Syrian refugees still displaced abroad in 2021, over a decade after the war began.\n\nPictured: Syrian refugees walk the final metres across the desert toward the Jordanian border in January 2014.\n\n© UNHCR/Jared Kohler\n\nImage\n\nMediterranean refugee crisis\n\nThe Mediterranean refugee crisis dramatically escalates. One million refugees and migrants arrive in Europe by sea. Many make the crossing in overcrowded and unsafe boats that stall or sink on the way. In 2015 alone, over 3,700 people die or go missing at sea.\n\nUNHCR provides support and care as people arrive and along key migration routes in Europe, while also calling for a comprehensive European response to the crisis and emphasizing the need for safe and legal asylum pathways.\n\n© UNHCR/Gordon Welters\n\nImage\n\nUkraine war triggers fastest-growing refugee crisis since Second World War\n\nThe Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sees 5.7 million Ukrainians flee their country, the fastest outflow of refugees on record since the Second World War.\n\nBy the end of the year, the total global number of people forcibly displaced will top 100 million people, meaning 1 in every 74 people on earth has been forced to flee.\n\nPictured: A father says farewell to his family at Lviv bus station in western Ukraine as they leave for safety. © UNHCR/Valerio Muscella"
