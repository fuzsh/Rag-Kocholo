        "text": "A third of adults under age 35 say it is extremely or very important that the U.S. play an active role in world affairs.\n\nA median of 40% of adults across 34 other countries surveyed in 2024 say U.S. democracy used to be a good example for other countries to follow.\n\nA median of 54% of adults in these nations have a favorable view of the U.S., while a median of 35% see China favorably.\n\nAmericans and Israelis now see one another’s leaders more negatively than in the recent past, and other key views have shifted as well.\n\nIn most places surveyed, more people name China’s influence as a major threat than any of the other geopolitical issues asked about.\n\nWe examine how the U.S. and China stack up to one another on more than 10 measures of international public opinion, spanning from confidence in their leaders to views of their universities and technological achievements.\n\nPeople in Hungary and Poland have different views on the future of the economic sanctions that the European Union and the U.S. have imposed on Russia. Roughly half of Hungarians believe these sanctions should be decreased, while just 3% of Poles say the same. Most Polish adults (67%) prefer instead to increase sanctions against Russia.\n\nAbout six-in-ten Mexicans (59%) say that people who move to the U.S. have a better life there. 34% of Mexicans say that life is neither better nor worse in the U.S."
