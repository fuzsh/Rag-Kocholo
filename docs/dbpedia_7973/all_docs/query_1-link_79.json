Patent Public Search has two user-selectable modern interfaces that provide enhanced access to prior art. The new, powerful, and flexible capabilities of the application will improve the overall patent searching process.\n\nIf you are new to patent searches, or want to use the functionality that was available in the USPTOâ€™s PatFT/AppFT, select Basic search to look for patents by keywords or common fields, such as inventor or publication number. Select Advanced search to use full query options as well as to further filter a patent search by database or organize documents through tagging."
