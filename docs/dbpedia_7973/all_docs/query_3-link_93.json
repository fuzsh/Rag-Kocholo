        "text": "Most people think that Fish and Chips originated in England, this is not actually true. The real history of Fish and Chips is traced back to 15th Century Portugal where the dish really was invented. Like so many other famous dishes, fish and chips was created out of necessity, not culinary genius.\n\nRead on to hear the whole history of fish and chips and how it became an English staple!\n\nJust a little pun. But did you know that the first Friday in June every year is National Fish & Chips Day? This year (2021) it will be celebrated on June 4. Here at Skull Creek Dockside we serve a classic rendition of the dish and thought it would be fun to investigate the origins of what we believed was a classic British dish. Well, we were a little surprised with what we found out and we think you will be too.\n\nThe pairing of fish and chips has long been considered a British staple. The irresistible combination of a hunk of battered cod resting atop a mound of steaming hot chips (french fries in America) is the quintessential British comfort food. Whether eaten on a plastic tray on your lap in front of the “telly” or gobbled down from a makeshift paper cone on the way home from the pub, a meal of fish and chips is like a serving of deep fried nostalgia in the UK – and let’s not forget a sprinkling of salt and vinegar.\n\nAt the dish’s peak of popularity in the late 1920s, there were 35,000 fish and chips shops in the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland). Today, there are still 10,500 “chippies” in the U.K. serving 360 million meals of fish and chips every year. That’s the equivalent of six servings of fish and chips to every British man, woman, and child.\n\nIn his London based novel Oliver Twist (1837), Charles Dickens refers to “fried fish warehouses,” the forerunner to the modern chippie where bread or baked potato were served alongside the fish.\n\nA little later, in 1845, cook and writer Alenis Soyer in his first edition of A Shilling Cooking for the People gave a recipe for “Fried Fish, Jewish Fashion” which was fish dipped into a batter of flour and water and then fried.\n\nBut it wasn’t until the latter part of the 19th century that Jewish fried fish fully made the cultural transfer from the streets of London to the broader British populace. And for that food historians credit two developments. First, the advent of industrial scale trawl fishing in the North Sea meant that inexpensive fish could be transported to all corners of the U.K. by the second development, extensive railroad lines. Fried fish consumption rocketed with these technological advances.\n\nThat basically covers the fish bit, but what about the second half of the dish?\n\nTHE CHIP MYSTERY\n\nNobody is entirely sure how fried potatoes became a part of the European diet. Food historians do know that it took a really long time for fried potatoes (or potatoes of any kind) to make their way to England.\n\nBelgium stakes a claim as the inventor of fried potatoes. The story goes that in 1680 winter was so cold that the River Meuse (located in present day Belgium) froze over and that the women in the area would turn to cutting potatoes in the shape of fish and frying them in a bit of oil so as to provide sustenance for their families.\n\nGoing back to Charles Dickens, he mentions in his 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities, “husky chips of potato fried with some reluctant drops of oil,” which means that chips had definitely reached England by mid-century.\n\nAccording to legend, British soldiers storming the Normandy beaches on D-Day would identify each other by yelling out, “Fish,” and waiting for the barely coded response, “Chips.”\n\nIn modern, multicultural U.K., there is plenty of competition for the National dish. In fact, chicken tikka masala makes a strong claim but most food writers, cooks, and chefs still regard fish and chips as a culinary symbol of Britishness.\n\nSome chippy traditions have changed over the years. For example during the war years, paper rations meant that fish and chips were served in cones of yesterday’s newspaper. That practice went out of favor in the 1980s when it was deemed unsafe for food to come in contact with newspaper ink without a greaseproof paper in between. And, traditionally, fish and chips were accompanied by salt and malt vinegar, but younger generations have turned to curry sauce and, heaven forbid, even ketchup."
