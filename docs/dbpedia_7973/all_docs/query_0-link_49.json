        "text": "What is the purpose of marking?\n\nTo inform the ultimate purchaser in the United States of the country in which the imported article was made.\n\nWho is the ultimate purchaser?\n\nThe ultimate purchaser is generally the last person in the United States who will receive the article in the form in which it was imported.\n\nIf the article will be used in manufacture, the manufacturer or processor in the United States is the ultimate purchaser if the processing of the imported article results in a substantial transformation of the imported article, becomes a good of the United States under the NAFTA Marking Rules (19 CFR Part 102), or becomes a good of the United States under the textile rules of origin (19 CFR 102.21), as applicable.\n\nWhat is meant by “country”?\n\nCountry means the political entity known as a nation. Colonies, possessions, or protectorates outside the boundaries of the mother country may be considered separate countries.\n\nWhat is the country of origin?\n\nThe country of manufacture, production, or growth of the article.\n\nDoes altering the article in a second country change the country of origin?\n\nThe country of origin of an article may be changed in a secondary country if one of the following occurs:\n\nIf the further work or material added to an article in the second country constitutes a substantial transformation. A substantial transformation occurs if a new article with a different name, character, and use is created.\n\nFor a good from a NAFTA country: if under the NAFTA Marking Rules (19 CFR Part 102) the second country is determined to be the country of origin of the good; or\n\nFor an article considered to be a textile or apparel product (regardless of whether it is a good from a NAFTA country): if the country of origin is determined by the general rules set forth in 19 CFR Part 102.21 to be the second country. For purposes of determining whether a textile or apparel product is from Israel, the general rules in 19 CFR 12.130 apply.\n\nIs it necessary for the words made in or product of to precede the name of the country of origin?\n\nThe phrase “made in” is required only in the case where the name of any locality other than the country or locality in which the article was manufactured appears on the article or its container and may mislead or deceive the ultimate purchaser. The marking “made in (country)” or other words of similar meaning must appear in close proximity to, and in comparable size letters of, the other locality to avoid possible confusion.\n\nUse of the words “assembled in” may be used to indicate the country of origin of an article where the country of origin of the article is the country in which the article was finally assembled. “Assembled in” may be followed by the statement “from components of (the name of the country or countries of origin of all the components).”\n\nShould the marking be of a particular size?\n\nThe marking must be legible. This means it must be of an adequate size, and clear enough, to be read easily by a person of normal vision.\n\nWhere should the marking be located?\n\nThe marking should be located in a conspicuous place. It need not be in the most conspicuous place, but it must be where it can be seen with a casual handling of the article. Markings must be in a position where they will not be covered or concealed by subsequent attachments or additions. The marking must be visible without disassembling the item or removing or changing the position of any parts.\n\nHow permanent must the marking be?\n\nThe article should be marked as indelibly and permanently as the nature of the product will permit. Marking that will not remain on the article during handling or for any other reason except deliberate removal is not a proper marking.\n\nAbbreviations and Variant Spellings\n\nAbbreviations that unmistakably indicate the name of a country, such as “Gt. Britain” for Great Britain or “Luxemb” for Luxembourg, are acceptable. Variant spellings which clearly indicate the English name of the country of origin, such as “Brasil” for Brazil and “Italie” for Italy are acceptable. However, it is always preferable to spell out the country’s name in full, because any abbreviation may be a cause for confusion.\n\nHowever, “E.C.” or “E.U.” for European Community or European Union, respectively, are not acceptable abbreviations since they do not indicate the individual country of origin of the good.\n\nWhat are the acceptable forms of marking?\n\nThe best form of marking is one which becomes a part of the article itself, such as branding, stenciling, stamping, printing, molding, and similar methods.\n\nOther forms of marking will also be acceptable if it is certain that the marking will remain legible and conspicuous until the article reaches the ultimate purchaser in the United States. It is important that this marking withstand handling. This means it must be of a type that can be defaced, destroyed, removed, altered, obliterated, or obscured only by a deliberate act.\n\nWhat about tags?\n\nWhen tags are used, they must be attached in a conspicuous place and in a manner that assures that, unless deliberately removed, they will remain on the article until it reaches the ultimate purchaser.\n\nMay adhesive labels be used?\n\nLabels may be used in some instances, but this is not a recommended form. Often labels become loose due to weather, unsatisfactory adhesive, or other conditions. If this happens, the importer may be subject to the expense of remarking the merchandise.\n\nMarking of Combined Articles\n\nAn article that is to be combined with another article in the United States but which will retain its identity and will not undergo a change in origin must be marked “(Name of imported article) made in (country).”\n\nMarking of Containers\n\nUsual containers imported filled must be marked with the name of the country of origin of the contents of the usual container, unless the contents are marked with the country of origin and the usual containers can be readily opened for inspection of the contents.\n\nUsual containers imported empty to be filled may be excepted from individual marking if they reach the person or firm that will fill them in a carton or other container marked with the country of origin.\n\nUnusual containers imported empty, to be filled in the United States, must be marked “Container made in (country).”\n\nWhat is a usual container?\n\nThe container in which an imported article will ordinarily reach the ultimate purchaser. Usual containers or holders are not required to be marked with their own origin when imported filled.\n\nUsual containers, which are goods from a NAFTA country, are not required to be marked with their own origin, whether or not filled.\n\nWhat is an unusual container?\n\nThese may include containers not ordinarily sold at retail with their contents, or containers which have further use or value after their contents are consumed.\n\nUnusual types of containers must be marked to indicate their own origin when imported filled, in addition to any marking required to indicate the origin of their contents. For example, a vase made in France containing candy made in England must be marked: “Vase made in France, candy made in England.”\n\nWhat are the special marking requirements for watches and clocks?\n\nChapter 91, Additional U.S. Note 4, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, sets forth special marking requirements for watches and clocks:\n\n(a) Watch movements shall be marked on one or more of the bridges or top plates to show:\n\nthe name of the country of manufacture,\n\nthe name of the manufacturer or purchaser, and\n\nin words, the number of jewels, if any, serving a mechanical purpose as frictional bearings.\n\n(b) Clock movements shall be marked on the most visible part of the front or back plate to show:\n\nthe name of the country of manufacture,\n\nthe name of the manufacturer or purchaser, and\n\nthe number of jewels, if any.\n\n(c) Watch cases shall be marked on the inside or outside of the back to show:\n\nthe name of the country of manufacture, and\n\nthe name of the manufacturer or purchaser.\n\n(d) Clock cases shall be marked on the most visible part of the outside of the back to show the name of the country of manufacture.\n\nThe above movements and cases must be conspicuously and indelibly marked by cutting, die-sinking, engraving, stamping (including by means of indelible ink), or mold-marking. Movements with opto-electronic display only and cases designed for use therewith, whether entered as separate articles or as components of assembled watches or clocks, are excepted from these special marking requirements.\n\nWatches and clocks are also subject to the normal country of origin marking requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1304, and under these requirements, the movement’s country of origin should appear conspicuously and legibly on the dial face or on the outside of the back. In addition, watchbands should be marked with the country of manufacture of the band, unless the watchband is attached in the country where the watch was produced.\n\nSpecial Markings on Certain Articles\n\nThe following articles and parts thereof, unless otherwise subject to the marking exceptions provided for in 19 U.S.C. 1304, must be marked legibly and conspicuously with their country of origin by die-stamping, cast-in-mold lettering, etching (acid or electrolytic), engraving, or by means of metal plates which bear the prescribed marking and which are securely attached to the article in a conspicuous place by welding, screws, or rivets:\n\nKnives, forks, steels\n\nCleavers, clippers, shears\n\nScissors, safety razors, blades for safety razors\n\nSurgical instruments, dental instruments\n\nScientific and laboratory instruments\n\nPliers, pincers, nippers and hinged hand-tools for holding and splicing wire Vacuum containers and parts of the above articles\n\nWhat are the special marking requirements for other articles?\n\nPipes and pipe fittings of iron, steel or stainless steel must be marked by means of die stamping, cast-in-mold lettering, etching, engraving, or continuous paint stenciling. If it is commercially or technically infeasible to mark by one of these five methods, the marking may be done by an equally permanent method of marking, or, in the case of small-diameter pipe tube and fittings, by tagging the bundles.\n\nCompressed gas cylinders designed for use in the transport and storage of compressed gases must be marked by means of die stamping, molding, etching, raised lettering or an equally permanent method of marking.\n\nManhole rings or frames, covers, and assemblies thereof must be marked on the top surface by means of die stamping, cast-in-mold lettering, etching, engraving, or an equally permanent method of marking."
