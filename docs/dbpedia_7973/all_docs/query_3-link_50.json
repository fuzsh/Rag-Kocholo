        "text": "Well over a century after our founding, National Geographic continues to reach and resonate with millions of people worldwide. How has our organization stood the test of time? We’ve stayed true to our original mission to pursue and celebrate exploration, scientific excellence, education, and unforgettable storytelling while simultaneously evolving with nimbleness and fortitude in a rapidly changing world. We embraced innovation and intentionally adapted, thoughtfully expanding our business model, global reach, and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. In doing so, we have remained a vibrant, relevant, world-class brand at the forefront of exploration and knowledge.\n\nNG Next celebrates our legendary legacy and takes the next step forward by charting a dynamic, five-year plan that strengthens our foundation, builds on our momentum, embeds diversity, equity, and inclusion into every aspect of our work, and sets a clear vision for the future to drive significant impact.\n\nOne of the powerful ways we build on our legacy and accelerate our impact work is through an innovative, sustainable business model. This joint-venture enterprise combines National Geographic’s global television channels, publications, media, and products and allows us to return a portion of the proceeds from these assets to fund our non-profit work.\n\nDisney is one of the most recognized brands in the world and shares our legacy of innovation, inspiration, and storytelling. With its business expertise, brand power, and global footprint, Disney has the unique ability to broadcast the Society’s mission to millions more people who are endlessly curious and share our passion for exploration."
