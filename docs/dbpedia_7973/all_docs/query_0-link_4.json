The constitution, drafted in 1787, established a federal system with a division of powers that has remained little changed since its inception.\n\nSome key dates in US history:\n\nc. 12000BC - First inhabitants of North America migrate from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge.\n\n11000BC - Emergence of the Clovis culture, believed to represent the first wave of human settlement of the Americas, thought to be the first of three major waves of migration into North America.\n\n9600-1000BC - Archaic period: Sees building of first complex earthwork mounds, such as at Monte Sano, Lower Mississippi Valley, and Watson Brake, Louisiana.\n\n1000BC-1000AD - Woodland period: The Adena and subsequent Hopewell cultures see monumental earthwork architecture and established continent-spanning trade and exchange networks.\n\n750-1350AD - Ancestral Puebloans (also known as the Anasazi) in southwest USA: characterised by grand pueblos and cliff-sited dwellings for defence, with a complex network of communities across the Colorado Plateau such as Mesa Verde and Chaco Canyon.\n\n900-1600AD - Mississippian culture: Characterised by a series of urban settlements in the midwest, east and southeast US, with large, earth platform mounds and satellite villages linked together by loose trading networks.
