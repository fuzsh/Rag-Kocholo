        "text": "\"Westward expansion\" redirects here. For trails in the American Old West, see Westward Expansion Trails.\n\nThe United States of America was formed after thirteen British colonies in North America declared independence from the British Empire on July 4, 1776. In the Lee Resolution, passed by the Second Continental Congress two days prior, the colonies resolved that they were free and independent states. The union was formalized in the Articles of Confederation, which came into force on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states. Their independence was recognized by Great Britain in the Treaty of Paris of 1783, which concluded the American Revolutionary War. This effectively doubled the size of the colonies, now able to stretch west past the Proclamation Line to the Mississippi River. This land was organized into territories and then states, though there remained some conflict with the sea-to-sea grants claimed by some of the original colonies. In time, these grants were ceded to the federal government.\n\nThe first great expansion of the country came with the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, which doubled the country's territory, although the southeastern border with Spanish Florida was the subject of much dispute until it and Spanish claims to the Oregon Country were ceded to the US in 1821. The Oregon Country gave the United States access to the Pacific Ocean, though it was shared for a time with the United Kingdom.[2] The annexation of the Republic of Texas in 1845 led directly to the Mexican–American War, after which the victorious United States obtained the northern half of Mexico's territory, including what was quickly made the state of California.[3]\n\nAs the development of the country moved west, however, the question of slavery became more important, with vigorous debate over whether the new territories would allow slavery and events such as the Missouri Compromise and Bleeding Kansas. This came to a head in 1860 and 1861, when the governments of the southern states proclaimed their secession from the country and formed the Confederate States of America. The American Civil War led to the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865 and the eventual readmission of the states to the United States Congress. The cultural endeavor and pursuit of manifest destiny provided a strong impetus for westward expansion in the 19th century.\n\nThe United States began expanding beyond North America in 1856 with the passage of the Guano Islands Act, causing many small and uninhabited, but economically important, islands in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean to be claimed.[4] Most of these claims were eventually abandoned, largely because of competing claims from other countries. The Pacific expansion culminated in the annexation of Hawaii in 1898, after the overthrow of its government five years previously. Alaska, the last major acquisition in North America, was purchased from Russia in 1867. Support for the independence of Cuba from the Spanish Empire, and the sinking of the USS Maine, led to the Spanish–American War in 1898, in which the United States gained Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, and occupied Cuba for several years. American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War.[5] The United States purchased the U.S. Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917.[6] Puerto Rico and Guam remain territories, and the Philippines became independent in 1946, after being a major theater of World War II.\n\nFollowing the war, many islands were entrusted to the U.S. by the United Nations,[7] and while the Northern Mariana Islands became a U.S. territory, the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau emerged from the trust territory as independent nations. The last major international change was the acquisition in 1904, and return to Panama in 1979, of the Panama Canal Zone, an unincorporated US territory which controlled the Panama Canal. The final cession of formal control over the region was made to Panama in 1999.\n\nStates have generally retained their initial borders once established. Only three states (Kentucky, Maine, and West Virginia) have been created directly from area belonging to another state (although at the time of admission, Vermont agreed to a monetary payment for New York to relinquish its claim); all of the other states were created from federal territories or from acquisitions. Four states (Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, and Pennsylvania) have expanded substantially by acquiring additional federal territory after their initial admission to the Union. In 1912, Arizona was the last state established in the contiguous United States, commonly called the \"lower 48\". In 1959, Hawaii was the 50th and most recent state admitted.\n\nLegend for maps\n\n[edit]\n\nKey to map colors\n\nUnited States states (domestic maps), undisputed area of United States (dispute maps)\n\nUnited States territories (domestic maps)\n\ndisputed area of United States\n\narea changed by event\n\n1776–1784 (American Revolution)\n\n[edit]\n\nDate Event Change Map July 4, 1776 Thirteen colonies of the Kingdom of Great Britain in North America collectively declared their independence as the United States of America,[a] though several colonies had already individually declared independence:[8]\n\nThe Colony of Connecticut, becoming the State of Connecticut[9]\n\nThe Counties of New Castle, Kent, and Sussex, upon Delaware, commonly known as the Lower Counties on Delaware, which was Delaware Colony before their declaration of independence on June 15, 1776[10][11]\n\nThe Province of Georgia, becoming the State of Georgia[12]\n\nThe Province of Maryland, becoming the State of Maryland[13]\n\nThe Province of Massachusetts Bay, becoming the State of Massachusetts Bay[14]\n\nThe State of New Hampshire, which was the Province of New Hampshire before their declaration of independence on June 15, 1776[15][16]\n\nThe Province of New Jersey, becoming the State of New Jersey[17]\n\nThe Province of New York, becoming the State of New York[18]\n\nThe Province of North Carolina, becoming the State of North Carolina;[19] some believe the colony declared independence on May 20, 1775, but this is disputed\n\nThe Province of Pennsylvania, becoming the State of Pennsylvania[20]\n\nThe State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, commonly known as Rhode Island, which was the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations before declaring independence on May 4, 1776[21][22]\n\nThe Province of South Carolina, becoming the State of South Carolina[23]\n\nThe Colony of Virginia, becoming the Commonwealth of Virginia[24]\n\nThe capital was not specifically established; at the time, the Continental Congress met in Philadelphia.[25][26]\n\nMany states had vaguely defined and surveyed borders; these are not noted as contested in the maps unless there was an active dispute. The borders of North Carolina were particularly poorly surveyed, its border with South Carolina having been done in several pieces, none of which truly matched the spirit of the charter,[27][28] and its border with Virginia was only surveyed roughly halfway inland from the sea.\n\nSeveral northeastern states had overlapping claims: Connecticut, Massachusetts Bay, and New York all claimed land west of their accepted borders, overlapping with each other and with a sizable claim by Virginia. Of the three, only Connecticut seriously pursued its claims, while Virginia is considered to have had the most legitimate claim to the vast northwest, dividing it into counties and maintaining some limited control.\n\nThe entirety of the new United States was claimed by Great Britain, including Machias Seal Island and North Rock, two small islands off the northeast coast which remain disputed up to the present.[29]\n\nDisputes:\n\nSeptember 20, 1776 The Counties of New Castle, Kent, and Sussex, upon Delaware enacted a constitution, renaming itself the Delaware State.[30] September 28, 1776 The State of Pennsylvania enacted a constitution, renaming itself the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.[31] no change to map December 20, 1776 To avoid British forces who were advancing on Philadelphia, the Continental Congress began meeting in Baltimore.[25][26] January 15, 1777 The northeastern region of New York, known as the New Hampshire Grants, declared independence as New Connecticut.[32][33][34] Disputes:\n\nMarch 4, 1777 The Continental Congress returned to Philadelphia after the threat to it by British forces ended.[25][26] June 4, 1777 New Connecticut was renamed Vermont.[34][32] Disputes:\n\nSeptember 27, 1777 The Continental Congress fled Philadelphia after the American defeat at the Battle of Brandywine, and briefly met in Lancaster, Pennsylvania[25][26] September 30, 1777 The Continental Congress continued to move away from Philadelphia, settling in York, Pennsylvania.[25][26] June 11, 1778 Vermont claimed what was called the \"East Union\", consisting of some towns in New Hampshire that petitioned on March 12, 1778, to join with Vermont, out of concern that their state was focusing too much on its coastal region. Vermont never gained full control over the area.[32][35][36][37][b] Disputes:\n\nOctober 21, 1778 Under pressure from the Continental Congress, Vermont rescinded the annexation of the East Union; the legislature declared on February 12, 1779, that the East Union should be considered null from its beginning.[35][36][37] Disputes:\n\nJuly 2, 1779 The Continental Congress returned to Philadelphia following British withdrawal.[25][26] August 31, 1779 Virginia surrendered its claim to southwest Pennsylvania.[20][38] March 1780 North Carolina and Virginia surveyed their border further inland. Virginia's survey reached to the Tennessee River, but North Carolina's only went as far as the Cumberland Gap, and as the two surveys were roughly two miles apart, this created a thin area claimed by both states. While the border was intended to follow 36°30′ north, early surveying errors caused it to veer north of that, reaching a distance of almost ten miles off by the time it reached the Tennessee River.[39][24] October 25, 1780 The State of Massachusetts Bay enacted a constitution, renaming itself the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. March 1, 1781 The Articles of Confederation entered into force.[40] no change to map April 4, 1781 Vermont again claimed an East Union, consisting of some towns in New Hampshire that wished to join with Vermont; more towns were interested than during the first attempt in 1778, though again, the exact extent of the borders is unknown. Vermont never gained full control over the area.[32][41][36][37][c] Disputes:\n\nJune 16, 1781 Vermont claimed what was called the \"West Union\", consisting of some towns in New York, mainly to counterbalance Vermont's attempt at eastward expansion. Vermont never gained full control over the area.[32][36][42][43] The specific date this occurred is unclear; sources suggest June 16, June 26, and July 18.[d] Disputes:\n\nFebruary 22, 1782 Vermont abandoned its attempts to annex the East Union from New Hampshire and the West Union from New York.[32][37][43][44] Disputes:\n\nOctober 29, 1782 The federal government accepted the cession from New York of its western claims, which the state ceded on February 19, 1780, and executed on March 1, 1781; New York proclaimed its new western border to be a line drawn south from the western end of Lake Ontario. At its maximum interpretation, the state had claimed an area bounded by Lake Erie, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan; to the Illinois, Mississippi, and Tennessee Rivers; and north along the Appalachian Mountains, ending at the border with Pennsylvania.[45] It is unclear from where this claim came; many sources state that New York had surrendered it, but very few elaborate on how it was obtained. One source states that it was a cession by the Six Nations, who had conquered much of the region.[46] However, New York never seriously enforced these claims. The cession included the small tip of New York north of Pennsylvania, which came to be known as the Erie Triangle.[47][18] December 30, 1782 The Congress of the Confederation declared that the land that Connecticut claimed in northern Pennsylvania was part of Pennsylvania, thus attempting to end the Pennamite–Yankee War.[48][20] The claim was an extension of Connecticut's northernmost and southernmost borders westward, skipping New Jersey and New York, though as Connecticut's northern border was a few miles north of Pennsylvania's northern border, a small sliver of New York was also claimed. While conflict would continue for some time, this was the end of the formal claim by Connecticut. June 30, 1783 The Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, and the Pennsylvania government reaction to it, caused the Congress of the Confederation to leave Philadelphia for Princeton.[25] November 26, 1783 The Congress of the Confederation reconvened in Annapolis.[25] March 1, 1784 Virginia ceded its claims northwest of the Ohio River to the federal government.[49][24] Connecticut continued to claim its western lands that had overlapped with Virginia's cession. May 12, 1784 Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States, ending its claim to the country.[50][51][e] The treaty ended the American Revolutionary War, though military action had largely ended after the Franco-American victory at Yorktown on October 19, 1781.\n\nBecause of ambiguities and poor knowledge of geography, the treaty was unclear in several areas:\n\nThe northeastern border was defined as running from the headlands of the St. Croix River, but there were several options for that.\n\nThe northwestern border was defined as a line running west from the northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods to the Mississippi River, but the river's source was south of that; maps universally show the line as running directly from the Lake of the Woods to the river's source, Lake Itasca.\n\nThe border extending from Lake Superior towards the Lake of the Woods was poorly defined as starting from \"Long Lake\", which both sides interpreted to their advantage.\n\nMachias Seal Island and North Rock off the northeast coast remained disputed, as did Sugar Island off the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nThe Peace of Paris also involved treaties with France and Spain, with Great Britain ceding the Floridas to Spain. During their ownership of West Florida, the British had moved its border north, and the cession to Spain appeared to apply to the full extent of the British colony. However, the British-American treaty granted the extension of West Florida to the United States, where it enlarged Georgia south to 31° north, indicating that only the original definition of West Florida was to be ceded to Spain. The local Spanish governors also made a move to occupy forts along the Mississippi River, with claims to everything south of the Tennessee River; it is unknown how official or strong these claims were, and they are not mapped as they are in conflict with the other Spanish claim involving the border of West Florida.[52]\n\nDisputes:\n\n1784–1803 (Organization of territory)\n\n[edit]\n\nDate Event Change Map August 23, 1784 A region in central North Carolina (modern-day eastern Tennessee), unhappy with the state's governance over the area, declared independence from the state as the State of Frankland.[f][53] The government of Frankland held some control over the area, and petitioned for statehood, receiving support from seven of the nine states required, but would only last a few years.[54][55] Unofficial change:\n\nNovember 1, 1784 The Congress of the Confederation moved for a short time to Trenton.[25] January 11, 1785 The Congress of the Confederation moved to New York, and would settle there for five years.[25] April 19, 1785 The federal government accepted the cession from Massachusetts of its extreme western claim, which was never seriously enforced.[g][45][14] Change on paper only:\n\nJune 1785 The State of Frankland was renamed the State of Franklin, to encourage Benjamin Franklin to endorse the state, though he declined.[54] Unofficial change:\n\nSeptember 13, 1786 Connecticut surrendered its western claim to the federal government except for its Western Reserve, though it is unclear how much control they held over the ceded region.[h][9][56] Change on paper only:\n\nDecember 16, 1786 Massachusetts surrendered its claim to western New York, though it is unclear if Massachusetts ever held control over the region, as the claim was to the \"soil, not the sovereignty\".[i][45][14] This land was later known as the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. Change on paper only:\n\nJuly 13, 1787 The Territory Northwest of the River Ohio, ceded earlier by Virginia, was organized and commonly became known as the Northwest Territory.[57][58] August 9, 1787 South Carolina ceded its western claim to the federal government,[59][23] though it was a result of inaccurate geography and South Carolina never actually held claim to this land. The claim was of a strip of land between the border of North Carolina and the source of the Tugaloo River but, unknown at the time, the river originated in North Carolina. The eastern part of this cession would be given to Georgia in 1802, despite Georgia technically already having claim to the land.[60] Change on paper only:\n\nDecember 7, 1787 Delaware became the first state to ratify the United States Constitution.[61] no change to map December 12, 1787 Pennsylvania became the second state to ratify the Constitution.[62] December 18, 1787 New Jersey became the third state to ratify the Constitution.[63] January 2, 1788 Georgia became the fourth state to ratify the Constitution.[64] January 9, 1788 Connecticut became the fifth state to ratify the Constitution.[65] February 6, 1788 Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify the Constitution.[66] April 28, 1788 Maryland became the seventh state to ratify the Constitution.[67] May 23, 1788 South Carolina became the eighth state to ratify the Constitution.[68] June 21, 1788 New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the Constitution;[69] at this point, the Constitution became the active governing document of those nine states having ratified the same (per Article VII). June 25, 1788 Virginia became the tenth state to ratify the Constitution.[70] July 26, 1788 New York became the eleventh state to ratify the Constitution.[71] February 1789 John Sevier, governor of the State of Franklin, pledged allegiance to North Carolina, effectively ending the claimed independence of Franklin.[54][72] Unofficial change:\n\nAugust 7, 1789 The Northwest Territory was reorganized under the Constitution.[73] no change to map November 21, 1789 North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the Constitution.[74] April 2, 1790 North Carolina ceded its western half to the federal government.[j][75][55] May 26, 1790 The land recently ceded by North Carolina was organized as the Territory South of the River Ohio, commonly known as the Southwest Territory.[55][76] May 29, 1790 Rhode Island became the thirteenth state to ratify the Constitution.[77] no change to map December 6, 1790 Per the Residence Act, the Congress of the United States relocated to Philadelphia for ten years until a federal district was built and ready.[25][26][78] March 4, 1791 Vermont, which had been considered part of New York despite acting independently since 1777, was admitted as the fourteenth state.[k][32][79]\n\nDisputes:\n\nMarch 30, 1791 The District of Columbia, a federal district planned to house the federal government by 1800, was formed from land ceded by Maryland and Virginia,[80][81] consisting of a 100 square mile diamond, with its southern tip at Jones Point, straddling the Potomac River. However, it was not yet given that name, being simply referred to as the federal district. In September 1791, the commissioners in charge of planning the city would term it the \"Territory of Columbia\", and various laws refer to a District of Columbia, but sometimes informally. The area does not appear to have been formally named \"District of Columbia\" until at least the organic act of 1871.[82] Since the name \"Columbia\" was used from very early on, and at least informally by the government, the map will use \"District of Columbia\" starting from this date. March 3, 1792 Pennsylvania purchased the Erie Triangle from the federal government.[20] June 1, 1792 The western half of Virginia, which the state had agreed in 1789 to cede to the federal government,[83] was admitted as the fifteenth state, Kentucky.[l][85][84] June 12, 1792 The Delaware State enacted a new constitution, renaming itself the State of Delaware.[86] no change to map August 3, 1795 Representatives of the United States and the Western Confederacy sign the Treaty of Greenville, ending the Northwest Indian War and ceding most of the modern state of Ohio to United States control.[87] February 29, 1796 Great Britain agreed to abandon several forts in the northwest that it still occupied, including Detroit. The Jay Treaty also provided for commissions to determine the border between the northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods and the source of the Mississippi River, and which river to consider the St. Croix River.[88] April 25, 1796 The northern half of West Florida was ceded by Spain, resolving the dispute over the region.[89][90] Disputes:\n\nJune 1, 1796 The Southwest Territory was admitted as the sixteenth state, Tennessee.[55][91] April 7, 1798 In response to the Yazoo Land Fraud, an act authorized President John Adams to appoint commissioners to negotiate with Georgia about ceding its western land. The act created Mississippi Territory from the southwestern quarter of Georgia in the region recently ceded by West Florida, while maintaining that Georgia still held rights over the territory.[92][93] October 25, 1798 Commissioners agreed on the source of the St. Croix River, setting the lower portion of the border between Massachusetts and Great Britain and, thus, where the eastern north–south line originated.[94]\n\nDisputes:\n\nJune 9, 1800 Connecticut ceded its Western Reserve to the federal government, which assigned it to the Northwest Territory.[95] The act doing so was passed in Congress on April 28, 1800, and Connecticut approved it on this date.[96] July 4, 1800 Indiana Territory was organized from the western half of Northwest Territory.[m][98][97] November 17, 1800 The Congress of the United States moved to Washington in the District of Columbia, now built and ready to be the capital.[25] This was two weeks before the December 1 date established in the Residence Act; President John Adams urged Congress to move early in hopes of securing enough Southern votes to be re-elected, though this failed.[99] January 1, 1801 The Kingdom of Great Britain united with the Kingdom of Ireland, renaming itself the United Kingdom.[100] Disputes:\n\nFebruary 27, 1801 The District of Columbia was organized.[81][101] no change to map April 26, 1802 Georgia ceded its western half, known as the Yazoo Lands, to the federal government.[n] At the same time, the federal government ceded to Georgia the eastern portion of the land previously ceded by South Carolina, though in reality Georgia technically already held title to the land, as the description of the earlier cession was based on an erroneous understanding of geography.[12] March 1, 1803 The southern half of the Northwest Territory, along with a thin sliver of Indiana Territory, was admitted as the seventeenth state, Ohio. The remainder of the Northwest Territory was transferred to Indiana Territory.[102][57] The western border was a line due north from the mouth of the Great Miami River; the federal definition of the northern border was a line drawn east from the southern tip of Lake Michigan, whereas the Ohio Constitution stated the line should run from the southern tip of Lake Michigan to the most northerly cape of Maumee Bay, essentially the western tip of Lake Erie. The confusion caused by these varying descriptions of the state's borders, combined with inaccurate knowledge of geography, as no one at the time knew just how far south Lake Michigan extended, would lead to the conflict over the Toledo Strip. November 3, 1803 The border between Tennessee and Virginia was resurveyed and established, ending the dispute over that part of the border. The border between Kentucky and Tennessee, despite following the original survey, remained vaguely defined.[39][103] November 30, 1803 The \"Southwick Jog\" was transferred from Connecticut to Massachusetts, to put to rest long-standing disagreements over the border between the two states.[14] The final report of the commissioners was delivered this day;[104] it is unclear when the change formally occurred.\n\n1803–1818 (Purchase of Louisiana)\n\n[edit]\n\nDate Event Change Map December 20, 1803 The United States purchased Louisiana from France. This is the date of the formal turnover in New Orleans; the purchase was completed on April 30, 1803.[105] The transfer would be recognized in St. Louis in Upper Louisiana on March 10, 1804, known as Three Flags Day.\n\nThe acquisition expanded the United States to the whole of the Mississippi River basin,[o] but the extent of what constituted Louisiana in the south was disputed with Spain: the United States claimed the purchase included the part of West Florida west of the Perdido River, whereas Spain claimed it ended at the western border of West Florida;[p][106] and the southwestern border with New Spain was disputed, as the United States claimed the Sabine River as the border, but Spain maintained it was the Calcasieu River and others.[105]\n\nDisputes:\n\nMarch 27, 1804 The land between Tennessee and Mississippi Territory previously ceded by Georgia was assigned to Mississippi Territory.[93][107] October 1, 1804 Orleans Territory was organized from the Louisiana Purchase south of 33° north, with the remainder being designated the District of Louisiana and placed under the jurisdiction of Indiana Territory.[108][109] June 30, 1805 Michigan Territory was organized from Indiana Territory, north of a line east from the southern tip of Lake Michigan, and east of a line north from the lake's northern tip.[110][111] The southeastern portion of the border technically conflicted with the definition of Ohio, which claimed the Toledo Strip north of that line; however, the exact position of Lake Michigan was not yet known. July 4, 1805 The District of Louisiana was organized as Louisiana Territory.[109][112] March 1, 1809 Illinois Territory was organized from the western half of Indiana Territory.[q][114][113] September 26, 1810 The Republic of West Florida declared independence from Spain, claiming the area of West Florida west of the Perdido River. It maintained some control over its territory.[115] Disputes:\n\nDecember 10, 1810 Armed forces led by William C. C. Claiborne took possession of the portion of West Florida west of the Pearl River, following a proclamation on October 27, 1810, by President James Madison to do so. The United States had considered the region part of the Louisiana Purchase, including the area which had revolted against Spanish Florida and formed the Republic of West Florida. Madison's proclamation stated that it was to be \"taken as part\" of Orleans Territory.[106][105][116] The land west of Mobile Bay to the Pearl River was occupied and annexed de facto by the military in 1811.[117]: 2a (map) Disputes:\n\nApril 30, 1812 Most of Orleans Territory was admitted as the eighteenth state, Louisiana.[r][109][118] The southeastern remainder presumably became unorganized territory, as it had no definition for a short time. May 14, 1812 The claimed portion of West Florida east of the Pearl River was assigned to Mississippi Territory, though the area around Mobile Bay remained under the control of Spanish Florida.[93][119] The United States militarily occupied Mobile and the surrounding area up to the Perdido River in April 1813. June 4, 1812 Since its name was now shared with the state of Louisiana, Louisiana Territory was renamed Missouri Territory.[120][121] August 4, 1812 The remaining claimed portion of West Florida, west of the Pearl River, was added to Louisiana, following the assent of that state to an act passed by Congress on April 14, 1812.[122][123] August 16, 1812 During the War of 1812, the garrison at Fort Detroit surrendered, leading the United Kingdom to occupy Detroit, the capital and population center of Michigan Territory.[124] Disputes:\n\nSeptember 29, 1813 The British withdrew from Fort Detroit following the Battle of Lake Erie, allowing American forces to regain control over Michigan Territory.[124][125] Disputes:\n\nAugust 24, 1814 British forces capture and burn Washington, but are forced to withdraw the next day. The functions of the capital were only momentarily suspended, though President James Madison took refuge in Brookville, Maryland.[126] no change to map December 11, 1816 The southern part of Indiana Territory, along with small parts of Illinois Territory and Michigan Territory, were admitted as the nineteenth state, Indiana.[s] The remainder of Indiana Territory across Lake Michigan became unorganized territory.[97][127] March 3, 1817 Alabama Territory was organized from the eastern half of Mississippi Territory.[t][129][128] December 10, 1817 Mississippi Territory was admitted as the twentieth state, Mississippi.[93][130] February 6, 1818 Alabama Territory created Tuskaloosa County with a description that inadvertently overlapped with Mississippi. It described the border of the county as running \"a due west course to, the Tombeckbe river; thence up the same to the Cotton Gin Port\".[131] Unknown at the time, the origin of the Tombigbee River and Cotton Gin Port were in Mississippi. Change on paper only:\n\nJune 30, 1818 Per the terms of the Treaty of Ghent ending the War of 1812, the United Kingdom returned Moose Island to Massachusetts, and the United States returned Campobello Island, Deer Island, and Grand Manan Island to the United Kingdom, all of which were captured from the other side during the war.[132] no change to map December 3, 1818 The half of Illinois Territory south of 42°30′ north was admitted as the twenty-first state, Illinois. The remainder of the territory, along with the unorganized territory that was recently part of Indiana Territory, was assigned to Michigan Territory.[113][133]\n\n1819–1845 (Northwest expansion)\n\n[edit]\n\nDate Event Change Map January 30, 1819 The Treaty of 1818 went into effect, setting 49° north as the border with the United Kingdom west of the Lake of the Woods, and also establishing the Oregon Country as a shared region with the United Kingdom.[2][134][135] Oregon Country had no defined northern limit, but it can be assumed that it did not encroach much upon Russian-held lands; this map uses the later-established line at 54°40′ north for simplicity.\n\nNorthwestern North America:\n\nJuly 4, 1819 Arkansaw Territory was organized from the southern slice of Missouri Territory.[u][136][137] December 14, 1819 Alabama Territory was admitted as the twenty-second state, Alabama.[128][138] The statehood act provided for a survey of the southern part of the border with Mississippi, which was intended to be north–south, for adjustment if it was discovered to encroach upon Mississippi's established counties; it was later discovered to do so. March 15, 1820 As part of the Missouri Compromise, the District of Maine, the northern and separate part of Massachusetts, was admitted as the twenty-third state, Maine.[139][140] April 21, 1820 This is the earliest known date of the name \"Arkansas Territory\" being officially used instead of \"Arkansaw Territory\".[141] May 12, 1820 The border between Kentucky and Tennessee was established. To make up for the fact that the border between the Cumberland Gap and the Tennessee River veered north as much as almost 10 miles from 36°30′ north, a new survey was conducted starting at that latitude on the Mississippi River and moving east to the Tennessee River, hence guaranteeing this last bit of border would fit the original ideal.[39] July 19, 1820 The overlap of the longitudinal southern border between Alabama and Mississippi was resolved, as per the act admitting Alabama as a state, because the provisional border encroached on Mississippi.[128][142] As the result of a survey, the southern border terminus was moved about 3.8 miles to the east, which changed the border up to the then-northwest corner of Alabama's Washington County. The date when this happened is unclear; the sources available give either an unpublished report dated May 29, 1820, or the completion of the demarcation of the new line on July 19, 1820. Change on paper only:\n\nDecember 19, 1820 Alabama redefined some county borders, ending its erroneous overlap of Mississippi created on February 6, 1818.[143] Change on paper only:\n\nFebruary 22, 1821 The Adams–Onís Treaty with Spain took effect.[106] The many changes included:\n\nThe border with the holdings of Spain was concretely defined; previously, it had been the watershed of the Mississippi River and, for Oregon Country, the Columbia River, whereas now it followed specific rivers and parallels.[v]\n\nThe new border placed the \"Neutral Ground\" in Louisiana.\n\nFlorida was ceded to the United States, although the formal transfer would not happen until July.\n\nArkansas Territory had created Miller County south of the Red River, and this area was now on the Spanish side of the border. However, as this was a change made solely by the territory, and not by the federal government, in this map it is considered a domestic dispute.\n\nWith Spanish West Florida being ceded, the dispute between it and Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi was resolved.\n\nDisputes:\n\nJuly 10, 1821 East Florida was formally transferred to the United States by Spain.[144] July 17, 1821 West Florida was formally transferred to the United States by Spain.[144] August 10, 1821 The southeastern corner of Missouri Territory was admitted as the twenty-fourth state, Missouri, the rest becoming unorganized territory.[w][121][145] March 30, 1822 The former East Florida and West Florida were organized as Florida Territory.[146][147] May 26, 1824 The half of Arkansas Territory west of a line south from a point 40 miles west of Missouri's western border was returned to unorganized territory.[137][148] January 12, 1825 A treaty with the Russian Empire established 54°40′ north as the northern border of Oregon Country for American purposes; a separate treaty created the same border between Russia and the United Kingdom.[149] As this was likely the de facto border anyway, the region is already mapped with this line. no change to map May 6, 1828 A treaty with the Cherokee moved the western border of Arkansas Territory, returning part of it to unorganized territory.[x][137][151] January 20, 1831 King William I of the Netherlands, having been asked per the Treaty of Ghent to arbitrate the disputed border between Maine and the United Kingdom, rendered his decision: since reconciling the treaty with the maps given was too difficult, he drew a compromise line. The British government accepted it, but Maine protested, and on January 19, 1832, the American government rejected it.[152] no change to map July 9, 1832 The region of New Hampshire north of the Connecticut Lakes, which was disputed with the United Kingdom, declared independence as the Republic of Indian Stream.[153] While tiny, it does appear to have maintained some control over its territory. Disputes:\n\nJune 28, 1834 Michigan Territory gained a large parcel of land from unorganized territory, extending west to the Missouri River and White Earth River.[111][154] August 5, 1835 The Republic of Indian Stream recognized the jurisdiction of New Hampshire, thus ending its claimed independence. The date given is of a communication sent to British authorities;[155] other sources note a resolution passed by the citizens of Indian Stream on April 2, 1836.[153] Disputes:\n\nJune 15, 1836 Arkansas Territory was admitted as the twenty-fifth state, Arkansas.[137][156] July 3, 1836 Wisconsin Territory was organized from the western bulk of Michigan Territory.[y][157][158] The two large peninsulas between the Great Lakes remained in Michigan Territory; the upper peninsula was included in exchange for the territory abandoning its claim to the Toledo Strip. The territory initially rejected this plan, but would accept it on December 14. December 14, 1836 Michigan Territory agreed to abandon its claim to the Toledo Strip, ending its dispute with Ohio.[159] January 26, 1837 Michigan Territory was admitted as the twenty-sixth state, Michigan.[111][160] March 28, 1837 The Platte Purchase, obtained from several nations including the Potawatomi, Ioway, Missouria, Otoe, and Sac and Fox,[161] transferred some land from unorganized territory to northwest Missouri, extending its northern border west to the Missouri River.[121][162] July 3, 1838 Iowa Territory was organized from Wisconsin Territory west of the Mississippi River.[163][164] February 11, 1839 Missouri claimed an area north of its border with Iowa Territory, initiating the long dispute known as the Honey War.[165] May 21, 1840 Surveying conducted along the border with Texas concluded that the area claimed by Arkansas for Miller County belonged to Texas.[166] November 10, 1842 The Webster–Ashburton Treaty defined the border with the United Kingdom east of the Rocky Mountains.[167][168] One source also mentions it very slightly altering the maritime boundary between Michigan and Wisconsin Territory.[169] The treaty resolved the disputes over the northern borders of Maine and New Hampshire,[z] the northeastern border of Wisconsin Territory,[aa] and Sugar Island with Michigan.\n\nThe border between New York and Vermont on the one side, and the United Kingdom on the other, was clarified by the treaty. In 1816, construction began on an unnamed fort nicknamed \"Fort Blunder\" on a peninsula in Lake Champlain that, while south of the surveyed border, was discovered to be north of 45° north, which was the border set by the Treaty of Paris and thus in British territory. Consequently, construction on the fort was abandoned. The Webster–Ashburton Treaty specified that section of the border was to follow the surveyed line, rather than the exact parallel, thus moving the fort's area into the United States, and a new fort, Fort Montgomery, would be built on the spot in 1844.[171] As the earlier line was surveyed, even though it did not match the definition, it was deemed to be the legitimate border.\n\nDisputes:\n\nJuly 5, 1843 Local settlers created a provisional government for Oregon Country. While not official, it did maintain some jurisdiction over the area.[172] Unofficial change: March 3, 1845 Florida Territory was admitted as the twenty-seventh state, Florida.[147][173]\n\n1845–1860 (Southwest expansion)\n\n[edit]\n\nDate Event Change Map December 29, 1845 The Republic of Texas was annexed and admitted as the twenty-eighth state, Texas, extending the United States southwest to the Rio Grande.[174][175] All of Texas was claimed by Mexico. While many sources state that Mexico recognized the independence of the eastern portion of Texas, the treaties were rejected by the Mexican government. Texas formally handed over sovereignty to the United States in a ceremony on February 19, 1846.[176] The annexation led to the beginning of the Mexican–American War a few months later.[176]\n\nDisputes:\n\nJune 15, 1846 The Oregon Treaty established 49° north west of the Lake of the Woods as the continental border (so it did not include Vancouver Island) with land held by the United Kingdom. The sharing of Oregon Country ended, and the United States portion became unorganized territory.[177]\n\nThe treaty was vague on which strait should be the border between Vancouver Island and the continent, thus causing a dispute over ownership of the San Juan Islands.[178] It specified \"through the middle of the said channel and of Fuca Straits, to the Pacific Ocean\".\n\nNorthwestern North America:\n\nDisputes:\n\nSeptember 22, 1846 Following the capture on August 18, 1846, of Santa Fe, the capital of the Mexican territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo México,[179] a code of laws known as the Kearny Code was created for the area.[180][181] The region overlapped with Texas' claim, though Texas had little to no control over the area outside of its eastern quarter. Unofficial change:\n\nDecember 28, 1846 The portion of Iowa Territory south of 43°30′ north and east of the Big Sioux River was admitted as the twenty-ninth state, Iowa. The remainder became unorganized territory.[164][182] March 13, 1847 The District of Columbia retroceded Alexandria County back to Virginia.[81] Congress passed the act on July 9, 1846,[183] residents of Alexandria County were proclaimed by the president to have agreed to it on September 7, 1846,[184] and Virginia took possession of the land on this date.[185] May 29, 1848 The southern bulk of Wisconsin Territory was admitted as the thirtieth state, Wisconsin.[ab] The remainder became unorganized territory.[158][186] However, the citizens of the remainder decided to continue on with a civil government, and even elected a delegate to the United States House of Representatives who would be seated on January 15, 1849, essentially making this region a de facto continuation of Wisconsin Territory.[187] July 4, 1848 The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican–American War and ceded a large parcel of land from Mexico, consisting of its territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México, and its claim to Texas.[ac][189] A border dispute began over a disagreement about the southern border of Santa Fe de Nuevo México.[188]\n\nDisputes:\n\nAugust 14, 1848 Oregon Territory was organized from the unorganized territory that was formerly part of Oregon Country.[190][191] February 13, 1849 The boundary dispute between Iowa and Missouri known as the Honey War was resolved by the Supreme Court of the United States. The resulting border was the Sullivan Line that existed before the dispute, roughly splitting the two claims.[192] March 3, 1849 Minnesota Territory was organized from the region that had been operating as de facto Wisconsin Territory, and unorganized territory east of the Missouri and White Earth Rivers.[193][170] March 12, 1849 A local government formed the State of Deseret and claimed a vast portion of the southwest, including most of the Mexican Cession. Though it petitioned to be admitted to the United States, the proposal was rejected and, in 1850, Utah Territory was formed instead.[194] The claimed area overlapped slightly with Texas' claimed area, as well as part of Oregon Territory. Unofficial change:\n\nNovember 24, 1849 Texas, with consent from the United States Congress,[195] extended its border with Louisiana from the west bank of the Sabine River to the middle of the river.[195][196][197][198] no change to map September 9, 1850 The western portion of the Mexican Cession was admitted as the thirty-first state, California.[ad][3][199] The portion of the remainder north of 37° north and west of the summit of the Rocky Mountains was organized as Utah Territory.[200][201] Part of Utah Territory overlapped with the portion of Texas that would be purchased on December 13, 1850, but the law authorizing the purchase was passed on this day, so the borders of Utah Territory assumed that the purchase would go through. December 9, 1850 The United Kingdom ceded less than one acre of underwater rock for a lighthouse in Lake Erie near Buffalo, New York; although it was on Middle Reef, it was named for the nearby Horseshoe Reef.[202] It was surrounded by British waters, thus creating a form of enclave.[203] December 13, 1850 The federal government purchased the western claims of Texas.[ae][175] New Mexico Territory was organized from the part of this land east of the Rio Grande, along with the remaining unorganized territory from the Mexican Cession.[af][205][204] New Mexico Territory included all of the area that had been governed under the Kearny Code.

This became known as the Public Land Strip, or sometimes \"No Man's Land\".[212]\n\nJune 30, 1854 The United States purchased a large parcel from Mexico known as the Gadsden Purchase, as it offered a much better route for a southern transcontinental railroad.[ag][213][214] This resolved the border dispute, since the disputed land was included in the purchase.[188]\n\nDisputes:\n\nAugust 4, 1854 The recently obtained Gadsden Purchase was assigned to New Mexico Territory.[204][215] January 11, 1855 Boston Corner was transferred from Massachusetts to New York because it was inaccessible from the rest of the Massachusetts.[216][217][218] March 6, 1855 The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Florida in a boundary dispute with Georgia, setting the state boundary line along McNeil's line.[219] no change to map October 28, 1856 Baker Island and Jarvis Island were claimed under the Guano Islands Act.[4] Pacific Ocean:\n\nMay 11, 1858 The eastern half of Minnesota Territory was admitted as the thirty-second state, Minnesota.[ah] The remainder became unorganized territory.[170][220] August 31, 1858 Navassa Island was claimed under the Guano Islands Act.[4] Caribbean Sea:\n\nDecember 3, 1858 Howland Island was claimed under the Guano Islands Act.[4] Pacific Ocean:\n\nFebruary 14, 1859 The western half of Oregon Territory was admitted as the thirty-third state, Oregon.[ai] The remainder was transferred to Washington Territory.[191][221] July 6, 1859 A team of surveyors created the \"Middleton Offset\", a small notch in the border between Kentucky and Tennessee.

Among the changes this caused were: a slice of Canal Zone was ceded to Panama so Panama City would be connected with the rest of the country; the middle island of the Las Tres Hermanas Islands, which marked the border of Panama City's harbor, was wholly made part of Canal Zone; Gatun Lake and other surrounding waters were formally annexed to the territory; and an area of northwest Colón was ceded to Canal Zone.[360][361][362] Caribbean Sea:\n\nMay 27, 1915 Under Article II of the 1903 Treaty, the United States expropriated from Panama several areas around the mouth of the Rio Chagres, annexing them to the Panama Canal Zone.[363] too small to map December 8, 1915 The United States expropriated from Panama a triangle of land, which included the historic Fort San Lorenzo, between the Rio Chagres, Caribbean Sea and the Panama Canal Zone, to which it was annexed.[363] January 17, 1916 Navassa Island was formally claimed for lighthouse purposes.[364] no change to map August 29, 1916 The Philippines were reorganized to provide more autonomous government.[365] March 31, 1917 The Danish Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark[366] and renamed the United States Virgin Islands.[367] Caribbean Sea:\n\nJuly 12, 1918 The United States expropriated from Panama 2.6 hectares of land at Punta Paitilla in Panama City and annexed it to the Panama Canal Zone.[368] That area was enlarged to about 50 hectares within several months.[363][369][370][371] too small to map August 21, 1918 The United States expropriated from Panama land between the Rio Chagres and the Quebrada Majagual and annexed it to the Panama Canal Zone.[363][371] Caribbean Sea:\n\nSeptember 13, 1918 Minnesota and Wisconsin exchanged islands in the Mississippi River: Island Seventytwo was transferred to Winona, Minnesota, and Barron's Island was transferred to La Crosse, Wisconsin.[158][372] September 18, 1919 The island of Largo Remo was annexed to the Panama Canal Zone under the United States right of expropriation in the 1903 Canal Treaty.[373] Caribbean Sea:\n\nJune 16, 1920 Fifteen hectares on the island of Taboga Island were annexed to the Panama Canal Zone.[374] too small to map June 30, 1921 The \"Wedge\" dispute between Delaware and Pennsylvania was resolved in Delaware's favor. The disputed land had generally been administered by Delaware, even electing a member of the Delaware legislature in the mid-19th century,[375] but federal maps had included the land as part of Pennsylvania at least as late as 1900.[376] The states had agreed on a resolution, and it was affirmed by an act of Congress on this date.[377][378] Some sources, both contemporary and modern, note that, in the original process of resurveying the border in 1892, a very thin, horn-shaped region along the arc was transferred from Delaware to Pennsylvania;[375][378][379] however, no federal maps found reflect this, and it is unclear if this transfer actually occurred. May 10, 1922 Kingman Reef was formally annexed.[380] no change to map October 8, 1923 Michigan expanded its claim to Wisconsin territory, though Wisconsin never lost control over the area.[348] November 15, 1923 The Swan Islands were claimed by Honduras.[381] Caribbean Sea:\n\nFebruary 1, 1924 The future area for Madden Lake was annexed to the Panama Canal Zone under the United States right of expropriation in the 1903 Canal Treaty.[339][382][383] Caribbean Sea:\n\nMarch 4, 1925 Swains Island was added to American Samoa.[384] Pacific Ocean:\n\nJuly 17, 1925 The border with Canada was adjusted in several places.[385][386] The only change to a land border redefined how the border between the Lake of the Woods and the Rocky Mountains should be considered; previously, the border followed the curve of the parallel between each border monument, while the treaty changed this to straight lines between each monument. Through this, the United States netted a gain of between 30 and 35 acres of land. Because of the extremely small shift, the lack of specific documentation of where the changes occurred, and the lack of any human impact, this change is not mapped. There was also a change to the border in the Lake of the Woods; a surveying anomaly caused the previous border to intersect itself several times in the lake, creating enclaves of United States water surrounded by Canadian water. The treaty changed the border to use the southernmost intersection as the northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods. Finally, the maritime border in the Bay of Fundy was adjusted, netting Canada roughly 9 acres of water. too small to map March 1, 1926 The Supreme Court of the United States resolved the conflict between Michigan and Wisconsin in the favor of Wisconsin.[348] July 29, 1926 Johnston Atoll was established as a federal bird refuge and placed under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Agriculture.[387] The atoll had originally been claimed by both the United States and Hawaii in 1858, but little activity apart from guano mining had taken place, and it had been largely abandoned for decades.[224] no change to map November 22, 1926 The Supreme Court of the United States defined the border between Michigan and Wisconsin, transferring all islands south of the Quinnesec Falls on the Menominee River to Wisconsin, and all islands north of the falls to Michigan; it is unknown specifically which islands were transferred in this fashion. However, an error in the border description introduced a small overlap between the two states over several islands in Lake Michigan north of the Door Peninsula.[388] July 18, 1927 The United States expropriated from Panama another 33 hectares of land on the islands of Taboga and Taboguilla and annexed them to the Panama Canal Zone.[363] too small to map October 26, 1927 Two bancos along the Colorado River were ceded from Mexico to Arizona.[389][390] December 5, 1927 The \"Country Club Dispute\" between New Mexico and Texas was resolved in Texas's favor.[391] April 4, 1928 The Island of Palmas Case was decided in the favor of the Netherlands, ceding Palmas to the Dutch East Indies.[321] Pacific Ocean:\n\nSeptember 24, 1928 The United States expropriated from Panama three hectares of land at El Cerro de Doscientos Pies (\"200-Foot Hill\") near Las Minas Bay and annexed it to the Panama Canal Zone.[363][371] too small to map July 22, 1930 The United States expropriated from Panama 25 hectares on Jicarita Island and 60 hectares at Punta Morro de Puercos and annexed them to the Panama Canal Zone.[363] April 15, 1931 The United States expropriated from Panama additional areas around the soon-to-be-built Madden Dam and annexed them to the Panama Canal Zone.[363][371] Caribbean Sea:\n\nMay 3, 1932 The United States adjusted the border at Punta Paitilla in the Canal Zone, returning a small amount of land to Panama. This was the site for a planned new American embassy, which had to be built on foreign soil.[392] too small to map May 17, 1932 Porto Rico was renamed Puerto Rico.[393] Caribbean Sea:\n\nDecember 13, 1932 The Mangsee Islands and seven of the Turtle Islands were ceded by the United Kingdom from North Borneo to the Philippines. The islands were supposed to be included in the 1900 transfer of islands from Spain to the United States. Per the terms of the treaty, the United Kingdom continued to administer the islands until requested, and, after the Philippines' independence, the Philippine government made such a request and took control.[394] Pacific Ocean:\n\nMay 29, 1933 The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the border between New Hampshire and Vermont was the low water mark of the west bank of the Connecticut River; Vermont had sought to have the border placed in the middle of the river.[44] no change to map November 13, 1933 A treaty created the Rio Grande Rectification Project, which, from 1935 to 1938, straightened and stabilized the path of the Rio Grande through the El Paso–Juárez Valley. By the end of the project, 174 parcels had been transferred between Mexico and Texas, each side receiving an equal area of land.[395][396] too small to map December 29, 1934 Kingman Reef was placed under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of the Navy.[380] no change to map November 15, 1935 The Insular Government of the Philippine Islands was dissolved and replaced with the Commonwealth of the Philippines.[397][398] Pacific Ocean:\n\nMarch 16, 1936 The de jure overlap between Michigan and Wisconsin was resolved by the Supreme Court of the United States.[399] May 13, 1936 Baker Island, Howland Island, and Jarvis Island were formally annexed and placed under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of the Interior,[400] ending the United Kingdom's claim to Jarvis Island.[266] Pacific Ocean:\n\nJune 22, 1936 The U.S. Virgin Islands were organized into a civil territory.[401] no change to map August 6, 1936 Canton Island, Enderbury Island, and McKean Island were claimed by the United Kingdom.[266] Pacific Ocean:\n\nApril 6, 1939 The condominium of the Canton and Enderbury Islands was established with the United Kingdom.[402] Pacific Ocean:\n\nJuly 27, 1939 Panama gained a sovereign corridor that was carved out of the Panama Canal Zone connecting Colón with the rest of Panama, along with a three-dimensional \"tube\" of sovereignty for a future crossing over an American highway. A corridor consisting of the road from the Canal Zone boundary to Madden Dam was annexed to the Canal Zone.[403] Caribbean Sea:\n\nAugust 16, 1939 This is the earliest date so far discovered for when the United States began claiming Fakaofo, Funafuti, Hull Island, Niulakita, Nukufetau, and Nukulaelae.[404] Pacific Ocean:\n\nDecember 10, 1941 Governor George McMillin surrendered Guam to the Japanese military.[405] Pacific Ocean:\n\nDecember 23, 1941 The garrison on Wake Island surrendered to the Japanese military.[406] Pacific Ocean:\n\nMarch 26, 1942 The government of the Philippines evacuated from the territory in the face of Japanese advance. A government-in-exile would be established in Washington, D.C., on May 17, 1942. The United States Army Forces in the Far East would surrender on April 9, 1942, following the Battle of Bataan, and the final military holdouts would surrender on May 6, 1942, following the Battle of Corregidor.[407] Pacific Ocean:\n\nOctober 14, 1943 The Second Philippine Republic was established as a puppet state of Japan.[407] Pacific Ocean:\n\nAugust 10, 1944 Guam was captured from Japan.[405] Pacific Ocean:\n\nAugust 17, 1945 The Second Philippine Republic, in exile in Tokyo since April 3, 1945, was dissolved. The process of re-establishing the Commonwealth government on Philippine soil had started on October 23, 1944.[407] Pacific Ocean:\n\nSeptember 4, 1945 The Japanese garrison on Wake Island surrendered to the United States.[406] Pacific Ocean:\n\n1946–present (Decolonization)\n\n[edit]\n\nDate Event Change map July 4, 1946 The Commonwealth of the Philippines became independent as the Republic of the Philippines.[408] Pacific Ocean:\n\nJuly 18, 1947 The United Nations entrusted the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to the United States.[7] Pacific Ocean:\n\nJanuary 1, 1949 The Tokelau Islands were incorporated into New Zealand, which inherited the claims on Atafu, Fakaofo, and Nukunono.[409] Pacific Ocean:\n\nAugust 1, 1950 Guam was organized into a civil territory.[410][411] no change to map August 3, 1950 Kansas and Missouri exchanged small portions of land along the Missouri River, to accord with shifts in the river following a flood in 1944.[412] April 11, 1955 Panama's corridor connecting Colón with the rest of Panama was realigned within the Panama Canal Zone. Several three-dimensional \"tubes\" of sovereignty were also created, allowing Panamanian bridges to pass over rivers and a highway at several locations within the Canal Zone.[413][414] too small to map August 23, 1955 Several border locations of the Panama Canal Zone were redefined.

In addition, Mexico ceded 823 acres (3.33 km2) to the U.S., while the U.S. ceded 2,177 acres (8.81 km2) to Mexico, primarily to straighten sections of the Rio Grande for flood control.[424] December 16, 1977 A treaty defining the maritime border with Cuba was signed; though it has never been ratified by the United States Senate, it is provisionally enforced by agreement renewed every two years.[351] no change to map October 1, 1978 Tuvalu became independent from the United Kingdom. It claimed the atolls of Funafuti, Nukufetau, Nukulaelae, and Niulakita.[425] Pacific Ocean:\n\nJuly 12, 1979 The Republic of Kiribati became independent from the United Kingdom. It claimed Birnie Island, Canton Island, Caroline Island, Christmas Island, Enderbury Island, Flint Island, Gardner Island, Hull Island, Malden Island, McKean Island, Phoenix Island, Starbuck Island, Sydney Island, and Vostok Island. This dissolved the condominium of the Canton and Enderbury Islands.[426] Pacific Ocean:\n\nOctober 1, 1979 The Panama Canal Zone was ceded to Panama. The United States and Panama continued to share operational control of the canal until December 31, 1999, when it would be fully turned over to Panama.[427] The United States retained control over several hundred specified areas to be turned over in piecemeal fashion over the years. Caribbean Sea:\n\nNovember 24, 1980 The maritime border between the United States and Venezuela was defined.[351][428] no change to map September 17, 1981 The United States recognized the sovereignty of Colombia over Roncador Bank and Serrana Bank, and the claim on Quita Sueño Bank was abandoned by the United States, as it was no longer above the seas at high tide, and thus the government considered it unclaimable.[359][429] Caribbean Sea:\n\nSeptember 3, 1983 The United States recognized the sovereignty of the New Zealand territory of Tokelau over Atafu, Fakaofo, and Nukunono, and defined the maritime border with Tokelau.[351][359][430] Pacific Ocean:\n\nSeptember 8, 1983 The United States recognized the sovereignty of the Cook Islands over Manihiki, Penrhyn, Pukapuka, and Rakahanga, and the maritime border with the Cook Islands was defined.[351][359][431] Pacific Ocean:\n\nSeptember 23, 1983 The United States recognized the sovereignty of Kiribati over Birnie Island, Canton Island, Caroline Island, Christmas Island, Enderbury Island, Flint Island, Gardner Island, Hull Island, Malden Island, McKean Island, Phoenix Island, Starbuck Island, Sydney Island, and Vostok Island.[359][432]\n\nThe United States recognized the sovereignty of Tuvalu over Funafuti, Nukufetau, Nukulaelae, and Niulakita.[359][433]\n\nPacific Ocean:\n\nOctober 12, 1984 The International Court of Justice made its judgment on where the maritime border should be in the Gulf of Maine between the United States and Canada.[434][351] No land changed hands.

The original natural boundary of Ellis Island remained an enclave of New York.[446] December 31, 1999 All former Panama Canal Zone parcels not turned over since 1979, as well as all joint canal operations areas, were transferred to Panama. too small to map January 17, 2001 The maritime border between the United States and Mexico on the continental shelf in the western Gulf of Mexico beyond 200 nautical miles was defined.[351][447] no change to map November 24, 2009 Six islands along the Rio Grande were ceded from Texas to Mexico, and three islands and two bancos were ceded from Mexico to Texas.

When these bancos are created, the International Boundary and Water Commission investigates if land previously belonging to the United States or Mexico is to be considered on the other side of the border.[456] In all cases of these adjustments along the Rio Grande under the 1905 convention, which occurred on 37 different dates from 1910 to 1976, the transferred land was minuscule (ranging from one to 646 acres) and uninhabited.[457][458][459]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nGeography of the United States\n\nTerritories of the United States\n\nHistoric regions of the United States\n\nAmerican frontier\n\nList of U.S. state partition proposals\n\nList of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union\n\nMovements for the annexation of Canada to the United States\n\nNational Atlas of the United States\n\nOstend Manifesto (annexation of Cuba)\n\nList of territorial claims and designations in Colorado\n\nTerritorial evolution of Arizona\n\nTerritorial evolution of California\n\nTerritorial evolution of Idaho\n\nTerritorial evolution of Montana\n\nTerritorial evolution of Nevada\n\nTerritorial evolution of New Mexico\n\nTerritorial evolution of North Dakota\n\nTerritorial evolution of Oregon\n\nTerritorial evolution of South Dakota\n\nTerritorial evolution of Utah\n\nTerritorial evolution of Washington\n\nTerritorial evolution of Wyoming\n\nTerritories of the United States on stamps\n\nList of U.S.–Native American treaties, which indicates tribal land cessions\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]"
