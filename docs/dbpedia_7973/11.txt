The Nansen Passport is introduced

One of the biggest problems refugees left displaced and stateless by the First World War face is a lack of internationally recognized identification papers.

In response, the High Commissioner introduces the 'Nansen Passport'. It is effectively one of the first legal instruments to grant international protection to refugees and allows almost half a million displaced people the right to settle in a new country.

UNHCR is born

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is established by the United Nations General Assembly, mandated to "assume the function of providing international protection [...] to refugees who fall within the scope of the present Statute and of seeking permanent solutions for the problem of refugees".

The Office's first task is to help the more than one million people who remain displaced after the Second World War, mainly in Europe. UNHCR has a three-year mandate to complete this work and then disband.

The Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees

The 1951 Convention is adopted. It consolidates earlier international instruments and provides the most comprehensive codification of refugee rights at the time.

It defines the term ‘refugee’, outlines their rights and the international standards of treatment for their protection. However, significantly, it is limited to persons who became refugees before 1 January 1951.

UNHCR awarded the Nobel Peace Prize

UNHCR receives the 1954 Nobel Peace Prize, with the ceremony taking place in 1955. UNHCR is the first United Nations agency to receive the award.

During his Nobel Lecture, then High Commissioner Gerrit Jan van Heuven Goedhart said "There can be no real peace in this world as long as hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children [...] still remain in camps and live in misery and in the greatest uncertainty of their future."

Hungarian uprising

The Hungarian uprising and its brutal suppression see more than 200,000 people flee to neighbouring countries. UNHCR faces its first post-war emergency, coordinating help for the thousands of displaced who arrive exhausted, hungry and in need of shelter.

This marks UNHCR’s transformation from an organization that dealt with the aftermath of the Second World War to one that could rise to the challenge of new, large-scale emergencies.

Algerian War of Independence as colonialism winds down in Africa

In May 1957, Tunisia asks UNHCR for assistance to protect thousands of Algerian refugees who have fled the War of Independence with France in their country. It is Africa's first modern refugee crisis and UNHCR’s first involvement on the African continent. UNHCR provides food, clothing and medical assistance to over 200,000 refugees in Tunisia as well as Morocco.

The following decade will see UNHCR support tens of thousands of people who flee the chaos of independence struggles in parts of Africa as colonialism winds down.

The 1967 Protocol is adopted

The need for refugee aid and protection has spread far beyond Europe. Huge new refugee populations have been created in Asia and Africa.

The 1967 Protocol is introduced to amend the 1951 Refugee Convention, which was limited to those who became refugees before 1 January 1951. It extends protection to all refugees no matter the date they were forced to leave their homes.

Fall of Saigon

Following the fall of Saigon, thousands of Vietnamese refugees take to the sea despite the risks of piracy and drowning. The group pictured made it to Malaysia in 1978 after their small boat sank mere metres from the shore.

Nearly 255,000 Vietnamese 'boat-people' were given temporary asylum in Malaysia, with UNHCR helping over 240,000 resettle in other countries.

Height of the Indochina refugee crisis

Upheavals following the Communist victories in former French colonies of Cambodia, Laos and Viet Nam continue to drive mass displacement in the region.

Under the brutal Khmer Rouge regime, an estimated one million people are executed or die of starvation, disease or overwork. When the regime falls in 1979, hundreds of thousands stream into neighbouring Thailand to shelter in UNHCR-supported camps, among them many unaccompanied children.

Central America civil wars and unrest

UNHCR is involved in Central America for the first time as civil wars and widespread human rights abuses displace two million people from Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.

More than 300,000 people were assisted in the region, including this Guatemalan refugee photographed in 1982 in Mexico, where UNHCR organized agricultural and other self-sufficiency projects.

UNHCR is awarded a second Nobel Peace Prize

In recognition of efforts to protect millions of refugees displaced around the world, UNHCR receives the 1981 Nobel Peace Prize. It is only the second time an organization has received the prize twice, and UNHCR is the only UN agency to do so.

“Today, the voices of millions of refugees in the world are being heard. Voices seeking belief in man, in human dignity, in basic human rights,” said then High Commissioner Mr. Poul Hartling in his Nobel Lecture.

Rwandan genocide

An estimated 800,000 Rwandans are killed in widespread massacres between April and July 1994. A further two million people flee in a mass exodus to neighbouring countries.

UNHCR provides protection and assistance, including establishing camps and coordinating humanitarian aid. At the time, it was one of the most complex and challenging emergencies UNHCR had faced.

The United Nations General Assembly removes the time limitation on the continuation of the Office of the High Commissioner, making the mandate permanent “until the refugee problem is solved.”

Prior to this, UNHCR’s mandate had been formally renewed every few years.

Syrian crisis

Conflict in Syria breaks out in March 2011, forcing millions to flee their homes over the next few years. Many will remain displaced for years to come, with an estimated 6.8 million Syrian refugees still displaced abroad in 2021, over a decade after the war began.

Mediterranean refugee crisis

The Mediterranean refugee crisis dramatically escalates. One million refugees and migrants arrive in Europe by sea. Many make the crossing in overcrowded and unsafe boats that stall or sink on the way. In 2015 alone, over 3,700 people die or go missing at sea.

UNHCR provides support and care as people arrive and along key migration routes in Europe, while also calling for a comprehensive European response to the crisis and emphasizing the need for safe and legal asylum pathways.

Ukraine war triggers fastest-growing refugee crisis since Second World War

The Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sees 5.7 million Ukrainians flee their country, the fastest outflow of refugees on record since the Second World War.

By the end of the year, the total global number of people forcibly displaced will top 100 million people, meaning 1 in every 74 people on earth has been forced to flee.
