I'm Terry Gross.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Mary Poppins\")\n\nMs. JULIE ANDREWS: (As Mary Poppins) Now then, the qualifications. Item\n\none, a cheery disposition. I am never cross.\n\nItem two, rosy cheeks. Obviously.\n\nItem three, play games, all sorts. Well, I'm sure the children will find my\n\ngames extremely diverting.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: That's my guest, Julie Andrews, in \"Mary Poppins,\" interviewing for\n\nthe job of a nanny; a very magical nanny, as it turns out. \"Mary Poppins\" was\n\nJulie Andrews' first film. Her second was released the following year, 1965.\n\nThis time she was a nun turned governess, a very life-affirming governess.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Sound of Music\")\n\nMs. ANDREWS: (As Maria) All right, everybody, over here.\n\nUnidentified Child #1: (In character) What are we going to do?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: (As Maria) Let's think of something to sing for the baroness\n\nwhen she comes.\n\nUnidentified Child #2: (In character) Father doesn't like us to sing.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: (As Maria) Well, perhaps we can change his mind. Now, what\n\nsongs do you know?\n\nUnidentified Child #3: (In character) We don't know any songs.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: (As Maria) Not any?\n\nUnidentified Child #4: (In character) We don't even know how to sing.\n\nUnidentified Child #5: (In character) No.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: (As Maria) Well, let's not lose any time. You must learn.\n\nChild #1: (In character) But how?\n\n(Soundbite of guitar)\n\nMs. ANDREWS: (As Maria, singing) Let's start at the very beginning. A very\n\ngood place to start. When you read you begin with...\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: That's Julie Andrews in \"The Sound of Music.\" Andrews has written a\n\nmemoir about her early years, called \"Home.\" It's filled with surprised about\n\nher family life, and tells how she got started in vaudeville in her parents'\n\nact, then went to Broadway when she was still a teenager, where she soon\n\noriginated the role of Eliza Doolittle in \"My Fair Lady.\" She's still making\n\nmovies, like \"The Princess Diaries\" and \"Enchanted,\" in which she's the\n\nnarrator. But Julie Andrews can't sing anymore. That part of her life ended\n\nafter surgery on her vocal chords.\n\nJulie Andrews, welcome to FRESH AIR.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Thank you, Terry. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nGROSS: You know, in reading your memoir, I have to say, your family life\n\nisn't at all what I imagined it would be. I mean, I though you'd be from a\n\nkind of proper, straitlaced family based on my idea of who you were from your\n\nroles. And I wonder what you think your image is and if my mistake is a\n\ncommon one?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: It is a common one, and a lot of people have been surprised\n\nabout the book. If you know me very well, you can probably spot that my\n\nbackground is real good, down-and-out vaudeville musical background, but a lot\n\nof people, because of their association with the wonderful films like \"Mary\n\nPoppins\" and \"Sound of Music,\" they think that I am this very squeaky clean,\n\nupper class lady that came from such a family. And it's so far from the\n\ntruth.\n\nGROSS: Let's start with the fact that two of your grandparents died of\n\nsyphilis.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Yes. Yeah. I mean, my background is really Dickensian in so\n\nmany ways. I was surprised when I found out those facts.\n\nGROSS: What was your understanding of syphilis when you were a child and\n\nfound out how your grandfather died?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Well, I think it was kept very much from me.\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: I mean, it was sort of a subject that we didn't talk about.\n\nAnd being a young kid, we certainly didn't talk about it. And so it was\n\nsomewhat of a mystery. It was that awful thing that was just out there, and\n\nit wasn't until I was older that I began to really grasp its significance and\n\nthe, you know, the horror of it and what it must have been like.\n\nI do know that my aunt--and I write this in the book--said that she didn't\n\nwant to discuss my grandfather's death because he was in a sanatorium that was\n\nreally a sort of madhouse in those days--I mean, you have to think how many\n\nyears ago this all took place--and the conditions were appalling and people\n\nwere very, very disturbed and mentally ill. And he apparently had a very\n\nnasty time of it and passed away there.\n\nGROSS: Now, your mother was a pianist, and she left your father to perform\n\nwith a singer named Ted Andrews, who she later married; and they left home\n\nduring World War II, when you were young, to perform for the troops. You\n\nstayed with your father and your aunt. What was it like to have your mother\n\nleave during wartime?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Well, I was--I'm going to sound a real Pollyanna here, but I\n\nwas raised during the war. I mean, I was practically born into the war. I\n\nthink I was two years or old or something when war broke out. So I knew\n\nnothing else, Terry. It was not so unusual to be raised in war because all my\n\npeers were being raised the same way, and we all were in it together. I mean,\n\nwe went down to the bomb shelters together. We went down into the subway, the\n\nunderground together and took refuge from the bombs that were dropping all\n\nover London. And so it was part of what we did to survive.\n\nAnd it was scary to hear the crunch of bombs, and to this day a fire\n\nsiren--you know, one of those wailing sirens that goes off when there is a\n\nfire in the area--evokes tremendous memories. But I don't know if it was an\n\nindelible imprint that forever left me challenged, if you know what I mean.\n\nGROSS: Would you describe how, after your mother brought you to London, where\n\nshe was living with the man who became your stepfather, you learned how to\n\ndistinguish the sound of the British fighter planes from the German fighter\n\nplanes.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: That's right.\n\nGROSS: And you'd warn everybody by blowing a whistle when a German plane was\n\ncoming. That was probably a pretty important role that you could play as a\n\nchild.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Well, I was sent out in all weathers, regardless of--you know,\n\nrain or shine, hail or snow. I was sent out by my mother. You have to\n\nunderstand that women, toward the end of the war, could accomplish nothing\n\nbecause the air raid sirens were coming so furiously, and every half hour the\n\nsiren would go off. And a woman would be baking a cake or doing her laundry\n\nor any number of things, and she'd have to take it out of the oven or turn off\n\nthe, you know, stop washing her clothes and so on. And so it interrupted\n\neverything.\n\nAnd my mother had this great idea that if--and she knew that I could\n\ndistinguish the difference between a German doodlebug, as they were called in\n\nthose days, those pilotless planes that came over and just dropped on London\n\nand around London; and I could tell the difference between that and one of our\n\nfighter pilots. And so she sent me out to sit on top of our air raid shelter\n\nwith a pair of opera glasses, which were absolutely no good at all, and an\n\numbrella and a whistle. And when I heard the German planes coming, I blew the\n\nwhistle, which gave her a little bit more time to get on with anything she was\n\ndoing.\n\nBut, of course, there came a day when I truly rebelled and said, `I'm not\n\ngoing to do it. It's too wet and it's too cold out there.' And after the bomb\n\nhad dropped in our neighborhood, we had a few irate neighbors coming around to\n\nour door saying, `Why didn't she blow her whistle? We were relying on it.' So\n\nI had to keep doing it from then on.\n\nGROSS: Your stepfather became an alcoholic and became abusive. He beat your\n\nyounger brother with a cane.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Yes.\n\nGROSS: And you write, \"I did nothing to stop the beatings, which lasted so\n\nlong that I suspected Pop enjoyed it or could not stop himself. I did nothing\n\nfor fear of taking sides, for fear that if I reached out, I might be the next\n\nrecipient. My brain would turn on a dime and I would think, `Well, my brother\n\nhad been naughty.'\"\n\nSo looking back in retrospect as an adult on how you didn't do anything to\n\nintervene as a child, is there anything you really could have done as a child?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: No. I just, I think, one just felt guilty. The fact that my\n\nmother did nothing about it, that I did nothing about it, that my aunt, who\n\nlived close by, did nothing about it. And this sad--well, there were two\n\nbrothers that were pretty badly--it didn't happen an enormous amount, but the\n\nfact that it happened at all is appalling. And the child was a rebel of\n\nsorts, but he was the middle boy and life was turbulent, and any middle child,\n\nprobably, with that kind of existence is going to act out. And it was just--I\n\nknew it was wrong. I knew it was sad, and I wished I could have done\n\nsomething about it. And I think I did feel guilty that I didn't try to stop\n\nit. But you're right, I don't think I could have done anything about it.\n\nGROSS: Your stepfather beat your brother with a cane. You had your own\n\nrun-in with your stepfather. Twice he came into your bedroom, climbed into\n\nyour bed and told you...\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Well, he didn't climb into my bed, but he certainly made an\n\nadvance. Thank God at that point he did not climb into my bed. And...\n\nGROSS: But he told you that you needed to be taught how to kiss?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Yes, he did. That was--but he was not in my bed, thank God.\n\nThat would have been very difficult. But I was able to--you have to remember,\n\nhe was an alcoholic and there were days where he wasn't an alcoholic and he\n\ndid a lot of things to further my career, to try to help me in many ways.\n\nBut, of course, because he was a stepfather, because he was seemingly a\n\ndangerous man in the family presence, I didn't like him that much,\n\nparticularly not at first. And thank God he was decent enough somewhere to\n\npull back, and I was only abused in that he did try to kiss me; and he would\n\nhave probably come into bed, but I had a lock put on the door and a few things\n\nlike that, and it only happened twice, mercifully.\n\nGROSS: How did you get him out of your room?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: I kind of joshed him. You know, `Thank you. Now, come on.\n\nIt's time that I get to bed.' I don't know what I said, really, but I do know\n\nthat there was a kind of pushing and a gentle shoving, and--I didn't want to\n\nmake waves. I know that. I wanted to just get him out of the room and climb\n\ninto the safety of my bed and face the wall, so to speak.\n\nGROSS: You told your aunt about this, and you assume that she told your\n\nmother.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Yes. She lived on our property, and my mother was away.\n\nGROSS: How come you told your aunt? Some people would keep that--would be\n\nlike so afraid that they would just keep it a secret from anybody and carry\n\nthe burden of the secret for decades.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Well, I wasn't threatened in that sense. He didn't say, `Don't\n\ntell anybody.' He didn't say, `You'll be in trouble if you do.' There was none\n\nof that. I mean, he was drunk, and it was just a bad moment in his life and\n\nin mine. But I, thank God, had enough sense to say, `Auntie, what do I do\n\nabout this?'\n\nGROSS: My guest is Julie Andrews, and she's written a new memoir. It's\n\ncalled \"Home: A Memoir of My Early Years.\"\n\nWhen your mother and your stepfather brought you into their vaudeville act,\n\nwho were you in the act? Like, what was your role? What kind of stuff did\n\nyou sing?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Oh. I think I started doing this. My father began to give me\n\nsinging lessons when I was about seven years--my stepfather began to give me\n\nsinging lessons when I was about seven years old. He was a fine singer. And\n\nmy mother was a wonderful pianist. In my youth, she was a really good concert\n\npianist. And she and my stepfather formed this vaudeville act, which became\n\npretty successful all around England and on the boards, and also on radio,\n\nwhich was very big in those days. And he began giving me singing lessons at\n\nthe age of about seven and was so surprised to discover that I had a, you\n\nknow, unusually powerful adult larynx.\n\nHe very quickly realized that it probably would be a smart thing to give me\n\nover to a fine singing teacher, and that good lady was my teacher until the\n\nday she died, aged 90-something-or-other. So for many, many decades she was\n\nmy teacher, and she taught well and gave me a great technique.\n\nSo when I went on the boards with my parents for the first time, I was about\n\nnine, and my stepfather--who was a good salesman, too--he went out and spoke\n\nwith the front of house manager of whatever theater they were playing in\n\nwhatever town they were, and asked permission to bring their young daughter\n\nonto the stage that night. And he announced to the audience that he had a\n\nsurprise for the audience, that his and my mother's young daughter were\n\ntraveling with them for the holidays or something like that and they wanted to\n\ninvite me on the stage to sing a duet. And I sang a duet with my stepfather.\n\nAnd I was so small that they put me on a sort of wooden beer crate, I\n\nthink--or a bottle crate, anyway--to reach the microphone beside him. And we\n\nbelted out a song called \"Come to the Fair,\" which was a duet; and it went\n\ndown pretty well. And I seemed to enjoy it, and the audience seemed to love\n\nit, so things progressed from there.\n\nGROSS: Your singing teacher, who was your singing teachers for decades?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Mm-hmm.\n\nGROSS: You describe how she helped you place your voice.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Yes.\n\nGROSS: Can you describe a little bit what that process was?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Oh, well, it went on for many, many years, and she gave me a\n\ngreat foundation: good placement of voice, good attention to lyrics,\n\nparticularly--well, both vowels and consonants. If you have trouble with a\n\ncertain note, her technique was to practice usually the note before it. If\n\nyou have trouble hitting a high note at the end of a song, then work on the\n\npenultimate note, which, with a good strong foundation and being placed\n\ncorrectly will allow the high note to follow it in exactly the same position\n\nand place.\n\nAs I say, vowels. One had to be very true to them and hold them firmly, and\n\nprecede them with strong consonants. I say in the book, which is probably the\n\nbest example I can give, we used to practice a lot of Handel's music because\n\nhe also had great words to his beautiful music, and we'd practice the\n\n\"Messiah,\" for instance. And if I was singing \"Behold, thy kind cometh unto\n\nthee,\" I would do a very strong \"b\" on the \"behold.\" And the O of \"hold\" would\n\nbe strong. And \"thy king,\" the T-H would be strong and would pull the Y of\n\n\"thy\" forward. And following a note to its absolute end and then just\n\nliterally cutting off the breath so that you didn't swallow it at the end of\n\nthe sound. Many, many, many details like that.\n\nGROSS: It's so interesting that, on the one hand, you're studying. You're\n\ngetting this great classical training with your teacher, singing Handel; and\n\nat the same time, you're performing in your parents' vaudeville act.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: But, you know...\n\nGROSS: It was a nice mix.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: My gimmick and my stock in trade in those days was to belt out\n\nsomewhat, you know, cut and bastardized versions of the great arias. I sang\n\nthe \"Caro Nome\" from Rigoletto. I sang the--I can't even remember it now--the\n\ngreat aria from Traviata, \"Sempre Libera.\" I'm sorry, I couldn't remember the\n\nname for a second. And my great stock in trade was the \"Polonaise\" from the\n\nopera \"Mignon.\" And that a phenomenally high note at the end of it and usually\n\nbrought the house down.\n\nGROSS: So it was almost like a stunt, a kid singing all these difficult adult\n\narias.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Exactly. And, you know, when I finally went out in my own act\n\nat about age 15 and my--something rather sad happened, which was that my\n\nparents--we use to be billed as \"Ted and Barbara Andrews,\" my mother and my\n\nstepfather, \"with Julie.\" And eventually the billing would say, \"Julie Andrews\n\nwith Ted and Barbara.\" And that must have just been dreadful for my\n\nstepfather. It must have, you know, castrated him dreadfully, I would think.\n\nGROSS: Hm. Well, you know, he did some really bad things to you and your\n\nbrother; but at the same time, he gave you the singing lessons and...\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Oh, he tried to be kind.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: I just wouldn't have any of it, I'm afraid, because, as I say,\n\nhe was overwhelming and a big man, a powerful man.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: A little frightening in that sense.\n\nGROSS: You know, I'm wondering, since so many actors draw on their own\n\nexperiences for roles, how did some of the problems that you faced as a child\n\nthat we've been discussing affect you when you were filming classics like\n\n\"Mary Poppins\" and like \"Sound of Music\"?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Well, this may sound very Pollyanna-ish, but I think I always\n\nhad a great capacity for joy in my life. My father--my supposed father--was\n\nthe sanest, wisest, kindest gentleman, who was a nature-loving man, loved the\n\ncountry; and the whole family had a great sense of humor. And other than the\n\nexceptions that I've mentioned, life wasn't terrible. People have had far,\n\nfar worse--much worse upbringings than mine. Mine was unusual and full of\n\nwonderful characters; but I never considered it a bad or difficult childhood.\n\nIt was a childhood, and because of those vaudeville days--when the whole\n\nattitude was that the show must go on and we must all get on with it, and you\n\ngo through everything that comes at you because what choice do you have?--I\n\nnever sort of wallowed in any of it.\n\nAnd I really did enjoy my life very much, and it was full of kind of wonderful\n\nmagic for me. You can imagine being that young and having a freak--certainly\n\nan odd, very large singing voice, very strong, very powerful, that was able to\n\ndo all these amazing sort of calisthenics and coloratura scales and arias,\n\ncondensers and so on. Life was fun to some extent. I was different. It\n\nstood me in good stead at my school. We traveled a great deal all over\n\nEngland, and it was in pretty tacky circumstances. The digs were awful, and\n\nwe put up with a great deal, but we did manage. And somehow, I think, all\n\nthat background in vaudeville, all the touring, all the getting through it\n\ngave me an awareness of how lucky I was when those wonderful films were\n\noffered to me. And they were the wonderful sort of passport or lifeline that\n\ngave me my life. And I was full of joy.\n\nGROSS: You went to New York at the age of about 20?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: No, it was...\n\nGROSS: Nineteen?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: I came in my late--when I was just about to turn 19. And the\n\nshow that I was in was a show called \"The Boy Friend,\" a product that was\n\nbrought over from England. It had been a huge success in London. It was a\n\nsort of loving nod to the 1920s, a little pastiche, a little piece of lace.\n\nAnd the original cast was still playing in London to enormous success; and the\n\nAmerican producers were not able to secure that cast for their show in New\n\nYork, so a completely new cast was, you know, assembled. And I was lucky\n\nenough to be asked to play the leading role in \"The Boy Friend.\" And I was 19\n\nthe day after we opened, so the great notices that the shows received were\n\nlike the most wonderful birthday gift.\n\nGROSS: And after doing \"The Boy Friend\" on Broadway, you did \"My Fair Lady.\"\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Yes.\n\nGROSS: So did you have to audition or did they just give you a part?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Oh, gosh no. No, I did many auditions. I sang for Alan\n\nLerner, and then I went up to sing for Frederick Loewe with Alan. Then I read\n\na lot of scenes and dialogue scenes with Alan, who somehow--God knows how,\n\nbecause I'd never done a play before. I'd never played a character. I'd\n\nnever done a role in a really legitimate piece. All I knew was how to belt\n\nout an aria on a vaudeville stage, and that was it. So...\n\nGROSS: What about \"The Boy Friend?\" You'd been in that.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Well, I'd \"The Boy Friend,\" and I'd had a year's experience.\n\nThat's true. But, again, I staggered through \"The Boy Friend,\" learning on my\n\nfeet as I went. And then you can imagine that George Bernard Shaw was a\n\nhundred times, you know, stronger and important than that, and I was really\n\nfloundering. But I think because of my voice, because they sensed something,\n\nmaybe, in my makeup, they felt that I could do Eliza, and so I was offered the\n\nrole.\n\nGROSS: And you were...\n\nMs. ANDREWS: I'm sure I wasn't the first, but I was the lucky one that\n\nlanded it.\n\nGROSS: You write in your book that you didn't know how to do a Cockney\n\naccent.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Yes.\n\nGROSS: Which is funny...\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Well, I mean...\n\nGROSS: Yeah. Go ahead.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Give me a break. I was so busy learning who I was and what I\n\nwas doing, and never had the opportunity to do that before. Although I had a\n\nvery good ear and had perfect pitch and many things that helped me, so help\n\nme, I couldn't do a Cockney accent.\n\nGROSS: So who taught you?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: An American professor of phonetics, my own American Henry\n\nHiggins, a weird reversal of the Pygmalion story.\n\nGROSS: And what's the first thing he--what's the basic principle he taught\n\nyou?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Oh, gosh. Now, that's a hard question to answer. I don't\n\nthink I can. Just literally taking me through the lines of the play and\n\nwidening vowels, shortening them, dropping Hes and all those kind--I'm pretty\n\nsure that my general overall Cockney was not great, but it got me by, perhaps\n\nmore so in America because not many Americans know a genuine Cockney accent.\n\nBut I had a tougher time by the time I took the play England, but by then I'd\n\nhad a lot of learning experience so I fared better.\n\nGROSS: Did your coach give you advice on how to sing \"Wouldn't It Be\n\nLoverly\"?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: No. No. Funnily enough, he didn't, as far as I can recall.\n\nAlan Lerner had written the lyrics to sound Cockney, you know? `Oww, wouldn't\n\nit be lov-er-ly.'\n\nGROSS: So it was written like O-W?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: O-W-W, I think. Or E-O-W. I'm not quite sure which, but\n\nwhatever, it was written so that I knew it had to be sung, of course, in\n\nCockney. And \"Just you wait, `enry `iggins,\" and all of that was written the\n\nsame way. So that was not so difficult because, A, I was singing and, B, I'd\n\nlearned enough from my dialect coach to know what I had to do.\n\nGROSS: Why don't we hear \"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\"?\n\n(Soundbite from \"My Fair Lady\")\n\nMs. ANDREWS: (Singing) All I want is a room somewhere\n\nFar away from the cold night air\n\nWith one enormous chair\n\nOww, wouldn't it be loverly\n\nLots of chocolate for me to eat\n\nLots of coal making lots of `eat\n\nWarm face, warm `ands, warm feet\n\nOww, wouldn't it be loverly?\n\nOh, so loverly sitting abso-blooming-lutely still\n\nI would never budge till spring crept over me windah-sill\n\nSomeone's `ead resting on my knee\n\nWarm and tender as `e can be\n\nWho tykes good care of me\n\nOww, wouldn't it be loverly?\n\nLoverly\n\nLoverly\n\nLoverly\n\nLoverly\n\nUnidentified Group of Men #1: (Singing) All I want is a room somewhere\n\nUnidentified Group of Men #2: (Singing) Ahhhh, ahhh\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: That's Julie Andrews singing \"Wouldn't it be Loverly\" from the\n\noriginal Broadway cast recording of \"My Fair Lady.\"\n\nYou know, it's such a really like lovely tune.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Isn't it pretty?\n\nGROSS: Yeah. Did you, when you were given the song to sing, did you say,\n\n`Great song. It'll be a classic'?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: No. I did say great song. I knew it was lovely. I knew all\n\nthe music for \"My Fair Lady\" was wonderful. I knew it was special and that\n\nthese gentlemen were supremely talented. I mean, can you imagine hearing\n\n\"I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face\" for the first time?\n\nGROSS: Oh, man. What a great song.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: I know.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: And \"Why Can't a Woman be More Like a Man?\" And \"Why Can't the\n\nEnglish Teach Their Children How To Speak?\" I mean, phenomenal lyrics.\n\nGROSS: Now, when \"My Fair Lady\" was adapted into a film, you didn't get the\n\npart. I don't know if you wanted it or not, but it went to Audrey Hepburn.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Well, I don't think there's any doubt about the fact that I\n\nwould have loved to have played Eliza on film; but I really at the time\n\nunderstood the choice to not go with an unknown, because although I was fairly\n\nwell known on Broadway, but I was only really just making my name. Certainly\n\nI wasn't known in the world or in the movie industry; and in those days, you\n\nknow, a star was required. And Audrey was asked to do the role. And we\n\nbecame great friends, Audrey Hepburn and I.\n\nGROSS: Good.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: And she said to me one day, `Oh, Julie, you should have done\n\nit, but I didn't have the guts to turn it down.' Which was lovely and charming\n\nof her, and I completely understood why she was asked to do it.\n\nGROSS: And she ended up being dubbed by Marni Nixon. Now, when...\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Her singing voice, yes.\n\nGROSS: Her singing voice. Her singing voice.\n\nOn the other hand, when \"The Sound of Music\" was adapted from stage to film,\n\nMary Martin didn't get cast in the movie, you got...\n\nMs. ANDREWS: No. So...\n\nGROSS: You got the movie role.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: There you go.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. So did you feel bad about Mary Martin?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: I did. Just for a moment, Terry. Yes, I did think, `Oh, my.\n\nI wonder how she feels about this?' But for whatever reason, she had done it\n\nonstage just as I had done \"My Fair Lady.\" She probably felt pretty bad, too.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: Let's get back to our interview with Julie Andrews. She has a new\n\nmemoir about her early years called \"Home.\" Here she is in one of her most\n\nfamous performances from the movie \"The Sound of Music.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Sound of Music\")\n\nMs. ANDREWS: (Singing) The hills are alive with the sound of music\n\nWith songs they have sung for a thousand years\n\nThe hills fill my heart with the sound of music\n\nMy heart wants to sing every song it hears\n\nMy heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds\n\nThat rise from the lake to the trees\n\nMy heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies\n\nFrom a church on a breeze\n\nTo laugh like a brook when it trips and falls\n\nOver stones on its way\n\nTo sing through the night\n\nLike a lark who is learning to pray\n\nI go to the hills when my heart is lonely\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: Now, \"The Sound of Music\" provokes very strong reactions from people.\n\nPeople tend to just like love the film or not because they think it's too\n\nsaccharine.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: I know.\n\nGROSS: So where do you fit in on the scale?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: I now how hard we all tried, recognizing that there was a\n\nsaccharine quality to it. I mean, you have a whole, you know, whole family of\n\nchildren and a nanny governess, and a lot of countryside, and a lot of\n\nreligious ladies flying around the place, and you're going to get a bit of\n\nsaccharine there. That's for sure. And we all knew that, even though the\n\nmusic was lovely, that we had to play, if possible, against that saccharin\n\nquality. And I know that Christopher Plummer--I, certainly--we did our utmost\n\nto push it away somewhere.\n\nI remember distinctly one scene where I really wanted Maria to be absolutely\n\nhorrified that she was going to have to take care of seven children, because\n\nthat's the way somebody would have reacted, I think. I mean, you know, being\n\nnanny to one child is enough, but seven! So we did try, and we were aware\n\nthat there were saccharine moments.\n\nBut then the beauty of \"Sound of Music\" was the scenery was so gorgeous and we\n\ndid film in Austria, and we had a symphony orchestra all that glorious music,\n\nand I think that saccharine quality was compensated for in a million ways.\n\nGROSS: Let me ask you about what might be the most famous shot from the film,\n\nwhich was used on advertising posters. And it's a picture of you, while\n\nsinging \"The Sound of Music,' with your arms out.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Yes.\n\nGROSS: Twirling around, alone in the mountains.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Yes. That's right, in the very, very, cold, rainy, wet\n\nmountains.\n\nGROSS: Talk about that shot.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Oh, well, that shot--the bulk of that shot was filmed from a\n\nhelicopter. And I would start at one end of this long field and the\n\nhelicopter would start at the other end of the field, and we would come\n\ntowards each other. The very brave cameraman was hanging out of the side of\n\nthe helicopter, where the door would normally be, strapped in with a camera\n\nattached to his chest. And the helicopter sort of came at me sideways, rather\n\nsort of crab-like, edging its way towards me, and I walked towards it and\n\nexecuted that now-famous turn just before singing. And we did that shot many\n\ntimes to be sure that the focus was right and that everything about it was\n\nright.\n\nBut the trouble was that, once that shot had been completed and we each went\n\nback to our own respective ends of the field to start again, the downdraft\n\nfrom the helicopter circling around me dashed me off my feet and into the\n\ngrass, it was so strong. Now, this is fine for, you know, one or two takes;\n\nbut after about four or five takes, I began to get quite angry about it and\n\nthought, you know, there must be a way that I don't have to be leveled every\n\ntime we finish this shot. So I signalled to the pilot to please make a wider\n\ncircle around me. And all I got was a thumbs up and, you know, `Great. I\n\nthink we got it. But let's do it one more time.' And I bit the dust and I\n\nsort of spat mud and hay and everything else for every single take of that\n\nparticular shot.\n\nGROSS: That's so great because the story behind the shot is so different than\n\nthe shot itself.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Yes.\n\nGROSS: You know? It's like you're suffering to do it.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: There were a lot of things about \"The Sound of Music\" that had\n\nthat, though. I mean, the weather was not great, in the mountains\n\nparticularly. And it rained a great deal of the time. And we would sit under\n\ntarpaulins and manage to get through a day with sometimes just 30 seconds of\n\nfilm footage. And it was cold and it was damp. But the clouds and their\n\nstrength and the beauty that they brought to the film itself was a gift that,\n\nI mean, if we'd just been a sunny postcard--I mean, it was a postcard enough,\n\nbut it gave texture to the movie, which helped enormously.\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Julie Andrews, and her new\n\nmemoir is about her early years, and it's called \"Home.\"\n\nYou had such a lovely singing voice and you haven't been able to sing since\n\nabout 2005. You had surgery to remove a node on one of your vocal chords and\n\nhaven't been able to sing since, and I understand you sued your surgeon\n\nbecause of that. I figure it must have been really difficult for you to not\n\nbe able to sing. I mean, obviously that affected you professionally. But\n\njust like personally and emotionally, what did it mean for you to not be able\n\nto do that anymore?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Mm, it wasn't a node. I didn't have cancerous nodes, as so\n\nmany people think I did. I just had a small sort of cyst--or seemingly I had\n\na cyst in my vocal chords, and even that has now been proved to be rather\n\nsuspect. But I'm not allowed to talk about the operation itself because of,\n\nyou know, lawyers and people like that would ask me not to. But I can tell\n\nyou that it was, of course, devastating. I'm very glad it happened toward the\n\nend of my singing life rather than at the beginning. I miss singing with an\n\norchestra enormously.\n\nI think I was in denial for a year or two, thinking that perhaps I was just\n\ntaking longer to heal than most people, that my throat was a little more\n\nsensitive than most. But then there did come a day where I had to begin\n\nliving with it, and I live with it to this day.\n\nI guess in the sort of old tradition of vaudevillians, I could give up and\n\ncrawl away or I could make what was left of my life something decent. And I\n\nwondered what I was meant to learn from it. Perhaps there was a lesson in it\n\nall. God knows what that was. But I did begin to write more, and it allowed\n\nme time to write this autobiography, and I've kept very busy. I seem to be\n\nbusier these days than I've ever been, and I don't get it, but I'm extremely\n\ngrateful.\n\nGROSS: Well, you're still making movies, you know.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: That's right.\n\nGROSS: You can't forget about that.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: \"The Princess Diaries.\" And I do go out on speaking\n\nengagements, which I enjoy very much. And I'm a huge advocate for literacy\n\nand bringing art into schools for children and helping school libraries, which\n\nare so underfunded. Everything about the arts is underfunded, it seems.\n\nGROSS: One more thing before we have to let you go. The 1982 movie\n\n\"Victor/Victoria\" that you starred in, you played a woman pretending to be a\n\nman pretending to be a woman. You played a woman pretending to be a man\n\nperforming in drag. And with the help of that movie, as even the Wikipedia\n\npoints out, you've become an icon for family films and also something of an\n\nicon in the gay and lesbian community because of \"Victor/Victoria\" and maybe\n\nalso because of \"Sing-a-long Sound of Music.\"\n\nMs. ANDREWS: Seemed to have sort of covered the whole spectrum somehow.\n\nGROSS: So is that a surprise to you that you're both?\n\nMs. ANDREWS: I'm delighted. I'm just thrilled by it. I think it's the\n\nnicest thing that could happen. And, you know, that squeaky clean image which\n\nwas brought about by such lovely films that were so successful, such as\n\n\"Poppins\" and \"Sound of Music,\" I'm hoping that the body of work that I've\n\ndone since then has kind of dispelled that squeaky clean myth. But I'm\n\ndelighted to be embraced by families, by kids, by the gay culture, by\n\neveryone. And people are genuinely lovely when I meet them. I love going out\n\nand lecturing and meeting people and talking about my work and so on. It's a\n\ngreat pleasure.\n\nGROSS: Well, it's been wonderful to talk with you. Thank you so much.\n\nMs. ANDREWS: And you, Terry. Thank you so much.\n\nGROSS: Julie Andrews' new memoir is called \"Home.\" You can read an excerpt of\n\nit on our Web site, freshair.npr.org, where you can also download podcasts of\n\nour show.
