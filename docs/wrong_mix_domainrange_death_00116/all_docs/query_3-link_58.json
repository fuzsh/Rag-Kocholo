        "text": "The decades-long home of the late gun-advocating, Oscar-winning actor Charlton Heston has hit the market for the first time since his death in 2008, according to the property gossips at the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThis midcentury modern property, which Heston began building in the late 1950s while filming “Ben-Hur,” was listed by his family for $12.25 million.\n\nFraser C. Heston, Charlton’s son, told the Journal that it was a tough call to list the spread, but admitted “it’s the right time” to put the house on the market. He added that his mother, Lydia, no longer resides here.\n\nThe nearly 3 ½-acre property consists of a main house with mountain views, four bedrooms and space for staff, plus a separate building with a three-story art studio, a screening room and an extra bedroom.\n\nThe main home comes with a master suite with separate baths and walk-in closets. Most notably, this structure has a handsome two-story library."
