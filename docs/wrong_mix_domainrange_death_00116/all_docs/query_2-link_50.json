        "text": "A spokesman for the Heston family said he died on Saturday at his home in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nHis wife, Lydia, was at his side.\n\nHeston wowed the Bolton public in 1987 when he was in town to officially open the new Reebok international headquarters.\n\nAt a reception at Bolton Town Hall, Heston told the audience: \"I am glad to be part of this day for Bolton and for Reebok which had done so much work for American tennis.\" One man who remembers meeting the Hollywood legend is former security guard, John Turner.\n\nMr Turner, aged 58, of Leigh Road, Leigh, was the star's bodyguard for the day. He said: \"He is one of my favourite Hollywood actors and I had an absolutely amazing day. He was a really nice chap.\"\n\nCelebrity chef Tom Bridge, who lives in Blackrod, created a huge ice sculpture for the visit.\n\nHe said: \"He was a very nice man, a real gentleman. I was very sad to hear of his death.\""
