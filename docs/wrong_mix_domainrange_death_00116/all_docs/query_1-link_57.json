        "text": "Charlton Heston, one of the last lions of\n\nOld Hollywood, was remembered at his funeral Saturday as devoutly\n\nreligious and patriotic – a man who was an imposing figure both in his\n\npolitics and on the big screen.\n\nHeston died April 5 at age 84 in his Beverly Hills home with his wife, Lydia,\n\nat his side following a battle with Alzheimer’s disease. The service was held\n\nat the Episcopal Parish of St. Matthews, a church in a wooded canyon\n\nabove Pacific Palisades.\n\n“Charlton sat every Sunday morning right there,” said the Rev. Michael Scott\n\nSeiler, pointing to a front pew in the modernist wooden church shaped with\n\nseats arranged in a half moon.\n\nAbout 250 people attended the funeral, including family members, politicians\n\nand actors.\n\nA frail Nancy Reagan entered the church on the arm of Tom Selleck.\n\nFollowing the nearly two-hour ceremony, Reagan left with Gov. Arnold\n\nSchwarzenegger. Other notables from Heston’s Hollywood history included\n\nOlivia DeHavilland, Keith Carradine, Pat Boone, Oliver Stone and Rob\n\nReiner.\n\nThe first part of the ceremony was devoted to memories of Heston. His\n\ndaughter, Holly Heston Rochell, recalled her father’s love of poetry and\n\nrecited the words of Shakespeare and Tennyson. Her brother, Fraser Clarke\n\nHeston, reminisced about his father’s prowess on his tennis court, where he\n\nplayed every Sunday with friends.\n\nHe talked about his father’s devotion to America and said he “loved his\n\ncountry.”\n\n“I never knew a finer man; I will never know a finer man,” he said.\n\nHeston was one of the biggest box-office draws of the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s,\n\noften playing legendary leaders or ordinary men thrown into heroic struggles.\n\nSome of his notable roles included Marc Antony in “Julius Caesar” and\n\n“Antony and Cleopatra”; Michelangelo in “The Agony and the Ecstasy”; John\n\nthe Baptist in “The Greatest Story Ever Told”; and an astronaut on a\n\ntopsy-turvy world where simians rule in “Planet of the Apes.”\n\nIn recent years, Heston became better known for his conservative politics\n\nand position on gun rights as head of the National Rifle Association. Heston\n\nalso campaigned for Republican presidential and congressional candidates\n\nand against affirmative action.\n\nNear the end of his five-year tenure as NRA president in 2002, Heston\n\ndisclosed he had symptoms consistent with Alzheimer’s disease. Heston told\n\nhis fellow NRA members when he stepped down that his time in office was\n\n“quite a ride. … I loved every minute of it.”\n\nHeston was born Charles Carter in a Chicago suburb on Oct. 4, 1923. He\n\ngrew up in the Michigan wilderness and after serving in the Army during\n\nWorld War II began acting.\n\nAfter acting in two independent films by a college classmate, Heston was put\n\nunder contract by producer Hal B. Wallis (“Casablanca”). He was later cast\n\nas the circus manager in “The Greatest Show on Earth” and then as Moses\n\nin “The Ten Commandments.”\n\nHeston followed with several other films before “Ben-Hur” elevated him to the\n\ntop of Hollywood’s A-list.\n\nMichael Levine, who was Heston’s publicist for 20 years and attended the\n\nservice, said he was struck by how many people attended from both sides of\n\nthe political aisle. He attributed this to Heston’s “virtue and character.”\n\n“It was a beautiful service,” he said."
