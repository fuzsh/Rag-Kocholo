Rachel, continuing to fawn over clothing shopper Joshua, sets Ross up with her boss's niece when she is unable to take her to the opera. Ross ends up spending a weekend in Vermont with the niece, Emily. And while Chandler is despondent after his breakup with Kathy, the girls take him to a strip club.\n\nThe Californians\n\nBlake receives a business proposition from Jason Colby, whom he hasn't seen in 20 years; Jeff's Aunt Constance summons him to California when she learns her brother Jason is dying; the State Department questions Blake about Moldavian politics; Rita undergoes plastic surgery to complete her 'Krystle Look.'"
