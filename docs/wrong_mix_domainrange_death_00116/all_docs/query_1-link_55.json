        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Three works by Andrew Wyeth owned by the painter’s close friend and admirer, the late actor Charlton Heston, are headed for auction.\n\nThey are being offered for sale at Sotheby’s New York on Nov. 18 by the estate of the Hollywood legend and his wife, Lydia.\n\nThe works are Wyeth’s landscape “Flood Plain” from 1986, estimated at $2 million to $3 million; “Ice Pool,” a watercolor of a winter scene created in 1969 that carries a pre-sale estimate of $150,000 to $250,000; and “Study for ‘Flood Plain'” which the artist gave to Heston in 1991, estimated at $20,000 to $30,000.\n\nHeston died in 2008; Wyeth passed away the following year.\n\nThe actor greatly admired the work of Wyeth and began a correspondence with him in the 1980s. It led to a long friendship and visits by Heston to the Wyeth homestead in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania.\n\nHis first purchase was “Ice Pool,” which he gave to his wife as an anniversary gift. In 1987, he narrated a documentary on Wyeth’s “Helga” period, a series of over 200 paintings and drawings the artist created using his neighbor as a model.\n\nThe actor also wrote numerous articles on Wyeth, including for the National Review.\n\nFor Christmas in 1991, Heston received a package from Wyeth that contained the artist’s study for “Flood Plain.”\n\n“I haven’t been so excited about a Christmas gift since I was ten years old.” Heston wrote the artist. “You’ve given our family not only a piece of your work … but a part of the process … a private part of your working insides.”\n\nIn an introductory essay to the auction catalog, Heston’s son, Fraser Heston, said his father considered Wyeth “a kindred spirit, having grown up in Michigan with long, frozen winters and long, lovely walks through the gloaming woods.”\n\nThe three works are on view at Sotheby’s Los Angeles galleries on Thursday and Friday."
