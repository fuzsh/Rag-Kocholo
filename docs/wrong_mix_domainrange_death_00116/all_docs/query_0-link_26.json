        "text": "Charlton Heston (1923 - 2008)\n\nFormer President of the National Rifle Association\n\nFilm Deaths[]\n\nRuby Gentry (1952) [Boake Tackman]: Shot in the chest by James Anderson in the swamp while Charlton is talking to Jennifer Jones.\n\nThe Ten Commandments (1956) [Moses]: Dies (off-screen) of old age/natural causes on a mountain; the film ends with him walking up the mountain.\n\nEl Cid (1961) [Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, El Cid]: Shot in the chest with an arrow during a battle with the Moors; he dies in Sophia Loren's arms shortly afterwards. His body (complete with limbs frozen in place and eyes open) is then mounted on a horse and sent back leading a battle (with a trained horse) to fool the Moors. (though some tv versions omit the last scene)\n\nThe Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) [John the Baptist]: Decapitated (off-screen) by Jose Ferrer's soldiers.\n\nThe Agony and the Ecstasy (1965) [Michelangelo]: Dies off-screen in 1564. His passing is only mentioned in Marvin Miller's opening narration. The film portrays his life many decades earlier.\n\nKhartoum (1966) [General Charles 'Chinese' Gordon]: Stabbed in the chest with a spear by a Muslim soldier as he approaches them; his severed head is later presented (out of camera frame) to Laurence Olivier.\n\nNumber One (1969) [Roy Catlan] Possibly dies after being tackled in a football game. The film leaves it to interpretation if his wound is fatal or not.\n\nBeneth the Planet of the Apes (1970) [George Taylor]: Shot by James Gregory; Charlton's hand falls on the switch of a doomsday bomb as he falls, destroying the Earth.\n\nThe Omega Man (1971) [Robert Neville]: Impaled through the chest with a spear when Anthony Zerbe throws it at him.\n\nThe Call of the Wild (1972) [John Thornton]: Shot in the back by Yeehat Indians with a shotgun and left trapped under the ice of a frozen lake towards the end of movie.\n\nAntony and Cleopatra (1972) [Marc Antony]: Commits suicide by throwing himself on his sword; he dies shortly afterwards while talking to Hildegarde Neil. (I haven't seen this version, but I'm familiar with the play.)\n\nSoylent Green (1973) [Thorn]: Shot through the back (exiting out of his stomach) by Chuck Connors. He manages to kill Chuck with a knife afterwards. He is last seen being carried away stating that the 'Soylent Green' product is made from people. (it's really not clear whether his wound was supposed to be fatal, but it'll be listed in case).\n\nEarthquake (1974) [Stewart Graff]: Drowned when he falls into the sewer system while trying to save Ava Gardner.\n\nThe Last Hard Men (1976) [Sam Burgade]; Still alive at the end of the film and being tended by Barbara Hershey and Christopher Mitchum after falling into a hole in the rocks having been shot in the side, the chest and twice in the back by James Coburn. As they are miles from any help it's almost certain he dies as indicated by the film's title.\n\nMidway (The Battle of Midway) (1976) [Captain Matthew Garth]: Killed in a plane crash when he tries to land his damaged fighter on an aircraft carrier.\n\nCrossed Swords (The Prince and the Pauper) (1977) [King Henry VIII]: Dies of sickness in bed, muttering of \"monks\" and as his court jester weeps nearby.\n\nThe Awakening (1980) [Matthew Corbeck]: Killed by the evil reincarnated queen Kara (Stephanie Zimbalist), who brings down a sarcophagus and a stone wall on top of him.\n\nMother Lode (Search for the Mother Lode; The Last Great Treasure) (1982) [Silas McGee/Ian McGee]: Falls to his death after being shot by Nick Mancuso.\n\nThe Return of the Musketeers (1989) [Cardinal Richelieu] Dies during the passage of time between the second film and this film in the series. He only appears in a painting and is briefly mentioned.\n\nIn the Mouth of Madness (1994) [Jackson Harglow]: Probably killed offscreen with most of the rest of humanity (his death is never confirmed, but it's strongly implied that Sam Neill is one of the few surviving humans in the final scene).\n\nHamlet (1996) [Player King]: Feigns being poisoned when another actor pours poison in his ear in a play-within-the-play sequence, while Kenneth Branagh watches Derek Jacobi's reaction in the audience.\n\nThe Order (2001) [Professor Walter Finley]: Shot in the chest in the crossfire of a shoot-out in the street; he dies shortly afterwards while talking to Jean-Claude Van Damme.\n\nPlanet of the Apes (2001) [Zaius, Thade's Father]: Dies of old age, while talking to his son (Tim Roth). (Both Charlton and Tim are wearing ape make-up for this film.)\n\nTelevision Deaths[]\n\nStudio One: Wuthering Heights (1950) [Heathcliff]: Dies of natural causes after years of being tormented by Catherine's ghost (Mary Sinclair).\n\nStudio One: Macbeth (1951) [Macbeth]: Stabbed to death in a swordfight with Darren McGavin, then beheaded.\n\nThe Outer Limits: Final Appeal (2000) [Chief Justice Haden Wainwright]: Incinerated by a cold-fusion device left behind by a Luddite-terrorist Ezekiel (Wallace Langham).\n\nGallery[]\n\nNotable Connections[]"
