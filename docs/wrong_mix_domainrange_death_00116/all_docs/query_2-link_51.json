        "text": "Charlton Heston, who won the 1959 best actor Oscar as the chariot-racing Ben-Hur and portrayed Moses, Michelangelo, El Cid and other heroic figures in movie epics of the '50s and '60s, has died. He was 84.\n\nThe actor died Saturday night at his home in Beverly Hills with his wife Lydia at his side, family spokesman Bill Powers said.\n\n-------------------\n\nGALLERY: The legend of Charlton Heston\n\n-------------------\n\nPowers declined to comment on the cause of death or provide further details.\n\nHeston revealed in 2002 that he had symptoms consistent with Alzheimer's disease, saying, \"I must reconcile courage and surrender in equal measure.\"\n\nWith his large, muscular build, well-boned face and sonorous voice, Heston proved the ideal star during the period when Hollywood was filling movie screens with panoramas depicting the religious and historical past.\n\n\"I have a face that belongs in another century,\" he often remarked.\n\nThe actor assumed the role of leader offscreen as well. He served as president of the Screen Actors Guild and chairman of the American Film Institute and marched in the civil rights movement of the 1950s.\n\nWith age, he grew more conservative and campaigned for conservative candidates.\n\nIn June 1998, Heston was elected president of the National Rifle Association, for which he had posed for ads holding a rifle.\n\nHe delivered a jab at then-President Bill Clinton, saying, \"America doesn't trust you with our 21-year-old daughters, and we sure, Lord, don't trust you with our guns.\"\n\nHeston stepped down as NRA president in April 2003, telling members his five years in office were \"quite a ride. ... I loved every minute of it\".\n\nThat same year, Heston was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honour.\n\n\"The largeness of character that comes across the screen has also been seen throughout his life,\" President George W Bush said at the time.\n\nHe engaged in a lengthy feud with liberal Ed Asner during the latter's tenure as president of the Screen Actors Guild.\n\nHis latter-day activism almost overshadowed his achievements as an actor, which were considerable.\n\nCharlton Heston's best know movies:\n\n* Peer Gynt, 1941: played the title role in his movie debut, which was made by a fellow Northwestern University student.\n\n* The Greatest Show on Earth, 1952: starred as the circus manager Brad Braden under the direction of Cecil B DeMille.\n\n* The Ten Commandments, 1956: played Moses in the biblical epic that was DeMille's last film as a director.\n\n* Touch of Evil, 1958: Heston was a Mexican narcotics official opposite Orson Welles; Heston reportedly insisted that Welles be allowed to direct the film, too.\n\n* Ben Hur, 1959: Heston won his only Academy Award for the title role; the movie also won 10 other Oscars, including best picture.\n\n* El Cid, 1961: another historical epic, co-starring Sophia Loren.\n\n* The Greatest Story Ever Told, 1965: played John the Baptist.\n\n* The Agony and the Ecstasy, 1965: portrayed Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel.\n\n* Planet of the Apes, 1968: Heston's astronaut character ends up in a world where apes are more advanced than men; snarled the memorable line \"Take your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape!\"\n\n* Will Penny, 1968: a Western that reportedly was Heston's favorite among his films."
