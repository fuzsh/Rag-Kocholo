After his premiership, Lubbers was a part-time Professor of Globalization from the spring of 1995 to the end of 2000. His interest in environmental and refugee issues was borne out, among other things, by his vice-presidency of the Independent World Commission on the Oceans and the presidency of the World Wildlife Fund. In that period, Lubbers aspired to become President of the European Commission but the German chancellor Helmuth Kohl is said to have opposed his bid. He also missed out on the leadership of NATO. At the end of 2000, Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, asked Lubbers to become the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Which he did.

Koen Becking: "Professor Lubbers in 013 rather than 010"

President of the Tilburg University Executive Board Koen Becking, appointed by Lubbers, wrote in Univers what Lubbers has meant for the university generally and for himself personally: "He really loved our university. As an economist and Rotterdam resident, Ruud Lubbers was nevertheless proud of Tilburg. After his impressive political career, he consciously chose a professorship in 013 (Tilburg) rather than in 010 (Rotterdam). He shared his anecdotes on that choice with man."

Professor Bastiaan Zoeteman: "Great man and great statesman"

Ruud Lubbers has met and touched many, many people as few others have done, Professor of Sustainability Policy in International Perspective Bastiaan Zoeteman writes in his In Memoriam. â€œI would like to call him a great man, and also a great statesman. Not because he was the longest serving prime minister of the Netherlands, but also because he had both the vision and the courage to make inspiring, and sometimes unexpected decisions and to stand by them. He could be very ordinary and unassuming one moment and be the man of the hour on the world stage the next."
