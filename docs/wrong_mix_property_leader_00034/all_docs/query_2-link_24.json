        "text": "A secret internal investigation carried out last year found the UN high commissioner for refugees, Ruud Lubbers, guilty of misconduct involving sexual harassment, it was revealed today.\n\nThe UN's internal oversight services (OIOS) found that the former Dutch prime minister had sexually harassed a 51-year-old female employee following a meeting in December 2003, according to an OIOS document obtained by the Independent. OIOS also concluded that Mr Lubbers had attempted to use his position to obstruct the investigation into the incident.\n\nThe 15-page report was handed to the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, last summer. After taking outside legal advice and listening to Mr Lubber's response to the report, Mr Annan decided to drop the case due to a lack of evidence.\n\nThe incident in question happened in UNHCR's Geneva offices on December 18 2003. The female employee told OIOS that as she rose to leave at the conclusion of a meeting with Mr Lubbers and two male colleagues, Mr Lubbers came up behind her. She told investigators that he put his hand on her waist, pulled her back towards him and pushed his groin into her.\n\n\"Mr Lubbers did engage in unwanted physical contact with a subordinate female staff member. New allegations that came to the OIOS's attention during the investigation were also examined and indicate a pattern of sexual harassment by Mr Lubbers,\" the OIOS report said.\n\nInvestigators spoke to four other women who made allegations of sexual misconduct against Mr Lubbers, but none would make an official complaint. Mr Lubbers said OIOS investigators had only brought one other case to his attention, and that it did not constitute sexual harassment.\n\nMr Lubbers told the Independent that the fact that Mr Annan had dropped the case exonerated him.\n\n\"Obviously, the secretary-general considered my response convincing, and the allegations and OIOS accusations unfounded,\" he said.\n\nLast year, Mr Annan's official spokesman told reporters that the secretary-general had found that the complaint against Mr Lubbers could not be sustained by the evidence.\n\n\"However, he has written to Mr Lubbers conveying his concerns and has sent his under-secretary-general for management, Catherine Bertini, to Geneva to consult with the high commissioner and his senior managers, as well as with the staff, to help them rebuild trust and confidence. He has also written a letter to all members of the High Commissioner's staff,\" the spokesman said in July. \"The secretary-general now considers this matter closed.\""
