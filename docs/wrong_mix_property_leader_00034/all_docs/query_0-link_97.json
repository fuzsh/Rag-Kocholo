        "text": "Even though homosexual acts and relationships take place all over the world cultures and communities approve of such behaviors to varying degrees. In the attempt to make homosexuality an accepted and visible part of Dutch society the Dutch Association for Integration of Homosexuality (COC) decided in the early 1970s to organize volunteer groups of gays and lesbians to offer education about homosexuality in a variety of institutions including schools. The COC has approximately 10000 members organized in thirty local branches all over the country. Each branch provides a meeting place self-help groups education to the general public individual counseling and care of gay and lesbian interests at the collective levels. All services are carried out by volunteer groups. The gay/lesbian education sessions in schools are organized by 34 groups of which 30 are part of COC branches and four of other regionally operating gay and lesbian groups. The groups consist of 2-25 members with usually as many men as women in each group. Secondary schools are the most targeted of groups within the school system. Research conducted in the Netherlands after 1977 found confusion about sexual feelings and orientation to be common among teens aged 12-16. Moreover there is also great pressure during these years to conform to heterosexual role models. This pressure and confusion makes it particularly difficult for young homosexuals and bisexuals to come to terms with their sexuality. Typically held during Social Studies and Biology courses in the thematic context of anti-Discrimination or sexuality education sessions are based upon a combination of personal stories of the gay/lesbian educators and questions from the students. The students tend to have many questions largely leading to whether homosexuality is &quot;normal&quot; or not. Since 1990 the Dutch government and educational institutions have shown greater interest in homosexuality. It was recognized after the publication of &quot;(Gay and Lesbian?) Sex Education&quot; that improving gay and lesbian health cannot be left only to unsupported community efforts. The need for education on sexual orientation and lifestyles in the context of health and sex education was therefore formally incorporated into the national curriculum guidelines. The National Institute for Curriculum Development tries to integrate gay and lesbian issues in relevant education materials. Moreover in 1993 the government funded a national conference and two brochures on gay and lesbian emancipation in primary and secondary schools. A more comprehensive effort is now needed to endorse support of all lifestyles."
