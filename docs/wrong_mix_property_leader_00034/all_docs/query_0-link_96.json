        "meta_description": "For the last quarter of a century, the Dutch government has been steadily liberalising and privatising its energy sector. Although this has filled shareholders’ pockets, households – especially those on lower incomes – have paid the costs. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, over half a million Dutch households were living in energy poverty. Two years on, this number has increased by nearly 20 per cent.1 The government has responded to the growing energy crisis by introducing a price cap that will likely cost tens of billions of euros.2 Although this policy has curbed household energy costs in the short term, it sees vast sums of taxpayers’ money used to secure energy company profits.",

        "text": "Until the end of the 1990s, energy was largely considered a public matter. The government was dominant in the electricity sector, with the national association of ‘Cooperating Electricity Producers’, consisting of four public power firms, Nuon, Delta, Essent and Eneco, largely responsible for the entire Dutch power system. These firms decided where and when power plants were built, which fuels were purchased and how power was transported over the high-voltage grid, which they also managed. This meant that the power price was determined jointly. Gas extraction, which has caused thousands of earthquakes in the Northern province of Groningen, has traditionally been outsourced to the two fossil energy giants Shell and ExxonMobil, together earning 64.7 billion euros in recent decades.4 However, energy transportation and supply were in the hands of government-owned GasUnie.\n\nThen in 1998, the Dutch government decided to liberalise the gas and electricity sectors, opening them up to foreign companies. The sectors were privatised, with public companies sold off to private actors. Electricity production, transmission and supply were unbundled, with different actors charged with responsibility for each formally separated sector. While the management of gas and electricity infrastructure remained in public hands, production and supply of energy were privatised. Over the years, municipal and regional governments sold their shares in Nuon, Delta, Essent and Eneco to multinationals such as Vattenfall (Sweden), RWE (Germany) and Mitsubishi (Japan). As a result, public authorities lost the ability to own and govern energy generation. This is reflected today in their reluctance to own and operate renewable power plants.\n\nBy 2021, electricity generation had been concentrated in the hands of five big power producers: Vattenfall, Eneco, RWE, Uniper and Engie. Around 30 energy retail companies sell power to businesses and households; some of these are owned by the same five electricity companies. The Consumer and Market Authority (ACM) has been given the task of overseeing both sectors and ensuring that market policies are adhered to, even if this is at the expense of climate policy. For example, the ACM blocked the government’s decision to shut down five ageing coal-fired power plants, claiming the decision amounted to a 'cartel agreement' and violated the rules of a 'free energy market'.5 In response, the Dutch government bypassed this ruling by demanding 40 per cent efficiency from coal-fired power plants, which was practically unachievable.6 In 2017, the last coal-fired power plant was shut down.7 The conclusion: this kind of climate action has not happened because of energy liberalisation, but in spite of it.\n\nThe liberalisation and privatisation of the Dutch energy sector was encouraged by European Union policies, largely for the purpose of accommodating Dutch business interests. Powerful companies had long complained that they were losing out to German industry because of higher energy prices. It was argued that the Netherlands must remain competitive in the European and international market because market forces and competition between energy providers would ensure lower prices. It was also claimed that households would benefit from lower energy tariffs and the opportunity to choose between suppliers. Households were given this choice in 2004, although 95 per cent of consumers surveyed said they did not see any benefit in it.8\n\nFor many citizens, however, energy bills went up. Market policies have allowed energy companies to pass on the higher purchase price of gas to consumers more quickly, leaving consumers less protected from price fluctuations than those in neighbouring countries. Meanwhile, taxes make up almost a third of a household’s gas bill.9 In turn, households in the Netherlands pay more than twice as much for gas as the average EU household.10 When it comes to electricity, Dutch households pay on everage almost 30 per cent more than their European counterparts.11 In the early 1990s, electricity prices in the Netherlands were below the European average. Since the privatisation wave, the Netherlands has consistently been among the most expensive countries.12 As a result, around 2,000 households were cut off from gas and electricity in 2022.13\n\nThat said, the cost of producing power has gone down thanks to privatisation. In 2008, the Ministry of Economy concluded that electricity production had become cheaper. However, academic research on the effects of electricity privatisations across Europe shows that this so-called ‘efficiency gain’ is often the result of cost-saving measures.14 Consider, for example, the estimated 10,000 jobs in the power sector that were cut in the liberalisation years before 2005.15 Such cost savings did make power generation cheaper. However, the benefits ended up as profits in the pockets of shareholders, while households were saddled with ever-higher bills.16\n\nLiberalisation advocates also promised to increase innovation and enhance service quality. Yet as the Dutch research firm CE Delft pointed out in 2003, market policies have increased spending on advertising and marketing and decreased spending on research and development, innovation and quality improvements. Other studies referred to by CE Delft also conclude that ‘large-scale market players are reluctant [to] take the lead in new energy technologies as the status quo has worked in their favour in the past.’17 This all begs the question of how, then, market actors are engaging with the energy transition.\n\nMarket approaches have drastically curtailed the role the Dutch government can play in a just energy transition, which cannot succeed without significantly reducing the country’s energy use. The government urgently needs to oversee a reduction in energy use, especially by large companies. Companies have been required to save energy since 1993, but for a long time this was not enforced. This is now changing, but inspectors are still only allowed to impose an energy-saving measure if it pays for itself within five years. For example, supermarkets have been able to refuse to install doors on their refrigerators for years.\n\nThe stubborn insistence of past administrations on non-binding agreements with companies has rarely led to the envisioned increase in sustainability, especially when it comes to the country's biggest polluters. Until Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Netherland’s 430 largest CO2 emitters were exempt from any obligations to reduce their energy consumption. Meanwhile, the government encourages energy savings with financial incentives, such as taxes and subsidies, which have had regressive socio-economic impacts and worsened inequality. For example, in recent years, households and small consumers were paying for energy transition policies through their energy bills, while the proceeds were given as subsidies to wealthy producers and large consumers.\n\nTake the case of Swedish multinational Vattenfall, which received more than half a billion euros in public funds between 2015 and 2020, on top of the 900 million in subsidies promised for upcoming projects. During this period, the amount of renewable electricity Vattenfall Netherlands generated almost halved. This did not stop the company from making 387 million euros in profit, while also paying out more than a billion euros to its sole shareholder, the Swedish state.18 This way, hundreds of millions of euros in public funds are flowing away – public funds that are desperately needed for the energy transition.\n\nWhat’s worse, investors tend to receive far more subsidies than strictly necessary, according to research by Daan Hulsthof, a researcher at the University of Groningen.19 Companies simply cherry-pick the projects where they can make the most profit, with profits sometimes as high as 50 per cent. Hulsthof, in collaboration with research platform Follow the Money, calculated that shareholder profits can be as much as 384 million euros higher than the subsidy scheme envisages.20\n\nThe Netherlands’ privatisation policies have dangerously delayed the energy transition. According to EU climate targets, 14 per cent of national energy consumption should have come from renewable energy sources in 2020, but based on domestic production, the Netherlands only achieved 11.1 per cent.21 In response, the government imported 200 million euros worth of green electricity from Denmark. Without this 'statistical transfer', the Netherlands would not have met the EU target. By 2023, solar energy and offshore wind have grown rapidly, but the Netherlands’ share of renewable energy in 2021 was still much lower than the European average.22\n\nMoreover, the government plans to phase out subsidies for small-scale solar farms from 2025 onwards. Energy transition developments in countries like Germany and the United Kingdom have shown that once government support for renewable energy declines, private investment drops as well. If high energy prices persist, this may be less of a concern – but in that scenario, the Dutch population will continue to subsidise excessive profits through their energy bills.\n\nTo turn the tide of the climate and energy crises, civil society is increasingly arguing for de-marketising the energy sector and ending the Netherland’s reliance on big business for the energy transition. By de-privatising and democratising the energy system, the country can start prioritising energy for essential goods and services, from food and medicine to healthcare, water and public transport, while phasing out unnecessary and polluting energy consumption.\n\nAccording to some climate justice organisations – in the Netherlands and elsewhere23 – citizen-owned decentralised renewable energy generation alone can meet the country’s energy needs. However, calculations show that rooftop solar, which citizen collectives lead on, could only cover around 18 per cent of the current electricity mix.24\n\nTo secure, scale up and complement decentralised production we must move beyond a liberalised energy market, which inevitably sees small-scale energy initiatives outcompeted by big business – around 30 energy suppliers have gone bankrupt in recent years. Instead, we need a fully public, democratic and cooperative energy system. This means a public utility collaborating with municipalities and provinces to roll out public solar and wind projects all over the country, in tandem with cooperatives and other citizen collectives. It means government guaranteeing the costs of new renewable generating projects, instead of subsidising private profits. And it means introducing new democratic mechanisms within the public utility to enable citizens to participate in local to national energy policy-making.\n\nMore solar and wind power will not on its own transition the energy system. Simultaneously, we need a planned phase out of fossil fuels. While divestment campaigns may push multinationals such as Shell and ExxonMobil to sell off their climate-wrecking assets, as the business practices of Engie, British Gas and E.ON demonstrate, investors are likely to continue to fund fossil fuel extraction as usual. That’s why the Netherlands must collectively expropriate -- i.e. nationalise, and democratise – these corporations. Only in this way can we plan a rapid decommissioning of all fossil fuel plants in the country and ramp up publicly owned renewable generation and storage.\n\nThe Dutch government and the EU have a stake in answering key questions around this popular expropriation – questions including the amount of compensation to be offered to incumbent private actors. However, participatory deliberation from people across the country must inform these decisions. Indeed, Dutch citizens and in particular working class people need a say in how these multinationals are transformed, dismantled and held liable to restore the ecosystems they have destroyed, in cooperation with affected communities worldwide.\n\nThe government’s recent decision to withdraw from the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) illustrates its capacity to challenge corporate power. This international trade treaty, which was in part designed by former Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers in the early 1990s, is used by multinationals to sue national governments when climate policies stand in the way of their profits.25 The ECT helps companies and investors take maximum advantage of the liberalisation of the energy market. For instance, Uniper and RWE have sued the Dutch government for billions of euros because the 2019 coal ban affected their future profits. After years of campaigning by the Handel Anders! coalition – with organisations such as the Dutch chapter of Friends of the Earth (Milieudefensie), the Federation of Dutch Trade Unions (FNV) and the Transational Institute (TNI) – the Dutch government decided to leave the ECT. Soon after, Spain, France and Germany followed suit.\n\n57 per cent of the Dutch population now believe that energy supply should come into public hands.26 However, many energy ‘experts’ in the Netherlands are still convinced that the sector is better off privatised, arguing that system change towards a public system would be too lengthy a process. This view ignores the fact that the Netherlands lost precious transition years precisely because of market forces and privatisation. As the population is increasingly in favour of a clean and public energy model, labour and environmental justice organisations could build support for growing public capacity in the energy sector. As a first step, they could make the case for insourcing renewable energy production and supply, instead of outsourcing this. Insourcing would not only increase public control, it would also ensure that knowledge and infrastructure around the energy transition come under collective management.\n\nFinally, the struggle for public energy should go hand in hand with demands on the government to defend and fulfil people’s right to energy via progressive tariffs that take people’s energy needs and ability to pay into account. Moving from regressive to progressive tariffs would make it possible to provide every resident with a tax-funded basic energy budget. It would also enable policy-makers to increase tariffs for non-essential consumption. In this way, the Netherlands could build a more energy-conscious culture, while at the same time forcing highly polluting companies to cut their emissions."
