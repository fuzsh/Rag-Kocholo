Cas Spijkers, a renowned chef, prepared the lunch, but Ruud sent it back, requesting ‚Äújust a sandwich‚Äù. \n\nCas was not amused.\n\nOnce, Ruud unexpectedly showed up at my door. He was older then and visiting a politician who lived below me. Confused, Ruud asked for help with the parking meter. I assisted him‚Äîa charming encounter, though I regret not inviting him in for coffee.\n\nWhat a flood of memories an old illustration can bring back.\n\nüî•üî•üî•\n\nAnd speaking of creativity, I‚Äôm hosting a masterclass on collage-making on June 2nd!\nIt‚Äôs a day to honor the art of collage. It may seem simple, but it demands a fresh perspective. Join me for what‚Äôs sure to be a super fun and creative day. Find the details in my bio.\n\nM‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\n#carp #editorial #editorialillustration #collage #collageart #ruudlubbers #primeminister #magazine #lillarogers #marenthe #theartbeatclub\".",
