        "text": "Officially formed in August 1996, some 20 months after Delors had returned to Paris from Brussels, the association began operating the following January. Its remit is to study and conduct research on Europe, examining its past, its various civilisations, its progress towards closer union and the outlook for the future.\n\nWith a small, six-strong team in Paris under the association’s secretary-general Christine Verger (a former adviser to Delors in Brussels and now seconded from the Commission to work at Notre Europe), the association is actively looking to collaborate with outside researchers and intellectuals on its ventures.\n\nNotre Europe’s undoubted strength lies in the membership of its 21-strong board. It is a list which would open doors almost anywhere in the Union. In addition to Delors, it includes former premiers such as Spain’s Felipe González and the Netherlands’ Ruud Lubbers, former Portuguese President Mario Soares and ex-Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky.\n\nThe one-time Irish and Belgian European Commissioners Peter Sutherland and Viscount Davignon also feature, as do various other prominent politicians and businessmen. They include Delors’ former chef de cabinet Pascal Lamy, now a board member of Crédit Lyonnais, and one of the founding members of the Brussels-based European Policy Centre Max Kohnstamm.\n\nWith that political punch behind it, messages from Notre Europe are bound to have a certain resonance. So it proved earlier this year when another board member Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, now one of the small group running the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, presented proposals to politicise the European debate.\n\nHe suggested that each of Europe’s main political families should campaign in next year’s Euro-elections behind their preferred candidate for the post of European Commission president.This was seen by some as a way of preparing the way for either González from the centre left or Sutherland from the centre right to get the job.\n\nThe suggestion was designed to stir up voter interest in the elections and increase the political authority of the Commission president.It may not come to fruition as EU leaders, who currently decide who should hold the post, will be unwilling to relinquish their grip on the process. But it has certainly fuelled a debate on the issue.\n\nOther activities have had a lower profile. After the outcry over car manufacturer Renault’s decision to close its Vilvoorde car plant in Belgium, Notre Europe tried to set the debate on Europe’s social future in a wider historical context with the publication of a report by one of its collaborators, Jean-Louis Arnaud, on a new model for development.\n\nNot surprisingly, given Delors’ own keen interest in such issues, the association has so far tended to focus on social, employment and monetary union questions. It is likely to continue to do so. In Delors and its board members, it will have powerful speakers who will make sure its views are heard in the right places."
