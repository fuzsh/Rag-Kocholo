        "text": "In 1994 the Dutch division of Green Cross International (GCI) came into being. Together with Japan, Russia, Switzerland, and the United States, we then formally joined GCI. This took place in the presence of, among many others, former Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers. Directors of the first hour were e.g. Rabbi Awraham Soetendorp and former ministers Erica Terpstra and Pieter Winsemius.\n\nIn the beginning, Green Cross was led by Bart Jan Krouwel. In 2002 he was awarded the title ‘Environmental Professional of the Year’. Bart Jan is also co-founder of the Triodos Bank and became the first CEO of this idealistic bank in 1980. Later on, he was involved with the founding of the ‘Onderlinge Ziektekostenverzekering Medios’ en the ‘Anthroposophic Medical Centre Berg and Bosch’ (currently closed). In 1996 he became Director of Sustainability and Social Innovation at Rabobank Netherlands.\n\nAfter a period of relatively little activity, at the end of 2018, we gathered a diverse and committed team to put Green Cross Netherlands back on the map. Read more about why here.\n\nGreen Cross Netherland has its headquarters in Nijmegen, the oldest city of The Netherlands. Nijmegen was awarded the title ‘European Green Capital’ in 2018.\n\nNijmegen City Promo 2018"
