        "text": "An American woman who accuses former Dutch prime minister turned UN diplomat Ruud Lubbers of sexual intimidation is asking the US courts to lift Lubbers’ diplomatic immunity so he can face charges.\n\nCynthia Brzak claims she was subjected to unwanted physical contact with Lubbers at a UN meeting in 2003. Lubbers was the UN’s high commissioner for refugees at the time.\n\nAn internal UN report published in 2004 did find in her favour but former UN chief Kofi Annan said there was not enough evidence. Lubbers resigned from the position in 2005.\n\nIn March, the New York appeal court said Lubbers would not face any charges because the UN and UN staff enjoy immunity from prosecution in this sort of case."
