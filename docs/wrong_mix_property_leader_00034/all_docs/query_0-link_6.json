        "text": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands — Ruud Lubbers, who as the Netherlands’ longest serving prime minister led his country through economic turmoil to prosperity and helped shape the foundations of the European Union, died Wednesday. He was 78.\n\nNo cause of death was given.\n\nPrime Minister Mark Rutte hailed Mr. Lubbers, who led the Dutch government from 1982 to 1994, as a statesman who dragged the Netherlands through tough economic times.\n\n‘‘With his broad knowledge and experience and his tireless creativity, he knew how to find a solution for every problem,’’ Rutte said on Facebook.\n\nMr. Lubbers’s conservative economic policies were in step with his counterparts in Washington and London during the 1980s. He trimmed the welfare state, persuaded powerful labor unions to rein in demands, and ushered in years of growth.\n\nMr. Lubbers’s international reputation suffered in 2005 when he was forced to step down as UN High Commissioner for Refugees in a sex harassment scandal. He maintained his innocence as he resigned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn economist by training, Mr. Lubbers believed the size of the Dutch government had become a hindrance to the country’s economic health.\n\nWith the words ‘‘Holland is sick,’’ he argued that generous disability and unemployment benefits had become fiscally unsustainable and that too many people took advantage of them simply to avoid working.\n\nHe was sometimes criticized as too willing to compromise on principles, but to supporters he was a pragmatist and a dealmaker. Carrying the Dutch tradition of consensus politics forward, Mr. Lubbers struck agreements with unions to limit wage growth in exchange for low unemployment, and curtailed government spending.\n\n‘‘More markets, less government’’ was a favorite campaign slogan of his.\n\nGet Globe Weather Forecast\n\nYour essential daily forecast, delivered daily at 6:30 am.\n\nEnter Email"
