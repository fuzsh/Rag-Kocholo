        "text": "If every tin of baked beans in your supermarket has been snapped up, fear not, I'm here to tell you that you can still have your beans and eat them too.\n\nI’ve got the ultimate bunker down recipe for self-isolation today. It’s fun to make, healthy and tastes even better than the tinned thing.\n\nPlus it only takes 15 minutes to get this good boy onto the table and it's so simple you could make it blindfolded with one hand tied behind your back. (I am not suggested you do this by the way!)\n\nTo create this formidable breakfast, I’m using white Cannellini beans, known for their mild and smooth flavour. Did you know that home-cooked baked beans are surprisingly packed with nutrients? They’re a wonderfully nutritious ingredient with folate, iron and magnesium. In addition they’re full of fibre and protein so will support gut health, and promote the balance and population of microorganisms.\n\nIf you’re interested in gut health, check out our Love Your gut powder here. The fibre in the beans helps you feel full and slows down digestion, which can help prevent blood sugar spikes and drops. These benefits alone make Cannellini beans the cheapest superfood on the market today! Especially if you’re on a budget right now as many of us are.\n\nSo what are you waiting for, bring on the beans! Lets make tinned beans HAS BEANS and lessen the sodium and heapings of sugar from the canned variety.\n\nThis dish is the ultimate comfort food for a lockdown situation and will bring you much comfort and satisfaction. I recommend having it with my Best Scrambled Eggs you will Ever Eat.\n\nThe good news is, that with minimal effort, you can gain back the bean and incorporate it into your hearty breakfast, just by following these few simple steps.\n\nI really hope you enjoy it!\n\nLet me know what you think in the comments section below.\n\nWatch a video here about how to make it.\n\nPs Occasionally beans can make certain people bloated, all you need to do is just rinse them (even the canned varieties) a couple of times before using to help alleviate this!\n\nBunker Baked Beans on Toast\n\nServes 2\n\nIngredients\n\n2 slices bread for toasting\n\nBeans\n\n1 tsp chopped garlic\n\n2 tsps mustard (or to your preference)\n\n1/2 cup passata (tomato puree)\n\nA good glug of tamari (or soya or Worcestershire sauce)\n\n1 can cannellini beans (rinsed)\n\n1-2 TBS maple syrup or sweetener of choice\n\n1 tsp apple cider vinegar\n\nLove Your gut powder (optional)\n\nsalt and pepper to taste\n\nMethod\n\nIn a medium saucepan spray with olive oil\n\nPlace garlic and stir then add mustard and stir, then add all remaining ingredients and cook for 7-10 mins to thicken and reduce sauce\n\nPlace bread in toaster and when cooked to your liking, pile beans on top\n\nLee x"
