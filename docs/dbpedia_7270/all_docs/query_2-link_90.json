This historical narrative was prepared at the request of the Office of Naval Intelligence and in accordance with the Director of Naval History directive, Serial CL-162 of 14 February 1945. It is based principally on printed and manuscript records in the files of the Office of Naval Records and Library, the most important of which (for its recent accomplishments and history) were the day to day War Diary and Progress Reports maintained during the war by officers of the staff. Personal recollections of these officers frequently \"spliced out\" such official sources and provided considerable additional and valuable material.\n\n2. Although the directive called for an appraisement of activities from 1919 to date, it was believed a convenient opportunity to review the entire history of the Office of Naval Records and Library from its inception of 1882. Such additional information, it is believed, will be useful in providing a background of prewar functions and purposes for those not familiar with its earlier existence, as well as for planning and appraising the place of the Office of Naval Records and Library in the postwar naval establishment.\n\nPart I: Period from 1882-1917 -- Origins to World War I\n\nThe Naval Library was established as a departmental institution and became recognized as such through an Act of Congress in 1882, which directed each head of the department to ascertain and report at the beginning of the next session of Congress \"...the conditions of the several libraries in his department, number of volumes in each, and plan for consolidation of the same so that there should be but one library in each department.\"1 By a general order of 23 March2 in the same year, \"to collect and record information of value in war or peace\", an Office of Naval Intelligence had been created in the Bureau of Navigation, where to facilitate its establishment and carry out its purposes, the new intelligence branch was combined with the existing bureau library.\n\nThe departmental library, like other offices of the Navy, at this time had only recently moved into new quarters in the State, War and Navy Building, then under construction at the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and 17th Street, where it was \"...located on the fourth floor of the east wing looking over the beautiful grounds of the White House, the Potomac River and the Park in the distance. The reception and reading room was 50 feet wide by 55 feet long and it had extended up two stories. Overhead was a beautiful dome of stained glass. The ceiling of this room was frescoed and studded with gold stars to represent the firmament.\"3\n\nOn 9 June 1882 Professor James Russel Soley, USN, was assigned to duty in the Bureau of Navigation as officer-in-charge of the newly consolidated departmental library. The appointment proved to be an extremely fortunate one from every point of view, for not only was Soley exceptionally well-qualified and enthusiastic for the work, but more important, continued his sympathetic interest in the library after 1889 when he was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy. He at once began formulating plans to salvage and collect the few rare books still scattered through the different bureaus; to gather up old prints and photographs of naval battles and American or Foreign war vessels; to subscribe for all historical, professional and scientific periodicals; to classify and catalogue this material; and generally to lay the foundation of the present-day naval library.\n\nMeanwhile, the first legislative appropriation for books for the departmental library was made and became available on 1 July 1883.4 In addition to an appropriate of $2500 for the purchase of technical books and magazines, this Act of 5 August 1882 also made provision for one clerk and one assistant messenger to be carried on the Secretary's office appropriation for the care of the library. After this original grant, however, Congressional generosity towards the new library waned in the next session for in the annual report for 1885, the Chief of Bureau of Navigation reported:5 \"Department Library. During the past year the Library has continued to receive valuable additions by gift and by purchase, and the classification and cataloguing of books has been nearly completed. The reduction of the annual appropriation from $2500 to $1000, made by the appropriation Act of last year, is a serious obstacle to the improvement and growth of the Library, which has been steadily in progress since 1882.\"\n\nThus within a few years of the date of its establishment, the Naval Library was located in permanent quarters designed for the purpose in the new State, War and Navy Building; provided for in mat√©riel and funds by Congressional Acts; staffed with an authorized complement of civilian employees; and supervised and directed by an exceptionally qualified naval officer.\n\n___________\n\n1. Public Act No. 217 of 7 August 1882. In response on 15 November 1882, Captain John Grimes Walker, USN, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, reported to the Secretary of the Navy that there were approximately 7,000 books on hand in the departmental library, mostly relics of old ships' libraries, and further stated that these were of comparatively little value.\n\n2. General Order No. 292 of 23 March 1882. In 1889 the Office of Intelligence was transferred to the Secretary's Office, where it remained until the outbreak of the Spanish American War, when it was again transferred to the Bureau of Navigation. The Library was left under the Secretary until 1919.\n\n3. Rear Admiral Elliot Snow, CC, USN, Historical Sketch of the Navy Department Library and War Records, March 1926. (Manuscript in files of Naval Historical Foundation.)\n\n4. Public Act of 5 August 1882.\n\n5. Report of the Secretary of the Navy, 1885, Vol. I. The report continued, \"...There is certainly no object for which money may be expanded more productive of direct benefit than the formation and maintenance of the collection of books of professional reference for the Navy Department, and the crippling of this important work cannot be compensated by a saving to the Government of $1500....\"\n\nNaval Records\n\nEarly naval records like those in most other departments of the Government were considered the property of the various bureaus, offices, or even officials themselves, and usually remained in the haphazard custody of their respective originators. The Act of 17906 which separated naval from military functions by creating a department of the Navy, provided under Section 3, that the new Secretary of the Navy was authorized and empowered to take possession of all the records, books, and documents relevant to naval matters, then deposited in the office of the Secretary of War.\n\nTo this inheritance of original archives, the Secretary of the Navy's office had added many of its own plus those created by the Board of Naval Commissioners which was established in 1815 under his superintendence.\n\nSection 8 of the Act of 1842 which reorganized the Department of the Navy into several major bureaus, and repealed the Naval Commissioners' Act,7 directed \"...that the books, records, and papers now belonging to the office of Naval Commissioners shall be distributed among the bureaus according to the nature of their duties respectively; and the Secretary of the Navy is hereby authorized to provide for each bureau such books of records and accounts . . . as may be further necessary...\"\n\nThe nature of the duties and activities of the new Bureau of Navigation proved to be most varied and widespread and as a consequence, this branch inherited many more records from the Secretary's and Commissioners' offices than did any of the other newly created bureaus. It was not until 1881, however, that serious thought was given to any plan for the Navy Department itself to collect and publish some of the source materials in the bureaus' files.8\n\nWhen Captain John Grimes Walker, USN, was appointed Chief of the Bureau of Navigation in 1881, the first departmental project of such a nature was undertaken when he began the task of collecting records of Union and Confederate naval operations during the war between the states with a view to eventual publication of the material. The work was carried on under his direction for three years until the value of the Bureau of Navigation's efforts to prepare its civil war records for publication was recognized in July 1884 and legislation enacted similar to that which provided funds and personnel for the departmental library in 1882. This latest Act carried the first appropriation for collecting, compiling and arranging the naval records of the War of the Rebellion,9 whereby a sum of $2640 was provided for the services of one clerk and two copyists to perform work on naval records is distinct from another fund of $1800 for one clerk and messenger in the library.\n\nAlthough separate appropriations were thus made for the clerical staffs working with war records and in the library, both activities, under the joint title of \"Office of Library and Naval War Records\", were supervised by Professor Soley. In his dual capacity as officer-in-charge of the Library and Naval War Records, Professor Soley acquired additional space on the fifth floor adjacent to the Library in the State, War and Navy Building for a \"record office,\" and here the work of copying and preparing material for publication \"went forward rapidly.\" The original complement of three workers in the War Records office was increased in 1888 when Congress appropriated sufficient funds to employ six additional clerks.10\n\nIn October 1889, Lieutenant Commander F.M. Wise, USN, succeeded Professor Soley as librarian and \"in charge of War Records\", when the latter was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy. By fortunate coincidence, the Office of Library and Naval War Records was at this time transferred from the Bureau of Navigation and placed under the Secretary's Office. Further evidence of the change in opinion as to the importance of the work of the \"records office\" likewise is indicated in a circular letter to the Chiefs of the Bureaus, over the signature of B.F. Tracy, the Secretary of the Navy, which directed that \"...the officer-in-charge of the Naval War Records Office will hereafter be designated, Superintendent, Naval War Records.\"11\n\nThrough the efforts of the newly appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy, additional personnel were authorized next year and the two staffs assigned to the Library and Naval War Records were increased to three and fourteen clerks respectively. At this figure, office personnel remained practically constant for the next 28 years until the influx of World War I records in 1918 necessitated further expansion of the office force.\n\nIn 1894, the sum of $15,000 was authorized for printing the official records of the Union and Confederate navies in the War of the Rebellion, the first in a long series of Congressional appropriations provided annually until 1915.12 Five volumes of Civil War material were printed during 1895, 1896 and 1897 under the direction of Captain Richard Rush, who had succeeded Wise in 1893, and one volume followed each year thereafter during the incumbency of Professor E.K. Rawson, USN, as Superintendent, Naval War Records until 20 September 1902. A paucity of source material of Confederate origin (confirmed by appearance in print of these first volumes) resulted in a request that an agent be appointed in the War Records Section to seek out and collect official records of both the Union and Confederate Navies from other than sources available at the Department. \"...The agent authorized by Congress for that purpose has continued his inquires, especially for Confederate material, of which there is little to be obtained, the greater part of the official documents having been destroyed at the close of the War. He has interested many people to make searches for such papers as are pertinent for publication. The amount for traveling expenses for this purpose has been reduced from year to year in the interest of economy, but at present is sufficient for all practical purposes.\"13 Seventeen additional volumes were published between the year 1902 and World War I, during a period in which Mr. Charles Stewart, formerly Chief Clerk of the office, was acting Superintendent of War Records. \"...The Naval War Records furnish the best data for the study of the naval history of the Civil War and the methods by which a legal blockade was maintained along nearly 4,000 miles of coast line . . . The operations of the Confederate Navy are completely presented here for the first time in history. These records, including the construction, equipment, and performance of ironclads, cruisers, torpedoes, and torpedo boats, stand as a monument to the energy, skill, and daring of Confederate naval officers and sailors . . . The compilers of these records have endeavored to make these volumes compact in material, and in addition general operations, have relegated to a second series the reports, orders and correspondence as is indicated in the preface to each volume relating to:\n\nThe condition of the Union Navy in 1861, before the commencement of hostilities, and to its increase during the progress of the war, including the annual and special reports of the Secretary of the Navy and chiefs of various bureaus.\n\nThe construction and outfit of the Confederate Navy, including the privateers, setting forth also the annual and special reports of the Confederate Secretary of the Navy and chiefs of bureaus.\n\nStatistical data of all vessels, Union and Confederate.\n\nReturns of naval and military property captured.\n\nCorrespondence relating to naval prisoners....14\n\nMeanwhile, the comparatively neglected earlier records of the Navy Department were beginning to receive attention as a result of separate legislative Acts passed by Congress in 1904 and 1906.15 The first of these in 1904 directed that all naval records, etc., \"...from the beginning of the Navy Department to the War of the Rebellion shall be transferred to the Secretary of the Navy to be preserved....\"; while the second, two years later, directed that all records, etc., in the War of the Revolution then in any of the executive departments be transferred to the Secretary fo the Navy to be preserved, indexed and prepared for publication.\n\nCongress was being awakened to a belated realization that many official records of the period of the Revolution were scattered throughout Archives of several states, historical societies, libraries and private collectors, and a third piece of legislation in 191316 authorized the collection of military and naval records of the Revolutionary War with a view to their publication, and appropriated for the purpose $25,000 for the War Department and $7,000 for the Navy Department. \"...The Commission which started this work very soon decided that their funds would limit effort to a few states and decided to concentrate on Massachusetts, Virginia and North Carolina. Even in this restricted field it was further impossible to be thorough. For example all that could be done in Massachusetts was to photostat from the State Archives, the Massachusetts Board of War matters, orders and letters (2,914 documents), and from the Harvard University library, Hamilton's Journal of the Vincennes Expedition (77 documents). The Commission ceased its work in 1914 on account of exhaustion of funds....\"17\n\nOn 4 March 1915, the Legislative Act consolidate the two appropriations heretofore made for the Library and the Office of Naval Records into one lump sum and the office received the title of \"Office of Naval Records and Library.\"\n\n___________\n\n6.

Knox, \"Our Vanishing History and Traditions,\" USN Institute Proceedings, January 1926.\n\nPart II: Period from 1917-1921 -- Period of World War I and Postwar Era\n\nWorld War I may be said to being the transition in the Office of Naval Records and Library, between an era of custodianship and primary concern with records of the past and a period of active selection, collection and classification of data on current naval operations.\n\nIn 1917 with the publication of Volume 27, the Office of Naval Records and Library suspended further work on this Civil War records project and shifted its emphasis to matters of contemporary historical importance, such activities of the Office having increased considerably. All during the war the Library was the mecca for news correspondents and others utilizing its reference facilities for information on treaties, international law, and subjects related to the war, and in addition, a great many ranking naval officers, allied officials and members of the government were frequent visitors. Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy in President Wilson's cabinet, during his long tenure of office, used the Library facilities more than any previous Secretary. At other times, the reading room was also used for confidential conferences on anti-submarine warfare devices, models of which could be displayed on the library table, or as a lecture hall where escort duties and the convoy system were explained to embryonic subchaser skippers.18\n\nPrior to 1917 it was generally accepted that the principal function of the section was to take charge of the Navy Department's earliest books, manuscripts, historical material and old records and no plan to collect and to make current records available for contemporary and future historical or official purposes apparently had ever been contemplated by the Office of Naval Records. The idea that such a project should be undertaken by the Navy seems to have originated as a result of an announcement on 3 June 1918 that the War Department was beginning work on and proposed to \"...publish a History of the War of 1917....\" In a letter soliciting active cooperation, Secretary Newton B. Baker informed the Secretary of the Navy that the Army, in its War History, tentatively planned to include one volume treating of naval operations.19 Instead of appointing a naval officer to serve as liaison with the Historical Branch in the War Department for that purpose however, the Navy decided to initiate a similar work and produce a separate story of naval operations during the war.\n\nWithin a few weeks, Admiral Sims commanding United States Naval Forces Operating in European Waters, who had been instructed on 25 June 1918 to ascertain what was being done in the matter of collecting historical data on English, French or Italian naval operations by the respective allied powers,20 reported after a comprehensive survey that Great Britain already had a large staff of experts organized under the War Cabinet compiling and arranging material for its naval, military and air force histories. The naval section under Sir Julian Corbett, comprising four officers and twelve civilians especially qualified for the duty, had been granted access to all records, reports, dispatches and ships' logs in custody of the Admiralty. Sims proposed21 that a similar arrangement be instituted at his headquarters and that the American staff be authorized to visit other naval bases for the purpose of gathering data of historical value.\n\nOn 18 August 1918, shortly after such a recommendation was made, the Secretary of the Navy issued a Circular Notice22 stating that \"...a History Section has been established under the direction of the Chief of Operations....\" and directing that the collecting of historical material be carried on until the end of the War. The circular emphasized that no hampering or interference with the war effort should be permitted to occur in obtaining information. Recognition of the importance of the historical aspects of naval operations and the growing volume of current war records resulted in the appointment of Rear Admiral W.W. Kimball, USN (Ret.) as head of the new section.\n\nIn London, in compliance with the Secretary's order, Admiral Sims in October 1918 created an Historical Section in the staff of the U.S. Naval Forces Operating in European Waters. In an exchange of dispatches and correspondence with OPNAV, about this time, Admiral Sims stressed the importance of adding trained historians to his staff, but before properly qualified officer could be selected for the historical project and sent to London, the Armistice was declared. Though the cessation fo hostilities on 11 November 1918 precluded sending an history section abroad, it released many of the Admiral's staff whose service could be utilized for the collection of source materials for the proposed naval history. By early 1919, Commodore (then Captain) Dudley W. Knox, USN, previously of the Plans Section, who had been designated head of the project in London, had a staff of approximately 20 officers and 50 enlisted men engaged in the task of collecting documents of historical value in connection with the proposed history of naval operations in the war against the Central Powers.\n\nThis collection was principally composed of Admiral Sims' weekly reports to Chief of Naval Operations -- the headquarters War Diary; the intelligence division's weekly information bulletins; the monthly operational reports received in London from other Force Commanders; and the Admiral's personal official correspondence on the general naval policy, strategy and administration of our forces in Europe. There likewise was included considerable material from the files sent to London after the Armistice by the subordinate commands as they became inactivated in England, Ireland, France, Italy, the Azores and Gibraltar.\n\nWhere the London staff found gaps to exist in their files, efforts were made to obtain copies of missing portions from appropriate English, French or other sources. The collection also included statements, summaries, and narratives prepared by those staff members or officers most concerned or familiar with certain aspects of operations in the several areas of naval activities, such material being incorporated under the appropriate headings.\n\nThe system based somewhat on the experience of the Admiralty's Historical section, comprised four general archival divisions of operational material:\n\nWar Diaries, Log Books, etc.\n\nTelegrams, by chronology within geographical areas.\n\nGeneral correspondence, similarly filed.\n\nSubject files -- documents whose bulk, scope or nature made them inappropriate for chronological files.\n\nThe telegrams were eventually merged with the chronological correspondence file -- the two forming an area file, geographically subdivided. The collection of historical data on naval operations in European waters was completed by the London staff and forwarded to the Navy Department in August 1919.\n\nMeanwhile in Washington, the Historical Section, established in August 1918 under the direction of the Chief of Operations, had partly lost its autonomous identity. Recognizing their common interests, and considering the younger as a lusty \"offshoot\" of the old Office of Naval Records and Library, the Secretary of the Navy on 1 July 1919 ordered the Historical Section \"...and the Library be incorporated in the Office of Naval Intelligence under the Director of Naval Intelligence and the Chief of Operations.\"23\n\nThe Secretary's order coincided with passage of the first legislative appropriation24 \"for collecting World War Records\"; a sum of $20,000 being earmarked for the latter purpose in addition to the usual annual amount of $21,000 set aside for the Office of Naval Records and Library.\n\nThe order of 1 July 1919 incorporating the Departmental Library and the Historical Section in the Office of Naval Intelligence was timely inasmuch as several previous directives had expanded activities of the Historical Section where overlapping with Office of Naval Records and Library functions seemed inevitable. Since both activities, at this time were fortunately under a single head, the demarcation between \"old\" and \"current\" records was recognized and accepted as marking the respective spheres of the original Office of Naval Records and the newer Historical Section. A few years later as World War I records outgrew their original secret or confidential classifications, this distinction gradually became less and both interpretation and scope of the work of the Office of Naval Records was broadened to include all operational records regardless of the date of origin.\n\nThere was nothing inconsistent with this earlier policy and a directive from the Secretary of the Navy to all bureaus, naval districts, Commander U.S. Naval Force in Europe, and Commanders in Chief of the Asiatic, Pacific and U.S. Fleets dated 13 June25 which read:\n\n\"It is proposed to make the Historical Section of the Office of Naval Operations the depository for all files and all other material that will contribute to the writing of the History of the Navy in the War with the Central Powers.\n\nTherefore, it is directed that, as each unit or activity is closed, the files of that unit, together with the file cases shall be immediately shipped to the Chief of Operations, and marked for the Historical Section, Room 1736, Navy Building, Washington, D.C.\n\nMany of the minor units, both in the United States and abroad, have already been closed and their files should be shipped at once. Such are certain naval districts, many training camps, schools, minor aviation stations, etc. The same principle shall be applied when dealing with the files of the various headquarters, as soon as Peace has been declared and their activities, so far as pertains to war, have ceased.\"\n\nThe first expansion of the activities of the Historical Section had been the establishment on 1 January 1919 of a Pictorial Branch whose purpose was to collect and file under proper references photographs illustrating activities of U.S. and foreign navies. A follow up in the form of an ALNAV26 on 14 March requested that copies of photographs and motion pictures of naval activities, ships, bases, personnel, and incidents taken during the war be forwarded to the Historical Section.27 Subsequently a letter over the signature of the Secretary of the Navy addressed to all Bureaus stated:\n\n\"A photographic Division of the Historical Section has been established, in which will be gathered and filed all the photographs of historic interest taken of Naval activities during the war. As the issuance of a Pictorial History of the War is contemplated, it is desirable for the Historical Section to have copies of all Navy photographs of interest; and it is requested that each Bureau furnish to the Historical Section, Room 1732, Navy Department, two copies of all such photographs it has, and that each contractor who was engaged in Navy work be requested to furnish such photographs.\"\n\nNow closely related during the post war period, were the functions of the original Office of Naval Records and Library and the Historical Sections (which in theory at least had been combined under the Director of Naval Intelligence) may likewise be seen in the following extracts from the Secretary's Annual Report dated 1 December 1920:28\n\n\"...The Historical Section is specifically charged with the collection, copying, and classification, with a view to publication, of the naval records of the war, and the acquirement of books, periodicals, photographs, maps, and other publications, documents, and pictorial records of the Navy relating to the war. This work has been efficiently carried on with the limited funds and personnel provided.\n\nThe large consignment of material received from United States naval headquarters in London, comprising copies of records, reports, dispatches, and orders concerning the operations of our forces in Europe, has been indexed and filed, and is available for use and reference. From the files of the departmental bureaus quantities of reports, dispatches, and other material have been obtained and placed in the historical files. A vast number of papers from ships and stations which have gone out of commission have been received.\n\nThousands of photographs, maps, and posters have been collected and mounted for preservation and use.\n\nA large war map, showing various naval activities during the war, has been made and is a graphic representation of the scope of the Navy's operations....\"\n\nThere are other striking parallels between conditions prevailing in the Office of Naval Records and Library after World War I and the present transition period. There was then, (a) an expressed fear of delay in obtaining vital increases in personnel to collect and compile comparatively recent operational records; (b) a hope for establishment of a suitable berth in the Department to attract a qualified civilian librarian; and (c) the need of establishing a proper naval museum.\n\n\"...The records of the great war form a body of historical material of incalculable value, and their collection and preservation is too important to be neglected. The material on hand and in sight is so large that to handle it the force of the Historical Section must be increased. This work can be done now with less difficulty and at lower cost than if it is deferred.\n\nWe should not, as was the case following the Civil War, allow a generation to elapse before these records are compiled. The people are entitled to this information within a reasonable period; and while it may be years before a comprehensive and authoritative history of the World War is written, we can and should provide for the preparation and publication of accounts of all important naval activities, written while they are fresh in the minds of those who took part in them....\"29\n\nSimilarly as a result of wartime expansion of activities and space considerations, the departmental library has been forced to move three times during the recent war, and the need of skilled supervision and coordination today is as great as when the Secretary wrote in 1920:\n\n\"...The Naval Library, which contains more than 50,000 volumes and many rare manuscripts, could be made of much greater value if a competent librarian were secured. The law at present provides for a chief clerk, and for years the work was conducted under the direction of that official, but the position has remained long vacant, owing to the small compensation offered, $2,000, and the impossibility of securing, at that salary, a competent and experienced man.\n\nUnifying the working forces of the Naval Library and the Historical Section, both of which are now under the same general supervision, would result in economy and the utilization of all the force to the best advantage.\n\nOrganized under a competent librarian, the library would be able to furnish officials of the department and others engaged in naval work of research, complete references on any subject desired. These references should extend to books in other libraries on technical or naval matters. There is increasing demand from many sources for information of this character, and the Naval Library should be able to furnish it, and could easily do so if an experienced man who possesses a knowledge of naval history and affairs as well as of library methods is secured....\"30\n\nIncidentally, twenty-five years ago, there was also the same urgency in the arguments for and requests that a Naval Museum be established:\n\n\"...The need of a naval museum in Washington in which can be gathered the historic relics of the Navy in all our various wars, representing notable incidents in the service, where can be displayed models of our various types of ships, specimens of typical aircraft like the NC-4 which made the first flight across the Atlantic; examples of naval ordnance and other implements of war, showing the progress made from time to time; and providing a place where naval officers and other may deposit their trophies for permanent preservation. I would suggest that the Naval Affairs Committees of Congress direct the department to prepare plans for such an institution to be ready when the time is propitious for the appropriation of sufficient funds for its construction. A considerable collection of articles of naval interest has already been gathered and placed in the National Museum.\n\nThe preservation in graphic form of historical events is so important that I would urge that Congress make appropriations for the painting of subjects illustrating naval activities and naval encounters and naval contribution to victory in the World War....\"31\n\nBetween 1917 and 1921 -- a period coinciding roughly with the duration of World War I and its active post-war era -- there were two major organic changes in the Office of Naval Records and Library. First, restoration of the Library to the Office of Naval Intelligence from the jurisdiction of the Secretary's Office, and second, revival of its earlier historical functions which had by that time, almost ceased to exist.\n\nAbout 1900, when the Office of Intelligence was restored to the Bureau of Navigation, the Office of Naval Records and Library was retained under the direction of the Secretary's Office. This separation arrangement was continued during the Meyer reorganization of the Navy Department in 1909 which placed intelligence under the Aid for Operations and again when the Office of Operations was legalized in the Act of 1915.\n\nAs a direct result, work of both the Navy Library and Intelligence Sections suffered; the latter because lack of its own sources created delays and uneconomical answering of requests for data; the former, because accessioning of new materials practically ceased and its valuable collections of historical manuscripts and printed documents were seldom consulted or used.\n\nTo remedy this situation, the Office of Naval Intelligence made repeated and urgent requests that the Library be returned to its cognizance. It was argued that the primary function of the Library was closely related to \"intelligence\", and in addition, many administrative handicaps were cited, such as the fact that a considerable number of requests for information, whether from the General Board, Plans Division, other offices or bureaus of the Navy Department, or from members of Congress, involved search both in the archives of the Office of Naval Intelligence and the printed sources in the Navy Library. Finally, by order of the Secretary of the Navy on 1 July 1919, the Library was again brought in to the Office of Naval Intelligence.\n\nThe revival of the historical function of the Library is likewise attributable to World War I. Under the date of 9 April 1928, Commodore D.W. Knox, then as now, Officer-in-Charge of the Office of Naval Records and Library wrote:\n\n\"...Until that time there was almost no effort made to follow the general practice of our Army and all foreign Navies and Armies in preserving historical records. The documentary collection of the Office of Naval Records practically stopped with the year 1885. Many records of much historical value between that date and the World War as well as others antedating 1885, have been destroyed by the various bureaus and offices when their administrative value had lapsed and filing space became crowded. The work of filling in the gap of historical records between about 1885 and the World War is yet to be done -- preliminary to the completion of the new federal Archive Building.\n\nIn 1918 Congress provided for the collection and archiving, preliminary to publication, of the World War records of the Navy, which work is actively in progress and will be completed in two or three years. When it is finished there will remain the need of continuing the function of safeguarding records of more recent naval operations against loss, by archiving them from time to time, after they have ceased to be of current administrative value. This work is closely related to the Library function because of the many requests for information, a part of which may be found in printed sources and the remainder in the manuscript collection.\n\nWhile the Library supplements the Office of Naval Intelligence principally in matters pertaining to the past, it is also useful in current subjects on account of the technical and other periodicals regularly subscribed to by the Library, which legal restrictions prevent the various bureaus from purchasing under their own appropriations. Experience since the moving of the Library to space adjacent to the Office of Naval Intelligence and placing it under the organization of the Office of Naval Intelligence has amply justified the changes which are now in effect....\"32\n\n__________\n\n18. Snow's \"Historical Sketch.\" Based on personal recollections of those who served in the Library. One recalled that while Theodore Roosevelt was Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he took active interest in Library matters, and later as President telephoned the Librarian from the White House on one occasion \"that the shades were drawn unevenly\" and another that \"growing plants should not be placed in the Library windows.\"\n\n19.

Tracy Barrett Kittredge, U.S.N.R.F., one of Sims' officers, undertook this study. From this and subsequent experience acquired in World War I, Kittredge, who returned to active duty in April 1942, prepared and submitted such an excellent and thorough analysis of the \"Problems Involved In Systematic Collection And Classification Of War Documentation; Office of Naval Records,\" that it has become the standard and basis for archival activities in the Office of Naval Records and Library since. (See Appendix C)\n\n22. Secretary of the Navy, Circular Letter, 18 August 1918. In Washington, History Section headquarters was located in close proximity to the principal offices of the Department in the Navy Building; but in this new nine wing building which had been constructed between 17th and 19th Streets on Constitution Avenue (on land reclaimed by draining part of the Potomac mudflats), space originally assigned to Office of Naval Records and Library proved too damp and untenable for its purposes. As a consequence, the Library did not relinquish its original quarters in the State, War and Navy Building until several years after the Historical Section had been consolidated with the Library and Manuscript sections as the \"World War Records Section\" of the Office of Naval Records and Library, and all three branches quartered in the Navy Department Building.\n\n23. Secretary of the Navy, Order of 1 July 1919. This restored the Library to the Office of Naval Intelligence with which it was originally established in 1882. In 1889, it had passed into the jurisdiction of the Secretary's Office.\n\n24. Legislative Act of 1 July 1919.\n\n25. Secretary of the Navy, Circular Letter, 13 June 1919.

Knox, Commodore, USN (Ret.). \"Memo on organization of Office of Naval Records and Library.\" 9 April 1928.\n\nPart III: Period from 1921 to 1939 -- Era between World Wars I and II\n\nIn the twenty odd years before the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the Office of Naval Records and Library developed from a comparatively little known departmental activity to one of national repute in the field of naval archives and history.33 This transition was accomplished despite a steady reduction in personnel and in the face of such further handicaps as the fact that the Library itself did not move to and merge with the other activities until 1923; that the historical function operated on a quasi-independent basis until 1927; and that funds for actual publication were not authorized until 1934.34\n\nWhen Commodore (then Captain) D.W. Knox, USN, (Ret.), was assigned to duty as Officer-in-Charge on 1 August 1921, the Office of Naval Records and Library consisted of the Library, the Old Records Section, and the World War Section.\n\n___________\n\n33. Its broadened policy and widened field may be observed in Commodore Knox's memo for Director of Naval Intelligence, dated 18 December 1928, which succinctly stated that the mission of Office of Naval Records and Library was: \"To acquire, systematically arrange, and preserve, manuscript, pictorial and technical Naval information; and to make such information readily available to the Naval service and the public.\" (In the files of Office of Naval Records and Library.)\n\n34. D.W. Knox, in a letter to Committee on Naval Affairs, dated 7 February 1929 stated: \"It seems pertinent for me to add that the number of clerical employees attached to this office has been steadily reduced, from a peak of 32 in 1922, when 17 were employed jointly on Old Naval Records and in the Library, while 15 were engaged on World War work. The present number is 22 . . . This notwithstanding a substantial increase in work of the Library and Old Records.\"\n\nThe Library\n\nThe Library proper was not only the central source of books, magazines and reference for the administration of the entire Navy Department, but, as has been shown, its facilities were frequently utilized by Members of Congress and other departments of the government. Acting Superintendent of the Library (since 1890), Mr. Charles Stewart, civilian Chief Clerk of the Office, was relieved in 1921 by Lt. Colonel H.K. White, USMC, (Ret.), who was the first in a succession of officers assigned as librarians during the next ten years. Commander J.H. Sypher, USN, (Ret.), served as Superintendent of the Library from March 1923 until November 1925; Lt. Commander Richard Wainwright, Jr., USN (Ret.), followed from November 1925 until January 1929; and Captain H.C. Cocke, USN, from the latter date until June 1931 when as an economy measure, the Superintendent's position was consolidated with that of the Officer-in-Charge, and Commodore Knox took on this additional duty.\n\nOld Records Section\n\nThe Old Records Section, which formerly had been mere custodian of an unorganized mass of old papers and documents, under the immediate supervision of Commodore Know during this period, gradually evolved into the most valuable and principal original source of naval history in the country. Containing more than million old documents and manuscripts dating from the beginning of the Navy to the late 1880's, these records were frequently consulted by civilians as well as technical historians and researchers. In 1923, when the Manuscript collection and Library were moved from the State, War and Navy Building, there was discovered a considerable amount of the old records which had never been properly archived, but remained boxed or otherwise unarranged and in bulk. As a consequence, data was not available except by an expenditure of considerable time and effort and many inquiries involving pensions, claims and other matters had not been answered.35\n\nIn the process of archiving these papers, a great amount of additional source material which had been lost, misplaced or forgotten in other departments was found and added to the collection.\n\n___________\n\n35. D.W. Knox, letter dated 7 February 1929: \"After coming to duty here it was necessary for me to give considerable study to the question of an appropriate scheme of archives into which all of the heterogeneous matter could be permanently incorporated systematically. This was obviously necessary to avoid tremendous future losses of time in accomplishing the immediate task which Congress had set us as well as in all future research work. The most eminent archivists in the city were consulted & a comprehensive plan adopted which was appropriate for the old records as well as the new. The office personnel was then reorganized to handle archiving in a systematic way, (which had not previously been undertaken seriously) so that there would be a steady and orderly flow of documents from the selection desks, through the classifiers, into the archive files. To date, approximately 400,000 letters, telegrams, and reports have been selected, classified and systematically archived; while several times that number have been examined, rejected as not of sufficient historical importance to archive, boxed, and placed in storage. Substantially all of the archiving has been completed and during the last year the selection of material for printing has been pursued.\"\n\nWorld War Section\n\nThe World War Section, established in 1919 by an Act of Congress and charged with \"The collection or copying and classification, with a view to publication, of the Naval Records of the World War, etc.\" likewise had been able to accomplish very little toward preparing material for publication. The collection received from London was the only group of papers properly and thoroughly archived, while virtually all other World War naval files still remained to be classified and archived into the general system.36\n\nThe three reserve officers -- Ensign S.P. Knut, Lt. (jg) P.B. Whelpley, Lt. Comdr. Edward Breck -- who had originally been assigned to the Office fo the purpose of preparing war records for publication, were released to inactive duty in June 1922 and the work thenceforth carried on by a succession of regular officers in accordance with the usual naval rotation policy.37 These officers concurrently supervised the activities of the Pictorial Section, and after 1934 when funds for printing were authorized, the Publications Section.\n\n___________\n\n36. When, for the purpose of making a single appropriation after 1927, both of these sections were consolidated, a memo to Captain William Beggaley, USN, in Chief of Naval Operations, dated 12 August 1932, suggested that the distinction still be observed between two types of materials and activities in the Office of Naval Records and Library. \"World War Records\" Section, then under Lieutenant Charles B. McVay III, USN; and the older, original section, designated \"Old Records\" under direct supervision of the Office-in-Charge. (In the files of Office of Naval Records and Library.)\n\n37. See Appendix D for Rosters of officers and other personnel assigned to Office of Naval Records and Library for World War to present date.\n\nRelated Activities\n\nIn addition to the work of its three main branches, the Office carried on some minor historical writing projects, printing seven monographs on various subjects38 connected with naval operations (with about fifteen others in preparation) before a joint Congressional Committee on Printing, in June 1922, forbade further publications of World War I historical material.39\n\nThe best overall picture of its functions, and most comprehensive description of its accomplishments, despite inadequate funds and insufficient personnel which handicapped the work of the Office of Naval Records and Library between the two World Wars are these paragraphs from the Annual Report made by the Secretary of the Navy in 1923:\n\nHISTORICAL SECTION AND LIBRARY.\n\nThe following report of the activities of the historical section and library is submitted for the year ending June 30, 1923.\n\nThe principal activity of the historical section has been the continuation of the work of collecting, arranging, and filing documents pertaining to the Navy's activities in the late war. This work has been done in accordance with the general policy approved by the Secretary of the Navy during the preceding fiscal year. The office force has been so organized and the work so systematized that greater progress has been made in archive building than in any previous year.\n\nHowever, the small office force still prevents a reasonably early completion. Estimates of the time needed to complete the work are necessarily very inaccurate, but probably 10 years will be required on the present basis. In submitting the last estimates to the Budget office, it was pointed out that probably five years could be saved by about doubling the subordinate clerical force, without increasing the supervisory force. The latter is at a minimum, needed to carry on the work at all, yet this minimum is capable of supervising a greater subordinate force. The speeding up of the work through increasing the number of lower-paid employees should therefore result in a saving of overhead costs for about five years, amounting in the aggregate to a saving of about $100,000.\n\nThe historical value of the archives in constantly increasing with the addition of new matter. The archives are also valuable in furnishing ready reference on World War matters. Many inquiries are received and answered daily from officials of various departments of the Government, historical societies, and other public and private persons. Foremost among these is the Veterans' Bureau, which requires verification of circumstances surrounding the deaths of naval personnel during the World War in the establishment of claims against that bureau.\n\nDuring the year approximately 35,000 documents were added to the archives. About 9,000 pounds of rejected material, from which papers possessing historical value have been extracted, were stored at Bellevue. A number of photographs and charts have been added to the pictorial collection.\n\nPreparation of monographs to cover some of the Navy's principal activities during the World War has continued but publication of them has been stopped by the action of the Committee on Printing. By special authority one monograph, in the hands of the Public Printer at the time when the ban was placed upon further printing, will be completed and issued at an early date. A pamphlet summarizing casualties to both naval and merchant vessels during the war has been printed and issued. Twenty monographs have reached such an advanced state of preparation as to be practically ready to be placed in the hands of the Public Printer.\n\nOn June 30, 1922, congressional provision for three reserve officers for the section expired. It should be renewed and made permanent, or else provision should be made for the employment of professional historians in a civil status. It is the deliberate opinion of many eminent scholars and naval officers who have studied the question, that the professional historian must participate in the preparation of naval history of merit. Historical writing is a profession in itself, in which naval officers can rarely hope to become proficient. Both professions must collaborate in the work. The reserve officer positions may be filled with duly qualified historians as the work progresses and as suitable persons can be found.\n\nWork upon the compilation of the General index to the \"Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion\" has continued, though progress has been slow owing to the need of periodic diversion of the limited personnel available to other pressing work. The general index can not be completed in less than one year.\n\nEarly in 1923 the Navy Department library was moved from its original quarters in the old building to the present Navy Department Building. An immediate and great increase in its activities ensued, and its value to the department resumed the position it was intended to have. The new location permits a greater economy in expenditures for magazines and books of a technical nature for the various bureaus and offices of the department.\n\nThe Library includes the Office of Naval Records, in which is filed a great number of old original manuscripts of much historical and traditional value. Efforts are being made to add to this collection and also to the collection of pictures pertaining to the 'Old Navy', with a view to making the library a center of naval tradition.\n\nThe Office of Naval records is frequently called upon to furnish old naval historical data, not only by the Pension and other Government offices, but also by numerous historical and patriotic societies, as well as by individuals. This function has been given careful attention in an effort to meet the demands of the country at large for information of the past deeds of its Navy.\"40\n\n___________\n\n38. See Appendix B for list of publications of the Office of Naval Records and Library.\n\n39. The early casual relationship between the Historical Section and the Office of Naval Records and Library before their actual consolidation in 1927, is indicated by a single sentence in Secretary Denby's Report for 1921, which summarized their activities as follows: \"The activities of the Historical Section and the Library and the Naval War Records Section continue with a view to the eventual publication of the Naval records of the World War.\"\n\n40. SECNAV's Report 1923, pp. 160, 162 -- Edwin Denby.\n\nNaval Museum\n\nAnother collateral duty of the Office of Naval Records and Library, the long-discussed naval museum, finally received some slight but hopeful impetus when on 28 April 1930, in an order originating in the Office of Secretary of the Navy, Commodore Knox was appointed Curator for the Navy Department.41 This secondary function logically was placed under the naval records branch in view of the close relationship between written and printed sources on the one hand, and graphic records, objects and pictures on the other. The Curator was responsible for the collection and preservation of objects, trophies, and relics of historical or inspirational value to the Navy, except those permanently assigned to the Naval Academy and other naval stations, and had cognizance over matters connected with the proposed Naval Museum at Washington, D.C. From thenceforth, pending construction of a new Navy Department building with suitable space and museum facilities, relics and pictures of past naval eras have been stored or recorded as to custody elsewhere.\n\n___________\n\n41. Secretary James Forrestal, in a letter to all ships and stations, dated 28 April 1945 (15 years later) stated: \"...The functions of the Curator for the Navy Department are hereby placed under the cognizance of the Chief of Naval Operations who will promulgate such instructions with respect thereto as may be deemed necessary....\"\n\nPublications\n\nIn 1922 as the printing of Civil War Documents (a work which had begun in 1894) neared completion, a Congressional Committee on Printing forbade further expenditures for this purpose pending a time when the publishing of such historical source material might be undertaken jointly by all concerned. Permission was granted, however, to complete the printing of a monograph then in the printer's hands but further work on many other proposed subjects was stopped for the next dozen years. Finally, in 1934 through the President's interest in naval matters, an appropriation was obtained from Congress for the printing of documents pertaining to the Quasi-War with France and the Barbary Wars. The publication section's work on these volumes commenced in April 1934 and carried on until seven volumes of Naval Documents, Quasi-War with France and six volumes of Naval Documents, United States Wars with the Barbary Powers eventually were brought out.42\n\nPresident Roosevelt was much impressed with the first of these volumes and highly complimented Commodore Knox: \"...You have done a splendid and useful piece of work in get out these volumes....\" and further indicated his pleasure by concluding the letter \"...and I hope the Congress will keep the appropriations going year after year....\"43\n\nTo make this personal communication a matter of official record, on 28 December 1938 Commodore Knox sent a copy, via Director of Naval Intelligence, to Chief of Naval Personnel stating:\n\n\"I enclose a copy of a letter received today from President Roosevelt and request that it be filed with my record.\n\nThe matter referred to is the project for printing early naval manuscript records of which the first series of seven volumes relating to the Quasi-War with France has been completed. The first volume of the documents pertaining to the Barbary Wars is now on the press, and this series will also run approximately seven volumes. In his foreword to the Barbary volumes, the President says, 'It is my earnest hope that the printing of naval manuscripts relating to the War of 1812 and other phases of our national life, may follow'.\n\nInasmuch as the printed volumes are sold at cost to the public, the project is intended to be self-liquidating and the probability of obtaining appropriations from Congress over an extended period of years, therefore, seems to be good.\"\n\n___________\n\n42. See Appendix E for a complete list of these and other works published by the Office of Naval Records and Library.\n\n43. F.D. Roosevelt, letter dated 27 December 1938 (beginning typically \"My Dear Dudley\".)\n\nPublic Relations\n\nIn their methods of conducting routine business between the two World Wars, Commodore Knox and his staff made many friends for the Navy Department in general, and the Office of Naval Records and Library in particular. Cheerfully and carefully carrying out its stated purpose of rendering assistance to any civilian or extra-departmental researchers interested in naval subjects, the office received much favorable comment and publicity, and in the files of the office may still be found many interesting clippings. of this period.\n\nOn 15 November 1931, a feature article in the magazine section of the Washington Sunday Star, describing some of the important Governmental Libraries in various agencies in the District of Columbia, included the following:\n\n\"...In the large, well arranged Library of the Navy Department in the Navy Building are more than 77,572 volumes, records and documents on Navy Science, reference, biographies, and history. Here are Admiral Dewey's original papers and also those of Admiral Farragut and Admiral Porter. . . . (The Navy Library) also has a file of 35,000 photographs pertaining to ships, personnel and other Navy subjects. . . . Its most ancient original documents are copies of the instructions given to the Navy Commanders to Capture British boats, signed by Henry Laurens, President Continental Congress, April 3, 1776....\"\n\nAdditional paragraphs are devoted to the branch libraries under or affiliated with the Navy Library, such as those at the Navy Medical School, Hospital, the Aviation Section and finally, an excellent description of the Library of the Naval Observatory and the priceless rare publications in its custody.\n\nOn 1 April 1935, a few year later, in the Los Angeles Times, Mr. Harry Carr who conducted an popular newspaper column \"The Lancer\", contrasting his treatment as a civilian in the Navy and War Departments wrote:\n\n\"...The Chair Warmers. The fault is with the officers of the General Staff in Washington. Brethren they are just plain snooty. I cite two incidents.\n\nI wanted to get the Army records of Fort Tejon near Bakersfield. After a long delay the War Department labored and brought forth the date of its founding and abandonment -- which could have been found in any school library.\n\nWith some trepidation, I went to the Navy Department and asked to see some records. They gave me a desk in the Bureau of records, a special library assistant, the use of a stenographer, sent a car for me every morning and dug up so many old log books and records that I lived for two weeks in a lather of excitement....\"\n\nIn the Washington Post of 22 November 1931, another magazine story gave considerable space to an article on the Pictorial Section of the Office of Naval Records and History. Under the caption \"THE U.S. NAVY'S FAMILY ALBUM\" it declared that \"If the 70,000 Pictures Comprising the Gallery Tucked Away in Room 3629 of the Navy Building Were Ever Mounted in Albums, a New Building Would Be Needed to House Them. They Embrace History of the Navy and Allied Subjects . . . And Still Service a Valuable Purpose.\" The collection consisted mostly, it was said, of actual photographs of officers and men, ships and crews, guns and armament, sea chases and battles, and of naval subjects of all kinds, as well as reproductions of drawings, sketches and paintings of historical events from the days before the invention of photography.\n\nHistorical pictures made up the most interesting part of the collection and from the time of the war for independence, one great event typical of naval action in every war was described by the author in considerable detail.\n\nAs its pictorial branch and other facilities became more widely known through such media, an increased interest in the records of the Navy's part in the historical development of the nation reflected itself in numerous requests from the general public.44\n\nTo facilitate and expedite making suitable replies, the filing system of the Pictorial Section was overhauled and in the interest of accuracy, many corrections made in the nomenclature. Lt. Commander Taylor, USN, the officer then performing a tour of duty in the Office of Naval Records and Library reported that:\n\n\"Certain shore establishments were filed under several different names. These were changed to the title of the shore station appearing in the Navy Directory of the year of the picture.\n\nMany ship's pictures were obtained from the Press and filed under the title given them in the press, -- Destroyers called battleships, battleships called cruisers, cruisers called transports, etc. In addition, all the British transports were marked U.S.S. The ship titles were changed to the correct nomenclature as listed in the Ships Data Book of the year the photograph was taken.\n\nThe German and Austrian pictures were filed under Enemy ships. These were changed to German and Austrian respectively.\"\n\nFrom time to time other articles concerning the Office of Naval Records and Library were published. One appearing in the U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings for January 1926, describing the rapidly diminishing source materials of the Navy's history and traditions, pleaded the cause of preserving these vanishing naval archives.45 The author (Commodore Knox) stressed the importance of recovering records of the Navy's origins and early history both as a means of understanding the past and as a guide to planning for the future of the nation.\n\nAppealing especially to former officers of the service (and their descendants or families) to make available any documents discovered among \"family papers\", the articles not only evoked widespread interest but caused the editors to print a Special Notice inviting attention to the subject.\n\n\"...The Board of Control is so impressed with the timeliness and importance of the subject matter of Captain Knox's article in this issue, entitled 'Our Vanishing History and Traditions,' that it deems it worthy of special notice, and sincerely trusts that there will be created such a lively interest as will result in the adoption of a successful plan.\"46\n\n___________\n\n44. D.W. Knox in a Circular, dated 15 April 1936, authorized one of the office employees on his own time and with his own materials \"To supply photographs for other than official purposes. . . . In order to meet the frequent demands for such service and as a convenience to the public.\"\n\n45. D.W. Knox, \"Our Vanishing History and Traditions,\" in U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings, January 1926.\n\n46. Plans ultimately resulted in establishment of the Naval Historical Foundation. This non-profit organization accepts gifts of documents, relics, etc., and retains them in custody for the Office of Naval Records and Library, thus eliminating necessity for Congressional action were they presented to Navy or other Governmental departments.\n\nPeacetime Plans for Additional Publications\n\nIn mid-summer 1939, just before the Second World War broke out in Europe, the Office of Naval Records and Library having practically completed bringing out its volumes of early historical documents pertaining to the Quasi-War with France and the naval records of the Barbary Wars, was looking forward to similarly printing a collection of the more important documents pertaining to naval operations during the War of 1812 and during 1917 and 1918.\n\nThe President's active interest in naval history promised well for carrying on such a program of publishing naval war records, but after a state of limited emergency had been declared on 8 September 1939, and war clouds were seen to be gathering on the horizon, priority for such a project dropped rapidly. For the duration therefore all plans for the job were suspended, contemplated requests that civilian and officer staffs be restored47 to former size were postponed and Commodore Knox again carried on alone as Librarian, Archivist, Curator, Historian and representative of the Navy Department in the National Archives Council.\n\n____________\n\n47. Since 1919, the clerical force had been reduced from 32 civilian employees to 21, and the officer complement from 5 to a single naval officer assigned to duty in the Office of Naval Records and Library, in addition to the officer-in-charge.\n\nPeriod from 1939-1946: World War II and Postwar Era\n\nGeneral Mission and Objectives\n\nAlthough non-military activities substantially decreased while departmental functions increased, the basic mission of the Office of Naval Records and Library during the war did not change. Established for the purpose of making information available to the Navy Department and to the general public from its constantly growing reservoir of operational records, the need of providing pertinent old data in the conduct of current business of carrying on the war because so paramount that its utility to the public, necessarily was curtailed for the duration.\n\nThe three immediate objectives of the office, after Pearl Harbor, were:\n\nto procure and commission the most skilled personnel that could be obtained in the field of naval archives and history;\n\nto survey the entire field of operational records with a view to determining which, in addition to war diaries, would be most valuable to the war effort;\n\nto arrange, classify and disseminate to those authorized to know whatever pertinent operational data were received by the office.\n\nPersonnel\n\nSelection of key personnel began within a week after 7 December 1941 when T.B. Kittredge, who had helped set up the Historical Branch in London after World War I, wrote Commodore Knox, volunteering to serve again in similar duty. After months of delay, Kittredge reported in April, \"turned to\" preparing an outline of policy and submitted a report which became the basis of the subsequent wartime activities of the Office of Naval Records and Library. John H. Kemble who had performed considerable research in, and was familiar with the archives of the Office of Naval Records and Library, had been called to active duty in February 1942, and was able to assist. In May 1942, two nationally known university professors -- R.C. Albion of Princeton and S.E. Morison of Harvard -- were solicited to head the War Archives Section of the Office of Naval Records and Library, but Albion could not leave his college duties and Morison (already commissioned as a Lieutenant Commander) felt he could better contribute to the war effort by his historical writing under the Secretary's Office.\n\nCommander Percy T. Wright, USN (Ret.) joined in July, and became ranking member of the wartime staff; in September, Marion V. Brewington, long interested in naval and maritime history, was commissioned and reported for duty; November saw Walter M. Whitehill, Curator of the Peabody Museum of Salem, Massachusetts reporting; and in December, George B. Porter of Washington, Nelson M. Blake of the National Archives, and Richard Leopold of Harvard College, completed the quota of key personnel who remained on duty in the Office of Naval Records and Library during the course of the war.\n\nSeveral additional officers were assigned from time to time in connection with a sound recording program ambitiously planning on operational uses afloat. When for reasons of security, it failed to live up to the high hopes of its sponsors, officers assigned for such duty were detached and finally the unit carried on for the duration in the Washington office largely under direction of Lieutenant George R. Porter.\n\nPreliminary Activities\n\nMeanwhile, as the important task of selecting personnel proceeded during the first year of war, plans were discussed and matured for the survey of operational records proposed by Kittredge. Early in 1943, accredited officer of the Office of Naval Records and Library began a sampling of the files of the Bureau of Ships, Commander in Chief, Chief of Naval Operations and the Secretary's Office with a view to determining the volume, content and distribution of classified and unclassified records.48\n\nOne of the duties of the Office of Naval Records and Library in the pre-war mobilization plan was the preparation of a letter of instruction to cover the preparation of War Diaries in the event of war.49 On 29 April 1941, Commodore Knox sent a memorandum to the Director of Naval Intelligence with a draft of the proposed letter, which was to be sent out in the event of mobilization. This letter was submitted in December 1941 and immediately met with opposition from various offices in Naval Operations. They felt that the keeping of War Diaries imposed an undue additional load of paper work. In view of this opposition, considerable time was lost. Commodore Knox pointed out in a memorandum of 16 January 1942, to the Director, that \"the original draft represented a substantial simplification of the same order actually carried out during the last war\". The letter was in due course submitted to CominCh, who wished to know more about the keeping of Diaries in World War I.\n\nOn 30 January 1942, a memorandum from Commodore Knox to CominCh with a copy of the World War I directive enclosed, stated, \"A similar order was prepared by this office several years ago for inclusion in the war plans. After the outbreak of the present war it came to my attention that the order covering War Diaries incorporated in the war plan had not been issued and that further simplification was desired.\"\n\nThe letter of instructions was subsequently rewritten and was issued on 22 February 1942, signed by the Chief of Naval Operations.\n\nEven before this directive was issued, certain ships and task forces, particularly in the Pacific, had been keeping War Diaries on their own initiative, which when submitted proved to be of very considerable value. As the War Diaries began to be received in Washington, the attitude toward them changed almost immediately, and their high value as a source of current operational information and guidance was very soon recognized.\n\nThe establishment of the Microfilm Library in the Readiness section of the Headquarters of the Commander in Chief, to facilitate the dissemination among bureaus and interested offices of the Navy Department of the information contained in the War Diaries,50 took place less than two months after the appearance of the 22 February 1942 directive, and was a proof of the usefulness of the Diaries.\n\nAfter the dissolution of CominCh in October 1945, activities of the Microfilm Library were turned over to the Office of Naval Records and Library.\n\n____________\n\n48. The principal benefit of the survey was the establishment of a mutual understanding between the officer personnel of each branch and the Office of Naval Records and Library, as well as an idea of each other's problems and objectives. Later, when increasing records and depleted office space required disposition of their files, both CominCh and CNO knew that the Office of Naval Records was a safe and proper custodian of current material regardless of its classification.\n\n49. W.M. Whitehill, Comdr., USNR. Most of this material on the preliminary activities and selection of officer personnel during the early months of World War II was taken from an unpublished monograph on the subject by Comdr. Whitehill, who served the Manuscript Section from November 1942 until July 1946.\n\n50. All War Diaries, Submarine Patrol Reports, Action Reports and many personal narratives were microfilmed immediately after they were received in headquarters. Each bureau and office concerned designated a representative \"reader\" who was enabled to have immediate access to the film of the original report without unavoidable delay of regular routing of the documents themselves. This proved to be the most valuable method of rapid dissemination of information in such reports to those who needed to know. Special indices were devised whereby any information required on a certain vessel or event, for instance, might be found by cross references under battle, campaign or area file. In 1942, Commander Cleveland McCauley was placed in charge of the Reading Room, which shortly thereafter was officially designated as the Microfilm Library. Equipment in the Microfilm Library included nine Recordak projectors, dictaphones into which readers might dictate as they read, and four fire-proof safes in which are now stored more than 1800 reels. By reason of the rapidly increasing number of reports due to greater naval activity, the staff increased from one officer and two civilians in 1942 to a complement of two full-time officers and nine enlisted men. A detailed account of the personnel, operation and accomplishments of the Microfilm Library may be found in the history of the Headquarters of the Commander in Chief.\n\nEstimate of Situation\n\nAt the outbreak of the War, Commodore Knox, feeling that the business of fighting should not be impeded in any way, and anticipating that the influx of World War II Records would not occur in any great volume until demobilization, decided on a long range policy of slow and careful selection of officer personnel, as the method of least interfering with more urgent activities, and best utilizing the interim period.\n\nOn 7 December 1941 there was not one single naval officer specifically assigned to the staff of the Manuscript Section of the Office of Naval Records and Library (Op-16-E-2). Its civilian personnel, all of long experience, then quartered in Room 3314 of the Arlington Annex, consisted of: Mrs. Alma Lawrence; Mrs. Fay King; Mrs. Clara R. Collins; Mrs. Mary E. Jones; Miss Mary M. McHale; and Miss Georgia Munroe.\n\nFirst Appointment to Wartime Staff\n\nVarious other civilians who had had relations with the office in peacetime wrote offering their services in any capacity in which they might be useful. Among those was Mr. Tracy Barrett Kittredge, who had during the last war been a Lieutenant, USNR, attached to the staff of Admiral Sims in London, and had worked very closely with Commodore Knox in organizing the historical section in World War I. On 13 December 1941, Mr. Kittredge wrote to Commodore Knox, to the Administrative Officer of the Office of Naval Intelligence and to Admiral Stark offering his services.\n\nCommodore Knox in replying on 15 December, stated, \"The day you called, we discussed the problems of taking over current historical documents for our historical collection and I understand that we were in agreement that nothing should be done until the period of demobilization sets in. Nevertheless, I have the problem of studying this matter, preparing plans for doing the job when the war is over, and I would very much like to have you on duty here in that connection.\" At that time, it seemed that Mr. Kittredge's services might not be required full time in this office and that he might undertake other duties with Admiral Stark.\n\nThis plan of making a study of the archival problem of World War II in advance of the actual end was the one which occupied the attentions of the office for a number of months to come.\n\nMr. Kittredge applied for reappointment as an officer in the U.S. Naval Reserve, but in spite of strong recommendations from Commodore Knox and Admiral Stark, a considerable amount of time was spent in paper work between New York and Washington, and it was 5 March before he was finally sworn in as Lieutenant, USNR.\n\nPreliminary Study and Basic Memorandum\n\nAdmiral Stark in the meantime was making plans for proceeding to London and wished to take advantage of Lieutenant Kittredge's extensive European experiences for duty there. Commodore Knox was agreeable to this, but told Admiral Stark that he would like to have Lieutenant Kittredge spend a few days in Washington before his departure to make a preliminary survey of the archival problems of this office. This was agreed upon and Lieutenant Kittredge reported in Washington the last week of March.\n\nLieutenant Kittredge applied himself to the problems involved in the systematic collection of war documentation with great energy and insight and in an extremely short time prepared a memorandum for Commodore Knox which has become the basis and point of departure for the subsequent activities of the office.51\n\nAs the length of Lieutenant Kittredge's stay in Washington was uncertain, he was compelled to work in considerable haste, and after preparing his original memorandum, which was submitted on 10 April, he found that he had a few remaining days before leaving. Consequently, he prepared a second memorandum on 20 April, entitled \"Procedures suggested for examining and disposition of plans for activities of the Office of Naval Records in the centralization, classification and filing of documentation relative to the Naval operations during the war.\"\n\nThis memorandum of Lieutenant Kittredge involved proposals for preliminary surveys by officers attached to the Office of Naval Records of existing files relating to naval operations, and the laying of plans for the establishment of a future operational archive in the Office of Naval Records. Lieutenant Kittredge suggested the extensive use of microfilm as a solution of the space problem, and as a means of reconciling the desire of the Archivist of the United States for records to be filed by provenance, and the practice of the Office of Naval Records in arranging its files similar to the methodized system already in use.\n\nLieutenant Kittredge's suggestion for possible staff requirements for the Office of Naval Records were as follows:\n\nOne officer to make a survey of Navy Department files and archives;\n\nOne officer, with perhaps one or more assistants, to make a survey of present methods for analysis and synthesis of information available; this officer was to be personal assistant to Commodore Knox;\n\nOne officer to be responsible for the organization and maintenance of a microfilm archive, with one or more assistants to do any classification and indexing of microfilm prints;\n\nOne officer to be responsible for the planning, installation and maintenance of the files of War Diaries and other special collections relating to naval operations;\n\nOne officer to assist Commodore Knox in working out cooperative arrangements with government agencies concerned with war activities and with the National Archives.\n\nLieutenant Kittredge left Washington for London on 28 April. Three days before, on 25 April, Commodore Knox had submitted a memorandum to the Director of Naval Intelligence, outlining this program and requesting the assignment of an appropriate number of officers to undertake it.\n\n____________\n\n51. Appendix C. Parts 1 and 2, include the two memoranda prepared by Kittredge at this time.\n\nSelection of Other Qualified Officers\n\nA few days after Commodore Knox's memorandum of 25 April had been submitted to the Director, Ensign Kemble, who was going to New York, was asked by Commodore Knox to stop at Princeton and ascertain the possibilities of securing suitable personnel for carrying out the project. He talked with Dr. Edward Meade Earle, Dr. Harold G. Sprout, and Dr. R.G. Albion. Dr. Earle recommended Dr. Albion and Professor S.E. Morison of Harvard University as the best persons for carrying out this project.\n\nWhile in New York, Ensign Kemble also saw David B. Tyler, who was eleven months later commissioned Lieutenant, USNR, for field duty in the sound recording unit.\n\nAt this time, the only officer specifically requested was Ensign John Haskell Kemble, USNR, who was to undertake the survey of Navy Department's files and archives. Ensign Kemble, in civilian life, was a member of the History Department of Pomona College, Claremont, California. He had held a commission in the Naval Reserve for several years, and had spent some time in the Office of Naval Records while engaged in private research. He had been called to active duty shortly after Pearl Harbor, but because of the interminable and trivial delays which seemed to dog the steps of all officers who were needed in this Office, he was not actually assigned for duty in Washington until 26 February 1942, when he was assigned to Op-16-A3 e (Foreign Intelligence Records).\n\nEnsign Kemble called on Commodore Knox shortly after his arrival and, during Lieutenant Kittredge's stay in Washington, was in close contact with him as Lieutenant Kittredge occupied a desk in Room 3833, main Navy Building, where Ensign Kemble was then located.\n\nCommodore Knox's memorandum of 25 April to the Director was lost, and no action was consequently taken until a duplicate copy was submitted on 26 May. It was on that date, \"approved for planning and arrangement\" with the added notation by the Director, \"believe it is too early yet however to consider transfer of any files to Archival state.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Commodore Knox had been taking steps to assemble a staff in accordance with Lieutenant Kittredge's proposal. On 6 May 1942, he wrote Robert Greenhagh Albion, professor of History and Assistant Dean to the Faculty of Princeton University, sending him a copy of the 25 April memorandum and requesting his services. \"In part, the task I had in mind for you is outlined in paragraph 7. Your administrative experience and general background however qualify you further for the position of my principal assistant in the whole project dealing [with] the current war. I should be delighted to have you in this dual capacity.\"\n\nOn the same day, Commodore Knox wrote to Marion Vernon Brewington, Jr. of Philadelphia, outlining his plans for the project, stating that he hoped that Professor Albion might be coming in charge of the entire work, and suggested that Mr. Brewington might be interested, fitting into some of the aspects of the plan either as a Lieutenant, USNR, or as a civilian employee with equal pay. Mr. Brewington, although in civilian life a trust officer of the Pennsylvania Company in Philadelphia, had for many years devoted himself to the study of Naval and Maritime History with great distinction, and had, in the course of his work, been in constant contact with Commodore Knox and the office staff. He telegraphed Commodore Knox on 9 May accepting the suggestion, and the process of his enrollment as a reserve officer began although it was four months before he appeared in Washington.\n\nProfessor Albion was however unable to leave his duties at Princeton University entirely and raised the possibility of his coming to the Office of Naval Records as a civilian working half time. It was felt however, that the head of the project must be a commissioned officer, and therefore, there seemed no way to secure Professor Albion's services.\n\nConsequently, on 22 May, Commodore Knox wrote to Professor Samuel Eliot Morison, professor of history at Harvard University, offering him the post of \"Naval Reserve Office in charge of this project.\"\n\nProfessor Morison had on 9 December 1941, written to Captain J.A. Gade, USNR, in the Office of Naval Intelligence, concerning his possible enrollment in the Naval Reserve. Captain Gade had referred this inquiry to Commodore Knox, who had, in a memorandum of 24 December, said, there is no plan at present for a history of naval operations to be prepared after the war\", and that \"the function of this office is mainly archiving\". Professor Morison, in reply (letter of 7 January 1942) had suggested the desirability of getting \"history hot off the griddle, written as the operations progressed, and then laid away for publication after the war or whenever it can be told\". Commodore Knox at that time, felt that such a proposal did not fall within the scope of this office.\n\nProfessor Morison in the intervening months had followed his proposal through other channels, and when Commodore Knox wrote him on 22 May, he had recently been commissioned Lieutenant Commander, USNR.\n\nOn 29 May, he wrote Commodore Knox as follows: \"After giving your flattering offer very careful consideration, I decided that it would be better for my historical work if I devoted my entire time and energy to keeping abreast of current history. That alone is a stupendous job; much bigger than anything I have heretofore tackled, and if I undertake to make a collection of source material it would consume all of my time\".\n\nAs Ensign Kemble was at this time about to go to Massachusetts on leave, Commodore Knox requested him to sound out Dr. Walter Muir Whitehill, Assistant Director fo the Peabody Museum and Editor of the American Neptune concerning the possibility of his joining the staff to take over the duties originally contemplated for Professor Albion. As Dr. Whitehill was much interested, Ensign Kemble reported this fact to Commodore Knox, who wrote him in June and shortly after, requested the Personnel Officer of Office of Naval Intelligence to arrange for his enrollment as Lieutenant, USNR. This procedure, however, again proved extremely slow, and it was 16 November 1942 before Lieutenant Whitehill reported for Duty. As Ensign Kemble had urged that the person who was to be charged with the planning of the project should have some hand in the choosing of the staff, no further efforts were made to secure additional personnel immediately.\n\nBy the end of June, it appeared desirable that Ensign Kemble should be transferred from Foreign Intelligence Records and begin to devote his time to the duties which were contemplated for him in Lieutenant Kittredge's memorandum. As this was agreeable to Commander Harding, he was transferred to Op-16-E on 12 July. Kemble had on 20 June been promoted to Lieutenant (junior grade) and on 20 August was again promoted to Lieutenant, as it had been discovered that he should have been called to active duty in the previous winter with the rank of Lieutenant (junior grade) rather than Ensign as had been the case.\n\nOn 2 July 1942, Commander Percy T. Wright, USN, (Ret.), reported for duty in the Office of Naval Intelligence and was assigned to Op-16-E. Commander Wright had had a distinguished career as a submarine officer in World War I; had subsequently served as Navigating Officer of the West Virginia and as the Commanding Officer of the Canopus on the China Station. He had retired on 1 September 1933 because of health, but it had so improved by the summer of 1942 that he was able to return to active duty of a limited nature. This seemed a particularly fortunate coincidence for the plans of the Office of Naval Records as it would in wartime be extremely difficult to secure the services of an officer of the regular Navy with extensive sea experience for such a project as this, and it was felt that Commander Wright's extensive acquaintance throughout the Navy would prove of great value to the Reserve officers of the staff and would assist them in finding their way through the intricacies of the naval establishment. Commander Wright spent some days familiarizing himself with the work of the various branches of Op-16-E and was given the choice of assignment to any one in which he saw the greatest possibility for useful service. His choice was Op-16-E-2 and consequently Commodore Knox asked him to become head of that section.\n\nCompletion of the Shakedown Period\n\nThus for all practical purposes, the assembly of key personnel may be considered as completed and the wartime expansion of the Office of Naval Records and Library well underway by the close of the first year of the war. Commander Wright with Lieutenants Whitehill, Brewington, Kemble and Porter, were carrying on the preliminary survey proposed by Kittredge; Lieutenant Blake performing liaison work in the National Archives and the Office of Records Administration; Lieutenant Small instructing ships in preparation of war diaries and interpreting those received for the Bureau of Personnel and Ordnance; and Ensign Leopold setting up classifications and filing systems, with Boatswain Newbold directing the enlisted force in this work.\n\nUnder the date of 22 January 1943 Commodore Knox, in a memorandum to the Director of Naval Intelligence was able to state that the situation in Op-16-E-2 had then reached a point where a more specific report could be made on the duties and functions of the officer personnel.\n\nHe found that it had become increasingly clear that the function of his staff should be to make the operational records of the present war of immediate use in its conduct, and believed that, if this task was accomplished satisfactorily, these materials would form the basis for the preparation of a staff history immediately after the war, should that be deemed advisable. \"...Such a project was decided upon by the Secretary of the Navy and by Admiral Sims in 1918, but was not carried through in its entirety due to the close of the war. This resulted in the loss to a large extent of the naval lessons of World War I, and it therefore seemed imperative to undertake this work for World War II at the earliest possible time....\"\n\nOne administrative officer and four other officers of the Washington staff were concerned with the collection of significant operational records.52 War diaries were automatically received for permanent retention, but it was necessary also to maintain constant contact with offices of the Navy Department and related governmental agencies to locate and earmark for reference, future microfilming, and possible future transfer of pertinent supplementary documents which were essential to complete the operational record.\n\n___________\n\n52. In this memo, Commodore Knox reported: \"The duties of the Washington staff also include the indexing and filing of the records received in order to make the information contained instantly available. The present flow of documents is only a fractional part of the files that will be received as the war progresses and nears its end. Microfilming is being used to the utmost to minimize the space problem. One officer devotes his full time to general problems of planning this classification. This officer, with the assistance of the officers described in paragraph 4, maintains a high degree of familiarity with the information in the materials received, in order to insure its fullest usefulness. The mechanical work of indexing and cross-indexing these papers is carried out by a staff of yeomen under the direction of a warrant officer. This staff is at present large, but as the back accumulation of war diaries is processed, this work can be kept up by fewer men....\"\n\nSuspension of Recording Project\n\nWhile assembling the Washington staff, a second group of especially qualified officers was also in the process of selection. It was contemplated that these would be distributed among the forces in the forward action areas and at strategic points within the continental limits of the United States.\n\nThe field staff would consist of thirteen units of one commissioned officer and one stenographic yeoman (equipped with voice recording machines), assigned to duty at sea frontiers and centers of naval importance overseas. These units would be concerned with the collection of significant operational records not available in Washington, by obtaining recorded narratives from those who have taken a prominent part in operations. Narratives of this sort already recorded by this section were proving of great value from many angles, but experience had demonstrated the necessity of getting them immediately after the action.\n\nIn addition, these officers would be familiar with the procedure for the disposal of excess files as they accumulate on board ship and ashore. it was expected that field units would be of great assistance to operating forces in aiding them in the reduction of burdensome files. In this capacity they would work in close cooperation with the Office of Records Administration, looking to the destruction of useless material and the forwarding to Washington of important records. Unfortunately, to the intense chagrin and disappointment of Commander Wright, its principal sponsor, and after considerable time and care had been consumed in the selection of proper equipment and personnel for the sound recording program, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, in a memo to Commodore Knox dated 4 February 194353 stated:\n\n\"In view of the desire of our Commanders in the theaters of operations to remain unhampered, insofar as possible, by persons or activities not essential to the business of fighting, I regret that I cannot permit sending personnel into the field for the purposes specified in your memorandum dated January 29, 1943, in which you requested the services of Ship's Clerk Richman.\"\n\n___________\n\n53. Later on, this view was modified by CominCh letter, Serial 2770, dated 1 May 1943 which \". . . approves the assignment of two recordgraphs, with operating personnel, to the Pacific Fleet, for the purpose of recording action narratives of Fleet personnel.\" with the understanding that one machine would be used at Pearl Harbor and the other at discretion of Commander Third Fleet. All recordings to be sent to CominCh for censor and disposition.\n\nUtilization of Field Personnel\n\nSumming up the situation six months later, however, it was decided that while the refusal of the Vice Chief of Naval Operations to allow historical officers to be sent into combat zones seemed particularly unfortunate at the time and left the Office of Naval Records and Library with an embarrassing richness of personnel and Recordgraph machines, the arrangements made for disposition of machines and utilization of field officers were far from disappointing.\n\nThe assignments to test the Recordgraph were by the dispatch of Lt. Kemble to Pearl Harbor, and of Boatswain Newbold to the South Pacific.\n\nThe assignments of historical utility were by ordering Lt. (jg) Summersell as historical officer on the staff of ComSubPac; Lt. Kemble to the staff of CincPAC; and Lt. (jg) Morison as assistant historian, Eastern Sea Frontier.\n\nThe balance of the Sound Recording Project's officer personnel were issued individual orders. Ens. Preston went to the Western Sea Frontier as war diary officer; Lt. Dickson ordered as officer-in-charge of Foreign Intelligence Records in ONI; and Lt. Tyler assigned to fill the vacancy caused by Kemble's detachment. Lt. Shopen and Ens. Byrd qualified themselves as operational intelligence officers; and Ens. Haskett was ordered to sea.\n\nLt. Porter alone remained of the staff and he quietly and efficiently used the Recordgraph machine in Washington to obtain a considerable number of recordings from officers and men who have returned from combat zones, thereby carrying out the purpose for which the machines were first procured.\n\nThus, after six months of fundamental parts of the original program had been accomplished, although not to the extent, or in the manner originally anticipated.\n\nRelationship With Other Branches\n\nIn carrying out its mission of classification and collection of manuscript materials pertaining to the conduct of the naval side of the war, the Office of Naval Records and Library established working relationships with various branches of Commander-in-Chief, Chief of Naval Operations and the Secretary's Offices. Among those which appeared to be the best potential sources of operational records or whose activities were most closely connected with the origin, collection or evaluation of such material were the Readiness Section, (CominCh F 2321) and the Combat Narratives Section (OP 16C).\n\nThe Readiness Section was, among its other duties, charged with rapid dissemination of information contained in war reports to \"those who needed to know.\" All Action Reports and some of the more important War Diaries, Submarine or Aircraft Patrol Reports were immediately microfilmed on receipt at headquarters and authorized readers for all offices or bureaus concerned granted access to the films. Ultimately, the original documents (or photostats in some cases) were sent to the Office of Naval Records and Library as the final repository, and the great bulk of materials accessioned during the months that followed were derived in this manner.\n\nThe Combat Narratives Branch (OP 16C) was the office in the Chief of Naval Operations organization whose functions involved the evaluation of similar classes of operational material. This section, however, found films or photostats suitable source materials for its purposes, and in consequence came very little within the scope of the Office of Naval Records and Library.\n\nThe Office of Records Administration, under the Secretary, with which cooperation and"
