        "text": "I have a question for those in my network who graduated recently‚Ä¶ Our world nowadays seems to think that an entry-level job needs to have several years of experience. As college students, we don‚Äôt have that experience, and entry-level should meanentry-level, meaning, no experience needed. Does anyone have suggestions on what companies to apply to that take college graduates as we are? I graduate in May, and have done many applications thus far, but I‚Äôve only had one interview, which was later denied, and many rejections. I‚Äôm just not sure where to look at this point‚Ä¶ I have about 2 1/2 months before I graduate, but time will come and go quickly, and spring break is one of my only chances to interview in Pittsburgh and Columbus, two of my search areas. I am also looking in central Pennsylvania, particularly Harrisburg area. If anyone has advice, or leads on a job that would fit me, please let me know! To my fellow college students, share this post to your network, so we can spread the knowledge! #Networking #Network #EntrylevelJobs #JobSearch #Graduate #ClassOf2024 #JobSearchStruggles #Advice\n\nI am puzzled as to why individuals with Bachelor's and Master's degrees find it so challenging to secure employment. Wasn't the purpose of pursuing higher education to obtain better job opportunities or a fulfilling career, rather than just hanging the degree on the wall? It seems that to gain experience in a new field, individuals must apply and hope for a chance, but it appears that the only way to be considered is if one has 12 to 20+ years of experience. How does this requirement make sense? Please, help me understand this hiring process.\n\nI was rejected once again this year! I can't tell you how many College Access organizations I've applied to this year, too many to count. Thankfully I am currently employed and just looking for the right opportunity. As an education professional and doctoral candidate with 10+ years of experience in K-12 education, and college-access CBO experience, I've been reflecting on the challenges many passionate individuals face when applying for roles within college-access organizations, particularly those with a strong focus on sales. ü§î It's Witnessing the frustration that accompanies the job-seeking journey for so many dedicated professionals like myself is disheartening. The process often involves multiple applications, numerous interviews, and a persistent balancing act to showcase not only skills but a genuine commitment to fostering educational success. üéì College access is a field driven by the noble goal of empowering students to reach their full potential. Unfortunately, the emphasis on sales in some organizations can overshadow the primary objective of making education accessible and equitable. üí° I believe it's crucial for hiring processes to prioritize candidates who align with the educational mission and possess a genuine passion for positively impacting students' lives. Let's focus on finding individuals who see the bigger picture and understand the profound influence education can have on shaping future generations. ü§ù To my fellow professionals, stay resilient! Your dedication to creating meaningful change in the lives of students is invaluable. Remember, the right opportunity is out there, one that values your skills, commitment, and, most importantly, your passion for education. #Education #CollegeAccess #JobSearch #PassionForEducation #LearningSuccess #CareerJourney #LinkedInPost #CareerReflections\n\nWhat does a degree mean? This question isn't just philosophical - it's essential when it comes to hiring. TXI doesn't have degree requirements in any of its job postings, because that's not a relevant criteria for the work we do. How do you think about problems? How do you learn and grow? How do you collaborate with a team? How do you handle ambiguity? Those are things we care about, so those are things we vet for. If you've got a degree, it means that you or your family could afford higher education, or that you or your family was willing to take on debt. It means nothing about your skills, capabilities, behaviors, or values - you know, the things we actually need to build our business. But degree requirements aren't only irrelevant - they actively perpetuate bias. We know that there's inequitable access to higher education in the United States, between the continually increasing costs and the roll-backs of affirmative action considerations last year. So folks from historically excluded groups will, through degree requirements, continue to be excluded. There's momentum behind removing degree requirements: Massachusetts, for example, recently decided to remove all degree requirements from state government job postings unless absolutely necessary. (h/t Better Allies newsletter, a great subscription) If you're a hiring manager and there's a degree requirement in your job posting, ask yourself why. If you don't feel 100% confident in your answer, today's a good day to delete it. #TearThePaperCeiling #hiring #recruiting #DEIB\n\nHarlan Cohen might be the best person to answer this question but I wanted to ask my HR/Talent/Recruiting friends a question. This morning is the first time I can remember that I have gotten a resume that states Education: Institution \"Direct Entry\". I understand now that this is an honor and means the student was guaranteed acceptance before they even applied. The student didn't have to be reviewed or go to another school first to get some \"help\" before getting admitted. Does this matter to hiring managers? Are we now not only looking at a candidate's education but judging the candidate based on whether or not they were directly accepted by the school? Do we care if the candidate went to another school or to community college first? Do we care if the candidate for less than stellar high school grades or financial reasons had to go some place else then transfers to an institution? Mike Jenkins would agree that this is not a factor in my recruiting efforts for Ascension St. Vincent. I am looking for candidates who have the education, the licensing, the experience, the personality, the work ethic, etc. needed to get the job done well. I am also personally acquainted with stellar individuals that did not take a straight education path, and I promise, you would agree they are living their best lives. Have a great day! And pursue your dreams even if the path is not direct!"
