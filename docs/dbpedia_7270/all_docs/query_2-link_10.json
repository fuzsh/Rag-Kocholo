An event on one side of the timeline might influence an event on the other side in the same way that New Hampshire is influenced by events in America and the world.

Native tribes grew three kinds of crops—squash, corn, and beans. This trio became known as the “three sisters” because they were all grown together. The corn grew straight and tall, and the beans grew up around the corn stalks. The squash was planted at the base of the corn stalks, and its big leaves protected the base of the corn and beans, preventing weeds from growing or animals from eating them.\n\nChristopher Columbus reaches North America\n\nCLOSE\n\nChristopher Columbus reaches North America\n\nChristopher Columbus was an Italian explorer.

The colonists named their settlement Jamestown after the English king, James I. Life was very hard for these settlers because they had come looking for gold and did not bring enough food to eat. For the first several years, the Native Americans shared their food with the English colonists so they would not starve. Eventually, the colonists learned to plant crops and live off the land. Many more English settlers arrived in Jamestown and founded new settlements in Virginia. They were hoping to build a better life than they had in England.\n\nJohn Smith lands at Isles of Shoals\n\nCLOSE\n\nJohn Smith lands at Isles of Shoals\n\nIn the early 1600s, a few European explorers came to New England.

He originally named the largest island after himself—Smith Island—but today we know all of these islands as the Isles of Shoals. When Smith returned to England he wrote a book about what he had seen in New England and told his readers that there were more fish in New England waters than anyone could imagine. He also wrote about how beautiful the land was, how plentiful the trees and animals were, and how perfect it would be to settle there. His book encouraged many people to think about coming to New England.\n\nDisease strikes the Abenaki\n\nCLOSE\n\nDisease strikes the Abenaki\n\nThe Europeans who visited New England accidently brought with them diseases like small pox and chicken pox.

Life was very hard for the Pilgrims because they did not have enough food, but the Native Americans helped them learn how to survive in the New World. In the coming years, thousands of people came to Massachusetts because they wanted to live where they would be free to practice their own religion.\n\nFirst English settlement in New Hampshire\n\nCLOSE\n\nFirst English settlement in New Hampshire\n\nThe first permanent European settlement in New Hampshire was at Odiorne Point in Rye.

They also thought they could trade with the Native Americans for beaver pelts, which were very popular in England. Unfortunately, Mason died unexpectedly before leaving England.

No one knows why Field was so determined to make such a difficult climb, although there were rumors at the time that there were precious gems, like diamonds, high up in the mountains.

Although no one knows when Passaconaway was born, he was rumored to be over 100 years old when he stepped down as leader to his people.

They had to pay a fine for breaking the law. Some of them paid the fine, but the people living in Weare refused to pay it. When the sheriff came to arrest them, they ran him out of town in the middle of the night. This became known as the Pine Tree Riot.

But he thought there must be an easier way to get to the top than climbing up 6,000 feet. He developed a special kind of train, called a cog railway, that could climb such a steep terrain. The cog railway used gears to pull the train up the side of the mountain. It also had special brakes that would keep the train from coming back down the mountain too fast. It took a long time for Marsh to convince people that his train would work. In fact, people used to make fun of his idea by calling it the “railway to the moon,” since they thought Marsh had as much chance to build a train that ran to the top of a mountain as he did building one that went to the moon. But finally, he raised enough money to build it. On July 3, 1869, the first cog train, which Marsh called “Old Peppersass,” climbed to the top of Mount Washington.

The townspeople in each community would decide how they wanted to celebrate, but most towns held picnics, concerts, baseball games, plays, dinners, parades, and fireworks. Rollins also encouraged towns to write letters to people who used to live there but had moved away, inviting them back again to see old friends at the celebration. When these visitors returned, they often donated money to the town to build a new building or create a park for the townspeople.

His owner, a New Hampshire man named Arthur Treadwell Walden, took Chinook with him when he went an expedition to explore the South Pole. Chinook was the lead dog on a team of 90 sled dogs who brought supplies to the explorers and helped keep them alive. The expedition’s leader, Admiral Robert Byrd, later said that without Chinook and the other dogs on the team, the expedition to the South Pole would have failed.\n\nGreat Depression\n\nCLOSE\n\nGreat Depression\n\nThe Great Depression was a 10-year period in American history when the American economy did very poorly.

To help all the people struggling in America, the U.S. government hired thousands of people to build big construction projects like bridges and dams, establish national parks with trail systems, and create public art like statues and murals. The government also opened soup kitchens to feed people and shelters so people would have some place to sleep.

The league not only encouraged people to buy art from local craftsmen but it also established a program so that craftsmen could teach others how to make traditional handicrafts. In 1934, they held the first craft festival where people could buy locally made crafts and see how artists create their works. The festival still happens every year in August.\n\nHighest wind speed recorded\n\nCLOSE\n\nHighest wind speed recorded\n\nAs the highest peak in the Northeast, Mount Washington sees all sorts of crazy weather.

But if it was fun to ski down a mountain, it was hard work to climb up the mountain in the first place. People began looking for creative ways to get up to the top of mountains so they could ski back down them. A lot of the early inventions were tow ropes. Skiiers would basically hold onto a rope that was pulled up the mountain, but even that was a lot of work to get dragged so far up such steep inclines. In 1937, Belknap Recreational Area in Gilford opened the first ski chair lift in the eastern United States.

An oil refinery turns crude oil into petroleum products that people use every day, like gasoline or heating oil. The billionaire planned to ship oil to the coast of New Hampshire in giant ships and then pump it in underwater pipelines to the refinery. Some Granite Staters liked this plan because it would bring jobs to the state and lower the price of oil for everyone. Others did not like it because they worried that it would damage the environment. For example, if the underwater pipes leaked, billions of gallons of oil would be dumped in New Hampshire's waters. This would kill all the plant and animal life in the area. A group called \"Save Our Shores\" worked to prevent the oil refinery. At town meeting in Durham in 1974, the project was voted down.
