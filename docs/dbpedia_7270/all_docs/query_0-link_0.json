Bunker Bean, a meek office clerk, has grandiose dreams but seems destined to remain forever in his lowly station. He seeks out the help of a fortune- teller, who tells him he is the reincarnation of Napoleon and also of an Egyptian Pharaoh. Armed with his new sense of power, Bunker proceeds to win the hand of his boss' daughter and also outwits her cutthroat father in a business deal. Now a winner, Bean suddenly learns that the crystal ball-gazer was a phony, and that he found success not through any aristocratic bloodlines but through sheer spunk and belief in his own abilities.",

        "text": "Bunker Bean is a meek office clerk. He asks his boss for a raise and is rudely rejected. He's a push-over. He visits a fortune teller who tells him that he is the reincarnation of Napoleon. He gains a fresh sense of power and uses it in his life, even with the daughter of the boss. He inherits a patent from a dead uncle which his work company needs and a large amount of cash. The fortune teller is a crook and starts working another scam on him.\n\nLucille Ball has a minor role. She has sass but doesn't get to do much. The lead is a little too good at being meek. He's not the most leading of leading men. I really love the Napoleon premise but they could have taken it much further. I don't condone the spanking but it's hilarious. There is a lot of fun potential and it is able to do some of it. The uncle inheritance is way too convenient. It's cheating the story construction. I would be more impressed if the story doesn't need to pull something out of the blue to make it work. This needs some rewriting and a better lead but the overall premise holds real comedic promise."
