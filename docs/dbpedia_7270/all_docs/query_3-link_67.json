        "text": "(1936) Tags: RKO\n\nDavis v. RKO Radio Pictures\n\nPlaintiff claims to have been represented in the picture Bunker Bean in a libelous manner as an “object of public hatred, derision, ridicule, contempt and obloquy, individually and professionally.”\n\nThe allegations to the effect that defendants have produced and shown in motion picture theaters a picture known as “Bunker Bean,” wherein “plaintiff’s name `Cassandra’ or `Casandra’ a living person, is used” to present the plaintiff as “an illiterate, unkempt, slovenly, neglectful and low grade person; and as a cheat, faker, swindler, and surrounded with all the bunkum of witchery”; and that she was further represented as “a person of low and degraded morality and character and in a manner which did tend to hold her up to public ridicule and contempt.”\n\nJudgment: Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it fails to set forth a cause of action is granted in all respects."
