        "text": "Anne Savisa Boonchuy (แอน สาวิสา บุญช่วย) is the main protagonist of Amphibia. She is a 13-year-old Thai-American human girl in seventh grade, who in 2019, stole the Calamity Box under the influence of friends Sasha Waybright and Marcy Wu[16] on her 13th birthday.[17] After Anne opened the box, the three friends were transported to Amphibia.\n\nWhile lost on a strange, lily pad-shaped[18][19][20][21] island, Anne finds a new friend, an enthusiastic young frog named Sprig Plantar. Together they start seeking adventures and exploring the secrets of the world of Amphibia. Anne and her new frog family try to uncover the mystery behind the Calamity Box and a way to get Anne back home, along with trying to find Marcy and Sasha who were transported with her.\n\nAnne returns home alone with the Plantars in tow, and must keep their low profile as frog people a secret from the other humans while trying to find a way to return to Amphibia so she can rescue her friends and defeat King Andrias once and for all. At the same time, she must also thwart the various deadly schemes against her and her family that Andrias sends to Earth.[13] Anne eventually goes back to Amphibia and joins the resistance, aiming to defeat Andrias and end his reign.[15][22] After the invasion fails, and upon realizing that the red moon is falling because of the Core,[23] Anne, Sasha and Marcy are imbued with the gem powers to push it back. Unable to do so, Anne absorbs all the gem powers and destroys the moon and the Core, losing her life in the process. However, Anne is brought to a limbo-like dimension via a copy created by the gems' creator, who offers her a job to replace it as the new guardian of the multiverse, but she turns it down as she is still a teenager. It agrees to wait until Anne lives her entire human life to ask her again and sends her back to Amphibia, where she happily reunites with her friends. With the gem shards only able to open one more portal, she says her final goodbyes to the Plantars before returning home to LA alongside Sasha and Marcy.[24]\n\nTen years later, as an adult, Anne is a herpetologist who specializes in amphibians at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California, designing the entire exhibit after Amphibia and the friends she made there. Later, Sasha and Marcy, who are also adults, arrive at the aquarium to meet her and celebrate her 23rd birthday together.[24]\n\nAnne represented the blue gem of Heart on the Calamity Box.\n\nAppearance\n\nBody\n\nAnne is a Thai-American teenage girl with a slender build, and light brown skin and messy auburn hair. She is noticeably taller than Marcy but shorter than Sasha. Anne also has dark brown eyes. Anne has two small leaves and a stick stuck in her hair for the duration of her time on Amphibia. Even when she removes them when she changes outfits, they always reappear once she wears her normal outfit again or by the next episode. The leaves and stick are no longer present upon Anne's return to her world. Initially, they were absent when she returned to Amphibia,[15] however, by \"Commander Anne\", they were present again.\n\nWhen using her blue gem calamity powers, Anne has the ability to activate a super mode of sorts. When she does so, her hair, and eyes become a neon blue color and the sticks in her hair become antler-like, which have leaves growing off of them.[12]\n\nDuring the epilogue, Anne's now a young woman with her hair kept in a ponytail, and her legs are a bit thicker showing slight muscle growth.\n\nClothing\n\nDuring the first two seasons, Anne wore a school uniform as her everyday outfit. It consisted of a gray t-shirt with a purple collar and a Saint James Middle School (SJMS) crest embroidered on it, a short purple skirt, a pair of yellow sneakers with white lining, and gray socks. She also carried a magenta pink backpack with a TUFSTUF logo on it,[17] which contains all of her personal belongings. Following her transportation to Amphibia, she lost her right shoe, her right sock becomes slightly loose, and her shirt has a stain on the left front side. Following her return to Amphibia, Anne wears an identical school uniform, and a new pair of the same shoes.[15] Her shirt still gets stained when she is transported back to Amphibia[15], and she loses yet another shoe in \"Commander Anne\".\n\nAfter returning to Earth, she wore her casual clothes instead of her school uniform. These consisted of a white t-shirt with pink sleeves and an orange flame symbol on the front, light blue jean shorts, a yellow jacket with pockets and a dark frog symbol at the back that she tied around her waist, a pair of white socks with pink colors at the toe areas and a pair of purple and white sneakers.\n\nToward the end of her first stay in Amphibia and upon her return, she wears a gold chest armor with blue trim and frog symbol.[25][26][12][15]\n\nAnne has several other clothing appearances throughout the show:\n\nIn \"Lily Pad Thai\", she wore a piece of traditional Thai attire known as a \"Sabai,\" which consisted of a green wrapped skirt with geometric print, a cream breast cloth draped over one shoulder, a chain of flowers in her hair, and an elaborate flower bracelet on her wrist.\n\nIn \"Anne Hunter\", she imagined herself in a black suit with black boots and a chestplate. The leaves were also gone from her hair. She had a black bow and a blue-tipped arrow.\n\nIn \"Hop Pop and Lock\", Anne wore her bun on her head with a green ribbon tying it together, with a light pink headband. She also wore a green undershirt with a slightly darker pink T-Shirt. She also wore dark brown athletic shorts complemented by fuzzy purple and blue legging cuffs. During the dance, she wore a dark marine blue dress with her hair tied onto one side with a blue ribbon.\n\nIn \"Girl Time\", she wore her cleansed hair flat reaching her shoulders after a spa and haircut treatment. She also wore a dark lime and yellow knee-length dress with a cross-stitched across the chest, and light brown shoes with black laces.\n\nHer swimming kit consists of a sleeveless black shirt, with cyan linings across the sides. She wears lilac-colored shorts and dark aquamarine sandals, which contain yellow straps.[16][27]\n\nHer sleeping attire includes a plain white T-shirt along with black shorts with a violet-colored stripe.[28][5] Alternatively, her shorts are a light pink color, and in the flashback of \"The Beginning of the End\", they're shown to have a yellow stripe.\n\nIn \"Fight at the Museum\" and \"Froggy Little Christmas\", her sleeping attire is a blue T-shirt with dark trim neck line, dog print on the center, and pair of yellow shorts with pink and purple hearts on the bottom.\n\nIn \"Stakeout\" during her hallucination, she wore her normal clothing; however, her hair didn't have the leaves that are typically shown in the series. Instead, her hair glowed many shades of blue, purple, and pink, as her entire body, including a small twig in her hair, glowed with a blue and purple hue, which almost resembles her calamity powered hair.\n\nFor her Frog of the Year party, her hair was cleansed, straightened, and styled in a way that resembles a pixie cut.[29] She wore bachelor clothes consisting of a white tuxedo, a black bowtie, a powder blue undershirt, light gray lapels, a small gold button that pins the coat together, and a purple sash that wraps from her right shoulder all the way to her back.[29] Her dress shoes were peanut brown and of a darker shade near the toe, heel, and tongue and had black hidden knot laces.[29]\n\nIn \"The Big Bugball Game\", she wore black shorts and a Team Farmers shirt with purple and yellow stripes, and a yellow 'F' on the front. She also wore a blindfold at the end of the episode.\n\nIn the events immediately preceding her teleportation to Amphibia, her design was identical except that she has her right shoe.[17] During her time with the tax collectors and the battle at Toad Tower, Anne wore her normal outfit but along with brown metal breastplate armor, a green metal pauldron that has a frog foot symbol on her left shoulder and leather bands.[17]\n\nIn part of \"Civil Wart\" and \"New Wartwood\", Anne is seen wearing a dark gray zipped hoodie with darker hems and cuffs and a small SJMS crest on the front. In \"Wally and Anne\", she's seen wearing a similar hoodie, but with no crest and no zipper.\n\nDuring the episode \"Thai Feud\", Anne wore a green apron, a red bandana and a barrette.\n\nDuring the episode \"Temple Frogs\", Anne wore a Thai Go hat.\n\nAnne was sometimes shown without her yellow jacket,[30][31][32][14][33][34][35][36][37] or with it worn on her shoulders.[34][38]\n\nDuring her first Christmas since returning from Amphibia, Anne wore a light green Santa hat, green sweater, a yellow scarf, a red plaid skirt, a candy cane and mistletoe hairclip and a pair of brown Ugg boots.[37]\n\nAfter gaining her full calamity powers in \"The Hardest Thing\", Anne wears blue, white, and gold battle armor with a dark blue cape. The leaves and twigs in her hair all glow during this time.\n\nDuring the epilogue, Anne can be seen wearing a dark green collared shirt that has the logo of the Aquarium alongside a lanyard that has her I.D badge attached to it. Her hair is tied to a Thai-style scrunchie with leaves embroidered on it. She is also wearing cream-colored shorts with yellow and brown boots. She has a bandage at her right knee, and a butterfly bracelet on her left wrist.\n\nPersonality\n\nAnne is at first described as \"self-centered\" by the official series description and as \"fearless and independent\" by her voice actress, Brenda Song.[39] Anne, filled with an adventurous spirit and excitement, is fun-loving yet determined, and will not hesitate to protect her friends and family.\n\nAnne's characterization, much like most major characters in this show, has noticeable development throughout the show. When she first appeared, Anne, though appearing strong-willed and confident, was shown to be easily manipulated and lonely deep-down.[16] She was manipulated into skipping school,[17] vandalizing buildings[17] and robbing a thrift store[16] by her best friends. Unknowingly, she acted this way towards her new friend, Sprig, to a lesser extent, manipulating him into doing something he didn't wish to do.[16]\n\nAnne was also irresponsible and a bit of a rule-breaker, not respecting the limitations on her freedom within both Amphibia and the human world. Anne not only stole a music box while knowing it wasn't right to, but she also showcases somewhat of a stubborn personality.[16] This was shown throughout the series from when Anne pushed Sprig to go to the lake even though Hop Pop specifically told them not to as he was still having doubts about Anne - thinking how he shouldn't let a \"monster\" that is Anne wander outside and terrorize the town[16] (however, both of these instances had the underlying context of Anne's insecurity and lack of social confidence influencing her poor decisions out of fear of damaging the bonds with those close to her). Oftentimes, Anne knows the wrong decisions she makes aren't right, but she isn't willing to admit it unless she was under massive amounts of pressure. She learnt her mistake when she knew it wasn't the right idea to fake being ill, as it was likely the reason the rest of the Plantar family became sick due to an extra workload during a storm.[40] She did attempt to make up for her mistake by taking care of the Plantars in their sick state, but she didn't admit her errors to the family until she believed they were going to die from the \"disease\" they caught.[40] Following this incident, Anne became less conniving and manipulative after her laziness nearly got her adoptive family killed (or so they thought).\n\nBack on Earth, Anne was lazy and selfish, even if not overtly, with little interest about what was going on around herself and believing her problems were worse than others' because they were hers. Upon meeting the native Amphibians, Anne was taken aback by their way of living. It is only when she started living with the Plantars that she began to open up and learn more about herself. Anne realized that much of what she was brought up on made her somewhat materialistic, and she began to accept simpler ways of living (though she still relies on her cell phone and has apparently gotten others addicted to its functions). There are even parts of herself that she had suppressed that, thanks to Sprig and the rest of the Plantars, she has opened up to such as cooking.[8]\n\nDespite all of her flaws, Anne still proved herself brave, caring, compassionate and kind in her early days in Amphibia, even if she was alienated by her fellow townspeople. Although she initially trapped an unfamiliar world, Anne demonstrated an incredible amount of bravery. She was brave enough to hold back the red praying mantis that was twice her size, in the hopes that Sprig and the Wartwood townsfolk could flee unharmed.[7] A natural athlete, Anne is great at several athletic activities, such as basketball, volleyball, and swimming. She's also seen to be interested in and to participate in sports such as tennis and baseball (or a variation of it played by the Plantar siblings). Anne, at her core, is kind-hearted, though Anne's true selfless nature comes out when others are in danger. In these situations, Anne is willing to do seemingly anything to protect others, such as climbing entire mountains, fighting giant monsters and even standing up to entire armies. Eventually, Anne becomes not only a worthy member of the town, but a hero to most of its' townsfolk.\n\nAnne is a child of the modern era; a pop-culture enthusiast with a love for young-adult romance and adventure movies and TV and also reads manga. She has sometimes said slang words and internet acronyms such as \"Lit\", \"IRL\", \"BRB\", and used the shrug emoji when she wrote a letter to announce Sprig's breakup.[41] Anne would show a dislike to pineapples (especially as a pizza topping) and will threaten anyone mentioning them.[42] Whenever she has downtime, she's pretty much always seen on her phone, listening to music, watching shows and films she downloaded and sometimes looking at or showing others pictures of her home. Anne's obsession with her phone has been implied to be more sentimental in nature - as she is shown to care most for the uses and memories the phone contains.[43] During her stay in Amphibia, although she still appreciated her phone, she grew less attached to it and found other things to do in her spare time. When Sprig asked her about the disc, Anne claims that she's from another dimension and not the 90s.[44]\n\nAnne is shown to take great interest in the romantic lives of her loved ones - going far out of her way to try to make Sprig[45] and Hop Pop[46] confess their feelings to their respective crushes. Despite this, she can be downright brutal with her breakups, giving her the title of \"Angel of Death\" back on Earth.[41] She's also a practitioner of easy-break ups, advocating Sprig break up with Maddie via a letter.[41]\n\nAnne cares about her adoptive family very much and greatly enjoys hanging out with them, especially Sprig and Polly. In general, she acts very sisterly towards Sprig and Polly, almost always carrying Polly before she got her legs, and giving Sprig lots of advice on dating, having fun, and other things. She also cares about their needs, including when she was willing to break up Sprig and Maddie because of how anxious and stressed Sprig was feeling. Within the first few months of her stay, she starts referring to the Plantars as her family without hesitation. The tipping point of Anne's acceptance, however, came when the Tax Collectors came to town.[47] Though she joined them, she was the only member to show compassion for the residents and eventually used her sword-fighting skills to fight off the Tax Collectors, nearly getting killed in the process.[47] After the battle at Toad Tower, Anne told the Plantars that they were family to her.[17]\n\nAnne is also shown to have a particular desire for friends. However, Anne is also sometimes naïve, depicted in how she is easily manipulated by her human friends, so much so that she did anything to be friends with Sasha and Marcy, as she believed they wouldn't want to be friends with her if she didn't follow through with their requests. Anne explained to Sprig the unhealthy perception that friends help each other always without objection,[48] essentially blind obedience. Through her constant interaction with Sprig, a somewhat simple-minded child, Anne is able to look at friendship in a whole new way. She begins to desire a more compassionate friendship with those close to her.\n\nHer relationships with her friends also begin to unravel as it becomes apparent that much of her decisions were more the result of being pressured by their wants and needs, whether it be by manipulations from Sasha or feeling responsible for Marcy's clumsiness. During the battle at Toad Tower, she finally sees through Sasha's manipulative tactics thanks to Sprig, who sees Anne for who she is: a kind and considerate person who is willing to protect her friends.[17] Throughout the show, Anne has also become more open-minded regarding her human friends, even after learning what Sasha and Marcy did, as she was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, knowing that while they made many mistakes, neither of them truly wanted to cause her harm. This became even more evident after she had to leave them behind, vowing to find a way back to them, even after Marcy having just revealed her intentions about getting the girls to Amphibia.[37]\n\nBackground\n\nLife back on Earth\n\nAnne was born in 2006[49] to a Thai couple who immigrated to the United States from Bangkok, Thailand.[37] Growing up, Anne had a complicated relationship with her mother due to her lazy nature and loud tendencies,[50] but they still loved each other and at one point when she was little, Anne went on a trip to Thailand with her mom.[1] Anne also went to a Thai school to study the language, but only learned enough to barely put a sentence of Thai together.[31]\n\nWhen she was in kindergarten, she and her friend Marcy Wu befriended Sasha Waybright after she (relatively) protected them from some bullies[26] and since, they grew up together. Anne was a lazy student while attending school, preferring to slack off rather than study and would often go to the mail to intercept her report card to keep her mom and dad from finding out about her bad grades.[51] Over time, her friendship with Sasha became toxic as one time Sasha encouraged Anne and Marcy to have a dance party on their school's roof and blow off a rehearsal for a medieval school play and when they were caught, Anne took the blame and said she was the mastermind and her mother and father penalized her for a month.[52] She was bullied and picked on by a girl named Maggie for her family's customs, but Sasha would stick up for Anne and thus, Anne had to rely on Sasha for protection, even when Sasha made fun of Anne's Thai heritage as well.[17]\n\nIncident with the Calamity Box\n\nOn her 13th birthday, Sasha convinced Anne to ditch school and have fun at an arcade.[17] When Anne tried to leave in order to go to celebrate her birthday back home, Sasha strongarms her to blow it off[17] and rob a music box from a thrift store.[16] That night, when Anne, Sasha and Marcy are at the park, Anne opens the music box and they are suddenly transported away to Amphibia, a world with anthropomorphic frogs and dangerous creatures.[18][16] Anne arrives in Amphibia in the forest near Wartwood Swamp[18] where she stayed for a month[7] and was forced to live in a cave, which was very unpleasant for her, especially at night (as giant creatures tried to eat her).[53]\n\nArriving in Wartwood\n\nOne night, Anne spotted a resident of Wartwood, Wally Ribbiton, wandering alone and approached him for assistance, but the frog ran away in panic being unfamiliar of humans.[7] The next day, Anne wound up meeting another resident, Sprig Plantar, after saving him from a giant mantis.[7] Anne was then introduced to the residents of Wartwood and was taken in by the Plantar family, which included Sprig's sister, Polly, and their grandfather Hop Pop.[7] After moving into the Plantar Farm, Anne initially struggles with the local Amphibians' culture, and dealing with Amphibia's unfamiliar climate proves challenging as it is vastly different from Earth.\n\nOver time, she slowly adapts to her new setting through bonding with the Plantars. Throughout Anne's stay in Wartwood, Anne starts to see friendship and relationships in a whole new light thanks to her frequent engagement with Sprig. She starts to yearn for a more caring relationship with everyone she cares for, while also discovering more about herself she never thought of before.\n\nBecoming a Hero\n\nAs Anne stays in the small town more and more, she becomes more accepted and even loved by the townspeople, and Anne herself becomes better integrated into the town. Making herself at home with the Plantars, Anne helps out with the farm, sells their goods, shops at local stores, works at Stumpy's Diner for a short period to assist cooking for the frogs, saves townsfolk from various monsters, and even becomes a symbol of town pride briefly. Her personal growth and goodwill toward Wartwood finally culminates on the night of the town's annual Frog of the Year, where the citizens vote Anne as the winner.[29] Anne celebrates with everyone in the special occasion, until Toadie approaches Anne that \"a friend\" is waiting outside of town for her.[29] Anne approaches the bridge, where a hooded figure is waiting—and reveals herself as Sasha.[29] The two girls are overjoyed to see the other safe, but, to Anne's shock, Sasha has affiliated herself with Captain Grime and the toad army.[29]\n\nSasha offers the frogs to a banquet honoring Anne and Sasha's reunited alliance. While astonished and suspicious of Sasha's new allies, Anne approves the invitation, and together with the frogs of Wartwood, they travel to Toad Tower. As the frogs attend the banquet, Anne and Sasha hang out in Sasha's room. Sasha explains to Anne that the banquet was a trap to get Hop Pop to the tower to be fed to a giant Venus flytrap for inspiring rebellions in the valley as a result of his failed campaign. Anne leaves the room to save the frogs. Anne disguises herself as Sasha and entering the banquet, and leads the frogs through the underground sewage to try and find the exit. Eventually, Anne finds an exit to the sewers, only to be confronted by Sasha and the toad soldiers.[17]\n\nAs Hop Pop is led to be executed, Anne implores Sasha to free them, but she tries to silence Anne again, as she did on Earth. A furious Sprig, who knows Anne as a truly kind and considerate girl, throws mud at Sasha, calls her a bully, and helps Anne. Sasha is enraged by Sprig's defiance and attempts to kill him, but Anne intervenes, finally standing up to her. Grime then steps in, offering to release the frogs if Anne can beat Sasha in a duel. Anne beats Sasha by jabbing her blade into hers, knocking her down and forcing her to lose her sword and dagger, causing Sasha's face to be cut. Anne stands over Sasha and declares that she will no longer allow Sasha to push her around. However, Grime does not hold his promise and goes out of his way to kill Hop Pop. At that moment, Toad Tower erupts from Wally's boomshrooms. Toad Tower begins to crumble before Grime can kill Hop Pop. Anne precariously manages to catch Sasha from a crumbling ledge, but out of shame over the way she treated her and to save Anne, Sasha lets herself fall, forcing Captain Grime to escape with an unconscious Sasha. The Plantars apologize to Anne over losing Sasha as a friend when they return to Wartwood, but Anne assures them it's okay because she considers them her family and that as long as they stick together, they'll get through everything.[17]\n\nAdventure out of Wartwood\n\nAnne and the Plantars set out on a trip to Newtopia in order to find Anne's way home; but, after a battle with a gigantic alien vegetable beast, Anne's eyes started to shine.[10] During their path, they come across an abandoned factory and flee until it collapses; however, they are unaware that just before it collapsed, the factory produced a frog-like robot, which then pursues Anne and the Plantars.[44] Anne is reunited with Marcy, her other human companion, as she arrives at Newtopia.[54] During a mission to drive away a colony of giant bloodthirsty Barbari-Ants, Anne still believes Marcy needs defense, but Marcy proves to be self-sufficient (although Marcy is still a little clumsy).[54] After successfully completing their task, Anne tells Marcy about her battle with Sasha, and they both vow to work together not only to reunite with Sasha, but also to find a safe way home.[54] Although King Andrias seems to be a jovial and kindly monarch when the Plantars are introduced to them, he seems to be planning something concerning the human girls and the Calamity Box.[54]\n\nAnne and Sprig's relationship becomes ever deeper after learning about each other's mothers during one of their journeys in Newtopia. Anne misses her mother so much that she goes to considerable lengths to procure a present for her when she finally comes to Earth and is reunited with her mother.[50] Sprig tells Anne that his mother died when he and Polly were very young, and he has no recollection of her; as Sprig asks how you would miss anyone you don't know, Anne gives him a huge hug and both of them weep.[50]\n\nDuring their sleepover, Anne, Sprig, Polly, and Marcy venture down to the castle's cellar, which is strictly off limits, where they find a submerged tomb full of mysterious monsters, two halls of mirrors, a chamber with plants that don't need sunlight to rise, and a torn portrait of King Andrias with an unknown frog and toad.[5] They hear the next morning from King Andrias that the music box that brought Anne, Sasha, and Marcy to Amphibia once belonged to his ancestors who used to travel to other worlds.[55] All of the box's gems must be recharged at three separate temples in order for the box to function again.[55]\n\nRecharging the Box\n\nWhen they returned to Wartwood, Anne was upset to find that Hop Pop had lied to her about hiding the music box when it went missing, but she put her indignation aside to help Hop Pop rescue Sprig and Polly and recover the box.[56] After she forgave Hop Pop, he showed Anne an old book that had belonged to the Plantar family for years, and she heard the name of the music box from it.[56] Anne and Hop Pop's relationship was already strained,[56][57] but after their first temple mission, they decided to sort it out together.[57]\n\nOn their way to the second temple, Anne ran into Valeriana,[58] whom she had seen previously at the Bizarre Bazaar.[59] Valeriana revealed that she was a member of an ancient order that investigated the Calamity Box. Anne was put through a series of tests, and she eventually paid for her previous greedy deeds. Valeriana declares Anne passed the test after watching her actually learn from her mistakes and accept responsibility. Anne, on the other hand, left before the gem had completely charged in order to assist Marcy and the Plantars who she thought was in danger.[58]\n\nSasha arrived at the third and final temple and rescued Anne, the Plantars, and Marcy, who then apologized for her wrongdoings. Anne was cynical at first, but she agreed to assist them in fulfilling their task. Anne then gained back some trust in Sasha after she stood up for herself and faced a giant stone toad protector in a chamber of extreme gravity. Anne agreed to start again with Sasha after Sasha beat the guardian and the third stone was recharged. Sasha, on the other hand, was deceiving her to get into Newtopia as part of Grime's invasion plot, but she felt bad about it.[26]\n\nRestoring Friendships\n\nSasha and Grime are invited over for supper by Anne, Marcy, and the Plantars to bury the hatchet. While things appear to be going well at first, when prior disagreements are brought up, everyone becomes awkward with one another. Sasha loses control and lashes out at Anne and Marcy for attempting to alter her. Grime's cake transforms into a lethal challenge, forcing the girls to save everyone. After the struggle, Anne explains that she doesn't want her to change as much as she wants Sasha to see her change. Sasha agrees that Anne is no longer the shy girl she had to protect back on Earth, and the two reconcile before joining the rest of the group in devouring chocolate-covered hornets.[52]\n\nSince the Toad Tower event, Wartwood has been on edge since Sasha and Grime have returned. As a result, Mayor Toadstool consulted the wheel of fun to come up with a stress-relieving activity, and the outcome was a Battle of the Bands. Sasha and the Sharps, Anne, Marcy, and Sasha's previous garage band, want to regroup right away. They had various difficulties, but Sasha ultimately changed her mind and gave an incredible performance. Following the competition (which Grime won thanks to his three-hour harp solo on \"The Serenity of Nature\"), Anne announces that she, Marcy and Sasha are leaving for home. Anne proposes that everyone in Wartwood take a group photo, which everyone does.[60]\n\nSasha, King Andrias, and Marcy's Betrayals\n\nThe music box is brought to Newtopia by the three human girls, the Plantars, Grime, and Frobo. Sprig is disappointed that the journey is finished, but Anne reminds them that they can see each other whenever they want as long as they have the music box. As soon as Anne is ready to deliver the box over to Andrias, it is forcibly taken by Sasha and Grime, who reveal their plan to take over Newtopia by imprisoning the king and signaling the concealed toad warriors. Anne is enraged that Sasha has deceived her again, and she refuses to accompany her. Sasha orders Anne, Marcy, the Plantars, Frobo, and Lady Olivia to the dungeon when she fails to discover out how to utilize the box to bring Anne back to Earth. They are rescued by General Yunan while being taken down the corridor, and they reunite in Sal's old sandwich restaurant. The gang becomes despondent when Marcy warns them that the rest of the toad army will arrive in less than an hour, but Anne inspires them to fight back and devises a strategy. Hop Pop, Marcy, and Olivia would free Andrias from the dungeon, while Polly, Yunan, and Frobo would attack the city's toads from the front. Meanwhile, Anne and Sprig would shut the gate, preventing the toad army from entering. Sasha arrives just as they shut the gate to tell Anne about the awful secret she had discovered about King Andrias, but Anne ignores her and the two fight. Sprig beats Grime by striking him with Barrel's Warhammer, while Anne defeats Sasha by putting her own cloak over her head.[12]\n\nWhen Anne presented Andrias with the box, he informed everyone there about a period when his friends abandoned him, that the music box was taken from him, and that no one remembers what Amphibia was like 1,000 years ago, but now that he has it back, he will utilize its power to return Newtopia to greatness. Andrias then revealed that his ancestors were not explorers as he had previously said, but \"glorious\" conquerors as he placed the music box on a pedestal to power up his castle, allowing it to fly, and then he reactivated ancient factories across Amphibia, resulting in a mechanical frog-bot military force that swarmed the castle in seconds. Andrias then revealed, much to everyone's disbelief, that he intended to follow in his ancestors' footsteps by journeying to other worlds and conquering them, beginning with the human world Earth. When Anne and Sasha informed the king they would stop him, he decided to show off his might and warning to the human girls by destroying the North Toad Tower with his castle's gigantic energy cannon. Anne laments her failure to listen to Sasha and see what was right in front of them. Marcy stood out, claiming that this was not part of the plan he had given her, only for the gigantic newt to acknowledge that he had been lying to her all along. When Anne with Sasha demanded what Marcy and Andrias were talking about, Marcy stated that Andrias promised to bring them to other planets/worlds so they could have endless 'adventures'; when Anne questioned as to why, Andrias informed everyone that Marcy deliberately stranded them in Amphibia, leaving both Anne and Sasha stunned. Marcy said she was aware of the Calamity Box's potential and claimed that her father had accepted a new job out of state and that her family was relocating; she intended to use the box to transport the three of them to a world where they would always be together. Marcy then tried to justify her actions by reminding them of their fun adventure, how Anne and Sasha have grown as people in Amphibia, and how Anne's friendship with Sprig is all because of her, only for Anne to back away in distress and disgust, leaving Marcy on her knees crying and saying she didn't want to be alone.[12]\n\nAnne looks around and realizes that though she and her 2 human friends had made many mistakes, what Andrias was doing was pure evil, and she vows to stop him, rallying her friends to face the king and his new mechanical troops; Sasha decides to redeem herself this time for real, while Marcy pulls herself together as both join the fight; Hop Pop and Grime team up to destroy some of the king's new mechanical army; Yunan protects Oliva after both defected from Andrias, Sprig fends of some bots with his slingshot and Frobo is destroyed while protecting Polly. Andrias grabs Sprig and threatens to throw him off the castle just as Polly (who just gained her legs) takes the music box back.[12]\n\nAn Abrupt Return to Earth\n\nAnne begs Andrias to give back Sprig when the gang agrees with his condition, but he refuses and instead drops him out of the castle window to die. The sadness then turned into anger caused by Andrias' deed unleashes the power of the blue gemstone still connected within her, and she battles Andrias and destroying his military force ferociously as everyone is in amazement and shock of her incredible strength. Anne powers down after knocking the wind out of King Andrias, and Sprig, who was saved by Marcy, comes up to her, thrilled that he is still alive, while her surrogate frog family embraces. Andrias pulls himself up after seeing she can't fully control her power and decides he can't let Anne survive, but Marcy uses the Calamity Box to open a gateway to Earth while Sasha and Grime keep the king occupied. Anne and the Plantars, as well as Frobo's head, leap through. Anne beckons Marcy to come with, but Andrias uses his laser sword to stab her from the back right out of her chest while Anne and the others watch in horror. Marcy apologizes for her conduct just as she collapses from the seemingly deadly wound, dropping the Calamity Box which closes the portal and sends Anne with the Plantars away from Amphibia. When Anne and the Plantars awaken, they find themselves on a green car during a daytime traffic jam in Anne's home. Anne, while glad to finally be back home, is saddened that she had to leave Sasha and the gravely-injured Marcy behind.[12]\n\nReuniting with Family\n\nAnne and the Plantars find themselves in the middle of traffic on the streets of Los Angeles.[12][13] Scared, they immediately run to safety and take in their surroundings. Anne decides that they need to head back to her place as she had been gone for five months and her parents are worried sick. Not wanting to freak them out, Anne has the Plantars hide so that she can ease her parents into telling them everything; however, she decides to keep King Andrias' invasion, Sasha and Marcy's betrayals, and her Calamity powers a secret until they feel trustworthy enough of her. Unsurprisingly, her mother and father are happy to see their daughter return after so long. However, the moment is ruined when the Plantars, misinterpreting a bird cawing as Anne's signal, reveal themselves, shocking the Boonchuys.[13]\n\nAnne puts together a presentation explaining what she has been doing all this time (but left out the events of \"True Colors\" to avoid more panic), while the Boonchuys are amazed that she went through so much, they are unsure about wanting to keep the Plantars with them. Scared that someone will take them and do something terrible to them, Anne insists that they stay and the Boonchuys finally agree.[13]\n\nAfter returning home, Anne had discovered Marcy's journal in her backpack and began writing in it. While having dinner with her parents, Anne and her parents agree not to tell Sasha and Marcy's families what happened to them as it would upset them and they would go to the authorities. Though Anne knows it's wrong to keep this information from them, but it's the only way to keep them safe. She also learned that Mr. Wu delayed his job offer out of state until Marcy returns. Anne even taped pictures of Sasha and Marcy's respective families in the journal. Anne also had trouble sleeping as she could not stop thinking about Sasha and Marcy and worried that Marcy may not be alive after witnessing her get stabbed by Andrias.\n\nThe Boonchuys continue to pamper Anne and she has finally had enough. She demands that she be given space, yet also wants to go to the market so that she can show the Plantars around. The Boonchuys are shocked as Anne never liked going to the market, but Hop Pop explains that Anne has significantly matured and that he trusts her. Anne disguises the Plantars as they head to market and see the food that it has to offer including the pungent durians and after shows how responsible she has become her parents to take the frogs to try some delicious noodles. As the Plantars are loving the noodles Sprig spots a silver Frobot with cloaking tech that was sent by King Andrias to kill Anne as it grabs her and starts squeezing the girl, but Sprig manages to distract it and run. Not wanting to alert her parents, Anne and the Plantars pretend like nothing is amiss.[13]\n\nAnne and the Plantars fight the Cloak-Bot and realize that it too is trying to remain discreet and trick it into running into a freezer. The Plantars freeze and the drone attempts to attack them. Enraged by this, Anne unleashes her blue gem power and destroys a chunk of the robot which flees. Upon escaping the freezer, Anne collapses and the Plantars use a durian to wake her. The Boonchuys, none the wiser, commend Anne for being mature as she and the Plantars remain quiet about the incident. Anne decides that she does not want to use her powers as it severely weakens her. Elsewhere, the Cloak-Bot is recuperating and decides to double down on its efforts to kill Anne.[13]\n\nAdventures on Earth with the Plantars\n\nSometime after the encounter with the Cloak-Bot, Anne continues helping the Plantars fit in on Earth but also has trouble controlling them: Sprig almost touched a fan, Polly nearly got into a fight with some kids, and Hop Pop almost fell for a scam. She decided to take them to the mall in order to teach them the things that they weren't supposed to be doing. Anne had Polly go to a Construct-a-Carnivore store, Sprig look at some art statues without touching them and Hop Pop go through some stands and not fall for any scams. Anne went on the second floor to watch them to make sure that Polly doesn't get into fights with the other kids, Sprig doesn't touch any of the statues, and Hop Pop doesn't fall for any scams. However, Anne had an unexpected reunion with Gabby Williams, a friend of hers who was also at the mall and asked where she was for the past five months.\n\nAnne told her she was in Alaska with some relatives and then Gabby started to tell her the latest gossip story she missed, though Anne tried to get away but Gabby kept popping up and continued telling her the story. Suddenly, Anne noticed the Plantars were in trouble: Polly was being chased by angry mothers, Sprig was rolling on a big ball, and Hop Pop was being chased by a security guard for jumping into a well and taking coins that were in there. Anne managed to save them and left the mall. The Plantars apologized and admitted it reminded of their time back in Amphibia on how they had to get Anne out of trouble. Before heading home, Hop Pop tells them that he's starting to get itchy from the well that dyed him green.\n\nOne day, while having breakfast, Sprig was trying to fit in with the family but is needed to be reminded that he's a guest and Anne had to help calm him down. So she and her parents decided to take Sprig to Thai Go in order to keep him out of trouble. While helping out at the restaurant, Ned, who loved coming to Thai Go was surprised to see Anne back. Ned revealed he owns a Thai Go truck and wants the restaurant's recipes, but Anne's mom refused. Upon seeing Sprig causing trouble with customers outside at Ned's truck, she and her mom dragged him inside and her mom doubled her shift. While taking out the trash, she spotted Sprig getting inside Ned's truck in an attempt to get rid of it. Anne tried to stop him, but ended up coming on a wild ride.\n\nThey tried to stop, but the brakes weren't working until they stop at a skating park. Mrs. Boonchuy and Ned show up where Sprig confessed his reason in doing this. Ned broke down crying and realized that taking Thai Go's recipes is culturally insensitive, but Mrs. Boonchuy decided to hire him as a Thai Go delivery boy. After Ned leaves, Anne witnesses her mom yell at Sprig for his actions and told him he was family. Anne later told her mom that Sprig doesn't have a mom and that he lost his parents to Herons when he was very young.\n\nThe next morning, Mrs. Boonchuy gave Sprig pancakes with cockroaches on them. Anne was reading a magazine to find interdimensional travels, but found nothing. As the Plantars relaxed, Sprig reveals to Hop Pop that they have been on Earth for a week, which shocks both Hop Pop and Polly. Hop Pop believes they're freeloaders just like their \"Cousin\" Stanley, which confuses Anne. The Plantars explain that Stanley had stayed with them for a long time, but Sprig doesn't believe he was really their cousin as he witnessed him coloring his body orange with Plantar Paint.\n\nDespite being their guest, the Plantars started to resent Stanley everyday until they finally had enough of him and threw him out the window, much to Anne's surprise. Mrs. Boonchuy comes to tell Anne it's time for her dentist appointment since she has been gone for five months and Mrs. Boonchuy has a feeling she hasn't been brushing her teeth. Though Anne tells her, she has to take Domino to the vet, but Mr. Boonchuy couldn't because he had to work at Thai Go. Luckily, the Plantars decided to help bring Domino to the vet. Anne gave them the address before heading to the dentist. While at the dentist, Anne had eight cavities and cricket legs between her teeth, she was then heavily dosed with morphine and came home loopy and left under the care of the Plantars.\n\nWhile loopy, she tells Hop Pop that Domino was the alpha and omega and wouldn't let go of Hop Pop's cheeks.\n\nA New Quest\n\nAnne began searching various ways to return to Amphibia, while the Plantar seemed excited about the idea of being in a new world for the first few days, but as the days passed they began to miss being in Amphibia, resulting in Anne becoming obsessed with finding a way to return to Amphibia. Anne also went to the Thrift Store where she, Sasha, and Marcy stole, hoping to get answers on how the Calamity Box ended up there only to discover it had close sometime ago. [36] When Anne and the Plantars went to a museum, they found an ancient vase with a picture of a frog and and the Calamity Box; finding their first real clue, they are once again attacked by Andrias' Frobot Assassin. After driving it away yet again, they decided to enlist the help of their new friend Dr. Jan, who saw them fighting the robot and the frogs without their disguises. After earning their trust, Dr. Jan promises to do some research.[30] Dr. Jan arrived at the Thai Temple after Anne and her friends fought of some robotic dragonfly drones sent by the Cloak-Bot and used Marcy's journal to reveal the hidden message on the vase \"Seek the Mother of Olms she will guide you to your destiny\", but nobody knew what that meant.[31]\n\nThe Truth Revealed\n\nAt the Boonchuy home, Anne's parents are impressed with how mature she has gotten over the recent events, but Anne is overcome with guilt and is ready to explain to them that a killer robot is chasing her, and to tell them everything else that happened in Amphibia.[14]\n\nAs she is ready to explain, she discovers a workout room where her mom would \"work out\" her suffering while Anne was gone by making sculptures of her daughter.[14] At that moment, thanks to a recently reactivated Frobo,[32] the killer bot shows up ready to take out his target.[14]\n\nThe family escapes and leads into a high-speed chase throughout Los Angeles while the countdown clock in its torso keeps ticking down towards its ultimate demise.[14]\n\nThe family ends up in a junkyard, where Anne realizes that her mother had unrealistic expectations for her and she in turn is angered that her daughter would lie to her, which makes Anne finally see what it feels like break someone's trust and to be treated that way like how Anne was to Hop Pop, Sasha and Marcy. Mrs. Boonchuy starts using the trash to build figures of Anne to trick the robot. The robot discovers the real Anne (while she's attacking it) and traps her when Anne's mom comes in and uses a sledge hammer to incapacitate the robot and the rest of the family starts attacking. They realize too late that the robot is set to explode in a matter of seconds and Anne's glowing blue hair protective instincts kick in and she kicks what's left of the robot out of the atmosphere by her right foot where it explodes.[14]\n\nRealizing why Anne did what she did, Mrs. Boonchuy comforts her unconscious daughter and they drive home on good terms. That high speed chase however, did capture the eye of someone at the FBI though, who decides to call \"Mr. X\" while looking at footage of the robot chasing the family van with Anne and the Plantars seen in the camera.[14]\n\nTrouble with the FBI\n\nOne day, Anne and the Plantars decide to go to see movies at Super Cinema 40, unaware that some unusual government force is trying to track them. Mr. X eventually arrives as they try to fight him and hide before they are rescued by Anne's parents who knew about the incident and did their own ways to stop it.[33] Mr. X again tried to capture them as Hop Pop was auditioning for Mitch Harbor's newest film at Hollywood, only for him to fail as he gave his part to Humphrey Westwood.[35]\n\nProgress on her quest\n\nAs the Plantars felt homesick, Anne was contacted by Dr. Jan, saying she has found a scientist who may help the four return to Amphibia. Despite her warning about her validity, she takes the Plantars to Dr. Frakes' Brainasium to meet Dr. Frakes, only to be greeted by Terri in Frakes' office door.[36]\n\nEntering the office, Dr. Frakes reveals at the same time the Calamity Box was opened months ago, a rare energy surge caused an interdimensional portal to open, allowing them to redo the experiment multiple times, although none of the guests believe her. As the portal failed to open one to Amphibia, a surge exposed the Plantars as frog people from another world, prompting Anne and Terri to team up to stop Frakes from dissecting them, even if it means Terri would give up their job. Anne successfully manages to defeat Frakes by throwing her homemade cicada cookies around her, allowing the toddlers to overrun her as they escape.[36]\n\nInside Terri's car, they agree they would build the four a portal so they can return home, not before Sprig decides to drive the car, nearly causing it to crash.[36]\n\nChristmas with the Plantars\n\nWhen the Plantars saw Mrs. Boonchuy decorating the house, they believed they were being attacked, only for Anne to calm them down and tell them it was Christmas. She started explaining some bits of the holiday to them. Mrs. Boonchuy gets a call about joining the Christmas-Palooza Parade, only to turn it down because they need to keep a low profile from both Mr. X and King Andrias. Anne secretly calls back about joining the parade. She explains to the Plantars that they are going to make a Thai Go Float for the parade as a surprise. First, they visit Ally and Jesse who are throwing a party with their robots and asks for them to join them for the parade and make the float. They then visit Dr. Jan and borrow some of the exhibits for the float.[37]\n\nUnaware to Anne, King Andrias sends a dragonfly drone to search for Anne and destroy her. Anne and the Plantars began working on the float with the help of the Thai Community, Ally, and Jesse. The next day on Christmas Eve, she and the Plantars surprised her parents with the float, much to their joy. They then joined the parade. Seeing her mom sad, Anne tries to comfort her only to discover that the parade is also about being welcomed into the community. However, while enjoying the parade, Andrias locates her and sees her saying her name out loud to the crowd. Just as her father was about to take a picture of her, her mom, and the Plantars, Andrias had taken control of a large Santa float and said her name out loud.[37]\n\nTo her surprise, King Andrias has found her and then attacks her, her parents and the Plantars while they were on the float by throwing a giant candy cane at them. They took off, as Andrias used the robotic Santa to chase after them and destroy them. Anne, her parents, and the Plantars attempt to fight back by throwing some stuff from their float, but have no effect though the giant cookie prop did had effect on the robot. They come upon a dead end and have nothing left to fight back. Andrias informs Anne this is the end of her, even saying she's been a bad girl this year. However, they fire the tree at the robot and destroy the drone, but not before telling Andrias \"Merry Christmas\". Anne saw what appeared to be snow only to discover it was ash.[37]\n\nLater, Anne, her parents, and the Plantar family return home. Despite about what happened, they had a good time. Before heading inside, Anne finally tells the Plantars what Christmas is really about; it's about spending time with the people you love and care. Sprig gave her a present which turns out to be a figurine of her, because she is Sprig's hero. They head inside to go enjoy some cookies. However, while Anne's parents and the Plantars were asleep, Anne is worried about Sasha and Marcy, realizing this is her first Christmas without them, she decides to write anonymous letters to the Wus and Waybrights and inform them that their daughters are trapped in another world and promises to bring them home no matter what. The next day on Christmas, Anne gives her mom the butterfly pin that she won from Pearl.[37]\n\nReturn to Amphibia\n\nWith everything but a proper power source ready to create a portal to Amphibia, Anne, her parents, and the Plantars head off to Spendco to pick up some last minute things for both the portal and for themselves. Anne starts to show fear and sadness over the thought of leaving her parents after just reuniting with them and tries to talk to them only for Mr. X and the FBI to finally catch up to them and kidnap the Plantars. Knowing that they must rescue the Plantars at all costs, Anne, Terri, Dr. Jan, and Anne's parents recruit Molly Jo, Humphrey Westwood, Ally, Jess on their mission and reveal to them the truth about both the Plantars and Amphibia, as well as two women from the Thai community who were already aware of this.[15]\n\nBy disguising Humphrey as a giant frog, the group manages to sneak into the base only to get captured when Mr. X tricks them with the same frogs and tadpole they previously used to trick him. Anne breaks down and laments over how she will be able to leave her family and take King Andrias down. Her parents tell her that she is stronger than she knows as she was able to survive for months in Amphibia and continue fighting even when all seemed loss and promises to help her continue the fight on Earth while she's in Amphibia. The power then shuts down courtesy of Terri and Dr. Jan (who broke off from the group to obtain a power generator that they believe will provide enough power to open the portal). This allows everyone to escape and for them to break the Plantars out.[15]\n\nBack at the warehouse, they open the portal only for the generator to not have enough power. To make matters worse, Mr. X and the FBI manage to track them down. Anne, who is getting better control of her powers, uses them to power the portal and unleash a giant praying mantis on the FBI while she returns to Amphibia after saying goodbye to her family. She and the Plantars are happy to be back and ready to take King Andrias down only to be shocked to find Amphibia reduced to a wasteland.[15]\n\nHelping the Resistance\n\nShe and the Plantars then return to Wartwood, only to find it in ruins but discover that the townspeople have formed a rebellion against Andrias with Sasha leading it and are using the tunnels below the Plantar Farm as their secret hideout. However, after reuniting with Anne, Sasha decides to hand command over to her, despite her reluctance. The resistance's first mission is to destroy a factory where mind control collars are being produced, but it quickly becomes apparent that Sasha is better prepared for the job than Anne who keeps making various mistakes throughout the day. They finally manage to find the factory which is surrounded by a spiky gorge. Rather than do the obvious such as using a rope to get across, Anne has everyone stack on top of each other and make a bridge. The plan fails, but Sasha uses her skills to save everyone in the nick of time. At that moment, a giant snake with a mind control collar comes up and attacks the group. Anne tries to direct their attacks, but everyone gets swallowed whole.[22]\n\nAnne begs Sasha to take control, but she refuses as the last time she took control, she nearly ruined their friendship with her selfishness. Anne allows herself to be swallowed; urging Sasha to take control once again and direct everyone to widen themselves in the snake's throat so that it can cough them out. They break off its collar where it slithers away and proceed to blow up the factory. Anne finally convinces Sasha to take command again as she is better at it and she does so; Sasha agrees to take the lead but guarantees Anne that they will co-lead the resistance as partners. Anne is happy to be back with Sasha and furthermore is confident that they will rescue Marcy.[22]\n\nAt the Resistance Underground Base Sasha and Anne give a group of rebels (Mrs. Croaker, Wally, Maddie, Loggle and Toadie) their mission; get their stolen weapons back from a marauder's camp. With everyone getting briefed, Toadie decides to do what he always does and what's in his comfort zone and stay as the lookout, despite encouragement from other members of the squad that he is capable of so much more. Everyone are captured by the marauders, while the humans get away with ease. Anne is ready to go back and save her friends, but Sasha advises against it, knowing they can be captured as well. Sasha knows the strength of this team and suggests they just wait a bit, they'll be able to get out of the situation that they're in, suggesting that they train in the meantime. The Frogs were captured, and to their surprise, the leader of the Marauders turns out to be Barry who plans to sell the rebels to Andrias as he pays a hefty price for them and doesn't even take Crocker serious. After a while, Anne still feels all hope is lost and is ready to help her friends, fully believing Sasha sees them as only soldiers that are disposable. Finally, it comes to a head and the subtle hinting at this philosophy is fully exposed. Meanwhile, back at the camp, Toady has a revelation that he is in fact stronger than he thinks, and takes over the group and comes up with a plan to escape. Everyone has an assignment and the group makes their getaway. Outside the camp, Anne and Sasha are full blown fighting now in lieu of training, and Sasha insists that she knows what's going on. In the distance, there is an explosion with Sasha all but saying \"See I told you\" and running towards the camp to aid with their getaway. While the team is making their way home, Sasha reminds Anne of something that Anne once told her; that sometimes you have to stop and remember to have faith in the people around you. [61]\n\nJourney to Proteus\n\nThe Resistance gets together to discuss what to do after having destroyed Andrias' factories and taken out his bases. Anne suddenly remembers that they found a message back on Earth that tells them to find the Mother of Olms. Sprig and Polly remember that the only olms they have encountered are Lysil and Angwin from Quarreler's Pass and Anne, Sasha and the Plantars head there, only to discover drills everywhere on the path. They go into a cave and find the two headed olm whom they immediately demand answers from. The two admit that they could find the Mother of Olms in the city of Proteus, but they were banished for their bickering during guard duty causing the near destruction of the city. Luckily, Sasha convinces them to help them out. When they reach their destination Parisia, the guardian of the city of Proteus who is stubbornly in denial about King Andrias' forces closing in on them and refuses to help or be offered help from others. However after Lysil and Angwin both agree to put their lives on the line to rescue Proteus from a giant drill and after Sasha insults her for continuing to deny everything, Parisia was so impressed she allows the group to see the Mother of Olms and begrudgingly allowed the twins back into the Proteus (under heavy supervision).[62]\n\nMeeting Mother Olm, recruiting new allies\n\nAnne, Sasha and the Plantars are taken into Mother Olm's chamber. There, they finally encounter the thousands-year old mystic to ask her about the prophecy of the music box. Too bad she doesn't remember it. Something that happens when you get old, I guess. Hop Pop seems to be facing the same dilemma, realizing his joints aren't what they once were, and feels like he is a growing hindrance as opposed to being helpful. When Mother Olm suggests that the group go into her brain to spread some \"brain cream\" along it to help stir her memory, Hop Pop stays behind. Mother Olm's usual doctor, Dr. Yohan, who spread the cream has gone missing, and she desperately needs it to stop the crazy migraines she is having and might be able to retrieve the prophecy she can't seem to remember. The gang ventures into Mother Olm's gigantic body, which Sasha claims is the worst mission ever, and Hop Pop stays behind with Mother Olm for a cup of tea. The cup being so large that Hop Pop is actually able to soak in the tea like a hot tub. Together, he and Mother Olm discuss that yeah, they're old, but over the course of their lives they still have plenty of worth thanks to their years of gathering wisdom. Inside Mother Olm, after a few disgusting encounters with ear wax, the group finally makes it to brain. Unfortunately for Sprig, they discover the body of missing Dr. Yohan, but he is long gone. Together, they begin spreading the cream when Polly hears a weird flapping noise. Anne shines her light and discovers a swarm of batsquitos who have now awaken (thanks to the light) and begin to feed, also explaining Mother Olm's migraines. The gang falls into Mother Olm's nose and Hop Pop can hear them screaming for help. Using the wisdom that he has gained throughout his life vegetable farming, he calculates what's growing in Mother Olm's chamber and quickly concocts a smell filled with allergens that can get mother Olm to sneeze out the gang. Now that the Batsquito colony was out of her brain he migraines were finally gone, but even with that and the cream applied she still can't remember. Turns out the brain cream was several decades expired. Again, Hop Pop says that with his advanced age if he needs to remember something he'll usually write it down.[63]\n\nMother Olm realizes she must have thought the same and looks up at the most likely place she would have written such a thing. The ceiling. Sure enough, there it is. \"Three stars burning bright come from beyond to expel the night. Should they fight or embrace the fall? Their choice will determine the fate of all.\" Sasha asking if her, Anne, and Marcy are the three stars. Mother Olm asks if they burn bright with the power of the stones, which we know that Anne does, though she can't control it. This implies that the other two, Sasha and Marcy, will eventually get their \"cool anime powers\" too, but since King Andrias has stolen the music box, he has stolen access to their powers, but since Anne still has some of her powers, she can restore the power to her friends. The olms believe the stones are meant for a greater purpose should be left alone, but others believe the stones should be used for conquest, and their arrogance and greed has created something unnatural that \"does not sleep and will not die.\" She also says that the olms believe that three of them were summoned to help save the residents of Amphibia from what they've become, the worst version of themselves.[63] Now that the human girls know they need to get to music box back from Andrias now more than ever, they decide that Wartwood Resistance should find a lot more recruits so Sasha decide they should start by by joining forces with the Toad Army lead by Grime's sister Captain Beatrix. She was reluctant at first but they manage to convince her when Spig defeated her in a duel.[64] With that the Resistance gained numerous mighty warriors to join their ranks. With that the resistance gained numerous mighty warriors to join their ranks. Thanks to Hop Pop, a former enemy Apothecary Gary was persuaded to join the resistance as well.[65]\n\nMeeting old faces\n\nAnne and Sprig where looking at the supply cart with some of the newts guarding it when rebel newts ambushed them, they are then reunited with Tritonio who leads the rebels, but is not interested in joining the rebellion. Anne convinces him to team up with her and Sprig for a mission, but when his team is captured, he bails on them, due to his harsh upbringing. Words of encouragement leads him to change his mind and he rescues his thieves and joins the rebellion.[66]\n\nWhile on night patrol, she reunites with Domino 2 who has had \"kittens\". When Domino II is captured by drones to help power a battery, Anne and Sprig go and rescue her while the rest of Wartwood reluctantly look after the kittens, though they end up falling in love with them anyway. Anne discovers that Domino 2 remembers her, but when the other Kill-a-moths try to eat Sprig, Anne learns that Domino 2 is the Alpha Moth and she alerts the other moths to leave them alone. Anne and Sprig liberate the moths and they all fly back to Wartwood where Sasha dubs them their new flying artillery.[67]\n\nPreparing for the Final Battle\n\nAnne is excited that their plan is coming together to defeat Andrias, until she mentions that the frogs, toads and newts are all working together. It is revealed that all three species have never liked one another and that having them all agree to fight together in one day would be difficult. However, Anne is nonplussed at the idea as she believes that her incredible ability to act as a mediator will win out, though Sasha has her own doubts. The toads and newts arrive lead by Tritonio and Beatrix, respectively, and are quick to mock each other and the frogs, particularly Hop Pop. Anne suggests that they all simply come inside the bunker and talk and they reluctantly agree. Anne tries to get them to hear each other's ideas, but Beatrix's comes off as belligerent, Tritonio's is nonsensical and neither refuses to listen to Hop Pop. Anne next suggests having all three nations do a series of team building exercises, but they all devolve into internal arguments until eventually everyone starts fighting with one another. All three nations round each other up and proceed to start a war of their own; causing Anne to use her blue gem ability to stop the fight. She chastises everyone for not listening to one another and not taking the war seriously and leaves everyone feeling guilty. Anne humorously cries over her failure, but Sasha comforts her. Hop Pop, Tritonio and Beatrix suddenly come in with a plan wherein Beatrix's forces distract Andrias' front guard while everyone else captures the music box. Anne and Sasha love the idea, as it reminds them of a movie Marcy showed them, and congratulate the three for finally working together. Just then, Mother Olm arrives and informs everyone that King Andrias is starting his invasion that night instead of later. With a new devotion towards trying to save the world, the frogs, newts and toads finally get ready and collect their equipment to finally bring Andrias' forces to an end.[68]\n\nMeeting the Core\n\nThe rebellion has gathered and are preparing to go to war. However, Sasha decides to speak to Anne privately about their relationship with Marcy. While Sasha is still upset with her over how she tricked them and nearly ruined their lives, Anne is still forgiving of her and even comes to believe that neither of them have treated her well in the past, nor showed any real interest in her hobbies. King Andrias is surprised by the arrival of the rebellion and sends his robots to go and fight them. True to the plan, the frogs, toads and newts all take out the robot army. During which, Apothecary Gary, the olms and the Moss Man, whose mere existence causes everyone to believe One-Eyed Wally finally, allows them to take advantage of the fight. Andrias hops down to fight the rebellion himself. Anne, Sasha, the Plantars and Grime enter the castle where Anne finally tells Sasha that while she is upset with Marcy, she has learned to forgive her, much like how she forgave her and Hop Pop. They come across a mind controlled Yunan and Olivia, but they manage to destroy their collars. Before Olivia and General Yunan can fully warn them, the group fall into Darcy's trap as they uses tentacles to capture the group. They announce their victory causing the rebellion to retreat. However, Anne realizes that Darcy and Andrias are just as clueless about the music box as they are and just as they are about to kill her, Anne suggests that doing so might destroy what is left of the box's power. Darcy realizes that this might be true and decides to keep her alive for now. With the box fully powered up, they open a portal back to Los Angeles. Everyone in the city looks up in horror as Andrias' castle and his robot army darken the sky and city.[69]\n\nThe Invasion\n\nAnne, the Plantars, Sasha, Grime, Olivia, Yunan and Frobo have all been captured by Andrias' army. Andrias starts his invasion by sending drones and two mind controlled herons on the populace. The army, powerless against them, summons Mr. X who has prepared for the occasion. Sprig tells Anne not to use her blue gem powers as it will tire her out. Polly uses the upgrades she added to Frobo who lasers a hole beneath their prison and they fall towards Los Angeles. Luckily, they land in a high rise swimming pool. As they look out on the city, Hop Pop recognizes the two herons as the same ones that killed Sprig and Polly's parents; traumatizing him.[23]\n\nThe heroes head into the city, only to be outnumbered by the drones. They are suddenly rescued by Anne's parents who are now highly trained agents and have teamed up with an enlightened Mr. X. They escape to Anne and Sasha's school where Polly uses the opportunity to make numerous upgrades to Frobo, turning him into a battle robot again. Anne goes looking through her locker where she sees her old \"Who Am I?\" paper that she never finished. She reminds Sasha that Darcy only knows the old them and that they will free Marcy.[23]\n\nSasha, Grime, Yunan and Olivia break into the flying castle, while Anne and the rest battle the drones on the ground; getting some help from their L.A. friends. The arrival of the two herons causes the Plantars to freeze in fear. With supportive words from Anne, and after seeing the Boonchuys in danger, the Plantars overcome their fear to break the herons mind control necklaces while using their wild dance to tame them, turning them against Andrias' forces. Andrias dons the Dyplasaurus, his robot armor, and calls out Anne with the intent to face her one on one for the fate of Earth. Anne reaches into her pocket and finds the essay page from earlier and has a bit of a moment of self-reflection, sharing her appreciation and love for the Plantars, explaining what she has to do. As she struggles against king of Amphibia and his powerful mech-suit Mr. X kicks on a massive sound system and plays some music to inspire her.[23]\n\nAs Anne has the upper hand, her powers start to fade and Sprig is ready to help. As he checks his pocket for boom shrooms, he drops a letter he found at his family farm and Mr. X picks it up. Since he is wearing spy glasses, he can see that is encoded with a message and it's a letter to Andrias. Sprig takes the glasses and reads it, and jumps aboard one of the (now-trained) herons and flies up to Anne and Andrias to read it to him. The letter, from Leif, stops Andrias dead in his tracks. As the voiceover of the letter plays, we see the evolution of Wartwood, and a glimpse of Marcy, the only other person he let into his life and considered a friend. The letter reveals that even though Leif took the music box, she never actually stopped thinking of Andrias and Barrel, and hoped that one day he would learn of her love for him as one of her greatest friends. After 1000 years of suppressing his thoughts and thinking he was the only one that thought that way. However, after all he's done and all the pain he has caused, there's no going back. Darcy realizes that he is giving up though, and tries to use their power to control Andrias and takes over, but a motivated Sasha cuts the cable that links Darcy's helmet; freeing Marcy from the Core's control. Anne powers up one more time and blasts through Andrias' armor as he repentantly allows the blow to hit; revealing that he had made himself into a cyborg to prolong his life for the last 1,000 years. As the castle shield turns off, he begs Anne to save Marcy.[23]\n\nAs she and Sasha cry over Marcy's unconscious body, she awakens and the three are united once again. After everything that happen to them Anne tells her two human friends that no matter what happens their friendship will stay true. The entire gang comes together for a group hug and Darcy's helmet comes to life and scurries away while no one is looking. Anne and the rest of the heroes take the castle back to Amphibia to announce their victory to the rest the Resistance. As everyone is celebrating Sprig notices the moon is getting closer.[23]\n\nThe End of An Awesome Journey\n\nFollowing their return to Amphibia, the Core, still trapped within the helmet, flies up into space and attaches itself to a pod located up on the moon. It then proceeds to activate it and turns on hidden thrusters; causing it to fly towards Amphibia. As everyone looks up, Andrias reveals that the Core made a base up on the moon as a final gambit to destroy all life as it is afraid of being irrelevant. Mother Olm arrives to inform everyone about the prophecy; revealing that it is not a prediction, but rather a request that the three girls, Anne, Sasha and Marcy, help save Amphibia from destruction. However, this would result in the total depletion of the gem energy and possibly trap them in Amphibia forever. The girls nevertheless agree for one final adventure.[24]\n\nBefore leaving, Mother Olm tells Anne that there may still not be enough energy to defeat the Core and that she would need to use a \"secret spell\" in order to defeat it. This spell can only be wielded by one and could result in their death. She tells her that she \"have only but to ask\" when it comes time to use it. Anne runs into the castle and is surprised by the appearance of Valeriana who has all three gems in the music box. Using her abilities, the gem powers are charged into the girls who are now all empowered enough to fly and exert energy. They all fly into space where they proceed to destroy numerous robots and monsters sent out by the Core and try to push back the moon.[24]\n\nAndrias sends his drones up into space as a shocked Grime watches. However, to his surprise, Andrias orders the drones to help push the moon back. He takes his crown and tells the Core that he is finally doing the right thing by standing up to him and destroys his crown. Despite this, the Core is still too powerful and Sasha and Marcy's powers begin to wane due to inexperience. With no other options, Anne convinces them to let her absorb all their powers and she solemnly sends them back to Amphibia. Now all-powerful, Anne uses all her energy to blast at the moon before flying through it; destroying it and the Core. A pale, singed Anne returns as everyone cries and becomes devastated over her and she deteriorates into a pile of leaves.[24]\n\nAnne awakens in a limbo-like dimension resembling a poster depicting a tiny house and garden floating in space in her room on Earth. As she enters the house, she speaks to the Guardian of the Stones via an old fashioned computer. When Anne mocks its dated appearance, it transforms into Domino and proceeds to converse mentally with her. The Guardian reveals that she is a \"backup\" and that she is not dead or alive. It goes on to reveal that it has watched over the universe for a \"very long time\" and wants Anne to be its replacement as she is the only person who has used the stones for selfless purposes. Anne immediately turns it down after admitting that she is not perfect and that she would need years to become wiser. Intrigued by this notion, the Guardian decides to return her to life and will wait \"Another 78 years\" for her to accept, much to Anne's confusion.[24]\n\nAnne awakens back in Amphibia and reunites with her friends who are overjoyed to see her alive. She also discovers that the Guardian left her with three tiny gem shards, which are only enough for the trip back home. The next day, Anne finally says goodbye to the Plantars, especially Sprig, with whom she leaves her cellphone to help with future adventures. As Valeriana opens the portal back to Earth, Anne has one final hug with Sprig before she follows Sasha and Marcy through the portal, leaving Amphibia forever.[24]\n\nEpilogue\n\nMarcy eventually did move out of California alongside her parents, though she visits whenever possible. Similarly, Anne and Sasha ended up in different friend groups when they entered high school, but their bond is still strong. Ten years later, Anne has become a herpetologist and works at the Aquarium of the Pacific where she is in charge of a frog exhibit named Amphibia. She has also named one specific pink male frog after Sprig. She still keeps in touch with her human friends from time to time who are living their own lives but are still the best of friends. Sasha, Marcy and Anne start celebrating Anne's twenty-third birthday. The three take a new version of their iconic photo, with \"BFFs\" again being written on it.[24] During their meeting, Terri calls Anne to tell her about \"exciting news\" for her, Marcy, and Sasha, setting up a reunion at the lab with the three for the next day.[70]\n\nRelationships\n\nMrs. Boonchuy\n\nMrs. Boonchuy is Anne's mother. During her conversation with Sprig in \"Hopping Mall\", Anne described her mother as kind, though strict unlike her husband, with her getting annoyed sometimes because of Anne's behavior, and Anne getting annoyed by her bad singing. Despite this, Anne loves her mother dearly, as reuniting with her was one of her biggest hopes while in Amphibia. In the same episode, she tried to win a fancy teapot for her as a souvenir, though she gave it up in exchange for the butterfly made by Priscilla's daughter Pearl.\n\nIn \"The New Normal,\" Anne finally reunited with her, who immediately gave her an emotional hug. Though Anne later got annoyed by her and her father's overprotectiveness after she told them what had happened to her.\n\nIn \"Anne-sterminator,\" Anne realizes that her mother had rather high expectations for her when she sees her workout room, while her mother becomes upset and angry that Anne didn't tell her about Cloak-Bot trying to kill her, even accusing Anne of having not changed at all based on the lack of context from the Plantar Family, to which Anne apologizes for saying she was trying to protect the Plantars, and also reveal how much pressure she feels from trying to live up to her expectations, though she does admit she finally appreciates everything she and her father have done for her. During the fight with Cloak-Bot, her mother finally comes to understand why her daughter was so secretive before, and they return home on good terms.\n\nIn \"Froggy Little Christmas,\" Anne decides to gift her mother with the \"Thai Go\" parade float she had always dreamed about after she turned down the offer initially, to which after presenting the gift, her mother hugs her in deep appreciation. Later that night, Anne gifted her with the butterfly she received in Amphibia.\n\nMr. Boonchuy\n\nMr. Boonchuy is Anne's father. Their relationship is close and not complicated like the one between his wife and daughter, he occasionally teases her. He originally thought Anne was immature, problematic, and around bad influences much like her mother. But, ever since Anne returned from Amphibia, he has seen that Anne changed and was quick to accept her new way of living and her new friends.\n\nSprig Plantar\n\n“\n\nSpranne against the world!\n\n”\n\n—Anne and Sprig exclaimed their friendship motto.\n\nIn the promotional description, Sprig was depicted not only as Anne's best friend but her first actual friend and sidekick who accompanies her in all the crazy adventures that Anne goes through.\n\nSprig is the complete opposite of Anne's friend - Sasha - because he was the reflection of how Anne views what friendship really is. He was always there for her every time, even in times of hardship. They once had an argument about being roommates with each other when Anne's temporary bedroom flooded, and she had to move upstairs to Sprig's room. Even after the fight, their relationship only grew stronger.[28]\n\nAnne will do anything to help Sprig and they trust each other with everything.\n\nIn \"Hopping Mall\", their relationship grows stronger yet when they open up about each other's mothers. Anne misses hers and went to many lengths to acquire the perfect gift for her and Sprig's mother passed away while he and Polly were much younger and he doesn't have any memory of her. While wondering if it was possible to miss someone without actually knowing them, Anne hugs him tightly and they weep in each others' arms.\n\nThough she was fresh off both Sasha's coup and learning that Marcy intentionally got her stranded in Amphibia and begging King Andrias to spare him at the time, Anne once described Sprig as her \"best friend, in this world or any other world.\" When Andrias responded to this by dropping him out of a window despite the demands for sparing him being met, the grief and rage drove her into a berserk state that unlocked her Calamity Box powers and caused her to attempt to beat the tyrant to death, demanding he \"give him back\", only stopping short because she couldn't maintain her new form for long enough. Upon recovering, she was overjoyed to discover that Marcy had taken advantage of the chaos to save Sprig.\n\nIn \"Thai Feud\", while adjusting to life on Earth and living as guests in the Boonchuy household, Sprig's many attempts to facilitate a mother-son-like connection between him and Mrs. Boonchuy are met with frustration from Anne, who repeatedly tells him to stop trying. Sprig eventually succeeds after all and Anne officially welcomes him as a surrogate Boonchuy, later being pleased with how much closer Spring and her mom have gotten, noting in Marcy's Journal that, with Sprig losing his mother to the herons years ago, she understands why he tried so hard.\n\nIn \"Sprig's Birthday\", Anne is shocked that she never knew when Sprig's birthday was and devalues herself as his friend as a result, vowing to \"make it up\" to him with the best birthday ever. Although Anne was insistent on the activities they did, Sprig was never forced into doing anything uncomfortable, unlike with Sasha on Anne's birthday, and enjoys every moment. When he declares that this birthday makes top 3, Anne gets more agitated and sneaks them onto a hot air balloon ride despite heavy winds. When they survive the balloon crashing, Anne laments her alleged \"failure\" as a friend and Sprig responds with the first \"friend punch\" since \"Best Fronds\" and assures her that she's his friend because he likes being with her, not the crazy stuff they did, and their time together is what made this birthday Top 3. This is enough to make Anne cry tears of joy over \"the sweetest thing anyone's ever said\". Sprig then clarifies that his other 2 top birthdays are the one he was actually born on and the day he was given his iconic hat. Anne then give him a telescope with his name engraved on it.\n\nIn \"Fight or Flight\", Spring tries to persuade Anne not to fall for Domino 2's cat-like charms and that their \"special connection\" was not worth the risk of getting eaten by kill-a-moths. Anne convinces him to let her try and they liberate Domino 2 and her flock of kill-a-moths. When Sprig gets eaten by one of them, Anne's worry for him is clear enough to make Domino 2 respect it and command the others to let him go and return him to Anne safely.\n\nIn \"All In\", Sprig contemplates that things will go completely \"back to normal\" after the war and it will just be usual hanging out and \"monster of the week\" stuff between him and Anne, but Hop Pop asks him if he thinks Anne should get back to her old life. Sprig doesn't think things will change at all, certain that Anne will always be a big part of his life. When Anne, Sasha, and Marcy all make amends, Anne's speech about change starts to sow uncertainty in Sprig, who is visibly unsure of himself now. After they return to Amphibia with Andrias and the castle, Sprig asks Anne if things between them will change the same way it has with her two human friends. Anne is uncertain but promises they will face it together if they do.\n\nIn \"The Hardest Thing\", Sprig begs Anne not to sacrifice herself to stop the Core, having been in turmoil over the prospect of them separating ever since the invasion. They share a sweet goodbye before she dies and they are overjoyed when Anne returns to life. When the times comes for Anne to leave Amphibia for good, Anne and Sprig share the most tearful and heartfelt of all the goodbyes between the humans and Amphibians, crying in each others arms. They say they will never forget each other and Anne assures Spring this means that they will never really be apart and nothing will ever change how much he really means to her, not time or space or being worlds apart. They also say their \"Spranne against the world\" catchphrase together one last time. Anne also gives Sprig her phone as a keepsake to help on his future adventures. Right before Anne leaves through the portal, Sprig runs up to her and they share one last long hug together before they part. 9 months later, Sprig seems to have come to terms with Anne's departure and uses her phone to help write his journal of his encounters with Amphibia's creatures and joins the Wartwood unveiling ceremony of the statue of Anne built in her honor. Meanwhile, Anne has not only designed her amphibian exhibits at the Aquarium to memorialize her time in Amphibia, she named a pink South American tree frog there after Sprig.\n\nPolly Plantar\n\nPolly was originally suspicious of Anne after the decision to let her stay in their home for the time she was in Amphibia. She even held onto a rolling pin for some time as both for defense and threatening Anne to not step out of line. Eventually, she started to warm up to her over the next few weeks of getting to know her, even if she wasn't very accustomed to Anne's lifestyle from where she lived. Polly had begun to take a disliking to Anne after she was dragged around with her to do girly things that didn't fit any of her interests, but eventually, Anne began to realize it wasn't right to force Polly into surroundings she wasn't comfortable with and apologized, with Polly knowing that Anne just wanted them to have a good time.[71] The two have have since formed a sisterly bond, going on on many misadventures together. Polly enjoys shows and movies from Anne's world and really likes her cooking. When the time comes for Anne to return to Earth, she tells Polly she was the little sister she never knew she needed and Polly tearfully acknowledges Anne as her moral compass.\n\nHop Pop Plantar\n\nHop Pop was the most paranoid of the family during Anne's new presence in the town of Wartwood,[16] but he was willing to let her stay with the family until she finds a way home.[7] He has been known to teach Anne certain lessons about life along the way like when he taught Anne that there was more to driving than simply experience.[72] Anne has also assisted Hop Pop during her stay like when she tried to show him proper dancing moves in order to impress Sylvia Sundew.[46] Hop Pop's paranoia, however, is also what kept him from telling information he found out about Anne's \"mysterious music box.\" After the Bizarre Bazaar, Anne trusted Hop Pop with the box, believing he could find more information about it in due time. But instead, he decided to bury the box beside the Plantar Farm, as he believed it to be too dangerous for the village.[59]\n\nTheir relationship hit a major snag when Anne learned that Hop Pop lied to her about the Calamity Box. She felt so betrayed that she ran away. However, she temporarily put her anger aside to work together with Hop Pop to save Sprig and Polly. After hearing what happened with Sprig and Polly's parents and seeing that he was truly sorry for lying to her, she forgave Hop Pop and they grew closer than ever before from the experience.[56] Although she isn't angry at him anymore, Anne is having a hard time letting go of Hop Pop's actions and even wonders if she is really part of the family after all, while Hop Pop is trying desperately to make it up to her for them. However, Anne tells Hop Pop that she wants to fully reconcile with him but tells him to give her time because she doesn't know what he needs to do in order to fix the strain in their relationship, which he understands. Also, Anne was given an apology from Hop Pop for pressuring her as she accepts his apology and they admit that some of their issues need fixing first before their relationship can be set right.[57]\n\nAs time passed, Anne and Hop Pop gradually got over their problems and reforged their familial bond, and the experience eventually contributed to Anne forgiving Sasha and Marcy for their later mistakes. Based on what Anne tells Sasha about forgiveness with regards to Marcy in \"The Beginning of the End\" and glancing fondly at Hop Pop while in the flying castle, Anne is evidenced to have, at some point prior, finally reached the point of full reconciliation with him.\n\nIn \"The Hardest Thing\", when saying goodbye, Anne says she's lucky to call herself a Plantar and Hop Pop says he is also lucky and blessed to have a granddaughter like Anne. He also says if she ever needs a home cooked meal or her old room back, she can just stop by. Anne also recalls when Hop Pop told her that \"family always finds each other\" confirming that Anne finally regained her assurance that she was part of the Plantar family.\n\nSasha Waybright\n\nSasha is one of two friends Anne had when she was in their world. Anne and Sasha have been friends since they were little when Sasha defended her and Marcy from bullies when they were little kids.\n\nIn the episode \"Reunion\", in the flashback, Anne and Sasha were very close friends as it was shown when Sasha was trying to brighten Anne's day by hanging out with each other as a celebration for her birthday. Up until later when Sasha showed her toxic attributes when she forced Anne to do her bidding, despite Anne being clearly uncomfortable by the thought of stealing from a thrift store.\n\nLater in the episode, Anne realizes how controlling Sasha was of her life when she was fighting with her the \"Toad Way\" when she defended Sprig from Sasha's sword, things heated up leading to the conclusion that Anne thought that Sprig's friendship with her was healthier than that of her relationship with Sasha.\n\nAlthough Sasha can be very controlling of Anne, she on the other hand also cares for her stating that Anne should be better off without her after realizing how awful she is towards her when she let go of Anne's hand when the latter tried to help Sasha from the collapsing tower.\n\nAnne initially is distrusting of Sasha in \"The Third Temple\" when she claims to want to apologize to her because of her previous actions though she eventually comes around and forgives her by the episode's end after going through the final challenge of the temple. They initially have trouble getting along again \"The Dinner\" when Sasha ends up in conflict with the Plantars and in \"Battle of the Bands\" where she tries to take control of the band and initially tries to go her own way for the band competition but in both instances, they were able to get past their conflict and even performed together with Marcy in the latter singing \"No Big Deal\".\n\nIn \"True Colors,\" when Anne finds out Sasha was only using her and Marcy to get to Newtopia and start the Toad Rebellion, their rekindled friendship shatters with Anne lividly calling her a horrible person and ending their friendship to the point where she stubbornly (yet understandably) refuses to believe her when she warns her about King Andrias' true intentions. Anne was so livid that she tried to fight Sasha to the death during their swordfight.[73] By this point, only Sasha's sword skill and her holding back as she tried futilely to persuade Anne not to trust Andrias kept her alive. As the sword fight progresses, Anne vents just enough to stop fighting to kill Sasha, and eventually incapacitates her and brings her back to the Newtopia throne room as a prisoner. Anne puts aside her feelings about Sasha's betrayal when she regretfully realizes that the latter was right about King Andrias and they fight alongside each other against his robot army.\n\nAnne and Sasha reunite once again in \"Commander Anne,\" Anne, joyous that Sasha is alive, immediately hugs her, in a quick but tight and reassuring way, to Sasha's surprise. After the mission is completed, Anne tells Sasha that she has truly changed from before, and the two finally reconcile as co-leaders of the Resistance, with Anne once again pulling Sasha into a tight and enthusiastic hug, which Sasha reciprocates this time.\n\nIn \"Sasha's Angels,\" Anne and Sasha come to a disagreement over Sasha sending resistance soldiers on a mission without backing them up, with Sasha trusting them to be fully capable of doing it while Anne worries they will be captured and insists on getting involved to protect them. Anne and Sasha reconcile and Sasha tells Anne she and the resistance have been through a lot while Anne was on Earth and that Anne taught her to make tough calls and trust in others around her.\n\nIn \"Olm Town Road,\" Anne is visibly impressed with Sasha's clear progress in growth as a person when she advocates second chances for people like Lysil and Angwin and even more so when Sasha stands up to Parisia's baseless denial of the dangers from the war affecting Proteus. When Parisia is finally convinced to let them see Mother Olm, Anne and Sasha celebrate with a friendly fist bump.\n\nIn \"The Three Armies,\" Sasha trusts Anne to bridge the mental and emotional gaps between the Frogs, Toads, and Newts who were at first unwilling to get along for the sake of the Resistance.\n\nIn \"The Beginning of the End,\" Anne and Sasha discussed over what will happen after they save Marcy since she got them stranded in Amphibia in the first place, with Sasha having mixed feelings and surprised by Anne's suggestion that they may be partially to blame as well. Anne says they may have ignored Marcy's needs on top of her interests and they should try to fix things between them. While sneaking in the castle, Anne tells Sasha that forgiveness is hard and time-consuming, but worth it, gently telling her to look at what they have now, clearly indicating that they are true friends at last. Brought to tears over this reminder, it helps Sasha regain her confidence in wanting to make things right with Marcy.\n\nIn \"All In,\" Sasha expresses worry about how well Darcy seems to know them, but Anne tells her that they only know the old them and doesn't realize how far Anne and Sasha have come as better people, telling her that it's who they are now that counts, not who they were. When Marcy is saved, Anne assures Marcy that the bond the three of them share is unbreakable and that their memories of their time together will never go away, making it implicitly clear that Sasha is a true friend to them both.\n\nIn \"The Hardest Thing,\" when Anne announces her decision to sacrifice herself to stop the Core's final plan, Sasha, along with Marcy, refuses point blank to let her go at first, but they both relent after some persuasion, with Sasha demanding in no uncertain terms that Anne had better come back alive. Anne does manage to return to the surface alive, but only just and soon dies and fades to ashes, with Sasha openly grieving the death of one of her best friends. When Anne is resurrected, Sasha is overjoyed along with everyone else present.\n\n10 years later, it is revealed that Anne and Sasha hung out quite a bit for the rest of their time in middle school, but come high school, they gravitated toward different friend groups, talking to each other only every once in a while. Despite this development, they are still great friends and as close as ever hanging out whenever possible.\n\nMarcy Wu\n\nMarcy is also one of the two friends Anne had in her world, having met when they were 3 years old at the Los Angeles beach. At first, Anne was in the waves and invited Marcy to join her, but Marcy was occupied with building a sand castle inspired by her favorite video game. Marcy's passion for it drew Anne in and they tried to keep the waves away, but the tide came in and washed the castle away. Even so, Marcy and Anne became fast friends from that day forward and Anne became quite protective of her.\n\nAnne is usually responsible for making sure Marcy doesn't get herself injured, due to her clumsiness. It isn't until Anne sees Marcy fend for herself, that she realizes that Marcy has truly changed since they arrived in Amphibia and she's more than capable of taking care of herself now, although Marcy still needs some help with clumsy situations on occasion. After Marcy learns that Anne and Sasha had a fight, she and Anne both agree that it's time they made their own decisions and promise to find Sasha, as well as a way home, together. The two are shown to share a close friendship with Marcy generally admiring Anne's ability to socialize and Anne admiring Marcy's brains and are supportive of one another.\n\nTheir friendship becomes strained in \"True Colors\" when Anne finds out Marcy intentionally planned on getting the two of them and Sasha, trapped in Amphibia because her parents were planning to move. Marcy does come to realize her mistake in siding with King Andrias though and helps Anne and the Plantars by saving Sprig from falling to his death and also helping them escape back to Earth. When King Andrias proceeds to stab her, she uses her last breaths to apologize to Anne before collapsing, all the while Anne is devastated and horrified at Marcy's possible death. When Anne is transported back to Earth, she refuses to believe that Marcy is dead, and makes it her number one priority to make it back to Amphibia and make amends with her and Sasha, still calling her her best friend alongside Sasha.\n\nAnne's worries over whether Marcy was still alive or not affected her sleeping for many nights while she was on Earth and she began mulling over the possibility that she and Sasha may have had a hand in Marcy's actions in the first place by inadvertently giving Marcy the impression that they would not have listened if she told them about her coming move. The news that Marcy is still alive in \"Commander Anne\" comes as a tremendous relief for Anne.\n\nIn \"The Beginning of the End,\" Anne comes to realize that she and Sasha had been taking Marcy for granted by not investing themselves in her interests and likely her needs. This causes Anne to feel that both she and Sasha are also to blame for Marcy tricking them into getting sent into Amphibia. Anne is willing to make things right with her and has confidence they can work out their problems, eventually getting Sasha to agree as well. She is, however, horrified to see her become possessed by the Core.\n\nIn \"All In\", Anne properly reunites with Marcy (who Sasha freed from the core) after she defeats King Andrias, and they finally make amends for everything.\n\n10 years later, even though Marcy has moved out of town, she still visits whenever she can and their friendship is still unbreakable.\n\nWally Ribbiton\n\nWally was the first Amphibian to see Anne; he mistook her for a monster and rallied the citizens of Wartwood to go after her. After the misunderstanding was cleared up, he still had a hard time accepting her until in \"Toad Tax\" when she showed in a small act of kindness, he finally saw her as a person. Since then, he has been much nicer and more respectful towards the human girl. She found him annoying and unpleasant to be around. However, in \"Wally and Anne\", Anne began to see that he was a person deep inside with feelings and soon begin to find his happy-go-lucky attitude inspiring as it meant not caring about what others think and by the end of the episode they became good friends.\n\nIn \"Swamp and Sensibility\", Anne learned that Wally actually comes from a wealthy family and saw how his double life was making him miserable. She tried to help him by making his father see who he really is and accepting him, which initially results in Wally's near-estrangement from his family, to his anger. When she asks how to make it up to him, he is not ready to forgive her and tells her she did quite enough. After helping Wally win his challenge against his father, Wally is really grateful to her after all and forgives her.\n\nIn \"The Shut-In!\", Anne is shown to have an alarm set on her phone to remind her of Wally's birthday.\n\nStumpy\n\nKnowing how hard it is to run a restaurant from her parents, she went through great lengths to help his restaurant get a good review. This actually gave Stumpy something he never had before: hope. After she turned his restaurant into a success, Stumpy thanks Anne for helping him with his diner and for inspiring him to truly care about his business by telling her that her parents would be proud.\n\nSadie Croaker\n\nLike the rest of the Wartwood citizens, it took a while for her to get used to Anne. After the human girl showed her kindness in \"Toad Tax\", Mrs. Croaker started being friendlier towards her. Anne likes her feistiness and craftiness sa"
