We didn't like the idea of giving up our brew in a long term disaster.\n\nThese beans will ship fast in a 5lb Ziploc bag. Bunker Beans are raw green coffee beans that need to be roasted, in an open well ventilated area, and buzzed up just like any fresh roasted coffee bean! When you receive your shipment of Bunker Beans store them in Mylar bags with oxygen absorbers, like any other long term food storage ingredient, and these raw green coffee beans will last for 20 years!\n\nWARNING: THESE ARE RAW GREEN COFFEE BEANS THAT NEED TO BE ROASTED BEFORE BREWING. THEY SHOULD BE ROASTED OUTSIDE AS THE FUMES ARE AN IRRITANT.\n\nUpon arrival you will be able to store them in the Ziploc for later use or you can pack them for the long term. Be ready to caffeinate under the most extreme conditions with Bunker Beans!"
