        "text": "Harlan Ratmeyer\n\nHarlan Ratmeyer - husband, father, grandfather, minister, activist, and storyteller – passed away peacefully on the morning of July 19, surrounded by the love and support of family.\n\nBorn September 5, 1938, in the small farming community of Forreston, Illinois. Harlan graduated with a B.A. from Central College in Pella, Iowa in 1960. Four years later he received his Master of Divinity degree from Western Theological Seminary in Holland, Michigan. He was ordained to ministry in the Reformed Church in America in July 1964.\n\nHarlan's first ten years of pastoral service were in parish ministry in inner-city congregations – in Muskegon Heights, Michigan, and the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. He also spent six months in an intensive program at the Urban Training Center for Ministry in Chicago during the summer that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was in Chicago.\n\nHarlan then spent three years as a Chaplain Intern in Clinical Pastoral Education (1973-75) at Prairie View Mental Health Center in Newton, Kansas and Assistant Chaplain Supervisor at Wesley Medical Center in Wichita, Kansas (1975-76) before moving to California's Central Valley where he developed a Clinical Pastoral Education program at Kings View Mental Health Center in Reedley, California. He remained there for fifteen years, training men and women in pastoral ministry, and holding various leadership positions within the national and regional Association for Clinical Pastoral Education (ACPE) including serving on its Board of Directors.\n\nIn April of 1995, Harlan accepted a position at Albany Medical Center to direct the hospital's Pastoral Care Department. He developed the department to include more ministry students in direct patient care and expanded the role of pastoral care to include greater involvement in staff and policy issues.\n\nHarlan was a tireless advocate for universal healthcare, and penned the Health Care Manifesto, calling for such coverage and challenging the current model of fiscal considerations as the primary driver for healthcare decision-making, and he rallied the local faith community around this document.\n\nHarlan taught at Albany Medical College in areas of spirituality, ethical considerations, and professional integration. In 2000 he received his Doctor of Ministry degree from New York Theological Seminary.\n\nIn 2011, he was awarded Honorary Membership of the Alumni Association for work establishing the Clinical Pastoral Care program at AMC and the impact the program has had on the AMC Community. He educated countless students, residents and staff, helping them to explore spirituality, and the mind-body-spirit connection for themselves, particularly as they are for their patients. He served on several hospital committees, including the Internal Review Board and Ethics Consultation Committee, interacting with a variety of agencies and organizations, including Interfaith Impact.\n\nIn 2011, Harlan received the Association of Clinical Pastoral Education Distinguished Service Award. This presentation is made each year to one of more than 400 supervisors in Clinical Pastoral Education who are recognized by their colleagues for their faithful and distinguished service.\n\nIn 2015, Harlan received one of Albany Medical Center's highest honors – the Pillars Award. The award is given annually to individuals who epitomize the spirit of the Medical Center and whose sustaining work and contributions reflect the essential community-based nature of its mission. \"Importantly, his patients have observed that he has been their light in their darkest hour; a warm, caring, radiant presence that guides them through to health or, in some cases, helps them come to terms with the end of life,\" said James J. Barba, president and chief executive officer of Albany Medical Center (now retired).\n\nIn 2018, Harlan retired as the part-time pastor for the First Reformed Church of Bethlehem in Selkirk, New York, a small congregation he served for more than twenty years (concurrently with his service at Albany Medical Center). In 2019, he retired as Manager of Pastoral Care at Albany Medical Center.\n\nIn his retirement, as throughout his working life, he pursued several passions –gardening (tomatoes, garlic), cooking (pies, rib roasts), storytelling (childhood, pastoring), and driving (Mini) – and reveled in his time with family and friends. His storytelling was deeply valued by his friends, family, and community, and some of his stories have been captured in recordings, and in his December 2022 book, For Everything a Season.\n\nDiagnosed with Parkinson's in 2017, Harlan resisted its ravages with the profound courage, grace, and humor that wove through everything he did – including taking up boxing and enduring long walks in any weather.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Ellen, his daughters Stephanie Ratmeyer and Julia Ratmeyer, his grandchildren Sarah and Christopher Richardson, Madeleine and Emma Folkerts, and his son-in-law Paul Richardson.\n\nA service honoring Harlan's life will be held on Saturday, August 24, 2024, at 11:00 a.m., at Delmar Reformed Church, 386 Delaware Ave., Delmar, N.Y. 12054. Lunch will be provided in the Fellowship Hall following the service.\n\nIn lieu of gifts or flowers, please make donations to the Pastoral Care Department, Albany Medical Center.\n\nTo plant trees in memory, please visit the Sympathy Store.\n\nMake an ACPE Foundation Gift in Harlan Ratmeyer's Memory\n\nACPE Educator Rev. Dr. Gerald \"Gerry\" Wyrwas\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Gerald \"Gerry\" Wyrwas, a Presbyterian minister who was the long-time director of pastoral care at Bon Secours Hospital (now called the Holy Family Hospital) in Methuen, Mass., died May 2, 2024, from complications of Alzheimer’s disease. He was 89.\n\nThose who knew him well describe Wyrwas as a family man of deep faith who embraced the many facets of his career in addition to being director of pastoral care, minister and licensed psychologist.\n\nIn the 25 years he was the director of Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) at Holy Family, almost 600 participants, called “interns,” from 43 countries participated in the hospital’s program. CPE is a multicultural, interfaith approach to teaching doctors, lawyers, hospital administrators, and educators how to more effectively deliver spiritual care to seriously ill patients and their caregivers.\n\n“To say that Gerry Wyrwas is a visionary is an understatement,” a hospital colleague said when he retired from full-time work in 1999. “His work inspired CPE interns to join the ministry or to further theological education, as well as refreshing and revitalizing the work of missionaries throughout the world.”\n\nOther colleagues said his integration of theology and psychology was a “unique gift” that gave him an in-depth understanding of people. “He invites people forth, into being the best they can be, and does so with a delightful sense of humor. He is a deeply compassionate and warm person.”\n\nFamily members and graduates of his CPE program often recall favorite aphorisms he relied on to perk up interns. One was: “Whenever we fail to acknowledge our God-given talents, we lie, cheat, and steal.” Another: “How are you feeling? Are you mad, sad, glad, or fearful?”\n\nGerald Grant Wyrwas was born September 28, 1934, in the small, remote coal-mining village of Inverness, Nova Scotia. He was the youngest of six children of Edward Theodore Wyrwas, an electrician, and Mary Agnes (MacKenzie) Wyrwas, a Sunday school teacher.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, he briefly worked for his father, then took a job at the Royal Bank of Canada. After being promoted to assistant accountant and assigned to the Halifax branch in 1955, he met his future wife, Ethel M. Bowman, on a blind date. They married in May 1957.\n\nAround that time, he decided to leave banking and join the ministry. “I liked banking and . . . had more than doubled my salary while I was with it,” he wrote years later, “but I was not satisfied. I felt there was more to life than handling other people’s money.”\n\nHe enrolled at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and philosophy, with a minor in Greek. He then earned a Bachelor of Divinity at Pine Hill Divinity College in Halifax.\n\nHe was a student missionary in Alberta and assisted the ministers at the Brunswick Street United Church, Truro, and Guysborough-Canso Pastoral Church. While at Pine Hill, he served as Old Barns Pastoral Charge and Maitland Pastoral Charge. After ordination, he served as Winsloe Pastoral Charge, P.E.I., and then assistant minister of Trinity United Church in Charlottetown, P.E.I.\n\nHe was ordained a minister of the United Church of Canada in June 1960 and began his ecclesiastical career as the pastor of four rural churches in the village of Winsloe, Prince Edward Island.\n\nIn 1967, Wyrwas moved with his family to Massachusetts and was called into pastoral ministry in the Presbytery of Boston to serve as pastor with the First Presbyterian Church of Lynn. He also was named director of the Department of Spiritual Care (Pastoral) Services at Holy Family Hospital and maintained a pastoral counseling center in Lynnfield, Mass.\n\nIn 1980, Wyrwas was Moderator, or senior leader, of Boston’s presbytery, the regional governing body for Boston-area churches. A year later, he was the presbytery’s minister commissioner to the 193rd General Assembly in Houston.\n\nA Boston Presbytery colleague described him as “an articulate and calming presence” at presbytery meetings and “invaluable” as chair of the Committee on Ministry. He was a founding member of the presbytery’s Honorably Retired Ministers group.\n\nWyrwas remained the pastor of the Lynn congregation for 20 years, finding time to earn two graduate degrees—Master’s of Sacred Theology and Doctor of Ministry—from the Andover Newton Theological School in Newton Centre, Mass. He also was a long-time adjunct faculty member of the school.\n\nIn addition to his ecclesiastical training, Wyrwas was a licensed psychologist and was a member of both the American Psychological Association and the Massachusetts Psychological Association.\n\nA natural raconteur, he also enjoyed sharing humorous stories and indulging his children. His daughter Margaret said he delighted in impishly treating her and her siblings to soda and candy when they accompanied him on errands without Ethel, who frowned on her children indulging in junk food.\n\n“Family was most important in Dad’s eyes,” his son, David, said. “The second most important thing was education and knowledge. He continually was trying to enhance his knowledge and wanted to share it with everyone he came in contact with.”\n\nHis musical tastes ran from Frank Sinatra to Rod Stewart, and he had a treasure chest of amusing stories to share with his family, students and parishioners.\n\n“Dad was a man of deep faith, devotion to his family and friends, and dedication to helping others,” his younger daughter, Susan Lynn, recalled. “He was willing to listen and give advice, and would surprise people who didn’t know him with his dry wit.”\n\nSusan Lynn’s son Daniel, using his nickname for the pastor, said, “Grampie had a story for everything with a knack for telling them to others. At the end of each story, he would typically share a good laugh with everyone he was telling the story to.”\n\nWyrwas was a lifetime member of Clan Mackenzie Society of the Americas, a Master Mason for 20 years with the Lynnfield-Zetland Lodge, chaplain for the Daughters of Scotia, and president and chaplain of the Scots’ Charitable Society.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Ethel, a retired Registered Nurse Practitioner; daughters Margaret (Peter Thorner) of Westport, Conn., and Susan Lynn (Kevin Winters) of Easton, Mass.; son David (Myoung Hee) of Merrimack, N.H.; and grandson Daniel B. Winters of Philadelphia, PA.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; siblings Leonard, Margaret (Banks), Raymond, Maxwell, and Harold; and grandsons Thomas Ryan Winters, John David Wyrwas, and Edward Gerald Wyrwas.\n\nA memorial service will be held at 1 p.m. at the Bedford Presbyterian Church, 4 Church Road in Bedford, N.H. on September 28, 2024, which would have been his 90th birthday. The Rev. Dr. John Sawyer will conduct the service. Interment will occur in the Sand Hill Cemetery, Upper Nine Mile River in Nova Scotia at a later date.\n\nIt has been suggested that those who wish may make memorial contributions to one of these groups: the Alzheimer’s Association, Presbytery of Boston, Scots’ Charitable Society Scholarships and the Bedford Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe Wyrwas family gives special thanks to Gerry’s caregivers: the memory care staff at the Bedford Falls Assisted Living Facility, clinical staff members at Brookhaven Hospice, both in Bedford, N.H., and the Rivet Funeral Home and Crematorium in Merrimack, N.H.\n\nMake an ACPE Foundation Gift in Rev. Dr. Gerald \"Gerry\" Wyrwas' Memory"
