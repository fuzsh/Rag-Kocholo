        "text": "As an American Civl War reenactor and living historian, I have conducted a lot of research into the...mundane. I got \"hooked\" on food stuffs that would have been present in the \"then/there\", while looking for something completely unrelated; the research (and food container labels) had added to my period impression, and allowed me yet another \"area of discussion\" for living history presentations. Civil War soldiers ate more beans than any other vegetable. When meat was scarce the most common protein alternative widely available were beans, most commonly issued \"dry\"; my fifth \"bit of a history lesson\" provides some insight about \"ready-to-eat\" pork & beans.\n\nThe Van Camp family immigrated to North America and settled in New Holland (now New Jersey) in the 17th century. Charles Van Camp relocated to and settled in the Indiana Territory in 1804, working as a farmer and wainwright (wagon maker). His son, Gilbert Courtland Van Camp, was born in Brookville, Indiana in 1817.\n\nWhen Gilbert was 17, he went to work at a flour mill near his home and learned the trade of miller. At the end of four years he opened a store selling tin ware and stoves with a partner. Van Camp learned the trade of tinsmith, making much of the merchandise he sold at the Brookville store.\n\nAfter four years, he sold his interest and, from 1845 to 1860, worked as a tinsmith around Greensburg. In 1844, he married Mary Ann Gregg, who in died 1849. In 1850, he took a second wife, Hester Jane Raymond, the daughter of Thomas and Amy (Fluelling) Raymond, a farming family in Franklin County.\n\nIn 1861, Gilbert and Hester moved to Indianapolis, where he became the junior partner in the grocery of Martin Williams (a fruit grower) and Calvin Fletcher (a financier). Shortly after, he became proprietor of his own business, The Fruit House Grocery. Here he put his metal-working skills to work, and built what is believed to be the nation’s first cold-storage food warehouse to store fruits, meats, and other perishables. The warehouse had walls three feet thick, sandwiching cut straw between two sheets of iron.\n\nIn 1862, Gilbert expanded into canning raspberries, blackberries, peaches and tomatoes in six-gallon cans. The products were sold to retail grocers, who resold the contents by the pint and quart and returned the cans for refilling. The fruit farm belonging to the company could not meet the demand, so they sent out packers with wagons loaded with cans and cooking pans to can the fruit in the orchards and haul it back to Indianapolis. One of Hester’s specialties was tender beans flavored with cured pork – pork and beans – which Gilbert also canned for his grocery.\n\nShortly thereafter, Van Camp secured a lucrative contract to supply Union troops with canned pork and beans (Hester’s recipe); Van Camp's pork and beans quickly became a wartime staple.\n\nThere is some controversy regarding the Van Camp Pork and Bean story. For example, sources refute the story that Hester could have prepared enough of her recipe over her stove to fulfill the supposed Union contract. [In this instance, these particular sources could use a little more research into the canning industry of the mid-nineteenth century; i.e., “Hester’s recipe” is NOT semantically equal to “Hester fulfilling a contract by preparing her recipe on her own stove”. Remember, Gilbert was already canning fruit in large quantities “in the field”…Hester’s recipe would likely have been “mass-prepared” in similar fashion…]\n\nAnother source credits Gilbert’s son Frank with the addition of tomato ketchup (also produced by Van Camp prior to the war) as a result of “mom” sending over a pot of beans after a fire destroyed one of their processing plants ca 1880. Frank is purported to have wanted a bit more flavor in the pork and beans, and he did so by adding ketchup salvaged from the fire.\n\nAnother source contradicts this version, saying that, “Having the beans with tomato sauce in cans provided the armed forces with cooked and already prepared and tasty food, available at any time. At that time, Van Camp canned beans were even advertised for either hot or cold consumption.”\n\nYet another source contradicts the previous two stories – “In 1894 an Indianapolis jobber brought a load of canned baked beans to the Van Camp plant to have them reprocessed. At lunch time, Frank Van Camp, the founder's son, opened a can from the jobbing house to eat with his lunch. The flavor of the beans was flat, so to make them more palatable he added some Van Camps' ketchup, originating \"Van Camp's Pork and Beans with Tomato Sauce.\"”\n\nAnd a final “variation on the theme”. A series of emails were sent to Roger M. Grace, author of the “Reminiscing” column of the Los Angeles Metropolitan News-Enterprise. In his column dated September 14, 2006, he received 3 emails from a Mr. Robert R. Smith of Fishers, Indiana, a great, great nephew of Hester Van Camp –\n\n“Family, and other sources, say that the recipe came from Gilbert’s wife Hester (nee Raymond). “She modified an old Raymond family recipe by adding tomato sauce.” “I do not know for certain when Hester started making beans with tomato sauce but my guess is that she started when she and Gilbert opened their grocery store (which they called “The Fruit House”) in downtown Indianapolis around 1861.” “The fact that Gilbert and Hester moved to Indianapolis and opened their store in 1861 raises questions how a startup small grocery could begin immediately supplying the union Army with enough Pork and Beans.” “[H]ere is some speculation on my part. Perhaps the contract that the Van Camps had with the Army was for Camp Morton which was located in Indianapolis.\n\nThe Camp was opened in April of 1861 as a training site for new Indiana recruits. The site was the old Indiana State fairgrounds and was selected by Adjutant General Lew Wallace who would later write ‘Ben Hur’ and other books. Lew Wallace was born and educated in Brooklyn, Indiana in Franklin County, where...Hester and Gilbert lived.” (Camp Morton would become a Prisoner of War Camp for Confederate soldiers beginning in February, 1862.)\n\nSo…I am convinced that Gilbert Van Camp was awarded a contract to supply tinned goods to the Union Army; specifically, “pork and beans”. I am likewise convinced that “tinned pork and beans” were supplied to Federal troops, likely in a garrison environment. There are just too many sources corroborating my conviction.\n\nA small digression – According to dictionaries, “tomato ketchup\" is a form of tomato sauce, since a sauce is simply \"a liquid, semi-solid, or cream food served on other foods\".\n\nWhy the digression? If you review the “Label from Van Camp's Boston Baked Pork and Beans, ca. 1900”, you’ll notice in the blue scroll the words, “Prepared with tomato sauce”…and immediately to the left of the scroll, a bottle of red content which has been labelled… “CATSUP”!\n\nIn American English, \"tomato sauce\" is generally distinct from \"ketchup\". \"Sauce\" would be the kind of tomato product you would eat with spaghetti, or put on pizza, or eat with chicken parmigiana. It generally does not contain much added sugar or other \"sweet spices\", and it may or may not be completely blended. In the UK and in most Commonwealth countries, tomato sauce is more or less a synonym for tomato ketchup. Tomato sauce is any sauce made primarily with tomatoes— but what kind of sauce is referred to will vary by audience. Ultimately, (at least in current American English), the difference comes down to application. Ketchup will rarely be eaten with pizza or spaghetti, and few people would eat tomato sauce with fries or hot dogs. It's not so much a matter of people deliberately distinguishing the words as that the distinction arose organically.\n\nSo…did Hester Van Camp really “doctor” the beans with tomato ketchup (or if you prefer, “sauce”?) I’m inclined to think that she did. Bottled ketchup was not unknown; it was first marketed commercially in New York City by Bunker and Company in 1834, and sold in Hartford, Connecticut in 1838. William Underwood (of \"Deviled Ham\" fame) also manufactured tomato ketchup; by 1839, his brand (in 2-pound bottles that sold for $3.25 each) was being shipped to Mobile, Pensacola, New Orleans, and throughout the Mississippi River system. It was bottled commercially in St. Louis in 1844, and in New Jersey in 1855. By 1860, commercially bottled tomato ketchup was sold in most major cities in the United States.\n\nVan Camp’s Pork and Beans are still on store shelves today, and marketed with the same name used during the Civil War.And if you happen to look at the modern label, you’ll notice that van Camp’s Pork and Beans have been, “SATISFYING FAMILIES SINCE 1861”.\n\n***\n\nI happened across the ca. 1900 Van Camp’s Pork and Beans label about 10 years ago, just as my interest in “period” labels started. I have used it in making my “tomato juice can tin boilers”, knowing that it came into being some 35 years after the war; I have also encountered occasions where other reenactors have used it as well to “mask” their modern cans…both the color version, and a “black & white” variation.\n\nWhile “Van Camp’s Pork and Beans” remain available to this day, the company founded by Gilbert Van Camp in 1861 has since changed hands many times. The brand is currently owned by Conagra Brands, and I turned to them with a request to see if there might be an image, or a written description of a tin label for “Van Camp’s Pork and Beans in Tomato Sauce”. Within two days of my inquiry, I received a response from a Miss Christine, who is a Consumer Affairs Representative with Conagra, “I'm so sorry, but we do not have a product label or a description of one from the time period you requested. I wish we did because what you want it for is very interesting indeed.” As a measure of my gratitude for Miss Christine’s effort, I have sent her a copy of this article, along with a note conveying my gratitude.\n\nAs has been more often than not the case, I determined to create what I hope will be an acceptable facsimile. I came up with two; one a “commercial/home use” variant, the other a “contract” version.\n\n***\n\nReferences –\n\nWikipedia Contributors. “Van Camp’s.” Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia.
