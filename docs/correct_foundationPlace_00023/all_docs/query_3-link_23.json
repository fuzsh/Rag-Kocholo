        "text": "Art of Problem Solving was founded by Richard Rusczyk in 2003 to create interactive educational opportunities for avid math students. Richard is the author or a co-author of 7 AoPS textbooks and a past Director of the USA Mathematical Talent Search. He was a participant in National MATHCOUNTS, a three-time participant in the Math Olympiad Summer Program, and a USA Mathematical Olympiad winner (1989). He received the World Federation of National Mathematics Competitions Paul Erdös Award in 2014. He graduated from Princeton University in 1993, and worked as a bond trader for D.E. Shaw & Company for four years. AoPS marks Richard's return to his vocation - educating motivated students.\n\nIn 2014, Glen founded a learning center in Morrisville, North Carolina, that two years later became the first AoPS Academy campus. Glen served as the National Director of AoPS Academy until his retirement in 2019. He has experience as a college math professor, statistician, and expert SAS programmer. He has been a professional math tutor for many years, and specializes in training academically-advanced and high-performing math students. Glen is a graduate of Duke University and holds a graduate degree in statistics from Boston University.\n\nDave joined AoPS in 2004. He is the author or a co-author of 4 AoPS textbooks. Dave earned the sole perfect score on the American High School Mathematics Examination (AHSME) in 1988 and was a USA Mathematical Olympiad winner that year. He attended the Research Science Institute (RSI) in 1987, and the Math Olympiad Summer Program in 1988, where he first met fellow student Richard Rusczyk. He also finished in the top 10 on the Putnam exam in 1991. Dave graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 1992 with a BS in Mathematics/Computer Science and an MS in Mathematics. He went on to earn his Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT in 1997. He was an acting Assistant Professor at the University of Washington from 1997 to 2001. Dave is originally from Western New York and is an alumnus of the SUNY Buffalo Gifted Math Program.\n\nHaving earned an IB Diploma in high school, he went on to complete a dual BA from Vassar College in mathematics and Chinese.

After giving some suggestions for improvements to the organizer, he was invited to re-write the class, and was presenting it a few weeks later. He has been teaching this Practical Mathematics Using Lego Robots course as an elective or after school class at various public and private schools ever since. Roland was a reliability engineer for Amazon's devices group (lots of math and statistics), but became increasingly aware that being in front of a classroom was much more fun than his day job. In June of 2023, Amazon gave him the gift of laying him off, which has led him to enroll in the Masters in Teaching program at SJSU and apply to AoPS. Roland's obsession with math is finding ways to make it practical. Math is a wonderful modeling tool — it is spectacularly good at proving things, but it is a lousy teaching tool. He specializes in finding ways to present the problems in the physical systems that the math can be used to model/solve before introducing the math itself. This is particularly effective when teaching more esoteric math such as calculus and statistics (he specializes in teaching calculus to middle school students).\n\nPeter has a Master of Arts degree in mathematics from SUNY Potsdam. Upon graduation, Peter relocated to California and worked for Hewlett-Packard (HP) in engineering and managerial roles before retiring from HP in 2020.
