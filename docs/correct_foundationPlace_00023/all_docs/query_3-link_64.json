From Jr. Kindergarten through 8th Grade, faculty and staff have the time to work closely with individual stu- dents, whether it be guiding them through tough math problems or coaching them through life lessons. Technology is embraced in all classrooms, with the youngest students learning their way around laptops and iPads and the building blocks of programming and slightly older students delving into digital media, 3D printing, videography, app design, animation, robotics and more. Graduates are regularly accepted at the Bay Areaâs top private high schools and the nationâs most selective colleges. But they rarely leave Old Orchard entirely. They return frequently to visit teachers and friends, share what they are up to, and to say thanks for the great start in school and in life. The reason is simple. Old Orchard has grown, but Dannie Westonâs original vision remains firmly in place: A schoolâs sole purpose is to serve children in every possible sense. Here is some additional copy that is slightly short- er and speaks more to opportunities to visit: At Old Orchard, students are the heart of a warm and supportive educational community. We ask a lot of our students, academically and socially, and pro- vide them with the skills, encouragement, and sup- port they need to rise to the challenge.\n\nOld Orchard School was established in 1973 by founder Dannie Weston. Uninspired by the educa- tional opportunities available to her own children, Mrs. Weston decided to create the school she wanted for them: a warm and friendly educational communi- ty that would ask a lot of its students academically and socially, and provide them with the skills, encour- agement and support they would need to rise to the challenge. Old Orchard opened with one classroom, two grades, and Mrs. Weston as its only teacher. Today, the school offers Jr. Kindergarten through 8th Grade across two campuses in Campbell, CA. The student body represents a diverse group of students, drawn from all corners of and all communities within Silicon Valley. Old Orchard, much like its students, grew at a challenging but comfortable pace, always engaged, but never rushed. Now in its 46th year, Old Orchard continues to grow and evolve while still honoring its founderâs values. Academic subjects are accelerated, but never rushed. Instruction is hands-on and led by talented teachers who are passionate about their subjects and skilled at making them accessible to learners of all kinds. In all grades and in every subject, teachers emphasize comprehension and cultivate studentsâ critical thinking skills, encouraging them to work toward thoughtful solutions to challenging questions. Students are encouraged to âcompeteâ only with themselves and to do their best every day. Digital, visual and performing arts programs offer balance in the studentâs day, providing creative outlets that also\n\nwww. indiaparentmagazine.org\n\nOctober 2019\n\nSCHEDULE A SCHOOL-DAY TOUR Sign up for a private, school-day tour to experience a day in the life at Old Orchard.

Every step of the way, our JrK-8th grade staff have the time to work closely with indi- vidual students, whether it be guiding them through tough math problems or coaching them through life lessons.

Really! This is not just a clichÃ© at he Music Place. It is our unique approach. How do we do it? Everyone knows that excellence requires hard work, but who knows how to get kids to work hard? We do! Our âThree steps toward excellenceâ philosophy underscores everything we do and boils down to 3-phases of learning: 1) Start with FUN, which leads to... We clearly define an educational philosophy that starts with fun !\n\nWe keep the fun going in the sum- mer too! In addition to 25-30 deeply\n\nbegin on one of the 5-step music learn- ing journey\n\nWe work with everyone of all abili- ties or disabilities! Not only do we welcome all cul- tures and religions, if your student happens to have special needs, we are proud to help! Free assessments help guide families toward special needs coaches who help kids learn music OR Board Certified music therapists whose more specialized care is often covered by insurance! We find the right teachers for the right place in the journey. Teachers are evaluated individual- ly and recommended accordingly. Although most teachers have a B.A. or higher, the more important issue at The Music Place is âCan this teacher engage the students in a positive stim- ulating way?â âAre they a phase 1, 2 or 3 teacher?â Remember! The goal is to make learning fun! Lessons when and where you want & Online Registration? We want it to be fun for you too! With dozens of locations (Gilroy to Sunnyvale) and 50 teachers, we help coordinate siblings together. Whichever is more fun! The major- ity of lessons at the Music Place are private (1-1), however small group music or dance classes are available from ages 6 months and average about 5-6 students. Try one free! Group or private lesson?\n\ndiscounted music & dance camps, our favorite promotion during the summer is the discounted CLASS PASS. This allows a child or family to attend an unlimited number of group music or dance classes! The Music Place staff is committed to making music learning a wonderful part of growing up by approaching it without the intensity that pressures kids to do more than they are develop- mentally ready to do. If a child leaves a class and says âmusic is boring or too hardâ then we have failed. When they leave with a greater love ignited in their hearts, then we have accom- plished our goal by giving them the keys to a lifetime of musical enjoy- ment.\n\n2) Getting drawn into Hard Work, which leads to progress which leads to... 3) Growing passion and Excellence, which leads to a life time of enjoyment. Parents are encouraged to bring students to a fun (free!) individualized assessment where an Educational Specialist plays some games to help identify their learning style, musical aptitudes and readiness for instrumen- tal instruction. Parents then receive expert and individualized guidance regarding where their child might best We individualize the approach!\n\nwww. indiaparentmagazine.org\n\nOctober 2019\n\nExpires 11/19\n\nExpires 11/19\n\nExpires 11/19\n\nwww, indiaparentmagazine.org\n\nOctober 2019\n\nJrK-8th\n\nCelebrating 46 years\n\nOpen House Saturdays, Nov. 9 and Feb. 1 â¢ 11 am to 2 pm RSVP at oldorchardschool.com or call (408) 378-5935\n\nA C T I O N D A Y P R I M A R Y P L U S\n\nStart Ahead.

Dr. Jiang seems to know how! The Ivy Advisor\n\nPh.D. from Ivy League school Columbia University. He served as a tenured full professor for twenty-six years until his retirement from San Jose State University at 2016. He also served as Dean of Faculty and Director of School of Management in San Jose State University. His biography has appeared since 1997 in Who's Who Among Asian Americans, Marquis Who's Who in America, Marquis Who's Who in Business and Finance and Marquis Who's Who in the World. Dr. William Jiang is trilingual: English, Chinese, and Spanish. and partner of The Ivy Advisor, an education consulting and college admissions counseling firm. Dr. William Jiang guided his son and daughter to Ivy League schools (son to Harvard and daughter to Cornell). He has also guided over a hundred stu- dents to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Stanford and ALL other elite colleges over the years. He, along with his wife who helps him with all administrative and admission work so as to let Dr. Jiang focus on his methods of teaching and consulting, runs The Ivy Advisor successfully making it the top such col- lege counseling and SAT prep institu- tion. Several parents who admit their children into the Ivy Advisor told IPM that they are extremely happy with the results and would also bring their sec- ond child for training under Dr. Jiang. WHY THE IVY ADVISOR Dr. William Jiang is the founder\n\nMany students these days are both well-rounded and academic achievers with dreams of getting admission into a good college. You just have to visit a Lynbrook or a Monta Vista high school to observe this phenomenon first hand. These students crave a good col- lege to hone their skills and fuel the trajectory of their careers. Other students still research around, looking for the right guidance to help them advance to their goals. Both breeds of students need a com- mon guiding force to help them selec- tively and precisely carve out their future. That's where Dr. Jiang's Ivy Advisor comes in. By mentoring stu- dents and helping them follow a well- researched, unique path based on the student's academic passions, success at the Ivy Advisor seems almost unavoidable. W HAT STUDENTS AND PARENTS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT D R . J IANG (Actual names of the students have been changed to protect their privacy) Karen, U Chicago \"Hi Dr. Jiang, Just wanted to say THANK YOU for everything! I found out I was accepted early to U Chicago earlier today and I could not thank you enough for all the help and guidance you've given me through this journey. Thank you for sup- porting me every step of the way! This is honestly such a dream come true, and I am so thankful and blessed for all your sup- port.\"\n\nJoseph, SAT \"Dear Dr. Jiang, I recently took the October SAT and scored a 1580, which I was really surprised about because I was just a sophomore. I think your summer class for the Advanced English reader real- ly helped me build my vocabulary and helped me with the writing section! Thank you so much for the fun class, and I hope to see you again in the future!\" Sekhar, SAT \"Hello Professor Jiang, Many years ago, I took your SAT class. I am writing this email to thank you for the great class I took many years ago. I am entering my final year at the University of Chicago and preparing for the GMAT exam. After all these years, I am using your SAT Handbook to study! The concepts in these books are definitely applicable to the GMAT and are presented in a clear and concise manner. I have never considered myself a good writer. However, the gram- mar you taught me stuck with me through- out college. My papers are much stronger because of the rules you taught me! I am also able to effectively edit the writing of my peers as well! Thank you, again, for the great SAT class. Looking back on my col- lege papers and looking forward to the GMAT, I realize how impactful your class has been beyond the SAT.\" MEET DR.

The goal of this portable lab is to nurture environmental literacy, creating a pop- ulation of young people whose approach to their environment reflects responsibility, stewardship and com- mitment. Today, the Insect Discovery Lab presents more than 800 programs a year, reaching more than 38,000 chil- dren annually. Bringing the lab into the classroom has allowed Norm to have direct influence in children's lives. In 2005 and 2006 he nurtured and nomi- nated a young medically challenged 10-year-old boy for the Young International Eco-Hero Award and the Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes. The boy won both awards, and in turn is working to inspire other children around the world.\n\nNorman director SaveNature.org is the very embodi- ment of the spirit of preserving the nat- ural world. Over his 41-year career, he has shared his love of nature with nearly half a million young students, helping to ignite their own desires to become active stewards of the earth. Building on their enthusiasm, he has created multiple opportunities for them to put their activism to work. He has trained teachers and educational specialists to keep spreading the word, has taken his message to the airwaves and on the road to major news media, conservation organizations, and edu- cational institutions. Norm's signature impact is the ripple effect. From his post in San Francisco as co-founder and CEO of SaveNature.Org and co- founder of the Insect Discovery Lab, he has pushed out into the world an empowering, hopeful, but urgent mes- sage of agency to their young: the world is in your hands. In 1998, Norm co-founded the Gershenz,\n\nOne on one with Norman Gershenz, Director, SaveNature.org, and co-founder, Insect Discovery Lab. He talks about summer camps, birthday parties and the importance of reconnecting kids to outdoor explorations! \"There is nothing like the Insect Discovery Lab - watching a young child have the opportunity to hold a Madagascar hissing cockroach or a giant African millipede changes their life forever.\" IPM: Can you please tell us your a little about the kind of birthday par- ties you conduct for youngsters? Norman Gershenz (NG): Our edu- cator brings \"fun science\" to the party! The Insect Discovery Lab is the most hands-on experience any birthday child (or family) can imagine - dark- ling beetles, eastern lubber grasshop- pers, giant African millipedes, Australian walking sticks and much more! We ask to limit the group to around 20 kids (we know there could be up to 20 adults present as well) so we present to both the children and the adults. NG: There is nothing like the Insect Discovery Lab - watching a young child have the opportunity to hold a Madagascar hissing cockroach or a giant African millipede changes their life forever. Also, we are the only group that links this \"nature\" experi- ence with actually saving nature in rainforest and coral reefs through SaveNature.Org's Adopt-An Acre and Adopt-A-Reef program. IPM: How do you think it's differ- ent from other such parties?\n\nSaveNature.Org is creating schol- arship to Bay Area elementary schools, reaching students in grades K- 4 and their teachers from urban schools with scientific hands-on pre- sentations over the period of the school calendar year. Brief history of SaveNature.org Founded in 1988, SaveNature.Org focused its efforts on protecting threat- ened ecosystems and natural commu- nities through conservation programs, such as Adopt an AcreÂ® and ReefÂ®. While SaveNature's general focus is conservation, in 1998 SaveNature.Org restructured efforts to connect youth to nature by providing educational pro- grams that serves over 2,500 inner city youth and more than 30,000 students in the greater San Francisco Bay Area each year. SaveNature.Org has devel- oped one of the most successful educa- tional outreach programs for the greater San Francisco Bay Area com- munity, teaching and impacting more than half-million children since 1998; presenting more than 800 programs annually. Their goal is to provide a pathway for children to develop a con- fidence of belonging in relation to all things independent from turmoil at home or at school. Ultimately, building a foundation to ensure youth take responsibility for creating a positive change in their lives and in their com- munities. They have created three proven and dynamic hands-on classes to fos- ter enthusiasm about science and nature. These programs are part of their new Nature Academy. They are Owl Pellet Discovery, the art of Squid Science Dissection and EdibleEdVentures - linking the health of the planet to the health of a child. Nature Academy is fashioned after the Insect Discovery Lab, one of the most successful educational outreach pro- grams in the United States. To date, the Insect Discovery Lab has touched the lives of more than 521,044 children since 1998 with the Insect Discovery Lab's BugMobileÂ®. Their goal is to grow the Nature Academy as we have the Insect Discovery Lab with commit- ment and passion.\n\nmental stewards to save wildlife and wild places in nature. SaveNature.Org's mission is to link people to save wildlife and wild places through the purchase and pro- tection of habitat in nature. Its goal is to bring educational equality to those underserved in their community, increasing the opportunity for real and personal environmental stewardship for this generation and future genera- tions. Their educational outreach pro- grams provide a pathway for children to wonder and develop an anchor of belonging to their natural environ- ment. Ultimately building a founda- tion to ensure youth take responsibili- ty for creating a positive change in their lives, in their community, and, in the world. The cornerstone goal of all of their programs is to nurture environmental literacy and create a population of young people whose approach to their environment reflects responsibility, stewardship and commitment. Their program activities provide connec- tions and opportunities for youth to develop a deeper understanding of themselves and their community ecosystem. Through encounters with nature in the city and exposure to sci- ence as a hands-on process, students will be able to grow as leaders in their school and the community.
