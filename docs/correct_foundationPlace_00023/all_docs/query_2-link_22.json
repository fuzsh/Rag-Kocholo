        "text": "At the end of October, four of our real estate agents from Rainmaker Properties went on the Mountain View Whisman School District “Get on the bus tour” to learn more about what the local schools offer besides strong API (Academic Performance Index) scores. Homebuyers, along with real estate agents, tend to put a strong bias on high API scores, especially since good schools can translate into better priced homes. But in cities like Mountain View, where the majority of the school district is either at the state API goal of 800 or above, we can start to consider other factors in the makeup of a school to see if it is the best fit for a child.\n\nRead on to find out what our agents discovered on the tour and some of their insights. At the end we have tables showing all the API scores from elementary to high school in Mountain View, including school ranking and subgroup scores.\n\nChristine Ko on the tour and the Mountain View Education Foundation (MVEF)\n\nThe real estate agent tour was held by the MVEF, hosted by the new Superintendent, Craig Goldman, along with a tour of Crittenden Middle School by Principal Karen Robinson. Following a walk around Crittenden, the agents took a bus tour of all the elementary and middle schools in Mountain View.\n\nA notable aspect of the MVEF is that they work with parents and the community to raise money for school programs that are no longer funded by the state. This includes funding in the arts, music, and sciences at the elementary level, and electives and after-school sports for middle school.\n\nChristine mentioned that a highlight of the tour was finding out what unique programs each school had. We have a handout (the images below) that shows enrollment boundaries for the elementary schools, a quick description of special programs, and each school's 2010 API scores. Included are Benjamin Bubb, Mariano Castro, Edith Landels, Frank L. Huff, Stevenson, Monta Loma, and Theuerkauf elementary schools, and Graham and Crittenden middle schools.\n\nEdmund Yue and James Yang on looking past API scores\n\nThe biggest point James took from the tour was that API scores should never be the only determining factor parents consider when choosing a school for their child.\n\nAPI scores are restricted to academic performance, and does not do a complete job of comparing overall school quality. Some areas that parents should also look at are the school’s administration, community involvement, and existing programs that encourage both struggling and promising students.\n\nEdmund added that Superintendent Craig Goldman mentioned one way parents could pull additional information about a school’s API score is to look at the subgroup scores and demographic information. (We have more about this in the API graphs below.) If you combine that information along with staff involvement with students and take into account unique schools programs, such as at Mariano Castro Elementary School, where the students go through a Spanish-English dual immersion program, parents can really get a good idea of what a school is about.\n\nKristine Suh, a parent, on deciding which school was right for her children\n\nAs a parent, Kristine experienced the process of deciding what school would be right for her children 10 years ago, and now has advice for parents in the same situation.\n\nHer family had the opportunity to choose between Los Altos, Palo Alto, and Mountain View school districts, ultimately ending up in Los Altos.\n\nShe said that API scores were an important part of her initial search, but she has found that scores play only a small role in the child’s day-to-day education. On top of school research, if the parent has time, is why not meet with the potential school’s teachers and sit in a class. You may find that scores are not as important as what is the actual children’s relationship is with the teacher.\n\nAt the high school level, she said it is important to also consider the number of advanced placement classes available. One school might have a high API score but few options for AP classes. But, on the other hand, a school might have a medium API score, perhaps because of a large demographic and socioeconomic spread, but a breadth of AP classes.\n\nLastly, a good resource online to look at an endless stream of information on school, find parent reviews, and more is available at greatschools.org. If you are interested in talking with a representative in the Mountain View Whisman School District that can put you in contact with involved teachers and parents, feel free to contact us.\n\nThe California Department of Education has released its 2008 Growth API scores for Santa Clara County and San Mateo County, which measure yearly improvement from the state's 2007 Base API scores. The API (Academic Performance Index) scores are considered the cornerstone of California's Public Schools Accountability Act of 1999, and measure the academic performance and growth of the state's schools according to a range of academic factors.\n\nThe Los Altos, Saratoga, Cupertino, and Palo Alto elementary school districts all maintained district API averages above 900, an excellent score (which is par for the course in these districts).\n\nThe competitive Cupertino Union schools improved from an already-elite score of 930 to 941, and its border school Stocklmeir Elementary --- which students who are living in Sunnyvale can attend --- notched up 13 points to 959. To offer some perspective as to the strength of these scores, the average state API for all grades is 742, up from 728 last year.\n\nThis year's score report also reflects improvements at both Cumberland and Cherry Chase, the two top elementary schools in Sunnyvale. Both broke the 900 mark once again, with respective scores of 920 and 909.\n\nAlso emerging are up-and-coming schools to watch. Take Ellis Elementary in Sunnyvale, which entered the 21st century with a score in the mid-700s and now consistently scores in excess of 800. This year, Ellis improved 17 points with a score of 831.\n\nThe Campbell Union Elementary District's Forest Hill is another school on the move. At a 2008 score of 888, Forest Hill is inching closer to breaking the 900 barrier. Up from 879 last year, Forest Hill was a low-800s school in 2000. We'll continue to keep an eye on these continually improving school systems as they maintain their march up the API ladder.\n\nBuy low, sell high. A lot of people ignore this truism and they believe they have good reason for doing so. Sometimes several good reasons. After all, it's not the same as the stock market: most people don't love their money. Sure, they want the best for it, but mostly because of the things more of it buys. What does it buy? It depends on the person. Maybe freedom, or time, or an easier life, or the future, often in a college education of their children.\n\nNo, stocks don't come with locations, or school districts, or uses, except for those jokes about dot-com stocks and toilet paper back at the turn of the century. But whether my clients are investing in real estate for love or money, I consider providing a solid understanding of the strategies behind choosing a school district an essential part of their property search.\n\nWhen buying a home in Silicon Valley, you're secondarily investing in the school district where you buy your real estate. Plus, you can tell a lot about the property you're looking at by how easy the listing agent makes it to find the schools for that location. But how you choose a school district --- or said more generally, how you choose the right location for your home search --- depends on your answer. Are you buying a home for love or money?\n\nStrategies for Choosing the Right Bay Area School District\n\nThe trick is that it's not an either-or proposition. It's a matter of what resources you have, how much you're willing to spend and how you prioritize your home search. As I do with my clients, we'll examine several options from least to most expensive.\n\n1) Opting-Out\n\nIt wasn't the first time I'd heard this, but it was the most succinct. \"Alex,\" he said, \"I love my kid to death. This move is already very stressful on him and I want him to be in an environment where he can focus more on making friends than competing for grades.\"\n\nI wanted to bring this up as a possibility because some parents believe that an good education is important but isn't necessarily worth the pressure on their children.\n\n2) Buying Low, Selling High\n\nA home in an ascending school district often has more upside potential than a home in a prestigious school district where the quality of the schools is already built into the price of the home. That isn't to say a home in the less expensive neighborhood will appreciate more, in real terms or as a percentage.\n\nIt's that you may not want to pay for something you don't need and you can put that money into more land or home improvements, which will increase your value for money. Also, if you choose a school district that is continually improving, you'll benefit even more because you'll be receiving value for something you didn't pay upfront for.\n\nLet's look at two neighboring cities: Cupertino and Sunnyvale. Cupertino's reputation for schools precedes it and it occupies a very specific market niche. Sure, the shopping mall at Cupertino Square is undergoing a revitalization effort and its wine country, hidden away towards the mountains, has a breathtaking view of all Silicon Valley. But Cupertino is all about the schools, and it's right to be quite proud of that. For many of my clients, that's all they need to know and we skip to #4.\n\nDespite their geographic locations, there are two major differences between Cupertino and Sunnyvale. The first is in relative pricing in both single-family homes plus townhomes and condominiums. Cupertino is represented using red hues and Sunnyvale using blue hues below. The difference in medians between single-family home prices in the two cities was $325,000 in April 2007.\n\nWith a difference of $325,000 in the two real estate prices, one style of value investor would consider the bottom-line cost savings, the number of improvements that can be made to the house for that cost saving, and potential appreciation of an improving school district.\n\nThat type of investor may or may not have kids to send to that school district and the upside of improving API scores or a local school working towards a California Distinguished School award may be appealing. For families with children, the cost savings between median houses in those two areas could pay for not only private schools but college.\n\nSome schools, like Bullis Charter School (which has an off-the-charts API score of 973 and a 10 out of 10 ranking both statewide and for similar demographics --- and a similarly impressive wait list) take residents from anywhere in California. There is technically no tuition but a donation ($3,500 at Bullis) is expected.\n\n3) Unearthing a Hidden Gem\n\nPalo Alto, Saratoga, Los Altos, Cupertino, Pleasanton. The names alone read like a Who's Who list of elite school districts, not only in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area, but across California and even nationwide.\n\nSome of the best Bay Area school districts like Palo Alto are even opting out of the ranking game, choosing to focus on students and what's best for them, rather than on making sure students hit all the checkboxes needed for those districts to get high rankings.\n\nAnd voters in cities like Cupertino protect their schools by restricting growth, and the additional load on their prestigious school district, even though there may be enough land physically to support more developments. You pay the premium in those areas.\n\nBut there are quality schools in cities that don't have the same elite reputation. For example, Moreland Elementary School District in San Jose between Cupertino, Campbell, and Saratoga has 5 elementary schools with API scores over 850, with Country Lane Elementary at 915. Sunnyvale's Cherry Chase Elementary hit 941 in 2006, with a 10 out of 10 statewide ranking; and Cumberland comes in at a more-than-respectable 865 with a 9 out of 10. Roy Cloud Elementary in Redwood City is a 9 out of 10 with an 883 API, and Redwood City's North Star magnet school rates at a 985 API and 10 out of 10.\n\nAlso, because cities overlap unified school districts, it's possible that a home in one city will be covered by a school in another city. This is particularly noticeable in Sunnyvale and Cupertino where they share the Stocklmeir Elementary and Cupertino Middle among others.\n\nI combed through the spreadsheet I built with over 400 schools so there are too many gems to list. The reason why I put it together is to highlight schools that have increased their API scores in three years successively, so my clients know where there might be good values. The point I highlight for them is that it's the choice between buying the name of the city and buying the school. When you choose to buy the school, you may not have to pay for the name.\n\nBut there is nothing wrong with buying the name: you get similar benefits and pricing to the way people buy and resell name-brands.\n\n4) Buying the City\n\nIt's the commitment. The priorities. Some cities have theirs in a different place. Foster City has been putting off building their own high school because they want to focus on commercial and industrial uses of land. Cupertino virtually requires developers to help fund their school system. The median price of homes is about the same in both cities.\n\nThere are the other benefits to buying the brand name. The brand recognition. The prestige. The neighborhood. Will it be easier to sell your home at a higher price in Palo Alto or Redwood City?\n\nThe right school (combined with a strategically priced property and the right time of year) can attract multiple offers and higher prices. It works the other way round too. After all, some people will summarily dismiss a property based on the school district. (And even in the best school districts, there are certain schools that aren't as good as others.)\n\nPlus, not everyone has the time or inclination to do such in-depth research, so they rely on the name. Choosing where to spend your time is just as important as choosing where to spend your money --- and ultimately that decision is up to you. In order, the top five districts are Los Altos, Saratoga Unified, Cupertino Union, Palo Alto Unified, and Los Gatos Union. You can find the most up-to-date API rankings here.\n\nThe California Department of Education (CDE) has released the updated 2006 Academic Performance Index (API) scores for California schools, including data for San Mateo County and Santa Clara County. The API is a statewide benchmark based on standardized achievement tests which is primarily used to rank schools relative to one another and relative to schools with similar demographics. Here's an example of what the statistics look like.\n\nWe'll take a look at how school rankings and Silicon Valley real estate prices are related, but first let's look at how to read the information.\n\nNumber of Students. In the first column, you'll find the number of students whose results were included from that school. It's pretty close to the total number of students, less any excluded students. The rules for excluding students are listed in the API Base Documentation Information Guide found on the CDE API page. Surprisingly, the number of students has little to do with how well the school did in its API scores (almost, see epilogue).\n\nBase API, Statewide Rank, Similar Schools Rank. The Base API score is like an SAT score except it's from 200 to 1000. Higher is better. To make comparing schools easier, the CDE provides a statewide rank from 1 to 10 (ten is best) and a similar schools rank that rates schools (again from 1 to 10, ten being best) that have similar demographics and characteristics. Apples-to-apples in a way.\n\nGrowth Target, API Target. The growth target is the number of points California wants the school to improve in the next year. That added with the current base API score equals the API target. The CDE doesn't set a target for schools above the current statewide performance target of 800.\n\nSilicon Valley School District Scores\n\nI've assembled information from the CDE site and the Palo Alto Daily News to provide a table of school district API averages for Silicon Valley and Bay Area elementary and middle schools.\n\nComparing School Districts and Housing Prices\n\nRemember the chart of median Silicon Valley single-family home prices in February 2007 from my article Determining Your Must-Haves When Buying a House?\n\nCombining the chart for Silicon Valley school district rankings with the one for Silicon Valley median single-family real estate prices brings up some surprises. (I used a simple ratio between how far the API score was above 700 and the median single-family home price. The resulting number isn't really that relevant, it's the visual comparison I was looking for.)\n\nRegarding Schools and Value in Pricing\n\nFirst, while Cupertino and Foster City housing prices are very similar, there is a vast difference between the performance index of their school districts. On school rankings, compared to Foster City, Cupertino represents a much better value based on the median sale price of single-family homes.\n\nSecond, while Los Altos has the highest API scores, it also had a much higher median price putting it on-par with other elite school districts like Palo Alto and Los Gatos, but well-below Saratoga which had both higher test scores and a lower median home price.\n\nThird, it is possible to cherry-pick good schools in average school districts. For example, you can search around Sunnyvale's Cherry Chase Elementary, which has a base API score of 941, if you're looking for a good elementary school. Stay tuned.\n\n[ed. This is the CYA: The data in the report is considered accurate but not guaranteed.]\n\nEpilogue\n\nThere's a quirk in the ratings system where only test scores for \"statistically significant\" groups (read: ethnicities) are counted. Some schools, none that I can find documentation on, were accused of reclassifying lesser performing students into groups that weren't statistically significant to prop up their overall test scores.\n\nThere is a measure of transparency, though, because if you drill down on the individual schools, it will show which groups were counted, which weren't, and how many were in each."
