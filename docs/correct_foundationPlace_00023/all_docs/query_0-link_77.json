        "text": "The 23rd annual Silicon Valley REALTORS® Scholars Program for graduating seniors from 18 public high schools in Silicon Valley is under way. The scholars program is sponsored by the Charitable Foundation of the Silicon Valley Association of REALTORS® (SILVAR), a professional trade organization representing 5,000 REALTORS® and affiliate members engaged in the real estate business on the Peninsula and in the South Bay.\n\nThe REALTOR® scholars program is a partnership with local public high schools in SILVAR’s service area. Principals and faculty at 18 participating high schools nominate three exceptional graduating seniors. Final selections will be made by a committee that includes representatives from SILVAR.\n\nThe Charitable Foundation will award $1,500 to one nominee from each school in recognition of their exemplary record, outstanding academic performance and community spirit. Since its inception, the program has awarded $409,500 in scholarships to high school seniors in Silicon Valley.\n\n“This program is part of a long-term effort to make an investment in our collective future – our youth,” said Nina Yamaguchi, Silicon Valley REALTORS® Charitable Foundation Scholars Program chair. “The annual scholarship program is our way of thanking the students, teachers, administrators and school board members in our communities for their hard work and dedication to make the schools in our communities among the best in California and in the nation.”\n\nThe participating schools include Leigh High School and Lynbrook High School in San Jose; Westmont High School in Campbell; Fremont High School in Sunnyvale; Los Altos High School in Los Altos; Los Gatos High School in Los Gatos; Gunn High School and Palo Alto High School in Palo Alto; Menlo-Atherton High School in Atherton; Santa Clara High School and Wilcox High School in Santa Clara; Cupertino High School, Homestead High School and Monta Vista High School in Cupertino; Prospect High School and Saratoga High School in Saratoga; Mountain View High School in Mountain View; and Woodside High School in Woodside.\n\nThe scholarship is open to graduating seniors from the above-mentioned high schools who plan to attend a four-year U.S. college or university in the fall. Scholarship applications and a list of other requirements may be obtained from the student’s school guidance or career counselor.\n\nThe completed application must be returned to the high school’s principal or counselor by Friday, March 4, 2022, for submission to the Silicon Valley REALTORS® Charitable Foundation. For further information, please contact Nina Yamaguchi at (408) 861-8822 or nyamaguchi@cbnorcal.com."
