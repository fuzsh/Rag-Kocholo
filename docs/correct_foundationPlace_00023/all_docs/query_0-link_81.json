        "text": "In 2021, the Fremont Union High School District launched our 1:1 laptop program. Although there were many challenges during the campus closures that began in Spring 2020, one of the highlights of distance learning was the adoption and implementation of a new learning management system, Schoology, as a digital curriculum platform and resource for all students. FUHSD built on this foundation by moving to a one-to-one laptop program in the 2021-22 school year.\n\n1:1 is an educational concept where every student has full time access to the same laptop or Chromebook for use both in the school environment and at home. Students can choose to bring a laptop or Chromebook (no tablets) from home that meets the requirements listed below, or they can checkout a Chromebook from the district.\n\nThe expectation will be that students will bring their device to each class every day. Through this program, teachers will be able to work with students in a variety of ways. Students will expand their sources of research, engage in meaningful real-work assignments, seek out legitimate digital information to solve real world problems, and collaborate with peers and teachers in new ways.\n\nAs a district, we want to make sure that we prepare students to be successful in the digital age by providing them with the tools, skills and knowledge necessary to prepare them for success in college and beyond, and we believe the one-to-one laptop program will help us continue to meet this goal."
