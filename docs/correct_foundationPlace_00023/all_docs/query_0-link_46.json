(Nasdaq: OPWV), the leading provider of open software products and services for the communications industry, and MontaVista Software Inc., the company powering the embedded revolution, today announced they will cooperate to further develop the emerging ecosystem around advanced Linux-based phones. Using integrated, portable software platforms to help manufacturers perfect the user experience, Openwave and MontaVista Software will continue to optimize Openwave Phone Suite Version 7 (V7) for MontaVista(R) Linux(R) Consumer Electronics Edition (CEE). Each company will begin co-marketing to bring a powerful, yet flexible, software solution for Linux-based phones to their respective customers immediately.\n\nSince September 2003, V7 has been tested against and is interoperable with MontaVista Linux CEE. CEE includes advanced features like Dynamic Power Management, rapid boot, execute-in-place and tight integration with supported hardware platforms. Leading phone manufacturers such as Motorola have already announced next-generation handsets and development efforts based on MontaVista Linux.\n\nToday, Openwave and MontaVista Software are working to bring together the security, control and rapid innovation of Linux with the mobile industry’s open standards. This agreement will permit operators and manufacturers to take charge of their software future by promoting greater understanding of the advantages of Linux and the role that integrated software environments play in ongoing service development. Openwave and MontaVista are cooperating to further integrate their respective solutions, allowing manufacturers to more efficiently manage the addition and integration of new service enabling software. The two companies also plan to work to drive the evolution of third party applications necessary to deliver complete Linux-based phones. Manufacturers and operators now have a clear path from today’s mass-market phones to high-function Linux phones that support an accelerating pace of operator service development.\n\n“We are excited to strengthen our relationship with Openwave to further enable the mobile Linux ecosystem,” said Sheila Baker, vice president, Marketing, MontaVista Software, Inc. “Both MontaVista Software and Openwave are proud to deliver best-in-class software designed to enhance the mobile phone experience and this agreement shows our commitment to do just that.”v\n\n“This announcement proves that we are committed to supporting the evolving needs of our customers as they develop high function phones,” said Rob Williams, general manager of client software group, Openwave. “Working with MontaVista, a leading provider of embedded Linux, allows us to take advantage of the rapid innovations in the Linux community.”\n\nOpenwave will demonstrate Openwave Phone Suite Version 7 (V7) and MontaVista Linux Consumer Electronics Edition (CEE) using a Texas Instruments Innovator (OMAP 1510) at CTIA. Come see us at the Openwave booth #1417 in Hall B2 throughout the show.\n\nAbout MontaVista Software Inc.\n\nMontaVista Software is a leading global supplier of systems software and development tools for intelligent connected devices and associated infrastructure.
