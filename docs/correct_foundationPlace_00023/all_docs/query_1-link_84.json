        "text": "In the Fremont Union High School District, we believe that all students can achieve at high levels, and are committed to the continuous improvement of our practice to ensure that students do so. We expect district and school leaders to continuously examine our policies and practices in light of our beliefs and commitments; and to work with schools to deploy resources and create the conditions under which each school, each staff member and every student will achieve at high levels.\n\nOne of the critical resources that we use sparingly and in a highly targeted manner, but which provides great impact when necessary, is our On-Call School/Neighborhood Resource Officer (SRO) program. For over 15 years, FUHSD has partnered with and provided financial support to both the City of Cupertino/Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Department and the City of Sunnyvale/Sunnyvale Public Safety for the appointment of SROs in an ongoing effort to maintain a safe environment and enhance support for schools located within the district. Our SROs provide various services to each of our five comprehensive high schools and our Educational Options programs, including crime prevention patrols, crime investigation, educational programs, traffic control and traffic enforcement for special events, and other law enforcement related functions. More significantly, the SRO provides a consistent, ongoing relationship between our local public safety partners and school administrators.\n\nWe have received many questions about the use of SROs on our school campuses due to the national conversations happening around policing. There are several models that schools across the nation choose to utilize:\n\n(1) On-Call School/Neighborhood Resource Officer (SRO) program: The model in place between FUHSD and both Sunnyvale Public Safety and the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department is quite different from the models described below. Each of these agencies assigns two to three officers to all the schools in the city and they split their time between assigned schools. They are not stationed at any one school. For example, in Cupertino there are approximately 20 schools including the high schools, middle schools and elementary schools. The two Sheriff's Deputies assigned as SROs in Cupertino spread their time as needed between those 20 schools.\n\n(2) School Police Officers/District Police Department: School district police officers with sworn authority that work for a specific school district. Examples of this type of structure can be found in the Los Angeles Unified Police Department, Oakland Unified Police Department or San Diego Unified Police Department. Most large colleges and universities such as Foothill-De Anza and San Jose State also have their own police forces. FUHSD does not use this model, but it is common in larger school districts.\n\n(3) On Site Neighborhood Resource Officers (NRO)/School Resource Officers (SRO): Sworn officers who are specifically selected to work with neighborhood communities and schools on a long-term basis. NROs/SROs are trained to provide three core functions: law enforcement, mentorship/counseling and education. In general, NROs/SROs are not specifically assigned to be enforcement officers, but instead to provide more proactive and long-term support to schools and communities as opposed to responding to individual or isolated incidents. In some school districts, one officer is assigned to a single school and that officer actually has an office on campus. Since the officer is on site for most of the day, they are sometimes viewed as a de-facto staff member. They are present for supervision during lunch and brunch if they are not involved in other matters. FUHSD does not use the on-site NRO/SRO model.\n\nEvery student deserves to feel safe and secure when attending school, and while we value the strong relationships we have built with both the Sheriff’s Office and Sunnyvale Public Safety, concerns have been raised by some individuals about the presence of SROs on our campuses. For that reason, we wanted to take the opportunity to respond to some Frequently Asked Questions about our SROS so that students, parents, staff and community members could better understand our SRO program and how it is utilized.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nBoard Study Session Presentation on SRO Program (Oct. 19, 2021)\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about our School Resource Officer (SRO) Program"
