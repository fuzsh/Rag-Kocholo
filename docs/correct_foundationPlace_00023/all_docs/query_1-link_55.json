He works as a technician at BMW of Mountain View and also as an indoor cycling instructor at the YMCA. His home is in Mountain View adjacent to Stevens Creek, but he became familiar with the trail when commuting to work from his previous home in Redwood City. He and his family really enjoy the outdoors. You will often find them on the Stevens Creek Trail cycling, scootering, skating, or skateboarding. Billy feels strongly about trail advocacy, and the benefit of trails for safe fun, exercise, and alternative commute options for ours and, especially, future generations. He joined the Board in 2006 to support the trail and its expansion, and to offset the opposition voiced by a few of his neighbors, whom he feels are mistaken in the belief that the trail is not beneficial to the neighborhood.\n\ntop\n\nJeannie Bruins: Board member 2008 - 2011\n\nJeannie Bruins is a south Los Altos resident. In 2006, she responded to the call for resident participation in Los Altos's Stevens Creek Trail Feasibility Study and ended up becoming co-chair of the Task Force. In 2008, she joined the board of Friends of Stevens Creek Trail. But Jeannie and her family's enjoyment of Stevens Creek Trail goes back much further. When her two sons were old enough for a \"long bike ride\", they would take Stevens Creek Trail out to Shoreline Park. Her older son later used the trail to commute to his internship at Microsoft. Jeannie looks forward to seeing the Stevens Creek Trail and Wildlife Corridor extend to the Los Altos border and on to Cupertino and, ultimately, achieve the complete vision established over 40 years ago.\n\ntop\n\nTom Cronin: Executive Director 2006 - 2007\n\nTom Cronin joined the Friends of Stevens Creek Trail as the Executive Director in July 2006 and served through September 2007. Previously he has served as an Organizational Consultant for Earthome - Hooked on Nature, Executive Director at Committee for Green Foothills, and Program Director at Foundation for Global Community. This all follows a long management career with Hewlett Packard that ended in 2002. Tom first discovered Stevens Creek Trail years ago and used it extensively for training for running races and marathons.\n\ntop\n\nTom Frankum: Board member 1997 - 2007\n\nTom Frankum had a long tenure with Friends of Stevens Creek Trail before moving south to San Diego. During his time, he served as President and was always eager to speak around town to any of the groups that might be interested, including the Rotary, Kiwanis, or Leadership groups. Tom was not alone in his volunteer work to support the Stevens Creek Trail, though. His wife, Jan, was usually along to help staff the Friends booth at Art and Wine festivals, trail work days or other events. Jan also served as the Head Volunteer coordinator of the Trailblazer Race for several years.\n\ntop\n\nShreyas Bharadwaj: Board member 2010 - 2012\n\nShreyas Bharadwaj currently attends Lynbrook High School in West San Jose, class of 2012. He enjoys photography, mountain biking, classic literature, and piano. In his free time he likes to listen to music & read. When he graduates from high school, Shreyas hopes to attend Johns Hopkins University, UCLA, or UC Berkeley and pursue a career in the medical field as a neurosurgeon.\n\ntop\n\nDeepa Kollipara: Associate Board member 2007 - 2010\n\nDeepa Kollipara joined the Friends of Stevens Creek Trail as an Associate Board Member in 2007 when she was a sophomore at Monta Vista High School. Her passion with biking and biology drew her to the Stevens Creek Trail. As time went on, she became more interested in the environment and began to volunteer at the Trailblazer race where she got acquainted with the Friends. Her goals are to make the trail more accessible to students and to promote the rich wildlife that is so essential to the trail. Also, she hopes to promote the trail and get it into the public eye of students and residents near the trail. In her free time she enjoys playing badminton, biking on the trail, volunteering, and tae kwon do.\n\ntop\n\nChris Lee: Associate Board member 2005 - 2007\n\nChristopher Lee was a high school junior at Monta Vista High School in Cupertino when he joined the board of The Friends of Stevens Creek Trail in 2005. Chris's passion for environmental biology and his desire to make a physical difference in the environmental world drew him to The Friends, and his position as an associate board member. In his spare time he enjoys riding his bike and hiking on and off the trail. Chris looks forward to the trail's extension into Cupertino, and hopes that trail brings the city as much gratification as it has brought to Mountain View.\n\ntop\n\nJoe Mitchner: Board member 2007\n\nJoe served on the Friends Board of Directors in 2007 and is still enthusiastic about the trail's potential for both recreational and commute uses. Following a finance career at Oracle, Hewlett-Packard, and Stanford University, he now serves as a volunteer in various capacities within the Mountain View Whisman School District and other communty organizations. He has lived in Mountain View since 1991 and is married with a son and twin daughters.\n\ntop\n\nDeepti Nanawati: Executive Assistant 2008\n\nDeepti's training in urban and environmental planning is what first drew her to the race in the summer of 2006. She was quickly drafted to help with the Trailblazer Race as a volunteer coordinator. Since October 2007, a new baby boy has been keeping Deepti and her husband busier than usual. In 2008, Deepti took on a staff position to help out the Executive Director in the office and with record keeping at meetings.\n\ntop"
