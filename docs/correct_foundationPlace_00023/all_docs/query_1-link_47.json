        "text": "Adrienne Kinsella is a representational artist utilizing both drawing and painting to explore the themes of her research. As a California native, specifically from the Los Angeles region, a continual pondering of the issue of place and access…and often access denied is a continual thread. Her work examines relationships between interior and exterior, with and without, as well as the ambiguity of what differentiates insiders from outsiders, whether expressed in the literal spaces we inhabit or the privacy of an ambiguous mental landscape. Strategically omitted elements within the work play upon these themes and allude to the issue of loss.\n\nKinsella’s paintings are rendered in oil, acknowledging the historical weight of this media yet simultaneously questioning this tradition through disjointed subject matter and occasionally rendering these works on paper. Her drawings are rendered on frosted mylar, a semi-transparent substrate that echoes recurring themes of transience and the dichotomies of public vs. private. Deeply concerned with the potential of narrative in artmaking, Kinsella utilizes representational imagery as a potential means of synergistic connection between artist and viewer.\n\nKinsella lives and works just outside of Los Angeles."
