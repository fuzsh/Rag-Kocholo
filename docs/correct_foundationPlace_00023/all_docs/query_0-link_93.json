        "text": "Edana Corona Hernandez, Middle College, Class of 2024\n\nEdana will be attending Santa Clara University, majoring in Biology\n\n\"Starting Junior year, I joined the Middle College community, unaware of the encompassing influence this program would have on me. Over the course of the last two years, I have become a member of a family, one that supports, cares, and motivates its members to flourish. Whether that meant being an active member of my classes, helping create a mentorship program for incoming students, or helping organize the yearbook, I have put my all into this program. To all the Freshmen who are overwhelmed by the amount of growth they are expected to have, I write to you: be yourself, inexplicably, and unrelentingly. Do not let others’ expectation dissuade you from exploring and finding who you are.\"\n\nYusuf Gadelrab, Lynbrook High School, Class of 2024\n\nYusuf will be attending San Jose State University, majoring in Computer Science and Math with a minor in Engineering\n\n\"Lynbrook was a very unique experience that offered countless opportunities and the greatest staff of all time. My advice to freshmen would be to keep an open mind and try to always make new friends. Don’t just stay with the same friend group the whole time. Moving made my high school years special and taught me a lot of different lessons and values, including adaptability and being open minded, especially in making friends.\"\n\nRachael Ding, Monta Vista High School, Class of 2024\n\nRachael will be attending Stanford University\n\n\"I am a part of all that I have met” - Alfred Tennyson. The best part of high school is the people you meet. I can’t count the numerous times I have been delighted, inspired, and encouraged by friends, classmates, teachers, and staff around me. If there is one thing I have learned from the serendipitous friendships I have made, it is that “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\"\n\nJustin Yu, Cupertino High School, Class of 2024\n\nJustin will be attending the University of California, Berkeley, majoring in Cognitive Science\n\n\"The vibrant community I found at Tino was what made my experience so enjoyable. Exploring different clubs and groups and being open with meeting new people infused excitement in every day. Spend the next four years exploring and discovering who you are. Instead of trying to fit the labels, expectations, and limitations that other people put on you, embrace your uniqueness and value. Don’t get caught in the echo chamber of what others say, but instead stay confident in your own abilities. Even if you may be going through a really difficult time, have faith that they’ll serve to help you grow and emerge a better person. And most of all, look to spread kindness and a smile!\"\n\nMelissa Monroy Reyes, Fremont High School, Class of 2024\n\nMelissa will be attending Cornell University, majoring in Architecture\n\n\"As you navigate the next four years at Fremont, remember to take a deep breath and savor these moments with your peers to experience feeling part of such a warm and welcoming community. My time at Fremont was made special by the community of caring and supportive individuals around me. Being part of such a wonderful community has made the ups and downs of high school worthwhile. Running races with my cross country and track team has been the most memorable experience by far. I learned the importance of not only commitment and hard work but also the value of friendships.\"\n\nGrace McGoran, Homestead High School, Class of 2024\n\nGrace will be attending Stanford University, double majoring in International Relations and a STEM major\n\n\"My four years at Homestead High School have been more wonderful than I could have ever imagined! The school events, classes, and extracurriculars have all been amazing, but most of all, the people are what makes Homestead special. Homestead is home to some of the most genuine, hardworking, funny, and kind people you will ever meet (both staff and students!). If I could give any advice to the incoming freshmen, it would be to cherish your family and friends. Try to show appreciation in as many ways as possible, because oftentimes we forget how blessed we are. I want to express my deepest gratitude toward the wonderful teachers who have inspired and guided me throughout my high school journey.\""
