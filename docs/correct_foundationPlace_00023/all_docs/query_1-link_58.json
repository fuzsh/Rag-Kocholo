        "text": "Elevated mortgage rates, high home prices and limited housing inventory are making the dream of homeownership difficult for Americans, National Association of REALTORS® Chief Economist Lawrence Yun told REALTORS® attending the “2023 NAR NXT The REALTOR® Experience” conference and expo in Anaheim last week.\n\nYun analyzed the current state of the U.S. residential real estate market and shared his 2024 outlook during the Residential Economic Issues and Trends Forum. He explained that high mortgage rates and low inventory have dominated 2023, and as a result, he predicts home sales will likely decline by 18% this year.\n\nThe housing shortage continues to be what’s edging up home prices, said Yun. “Lack of inventory is providing the support for high prices, but it’s also making it super difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.”\n\nFirst-time buyers face steep challenges. High rent, student and credit card debt, car loans, and childcare costs for those with children have made it difficult for many to save for a down payment.\n\nHigh interest rates have had a great impact on the U.S. overall economic performance, said Yun. While the latest GDP figure of 4.9% shows growth, he warned there are some worrying signs in the economy. Business spending is essentially flat. Goods inventory is rising, which means products are being produced but they are not getting sold.\n\n“We cannot keep adding to the shelves,” said Yun. “Just like in housing, businesses have to borrow money, and business spending is down because it’s more expensive to borrow.”\n\nYun said the jobs data is still positive, but each passing month shows diminishing strength. Based on the trendline, employment could become negative, which makes the upcoming GDP number looks to “worrisome.”\n\nYun noted that currently, the consumer price index (CPI) is much calmer, and with community banks suffering from high interest rates, the Fed should adjust its monetary tightening posture. In fact, the bond market appears to be reacting as if the Fed will be cutting interest rates next year.\n\n“I believe we’ve already reached the peak in terms of interest rates,” Yun said. “The question is when are rates going to come down?”\n\nYun projects mortgage rates will head towards 7% in a few months and into the 6% range by the spring of 2024. He also anticipates that more sellers will enter the market.\n\n“Builders are back on their feet, up 5% in newly constructed home sales year to date,” said Yun. “Builders can simply create inventory. In a housing shortage environment, builders are really benefiting.”\n\nOther numerous trends point to possible pent-up seller activity that could trigger much-needed inventory due to life changes. This would include growing families, couples marrying or divorcing and seniors. There are seven million newborn babies, three million marriages, and 1.5 million divorces. Seven million people will turn 65 years old and will be looking to downsize or relocate to live closer to their children and grandchildren. Additionally, four million deaths, four million net new jobs, 50 million job switches, are all reasons sellers will need to sell sooner than later. Yun added that international buyers have declined, but once they return to the market, there will be a boost in buying.\n\n“Pent-up sellers cannot wait any longer. People will begin to say, ‘life goes on,'” said Yun. “Listings will steadily show up, and new home sales will continue to do well. Existing home sales will rise by 15% next year.”\n\nNearly 12,000 NAR members and industry stakeholders from all 50 states, several U.S. territories and 40 countries attended last week’s NAR conference and expo. Representing the Silicon Valley Association of REALTORS® at the event were President Jim Hamilton and SILVAR NAR director Denise Welsh.\n\nThe 23rd annual Silicon Valley REALTORS® Scholars Program for graduating seniors from 18 public high schools in Silicon Valley is under way.

We see value in supporting our youth and investing in their future, especially at a time when their academic life has been much altered by the coronavirus pandemic,” said Nina Yamaguchi, chair of the scholars program of the Silicon Valley REALTORS® Charitable Foundation. “Our excellent educational institutions are a major reason why Silicon Valley is a top housing market.

According to the National Association of REALTORS® Community Aid and Real Estate (CARE) Report, the median annual value of REALTOR® association donations to communities doubled from $5,000 in 2018 to $10,000 in 2020. REALTORS® have responded to the pandemic by donating money or nonperishables to food banks, volunteering at such organizations, donating masks and protective gear, donating school meals to children, and providing stable and secure housing to those in need.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, members of the Silicon Valley Association of REALTORS® (SILVAR) have stepped up holiday giving online on the Peninsula and in the South Bay. “It is even more important to give this year because the pandemic has impacted thousands of families in Silicon Valley,” said Mary Kay Groth, president of the local REALTOR® association. “Since SILVAR’s five districts could not hold their traditional fundraising events live this year, our districts have partnered with non-profits in their service areas to brighten the holidays for families in need.”\n\nSILVAR’s Menlo Park-Atherton and Palo Alto districts are asking members to donate to LifeMoves, a non-profit that provides family, individual, veteran, community outreach services for those in need and finds shelter for the homeless in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. “So far, our districts have raised over $5,000 for LifeMoves during our meeting last week. After a tumultuous year like this, I think everyone is feeling extra gratitude for what we do have and want to help make a difference and impact in our community,” said Francesca Lampert, Menlo Park-Atherton District chair.\n\nTo donate, visit https://www.lifemoves.org/. Your donation will help give a gift to each of the 1,200 people the agency serves every day.\n\nSILVAR’s Los Altos-Mountain View District is donating to Community Services Agency, which provides vital social services for residents of Mountain View, Los Altos, and Los Altos Hills and serves as a safety net so families’ independence and self-reliance can be restored and maintained. Visit the CSA holiday donation site at https://www.csacares.org/donate/.\n\nCupertino-Sunnyvale District is promoting giving to Sunnyvale Community Services and West Valley Community Services.

Funds this year also went to scholarships for graduating seniors from public high schools in the region.\n\nThe Silicon Valley REALTORS® Charitable Foundation is a trust which makes grants available to organizations from donations by REALTORS® and affiliate members of the Silicon Valley Association of REALTORS® (SILVAR). In addition to voluntary contributions from members, grants are funded by proceeds from SILVAR’s district fundraisers. The Los Altos-Mountain View District annual pumpkin auction in October raised $5,500, which the district donated to the foundation. Net proceeds of $2,389.75 from the Los Gatos-Saratoga District’s annual bocce ball tournament were also donated to the foundation.\n\n“With rising home prices and rents, these are hard times for many residents. More people are being displaced and are homeless, poverty is on the rise in Silicon Valley. We thank our members for being so generous in supporting the foundation this year,” said Eileen Giorgi, president of the Silicon Valley REALTORS® Charitable Foundation. “With our members’ continued support and contributions to the communities where they work and live, we are thankful that we are able to continue our commitment to the welfare and prosperity of these communities.”\n\nThe 2018 grant recipients include Adolescent Counseling Services, which provides a network of skilled family therapists and support groups for teens and young adults in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties; East Palo Alto Kids Foundation, which promotes educational opportunities for students in East Palo Alto and eastern Menlo Park; Westwind 4-H Riding for the Handicapped, which provides children with disabilities the opportunity to have fun while improving their coordination and strengthening their muscles; Youth Community Service, which provides service learning and leadership activities to underserved students in East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Palo Alto; and Community Services Agency, which provides social services, such as emergency one-time rent and utility financial support, vouchers for clothing, eyeglasses, school supplies, food and more for residents of Mountain View, Los Altos and Los Altos Hills.\n\nSILVAR’s districts, through the Charitable Foundation, likewise made donations to local organizations in 2018. The Los Gatos-Saratoga District donated $6,835 and an additional $200 that it raised at the annual District pumpkin auction to the Family Giving Tree’s Operation Reindeer program for holiday gifts, including clothing essentials and food certificates, to needy families and seniors in the community. The Cupertino-Sunnyvale District presented $750 each to West Valley Community Services and Sunnyvale Community Services for their respective backpack programs for low-income students, and $1,250 to the Sunnyvale K9 Unit to provide necessary equipment, like vests for its police dogs.

This year, The John Tripp Silicon Valley REALTOR® Scholarship granted its second $500 award to veterans enrolled at Foothill and DeAnza colleges. In 2016, the foundation presented $25,000 to Foothill-De Anza Foundation, an auxiliary organization of the Foothill-De Anza Community Colleges District for the creation of the endowment. The late John Tripp was a veteran of the Korean War and past president of SILVAR and the Silicon Valley REALTORS® Charitable Foundation.\n\nThe month of October ushers in holiday festivities, beginning with Halloween. It is also the time when members of the Silicon Valley Association of REALTORS® (SILVAR) help make sure the holidays are brighter for families in the communities where they work and live.\n\nThis week SILVAR’s Los Gatos-Saratoga District topped last year’s proceeds at its annual Pumpkin Auction, raising $7,000 for the Family Giving Tree for Operation Reindeer. California Association of REALTORS® 2005 President and District Chair-elect Jim Hamilton was able to encourage members to be generous this year and think of the children.\n\n“Open your wallets, open your hearts. It’s for the kids,” said Hamilton.\n\nOperation Reindeer, now coordinated by the Family Giving Tree, is a program that distributes gifts, including food certificates, to needy families and seniors in the community during the holiday season. REALTORS® and affiliates of the Los Gatos-Saratoga District have supported the program for more than 20 years.\n\nToward the end of the auction, Jim Myrick shared his own experience of being grateful as a child for receiving presents through the program. After sharing his story, Myrick invited members to stand up and pledge $10 each and followed with a “Heads or Tails” fundraising game. The generous contributions from members and the pledge of brokers Brian Crane with Intero Real Estate Services, Doug Evans with Coldwell Banker and Mark von Kaenel with Keller Williams Bay Area Estates to double members’ pledges brought the auction to the $7,000 amount.\n\nREAD MORE AND SEE PHOTOS HERE\n\nIn Los Altos last Friday, SILVAR’s Los Altos-Mountain View District’s 6th Annual Pumpkin Auction did not disappoint members either.
