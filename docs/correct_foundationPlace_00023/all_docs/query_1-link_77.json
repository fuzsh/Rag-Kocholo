        "text": "The goal of the Fremont Union High Schools Foundation is to promote educational excellence and equity across our five high schools. We achieve this by raising funds and developing resources. When our students graduate, they are ready for the next step. Supported high schools include Monta Vista, Lynbrook, Homestead, Fremont and Cupertino.\n\nAn easy way to double your contribution is through employee giving programs. Many corporations match employee donations to our organization.\n\nIf you volunteer with us, your employer may also provide us with a grant as a way to recognize your ongoing support."
