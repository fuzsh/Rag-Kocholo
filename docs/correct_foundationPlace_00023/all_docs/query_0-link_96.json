        "text": "Leila Guerrero, Class of 2024\n\nLeila will be attending the University of San Francisco, majoring in Nursing\n\n\"Whether I was playing water polo for the first time or participating in our campus’ new Middle Eastern club, the Tino attitude towards trying new things pushed me to explore these activities I now love. My time as a tutor in the Terra Nova program gave me a sense of purpose and fulfillment, and Tino’s culture taught me that difficult classes can be the most rewarding if your outlook is one of positivity. Looking back on my high school experience, I am proud to say my greatest memories have come from the parts of my experience that were unplanned, and diving into the deep end of life has broadened my horizons.\"\n\nJustin Yu, Class of 2024\n\nJustin will be attending the University of California, Berkeley, majoring in Cognitive Science\n\n\"The vibrant community I found at Tino was what made my experience so enjoyable. Exploring different clubs and groups and being open with meeting new people infused excitement in every day. Spend the next four years exploring and discovering who you are. Instead of trying to fit the labels, expectations, and limitations that other people put on you, embrace your uniqueness and value. Don’t get caught in the echo chamber of what others say, but instead stay confident in your own abilities. Even if you may be going through a really difficult time, have faith that they’ll serve to help you grow and emerge a better person. And most of all, look to spread kindness and a smile!\""
