        "text": "What could be better than stuffing your face full of fresh crab, while helping out local high schools in the process?\n\nWell, that’s exactly what the organizers of the Fremont Union High School District’s annual Crab Feed had in mind when they started the event. Proceeds from the crab feed, hosted by the Fremont Union High Schools Foundation, go to support students and programs at all of the district’s five high schools.\n\nThis year’s edition takes place on April 6 from 5:30 to 8 p.m. in the gym at De Anza College, 21250 Stevens Creek Blvd., in Cupertino. Parking is free in the structure off of S. Stelling Road.\n\nThe event features an all-you-can-eat fresh crab meal, or an option for a vegetarian Indian dinner. There will also be live music and live and silent auctions for entertainment.\n\nFounded in 1983, the foundation is a nonprofit, public-benefit corporation serving Cupertino, Lynbrook, Fremont, Homestead and Monta Vista high schools, acting as the primary fundraising organization for the school district. Much of the foundation’s work relies heavily on parent and community contributions to fund district-wide programs.\n\nIn the past, community support has helped fund things such as engineering and robotics programs, state-of-the-art multimedia equipment and training, and School Loop, an online tool for students and parents to check daily homework, announcements and grades."
