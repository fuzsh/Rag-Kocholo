        "text": "At the start of the 2022-23 school year, the FUHSD Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) was reconvened to discuss strategies for stabilizing enrollment across all five comprehensive high schools beginning in the 2023-24 school year. The reconvened group was made up of five parents or community members from each high school area, a student from each school, the five principals, FEA representatives Jason Heskett and Bonnie Belshe and district staff.\n\nWhile declining enrollment continues to be an issue across the District, the problem has become most acute at Monta Vista High School. The CAC met over the course of five meetings, where they were given a great deal of information about the district’s operations, funding, enrollment data over time, course scheduling process and other critical topics to help them consider a variety of short-term solutions to bolster enrollment at MVHS.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the CAC made a recommendation to the Board of Trustees at the Dec. 6 Board meeting to approve a one-year transfer program that would allow for the transfer of approximately 30 students from the Homestead High School attendance area to MVHS. This program, which will be called the Monta Vista Supplemental School Assignment Program (MSSAP) will operate in a similar fashion to the Lynbrook Supplemental School Assignment Program (LSSAP) that has been in place for the last six years. It will have the same application process and deadlines, however, it will be open only to all incoming ninth grade students that live within the Homestead attendance area.\n\nThe CAC will continue to work together to study how the LSSAP and subsequently the MSSAP are working, while also looking at more long-term solutions for stabilizing enrollment.\n\nMore information about the MSSAP can be found on our Enrollment webpage.\n\nIn 2016, the FUHSD Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) was established to study the enrollment needs of FUHSD, with a focus on the declining enrollment of Lynbrook High School. The efforts of the committee resulted in the FUHSD Board of Trustees' approval of a plan to supplement Lynbrook's enrollment. Since that time, enrollment has continued to decline across FUHSD, with other campuses beginning to see the impacts of fewer students. For this reason, Superintendent Graham Clark decided to reconvene the CAC and continue the work of the group to discuss strategies for balancing enrollment across all five comprehensive high schools beginning in the 2023-24 school year. Strategies that may be considered by the reconvened CAC do not include school closure. An initial outcome of the CAC will be to provide a report to the Board of Trustees at the November 15 Board meeting to enable them to make decisions around enrollment for implementation in the 2023-24 school year.\n\nWhile many of the original CAC members will be continuing their service on the committee, applications from other individuals who were interested in joining the committee were solicited in August 2022. Applications were only solicited from individuals living within the Cupertino, Fremont, Homestead and Monta Vista boundary areas, in order to balance the committee membership. The original committee was formed with the highest number of members coming from the Lynbrook High School attendance area, as Lynbrook was most affected by the decline in enrollment at the time of the CAC's forming. For this reason, new applications were not accepted from the Lynbrook community, as the school remains well represented by a strong contingent of members who remain committed to this work. The final selection of new members will be determined in adherence to the goal of forming a committee that is representative of a variety of stakeholders throughout the Fremont Union High School District.\n\nThe Citizens Advisory Committee met on Tuesday, Dec. 19, for their second follow up meeting with FUHSD staff since the conclusion of the CAC’s initial activities in November 2016 and the passage of the Lynbrook Supplemental School Assignment Plan (LSSAP) by the Board on November 15, 2016. The purpose of the meeting was to review the results of the LSSAP for the current school year, determine a recommendation for the Board for the 2018-19 school year in regards to Lynbrook High School enrollment, discuss the need for a long-term plan and gain feedback about how effective communication with community members has been around the issue of enrollment and the work of the CAC. FUHSD staff, including Superintendent Polly Bove, Assistant Superintendent Trudy Gross, Director of Business Services Jason Crutchfield, Manager of Enrollment and Residency Julie Darwish and Principals Maria Jackson and Kami Tomberlain, made a presentation to the group which covered the following topics:\n\nSummary of applicants and transfers under the LSSAP;\n\nEffects on the Lynbrook and Cupertino campuses and the students that chose to transfer; and\n\nCurrent enrollment numbers.\n\nDemographer Tom Williams also made a presentation on updated enrollment projections for the next five years (refer to page 14 in the presentation below).\n\nCAC members had the opportunity to ask questions throughout the presentation. Following the presentations, CAC members and staff discussed the enrollment data and possible solutions both in the short and long term. A proposal was made to recommend that the Board continue with the LSSAP for a period of up to two years, with a maximum of 90 student transfers per year, to provide time for the District and the CAC to examine potential long-term possibilities and solutions. The CAC members in attendance unanimously approved this proposal, and also made an agreement to continue to work together long-term on the issue of stabilizing enrollment. The CAC's recommendation will be brought to the Board of Trustees at the next regularly scheduled Board Meeting on Jan. 9. A second informational review meeting for the CAC members who were unable to attend the official Dec. 19 meeting was held on Jan. 4.\n\nUpdate on the Lynbrook Supplemental School Assignment Plan (LSSAP)\n\nMeeting Minutes - Dec. 19\n\nMeeting Minutes - Jan. 4\n\nThe Citizens Advisory Committee met on Wednesday, May 24, for their first follow up meeting with FUHSD staff since the conclusion of the CAC’s initial activities in November 2016 and the passage of the Lynbrook Supplemental School Assignment Plan (LSSAP) by the Board on November 15, 2016. FUHSD staff, including Assistant Superintendent Trudy Gross, Director of Business Services Jason Crutchfield, Manager of Enrollment and Residency Julie Darwish and Principals Maria Jackson and Kami Tomberlain, made a presentation to the group which covered the following topics:\n\nLSSAP resolution as passed by the Board in November;\n\nLSSAP application and enrollment goals;\n\nLSSAP communication plan;\n\nApplication results;\n\nConfirmed transfers by area and school, (also displayed on a map);\n\nEffects on students that have already transferred; and\n\nUpdated school enrollment projections for the coming school year.\n\nCAC members had the opportunity to ask questions throughout the presentation. There were questions on why some parents had chosen to withdraw their applications to Lynbrook, whether sibling transfers were locked in for the future and whether the latest enrollment projections were showing any different trends. Several members were also interested to know at what point the District might chose to look for a more permanent solution, specifically a boundary change. Staff shared that more time and data will be needed before beginning to think about a different solution. The committee members suggested that the next follow up meeting be held sometime shortly after the 40th day of school when the District’s enrollment numbers have stabilized, in order to have an accurate picture of what is happening at each site.\n\nUpdate on the Lynbrook Supplemental School Assignment Plan (LSSAP)\n\nMeeting Minutes\n\nOn October 12, the CAC met for the ninth time to finalize the committee’s recommendations to the Superintendent and Board of Trustees. During the last CAC meeting, committee members had a long discussion about possible future need for more definitive solutions to the problem of declining enrollment at Lynbrook High School in the CAC’s final recommendations. Committee members were presented with three different language options by facilitator Minh Le. They then discussed edits and changes to these options, and committee members were given the opportunity to advocate for their preferred option. Committee members subsequently voted on the three language options, but were divided between the three choices (Language Option 1 received 11 votes, Language Option 2 received 11 votes, and Language Option 3 received 8 votes). Mr. Le suggested to the group that a consensus on this additional language was not required, and that all three language options would be incorporated in the final report to the Superintendent and Board of Trustees so that they would be aware of the full range of sentiments from the committee about this question.\n\nThe committee then discussed the creation of a Communications Subcommittee. CAC members nominated and subsequently elected seven CAC members. Several additional nominations were made, but those individuals declined. The seven-member subcommittee is tasked with relaying information to the community at large and presenting the CAC’s final report to the Superintendent and Board at a special study session on Wednesday, Nov. 9. At the end of the meeting, Superintendent Polly Bove reviewed the logistics, timing and preparations that would be necessary for the subcommittee to follow in order to have the CAC’s final report ready for the Nov. 9 Board study session.\n\nMeeting Minutes\n\nThe eighth meeting of the CAC provided an opportunity for committee members to submit proposals for a solution to the Lynbrook High School enrollment issue, to advocate for those proposals and vote upon them. Facilitator Minh Le set an ambitious goal for committee members, to achieve a consensus with at least 80% majority vote in recommending an enrollment stabilizing solution. Following the nomination of 8 separate proposals, the committee went through three rounds of voting. Before each vote, committee members were invited to briefly advocate for their preferred proposal. The results of the final round of voting indicated that 76% of the committee supported what was named Proposal A, which was a combination of the following enrollment stabilizing options: Option 7G (All 8th Graders at Miller Middle School have the option to choose to attend LHS), Option 8G (All 8th graders at McAuliffe Middle School have the option to choose to attend LHS) and Option 6 (All 8th Graders in the Hyde Middle School attendance area have the option to apply to attend LHS), with each option implemented concurrently. This did not reach the 80% threshold that the facilitator was looking for. However, together with another compromise solution, Proposal D, an 83% threshold was reached. Proposal D is made up of Option 6 (All 8th Graders in the Hyde Middle School attendance area have the option to apply to attend LHS), Option 7 (All 8th Graders in the Miller Middle School attendance area have the option to apply to attend LHS) and Option 8 (All 8th graders at McAuliffe Middle School have the option to apply to attend LHS). The next meeting of the CAC will be held on Oct. 12 at which time CAC members will finalize their recommendations regarding the longer term enrollment stabilization of LHS and determine how to present their recommendations to the Superintendent and the Board.\n\nMeeting Minutes\n\nThe sixth meeting of the CAC provided an opportunity for committee members to review and narrow down enrollment stabilizing options, while considering both practicality and reasonability. Committee facilitator Minh Le revisited some comments made by the district’s Enrollment Projection Consultant Tom Williams, regarding his belief that after the year 2020 a significant decline in enrollment could occur across the entire district. Minh reminded the committee that at this time, this is not yet an official forecast, and if and when that projection shows up within the 5-year forecast window, there will be plenty of time for planning and appropriate strategies to be developed to address that development if necessary. The committee subsequently discussed target setting for the attending enrollment at Lynbrook and arrived at consensus that 1850 is the ideal minimum attending enrollment at this time. Director of Business Services Jason Crutchfield provided a brief overview of class size ratios and the section allocation process, while Associate Superintendent Graham Clark gave a short presentation on the planned school and facilities improvements at Lynbrook from Measure K. The CAC members reviewed the methods available to the district for stabilizing enrollment and discussed the pros and cons of several of these methods. During the course of this discussion, Minh suggested that because community buy-in on a boundary change would be very difficult to achieve at this time, the committee might consider removing this method from consideration. Three CAC members were in disagreement with this motion. Minh recognized the objection from these three members and acknowledged that more discussion was desirable. At the close of the meeting, Minh asked committee members to think further about eliminating from consideration the most contentious “win-lose” methods in preparation for the next meeting of the CAC on Sept. 14.\n\nLynbrook Facilities Improvements Presentation\n\nMeeting Minutes\n\nThe fifth meeting of the FUHSD Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) provided an opportunity for the CAC’s Enrollment Projection Subcommittee to report out to the entire committee on their enrollment data analysis and key findings. This analysis was developed after several subcommittee meetings with internal and external subject matter experts to review and analyze the enrollment data. The subcommittee determined in their key findings that while near-term projections were more accurate than long-term projections and that the accuracy level was not completely uniform across all of the high schools, the best case scenario still indicates that there is a decline in enrollment at Lynbrook and a need to take measures to address this decline. The members of the subcommittee stated that they had verified the enrollment projection methodology and did not believe a second opinion to be necessary. The subcommittee included in their recommendations to the CAC that committee members think of enrollment projections as a range, rather than a single data point and to focus on a solution that would allow flexibility for long-term success.\n\nThe district’s enrollment projection consultant Tom Williams also made a presentation to the committee, which included information on enrollment trends throughout the Bay Area, the impact of both new housing and the cost of living/housing prices on student enrollment, trends in FUHSD enrollment over the last decade and data and trends from FUHSD’s two feeder districts – Sunnyvale School District and Cupertino Union School District. FUHSD staff provided information about enrollment and its effect on course options and the levels below which comprehensive education course options are compromised. Following the evening’s presentations, the CAC members were asked to state individual conclusions that suggested a high level of general agreement that more students are needed to boost enrollment at Lynbrook High School in order to maintain a comprehensive high school experience and robust course offerings for all students.\n\nThe first five meetings of the CAC up to now have provided an opportunity for members to learn more about FUHSD, accountability requirements and the interdependence of enrollment, funding, staffing and course offerings. Beginning with the next meeting, the committee will begin to consider possible solutions to address the declining enrollment at Lynbrook High School.\n\nEnrollment Projection Subcommittee Presentation\n\nEnrollment Projection Consultant Presentation\n\nMeeting Minutes\n\nThe process for selecting members of the Citizens Advisory Committee has been thorough and unbiased, and the independent facilitator has worked to form a committee that is both diverse and representative of the community. To provide extra assurance that all aspects of this process are beyond reproach, all criteria established by the facilitator have been reviewed and approved by Judge John Flaherty, a retired judge with a history of successful arbitration, mediation, and dispute resolution and with no prior connection to FUHSD or the facilitator.\n\nBased upon this judicial review and approval, the following guidelines were established:\n\nThe CAC will have 35 members in order to have diversity of membership and to include more of the many highly qualified applicants.\n\nAfter looking at the ethnic composition of students from all five high schools, it was determined that approximately one-third of the committee members will be Caucasian and the rest will be Asian and other races. Because there were only two Hispanic and two African American applicants, the Judge agreed that these individuals should be invited to join the CAC to ensure representation from these under-represented groups.\n\nApproximately 40% of the CAC applicants were male and the rest were female. The percentage of male participants should be the same or higher.\n\nOf the 29 voting seats reserved for residents and parents from various FUHSD attendance areas, the following percentages would be used:\n\nLynbrook High School – 40%\n\nCupertino High School – 20%\n\nFremont High School – 20%\n\nHomestead High School – 12%\n\nMonta Vista High School – 8%\n\nBecause of their knowledge, experience, working relationships, and the ability to communicate to large numbers of their constituents, there will be a PTSA Council President from Cupertino High School and four PTSA Presidents (one from each of the four other high schools) invited to the CAC. The Judge agreed that because the PTSA Presidents were mostly Caucasian but brought a unique set of qualifications that were important to the success of the CAC, the percentage of Caucasians may go higher than one-third, but not to exceed 40%.\n\nThe president of the FUHSD teacher’s union will be a voting member who can speak for FUHSD teachers who are partners in the collective efforts to inspire, motivate, and educate FUHSD students.\n\nFive FUHSD students will share three CAC positions and participate in all CAC discussions but they will not be voting CAC members because they are not yet legal adults.\n\nTwo CAC members will be from the FUHSD administration with expertise and experience in District enrollment and school scheduling matters, but these will be non-voting positions.\n\nThe five criteria detailed in the fourth question in the ‘Questions and Answers About the Citizens Advisory Committee’ section are of primary importance in the application review process.\n\nUsing the above constraints, the CAC facilitator selected members of the CAC and communicated that acceptance via email to those chosen on May ­­­­10. On this date, CAC applicants who were not selected were also informed of that decision and the facilitator offered to continue to keep in communication with them by providing meeting updates and being available to answer questions or hear concerns."
