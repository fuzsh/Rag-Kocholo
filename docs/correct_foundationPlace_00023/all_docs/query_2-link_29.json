        "text": "Specialized Product and Broad Partner Ecosystem Enables Custom Device Solutions\n\nLAS VEGAS, NV. - Jan. 8, 2003 â MontaVista Software Inc., the company powering the embedded revolution, today announced a new push into the consumer electronics market with the introduction of the MontaVistaâ¢ Linux Consumer Electronics Edition 3.0, and the unveiling of an extensive ecosystem of strategic semiconductor, software application and middleware partners for complementary device solutions. This push represents a new aggressive strategy that will offer software developers a rich development environment especially optimized for Consumer Electronics. The company will also make available its rich Java development environment and state-of-the-art graphics tools to complete its strategic focus on meeting the needs of the Consumer Electronics market.\n\nâConsumer electronics products are evolving from simple, single function appliances into complex, network-connected devices,â said Stephen Balacco, embedded systems analyst at Venture Development Corporation. âThe expanded functionality of these products will increasingly require high performance hardware and a 32-bit robust multitasking operating system, such as Linux. Companies developing new consumer devices will benefit from MontaVista Linux Consumer Electronics Edition and the extensive MontaVista partner ecosystem inhabited by companies providing complementary components and solutions for next-generation consumer electronics products.â\n\nAs part of its comprehensive consumer electronics strategy, MontaVista today announced MontaVistaâ¢ Linux Consumer Electronics Edition 3.0 (CEE) â the first Linux operating system and cross-development environment specifically designed for consumer electronics applications. This new product â also part of the well known MontaVista Linux family of products â enhances Linux with dynamic power management, rich consumer-focused networking support and consumer-grade reliability.\n\nMontaVista Software is demonstrating a range of cutting-edge consumer products built on MontaVista Linux, from the worldâs leading Consumer Electronics companies in booth # 35179, in the Embedded Technologies Pavilion at the International Consumer Electronics Show, Jan 9-12, 2003 in the Las Vegas Convention Center.\n\nBroad and Robust Ecosystem\n\nMontaVista Software is partnering with a broad array of semiconductor, software application, middleware, and systems integration companies to provide solutions for device manufacturers in key markets including mobile and wireless, television and home entertainment, and automotive telematics.\n\nFor example, CEE will initially support the TIâs OMAP1510 and OMAP5910 processors and the IBM PowerPC 405LP processor with support for additional processing platforms to be added in the future. In addition, CEE will provide the foundation of solution stacks from software partners in key consumer electronics markets. The MontaVista Partner program already includes companies such as:\n\nAccess, Opera Software, Espial, Phoenix Technologies, Websoft\n\nInternational and Zentek for device web browsers\n\nBMR and MasterIA for Chinese fonts and input\n\nCodehost with rich printing support\n\nHughes Software Systems for VoIP and SIP stacks\n\nIBM for end-to-end device management and enterprise connectivity\n\nInterVideo for Linux-based DVD playing software\n\nIP Infusion for routing protocol stacks\n\nLiberate for Digital TV middleware\n\nMacrovision for digital rights and license management\n\nMasterIA for Korean fonts and input\n\nMovial for rich embedded Instant Communication software\n\nOmron Software for Japanese input\n\nOpen Interface for certified Bluetooth stacks\n\nProSyst for its open and scalable service delivery platform\n\nSolid Information Technology and PointBase for embedded databases\n\nTao Group for multimedia engines\n\nDozens of additional partnerships will be announced over the coming months that will enrich the ecosystem and continue to allow developers to choose from a wide array of components that have been validated with MontaVista Linux.\n\nâThese extensive collaborative efforts offer OEMs complete hardware software solutions, which will both speed time-to-market and lower total development costs for the next generation of consumer and home electronics devices,â said Sheila Baker, vice president, Marketing, MontaVista Software. âThese partnerships will help consumer electronics companies leverage a wealth of applications and meet the high productivity and low power requirements of new consumer devices with more complex functionality.â\n\nMore than 100 consumer electronics device companies are already using MontaVista Linux, developing products as varied as cell phones, PDAs, set-top boxes, Internet radios, residential gateways, automotive telematics and Karaoke machines. MontaVista Softwareâs current consumer electronics customer list includes Sony, Panasonic (Matsushita), NEC, and Toshiba America. Companies like Holland-based Zintec Holding and Araneo in Israel have also chosen MontaVista Linux for their digital television market products.\n\nImportant Consumer Electronics Developer Needs - Java and Graphics\n\nTo address the growing demand for embedded Java, MontaVista Software offers a Java runtime environment that addresses the needs of todayâs embedded applications. MontaVista provides a complete embedded Java developerâs package fully certified to the J2ME standard across all architectures supported by MontaVista Linux, delivering industry-leading features and performance to meet the requirements for Java enabled embedded systems. The single Java implementation delivered by MontaVista Software is based on the well-known WebSphere Studio products from IBM.\n\nDesigning graphics for the variety of embedded devices requires powerful tools, flexible graphics functionality and close integration with the architecture and platform being used. To address the growing demand by developers of consumer devices, MontaVista delivers a full graphics environment with state-of-the-art graphics tools and libraries to enable developers to create graphics solutions for a wide variety of products. Built with the best open source technology available today, MontaVista Graphics combines a diverse set of components into a single, fully tested and supported graphics development toolkit. MontaVista Software also offers Qt/Embedded built, tested and supported specifically for MontaVista Linux Professional Edition. Based on the popular Qt API Qt/Embedded provides a small-footprint implementation designed to meet the needs of the next generation of consumer devices.\n\nAbout MontaVista Software\n\nMontaVista Software is a leading global supplier of systems software for intelligent connected devices and associated infrastructure.
