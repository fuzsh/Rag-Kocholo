        "text": "From: Annette Oevermann <aoevermann@pacifico.com> To: <lwn@lwn.net> Subject: MontaVista Unveils First Consumer Electronics Linux Distribution Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2003 12:48:11 -0800\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE MontaVista Announces Industry¹s First Embedded Linux Platform Designed for Consumer Electronics Applications Specialized Product Boasts Dynamic Power Management, Rich Networking Support and Consumer-Grade Reliability International Consumer Electronics Show, Las Vegas, Jan. 8, 2003  MontaVista Software Inc., the company powering the embedded revolution, today announced MontaVista Linux® Consumer Electronics Edition 3.0  the first quality Linux operating system and cross-development environment specifically designed for consumer electronics applications such as mobile phones, digital televisions, set-top boxes and automotive telematics. ³MontaVista Linux Consumer Electronics Edition builds on our expertise in embedded Linux and our experience in the consumer electronics market,² said Jim Ready, president and CEO, MontaVista Software. ³The world¹s top four global consumer electronics companies are MontaVista customers. In addition, several global consumer electronics companies, including Sony, Panasonic (Matsushita), Toshiba America and Yamaha have taken equity positions in MontaVista, which demonstrates a strong validation of our vision for Linux-powered next-generation digital consumer products.² MontaVista Software is demonstrating a range of cutting-edge consumer products built on MontaVista Linux, from the world¹s leading Consumer Electronics companies in booth # 35179, in the Embedded Technologies Pavilion at the International Consumer Electronics Show in the Las Vegas Convention Center. MontaVista Linux Consumer Electronics Edition (CEE) enhances Linux with dynamic power management, rich consumer-focused networking support and consumer-grade reliability. It is designed specifically to address the needs of consumer electronics device manufacturers. CEE targets consumer device-specific processors and will initially support the TI OMAP 1510/5910 (and the associated Innovator Development Kit) and the IBM PowerPC 405LP (and the associated Arctic II Reference Board). Other processing platforms will be supported in the future. CEE forms the foundation of solution stacks from software partners in key mobile, home and automotive vertical markets. CEE is tailored to the demands of highly constrained mobile devices, which require low power consumption, restricted memory size, and short boot and resume times. In addition to the complete cross development environment that MontaVista provides with all of its three Linux Editions, CEE adds new developer tools for tuning system performance to enable higher quality end-user experiences. MontaVista Linux Consumer Electronics Edition, based on MontaVista-licensed as well as open source software, is application-compatible with and incorporates all the benefits of the MontaVista flagship systems software product, MontaVista Linux Professional Edition. CEE includes the fully preemptible MontaVista Linux kernel and real-time scheduling, small footprint targets and flash-based journaling file systems. ³MontaVista Software is an important partner and MontaVista Linux has been contributing to our Linux strategy. The fruits of our relationship with MontaVista Software can be seen in our products that we are recently bringing to market such as the Sony CoCoon Channel Server. We welcome MontaVista Linux Consumer Electronics Edition as a catalyst and enabler for next generation digital home electronic devices,² said Masao Hori, deputy president of Network & Software Technology Center, Sony Corporation. ³The introduction of MontaVista Linux Consumer Electronics Edition validates both our strategic investment in MontaVista and Matsushita¹s selection of MontaVista as a partner in building and deploying Linux-based digital consumer electronics devices,² said Ikuo Minakata, director of Core Software Development Center, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. (MEI). MontaVista CEE 3.0 incorporates dynamic power management features, file system enhancements and new tools to measure performance, system timing and memory size. CEE also features support for XIP (eXecute In Place) of the kernel and applications, as well as streaming media optimizations. It integrates with consumer market middleware such as the J2ME compatible WebSphere Micro Environment from IBM, and graphics packages such as QT/E from and MontaVista Graphics. CEE also supports a vast matrix of best-in-class application packages for consumer markets. (http://www.mvista.com/news/cee_strat.html) ³MontaVista Software has demonstrated its ability to deliver leading edge technology, stimulate product innovation and work hand-in-hand with its customers to enable industry-leading products. As the wireless industry migrates from simple voice-only phones to data-enabled browser phones that combine communications, mobile Internet access and computing power, we are relying on MontaVista to help us deliver Linux-based mobile phones to global markets,² said Seiji Mitsuoka, general manager, Mobile Terminals Software Development Division, NEC. ³The flexibility of the MontaVista Linux development platform will allow us to produce innovative mobile phone products with multi-media capabilities that provide a compelling experience for mobile users.² CEE features Linux Support Packages (LSPs) for key reference hardware platforms, with rich support of integrated peripherals with power management enabled for all drivers. CEE will eventually implement LSPs for a wide range of CPU targets being deployed in next generation products. More than 100 consumer electronics device companies are already using MontaVista Linux, developing products as varied as cell phones, PDAs, set-top boxes, Internet radios, residential gateways, automotive telematics and Karaoke machines. MontaVista Software¹s current consumer electronics customer list includes Sony, Panasonic (Matsushita), NEC, and Toshiba America. Companies like Holland-based Zintec Holding and Araneo in Israel have also chosen MontaVista Linux for their digital television market products. ³Our customers are increasingly turning to both the Linux operating environment and power efficient technologies for their applications,² said Lisa Su, director, PowerPC and emerging products, IBM Microelectronics. \"In satisfying those requirements, we've enjoyed a close working relationship with MontaVista Software, pairing their Linux offerings with our embedded PowerPC products. We believe MontaVista Software¹s announcement of MontaVista Linux Consumer Electronics Edition 3.0 offers additional, exciting opportunities for our customers.² ³Linux is becoming essential for many mobile and wireless applications because of its flexibility and ease of use. TI¹s wireless customers will benefit from the power management, file system and new tools of the newly launched MontaVista Linux Consumer Electronics Edition, which supports the industry-leading TI OMAP platform,² said Paul Werp, worldwide director of marketing for TI¹s OMAP Platform. ³MontaVista Software and Texas Instruments enable software developers to take advantage of the open and rich development environment of MontaVista Linux on the high-performance, power-efficient OMAP platform.² Availability MontaVista Linux Consumer Electronics Edition 3.0 will be available from MontaVista Software and the company¹s sales and distribution channels worldwide in the first quarter of 2003. It will provide customers with the MontaVista Linux kernel, software updates, deployment components, utilities, development tools, access to the MontaVista Zone, comprehensive technical support and access to hands-on Linux training classes.
