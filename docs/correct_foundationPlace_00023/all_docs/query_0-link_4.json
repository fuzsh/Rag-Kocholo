        "text": "CEO Jim Ready elected to board\n\nSUNNYVALE, Calif. - July 6, 2000 - MontaVista, Inc., developer of the Hard Hat™ Linux operating system for embedded applications, today affirmed the election of company CEO and president Jim Ready to the board of the Embedded Linux Consortium (ELC). Jim joins five other executives from the embedded Linux community on the board, which heads up the ELC membership of 89 companies, including IBM, Motorola, National Semiconductor, Red Hat, and others.\n\nJim Ready's embedded systems and Linux® credentials stand out even among the impressive array of recentlyelected ELC board members and the ELC membership at large. Jim is best known for founding Ready Systems, developers of VRTX, the first widelydeployed commercial real-time operating system (RTOS). In its twenty-year lifetime, VRTX formed the foundation for thousands of applications. VRTX was used in industrial control, instrumentation, networking, telecommunications, defense, and notably, mission-critical military and civilian aviation systems. It was the only RTOS ever to achieve FAA DO-178B flight certification.\n\nJim's association with Linux dates back to the early nineties, when he promoted the use of Linux within Ready Systems as an affordable cross development platform for embedded VRTX applications, anticipating the explosion of Linux for both desktop and embedded applications now underway. \"I am honored to serve the embedded Linux community and to promote Linux for embedded and pervasive applications,\" Jim Ready stated. \"As a founding member, MontaVista wholeheartedly supports the Consortium, and looks to the ELC as a vendor-neutral forum for advocating and accelerating the adoption of embedded Linux.\"\n\nAbout MontaVista Software, Inc.\n\nMontaVista Software Inc., founded in 1999 by real-time operating system pioneer James Ready, delivers open-source software solutions for the worldwide embedded software market. MontaVista's principal offering is the Linux operating system tailored for embedded software applications. MontaVista products include Hard Hat Linux, a standard off-the-shelf binary distribution of Linux for x86, PowerPC, StrongARM, MIPS and other microprocessor architectures. Hard Hat Linux offers developers a mix of open, standard APIs, and powerful open source solutions for embedded design -- including the MontaVista real-time scheduler and Hard Hat Net CompactPCI back-plane networking. Hard Hat Linux is supported by a comprehensive tool suite including optimizing compilers for C, C++ and other languages; high-level language debuggers; and performance monitoring tools. The company's Subscription Plans also provide Linux support, porting and customization services to customers worldwide.\n\nMontaVista headquarters are in Sunnyvale, Calif., in the heart of the Silicon Valley. For more information about Hard Hat Linux and MontaVista Software Inc., please call 408-328-9200 or visit the MontaVista web site www.hardhatlinux.com.\n\nAbout the Embedded Linux Consortium\n\nResponding to the rising tide of interest in Linux for embedded applications, representatives from dozens of technology firms formed the ELC, a vendor-neutral trade association dedicated to advancing the depth, breadth and speed of Linux adoption in the enormous embedded computer market. At last count, membership stood at 89. The ELC offers free membership to developers who demonstrate their participation in the Open Source code base of the Linux operating system. More details about the ELC are available at www.embedded-linux.org.\n\nLinux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds. Hard Hat is a trademark of MontaVista Software Inc.
