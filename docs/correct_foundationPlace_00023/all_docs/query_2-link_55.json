        "text": "Originally published in The Mercury News\n\nby Victoria Kezra\n\nA trial pitting the city of Sunnyvale against an alternative school over a zoning dispute has come to a close.\n\nThe trial wrapped up March 10 after four days of testimony before Judge James L. Stoelker. The judge has 90 days to decide whether Summit Public Schools: Denali will be able to continue operating on Mercury Drive in Sunnyvale.\n\nThe zoning dispute that landed the two parties in court dates back to March 2013, when Summit applied for a zoning change. The school rescinded its application in July. A month later the school opened on Mercury Drive, which is zoned for industrial business and prohibits businesses such as child care and schools."
