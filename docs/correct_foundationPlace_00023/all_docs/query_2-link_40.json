Bottom left to right: 2016 C.A.R. Region 9 Chair David Tonna, President’s Award Paul Cardus, President’s Award Brett Caviness\n\nAt the installation of the 2017 leadership of the Silicon Valley Association of REALTORS® (SILVAR) on Jan. 19, special recognition awards were given to members for their valuable contributions in 2016. Presenting the following awards were SILVAR 2016 President Karen Trolan and Executive Officer Paul Cardus.\n\n2016 REALTOR® of the Year: David Tonna (Alain Pinel Realtors, Los Gatos)\n\nA REALTOR® for almost 30 years, Trolan noted there is not a committee in which David Tonna has not served or chaired, from Lock Box Selection, MLS Advisory, PRDS Forms Advisory, Budget and Finance, the Legislative Committee, Education/Membership, Tour Policy and Sign Ordinance, Global Business Council, the Board of Directors and C.A.R. Region 9. Tonna helped found the Bay Area REALTOR® Leadership Academy (BARLA) and initiated SILVAR’s Ombudsman program. His service to communities includes RSVP, Little League Baseball, AYSO soccer, his local school board, and his church.\n\nTonna was also recognized for his work as the local trade association’s 2016 California Association of REALTORS® Region 9 Chair.\n\n2016 Affiliate of the Year: Eric Temple (Willow Glen Organics, San Jose)\n\nDescribing 2016 SILVAR Affiliate Chair Eric Temple, Trolan said, “He has proven to be a dedicated workhorse and a great ambassador for our Association.” In 2016, Temple was successful in bringing SILVAR’s affiliated professionals together so they could learn about their role, benefits and opportunities as members of SILVAR. Temple also spearheaded and worked hard to bring to his District other successful events and fundraisers, like bowling and the annual member ice cream social.\n\nSpirit of SILVAR: Nina Yamaguchi (Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage, Cupertino) As one of the leaders in real estate in Silicon Valley who began her real estate career over 40 years ago, Trolan noted Nina Yamaguchi to this day continually works behind the scenes for the success of the Association. Yamaguchi is a past president of SILVAR and was a longtime California Association of REALTORS® Director. Yamaguchi, who believes in giving back to the community, founded and chairs the Silicon Valley REALTORS® Charitable Foundation Scholars Program, a program that has been close to her heart for nearly two decades.\n\nUpon its 18th year this fall, the scholars program will have provided $324,000 to more than 300 students in Silicon Valley who have been recipients of the Silicon Valley REALTORS® Charitable Foundation Scholars Program.\n\nPresident’s Award:\n\nBrett Caviness (Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage, Menlo Park)\n\nPaul Cardus (SILVAR Executive Officer)\n\nThe President’s Award is presented at the discretion of the president to an individual who’s service to the Association is worthy of special thanks and recognition. Trolan presented the first President’s award to SILVAR Executive Officer Paul Cardus. She thanked him for the tremendous support and guidance he had given her in her role as president last year.\n\nTrolan presented the second President’s Award to Brett Caviness for his service as chair of the Menlo Park/Atherton District. She said as 2016 chair of the Menlo Park/Atherton District, Caviness, who is a new REALTOR®, worked hard to raise member attendance at the District’s monthly meetings by bringing in many interesting speakers. Caviness has also helped members be more in touch with technology, especially in the area of video marketing, with classes at SILVAR.\n\nNina Yamaguchi, managing broker with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Cupertino, shared prospecting tips with members at a recent Silicon Valley Association of REALTORS® Cupertino/Sunnyvale District tour meeting.\n\nYamaguchi said with market is changing. Inventory for the entry level market is tight and the luxury market is passed its peak. It is highly likely that the lack of inventory and a dip in sales because of it will continue.\n\n“With that framework, it is more important than ever to get listings,” stressed Yamaguchi.\n\nHere are some of her suggestions:\n\n1. Don’t ignore expired listings. Check with the former listing agent about the status of the expired listing. There also are many internet sites that help find people for a fee, such as beenverified.com, peoplefinders.com. intelius.com and theredx.com.\n\n2. Don’t ignore print. While online is popular, many people still like print, especially seniors. Silicon Valley has many senior residents. Advertise in the newspapers, send out Just Listed and Just Sold cards. Follow these up with a phone call or door knocking.\n\n3. Tap your sphere of influence – friends, family, former co-workers.\n\n4. Tap into your database of referrals and past clients.\n\n5. Door knock in neighborhoods where a home has just sold, or send out “missed opportunity” mailings. It may interest neighbors to know that the house on their street sold at a good price.\n\n6. Get with technology. Text a short video or a pre-listing presentation.\n\n7. Use social media and post on Facebook.\n\n8. Invite the neighbors to your open houses.\n\n9. Farm around your successes.\n\n10. Do the basics.\n\n“All the basics still work,” said Yamaguchi. “You need to be consistent and show up.”\n\nYamaguchi said her top farmers do everything consistently, from sending out mailers, advertising in the newspapers, maintaining a strong internet presence, door knocking, to holding open houses every weekend.\n\n“I’m a firm believer in open houses because they are a great way to get buyers and sellers,” said Yamaguchi.\n\nIn closing, Yamaguchi shared this quote from Nelson Mandela: “May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.”\n\n“If you are fearful, you are not going to get anywhere. If you follow your hopes you’ll be successful,” said Yamaguchi.\n\nThe 17th annual Silicon Valley REALTORS® Scholars Program for graduating seniors from 18 public high schools in Silicon Valley is under way.
