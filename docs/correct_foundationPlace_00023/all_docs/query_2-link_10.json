        "text": "Unique Human-Size Household Robot Developed on\n\nMontaVista Linux\n\nMitsubishi’s ‘wakamaru’ Makes its North American Debut\n\nEmbedded Systems Conference, San Francisco, April 22, 2003 — MontaVista Software, Inc., the company powering the embedded revolution, today announced that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (TSE: 7011) has chosen MontaVista® Linux® to power ‘wakamaru’, the first human-size robot that can function as a house sitter, and watch over or provide companionship to individuals.\n\nMontaVista Software is displaying and demonstrating this revolutionary robot in its\n\nBooth (# 2210) at the Embedded Systems Conference this week in San Francisco,\n\nat the Moscone Center.\n\n“We relied on MontaVista Linux as an operational foundation to design and develop this complicated and innovative robot. We built ‘wakamaru’ on MontaVista Linux because the sophisticated software base and its superior networking capabilities allowed us to focus on the complex programming that makes this new robot human-like,” said Ken Onishi, Engineering Manager, Robotics Group, New Products & Space Systems Department, Mitsubishi Heavy Industry, Ltd. “The robust operating system plays an important role in enabling ‘wakamaru’ to service a household 24 hours a day.”\n\n‘wakamaru’ features continuous access to the Internet and comes equipped with voice and face recognition capabilities that allow the robot to search for and follow voices, faces and movements. It has the ability to comprehend and interact with humans (such as discussing daily news it obtains via the Internet) based on an built-in dictionary and voice recognition, and can be programmed to call or e-mail a designated person, a hospital or security firm if it notices a problem. When connecting remotely to ‘wakamaru’ via its built-in camera-equipped mobile phone, users can see images of the house the robot serves and even communicate with family members at home.\n\n‘wakamaru’ is 3.3 feet tall and weighs 60 pounds. The battery-operated robot moves about on wheels and recharges itself when its batteries run low.\n\n“As electronic devices evolve into highly complex, intelligent, networked devices, the software supporting their rich functionality needs to be equally capable and robust,” said Jim Ready, CEO and president, MontaVista Software. “MontaVista Linux is a powerful systems software platform that meets these needs and helps to bring such advanced products to market more quickly. We are proud to support Mitsubishi and enable them to bring creative solutions such as ‘wakamaru’ quickly to market.”\n\nAvailability and Pricing\n\n‘wakamaru’, which promises to be an ideal help for elderly people, the disabled or others living independently, will be available in the Japanese market first, beginning in 2004, for about 1 million Yen (approximately US $14,250).\n\nAbout MontaVista Linux Professional Edition\n\nMontaVista® Linux® Professional Edition (Pro) is one of the most sophisticated embedded operating systems and development environments available. It supports a range of enhanced interactive features in advanced consumer electronics by providing high performance, real-time capability and the service reliability that consumers expect.\n\nPro boasts the industry’s most comprehensive support for embedded processor architectures, CPU boards and software components. It targets more than 25 processors from eight industry-leading architectures and supports more than 80 boards offering developers great freedom to choose the elements for their development environment, which in effect allows them to speed cutting-edge products to market faster and at a lower cost.\n\nAbout MontaVista Software\n\nMontaVista Software is a leading global supplier of systems software for intelligent connected devices and associated infrastructure.
