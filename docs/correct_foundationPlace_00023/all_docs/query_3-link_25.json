        "text": "Hi all,\n\nMy name is Kate Bianchi!\n\nI’m the Founder of Forest Playgroup Programs, as well as a passionate former nature school director and teacher, and forest preschool curriculum writer. I’ve served on the board of directors for the Forest School Foundation of Asheville, North Carolina and I’ve also lead numerous nature-based homeschool co-ops while living in Raleigh. I’m currently working on expanding my Forest Playgroup Programs as well as seeking approval to open a K-5 nature charter school in the state of Connecticut.\n\nFor those who are not familiar, I wanted to share the topic of forest school a bit more. Forest schooling is outdoor based education, usually in the woodlands or forest, and geared towards children. The purpose is that children reap the benefits of the outdoors while learning through a play-based approach at the same time (often times, they don’t even realize they’re learning!).\n\nNature-based schools and outdoor-based schools are also popping up and increasing in popularity as well as awareness! The benefits of all three types of education are often immense, helping children with motor skills and balance/coordination all the way down to social-emotional perks as well as providing immunity benefits. Most forest schools are geared towards children ages 3-6, but I’ve seen programs for babies & toddlers and their caregivers as well as for older children emerge lately as well, which is fantastic! Many nature-based and outdoor-based schools seem to go K-12th grade!\n\nThe forest school educational approach & movement originated in Scandinavia and has made its way through Europe and recently into the United States. Upon its growth, it has been touching many other parts of the world as well!\n\nOutdoor-based and nature-based schooling has followed suit and tend to model very similar approaches. As a quickly growing wholesome & nurturing educational movement with lifelong benefits, and with 900+ schools and programs on this list, I encourage you to check it out!\n\nBelow you’ll find a current list of forest schools, outdoor-based and nature-based schools throughout the United States. *This list will be updated semi-frequently!*\n\nIf you know of any additional schools or programs that are not listed, even if they are just starting up, please comment with a link to the school’s website as well as its name and location and I will gladly add it to the list! ❤️ Obtain information, share with others, network and enjoy! Let’s continue to spread the awareness of outdoor education as well as all of it’s astounding benefits!\n\nFor *tuition free* or low cost forest school/outdoor programs, check out organizations like Free Forest School and Forest School for All! For goal-based outdoor inspiration, check out the amazing 1,000 Hours Outside! For gorgeous outdoor inspiration, in-person and virtual groups, books, courses and an overall sense of well-needed support, check out Wild + Free, and for similar support check out one of my absolute favorite groups: Nicolette Sowder’s Wilder Child, her Wildschooling group as well as her Kids Moon Club! For non-forest “school” programs (just classes), check out Tinkergarten and TimberNook!\n\nI wanted to also give a shoutout to Green Schoolyards America for doing what they do! This awesome organization transforms asphalt-covered school grounds into green spaces in order to benefit the children as well as the earth.\n\nThe Forest Homeschool Presents:\n\nThe Ultimate List of Forest Schools, Outdoor-Based & Nature-Inspired Schools in the United States\n\n* = minimal to no tuition programs or schools\n\nAlabama\n\nCountry Day School of Huntsville\n\nMagnolia Nature School of Nauvoo\n\nAlabama Waldorf School of Birmingham\n\nNature Connect of Montrose\n\nFree Forest School* of Huntsville/Madison\n\nFree Forest School* of South Alabama\n\nFree Forest School* of Southeast Alabama\n\nWoodland Wonders Nature Preschool of Auburn\n\nLittle Mountain Forest School of Huntsville\n\nChild of the Wild of Mobile\n\nArkansas\n\nFerncliff Nature School of Little Rock\n\nThe Good Earth Learning Center of Austin\n\nFree Forest School* of Central Arkansas\n\nFree Forest School* of Northeast Arkansas\n\nFree Forest School* of Northwest Arkansas\n\nLake Nixon Outdoor Preschool of Little Rock\n\nSnails and Turkey Tails Farm & Forest School Co-Op of West Fork\n\nThe Decker School of North Little Rock\n\nAlaska\n\nAlaska Forest School of Anchorage\n\nTiny Trees Homer’s Forest School of Homer\n\nApple Blossoms Forest School of Anchorage\n\nBoreal Sun Charter School* of Fairbanks\n\nAnchorage Outdoor School of Anchorage\n\nWinterberry Charter School* of Anchorage\n\nAnchorage Waldorf School of Anchorage\n\nBirch Tree Charter School* of Palmer\n\nPalmer Lifeways of Palmer\n\nNettlewood Playgarden of Palmer\n\nAlaskan Seedlings Learning Center of Palmer\n\nFree Forest School* of Anchorage\n\nThe Folk School of Fairbanks\n\nEveryday Explorers: Early Learning Center of Cordova\n\nDeep Roots Forest School of Fairbanks\n\nSpruce Tree Montessori School of Fairbanks\n\nFairbanks Montessori School of Fairbanks\n\nKellogg F.I.E.L.D.
