Large disasters like hurricanes, floods and wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity, resulting in more displaced, vulnerable people who need support. ­­­­­­Since 2000, the Pacific Life Foundation has donated more than $4.1 million to support disaster response and preparedness efforts through the Red Cross.\n\nSince 2022, the Pacific Life Foundation is a proud member of the Red Cross Disaster Responder Program. By making an advanced contribution, the Pacific Life Foundation helps ensure the Red Cross is prepared to meet the needs of people affected by disasters big and small across the U.S."
