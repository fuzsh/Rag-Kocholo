        "text": "Nonprofits such as Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, university foundations, and over 40 other organizations were affected by a data breach, putting your information in danger. If you made a charitable donation to an organization in the past, please contact Keller Rohrback’s data privacy litigation team at (800) 776-6044 or [email protected] for a no-cost consultation.\n\nNonprofits and their donors want their efforts to go toward the greater good, not put them at risk. Contact us for help.\n\nOn February 7, 2020, Blackbaud—a technology provider used by nonprofits and other social good organizations—was breached by a hacker. The breach went undetected until May 14, when there was a suspicious log-in on an internal server. Despite becoming aware of the attack in May, Blackbaud did not notify users of its platform about the hack until July 16. While the cybercriminals were able to remove a copy of a subset of data from Blackbaud’s self-hosted environment, the organizations who fell victim to the attack remain unsure as to what data was stolen.\n\nSeveral of the organizations notified of the cyberattack are large, prominent ones, including:\n\nPlanned Parenthood\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)\n\nHuman Rights Watch\n\nNorthwest Immigration Rights Project\n\nGeorge W. Bush Presidential Center\n\nSeattle Children’s Hospital\n\nCentral Washington University (CWU Foundation)\n\nThe University of Puget Sound\n\nWestern Washington University (WWU Foundation)\n\nEvergreen State College Foundation\n\nWashington State University (WSU Foundation)\n\nFrench American School of Puget Sound\n\nFred Hutch\n\nHumane Society for Tacoma and Pierce County\n\nAuburn Valley Humane Society\n\nWenatchee Valley Humane Society\n\nThe Nature Conservancy\n\nSaint Luke’s Foundation\n\nVirginia Mason\n\nYMCA of Pierce and Kitsap Counties\n\nMarch of Dimes\n\nAmerican Heart Association\n\nNorthern Light Health Foundation\n\nWorld Vision\n\nSave the Children\n\nPartners in Health\n\nAmbrose University\n\nAuburn University Foundation\n\nBentley University\n\nDes Moines University\n\nEmerson College\n\nLouisiana Tech University Foundation\n\nMiddlebury College\n\nNew College of Florida\n\nRhode Island School of Design\n\nSt. Mary’s College of Maryland Foundation\n\nTexas Tech Foundation\n\nUniversity of Dayton\n\nUniversity of North Carolina System\n\nUniversity of North Florida\n\nVentura College Foundation\n\nWest Virginia University Foundation\n\nDirect Relief\n\nShelterBox USA\n\nDonor data was part of the breach, meaning that millions of donors nationwide are affected. If your organization or an organization to which you have donated uses Blackbaud’s software, please contact us at (800) 776-6044 or [email protected] for a no-cost consultation.\n\nAbout Keller Rohrback L.L.P.\n\nWith offices in Seattle, Phoenix, New York, Oakland, Santa Barbara, and Missoula, Keller Rohrback serves as lead and co-lead counsel in class actions throughout the country, including in the Facebook Consumer Privacy litigation. Our data privacy team is a pioneer in representing consumers, employees, and companies who have had their information breached, and we have a long track-record of success in this area, including the Ninth Circuit case Krottner v.
