If fundraising is at the heart of what you do and your current processes are inefficient, RE NXTâs features might be the perfect solution.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWhat kind of organizations use Raiserâs Edge NXT?\n\nRaiser's Edge NXT was designed with fundraisers in mind. While itâs primarily used by nonprofits, it can be beneficial to any mission-driven organization that participates in fundraising. These organizations include but are not limited to:\n\nEducational institutions: Colleges, universities, and K-12 schools can leverage Raiser's Edge NXT to manage alumni relations and launch fundraising campaigns.\n\nArts and cultural organizations: Museums, theaters, galleries, and other arts and cultural institutions often rely on RE NXT to manage memberships, ticket sales, and fundraising activities.\n\nHealthcare organizations: Hospitals, medical research institutions, and healthcare foundations leverage Raiser's Edge NXT to maintain donor records, run fundraising campaigns, and support medical research initiatives.\n\nKeep in mind that, while Raiser's Edge NXT is well-suited to support most medium to large organizations with donor management needs, there are other products that might be a better fit. Weâll explore a few in the following section.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nHow does Raiserâs Edge NXT differ from other Blackbaud software?\n\nBefore committing to Raiserâs Edge, consider how this product fits in with the variety of other online fundraising and constituent relationship management solutions on the market. For instance, you might compare Raiserâs Edge NXT to the rest of the Blackbaud CRM product family, which includes:\n\neTapestry: Blackbaud eTapestry is a cloud-based donor management software designed to help small to medium-sized nonprofits that arenât quite ready for Raiserâs Edge NXT. With manageable pricing plans and simple, user-friendly tools, eTapestry is a good starter CRM for organizations that need to size up from basic spreadsheets.\n\nLuminate Online: Blackbaud Luminate Online is a fundraising and marketing automation solution that can help your nonprofit manage email campaigns, personalize donation forms, and host events. Plus, it can be integrated with RE NXT to provide a comprehensive view of your constituent data.\n\nBlackbaud CRM: Blackbaud CRM is a highly customizable and enterprise-level CRM solution, suitable for larger organizations with complex fundraising and constituent management needs. It offers robust features for managing donor relationships, major gifts, grants, events, memberships, and more.\n\nWhen evaluating various CRMs, prioritize scalability. The prospective software should accommodate your nonprofitâs growth and evolving needs without requiring a complete overhaul or migration to a new system. This is crucial for long-term efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâCan you customize Raiserâs Edge NXT?\n\nRaiser's Edge NXT does offer some customization options, but the extent of customization may be limited compared to other CRMs. Thatâs because RE NXT was designed to provide immediate impact through the features listed above.\n\nNevertheless, nonprofits can still customize their:\n\nConstituent records: Create custom fields within constituent records to capture and track unique information specific to your organization, such as donor preferences, volunteer history, or program participation.\n\nUser access and permissions: Configure user roles and permissions to control who has access to specific features and data within the system.\n\nCampaigns: Tailor campaign names, fundraising goals, and donor segments for a more personalized approach to generating revenue.\n\nWhile Raiser's Edge NXT provides these customization options, it's essential to consult with Blackbaud or a certified consultant to understand the specific customization capabilities and limitations of the software.\n\nâ\n\nDoes Raiserâs Edge NXT require training? While RE NXT features can be leveraged out-of-the-box and without extensive customization, it is recommended to train your staff to become proficient in the platform. Ongoing training can ensure that you maximize your ROI and get the most out of your platform.\n\nIf your nonprofit lacks the in-house expertise needed to lead training sessions, consider hiring an external consultant who specializes in Blackbaud products and can oversee:\n\nOnboarding: After making the switch to RE NXT, consultants will develop and deliver training programs to ensure everyone on your team understands how to use the CRM system effectively. These programs can include role-specific training sessions, hands-on tutorials, and nonprofit-wide courses.\n\nChange management: Consultants can assist in managing the organizational change that comes with implementing a new CRM system. For example, they may create a communication plan to explain the purpose of the investment, address staff concerns, and promote user adoption.\n\nTroubleshooting: As you implement the CRM, consultants can offer ongoing support, helping your team troubleshoot issues and adapt to software updates. In turn, the CRM will remain a valuable tool in your nonprofitâs technology stack.\n\nPerformance monitoring: Consultants will work with your nonprofit to establish key performance indicators (KPIs) related to CRM usage and track your progress toward those goals.\n\nNo matter how you go about training, make sure that by the end of the implementation process, your entire team feels confident leveraging RE NXT. Implement assessments to evaluate their knowledge and identify areas that require additional training.\n\nâ\n\nAbout The Author"
