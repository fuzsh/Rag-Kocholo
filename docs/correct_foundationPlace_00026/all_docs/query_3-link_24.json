        "text": "Who We Are\n\nSince 1987, The New York Women’s Foundation has advanced a dynamic philanthropic strategy based on the fundamental reality that, when women and gender-expansive people thrive, their families and communities also thrive. Our work is rooted in gender, racial, and economic justice, and The Foundation is among the largest women-led grantmaking organizations in the world.\n\nHow We Work\n\nEarly investment sets the stage for community leaders to flourish. Our philanthropic approach means engaging on day one and taking a chance on women-led strategies before others do. We trust our grantee partners know the solutions for their communities best. By breaking down barriers and facilitating conversations at the deepest level, The Foundation develops a nimble approach to continued support and sustaining forward progress.\n\nHow We Define Women\n\nWhen we say women, we unequivocally mean cis and trans women. As a gender justice funder, we are also inclusive of all other gender-oppressed individuals, including non-binary and gender-expansive people. We celebrate that our community includes a diverse spectrum of gender identities and expressions.\n\n1986\n\nGloria W. Miliken recruits Helen LaKelly Hunt, Joan Melber Warburg, Alice Cardona, Betty Terrell-Cruz and others to found a philanthropic organization to be run by women for women.\n\n2006\n\nOver 50 grantee partners are awarded $1.65 million. The Foundation launches the Circle of Sisters for Social Change to enable socially conscious women to harness their resources and networks to support social change philanthropy in NYC.\n\n2012\n\nThe Initiative Against Sex Trafficking of Minors is launched. Hillary Rodham Clinton, Founder Secretary of State, is honored with the Century Award at the Celebrating Women Breakfast. New York Women’s Foundation launches Hurricane Sandy Response and Recovery Fund.\n\n2014\n\nThe Foundation releases Blueprint for Investing in Women Age 60+, the first report from The Voices from The Field series.\n\n2015\n\nThe Foundation distributed $6 million to more than 90 grantee partners. The Foundation increased impact through Prosperity Together, a first of its kind partnership with 27 public U.S. women’s foundations and the Women’s Funding Network.\n\n2016\n\nThe NYC Fund for Girls and Young Women of Color distributes $2.1 million to 28 non-profit organizations throughout the five boroughs, all dedicated to cultivating the leadership and welfare of young women of color.\n\n2018\n\nThe Foundation launched The Fund to Support the Me Too Movement and the Justice Fund to address gender-based violence and to end mass incarceration and support alternatives that promote justice and safety.\n\n2019\n\nThe Foundation invested $700,000 in The Justice Fund, with a specific focus on the closure of Rikers Island and supporting local criminal justice reform.\n\n2020\n\nThe Foundation rapidly responded to the COVID-19 crisis and supported the movement for racial justice by launching the 2020 Resilience-NYC: COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, spearheading the Trust Black Women campaign, and deepening investments in grantee partners committed to racial justice."
