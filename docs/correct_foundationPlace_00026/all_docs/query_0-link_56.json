        "text": "Knowledge Base\n\nHome\n\nBlackbaud NetCommunity Setup\n\nThis article will help you connect to the Blackbaud NetCommunity form integration setup for configuring payments.\n\nA. Setup your Blackbaud NetCommunity Payment Form Page\n\nNote: This setup does not support test transactions.\n\nCreate a new BBNC Page:\n\nLogin to your BBNC account to get started\n\nCreate a new page\n\nAdd a donation form part to the page and ensure it is setup correctly\n\nSee Example:\n\nEnable “Support Multiple Designations”, this option should be able to be checked underneath where funds are added (In order to activate multiple designations there must be two or more funds in the list)Please Note: Even you plan on only using one Fund in your CF Initiative, you still need to have at least 2 Funds created in Blackbaud.\n\nCreate a new Unformatted Text Part to the page after the Designation Dropdown\n\nIn the New Part window, enter “Community Funded Payment” for the Part Name\n\nAdd a description (optional)\n\nAdd the following script tag to the unformatted text part: <script src=”https://payments.communityfunded.com/bb.js”></script>Important Notes:\n\n– It is very important that the script tag gets placed with straight-angled quotes. Sometimes when copying and pasting out of emails, they can get converted to curly quotes. When you place the script tag, please double-check to make sure the quotes don’t convert. Typographic (curly) quotes will cause the script to fail.\n\n– If you have previously placed a script tag that has empoweredby.communityfunded.com instead of the URL above, while it will still work as expected, we recommend that you update the URL on your existing payment forms.\n\nYou do not need to edit any of the other tabs (“properties, usage, targeting, etc”)\n\nClick Save\n\nSave all changes\n\nB. Connect Community Funded to your Blackbaud NetCommunity Payment Processor\n\nNavigate to your Community Funded (CF) account and visit your Initiative > Set Up > Payments > Processors > Use Blackbaud NetCommunity (BBNC).\n\nOn the BBNC form, enter in a Connection Name and Description for identification purposes.\n\nEnter in the following credential to the self-connect form:\n\nEnter your BBNC Payment FORM URL (after the script tag has been added) into the FORM URLfield. (See above to create your BBNC form and add script tag first!).\n\nSave Connection.\n\nC. Synchronize your Funds between Community Funded and BlackBaud NetCommunity\n\nBackground: When your donors visit your Community Funded initiative, add items to their cart and check out, they will be redirected to complete their transactions using your BBNC form. The Fund Designations must be synchronized between the two platforms in order for this “hand off” to be completed.\n\nImportant Notes: 1. Fund designations that are not setup with the exact same name in BBNC and Community Funded will result in errors. 2. Special characters in the Fund designations will result in errors. ex. -[]{}’-“!@#$%()=+, etc. 3. Other cannot be a fund designation, if you would like to have an ‘Other’ Fund, please use a name besides ‘other’.\n\nHow to keep your funds synchronized:\n\nWithin BlackBaud Net Community, add the fund designations to your payment form that plan to use with Community Funded\n\nSign in to Community Funded and navigate to the ORGANIZATION that will be connecting to BlackBaud Net Community\n\nGo to Organization >Setup>Payments>Funds>Fund Template (Figure A)\n\nAdd a new Fund Template text field called “Fund Designation” (Note: This must be spelled exactly. No extra spaces or incorrect capitalization)\n\nNavigate to the INITIATIVE where you will be connecting to a BlackBaud processor, and go to Setup>Payments>Funds\n\nFor each fund on your initiative, use the “Fund Designation” field attached to each fund to enter the exact same name that is displayed in your BlackBaud form’s dropdown menu (Figure B)\n\nOnce your funds are setup you can associate them to your stories\n\nFigure A: Setting up the Fund Designation Template Field at the Organization\n\nFigure B: Entering the Fund Designation name for each fund in your initiative, matching the spelling of your Black Baud dropdown list.\n\nD. Payment Processor Verification Steps\n\nOnce your payment processor is connected, you can confirm transactions are working by making a live transaction on the platform to verify the payment connection is configured correctly. Please Note: Blackbaud requires a minimum of $5.00 for transactions. Please set your minimum donation to $5.00 in your Donation Options in CF. Donation Options are located in you Initiative > Setup > Payments > Donation Options.\n\nE. Change BBNC Payment Processor\n\nYou can change your BBNC Payment Processor connection to a different payment form URL.\n\nIn order to change your BBNC connection, return to Initiative > Set Up > Payments > Processors > Blackbaud NetCommunity where you can CHANGE your BBNC payment configuration. Make sure you have created a new payment form url and added the script tag prior to making a change to the connection.\n\nEnter in a new connection name, description, and Payment Form URL to change your configuration and resume donations.\n\nF. Disconnect BBNC Payment Processor\n\nTo DISCONNECT your BBNC Payment Processor connection return to Initiative > Set Up > Payments > Processors > Blackbaud NetCommunity where you can DISCONNECT your BBNC payment configuration.\n\nOnce disconnected, your platform will no longer be able to accept donations until a new payment processor connection is configured."
