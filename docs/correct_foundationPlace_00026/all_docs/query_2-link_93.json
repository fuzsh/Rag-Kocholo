        "text": "Partner Spotlight\n\nThanks to Petco Love for supporting life-changing work at the Nebraska Humane Society. Their support enables the shelter to give dogs a second chance through our Molly Project. Kudos to Petco Love for helping pets and the people who love them!\n\nNHS also partners with Petco Love Lost to make reuniting lost pets easier using image recognition technology to search a national lost and found database.\n\n7,318\n\nANIMALS FOUND PERMANENT HOMES LAST YEAR.\n\nAdopt\n\nWho We Are\n\nThe Nebraska Humane Society is a private non-profit organization that rescues, rehabilitates and rehomes thousands of animals each year. We also provide animal control services to Omaha and Sarpy County. As an open entry shelter we take in all lost, abandoned, unwanted and mistreated pets who have nowhere else to go. We work to return the lost, heal the sick and whenever possible, adopt the homeless. Toward that end we treat diseases, set broken bones, stitch up wounds, spay or neuter, microchip, and offer behavior help for scared and unruly dogs. We also work to keep pets in homes by educating pet owners, providing training and free behavior help, and promoting responsible pet ownership. Read More Â»\n\n1,598\n\nSPECIALIZED SURGERIES PERFORMED AT THE NEBRASKA HUMANE SOCIETY.\n\nDonate\n\nWhere Your Money Goes\n\nThe Nebraska Humane Society is a private non-profit corporation that relies on private donations. We do not receive tax dollars, nor do we receive any portion of dues or donations paid to national animal welfare agencies. We rely on funding from individuals, corporations and foundations to support the cost of sheltering tens of thousands of animals annually, our animal medical program, animal care facilities, adoption counseling, pet training and our behavior modification program: The Molly Project. NHS also works to generate income through our adoption fees, our Animal Outfitters retail store and services such as training classes, humane education camps, and private pet cremations. With community support we can continue this lifesaving work."
