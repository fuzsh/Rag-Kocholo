        "text": "CHARLESTON, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 4, 2005--Blackbaud, Inc. (Nasdaq: BLKB), the leading provider of software and related services designed specifically for nonprofit organizations, announced today the launch of Application Hosting Services for the company's fundraising and Business Intelligence solutions.\n\nHow it works\n\nBlackbaud's Hosting Services provide a convenient, affordable alternative for nonprofits that would like to outsource the set up and management of the technology they rely on to run their operations. Application hosting allows nonprofits to access the solutions they choose via an encrypted Web browser session, while the actual software driving the applications resides on enterprise-class servers and is managed by Blackbaud at a secure data center facility. Blackbaud retains accountability for the entire platform, providing nonprofits a single point of contact for the complete solution - software, hardware, data protection, network, and security.\n\n\"We launched our Hosting Services to help nonprofits expand their technical capacity while staying focused on their missions,\" said Robert J. Sywolski, chief executive officer at Blackbaud, Inc. \"No one knows Blackbaud software better than we do, and we are pleased to be deploying that knowledge in a new way that helps nonprofits save money and increase capacity.\"\n\nOne nonprofit's challenge\n\nA division of Bethesda Ministries, Mission of Mercy is a Christian relief and development agency dedicated to helping meet the physical and spiritual needs of people in poverty-stricken areas of the world. Active in 21 countries on four continents, the organization manages an extensive sponsorship program where more than 22,000 sponsors fund relief for 33,000 children. Mission of Mercy needed a fundraising solution that could easily manage the complex details and relationships associated with sponsorships and enable the organization to report progress back to individual donors. The IT staff at Bethesda Ministries, which supports the use of technology by all divisions, also sought a solution that could be offered in a hosted environment and accessed by staff via the Web.\n\nTo this end, Mission of Mercy signed an agreement in June of 2004 to deploy a combination of software and services from Blackbaud including The Raiser's Edge(R) (for fundraising management), The Information Edge(TM) (for Business Intelligence) and application hosting.\n\n\"In Blackbaud, we found a vendor and business partner that exceeded our expectations. We wanted to work with a software delivery company that prioritized business process development as well as technology, had a clearly defined project delivery methodology, and was customer-driven. We were also looking for a company that could address Mission of Mercy's child sponsorship business model,\" said Henry Soto, chief information officer for Bethesda Ministries. \"Blackbaud Hosting Services takes care of optimizing our system so that we can stay focused on our ministry to children living in desperate circumstances. In the end, we're spending less of our technical and capital resources and working more efficiently.\"\n\nAbout Blackbaud, Inc.\n\nBlackbaud is the leading global provider of software and related services designed specifically for nonprofit organizations. More than 12,700 organizations - including the American Red Cross, Bowdoin College, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, the Detroit Zoological Society, Episcopal High School, Help the Aged, the New York Philharmonic and United Way of America - use Blackbaud products and consulting services for fundraising, financial management, business intelligence, and school administration.
