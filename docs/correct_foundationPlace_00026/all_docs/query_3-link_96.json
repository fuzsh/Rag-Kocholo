        "text": "To date, New York Scholars have won $480.3 million scholarship dollars from New York partner colleges and universities.\n\nHistory\n\nNew York is the birthplace of The Posse Foundation thanks to one student who said, “I never would’ve dropped out of college if I’d had my posse with me.” A generous grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation made Posse possible. Since then, Posse has grown into a national movement, with New York as its largest recruiting city.\n\nPosse is grateful to the teachers, counselors and community leaders of New York City, who help us identify incredible high school students. We especially thank our partner colleges and universities for their investments in the program and belief in the promise of Posse Scholars.\n\nNote: California Institute of the Arts recruits only students interested in majoring in the arts. As candidates advance through the selection process, an audition or portfolio will be required.\n\nNominate a Scholar\n\nPosse New York Staff\n\nMichell Tollinchi, Director\n\nMonica Bastos, Senior Career Program Specialist\n\nKaz Boschen, Program Director\n\nJezza Bull-Briones, Assistant to the Director\n\nPosey Cohen, Senior Trainer\n\nLinnea Drott, Program Coordinator\n\nRachelle Eason, Senior Trainer\n\nAndrew Garcia, Trainer\n\nAlexandra Gaynor, Senior Career Program Specialist\n\nMorgen Littlejohn, Senior Trainer\n\nPaloma Mallan, Trainer\n\nJahery Paulino, Trainer\n\nSerena Rodriguez, Trainer\n\nFatima Sacko, Program Director\n\nJameel Uddin, Program Coordinator\n\nJomar Velez, Trainer\n\nMichael Williams, Senior Trainer\n\nNew York Advisory Board\n\nSteve Gallucci, Global and U.S. Managing Partner, CFO Program, Deloitte LLP, Advisory Board Chair"
