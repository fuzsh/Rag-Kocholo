        "text": "Apply for Scholarships\n\nA crucial factor in the success of our PCC studies is in our ability to pay for a high-quality education – everything from tuition and fees, to books and supplies. Thanks to the continuing generosity of a wide range of donors, PCC students have many opportunities to achieve educational and career goals.\n\n**All Scholarship Payments from Fall 2023 have been forward to the Financial Aid Office.\n\nThe Spring 2024 Scholarship Cycle opens February 20.**\n\nWhile you can apply for scholarships in Blackbaud Award Management year round, two scholarship cycles make up the Academic Year. General Scholarships are available during the fall semester; while Academic Departments and Divisions offer their scholarships during the spring semester. Smaller pools of scholarship funds may be available during Winter Intersession and Summer, contingent upon funding.\n\nCreating your application in Blackbaud Award Management (our online scholarship system) each semester is a great way to be informed about scholarship opportunities and remain a contender for scholarship funds. You can get help with your application by attending a scholarship workshop or scheduling a virtual one-on-one meeting.\n\nThe PCC Foundation can only award scholarships or aid up to the student's level of unmet need as defined by federal guidelines (if you receive federal funding). If chosen to receive a scholarship, your scholarship award may vary depending on your unmet need, your application, and acceptance of other scholarships or financial aid, including student loans. All final scholarship awards will be determined solely by the student’s unmet need.\n\nIf you have received a scholarship and want to know next steps (when you'll receive your funds, how to complete the post-acceptance process, etc.), please review the following videos:\n\nPost Acceptance Process"
