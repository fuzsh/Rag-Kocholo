They are continuing to ramp up their efforts to maintain and expand abortion access in a post-Roe world.\n\nCurrent Grantee Partners If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice\n\nIf/When/How transforms the law and policy landscape through advocacy, support, and organizing so all people have the power to determine if, when, and how to define, create, and sustain families with dignity and to actualize sexual and reproductive wellbeing on their own terms.\n\nCurrent Grantee Partners Black Women’s Blueprint\n\nFounded by survivors for survivors, Black Women’s Blueprint is on a mission to provide services and spaces for healing, reconciliation, and human connection with the natural world. In 2020, the collective founded Restore Forward, a 300-acre reconciliation center and Holistic Living Lab offering intentional land stewardship, farming, healing, and educational workshops."
