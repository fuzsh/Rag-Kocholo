        "text": "Charleston, S.C. (December 20, 2004) – Blackbaud (Nasdaq: BLKB), the leading provider of software and related services designed specifically for nonprofit organizations, announced today that it has launched a new version of its online community solution aimed at helping nonprofits fully use the detailed donor information they maintain to target both their online and offline efforts.\n\nBlackbaud NetCommunity allows a nonprofit to establish an interactive online network that creates a connection between community members and the organization and provides the tools to foster a lifelong relationship. In addition to offering the email marketing and online-giving tools fundraisers need to succeed, the online community provides seamless integration with The Raiser’s Edge®, Blackbaud’s award-winning fundraising solution. This provides dynamic Web content based on individual preferences and histories and enriches the information maintained on each person. By integrating these two solutions, nonprofits are leveraging a single donor database, making the technology easier to maintain over time and minimizing the total cost of ownership to the organization.\n\n“Nonprofits have spent decades collecting data on individuals and carefully storing it in their fundraising solutions,” said Robert J. Sywolski, CEO of Blackbaud, Inc. “With Blackbaud NetCommunity, we are empowering fundraisers to not only use the Web to maintain truly interactive relationships with donors, but also to leverage every ounce of information housed in The Raiser’s Edge to dynamically enrich and target both their online and offline communications.”\n\nHow it works\n\nBlackbaud NetCommunity uses information stored in The Raiser’s Edge to deliver targeted content to online community members. For example, by accessing donors’ giving histories, the solution dynamically populates suggested giving levels on online donation forms, asking each person for an appropriately targeted amount.\n\nBecause nonprofits add hundreds of transactional details to The Raiser’s Edge each day – from gifts or pledges and notes from face-to-face meetings to donors’ interests and codes that track their attendance at events – each donor’s profile is continually changing, offering new information to be used to target content and appeals.\n\nWhat’s new\n\nWith the new version of Blackbaud NetCommunity, nonprofits can also take their Web-based communication efforts to a new level:\n\n– Posting Web logs (or “blogs”) to quickly and broadly share key staff members’ expertise and communicate effectively with donors, while sharing related information from news services using Really Simple Syndication (RSS) to motivate active participation online.\n\n– Polling stakeholders about key issues, capturing their opinions and increasing their level of engagement.\n\n– Offering discussion groups, cultivating strong bonds among individuals who share an interest in critical issues related to the organization’s mission.\n\n– Acquiring, managing and retaining members with easy-to-use content management tools that keep the Web site fresh and engaging.\n\n– Enabling online constituents to use self-service tools to update profiles, make donations and register for events, automatically sharing information with The Raiser’s Edge and eliminating the need to re-key data.\n\n“Leveraging the Internet is becoming increasingly important in the nonprofit environment,” said Sywolski. “In order for nonprofits to maximize their online efforts, it is absolutely critical that the intelligence stored in their core fundraising database live in the heart of the solution they use every day. Blackbaud is well recognized as the industry leader in the fundraising space with its core product, The Raisers Edge. And this latest major release of Blackbaud NetCommunity is consistent with our strategy of providing fully integrated solutions that address all the operational challenges nonprofits face today and into the future.”\n\nAbout Blackbaud, Inc.\n\nBlackbaud is the leading global provider of software and related services designed specifically for nonprofit organizations.
