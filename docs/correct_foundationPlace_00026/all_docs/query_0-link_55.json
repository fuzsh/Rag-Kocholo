        "text": "Implementing BBCRM for your nonprofit is a major undertaking, and you must have a strategy in place to ensure that your data is protected and the project stays on track. Keep the following key tips in mind when planning your implementation.\n\nCreate a Strategy for Implementation Before Investing\n\nYour implementation plan itself should discuss a number of aspects, including:\n\nWho will manage your data migration process? What is the timeline for migrating your data?\n\nWhat are your fundraising, marketing, and stewardship goals? Which features or customizations do you need to achieve them?\n\nAre there any aspects of your current CRM procedures that need to be addressed before you invest in the new solution? For example, do you need to conduct a data hygiene refresh before migrating your data?\n\nWill you need to build any integrations between your BBCRM instance and other tools to make the most of the solution?\n\nAnswer each of these questions before you invest in BBCRM and implement the solution. You should have a full strategy already outlined and simply need to act on it before you make any changes to your CRM (which is undoubtedly the most important piece of technology in your nonprofit’s hands).\n\nInvest in Blackbaud-Specific Consulting\n\nSome nonprofits have in-house CRM developers to help them migrate to the solution. If that’s not your organization, you will almost certainly need to invest in nonprofit technology consulting to manage the transition and beyond.\n\nWe recommend not only partnering with a consultant but specifically seeking a Blackbaud partner in particular.\n\nWhy work with a Blackbaud expert? For one, Blackbaud CRM doesn’t have an open API. In order to perform custom API integrations, you’ll need to work with Blackbaud or a third-party Blackbaud partner who can work with the Blackbaud API and develop the customizations you need.\n\nFurther, a Blackbaud expert will be familiar with the comprehensive CRM’s many capabilities (and how it can be expanded with other Blackbaud solutions) and therefore, they’ll be able to help you make the most of its tools. A general consultant may be able to help you get up and running with BBCRM, but a Blackbaud partner will be able to help you make the most of the solution.\n\nProvide Blackbaud CRM Training for Team Members\n\nAs we’ve already explained, Blackbaud CRM isn’t a get-up-and-go solution. Understanding the nuances of this platform takes time and effort, and more than likely, some guidance from Blackbaud experts. To get your staff up and running on Blackbaud CRM in as little time as possible, you should plan to participate in some form of software training. There are a number of routes your team can take to learn the ins and outs of Blackbaud CRM.\n\nWhether you opt to utilize Blackbaud’s training courses or work with a nonprofit consultant from start to finish, it’s important that every member of your staff who’ll be using Blackbaud CRM feels confident with the platform. If your team isn’t completely adept in the software, you’re more likely to run into user errors that could damage your data and leave you with greater problems later on.\n\nTo find the best options for your team, keep these strategies in mind:\n\nKnow your Blackbaud training resources. Your team can choose to partake in any (or all) of Blackbaud’s dedicated Blackbaud CRM training courses, read online manuals or the Blackbaud forums, or work with a nonprofit consultant to develop a custom training plan. Just make sure you’re aware of all of the resources available to you so that you can make the most informed decision about what’s best for your staff.\n\nUnderstand the level of training you’ll require. More than likely, your team will want as much training as possible to ensure full confidence in using Blackbaud CRM. However, there are multiple levels of training available, from one-off online videos to comprehensive in-person training from a consultant. Be sure that you have room in your team’s schedules and your nonprofit’s budget to account for all of the training you need.\n\nDevelop a training timeline. Training takes time, so implement a timeline with measurable goals along the way. That way, you’ll mitigate the risk of falling behind on necessary daily operations as your staff undergoes training.\n\nAre you considering investing in Blackbaud CRM?\n\nContact DNL OmniMedia to make the most of your new solution.\n\nBlackbaud Consulting for Nonprofits by Team DNL\n\nDNL OmniMedia is a certified Blackbaud partner.
