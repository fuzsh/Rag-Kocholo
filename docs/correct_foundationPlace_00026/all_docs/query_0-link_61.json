        "text": "Through our businesses and the Wells Fargo Foundation, we align our resources and expertise to make a positive impact in communities, address complex societal issues, and help build a more inclusive, sustainable future for all.\n\nWe provide grants to nonprofit organizations working to strengthen the resiliency of our communities and our planet with a focus on supporting nonprofits that strategically align with our funding priorities: financial health, housing affordability, small business growth, and sustainability.\n\nWe prioritize funding to activities and programs that have a broad reach and support the needs of underserved communities and advancing racial equity.\n\nIn the communities we serve, we primarily invest in nonprofit organizations aligned with our four focus areas: financial health, housing affordability, small business growth, and sustainability. We may consider grants to support other critical local needs and initiatives. Priority is placed on nonprofit programming supporting low- to moderate-income communities, addressing racial and social equity, and accelerating an inclusive economy. To explore how Wells Fargo is working with nonprofits in your community, view our interactive community impact map.\n\nNonprofit organizations that are interested in being considered for an invitation to apply for a Wells Fargo grant may register and submit a grant interest form.\n\nPart of what makes Wells Fargo's philanthropy program so robust is the generosity of our employees who multiply our community impact, locally and collectively. Each year, eligible employees receive 16 hours of paid volunteer time to give back to local communities where they live and work. Wells Fargo provides an innovative and comprehensive portfolio of volunteer opportunities that allows for employees across the globe to engage where and how they want.\n\nVolunteer groups: More than 100,000 employees actively participate in internal volunteering and employee resource groups, which engage with communities through employee volunteer opportunities and community support.\n\nGlobal Fellows Volunteer program: Our Global Fellows Program is a virtual volunteering initiative with the Grameen Foundation's Bankers without Borders®. This effort seeks to accelerate the social and economic progress of business and entrepreneurs in under-resourced communities around the world, while providing employees with an opportunity to develop leadership skills and enhance cultural competencies with international organizations addressing poverty.\n\nWells Fargo BuildsSM program: Thousands of employees have volunteered to build, renovate, paint, and repair affordable homes with low- and moderate-income families and individuals in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity International and Rebuilding Together.\n\nWorkplace giving: Wells Fargo encourages employees to contribute to the communities where they live and work. The company facilitates employee donations year-round and amplifies the donation impact through the Community Care Grants program. Through this program, employees can qualify for grants for giving and service activities, and then direct the funds to eligible charities of their choice."
