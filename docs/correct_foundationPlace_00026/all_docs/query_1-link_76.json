This includes financial contributions, product donations, in-kind services, and employee matching and volunteering.\n\nHowever, only a fraction of these companies take advantage of the additional benefits that come from adding a corporate foundation to their philanthropic efforts.\n\nWith the help of our friends at Foundation Source, we created this complete Corporate Foundations and Grant-Making toolkit to help you understand the benefits of adding foundations and grants to your corporate philanthropic efforts, along with the operational requirements necessary to implement these programs."
