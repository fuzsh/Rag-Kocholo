        "text": "Sam Caplan\n\nSam Caplan\n\nVice President of Social Impact at Submittable\n\nPublished Jan 30, 2019\n\nYesterday I co-hosted a discussion on the recent acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships taking place in nonprofit technology. My partners were Chad Berg– Deputy Director of IT at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Chantal Forster – Executive Director of the Technology Affinity Group. Here's my musings on the subject.\n\nJanuary has been a busy month in nonprofit tech. Blackbaud kicked off the new year by acquiring YourCause, a grants management and employee engagement software provider. Two weeks later, Salesforce.org purchased roundCorner, producer of grants management system foundationConnect. And last November, Microsoft released its Dynamics 365 Nonprofit Accelerator featuring partnerships with Blackbaud and Avanade.\n\nHere's my thoughts and predictions regarding these mergers and partnerships.\n\nCorporate grant makers and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) departments: rejoice! Everyone wants your business. Corporate grant making and 'employee engagement' (volunteerism and donations) is a super hot market. The sales cycle is short, pockets are deep, and the potential for recurring revenue is huge (all those employees!). Salesforce is aggressively pursuing this space via their Philanthropy Cloud, and foundationConnect fills a big gap in their offering. And Blackbaud hit a home run in acquiring YourCause – a terrific solution for employee engagement and grant making, chock full of smart people who know that space well. Look for Microsoft to add a grants management solution to better compete in this arena. Benevity and Cybergrants are both exceptionally strong players with considerable market share and plenty of subject matter expertise.\n\nWhat about private foundations? If you are looking to build on the salesforce platform, the acquisition of fC is a very positive development and you’ll benefit from their new focus on grants management. The application exchange should see a shot in the arm, too. But if you’re with another grants management system, I skeptically wonder if there will be a slow-down in feature development as the pursuit of CSR and corporate grant making starts to dominate development cycles and road maps.\n\nAnd speaking of other GMS vendors, I predict that we’ll soon see at least one or two mergers among the remaining players. There are some great companies servicing a lot of major foundations, corporate grant makers, NGO’s, and higher education. To go up against the big three I think these companies may need to quickly get together to remain competitive. A Fluxx/Benevity combination makes perfect sense by bringing together the leading private-foundation GMS and a company with a solid foothold in corporate giving/employee engagement. Same goes for SmartSimple/frontStream. And FluidReview should start looking at the dozen or so small to midsize GMS's and go dominate the mid-tier foundations.\n\nI love that Salesforce, Blackbaud, and Microsoft are so interested in the nonprofit sector. I predict that we'll continue to see technology bridge the divide between funders and nonprofits. A product like Fluxx's Grantseeker could create a new marketplace where nonprofits advertise their projects to hundreds of potential funders at once, transforming the grant making process into one where foundations compete to work with nonprofits, reversing the power dynamic and greatly reducing administrative burden. Imagine how Fluxx could scale Grantseeker with help and resources from a larger partner?\n\nSo many possibilities. What do you think will happen next? Are you excited for the future, or are you worried about the consolidation of the industry?
