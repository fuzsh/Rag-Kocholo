        "text": "The Blackbaud Institute, a research lab at Blackbaud, a provider of software for powering social impact, released new insights from Blackbaud’s philanthropic dataset in its 2023 Trends in Giving Spotlight.\n\nThe Blackbaud Institute gives social impact professionals data to understand broader industry trends, benchmark success and take fundraising to new levels. This new series of quarterly spotlights will draw from Blackbaud’s data and insights on charitable giving, nonprofit business operations, corporate social responsibility and more. The current spotlight provides a round-up of the charitable giving trends that defined 2023 and a look at the past five years, with tips on how organizations can make the most of this year.\n\n“Looking back at the past year in fundraising, the trend that jumps out is stability,” said Carrie Cobb, chief data officer, Blackbaud. “2023 can be seen as a bookend to a historic five-year story of charitable giving, with generosity remaining durable and today’s giving levels sustaining well above their pre-pandemic norms.”\n\nKey Findings:\n\nGiving remains resilient.\n\nFor average year-over-year changes normalized at the organization level, the 5-year compound annual growth rate of 1.79% illustrates a solid upward trend felt across the nonprofit sector, with giving at the average organization remaining well above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOnline Giving continues to make gains.\n\nThe percentage of charitable giving donated through online sources rose from almost 8% in 2022 to over 12% for the average organization in 2023.\n\nThis increase was felt across organization sizes and subsectors, but small organizations (revenue below $1M) lead the pack with nearly 17% of the average organization’s donations coming from online sources, and online giving as a whole increasing by 1.5% for the average organization.\n\nEnvironmental causes—a favorite for Millennials and Gen Z —saw a strong 2023.\n\nThe three subsectors in which the average organization saw the largest increases in charitable giving in 2023 were: Environmental Organizations (+3.8%), Animal Welfare Organizations (+1.4%) and Medical Research (+1.3%).\n\nThese are also top causes for Millennials and Gen Zers. As the percentage of giving from online sources rises, optimizing online donation forms will make giving easier for Millennial and Gen Z donors. Gen Z donors report using an organization’s website to donate at nearly twice the rate assumed by fundraising professionals.\n\nMore insights can be accessed in the full Blackbaud Institute Spotlight. All Blackbaud Institute resources are offered for free, as part of Blackbaud’s commitment to accelerating social impact.\n\nSource: Blackbaud\n\nThe preceding press release was provided by a company unaffiliated with NonProfit PRO.
