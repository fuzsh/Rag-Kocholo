        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The MetroHealth Foundation has been affected by the Blackbaud ransomware attack, but is assuring donors it did not keep financial or other sensitive information in the server.\n\nThe foundation wrote to donors that Blackbaud stored demographic and online philanthropic giving information on a small group of donors. MetroHealth notified donors of the attack Wednesday morning.\n\nThat echoes Blackbaud’s July statement, as the foundation assured donors that information such as social security numbers, bank information and credit card information was not taken. Other local institutions affected in the attack were the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, Holden Forests and Gardens, the Cuyahoga Community College Foundation and Kent State’s Division of Institutional Advancement.\n\nRelated: Northeast Ohio institutions react to Blackbaud ransomware attack\n\nBlackbaud, a global cloud software company, serves nonprofit organizations, universities, foundations, healthcare institutions and other organizations.\n\nThe company found in May that its system had been attacked, and it worked with independent forensics experts and law enforcement to stop the hacker. The hacker was booted from the system, but before they were locked out, they took a copy of data. Blackbaud paid the hacker the ransom, but also made sure the copy of data was destroyed.\n\n“Based on the nature of the incident, our research, and third party (including law enforcement) investigation, we have no reason to believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, was or will be misused; or will be disseminated or otherwise made available publicly,” the company wrote in its statement."
