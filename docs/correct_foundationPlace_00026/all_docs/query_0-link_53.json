        "text": "Charleston, S.C. (October 25, 2005) - Blackbaud, Inc. (Nasdaq: BLKB), the leading provider of software and related services designed specifically for nonprofit organizations, announced today that more than 1,100 attendees are gathered at the Charleston Area Convention Center for the company's sixth annual Conference on Philanthropy, which is officially sold out due to an unprecedented response. The event focuses on helping nonprofit professionals expand their knowledge of industry best practices and the critical role technology plays in helping organizations achieve their goals.\n\n\"This is consistently one of the best conferences I go to each year,\" said Ann Edmonds, vice president, knowledge management at YMCA of Greater Toronto, who is attending her fourth Blackbaud conference. \"Because of the variety of educational content, I walk away with practical innovations and tools that will help almost every staff member. Technology is a critical component of my role, and I am glad I can rely on Blackbaud's conference each year to find new and better ways to help our YMCA operate more efficiently.\"\n\nThe conference features keynote addresses from Bill Strickland, president and chief executive officer of Bidwell Training Center and the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild, and Robert J. Sywolski, chief executive officer of Blackbaud. A compelling and powerful storyteller, Strickland focused on how believing in people will drive miraculous results. June Bradham, founder and president of Corporate DevelopMint, also led a lively panel discussion of major donors from the Charleston area.\n\nA three-day event, attendees from a variety of organizations will participate in discussions with nonprofit industry experts on the critical issues facing nonprofits today and how technology can deliver improved results. More than 110 educational sessions will be offered in 10 tracks -development, financial management, executive management, Internet, prospecting and analysis, technology, The Raiser's Edge(r), and additional vertical-specific tracks. Topics include, but are not limited to, disaster recovery plans, accountability, legal issues in philanthropy, advocacy, Internet solutions, and planned giving.\n\n\"The response to this year's conference proves that more nonprofits are placing increased emphasis on technology and innovative solutions,\" said Sywolski, who also participated on the donor panel during Tuesday's general session. \"We are focused on delivering the content and experts needed to address the industry trends that are affecting nonprofits, and we are thrilled to have a great mix of attendees - executive, IT, development, and financial management professionals - all of whom understand that technology plays an integral role to their organizations' success.\"\n\nConference Central connects attendees\n\nNew to the event this year, Blackbaud used its Internet solution, Blackbaud(r) NetCommunity™ to host a Web site called Conference Central - an interactive online community created to help customers learn more about the event. Attendees were encouraged to use the site to find the latest information on conference happenings and interact with other participants and speakers via blogs and discussion groups. Portions of the conference, including presentations and pictures, will be archived on the site when the conference concludes.\n\nTo view Conference Central, please visit http://conferencecentral.blackbaud.com\n\nFor more information on Blackbaud's conferences, please visit http://conference.blackbaud.com.\n\nAbout Blackbaud, Inc.\n\nBlackbaud is the leading global provider of software and related services designed specifically for nonprofit organizations.
