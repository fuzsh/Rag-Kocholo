        "text": "Knowledge Base\n\nHome\n\nBlackBaud Online Express Setup\n\nThis article will help you connect to the Blackbaud Online Express form integration setup for configuring payments.\n\nA. Setup your Blackbaud Online Express Payment Form\n\nNote: This setup does not support test transactions.\n\nCreate a new Blackbaud Online Express Form:\n\nLogin to your Blackbaud account to get started\n\nCreate a new form and make sure the form has been setup properly.\n\nBy default, you’ll have fields for amount and designation dropdown menu. See example.\n\nNext, you’ll need to add the Payment Details section to capture credit card details on the form from the Get Started tab.\n\nYour payment form should now have the credit card fields present.\n\nCopy your code from the “That’s It” tab to your public donation page. (You need to create a web page to paste the code into the HTML for the web page.)\n\nNext, in order to tie this into Community Funded make sure to add the following script tag to your public donation page below the Online Express Embed Code on the page.\n\n<script src=”https://payments.communityfunded.com/bboe.js”></script>\n\nWe recommend using the “copy to clipboard” function found in the platform when you are connecting to the form.\n\nNote: It is very important that the script tag gets placed with straight-angled quotes. Sometimes when copying and pasting out of emails, they can get converted to curly quotes. When you place the script tag, please double-check to make sure the quotes don’t convert. Typographic (curly) quotes will cause the script to fail.\n\n10. You do not need to edit any of the other tabs (“properties, usage, targeting, etc”)\n\n11. Click Save.\n\nNote: If you have previously placed a script tag that has empoweredby.communityfunded.com instead of the URL above, while it will still work as expected, we recommend that you update the URL on your existing payment forms.\n\nB. Connect Community Funded to your Blackbaud Online Express Payment Processor\n\nNavigate to your Community Funded (CF) account and visit your Initiative > Set Up > Payments > Processors > Use Blackbaud Online Express.\n\nIn the configuration window, enter in a Connection Name and Description for identification purposes.\n\nEnter in the following credential to the self-connect form:\n\nEnter your Blackbaud Payment FORM URL (after the script tag has been added) into the FORM URLfield. (See above to create your Blackbaud form and add the script tag first!).\n\nSave Connection.\n\nC. Synchronize your Funds between Community Funded and BlackBaud Online Express\n\nBackground: When your donors visit your Community Funded initiative, add items to their cart and check out, they will be redirected to complete their transactions using your Blackbaud form. The Fund Designations must be synchronized between the two platforms in order for this “hand off” to be completed.\n\nImportant Notes: 1. Fund designations that are not setup with the exact same name in BBOLX and Community Funded will result in errors. 2. Special characters in the Fund designations will result in errors. ex. -[]{}’-“!@#$%()=+, etc.\n\nHow to keep your funds synchronized:\n\nWithin Blackbaud, add the fund designations to your payment form that plan to use with Community Funded\n\nSign in to Community Funded and navigate to the ORGANIZATION that will be connecting to Blackbaud Online Express\n\nGo to Organization >Setup>Payments>Funds>Fund Template (Figure A)\n\nAdd a new Fund Template text field called “Fund Designation” (Note: This must be spelled exactly. No extra spaces or incorrect capitalization)\n\nNavigate to the INITIATIVE where you will be connecting to a BlackBaud processor, and go to Setup>Payments>Funds\n\nFor each fund on your initiative, use the “Fund Designation” field attached to each fund to enter the exact same name that is displayed in your Blackbaud form’s dropdown menu (Figure B)\n\nOnce your funds are setup you can associate them to your stories\n\nFigure A: Setting up the Fund Designation Template Field at the Organization\n\nFigure B: Entering the Fund Designation name for each fund in your initiative, matching the spelling of your Black Baud dropdown list.\n\nD. Payment Processor Verification Steps\n\nOnce your payment processor is connected, you can confirm transactions are working by making a live transaction on the platform to verify the payment connection is configured correctly. Please Note: Blackbaud requires a minimum of $5.00 for transactions. Please set your minimum donation to $5.00 in your Donation Options in CF. Donation Options are located in you Initiative > Setup > Payments > Donation Options.\n\nE. Change Payment Processor\n\nYou can change your Payment Processor connection to a different payment form URL.\n\nIn order to change your connection, return to Initiative > Set Up > Payments > Processors > Blackbaud where you can CHANGE your payment configuration. Make sure you have created a new payment form url and added the script tag prior to making a change to the connection.\n\nEnter in a new connection name, description, and Payment Form URL to change your configuration and resume donations.\n\nF. Disconnect Payment Processor\n\nTo DISCONNECT your Payment Processor connection return to Initiative > Set Up > Payments > Processors > Blackbaud where you can DISCONNECT your payment configuration.\n\nOnce disconnected, your platform will no longer be able to accept donations until a new payment processor connection is configured."
