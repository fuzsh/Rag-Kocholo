        "text": "The New York City Foundation for Computer Science Education, also known as CSNYC, was launched in May of 2013 with a mission to bring computer science education to all of NYC’s 1.1 million students.\n\nEarly CSNYC initiatives included providing grants to professional development providers to empower NYC school teachers to bring CS content to their classrooms, and launching the “CSNYC Educators Meetup” now known as the NYC CSTA Chapter.\n\nIn 2015, CSNYC joined the NYC Department of Education and the Mayor’s office of NYC to launch Computer Science for All in New York City (CS4All NYC), a 10-year public/private initiative to bring computer science education to every New York City public school, representing 1.1 million students. By 2025, every NYC public school student in grades K-12 will receive a meaningful, high-quality CS learning experience at the elementary, middle, and high school levels.\n\nCS4All NYC is an equity initiative that focuses on female, black, and Latinx students. CS breaks down gender and racial barriers and paves the pathway to greater diversity and equality for tech jobs in the workplace. To learn more, please visit cs4all.nyc. If you are interested in supporting this initiative, please contact Jennifer Klopp, jennifer@gothamgives.org.\n\nBeginning in 2016, the organization expanded its focus to supporting the national CS education community, and changed its name to CSforALL to represent the full scope of the organization’s programs. In 2020, a new foundation, Gotham Gives, was established to focus on the NYC-based work including all the responsibilities related to CS4All NYC that CSNYC had managed."
