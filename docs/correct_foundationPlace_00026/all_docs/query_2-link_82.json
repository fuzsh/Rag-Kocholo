        "text": "Blackbaud is an important tool for nonprofits. It’s the leading fundraising and donor management software for nonprofit organizations, serving users in over 100 countries. Three of the most popular Blackbaud software products are\n\nRaiser’s Edge NXT for fundraising and donor management\n\nLuminate Online for online fundraising and marketing\n\nTeamRaiser for peer-to-peer fundraising\n\nWhile Blackbaud has solutions for nearly every use case, it’s not always the right fit for every nonprofit.\n\nFirst, Blackbaud is loaded with features, which often means it requires a lot of customization and can involve a steep learning curve. Second, Blackbaud offers no free trial, and its pricing may be too expensive for small nonprofits. For example, Blackbaud’s Raiser’s Edge product bundle starts at $5,000 for a single user, and pricing for individual features starts at $119 per feature per month.\n\nIf Blackbaud doesn’t seem like the right fit for your organization, then keep reading. In this article, we’ll identify some of the best alternatives to the various Blackbaud software products.\n\nBlackbaud alternatives for nonprofits\n\n1. Bloomerang\n\nBloomerang is a cloud-based donor management application and a great alternative to Blackbaud Raiser’s Edge.\n\nBloomerang’s features include a customer relationship management (CRM) system, an online donations system, email marketing, and reporting. And it offers an interactive dashboard, constituent timeline, and giving summary. Bloomerang also measures constituent engagement levels and provides donor generosity scores.\n\nBloomerang integrates natively with Mailchimp and QuickBooks and can integrate with other tools via Zapier. Pricing starts at $125 per month for 1000 contacts.\n\n2. DonorPerfect\n\nDonorPerfect is online fundraising software that allows nonprofits to track and manage annual appeals, crowdfunding, gifts, online donations, volunteers, and more.\n\nDonorPerfect is scalable and suitable for nonprofits of all sizes, from local to large international organizations. It includes a mobile app, customizable dashboards, and automated workflows. DonorPerfect pricing starts at $99 per month.\n\n3. Jotform\n\nJotform is a versatile form builder that you can use to manage various nonprofit activities. It’s the easiest way to start managing your records — without the learning curve of a full-featured tool.\n\nJotform allows you to create visually appealing forms to collect data or receive donations online. Some of the popular templates for nonprofits include volunteer registration forms, donation forms, and event management forms.\n\nYou’ll also be able to build your own donation app, no coding required. Just add the Donation Box element to collect donations with one of Jotform’s many payment gateways, add a donation goal progress bar, and set custom donation amounts. You can choose one of our app templates to get started, and you can easily share your app with donors through a link or QR code.\n\nJotform pricing starts at $39 per month (or $34 per month when billed annually). A 50 percent discount is available for nonprofits.\n\n4. NeonCRM\n\nNeonCRM is cloud-based nonprofit CRM software that helps you manage donors, plan events, and track volunteers. The software has built-in event and volunteer management functionality, online store capabilities, donor communication, one-click reporting, and automated receipts, making it a great alternative to Blackbaud’s Raiser’s Edge.\n\nNeon prices start at $99 per month. All plans allow for an unlimited number of users.\n\n5. Kindful\n\nIn addition to fundraising and donor management features, one of the selling points of Kindful is that it integrates with a lot of the tools your organization may already use, such as QuickBooks, Mailchimp, Eventbrite, Constant Contact, and Square, which makes it easier to import data from and export data to these tools.\n\nSince Kindful joined Bloomerang, its pricing starts from $125 per month for 1,000 contacts, unlimited users, and unlimited donation and crowdfunding pages.\n\n6. OneCause\n\nOneCause is mobile bidding and auction software that’s an alternative to Blackbaud’s TeamRaiser. The software is built for auctions, peer-to-peer fundraising, virtual fundraising, and event management for nonprofit organizations of all sizes. OneCause has a Text2Give function that makes it easier to collect mobile donations anywhere.\n\nOneCause offers three basic plans for five software products, from Auction and Events to Text2Give. Contact OneCause directly for pricing.\n\n7. Salesforce\n\nSalesforce needs no introduction as a for-profit CRM. However, Salesforce.org’s Nonprofit Cloud is specifically adapted for nonprofits and includes fundraising, program management, and marketing modules.\n\nSalesforce.org Nonprofit Cloud is suitable for nonprofits of all sizes. Salesforce offers a free trial of its Nonprofit Success Pack, which is a fully customized version of Nonprofit Cloud that focuses on constituent engagement and fundraising.\n\n8. Donately\n\nDonately has everything you need in a Blackbaud alternative. Its features include donation forms and pages, text messaging, peer-to-peer fundraising tools, integrations, and donor insights. Donation pages and forms are mobile-responsive for added convenience.\n\nWhat’s especially great about Donately is that it offers a free plan with a 4 percent platform fee, which is great for small nonprofits.\n\nFor additional features such as embeddable donation forms, advanced customization options, and team fundraising, paid plans start at $15 per month with a 3.5 percent platform fee when billed annually. There’s also an option to create a customized pricing plan for your organization.\n\n9. DonorSnap\n\nIf you’re looking for some extra bells and whistles on top of donor management features, then DonorSnap may be right for your organization. DonorSnap includes a robust CRM platform along with bonus features specifically for nonprofits, such as donor retention tools and marketing automations.\n\nThere also is an integration option with AuctionSnap if your nonprofit uses auctions to raise funds.\n\nDonorSnap offers five different paid plans. Pricing starts at $39 per month for up to 1,000 contacts. If your organization needs more than 30,000 contacts, you can contact DonorSnap to set up a custom plan.\n\n10. Donorbox\n\nDonorbox is an online donation platform that gives you access to the works: donation forms, fundraising pages, text-to-give capabilities, peer-to-peer fundraising features, and crowdfunding tools. What’s more is that Donorbox even provides a kiosk app, so you can easily collect cashless donations at events.\n\nDonorbox has three different plans. The Standard plan is free and starts with a 1.75 percent platform fee for basic functionality. Thanks to this, Donorbox is great for small nonprofits that just want the essentials. For additional features like Zapier integrations and analytics, the Pro plan is $139 per month with a 1.5 percent platform fee.\n\nChoosing the right software\n\nChoosing the right tool for your nonprofit depends on your organization’s unique needs. While Blackbaud is undoubtedly a powerful tool for nonprofits, other alternatives may be cheaper and easier to work with, depending on the needs of your organization.\n\nMany of the Blackbaud alternatives suggested above offer similar functionality and are designed to work out of the box. Many also offer a free trial or demo, so you can test out the software before committing."
