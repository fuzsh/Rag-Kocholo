It has its finger on the pulse of New York and listens to communities and local leaders, which is important to me.\n\nIt's gratifying to know that you can be remembered in a way that's meaningful and continues in perpetuity. It's good to be able to give back, and I know the other three members of my family would have smilingly agreed.\n\nWith The Trust, my wife and I will help make New York better for the next generation.\n\nI think it's important that we all contribute to our communities. I saw a Trust ad and was intrigued. The Trust makes it so easy to become an involved donor.\n\nWe want to make New York even better for our grandchildren. We feel we can do that best by having The Trust find solutions in the coming decades."
