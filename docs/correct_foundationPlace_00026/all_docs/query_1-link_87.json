BE the CAUSE helps to fund local, national, and international programs including scholarships, leadership development, education and much more. A portion of every donation that a donor makes goes back to their local chapter to support local programs.\n\nSee the latest BE the CAUSE FAQ.\n\nJump to the BE the CAUSE Toolkit.\n\nLearn About the Chapter Impact Campaign\n\nGrant Back Program: The AFP Foundation for Philanthropy works in partnership with AFP chapters throughout the United States to implement our cooperative annual fund campaign called BE the CAUSE. Every chapter receives between 15%-35% (based on mutually agreed high/low goals) of their BE the CAUSE dollars raised in the previous year. These funds are granted to the local AFP chapter thereby increasing the mission of the AFP Foundation for Philanthropy in local communities for educational programs, scholarships, and so much more. Please click here for the full information.\n\nHow the AFP Foundation for Philanthropy Helps Chapters with their BE the CAUSE Campaign:\n\nAnnual calling program provided in kind by Catapult Fundraising Inc.\n\nMatches: Blackbaud, as a partner of the Foundation for Philanthropy, offers a $10 match for every gift (not pledge) of $20 or more that is made towards BE the CAUSE at the AFP International Conference on Fundraising (ICON).\n\nLYBUNT: In the first quarter of the year, the AFP Foundation for Philanthropy sends a direct mail solicitation to donors who gave last year but not yet this year for the BE the CAUSE Campaign.\n\nChapter Impact Campaign: The AFP Foundation for Philanthropy asks AFP Chapters to consider a gift from their budget to support the fundraising profession. Chapters can designate a specific area of support or provide unrestricted funds for the Foundation to determine where the funds should be best directed. The areas of focus that the chapters can choose are:\n\n*A minimum gift of $50.\n\nLeadership Development – which includes AFP LEAD and developing specific programs for leadership development for the fundraising profession.\n\nIDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Access) – which includes diversity scholarships and also programs like the ongoing Women’s Impact Initiative.\n\nChamberlain Scholarships to help fundraising professionals attend the AFP International Conference on Fundraising.\n\nCapacity Building which allows the Foundation to use the funds where they are most needed.\n\nTo make an online gift with your chapter's card, please Click Here."
