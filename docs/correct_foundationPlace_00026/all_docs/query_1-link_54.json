        "text": "Sponsored by Blackbaud.\n\nDavid Hazeltine from Blackbaud shares the five criteria that will make or break the grantmaking experience in your organization. He covers five fundamental considerations for evaluating your incumbent and/or new vendor grantmaking technology vendor to keep your grantmaking heart beating. No matter what the size of the foundation, most agree that their technology keeps their office running like a clock. Those that are using their technology day in and day out are always interested in tips, tricks, and improvements from their vendor-partner solution that will save time, streamline processes, and heighten their impact and outcomes. Whether you are a foundation that’s had the benefit of grantmaking technology and services for years, or are perhaps a smaller organization that has not yet made the jump to tech, and are still managing business with spreadsheets and other low-tech, you’ll benefit from these technology evaluation rules that can and will save you and your colleagues potential headaches in the long run.\n\nThis webinar was sponsored by Blackbaud.\n\nSpeakers"
