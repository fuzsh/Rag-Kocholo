More recently, it has championed regenerative agriculture and worked to increase global and institutional access to nutritious, sustainably grown foods.\n\nEnding Energy Poverty\n\nCommitted to clean and equitable energy access, The Rockefeller Foundation supported development of early solar mini-grid prototypes in India, helped create the U.S. Energy Foundation, and spearheaded the launch of the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, whose mission is to reach one billion people with reliable, abundant, clean power.\n\nSpurring Creativity and Education\n\nFor over 60 years, The Rockefeller Foundation's Bellagio Center has stimulated interdisciplinary and cross-cultural exchanges to propel innovation and creativity. From its earliest days, the Foundation has fostered artists in every field, and funded historically Black colleges and universities."
