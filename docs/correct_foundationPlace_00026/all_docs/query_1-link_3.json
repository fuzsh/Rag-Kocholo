        "text": "Understanding Donors\n\nBroadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS uses Blackbaud Raiser’s Edge NXT to better understand donors. With Blackbaud’s flagship fundraising solution, the organization can see how donors first became engaged and then tailor future communications appropriately.\n\n“I use Blackbaud Raiser’s Edge NXT every day,” Cardillo said. “It’s so userfriendly, and it’s mobile. We can put notes in records on our way back to the office after a visit. Or if we need to look something up, we don’t have to be at our desks to do that.”\n\nBroadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS historically has relied on its iconic “red bucket” campaigns, in which actors make appeals from the stage after the curtain call, and audiences donate directly into the red buckets while exiting theaters. With Blackbaud as a partner, the connection to Broadway Cares/ Equity Fights AIDS doesn’t have to stop there.\n\n“A lot of people travel in to see Broadway shows and our events, so being able to understand who those people are, whether they have the capacity to give, or how to get them more engaged is key,” Cardillo said. “It’s critical to be able to look at who’s in attendance and know how to connect with them.”\n\nCardillo and her colleagues now tap into individual donors’ interests and segment appeals accordingly. Plus, with a dynamic database logging every interaction, staff changes don’t affect the continuity of messaging.\n\n“Blackbaud Raiser’s Edge NXT has been a game-changer for us,” Cardillo said. “It’s helped our entire team be better fundraisers. It has improved our relationships with our donors in feeling connected to the organization. It’s really made a difference.”\n\nSustaining an Organization\n\nAnticipating a growing need for support in the years ahead, Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS will rely on the people who believe in the organization’s mission to carry it forward. With the right solution in place, Cardillo and her team hope to grow their Angels Circle of annual giving donors.\n\n“Annual giving is one of our fastest-growing sources of revenue and something we know is beneficial to the sustainability and health of our organization,” Cardillo said. “When you have ups and downs in the economy, the audience appeals can fluctuate—so the more robust annual giving becomes, it’s not only going to deepen relationships but better sustain the organization.”\n\nBroadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS looks also to build its planned giving program. “We’re identifying who in our database is a long-time supporter and at an age where they’re looking at estate planning,” Cardillo said. “We can be more targeted than in previous years and better inform our supporters about the options available to continue to support our efforts.”\n\nThe organization intends to turn future fundraising into an even more donor-centric experience, where supporters feel understood, appreciated, and stewarded. Cardillo and her colleagues plan to harness the tools available to drive them forward with that objective in mind.\n\n“Technology is essential,” Cardillo said. “What we are able to understand about people, in terms of their interests and capacity to give, is transformative. It helps us to focus our energy so we are that much more effective in fundraising and, ultimately, in making a difference for those who are simply looking for a helping hand in times of need or crisis.”"
