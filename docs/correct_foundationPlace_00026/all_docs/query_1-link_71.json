        "text": "At AFP ICON This Week, Blackbaud Will Preview Technology Advancements for its Flagship Fundraising Software\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C., April 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Blackbaud (NASDAQ: BLKB), the leading provider of software for powering social impact, is pleased to continue its strategic partnership with the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP) and is delighted to be the presenting sponsor of the AFP ICON conference, which kicks off April 7 in Toronto.\n\nAFP ICON is the largest gathering of fundraising professionals in the world, attracting more than three thousand fundraising professionals each year. At this year's conference, Blackbaud will preview new capabilities for Blackbaud Raiser's Edge NXT®, giving a \"sneak peek\" at new fundraising AI for the software that powers the fundraising work of so many of the conference attendees – in advance of its upcoming Product Update Briefing, where even more updates will be shared.\n\nIn addition, Blackbaud will host five educational sessions at the conference on topics ranging from using AI to optimize fundraising workflows, to emerging trends in the charitable sector in Canada, AFP ICON's host country. The company will also partner with AFP on its Be the Cause Campaign, where Blackbaud will make a donation for the first 750 donors to the campaign.\n\n\"It's an honor to continue our ongoing partnership with AFP to advance effective and ethical fundraising around the world,\" said Catherine LaCour, chief marketing officer, Blackbaud. \"Through the provision of scholarships, leadership development opportunities, educational programs and insights, we hope to further equip and empower fundraisers in their missions to make the world better. While we're consistently connected with our customers and engaged in our support of AFP year-round, the energy of being together in person is something very special, and this gathering of the fundraising community is among the highlights in our year.\"\n\nBlackbaud has been a prominent supporter of AFP's inclusion, diversity, equity, and access (IDEA) efforts for the last several years to support leadership development within the fundraising community. Through the Blackbaud Development Fund, the AFP Foundation has been able to provide scholarships to fundraisers from underrepresented groups to attend events such as AFP LEAD, AFP's annual leadership conference, and AFP ICON. Blackbaud has also provided support for AFP's Emerging Leaders Mentor Program, which connects young professionals and those new to the profession with mentors to help develop leadership skills and create an inclusive and equitable future for the profession.\n\n\"Blackbaud's partnership has been invaluable as AFP has expanded our commitment to IDEA,\" said Chris Amos, senior director, business development for AFP. \"Their dedication to social impact is evident in their unwavering support of programs that advance ethical fundraising and equitable access to leadership opportunities. We're excited to welcome them back in 2024 as a Strategic Partner and the Presenting Sponsor of AFP ICON and AFP LEAD. All of us at AFP are pleased to continue to work with Blackbaud and look forward to the expertise they will provide in the year ahead.\"\n\nAFP ICON attendees can learn more by visiting Blackbaud's booth, #607 in the Exchange.\n\nAbout Blackbaud\n\nBlackbaud (NASDAQ: BLKB) is the leading software provider exclusively dedicated to powering social impact.
