Through all the learning, exploring and dreaming big, students develop confidence in themselves because they are known, supported, challenged and inspired to succeed.\n\nAs a member of the Church Schools in the Diocese of Virginia, our foundation and our mission are rooted firmly in the tenets of our Episcopal identity. We welcome all faiths, and we are called to love one another and honor one another for who God has made each of us.\n\nOur Episcopal identity reaches all corners of our community and our work, informing our programs, inspiring our students to serve, and ensuring that each member of the Saints community can find here a place they can be exactly who they are. Our work in environmental stewardship, community engagement, and diversity and equity are rooted in our Episcopal foundation."
