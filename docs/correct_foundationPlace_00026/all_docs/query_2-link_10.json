        "text": "Global Goals Mapping is a comprehensive resource list that maps giving and volunteerism using both the IRS National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) codes and the United Nations International Classification of Nonprofit Organizations (ICNPO) codes to classify the activity and programs of charities and connect them to the SDGs and related targets. It creates a shared alignment resource and common language to support all organizations across sectors in their efforts to map their contributions toward the SDGs.\n\n\"Global Goals Mapping will enhance the impact of efforts across an organization by understanding the alignment of individual employee donations, volunteer hours and grants,\" stated Scott Jackson, president and CEO of Global Impact. \"By bringing four like-minded and highly respected organizations together in partnership, we can encourage, support, and drive strategic philanthropy for the social good community. Our hope is it will help organizations tell their complete story and illustrate their commitment to the SDGs.\"\n\nGlobal Impact, whose mission is to build partnerships and resources for the world's most vulnerable people, will utilize the mapping and other tools to turn corporate giving and employee engagement data into more powerful success stories. Through this partnership, Global Impact will be able to tie contributions to impacts, align corporate responsibility efforts across departments, and help companies and their employees better understand how their contributions are connected to a powerful, collective global agenda.\n\nBlackbaud, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLKB), the world's leading cloud software company powering social good, mapped the SDGs to the taxonomy of its Blackbaud Outcomes™ cloud solution. As the first solution to integrate this type of common outcomes measurement language, Blackbaud Outcomes empowers funders and nonprofits to truly understand the impact they are making.\n\nCouncil on Foundations, an active philanthropic network and nonprofit leadership association of grantmaking foundations and corporations, will use the tool and information to provide the opportunity, leadership and tools needed by organizations to expand, enhance and sustain their ability to advance the common good.\n\nFoundation Center, an innovative nonprofit and leading source of worldwide philanthropic data and research, will utilize Global Goals Mapping as part of a broader ecosystem of resources, which includes SDGFunders.org, to help funders and grantees better understand the SDGs.\n\nThe SDGs are a set of 17 interconnected global goals devoted to addressing hunger, poverty, health, equality, peace, justice and more that strive to \"leave no one behind.\" Adopted in 2015 by 193 countries, including the United States, they serve as a call to action to governments, the private sector, foundations, nonprofits and individual change agents to make significant improvements in life, on land and under water by 2030. The group's goal is to provide a shareable resource for the entire social good community to utilize in aligning their grantmaking with the 17 goals and additional related targets.\n\n\"We are proud of the collaborative work that went into creating this resource,\" said Kevin McDearis, chief products officer at Blackbaud. \"By incorporating the Global Goals taxonomy into our software, organizations can tell their success stories using statistics and results – all within a single frame of reference. With everyone speaking a common measurement language, we can begin to participate in a worldwide movement to lift up the collective social economy.\"\n\nAll four organizations will unite to promote Global Goals Mapping, and more broadly, the value of the SDGs as a framework through trainings, webinars and convenings. Based on their missions and expertise, each organization has been integrating the resource into its offerings with a goal of improving funders', companies' and other stakeholders' financial and human capital investments toward achieving the SDGs for a sustainable future.\n\nLearn more at www.blackbaud.com/GlobalGoalsMapping.\n\nAbout Global Impact\n\nGlobal Impact is a leader in growing global philanthropy.
