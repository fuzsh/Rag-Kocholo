        "text": "One of the most significant challenges every customer faces is the integration of data. From student imports, new donor and gift files, revenue updates, event registrations, interactions, and more, the need to quickly and reliably integrate data is ever-present.\n\nThe BrightVine Data Link is a powerful data integration tool designed specifically for non-profit organizations. It allows non-profits to streamline their data management processes and connect multiple data sources, such as email marketing platforms and fundraising systems, to improve their data quality and decision-making capabilities.\n\nData Security\n\nBrightVine Data Link (BVDL) Integration Engine is designed with security in mind. It utilizes Blackbaud CRM™ SDK (.NET, SQL) and is Cloud Certified by Blackbaud CRM™. The integration engine is fully embedded within Blackbaud CRM™, ensuring that your data never leaves your Blackbaud CRM™ environment.\n\n​\n\nTo maintain data security, all data is encrypted at rest within the Blackbaud CRM™ environment. API calls are performed using Blackbaud CRM™ business processes or CLR stored procedures within Blackbaud CRM™.\n\n​\n\nSecurity\n\nData Hygiene\n\nThe Data Link platform helps to manage data hygiene by providing several features that allow users to maintain clean and accurate data within their systems. Some of these features include:\n\nData Validation: Data Link uses a validation engine that automatically checks data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. This helps to ensure that the data entered into the system is valid and free from errors.\n\nData Cleansing: The platform also provides data cleansing functionality that helps to remove duplicate records, correct formatting errors, and standardize data across different sources. This helps to maintain consistency and accuracy across the system.\n\nData Enrichment: Data Link also offers data enrichment capabilities that allow users to enhance their data by adding missing information, such as demographic data, firmographic data, and more. This helps to improve the quality and completeness of the data.\n\nData Matching: The platform uses advanced algorithms to match data across different sources, including third-party data providers, to ensure that records are accurately linked together.\n\nAutomated Data Management: Data Link also includes automated data management features that help users to easily identify and resolve data quality issues, such as missing data or incorrect formatting.\n\nOverall, BrightVine's Data Link platform provides a comprehensive set of data hygiene tools and features that enable organizations to maintain clean, accurate, and complete data within their systems.\n\nHygiene\n\nAt A Glance\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\n​\n\nThe BVDL provides:\n\nIntegration with a broader range of data sources, including SQL, flat-files, APIs, and OData feeds.\n\nImproved data quality with automated data hygiene using Orchestrations, which can be run pre or post-processing, and custom business logic that can be used across some or all of your imports.\n\nAddress validation at the time of import to improve matching and reduce duplicate entries, with the ability to use custom duplicate matching logic for further enhancement.\n\nEnhanced performance, including importing large files and running multiple files simultaneously, and support for wildcards such as *.csv to process multiple files. To prevent duplicates, the FileWatcher tool tracks which files have been imported from other locations.\n\nRobust error handling allows individual items to fail without affecting the overall import process.\n\nSending data back to another system\n\nAdding custom fields and tables to your import\n\nIncreasing staff efficiency through smart exception handling that allows for more efficient data manipulation\n\nEliminating the need for manual file manipulation, as all data can stay within the same file without having to be split into constituent, revenue, or interaction categories\n\nReducing custom development time by allowing end-users to create orchestrations for data manipulation and clean-up\n\nImproving the exception handling workflow by managing exceptions row by row instead of batch by batch, and allowing you to manage all exceptions in the same place, regardless of the data type.\n\nSuperbowl Ad for University of Wisconsin\n\nWeatherTech founder and CEO David MacNeil's dog, Scout, was featured in a SuperBowl ad that followed its journey as a cancer survivor, celebrates the work being done at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine, and encouraged viewers to donate to the school’s cancer research efforts. This was a wonderful opportunity for the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the School of Veterinary Medicine, The University of Wisconsin. Being featured in a SuperBowl ad could drive a lot of donations. The University used the BrightVine Data Link Integration Engine to import all of the contributions made to that campaign. It saved the organization time and allowed for quick reporting back to all those involved in the campaign. The foundation uses the Data Link to process data and integrate third-party systems as well. It's an invaluable asset for the foundation.\n\nCVENT Event Integration with Best Friends Animal Society\n\nFor both attendees and staff, a seamless registration experience was a must. Best Friends Animal Society used Cvent™ event management software for this purpose and engaged BrightVine in early 2018 to assist with direct integration between Cvent™ and their Blackbaud CRM™ donor management system. The direct connection between Blackbaud CRM and Cvent saved staff time since the retrieval of files was no longer necessary and the events team could trust that the information visible in Blackbaud CRM™ was always current. The breadth of the incoming data was on the complex side, incorporating requirements that were not possible to accomplish using out-of-the-box import in Blackbaud CRM™. These included:\n\n​\n\nCreation of new constituents with contact information, relationships, and other biographical information\n\nUpdates to existing constituent data (such as new contact information)\n\nSingle & group event registration\n\nAbility to add additional payments for things like bus fees, site tours, additional sessions, or additional donations\n\nRefunds, partial refunds, cancellations, and other revenue updates\n\nOne of the most exciting parts of this project is that it included training on the underlying BrightVine Import and Integration Engine technology which, when paired with the team’s SQL Server Integration Services knowledge, means the Best Friends application developers are now equipped to create additional integrations when the need arises.\n\nUNICEF USA & Kids in Need of Desks\n\nKids in Need of Desks (K.I.N.D.) campaign, launched by the UNICEF USA and MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell, deliver desks to hundreds of schools in Africa. K.I.N.D. also provides secondary school scholarships to Malawian girls most in danger of missing out on an education. During the holidays O'Donnell promotes his K.I.N.D campaign and solicits donations on MSNBC's \"The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell.\" Every day large volumes of transactions are processed using the Data Link Integration Engine allowing UNICEF USA and O'Donnell to report near real-time fundraising results on his nightly show. UNICEF USA uses the Data Link to integrate numerous systems to Blackbaud CRM"
