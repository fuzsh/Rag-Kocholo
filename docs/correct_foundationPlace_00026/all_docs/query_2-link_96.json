Born fully blind in his left eye and legally blind in his right, Loebner’s path as a disability advocate stemmed from his sense of “personal invisibility” and the noticeable absence of people like him in the industry and marketing campaigns. An increased welcoming of disability, he says, will help to create more moments that inspire and connect us all."
