        "text": "Press Release\n\nBlackbaud, the leading provider of software for powering social impact, is honored to announce the recipients of its 2023 Blackbaud Fund grant program. This year, the Fund will award nearly $70,000 in grants to 10 coastal South Carolina nonprofit organizations that serve youth with disabilities and champion educational opportunities for underserved, disadvantaged and/or minority children – raising the Fund's total lifetime contributions to over $1 million.\n\nEstablished at Coastal Community Foundation (CCF) in Charleston, the Blackbaud Fund reflects the company's commitment to driving meaningful impact through corporate philanthropy and employee-driven initiatives. The Fund's annually rotating grant committee is comprised of Blackbaud employees in the Charleston area. The committee reviews applications, conducts site visits and develops funding recommendations, working under the guidance of CCF and the Blackbaud Fund leaders.\n\nIn the two decades since the Blackbaud Fund's inception, the committee has awarded over $1 million to 115 nonprofit grant recipients across Charleston, Berkeley and Dorchester counties.\n\n“We're proud to shine a light on the incredible work of our 2023 grantees dedicated to youth empowerment and education,” said Margaret “Maggie” Driscoll, chief people and culture officer, Blackbaud. “Our employee committee was energized and inspired by the significant impact generated by each of these worthy organizations. From learning enrichment and mental health support for vulnerable students to critical need services for children with physical and intellectual disabilities, this year's recipients further demonstrate how the Blackbaud Fund has continuously evolved to meet the needs of the diverse community it serves.”\n\n2023 Blackbaud Fund Grantees:\n\nCommunities in Schools of South Carolina® – implementing whole-school supports and case management services through one to one and small group counseling to students who struggle with access and face barriers related to poverty.\n\nTeachers' Supply Closet – providing free classroom supplies for teachers in Title I schools across Charleston, Berkeley and Dorchester counties.\n\nCarolina Youth Development Center – offering learning and enrichment through the 2023 Freedom School program's summer curriculum that supports children and families.\n\nCharleston Hope – expanding the Step-In Girls after-school empowerment programming with focus on mentorship, mental health sessions, service projects and leadership.\n\nHeart Math Tutoring – providing individual tutoring twice weekly for 135+ Charleston students across three under-resourced elementary schools during the 2023/24 school year.\n\nCamp Rise Above – creating “Camperships” to adaptive overnight camp experiences for children and young adults with special medical needs and life-threatening conditions.\n\nSouth Carolina Aquarium – delivering a science education program providing a no cost, on-site or virtual, interactive learning experience for 6,000 students at all grade levels.\n\nKids on Point – engaging high school students in a free, weeklong immersive education experience in civil rights history and democracy through the Charleston Civil Rights and Civics (C3) program.\n\nHoly City Wellbeing Mental Wellness Training Group – empowering underserved, primarily minority youth through Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) training. Evidence-Based trauma informed care training designed to decrease stress, anxiety and burn out by providing Mental Wellness Tools.\n\nSOS Care – enabling the critical expansion of clinic operations and facilities to offer more direct therapy and services to children and youth with autism and intellectual disabilities.\n\n“We are so grateful for this generous donation that will allow countless children with special medical needs and life-threatening conditions to experience the magic of camp,” said Erin Ulmer, executive director of Camp Rise Above. “More than fun and adventure, Camp Rise Above creates a sense of true belonging for our campers. The Blackbaud Fund grant will significantly broaden our impact by covering the cost for families to send their child to overnight summer camps, where they have the chance to just be a kid surrounded by others just like them.”\n\n“It's an honor to play a small role in the efforts and achievements of the 115 nonprofit organizations transforming lives and communities through the Blackbaud Fund,” Driscoll continued. “Blackbaud is deeply invested in fueling social impact, and we're proud to celebrate over $1 million steered directly through our employees to support causes they are passionate about. Additionally, we are proud to support many more organizations globally through our Community Matters and Reward Your Passion grants programs.”"
