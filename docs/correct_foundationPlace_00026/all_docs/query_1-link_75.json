        "text": "As much as I know about our nonprofit sector, sometimes it shocks me what I don't know.\n\nAnd I didn't know about The Blackbaud Giving Fund, a donor advised fund that disbursed $898 million in charitable gifts to 195,000 nonprofit organizations around the world since August 2020.\n\nWOW!\n\nAlmost a billion in about two and a half years.\n\nThe fund has connected generous donors and companies to the nonprofits they care about, making them among the top 10 largest donor-advised fund sponsors in the U.S.\n\nAnd here's the thing. I didn't know who they were, and you might not either.\n\nThis week on The Influential Nonprofit, I talked with Matt Nash, executive director of the fund, about what it is about and how nonprofits can get involved. Matt wants to grow awareness about the fund to the nonprofit community, so I am happy to pass this along to you.\n\nThe vision of the Blackbaud Giving Fund is to maximize workplace giving and employee participation. What I think is cool about this model is that this fund will allow you to connect directly with people who select your cause, thereby making new connections and growing your base of support. You might have friends you never knew you had! Whooo hoooo!\n\n“Employees want to work for a company that does something of social good. If those companies can offer it, then now you've got employees who want it, and it's a great match. And it's a great experience for them to be involved.”\n\nCheck it out here!\n\nIn case no one has told you yet today, you are awesome.\n\nWhen you are ready, here's how I can can help.\n\n1. Join my Up Level Your Influence course. If you want to get the most out of yourself and everyone else around you, ascend to that next level of leadership, and learn how to ask for anything you want, even money, without feeling rejected or pushy, hit reply with the subject line, \"I'm ready!\" and let's talk and see if you are a fit.\n\n2. Work with me to train your team in 2023. If you want stronger internal communications, with more self-leadership, I can bring my Up Level Your Influence course inside your organization for your team. Hit reply with the subject \"teams\" and tell me a bit about your challenges and vision.\n\n3. Work with me to train your board in 2023. If you want your board to step into its next level of leadership and learn how to support you more effectively in marketing and fundraising for the organization, hit reply with the subject line \"board\" and share a bit about your board goals for 2023.\n\nMaryanne is Founder and Chief Excitement Officer of Courageous Communication.
