David Hazeltine from Blackbaud shares the five criteria that will make or break the grantmaking experience in your organization. He covers five fundamental considerations for evaluating your incumbent and/or new vendor grantmaking technology vendor to keep your grantmaking heart beating. No matter what the size of the foundation, most agree that their technology keeps their office running like a clock. Those that are using their technology day in and day out are always interested in tips, tricks, and improvements from their vendor-partner solution that will save time, streamline processes, and heighten their impact and outcomes. Whether you are a foundation that’s had the benefit of grantmaking technology and services for years, or are perhaps a smaller organization that has not yet made the jump to tech, and are still managing business with spreadsheets and other low-tech, you’ll benefit from these technology evaluation rules that can and will save you and your colleagues potential headaches in the long run.
