        "text": "In an effort to clear my Netflix queue as part of my New Year’s streaming resolutions, I decided to sit down and watch the 1979 Mel Gibson action-thriller, Mad Max, before it expires from the service on February 1st.\n\nAfter my co-workers went bonkers for the new Mad Max: Fury Road trailer a few weeks ago, I thought it might be worth it to see the original so at the very least, I know the story and the innuendoes before Tom Hardy and his badass self is the talk of Summer 2015.\n\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdLl1GVjOrc]\n\nI know next to nothing about this franchise other than that it put Mel Gibson on the map, it’s one of the highest-grossing Aussie films ever, and it has fast cars. To be fair, I can’t take Mel Gibson flicks seriously because, as a member of Gen-Y, I’ve only known the actor-director to sport a kilt and blue paint, star in chick flicks with Helen Hunt, and direct #controversial movies about Jesus. I never experienced Peak Gibson: the blue-eyed Australian heartthrob who could sport leather pants like no other. Exhibit A:\n\nNo, I grew up with Braveheart-adoring guy friends and The Passion of the Christ getting nixed from the 2004 Oscar campaign only to result in a bunch of loose-cannon anti-Semitic commentary from the former A-lister who single-handedly ruined his own career.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when this guy emerged during a high speed chase:\n\nHere’s what I learned: the film follows Max, a cop turned vigilante after a corrupt justice system refuses to keep members of a violent biker gang behind bars. He loves his wife, Jessie (played by Joanne Samuel), who serenades her man on the saxophone from time to time…\n\nAnd I guess he loves his kid. Even if him and Jessie named him Sprog (too bad he got run over).\n\nAnd though the world is turned on its head during the worst energy crisis in human existence, Max keeps his head on straight, striving for normalcy in a dystopian world where the comforts of life exist only in the little things: home, family, memories.\n\nWhile I didn’t necessarily expect Mad Max to be my cup of tea, I was enthralled with how ahead of its time the film was, specifically in terms of dystopian direction and thematic warnings about the sanctity of the environment. I’ll admit, I had a Chinatown moment there for a second, but instead of, “This movie is a conspiracy about water?” It was, “This movie is about how we ran out of gas?” I expected the entire film to be a high speed, car-chasing thriller, and in addition to that I received not only a commentary on the environment, but a sentimental Gibson who somehow doesn’t sweat while wearing leather in Australian heat.\n\nWriter-director George Miller uses Toecutter’s (Hugh Keays-Byrne) gang to comment on the paranoia of a post-energy crisis planet, and relentlessly avenging Nightrider’s death is a way of grasping on to an idea that’s long gone: in this case, the way the world was when folks lived large and the gas was a-flowin’. Just look at that longing look in his eyes…\n\nBut for people living in an unsalvageable energy crisis, everyone in this movie sure wastes a lot of gas. To bike around and destroy other people’s gas supply…\n\nTo blow people up…\n\nAnd blow people up some more…\n\nI couldn’t help but think Miller did this on purpose, perhaps as a way to show that no matter how bad it gets, habits rarely change, which got us into this environmental mess in the first place.\n\nNow that my queue is clear of the Gibson classic, like the rest of Team Decider (and America), I can anxiously await for the fifth installment of the franchise starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, out in May. Though energy crisis talk is nothing new, with plummeting fuel prices and 2014 being the hottest year on record, Mad Max might be more relevant than ever, thirty-six years later.\n\nRELATED: My First Time… Watching Braveheart\n\nLike what you see?
