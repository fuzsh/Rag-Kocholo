        "text": "REVIEW: Sunset Strip at New Theatre\n\nSuzie Miller ' s Sunset Strip , currently playing at New Theatre in Newtown, blends humour and heartache that delves deep into the complexities of family bonds. Directed by Annette van Roden , it's a raw and authentic look at how we face life's most daunting challenges. Set in the fictional struggling lakeside town of Sunset Strip, the play centres on sisters Caroline and Phoebe, whose divergent life paths converge in a moment of celebration and crisis. Caroline, returning home after undergoing cancer treatment, finds herself confronting not only her illness but also the realities of her sister's life. Phoebe, who never left their hometown, grapples with caring for their father, now in the grips of dementia, while battling her own personal demons. Miller's script, true to her reputation as one of Australia's most celebrated playwrights, navigates heavy themes with a deft touch. Addiction, cancer, dementia, and grief are all explored, yet the play never feels\n\nHOW ‘TORN’ WAS ‘BURNED’ BEFORE NATALIE IMBRUGLIA MADE IT A SMASH\n\nCover versions of songs are often touted as ‘not being as good as the original’. Music history is awash with remakes, remixes and re-imaginings of popular tunes that find a new audience in a new era. Sometimes shelved projects and ‘rough-cuts’ never make it to release until picked-up and offered to other performers who, whether due to good luck or good timing, turn a previously discarded gem into a smash hit. Australian Natalie Imbruglia ’s rendition of TORN in 1997 certainly set that sleeper of a tune alight, with her version peaking at number one on singles charts in Belgium, Denmark, Canada, Spain and Sweden, and on Billboard's Mainstream Top 40 and Adult Top 40 charts. It reached number two on the ARIA Singles Chart in her native Australia and the Italian, Swiss and United Kingdom charts, selling upwards of 4 million copies worldwide. But the song itself travelled a chequered path on its way to history making sales, and subsequently further. BEGINNINGS &quo\n\nA TAPESTRY OF FRIENDSHIP: Conway and Coggan Revisit Carole King and James Taylor\n\nAustralian music veterans Deborah Conway and Darren Coggan are embarking on a national concert tour, You've Got a Friend , celebrating the enduring musical legacy of Carole King and James Taylor . This one-night-only event, kicking off in Sydney on July 19th before traveling to Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, and Melbourne, promises a captivating evening of musical exploration and storytelling. The concert features a stellar line-up of Australian musicians alongside Conway and Coggan, revisiting some of King and Taylor's most iconic hits. Audiences can expect to hear timeless classics from King's groundbreaking album Tapestry , including unforgettable tracks like You've Got a Friend and the entire album itself. The setlist will also delve into Taylor's rich discography, featuring songs like the introspective ballad Fire and Rain , the soulful How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You), the evocative Carolina in My Mind , and the uplifting anthem Shower the People .
