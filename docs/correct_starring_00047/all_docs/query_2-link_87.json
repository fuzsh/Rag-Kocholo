        "text": "The post-apocalyptic Australian action film - if nothing else - is the vehicle that introduced Mel Gibson to the world.\n\nAfter being cast as a relative unknown at the age of just 21, Gibson went on to achieve dizzying stardom as an actor and director. Of course, he then fell to appalling lows in his personal life which threatened to overshadow his many cinematic achievements. That he began his movie career playing a dysfunctional loner set on vengeance could simply be a case of manifest destiny.\n\nWhile the first instalment of the trilogy is set in a world that has experienced some kind of armageddon, it is only really in the improved sequel and the weak follow-up that the tell-tale signs of a decaying world are fully realised - from disfigured landscapes and rundown cities to random and orgiastic violence.\n\nThe first instalment was held back by a relatively small budget for such an ambitious action film. In , wide shots of empty outback roads and fields give some sense of desolation, but it often just feels like an unfortunate place to live, as opposed to representing the fag end of human civilisation.\n\nInstead, taking centre stage throughout the film is the marauding biker gang called Berserk; its members live and die with bestial, childlike savagery, not unlike the notorious Hell's Angels in the US who were prevalent at the time. They traverse the country to rape, pillage and murder with detached pleasure and impunity.\n\nIn contrast, Gibson's policeman Max Rockatansky is all cool, calm and collected. In some of the film's most dramatic and tender scenes with his on-screen wife, Jesse (Joanne Samuel), it all seems too clean and relaxed to be described as anything nearing apocalyptical. There's even a visit to some family friends who live by the beach, trips to buy ice cream for the baby, and Max wearing a freshly laundered shirt tucked into khaki pants.\n\nIt's meant to contrast with his leather uniform, as he's taking a much-needed break from the frontline after a vicious arson attack on his partner, Goose - but it just doesn't add up. is oddly inconsistent in mood: the film doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Moreover, the music is overbearing and unimaginative, and the violent scenes often resemble a parody of schlock-horror films.\n\nHowever, it did lead to a great sequel and introduced the world to the potential of Australian cinema."
