        "text": "Starring : Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Burke, Alya Browne, Lachy Hulme, Goran D. Kleut, Nathan Jones, Josh Helman, John Howard, Angus Sampson, Charlee Fraser, Quaden Bayles, Daniel Webber, Jacob Tomuri and Elsa Pataky\n\nDirector : George Miller\n\nDuration Running Time : (approx) 2 Hours 28 Minutes (148 Mins)\n\nCertification Rating Certificate: 15 (Suitable for those aged 15 or over)\n\nDistribution : Warner Bros. Pictures, Village Roadshow Pictures, Kennedy Miller Mitchell\n\nThe 'MAD MAX' franchise in question is in fact a series of post-apocalyptic/dystopian action films created by George Miller and Byron Kennedy - two Australian film producers.\n\nThe franchise movies in question began in 1979, with 'MAD MAX' and was followed by at least 'THREE SEQUELS': 'MAD MAX 2' (1981, released in the US as 'THE ROAD WARRIOR'), with Bruce Spence, Mike Preston, Vernon Wells, Max Phipps, Danny Peary, Virgina Hey and Emil Minty as The Feral Kid,\n\n(Interestingly I saw both 1 &2 in a roadshow double-feature bill in Studio 1 at the Studio 1-5 Cinema Complex, situated in Oxford Road, Manchester, which today is the Dancehouse Theatre during the 1980's)\n\n'MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME' (1985), featuring Tina Turner as Aunty Entity and 'MAD MAX: FURY ROAD' (2015) co-starring Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult; now Miller had directed or even co-directed all 'FOUR' MOVIES, Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson portrayed 'Mad' Max Rockatansky, the titular character in 'THE FIRST THREE MOVIES' while Tom Hardy had portrayed the character in 'MAD MAX: FURY ROAD'.\n\nThe franchise film series follows Max, initially a police officer who turns into a vigilante ('think of Charles Bronson' who in 1974, featured in 'DEATH WISH' as Paul Kersey, a middle-aged architect, who becomes a vigilante after his wife is murdered and also his daughter molested during an invasion inside his own establishment, the film directed by Michael Winner and based on the novel by Brian Garfield, originally published in 1972 ) in a future Australia which is experiencing 'societal collapse' due to war, critical resource shortages, and ecocide.\n\nBut when Jessie, (Joanne Samuel), Max's's wife and child -an infant son - known as 'Sprog' (this is the Australian slang for a child) are murdered by a vicious biker gang, Max then kills the gang in question - and also revenge - and becomes a drifting loner situated in the Australian Wasteland.\n\nBut also as Australia, devolves further into barbarity, Max, in question, finds himself increasingly more isolated yet still willing to help pockets of civilisation, initially for his own self-interest, though his motives in question always drift into more altruistic ones.\n\nThe 'franchise film series' in question, has been well received by many critics; 'MAD MAX 2' and 'MAD MAX: FURY ROAD' in question - and also in particular - have been ranked among 'THE BEST ACTION FILMS EVER MADE'.\n\nBut also the series has also had a significant influence on popular culture, most notably in 'apocalyptic and also post-apocalyptic fiction', and also emcompasses works in additional media - including video games and also comic books.\n\nThen in 2016, 'MAD MAX : FURY ROAD' became 'THE FIRST FILM OF THE MAD MAX FRANCHISE' to receive the 'ACADEMY AWARD RECOGNITION' by 'WINNING AT LEAST SIX OF ITS TEN NOMINATIONS' in total.\n\nJust for the record, the meaning of 'societal collapse' in question - - this is also known as civilizational collapse or even systems collapse which is also the fall of a complex human society that is characterized by the loss of cultural identity and also of social complexity as an adaptive system, the downfall of government, and also the rise of violence.\n\nPossible causes of a societal collapse include the likes of natural catastrophe, war, pestilence, famine, economic collapse, population decline or overshoot, mass migration, incompetent leaders, and also sabotage by rival civilizations.\n\nA collapsed society may revert to a more primative state, be absorbed into a stronger society, or completely disappear.\n\nVirtually all civilizations have suffered such a fate, regardless of their size or even their complexity, but also some of them in question had later revived or even transformed such as China, Greece and also Egypt.\n\nHowever, others never recovered, such as the Western and Eastern Roman Empires, the Maya civilization and also the Easter Island civilization.\n\nAnthropologists, (quantitative) historians,and also sociologists have proposed a variety of explanations for the collapse of civilizations involving causative factors such as enviromental change, depletion of resourses, unsustainable complexity, invasion, disesase, decay of social cohersion, rising inequality, long-term decline of cognitive abilities, loss of creativity, and also misfortune.\n\nHowever, the complete extinction of a culture is not inevitable, and that in some cases, the new societies that arise from the ashes of the old one are in fact evidently its offspring, despite a dramatic reduction in sophistication.\n\nMoreover, the influence of a collapsed society, such as the Western Roman Empire, may linger on after its death.\n\nThe study of societal collapse,collapsology, is also a unique topic for many specialists of the following: history, anthropology, sociology, and also political science.\n\nMore recently they are joined by many experts in cliodynamics and also the study of complex systems, - this is classed as the destruction of the enviroment by humans.\n\nAs for Ecocide, in question, well this threatens all human populations who are dependent on natural resourses for maintaining ecosystems and also by ensuring their unique abilities to support future generations.\n\nJust for the record, the 'OUTBACK' in question, is in fact, a remote, vast, sparsely, populated area of Australia.\n\nThe Outback is more remote than the bush itself.\n\nWhile often envisaged as being arid, the Outback regions extend from the northern to the southern Australian coastlines and also emcompass a number of climatic zones, including tropical and also monsoonal climates that are situated in northern areas, arid areas that are situated in the ''red centre'' and also ''semi-arid'' and also ''temperate'' climates in southerly regions.\n\nAlso for the record, the total population is estimated at around 607,000 people.\n\nGeographically, the Outback, in question, is unified by a combination of factors, most notably a low human population density, a largely intact natural enviroment and, that, in many places, low-intensity land uses, such as pastoralism (livestock grazing) in which the production is reliant on the natural enviroment.\n\nNow the Outback in question is in fact deeply engrained in Australian heritage, history, and also folklore, but also that in Australian art is that the subject of the Outback in question has been vogue, particulary in the 1940's, and by 2009, almost six decades later as part of the Q150 celebrations (Q150 was the sesquicentenary of the Separation of Queensland from New South Wales back in 1859, and that the Separation was then established as the Colony of Queensland, which then became the State of Queensland in 1901, as part of the celebration of Australia, and that Q150 in question, was celebrated in 2009) the Queensland Outback was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its unique role as a 'natural attraction'.\n\nAnd now in 2024, forty-five years after the franchise began in 1979, with 'MAD MAX' directed by George Miller, an Australian filmmaker, whose other film credits as a film director include the following : 'LORENZO'O OIL' (1992), a biographical medical drama based on the true story of Augusto Daniel and Michaela Teresa Murphy Odone (Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon) the parents who search for a cure for their son Lorenzo - aka Lorenzo Michael Murphy Odone (Zack O'Malley Greenburg), adrenalukodystrophy (ALD).\n\nThis is classed as a disease linked to the X chromosome, it is a result of fatty acid buildup caused by the failure of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation which results in the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body and also leading up to the development of Lorenzo's Oil, a liquid solution made up of 'FOUR PARTS' - GLYCEROL TRIOLEATE - and also 'ONE PART' - GLYCEROL TRIERUCATE, - which in turn are the 'TRIACYLGLYCEROL FORMS' OF OLEIC ACID AND ALSO ERUCIC ACID, - it is also prepared from OLIVE OIL and RAPESEED OIL, which was followed by 'THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK' (1987), a dark fantasy supernatural comedy featuring Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer and also Susan Sarandon again as the titular witches plus Jack Nicholson as Daryl Van Horne, and based on John Updike's original novel published in 1984.\n\nAnd then there was the Academy -Award winning animated feature 'HAPPY FEET' (2006), which also featured the voices of Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Hugo Weaving, Anthony LaPaglia, Magda Szubanski and Steve Irwin.\n\nMiller also produced 'BABE' (1995), directed by Chris Noonan, this was the family friendly fantasy adventure featuring James Cromwell as Arthur Hoggett, a farmer, with Szubanski as Esme Hoggett, wife of Arthur Hoggett, and also based on the children's novel by Dick King-Smith and tells the story of a farm pig who wants to do the work of a sheepdog, and also 'BABE : PIG IN THE CITY' (1998), who Miller in question had co-wrote, produced, and also directed and featuring Cromwell and Szubanski 'reprising their original roles' along with Mickey Rooney as Fugly Floom.\n\nBut Miller in question, was not only a film director, he was also a doctor who studied medicine at the University of New South Wales, along with his twin brother John, and that it was that in 1971, while in his final year at medical school, that George and Chris, his younger brother had made 'ST VINCENT'S REVUE FILM' - this in question was a 'ONE MINUTE SHORT' that also won them 'FIRST PRIZE' in a student competition.\n\nAlso in 1971, Miller, attended a film workshop at Melbourne University, and where he met Byron Kennedy, a fellow student, and also a school lecturer as well and also whom he formed a lasting friendship by winning two Australian Film Institute (AFI) awards and also a production partnership until Kennedy's 'passing' in 1983, when Kennedy in question, was piloting the helicopter when it crashed and was subsequently killed.\n\nBy 1972, a year later, Miller, had completed his residency at St Vincent's Hospital, situated in Sydney, Australia, by spending his time off crewing on short experimental films, but it was also in that same year that Miller and Kennedy had originally founded 'KENNEDY MILLER PRODUCTIONS' and that the pair in question had subsequently collaborated on numerous works.\n\nHowever after Kennedy's 'passing' in 1983, Miller had kept his name in the original film company and in 2009, it was later renamed as 'KENNEDY MILLER MITCHELL' as a unique way to recognise Doug Mitchell's (no relation - only by surname only) role in the company as a financial partner in the enterprise since 1981, and is also Miller's producing partner in The Australian film industry.\n\nNow Mitchell's career as a film producer first began in the mid 1980's as a member of the 'KENNEDY MILLER' production house originally based in Sydney, Australia, and that in the late 1980's he was nominated with Miller and also Terry Hayes, an English-born screenwriter, producer and also an author - best known for his unique work with the 'KENNEDY MILLER' production house and also 'I AM PILGRIM' - his debut novel, and that the novel in question was published in the UK, on July 18, 2013.\n\nHayes on the other hand was born in Sussex, England, on October 8, 1951, and moved to Australia, in 1956, five years later, aged five years old.\n\nHayes began his career as a journalist by working for 'The Sydney Morning Herald', an Australian newspaper as a US Correspondent, and by 1999, Hayes later married and has four children.\n\nYears earlier after Hayes spent periods as an investigative reporter, columnist, and also a radio show host, Hayes, in question, had first met George Miller, a film director, when he did the novelisation of the script to 'MAD MAX' (1979), the two of these got on so well, that Miller, the film director, subsequently hired Hayes in question, to help on the script for 'MAD MAX 2' - 'aka' 'THE ROAD WARRIOR' (1981).\n\nBut also that Hayes in question in 1989 had also wrote 'BANGKOK HILTON' a tv mini-series featuring Nicole Kidman (this was specifically as a vehicle for Kidman) and also Denholm Elliott best known for portraying Marcus Brody in 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981), and also 'INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE' (1989), directed by Steven Spielberg and also produced by George Lucas.\n\nHayes also became subsequently involved as an 'in-house' writer for 'Kennedy Miller', working on the scripts for all their subsequent 'mini-series' and also further work included a script for 'DEAD CALM' (1989), this is classed as a psychological thriller featuring Sam Neill, Billy Zane and also Nicole Kidman, the screenplay by Hayes, in question, was based on the novel 'of the same name' by Charles F. Williams and was originally published in 1963, the film in question, filmed around the 'GREAT BARRIER REEF' (this is classed as the world's largest 'coral reef system' composed of over 2, 900 individual reefs and also 900 islands stretching for over 2,300 kilometres (about 1,400 miles) over an area of approximately 344,400 square kilometers (133,000 square miles), the reef in question, is originally located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland.\n\nThe plot of the story focuses on 'a married couple' - notably Rae Ingram, (Kidman), and also John Ingram, (Neill),her husband who also happens to be an officer of the Royal Australian Navy, and who after tragically losing their son, are spending some time isolated at sea, right in the middle of the Pacific Ocean when they come across Hughie Warriner, (Zane), a man and also a complete stranger, who has abandoned a sinking ship.\n\nNotably, the film in question, is the most successful film adaptation of the novel after George Orson Welles, an American director, actor, writer, producer, and also a magician - who is remembered for his innovative work in film, radio and also theatre, and is also considered to be amongst the greatest and also the most influential filmmakers of all-time, worked for at least a number of years to complete his own film and also based on it entitled as 'THE DEEP', though it ultimately 'unreleased' and also 'uncompleted'.\n\nNow Welles in question had also produced and wrote 'THE DEEP' as well as playing the role of Russ Brewer, with a supporting cast such as Jeanne Moreau, a French actress, singer, songwriter, director and also a socialite, appearing in movies such as 'ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS' (1958), directed by Louis Malle, 'LA NOTTE' (1961), directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, and featuring Monica Vitti and Marcello Mastroianni in supporting roles, and also 'JULES ET JIM' ('JULES AND JIM') - UK (1962), described as a 'new wave romantic drama film' directed, produced, and also co-written by Francois Truffaut, and also Laurence Harvey (aka Zvi Mosheh Skikne - his real name), a Lithuanian born British actor and film director, appearing in movies such as 'ROOM AT THE TOP' (1959), directed by Jack Clayton, and featuring performances from Simone Signoret and Heather Sears in supporting roles.\n\nAnd then there's 'THE ALAMO' (the original 1960 version), directed by John 'The Duke' Wayne'(who also appears in the film as Colonel Davy Crockett) and Ray Kellogg (not the founder of Kellogg's Cornflakes - the breakfast cereal - other cornflake packages are also available) as William Barret 'Buck' Travis, and featuring performances from Richard Widmark as Colonel Jim Bowie (no relation to David Bowie) and also Richard Boone as General Sam Houston.\n\nInterestingly there's a scene in 'AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON' (1981) directed by John Landis inside 'THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB' - this was actually inside a cottage, that was originally situated in Crickadarm, a tiny village, about six miles (9.7 km) southeast of Builth Wells, this is actually classed as a 'market town' and also a community in the county of Powys, and also the historic town of Brecknockshire, (Breconshire), situated in mid-Wales - also the interior scenes in question were filmed in the Black Swan,Old Lane,Martyrs Green, Surrey, - a public drinking establishment and where Brian Glover, the character of a Chess player is telling the following joke :\n\n'A plane is in trouble and to save the rest, many delegates decide to jump out.\n\nThen a Frenchman steps up first and shouts ''VIVE LA FRANCE'' and jumps out.\n\nNext, an Englishman steps up, and shouts ''GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!'' and follows suit.\n\nBut when it comes for the American to take his turn - he then shouts to the top of his voice - ''REMEMBER THE ALAMO! '' - 'AND THROWS OUT THE MEXICAN'.\n\nThis scene alone is well-remembered for its humor and also the performances of some of the actors in question - including a young Rik Mayall.\n\nAlso the studio film executives at Universal Pictures originally pressured Landis (the film director) to cast Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi (the main stars of 'THE BLUES BROTHERS' (1980), and also directed by Landis, as Jake and Elwood Blues - but Landis went along and cast unknown stars such as David Naughton and Griffin Dunne to play the parts of David Kessler and also Jack Goodman as two American graduate backpacker students originally from New York City instead.\n\nBut also when 'DEAD CALM' directed by Phillip Noyce, who's an Australian film and television director and since 1977, Noyce, in question, has directed over 'nineteen' feature films in various genres including 'historical drama' such as 'NEWSFRONT' (1978), an Australian drama film featuring Bill Hunter, Wendy Hughes, Chris Haywood and Bryan Brown and the summary of the plot are as follows: In 'post-war' Australia, the men and women of 'CINETONE' struggle to produce the 'weekly news reels' for the movie going public, and surprisingly this is an adventurous saga of an intrepid group of cinematographers and reporters, - who risk 'life and limb' to capture the footage of 'breaking news' for the movie-going public.\n\nThis was also followed by 'RABBIT PROOF FENCE'(2002), featuring Sir Kenneth Branagh as A.O. Neville, a British-Australian public servant, who served as the Chief Protector of Aborigines and also the Commissioner of Native Affairs in Western Australia, and also based on a true story from the 1996 book entitled as 'FOLLOW THE RABBIT-PROOF FENCE' by Doris Pilkington Garimara, 'THE QUIET AMERICAN' (also 2002), a political drama film based on the original 1955 novel by Graham Greene and set in Vietnam - the story is set in 1952, Saigon, Vietnam, toward the end of the First Indochina War - the plot in question revolves around a 'love triangle' between three people : - notably - Thomas Fowler, (Sir Michael Caine), a British journalist in his fifties; Alden Pyle, (Brendan Fraser), a young American idealist; and also Phuong, (Do Thi Hai Yen), a young Vietnamese woman, however on another level - it is also about the growing American involvement - that led to the full-scale American war in Vietnam.\n\nThomas Fowler, who narrates the story, is involved in the war only as a reporter, and that he lives with Phuong, a young Vietnamese mistress.\n\nMeanwhile Pyle, who represents America and its policies in Vietnam, poses as an aid worker but is eventually exposed as a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative. Pyle in question, is sent to steer 'the war' according to America's interests.\n\nThe film in question, illustrates the moral capability of American agents in arranging terrorists actions which in turn are aimed at the French colonial government and also the Viet Minh.\n\nBut that going beyond Greene's original work, the film in question had used a montage that concluded with 'superimposed images' of the American soldiers from the intervening decades of the Vietnam war.\n\nThe film in question had received positive reviews from many film critics and that Sir Michael Caine, in question, was in fact nominated for the Academy Award - aka - an Oscar - for Best Actor.\n\nHowever, in 1983, 'nine years earlier' Caine in question had also appeared in 'THE HONORARY CONSUL' ('BEYOND THE LIMIT' - US Title) - this featured Richard Gere, Bob Hoskins, and also Elpidia Carrillo, and like 'THE QUIET AMERICAN' - this too, was also based on a Graham Greene novel, which was originally published back in 1973, ten years earlier.\n\nThe story in question, is in fact a gripping tragicomedy of a bungled kidnapping in a provincial Argentinian town of Corrientes, and also set in a provincial Argentinian community as Charley Fortnum (Caine), - a British consulate with dubious authority and also a notorious fondness for drink - is kidnapped by rebels - in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nThe film directed by John Mackenzie also retains the novel's intricate plot and emotional depth, simply by exploring the themes of political and also a personal betrayal.\n\nNoyce also directed thrillers such as 'SLIVER' (1993), this is an American erotic thriller based on the novel by Ira Levin and starring William Baldwin, Sharon Stone and Tom Berenger plus 'THE BONE COLLECTOR' (1999), an American crime thriller based on the 1997 novel by Jeffrey Deaver and starring Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie, Washington portrays Lincoln Rhyme, a quadriplegic forensic expert, who is bedridden after an accident that left him paralysed from the neck down.\n\nMeanwhile, Amelia Donaghy (Jolie), a newly recruited patrol officer, discovers a mutilated corpse buried at a civil war-era railroad bed. Rhyme, in question, then comes to the conclusion that the scene in question was actually staged and also teams up with an initially hesitant Amelia, and is very impressed with her natural forensic instincts. The film also stars Queen Latifah, Michael Rooker, Mike McGlone, Leland Orser, Luis Guzman, Bobby Cannavale and Ed O'Neill in supporting roles.\n\nNoyce has also directed action movies as well such as 'BLIND FURY' (1989), with Rutger Hauer, 'THE SAINT' (1997), featuring Val Kilmer, Elisabeth Shue and Rade Serbedzija and also 'SALT' (2010) with Angelina Jolie - again - as Evelyn Salt - a sleeper agent plus Isaac Liev Schreiber, Andre Braugher and Chiwetel Ejiofor in a supporting roles.\n\nHowever, Schreiber also starred in 'RAY DONOVAN', this was a a tv series lasting 'seven seasons' comprising of eighty-two episodes from 2013-2020, sees Schreiber as a professional 'fixer' who arranges the likes of bribes, payoffs, threats, crime-scene clean-up, and also other illegal activities to protect his (usually) celebrity clients - the series in question also features Paula Malcomson, Eddie Marsan and also Oscar Winning actor Jon Voight in supporting roles.\n\nAlso Noyce, in question, directed the Jack Ryan movie adaptations of 'PATRIOT GAMES' (1992) and also 'CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER' (1994), both of which featured Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan and based on the novels by Tom Clancy.\n\nHowever, 'DEAD CALM' in question was well received generally with many critics praising the performances of Neill, Kidman and also Zane, plus the stunning oceanic cinematography by Dean Semler, although some film critics had in fact criticised the elements of the script in question for being what they viewed as a sensationalisation and also an 'over-the-top' climatic ending; a critique at Warner Brothers ''the film studio'' who had requested that it had to be ''RE-SHOT'' and also to provide a less ambiguous resolution for one of 'the original film characters' in question.\n\nModern retrospective analysis on the other hand, assesses the film more favourably with 'THE NEW YORK TIMES' (NYT) an American daily newspaper based in New York City, naming it as 'ONE OF THE BEST 'ONE THOUSAND' BEST FILMS' ever made.\n\nAnd now the plot line for 'MAD MAX FURIOSA' which is classed as 'THE FIFTH INSTALMENT' and it also serves as 'A SPIN-OFF' and also a 'PREQUEL'.\n\nJust for the record - this is a narrative work that occurs before the original story, these can often be in the form of a backstory, expository, or even a side story - but as long as the story in question is being told that is chronologically before an original or even 'an original first work' - then it can be simply labelled as a 'prequel'.\n\nAlso the meaning of 'ORIGIN' is in fact a narrative construct by simply detailing the genesis (not the pop group consisting of Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, and also Phil Collins aka a little drummer boy and also was due to appear in 'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' (1968), as one of the kids who storm the castle - but his scene was subsequently cut out of the finished product) of a unique character or an organisation.\n\nIt also encompasses the main critical events, influences and also the circumstances that shapes the character's traits, beliefs, values, and also motivations.\n\nOften serving as a catalyst for their future actions or decisions, the origin story in question is in fact pivotal into creating the depth of an original character and also establishing their true identity within a narrative context.\n\nThese origin stories lay the groundwork for character development, by simply offering many insights into why the original characters act as they do and also illuminating their original paths that they may follow.\n\nThese original stories, in question, not only introduce the main character of the story in question to movie audiences, but that they also serve as the 'foundation' for the character's journey and also the growth throughout the narrative.\n\nHere what follows is a prime example :\n\nIn the movie 'IRON MAN' (2008), directed by Jon Favreau, Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jnr, who won a 'BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR' Oscar for his performance as Lewis Strauss in 'OPPENHEIMER' - (2023) directed by Sir Christopher Edward Nolan, CBE) origin story showcases how his experience as a captive in Afghanistan, shapes him into the superhero that he becomes.\n\nThis backstory helps us to connect with the character on a more profound level.\n\nHowever, in the context of mythology, an origin story, which in turn is also dubbed as a ''pourquoi story'', also refers to narratives of how a world (such as ours) began, how many creatures and plants in question, came into an existence, and also why certain things in the cosmos (not the holiday brochure - other holiday brochures are also available - however most holiday advertisements are now online) have certain yet distinct qualities.\n\nAnd so, in summary, an origin story, in question, provides a comprehensive understanding of a unique character's journey, and which also shapes their unique personality and values, and also acts as a catalyst for their future actions.\n\nBut that at the end of the day, that it is also known as a crucial element in character development and also storytelling as well.\n\nThe film in question, is set at least 15-20 years before the events of 'MAD MAX: FURY ROAD', and as the world simply falls apart young Furiosa (Browne),is snatched from 'the green place of many mothers' - and also that in the context of the 'MAD MAX UNIVERSE' - this in question - refers to the birthplace of the character Furiosa.\n\n'The Green Place' is described by many as a fertile, idyllic land, that's known to many as a 'wasteland' and it was once home to the Vuvalini tribe, and which was also known by many as the 'Many Mothers'.\n\nNow, this tribe in question, is a clan of women that lived in the 'Green Place', and also that Furiosa, in question, was in fact one of the children that was raised communally by them.\n\nBut soon, Imperator Furiosa,(Taylor-Joy), falls into the hands of a great biker horde that's led by Dementus (Hemsworth), a warlord, and that as they sweep through the wasteland, they come across the Citadel, presided by Immortan Joe, (Hulme), and as the two tyrants in question, fight for dominance, Furiosa, in question, soon finds herself in a non-stop battle to make her way home.\n\nNow there has been early reaction's to 'FURIOSA' - which is Miller's action 'prequel' and also have been surfaced, and that is seems that the film in question is creating quite a 'buzz', and also while it seems as not reaching the same heights as 'MAD MAX: FURY ROAD' -its predecessor - but also that many film critics (including yours truly) and also early viewers that have seen the film as an advanced special 'free' preview in selected movie theaters have also shared their thoughts about this highly anticipated movie by calling it as a blast, a masterful examination of the characters of the last twenty years, absolutely 'f******' brilliant, a grandeur by exceeding the canvas of an original while maintaining moments of deepest intimacy, a gritting tale of a revenge thriller, in a world that's completely gone mad, and 'All Hail George Miller' as 'FURIOSA' in question as an epic and a beautiful vision of the future that everything that she asked for - she got it - served on a golden plate.\n\nAlso the performances by Taylor-Joy and also Hemsworth, are both standouts that shine out, as well as the editing, action set-pieces, the stunning cinematography, and also the special-effects which are jaw-dropping to watch on a gigantic big screen especially in the IMAX format but also that 'FURIOSA' is quite an epic - at just under 'two and a half hours'(this is without doubt - the longest film in the franchise series - unlike a 'giantic' hot dog) - is without doubt operates in an extremely different gear - but also manages to enrich the 'MAD MAX' universe whilst at the same time by carving out its own unique legends that are truly set in the wastelands.\n\n'FURIOSA' is without doubt, a 'magnificent masterpiece of a monumental epic movie, full of action, that keeps the die hard movie fan entertained in the movie theater - and its one of those epic experiences that you'll simply love to enjoy the full-on cinematic experience, which I know that you'll embrace.\n\nThis is without doubt of the greatest masterpieces that has to be seen - on the big screen, and also 'ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF 2024'.\n\nDon't Miss It !\n\nDavid M.G.Mitchell"
