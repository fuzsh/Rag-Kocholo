Referred to as the \"King of Pop\", Michael Jackson is considered to be one of the greatest entertainers of all time and one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Michael Jackson has won a total of 834 awards in his career and is the most awarded musical artist of all time.\n\nJackson's career was rewarded with 13 Grammy Awards, as well as the Grammy Legend Award and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award; 6 Brit Awards, 5 Billboard Music Awards and 24 American Music Awards. He currently holds 28 Guinness World Records. The organization also recognized Jackson as the world’s most successful entertainer in 2006. He's a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming one of only a few artists to be inducted twice (he was inducted in 1997 as a member of The Jackson 5 and again as a solo artist in 2001). Jackson was also inducted into the National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame, making him the first and currently, only recording artist to be inducted. He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Jackson was also inducted in 2014 into the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame along with his father Joe Jackson.\n\nJackson was awarded with an honor from the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan. In April 1990, Jackson returned to the White House to be recognized as \"Artist of the Decade\" by President George H. W. Bush. Two years later, on May 1, 1992, President Bush presented Jackson with an award acknowledging him as \"a point of light ambassador\". Jackson received the award in recognition for his efforts in inviting disadvantaged children to his Neverland Ranch. Jackson was the only entertainer to receive the award. He has two Primetime Emmy Award nominations in 1983 and 1990.\n\nTop - 0-9 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nAward/organization Year Nominee/work Category Result Ref.
