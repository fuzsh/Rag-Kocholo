He debuted on the professional music scene at the age of 5, as a member of The Jackson 5, and began a solo career in 1971 while still a member of the group in subsequent years. Referred to as the \"King of Pop\",[1] Michael Jackson is considered to be the greatest entertainer of all time and one of the most influential figures of the 20th century.[2][3][4]\n\nJackson's career was rewarded with 13 Grammy Awards, as well as the Grammy Legend Award and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award; 6 Brit Awards, 5 Billboard Music Awards and 24 American Music Awards. He currently holds 28 Guinness World Records. The organization also recognized Jackson as the world's most successful entertainer in 2006.[5][6] He's a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming one of only a few artists to be inducted twice (he was inducted in 1997 as a member of The Jackson 5 and again as a solo artist in 2001). Jackson was also inducted into the National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame, making him the first and currently, only recording artist to be inducted.[7] He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[8] Jackson was also inducted in 2014 into the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame along with his father Joe Jackson.[9]\n\nIn 1984, Jackson was approached to donate \"Beat It\" as backing music for a commercial on drunk driving.[10] Jackson agreed and it was arranged for the singer to be awarded with an honor from the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan.[10] In April 1990, Jackson returned to the White House to be recognized as \"Artist of the Decade\" by President George H. W. Bush.[11] Two years later, on May 1, 1992, President Bush presented Jackson with an award acknowledging him as \"a point of light ambassador\".[11][12] Jackson received the award in recognition for his efforts in inviting disadvantaged children to his Neverland Ranch.[12] Jackson was the only entertainer to receive the award.[12] He has two Primetime Emmy Award nominations in 1983 and 1990.[13] In 2000, Jackson was honored as the Artist of the Millennium at the world music awards and credited as the best selling solo artist of all time.
