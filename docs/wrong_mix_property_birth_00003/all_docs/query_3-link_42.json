        "text": "The National Association of Railroad Passengers is seeking nominations for the Dr. Gary Burch Memorial Safety Award, an annual honor awarded to the railroad worker who has done the most to improve the safety of railroad passengers. The award is bestowed in memory of Dr. Burch, one of eight passengers who died in 1991 when Amtrak's Silver Star derailed.\n\nCONDITIONS OF AWARD\n\n(Presented by the Burch Family)\n\nPURPOSE To recognize the individual railroad employee judged to have done the most to improve the safety of railroad passengers in 2016. The recipient of the Burch Safety Award will be honored at NARP’s annual Day on the Hill in Washington, D.C., and a $1,000 award from the Burch Family.\n\nELIGIBILITY All employees of railroads and agencies which operate or contract for the operation of intercity passenger or commuter trains (as distinct from local mass transit) or whose tracks are used by such trains.\n\nNOMINATION CRITERIA The choice of selection criteria shall be the prerogative of each nominating railroad, authority or union, but consideration should be given to the employee who: A. Identifies and reports or corrects a passenger-threatening hazard and thereby prevents a possible accident or serious injury. B. Initiates and fosters (by ideas, programs or other means) an atmosphere that promotes superior safety performance and awareness with respect to railroad passengers\n\nNOTES Organizations are encouraged to submit more than one nomination. This year, as was the case last year, nominations also will be accepted from individuals. Personal acts of heroism shall not be a consideration for this award. The committee is particularly interested in front-line workers whose job description duties are not specifically related to safety (e.g. “Safety Coordinator”), including track inspectors and track workers, and in work \"beyond the job description\" by all nominees. Please also note that the employee need not be directly involved in the operation of trains—the 2012 award winners were a trio of Amtrak engineers. A nominating carrier need not run passenger trains for its own account; it is enough to simply host passenger trains operated by others. Operation Lifesaver activities should not be the only activity to recommend a candidate.\n\nNOMINATING PROCEDURE Nominations shall be submitted in the form of a typewritten letter not to exceed two pages in length. Nominations recognizing accomplishments in 2016 must be received by Friday, March 3, 2017. They must be sent to:\n\nThe National Association of Railroad Passengers\n\nAttn: Burch Award\n\n505 Capitol Court, NE, Suite 300\n\nWashington, DC 20002-7706\n\nFax: (202) 408-8287 (Voice: 408-8362)\n\nE-mail: sjeansgail[at]narprail.org\n\nSuch nominations will be forwarded to the Burch Award Advisory Committee.\n\nRecipients of the Dr. Gary Burch Memorial Safety Award\n\n2016 - Shamonda Jones\n\nMetra (Chicago) Commuter Rail Senior Manager\n\n2012 - Michael Trosino, Steven Chrismer, and Marty Perkins, Sr.\n\nAmtrak Industrial Design Managers\n\n2011 - Blair Slaughter\n\nAmtrak Industrial Design Manager\n\n2010 - John Bernal\n\nAmtrak Mechanical Foreman\n\n2009 - Dwayne Meadows\n\nNorfolk Southern Bridge Supervisor\n\n2008 - John \"Jake\" Mumford\n\nAmtrak Police Department Detective\n\n2007 - J.
