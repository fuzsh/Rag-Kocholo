        "text": "The more you study the life of Michael Jackson, the more you realize how he was living in conditions that did not allow him to live a childhood. Whether at Gary Indiana which was plagued in Crime and violent gang fights to Hollywood's opportunistic climate, he never lived a peaceful childhood free from parasites and dangerous individuals. If he was good at detecting the parasites in showbiz so that he would not befriend them, he was unfortunately not very good at detecting the ordinary people and families who only befriended him for his cash and work opportunities. His family has always been welcoming toward everyone. That is why so many fans got to visit Neverland and get to have easy dialogues with the Jackson family. That family is among the most accessible toward the public. So Michael's welcoming nature was something that he did as well. But as a bigger celebrity than the rest of his family, he became at the mercy of more parasitic individuals than other celebs. Such as the Chandlers, the Arvizos, the Robsons, and the Safechucks.\n\nWhat is infuriating is how the latter two families were constantly praising him and defending him when he was alive and when he was dead for many years. But the minute they got money issues or career problems (ex: Robson's Cirque du Soleil failed opportunity), then they decided to claim the opposite of what they stood by under oath for many decades.\n\nAs someone who consulted the testimonials of hundreds and hundreds of people who either befriended or interacted closely around MJ, I noticed how they were all supportive and very defensive of him as one of the best human being that they ever met. Whereas those who interacted around his accusers, including people who never met Michael, all had very strong and negative words about these accusers' history and about their behaviors either in public, in private, or at work.\n\nFurthermore, I find it baffling and hypocritical that some medias make a big fuss about MJ being friends with families and with kids, but when other adult celebrities also develop a friendship with kids or with child actors/actresses, they don't experience such media attacks.\n\nPersonally, the reason MSM have decided to demonize MJ since the 1980s has something to do with his vitiligo and lupus, and most of all his success with Thriller and his purchase of that music catalogue containing the Beatles songs. Had he not experienced these situations, then he would not have gone through such witch hunts since the 1980s.\n\nAnyone who wants to know more information about Michael can consult the podcasts called \"Michael Jackson Case for Innocence\", \"Red Jackson Dance\", \"The Mjcast\", and the documentaries \"Square One MJ\", \"The Lies of Leaving Neverlandâ, âMichael Jackson Private Home Moviesâ, âMichael Jackson Take Two The Footage You Were Never Meant to Seeâ, âMichael Jackson The Humanitarianâ and âLoving Neverlandâ. These sources of information are precious and rich in information that the media refuses to adequately represent."
