        "text": "Cynthia Franklin is the recipient of the 2017 Gary Lee Shaffer Award for Academic Contributions to the Field of School Social Work, presented by the School Social Work Association of America.\n\n“I envision my research as existing to empower school social work practice. This is the heart of my work. I started my practice in the 1980s in child and family mental health and quickly gravitated toward schools and alternative schools. I soon came to believe that the best way that I can make a difference in a child’s life is to help them get their education. This is a value that I know that all of you in this room share,” Franklin said at the awards ceremony, which took place during the 20th Annual National School Social Work Conference in San Diego, CA, March 22.\n\nFranklin is the Sternberg/Spencer Family Professor in Mental Health and associate dean for doctoral education at the UT Austin School of Social Work. She is a world-renowned scholar in school mental health. Her research examines the practice and effectiveness of solution-focused brief therapy with children and adolescents. She is the current Editor-in Chief for the Encyclopedia of Social Work and is the author of several books including, The School Services Sourcebook: A Guide for School-based Professionals (Oxford University Press), and Solution Focused Brief Therapy: A Handbook of Evidence-base Practice (Oxford University Press)."
