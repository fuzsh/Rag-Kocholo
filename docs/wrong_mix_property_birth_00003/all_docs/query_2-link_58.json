        "text": "When Victoria Monét accepts the Rising Star Award at the 2024 Billboard Women in Music Awards on Wednesday, March 6, it will mark the second major honor she has received in just over a month. Monét won three Grammys, including best new artist, on Feb. 4. Monét is the first artist to win both the Grammy for best new artist and the Billboard WIM Rising Star Award.\n\nFive previous Billboard WIM Rising Star honorees were Grammy-nominated for best new artist: Jazmine Sullivan, Nicki Minaj, Kelsea Ballerini, Rosalía and Chloe x Halle.\n\nMonét’s Billboard WIM award was announced on Jan. 24, nearly two weeks before her wins at the 66th annual Grammy Awards. In addition to best new artist, she won best R&B album and best engineered album, non-classical, both for Jaguar II.\n\nTracee Ellis Ross will host the 2024 Billboard Women in Music Awards, which will be held at YouTube Theater at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, Calif. – just outside of Los Angeles — on March 6 and will stream the following day.\n\nThis year’s other WIM honorees are Karol G (Woman of the Year), NewJeans (Group of the Year Award), Ice Spice (Hitmaker Award), Kylie Minogue (Icon Award), Maren Morris (Visionary Award), Charli XCX (Powerhouse Award), Tems (Breakthrough Award), Young Miko (Impact Award) and Luísa Sonza (Global Force Award).\n\nIn 2008, Colbie Caillat received Billboard‘s first Rising Star Award. The Grammy for best new artist was first presented in 1959 to Bobby Darin. In 1968, Bobbie Gentry became the first woman to win the award."
