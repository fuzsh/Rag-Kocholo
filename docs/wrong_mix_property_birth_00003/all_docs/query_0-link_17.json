        "text": "1997\n\nMusée Grévin:\n\nInauguration\n\nApril, 19\n\nThe Musée Grévin (Euronext: GREV) is a waxwork museum in Paris located on the Grands Boulevards in the IXe arrondissement on the right bank of the Seine, at 10, Boulevard Montmartre, Paris, France. It is open daily; an admission fee is charged.\n\nThe museum was founded in 1882 by Arthur Meyer, a journalist for Le Gaulois, and named for its first artistic director, caricaturist Alfred Grévin. It is one of the oldest wax museums in Europe. Its baroque architecture includes a mirrored mirage room based on the principle of a catoptric cistula and a theater for magic shows.\n\nThe Musée Grévin now contains some 450 characters arranged in scenes from the history of France and modern life, including a panorama of French history from Charlemagne to Napoleon III, bloody scenes of the French Revolution, movie stars, and international figures such as Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, and Pope John Paul II. The tableau of Charlotte Corday murdering Jean-Paul Marat includes the actual knife and bathtub used.\n\nNew wax characters are regularly added to the Museum.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musée_Grévin\n\n.June 1996, Michael Jackson accepted a meeting in Los Angeles with sculptor Denis Lonchampt, decorator Laurent Teboul and Véronique Berecz, head of Public Relations at the Grévin, to pose for his figure. Six months later, a second meeting, this time in Switzerland, where Michael was recording an album. The figure was transported to the Grand Hôtel de Lausanne to check for accuracy and Michael Jackson was amused to find that the twin's muscles were overdeveloped. The modifications were made and in March 1997, Bob Jones, Michael Jackson's PR manager at the time, contacted the Grévin: \"Michael can come and inaugurate his figure on April 19. Would that be OK?\".\n\nApril 19th 1997: no traffic allowed on the Grands Boulevards. The star arrives, to wild applause from the huge crowd awaiting him, delirious fans calling out his name repeatedly. He is riding in a Renault Espace, with BAD number plates, wearing a dark costume and dark glasses and half hidden under a hat. Michael lingered for a long while outside the Grévin to talk to fans and sign autographs, before going inside.\n\nThe Grévin has a surprise for him: the Mime Marceau, back that very morning from a several-month tour in the US, has arrived and will perform specially for Michael.\n\nUp goes the curtain: Bip mimes a sculptor and Michael's waxwork figure appears. Michael is moved to tears.

You delivered them all... I'll never forget it. I just want you to know that without you and my mother and father, I don't think we'd be here... and of course God.\"\n\nMichael also thanked his parents who were in the audience, \"Mother and father, you were there to protect us with unselfish love. Because you were there, we are here,\" he continued, \"Now we are in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, so... whatever you call our name... I promise, I love all of you. ... We'll be there!\"\n\nBerry Gordy: \"The Jackson 5 gave black kids in the ghetto a license to dream, and many of those same kids went on to realize their own dreams. They had something for everybody.\"\n\nParke Puterbaugh of the \"Rolling Stone\" magazine described the scene as, \"Gordy and Michael are paying each other the highest tribute and compliments. It's almost more of a reconciliation than the Motown 25th Anniversary TV special. It really is quite a moment!\"\n\n“I’d like to say to our family, our children, our friends and most of all my mother and father. They’re here tonight, my mother and father. You were there to protect us with unselfish love. Because you were there, we are here. Barry Gordy, I love you. Like Diana Ross, you were there and now again, you are here. I’m crazy about you. Barry, would you please join us up here right now? Barry Gordy I want you to know, in my heart and mind, you are a genius and a king, & without you Barry Gordy, I don’t think music would be the same today. Barry Gordy, you promised us four consecutive #1 records, and you delivered them all. I’ll never forget it. It was a first in music history and now there’s many more singles that went #1 for the Jackson Five. Single after single. Your faith makes it possible for us to be here today. We love you from the bottom of our hearts, sincerely, and I just want you to know that without you, my mother and my father, I don’t think we would be here. And of course, God. And to all the fans … you were there unconditionally and I say thank you very much. Now we are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, so whenever you call our name, I promise, I love all of you, we’ll be there.”\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nhttp://rockhall.com/inductees/the-jackson-five/\n\nhttp://shannonjai.tumblr.com/post/22596969211/the-jackson-5-were-inducted-into-the-rock-roll\n\nMichael Jackson &The Jackson 5 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 1997\n\n[video=youtube;-2HgGwBUkkY]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2HgGwBUkkY[/video]\n\n1998\n\nWorld Karate Promotion Foundation (WKPF):\n\nHonorary 5th dan in Karate\n\nGodan (fifth degree) black belt\n\nMichael jackson received the Honorary 5th dan in Karate during a high-level event in Tokyo, in 1998, where Mr. Jackson was honorary guest, and the protocol event was organised for about 1000 guests.\n\nThis significant event - attended by the prime group of the Japanese social, economic and political life &#8211; was organised for celebrating the creation of World Karate Promotion Foundation (WKPF). WKPF was established by a considerable number of businessmen with the aim of turning Karate, the Japanese national sport, to olympic sport.\n\nThe guests of honour of the opening ceremony of the campaign were: Michael Jackson and George Popper, who was this time the Executive President of WKPF and also of IBSSA, and Secretary General of the European Karate Federation.\n\nHereafter Michael jackson, the artist played a major role in the battle for recognition of karate as an olympic sport, which has now become current again.\n\nAlso known fact is that Michael Jackson kept on doing significant humanitarian activities in his country as well as abroad.\n\nhttp://www.ibssa.org/index.php?article_id=547\n\nMichael Jackson In Japan 1998 Promo\n\n[video=youtube;046WlGWECg8]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=046WlGWECg8&feature=player_embedded[/video]\n\nIn 1998, Chodoin presented Michael with the Honorary Chairmanship of the United World Karate Association and a godan (fifth degree) black belt.\n\nUnited World Karate Association President Daikaku Chodoin\n\nDaikaku Chodoin, 68, is the founder and president of the United World Karate Association, which combines all five iemoto (the traditional branches of the martial art) with an estimated 50 million practitioners around the world. A kyuudan (9th degree black belt) of Goju-ryu, one of Okinawa's \"hard-soft\" karate styles, Chodoin is a fearless fighter who thrives on going to battle both on and off the dojo floor. His winning streak began in his 20s: He first struck gold with shipbuilding and later made a killing with real estate and stocks. He has used his vast fortune to fight racial discrimination and supported revolutionary movements in Africa, South America and the Middle East. In 1985 Chodoin established the World Black Congress in order to unite Africans and that same year he created the Society of International Outer Space Law to draw up a legal framework that would give all nations equal right to space. Chodoin's desire to heal and save the world struck a chord with Michael Jackson: Since their first meeting in 1997, The King of Pop and the King of karate got along royally.\n\nIn 1998, Chodoin presented Michael with the Honorary Chairmanship of the United World Karate Association and a godan (fifth degree) black belt.\n\nOnce you learn how to keep secrets, you will hear many. I arranged everything for Michael's visit. When his plane landed, we had a car drive up to it on the tarmac and rode straight into Tokyo. He stayed in a hotel but was usually at my office. We talked and did karate for three days. Nobody knew he was here, and he loved this fact.\n\nA phone call should not be longer than 10 seconds. That is enough time to say hi, thinking of you, me too, great, bye, bye. Michael has been calling me for 13 years, a couple of times a year. I'm sorry he's gone. We won't be talking anymore, but we're still connected.\n\nIt is rich people's duty to support artists. Michael was a genius in art and business. When he said he was in a jam, I felt like when you stand by a Shinto shrine, happy to throw money into the altar. For me, he was a messenger of the universe. I gave him about 20 million dollars in seven installments, and it never occurred to me that I would ever see that money again. My contribution was a fraction of what others gave him.\n\nKarate, like other sports, eliminates discrimination. Regardless of color, race or gender, all people who do karate respect each other's strength and ability. Michael asked me to show him some karate moves. He could do them immediately, totally perfectly. He could have been a brilliant athlete. I asked Michael to help me put karate into the Olympics Games. He talked to International Olympic Committee chairman, Juan Antonio Samaranch and we were told that if we could unite all the sects of the martial art, karate had a chance to be an Olympic sport. Hopefully 2016 will be our year.\n\nhttp://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20090709jk.html\n\nMichael Jackson was a Knight of Malta, as clearly visible in the picture that he wore the crowned Maltese cross.

When I later met him and his children for dinner, my feelings were reinforced that this was a good man who was incredibly misunderstood by the public. Michael Jackson spoke of his admiration of Mahatma Gandhi,non-violence and later mentioned his interest in Hindi films.\n\nMichael Jackson received the award for \"Outstanding Contribution to Global Music and Entertainment\" at the first Bollywood awards ceremony in 1999.\n\nThe only Indian mega event held in the U.S. which Michael Jackson attended was the Bollywood Awards at the Nassau Coliseum in New York. The packed to the rafters audience broke into raptures, the moment he walked to the stage. Shah Rukh Khan,Juhi Chawla,Shilpa Shetty, Javed Jaffrey, Arshad Warsi were among the stars who performed at this event. \"I distinctly remember introducing Michael Jackson to Farah Khan as India's number 1 Choreographer. He was thoroughly impressed by her. He was truly a fan of Indian culture and tradition.\" Said Mr Kamal Dandona.\n\nKamal Dandona added \"Michael Jacksons unsurpassed creativity and immensely loved music brought happiness to every corner of the world. It was a true privilege and honor for me to have met him and known him as one of the most talented superstars in the history of music. \"\n\nhttp://hamaraphotos.com/bollywood/scoops/indians-in-america-remember-michael-jackson.html\n\nMichael Jackson:\n\n\" Thank you very much for this honor you have awarded me tonight. I've always believed that the real measure of celebrity success was not just how famous he becomes, but what he does with that fame and fortune. Especially in today's technological and media advanced society, the attention and fortune showered on an individual celebrity is often times immensely disproportionate to his or her achievements. Today a person can literally become a celebrity overnight throughout the entire world, and that kind of attention can be difficult for an individual to handle. But I have also learned that such fame can also be an enormous, effective medium to focus attention and mobilize resources for a worthy cause. I have been blessed with so much and have an opportunity to do what few others can. But I believe it is more than just an opportunity, but a duty. I feel to reap and enjoy the fruits of my talent for myself would be selfish, irresponsible, and unconscionable. In these days of such abundance and advancement in what we can do, it pains me to think that we do so little for our children. In some ways I feel undeserving to receive an award for doing something that is my duty. I accept this award as a gesture of encouraging from the people of India and a commission to do more for mankind. I love you very much.\n\nIs this the longest speech?\n\nMahatma Ghandi knew how important bringing the world's attention was to gaining freedom for India without using any weapons. In some ways he was the first person to truly understand the importance and power of the public. He has always been an inspiration to me, and it gives me even greater joy and pride to be recognized by his people. I am here today inspiration for my Hinduja. Mr. Hindunja and your lovely family. I love you very much. We have the same mission to bring world peace. Kamal Dunduna has created a great show. Mahnice, thank you for your wonderful costume, I appreciate it very much. I love you all.

He is being introduced by Prince Albert of Monaco, who makes a summary of his life and career achievements:\n\nPrince Albert: “I am very pleased to present the 2000 Millenium Award to an artist whose music, generosity, and unmatched showmanship has lent color and brightness to the 20th century. A thousand years from now, when the history of popular music is examined, no single performer will be as remembered and as celebrated as Michael Jackson. Its rare for a child performer to be successful in his adult career and then still that career to take off into the stratosphere as Michael’s did. And at the close of the century he has sold more records around the world than any single artist in the history of the medium….. His influentual song ‘We Are The World’ and his international ‘Heal The World Foundation’ are just two of his many charitable efforts that have raised millions of $ for hundreds of important causes. Simply put Michael Jackson’s influence on entertainment, on charity and in fact on our entire culture is absolutely immeasurable. As we enter the 21st century we can look forward to even more outstanding achievements in music and feature films from this incredibly talented artist. It’s been a privilege to witness Michael’s dazzling journey over the years which has transformed him from a singer to a superstar and from a charming little boy to a dignified man.”\n\n(Video intro to ‘Childhood’ and ‘Beat It’.

Actually I'd say it's pretty incredible. And incredible describes our next honoree. This is the part were we are supposed to tell you about the career of our guest of honour, but if you don't know who he is, what planet are you from? He's not only one of the greatest artists of age, a star for the ages is what he really is. His Thriller album is the greatest selling album in the history of the world. And his song 'We Are The World' sold 800,000 copies in 3 days. His records actually set records. As members of a new generation of pop artists we stand before him with the deepest sense of gratitude and humility. He's influenced our musical choices but more importantly he has influenced our personal choices.\n\nNo artist does as much to make the world a better place, and no other celebrity is more humble about his good work. What else can I say about him, he's bad, he's a thriller, and he's here. The greatest living recording artist in the world, number one superstar. King of Pop.

And it is only when we join together on evenings like this, that we can summon the courage and determination to stop it from ever robbing another child of the precious gift of life or a parent of the joy of watching their child grow.

The museum is part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was created April 20, 1983.\n\nCleveland lobbied hard to be chosen, citing that Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed is widely credited with promoting the new genre (and the term) of \"rock and roll\", and that Cleveland was the location of the first rock and roll concert.\n\nArchitect I. M. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200 ft (61 m) high, but it had to be cut down to 162 ft (49 m) due to its proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2). The groundbreaking ceremony was June 7, 1993, with Pete Townshend and Chuck Berry doing the honors. The first curator of the Hall of Fame was Dr. Bruce Conforth, a former folk musician, rock musician, and artist who was also a professor of folklore, ethnomusicology, American Culture, and blues music. The museum opened on September 2, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, among others.\n\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit inside the museum's spire.\n\nThere are seven levels in the building. The first through fifth levels feature many permanent and temporary exhibits documenting the history of rock and roll. Temporary exhibits display items from artists that have only been borrowed for a short period of time, such as the Warped Tour display in 2007, showcasing memorabilia from the tour's 12 years in existence. The museum has also put up numerous musical films for viewing, such as 2007's temporary exhibit running George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh. Some of the permanent exhibits include a history of audio technology, a section of mannequins donning outfits of famous performers past and present, and an area which looks at music scenes in various cities throughout different eras.\n\nThe third level is where the actual Hall of Fame is located and includes a wall with all of the inductees' signatures. The seventh and final level of the building is a temporary exhibit which features a certain group or artist for a period of time. It occupies the entire floor, which is the smallest since it is at the top of the pyramid. Some of the artists featured include Elvis Presley, The Supremes, The Who, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, U2, Bob Dylan, The Clash, The Doors and Roy Orbison.\n\nWhile the museum is located in Cleveland, prior to 2009 the induction ceremony was annually held in New York City (except in 1993, when the ceremony was held in Los Angeles,[5] and in 1997, when the ceremony was held in Cleveland.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\" is an unordered list of 500 songs that they believe have been most influential in shaping the course of rock and roll, though some of them belong to different styles even after the consolidation of rock music (like some 1980s and 1990s rap songs). It was organized by Hall of Fame museum curator James Henke who, according to the hall, \"compiled the list with input from the museum&#8217;s curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts.\"[10] The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995.[11] The list contains songs from the 1920s through the 1990s. The Beatles are the most represented band on the list, with seven songs. Elvis Presley and The Rolling Stones each have six songs on the list, while The Beach Boys and Bob Dylan each have five\n\nHall of Fame.\n\nA handful of artists are inducted into the Hall of Fame in an annual induction ceremony, historically held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included James Brown, Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, The Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nCurrently, groups or individuals are qualified for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Nominees should have demonstrable influence and significance within the history of rock and roll. Four categories are recognized: Performers, Non-Performers, Early Influences, and Sidemen (as of 2000). However, fans have no input concerning who is nominated or elected to the hall.\n\nPerformers include singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds.\n\nA nominating committee composed of \"music historians\" selects names for the Performers category, which are then voted on by roughly a thousand \"experts\", including academics, journalists, producers, and \"others\" with music industry experience. Performers receiving the highest number of votes greater than 50% of the votes received are selected for induction; currently, five nominees make the cut each year, although that number has been higher in the past. The first person to perform inside the Rock Hall was the Los Angeles Producer/Guitarist Joe Solo, a native of the Cleveland suburb Shaker Heights.\n\nhttp://rockhall.com/\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame\n\nPhoto Galleries:\n\nMichael Jackson is inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame - for his achievements as a solo artist - at the sixteenth annual induction dinner. &#8216;N Sync are his presenters.\n\nMusicians become eligible for induction twenty-five years after the release of their first album, and sidemen become eligible twenty-five years after the commencement of their career. Michael was already inducted along with the rest of the Jackson 5 in 1997.\n\n2001 Induction Ceremony - http://rockhall.com/inductees/michael-jackson/\n\nThe enigmatic Michael Jackson showed up in what looked like a moon boot, telling the audience: \"There is not going to be any moon-walking tonight becauise I hurt my foot.\"\n\nJustin Timberlake on Michael Jackson:\n\n«That spark can only be held by Michael. He hold the Guinness Book of World Records for the most charities supported by a pop star and his devotion to children with cancer and children in orphanages is itself the stuff of legends. He&#8217;s got the longest span of #1 hits in the U.S. He shares the record for most Grammys won in a single year. He holds the record for an album going to #1 in more countries than any musician in history. He holds the record for the most #1 singles from an album, and he co-wrote the biggest-selling single of all time ... &#8220;We Are the World&#8221;. About two weeks ago, Michael established a new record ... his lecture launching a new charitable initiative ... &#8220;Heal the Kids&#8221; ... at Oxford University was the largest and most-covered event in Oxford 900-year history. For the past 25 years, Michael Jackson has been the man in the mirror. He thrilled us with &#8220;Thriller&#8221;, the largest-selling album of all time, beat us at our own game with &#8220;Beat It&#8221;, he rocked us to our souls with &#8220;Rock With Me&#8221;. He&#8217;s bad, he&#8217;s dangerous and if he thinks we&#8217;re going to let him stop because we&#8217;ve had enough ... as they so often say in this city ... &#8220;fageddaboudit.&#8221; There ain&#8217;t no stopping, there ain&#8217;t no enough. He&#8217;s the King of Pop ... the one, the only, Michael Jackson.»\n\nMichael Jackson Assepting:\n\n\"Thank you so very much. Thank you N&#8217;Synch. I am so proud to call you my friends, you&#8217;re all so wonderful. This is such a tremendous honor and I am so happy to be here, as you can see. There is not going to be any moon-walking tonight because I hurt my foot ... I fell down the stairs in California and I broke my foot in two places, so I have about 6 more weeks with this cast, but it&#8217;s going to come off soon. I&#8217;m honored to be inducted twice in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It&#8217;s a great blessing. For me, the gift of music has been a great blessing from God, from the time I was a child, so I first of all would like to thank my parents who gave me that gift. To my mother Catherine, and to my father Joseph Jackson, I love you both. To my brothers and my sisters, thank you ... you are so wonderful. Rabbi Schmoolie, I love you, and thank you for helping me launch &#8220;Heal the Kids&#8221;.

He was so important in our lives and he was my real inspiration and I owe him so much. Quincy Jones, thank you. You talk about a thriller, Quincy, you&#8217;re incredible, I love you Quincy. He is the man. The glamorous and talented and beautiful Diana Ross, who is my second mother, I thank you. Thank you Tony Jones ... Bob Jones for all you have done ... John McClain you are a genius.

It is the achievement of perfection. It is crafting a work that exists beyond space and time. This is the quality that is inherent in the artistry of Michael Jackson. It has enabled him to be a leading force in music for over thirty years.\n\nThe MJ 30th Anniversary Award is an award for Michael from YOU - the fans - celebrating him being on stage for 30 years! On the occasion of his 30th year in music, film, and dance, hundreds of Michael's fans from thirty-two countries around the world have assembled via the internet to commission sculptor Nijel, BPG to create for MJ... the ultimate fan tribute. Thanks to fans all over the world, who donated for this award to being created, the dream of this award became a beautiful reality! This award is extra special because many of you helped in its creation.\n\nThe award is not just an award, it is also an amazing work of art! It was sculpted by the wonderful artist Nijel, BPG.\n\nI am exceedingly proud and eternally grateful to Deborah Dannelly, President of the Michael Jackson Fan Club and the hundreds of Michael Jackson fans representing millions more around the world, who commissioned me to create this special tribute to the greatest entertainer on Earth.\n\nFans from the following countries participated in the funding of this special award (alphabetical order): Afghanistan, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Germany, Guyana, Hungary, India, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, New Zeland, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Tunisia, UK, USA (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin)\n\nPeace and Love,\n\nNijel BPG\n\nTogether with the award Michael was given a scroll listing name, country, and age of each fan that contributed money towards the award. It included a detailed description of the award explaining what it's specific parts stand for. Below is the wording.\n\nThe Sun that shines over the land\n\nMichael, have you ever wondered how much your fans really love you? Have you ever wondered if you have made any impact at all on our lives? Well, tonight, you can stop wondering because your fans from all around the world have joined together and decided that it was time that we say \"Thank You!\" This sculpture has been created entirely by donations from your fans. Our desire is that it be presented to you as a token of our enduring love and admiration. This is our way of saying \"Thank You\" for all that you have meant in each of our lives; for EVERYTHING that you have done over the past 30 years: thank you for the music; thank you for the dance; thank you for reminding us to help each other; and thank you for teaching us how to come together as one!\n\nDesigned and sculpted by the artist Nijel BPG, the award contains several unique symbols. It is constructed of black granite, silver plated bronze, acrylic, stainless steel and pearl, which is a traditional 30th anniversary element.\n\nAt the center of the award is a black pearl. It is symbolic of the pineal gland that is located in the center of our brain. The pineal gland is often called the \"third eye\" of wisdom and insight. It is responsible for higher consciousness. This \"cosmic seed\" within your brain, Michael, has given birth to countless manifestations of song, dance, and video for over 30 years.\n\nTwo bands of energy spiral out from the pearl. They expand, and like the universe, swirl into infinity. Between the bands, are finely detailed sculptural works of art that capture highlights of your magic throughout several periods of your amazing career. The numbers and placement of these sculptures are specific. They indicate perfection and a mastery of the universal language of music. Therefore, a \"treble clef\" can be seen in the arrangement. The combined sculptures and the pearl seem to float in the encased acrylic disc like the sun with it's powerful energy whirling through space.\n\nThis \"solar disc\" sits on a half-moon stainless steel frame with three posts. They represent rays of energy emanating from the sun. They also provide pillars of support from your fans around the world. As your light shines over us, we your fans, have been and will always be your strongest and most faithful supporters.\n\nThe base is Zimbabwe black granite. Chosen for it's durability, this material proclaims that together, through thick and through thin, you and your fans around the world stand firmly on a solid bedrock of granite. The base represents planet Earth that is home to you Michael, our favorite son who shines over the land. In many cultures, granite is a sacred element. The ancient Maya and Aboriginal people have long known granite as a stone for protection. It is believed to help banish negative traits, and helps one to see and understand the bigger picture.\n\nFollowing is a list of names of the fans that contributed to the creation of this sculpture, along with their ages and countries. They have made it possible for this award to be presented to you in the name of all fans, worldwide...\n\nMaking of \"The Michael Jackson 30th Anniversary Fan Award\"\n\n[video=youtube;Lrq1I98LyjE]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrq1I98LyjE[/video]\n\nThe Michael Jackson Fan Club (MJFC) is proud to present the '30 Years of Magic' Fan Celebration. This is a once-in-a-lifetime event that will feature music, dancing, entertainment and most importantly - Michael Jackson!\n\nMichael has agreed to attend this event to thank his fans for all of their love and support during the past 30 years and to accept \"The Michael Jackson 30th Anniversary Fan Award\".\n\nUnfortunately the 'Michael Jackson 30th Anniversary Fan Award' could not be given to Michael at his 30th Anniversary Celebration concerts in New York (USA). The appointment was made for September 10, 2001 but due to Michael's very busy schedule and the following tragic events in New York, we were unable to present the award to him.\n\nInstead the award was presented to Michael on July 6, 2002 in New York City (USA) during the '30 Years of Magic' Fan Celebration.\n\nMichael is already looking forward to see his fans in New York on July 6, 2002. Read his letter:\n\nMay 30, 2002\n\nTo all My Loyal Fans:\n\nI am thrilled that I will, once again, have an opportunity to see all of the wonderful fans from around the world in New York, at Webster Hall, on Saturday, July 6,2002.\n\nFor your continued support, I thank you and send you add my love.\n\nSee you soon,\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nOn Saturday, July 6, 2002, at 4:30 pm (EST), a huge line began to form around Webster Hall in New York City for what will go down in 'HIStory' as a night not to soon be forgotten. This was the night that Michael Jackson would party with his fans to honor his accomplishments as a recording artist over the past 30 years.\n\nThe minute the doors opened at 5:00 pm, pandemonium errupted and many, many fans ran into the ballroom to find a spot in front of the stage. By 6:00 pm, the show began with a very special prayer from little William Hazelhurst. From that point on, Navi opened the show with an amazing MJ medley of songs, then Tom Fox swooned the crowd with two songs including an exceptional version of 'The Lady In My Life.'\n\nOther highlights of the evening were dancer Simone Maurice, Danny Oliver, the Jewel Dancers, Ahmad Buie with his awesome rendition of 'You Rock My World,' and Bling Dynasty who really rocked the crowd.\n\nAt roughly 8:30 pm, Michael Jackson arrived at Webster Hall and took his seat on the balcony. He was immediately met with wild, thunderous applause from the audience. Almost taking away the attention of the performance taking place on the main floor. Michael enjoyed much of the second half of the show and was visibly moved by E´Casanova´s performance and words of inspiration dedicated to Michael. Shortly after E'Casanova's performance, TMC and Belgium's own Christ'OF sent the crowd into a frenzy with his performance of MJ classics such as 'You Were There', 'Jam', and 'Billie Jean' just to name a few. But what had to be the most incredible moment of the show was the dance interpretation of 'Heal The World' which was performed by The Unity Kids Choir and the Creative Outlet Dancers. Michael was visibly moved by this performance and began singing along with the track.\n\nIn closing the show, Michael was presented with a very special '30th Anniversary Fan Award' that fans from around the world helped to create. Nijel, the designer of the award, addressed the crowd and presented Michael with this award. Michael was very humbled by this award and took the opportunity to thank the fans for making this moment possible and even stopped during portions of his speech to collect signs from the audience. He became partial to one which read, \"Tommy Mottola Go To Hell.\" Michael held the sign high and said, \"This says it all.\" And with a few additional words, he left the stage and the night came to a close.\n\nhttp://www.nijart.com/TheMichaelJackson30thAnniversaryFanAward.htm\n\nhttp://www.mjfanclub.net/home/index...&id=194:30th-anniversary-award-2001&Itemid=77\n\nhttp://mjjtime.blogspot.com/2010/07/today-in-mjj-history_06.html\n\nMichael Jackson 30th Anniversary Fan Award 2002\n\n[video=youtube;PtKYqIPrYFc]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtKYqIPrYFc[/video]\n\n2002\n\nMTV Video Music Awards:\n\nArtist of the Millennium\n\nAugust,29\n\nAt the MTV Video Music Awards, which took place at the Radio City Music Hall in New York on August 29, Michael Jackson received a special award. At the beginning of the MTV show, singer Britney Spears came on stage to present the award. As it was Michael Jackson's birthday there was a huge four-layer cake, white with black musical notes and silver stars positioned in the back. The award, a silver treble clef, was on the table with the cake.\n\nBritney Spears started with the following words:\n\n\"I am thrilled to be here with you in New York on such a special night. And it's more special because it just so happens to be someone special's birthday. This is someone who's inspired me and just about everyone in this room and the world. I consider him the artist of the millennium. He's a true innovator who pioneered the true art of music video, broke down countless barriers and sold more records than any other artist along the way. So, happy birthday my friend, the King Of Pop.\"\n\nThen Michael came on stage to the intro to Billie Jean and received a standing ovation from the audience. Wearing black pants, a red top with applications and white/golden knee pads, his hair was shoulder length and straight. He was smiling and looked very happy.\n\nMichael hugged Britney Spears, took the award from the table with the cake and walked to the microphone for his acceptance speech:\n\n\"Well...um...God Bless you. Um...I love you too [to the fans yelling at him]. Thank you very much, Britney Spears you're wonderful. If... when I was a little boy in Indiana, if someone had told me... if someone had told me that one day I would be getting, as a musician, the 'Artist Of The Millennium' award I wouldn't have believed it [laughs]. This is really amazing. I can't believe it. Thank you so very much.\n\nBut there's a couple of people I have to thank who made this possible [he reaches into his pocket for a piece of paper, and unfolds it]. First I'd like to thank God who makes all things possible. My mother, Joseph Jackson, Katherine Jackson, Trudy Green, Howard Koffman, the genius of John McClain, John Brenka, Berry Gordy, Diana Ross, Gladys Knight, Quincy Jones, I love you. David Blaine your magic is real and I believe in you. And I'd like to thank... I think James Brown is a genius. And all the fans around the world, I love you. God bless you. Thank you.\"\n\nThen Michael made the peace sign, took the award, looked again at the cake and exited the stage.\n\nhttp://www.mtv.com/videos/news/4048...tist-of-the-millennium-award.jhtml#id=1614830\n\nControversy\n\nThe same night there was a controversy as to whether or not MTV actually gave Jackson an award. MTV promised to honor Jackson by presenting him with a new, special award. Jackson showed up, helping to boost their ratings, while MTV later made a mockery of the entire event, when higher-ups had MTV pull the award to teach Jackson a lesson--this happened during the big falling out Jackson had with Sony Music.\n\nMTV pretended like Jackson went up on stage and gave himself an award, or had a \"misunderstanding\" of how he was being honored that night; his birthday by the way.\n\nBut apparently nobody warned to the guys running MTV's website that the award had been yanked or that Jackson was being made a fool out of because they posted the information about the Artist of the Millennium Award on MTV's site that night: \"Michael Jackson's unprecedented Artist of the Millenium award!\".\n\nThe next year MTV show, the presenters Fred Durst & Jack Black participated in a disgusting -- and rather unfunny actually -- parody of the event where he mocked Jackson, with Durst stating that Black was the \"funniest man alive.\"\n\nhttp://mjjtime.blogspot.com/search?q=August+29\n\nOn MTV site - http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/2002/\n\n2002 Video Music Awards\n\nWe traveled a few blocks downtown again to New York's Radio City Music Hall for the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, with Jimmy Fallon as the Master of Ceremonies. Because we like to start the show off with a bang, and we needed a way to shoehorn Michael Jackson into the show (really, check the rest of the archive, he's been here almost every single year!), we decided to celebrate Mr. Jackson's birthday.\n\nWe let uber-fan Britney Spears do the honor of presenting Michael with a birthday cake. Amidst all of the laudatory comments in her speech, Brit, not incorrectly, referred to Michael as \"the artist of the millennium.\" And that's where the confusion came in.\n\nMichael apparently got confused, not understanding the concept of his birthday or the big birthday cake on stage, and instead thought that MTV was honoring him with an Artist of the Millennium award. Uncomfortable hilarity ensued as Jackson accepted the non-existent honor with a stirring speech about his childhood in Indiana. For this priceless moment in VMA history, we've been trying to give him the Awkwardness of the Millennium Award ever since, but he never shows up to get that one.\n\nBut that wasn't the only uncomfortable moment of the night. Nope, we've got more of those. There was the unlikely duo of former Van Halen singers David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar presenting the Best Rock Video award. When Dave called their planned joint live outing \"the Celebrity Deathmatch tour,\" an annoyed Hagar stated flatly, \"I don't need the money, Dave!\"\n\nYet, we still have to recall the case of Eminem who had no less than three \"moments.\" The man born Marshall Mathers was the big winner, taking four Moonmen -- including Best Rap Video and Video of the Year for \"Without Me.\" When he won Best Male Video, his award was presented by Christina Aguilera, whom he had dissed in the lyrics of his hit, \"The Real Slim Shady.\" Awkward!\n\nThen Triumph the Insult Comic Dog used the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards to pick a fight with Eminem in the audience. The foul-mouthed pooch's bit was so offensive to Slim Shady that MTV later exorcized it from VMA rebroadcasts. We likewise removed the part where Eminem challenged Moby to a fight (the diminutive Moby had previously called the rapper's music misogynistic and homophobic). The audience sided with Moby on this one and rallied with a chorus of boos.\n\nTruly, the 2002 VMAs featured a myriad of instant-classic moments:\n\n&#8226; Justin Timberlake's first solo performance (\"Like I Love You\")\n\n&#8226; Pink's \"I'm too drunk for this\" acceptance of the Best Female Video award (\"Get the Party Started\")\n\n&#8226; Bruce Springsteen's show opening off-site performance outside and in the rain (\"The Rising\")\n\n&#8226; Christina Aguilera's very revealing outfit, which Jimmy Fallon described as \"her boobs wrapped in a napkin.\"\n\n&#8226; And finally, the return of Guns N' Roses to the stage, highlighted by the sight of Slash's replacement, Buckethead (so nicknamed for the large KFC bucket he wears on his head), on guitar. Weirdly and despite a braided Axl Rose who was severely winded by the end of \"Welcome to the Jungle,\" they still rocked.\n\nAdmit it, the VMAs are our own special brand of crazy, and you love it!\n\nhttp://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/2002/\n\nIn 2009, MTV retconned that he had indeed been honored with the Artist of the Millennium Award.\n\nYears after denying it and making hateful jokes about it, someone at MTV is apparently trying to come clean by admitting -- in a nondirect, cowardly way -- that the Michael Jackson did receive the \"Artist of the Millennium\" award in 2002.\n\nThe caption (see screenshot) underneath a picture of Michael Jackson that night reads: \"Britney Spears presents Michael Jackson with the Artist of the Millennium Award at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards\".\n\nNow after Jackson's gone, along with the subsequent outing of MTV as a racist network in the 80s for refusing to play black videos before Jackson broke through, apparently they are a little less tight lipped with the truth.\n\nAt the 2009 Video Music Awards ceremony, MTV even made a tribute show to honor Michael Jackson.\n\nAfter Madonna[rather unqualified for that task] opened the show talking about her experiences with Michael Jackson, the Michael Jackson tribute commenced, including Janet Jackson performing the duet \"Scream\" the duet she and Michael recorded together in 1995. Janet matched footage of brother&#8217;s dancing in the music video move-for-move as it played on a screen behind her. The show closed with a sneak preview of Michael Jackson's \"This Is It\" documentary movie.\n\nMTV's sudden realization of the power of Michael Jackson came too late... 7 years too late\n\nS&#1086;urce: http://site2.mjeol.com/mj-news/mtv-comes-clean-about-artist-of-the-millennium-award.html\n\nMTV VMA 2002 MJ's Speech - http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/4048...tist-of-the-millennium-award.jhtml#id=1614830\n\nMichael Jackson MTV Music Award 2002\n\n[video=youtube;P8a5UxwZCME]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8a5UxwZCME[/video]\n\n2002\n\nBambi Awards\n\nPop Artist Of The Millenium\n\nNovember 21\n\nThe BAMBI award was brought into being in 1948. In a time when the fabric of everyday life was weaved from resignation and ruins, the symbol of the deer gave people hope.\n\nOriginally, the BAMBI was a film prize for which the readers of Filmrevue magazine chose their favorite big screen star. As TV sets found their way into more and more homes, it became an accolade for the small screen too. The first prize winner was Marika Rökk, whose daughter gave the adorable animal its name: \"Oh my, that looks just like Bambi,\" she cried when she set eyes on the award. In those days, the trophy was made out of white porcelain. The bronze fawn plated in 18-carat gold has been used since 1958.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, the BAMBI award was extended to cover the full spectrum of the growing media world.\n\nEvery year, the BAMBI features a star-studded line-up of German and international guests. Stars who have walked the red carpet in recent times include Michael Jackson, Tom Cruise, Meg Ryan, Keanu Reeves and Eva Longoria. At the 2005 award ceremony, none other than Bill Clinton was honored with the Charity BAMBI. In 2006, the deer statuette in the same category went to Queen Sylvia of Sweden. There was further royal interest the following year as Queen Rania of Jordan won the Honorary BAMBI for her involvement in humanitarian projects. Among the best-known prize winners of the previous decade were Muhammad Ali and Seal, both of whom proved a big hit backstage. In 2003, the great boxing champion showed off with magic tricks and shadow boxing. A year later, Seal sang a duet with his future wife Heidi Klum, proving as captivating behind the scenes as he is on stage.\n\nThe BAMBI award, like its animal namesake, is a wandering beast and has moved around a lot in recent decades. “BAMBI goes Monte Carlo” was the motto in 1970, as the prize winners celebrated with Princess Grace of Monaco. In 1972, the deer and its entourage traveled by steamboat to Mainau Island on Lake Constance. The awards ceremony has also been held in the Bavarian Alps and in the ticket hall of Munich’s main train station.\n\nThe BAMBI fawn statuette, which switched from porcelain to bronze at an early stage, has hardly changed at all in more than six decades. For the millennium, its look was modernized by the artisan foundry studios Strassaker in the Swabian town of Süßen. But otherwise, BAMBI has remained true to its original design – as Germany’s most prestigious media award.\n\nhttp://www.bambi-awards.com/history/The-history-of-the-BAMBI-award_mtid_182.html\n\nThe Bambi, often simply called Bambi Awards and stylised as BAMBI, are presented annually by Hubert Burda Media to recognise excellence in international media and television \"with vision and creativity who affected and inspired the German public that year,\" both domestic and foreign.\n\nMarika Rökk and Jean Marais were the first recipients of the award. Frequent awardees include Heinz Rühmann , Peter Alexander and O. W. Fischer , Sophia Loren , Maria Schell (8). Rock Hudson. Franz Beckenbauer and Pierre Brice . The awards are judged by Hubert Burda and the editors-in-chief at Hubert Burda Media.\n\nIn 2002 Michael Jackson won the Pop Artist of the Millennium Award.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambi_(prize)\n\n2002 - Michael receives the \"Bambi Award For Pop Artist Of The Millenium\" in Germany, an award given out yearly to people with new visions and uplifting creativity. The ceremony is held at the Estrel Convention Center in Berlin.\n\nThe awards recognise outstanding personalities and performances in various fields, including show business, film, politics and sport. The Bambi award, which is given out yearly, honors people with new visions and creativity which give us hope, joy and energy.\n\nLinden-Lighting in Berlin. Michal Jackson looked down from his suite in the historical Hotel Adlon on Berlin's famous, magnificent boulevard 'Unter den Linden' on the very first Christmas illumination of this avenue. Two sponsors, the publisher Stephan Vogel and the cell-phone service provider Vodafone, made this fascinating event possible. The current mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit praised them: \"An exemplary event.\"\n\nMichael Jackson has come to the German capital to receive the \"Bambi Award\". This Award, in the forms of a gold-plated sculpture of a small baby-reindeer is for Germany just what is Oscar in Hollywood. Jackson received on Thursday, November 21, 2002 the \"Millennium Bambi\". The tennis star Boris Becker handed over the oldest German media award of the Burda Publishing company. About 1,000 guests of honor, who gathered in the Estrel Convention Center, greeted this with enthusiastic applause.\n\nTowards the end of the show parts of a video were shown which featured the charity song 'What More Can I Give'. The video featured stars recording parts of the song, including Celine Dion, Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin, Mya and others.\n\nThe honor for the 44-year old popstar with the boyish, shy voice was the high point at the end of the two-hour event.\n\nMichael was dressed in black pants and a sparkling black/red jacket and seemed very nervous. He handed the award back to Boris Becker, put on glasses and took some papers out of his pocket to make an acceptance speech:\n\n\"Thank you...Thank you...Thank you very much.\n\n(towards Boris Becker) How are you? (Becker: I'm well).\n\nThank you so much for the nice words.\n\nOh boy. (Michael takes reading glasses out of his pocket) I'm sorry, I have to wear these reading glasses. Oh Jesus...here we go.\n\nDear Dr. Burda, dear Dr. Turnhofer, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nI have wonderful memories of my visits to Germany. Coming back to Berlin...Berlin, a city so full of energy - it's very special to me.\n\nBerlin, ich liebe dich! (German for: Berlin, I love you!)\n\nSeptember 11 has changed our world. Not long ago the Berlin wall came down. But recently new walls have been built. In 1989, people in Germany said: \"Wir sind ein Volk.\" (German for: We are one nation.)\n\nWe are Germans. We are Armenians. French, Italian, Russian, American, Asian, African... many other nationalities. We are Christians, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu. We are black, we are white. We are a community of some many differences, so complex and yet so simple. We do not need to have war!!!\n\nAnd to the children of Germany I want to say this: We need you! The world needs you! Please go for your dreams. Whatever your ideals...you can become whatever you want to become. Become an astronaut or famous scientist, famous doctors. And of course become an artist...(he grins) ... and maybe you get a Bambi award like me.\n\nI want you to know that I love Germany and that you have a very special place in my heart. I love you so much ... really!\n\nAlways appreciate the gift of life. Be happy and have fun.\n\nI love you.\"\n\nMichael ended his speech by lifting aloft the award statuette and blowing a kiss to the audience.

We say surprisingly because the chart placements don't include 2001 where Invincible did the most damage at US retail - 1.5 million copies sold in two months.\n\nThe King of Pop's entries, according to Billboard include:\n\nThe Billboard 200\n\n#43 - Invincible Michael Jackson/Epic\n\nTop R&B/Hip-Hop Albums\n\n#8 - Invincible Michael Jackson/Epic\n\nHot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks\n\n#12 - Butterflies Michael Jackson/Epic\n\nBillboard R&B editor writes: \"One notable name on this year's recap is Michael Jackson, No. 12 for 2002 with Butterflies (Epic). The last time a Michael Jackson song was this high on an annual summary was in 1983, when Billie Jean was the No. 2 song of the year, and The Girl Is Mine, his duet with Paul McCartney, was No. 6.\"\n\nRegarding the album, Billboard reports: As on the singles recap, Michael Jackson did well in 2002. Invincible (Epic) made it into the top-10 at No. 8. The top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums artists are Eminem, Nelly, and Ludacris. At No. 4, Ashanti is the top female, followed by Mary J. Blige, and Alicia Keys. The top group is Big Tymers, followed by Nappy Roots and OutKast.\n\nOfficial News from MJNI\n\nBillboard Music Awards The famous Billboard Music Charts determined the winners for this once prominent awards show. Though it hasn't been a televised show since 2006, many of the recognized winners can still be found in the year end issue.\n\nDecember 9, 2002\n\nAfter much speculation, Michael Jackson did indeed appear at the 2002 Billboard Music Awards via a satellite feed from his Neverland Valley Ranch. Michael received a special award to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of his best-selling recording, 'Thriller,' which spent more weeks at No. 1 (37 weeks) than any other album in the history of The Billboard 200. The King of Pop was given a special honor to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of Thriller, still the world's largest selling album in history.\n\nMichael Jackson accepted his special Billboard award Monday night, via live satellite from his Neverland Valley Ranch.\n\nComedian Chris Tucker presented the award to Michael at the Ranch in what appeared to be the inside of a recording studio. It was preceded by an introduction that included a video montage of Thriller's videos and live performances.\n\nDuring the presentation, Chris read a laundry list of Thriller's major accomplishments, including an impressive 37 weeks at #1, 7 top 10 hits, 8 Grammy Awards and the first album to ever reach #1 on the R%B and Pop charts at the same time.\n\nChris and Michael also had some laughs together, as the Rush Hour star jokingly asked Michael if he could hold onto the award for a few days and telling the superstar that he plans on staying at Neverland.\n\nMichael thanked his friend Chris, Billboard Magazine and his fans. And even though the King of Pop was not in person to accept the award, the thunderous applause from the audience indicated that just a glimmer of the pop legend was enough to satisfy!\n\nCedric: All right everybody, it's that time. We're about to take a trip to the Neverland Ranch with my friend, Chris Tucker-y'all.\n\n[goes to Neverland Theater]\n\nChris Tucker: Twenty years ago Michael Jackson was already a successful artist with seven number one hits to his name, four with the Jackson 5 and three on his own. But nobody was prepared for what would come next ... [in Michael's voice] 'cause this is Thriller, Thriller ... [vocal sound effects]\n\nMichael Jackson: [laughing]\n\nChris Tucker: Sorry. 'Thriller' stayed on the Billboard 200 for nearly two years, spending a record 37 weeks at number one. It won dozens of awards including a record 8 Grammies. He gave me one of them. It set another Billboard record when seven of his nine tracks reached the top ten and Michael became the first artist at Billboard chart history to simultaneously and single handily album charts both on black and pop charts. I messed that up, I know y'all seen it but that's all right.\n\n[shows parts of 'Thriller' video and live, 'Beat It' video and live, 'Billie Jean' video and live and back to 'Thriller' video]\n\nChris Tucker: Quite simply, 'Thriller' still remains the biggest selling album in the history of the world, period. That's why I'm thrilled to present this award to the King Of Pop, Michael Jackson.\n\nMichael Jackson: Thank you so much. I'm very honored. I'm very happy. I thank all of the people that appreciate my work. I thank the Billboard Awards. I've always admired you. And to the fans around the world, I love you. I couldn't be me without you. Thank to God.

Michael arrived in a black limo with a great deal of security. Press was able to stand on the steps of the City Hall but a view of Michael, himself, was very hard due to security all around him. The fans waited across the street behind barriers. Michael exited the limo on the left side and began up the steps under the always present umbrella. Upon reaching the top of the steps, Michael turned and waved to his fans. Michael was dressed very nicely as he always does. He was wearing a black jacket with gold trim and black pants.\n\nGary Mayor, Scott King welcomed Michael back to Gary at a press conference at the city hall . Michael made the statement:\n\n\"It's great to be home. It's such a wonderful feeling. The hospitality is overwhelming. I left here at such a young age. I feel so much love. I love you all so much. Thank you for this wonderful, magical day that I'll never forget.\"\n\nHe then entered the City Hall to accept the key to the city and have a brief press conference. He stated this is his first trip back to Gary, Indiana since age 9 and he was very happy to be home. Scott L. King, Mayor of Gary presented the key to Michael and a street sign that said Jackson and said:\n\n\"Now that you have the key, you don't have to be a stranger.\"\n\nDuring a press conference with Gary Mayor Scott King it was announced that Michael would help develop a performing arts center for the city. The center will be named the 'Michael J. Jackson Performing Arts Center.' According to mayor King the singer will support the project in any role he feels comfortable with, for example helping with the design or fund-raising. Michael Jackson added that being back in his hometown gives him a \"wonderful feeling\" and that he feels so much love that he feels like a king.\n\nFollowing the press conference, Michael came outside and began shaking hands with the fans and signing autographs. He also accepted gifts and picked art work out of the crowd that caught his eye and he would point and say he wanted \"that one\" and his security would gather the pieces of art for him. Michael then stepped up on the top of his limo and walked from one end of the roof to the other. He actually lost his balance in the beginning however regained it rather quickly. The fans got a BIG kick out of this as, in my opinion, this was Michael's way of showing his enthusiasm for his fans who were able to make it to Gary.\n\nFans from all around the world gathered outside City Hall sang Michael's hits, including 'Billie Jean' and 'We Are The World.' A fan, Pete Carter from New Jersey, had dressed as Michael and entertained fans by dancing. He said\n\n\"I love his (Michael's) uniqueness. I've met him and he's a really nice guy... He's one of the only celebrities who will take the time and pay attention to his fans.\"\n\nMichael then made the short journey to his childhood home at 2300 Jackson street where he was met by numerous excited fans. Also present were members of the neighbourhood who were all just as excited to see him.\n\nHe greeted a relative, Tim Brown, who still resides in the house, a cousin of his father, Joe Jackson.\n\nInside, Michael would reminisced \"Tito slept there, Marlon slept there...\" In the living room, Michael told relatives, here \"we rehearsed, rehearsed and rehearsed all the time.\"\n\nGary resident Carol Walker said that she last saw Michael in the 1960's as he climbed a tree in the front yard. His brothers were busy loading and arranging musical instruments in the family van, she said.\n\n\"We've been waiting so many years (for his return). It's important for the kids. He can come back and tell us what he has gone through since he left Gary.\"\n\n*\n\nMichael Jackson visited Roosevelt High School today in Gary, Indiana and received an Honorary High School Diploma. At the school he told students that \"with a will of iron, with perseverance and determination\" they can do anything they want.\n\nThe school band played a medley of Michael’s hits to which he snaked his neck as the crowd clapped.\n\nThe reactions of tough, street-wise kids with chains and plaits revealed the extent of the King of Pop’s ability to transcend genre, generation and the urban divide.In an interview with the Post-Tribune on 12th June, 18 year old Roosevelt graduate Anthony Lillard said \"He goes beyond stereotypes. I like the way he carries himself.\"\n\nIn typical Michael Jackson style, the King of Pop next made an impromptu stop at a KFC fast-food restaurant where he spoke with fans from the safety of his limo whilst several companions went inside to order a huge meal.\n\nGary resident Selletta Hinton revealed in the Chicago Sun Times on the 12th June how Michael had invited her and her 5 year old daughter, Destiny, to join the feast in his limo saying he was \"more afriad of the press than the fans.\"\n\nAfter eating, Michael asked an associate to distribute what was left of the meal to the children in the crowd outside.\n\nIn the evening, the King of Pop spoke briefly at a 'Salute The Troops' celebration at a nearly full Railcats Stadium, nearby.\n\nThe King of Pop was anxious to stress the fondness he feels for his hometown and, according to a report in the North West Indiana Times on 12th June, told the 4,000 strong crowd: \"Gary, you will always have a special place in my heart. And you are more the just a good friend. You are my family, and I love you very much.\"\n\nHe continued: \"After many years of talking about coming home, Gary, I came home.\"\n\nThe crowd showed their appreciation with applause and cheers at which point Michael said Gary is the \"soul of America\" and that he was \"proud to be from Gary.\"\n\nhttp://www.allmichaeljackson.com/newsjune03.html\n\nhttp://www.mjfanclub.net/home/index...cle&id=167:2003-june&catid=166:2003&Itemid=75\n\nMichael Jackson Gary, Indiana Visit, June 11, 2003\n\n[video=youtube;g6Op-EoUgXo]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6Op-EoUgXo[/video]\n\n2003\n\nKey To The City\n\nMichael Jackson honored with the Key To The City by the Mayor of Las Vegas\n\nOctober 25\n\nMichael Jackson is awarded the Key to the City of Las Vegas, Nevada by the Mayor Goodman at Art Of Music Store.

The ceremony began about an hour later than the original 3:00 time with the King Of Pop being introduced by one of the leading tribute artists, E Cassanova.\n\nMichael spoke briefly, thanking the Mayor and the audience, telling the fans that \"I love you more.\" He then walked through the crowd, greeting the fans and signing autographs. Michael definitely looked 'Bad,' wearing silver boots, black pants, red beaded applique shirt and double belts along with the traditional sunglasses!\n\nThe presentation was under way as E'Cassanova said a few words to Michael´s adoring fans! One of the keynote statements E'Cassanova made to the screaming crowd was \"Michael Jackson fans don't die, we multiply!\" He then introduced The Mayor Goodman who then presented Michael Jackson with the Key to the city. Michael made a brief speech by thanking the fans for their support. Michael also collected various signs and banners from the fans.\n\nBut after the ceremonies, and away from the crowd, Mayor Goodman told MJ how much he belives in him. He told MJ that he was so proud that Michael would come to the city, and be accessible to the public. He went on to say that MJ is one of the greatest people in the world, and he was going to make it his business to tell everybody how special MJ was. And would you believe it... he then begged MJ for tickets (for his daughter) to the RMAs.\n\nMichael Jackson returned to the Art of Music store Saturday evening to be present at a special sale of his memorabilia. The holders of pre-purchased passes were given the opportunity to buy items and have them signed by Michael. Dennis Rodman was among those present at the event.\n\nThe wide, clear glass windows afforded fans a great view of the goings - on inside. Typical of his good heart, however, Michael did not abandon the fans who gathered to see him. He stepped outside twice to meet and greet fans and sign autographs.\n\nMichael was in wonderful spirits and was excited to meet with the fans once again. Tee shirts were also given out to the fans, featuring the RMA award logo on the front and the 'What More Can I Give' art on the back.\n\nMichael Jackson's Other Neverland:\n\nMichael Jackson's roots run deep in Las Vegas, now he holds a key to the city. Michael Jackson never performed an actual ticketed show in Las Vegas during his adult career. But he had a high profile in the city as a frequent visitor and, also a resident. His association with Las Vegas began during the Jackson 5 era and continued to recent recordings in the studio at the Palms.\n\nA teenage Jackson and his brothers performed on the Strip as the Jackson 5, starting in April 1974 at the original MGM Grand (now Bally's). They performed at the hotel several times that year.\n\nThe closest Michael came to a ticketed performance was in February 1994, when \"The Jackson Family Honors\" was taped in front of a live audience at the MGM Grand Garden arena for an NBC special.\n\nhttp://www.mjfanclub.net/home/index...&id=163:2003-october&catid=166:2003&Itemid=75\n\nhttp://mjjtime.blogspot.com/2010/10/today-in-mjj-history_25.html\n\nMichael Jackson Receives Key To The City Of Las Vegas 2003\n\n[video=youtube;WaJOOcYhiK4]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaJOOcYhiK4[/video]\n\n[video=youtube;-h4OKltg6Bw]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h4OKltg6Bw[/video]\n\n2003\n\nRadio Music Awards\n\nHumanitarian Award\n\nOctober 27\n\nOn Monday, October 27, 2003, Michael Jackson received the 'Radio Music Awards’ first Humanitarian Award.\n\nThe award was presented to him by pop singer Beyonce’ Knowles.
