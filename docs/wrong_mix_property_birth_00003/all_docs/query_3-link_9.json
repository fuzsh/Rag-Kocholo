        "text": "About Gary Allan Sojka\n\nGary A. Sojka received his B.A. from Coe College in Iowa. He continued on to earn his M.S. and subsequently his Ph.D. from Purdue University.\n\nSojka’s career in academics began at Indiana University. He started as a Biology Research Associate only to work his way through the ranks of Assistant and Associate professors to full Professor of Biology at I.U. It was not long after that he became the Chairman of Biology in Bloomington, and then the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. In 1984, Sojka left Indiana University to become the President of Bucknell University, and then to become the President of the Pennsylvania Association of Colleges and Universities in 1995. Though Dr. Sojka’s principal training was in genetics, microbiology, and cellular biochemistry, his research related to the domestication of plants and animals. Whether at Bucknell University or I.U., he taught courses on all these subjects, as well as on general biology.\n\nAmong his many awards, Sojka holds an honorary Doctorate of Laws from Lycoming College, and an honorary Doctor of Science from his alma mater, Purdue University. Sojka is also the recipient of the “Sheep Skin Award for Service to Higher Education from the Pennsylvania Association of Colleges and Universities and the Adam Smith Award from Economics Pennsylvania. While at Bucknell, he has been awarded the Eastern College Athletic Conference Award of Appreciation, the Lavender Heart Award, the Gary Sojka Award, a special award from the Black Alumni Association and an honorary membership into the Bucknell Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa."
