        "text": "The life of a writer is buoyed, fraught, consumed, or scarred by the drama of recognition. Most writers never achieve it. Some are ahead of their time and miss it. Others will not see their work published before they die. And some simply suffer from bad timing. The Guatemalan novelist Miguel Ángel Asturias was among the latter. He invented an entirely new literary language, feeding on European avant-garde movements of the nineteen-twenties, that combined political reality, myth, poetry, theatre, silent cinema, indigenous cultures, and dreams. It’s not as if he didn’t get rosettes: he was the first Latin American novelist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, and one of only three writers to be awarded both a Nobel and the Lenin Peace Prize. But, “from the very moment” he received the Nobel, his “star began to wane, and he has never again been at the center of Latin American literary attention,” according to Gerald Martin, the Andrew W. Mellon Professor Emeritus of Modern Languages at the University of Pittsburgh and an expert on Asturias’s work.\n\nStill, a formidable new English translation of his crucial work, the dictator novel “El Señor Presidente” —“Mr. President” in this edition—by the Guatemalan American writer David Unger, published in July by Penguin Classics, with an introduction by Martin, may return him to the status that is his due. This time, the story speaks not only to Latin America’s cycles of tyranny but to a United States and a Europe confronting, for the first time since it was published, in 1946, a new wave of authoritarian leaders on the rise.\n\nAsturias was born in Guatemala City, in 1899, a year after President Manuel Estrada Cabrera took office. Estrada Cabrera ruled by terror, running a network of secret police, and persecuting, torturing, and killing political opponents, while delivering control of the country’s resources to the United Fruit Company, the American corporation that acted as a de-facto colonial power in Central America during the early and mid-twentieth century. Asturias’s father, a judge, opposed Estrada Cabrera’s abuses at the cost of his job and, when Asturias was a child, was sent to internal exile in a rural area, where the future writer first encountered indigenous cultures. Estrada Cabrera was finally ousted, in 1920, and was tried and sentenced. Asturias discovered the full brutality of Estrada Cabrera’s regime while working as a secretary for the tribunal that condemned him; Asturias was even with a group that interviewed the former dictator in prison. That experience informed a short story, “Political Beggars,” that Asturias wrote in the early twenties and which, in time, became the first chapter of “El Señor Presidente.”\n\nAfter another dictator, General José María Orellana, seized power, in 1921, Asturias moved first to London and then to Paris, where he spent the next decade. He studied Popol Vuh, a sacred text of the Maya, at the Sorbonne, and connected with Surrealism and the avant garde. He met Picasso, James Joyce, Paul Valéry, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Jiddu Krishnamurti. Asturias did some of his best writing during that time: “Legends of Guatemala,” a collection of nine stories based on Mayan myths, which was published in Spanish in 1930, and, two years later, in a French translation with a preface by Valéry; a draft of “The Bejeweled Boy,” a novel that is also a memoir of his childhood; parts of the novel “Men of Maize,” which was eventually published in 1949; and “El Señor Presidente,” which he finished in 1932. Sergio Ramírez, Nicaragua’s best-known living writer and a former Vice-President of the country, told me that Asturias “transposed the experimentation of the Surrealist language into Spanish, just as Rubén Darío had done with the French language during the Modernist era.” He added that, in Paris, Asturias and Darío“discovered the atmosphere and reality of Latin America,” as have so many others from the region, the Cuban Alejo Carpentier and the Argentine Julio Cortázar, among them.\n\n“El Señor Presidente” tells the story of an unnamed country ruled by an unnamed man, who makes very few appearances in the novel himself, but whose presence configures and dooms every breath of life in the country. Nothing, including dreams and inner feelings, escapes his touch. Everyone lives in terror. The story begins, in a stunningly poetic opening scene, with the accidental murder of a colonel who is close to the President, and the President’s decision to frame two men he wants to see dead—a retired general and a lawyer—for the colonel’s death. He tasks his confidant, Miguel Angel Face, with alerting the retired general to his imminent capture—the President plans to have him killed as he flees, an action he will point to as proof of the general’s guilt. The novel follows a number of other characters, including the general’s daughter, Camila, with whom Miguel Angel Face falls in love, tragically. But what makes “El Señor Presidente” a “tour de force of great originality,” as the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa notes in a foreword to the new translation, is not its plot but its use of language, with invented words, songs, rhythms, and “astonishing metaphors”:\n\nA drum beats where noses aren’t blown, tracing drumsticks in the wind academy, it is a drum . . . top, it isn’t a drum; it’s a handkerchief knocking on a door and the hand of a brass knocker! The knocks penetrate like drill bits, perforating all sides of the house’s intestinal silence . . . knock . . . knock . . . knock . . . house drum. Each house has its own door-knocker to call its dwellers and when it’s closed, they’re living death . . . shebang of the house . . . door . . . shebang of the house . . . The fountain water becomes all eyes when it hears the doorknockdrum angrily telling servants . . . “Knocking again!” and the walls echo back over and over again: “Knocking again! Go ooopen!” “Knocking again! Gooo ooopen! and the ashes grow restless, not able to stir the cat, the lookout, with a soft shiver sent behind the bars of the grate, and the roses grow agitated, innocent victims of the inflexibility of thorns, and mirrors speak lively like a rapt medium through the souls of the dead furniture: “Knocking! Gooo open!”\n\nAsturias seemed bound for success. But Latin American dreams tend to soar and collapse as quickly as the continent’s commodities. A slump in the price of coffee worsened the economic crisis in Guatemala, making it, Martin writes, “impossible for middle-class Guatemalans to sustain themselves abroad,” and forcing Asturias to make an unhappy return home, in 1933. By then, the country was ruled by yet another dictator, Jorge Ubico, who remained in power for more than a decade. Stuck in Guatemala, Asturias did not publish any of his work during that time, including “El Señor Presidente,” which, though based on Estrada Cabrera, could easily have been read to refer to Ubico.\n\nIt wasn’t until after the Second World War, and after Asturias had published a Mexican edition of the novel to little notice, in 1946, and had moved to Argentina the following year, that he managed to get the book out to international acclaim. Recognition, however, did not equal comprehension: appearing in a completely different context from the one in which it was created, “El Señor Presidente” was cheered not as an extraordinary literary achievement but as an “engaged” (the Sartrean term then in vogue) exposé of Latin American injustice. Asturias himself contributed to this reading of his work by publishing three novels, sometimes called the “Banana Trilogy”—“Strong Wind” (1950), “The Green Pope” (1954), and “The Eyes of the Interred” (1960)—about the United Fruit Company’s nefarious role in Guatemala. When Argentina came under military rule in 1962, Asturias was forced to relocate again, this time to Italy. In 1966, he was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize for the “Banana Trilogy,” and he won the Nobel the next year, just as the Latin American Boom was booming.\n\nThe Boom was a period of almost two decades, the nineteen-sixties and seventies, during which a group of relatively young writers produced hugely innovative and influential work. Cortázar; Vargas Llosa; Gabriel García Márquez, of Colombia; and Carlos Fuentes, of Mexico, are its best-known authors, although there were many others. Asturias was their natural predecessor. To begin with, he is credited with the invention, especially in “Legends of Guatemala” and “Men of Maize,” of Latin American magical realism—a genre widely identified with the Boom, owing to García Márquez’s prominence in it—specifically as a way to depict the region’s sense of absurdity in confronting its reality. Martin, who is the author of a celebrated biography of García Marquez (and is at work on a biography of Vargas Llosa), asks in his prologue to “Mr. President”: “What is magical realism, if not the solution to writing novels about hybrid societies in which a dominant culture of European origin is juxtaposed in multiple ways with one or more different cultures that in many cases are ‘premodern’?” He concludes, “It was not Gabriel García Márquez who invented magical realism; it was Miguel Ángel Asturias.” “Guatemalans are a mestizo culture; we live between two cultures,” Lucrecia Méndez de Penedo, a Guatemalan literary scholar and critic who is a member of the Guatemalan Academy of the Language, told me. “Asturias lived in an indigenous rural area as a child. Through magical realism, he tried to explain this identity, which has been referred to as a ‘split identity.’ ”\n\n“El Señor Presidente,” for its part, is widely considered to be the first Latin American dictator novel. (Some literary historians also cite “Tirano Banderas,” a 1926 novel about the demise of a dictator in a fictitious Latin American country, by the Spanish writer Ramón del Valle-Inclán.) The genre is quintessentially Latin American, and is explored in a number of works by Boom authors, such as Carpentier’s “El Recurso del Método” (1974), translated into English as “Reasons of State”), Augusto Roa Bastos’s “I, the Supreme” (1974), García Márquez’s “The Autumn of the Patriarch” (1975), and Vargas Llosa’s “The Feast of the Goat” (2000).\n\nFor all these reasons, Martin says, “El Señor Presidente” is “an archetypal Latin American novel,” and its first lines “are the first lines of the Boom.” And yet, many of the Boom authors, starting with García Márquez, dismissed Asturias’s work as archaic, and denied that it had any influence on their writing. Asturias didn’t help matters when, during an interview, he agreed with a suggestion that García Márquez, in “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” had been heavily influenced by Balzac’s “The Quest of the Absolute,” a comment for which he was widely denounced. He was also accused of political opportunism for serving as Guatemala’s Ambassador to France, from 1966 to ’70, under President Julio Méndez Montenegro, who was democratically elected but ended up conducting a repressive government. (Asturias thought the government offered a chance to save democracy in Guatemala, and had consulted with the exiled President Jacobo Árbenz about remaining in the position.) But Martin and Ramírez both say that part of the reason for the literary “parricide” was that the major figures of the Boom saw themselves as belonging to a completely new movement—one that had no precedent. Asturias died in Spain, in 1974, and was largely forgotten. According to Ramírez and Méndez de Penedo, his work is mostly read in Guatemala today only because it’s suggested reading in high school.\n\n“El Señor Presidente” never had a big following in this country. It was first introduced to English-speaking audiences in 1962, as “The President,” in a translation by Frances Partridge, an English writer associated with the Bloomsbury Group. David Unger, who is a novelist, a poet, as well as a translator—and runs the publishing-certificate program at City College—told me that Partridge’s version is “full of Anglicisms,” and doesn’t feel authentic to Asturias’s voice. Francisco Goldman, a Guatemalan American author whose work includes the novel “Monkey Boy,” and who was a finalist for the 2022 Pulitzer Prize in fiction, agrees. “If I remember correctly,” he said, “she has the beggar shouting Cockney East End slang—something like, ‘Blimey, here come the coppers!’ ” There was also a problem, again, of timing: Partridge’s translation came out nearly twenty years after the book’s release, forty years after Asturias had begun writing it, and five years before he won the Nobel. And his anti-imperialism would not have been widely appreciated in the U.S. at the time. “The original translation predates everything we know in this country about what the C.I.A. did: the different coups it was responsible for in Iran, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic,” Unger said.\n\nIn 2014, Unger was awarded the Miguel Ángel Asturias National Prize in Literature for lifetime achievement, the most important literary prize in Guatemala. In gratitude, he decided to take on a new translation, in the hopes of giving Guatemala’s most important writer another chance of recognition in the U.S. He got a translation grant from the New York State Council on the Arts, and set to work. Once he had completed a few chapters, his agent, Andrea Montejo, contacted John Siciliano, the executive editor of Penguin Classics. Siciliano was interested, but rights issues meant that publication of Asturias’s work was, once again, delayed several years.\n\nBut the timing may finally be right. “I wanted the novel to really speak to our generation and our time,” Unger said. Esther Allen, a respected translator of Latin American literature into English, and a professor at Baruch College, told me that the choice to translate the title as “Mr. President” had surprised her. “ ‘Mr. President’ is specifically American,” she said, adding, “Nobody translates ‘Madame Bovary’ as ‘Mrs. Bovary.’ ” (It was Penguin’s decision, Siciliano told me, “because of the additional power it confers on the title character.”) Still, Allen ventured, when we spoke—the day before the final summer hearing of the January 6th committee—“ ‘Mr. President’ might work as an indictment: you Americans shouldn’t think this is foreign to you.”\n\nA new wave of repressive regimes is also again taking hold in Central America, including in Guatemala, where there is an increasing crackdown on political dissent, and in Nicaragua. Sergio Ramírez was forced to leave that country a year ago, and, last September, the government of President Daniel Ortega—whom Ramírez had served under as Vice-President during his first Administration, after the Sandinista revolution had toppled the dictator Anastasio Somoza—issued a warrant for his arrest. (Ortega returned to office in 2007, and in the years since has himself become increasingly autocratic.) Ramírez now lives in Spain. A new batch of dictator novels is coming, he told me. These days, “We all have our ‘Señor Presidente.’ ” ♦"
