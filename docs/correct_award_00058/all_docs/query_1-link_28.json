        "text": "Asturias began and ended his literary life in Paris, as an exile. And it did not help his standing in the West that he was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize the year prior to his Nobel. Another liability was Asturias' elder son, Rodrigo, who founded one of Guatemala's chief Marxist guerrilla groups, the Revolutionary Organization of People in Arms (ORPA). Rodrigo borrowed the nom de guerre Gaspar Ilom from a character in one of his father's novels.\n\nMaya Realism\n\nSO WHY should we pay more attention to a Latin protest writer of lesser genius whose works translate poorly into English? Above all, to give Asturias his due as a literary pioneer. It was in his chef d'oeuvre, El Señor Presidente (1946), a chilling portrait of an arche- typal Third World dictator, that Asturias first used the surrealist techniques of French poets André Breton and Tristan Tzara to create the stunning literary effects vulgarly known as \"magic realism.\"\n\nEl Señor Presidente, we learn in the novel Asturias began in the 1920s under the Estrada Cabrera dictatorship, was so twisted by vengefulness and paranoid distrust that his enslavement of an entire nation did not begin to assuage his bloodlust. To him, his subjects were \"parrot's feces. It neither smells nor stinks.\"\n\nIn this phantasmagoric world of midnight knocks on the door, humans are so frozen with fear they become puppets, and only deaf-mute beggars, trees, dogs and china cups dare sound the alarm. In El Señor Presidente's hermetic domain of casual torture, institutional deception and terror, \"bullets don't know when they pass through a man's body. They think flesh is warm, sweet air, a little fat.\"\n\nWhat Asturias called \"magic surrealism\" began not with García Márquez or Julio Cortázar but with his two unquestioned masterpieces, El Señor Presidente and Men of Maize. (Asturias' co-progenitor of magic realism was his Cuban contemporary Alejo Carpentier, who used surrealist techniques and Creole imagery to good effect in his two Caribbean novels, The Realm of This World and Steps in the Jungle.)\n\nWhat lifts Men of Maize, a finely woven fable of Mayan retribution against domestic and foreign exploiters and their lackeys, above the ill-fated United Fruit Trilogy and his other indigenist novels is Asturias' brilliant adaptation of the classic Quiché-Maya Popol Vuh, or Book of Council, rediscovered in the l8th century by a Spanish missionary. The story of the three creations of man by the gods and the adventures of the twins Hun-Hunapu and Ixbalanqué in the nether world of Xibalbá, where they conquer the Lords of Death, is replete with the grotesque narrative twists, the shadings of dark and light, and the metamorphoses that are the essence of what might be called \"Maya realism.\"\n\nAsturias, who attempted his own translation of the Popol Vuh, merged its rich, dreamlike imagery with European surrealist devices in composing Men of Maize. There is a familiar dark magic in the death chosen by the Maya sorcerers for Colonel Chalo Godoy, who conspired with corrupt farmers to destroy the guerrilla warrior Gaspar Ilom:\n\nHands of darkness brandishing daggers will force him to suicide. But it will be only his shadow, a skin of shadow among the yuccas. The bullet will burst in his temples, he will fall to the ground, but other dark hands will lift his body, they will mount him on his horse, and will begin to shrink him horse and all until he is the size of sugar candy.\n\nAnd there are also resonances of the Popol Vuh in Maria Tecún's aimless wanderings after she is bitten by a spider, and in Don Nicho the postman's journey to Xibalbá to meet his coyote nahual. The lesson he learns is the same taught by the authors of Popol Vuh:\n\nThose who thus confront their nahual, outside themselves, are invincible in war and in love ... they own all the riches they desire, they make the snakes respect them, do not succumb to small pox, and if they die it is said their bones are made of firestone.\n\nAnother excellent reason for reading Asturias is that he was a true visionary who prophesied in his books the resurgence of Maya communities whose voices are being heard once again. Thirty years after his Nobel, Asturias' The Mirror of Lida Sal: Stories Based on Mayan Myths & Guatemalan Legends, his 1967 collection of Maya myths (the first, Leyendas de Guatemala, from 1930, has not been translated), is finally appearing in an English translation.\n\nAfter five centuries of silent witness, Maya priests and sorcerers, and powerful new leaders like Nobel Peace­Prize laureate Rigoberta Menchú, are calling on nature's hidden powers--on the sacred essence of maize and the ceiba tree, with its roots in the underworld and its upper branches in the heavens--to resurrect their ancestral gods and reclaim their place under the Maya sun.\n\nAsturias died in 1974. Had he lived another two decades, he would have been welcomed back to Guatemala with open arms. And he would have witnessed the historic peace accord ending a 37-year-long war in which his son Rodrigo--influenced by his father's writings--was a key protagonist.\n\nBut it is the resurgence of the Mayas and their gods, foreshadowed in all his books, that would have made Asturias proud--and crowned his life with a redemption larger and more enduring than any Nobel Prize.\n\nThe Mirror of Lida Sal, translated by Gilbert Alter-Gilbert; Latin American Literary Review Press; $14.95, paperback.\n\nVictor Perera is the author of Unfinished Conquest: The Guatemalan Tragedy (California) and The Cross and the Pear Tree: A Sephardic Journey (California). He is currently working on a book on whales for Alfred A. Knopf.\n\n[ Metro | Metroactive Central | Archives ]"
