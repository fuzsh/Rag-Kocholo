        "text": "Miguel Ángel Asturias (October 19, 1899 – June 9, 1974) was a Nobel Prize-winning Guatemalan poet-diplomat, novelist, playwright and journalist. Asturias helped establish Latin American literature's contribution to mainstream Western culture, and at the same time drew attention to the importance of indigenous cultures, especially those of his native Guatemala.\n\nAsturias received many honors and literary awards over the course of his career. One of the more notable awards was the Nobel Prize for Literature, which he received in 1967 for \"Hombres de maiz\". This award caused some controversy at the time because of his relative anonymity outside of Latin America. Robert G. Mead criticized the choice because he thought that there were more well-known deserving candidates. In 1966, Asturias was awarded the Soviet Union's Lenin Peace Prize. He received this recognition for \"La trilogía bananera\" (\"The Banana Trilogy\") in which he criticizes the presence of aggressive American companies such as The United Fruit Company in Latin American countries.\n\nOther prizes for Asturias' work include: el Premio Galvez (1923); Chavez Prize (1923); and the Prix Sylla Monsegur (1931), for \"Leyendas de Guatemala\"; as well as the Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger for \"El señor presidente\" (1952)."
