        "text": "Miguel Ángel Asturias (born October 19, 1899, Guatemala City, Guatemala—died June 9, 1974, Madrid, Spain) was a Guatemalan poet, novelist, and diplomat, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1967 and the Soviet Union’s Lenin Peace Prize in 1966. His writings, which combine the mysticism of the Maya with an epic impulse toward social protest, are seen as summing up the social and moral aspirations of his people.\n\nIn 1923, after receiving his degree in law from Guatemala’s University of San Carlos, Asturias settled in Paris, where he studied ethnology at the Sorbonne and became a militant Surrealist under the influence of the French poet and movement leader André Breton. His first major work, Leyendas de Guatemala (1930; “Legends of Guatemala”), describes the life and culture of the Maya before the arrival of the Spanish. It brought him critical acclaim in France as well as at home.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPoetry: First Lines\n\nOn his return to Guatemala, Asturias founded and edited El diario del aire, a radio magazine. During this period he published several volumes of poetry, beginning with Sonetos (1936; “Sonnets”). In 1946 he embarked upon a diplomatic career, continuing to write while serving in several countries in Central and South America. From 1966 to 1970 Asturias was the Guatemalan ambassador in Paris, where he took up permanent residence."
