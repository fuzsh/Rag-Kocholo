        "text": "November 24, 2021\n\nEl Señor Presidente = Mister President = The President, Miguel Ángel Asturias\n\nMister President is a 1946 novel written in Spanish, by Nobel Prize-winning Guatemalan writer and diplomat: Miguel Ángel Asturias (1899–1974).\n\nA landmark text in Latin American literature, Mister President explores the nature of political dictatorship and its effects on society.\n\nAsturias makes early use of a literary technique now known as magic realism. One of the most notable works of the dictator novel genre, Mister President developed from an earlier Asturias short story, written to protest social injustice in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in the author's home town.\n\nتاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز نهم ماه نوامبر سال1972میلادی و بار دیگر سال1999میلادی\n\nعنوان: آقای رئیس‌ جمهور؛ میگل آنجل آستوریاس؛ مترجم: زهرای خانلری (کیا)؛ تهران، خوارزمی، سال1348، در408ص، موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان گواتمالایی به زبان اسپانیا - سده20م\n\nداستان «آقای رئیس جمهور»، داستان «استرادا گابررا»، دیکتاتور خشن «گواتمالا»، در نخستبن سالهای سده ی بیستم میلادی است؛ رئیس جمهوری که خود را خدای مردمان آن کشور میدانستند، و بجای مردمان کشور خود، و برای آنها تصمیم گیری نیز میکردند؛ حکومتی که به برهان نارضایتی و شجاعت «افراد ویژه»، به آنها انواع و اقسام جرمها را، نسبت میدهد؛ محکومین، و شاهدهای رویدادهای گوناگون را در زندان، به زور شکنجه، مجبور به اعترافات دلخواه خویش میکند، و ....؛ در این داستانِ سیاست و اختناق، خوانشگر شاهد یک عشق، و سرانجام آن، در چنان حکومتی نیز هست؛ آقای «استوریاس» داستان را با شیوه های خیال آمیز، و شاعرانه با روایتی بسیار زیبا بازگو کرده اند\n\nتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 25/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 02/09/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی\n\nApril 17, 2020\n\nI read the English translation of this Spanish language novel, which was published in 1946. I broke off reading it about halfway through to better understand the background, and it seems the title character is based on the real-life Manuel Estrada, President of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920. I’d not heard of him before. The story is set during the 1910s.\n\nI’ve read a number of novels by Latin American authors where the reader is taken into a sort of nightmare world, and this is another to add to that list. It seems to me the author wanted to illustrate the effects of dictatorship on society, especially the effects produced by the sort of dictator with which Latin America has historically been so cursed. In this novel the merest chance can lead to someone being tortured or executed, and the society is a sort of kleptocracy where those in power extort money from everyone else. Cruelty and fear are the dominant themes, and people are cruel to one another in the most casual fashion. Others are driven by fear to disown friends and relatives who have been arrested, terrified they will be tarred by association. There are one or two characters who behave with decency, but they are the exceptions. Many of the male characters spend their time getting blindingly drunk. Apparently alcoholism really was a major problem in Guatemala at this time, but I get the feeling the author’s message is that the rottenness of the society he describes was something that originated at the top and spread downwards.\n\nDespite the book’s title, the President is not the main character, that role falling to someone with the curious moniker of “Miguel Angel-Face”, an advisor to the President. Several times his name is linked with the phrase “He was as beautiful and as wicked as Satan”. I found this a curious expression and wondered whether there was something to it that was lost either in translation or across the gaps of time and place. Despite the comparison with old Beelzebub, Miguel is one of the book’s more sympathetic characters. He falls in love with the daughter of one of the President’s political opponents and becomes a better person as a result.\n\n“Magic realism” is another well-known feature of Latin American literature and this novel was one of the early examples of that genre. It isn’t always a style that I appreciate but it’s comparatively restrained in this novel. Most of the dream like sequences are identified as dreams. There are a few mystical elements based around aspects of Catholicism.\n\nIs it hope or depravity that triumphs? It’s a question I would enjoy discussing, and I rate a novel a success when it leaves me with the desire to discuss it with others. However, to take that discussion further in this review would be to include spoilers.\n\nMay 13, 2023\n\nС самых первых строк, тех самых ономатопеических, стало ясно, что это великий мастер слова.\n\n\"Бьем-бьем-бьем! бьем-лбом, бьем-лбом! – били-били-лбом! – белым лбом… бьем… бьем!… – били колокола, ранили слух, луч сквозь мглу, мгла сквозь свет. – Били-бьем! Би-ли-бьем! Бьем-бьем… белым-белым лбом… бьем! бьем! бьем! \"\n\nНо Астуриас не только мастер слова, он мастер и подачи идей, и смешения жанров, стилей и техник. Он виртуозно смешивает исторический роман с магическим реализмом, сюрреализм с потоком сознания, роман о диктаторе с мифологией коренных народов Гватемалы. Его язык образен, ярок и, одновременно, поэтичен и страшен в обличительной силе.\n\nЦентральной темой его романа является диктатор и люди, живущие при диктатуре. Он не называет ни страну, ни имени диктатора, и из-за каждый диктатор прошлого или современности чем-то похож на Сеньора Президента.\n\nЭтот человек, пришедший к власти, больше всего на свете боится. Боится потерять власть, боится, как близкое окружение, генералов и полковников, так и свой народ. Этот страх поощряет доносительство. Доносят все и на всех тоже из страха. Сеньор Президент может бороться со своим страхом только запугивая и внушая страх всем - и близкому окружению, своим фаворитам, подчинённым, так и простым людям. Этого можно достичь только необузданной жестокостью, изощрёнными, извращёнными пытками духа и тела. Мало просто убить, нужно внушить ужас, нужно истязать. Мало просто посадить в тюрьму, нужно заставить страдать. Вот эту природу страха, присутствующей в любой диктатуре, Астуриас великолепно изобразил.\n\nСтрах порождает и культ личности. Сеньору Президенту важно каждый день слышать слова восхваления из страха потерять власть. Его окружению самая неприкрытая лесть позволяет выслужиться, а народу, славословящему диктатору - выжить, подтвердить свою благонадёжность.\n\nРоман полон сновидений или просто видений, как у Кара де Анхеля во время аудиенции у Сеньора Президента, когда перед его мысленным образом возник образ Тоиля - Властителя Огня - требующего человеческих жертв. Эти сновидения и просто видения создают образы, которые играют важную роль в создании параллельного, мистического восприятия сюжетных деталей.\n\nВ романе Сеньор Президент убивает не только оружием или нечеловеческими условиями, например лишением воды, но и словом, клеветой или обманом. Отец и муж Камилы умерли от навета, так сильно слово.\n\nЛюбовь способна изменить человека, считает автор. Но мне кажется, что Мигель, с одной стороны, почувствовал свою неприязнь к патрону и осознал его ничтожность не под воздействием любви. Он продолжал и был готов продолжать свою работу, подавляя свои чувства из элементарного самосохранения и желания благополучия. Но Сеньор Президент, страдая параноидальным страхом никому не верит и часто меняет фаворитов.\n\nНа мой взгляд, многие второстепенные персонажи вышли даже сильнее, цельнее главных героев. Таковы образы Пелеле, Федины, кукольника.\n\nApril 9, 2012\n\nOne of the finest novels you will ever read. It will tear your heart out and all the while make you feel as if something magical is happening. Asturias is a deft weaver of stories, not to mention a grandfather of the magical realism genre in literature. He wrote all his books in Spanish, of course, and I, of course, had to read the translated verions, which must suffer from the kind of loss all translations suffer, and yet, I cannot fathom how this novel could be any better than it is. The essence of Asturias' talent does not get lost in translation here. It may take a little work to get a copy of this...it may cost a little extra money...it's so much more than merely worth it. It's a tale you will never forget.\n\nDecember 31, 2008\n\nI just finished this novel and it was an exhausting and depressing read. Don't get me wrong; it is a fantastic novel and well worth the time and emotional investment. Asturias writes in an almost poetic prose that really draws you in. His characters are engaging and his settings are such that I was able to really visualize his scenes. The story itself is sad and his words carry you along like a silent observer of some hateful crime that you are unable to prevent but of which you are almost omniscient. It is really frustrating and I found myself wanting to yell out to the characters to \"STOP!\" several times. And of his characters, Asturias brings seemingly insignificant characters from early chapters back as more major players throughout the story, so if you plan to read this pay attention to every character.\n\nI highly recommend this book, especially to those who enjoy reading works of historical fiction.\n\nOctober 29, 2013\n\nقرأت هذا الكتاب أثناء وجودي في السجن عام 1991، وكان صادماً بعمقه وتعريته للاستبداد وما يفعله بالبشر، الجميل في الكتاب هو تجربة الانشقاق وتحمل تبعات اتخاذ السبيل الصحيح مهما كانت مؤلمة ومفجعة.\n\nMarch 14, 2018\n\nMiguel Ángel Asturias's El Señor Presidente is the ultimate novel about Latin American political dictatorships -- and it is also the earliest. It was written in 1933, but for various reasons not published until 1946. It is set during the presidency of Manuel Estrada Cabrera, which lasted from 1898-1920. Although the president is never named, it is set during the First World War, when Estrada Cabrera was in office.\n\nEarly in the novel, he president decides to blame General Canales for the death of Colonel Sonriente, one of the leader's favorite hatchet men. (He was actually killed by a loony whom he was teasing.) In the course of executing Estrada's orders, Miguel Angel Face (is it significant that the character has 2/3 of the author's name?) kidnaps the General's daughter and hauls her to a bar across the street. In the process, he falls in love with her and marries her.\n\nThis does not sit well with the president: marrying his avowed enemy. The tone of his presidency is set by this comment, which the Judge Advocate makes to one of his servants:\n\nWhen will you understand that you mustn't encourage people to hope? In my house the first thing everyone, down to the cat, has to learn is that there are never grounds for hope of any description for anyone. It's only possible to go on holding a position like mine if you obey orders; the President's rule of conduct is never to give grounds for hope, and everyone must be kicked and beaten until they realise the fact. When this lady comes back you must return her her letter, neatly folded, and tell her there is no way of finding out where her husband is buried.\n\nInterestingly, Estrada Cabrera was forced out of office after he was unable to lead the country after a series of devastating earthquakes in 1917-1918.\n\nAsturias went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1967. He has written a number of other novels, which are also excellent, especially Men and Maize and Mulata as well as a trilogy excoriating the United Fruit Company's treatment of the campesinos who worked for it.\n\nOctober 10, 2018\n\nreaffirms that my sweet spot for literature seems to be the 20s and 30s. Some real gut-punches of brutality, and just exceptionally well written and structured.\n\nelements of surrealism and magical realism, as well as some pure documentary realism, all beautifully mixed together.\n\nin the age of Trump, it is also perhaps useful to engage with a text like this. Power and brutality and selfishness abound....\n\nJune 20, 2020\n\n'The President' is the depiction of life under the rule of a cruel and capricious dictator in a nameless South American country. There is an almost acrid atmosphere to the book, as Asturias lures you in with the lurid lives of the characters, from the Machiavellian, but ultimately tragic Angel Face, to the innocent Camilla who is caught up his web of deceit, to the dictator himself, a man consumed with paranoia and hatred.\n\nThe nightmarish tone of the novel is set in the opening chapter, which depicts a scene in which various tramps congregate in a church, one of whom ends up murdering a general and, thus setting in motion the events which take place during the book. This nightmarish atmosphere is reinforced throughout the book; from frequent description to the orangeade sky, to the constant stream of betrayals which the characters subject each other too, the people who populate the story are not so much humans as they are puppets dancing on the strings of the all-powerful dictator.\n\nNot only is 'The President' a powerful and prescient depiction of life under a dictator, it is also an exploration of the ceaseless cruelty created by any tyrannically government and the meaningless sense of violence it perpetuates.\n\nJuly 3, 2018\n\nBu kitabı ikinci okuyuşum, ilk kez 1971 yılında okumuştum. Siyasi mesajından çok etkilenmiştim, o dönem politik bilinçlenme için önerilen kült kitaplardan biriydi. Yeniden okuduğumda o zaman çok farklı bir kitabı okumuştum herhalde diye düşündüm. Bu kitap ciddi bir edebi eser çünkü. Gerçi abartma, dramatize etme, gerçekçi olmayacak kurgulamaları olsa da, ideolojik bir kitaptan çok edebi yönü olan bir kitap buldum.\n\nYazar bu kitabı Guatemala’da 1898 ile 1920 yılları arasında ülkeyi diktatörlükle yöneten, hile ile seçim kazanan ve muhaliflerine karşı çok acımasız olan Başkan Manuel Estrada Cabrera’yı yermek için yazmış. Gerçi yıllar farketmiyor, genelde diktatörlerin karşı düşünceye karşı uyguladığı yöntemler üç aşağı beş yukarı aynı.\n\nBu okuyuşumda kitap beni politik olarak nedense etkilemedi, kitapta yazılanlara karşı duyarsızlaşmak ya da kanıksamak söz konusu olamayacağına göre kitabın okunuş yaşı, zamanı ve o zamanki ruh durumunun ne kadar etkili olduğunu bir kez daha anladım. Okumanızı öneririm, zamanıdır :)\n\nJanuary 11, 2020\n\nIt's clear to see how this powerful, incisive gem of a political satire earned Asturias the Nobel Prize for Literature. What's less clear is how it can have fallen into moderate obscurity since then. It remains relevant today and is quite vivid in this excellent translation by Frances Partridge, whose talents earned her the respect of the Bloomsbury Group.\n\n4.5 stars\n\nFebruary 13, 2014\n\nإذا كان الكتاب الروس قد خرجوا من معطف جوجول\n\nفإن كل كتاب أمريكا اللاتينيه قد ثاروا على ديكتاتورياتهم\n\nوخرجوا من أرصفه السيد الرئيس\n\nJune 14, 2023\n\nMiguel Ángel Asturias – Prémio Nobel da Literatura, 1967\n\n\"pela sua realização literária vívida, profundamente enraizada nos traços nacionais e tradições dos povos indígenas da América Latina\"\n\nUma das coisas boas destas viagens literárias é despachar um país, a Guatemala, junto com um prémio Nobel da Literatura.\n\nMiguel Ángel Asturias (1899-1974) nasceu na Cidade da Guatemala, filho de pai mestiço e advogado, e mãe índia e professora. Foi um consagrado escritor, jornalista e diplomata, reconhecido no mundo da literatura e um dos precursores do «boom latino-americano», que surgiu entre os anos 60 e 70. Viveu exilado durante vários anos, devido à sua oposição pública à tirania. Em 1923 viajou para a Europa, com o objectivo de estudar em Inglaterra, mas acabou por ficar dez anos em Paris, cidade onde escreveu, entre outros, este livro.\n\nO Senhor Presidente foi inspirado no governo do ditador Manuel José Estrada Cabrera, presidente da Guatemala no período de 1898 e 1920, e que afectou directamente a família do autor.\n\nO romance tem como ponto de partida o assassinato de coronel José Parrales Sonriente, um militar próximo do Presidente. A partir daqui tudo serve para perseguir opositores do regime e antigos aliados.\n\nNão pergunte a si mesmo, general, se é culpado ou inocente: pergunte apenas se conta ou não com a proteção do amo, pois um inocente que está mal com o governo, acha-se em piores condições do que se fosse culpado.\n\nNão foi uma leitura fácil (com muitas metáforas e onomatopeias), chegou a ser asfixiante com tanta violência, abusos de autoridade, torturas e acusações, mas valeu a pena.\n\nO peso dos mortos faz a terra girar de noite e o peso dos vivos, de dia... Quando os mortos forem em maior número do que os vivos, a noite será eterna, não terá fim; para o dia retornar faltará o peso dos vivos.\n\n52/198 – Guatemala\n\nJuly 25, 2021\n\nEnfes bir kitap, enfes. Latin Amerika edebiyatının temel konularından olan “diktatör romanları”nın harika örneklerinden biri. (Marquez’in “Başkan Babamızın Sonbaharı”nı veya Llosa’nın “Teke Şenliği”ni sevenler bunu da sever; bir de Guatemala'ya uğramış olursunuz hem.) Aynı zamanda da büyülü gerçekçiliğin erken dönem örneklerinden biri, ilk sesleri, oluşma adımları. Diktatörlüğün bir toplumda yarattığı yozlaşmayı, toplumsal olanın bireysel olanı ne kadar derinden etkileyip şekillendirdiğini, çürümenin nasıl ve ne biçimde sızabileceğini çok sarsıcı şekilde anlatıyor Asturias. Bir de tabii kelimeler. Nasıl güçlü kelimeler. Kurgunun, karakterlerin başarısı bir yana, bu kitap edebi açıdan da bir cevher elbette ki. Anlattığı vahşet de, aşk da, korku da çok güçlü, çok etkileyici. Bu okuduğum üçüncü Asturias’dı, devamı kesinlikle gelecek. “Sevmek umudunu yitirip yalnızca sevilmekle yetinen sevdalılar gemisine götürün onu…”\n\nApril 21, 2014\n\nاستمد الكاتب ميغيل انخيل استورياس هذه الرواية من سنوات حكم الديكتاتور كابريرا الذي حكم جمهورية جواتيمالا لسنوات طويلة، هذه الرواية تحكي بشكل دامٍ الكوارث التي يخلفها الاستبداد في روح الشعب وأيامه ومستقبله وكرامته ، ما يحدثه المستبد من شروخ في الجسد الوطني وما يتبع ذلك من فضائع على المستوى الفردي ، النهب والقتل والتلاعب بالقوانين واستخدام السلطة في التنكيل بالآخرين بلا ذنب أو تهمة غالباً ، تحويل الزعيم الأوحد إلى صنم تدور حوله كل الدولة والشعب والقيادات وهو وحده مصدر السلطات وعليه تنعقد آمال الوصوليين والمتسلقين ومصاصي الدماء واللصوص ، الرواية مفعمة بكثير من المشاهد المرعبة وصور المعاناة التي عاشها شعب فقير تحت نير الطاغية وأزلامه ، كذلك تحتوي الرواية بشكل كبير على كثير من تفاصيل الحياة والحكايات والأساطير الشعبية ،، الرواية بدأت بمأساة وانتهت بمأساة وهكذا حياة الشعوب المسحوقة تحت الحكم الدكتاتوري\n\nJanuary 11, 2018\n\nFESTIVAL NARRATIVO\n\nEs un tema recurrente entre los corrillos de entendidos en literatura y críticos que el lenguaje puede salvar a una novela y que, quizás, al final, es lo que perdura de un texto. También es habitual que las editoriales nos vendan novelas que, en sus paratextos, sean elogiadas por la forma en la que están escritas. En el caso de El Señor Presidente, esto es una realidad, porque la obra de Asturias es, fundamentalmente, lenguaje, pero un lenguaje entendido como un personaje más, quizás el auténtico personaje protagonista del texto.\n\nDesde el mismo inicio, desde la primera palabra, desde ese ya archiconocido “¡Alumbra lumbre de alumbre, Luzbel de piedralumbre!”, Asturias ya deja muy clara su voluntad de que el libro será un festival narrativo asentado en todo el poder de la lengua con la que se expresa. Ese primer párrafo define gran parte de la utilización del lenguaje en la novela: la sinestesia, el empleo de onomatopeyas, de palabras que por su sonoridad remiten a otras, la utilidad del adjetivo para conformar la personalidad de los personajes, un derroche de originalidad expresiva en una explosión a veces näif y colorista que, incluso, adorna de una pátina luminosa a las escenas más trágicas, sangrientas o brutales, sabiendo ser delicado en momentos tan terribles como el encarcelamiento y muerte de Miguel Cara de Ángel o la desazonadora, pero no por ello menos lírica, muerte del bebe en brazos de la Niña Fedina mientras, en un golpetazo de realidad, “el amanuense se chupaba las muelas”.\n\nEl lenguaje ilumina la novela por completo. En Asturias, el lenguaje narrativo es capaz de levantar mundos y de crear voces personalísimas a través de los discursos que articulan los personajes, repletos de giros característicos, de las formas del habla de las calles o de los palacios, de los políticos y de los poetas, dotando a cada uno de los seres que desfilan por el texto (y son muchísimos) de una personalidad propia que se cuaja en el mismo instante en que abren la boca y se expresan. Ejemplar es la aparición del Señor Presidente, definido por la palabra que utiliza repetidamente en ese capítulo: ANIMAL, con mayúsculas.\n\nEsa delicadeza de orfebre con las formas de hablar de los personajes que tiene Asturias cala en la voz del narrador, incansable en un despliegue de juegos de palabras, retruécanos, onomatopeyas (grande es el valor que concede Asturias a la onomatopeya en su discurso narrativo), incluso en giros rebosantes de originalidad e ingenio que, a veces, recuerdan a las greguerías. El adjetivo de unas ���calles intestinales”, para retratar los suburbios, la onomatopeya de la risa que se articula con las cinco vocales para mostrar una humillación, las asociaciones simbólicas casi surrealistas como “la casa que era una regadera de ladridos”, o la adjetivación barroca para hacernos palpar la niebla que es “estuquería de natas con color de pulque y olor a verdolaga”, así como la repetición de ciertas frases en la reiterada descripción de los personajes importantes al estilo de ese “Miguel Cara de Ángel era bello y malo como Satán”, son ejemplos de cómo se desencadena este festival de narratividad que construye Asturias por y para el uso de un lenguaje que adquiere un relieve por encima de los personajes y las situaciones, llegando a ser, casi, el fin mismo de la novela -de sucesos tan brutales que quizás no podría soportar un lenguaje que no los anestesiara con su lirismo inagotable- ya que, no en vano, se cierra con una abstracción lingüística de pura recitación: la letanía de un rosario. No podía ser de otro modo.\n\nProtagonista: el lenguaje. Una lección magistral que aturde y fascina y emboba. Sonoro, maestro y monumental ejercicio de lenguaje.\n\nRead\n\nAugust 22, 2021\n\n“The weight of the dead makes the earth turn by night, and by day it is the weight of the living... When there are more dead than living there will be eternal night, night without end, for the living will not be heavy enough to bring the dawn.”\n\nP 219, 1963 Gollancz edition.\n\nJanuary 3, 2018\n\n\"...¿Creéis seguir viviendo en un siglo en el que los reyes estaban, como vos os quejáis de haberlo estado, a las órdenes y a la discreción de sus inferiores?… Estoy fundando un Estado en el que solo habrá un amo...¡El Estado SOY YO!...\" (Alejandro Dumas, El vizconde de Bragelonne, palabras que pone en boca del rey Luis XIV).\n\nEstas palabras que el gran Alejandro Dumas atribuye al rey Luis XIV denotan claramente el espíritu que ronda y que constituye el fundamento y piedra angular de los regímenes totalitarios, denominación moderna que recibe aquello que, con anterioridad a la Revolución Francesa, era llamado de absolutismo, y en los cuales existe, como ya se ha dicho un solo amo situado en la cúspide de todo y el cual siquiera está sometido a la ley, puesto que su voluntad es la ley misma. Quien crea que estas palabras puestas por Dumas en boca de Luis XIV pertenecen a un pasado remoto, vive en una burbuja apartada de la realidad.\n\nEl señor presidente de Miguel Ángel Asturias (Premio Nobel de Literatura) se inscribe en la corriente que podría ser llamada como Literatura de dictaduras pues el trasfondo político llevado al plano literario da lugar a estas novelas. Mi primer contacto con este tipo de obras fue en el ya lejano año de 2001 momento en el cual no contaba yo con más de 15 años y aún cursaba la secundaria (a la que llaman instituto en España), y cuando para un trabajo correspondiente a la clase de Literatura se me asignó la lectura de Yo, el Supremo principal obra del más aclamado escritor de mi país Augusto Roa Bastos (Premio Cervantes en 1989). En esta obra, el autor utiliza el mote de \"El Supremo\" para hacer referencia a la figura histórica de José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, hombre que gobernó Paraguay en solitario desde 1814 hasta su muerte en 1840 y cuyo título oficial era Supremo Dictador de la República (así iniciaba sus documentos oficiales: Yo, el Supremo Dictador de la República del Paraguay).\n\nCon un estilo bastante distinto, Asturias nos presenta a otro Dictador, aquí se tiene una particularidad compartida con Roa Bastos, si en Yo, el Supremo se hace referencia al dictador con el título de El Supremo, Asturias lo hace con el de Señor Presidente, sin que se asigne un nombre propio al dictador que rige los destinos del país, empero los literatos especializados señalan que la figura de este Presidente se basa en el guatemalteco Manuel Estrada Cabrera. Esta afirmación de parte de algunos estudiosos, incluido el autor de la introducción a la edición que he leído (la de que este Presidente se basa en esa figura histórica) me llevó a indagar acerca del período en que ese hombre gobernó Guatemala, tras leer suficiente, pude notar algo llamativo, y es que este dictador sin nombre no necesariamente es guatemalteco, puesto que puede ser extrapolado a cualquiera de los demás países latinoamericanos que, en algún momento de su historia, padecieron este tipo de gobiernos autocráticos.\n\nLatinoamérica no solo es bastante homogénea en cuanto a su configuración étnica (proveniente en lo principal del mestizaje entre autóctonos y españoles) y cultural (en lo esencial seguimos las mismas tradiciones, baste con ver que, por ejemplo, la Semana Santa es festejada de manera casi similar desde Argentina hasta México), sino que la misma historia de esta región es casi convergente en el momento y forma de desarrollarse los hechos. Así, cada país que ha padecido un gobierno dictatorial puede identificarse plenamente con la atmósfera opresiva, sangrienta, injusta y dura descrita por Asturias en esta obra. Así, el dictador sin nombre bien puede ser Alfredo Stroessner, Augusto Pinochet, Rafael Videla, Hugo Banzer, Emilio Medici, Anastacio Somoza, Porfirio Díaz, Fidel Castro, Leónidas Trujillo, Juan Velasco Alvarado, Juan María Bordaberry y tantos otros.\n\nMuchos de los pasajes de este libro me resultaron extrañamente familiares, pues mucho de lo que Asturias hace padecer a sus personajes es el vivo relato de cuanto me ha contado mi madre de la vida bajo el gobierno dictatorial (tengo 31 años, cuando cayó la dictadura de Alfredo Stroessner contaba yo con 3 años, así que no recuerdo nada) que en el caso de Paraguay había durado largos 35 años (1954-1989, fue el segundo período dictatorial después del de Rodríguez de Francia 1814-1840). Una de ellas es el cumpleaños del dictador. En un capítulo del libro, se festeja el onomástico del dictador con una gran fiesta, día de fiesta nacional, con el pueblo saludando al Líder y alabando su gobierno con encendidos discursos, pues bien, aquí en Paraguay, el cumpleaños del dictador (3 de noviembre) era feriado nacional y todos los empleados públicos, docentes, militares y policías estaban obligados a ir rendir pleitesía al dictador, quienes no estaban en la Capital debían festejar tan importante fecha en sus respectivas ciudades.\n\nAsimismo, la opresión relatada, y principalmente las torturas (de hecho uno de los pasajes que me desgarró el alma es uno en que los militares dejan morir de hambre a un bebé para que su madre confiese algo que ni sabía) forman parte del itinerario de todas las dictaduras, al menos de las más recientes, en Paraguay, Argentina, Brasil y Chile existen sendos informes relativos a los abusos a los derechos humanos cometidos en los períodos de gobierno dictatorial, y en el Cono Sur la cuestión fue aún lejos debido a la Operación Condor que constituyó un marco de acuerdo de colaboración entre las dictaduras de Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, Brasil y Uruguay, merced al cual desaparecieron y murieron miles de personas.\n\nLa lectura de la mejor obra de Asturias fue como leer un Manual de Historia no solo de mi país sino de casi toda Latinoamérica. Debería hacerme un hueco en mis lecturas de este año para leer La fiesta del chivo de Mario Vargas Llosa, libro basado en el cruel y sanguinario Leónidas Trujillo y quizá, La casa de los espíritus de Isabel Allende.\n\nCuatro estrellas pues en algunas partes el ritmo de la narración decae, pero no por ello he dejado de disfrutar con esta buena obra. Absolutamente recomendada.\n\nApril 5, 2023\n\nLlosa’nın “Teke Şenliği” tadında bir okuma olacağını düşündüğüm için çok yüksek beklenti ile başlamıştım. Belki de bu nedenle beklentimi karşılamadı kitap.\n\nKitabın ilk bölümlerinde, ana karakter zannettiğim General Canales’in ve Sayın Başkan karakterlerinin daha detaylandırılmış öyküsünü okumak isterdim. 250. Sayfaya kadar General Canales’in başına gelenler ile ilgili bir kelime bile geçmiyor. Sayın Başkan’ın anlatı içindeki payı ise oldukça az yer kaplıyor. Dünyadaki diktatörlük rejimlerinden deneyimimiz nedeni ile başkana peşinen bir karakter yüklüyoruz (ve kuvvetle muhtemel yanılmıyoruz) ama yazar bize sayın başkan karakteri için çok az eklemede bulunmuyor. Ana olaya tanık ya da dahil olanların yaşadıkları üzerinden diktatörlük eleştirisi yapılması elbette çok kıymetli ama eserin bütününde beni tatmin etmeyen bir şeyler var.\n\n——Spoiler ———\n\nGeneral Canales’ in son 50 sayfada birden bire ortaya çıkan ihtilal girişimine dair neden hiçbir şey anlatılmamış anlayan okur varsa lütfen bana da anlatabilir mi? Bence bu eser daha uzun ve ayrıntılı olmalıydı🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nJune 24, 2017\n\nCuando leo a Miguel Ángel Asturias me siento como en casa. Me viene a la memoria el barrio San José donde crecí, y voy reconstruyendo a partir de ese punto en mi cabeza el centro histórico de principios de siglo XX . Los personajes se desprenden fácilmente de entre la niebla de las calles, que va cediendo ante el colorido relato. A pesar de ser una denuncia clara y abierta a la dictadura de Manuel Estrada Cabrera, no deja de ser jocoso y ameno su discurso. No me extraña que fuera de las fronteras de mi país, pocos sean los adeptos de Asturias pues resulta complicada su traducción; además, siendo precursor del realismo mágico, por momentos se puede perder el hilo de la historia. Ojalá mis connacionales logren descubrir toda la riqueza de esta y otras novelas del autor. Hoy más que nunca necesitamos apoyarnos en los grandes pilares de la historia, para construir una Guatemala más unida.\n\nApril 16, 2022\n\n\"Başkan'ın güvenini kazanmak için en etkili davranış bir suç işlemek veya kendini savunamayacak kimseleri açıktan açığa aşağılamak veya halka üstün gücünü hissettirmek ya da milletin sırtından zenginleşmektir.\"\n\nNobel Edebiyat ödülü verilmiş Guatemalalı yazar M. Angel Asturias'ın büyülü gerçekçilik türünün ilk örneklerinden kabul edilen eseri. Yazarın romanlarımdan en tehlikelisi dediği, Güney Amerikalı diktatör prototipinin başarılı bir şekilde anlatıldığı kitap.\n\nAnlatım diliyle çeviri ve düzeltideki sorunlar nedeniyle başlarda hikayenin içine girmekte zorlandım. Karakterler kafamda oturduğunda anlatı akıp gitti. Metin Almanca'dan Türkçe'ye kazandırılmış. Kitap, Süleyman Doğru, Gökhan Aksay ya da Roza Hakmen gibi yetkin bir çevirmen tarafından orijinal dili olan İspanyolca'dan tekrar dilimize kazandırılsa daha iyi olur kanısındayım.\n\n1922 yılında yazımına başlanıp 1932'de bitirildiği not edilen eser ne yazık ki önemini ve güncelliğini hala koruyor.\n\nJune 18, 2023\n\nThis masterpiece is the sort of book that will make you fall eternally in love with books if read at a young age, and will remind you of how you fell in love with books if read at a not so young age.\n\nThis crushing X- ray of dictatorship with the dictator having little airtime shows the effects of the toxic combination of human deprivation and power (I tend to think the second will inevitably lead to the first) through the lives of those around and under him. The colorful cast features in an intense patchwork – or rather spiderweb – of individual lives painted like vignettes of oppression, during the dictatorship of the Guatemalan Cabrera. The heartbreaking love story delicately woven in exacerbates the pain of individual vulnerability in the face of tyranny. But the most impressive feat of this worthy Nobel winner is the language, oh the language! This is poetry at its highest, cruelest, gentlest.\n\nNot to be missed.\n\nRead\n\nApril 11, 2008\n\nThis book is one massive, paranoid nightmare. While it drags a bit at times, it's still solid. Not only is it a classic Latin American dictator novel and one of the first magical realist works, it's also worth reading as a surrealist work. Like a Latino Kafka, Asturias scrapes the darkest corners of the paranoiac mind for material, gathering them into a slightly shabby but cohesive whole.\n\nDecember 24, 2023\n\n2.5*\n\nThis book was published in 1946 and for some reason I was expecting this book to refer to a puppet president installed during the Cold War, which is impossible. I had wrong expectations and felt disoriented with this terrifying book. It's no surprise people have no respect for anything and treat each other like animals. The format of the book was really weird on my kindle, which may have affected the enjoyability of my reading. I only started to get into the story when Camilla appeared. She's the symbol of how love is the only thing that can fight against tyranny. Miguel Angel Face was a fascinating character as well, unfortunately I wasn't able to fully grasp his complexity. My own fault. The president is the quintessential dictator, who manipulates the people around him like a puppet master and betrays them to no end. All to feed his own ego. He stages events and those who speak the truth are treated like lunatics and punished. Just shows how crazy (in a bad, extreme way) the world can be if the power balance isn't in check. I didn't enjoy reading this at all.\n\nFebruary 12, 2022\n\nMy comments: https://youtu.be/3ShxdI3HunM\n\nMirror for Colombia of a dictatorship?\n\nIn this analysis of the work of the Nobel Prize winner, I highlight several points that show the coincidence between the dictatorship of Manuel Estrada Cabrera in Guatemala and Colombian democracy under the eternal President, where we have extrajudicial executions, corruption, nepotism, criminals who are public servants or public servants who commit crimes, forced displacement to steal lands, massacres, among others. If you dare to see it, I await your comments.\n\nEspejo para Colombia de una dictadura?\n\nEn este análisis de la obra del premio nobel, destaco varios puntos que muestran la coincidencia entre la dictadura de Manuel Estrada Cabrera de Guatemala y la democracia colombiana bajo el sempiterno Presidente, donde tenemos ejecuciones extrajudiciales, corrupción, nepotismo, criminales que son servidores publicos o servidores públicos que cometen crímenes, desplazamiento forzado para robar tierras, masacres, entre otras. Si se atreven a verlo, espero sus comentarios."
