        "text": "Miguel Ángel Asturias (1899-1974) was the greatest writer that Guatemala ever produced. Although many of his owrks were translated into English, most are out of print now and hard to find. Here is a short poem by Asturias that I hope you’ll like. It’s called “Caudal (The Fortune)”:\n\nTo give is to love,\n\nTo give prodigiously:\n\nFor every drop of water\n\nTo return a torrent.\n\nWe were made that way,\n\nMade to scatter\n\nSeeds in the furrow\n\nAnd stars in the ocean.\n\nWoe to him, Lord,\n\nwho doesn’t exhaust his supply,\n\nAnd, on returning, tells you:\n\n“Like an empty satchel\n\nIs my heart.”\n\nWhen Martine and I visited Paris’s Père Lachaise cemetery in 2000, we turned a corner and suddenly found a very Mayan stela commemorating the Guatemalan writer.\n\n34.052234 -118.243685\n\nRate this:\n\nIt was almost twenty years ago that Martine and I were wandering through Paris’s gigantic Père Lachaise cemetery in the 20th Arrondissement. There were a number of surprises, one of which was the grave of Miguel Ángel Asturias, who died in 1974. Rising above a bronze funerary plaque is a Maya stela similar to the ones found at the ruins of Quiriguá in his native country. To this day, he is Central America’s lone winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, which was awarded to him in 1967.\n\nI have been interested in visiting Guatemala for many years. During the time I was most available to go, Guatemala was in the middle of fighting an armed insurrection by a mostly Maya peasantry who were tired of being forced off their land, enslaved, or massacred. Between 1960 and 1966, some 200,000 Guatemalans died fighting, mostly Maya campesinos. I have just finished re-reading Asturias’s first major novel, El Señor Presidente, set during the presidency of Manuel Estrada Cabrera, who ruled from 1898 to 1920. I have been a big Asturias fan since 1975.\n\nNow that I am pretty much decided on Guatemala as my next vacation destination, I will add at least two or three more Asturias novels to the ones I have already read. To date, I have finished:\n\nEl Señor Presidente (1946), his most famous novel\n\nMen of Maize (1949)\n\nStrong Wind (1950), the first volume of the United Fruit Company trilogy\n\nMulata (1963)\n\nI plan to finish the other two volumes in the trilogy—The Green Pope (1954) and The Eyes of the Interred (1960)—both of which were translated by Gregory Rabassa, one of my favorite translators from the Spanish.\n\nAlthough Asturias is so identified with the Maya, it is interesting to note that he comes from a well-to-do Creole family that could trace its origins back to 1660.\n\n34.052234 -118.243685\n\nRate this:"
