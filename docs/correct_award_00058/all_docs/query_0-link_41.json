Sometimes I stretch the definition of vicinity. This page therefore lists only the graves that I visited. All the photos are mine, except for some which just illustrate something else apart from the grave (face of a person, mostly).\n\nIf a grave is off limits (like Picasso in France or Hundertwasser in New Zealand) I respect that, and don't try to sneak in.\n\nJanez Stare"
