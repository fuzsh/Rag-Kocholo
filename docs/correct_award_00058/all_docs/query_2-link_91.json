        "text": "Reading a handful of Latin American novels scarcely makes me an expert, but it’s hard not to detect some common threads in the literature south of the border. These range from the continuing influence of the Catholic Church; the omnipresence of abject poverty; a culture of machismo that generates misogany and homophobia; the residual impact of colonialism; racial prejudices and persecution of indigenous people; and the existence of oppressive regimes led by ruthless and self-serving dictators. It’s no accident that many of the Latin American writers that we have examined and will examine have ended up in exile. This sorry history of totalitarian government has shaped Latin American literature so heavily that even genre Latin American crime fiction bears its imprint. See https://secondchances636.wordpress.com/2023/12/11/nightmare-in-nicaragua-the-managua-trilogy-the-sky-weeps-for-me-2008-no-one-weeps-for-me-now-2017-and-dead-men-cast-no-shadows-2021-by-sergio-ramirez/\n\nMr. President is an example of the literature of totalitarianism written while its Guatamalen author, Miguel Angel Asturias, was in exile in Paris. (His activism impelled him to leave his homeland,) To impart universality, Asturias neither names the dictator in Mr. President or even the country that quakes under his oppression. However, Mr. President is said to be modeled upon Manuel Estarada Cabrera, who presided over Guatamala with an iron fist (and, not surprisingly, American support) from 1898-1920. Asturias completed Mr. President while in Paris in 1933 but serial dictatorship in Guatama prevented its publication for another thirteen years.\n\nThe actual plot of Mr. President is simple. Colonel Jose Parales Sonriente, a favored operative of Mr. President, is murdered in the El Senor Portal. The events that follow display Mr. President’s wrath, vengefulness, and craftiness. The President exploits the death to punish political enemies, blaming the the murder on the blameless General Eusebio Canales and his lawyer Abel Carvajal. The President enlists another favorite, the handsome Miguel Angel Face, to warn Canales of his impending arrest to push Canales to flee, flight that Mr. President will use as an admission of guilt on the part of the innocent officer. Angel Face, meanwhile, hopes to use this mission for a personal purpose, to abduct and seduce the General’s beautiful daughter, Camila. Instead, Angel Face falls in love with Camila and marries her. Others become ensnared in this web. The Judge Advocate tortures a group of beggars who frequent the Portal where the Colonel was killed to implicate Canales and Carvajal instead of one of their own number, Pelele, known as the Dimwit, the actual culprit. Angel Face, meanwhile, informs secret service officer Lucio Vasquez about his abduction plan. Vasquez confides the abduction plan to his friend Genaro Rodas, who shares this plot with his wife Fedina. Vasquez kills the Dimwit at Mr. President’s orders, a murder that Rodas witnesses.\n\nThe novel pictures the oppression that suffuses totalitarian regimes. Dictators rule through intimidation and brutality. Torture is used to extract phony confessions–men hang from thumbs, are lashed even to death, and in one case sealed in a brick cell to die of thirst. Citizens are jailed for trivial reasons–a sexton is imprisoned for removing a poster announcing the birthday of Mr. President’s mother–and Carvajal for no reason at all, the Judge Advocate being an expert at fabricating charges. Carvajal is later executed without even the benefit of a show trial. Indeed, everyone who has some relation to the murders of the Colonel and Dimwit suffers some form of punishment. Fedina is put to forced labor and imprisoned. Rodas undergoes lashing merely for witnessing the Dimwit’s death. Vasquez is executed for killing the Dimwit as Mr. President’s order instructing him to do so has conveniently disappeared. Even the Portal itself is dismantled.\n\nIn this realm, fear warps interpersonal relations. Servants and prostitutes, businessmen and officials, hope to shield themselves by becoming informants, offering up details that are sometimes true but more often false. The disfavored are scorned. Camila’s relatives deny her refuge after her father’s flight. Asturias refers to Mr President as Tochil, the Mayan god of fire. Tohil is a deity that demands blood sacrifice, a fitting emblem for a ruler that preys on the populace. In this way, citizens are simultaneously victims of terror and collaborators in its commission.\n\nThis regime even weaponizes love, psychological torture going hand-in-hand with brutality. As General Canales in exile begins to organize a resistance, Mr. President publishes an announcement of the wedding between Camila and Angel Face and broadcasts Mr. President’s attendance although the wedding was, in fact, private, attended only by a priest. Upon reading this news, the General dies of a broken heart. When Angel Face himself is jailed, Mr. President plants a false story that Camila has become Mr. President’s mistress. With his sole reason to live destroyed, Angel Face dies in prison. In another form of psychological torture, Mr. President toys with his victims before consuming them. Vasquez believes that Mr. President’s order will protect him from responsibility for the death of the Dimwit and is incredulous when it does not. Mr. President informs Angel Face that he needs him to to travel to the United States as a spy. Angel Face is given train and boat tickets and a bundle of cash. Mr. President’s minions arrest him as he is about to board ship nearly out of the country.\n\nThis world of terror has victims and collaborators. It also has supporters The wealthy elite sustain the tyranny, sychophants to Mr. President, and the regime feeds the wealthy by allowing them to steal land from indigenous people. The United States, bolsters Mr. President, uncaring about his oppression of the population and the rigged elections that keep him in power.\n\nThe world of Mr. President, like Dante’s Inferno, purges hope. As the Judge Advocate explains to his servant, “The President insists you should not offer hope–you should step on people no matter what.” The Judge Advocate adheres to this principle time and again, perhaps most horrifically in the case of Fedina. The Judge Advocate refuses to allow Fedina to feed her baby to coerce her to confess to involvement in Canales’ escape. Fedina hews to the truth and insists upon her innocence. Her reward is the death of her child, who has starved to death in the meantime. Taking the child’s death as proof of innocence, the Judge Advocate releases her from prison by selling her to a brothel, but the child’s death has driven her mad and she ends up in an insane asylum. One glimmer of an exception to this world of hopelessness and indecency flickers in the countryside. As the General flees through the countryside, he is aided by three sisters; in thanks he kills the doctor who is threatening to steal their home. Following the deaths of her father and husband and her abandonment by her relatives, Camila and her newborn son find sanctuary in the countryside after she glimpses a vision of frolicking foals and fillies, suckling lambs, and tender calves nuzzling “the spigots of happiness of their mother’s udder.” It is a vision of “life reborn.”\n\nAsturias is considered a father of magical realism, although the surrealism is limited to hallucinagenic dreams. What is truly magical is the writing, which deftly uses literary devices including pointed similes, repetitions, personification, and extended onomotapeias. The imagery often has a religious cast and overtones of death–a motif of the city in contract to the “life reborn” that Camila eventually enjoys in the country. A wind extinguishes a candle; “the flame seemed to cross itself as it went out.” “Streetlights eyes close one by one and dew dripped from the roofs like nails about to crucify drunks or refasten coffin lids.” When Angel Face knocks on the door to the home of Camila’s uncle to persaude him to take Camila in, his knocks are ignored by all except the house and the inanimate objects it contains:\n\nThe whole house wants to go out like a body shaking in an earthquake to see who is knocking, knocking, and knocking on the door-knocker; casseroles casseroling, flower pots dancing sinuously, pails pailing! pailing! plates with a china cough, cups, silverware sprayed like the laughter of German silver, empty bottles preceded by a bottle dripping candle-wax tears that serves and doesn’t serve as a candlestick in the furthest room….\n\nAnd when Angel Face embarks on the train, heading for the ship that he believes will take him to America, his glimpses of the sights outside the window mimic the rhythmic chugging of the train, “One after the other, one after the other, one after the other…the house chased the tree, the tree chased the fence, the fence a bridge, the bridge the road, the road a river, the river the mountain, the mountain the cloud….” Naturally, the translator David Unger, bears equal credit.\n\nAsturias received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1967. Although Guatemala now has a fragile democratic government, authoritarian and military rule persisted, with the exception of a short-lived revolution, for decades after the publication of Mr. President. Beginning in 1960, Guatamala experienced a 36 year civil war between government and leftist forces. The war was punctuated by genocidal massacres of the indigenous population. The country further suffered from intermittent corruption scandals. Poverty remains entrenched. Guatamala has the third highest rate of femicide in the world.\n\nA second chance to Asturias and Mr. President. No second chance to totalitarianism although it seems to be having a second chance at the current moment, albeit not in Guatamala."
