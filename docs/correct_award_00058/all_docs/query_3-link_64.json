        "text": "“A radical is he who has no sense…fights without reason…I have a reason. I am authentic. Yes, that’s what I am”\n\nFela Kuti\n\nBeware, Soul Brother\n\nby Chinua Achebe\n\nWe are the men of soul\n\nmen of song we measure out\n\nour joys and agonies\n\nin paces of the dance.\n\nBeware, soul brother, beware,\n\nfor others there will be\n\nlying in waiting, leaden-footed, tone deaf,\n\npassionate to despoil the devour.\n\nTake care then, mother’s son, take care\n\nhanging a lame foot in air like the hen\n\nin a strange unfamiliar compound.\n\nProtect this patrimony to which\n\nyou must return when the song is finished\n\nand the dancers disperse;\n\nRemember also your children\n\nfor they in their time will want a\n\nplace for their feet when they come of age\n\nand the dance of the future is born for them.\n\nThe concept of artist transforming society is most visible among rock stars. But when those artists change the way we think there is something profound that goes beyond their music. Bob Dylan never wanted to take credit that his music had a message. Fela Kuti did. Kuti didn’t pull any punches in regard to what he was singing and why. Kuti wanted to bring down the corruption endemic in politics in post colonial Africa and move Africa forward. So did Achebe. Poetry and music is most powerful when it moves beyond the words to a regenerative truth. When it strives to create a new understanding, even an imperfect understanding of ways to improve our world.\n\nTony Allen was the rhythm that drove Fela Kuti’s sound for decades. Allen died in April at age 79. If you don’t recognize the name, you should recognize the beat, because it has been imitated by drummers in jazz and rock and roll for the past 50 years. Allen created the Afro beat and was the coolest jazz drummer of our generation. No one played a lick like Allen. His timing, his rhythm is sheer poetry, sheer jazz. I have shared a few links below.

It is the hero or artist who is the true avatar of civilization; the individual, not the group, preserves and advances culture.”\n\nJoseph Campbell – The Hero With A Thousand Faces\n\nThe Fortune\n\nby Miguel Ángel Asturias\n\nTo give is to love,\n\nTo give prodigiously:\n\nFor every drop of water\n\nTo return a torrent.\n\nWe were made that way,\n\nMade to scatter\n\nSeeds in the furrow\n\nAnd stars in the ocean.\n\nWoe to him, Lord,\n\nwho doesn’t exhaust his supply,\n\nAnd, on returning, tells you:\n\n“Like an empty satchel\n\nIs my heart.”\n\nCaudal\n\nDar es amar,\n\ndar prodigiosamente\n\npor cada gota de agua\n\ndevolver un torrente.\n\nFuimos hechos asi,\n\nhechos para botar\n\nsemillas en el surco\n\ny estrellas en el mar\n\nY ¿ay! del que no agote,\n\nSeñor, su provisión Y al regresar te diga:\n\n¿Como alforja vacía\n\nestá mi corazón!\n\nThe concept of a poet diplomat may sound foreign to our current world view of where artists fit into political discourse, but it was common 100 years ago and a requirement 1,000 years ago to be recorded in history. The idea that oration and words, creativity and inspiration were a personal trait of leaders to get a mandate from the populace to be fit to lead seems incredulous given the way some of our leaders torture the English language and have abandoned all measure of civility. If good leadership and poetry in the way a leader – leads, the way in which they speak, the way in which they think, is something to be admired, respected and even required than how should we evaluate the fitness of the candidates we will be choosing from this fall in the upcoming election? An idea that poetry is not something foreign on pages of obscure books, but lives and breathes in the words we use, is a concept I would argue that is precisely what is in short supply in our current endeavors.\n\nIf you do a search on google on Miguel Ángel Asturias and click on images, there is not a one that I could find where he is smiling. His was not an easy life. Born and raised in Guatemala, he was forced to live in exile much of his adult life abroad, so dangerous were the socialist notions of social justice and importance of protecting indigenous cultures in Latin America that he espoused and were prominent themes in his poetry, novels and plays. His most famous novel El Senor Presidente, was a scathing description of life under a ruthless dictator, common to much of Latin America unfortunately both then and now.\n\nAsturias was involved with the Surrealist movement in Europe while living abroad and is credited with bringing the concepts of magical realism and a modernist style to Latin American literature, inspiring a generation of writers. After years of exile and marginalization for his political views he received broad recognition in the 1960’s when he was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet Union and the Nobel Peace Prize for Literature, becoming only the second Latin America Nobel winner, following Gabriela Mistral who I showcased in the previous blog.\n\nWhat lessons could poetry teach us about how to speak at this uncertain and difficult time? What examples can we take from difficult periods in the past and how did poets and poet diplomats navigate those times with their words to inspire change and point a direction to a hopeful future? What words should we be using to avoid marginalization of the powerless and keep hope where it belongs, in our minds and hearts? For our problems are man made, and can be solved by man….And we are all mortal.\n\nGesture with Both Hands Tied\n\nMarcelo Hernandez Castillo (1988 – )\n\nI’m going to open the borders of my hunger\n\nand call it a parade.\n\nBut I’m lying if I said I was hungry.\n\nIf dying required practice,\n\nI could give up the conditions for being alone.\n\nI undress in the sun and stare at it\n\nuntil I can stand its brightness no longer.\n\nWhy is it always noon in my head?\n\nI’m going to run outside and whisper,\n\nor hold a gun and say bang,\n\nor hold a gun and not do anything at all.\n\nThe lamps that wait inside me say\n\ncome, the gift is the practice,\n\nthe price is the door\n\nDeath Sonnets I\n\nby Gabriela Mistral (1889 – 1957)\n\nFrom the icy niche where men placed you\n\nI lower your body to the sunny, poor earth.\n\nThey didn’t know I too must sleep in it\n\nand dream on the same pillow.\n\nI place you in the sunny ground, with a\n\nmother’s sweet care for her napping child,\n\nand the earth will be a soft cradle\n\nwhen it receives your hurt childlike body.\n\nI scatter bits of earth and rose dust,\n\nand in the moon’s airy and blue powder\n\nwhat is left of you is a prisoner.\n\nI leave singing my lovely revenge.\n\nNo hand will reach into the obscure depth\n\nto argue with me over your handful of bones.\n\nLos Sonetos de la Muerte\n\nby Gabriela Mistral\n\nI\n\nDel nicho helado en que los hombres te pusieron,\n\nte bajaré a la tierra humilde y soleada.\n\nQue he de dormirme en ella los hombres no supieron,\n\ny que hemos de soñar sobre la misma almohada.\n\nTe acostaré en la tierra soleada, con una\n\ndulcedumbre de madre para el hijo dormido,\n\ny la tierra ha de hacerse suavidades de cuna\n\nal recibir tu cuerpo de niño dolorido.\n\nLuego iré espolvoreando tierra y polvo de rosas,\n\ny en la azulada y leve polvareda de luna,\n\nlos despojos livianos irán quedando presos.\n\nMe alejaré cantando mis venganzas hermosas\n\n¡porque a ese hondor recóndito la mano de ninguna\n\nbajará a disputarme tu puñado de huesos!\n\nGabriel Mistral was the pseudonym for Lucila Godoy y Alcayaga, Mistral began writing poetry in her early twenties following the tragic death of her lover. Mistral was an educator by profession, teaching elementary, secondary school until her poetry made her famous. Her status in Latin America literature afforded her the opportunity to become an advocate for education in both Mexico and Chile. Mistral was active on cultural committees of the League of Nations, becoming the Chilean consul in Naples, Madrid and Lisbon. Mistral later taught Spanish literature in the United States at Columbia University, Middlebury College, Vassar College, and at the University of Puerto Rico.\n\nMistral’s Sonetos de la muerte (love poems in memory of the dead), made her known throughout Latin America, but her first heralded collection of poems, Desolación [Despair], was published in 1922. Mistral wrote poetry about many themes, but her volumes published in 1924 and 1938 dealt with childhood and maternity and tenderness. Mistral was recognized for her contributions to literature and won the Nobel Prize in 1948.\n\nI share below two translations of her poem Alondras, one by Langston Hughes and one by Ursula K. Le Guin. It’s interesting to see how each poet approached the poem and their different interpretations. I regret that my Spanish is not good enough to read it in the original and understand it more fully, but I am grateful that Mistral’s work inspired great minds to translate it into English. Do you have a favorite Mistral poem?\n\nAlondras\n\nby Gabriela Mistral\n\nBajaron a mancha de trigo\n\ny al acercarnos, voló la banda,\n\ny la alamede sd quedó\n\ndel azoro como rasgada.\n\nEn matorrales parcecen fuego;\n\ncuando suben, plata lanzada,\n\ny passan antes de que passen,\n\ny te rebanan la alabanza.\n\nSaben no más los pobres ojos\n\nque passó toda la bandada,\n\ny gritando llaman “alondras!”\n\na lo que sube, se pierde y canta.\n\nY en este aire malherido\n\nnos han dejado llenos de ansia,\n\ncon el asombro y el tremblor\n\na mitad del cuerpo y el alma….\n\nAlondras, hijo, nos cruzamos\n\nlas alondras, por la llanda!\n\nLarks\n\nby Gabriela Mistral\n\ntranslated by Langston Hughes\n\nThey came down in a patch of wheat,\n\nand, as we drew near,\n\nthe flock flew away\n\nand left the startled field quite empty.\n\nIn the thicket they look like fire;\n\nwhen they rise, like silver darting.\n\nAnd they go by even before they go,\n\ncutting through your wonder.\n\nOur poor eyes, knowing only\n\nthat the whole flock has gone,\n\ncry “Larks!” to those who rise,\n\nand are lost, and sing.\n\nIn the sorely wounded air\n\nthey leave us full of yearning,\n\nwith a wonder and a quiver\n\nin body and in soul…\n\nLarks, son! Above us sweep\n\nthe larks across the plain!\n\nLarks\n\nTranslated by Ursula K. Le Guin\n\nThey were in the scattered wheat.\n\nAs we came near, the whole flock\n\nflew, and the poplars stood\n\nas if struck by a hawk.\n\nSparks in stubble: when they rise,\n\nsilver thrown up in air.\n\nThey’re past before they pass,\n\ntoo quick for praise.\n\nEyes are too slow to see\n\nthe whole flock’s taken wing,\n\nand we shout, “Larks!”\n\nat what’s up–lost–singing.\n\nIn the air they wounded\n\nthey’ve left us with a longing,\n\na tremor, a wonder\n\nhalf of the body, half of the soul.\n\nLarks, child–see,\n\nlarks rise from the wheat!\n\n“That deeper meaning is where poetry approaches music, because you cannot put that meaning in words in an intellectually comprehensible way.”\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin\n\nHymn To Time\n\nby Ursula K. Le Guin\n\nTime says “Let there be”\n\nevery moment and instantly\n\nthere is space and the radiance\n\nof each bright galaxy.\n\nAnd eyes beholding radiance.\n\nAnd the gnats’ flickering dance.\n\nAnd the seas’ expanse.\n\nAnd death, and chance.\n\nTime makes room\n\nfor going and coming home\n\nand in time’s womb\n\nbegins all ending.\n\nTime is being and being\n\ntime, it is all one thing,\n\nthe shining, the seeing,\n\nthe dark abounding.\n\nI first came across Ursula K. Le Guin as a teenager in one of the new/used bookstores in Minneapolis. These were combination comic book, sci-fi fantasy, news stand and porn that existed back in the 1970’s and 1980’s. They were a little seedy and exactly the kind of thing as a teenager I found exciting. I came across a well read copy of the The Left Hand of Darkness and from there I looked to read Le Guin when ever I bumped into her again.\n\nLe Guin wrote fantasy, children’s books, novels, poetry and translations and did it all brilliantly. She won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for best novel, becoming the first woman to do so. Her book Cat Wings was a favorite of my daughter when she was little. Her translation of The Tao is completely unique of all that I have come across and the details around her choice of words in the translation provides insight that goes far beyond any other translation I have read. ( I think I own 4 or 5 different translations.) Her novels explore themes that are as relevant today as when they were written on topics like the environment, social justice, sexual liberation, gender equality, technological responsibility, and a moral code of right and wrong even if right does not always prevail.\n\nLe Guin’s writing career spanned more than 60 years and in that time she published 12 volumes of poetry along with everything else. If you know her for only her science fiction or novels, I recommend you check out some of her poetry, including her final volume of poetry – Finding My Elegy. Le Guin wrote poetry in a variety of styles, both highly structured and free verse. I completely agree with her sentiments that writing sonnets is difficult in part because so many brilliant ones already exist, its hard to think anything you write is unique. In several interviews, Le Guin shared some of her approach to writing poetry, here’s a quote from one below.\n\nThe sonnet is probably the form most people think of when you talk about poetic form, and I find them terribly difficult. I write very, very few anymore. Maybe because there are so many very very good sonnets. I don’t know, that does’t usually worry me. It’s just not a form that I work with very well. The quatrain, on the other hand, is a straight form in a way – just four lines, that’s it. There’s no other definition, but you can make it just as strict as you please with rhythm and rhyme and so on.\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin\n\nThe Fine Arts\n\nby Ursula K. Le Guin\n\nJUDGING BEAUTY, which is keenest,\n\nEye or heart or mind or penis?\n\nLust is blindest, feeling kindest,\n\nSight is strongest, thought goes wrongest."
