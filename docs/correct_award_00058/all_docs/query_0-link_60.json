        "text": "Born: 19-Oct-1899\n\nBirthplace: Guatemala City, Guatemala\n\nDied: 9-Jun-1974\n\nLocation of death: Madrid, Spain\n\nCause of death: unspecified\n\nRemains: Buried, Cimetière du Père Lachaise, Paris, France\n\nGender: Male\n\nRace or Ethnicity: Hispanic\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Author, Diplomat\n\nNationality: Guatemala\n\nExecutive summary: Guatemalan protest writer\n\nGuatemalan author Miguel Ángel Asturias had little patience with fiction written merely to entertain, believing instead that writing worth reading must serve a moral or political purpose. His passions were the rights of the Mayans and other Latin American natives, and a fierce indignation that his and other nations in the region were ruled by dictatorships or by proxy governments controlled by the United States. His novel El Señor Presidente (Mr President) was meant as a blistering attack on the regime of Manuel Estrada Cabrera, but can easily be read as a broader attack on dictatorships across Central and South America. His Hombres de Maiz (Men of Maize) illuminated the challenges of Mayans in adapting to modern technology, and El Papa Verde (The Green Pope) exposed the overbearing brutality of the United Fruit Company. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1967.\n\nAt the age of 22 he was a founder of the Popular University of Guatemala, a college for students unable to afford tuition at traditional colleges. He spent many years working as a reporter, and endured several extended stretches in exile from his native Guatemala over his political views. During more progressive times in his country he served in the diplomatic corps, with assignments in Mexico, Argentina, El Salvador, and France. His son, Rodrigo Asturias, became a guerrilla leader in Guatemala's long civil war, infamous under the alter ego Gaspar Ilom  a name borrowed from his father's novel Hombres de Maíz.\n\nFather: Ernesto Asturias (spice importer)\n\nMother: Maria Rosales de Asturias (teacher)\n\nWife: Clemencia Amado (m. 1939, div. 1947, two sons)\n\nSon: Rodrigo (guerrilla commander, \"Gaspar Ilom\", b. 1939, d. 2005)\n\nSon: Miguel Angel\n\nWife: Blanca Mora y Araujo (m. 1950)\n\nLaw School: Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala (1923)\n\nScholar: Anthropology, Sorbonne (1925-28)\n\nAdministrator: Co-Founder, Popular University of Guatemala (1921)\n\nChavez Prize 1923\n\nGalvez Award 1923\n\nLenin Peace Prize 1966\n\nNobel Prize for Literature 1967\n\nGuatemalan Ambassador to France (1966-70)\n\nGuatemalan Ambassador to El Salvador (1953-54)\n\nGuatemalan Attache to France (1952-53)\n\nGuatemalan Attache to Argentina (1947-52)\n\nGuatemalan Attache to Mexico (1946-47)\n\nExiled 1954\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nLa Arquitectura de la Vida Nueva (Architecture of the New Life) (1928, essays)\n\nLeyendas de Guatemala (Legends of Guatemala) (1930, short stories)\n\nSonetos (Sonnets) (1936, poetry)\n\nEl Señor Presidente (Mr. President) (1946, novel)\n\nHombres de Maíz (Men of Maize) (1949, novel)\n\nViento Fuerte (Strong Wind) (1950, novel)\n\nEl Papa Verde (The Green Pope) (1954, novel)\n\nWeekend en Guatemala (Weekend in Guatemala) (1956, short stories)\n\nLos Ojos de los Enterrados (The Eyes of the Interred) (1960, novel)\n\nObras Completas (Complete Works) (1967, anthology)\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Miguel Ángel Asturias\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
