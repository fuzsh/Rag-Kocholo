Sir Michael Stoute is 77 years old and he's been training since 1972, so he's been around the block a few times and he's certainly not about to be bamboozled or railroaded into saying something he doesn't want to say. That much becomes clear very quickly, although I've been here often enough to have expected no different.

The welcome is friendly. There's coffee on the table in the sunny conservatory, with a plate of biscuits alongside (some of them chocolate) and Stoute is in good form, but you should never confuse geniality with vulnerability where the big Barbadian is concerned. His guard is rarely down when a newspaper man is lurking.

Not that I'm trying to make off with the family silver, or even stable secrets. I'm merely trying to sate the fascination of Racing Post readers with up-to-date information on plans for Desert Crown, the 2022 Derby winner, who hasn't been seen in public since that memorable day at Epsom, but who, so I understand, is inching his way back to a racecourse reappearance.

The trouble is that what I want Stoute to say isn't quite the same as what Stoute wants to say, so we've reached something of an impasse.

"You want me to say King George, Arc and all that sort of thing," he guesses (and in fairness, he's not far wide of the mark), "but all that's a long way away."

He's not a man given to projection. He's worked with horses for longer than either of us would care to remember (I get a rare compliment for remembering the name of Fair Salinia, his 1978 Oaks winner) and it has taught him that looking too far into the future of fragile and capricious animals is a practice fraught with peril. Even one day at a time is stretching it a bit, so he fends off requests for pointless prediction or unwise extrapolation and simply tells the truth as far as he knows it.

It has been his way almost forever. There's a framed photo in his downstairs loo of a younger MR Stoute in cricket whites, demonstrating an effective forward defensive stroke, front foot down the wicket to counter any disconcerting movement off the pitch, maker's name presented square on to the no-doubt-frustrated bowler, with the caption: "Must have been too long in England."

To stretch an allegory, here is Stoute's method in a sporting nutshell: do the simple things properly; try your hardest to rule out unforeseen problems; do it with style but don't be tempted into doing what the bowler wants you to do; and in time the boundaries will flow.

Even perched in a wicker chair, the great man can sway imperceptibly, rendering the most ferocious journalistic bouncer as dangerous as a drowsy bluebottle, and he's on top form today.

"We're going to Sandown and we'll plan from there," he says, sticking unhurriedly to his own terms. "We don't have to set a programme up for him before we've got him back on the track. We hope to run him in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes and he's in strong work now because his race is just around the corner [on May 25]."

Times have changed a little at Freemason Lodge over the past couple of years. What was once a training behemoth, housing 160 horses, is now a slimmed-down model that currently caters for 83, from one yard rather than two.

"I wouldn't say it was a conscious trimming down, it evolves, just happens," says the trainer. "A nicer number? I wouldn't say it's nicer but it's easier, and I won't go back to 160 now. We're still in there pitching, though."

I broach last season's 'numbers', which reveal a mere 36 winners (down from 67 in 2021) from 247 runs (formerly 324), and ask him how happy he was with the year.

"Of course, it helped that we won the Derby and the Champion Stakes," he chuckles, as I glance, all too late, at the prize-money column that reads £2,921,356 (up from £1,573,745). There are clearly positives to be gleaned from the new reality and Stoute has always been an optimist. "It's a smaller operation," he concedes, "very different, but it's only May, so we'll see what we can unearth."

No extravagant promises, despite the presence of a Derby winner "in his playpen" after morning exercise. The campaign will unfold soon enough and we'll see if there are any more of the big moments â like the 82 Royal Ascot winners, the six King Georges, six Internationals, six Eclipses and eight Lockinges â that recently helped propel Stoute into the Qipco British Champions Series Hall of Fame, in which hallowed hall he joins Vincent O'Brien and Sir Henry Cecil.

It's a welcome public accolade from where I'm sitting, although you wouldn't know to listen to him that he's a great trainer at all, or one whose popularity with his peers and his fans has continued to grow through six decades.

"I'm very grateful to be in the Hall of Fame," he concedes graciously, "but you get that kind of recognition because of your horses and your owners and your staff. It's the teamwork that makes it happen and you're just the man up front."

You also get it for having been around a very long time, I suggest, before hastily retracting the suggestion that he's, shall we say, not as young as he used to be.

"No, that's fine, you let it flow," he deadpans, revelling in my awkwardness. "You'll be uncomfortable if you don't let it out."

I recover my equilibrium and try to make my admiration apparent less clumsily. I've been told this morning on Warren Hill that His newly crowned Majesty King Charles III recently visited Newmarket, and top of the agenda was a procession to the top of the Bury Road to visit Stoute.

"Well, I think he'd been in Cambridge and he was on his way to Sandringham," says the man who trained Estimate to win the 2013 Gold Cup for Charles's mother. It's a neat attempt at further deflection of praise, but he's one of the monarch's chosen few trainers, which has to count for something.

"Well, His Majesty was in town yesterday afternoon and came here to see some horses, a two-year-old and three three-year-olds," he concedes. "I hope it went well but I don't think he's had time to think much about it lately. I imagine it's been pretty hectic. I hope his visit was a good sign, though."

Right, I'm going to have another go. I've been dispatched to all corners of the ground this morning, but I'm as dogged as Geoffrey Boycott and as impervious to punishment as Brian Close, so I'm going to have another shot at Desert Crown.

"I think you're struggling a bit," says Stoute, looking as relaxed as Sir Garfield Sobers facing the fast bowling attack of the Newmarket Trainers XI, but he's reckoned without my resilience. Racing Post readers need to know more about the horse who may become one of the stars of a fascinating season, and I'm the man to deliver.

"So, Michael [he resolutely eschews his 'Sir'], has Desert Crown grown over the winter?" I begin again, hoping to hear news of unprecedented physical development.

There begins a lull the like of which is usually accompanied by tumbleweed blowing down the street, with perhaps a lonesome harmonica wailing in the background. Stoute picks up his phone, scrolls the way some people scroll to indicate the conversation is officially at an end, then scrolls a bit more. A minute later, I'm about to pack my bag and leave, when he puts the phone to his ear and speaks.

"Hi there, I've got a very inquisitive journalist up my arse," he explains, which isn't what I was hoping for but it'll do for starters.

He guffaws at the unheard response, which almost certainly doesn't reflect well on either me or my profession, and then gets down to business: "Desert Crown, what does he measure now as opposed to last spring?"

Two minutes later, the phone rings and we have our answer: "He's 16 hands, one and a half inches, and a year ago he was 16 hands and half an inch, so he's grown an inch in a year, but then they don't get smaller. And he has a good mind, which is important."

It's not that Stoute is naturally reluctant; he's charming company, great fun and a master of his craft, but he's told me before that, while he enjoys the racecourse â "the end product" as he calls it â he's at his happiest at home, "here with the athletes", rather than speculating idly about the future of his latest winner, and that much hasn't changed.

I feel we're making progress, though. He doesn't think raking over the coals of Desert Crown's season-ending injury would be productive, but he's warming to the rest of the narrative. He doesn't dispute that there may not be many more horses of this calibre to come in his career, but he doesn't concur, either. "I've never been a pessimist," he insists, and moves on with the tale.

"We just decided we wouldn't rush him back to squeeze in a race or two in the autumn," says the man whose sixth Derby win â this one under his newest ally in the saddle, Richard Kingscote â the son of Nathaniel provided.

"The owner was in complete agreement to give him a chance, not hurry him, and he's nearly there now, a very good-looking horse, beautifully made. You don't have too many Derby winners staying on at four, so everybody wants to see them come out and be champions, and we'll soon find out, but I don't lie awake at night fretting about him. What would be the point?

"It's a daily thing. You get your problems, your frustrations, your disappointments, occasionally the ecstasy. It's a rollercoaster, but I've always enjoyed it and I still enjoy it now."

But what of the campaign in more detail. What plans are afoot?

"Well, he gets a mile and a half, he's won a Dante, so he can go ten or 12. No, I didn't say he'd be at his best over ten, but we'll set him off over ten and we'll go from the race, not from today. So there we are. It's up to him now."

Stoute is in tuneful mood by now, perhaps because we're out in the garden of Harlech House â the home he moved into with his late wife, the sorely missed Coral, in 1989 â and he feels the interrogation is coming to a close.

He has a deep, resonant singing voice, somewhere between Bing Crosby and Brian Blessed, which rarely comes out with actual song lyrics but bounces along joyfully with 'bom-bom-boms' and 'tra-la-las', while he accompanies himself on a variety of mimicked instruments. He seems to have added a kazoo to his repertoire since I was last here, although it's not his finest hour.

He does, though, have plenty to sing about. He's had nine winners from his first 31 runners this year â at a gutsy 29 per cent strike-rate â the promising Nostrum is back cantering after the minor setback that ruled him out of the Guineas, and word is that Desert Crown has been seen working pleasingly with Champion Stakes winner and recent Prix Ganay third Bay Bridge.

Long-term plans may be understandably hard to come by, but hope lingers that this could be another vintage season in what has already been a quite remarkable career. Coaxing the best out of older horses is his forte, after all, and if patience truly is a virtue, then Stoute must be a candidate for sainthood.

"It's easier to be patient when you have owners who don't put you under pressure to rush horses," he shrugs. "You make errors with horses, a lot, and you continue to do so â nothing's written in stone as to methodology â but I've always been allowed to let horses develop before I've put them under serious pressure, and that helps hugely."

He may be right, a lot of his success since 1972 may be down to other people, and it is not as if he's been around as long as the copper beech tree he points to proudly across the lawn, which is estimated to have clocked up 450 years already; but surely he must be doing something right, surely all those perennial staff and owners must have stayed for a reason. I put it to him that he must be a very nice man to attract such loyalty and patronage.

"Yes, I'd say I'm very easy to get on with, some of the time," he concedes. And the rest of the time? "The rest of the time I'm probably a bit like you: a bit bloody awkward."

It is like a Michael Holding short ball heading for the windpipe, but I duck underneath it and look back down the pitch at him. I know I'm in trouble, but I'm damned if I'm going to back down.

I take guard again and remind him that last year, straight after the Derby, he was asked how Desert Crown compared to his first winner of the race, the legendary Shergar, 41 years earlier, and, rather uncharacteristically, he didn't swat the question away with mild contempt. In fact, he reportedly answered: "Shergar was very special and Desert Crown hasn't quite reached that stage, but he has potential."

"I can't remember saying that," says Stoute, recoiling from the very idea that he would have been so rash, "and I'm sure it wouldn't be the first time you've made something up, would it?"

He roars with laughter, as he often does, and I walk towards the pavilion after the most enjoyable innings defeat I've ever known. A morning with Sir Michael is never an easy ride or a source of glib quotes and fanciful predictions, but it is always a chance to savour the reflected glory of one of racing's true greats, one of its most enduring originals.

Which is why a season of glory for Desert Crown, however much the trainer would like to temper our excitement, is something to dream of.
