        "text": "On Aug. 19, 1973, two months before his 20th birthday, Pat Day won the first race of his career at obscure Prescott Downs in Arizona. Fewer than than 2,000 people were there, and the track photographer’s camera didn’t work, so there’s no winner’s-circle picture to mark the occasion.\n\nOn Nov. 10, 1984, about 2,800 winners later, Pat Day won the $3-million Breeders’ Cup Classic with a strong-willed colt named Wild Again. There were 64,000 fans at Hollywood Park, besides what seemed to be about 1,000 photographers in the winner’s circle, and nobody’s camera malfunctioned.\n\nDay’s arrival at the enclosure aboard Wild Again, amid a stewards’ inquiry that eventually exonerated his horse in a roughly run race, was seen from every angle. The picture of Day, his pink silks glistening in the mid-afternoon California sun, his face tilted in the direction of the heavens and his riding helmet raised high, is a study for posterity.\n\nThe crowd behind the winner’s circle might have thought that Day was saluting them, and actually that was Day’s immediate intention.\n\n“But then, I decided to thank God,” Day said. “I wasn’t thanking Him for the win, I was thanking Him for the moment.”\n\nAn admitted former cocaine user, the survivor of a failed marriage and an abortive two-year stay in New York during which he brawled in the jockeys’ room with Angel Cordero and loathed the big-city life style, Day says he became a “born-again” Christian in January of 1984.\n\nEven before that, though, he had put his career back on track. Day won 1,253 races from 1982 through 1984, leading the nation in wins all three years--a feat that had been accomplished only once before, by Bill Hartack in the 1950s.\n\nDay and his wife, Sheila Ann--she’s the sister of Santa Anita jockey Ray Sibille--live in a Chicago suburb, although they’re on the road much of the year when the 33-year-old rider competes in Kentucky and Arkansas. “I’m a country boy at heart,” Day says. “I love the open spaces.”\n\nDay has considered riding regularly in California, where the purses are considerably more lucrative than in the Midwest.\n\n“I’ll be riding at Churchill Downs later this year, then we’ll just have to see,” he said. “I don’t know what I’m doing a month from now, let alone next year. I kind of hate to give up what I have. I’m third in the country (in purses with $8 million) this year, and I’ve probably gone two months without riding (some of the idle time caused by the illness and then the death of his father in April).”\n\nDay didn’t win a Breeders’ Cup race last year at Aqueduct, his best finish from four mounts being a fifth on Au Bon Marche in the Juvenile Stakes. Saturday at Santa Anita, however, Day will be in the spotlight more than all the other jockeys except one. When entries were taken Wednesday for the third edition of the Breeders’ Cup, 79 horses were named, and Day will have a mount in all seven of the races worth $10 million. Only Laffit Pincay will be as busy.\n\nDay’s day will start with a ride aboard Pledge Card in the Juvenile. After that, he will ride on Anything for Love in the Juvenile Fillies, Love That Mac in the Sprint, Lieutenant’s Lark in the Mile, Lady’s Secret in the Distaff, Duty Dance in the Turf and Turkoman in the Classic. Two of Day’s horses have been installed by Jeff Tufts, the Santa Anita linemaker, as favorites, Turkoman at 8-5 in the Classic and Lady’s Secret at 4-5 in the Distaff.\n\nStrangely, Day has ridden only one of his Breeders’ Cup horses before. Day and Lady’s Secret have been inseparable most of the year, combining to win three major races in New York this fall alone. Turkoman’s regular jockey, Chris McCarron, is sidelined for at least six months because of a broken thigh bone, and Day got the mount because Gary Stevens, who won the Marlboro Cup with the colt, is committed to ride Precisionist in the Classic.\n\n“Experience riding a horse always helps,” Day said. “It’s bound to be beneficial. But I don’t think I’m coming into these races cold turkey. I may not have ridden these horses, but I’ve ridden against them in several races and know them that way.”\n\nIt was three months since Day had ridden Wild Again when they won the Classic, at 31-1, in 1984. A strong rider, Day needed all that strength during the stretch run to control his horse, with Gate Dancer, on the outside, coming over to crowd Slew o’ Gold and Wild Again attempting to come out from next to the rail. The stewards, finding only Gate Dancer at fault, dropped him from second to third. Wild Again reached the wire a nose before Gate Dancer, and Slew o’ Gold was only another half-length back.\n\n“I get goose bumps every time I talk about that race,” Day said. “The other half of the Slew o’ Gold entry (Mugatea) tried to duck out when we went past the finish line the first time, and my horse also tried to duck away. My horse was straining at the seams that day. He was grunting every time his feet left the ground.\n\n“Through the stretch, every time Slew o’ Gold came to us, my horse would dig in. I only hit him on the shoulder one time, because I was told that he didn’t like to be hit. I was trying to pull him back all through the stretch.\n\n“I didn’t think they could have taken my number down and made Slew o’ Gold the winner, because he was done and beat. Angel (Cordero, riding Slew o’ Gold) had every opportunity to run by me from the quarter pole on, but his horse just couldn’t do it.\n\n“I didn’t have any idea what the stewards would do, though. I just told them my version. I know one thing--I didn’t want to be kissed in, I wanted to win it if I deserved it.”\n\nThe Day mount who probably deserves to win Saturday is Lady’s Secret, who has dominated her division, winning on both coasts, all year long. But eight other horses were entered in the Distaff, including Classy Cathy, whose owner, Edward A. Cox Jr., is paying a supplemental fee of $120,000 for her to run.\n\n“Lady’s Secret is a machine,” Day said. “There aren’t words to describe how awesome she is. She’s well-proportioned, but she’s not a picture horse. She’s not the kind who would jump off the page at you if you saw a picture of her. But a picture doesn’t show how much heart this horse has.”\n\nShould Lady’s Secret win Saturday, the horde of photographers will surround the filly and Pat Day, just the way they did with Wild Again. Better than that time at Prescott Downs 13 years ago, when Day made the winner’s circle but missed the memento.\n\nTHE FIELDS\n\nJUVENILE\n\n2-YEAR-OLDS, COLTS AND GELDINGS.\n\nDISTANCE: 1 1/16 MILES.\n\nPP Horse Jockey Wgt Odds 1 Demon’s Begone Santos 122 5-1 2 f--Flying Lieutenant Toro 122 20-1 3 Capote Pincay 122 7-2 4 Alysheba Shoemaker 122 12-1 5 Orono Hawley 122 15-1 6 Polish Navy Romero 122 9-2 7 Gulch Cordero 122 5-1 8 Pledge Card Day 122 15-1 9 f--Gold on Green Valenzuela 122 20-1 10 Flying Newsboy Delahoussaye 122 12-1 11 Qualify Stevens 122 20-1 12 Bet Twice Perret 122 8-1 13 Damascus Drama Vasquez 122 20-1\n\nf--mutuel field\n\nTRAINERS (By post position): 1.
