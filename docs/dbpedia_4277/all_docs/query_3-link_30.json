        "text": "Yet, as he coasts towards his ninth trainers' title, Stoute also continues to be a man of mystery. His public face gives nothing away and is designed to do just that.\n\nTo the watching world, hanging on his every well-measured word, vainly hoping he might let slip something more than a crumb of encouragement for one of his horses, he is a source of perpetual frustration.\n\nYet, to the same admiring audience he is an icon, the consummate professional, utterly dedicated and single-minded and, most important of all, a man who delivers when it matters - time after time after time.\n\nEight championships, four Derbys, 13 British Classics in all (24 if you take in Ireland) and a glittering haul of international prizes have not come his way by accident.\n\nNor did his personal Who's Who of rich and powerful patrons - among them the Queen, the Aga Khan, Prince Khalid Abdullah, the Maktoums and the Niarchos family - arrive at his door by default.\n\nIn 1998 his achievements brought him a knighthood for services to tourism and sport in his native Barbados. \"It was a big surprise and a great honour,\" Stoute says. \"I think it had a lot to do with the international successes of my horses in the US, Dubai and Japan.\"\n\nNo doubt about it, Michael, as he declines to be called, is simply the best and, after 34 years in the job he shows no sign of easing up on himself or the opposition. So what is the secret of his remorseless success and why does he guard it so closely?\n\nAs we sit in the conservatory of Harlech House, the impressive period home that adjoins his Freemason Lodge stables in Newmarket, it is fascinating to hear this usually guarded individual revealing something of the nuts and bolts behind his genius.\n\nAs he speaks there are still traces of a lilting Bajan accent. \"A horse must have rhythm. He has to move like an athlete. Also, I never knew a good racehorse that didn't have a good head. I have a preference for small eyes and small ears.\"\n\nYears of canny observation or an instinctive feel? He laughs again. \"I really don't think it's that difficult. There's no mystery about it.\"\n\nNo mystery? Try telling that to punters. Half the fun of racing is looking for clues but with Stoute it takes a combination of Hercule Poirot and Sherlock Holmes.\n\nHalf the fun of racing is looking for clues but with Stoute it takes a combination of Hercule Poirot and Sherlock Holmes\n\n\"I'm happy to go on TV and talk to the press after a race,\" he says. \"But beforehand I believe in letting my horses do the talking. It's not my style to say, 'He's never been better.'\n\n\"We're running them because we think they're well. We don't need to be a tipping service.\"\n\nHis record over the years arguably says everything anyone could want to know. Having reached 60 without turning a hair, and now training a team of 165 horses, he is looking fit and focused and hungry for more.\n\n\"I'm as passionate about training as I ever was; the adrenalin still pumps. Working with class horses and being involved in the biggest races still excites me. We've been fortunate to have a lot of international success and that is particularly thrilling.\n\n\"But the key for me comes at the end of every season when you turn over 55-60 per cent of your horses and get your new recruits.\n\n\"Having said that, I especially enjoy having classy older horses - you get to know them so much better and that makes training them easier.\"\n\nStoute has experienced extraordinary success with older horses including Singspiel and Pilsudski, slow starters who were allowed to develop at their own pace.\n\nBoth were successful in the Japan Cup; Singspiel won the Dubai World Cup, Coronation Cup, Juddmonte International and Canadian International; Pilsudski the Eclipse Stakes, Champion Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes and got the better of Singspiel in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Woodbine in Canada in 1996 in which they finished first and second.\n\nPatience is the word most frequently used to explain Stoute's uncanny gift, while Michael Holding, the former West Indies fast bowler and one of Stoute's many cricketing pals, points to his 'amazing photographic memory'.\n\nHowever, James Fanshawe, Stoute's assistant for seven years and now a successful trainer in his own right, says: \"I would say it's much more about relaxation. Michael's yard is always a fun place to work. The whole atmosphere is very relaxed and that filters through to the horses.\n\n\"The lads often want to get on with things but Michael will not be rushed. He does it his way.\n\n\"He'll be humming or whistling (said to be a sign he fancies one strongly) - usually 'My Way' or 'Some Enchanted Evening' - and he seems to be writing things on his hand when he's watching the gallops. He's not actually writing anything but it helps him make mental notes.\"\n\nAs Fanshawe's observations suggest, Stoute is a man who engenders loyalty. Many of his staff have been with him for decades, notably Jimmy Scott, travelling head lad for 32 years, and Stuart Messenger, head lad for 29 years.\n\nStoute reciprocated when he stayed staunchly loyal to his jockey, Kieren Fallon, the six-times champion, when he was implicated in the alleged race-fixing scandals that culminated in his being banned from racing in Britain earlier this month.\n\n\"All I can tell you is I was never dissatisfied with Kieren's riding,\" Stoute says. \"He is a great jockey and I thoroughly enjoyed our relationship.\"\n\nFallon was lured by the mega bucks of the Aidan O'Brien-Coolmore set up in Ireland and left Stoute shortly afterwards, before the start of the 2005 season. Stoute has not signed up a new stable jockey, employing Ryan Moore and Robert Winston for most of his runners.\n\nIn typical fashion he rationalises this unusual situation by saying: \"We have to be patient. We're looking carefully and we will select the person we want in due course. There is no rush and no decision is imminent.\"\n\nOf the betting scandals that have led to charges against Fallon and other racing professionals, Stoute comments: \"It's always been part of the game. The sport is far better policed now than when I got started.\"\n\nThose words came back to haunt him shortly after we spoke when late on Monday he was fined £6,500 over the running and riding of Florimund, partnered by Stephen Davies, at Windsor.\n\nHe is clearly livid over the allegation of non-trying but confines himself to saying: \"I will definitely be appealing.\"\n\nAppealing in a very different form has been part his life in the guise of his other great passion, cricket.\n\nHis involvement has been as a keen amateur and he will reminisce for hours about the sport, especially his early years in Barbados when he witnessed giants of the game playing at the Kensington Oval.\n\n\"I was an impressionable lad and watching men like Sobers, Weekes, Walcott and Worrall fed my passion. Hutton's England in 1957 was the first touring team I saw and I also watched FS Trueman on his first tour.\n\n\"Compared to England where you have to take a day off to go to some of the Test grounds, getting to The Oval was no big deal.\"\n\nIn 1987 he fulfilled a dream by playing at the famous venue with a Newmarket XI. \"Cricket is a religion in Barbados,\" he says. \"It was a wonderful experience to play against some of the great names such as Sobers, Griffiths, Hall and Seymour Nurse.\"\n\nThe son of a Barbados police commissioner, Stoute has two children, Caroline, 34 and Robert, 32. Neither has any involvement with racing, although Caroline works for Sky Sports.\n\nHe left Barbados for England when he was 19 with little more than a pocketful of hope\n\nHis own interest in racing was kindled as a child by regular visits (via a ladder over the wall) to Garrison Savannah racetrack that was next door to his home.\n\nHe left Barbados for England when he was 19 with little more than a pocketful of hope and, having assisted three trainers, Pat Rohan, Tom Jones and Doug Smith, for seven years, he rented a yard in Newmarket and set up with just 15 horses. \"It wasn't something I thought too hard about,\" he says. \"When you're that age you have no fear.\"\n\nLooking back over the golden decades, he describes his Breeders Cup one-two as the most satisfying moment of his career, placing it above Shergar's 10-length romp in the 1981 Derby.\n\n\"Because it was my first Derby and everyone expected him to win, Shergar's victory was more of a relief, a case of job done. He was the most talented middle-distance horse I have ever trained.\n\n\"Running him in the St Leger on very heavy ground was a mistake and took a lot out of him, which is why he missed the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and went straight to stud.\"\n\nReflecting on Shergar's kidnapping, he says: \"That has been well documented. I think it was the IRA who took him but they hadn't done their homework and didn't realise he was owned by a syndicate of international breeders.\n\n\"They thought they could just deal with the Aga Khan and he would pay the ransom. He had just one season at stud. It was such a waste.\"\n\nStoute's attention will turn to Glorious Goodwood this week, where new champions will be unleashed and more special memories built. Would he break the habit of a lifetime and suggest one to put your shirt on?\n\n\"It all depends on the opposition,\" he says with that familiar laugh.\n\n\"But we're running Jeremy in the Lennox Stakes (now the Betfair Cup) on Tuesday instead of the Sussex Stakes. He would have to have a good chance.\"\n\nObserver"
