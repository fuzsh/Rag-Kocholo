        "text": "The five-year-old mare is the only one of her sex in the 18-runner field for the Group One event.\n\n\"She seems in good order and has wintered well,” said Chris Richardson, representing the Cheveley Park owners.\n\n“Obviously it is a tough ask taking on some strong colts. She goes on any ground and it is a nice starting point for her.\n\n\"Sir Michael had always had this race as the target for her and from it we will work out which way go for Royal Ascot.\n\n\"She is a light-framed filly but she won her maiden first time out so we know she can go well fresh, although this is a different kettle of fish. However, she deserves to take her place in the line up.\"\n\nRichard Hannon saddles two of the leading fancies with last year's Guineas winner Night Of Thunder and the 2013 champion juvenile Toormore. Both are having their first run of the season.\n\nHannon said: \"In the end we decided against giving Night Of Thunder a racecourse gallop, we worked him at home and he really impressed us.\n\n\"He should be fit enough to win, although he will improve for the run to a point and we hope that he will keep improving through the season.\n\n\"He's a Classic winner - he deserves the utmost respect for that - and he would be right up there with all the star milers that we have had over recent years.\n\n\"Toormore will also improve for the run. He is less of a flashy worker than Night Of Thunder and though he won first time out last season, that was only a Group Three so this is a much stronger race.\n\n\"He came back to form on his final run of last season and if he were to repeat that, he would go very close on Saturday. I hope that we have got him back to near his best again now.\"\n\nMarco Botti's Moohaarib looked a much improved performer when winning a Listed race at Ascot having finished third in the Lincoln on his return.\n\n\"Moohaarib seems well after the race. He did an easy piece of work at the weekend which we were happy with and he seems in good order. This is a big step up in class, but we have come to that stage where we find out how good he is,\" said Botti.\n\n\"He was very impressive at Ascot and quickened up well, having travelled well, but he is taking on a different class of opposition so we will see what he has got to offer and whether he can take the next step up.\n\n\"His two runs have been positive this year and he lost nothing in defeat in the Lincoln. I don't think he had a hard race at Ascot, this is different company but we very much hope for a good run.\"\n\nAljamaaheer was third in this two years ago and arguably has not won the amount of races his talent suggests he should have.\n\nAngus Gold, racing manager for owner Sheikh Hamdan, said: \"Aljamaaheer is fine and came out of his run at Leicester in good shape according to Roger Varian. He didn't get a clear run at Leicester that day - he seems to be a horse who is good at being unlucky.\n\n\"He retains plenty of ability and could run very well in the Lockinge. He has run well over every trip in the past couple of years and I have no doubt he has a big win in him if things fall in his favour.\"\n\nCustom Cut has made great strides since joining David O'Meara and his improvement shows no sings of stopping given he won a Group Two at Sandown on his return.\n\nO'Meara said: \"I'm really looking forward to running him. The straight track might not be in his favour as I think he's better round a bend, and there's loads of runners, unusually for a Group One.\n\n\"He's such a fantastic horse to train and looks like he's come on again. Any more rain will be a help, we know he handles it and it might just take the sting out of a few of the others.\n\n\"He's a classy horse and has the run under his belt, which some of the others don't.\"\n\nHere Comes When was second to Custom Cut at Sandown and his trainer Andrew Balding thinks he is going in under the radar. Balding also runs Tullius.\n\n\"I think Here Comes When is an overlooked horse. He has twice won at Group Two level and ran a good trial when second on his reappearance at Sandown last month,\" said Balding.\n\n\"Any rain will also help Tullius. He was a bit disappointing when we ran him over 10 furlongs at Sandown last time. However, he was second in the Lockinge last year and won well on his reappearance over a mile at Doncaster.\n\n\"I think they are two lively outsiders.\"\n\nPeter Chapple-Hyam's Arod was fourth in the Derby last year but drops back down to a mile.\n\n\"Arod is very well. It was a good comeback at Newmarket and obviously a mile is a new thing for him,\" said the Newmarket handler.\n\n\"He raced a bit keenly over further last season and so that is why we are giving it a go.\n\n\"He is in the Queen Anne Stakes and the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot, so Newbury will give us a pointer as to where we go with him this season.\"\n\nJames Fanshawe said of his lively outsider Hors De Combat: \"The Lockinge looks a tough race but there are no other options for him at the moment.\n\n\"He is in good form and seems to have come on for the run at Ascot.\"\n\nDavid Simcock runs both Breton Rock and Trade Storm and said: \"It looks a very open race and that is why a lot of horses are taking their chances in it.\n\n\"It is a case of the more rain the better for Breton Rock, while Trade Storm will not run if there is soft in the description.\"\n\nThe value each-way bet is Master Carpenter, on offer at 66-1. His form of late does not amount to much but if he returns the running in last year’s Greenham at Newbury he must go close.\n\nOn that occasion he finished third behind Kingman with Night Of Thunder in second place.\n\nAl Shaqab Lockinge Stakes (Hills) betting: 5-2 Night Of Thunder, 5-1 Integral, 8-1 Custom Cut, 9-1 Toormore, 14-1 Here Comes When, Moohaarib, 20-1 Captain Cat, Tullius, Yuften, 25-1 Aljamaaheer, Arod, Breton Rock, Cougar Mountain, Hors De Combat, Trade Storm, 33-1 Cable Bay, Top Notch Tonto, 66-1 Master Carpenter, (EW 1/5 Odds Places 1,2,3)"
