On his final appearance of the season he finished fourth to Luqman in the Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury.\n\n1986: three-year-old season\n\nGreen Desert began his second season by winning the European Free Handicap over seven furlongs at Newmarket and then finished second to Dancing Brave in the 2000 Guineas.
