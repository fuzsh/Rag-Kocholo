        "text": "Robnorth.You say a few years.A \"few\" means what? Would you believe twenty?Fifteen?Henry had a virus when led to big owners deserting him until he got back on stream last year 2010.Did he have classic winners in the ninties? One ? two? Last I remember Fallon was riding for the yard. The question now is does Stouty have a virus in the yard? He won the Derby last year so why would he not have the young horses coming along? Oxx has be overwhelmed since he won the Derby with STS.He even hired back Johnny from Ballydoyle.Do you have an ear to the ground?Seems awfully quick for Cormack to even hint about the ending of a wonderful career.The Derby and the Arc last year and now this!Although I suppose tyos are the life blood of any flat yard.\n\nFar too early to make such statements. He’s had bad years before, and Cecil’s decline was because of extramural scandals, not because he was thought to be any the worse a trainer.\n\nCarlton House\n\nis still a top-notch 3yo, though not alas at 12F. One rotten apple doesn’t make a barrel. Or is that the wrong metaphor. Perhaps I mean one missing swallow doesn’t make a winter…\n\nGame will be up for SMS when he’s dead and not before and he may still train a winner or two after he’s gone\n\nNot every season can be great especially in a market that is more competitive than ever.\n\nSMMS has millions behind him with massive loyalty from his owners. He’s a living legend and a long long way from being finished.\n\nI suppose he’s being more selective these days so when thing go wrong it stands out more but name a yard who doesn’t have the odd bad season.\n\nFunny old game racing one season you’ll win everything going and the next your horses have gone so far up the handicap they win nothing and everyone wonders what went wrong.\n\nNo one can find the next Harbinger or Workforce year in year out."
