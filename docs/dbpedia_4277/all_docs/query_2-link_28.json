        "text": "Introduction\n\nHorse Racing (Old Moon Grand Prix) is an activity in Black Desert where players can race against each other to cross the finish line first. All you need to get started is a racehorse.\n\nRace Horses can only be bought from Gula, the stable keeper at Stonetail Horse Ranch and cost 30 million silver. They are called Horse Emblem: Giorga Brisa\n\nOld Moon Grand Prix is available from 7 AM to 10 PM (UTC) daily.\n\nOnce you’ve bought a racehorse, register it at the stable.\n\nAll racehorses are tier 1 and currently cannot be upgraded or bred like other horses.\n\nYou can enhance your horse stats though by equipping special gear designed for race horses.\n\nRace horses can be brought into the normal world to practice but do not have the same skills and mechanics as normal horses.\n\nNow that you have your horse and it is registered to a stable, you can join a horse race by clicking the Racing UI at the top of the screen.\n\nYou can also join by going to the ESC menu > Life > Old Moon Grand Prix.\n\nSelect a horse race track from the drop-down menu and then enter the race.\n\nYou will be placed into matchmaking queue for the horse race, and then teleported directly to the starting line once the race is ready to start.\n\nDuring the Race/Horse Mechanics\n\nAfter being teleported to the starting line of the race, you will notice a special Stable Keeper at the side called Miles. You must speak to Miles to take out your racehorse and can also receive daily/weekly quests from him.\n\nYou will see the starting line glowing red with the words “race start”, get on your racehorse and wait at the starting line for the race to begin.\n\nDuring the race, you must pay attention to your Race Horse UI and use your horse skills effectively.\n\nThe speed indicator shows what level of speed your horse is currently at\n\nThe speed bar will fill up over time when your horse is running. You must press Q when the bar fills to go up to the next speed level\n\nYou can only use Instant Accell (by pressing F) when your horse stamina bar is full\n\nYou can instantly go to the highest speed level if you use Instant Accell when your horse stamina bar is full\n\nYou can press SPACE + W at the start of a race to instantly go to the 4th-speed level and then the horse will shortly drop to the 3rd speed level\n\nYou can drift with your horse using S + A/D. This is good for sharp turns and will also give some stamina to your horse, but will drop your speed level\n\nYou can drift while using Instant Accell and it will not drop your speed level, it is useful to save your Instant Accell for sharp turns and spam drift without losing speed\n\nRewards\n\nYou will gain rewards for participating in a horse race, even if you do not finish the race in time. Higher reward boxes are given for placing higher in the race. Rewards will be sent to your Black Spirit’s Safe.\n\nPlace in Race Reward Box Contents of Reward Box 1st High Wind Grand Prix Box Grand Prix Gold Trophy x1\n\nOld Moon Grand Prix Coin x40\n\nGrand Prix Participant Certificate x1 2nd Windy Grand Prix Box Grand Prix Silver Trophy x1\n\nOld Moon Grand Prix Coin x25\n\nGrand Prix Participant Certificate x1 3rd Draughty Grand Prix Box Grand Prix Bronze Trophy x1\n\nOld Moon Grand Prix Coin x25\n\nGrand Prix Participant Certificate x1 4th – 10th Breezy Grand Prix Box Old Moon Grand Prix Coin x10\n\nGrand Prix Participant Certificate x1 Failed to finish Wispy Grand Prix Box Old Moon Grand Prix Coin x1\n\nGrand Prix Participant Certificate x1\n\nGrand Prix Trophy items are used to create Mansion furniture.\n\nGrand Prix Participant Certificates can be exchanged at Jetina, the Old Moon Manager\n\nin each town and major city.

Each race track has a start/finish line and several checkpoints which are indicated on the images below with a green line.\n\nBalneos: Velia Coastal Cave\n\nTips for this race track:\n\nAt the 7th checkpoint, you head into the cave at Coastal Cliff. This is a narrow part of the track and you want to try and drift and then use your Instant Accell to go around the sharp corners between checkpoints 8 and 9.\n\nAfter coming out of the cave there are 2 sharp turns as you go up the cliffside. Use drift and rotate your camera while holding W, this will allow you to do a 180-degree turn but will drop your speed by 1. At the second turn, drift then use Instant Accell to get back to max speed.\n\nPractice this part of the race track to get your timing perfect on your drift. The cave and cliffside are the hardest parts of this track and where most players struggle.\n\nMediah: Stonetail Horse Ranch\n\nTips for this racetrack:\n\nThis track follows the racetrack at Stonetail Horse Ranch. It is the easiest of the 3 tracks in my opinion and does not have any sharp turns compared to the other two tracks.\n\nThe trick with this racetrack is to know when to use your Instant Accell on the long straight parts of the track.\n\nThere are many turns where you can simply hold A or D early and make it around the bend without having to lose speed using drift.\n\nSave your Instant Accell and drift when you are coming up to the sharp turn at the very north part of the track.\n\nWatch out for the fences, rocks, and buildings along the track as those are where players usually end up getting stuck and dropping their place in the race.\n\nCalpheon: Anti-Troll Fortification\n\nTips for this racetrack:\n\nIn my opinion, this track can be the most difficult and you can quickly get left behind if you don’t know it well. At the beginning of the track, you are going through the center of Calpheon which has lots of objects you can get caught on. However, if you learn the tricks of this track then the rest of it is very simple.\n\nThere is a sharp turn before the bridge when you are coming close to the 3rd checkpoint, use your drift here to make the sharp turn with Instant Accell\n\nThe track between the 3rd and 4th checkpoint is the worst part of the track. After going across the bridge you will come to the fountain area and must be careful not to get caught on it. Then there is a small archway you must go through. This part requires you to drift perfectly in line with the archway to go straight through. Here is where most players get stuck and quickly fall behind. Slow down if you really need to so you don’t get stuck. If you do get caught in the room with the barricade then remember to use Escape to put you back on the track safely.\n\nAfter the archway, the rest of the track is fairly straight forward and there are not many sharp turns. You should be able to get around most of the track without needing to use drift and slow down. The only other one to really look out for is just before the bridge at the 6th checkpoint.\n\nWatch out for clutter as you go through Northern Wheat Plantation and use your drift to avoid objects blocking the path.\n\nRace Horse Gear\n\nThere is special horse gear that can only be equipped on the Giorga racehorse and each piece can only be obtained by exchanging Old Moon Grand Prix Coin x10.\n\nThe Giorgiaro set can be enhanced up to +10 using a certain amount of Black Stone.\n\nThe amount of Black Stones you need goes up by 1 for each level of enhancement.\n\nFor example, to enhance to +1, you require 1 Black Stone, for +2 you require 2 Black Stones, and for +10 you would require 10 Black Stones.\n\nUnlike other horse gear, the Giorgiaro set does not require any failstacks and has 100% chance of success. However, each time it is enhanced the item will lose 10 max durability.\n\nIcon Item Enhancment Effect Giorgiaro Champron Acceleration +0.1% Giorgiaro Saddle Turn +0.1% Giorgiaro Barding Movement Speed +0.1% Giorgiaro Stirrups Brake +0.1% Giorgiaro Horseshoe Movement Speed +0.1%"
