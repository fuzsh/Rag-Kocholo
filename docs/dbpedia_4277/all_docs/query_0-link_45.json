        "text": "Going For Gold (2006) is by Barathea out of a Darshaan mare called Flash Of Gold who was half sister to Group 2 Ribblesdale Stakes winner Phantom Gold. This is a family that The Queen has developed over the years and had some success. Going For Gold won a race at Haydock Park as a three year old over a mile and a half and reached a top rating of 79. She was purchased by James Ortega Bloodstock at the Tattersalls December sale in 2011 for 15,000 guineas.\n\nThe best of her siblings have been Green Desert colt Firestreak who was top rated 98 and Motivator colt Mustard who reached 102 whilst Galileo colt Moidore also reached 90 on the flat. Mother Flash Of Gold did not win a race when being trained by Sir Michael Stoute but she did achieve a good rating of 80 and was clearly not without ability. She currently has a Sixties Icon 2015 filly named Fleeting View, a 2016 colt by Motivator called Metaphor and a 2017 colt by Paco Boy called On Parade. Flash Of Gold's 2014 filly by Paco Boy called Mayan Gold did not race but is now a broodmare.\n\n\"Goldie's\" first foal to hit the track was Paco Boy filly Chicadoro who was the first horse bred by James Ortega Bloodstock to run in its colours and she won as a two year old before getting black type on coming second in the Pretty Polly Stakes at Newmarket. She was then entered for the Ribblesdale but did not appreciate the softish ground nor the increased trip after coming into the straight in a leading position. She was sold to race in the USA and has won a race for new owner Peter Deutsch and new trainer Christophe Clement. In 2019 she was retired to become a broodmare. Going For Gold's second foal Aureana, a much bigger filly than Chicadoro, raced once as a two year old but was unplaced and had some pelvic issues at three and so we decided to retire her mid 2017 to become a broodmare. She visited Foostepsinthesand in February 2018 and has produced a filly foal subsequently named Pretty Persuasive who is in training in France in 2021. After Aureana came a 2015 Bated Breath colt, Kaanoon, who was sold to Shadwell and was in training with Roger Varian. He won three of his first six races as a three year old and reached a rating of 98. He ran an excellent debut at Meydan on his four year old debut in 2019 but has not been out since. Another colt followed, sired by Kyllachy (Be Fair) who was sold at Tattersalls Book 2 in October 2017 for 36.000 guineas and was in training with John Joseph Murphy. In late 2019 he moved to the UK to be trained by Tony Carroll and has won three races with a rating high of 69 by May 2021. Goldie was not covered in 2016 and then was covered by Paco Boy producing a 2018 filly (Galerna) who did not run. 2018 saw her visit Territories but she unfortunately had twins and lost them both and could not get back in foal on a subsequent visit. In 2019 she was covered by Bated Breath which resulted in a 2020 filly foal who was sold to Sylvester Kirk at Tattersalls Book 3 Yearling Sale in 2021 and has been named Mellow Mood. She made her debut in September 2022 coming 4th and should do better in time over longer distances. Going For Gold had another filly foal in 2021 by Havana Gold who will probably go into training with us and in 2022 she had a Territories colt. She will now be rested for 2022 and return to be covered in 2023."
