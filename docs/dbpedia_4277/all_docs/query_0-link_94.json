        "text": "News for 2016 Lanwades successes\n\n28th November 2016\n\nLANWADES STALLLION PARADE\n\nYesterday, Lanwades invited mare owners to come and view all the stallions - please click link to see some photos from the day - http://www.lanwades.com/stallion_parade/index.html\n\n5th October 2016\n\nRAUSING'S 'A' TRAIN STEAMS FOR GENERATIONS\n\nLanwades Stud's success with foundation mare http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/215573/rausings-a-train-steams-for-generations\n\n3rd October 2016\n\nANOTHER GROUP 1 WINNER FOR SIR PERCY\n\nSIR PERCY sired his second Group 1 winner for 2016 when his son SIR JOHN HAWKWOOD won the Gr.1 Metropolitan at Randwick on Saturday. He was well positioned just off the pace and hit the front at the top of the home straight to record a length and a quarter win in this twelve furlong race. SIR JOHN HAWKWOOD began his career with Sir Michael Stoute winning first time out as a three-year-old at Windsor. He then went on to win three more races including a valuable handicap at York before being transferred down under. He has since won the Gr.3 Sky High Stakes at Rosehill in March this year and has been placed in the Gr.2 Brisbane Cup, Gr.3 JRA Cup and the Gr.3 Neville Sellwood Stakes and a second place in the Gr.3 Kingston Town Classic before recording his first Group 1 victory. Bred by Ballymacoll Stud Farm Ltd, he is now owned by Waratah Thoroughbreds and trained by John Thompson and has won nearly Â£500,000 in prize money. SIR PERCY has sired 37 individual Stakes horses which now includes two Group 1 winners SIR JOHN HAWKWOOD and WAKE FOREST.\n\n15th September 2016\n\nBOBBYâS KITTEN â GR.1 BREEDERSâ CUP TURF SPRINT WINNER RETIRES TO LANWADES FOR 2017\n\nBOBBY'S KITTEN, Group One winning Miler/Sprinter, will be first stallion son of outstanding Champion Turf sire KITTEN'S JOY at stud in Europe.\n\n\"We are delighted and proud here at Lanwades to have acquired such an exciting stallion prospect\", said Kirsten Rausing, owner and general manager of Lanwades. \"BOBBY'S KITTEN (named, like FRANKEL, for the late Bobby Frankel) is a Graded Stakes winner at 2 and 3 in the US, and a Stakes winner in Ireland this year. A specialist miler, he had the speed to beat NO NAY NEVER as a 3yo in the Gr.1 Breeders' Cup Turf Sprint over 6.5f. His spectacular and unforgettable performance in this race has to be seen to be believed and is available to view on www.lanwades.com.\n\nAt Lanwades, we stand Derby winners SEA THE MOON (first foals 2016) and SIR PERCY (Gr.1 sire 2016), as well as International Gr.1 winner ARCHIPENKO (a Gr.1 sire with his first crop). BOBBY'S KITTEN, with his notable affinity for turf racing, marvellous temperament, outstanding physique and racing durability, will significantly complement our other stallions. In addition to this, he will of course provide a fantastic outcross opportunity for the majority of European mares.\"\n\nClick here for more details\n\nBOBBY'S KITTEN can be viewed - by appointment - at Lanwades.\n\n29th August 2016\n\nVA BANK WINS GR.3 IN BADEN-BADEN TO REMAIN UNBEATEN IN 12 STARTS\n\nVA BANK (IRE) a now four-year-old son of ARCHIPENKO was a most impressive winner of the feature race on the card at Baden-Baden yesterday - the Gr.3 Preis der Sparkassen Finanzgruppe over 10 furlongs to remain unbeaten in 12 starts. VA BANK is trained in Poland and was the country's Horse of the Year and Triple Crown winner last year. This was his first black-type victory and first run outside Poland. He made his challenge over a furlong out to win well by a length and a half with a further six lengths back to the rest of the field. VA BANK was bred in Ireland by Airlie Stud and was sold at the Tattersalls September Yearling Sales. He is from the second crop of ARCHIPENKO and is his sire's 9th Stakes winner which also includes Gr.1 winner MADAME CHIANG.

CLEONTE, who has been running well in both Group and Listed races, was settled at the rear of the field for much of the race before making rapid headway to come home the two and a half-length winner. Owned and bred by Baron Edouard de Rothschildâs Ecurie de Meautry, CLEONTE had won at Saint-Cloud on his second start and had finished second in Listed Prix Francoise Mathet and fourth in Gr.3 Prix Noailles.\n\n27th June 2016\n\nA NEW STAKES WINNER FOR SIR PERCY\n\nLanwades-bred MADRILENO was a most impressive winner of the valuable Listed Gran Premio de Madrid yesterday in Spain. It was run over 2500m at La Zarzuela and the son of SIR PERCY came home 4 3/4 lengths clear of his stablemate to record a new course record. MADRILENO was bred by Lanwades Stud and was sold as a foal. He had previously been campaigned in France where he was twice Listed-placed. He is now trained by G Arizkorreta Elosegui and was gaining his first Listed win after finishing third in a Listed race for his new connections back in October last year. MADRILENO is the son of juvenile winner ALIZADORA and his third dam is Lanwades foundation mare ALRUCCABA.\n\n10th June 2016\n\nARCHIPENKO â HEADS THE LIST OF FIRST SEASON SIRES IN ARGENTINA\n\nARCHIPENKO who stood for only one season at Haras La Quebrada is currently the leading first season sire in Argentina. To date the progeny of ARCHIPENKO have won five races and the filly SILVER LOOK is probably the most talked about as she was second in Gr.1 Grand Premio Jorge de Atucha and the Gr.3 Fortunato Damiani. ARCHIPENKO is also in 17th place in the main sires list. These statistics are very encouraging for the future for a stallion who has only one crop to represent him in Argentina and whom may be expected to produce more staying types.\n\n31st May 2016\n\nLEROIDESANIMAUX 2000 - 2016\n\nChampion racehorse and sire LEROIDESANIMAUX has died at Lanwades, further to complications following a minor paddock accident earlier this year. LEROIDESANIMAUX was foaled in Brazil. He ran twice in Argentina at 2 years, gaining his maiden win and being second in a Gr.1 race there. Transferred to the USA, he did all his remaining racing there except when setting a world record for the mile (on turf) when winning the Gr.1 Atto Mile at Woodbine, Toronto. He won 9 of his 13 lifetime starts, was second twice, and was voted the Eclipse Champion Turf Male Horse in the USA in 2005. His wins (all over 6 1/2f - 8 1/2f) included three Gr.1's (all on turf): the Atto Mile, the Citation Hcp and the Frank E Kilroe Mile Hcp: he was also second in the Gr.1 Breeders' Cup Mile. Retired to Stonewall Farm in Kentucky in 2006, LEROIDESANIMAUX was a leading sire in the USA in 2011 and has to date sired the winners of over 500 races and more than $23 million, including World Champion ANIMAL KINGDOM (Kentucky Derby and Dubai World Cup), whose own first crop are yearlings of 2016. Other winners by LEROIDESANIMAUX include Gr.1 winner UNA CABEZA and no less than 8 individual Stakes winners in 2015, including the 2yo's BOOTLEGGERS WIFE, EXPECTED RULER and FRANCESCO BLUE, as well as 2016 Stakes winners MOM'Z LAUGH and GONE AWAY. LEROIDESANIMAUX stood at Lanwades for the 2014 and 2015 seasons, but had only covered a handful of mares in 2016 before sustaining the injury which eventually claimed his life. \"We are extremely saddened at the tragic loss of LEROI\" said Kirsten Rausing of Lanwades Stud. \"He was still in the prime of life and would no doubt have proved an exceptional asset to the European Thoroughbred industry. We are absolutely delighted with the yearlings and foals he has produced during his time at Lanwades\".\n\n26th May 2016\n\nA SECOND CONSECUTIVE STAKES WIN FOR SON OF ARCHIPENKO\n\nLanwades-bred three-year-old TIME WARP won his second consecutive Listed race when making all to win the Listed Prix de Pontarme at Saint-Cloud over a mile. This was TIME WARPâs seasonal debut having won four races as a two-year-old which culminated in him winning the Listed Criterium de lâOuest at Craon in September last year. It was a first winner on turf this season for his trainer, Sir Mark Prescott, who said âHe won very well, made all and won by three lengths, he has done everything really. He has won on the firm, he has won on fibresand, he has won good to firm and now he has won on a bog.â Bred by Lanwades, TIME WARP, is by resident stallion ARCHIPENKO and is a first foal out of winning STORMY ATLANTIC mare HERE TO ETERNITY. He was consigned by Staffordstown when purchased by Jeremy Brummitt at the Tattersalls Ireland September Yearling Sale and he has a full brother, now two-year-old named GLORIOUS FOREVER, in training with Ed Walker which was also consigned by Staffordstown when sold at Tattersalls October Yearling Sales Book 2 for 110,000 gns.\n\n23rd May 2016\n\nLANWADES-BRED ALGOMETER WINS LISTED RACE\n\nThird generation Lanwades-bred ALGOMETER continued his successful campaign when putting in a determined run to win the Listed Cocked Hat Stakes at Goodwood. With only four runners in the race of which none of them particularly wanting to make the running. The favourite, PRIZE MONEY, set a modest early pace, but on the turn for home in the eleven furlong event, he quickened up the pace. ALGOMETER took the lead with half furlong to run and really dug deep to win by a half a length. ALGOMETER landed his maiden at Newbury at two and re-appeared in the Gr.3 Classic Trial at Sandown finishing second to MIDTERM. He is a Lanwades homebred by ARCHIPENKO out of Horse of the Year ALBANOVA (a winner of three Group 1âs). He is a half-brother to triple Listed winner ALL AT SEA, triple Listed-placed winner ALBAMARA and Stakes winner ALWILDA. His dam is a full-sister to dual Gr.1 Champion Stakes winner ALBORADA.\n\n16th May 2016\n\nWAKE FOREST LANDS FIRST GRADE 1 FOR SIR PERCY\n\nLanwades sire SIR PERCY had his first Grade one winner on Saturday night when his son WAKE FOREST won the Gr.1 Man OâWar Stakes at Belmont Park. Bred by Gestut Fahrhof WAKE FOREST started his racing career off by winning twice at two including taking the valuable â¬200,000 BBAG Sales Race at Baden-Baden and finished unbeaten at two. He then went onto win the Gr.3 Preis der Deutschen Einheit at Hoppegarten and also the Gr.3 Grosser Preis von Lotto Hamburg at Hamburg. In between these races he had finished 3rd in the Gr.1 Premio Presidente della Repubblica. While still in the yard of Andreas Wohler and running in the colours of Klaus Allofs and his breeder, he went to the US last August and finished 6th in the Arlington Million. He was then sold in October 2015 at the Arqana Arc Sale to Bradley Thoroughbreds for â¬140,000. He reappeared this year on 2nd April finishing a head second in the Gr.2 Pan American Stakes at Gulfstream for his new connections, owners Michael Dubb, Sheep Pond Partners and Bethlehem Stables and trainer Chad Brown before landing his first Grade one victory in impressive style. SIR PERCY, an unbeaten Champion 2yo and Derby winner himself, retired to Lanwades in 2008 and has since sire 34 individual Stakes performers including Gr.2 winners LADY TIANA and SIR ANDREW as well as Gr.3 winners ALLA SPERANZA, LADY PIMPERNEL and SIR JOHN HAWKWOOD who incidentally finished 2nd in a Gr.3 in Australia on Saturday as well.

Both are colts, one a three-parts brother to ARCHIPENKOâs best runner to date out of Stakes winner KISWAHILI, a SELKIRK half-sister to MADAME CHIANG's dam ROBE CHINOISE, the other a first colt in four foals out of four-time winner MONDA, a granddaughter of KISWAHILI and ROBE CHINOISEâs MACHIAVELLIAN half-sister KIMONO.\n\nA third ARCHIPENKO April arrival is a bay colt out of Gr.3 Blue Wind Stakes winner AKDARENA, herself by Lanwades sire HERNANDO.\n\nMother and daughter GRAIN ONLY and GRANULE bore foals within days of each other from the last crop by Lanwades recently-deceased resident AUSSIE RULES. GRAIN ONLYâs grey filly is a half-sister to four winners, most notably CARAVAN ROLLS ON, a good handicapper here before going on to Gr.3 success in Australia. She is also an own sister to the mareâs 210,000 guineas 2014 yearling colt, sold to Shadwell Estates at Tattersalls Oct Book 2 Sales. GRANULE, a HERNANDO full-sister to CARAVAN ROLLS ON, has a grey colt, her second foal after the LEROIDESANIMAUX first foal which brought 40,000 guineas at last year's Tattersalls December Foal Sale.\n\nMARIA DI SCOZIA also has a grey AUSSIE RULES colt, and hers is half-brother to three winners, the mare's first three foals, including dual 2016 three-year-old winner MARIEE.\n\nThree more foals have arrived by Lanwades first-crop horse SEA THE MOON, all colts. In alphabetical and chronological order they are a chesnut half-brother to dual Gr.3 winner CUBANITA out of the HERNANDO mare CARIBANA; a bay fourth foal out of dual Group-placed (and Irish 1000 Guineas fourth) CLAIOMH SOLAIS, whose three-year-old first foal CLEAR CUT won a seven furlong Cork maiden for Jim Bolger in late March; and a bay who is not only his dam's 15th foal but also a sibling to no less than 10 winners, four of them at Group or Listed level, out of the NASHWAN mare from PETOSKI's family, SUMMER NIGHT.\n\nSUMMER NIGHTâs colt also has a closely-related filly friend amongst the April arrivals too in the form of the bay filly first foal by SEA THE MOONâs sire SEA THE STARS, out of the multiple French Listed placed mare SO IN LOVE, a SMART STRIKE granddaughter (out of French Listed winner SOFT MORNING), of SUMMER NIGHT.\n\nSuperbly-bred ALBAMARA, a daughter of GALILEO and German Horse of the Year and triple Gr.1 winner ALBANOVA, was a useful runner in her own right, winning an Epsom maiden at two and notching three placings in Listed contests at three. She has produced a bay colt second foal by leading US sire SPEIGHTSTOWN, a full-brother to her 2015 - also colt - produce.\n\nHer close relative ALABELLE - also by GALILEO and half-sister to Derby runner-up DRAGON DANCER out of ALBANOVA's HERNANDO half-sister ALAKANANDA - has an IFFRAAJ colt fourth foal; her INVINCIBLE SPIRIT filly first foal A L'ANGLAISE is a three-year-old in training in France with Andre Fabre.\n\nMeanwhile a third member of the ALRUCCABA tribe, ALTITUDE, a GREEN DESERT half-sister to ALBANOVA and ALAKANANDA, has a grey filly by LEROIDESANIMAUX and will stay at home to visit SEA THE MOON.\n\nStaying put also, both to visit ARCHIPENKO, are MARIE DU PLESSIS, a three-parts sister by INVINCIBLE SPIRIT to LADY JANE DIGBY and GATEMAN, whose SIR PERCY filly is her first surviving foal, and HEAT OF THE NIGHT, who has a bay colt by German-based MAXIOS.\n\nLEADERENE, a six-time winning SELKIRK half-sister to German Champion and Gr.1 Prix de l'Opera winner LADY MARIAN, has a first foal bay colt by LEROIDESANIMAUX while boarding mare SWINGLAND has a bay colt third foal by OASIS DREAM.\n\nFinally, BITE OF THE CHERRY, a recent addition to the Lanwades broodmare band, has a second foal colt by DUTCH ART. A daughter of DALAKHANI rated 105 by Timeform after winning a maiden at three and placing in two Listed races, she is half-sister, out of Moyglare Stud Stakes winner BIANCA NERA, to the dams of Gr.3 winners ROBIN HOODS BAY and TURNING TOP. More importantly, she is also half-sister to the dam of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner and currently arguably the world's best middle distance horse, POSTPONED.\n\n6th April 2016\n\nA WELL DESERVED LISTED WIN FOR LANWADES BRED ALTESSE\n\nLanwades-bred ALTESSE got up close home for a well-deserved win in the feature race at Leopardstown yesterday, the Listed Noblesse Stakes. The remarkably consistent ALTESSE has never been out of the first three in all her eight starts which includes being placed in five Listed races and a close second in the Gr.3 Give Thanks Stakes at Cork. Her trainer, Jim Bolger, reported âI wouldnât risk her on firm ground, but she goes well on all other types of ground. Sheâs very consistent. She could go for the Vintage Crop Stakes over a mile and six at Navan (15th May). The trip doesnât really matter that much as long a she gets a good pace.â ALTESSE is fourth generation Lanwades-bred of which they are now all Stakes winners. She is half-sister to Gr.3 Kilternan Stakes winner ALLA SPERANZA (by SIR PERCY) and ALMIRANTA who is the dam of Gr.3 two-year-old winner ALEA IACTA. They are out of the Listed winner ALVARITA (by SELKIRK) who is the daughter of dual Group 1 winner ALBORADA.\n\n4th April 2016\n\nREMAINING MARCH ARRIVALS\n\nTwo fillies and a colt by much-missed AUSSIE RULES are among the latter arrivals for March. First of the fillies is a bay daughter of OBLIGE from the family of RAINBOW QUEST, WARNING and COMMANDER IN CHIEF. She is half-sister to two winners including the progressive ARCHIPENKO gelding BARYE, a winner of five races, including this year, and now with an official handicap mark of 103. The other filly is a grey half-sister to five winners out of the stakes winning WITH APPROVAL mare FROSTY WELCOME, whose granddam is half-sister to ALLEZ FRANCE.\n\nThe AUSSIE RULES colt is one of two arrivals, both colts, out of boarding mares owned by Mr John Pearce. Out of MISS KATMANDU, a RAINBOW QUEST half-sister to dual Group winners ST EXPEDIT and ASIAN HEIGHTS, he is half-brother to two winners and is the mare's third consecutive AUSSIE RULES colt. Mr Pearce's other arrival is a chesnut colt by Derby winner and first crop sire AUSTRALIA and the second foal out of stakes winner MISS CAP ESTEL, a daughter of HERNANDO whose first foal is a filly by OASIS DREAM and who now visits FRANKEL.\n\nAnother HERNANDO mare to produce late in March is ALBORADA's daughter ALMAMIA, who has a filly by ARCHIPENKO. ALMAMIAâs Marcus Tregoning-trained SIR PERCY daughter ALAMODE looks a smart prospect amongst three-year-old fillies this year after winning a Goodwood maiden and running a Group 3 second in the Oh So Sharp Stakes from just four runs last year. In addition to ALAMODE, ALMAMIA has the two-year-old NEW APPROACH colt ALTERNATE ROUTE (with Sir Mark Prescott) and a SEA THE STARS yearling filly to come.\n\nNEIGE D'ANTAN, a three-time winning daughter of AUSSIE RULES and NINOTCHKA tracing to SPECIAL, has a grey filly second foal by SEA THE STARS' three-parts brother BORN TO SEA. Her first foal, NOSTALGIE, is a two-year-old ARCHIPENKO filly in training in Newmarket with Rae Guest.\n\nFinally, the British Bloodstock Agency-owned boarder ARAQELLA has a bay filly by IFFRAAJ. It is the second filly in as many foals for ARAQELLA, a dual-winning OASIS DREAM full-sister to Prix du Moulin winner AQLAAM out of a half-sister to the great PERSIAN PUNCH.\n\nLEROIDESANIMAUX FOALS\n\nNearly half of the foals who arrived in the closing fortnight of March are by Lanwades sire LEROIDESANIMAUX, and four of the six are fillies.\n\nHalf-sisters SOUVENANCE and SOURIRE are both amongst the half-dozen, the former with a filly, the latter with a colt. SOUVENANCEâs filly is half-sister to the dam's first-foal winner NICE ROSE and to SYLVETTE, the SELKIRK filly who remains in training this year with Roger Varian. SOURIREâs colt is also half-brother to a winner, and to now three-year-old filly SOUTHERN SEAS, by ARCHIPENKO.\n\nHERE TO ETERNITY's filly is half-sister to her dam's 2015 two-year-old stakes winning ARCHIPENKO first foal TIME WARP (winner of four races), and to that colt's 110,000 guineas yearling full-brother now a two-year-old in training with Ed Walker. HERE TO ETERNITY, a daughter of STORMY ATLANTIC tracing to SPECIAL, returns, not surprisingly, to ARCHIPENKO, thus again producing a pedigree of three times inbreeding to SPECIAL.\n\nThe other three mares, who all produced foals within a five day period, were each producing her first foal. Two of the mares are by SELKIRK - SELENOGRAPHY, an unraced daughter of Argentinian Group 1 winner SLEW THE MOON from the family of SHAREEF DANCER, MIZZEN MAST and ZENYATTA; and CATADUPA, a full-sister to dual Group 3 winner CUBANITA from the family of classic winners KAHYASI and MILAN. Both these two foals are fillies. The third, APPARATCHIKA, is a two-time winning daughter of ARCHIPENKO from the family of SELKIRK's Italian champion son ALTIERI, who produced a colt. All three stay at Lanwades to visit SEA THE MOON.\n\n17th March 2016\n\nMARCH ARRIVALS\n\nMother and daughter NINOTCHKA and NADESZHDA each have 2016 foals by LEROIDESANIMAUX, the former a bay colt, her NASHWAN daughter a chesnut filly. NINOTCHKA's son, her 11th foal, is half-brother to five winners, best of whom are the ill-fated Fred Darling Stakes place getter NATALIYA and NADESZHDA. The latter, a four-time winner also Grade 2 runner-up at Santa Anita, has bred four winners to date and has the ARCHIPENKO three-year-old ARCHERS UP to run for her this year, plus a yearling colt by BORN TO SEA. She returns to LEROIDESANIMAUX while her dam, probably the last producing daughter of NIJINSKYâs and now 23, heads for a well-earned retirement.\n\nALRUCCABA's granddaughters ALBA STELLA and ALGARADE have both foaled to Lanwades sires. The latter, a three-time winning half-sister to ARCHIPENKO's South African Group 2 winner KINGSTON MINES, has produced two winners already with her first two foals, including ALINSTANTE, a triple winner as a two-year-old last year for Sir Mark Prescott. She has a bay colt fourth foal who is her third consecutive produce by ARCHIPENKO, he and ALINSTANTE sandwiching a filly which is now a yearling. ALGARADE will visit SEA THE MOON, sire of the grey filly who is the ninth surviving foal out of ALBA STELLA. The mare's first seven named foals are all winners, all of them bar last year's juvenile maiden winner ALBE BACK (by ARCHIPENKO) multiple winners, while the eighth, ALLEGIANCE, is a two-year-old full-sister to ALBE BACK with Sir Mark Prescott.\n\nAlso foaling to SEA THE MOON was SOFT MORNING, whose bay colt is her sixth foal (and second colt) in seven years. The first two are stakes-placed winners SAVANNA LA MAR and SO IN LOVE and to run for her this year she has the three-year-old EXCEED AND EXCEL colt IN THE CITY, Timeform 89p rated after placing in Newmarket maiden on his only juvenile appearance. SOFT MORNING visits LEROIDESANIMAUX.\n\nThe John Pearce-bred and now Lanwades-owned MIGNONNE, a WITH APPROVAL half-sister to dual Group winners ASIAN HEIGHTS and ST EXPEDIT, has an AUSSIE RULES grey colt first foal, while Mr Pearce's stakes winning mare MISS CORNICHE has an OASIS DREAM half-sister to four winners including Ebor Handicap winner MOYENNE CORNICHE.\n\nIN THE PINK also has a grey colt, hers by DUBAWIâs (Italian Derby-winning and Lockinge Stakes second) son WORTHADD. IN THE PINK is a granddaughter of 1000 Guineas winner NOCTURNAL SPREE from the family of another classic winner in St Leger hero and European Champion MOONAX.\n\nThe British Bloodstock Agency-owned SALINIA, another with dual classic connections as a half-sister to Prix du Jockey Club winner and young sire RELIABLE MAN and a granddaughter of Oaks and Irish Oaks winner FAIR SALINIA, has a bay colt by LAWMAN, her fourth colt in as many foals.\n\n16th March 2016\n\nSTUNNING FOAL BY FIRST CROP SIRE SEA THE MOON\n\nBred by Lanwades Stud, this colt foal is by German Horse of the Year SEA THE MOON, out of another such, Triple Gr.1 winner ALBANOVA. He is three-parts brother to three-time Listed winner ALL AT SEA (by Sea The Stars) and also half-brother to five other winners including Listed winner ALWILDA and Listed-placed ALBAMARA. His dam is own sister to dual Champion Stakes winner ALBORADA.\n\n14th March 2016\n\nGREAT SATURDAY FOR SIR PERCY\n\nIrish-bred SIR JOHN HAWKWOOD by SIR PERCY started a very good Saturday for his sire when winning the Gr.3 Sky High Stakes at Rosehill in Australia. The now seven-year-old was settled towards the rear of the field and he then came with a late challenge in the closing stages to get up and win by a short head. SIR JOHN HAWKWOOD was bred by Ballymacoll Stud and was originally trained by Sir Michael Stoute for whom he won four races at four different racetracks (Windsor, Newmarket, Chester and York). He has now won over Â£205,000 in prize money and connections have revealed he will now be aimed at the Gr.1 Sydney Cup next month.\n\nOver in America at Tampa Bay Downs, ENJOY YOURSELF, a three-year-old daughter of SIR PERCY, narrowly missed out on making it a Gr.3 double when finishing second by half a length in the Gr.3 Florida Oaks. Bred by Mrs Janet Sexton, ENJOY YOURSELF, won her maiden on debut as a two-year-old at Gowran Park when trained by John Oxx. SIR PERCY is a consistent producer of Stakes horses and has now sired 32 Stakes performers.\n\n3rd March 2016\n\nALRUCCABA ARRIVALS\n\nTwo mother and daughter tag teams have featured amongst six recent arrivals to mares from Lanwades fabled ALRUCCABA family.\n\nFirst of the ALRUCCABA arrivals was the LEROIDESANIMAUX colt born to Listed winner ALMA MATER.
