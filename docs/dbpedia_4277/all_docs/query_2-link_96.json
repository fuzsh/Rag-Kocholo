        "text": "In honour of Harchibald, the famously enigmatic hurdler who made his chasing debut this week, Claims Five turns its attention to Britain's most frustrating racehorses – the ones with bundles of ability but who refused to use it, having worked out that they don't have to. As a punter, these are the ones that turn your hair white. If you've backed a horse like that a few times, you daren't stop for fear that next time will be the day it wins at big odds. But the big day, it seems, will never come for as long as you're backing it.\n\nAs it happens, I don't believe Harchibald belongs in this company, despite his reputation. The finish to the 2005 Champion Hurdle, which he should have won but didn't, was just about the most amazing I've ever seen but I tend to blame the jockey rather than the horse. Harchibald is clearly a tricky ride but he showed battling qualities in last year's Christmas Hurdle and that is enough to disqualify him as an out-and-out dodgepot.\n\nYou wouldn't catch the horses on this list scraping home in a close finish. This collection of rogues would often cruise through the middle part of a race, looking like champions, but had terrible difficulty at either end of it. Sometimes they'd throw away their chance at the start, sometimes they'd wait for the approach to the finish before making sure something else was in front. Dangerously, most of them would throw in the odd win, just to keep people guessing.\n\nThat doesn't apply in the case of my No1 headcase. Quick enough to beat many a decent racehorse, he nevertheless went through an entire career without winning. It made the news when his tally of 74 defeats was eventually surpassed by Quixall Crossett, but Quixall Crossett would have won if he could – he was just slow, and where's the dignity in that?\n\nHorses considered for this list who didn't quite make it include Arcadian Heights, who tried to bite his rivals as they went past and had to be fitted with a muzzle for the 1992 Goodwood Cup. Apologies also to fans of Pukka Major, Bellator, Challenger Du Luc and Dom Samourai, who didn't quite make the cut. I'm not old enough to remember Knockroe, whose antics are described at length in David Ashforth's excellent Hitting The Turf and I dare say there are other shocking omissions, which you can remind me of in the comment space below.\n\n5 Maylane\n\nAt his peak, Maylane was barely short of top class. When he won the Group Three September Stakes at Epsom in 1997, he beat Dushyantor, who'd been second in the Coronation Cup over the same course and distance three months before. His win was all the more creditable for a slow start, when he gave away five lengths – something that was already a habit. On a bad day, Maylane would swerve so sharply left as he came out of the stalls that Michael Roberts would be unseated, a trick he pulled off twice that year. From 18 starts after his Epsom success, Maylane won two more races, largely thanks to a series of absurdly slow starts. Still, at least he would leave the stalls eventually. Tried in two hurdles races in 2002, he refused to budge when the tape rose.\n\n4 Harwell Lad\n\nEvery dog has his day, so the saying goes, and Harwell Lad's came in the Whitbread Gold Cup of 1997, when he led home Flyer's Nap, a one-two for Dorset trainer Robert Alner. The horse had a well-established reputation for moodiness, but his amateur rider, Rupert Nutall, explained that hunting had cheered him up. \"When he came to stay with me, he wouldn't go on the gallops and he'd try to buck people off,\" Nuttall said in the winner's enclosure at Sandown. \"We took him hunting and played around with him, and it gave him something else to think about. And one day he seemed to turn around and decide that life wasn't a bitch, after all. But I promise you, if it wasn't for hunting, he'd be in a meat can by now.\"\n\nUncharitable punters at Chepstow the previous year may have felt that Harwell Lad was not worth saving when he gave up in mid-race. He was sent off at 4-6, his main rival had fallen and he had only a 10-1 shot to beat but, from the 10th fence, he refused to respond to Nuttall and trailed home a distance behind. It was the last time he was sent off favourite and he was a 14-1 shot for the Whitbread.\n\nBy the following season, hunting therapy no longer seemed to be working. Harwell Lad dropped himself out in four runs out of five and was retired. \"The applause when he came back was all for his rider,\" said the Racing Post after his final start. But the ability was still there – on his only 'going' day of that final season, Harwell Lad was second in Ascot's Betterware Cup behind Alner's Cool Dawn, who won the Gold Cup three months later.\n\n3 Green Green Desert\n\nOn his debut in a backend maiden at Newmarket in 1993, Green Green Desert was such an impressive winner that my learned colleague Will Hayler was moved to back him ante-post for the 2,000 Guineas. Unhappily for Will, something must have upset the horse that day because, for the rest of his career as a Flat racer, Green Green Desert seemed extremely reluctant to repeat the experience of passing the post in front, despite the efforts of his trainer, one M Stoute. The dream survived as far as the Craven Stakes, in which he started 11-4 favourite but trailed home 20 lengths behind King's Theatre.\n\nAfter that, Green Green Desert started amassing an impressive run of placed efforts but it took a surprisingly long time before his resolution was called into question. Not until his 14th start did the ominous words \"not run on\" appear in his in-running comments. The nadir came in the ladies' race at Ascot on King George day, which Green Green Desert would have won with just an ounce of willingness. Instead, he defied the urgings of Maxine Cowdrey in the saddle, stuck his nose in the air and got run out of it close home. The Racing Post said he \"would lay down\" to avoid winning. Four months later, he was sent hurdling. His first season was a success but it was clear that he remained the same horse when he downed tools at Bangor the following year. The 5-4 favourite, he soon had a big lead but basically gave up under Jamie Osborne when another horse came alongside. He finally found himself as a chaser, wining seven times – but after his early run of success, he would still find a way to get beat if asked to battle. Over the course of his career, Green Green Desert was beaten at odds of 8-11, 5-4, 11-8, 2-1, 2-1, 9-4, 5-2, 5-2, 5-2, 11-4, 11-4 and 11-4. Few horses have let punters down so often.\n\n2 Vodkatini\n\nThe form was there for all to see. On his hurdling debut, Vodkatini gave the first clue that he might not be the most straightforward character when, leading on the approach to the second-last, he ran out. In December 1985, he got off the mark over fences despite whipping round at the start and losing many lengths at Huntingdon, a trick he repeated two years later at Kempton, where he gave up 20 lengths at the start but still managed to hit the front by the third-last.\n\nSuch antics were all very jolly for as long as he kept winning, but Vodkatini left a sour taste in the mouths of many when refusing to race in the 1988 Tingle Creek. There was no refund for those who had made him the 2-1 favourite and had to watch Desert Orchid score a bloodless victory. Vodkatini rubbed it in by winning next time out and he was a fine third in that season's King George, ahead of Cavvies Clown and Charter Party.\n\nOne can easily see why punters forgave him enough to make him favourite for the two-mile handicap chase on Grand National day at the end of that season. Suckers. The tape went up but Vodkatini stayed put. That season, betting shops saw the evolution of the Vodkatini slam. Taking advantage of the fact that bookies would often accept bets on jump races up to the first fence, punters would wait to see if Josh Gifford's moody beast had started before slapping their money and betting slip on the counter. They needn't have bothered. After his King George third, Vodkatini never won another race, despite 17 attempts.\n\nIn 2005, Vodkatini returned to the track in the guise of a two-year-old with Peter Makin. Whoever shelled out 30,000 guineas for this one could have named it anything at all, but instead chose to reuse the name of one of the sport's most famous rogues. They were punished for their hubris – Vodkatini II failed to place in 12 starts.\n\n1 Amrullah\n\nBy a Guineas winner, High Top, out of a mare by a Derby winner, Charlottown, Amrullah was bred in the purple but left his backers in the red. He failed to win in a 10-year career but, oh, the frustration for his growing band of followers, who knew he had talent – they saw him finish just four lengths behind Pearlyman, for example, when the pair were fourth and fifth at Ascot in 1986. Pearlyman won the Champion Chase for the next two years but Amrullah was still running in novice chases up to his retirement six years later, by which time he had raced 74 times without success and had a fan club – something Pearlyman may never have achieved.\n\n\"He was a crafty character, but I feel a bit sick I couldn't get him to win,\" said his trainer, Hampshire-based John Bridger. It wasn't quite a case of refusing to go past. Often, Amrullah would set off in front and once, in a race at Newbury, was clear at halfway before, inevitably, being reeled in. \"Led 12th until approaching last, not run on,\" says a telling comment on another occasion, in a race won, appropriately, by a horse called Going Gets Tough.\n\nStill, Amrullah racked up £26,000 in place prize money and was so popular that his retirement was mentioned on News At Ten. Typically, Timeform wouldn't lighten up enough to give him a valedictory essay, seeing him off with a cursory mumble of \"thoroughly irresolute\" and a double squiggle, used to denote \"an arrant rogue or thorough jade\".\n\nIn hindsight, the most significant outing in Amrullah's career may have been at Kempton on Boxing Day 1985. Later that afternoon, Wayward Lad would win his third King George, Aonoch would beat Ra Nova in the Christmas Hurdle and Charter Party would win something called the Falklands Handicap Chase. But the opener was the main event, when Amrullah's opponents included … Vodkatini. Kasparov had beaten Karpov the previous month and now here was another epic clash between two great thinkers. Vodkatini and Amrullah should have been helped by the fact that two of their three rivals failed to get round but it goes without saying that the other one, Bolands Cross, won. Naturally, Amrullah was third."
