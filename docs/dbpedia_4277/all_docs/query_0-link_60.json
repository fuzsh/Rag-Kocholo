Klammer has finished behind King Torus and Strong Suit in previous races and Pleasure Beach got beat by Pirateer who has since won again.\n\nI’m excited about Frankel more than I was about Canford Cliffs and Celtic Swing and I expect him to improve at three.\n\nGhost of Rob V\n\nParticipant\n\nTotal Posts 1389\n\nAnd now imagine Thommo commentating like that.\n\nGhost of Rob V\n\nParticipant\n\nTotal Posts 1389\n\nOne ride I’ll never forget was Ridley Lamb’s on a horse called Run Over. Rounding the home turn, the horse was completely tailed off with about two flights to go. He then appeared out of nowhere to jump the last in the lead and ran away from the opposition like a horse possessed. How on earth Ridley conjured up such an amazing ride from a horse who looked ready to be pulled up, I’ll never know!\n\nGhost of Rob V\n\nParticipant\n\nTotal Posts 1389\n\nhttp://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080414075454/marvelmovies/images/thumb/9/99/Peter_Parker.jpg/284px-Peter_Parker.jpg\n\nAidan O’ Brien\n\nhttp://images.sportinglife.com/10/07/330/Aidan-O-Brien-July-2010_2479045.jpg\n\nPeter Parker\n\nGhost of Rob V\n\nParticipant\n\nTotal Posts 1389\n\nThe 2,000 Guineas winner of 1971 would have laughed his head off at all subsequent winners of the race and would probably have smirked (albiet respectfully ) at El Gran Senor and Dancing Brave as he passed by them too.\n\nBack in 1986, I once read about comparisons being made with Brigadier Gerard and Dancing Brave. It was mentioned that it took BG three strides to hit top gear and DB 45 yards. If you work out how many strides a horse can fit into 45 yards, then there wouldn’t be much between those two titans. I pretty much suspect that Dancing Brave would’ve given Brigadier Gerard a helluva scare if such a clash ever happened\n\nGhost of Rob V\n\nParticipant\n\nTotal Posts 1389\n\nSure Blade\n\n, the 5th horse in Dancing Brave’s 2000 Guineas, won the St James Palace Stakes and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in the same year.\n\nGhost of Rob V\n\nParticipant\n\nTotal Posts 1389\n\nGT – haven’t a lot of the ‘true greats’ been beaten at one time or another by a horse of lesser ability. So, I’d contend, it’s perfectly possible for true greats to be beaten by horses who are their inferiors without detracting from their ‘truly great’ status in any way.\n\nDancing Brave by Shahrastani\n\nNijinsky by Lorenzaccio\n\nMill Reef by My Swallow\n\nThe Brigadier by Roberto\n\nSea The Stars by Driving Snow\n\nAnd not forgetting –\n\nSea Bird II by Grey Dawn\n\nGhost of Rob V\n\nParticipant\n\nTotal Posts 1389\n\nEvery racing fan will know that Harbinger always had the kryptonite in his hooves to become a champion one day and eventually proved that when won the King George. His injury really is a massive blow to racing but I do agree that he should go to stud.\n\nI put Harbinger’s King George victory in the top 5 of my all-time favourite races on the Flat. It was a superlative performance and the best KG win I’ve ever seen without a shadow of a doubt.\n\nGhost of Rob V\n\nParticipant\n\nTotal Posts 1389\n\nhttp://images.sportinglife.com/08/10/330/Derek-Thompson_1332479.jpg\n\nCalibos from Clash Of The Titans\n\nhttp://www.goozlepipe.com/wp-content/2008/03/clash_titans.jpg\n\nThommo\n\nGhost of Rob V\n\nParticipant\n\nTotal Posts 1389\n\nI fancied Zaidan to win the Coventry Stakes before he was taken out of it.\n\nZaidan is the best 2YO I’ve seen this season.\n\nGhost of Rob V\n\nParticipant\n\nTotal Posts 1389\n\nIs Canford Cliffs better than Sea The Stars? I actually think it’s a very close call. CC has already achieved more at a mile than what STS did.\n\nHave to admit, Canford Cliffs excites me more than Sea The Stars. There’s something about CC’s style of running that reminds me of Dancing Brave … waiting for that tremendous turn of foot to ignite as the 2 furlong marker appears. And the fact that Richard Hughes can afford to give 4 or 5 lengths away in CC’s races (last two) just shows what kind of a beast he’s sitting on.\n\nGoldikova\n\nwill\n\nlose her crown to Canford Cliffs\n\nGhost of Rob V\n\nParticipant\n\nTotal Posts 1389\n\nWorkforce all the way. End of.\n\nGhost of Rob V\n\nParticipant\n\nTotal Posts 1389\n\nDone a Patent bet yesterday which consisted of Regal Parade, Forest Crown and Temple Meads.\n\nAs always, the one who I expected to win the most ended up being the bugger that let me down. Sods law!\n\nGhost of Rob V\n\nParticipant\n\nTotal Posts 1389\n\nEquiano will be retired after his Nunthorpe run unless they are tempted with Longchamp.\n\nShame to see him retire since he seems to be at his best now.\n\nViewing 17 posts - 1,276 through 1,292 (of 1,362 total)"
