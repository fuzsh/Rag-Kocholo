        "text": "There are plenty of serious and analytical things to love about horse racing, but horse racing also has facets that are just plain fun. My favourite goofy facet of horse racing is the art of the horse name.\n\nThe first time I ever went to the track I had no idea how to read a racing form, so I bet on the horses with the funniest names. I left Arlington Park with more money in my pocket than I arrived with that day, because a horse named He’s Hot Sauce (Cartwright — Zen’s Hot Sauce, by Zen) won a state-bred N2X at 7.5/1. It turns out, his female line just screams silly names: his second dam was the Sauce Boat mare Stake Sauce. Alas, the puntastically and ambitiously named Stake Sauce did not win any stakes races, though He’s Hot Sauce did win two.\n\nThough I never (okay…almost never) bet solely based on goofy names anymore, I still thoroughly enjoy them, and tweet about them quite frequently. This is a slightly more permanent landing for the best of the best: an ongoing repository of horse names that strike my fancy.\n\nMy very favourite horse names are the ones that make a clever play based on both sides of the pedigree. They typically require no other explanation than those root names, and then taking a split second to let it sink in.\n\nAbscond (Blame – Solitary Life)\n\nAbyssinian (Cairo Prince – Shesakitty)\n\nAdd Some Alcohol (Purim – Shirley Temper)\n\nAdopt Me (Street Cry – Precious Kitten)\n\nAlcohol Free (No Nay Never – Plying)\n\nAntifreeze (It’s Freezing – I’m Really Smokin)\n\nAwol Adam (Military – Runaway Emily A)\n\nBerate (Blame – Orate)\n\nBurrito (Tabasco Cat – Dinners On Me)\n\nC. Zee (Elusive Bluff – Diamondaire)\n\nCapitalism At Risk (Bull Market – Stock Price)\n\nCharismatic Pulpit (Pulpit – Karis Macaw, by Charismatic)\n\nChide (Blame – Yell)\n\nConfide (Phone Trick – Bag of Tricks)\n\nCorrupt (Belong to Me – Taxable Deduction)\n\nCutting Humor (First Samurai – Pun)\n\nDon’task Don’ttell (To Honor and Serve – Askbut I Won’ttell)\n\nEdging (Straight Line – Lawn)\n\nEmbezzlement (Cat Thief – The Administrator)\n\nFlatware (Flatter – Culinary)\n\nFour Left Feet (Trippi – Romance Dance)\n\nFluffy Socks (Slumber – Breakfast Time)\n\nGet Hammered (Stay Thirsty – Three Cherries, by Hennessy)\n\nHappy Drunk (Pleasant Tap – Double Schott)\n\nHarassment Case (Badger Land – Cherry Tart)\n\nHello America (Point of Entry – I O Ireland)\n\nHideous (Distorted Humor – Flatter Me)\n\nHurricane Bernie (Sea of Secrets – Deceptive)\n\nTo make it even better, both Hurricane Bernie and Hurricane Bertie were Bernie Flint trainees.\n\nInfinite Zest (Lemon Drop Kid – Allshewrote)\n\nIstanly (Istan – Now)\n\nIts Cold in Dehere (Ice Box – Suee’s Hero, by Dehere)\n\nLawyer Talk (Alleged – Jibber Jabber)\n\nLife in Shambles (Broken Vow – Life)\n\nLion N Cheatin (Lion Hearted – Marion’s Dover)\n\nLion N Cheatin was born in 2006. 2006-2007 was the heyday of the investigation into runner Marion Jones’s use of performance enhancers.\n\nMisandry Mermaid (Macho Uno – Freedom Come)\n\nNight Owl (Animal Kingdom – No Curfew)\n\nNile High Club (Pioneerof the Nile – Skymiler)\n\nNo Fighting (War Front – Sweet Science)\n\nNumbers Never Lie (Misremembered – Quarterly Report)\n\nOrb of the Boro (Orb – I Love America)\n\nOverdrawn (Charitable Man – Bank Teller)\n\nPardon the Pun (Flatter – Hennesey Smash)\n\nPraise the Kitten (Kitten’s Joy – Great Doxology)\n\nPrince of Mayhem (Violence – Paisley Park)\n\nPurr Sea (Midshipman – Kitty’s Castle)\n\nShe’s All Skeet (Trappe Shot – She’s All Scat)\n\nShe’s Sterling (Silver Deputy – Miss Turlington)\n\nShezastonecoldingo (Lonhro – Shesastonecoldfox)\n\nSecede (War Front – Leave)\n\nShimmy Shack (Shackleford – Atlanta Highway)\n\nThe best of several good names from that mare: Atlanta Highway has also produced Jukebox Money (English Channel) and Glitteronthehiway (Tale of the Cat). Sense a theme?\n\nSkywarn (Congrats – Rising Tornado)\n\nSobersick N Sorry (Trappe Shot – Shocking Behavior)\n\nSocial Network (Offlee Wild – Website)\n\nSomelikeithotbrown (Big Brown – Marilyn Monroan)\n\nSonnet Boom (Shakespeare – Cry of the Wild)\n\nSpy a Star (Speightster – Given Star)\n\nStalled (Jump Start – Push My Luck)\n\nStealin’ Gasoline (Siphon – Rare Flight)\n\nStorm Temple Pilot (Temple City – Launchastorm)\n\nTeardownthatwall (Free House – Soviet Problem)\n\nThe Canary Lived (Cool Coal Man – Smart Lady Doc)\n\nEven if a name does not riff on both parents, sometimes it riffs on one ancestor so well that it stands out.\n\nAda Lovelace (Algorithms – Indian Miss)\n\nThank goodness a filly from Algorithms’s first crop was named after the first computer programmer.\n\nAfleet Accompli (Afleet Alex – Competition)\n\nA win may not necessarily be a fait accompli, but a giggle whenever this gelding shows up on the worktab or the overnight is.\n\nArlingtons Revenge (The Apache – Cleome)\n\nNo one will forget sire The Apache’s DQ in the 2013 Arlington Million anytime soon. Mike de Kock trained The Apache for Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa al Maktoum; de Kock both trains and co-owns Arlingtons Revenge.\n\nArmored Car (Giant’s Causeway – Gold Mover)\n\nThat is why such a thing exists.\n\nArsen Annie (Kerosene – Anchor Tennant)\n\nThis name’s on fire.\n\nBeemie Award (Distorted Humor – In Bloom)\n\nThe Beemie Awards are weird, funny, and the best night of the year on racing Twitter.\n\nCall Triple A (Jump Start – Mrs. Vanderbilt)\n\nIt’s basically their reason for existing.\n\nColonial Power (Curlin – Provincial)\n\nThe name has nothing to do with him being a Curlin baby, but the sidelong yet brutally honest take on the dam’s name works.\n\nCopperplate (Curlin – Verdana Bold)\n\nBonus for being a chestnut.\n\nCover Version (Medaglia d’Oro – Vaguely Familiar)\n\nIt’s…not wrong.\n\nD’Bunnyphone (D’Funnybone – Wanda Nevada)\n\nTen points for finding the cutest spoonerism ever.\n\nDenoun N Deverb (Denouncer – Honey’s Connection)\n\nTwo of this Illinois-bred multiple stakes winner’s progeny have been real runners: the multiple stakes winner Sasy Ms. Elizabeth, and the solid allowance contender Flying Mr K. However, I wait with bated breath for the day when a Denoun N Deverb baby has a grammar joke in their name.\n\nEmma Lazarus (Point of Entry – De Aar)\n\nAnd, I mean the original spirit of her sonnet.\n\nIrish You Well (Broken Vow – Pun)\n\nThis groan-worthy wordplay works so well because Irish You Well was originally campaigned by Donegal Racing, who often uses Irish-themed horse names.\n\nJ Jett (Bernstein – Lavigne)\n\nYou think Avril Lavigne rocks? No, no, no. I’ll show you a real rocker chick.\n\nJukebox Money (English Channel – Atlanta Highway)\n\nWhy yes, I’ve spent many a late night belting out “Love Shack” in a dingy karaoke bar. And, bonus points for John Dooley’s emphatic, sing-song call of her maiden win at Arlington.\n\nKeen Ice (Curlin – Medomak)\n\nDespite its lack of an Irish theme, he is another Donegal horse. They named a Curlin baby after a curling term. Keen Ice is fast ice, ice on which a stone travels easily with less effort to push it. Unfortunately there were a few more obstacles in his way on Derby Day than a curling stone may encounter, but his name remains clever.\n\nLong Face (Whywhywhy – Louve Mysterieuse)\n\nHopefully she’s walked into at least one bar.\n\nLebowski (First Dude – Storm Miss)\n\nObvious? Maybe. But, thank goodness someone did this, and did this in her sire’s first crop. The Big Lebowski is the First Dude, after all.\n\nMacarthur (Charge Forward – Mozambique)\n\nA five star name for a Charge Forward baby.\n\nNope (No Nay Never – Bright Sapphire)\n\nA shorter version of the same sentiment.\n\nSahara Toga Party (Desert Party – Tricky Move)\n\nMaking this name even better? She is New York-bred.\n\nSku (Repriced – Ratatuia)\n\nWay to turn the messy details of retail into a horse name!\n\nSponsored (Runhappy – Summer Cruise)\n\nBonus points: he’s owned by Mattress Mack.\n\nTasseography (Afleet Alex – Chinese Tea)\n\nWhy yes, tasseography does refer to the art of reading tea leaves.\n\nThunder Down Under (Lonhro – Wallstreeter)\n\nThere’s a certain “dammit, Beavis!” hilarity in the fact that he’s a gelding.\n\nTiny Danza (Danza – Promise to Peg)\n\nAnd, if we’re judging from his early two-year-old form…he’s a closer, Tiny Danza.\n\nVal Caponi (Volponi – Spycial)\n\nOF COURSE he’s Illinois-bred.\n\nWaddle (Stroll – Fusionista)\n\nThe adorable antithesis of strolling.\n\nWave of the Wand (Ben Bulben – A Blink and a Nod)\n\nThis name just sounds right. It could fall right into poetry with her dam’s name. (Unrelated to her name, she also has a wonderful blaze.)\n\nWile E Peyote (City Zip – Peyote Patty)\n\nThis is two generations of Doing Horse Naming Right, as his dam is so appropriately a Cactus Ridge mare.\n\nWiley Cayoke (Cayoke – Always In Command)\n\nIf only she were a few years younger, because a matchup with Wile E Peyote would have made for a delightful race call.\n\nWilla Cather (Pioneering – Mystery of Faith)\n\nLiterary references, for the win. It’s a more clever take on sire Pioneering than going for the obvious explorer or settler name.\n\nZircon Zloty (Street Boss – Ruby Ruble)\n\nHonourable mention to half-siblings Diamond Dollar, Golden Guilder, Platinum Pound, and Silver Shekel.\n\nSome names were clearly created just to mess with track announcers; as a race call aficionado, such names amuse me greatly.\n\nJimmy by a Nose (Silver Zipper – Naperville)\n\nHe made it onto my radar when he hit the worktab in October 2014, though he did not debut until April 2015. According to trainer Chris Ryan, he got his name because of his long head. He retired (through CANTER Chicago!) in the spring of 2016, still a maiden — but a maiden with a great name, and a great nose.\n\nThecoltintheback (Cayoke – Fuzzy Side Up)\n\nThis one jumped out at me on March 24, 2015, when listening to a call at Fairmount. I was briefly confused as to why the announcer referred to “the colt in the back” but then kept calling new horses, and then figured out that was actually the name of a runner. He did not bring up the rear; he came up the rail for fourth in a field of nine.\n\nYakahickamickadola (Kamehameha – Sony Gay)\n\nHe may have been a bit before my time, but fortunately Tom Durkin’s attempts to pronounce this name when he raced at Hialeah Park have been recorded for posterity. One night in 2013 I used “No, Tom, It’s Yakahickamickadola” as my nom de pub quiz in order to throw the quizmaster for a loop, but he pronounced it correctly on the first try.\n\nFinally, there are the names that have nothing to do with either of the parents, but still make the racing form a happier or more interesting place.\n\nColtimus Prime (Milwaukee Brew – Certainly Special)\n\nI figured out during his Display Stakes run in 2013 that he was a sharp racehorse…but I doubt I would have turned that race on at all if not for his excellent name.\n\nDame of Thrones (Fort Prado – Jacquie Sue)\n\nShe’s not a chestnut, so I’m guessing they don’t see much Cersei Lannister in her. Thank goodness.\n\nEighteencharacters (Tribal Rule – Midnite Mama)\n\nEighteen characters is the most allowed for a Thoroughbred horse name…and it’s perfect that the phrase comes out to exactly eighteen characters.\n\nHippodrome (Animo de Valeroso – Hypnosis)\n\nYo, dawg, I heard you like horse racing, so I put Hippodrome in your hippodrome…\n\nLandbiscuit (Orb – Dreams of Fire)\n\nI can’t believe it took all the way until the 2020s to see a horse named Landbiscuit.\n\nLisa’s Mad Again (Animo de Valeroso – Lucky Deputy)\n\nNothing like an Illinois-bred horse whose name is an Illinois political reference.\n\nPepper Roani (Broken Vow – Ho Joy)\n\nHe’s grey or roan, and he has a posse.\n\nPotoooooooo (Eclipse – Sportsmistress)\n\n“Hey, write this horse’s name on the feed bin. Potatoes.” *Writes Pot, followed by eight o’s*. Honourable mention in the one-parent category to this horse’s prepotent son at stud: Waxy (Potoooooooo – Maria).\n\nReversiontothemean (Curlin – Jet Setter)\n\nI doubt I will ever know what possessed someone to name a racehorse Reversiontothemean, but as both a math person and a bastion of mediocrity, I enjoy this name thoroughly.\n\nSultan of Swatara (Offlee Wild – Faith’s Way)\n\nAs befits his name, he has done the vast majority of his running at Penn National.\n\nVariegated (Bah Da Bling – Janine)\n\nWell, he is…\n\nWin (Barachois – Par Ci Par La)\n\nNaming a horse “Win” may put a lot of pressure on…but safe to say you’ve earned that name if you’ve got a few Grade 1 races to your credit. (Thanks for the suggestion, Jan!)\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list of excellent horse names, and will slowly grow as I discover or remember names that bear repeating.\n\nDo you have any favourite horse names?
