        "text": "OUR DESERT HOME\n\nWith nearly 1.6 million square feet of competition and riding space, the Desert International Horse Park is one of the largest equestrian facilities in North America. Offering 15 weeks of world-class competition from October through March, the facility is a destination location for thousands of equestrians, their horses, family and friends for several months annually. Competitors from all over the world travel to Thermal, CA to not only compete but to enjoy everything the desert has to offer.\n\nSurrounded by the beauty of picturesque mountains, the Desert International Horse Park is close to Palm Springs, Desert Hot Springs, La Quinta, Coachella and more unique places to discover. The area is known for its resort lifestyle with a selection of fine dining, art & film festivals, golf & tennis, outdoor adventures, and wonderful warm, dry weather in the winter months. As the Greater Palm Springs Convention & Visitors Bureau claims, come #findyouroasis in the desert.\n\nFacility Map\n\nOur Mission\n\nAt Desert International Horse Park, we aspire to build the equestrian sport on the West Coast and ensure that West Coast athletes have an equal opportunity to enjoy the sport and achieve their aspirations regardless of what those may be, at an internationally-recognized horse park. We are proud to be a strong partner for everyone involved in the sport on the West Coast, and we hold ourselves to the highest standards, knowing the sport and athletes in California deserve the best.\n\nAt DIHP, we are focused on the following core principles:\n\nThe horse park is as good as it gets:\n\nFrom the beginning, our focus was on par with other great horse parks around the world. We are proud to have a Grand Prix ring and Grass Field that riders and horses say “they love.” It’s why we build a bridle path that riders and horses say “they love.” It’s why all of our stalls are now 12×12. It’s why riders, horses, and dogs say “they love” our grazing field and why we just planted trees throughout it. Our focus now is on ensuring the park looks great every day, is clean, is free of maintenance problems, the trees and shrubbery are well watered and always trimmed, and dust is kept to a minimum. We aim to continue to add to the beauty that has become our horse park. We hope when you arrive you see our attention to detail, and that it makes you as delighted to be here as we are.\n\nKeeping horses happy and safe, from biosecurity to footing\n\nQuite simply, we put horses first. Ensuring horses are safe and comfortable is always our top priority. We make sure that everywhere a horse roams, it is going to step on good ground, free of debris and safe for the job intended. We’re proud to be the only horse park in the U.S. with a dedicated biosecurity officer. We know there is always room to improve, but we have set the bar high on this front.\n\nRunning a good horse show\n\nQuite simply, we put horses first. Ensuring horses are safe and comfortable is always our top priority. We make sure that everywhere a horse roams, it is going to step on good ground, free of debris and safe for the job intended. We’re proud to be the only horse park in the U.S. with a dedicated biosecurity officer. We know there is always room to improve, but we have set the bar high on this front.\n\nBuilding sport\n\nTop sport has been missing here on the West Coast, and we have to play our part to build it. Simply, the level of competition we put on is essential to building top sport. We must inspire and motivate young riders to become the next generation of top-level riders. We are always so proud when our West Coast riders win around the country. It is a tribute to our focus on elevating the quality of sport here.\n\nMaking the horse park your happy place\n\nOur team is committed to making your time with us memorable for all the right reasons. This is easier to do when you have a dedicated team of people who love what they do. Like you, we are horse people and want the experience to be the best. We need to always find a way to get it done. We seek to constantly surprise you with something positive. And we will do this during week 10, not during just week 1.\n\nOUR TEAM\n\nFinding a fantastic team that puts horses first, while having a keen focus on the rider, trainer, owner, and sponsor experience, is a key aspect of our vision. Welcoming a mix of fresh and familiar faces, our goal is to bring in individuals who specialize in creating an excellent show experience.\n\nHaving just begun to make our vision a reality in August of 2019, we now have a core group of experts to kick our plans into gear. The Desert Horse Park International team continues to grow as we seek to achieve our goals for an excellent customer experience.\n\nMeet Our Team\n\nSteve Hankin\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nA horseman and a rider himself, Steve Hankin is passionate about making the experience at the horse park great for everyone – horses and people – and transforming DIHP into a national equestrian destination for the West Coast.

He has been a staple in the Chicago show world, running small and large shows at his home base, Ledges. More recently, he took the reins of Pennsylvania National, the Devon Horse Show, the Upperville Colt & Horse Show, and the USHJA National Championships in Las Vegas. Pat simply wants to create rings that people can’t wait to compete in!\n\nSkyler Brittner\n\nScheduling & Technical Manager\n\nSkyler brings 15 years of horse show experience as a core member of the DIHP team. This year he is transitioning away from handling stalls to lead our expanded FEI and jumper program. He also handles day-to-day scheduling alongside Ashley.

He has worn many ‘hats’ in the sport, including being a trainer, competitor, course designer, judge & clinician.\n\nKyle Gould\n\nFooting Manager\n\nKyle is simply the best in the business. He splits his time between Traverse City, Michigan, assisting Matt Morrissey, and the desert, with DIHP. At Thermal, Kyle oversees 1.6 million square feet of competition, schooling, and lunging space.

Jessie Ann prides herself in creating unique, detailed, and well-organized equestrian events that everyone can enjoy!\n\nLori Hill\n\nSponsorship\n\nDespite her parents purchasing her an unruly Arabian/Standardbred-cross mare as her first horse, Lori’s love of horses is unflappable. After years of education and employment in the healthcare sector, she found herself as the general manager of a 450+ member equestrian club on the west coast of Canada. It was here that her love of all things equestrian was rekindled as she worked on everything from sponsorships and horse shows to footing and fencing. With her love of all things horse show-related (fancy ribbons being #1) and her commitment to exceptional customer service, Lori was a logical addition to the DIHP team.\n\nTori Bilas\n\nPress & Communications\n\nTori brings vast media experience from her years at equestrian agencies as well as time spent traveling with ESPN’s studio show College GameDay.
