        "text": "Expert Eye is set to make his eagerly anticipated seasonal reappearance in the Al Basti Equiworld Supporting Greatwood Greenham Stakes at Newbury on Saturday.\n\nSir Michael Stoute's charge made a successful debut at the Berkshire circuit last June and looked every inch a top-class horse in the making when dominating his rivals in the Vintage Stakes at Goodwood.\n\nHowever, he trailed home last of nine runners when odds-on for the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket and as a result he heads into his three-year-old campaign with something to prove.\n\nTeddy Grimthorpe, racing manager to owner Khalid Abdullah, told Press Association Sport: \"He's very much an intended runner. He worked at Chelmsford on Saturday, Sir Michael was very happy with him and I think we're all keen to get him going.\n\n\"I think you're always mindful of the ground. We're not expecting fast ground, obviously, but the outlook looks good for the next few days and as long as it's safe then we'll be happy.\n\n\"Obviously he has to bounce back, but he seems in very good form.\"\n\nExpert Eye is a best-priced 10-1 for the Qipco 2000 Guineas and is the star name among 15 entries for this weekend's recognised trial.\n\nHis potential rivals include the William Haggas-trained Headway, who impressed in the Spring Cup at Lingfield last month, George Scott's James Garfield and Fighting Irish from Harry Dunlop's yard.\n\nThe fillies get their chance to stake a Classic claim in the Dubai Duty Free Stakes - better known as the Fred Darling.\n\nThe Abdullah silks are set to be carried by Roger Charlton's Gavota, who was placed in the Rockfel and the Oh So Sharp Stakes at Newmarket last autumn.\n\nGrimthorpe added: \"The plan is for her to run, too. She's wintered well and has come in her coat. She looks very well at the moment.\n\n\"She's in good form and it will be good to get her started.\"\n\nThe 20-strong entry also includes Karl Burke's Ellthea, the Haggas-trained Tallow and the unbeaten Teppal, trained by David Simcock.\n\nGroup Three honours are also up for grabs in the Dubai Duty Free Finest Surprise Stakes - registered as the John Porter.\n\nPotential runners in this mile-and-a-half contest include the prolific Defoe from Roger Varian's stable, Call To Mind, who is trained by Haggas for the Queen, and Brian Meehan's Raheen House.\n\nreopens Burke also had the option of running Ellthea in the Nell Gwyn at Newmarket on Wednesday, but decided the extra time would be beneficial. He said: \"We decided to skip Newmarket and give her an extra couple of days, which allows me to do a little bit of work with her (on Tuesday morning) as we felt Newbury probably wouldn't dry out as quickly as Newmarket might.\""
