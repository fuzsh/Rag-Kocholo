        "text": "Arizona's OTBs are located in bars and restaurants statewide. ADG is committed to keeping the public informed and will post updated information as it becomes available.\n\nArizona law allows for commercial race track permittees to petition the Arizona Racing Commission to open OTB sites around the state. These satellite wagering locations are typically placed in bars and restaurants, and provide patrons with a convenient way to wager on horse and dog racing without the need to travel to the race track.\n\nWagers placed at these facilities are treated the same as if they were placed at the race track. There are currently 40 OTBs in operation statewide.\n\nPlease note that locations are subject to change."
