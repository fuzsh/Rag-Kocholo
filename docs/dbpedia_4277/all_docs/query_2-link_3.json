By Deputy Minister out of Secret Red. Has Secretariat as his grand-sire on his dam's side and Northern Dancer on both sides...oh the inbreeding He was raced a bit over fences (can't really see why) and although he never won, he was nearly always top 3. Think he sold for a ridiculous amount (as in somewhere near a million) as a yearling. Sad since we bought him for about $5,000 as a 5 year old He was quite nutty, but a fantastic jumper and beautiful at dressage! If Mum hadn't had a really bad fall (actually not his fault for once), I would've kept on eventing him. Unfortunately we sold him on to a woman that didn't take our advice (he was prone to ulcers and had very high withers so we sold his saddle on to her but she didn't use it and rode him into the ground) so she had to retire him a couple of years ago which is sad as he's only 18 this year so should have plenty of pep left in him\n\nGingey\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\n6 January 2012\n\nMessages\n\n146\n\nVisit site\n\nLol a Green Desert reunion sounds like it could be pretty entertaining given their relative quirks!!\n\nDone the pedigree search thing on mine, as well as having the Danzig, Northern Dancer lines on the Green Desert side, he's got Mill Reef as great-grand sire on dam's side\n\nSome pics of him in case anyone can see any similarities between theirs and mine.
