        "text": "News for 2019 Lanwades successes\n\n23rd December 2019\n\nHAPPY CHRISTMAS\n\nWishing all our friends, colleagues and clients a very Merry Christmas and very Happy, Healthy and Successful 2020 from us all at Lanwades..\n\n11th November 2019\n\nA NEW GROUP 3 WINNER FOR SEA THE MOON\n\nWONDERFUL MOON, a two-year-old colt by SEA THE MOON was a most impressive winner of the Gr.3 Grosser Preis Herzog von Ratibor-Rennen at Krefeld yesterday over 8.5f. He raced in mid-division and went clear in the home straight to win easily by some 12 lengths. He was runner-up in last month's Gr.3 Preis des Winterfavoriten and has gone one better here for his breeder GestÃ¼t GÃ¶rlsdorf, owner Stall Wasserfreunde and trainer Henk Grewe and is now favourite for next year's German Derby - a race that his sire won by some 9 lengths back in 2014. It was a great day for GestÃ¼t GÃ¶rlsdorf as another one they have bred three-year-old filly NOUVELLE LUNE won her fourth race of her career when winning over 12f at Jagersro - she had previously won the the Svenskt Oaks and was third in the Listed Norsk Derby and also won as a two-year-old.\n\n8th November 2019\n\n2020 NOMINATION FEES\n\nThe 2020 nomination fees for the stallions have now been set as follows -\n\nBOBBY'S KITTEN - Â£8,000\n\nSEA THE MOON - Â£15,000\n\nSTUDY OF MAN - Â£15,000\n\nSIR PERCY - Â£7,000\n\nAll nominations on 1st October Special Live foal terms\n\n7th November 2019\n\nA NEW STAKES WINNER FOR SEA THE MOON\n\nThree-year-old colt ENJOY THE MOON by SEA THE MOON became his sire's 18th Stakes performer when winning the Listed Grand Prix du Nord at Chantilly yesterday for breeders Gestut Hof Ittlingen & Sebastian Weiss, owner Gestut Ittlingen and trainer P Schiergen.\n\n7th October 2019\n\nSTUDY OF MAN MAKES DEEP IMPACT AS ADDITION TO EUROPEAN STALLION RANKS\n\nFrench Derby winner STUDY OF MAN, by Japanese super-sire DEEP IMPACT out of a daughter of the legendary, 10-times Group 1 winner MIESQUE (also dam of Classic winners KINGMAMBO and EAST OF THE MOON) has been retired from racing and will stand at Lanwades Stud in Newmarket.\n\n\"We are thrilled to see French Derby winner STUDY OF MAN join fellow Derby winners SIR PERCY and SEA THE MOON, as well as Breeders' Cup Turf Sprint winner BOBBY'S KITTEN, at Lanwades\" said the stud's Owner and General Manager, Kirsten Rausing.\n\n\"I am immensely grateful to Maria Niarchos Gouaze and the entire Niarchos Family for letting us have STUDY OF MAN at Lanwades. It's great to be able to continue a long-standing friendship and co-operation which goes back to the early 1980's. At that time, Mr Stavros Niarchos was a shareholder in Lanwades' flagship sire, NINISKI, from whom he bred Group 1 winners LOUIS CYPHRE and French Derby winner, HERNANDO.\n\nHERNANDO spent his entire stud career at Lanwades, siring Epsom Oaks winner LOOK HERE and French Derby winners HOLDING COURT as well as Champion and 6-time Group 1 winner SULAMANI (Bred by the Niarchos Family).\n\nI very much look forward to our new joint venture with STUDY OF MAN, a really good-looking horse with exceptional presence, great racing performance and possessing a truly world-class pedigree. As a son and grandson of racing legends, he should make an outstanding addition to the worldwide breeding industry, contributing an outcross for many mares\", she concluded.\n\n18th September 2019\n\nTRIPLE CROWN WINNER\n\nAfter winning the Norwegian Guineas and the Norwegian Derby this year SEA THE MOON's son PRIVILEGIADO was today the easy winner of the Norwegian St Leger to complete the Norwegian Triple Crown. His earnings are now nearly Â£100,000. Many congratulations to his connections - Haras de Bourgeauville (breeder), Stall Bright Side of Life (owner) and Niels Petersen (trainer).\n\nPlease click here to see his race.\n\n16th September 2019\n\nNEW 2 YEAR OLD WINNER FOR SEA THE MOON\n\nSEA THE MOON had another 2yo winner when TICKLE ME GREEN was a good winner on debut at Hanover over 7 furlongs in Germany yesterday for her owner/breeder GestÃ¼t GÃ¶rlsdorf, the plan is for her to run again soon at Baden-Baden.

By SEA THE MOON out of ALPHA LUPI, she is a Niarchos Family homebred filly and has a most outstanding pedigree, she is half-sister to last year's star filly ALPHA CENTAURI who was a four-time Group 1 winner as a three-year-old for the same trainer Jessica Harrington.\n\n26th August 2019\n\nA NEW LISTED WINNER FOR SEA THE MOON\n\nSEA THE MOON had a new Listed winner yesterday when the Niels Petersen-trained PRIVILEGIADO was the runaway winner of the Listed Norsk Derby at Ovrevoll winning by some 15 lengths much like his sire did when winning the German Derby. SEA THE MOON also sired the third home, NOUVELLE LUNE, who had previously won the Swedish Oaks. PRIVILEGIADO was foaled in Britain, but was bred by Haras de Bourgeauville and was purchased at the Arqana October Yearling Sales. It has been a good few days for winners for SEA THE MOON as his three-year-old daughter Lanwades-bred ALEMAGNA stayed on strong to win the valuable Fillies Handicap at Goodwood yesterday. SEA THE MOONâs progeny earnings this year are now well over Â£1 million. Two winners today, 5 since Friday evening. He ranks 5th on list of all European 2nd crop sires. See PRIVILEGIADO's impressive win here\n\n25th August 2019\n\nLANWADES-BRED GROUP RACE DOUBLE AT YORK\n\nIt was a great day at York when two horses bred by Lanwades won the two Group prizes that were on offer. First up ZAAKI, trained by Sir Michael Stoute, put up a strong performance to just get the better of BANGKOK in the Gr.3 Strensall Stakes. Then two races later SHINE SO BRIGHT made all the win the feature race of the day, the Gr.2 City of York Stakes for trainer Andrew Balding. SHINE SO BRIGHT IS out of ALLA SPERANZA, herself a Group 3 winner by SIR PERCY. He was first sold at the Tattersalls December Sales as a foal, then as a yearling at Goffs Orby Sale. He won first time out for Karl Burke and was then sold to King Power Racing at the Goffs London Sale for Â£375,000 and finished 5th in Gr.2 Coventry Stakes. He was then transferred to Andrew Balding's yard and finished 3rd in three Gr.2's as a juvenile before winning the Listed Free Handicap at Newmarket on his reappearance as a three-year-old. SHINE SO BRIGHT then ran sixth in the 2000 Guineas where the mile was possibly a bit too far for him, back to 7f he did well to wind this highly competitive Gr.2 City of York Stakes keeping the six-time Group 1 winning LAURENS behind him. SHINE SO BRIGHT is by OASIS DREAM, but has Lanwades stallions SELKIRK and SIR PERCY close up in his pedigree. ZAAKI is by the late Lanwades stallion LEROIDESANIMAUX. Both of their dams and several sisters are very much in action in the present Lanwades broodmare band.\n\n24th August 2019\n\nA GREAT 2YO DOUBLE FOR SEA THE MOON\n\nThere were two winners from SEA THE MOON's second crop yesterday - first up was Lanwades-bred TRITONIC who won well on his only second start when taking the 7.5f furlong novice at Ffos Las from a perfectly timed ride from Megan Nicholls. Next up in the evening was a great win for the very talented ALPINE STAR in the highly competitive Gr.2 Debutante Stakes at The Curragh. The Niarchos Family homebred filly showed real determination and class to win by a short head. ALPINE STAR is trained by Jessica Harrington who has high hopes for the filly and she has even earned a quote for next year's 1,000 guineas. More to follow..\n\n4th August 2019\n\nANOTHER CLASSIC WINNER FOR SEA THE MOON\n\nSecond classic win in Scandinavia for SEA THE MOON as NOUVELLE LUNE lands the Swedish Oaks, by more than 8 lengths, with Â£60,000 to the winner. Trained by Wido Neuroth, owned by Stall Perlen and bred by GestÃ¼t GÃ¶rlsdorf. Future plans for the filly may involve a clash with SEA THE MOONâs Norwegian 2000 Guineas winner PRIVILEGIADO in the Norwegian Derby later this month. Click here to see the race.\n\n2nd August 2019\n\nIMPRESSIVE 2 YEAR OLD WINNER FOR SEA THE MOONâ¦ Another winner for SEA THE MOON as 2 year old filly ALPINE STAR is an impressive 3 Â½ length winner of a 7f Maiden at Galway. She is a half-sister to last yearâs four-time Gr.1 -winning Champion Miler ALPHA CENTAURI. ALPINE STAR is owned and bred by Niarchos Family and trained by Jessica Harrington.\n\n26th July 2019\n\nWINNERS GALORE FOR HORSES BRED BY LANWADES\n\nLORD (formerly MISTER) BELVEDERE, by ARCHIPENKO, wins in Australia on 20th July the very the same day as his half-brother PONDUS, by SEA THE MOON, gains black-type here when finishing second in the Listed Steventon Stakes at Newbury for trainer James Fanshawe. Their dam, DIABLERETTE, is a three-parts sister to Group 1 winner LADY JANE DIGBY and multiple Group 3 winner GATEMAN with their dam being Champion three-year-old filly and Horse of the Year MARIA WALESKA. DIABLERETTE has a full sister yearling (already named DEVILRY) and a full brother foal to PONDUS.\n\nOn the same day four-year-old gelding VERHOYEN who is 5th generation Lanwades-bred by PICCOLO out of a WITH APPROVAL mare, who is out of a NINISKI mare; so 3 generations of Lanwades stallions also, won the Historic Scurry Handicap over 6 furlongs on The Curragh for trainer Michael Grassick, who also trains the geldingâs two-year-old full sister MUSICAL MEMORIES for Lanwades. VERHOYEN is now the winner of three races and has won over Â£144,000 in prize money.\n\nA couple of days before, two-year-old filly ALPINISTA, 4th generation Lanwades-bred, wins a nice maiden on debut at Epsom, beating colts in doing so. Trained by Sir Mark Prescott, ALPINISTA, travelled strongly in the race and showed a decisive turn of foot to win this with plenty of authority. ALPINISTA is by FRANKEL and is a first foal for her dam, ALWILDA who won four races including a Listed race in Germany. ALWILDA is a half-sister to Group 3 winner ALGOMETER and Listed winner ALL AT SEA out of three-time Group 1 winner and German Horse of the Year ALBANOVA. ALPINISTA now heads for a Black Type race, probably in mid-August.\n\n3rd June 2019\n\nA NEW STAKES WINNER FOR SEA THE MOON\n\nThree-year-old filly PRECIOSA was an impressive winner of the Listed German Oaks Trial at Baden Baden for her owner/breeder GestÃ¼t GÃ¶rlsdorf on Saturday.

Their dam, DIABLERETTE, has a yearling filly and colt foal, both by SEA THE MOON.\n\n23rd May 2019\n\nDOUBLE FOR LANWADES HOMEBRED FILLIES\n\nOn Thursday, May 23rd, two Lanwades-bred fillies added not only to their own value but also to their respective familiesâ lustre, by each impressively winning.\n\n4-y-old FRANCOPHILIA, a third-generation Lanwades bred who traces back to the great Italian Champion racemare MARIA WALESKA and is herself a daughter of Group 1 winner LADY JANE DIGBY, won her maiden at Lingfield in taking style for trainer Mark Johnston, who also handled her dam. The mare also has a 3yo filly DAME FREYA STARK (by Leroidesanimaux) and a 2yo filly, AVENTURIERE (by Archipenko), both also with Mark Johnston. LADY JANE DIGBY further has a filly foal by CHURCHILL and is in foal to SEA THE MOON.\n\nIncidentally, LADY JANE DIGBYâs Â¾ sister DIABLERETTE (by Green Desert) is the dam of promising 3yo colt PONDUS (by Sea The Moon), a winner in his second and most recent start for trainer James Fanshawe. DIABLERETTE also has a yearling filly and colt foal, both by SEA THE MOON.\n\nAlso yesterday, 3yo filly ALOE VERA (Invincible Spirit â Almiranta, by Galileo â Alvarita, by Selkirk out of the great Alborada) continued her winning ways three weeks after scoring on her debut, this time in the Listed Height of Fashion Stakes (10f, 2000m), traditionally seen as an Oaks Trial.\n\nALOE VERA, like her Gr 2 winning half sister ALYSSA, is trained by Ralph Beckett. ALOE VERA is an own sister to 2yo Group winner ALEA IACTA (Prix Thomas-Bryon, Gr 3) and a half-sister to ALYSSA, by Sir Percy, winner of the Gr 2 Park Hill Stakes. Both these mares have 2019 filly foals by SEA THE MOON and INVINCIBLE SPIRIT, respectively. Their dam, ALMIRANTA, has a 2yo filly ALBAFLORA, by MUHARAAR, a yearling filly by BOBBYâS KITTEN and a filly foal by SEA THE MOON.\n\n17th May 2019\n\nA TRIPLE HAT TRICK FOR LANWADES STALLIONS\n\nOn Friday 17th May, SEA THE MOON had three individual first-crop 3yo winners in three countries: firstly MOONIAC (c ex Margarita, bred by Dr K Schulte, owned by Pulp Master and trained by Roland Dzubasz) won his maiden in Hannover, Germany, becoming his sireâs first-crop individual winner no 30.\n\nThis was swiftly followed by French-bred PRIVILEGIADO (bred by Haras de Bourgeauville) winning easily over 1600m, giving 6 kg to beaten horses, at Ovrevoll in Oslo for trainer Wido Neuroth and the âBright Side of Lifeâ Stable. PRIVILEGIADO won twice last year and was Champion 2yo in Norway. Future plans for the colt may involve a trial for the German Derby (itself run on 7th July).\n\nFinally, SUMMER MOON (c ex SONGERIE, by Hernando, a fifth-generation Lanwades-bred) continued his impressive winning run at York for trainer Mark Johnston and owners, âThe Originalsâ. SUMMER MOON had won his previous 2019 start equally easily at Windsor, and may next run at Royal Ascot.\n\nStill on Friday 17th May, unbeaten Champion 2YO and subsequent Derby winner SIR PERCY had a trio of winners at Hamilton in Scotland:\n\nNEVER BE ENOUGH (f ex Camp Fire, bred by J L Skinner, owned by Straightline Bloodstock and trained by Keith Dalgleish) won a handicap over 1600m (8f)\n\nTHEGLASGOWWARRIOR (g ex Sweet Cando, owned and bred by Mrs Lucille Bone and trained by Jim Goldie) won a handicap over 2400m (12f)\n\nUNIVERSAL GLEAM (g ex Mookhlesa, bred by Mrs D OâBrien, owned by Weldspec Glasgow Limited and trained by Keith Dalgleish) won a handicap over 1600m (8f)\n\nThe late, lamented Lanwades sire, French 2,000 Guineas winner and Gr 1 sire AUSSIE RULES had two winners and a Stakes place over three days; May 17-19th\n\nAZZURRO COBALTO (g ex Taurakina) was narrowly beaten second in the Gr. 3 Premio Carlo dâAlessio in Rome over 2400m (12f).\n\n3yo filly BELLA VITA (f ex Garabelle, bred by Shoreham Stud, owned by Mrs Heather Raw and trained by Eve Johnson Houghton) won her second consecutive race at Salisbury over 2000m (10f).\n\nGLENN COCO (g ex Las Hilanderas, bred by Old Mill Stud and S C Williams, owned by Miss Emily Stevens Partnership and trained by Stuart Williams) won his 4th race this year (7 in total) at Newmarket over 1400m (7f)\n\nAUSSIE RULESâ Lanwades-bred son ZANJABEEL (ex Grain Only), a 210,000 guineas Tattersalls October Sales yearling, was the Eclipse Awards Champion Steeplechaser in the USA in 2018, when he won the both Grade 1 designated steeplechases there).\n\n16th May 2019\n\nAPRIL FOALS\n\nA round dozen was the foal arrival count for April, and three of the twelve are produce of Lanwadesâ third season sire, Breedersâ Cup Turf Sprint winner BOBBYâS KITTEN. MEMORY LANE, a fourth-generation Lanwades-bred daughter of WITH APPROVAL out of a NINISKI mare, has a filly half-sister to two winners including VERHOYEN, Listed-placed as a two-year-old and already a winner at The Curragh this year at four. Also with a bay filly is AKSAYA, an unraced daughter of SEA THE STARS and HERNANDOâs Group 3 winning daughter AKDARENA, her second foal after an ARCHIPENKO colt in 2018. The third BOBBYâS KITTEN foal is a bay colt out of BOHEMIAN DANCE, a three-time winner by DANSILI out of the great Champion Race Filly and Mare ISLINGTON. He is his damâs fourth produce, following MANIC MONDAY, a three-year-old filly with Michael Bell; an as yet unnamed two-year-old colt by ELUSIVE QUALITY who is with Richard Fahey, and a yearling filly by LEMON DROP KID named CITRONNADE.\n\nFour mares visiting BOBBYâS KITTEN in 2019 foaled in April. The four are daughters of four different Lanwadesâ stallions. HERNANDOâs Group 3 Prix des Reservoirs winner SONGERIE has a FAST COMPANY half-sister to four winners, most recently and most notably SUMMER MOON, the SEA THE MOON three-year-old who made a very impressive five-length winning reappearance for Mark Johnston last week. The following with colt foals are multiple winners NEIGE D'ANTAN, a daughter of AUSSIE RULES whose 2019 grey son is by SEA THE MOON, and is a full-brother to NOSTALGICA, a two-year-old filly also with Mark Johnston; and APPARATCHIKA, ARCHIPENKOâs daughter whose third foal this is â her three-year-old first foal colt KINGS WAY and two-year-old second foal SEA THE MOON daughter ARRIVISTE are yet to run.\n\nJOLIE BLONDE, the three-time winning SIR PERCY filly who is the fourth of the April foalers visiting BOBBYâS KITTEN, has a 2019 MUKHADRAM third foal filly. Her first foal, the two-year-old ARCHIPENKO filly BELLE ROUSSE, is in training with Sir Mark Prescott, who handled both JOLIE BLONDEâs four-time winning dam AFFAIRE DâAMOUR and that mareâs ultra-consistent HERNANDO brother FOREIGN AFFAIRS, winner of 12 races including no less than 8 at Listed level.\n\nTwo of the remaining April arrivals are colts by OASIS DREAM. Group-placed ALUMNAâs is her fourth foal â her first, YOUARESTAR (2016 colt by Sea The Stars) is due to run today for William Haggas while her second, the two-year-old ARCHIPENKO filly ALPHA THETA, is another with Mark Johnston. Listed-placed winner BITE OF THE CHERRY, a half-sister to the dams of Group 1 winners POSTPONED and GOD GIVEN and Group 3 winners TURNING TOP and ROBIN HOODS BAY, has a grey colt fifth foal. BIPARTISAN, as a half-sister to ROBIN HOODS BAY is a close relative to BITE OF THE CHERRY, has a BATED BREATH third foal colt to follow fillies in 2017 by ARCHIPENKO and 2018 by BOBBYâS KITTEN. STARLIT SANDS, Group 3 Prix dâArenberg winner and Queen Mary Stakes runner-up who herself was the first Group winner ever by OASIS DREAM, has a DARK ANGEL filly half-sister to two winners (the mareâs first two foals) and to SIDEREAL, a two-year-old GALILEO colt.\n\nFinally, ALTERNANTHERA, an unraced daughter of NAYEF and ALAKANANDA, has a second foal filly by SIR PERCY. A granddaughter of Broodmare of the Year ALOUETTE, and a half-sister to photo-finish Derby runner-up DRAGON DANCER, she returns to that horseâs Epsom conqueror SIR PERCY. .\n\n13th May 2019\n\n29 INDIVIDUAL FIRST CROP WINNERS FOR SEA THE MOON AND AN IMPRESSIVE GROUP 3 WINNER\n\nWhat a great Sunday for SEA THE MOON yesterday with three winners from his first crop including the highly impressive HAMARIYNA winning the Gr.3 Derrinstown 1000 Guineas Trial. Bred and owned by His Highness The Aga Khan and trained by Michael Halford she looks to be a most exciting filly. SEA THE MOON has now sired three Group winners from his first crop. The other two winners were CARTES who was winning his second race this time at Longchamp having won as a two-year-old in Chantilly last year. The third winner was PRECIOSA who won easily on debut over 8 furlongs at Hoppegarten for her owner/breeder GestÃ¼t GÃ¶rlsdorf. SEA THE MOON has now sired 29 individual winners from his first crop, 3yoâs of 2019. He is one of the leading young sires of Europe.

MOON KING started the ball rolling winning a handicap well at Wetherby on 28th April which was quickly followed up by another win over the same course and distance on 7th May. SEASCAPE was next winning a decent fillies handicap at Salisbury for her owner/breeder Robert Allcock. Then came a winner in Switzerland in HIGH HOPE who was bred by Gestut Ammerland in Germany who won easily over nine furlongs. Then came three winners in two days headed by Lanwades-bred SUMMER MOON scoring at Windsor by five lengths for trainer Mark Johnston and GOLD winning over seven furlongs for owner/breeder GestÃ¼t GÃ¶rlsdorf and all being well she will be heading for the German 1000 Guineas next. Next up the following day was French-bred filly MOONOON who won at Saint-Cloud. We then just had three days to wait before the next winner which was Lanwades-bred PONDUS who won a novice at Nottingham over ten furlongs for trainer James Fanshawe. He looks a smart performer in the making and holds Epsom Derby and King Edward VII entries. That makes it 28 individual winners for SEA THE MOON from his first crop so far.\n\n26th April 2019\n\n21st INDIVIDUAL FIRST CROP WINNER FOR SEA THE MOON\n\nThree-year-old filly HAMARIYNA became the 21st individual first crop winner for SEA THE MOON when winning on her second start over 9 furlongs at Tipperary yesterday. Bred and owned by HH Aga Khan, HAMARIYNA ran well on her first start over 7 furlongs at Leopardstown when finishing third. She picked up really well in the closing stages over the extra two furlongs and earned a quote of \"A performance of substance from a filly with a future\" from the Racing Post.\n\n23rd April 2019\n\n20th INDIVIDUAL FIRST CROP WINNER FOR SEA THE MOON\n\nThree-year-old colt BLITZKRIEG became the 20th individual first crop winner for SEA THE MOON when winning over 9f at Prague on Monday.

Proven producers DIABLERETTE (three parts sister to Group 1 winner LADY JANE DIGBY and who has bred three winners and the promising three-year-old colt PONDUS to date) and KINETICA, a Listed winner whose first two foals are winners, both have bay colts, as does SELENOGRAPHY, a young unraced daughter of SELKIRK. The fourth SEA THE MOON is a chesnut half-brother out of CLAIOMH SOLAIS to PROUD SKY, a three-time winner, including in 2019, in Hong Kong. CLAIOMH SOLAIS will return to SEA THE MOON.\n\nAlso visiting SEA THE MOON are ALINSTANTE, a Timeform 100+ three-time juvenile winner by ARCHIPENKO, who has a grey second foal colt by MASTERCRAFTSMAN, and AKRANTI, an unraced daughter of Gr.3 Blue Wind Stakes winner AKDARENA, who has produced a first foal colt by BOBBYâS KITTEN. Another arrival by BOBBYâS KITTEN is the bay filly out of HELVETIA, the mareâs third produce following the now two-year-old filly AROSIENNE and yearling colt, who are both by ARCHIPENKO.\n\nMeanwhile ARCHIPENKOâs Gr.1 Champion Fillies and Mares Stakes winning daughter MADAME CHIANG has a third foal daughter by LOPE DE VEGA, her third filly in as many foals. Her first produce, the two-year-old KINGMAN filly ORIENTAL MYSTIQUE, is in training with MADAME CHIANGâs handler David Simcock while her yearling is a bay daughter of INVINCIBLE SPIRIT. Another daughter of ARCHIPENKO, KANDAHARI, a two-time winner herself from the family of SELKIRKâs Italian Champion son ALTIERI, has a first foal filly by SIR PERCY. The filly is closely related to SIR PERCYâs Lanwades-bred dual French Listed winning daughter PERSONA GRATA, who happens to be a half-sister to KANDAHARIâs dam KESARA. KANDAHARI will return to SIR PERCY.\n\nTwo new arrivals are colts by Classic-winning sons of GALILEO. LA VIE EN ROSE, a winning daughter of Group 1 winner LADY JANE DIGBY, has a first foal colt by Derby winner AUSTRALIA, while SO IN LOVE, a Stakes-placed winning fourth-generation Lanwades homebred, has a first-colt third foal by 2000 Guineas winner GLENEAGLES after fillies by SEA THE STARS (SPICE OF LIFE) and SEA THE MOON (STAGIAIRE), three-year-old and two-year-old respectively and both with Ralph Beckett. Both of these mares will visit BOBBYâS KITTEN this year, as will SO IN LOVEâs close relative SUNSET SHORE, a juvenile winner herself and whose first foal is also a two-year-old winner and who has this year produced a grey filly by GUTAIFAN.\n\nAcross the Atlantic at Gainesway Farm in Kentucky KARAMELA, an Airlie Stud-bred daughter of MASTERCRAFTSMAN out of a half-sister to Irish 2000 Guineas winner BACHELOR DUKE, tracing to SPECIALâs full-sister LISADELL, has a grey colt by Champion sire KITTENâS JOY, her second live foal following a chesnut colt born last year by 2016 Kentucky Derby winner NYQUIST. KARAMELA herself is a half-sister to the Lanwades & Staffordstown Studs Silken Glider Stakes (Listed) winner, GEMSTONE â dam of impressive Wood Ditton Stakes debut winner UAE JEWEL at the Newmarket Craven Meeting.\n\n17th April 2019\n\nLANWADES-BRED SHINE SO BRIGHT LANDS THE LISTED FREE HANDICAP\n\nOn the opening day of the Craven Meeting at Newmarket it was Lanwades-bred SHINE SO BRIGHT that won the Listed Free Handicap in convincing style. The son of OASIS DREAM broke well, got the rail and led a good gallop and went onto to score by a length and three quarters.
