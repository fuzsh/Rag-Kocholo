        "text": "7 min read\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nSir Michael Stoute rolls back the years\n\nOn Saturday afternoon on the famous Epsom Downs, Desert Crown (GB) (Nathaniel {Ire}) jumped well, sat three wide and three deep and won the Derby. It was as simple as that.\n\nExcept that for his supporting cast things haven't been so simple. Twelve years have passed since trainer Sir Michael Stoute won his last Epsom Derby with Workforce (GB). By his own admission, the intervening period has seen such top-flight victories increasingly hard to come by. In that time he has suffered the loss of his beloved long-term partner Coral Pritchard-Gordon and shrinking numbers at his Newmarket base saw him relinquish his secondary stables last year. Murmurs of his retirement mumbled through British racing's headquarters.\n\nAll rumours, of course - the master trainer has quite evidently lost none of that great touch employed over a mammoth career which has seen him win every British Classic. A setback in February saw the colt unable to make his 3-year-old debut until the G2 Dante S. in May. Having had a single (winning) start as a 2-year-old, this made Desert Crown a Derby winner on just his third lifetime start.\n\nAt times during the race, this inexperience could be observed; his jockey sat into the saddle to encourage him over the road crossings and he was one of only a few horses in the field to round (the left-handed) Tattenham Corner leading with his right leg. But otherwise he handled the occasion well - he was professional, calm and above all superior.\n\nWith three furlongs (600 metres) still to run there wasn't a horse left in the field that could take him further into the race, so he made his own way home. Such was the confidence and calm displayed by his jockey, Richard Kingscote, that he received just one tap behind the saddle (of the permitted seven in the UK). Entering the final half a furlong (100 metres) Kingscote glanced behind him to see nearest rival Hoo Ya Mal (GB) (Territories {Ire}) a few lengths behind. He put his whip down and guided Desert Crown home with just hands and heels.\n\nPartly it is this calm that caused Stoute to begin engaging Kingscote more regularly in 2021. He was formerly based in the North of England, where big rides, let alone big winners, are harder to come by for jockeys. In his mid-thirties, the move South to forge a stronger association with Stoute has propelled him onto the big stage and he is handling it with aplomb.\n\nIt was a first attempt at 12 furlongs (2400 metres) for all bar two of the 17-runner field, and Hoo Ya Mal's relishing of the trip (he was sent off at odds of 150-1) shows that he has clearly inherited stamina from his dam's sire, Montjeu (Ire). His dam, Sensationally (GB) was trained by Ralph Beckett, whose Westover (GB) (Frankel {GB}) finished a luckless third on Saturday.\n\nJust as Westover was beginning to make his run he was pushed onto the heels of West Wind Blows (Ire) (Teofilo {Ire}) by the passing Hoo Ya Mal. With Stone Age (Ire) (Galileo {Ire}) on his outside he was forced to check back and come wide. By the time he was rebalanced by jockey Rob Hornby he was a full 10 lengths behind Desert Crown. He closed the gap to 2.75l by the finish and was the only horse making headway, so expect to hear his name again.\n\nAs for future plans for Desert Crown, Stoute was his usual charming though taciturn self after Saturday's victory. However, he did point to speed on the dam's side leaving options open for a variety of trips, she being Desert Berry (GB) who is by Green Desert (USA). Wherever he heads next, he looks to have all before him.\n\nO'Brien breaking records again\n\nOn her own third birthday, Tuesday (Ire) (Galileo {Ire}) made history for her trainer Aidan O'Brien on Friday as he saddled a record 41st British Classic winner in the G1 Epsom Oaks. It was a thrilling race in which Tuesday had to repel the surging Emily Upjohn (GB) (Sea The Stars {Ire}), a TDN Rising Star, with the pair only separable in a photo.\n\nFrankie Dettori was disappointed and felt that the race might have gone the way of his mount, Emily Upjohn, but for a misfortune at the start. Soon after leaving the stalls she slipped, losing ground and forcing Dettori to take up a position at the rear of the field. However, she was never detatched and travelled for the majority of the race upsides the eventual winner.\n\nTuesday came into the race having placed in both the English and Irish 1000 Guineas, with the latter being run only 12 days before Friday's success. It was a tough performance from the filly, a late foal who's full sister Minding (Ire) was 2016's Epsom Oaks winner. The dam, Lillie Langtry (Ire) (Danehill Dancer {Ire}) was also trained by O'Brien and was a dual Group 1 winner. Her eight foals have all been by Galileo (Ire), with the latest, a 2-year-old filly, being yet to race.\n\nTuesday's jockey, Ryan Moore, when asked to compare her with Minding, said: \"She and Minding are similar size and very similar attitudes. Both have a lot of class, but this filly might be the stronger stayer.\"\n\nMoore's quote hints at why, despite her immaturity, O'Brien felt he had to run her in Friday's race, with the trainer noting: \"There's only one Oaks\".\n\nJapan\n\nNorthern Farm dominate Yasuda Kinen\n\nSunday's G1 Yasuda Kinen was won by Songline (Jpn) (Kizuna {Jpn}) for trainer Toru Hayashi and jockey Kenichi Ikezoe. The 4-year-old filly took a wide trip to just edge out Schnell Meister (Ger) (Kingman {GB}) in an exciting bunched finish.\n\nBoth of the first two home are under the ownership of Sunday Racing Co. Ltd, a racing arm shared by the Yoshida brothers. Songline's sire, Kizuna (Jpn) is by Northern Farm's much missed Deep Impact (Jpn) and was himself a winner of the G1 Japanese Derby.\n\nSongline was able to reverse the form and secure her first Group 1 victory having last year been beaten by Schnell Meister in the G1 NHK Mile Cup. This also adds a second Group 1 victor to sire Kizuna's record.\n\nUnited States\n\nEmmanuel thrives for surface switch\n\n'TDN Rising Star' Emmanuel (USA) (More Than Ready {USA}) appears to have thrived for a switch to a turf surface after his win in Saturday's G2 Pennine Ridge S. at Belmont Park.\n\nAfter breaking his maiden at Gulfstream Park in December last year, the Todd Pletcher-trained colt followed that with an easy win in an Allowance race at Tampa Bay in January this year.\n\nThis put him in consideration as a leading Triple Crown contender. Despite a solid third in his last start, the G1 Blue Grass S., he seems to have found his forte in running on the turf and led all the way at Belmont Park, stacking up his rivals before stretching clear in the home straight.\n\nEmmanuel was a US$350,000 (AU$485,500) purchase from the 2020 Keeneland September Yearling Sale and is out of the unraced dam, Hard Cloth (USA) (Hard Spun {USA}). Hard Cloth is a half-sister to Group 1 winner Free Drop Billy (USA) (Union Rags {USA}) and the mutiple champion Hawkbill (USA).\n\nMilestone for Leparoux\n\nUS-based French jockey Julien Leparoux reached a huge milestone on Saturday at Churchill Downs in becoming just the fifth rider in history to win 1000 races at the track."
