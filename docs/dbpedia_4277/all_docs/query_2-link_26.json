        "text": "Working as the lead consultant for the STRI (Sports Turf Research Institute) with the Desert Group (Dubai) as contractors, a goal was set to strip, renovate and establish a 1.8 kilometre, turf grass horse racing track for the Saudi Cup, to be held in February 2021. Starting October 2020.\n\nThe pressure was high, as there was no time for mistakes to be made, no issues or problems could be encountered. Clear thinking and planning was needed to establish a very safe, strong and resilient track. A track capable of withstanding 1/2 ton thoroughbred horses running at full speed on it. This is no easy task even in a more favourable growing environment, and made more complicated given the short time period to complete all this within.\n\nJust to make life a little easier! There were severe restrictions on people movement into and out of the country. The small team on-site, would remain small, meaning the hiring in of unskilled labour to help complete some tasks during renovation, grow-in and establishment time was a necessity.\n\nWork started early October 2020, when the temperatures were 35 to 38 degree C, but temperatures during January and February would be a more reasonable 20 to 24 degree C. I think the biggest challenge here was the number of hours as sunshine hours. There is always clear skies and intense, constant, solar radiation levels due to this. The sun really does 'beat' down here and gives many agronomic challenges!Given the short period and the high temperatures encountered, it was decided that the best way forward was to manage the plant (a cool season grass, Lolium perenne) on a daily and weekly basis, rather than developing, a thought out, longer term, pre-determined route as you might expect when growing a crop. The plant was managed to develop the desired growth as fast as possible to expedite the full plant potential. Full consideration was given to all available products and application timings. Strategies were decided for nutrition and protection against disease (we were growing a cool season grass in desert temperatures), products assessed and sourced. Of which, I was limited for choice, in this country (general Agriculture products were plentiful, as you might expect, but no turf specific), and after a number of zoom meetings with STRI HQ in the UK, we were ready to go.\n\nInitial preparation was to strip old surface (first constructed during 2019), and grown for 3 races. Renovate and rotavate, add various soil amendments, rotavate again, consolidate and level. Local labour were trained on final levelling and finishing, no laser grader used. The area to be seeded covers more than 38,650 m2, 1.8 km long and 21m wide total turf surface.\n\nSeed was finally laid down on the surface on the 23rd October, with not the ideal type of seeder for this type of bare sand surface, (it was all we had in the country) but it performed fantastically (Redexim Speed Seeder - designed for overseeing operations). Once complete, the grow in period commenced.\n\nTemperatures for the grow in period were a steady 35 degrees C, meaning a close eye was needed each day (numerous times per day) to check on water status of sand, condition of plant and general growth rates.\n\nGermination occurred after only 4 days and then the \"agronomy' race was on to make this a stable and safe track for the 144 thoroughbred horses that would be using it during February and March 2021.\n\nTemperatures dropped to a more tolerant 25 to 30 degree C during December meaning steady growth could be achieved. This is still on the high end of the spectrum for growing Lolium, but with continued careful management progress was made.\n\nThe root mass and density was progressing well.\n\nAnd as time passed, the root mass continued to develop strongly - Picture below taken January 2021 with roots visible at more than 270mm depth.\n\nThe track was developing nicely, no issues to be concerned with, nor encountered and we were happy with the overall development of the entire surface. It was vital that over 38,650m2 area we had consistency and uniformity. There could be no weak areas.\n\nDuring January the track was tested by a number of methods. (1) Using the Electronic Going Stick to measure penetration strength and shear strength to 100mm and (2) five horses entered the track during mid January 21 to gallop and sprint over the surface for visual assessment of strength and then (3) at the end of January (29th) an official race consisting of 10 horses ran the track. All tests were past with few divots being displaced and great feedback was received from all the Jockeys'\n\nSo, this is probably long enough. The track performed brilliantly for the Saudi Cup Race days (2 of) and for the other 20 race days held on the turf surface in the 4 weeks after. Temperatures now reaching into the 40 degree area!\n\nOverall, the working non-stop with zero days off got it's rewards with a race surface being produced that had zero horse injuries or issues, allowed the race direction team to race as they wanted and most importantly allowed the Saudi Cup races, with some of the most expensive horses' in the World using it to be completed without any issue (apart from the rain on the 2nd day, yes, unbelievably, it RAINED, in the desert, on the 2nd day of the Saudi Cup! Zero rain before and zero rain afterward!!\n\nFor more information, please consider visiting www.itmg.consulting\n\nThere is NO .com after the web address :)"
