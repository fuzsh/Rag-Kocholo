        "text": "He may not be as good as Shady Heights or Never So Bold, Tong's two previous notables, but he could well prove a decent horse.\n\nWith the first of the Classic trials fast approaching - Golden Nashwan, the 2,000 Guineas fancy, is due to step out in Saturday's Easter Stakes at Kempton - this maiden win was of some significance, even though Danish Heights is to by-pass Newmarket.\n\nLast season, Danish Heights finished third to Green Desert, one of Michael Stoute's chief Guineas hopes, in a Newmarket maiden in October, and this winning performance boosted that form to some extent.\n\nRobert Armstrong, who trains the Tong-owned colt, said: ''This horse was never strong enough to do himself justice last season. But he has wintered very well, and we could now send him to run in Germany. We'll try not to overface him in the first half of the year.'' Tong has always been an enthusiastic owner over the years, both in Hongkong and Europe. He has four horses in training with Armstrong at present, and this could well be another noteworthy season for him.\n\nThis is also an important year for jockey Darryll Holland, who finds himself freelancing after a split with Barry Hills, his former employer. And the young stylist with the American crouch in the saddle could not have started better, winning Saturday's William Hill Lincoln at Doncaster, aboard Our Rita, a well-fancied 16-1 shot.\n\nAt the furlong, Martin Pipe's Just You Dare and Alex Scott's Mahool, the 7-1 favourite, led a wall of horses, while Missed Flight was storming home in the centre, just as Castel Roselo and Keston Pond led them up the stands' rail in a typical Lincoln finish.\n\nFor a split second Missed Flight and George Duffield looked likely to get up, but few had reckoned on Our Rita, who sat 10th in the far-side pack with 200 metres to race. Holland picked the gap, dashed through and snatched the prize, convincingly in the end by three-quarters of a length.\n\nHolland was delighted with this first big-race winner of the season. ''It's great to start like this. I knew Our Rita could win as long as I could get a run. As soon as I did, I knew she would win,'' the jockey said.\n\n''Freelancing this year, I just have to do well. Mr Hills and I parted company over my ride on The Deep at Newbury last season. I messed up and, who knows, maybe it will make a better rider of me in the long run,'' he added.\n\nHolland eased up on The Deep in the Horris Hill Stakes at Newbury after looking to have the race in his keeping.\n\nHe was caught in the last stride by the strong-finishing Tatami."
