        "text": "DOB: 10/02/10\n\nSTABLE NAME: Abs\n\nRACING TRAINER: Sir Michael Stoute\n\nRETIRED FROM RACING: 2015\n\nCLAIM TO FAME: A win on Oaks Day 2014\n\nFAVOURITE THING TO DO: Spending time with his best mate\n\nTYPICAL DAY: Abseil loves the outdoors. He likes an evening meal of grass nuts and linseed when competing he’s on sarasons endro mix. Abs and me ride out early morning around the country roads or the beach or the farm ride taking in all the views. He rides out by himself or in company at the weekends. Then a wash down before bring turned back out to have a good roll in the field with a couple of polo mints as he loves his afternoon naps.\n\nANNOYING HABITS: When Abs is going somewhere new he will try to push past you out of the stable as he’s not a fan of being cooped up in a stable. If Abs doesn't know you he will pull faces and have a nip at you if left in he will let himself out and back into field even if he has to jump back in.\n\nFITNESS ROUTINE: We ride out every day except when Abs has competed then he has one or two days off following competing at endurance. Sometimes we do pole work or Cross Country and dressage to keep his mind focused. We give lunging a miss that is one thing Abs totally hates to do.\n\nCOMPETITION: Abseil and I have tried dressage but gets fed up when warming up got 67 doing a preliminary. We tried Cross Country and qualified Eland Lodge, which was great considering he’s a Flat horse. Last year Abs and I tried endurance where he turned his hoof to it doing 20/25 miles. He scored the novice and elite prize of endurance in his first year .\n\nBIGGEST ACHIEVEMENT IN RETIREMENT: Abseil’s biggest achievement is turning in to an endurance horse after being a Flat horse. Competing at Builth Wells in Mid Wales over the big hills and winning the elite endurance for former racehorses.\n\nQUIRKS: Abseil is cheeky and he knows the place he wants to go and the places he doesn't want to go as he always lets you know even when boxing up to go somewhere. You have to be one step ahead of him."
