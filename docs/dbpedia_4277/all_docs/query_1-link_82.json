        "text": "I think it a very open race and I wouldn’t be surprised if something wins at big odds.\n\nA few comments:\n\nCasual Conquest: very impressive in his trial. I might have a few quid on him. I’ll see what he looks like in the paddock & at the start.\n\n(if the BBC bother to show the horses, rather than spending the time asking a bunch of drunken slags who they’re going to bet on)\n\nCurtain Call: I just don’t see why this horse is so short in the odds.\n\nNew Approach: I’ve laid this one. There are a lot of negatives against him. In particular, his last run was a shocker.\n\nTartan Bearer: Dante winners have won 4 out of the last 5 Derbys (I think… I may have just made that up). However, they all won the Dante comfortably. He looks a little short in the odds for the winner of a bobbing finish.\n\nRio De La Plata: plenty of class. I didn’t get a good look at him in his last race, so I’m hoping to check out his physique today to see what it says about his stamina. (though, I suspect it’ll say \"I’m a miler\")\n\nOthers: there are plenty in with a shout.\n\nI’m looking forward to it.\n\nSteve\n\nCasual Conquest – on seasonal debut and clearly needing the run to slim his figure and build some more muscle profile for further tests down the track, he bolted in impressively in the Derrinstown. His family indicates horses who race as far as 9 furlongs but being by Hernando he has no stamina worries. He does have natural speed and another Coolmore manipulation may leave him flat footed. However on a firm ground he just seems superior to the rest. The only horse in the race who looks like becoming a serious Group 1 candidate for the season onwards.\n\nDoctor Fremantle – The 2YO form is blossoming after Look Here’s win yesterday. He ran a superb seasonal debut in the Newmarket Class 3 and there will not be a more fitter, hardened up ready horse for the Derby than him. The tempo was seriously genuine in the Chester Vase and he was punched out with plenty remaining to win. The only concern is form – none of those Vase runners are here.\n\nFrozen Fire – Good in the Dante – not much else to speak of. Always a little hesitant of the Montjeus and that’s probably where I rule a line. I also think he would be stronger and resilient in softer going. The Dante trend of no also-ran winning the Derby also casts a shadow.\n\nKandahar Run – Unknown quantity apparently working the house down at HQ. Couldn’t settle when beaten by Campanologist on seasonal debut and his Newmarket Stakes win was insignificant. The market would have to be a guide and in early proceedings it seems to have done exactly that. Plenty against him though.\n\nKing Of Rome – Another very mysterious prospect with great signs at home of being right in the mix here. He’s probably after firmer ground than the Ballysax and definitely improved at Lingfield. I don’t think he appreciated the Lingfield turn and that leaves grave doubts when at Epsom. Some say he could become a St Leger type but his dam’s side includes a family of Bertolini and Green Desert. He should be one at odds.\n\nTartan Bearer – Must be continuing to mature and improve in ability as every day goes by considering he broke his Maiden on April 26 and won the Dante 3 weeks later. In that final furlong the field really spread themselves out which leads me to believe that this guy, plus Frozen Fire, are head and shoulders above and to 12 furlongs will only get better.\n\nVerdict\n\nSir Michael Stoute holds aces and will only be beaten by a bluffing performance from Coolmore. It comes down to three for mine:\n\nCasual Conquest\n\nDoctor Fremantle\n\nTartan Bearer\n\nI don’t think a loss from Casual Conquest will do his credentials any harm – it’s only his third start. Taking a St Jovite approach again here. He’ll be a serious horse down the track no doubt.\n\nThat leaves two. Tartan Bearer has the illustrious Dante win and Doctor Fremantle holds the important element of proven stamina. Tartan Bearer will not be swept up by any Coolmore manipulation and holds a very prominent and experienced Epsom hoop in Ryan Moore.\n\nBut Doctor Fremantle is being handled by a world class jockey as well in Kerrin McEvoy with those important runs on the board. He may end up becoming a St Leger type though.\n\nSelection: Tartan Bearer\n\nOutsider: King Of Rome"
