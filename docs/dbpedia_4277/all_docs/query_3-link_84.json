Expect some of your favourite British food choices and themed entertainment.

But, the Irish challengers will be primed and ready to come out on top in 2024.\n\nThe Betfred St Leger Festival's flagship day brings a dramatic climax. The biggest day of the week and home to the World's oldest Classic and final of the season, the Betfred St Leger Stakes. A well-known saying amongst the racing community states:\n\n“The fastest horse wins the Guineas; the luckiest the Derby – and the best horse wins the St Leger\".\n\nThe showpiece race consistently attracts leading stables across the country and boasts a glittering roll of honour with some of the most acclaimed horses in history.\n\nThe final day of the festival, the Betfred Sunday Funday, showcases great horse racing, including the Leger Legends charity race for ex-professional jockeys.\n\nThat's not all! Get ready for a day of fun, with a whole host of family-friendly entertainment on show across the course."
