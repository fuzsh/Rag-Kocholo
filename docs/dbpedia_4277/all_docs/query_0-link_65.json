        "text": "A chance to see some ‘behind the scenes’ of racing.\n\nDuring this exciting trip, we took our owners to Europe’s leading auction of racehorses. To begin our busy day we had a delicious breakfast and were given a very interesting introduction into the world of breeding.\n\nAfter this we began our journey around the sales complex. This particular sale is very popular this time of year and over 700 horses were sold over the four days. On the day we went lot 217 – a bay colt by Gone West – was sold for £1,000,000 (It was not purchased by Heart of the South – it went to Sheik Mohamed Al Mouktom, Godolphin!)\n\nAs well as absorbing the unique atmosphere of the sales ring, James O’Donnell of Templeton Stud explained to us what finer points the buyers were looking for. Also it was great fun “rubbing shoulders” with Sir Michael Stoute, Sheik Mohamed, Henry Cecil and Lester Piggott to name a few.\n\nThroughout our trip to Newmarket we also go to visit the National Stud where we were given a parade of stallions. We saw Myboycharlie, Cockney Rebel and Pastoral Pursuits, as well as lots of beautiful mares and foals. Stars of the show were our own Aunt Ruby and her Green Desert foal. It was a busy yet thoroughly enjoyable and knowledgeable day – there really is more to horse racing than meets the eye!"
