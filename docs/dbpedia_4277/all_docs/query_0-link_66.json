        "text": "The Epsom Derby is coming soon, but a lot of people in the United States might not know what it is. Don’t worry, we’ll tell you all about it so you can enjoy the excitement of this famous horse race!\n\nThe Epsom Derby, also known as the Derby Stakes, is a major horse race in England held every June for three-year-old horses. They race over a distance of one mile and four furlongs. With its long history and substantial prize, many people are passionate about it, especially those interested in race horse betting. Now, let’s take a look at some of the horses competing in this year’s event.\n\nThis Year’s Likely Winners\n\nRight now, there are over a hundred horses signed up for the Epsom Derby, but the final list hasn’t been decided yet. Usually, by the day of the race, there are fewer than twenty horses competing for the £850,000 prize. Last year, Desert Crown won, making Sir Michael Stoute and his team really happy.\n\nBecause of the rules, horses can only compete in the Derby once, so all the horses in this year’s race are new to it. One of the top picks is Auguste Rodin, who has already won three out of four races, including a big one at Doncaster.\n\nAnother horse to watch is Imperial Emperor, who has only raced once but won impressively at Newmarket. Even though he was a bit inexperienced, he still managed to win by a good margin.\n\nThe History of the Epsom Festival\n\nUnderstanding the history of a race can make it even more enjoyable, especially when it comes to British races like the Epsom Derby. This race has been happening since way back in 1780 and has been run every year except during wartime. It’s so old that it was the first race ever called a “Derby,” named after the Earl of Derby. In fact, the name “Derby” has been used for lots of other races, like the Kentucky Derby in the United States.\n\nThe Epsom Derby is also famous because it was the first race ever to be shown on television, way back in 1931. Plus, it used to be part of the Triple Crown, a series of three races with big prizes. Winning all three races meant a horse would be called a Triple Crown winner. While it’s really hard for horses to do that nowadays because of how breeding has changed, the Epsom Derby is still the richest race in the British flat racing calendar, even though its place in the Triple Crown is less important now.\n\nOrder of the Day\n\nNow let’s talk about what to expect on the big day of the Epsom Derby. If you’re lucky enough to go, make sure you arrive early because it gets really crowded, and Epsom is a small town that can get super busy.\n\nOnce you’re inside, head over to the parade ring or pre-parade ring to check out the horses before the race. It’s helpful to see them up close without the jockeys, so you can see how they’re doing and how fit they look. Some people even decide who to bet on based on how the horses look in the paddock.\n\nAfter checking out the horses, find a good spot in the grandstand to watch the race. You can place your bets if you want to. Watching from the grandstand gives you the best view of the whole track, but it can also be exciting to stand by the winning post for the last part of the race. Feeling the horses thunder past is an amazing experience and a great way to enjoy your first time at the Epsom Derby."
