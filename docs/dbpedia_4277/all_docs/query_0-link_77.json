        "text": "16 min read\n\nSchiller and Hyeronimus share Nathan Berry Shield\n\nTyler Schiller and Adam Hyeronimus shared honours for the 2023 Nathan Berry Shield for the most successful rider over the two-day Wyong Cup carnival.\n\nThe Shield, named in honour of Tommy Berry's late twin brother Nathan Berry, is decided on a 3, 2, 1 basis over the two days of the Wyong Cup Carnival. Last year's winner was James McDonald, while Kerrin McEvoy and Brenton Avdulla have also claimed the Nathan Berry Shield.\n\nClark, Bayliss and Prebble fall in Wyong Gold Cup\n\nFriday’s Wyong Gold Cup was marred by interference and the fall of The Mediterranean (Ire) (Galileo {Ire}) ridden by Regan Bayliss, caused several gallopers to be eased out of the race or dislodge their jockeys.\n\nThe Mediterranean was euthanised after it was determined the gelding sustained a catastrophic injury to the near foreleg, while ambulance officers transported Bayliss to hospital for further examination.\n\nTim Clark, riding Kalapour (Ire) (War Command {USA}), was also dislodged and was transported to the hospital.\n\nStewards will follow up with the condition of Kalapour in the coming days.\n\nBrett Prebble, riding Pretty Amazing (American Pharoah {USA}), was also dislodged but was reported conscious and to have escaped injuries. He was not taken to the hospital.\n\nPretty Amazing was inspected by on-course vets after the race with no abnormalities noted. However Racing NSW stewards will check on the mare's condition in the days subsequent\n\nMcDonald cleared of injury\n\nChampion Jockey James McDonald was in doubt for Saturday’s Randwick meeting after being involved in a fall on Wyong Gold Cup Day.\n\nMcDonald was aboard the James Cummings-trained Razors (Sidestep) in the fourth race - Da Vinci 3 & 4YO BM68 H. over 1300 metres, when the gelding knuckled upon the opening of the barriers.\n\nRazors' nose touched the ground causing McDonald to be launched over the gelding’s neck headfirst into the turf.\n\nRacing NSW steward Chris Albrecht said, “James (McDonald) has pain in his foot and his shoulder.\n\n“He has been ruled out for the remainder of Friday and scans will tell us if he is going to have any chance of riding on Saturday.”\n\nMcDonald was conscious after the incident and was transported to hospital. At 8pm AEST on Friday Racing NSW advised that McDonald had been cleared of any breaks and would be leaving hospital.\n\nYendall on the sidelines\n\nVictorian-based jockey Dean Yendall fell on Friday morning at the Colac jump-outs.\n\nYendall could have possible shoulder and collarbone injuries and will miss the opening Group 1 meeting of the season and potentially the following Saturday where is engaged to ride promising galloper Steparty (Artie Schiller {USA}).\n\nThe Victorian Jockeys’ Association confirmed on Friday afternoon that the 49-year-old had been transported to hospital and is awaiting scans.\n\nBambry’s Lace to uphold tradition\n\nChrissy Bambry’s smart filly Chantilly Lace (NZ) (U S Navy Flag {USA}) will look to uphold family tradition in Saturday’s Listed Wanganui Guineas.\n\n“Princess Biddy ran third for me two years ago so it has been a race that’s pretty good to us,” Bambry told Racing Desk NZ.\n\n“I’ve had a lot of luck at the Wanganui course. Chantilly Lace won the Castletown Stakes here.”\n\nBambry feels her filly will take improvement from Saturday’s run but her class should see her competitive.\n\n“There's a few in there who ran in the Ryder and that might give them the fitness edge on us but if the track keeps drying out, it will suit us,” Bambry said.\n\n“She's come back really well. She had a month in the paddock, then we just trained her from the big paddock just to give her a little bit more time out.\n\n“She did super with the time off. She's grown a bit. But she just loves the routine. and she gets a bit antsy at the gate in the afternoon if you don't bring her in early enough.\n\n“She's had a couple of trials, but she hasn't done much between them so she's probably going into this one still a little bit fat inside. She'll definitely improve with this run but she's been trialling super and loves that track so it would be nice to be in the top three again.”\n\nTyphoon causes Warrior to miss trial\n\nHong Kong’s champion galloper and Cox Plate aspirant Romantic Warrior (Ire) (Acclamation {GB}) has been forced to miss a vital trial on Friday morning because of a typhoon.\n\nThe Danny Shum-trained galloper was set to be partnered by Karis Teetan. However, Super Typhoon Saola saw the trials cancelled and rescheduled for Monday, causing concerns with Romantic Warrior, due to enter quarantine in Hong Kong over the weekend, to get to Melbourne on September 16, where he is set to undergo one final check by Racing Victoria in transport quarantine.\n\nColeman backs I Wish I Win’s preparation\n\nKatherine Coleman, co-trainer of I Wish I Win (NZ) (Savabeel), who will contest Saturday’s G1 Memsie S. over 1400 metres before chasing glory in the $20 million The Everest over 1200 metres, has backed the gelding’s ‘unconventional’ preparation.\n\nShe told Punters, “He thrives off three-week gaps between runs, and there just wasn’t an ideal lead-up race. Obviously, The Everest is the grand final day.\n\n“He’s shown us (Peter Moody/Katherine Coleman) he’s versatile and can win over 1400 metres and over the sprint trips. I don't think the distance is a genuine concern for us.\n\n“It’s maintaining the horse and the gap between runs to keep him fresh, bouncing and happy.”\n\nPurton to partner Light Infantry\n\nHong Kong’s Champion Jockey, Zac Purton, will return to Australia during the spring to partner the Ciaron Maher and David Eustace-trained Light Infantry (Fr) (Fast Company {Ire}) in the King Charles II S. and the G1 Cox Plate.\n\n“Light Infantry has come out of three really strong Group 1 races in Europe and not beaten far, and it looks like he’s reaching his peak and should be well suited in Australia weight-for-age races,” Purton told Punters.\n\n“The Cox Plate is one of Australian racing’s majors, so of course, being an Aussie, it’s a race I would love to win. And the King Charles (III), with its new status on Everest Day, is a race I'm looking forward to. I’m still on the hunt for an Everest ride.”\n\nPapillon Club to follow Pinker Pinker’s hoof prints\n\nGreg Eurell is hopeful his talented mare Papillon Club (Toronado {Ire}) can follow in the hoof prints of Eurell’s late star mare Pinker Pinker (Reset).\n\nPapillon Club will start her spring preparation in the G3 Cockram S. and then the G2 Let’s Elope S., as the G1 Cox Plate winner did in 2011.\n\n“It’s big shoes to fill,” Eurell told Racing.com about Papillon Club and Pinker Pinker's comparison.\n\n“Horses do improve, and it’s interesting from preparation to preparation; she’s always been a horse that, as a filly, improved. It will undoubtedly be a giant leap to be heading towards a Cox Plate, but if you’re not in it, you can’t win it.\n\n“Pinker (Pinker Pinker) kicked off in the Cockram, went to the Let’s Elope, the Stocks, went to Sydney and then bounced into the Cox Plate, so it was a good recipe for her and worked.\n\n“If this mare’s heading in the right direction, well, you never know what could happen.”\n\nRainbiel to debut for Pride\n\nWarwick Farm-based trainer Joe Pride will debut the former Victorian-trained Rainbiel (Toronado {Ire}) on Saturday at Randwick.\n\nThe daughter of Toronado (Ire), now in the ownership of Newhaven Park, will look to emulate another daughter of the Swettenham Stud-based stallion in Mariamia, who was acquired by Newhaven Park and sent to Pride to win the G2 Missile S. in the spring and the G1 The Galaxy in the autumn.\n\n“I got Mariamia at a similar time in her career, and that was a dream result as we ended up winning a Group 1,” Pride told Racing.com.\n\n“I am not sure where Rainbiel lies. You can draw some similar parallels there with the two mares, but we will let her tell us that on the track and the beginning of that is Saturday.\n\n“She wasn’t bought to be running in benchmark races, so this is a starting point, and probably the autumn will be her time to shine.”\n\nLane to fly the Australian flag in Korea\n\nAustralian-based jockey Damian Lane will represent Australia at Korea’s international race meeting at Seoul's sand track on September 10.\n\nLane will ride the two Hong Kong representatives from the Pierre Ng stable in the features - Duke Wai (NZ) (Per Incanto {USA}) in the AU$1.63 million Korea Sprint and Apache Pass (War Chant {USA}) in the AU$1.87 million Korea Cup.\n\nThe meeting will attract international participation from America and Japan, as well as the local Korean gallopers.\n\nIt will be the first time Lane has ridden in Korea.\n\nWaller chases Memsie victory\n\nChampion Trainer Chris Waller will be represented by two gallopers in Saturday’s G1 Memsie S. at Caulfield - Osipenko (NZ) (Pierro) and Princess Grace (USA) (Karakontie {Jpn}).\n\nWaller had previously won the Memsie with Boban (Bernardini {USA}), with stablemate Weary (Fr) (Astronomer Royal {USA}) finishing fourth.\n\nPrincess Grace finished runner-up in the G1 Winx S. in Sydney, while Osipenko finished fifth to their stablemate Fangirl (Sebring).\n\nWaller has been pleased with both horses' progress since their first-up runs.\n\n“Osipenko drew wide first-up at Randwick, and he ran home really well,” Waller told RSN.\n\n“I’m hoping he’s still sharp enough second-up for the 1400 metres, but he ran third in the Caulfield Guineas, so he gets around Caulfield well.”\n\nWaller commented on Princess Grace, who is now in her second Australian preparation.\n\n“Her run was good in the Winx Stakes. All her racing in America was left-handed, so Caulfield should be no trouble. It’s a very competitive race, but they’re both in there with good chances.”\n\nChalk Stream looking for more royal success\n\nChalk Stream (GB) (Sea The Stars {Ire}), owned by His Royal Highness King Charles III, will look to provide the monarch with more success in Australia when contesting the Sydney City Lexus CTC Cup over 2400 metres on Saturday.\n\nHis trainer, Chris Waller, who met King Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla during his trip to Royal in June, is hopeful the gelding will provide more thrills this spring.\n\n“It was special, and they’re lovely people,” Waller told RSN.\n\n“Saturday, the 2400 metres is the right distance for Chalk Stream. He’s a hard horse to prepare because he’s not competitive over the shorter trips, so we’ve done our best and I think he’s pretty fit.”\n\nGiavellotto possible for Melbourne Cup\n\nGroup-winning stayer Giavellotto (Ire) (Mastercraftsman {Ire}), who ran third in the 2022 G1 St Leger, is under consideration for the G1 Melbourne Cup in November, trainer Marco Botti revealed.\n\nA winner of York's G2 Yorkshire Cup S. in May, Francesca Franchini's Scuderia La Tesa flagbearer was fifth in the G1 Goodwood Cup S. in early August and improved to take third in the G2 Lonsdale Cup S. back at York later that month. Besides the Race That Stops a Nation, the 4-year-old entire holds entries in the G1 Irish St Leger and the G2 British Champions Long Distance Cup a month later.\n\n“He is in the Irish St Leger, but we thought by then you don't know what the ground will be,” said Botti. “We are still discussing the Melbourne Cup, and I'm pretty sure we will enter him and finalise the plans. Otherwise, in England, Champions Day will just be the only goal left for him.”\n\nHe added, “I would favour going for the Melbourne Cup. He went to Dubai and is a horse who travels well, and I also think the track will suit him–it is similar to York, a left-handed track.\n\n“I think he will get in. He won a Group 2, so he should make the cut for the Melbourne Cup, but then it is up to the owners as it is quite an expensive trip to take on, and as we know, the rules are quite strict before the race. The vetting can be tricky, but he is a sound horse.\n\n“If we take that route, hopefully, all goes to plan, and I would be in favour if the owner wanted to go.”\n\nToo Darn Hot's Bauhinia a New 'TDN Rising Star' In France\n\nGodolphin's G1 Prix Marcel Boussac nominee Bauhinia (Ire) (Too Darn Hot {GB}) justified that lofty entry and earned a 'TDN Rising Star' rosette with a taking debut display in Thursday's Prix de la Cascade at ParisLongchamp.\n\n“She is a very nice filly. She won easily and has plenty of talent,” said winning rider Bauyrzhan Murzabayev.\n\nBauhinia is the sixth foal and scorer thrown by G2 Rockfel S. third Desert Blossom (Ire) (Shamardal {USA}).\n\nToo Darn Hot (GB) is serving at Darley Australia’s Kelvinside base in New South Wales, standing for a fee of $44,000 (inc GST).\n\nCotai Glory's Tiger Belle purrs in Paris\n\nAdo McGuinness trainee Tiger Belle (Ire) (Cotai Glory {GB}) made a stakes breakthrough in July's Listed Marwell S. at Naas and followed up with a career-high in Thursday's G3 Prix d'Arenberg to punch her ticket to the G1 Prix de l'Abbaye back over ParisLongchamp's five-furlong strip on Arc weekend.\n\n“The gate was a huge factor; we wanted to take advantage of that, and she's toughed it out really well,” said assistant trainer Stephen Thorne. “Cristian (Demuro) is a prolific rider here in France. He came highly recommended, and he's done exactly what we've asked him to do. She's a straightforward ride; she's got a lot of gate speed, and we used that to her advantage. She did the job over a stiff five (furlongs) on soft ground in Naas on the last day. She's added another string to her bow, which now opens up more doors for her. We have a huge bunch of owners supporting the filly here today, and we're delighted. It was a big team effort to get her here in good shape. We have to work up the grades and have her entered for the Prix de l'Abbaye. She's not overly big, but she's got a big heart, and we might be back here on Arc weekend.”\n\nRACE in disarray after 21 job losses and jockeys' course scrapped\n\nThe Racing Academy and Centre of Education (RACE), which has produced luminaries of the saddle like Johnny Murtagh, Seamie Heffernan, Chris Hayes and Shane Foley, has been forced to cull two-thirds of its workforce in order to save the institution's future.\n\nA massive 21 of the 31 staff have been told they are no longer needed at RACE, and the decision is understood to have come as a major shock to the workforce.\n\nThe 10-month residential trainee jockey course, which has also been completed by top-notch jump jockeys such as Brian Hughes and Daryl Jacob, has been discontinued and replaced by three courses over shorter periods. In the case of all three new courses, the students will no longer live on the campus, and the courses will no longer have an academic element.\n\nThe restructuring of the facility has been overseen by Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) and comes after accommodation blocks at RACE were closed last month due to safety concerns.\n\nHRI appointed an interim CEO at RACE when such issues arose, and following a strict overhaul, just 10 staff will remain.\n\nRACE is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Still, the future of the esteemed programme will look very different, given students will no longer be based on site, and the traditional jockeys' course has now been scrapped.\n\nFrench sprinter Bouttemont to stand at Rathbarry Stud\n\nFrench-trained sprinter Bouttemont (Ire), acquired by a syndicate headed by Kevin Blake and Jack Cantillon, will retire to Rathbarry Stud at the end of the season. A fee will be announced later.\n\nBouttemont will stand alongside his sire Acclamation (GB) at Rathbarry and bid to enhance his stallion credentials in the Flying Five and Prix de l'Abbaye for trainer Yann Barberot and his new connections.\n\nPaul Cashman of Rathbarry Stud commented, “We have followed Bouttemont's career with great interest with him being a son of Acclamation. He showed just how good he is in the Prix Hampton at Chantilly in June, and we'll all be hoping he can repeat that level of form in the G1 Flying Five S. and the G1 Prix de l'Abbaye before he joins us.\n\n“He is a particularly good-looking horse that is strikingly similar to Acclamation and has the same wonderful temperament as him, so the case for him is a compelling one. We are delighted to partner with Jack and Kevin, who are sure to bring a lot of energy and innovative thinking to the project. Acclamation has been an incredible sire for Rathbarry and our clients over the years, so we are sure that his son Bouttemont will be very warmly received here next year.”\n\nKingscote named retained jockey for Green Team Racing\n\nRichard Kingscote, who won the G1 Derby aboard Desert Crown (GB) (Nathaniel {Ire}) in 2022, will become the new retained jockey for Ahmad Al Shaikh's Green Team Racing.\n\nThe jockey, who will continue his association with trainer Sir Michael Stoute, already celebrated his first victory in the Green Team colours when Sayedaty Sadaty (Ire) (Anodin {Ire}) won a novice at Kempton on Wednesday. Kingscote's other notable wins include the G1 Champion S. aboard Bay Bridge (GB) (New Bay {GB}), as well as the G1 Irish St Leger aboard Brown Panther (GB) (Shirocco {Ger}) and with rising sire star Havana Grey (GB) victorious in the 2018 G1 Flying Five S.\n\n“Green Team Racing are delighted to announce that an agreement has been reached with the star jockey Richard Kingscote to be the team's number one jockey and for him to have Green Team Racing as his first option after his commitments to trainer Sir Michael Stoute,” the organisation said on X/Twitter."
