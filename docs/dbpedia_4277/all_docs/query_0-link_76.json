It is the highest price given anywhere in the world this year for a yearling.\n\n\"You are not going to improve one sold by the best trainer in the world,\" smiled Murphy, who is based in Kentucky, adding, \"but if the horse can retain his level of form, then he should give us some fun.\n\n\"He is adaptable ground-wise and has options through from a mile to 1m2f. He'll have a break now and we will bring him back in the spring.\"\n\nMurphy has been training in the US for around six years now and was able to set himself up in the states after his winning £50 bet on five horses three months before Cheltenham Festival earned him over £1.2 million.\n\nThen Murphy was assistant to Nicky Henderson and the successful horses were:\n\nSprinter Sacre in the Arkle,\n\nSimonsig in the Neptune Investment Novices' Hurdle,\n\nBob's Worth in the RSA Chase,\n\nFinian's Rainbow, whom Murphy looked after, in the Queen Mother Champion Chase.\n\nThe last winner Riverside Theatre, who won the Ryanair Chase, has led to the name Riverside Bloodstock.\n\nThe team subsequently spent 150,000gns on Sabador (Kendargent x Sabadora), sold by Ed Walker Racing.
