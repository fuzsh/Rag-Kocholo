        "text": "Illustration format: 35 x 50 cm (or 13.78 x 19.68 inches) offset printing on high quality paper (Magno Volume 200 g/m²).\n\nThe context:\n\nThis illustration shows the production imageboard, used during pre-production to direct the artwork of the animated series Heidi.\n\nIn context, in the animated series:\n\nThe artist - Ioka Masahiro\n\nIoka Masahiro (井岡雅宏) is the background artist of the animated series Heidi (アルプスの少女ハイジ or Arupusu no Shōjo Haij in its original version, translated as “Heidi girl of the Alps”). He also is credited in other iconic series, such as Anne of Green Gables (1979) and Lupin the Third (1971)\n\nHeidi - The story\n\nA true masterpiece of animation, Heidi (アルプスの少女ハイジ or Arupusu no Shōjo Haij in its original version, or “Heidi girl of the Alps”) was first broadcasted in Japan in 1974. The animated series was adapted from two novels by the Swissh author Johanna Spyri, which were published in 1880 and 1881.\n\nHeidi follows a little orphan girl of the same name, her daily life in the big city of Frankfurt and in the small countryside of the Swiss mountains. In spite of the hardships she has to face, the adventures she goes on with her grandfather, her friends Pierre, Claire, and Blanchette her goat, always showcase Heidi’s strength of character.\n\nThe series was created by the Nippon Animation studio (日本アニメーション株式会社), which also produced Maya the Honey Bee (1975) and Tom Sawyer (1980). Although Heidi recently celebrated its fiftieth birthday, the show remains an absolute must-see, making true history in the landscape of animated series.\n\nHeidi - The fine art print\n\nThis print is published by Riekeles Gallery in collaboration with the artist and Studio 100 International. It is a high-quality reproduction, as faithful as possible to the original work, accurately rendering down to the smallest detail the breathtaking landscapes and backgrounds that helped make the anime from which they are taken internationally successful.\n\nThe care taken with the choice of paper and the printing technique make these posters a real collector's item.\n\nHayao Miyazaki – the character designer\n\nIs it even necessary to introduce Hayao Miyazaki, the legendary co-founder of Studio Ghibli?\n\nBorn in Tokyo in 1941, Hayao Miyazaki is considered one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation. He is best known for The Castle in the Sky (1986), My Neighbour Totoro (1988), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989) and Porco Rosso (1992). But way before the release of these iconic cinematographic pieces, the artist debuted in the Nippon Animation studio. Notably, he worked as a character designer for the animated series Heidi.\n\nClick here to enjoy the original Heidi opening, in Japanese:\n\nShipping"
