        "text": "LONDON/PARIS: Studio 100 has clinched a slot for its hit animated series Maya the Bee with the Irish public broadcaster TG4, while a new magazine partnership has been signed for the U.K. with the publisher Redan.\n\nTG4 has placed Maya the Bee in an 8:15 a.m. slot on the public channel. The Maya the Bee movie is currently out in U.K. cinemas and is coming soon to DVD and digital download.\n\nBrands with Influence Worldwide, the licensing agent representing Studio 100 in the U.K., has secured a new partnership deal with Redan. Maya the Bee will now be published in two of their lead preschool titles, “Fun To Learn Friends” and “Fun To Learn Favourites,” with a combined 280,000 readers in the U.K.\n\nChristophe Drevet, the international consumer products director at Studio 100, commented: “It’s great to see Maya reaching an increasing number of fans across the U.K. with a growing broadcast footprint and licensing proposition. The popularity of Maya and her friends amongst children and their parents reinforces the strong CGI animation and wonderful story lines which have made the brand so popular worldwide for 40 years.”"
