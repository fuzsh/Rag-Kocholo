        "text": "‚Äú‚Ä¶yes here comes Maya the Bee\n\nwith the greatest friends that you‚Äôve ever seen.\n\nyes here comes Maya the Bee\n\nwith her friends and story just for you and me‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nMaya the Bee is character, based on the books written by German author Walderman Bousel and first published back in 1912.\n\nMaya was very popular in ‚Äô70s and ‚Äô80s through animated TV series. She was my favorite cartoon!\n\nLast year Maya was released again by Studio 100 Media and what a wonderful work they‚Äôve done.\n\nAdventurous little bee who left the hive in order to explore the world.\n\nI created crochet Maya for my nieces fourth birthday. She wished for and asked me to make her one (not just Maya‚Ä¶my niece asked for the whole set of movie characters) üòâ\n\nIn two weeks time, which I had to investigate Maya‚Äôs new look (as well as look of her new friends), examine her shape(s) and develop the pattern) I was able to make just Maya and her friend Willy. They both turned out better than I expected they would (despite to lack of materials while making dolls for my little niece).\n\n‚ÄúWow!‚Äù ‚Äì was the only word my niece said after seeing her new dolls. Took both in her arms and since then they became unseparated. They play together, go to kinder garden together, eat together and sleep together.\n\nThis week she ordered Flip (which is the grasshopper, Maya‚Äôs friend; and hornet (son and father) friend (which I am not sure who he is and which role he plays in this, Maya‚Äôs movie). More for me to investigate and work on, but the trouble is worth it! üôÇ\n\nSince I had the pattern done, I feel happy to share it with all of you who wish to make Maya and Willy for your little ones. Please remember that both characters are registered and protected by the law and by any means do not make them for sale. Feel free to use this pattern to make Maya and Willy for you family and friends.\n\nIn this pattern I have written details on everything I‚Äôve done while working on dolls I made for my niece. New Maya has special kind of hair, and that hair is what makes her character so unique. I tried to take as many photos as possible through all the process of hair making so you can make exactly the same one like I did.\n\nhere is collage of some of the photos you will find in the pattern on how to make Maya‚Äôs hair:\n\nSecond of some specialties in this pattern are painted eyes. My dolls have their eyes painted. Knowing that even mentioning painting on crocheted dolls for many of you will cause fear I decided to draw stencils, and lead you through step by step; from preparing your materials, coping to painting. I almost 100% positive anyone can make this. If you have possibility to buy any kind of textile paints in white, green and black and have some fine brushes (or can buy some)‚Ä¶.go for painted eyes. You can make it! Children will love this!\n\nHere are the eyes you can copy (detailed instructions on which size to copy and use them on your crocheted doll‚Äôs head, you‚Äôll find in the pattern)\n\nMaya‚Äôs eyes:\n\nWilly‚Äôs eyes:\n\nAnd here is little collage of photos you will find explained in details inside the pattern:\n\nAt the end what is left are the mouth. I haven‚Äôt sewed them but glued them on the head. For me it always works great! Mouth stay permanently on and are very, very easy to apply (and above all always look great).\n\nAs you can see I have really tried to make it possible for all of you to make exactly the same dolls!\n\nSo far the pattern is on test by several ladies, and so far the only problem they encountered is the way foot are made. I did made few photos and tried to explain it in the pattern, but still waiting for all testers to be done and give me feedback and their suggestions on how to make this foot explanation more simple for everyone. The foot I might to come up with in few days with new post. For now I will share photos and pattern I have made so far.\n\nFoot starts from chain and is done in closed rounds. I call them closed rounds because each you start with chain and close with slip stitch (to chain made at the beginning of the round). The rest of the stitches are worked usual way‚Ä¶just this little start/end is different from continuous work.\n\nLooking at this photo I think you can tell:\n\nMore details and complete 32 page pattern you can find and download HERE\n\nBefore we end, and before I come with some new Maya‚Äôs photo for the ladies who are testing the pattern, leaving you with few photos of my Maya and Willy.\n\nEnjoy the pattern and feel free to write and ask for help if needed. Happy Maya and Willy crochet everyone üôÇ\n\nhugs\n\nVanja"
