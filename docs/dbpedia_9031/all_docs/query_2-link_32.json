        "text": "Studio 100 Film has dropped the first international trailer for Maya the Bee – The Golden Orb on its YouTube channel ahead of the cinematic release of the film later this year and into 2021.\n\nMaya the Bee 3 – The Golden Orb is produced by Studio 100 Media, in co-production with the Australian animation company Studio B Animation and in association with Flying Bark Productions. Munich-based Studio 100 Film is the international sales agency for the worldwide rights.\n\nTo date the movie has been sold to Australia, the US, Canada, Brazil, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Ex-Yugoslavia, CIS Territories and the Baltics, Turkey, Israel, the United Kingdom and South Korea.\n\nTracy Lenon, producer at Studio B Animation, said: “The Australian/German co-production of Maya the Bee – The Golden Orb has provided yet another fantastic opportunity to tell a story with our much-loved, empathetic Maya who bravely accepts the challenge to help others despite being faced with some tricky obstacles.\n\n“Maya’s BFF, Willie, truly shines in this adventure to offer an uplifting, funny tale which will have children and their families laughing out loud. The teams in Australia and Germany have worked incredibly hard to ensure that the loyal Maya audience will be inspired with the highest quality animation of which they have come to expect.”\n\nThorsten Wegener, producer and head of operations at Studio 100 Media, added: “Maya the Bee’s adventures have delighted audiences around the world and this new film will bring old and new characters together in a fun-filled, comedic story which will appeal to younger and older audiences.\n\n“Recent challenges to working life have led to our Australian and German teams staying at home to work remotely while finishing the film. It’s quite extraordinary that all this could be achieved with only a small delay on delivery.”\n\nThe first two theatrical features, Maya the Bee – First Flight and Maya the Bee – The Honey Games, have already been sold to more than 130 countries around the globe. Both have been credited as the most successful German animated film according to the international box office in 2015 and 2018, the dates of their respective release.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNQawiJ6FR8&feature=youtu.be"
