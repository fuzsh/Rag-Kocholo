        "text": "PRESS RELEASE\n\nFlying Bark Productions’ Managing Director, Jim Ballantine yesterday confirmed Screen Australia has selected Maya the Bee as one of six local feature films being invested in by the Federal Government’s funding body for the Australian screen production industry as well as a significant funding investment from Screen NSW.\n\n“I am thrilled to have the support from Screen Australia and Screen NSW on our animated 3D feature film, Maya the Bee which is being co-produced with Studio 100 Media. The Maya the Bee brand has a tremendous global following and is building locally with a series broadcast on ABC4Kids\n\nand DVDs available through Beyond Home Entertainment. Our stereoscopic production will be led by Alexs Stadermann as Director, Barbara Stephen as Producer and Alexia Gates-Foale as Line Producer and will see us employing the services of a large number of highly experienced local creative talents to deliver a globally entertaining feature length animation” said Flying Bark Productions’ Managing Director, Jim Ballantine.\n\nCombining exquisite environments with natural landscapes, Maya the Bee will follow the lovable character’s desire to escape her heavily regimented existence in the hive and experience freedom to explore at her own will.\n\nSet against the backdrop of a longstanding hatred between bees and hornets, Maya is born into a hive where conformity rules. Her funny attempts to fit in and “be a bee” immediately bring her into conflict with the Queen’s Royal Advisor – a narrow minded control freak. When Maya stumbles onto the Advisor’s plot to steal the Queen’s royal jelly and blame it on the hornets, the evil Advisor manipulates Maya into leaving the hive. With her best friend Willi tagging along, Maya buzzes out into the meadow on an exhilarating adventure of self-discovery. Where does she fit in? And how will she find a way to defeat the Royal Advisor and prevent a nasty battle between the bees and hornets?\n\nProduction of the film was announced late last year during a special afternoon reception at Flying Bark Productions for His Royal Highness Prince Philippe of Belgium who was in Australia in the framework of a Belgian Economic Mission.\n\nMaya the Bee will bring together the experience and knowledge of outstanding Australian and European creative talent on the first ever animated feature to be produced as an official treaty co-production between Australia and Germany.\n\nThe original Maya the Bee television series was first produced in the 1970s and was an imaginative blend of fun-filled and thrilling adventures that gained Maya loyal fans from all corners of the globe.\n\nToday a new generation of fans enjoy the tales of Maya the Bee with the 3D HD television series already seen in many European countries as well as on ABC in Australia.\n\nWith an extensive and distinguished legacy as one of Australia's leading entertainment producers, Flying Bark Productions is at the forefront of the animation industry, creating film and television content that delights and captivates pre-school, young adult and family audiences worldwide."
