        "text": "Riviera Maya, Mexico (April 18, 2023) - The AAA Five Diamond Grand Velas Riviera Maya recently debuted a new bee sanctuary, the Meliponario, to\n\nprotect the local Maya Melipona Bee. In addition to preserving the species and facilitating their honey production, the resort now offers an experience for guests to learn more about the species with a new eco-tour and honey tasting.\n\nFor centuries, the Yucatan Peninsula has been home to a large number of the native Melipona stingless bees. Considered by the Mayans as sacred, the Melipona bee uniquely harvests the blooms of plants with medicinal properties. Inspired by the pre-Hispanic beekeeping tradition, Grand Velas Riviera Maya rescues and homes the native stingless bees.\n\nThe new eco-tour begins with a visit to the hotel's organic orchard to learn about the pollination process and the importance of the Melipona bees. Chef Nahum Velasco of the hotel's highly regarded Cocina de Autor restaurant then leads guests through a honey tasting with samples from different parts of the country. The honey and cheese are served alongside Velasco's homemade mead. To commemorate the entire experience, guests are given a take-home bee alebrije and activity book for kids to continue learning about the Melipona bees long after their stay at Grand Velas Riviera Maya. The eco-tour takes place at the resort every Wednesday at 10:00 a.m. and is included in guests' stay at the resort.\n\nReservations are required for the tour. Guests are to contact their concierge to schedule. For reservations or additional information on Grand Velas Riviera Maya, call 1-888-407-4869, or visit https://rivieramaya.grandvelas.com."
