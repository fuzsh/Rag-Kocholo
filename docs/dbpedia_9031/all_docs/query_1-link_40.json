        "text": "Post by nectaria on\n\nHi, I'm new to this forum and I don't know if this thread belongs here, but I do believe that many of you might have not heard of it before, but before the famous 1975 anime series and the 2012 CGI animated series were made, there was a silent documentary film that was filmed with real insects in it and was released in 1926, but this film was lost for decade until some copy of the film (which was not the one that was filmed back in the 1920s) was found in Finland and later in 2005, the material was restored with a new musical score and was released on DVD in 2012. Well, speaking of the DVD itself, I don't know if someone have it, but from what I have seen on the back cover of the DVD, the film seems to be the full version as the duration is approximately 73 or 76 minutes (unfortunately, the picture quality of the back cover is not clear, but that is my guess for it) as some other sites have also listed the duration being the same as in the DVD copy of this film. The problem is that only a few clips were uploaded on both YouTube and Archive.org and it seems to be an ad for the film rather than the actual full film itself which it bothers me since I would like to watch it so badly as I'm a huge fan of Maya the Bee myself and that I have a large collection related to this franchise that even includes some copies of the original book by Waldemar Bonsels (in different languages) which the film is based on and I'm very upset that the DVD copy of this film is hard to get as I'm usually shopping Maya the Bee stuff on ebay and still haven't found a copy of this film that was ever available on this site, but I would still love the full film to be found and uploaded to Archive.org, YouTube or any other sites though.\n\nPost by nectaria on\n\nI used to see Maya The Bee sporadically on NICK back in the day, then found the far superior South African dub on the official Maya YT channel a lot more enjoyable. I was amazed after doing a deep dive that the original Maya The Bee stories are from such a very long time ago. I had heard about the silent film but didn't know that it still existed, great to hear that it's out there.\n\nI'm very glad to hear your opinion on the South African English dub of the anime since this dub is more faithful to the European/German script, while Saban have rewritten the script(s) for the episodes that they have dubbed overall, but yes, thankfully all episodes of the South African English dub are available to watch, but there are some episodes of the American/Saban English dub that have been uploaded to Archive.org that came from some unofficial DVD set, but a few of them have some parts missing and were not fully archived by the person who have recorded them though. Also, I'm very glad to see that this thread got some attention.\n\nPost by darkretro1987 on\n\nI used to see Maya The Bee sporadically on NICK back in the day, then found the far superior South African dub on the official Maya YT channel a lot more enjoyable.

So until 2019 I had only known the Saban version of the series, but yes the South Africa dub is a bit more concise with the story, I would say. I still need to finish watching them all at some time."
