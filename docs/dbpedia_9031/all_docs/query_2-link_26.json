        "text": "Studio 100‘s Maya the Bee is celebrating her 45th TV anniversary in Germany\n\nStudio 100‘s Maya the Bee has conquered the world, growing into a very popular, beloved and successful brand for kids and families in many territories. Now she is celebrating her 45th TV anniversary in Germany. Maya left the beehive for the very first time in 1975 in the classic animation series – a German Japanese co-production. This series premiered on German television in 1976, followed by many other countries.\n\nIn 2013 Studio 100 created the new CGI-animated series, which has sold to more than 170 countries, followed by the first feature film “Maya the Bee – Movie” in 2014. Three years later, a second season with brand-new episodes was launched globally for television. Currently, Maya and her friends are experiencing numerous adventures in 130 exciting episodes. In 2018 a second movie was successfully released internationally. She has her own websites in various languages, YouTube channels, Facebook pages and mobile app.\n\nWorldwide, more than 300 licensees have partnered with Maya, and more than 4,500 different products have been created and distributed. Amongst those licensees are multi-territory partners like Aldi, Arkopharma, jbc as well as local/international partners such as Herding, Ravensburger, Blue Ocean Entertainment, Sony Music, tonies, Stovit, Privatmolkerei Bauer, Pepco and Heunec.\n\nMaya ranks on all the top spots when it comes to brand sympathy, making it an evergreen global property with universal and timeless values. Since 2018 Maya has also acted as a brand ambassador for nature and bee protection. With her project Poppy Meadow, she is currently collaborating with the NABU Germany (Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union) on its insect summer initiative. German retailer REWE has been using Maya the Bee as a brand ambassador for its insect protection campaigns since 2019. And in 2021, Project Poppy Meadow became international: In Poland, Maya supported the nature protection organization OTOP in their insect protection campaign.\n\nMaya the Bee is also an absolute and sparkling star in the Plopsa theme parks, with various indoor attractions in Plopsaland, many Maja attractions at the German Holiday Park as well as her own theme park Majaland Kownaty in Poland.\n\nCurrently, the third movie adventure “Maya the Bee – The Golden Orb” is being released theatrically worldwide, with her 45th birthday being celebrated through to September in Germany with various marketing activities.\n\nMaya the Bee has, therefore all the prerequisites to remain a successful global brand."
