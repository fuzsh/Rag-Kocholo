        "text": "Josef Goehlen (91) is a former ZDF producer who brought cult anime series such as ‘Vicky the Viking’, ‘Maya the Bee’ and ‘Heidi’ to German television through German-Japanese co-productions and licensing deals with Japanese anime studios. He was a key figure in the first wave of anime in Germany. As such, he worked with Isao Takahata, one of the founders of Studio Ghibli, and the influential media makers Leo Kirch and Hans Andresen. Together, these television pioneers developed a business model for working with Japanese companies that was later adopted by other broadcasters. With great attention to detail and a flair for localising content, Goehlen was instrumental in adapting Japanese formats for German audiences and giving them their own unique touch, for example with German theme songs such as “In einem unbekannten Land…” (In an unknown land…). J-BIG talked to Josef Goehlen about the beginnings of German-Japanese co-productions in the 1970s.\n\nJ-BIG: Mr Goehlen, in the early 1970s, you were the first to bring anime to Germany on a large scale through co-productions between ZDF and Japanese studios. How did this come about and how did the first contacts with Japan develop?\n\nJosef Goehlen: I started at WDR in 1960 and soon became an editor for children’s and women’s programmes. Three years later I moved to the smaller Hessischer Rundfunk in Frankfurt to work in the children’s programming department. There I first tried to get the Augsburger Puppenkiste, a German puppet show, a fixed annual slot in the ARD schedule. I succeeded, first with a Sunday morning slot and later for Sundays at noon during the Advent season. This was also thanks to the ‘Jim Knopf’ series, the great success of which had boosted the reputation of Puppenkiste within the ARD. Other Augsburger Puppenkiste productions followed, as well as news programmes and a live-action adaptation of Pippi Longstocking, which I produced in collaboration with Svensk Filmindustri.\n\nMy first contact with Japan came around the same time, in 1964. At the time, the Third Programme was introduced, which was supposed to have a distinctly educational focus. Low-cost productions were sought from all over the world to help achieve this goal. A trip to Japan, commissioned by the broadcaster, was intended to bring back licensed programmes suitable for adaptation by Hessischer Rundfunk. The trip was supposed to last ten days. It turned out to be 14 days, during which I found 1,000 minutes of programmes that, with some editing, could be of interest to German viewers.\n\nThis material was first shown to me on 16mm prints in my hotel room in Tokyo by a 19-year-old student called Tomosuke Suzuki. Suzuki later became a co-producer of my animated series such as ‘Vicky the Viking’ and ‘Maya the Bee’. I still talk to him occasionally.\n\nJ-BIG: Was it difficult to set up such a model with Japanese companies?\n\nJosef Goehlen: It was not easy, but these co-productions were facilitated by the fact that Japanese companies at that time wanted to enter the European market and were therefore open to European content. They had done enough for American companies, and now they wanted to work directly with European companies, especially those that dominated the German television market. The door to Europe, according to the Japanese partners, was to be ‘Heidi’. The Japanese had contacted Beta Film during my active time at Taurus Film between 1970 and 1973 and had their research in ‘Heidiland’ in Switzerland and Frankfurt supervised by us. I met Isao Takahata, the future co-founder of Studio Ghibli and director of ‘Heidi’, during the trip or shortly afterwards in Japan, and although our English was not very good, we were able to communicate with each other in a way that was fruitful for occasional editorial criticism and further collaboration.\n\nJ-BIG: Although it was probably not clear from the start that it would become such a successful model.\n\nJosef Goehlen: The realisation of ‘Vicky the Viking’ was supposed to be the general test. It could not be ‘Heidi’, because production had already started and our influence was only that of the licensee. So ‘Vicky the Viking’ was the key project for our entry into the co-production business. It had its beginnings in the mid-60s.\n\nThe story of the little Viking boy was translated from Swedish into German in 1964, won the German Youth Book Prize in 1965 and landed on my desk at the Hessischer Rundfunk via a representative of the then still existing Herold publishing house. The publisher expected the material to be made into a TV puppet show by the Augsburger Puppenkiste. But I was able to persuade the publisher to wait until I saw a financial opportunity to bring the story to television.\n\nI only saw this opportunity when I became involved with Beta Film and Taurus Film in 1970. Here people expected new ideas that could be offered to the broadcasters, such as WDR. Leo Kirch had been persuaded to take the German-Czechoslovakian series ‘Pan Tau’, co-produced by WDR, into world distribution. However, sales proved difficult, so WDR was offered the opportunity to co-produce ‘Vicky’ as an equal countermove. WDR accepted but demanded editorial control and sent specialists from East Germany and Czechoslovakia to set up a studio in Upper Bavaria. The first takes were to be approved by a certain date, but the deadline came and went with no film to be seen. There was a large model of a ship and two characters, nothing more. The work was terminated and as there were further disputes because of the slow sales of ‘Pan Tau’, the ‘Vicky’ contract was cancelled. Now I had the ‘Vicky’ material back in my drawer, this time at Beta Film. What to do now?\n\nHans Andresen had to help – and he did so by bringing Japanese partners on board. Tomosuke Suzuki did the same at Fuji TV and I talked to ORF and ZDF. I persuaded my friend Alois Schardt, who had just taken over the children’s programme at ZDF, to go to Tokyo, where he could see for himself how design was converging with Western tastes. The basic funding for the co-production model was provided by Leo Kirch and his Beta Film distribution company, even before a contract was signed with a broadcaster. The co-production model proved its worth, and after ‘Vicky the Viking’, other productions were made, as already mentioned.\n\nJ-BIG: Speaking of ‘Captain Future’: This was one of the licensed series that followed ‘Heidi’. In addition to German-Japanese co-productions, licensed Japanese series were the second line of anime formats on ZDF. How did the licensing come about?\n\nJosef Goehlen: Beta Film in Munich was the only German company at the time that had contacts with producers in the USA and an overview of what was happening in TV in the USA and Japan – thanks to open-minded, entrepreneurial people like the aforementioned Hans Andresen and his comrade-in-arms in the USA, Klaus Hallig. The first Japanese anime series, such as Anne of Green Gables and Captain Future, were offered in American versions through the US channels. We adapted them for German and Austrian television.\n\nIt was only when we took over ‘Heidi’ as part of our co-production model that it became possible to acquire licensed programmes directly from Japanese companies. With our dubbing, we were able to adjust some of the dramaturgy to make it more comprehensible to our audience. Cuts and changes were made according to contractual agreements. However, the basic message and design remained the same. Most of the music was also changed to suit German tastes, and some theme songs are still popular today, e.g. “Heidi, Heidi, deine Welt sind die Berge….” composed by Christian Bruhn and sung by Erika and Gitte, “Hey, hey, Wickie” sung by the Stowaways, later the Bläck Föös, or the ‘Maya’ song “In einem unbekannten Land…” composed by Karel Svoboda and sung by Karel Gott. The German instrumental theme song to ‘Captain Future’, composed by Christian Bruhn, is still popular and well-known today. Along with ‘Heidi’, it was the most successful licensed Japanese series, and it was common for schoolchildren to exchange photos of scenes in the school playground.\n\nJ-BIG: After you were no longer responsible for the children’s programme at ZDF, did you continue to pursue the subject of anime – especially the developments in German private television in the 1990s?\n\nJosef Goehlen: After I gave up responsibility for children’s programmes at ZDF, I didn’t really pursue anime programmes anymore. I was responsible for the early evening programme, which was mostly made up of German commissioned productions. I myself took over ‘Alf’ and ‘The Simpsons’ as licences. ‘Alf’ was a success, ‘The Simpsons’ less so at first. They only became bestsellers on Pro7 because the broadcasting environment was more interesting for young viewers. My successors in children’s programming then licensed the Japanese series ‘Sailor Moon’, which was cancelled after only a few episodes and only later found its place on RTL2. I think that the viewers at that time subconsciously realised at the first attempt that this series, which was produced according to the pure laws of manga and anime, didn’t come into the programme with much love and commitment, as it also didn’t have particularly good dubbing.\n\nJ-BIG: How do you feel about today’s children’s programmes and the remakes of your 70s series?"
