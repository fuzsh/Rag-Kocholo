But if they lose, the hive will have to give the Empress all of their summer honey! Needless to say, Maya and Willy’s teammates are neither enthusiastic nor athletic, but Maya remains positive and exclaims that “every bug has a talent!”\n\nCan Maya and Team Poppy win and secure her hive’s future? Only if Maya is able to gain new friends and learn about teamwork, accountability, and overcoming preconceived notions!\n\nDirected by Noel Cleary (Tashi), Sergio Delfino (Chicken Run) and Alexs Stadermann (Maya The Bee Movie, Bambi II), and produced by Studio 100 Media in association with Flying Bark Productions, Maya The Bee 2: The Honey Games features the acclaimed voice talent of Coco Jack Gillies, Richard Roxburgh (Mission: Impossible II), Linda Ngo (Top of the Lake)and Justine Clarke (Home and Away)."
