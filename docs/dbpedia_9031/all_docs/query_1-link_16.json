        "text": "Shout! Factory and Studio 100 Media have expanded their distribution alliance with a new multi-picture deal for Studio 100’s upcoming Maya The Bee feature film series. Under the pact, Shout! Factory has secured North American distribution rights to Maya sequels, including theatrical, VOD, digital, broadcast and home entertainment for cross-platform releases. A strategic rollout of the new films, beginning with Maya The Bee 2 – The Honey Games, is planned from 2017 through Shout! Factory Kids.\n\nThe 2014 animated feature Maya the Bee – Movie was a German-Australian co-production based on the children’s novel and popular TV series. Directed by veteran Disney and Aardman animator Alexs Stadermann, the story follows a little bee on an adventure of self-discovery. Studio 100 Media and Buzz Studios in association with Flying Bark Productions produced with particular box office success in Germany and France. The voice cast included Coco Jack Gillies, Jacki Weaver, Miriam Margolyes, Richard Roxburgh, Noah Taylor, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Justine Clarke. Shout! Factory had North American rights to the first picture which it released straight to DVD and Blu-ray in 2015."
