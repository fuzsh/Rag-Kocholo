Factory Kids.\n\n“We’re incredibly excited and honored that Studio 100 has chosen to partner with Shout! Factory on Maya the Bee film series.

Since then it has been translated to many languages for airings in other countries. An updated CGI version returned to its fictional roots by animation production company Studio 100 in 2012. This series run lasted for 78 episodes and a film followed afterwards. Both are based on the book of the same name by German children’s author, Waldemar Bonsels.\n\nContinue reading “Maya the Bee Movie Buzzes into North America 2015!”"
