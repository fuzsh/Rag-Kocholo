Having collected all the honey around the honeycomb, Maya decides to set out on an adventure to find a flower garden in order to collect more honey for the hive. Her intentions are noble, but because she leaves the hive without permission, the Queen sends Maya’s friend Willy to search for the little troublemaker. Willy joins Maya in her quest, and together, the two friends marvel at the sheer beauty that nature has to offer.\n\nBased on the novel “Maya the Bee” by Waldemar Bonsels"
