        "text": "Maya the Bee\n\nSynopsis of Saturday Morning Show\n\n“Who’s a friendly little bee, playing oh-so happily?”\n\nWaldemar Bonsal’s The Adventures of Maya the Bee stories taught lessons on friendship and caring, as experienced by a group of insect friends. Australian animation company Apollo Film brought Maya and friends to animated life in a series of Maya the Bee cartoons, broadcast stateside on Nickelodeon in the early 1990’s.\n\nMaya was a plucky female bee with a protective instinct. Predators sometimes threatened, but Maya was always there for her insect friends, including trouble-prone Willi the bee and musician Flip the grasshopper. Bonsal’s life lessons remained intact, making the show a hit with kids and parents alike.\n\nFifty-five episodes of Maya the Bee were produced by Apollo Film, all of which aired over the show’s two-year run on Nick.\n\n“See her flying through the air, buzzing here and buzzing there.\n\nSaying catch me if you dare, busy buzzing everywhere.\n\nMaaaaaya…Maya the Bee…”\n\nRelease History\n\n1/1/90 - 12/31/92 Nickelodeon\n\nTV Sub Categories\n\nanimated\n\nTV Studio\n\nApollo Film, Saban\n\nTelevision Cast\n\nMaya Pauline Little\n\nWilli Richard Dumont\n\nFlip R.J. Henderson\n\nGrimelda Anna MacCormack\n\nCassandra Jane Woods\n\nOther Saturday Morning Links"
