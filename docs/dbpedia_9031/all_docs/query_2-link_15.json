        "text": "Studio 100 Film has launched the international trailer for the Maya the Bee—The Golden Orb movie on its YouTube channel.\n\nIn the new feature, the headstrong little bee Maya and her best friend Willi rescue an ant princess. They then find themselves in the middle of an epic bug battle that will take them to strange new worlds and test their friendship. Maya the Bee—The Golden Orb is slated to be released in cinemas in 2020 and 2021.\n\nMaya the Bee—The Golden Orb is produced by Studio 100 Media, in co-production with Australian animation company Studio B Animation and in association with Flying Bark Productions. Munich-based Studio 100 Film is the international sales agency for the movie’s worldwide rights. The movie has already been sold into Australia, the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Ex-Yugoslavia, CIS Territories and the Baltics, Turkey, Israel, the U.K. and South Korea.\n\nMaya the Bee—First Flight and Maya the Bee—The Honey Games, the first two theatrical features in the franchise, were sold to more than 130 countries around the globe.\n\nTracy Lenon, producer at Studio B Animation, said: “The Australian/German co-production of Maya the Bee—The Golden Orb has provided yet another fantastic opportunity to tell a story with our much-loved, empathetic Maya who bravely accepts the challenge to help others despite being faced with some tricky obstacles. Maya’s BFF, Willie, truly shines in this adventure to offer an uplifting, funny tale that will have children and their families laughing out loud. The teams in Australia and Germany have worked incredibly hard to ensure that the loyal Maya audience will be inspired by the highest quality animation of which they have come to expect.”\n\nThorsten Wegener, producer and head of operations at Studio 100 Media, said: “Maya the Bee’s adventures have delighted audiences around the world and this new film will bring old and new characters together in a fun-filled, comedic story which will appeal to younger and older audiences. Recent challenges to working life have led to our Australian and German teams staying at home to work remotely while finishing the film. It’s quite extraordinary that all this could be achieved with only a small delay on delivery.”"
