VIS-iTV, the interactive television development studio created as a joint venture between VIS Entertainment and Flextech Television, has announced that its iRace title is to debut on UK satellite television.

The game, a virtual horse racing simulator, will be supplied non-exclusively to the UK's newest satellite sports channel, iSports TV, for the purpose of fixed odds betting on the channel.

"Virtual horseracing is a proven success in the betting world," explained Damian Cope, managing director of The Gaming Channel, which operates iSports TV, "and we have now become the first television channel to launch the product in the UK. In VIS iTV we have found the ideal partner with the highest quality product, perfectly complementing iSports TVÃ¢s existing sports and interactive gaming content."

"Being the first to launch virtual horseracing on UK TV is a major achievement for the company," commented VIS iTV chief executive Simon Grieve. It's expected that the iRace game will also be rolled out over digital cable networks shortly.
