You will then complete cinematic moments, orthographic drawings, and texture/ material callouts.\n\nVisual Development for Live Action\n\nIn this advanced course, we will teach you the concepts for organic and hard surface assets. You will generate thumbnail drawings and complete clean line drawings and value/color studies before executing a final 2D or 3D concept image. Strong sketching, drawing and painting skills, as well as an understanding of color, light, and perspective will be required.\n\nVisual Development for Web & Mobile Gaming\n\nYou will create functional game-ready assets formatted and optimized for mobile and Web platforms. We will cover character design for games, graphic optimization, vector tools, and other industry standards so you may deliver a complete game environment featuring user interface and marketing elements."
