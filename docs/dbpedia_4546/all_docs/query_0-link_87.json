        "text": "Archaeology’s association with media and video games has never been satisfying for most archaeologists. This may go back to the fact that figures like Indiana Jones or Lara Croft had developed “the idea that archaeologists slash through jungles and prowl through caves searching for golden idols, precious work of ancient art, and magical charms.” (Orser, 2015, p. 133). The obscured expectations on the work of an archaeologist that are presented to the public may be one issue. Another aspect that has been always discussed by archaeologists and historians as well is the accuracy of the content that is presented in digital games; to which extent can the past be generalised, what are the repercussions or does it even matter? (Chapman, 2016. Reinhard, 2018). The visualisation of past realities in which nowadays people can immerse in became “increasingly significant in tourism, entertainment and education” (Holtorf, 2017 p. 3). Hence video games like the Civilization series or the Assassin’s Creed series have been trying to offer past experiences to a growing community of players. These games do not just let players immerse into historical events but they also visualise a material past based on archaeological evidence. The representations and reconstructions of material heritage have huge implications for our society and its collective memory as most children grow up playing video games already in an early age. The direction in which the archaeological framework develops has been always influenced by socio-cultural realities (Trigger, 2006) and therefore it has been only natural that many scholars like Angus A. Mol and Andrew Reinhard had been discovering the conjunctions between archaeological science and video games since recent years. While Reinhard tried to explore how to apply archaeological methodology on digital games (Reinhard, 2018), Mol has investigated on how video games could be used for didactic purposes in the context of heritage and archaeology (Mol et al., 2017). However, an aspect that has been not much studied was the role of video games as part of public archaeology and how archaeologists can actively participate in the visualisation of past realities for the public. A cooperation between archaeologists and the gaming industry could have immense benefits for both sides.\n\nThis paper explores an idea for creating an informal and easily approachable media platform to promote archaeological sites that are inaccessible and lesser known to the public in the form of an educational game. This game will create an illusion of a real archaeological site visit, allowing players direct contact with its environment and surroundings as well as interaction with its ancient and contemporary inhabitants. In an era of international connectivity, globalization, and social networking, it seems appropriate to choose the online computer and mobile gaming industries as media for spreading the interest in heritage and archaeology.

This chapter discusses how these popular entertainment products provide playful and fun experiences of the past-something we refer to here as past-play for the sake of brevity. The video game industry has become a major, fast-moving player when it comes to creating, innovating, and distributing virtual representations of the past (Champion 2015). The study of such playful video game-based products as examples of virtual heritage is part of a growing field, called archaeogaming. Archaeogaming can be generally defined as 'the archaeology of digital games' , with roots in a diverse set of analogue and digital archaeological themes and tools (Reinhard 2018). It also draws in a variety of tools and thinking from game studies, game user research, and computer sciences. Archaeogaming is also a movement born in and out of playful, digital scholarship that studies popular, digital culture but itself also seeks to be part of popular, digital culture (Politopoulos et al. 2019a).\n\nThis paper investigates how digital media and screen-based navigation can be utilised to provide engagement with prehistory. In light of the importance of material remains and the increased pressure of tourism, it is important to find creative solutions to physical visitation that continue to provide meaningful experiences for visitors. Rather than revisiting the more familiar questions of digital preservation and conservation, the paper explores how computer game techniques can be applied to create compelling cultural experiences. Rethinking digital interaction for cultural heritage is located in the architecture of Mnajdra, a Maltese Megalithic temple and recent work by game researchers and archaeologists. Focusing on the spatial structure of the oldest freestanding monument the paper proposes that the role of spatial navigation and praxis is central to an embodied understanding of the past. It extends on the phenomenologically inspired investigations on the Mnajdra temple by Chri...\n\nThis book explains how designing, playing and modifying computer games, and understanding the theory behind them, can strengthen the area of digital humanities. This book aims to help digital humanities scholars understand both the issues and also advantages of game design, as well as encouraging them to extend the field of computer game studies, particularly in their teaching and research in the field of virtual heritage. By looking at re-occurring issues in the design, playtesting and interface of serious games and game-based learning for cultural heritage and interactive history, this book highlights the importance of visualisation and self-learning in game studies and how this can intersect with digital humanities. It also asks whether such theoretical concepts can be applied to practical learning situations. It will be of particular interest to those who wish to investigate how games and virtual environments can be used in teaching and research to critique issues and topics in the humanities, particularly in virtual heritage and interactive history.

Digital archaeological reconstruction has been concerned with exact replication of facts rather than with understanding, for the latter raises the annoying dilemma of how to present scientific uncertainty. A computer model almost invariably implies certitude, and archaeologists are still not sure how to convey the murky battle of historical interpretation. Yet games are quite happy to allow users to ‘muddy’ historical settings. And while the bulk of computer game design may be justly considered a-cultural or even anti-cultural, the underlying techniques of engaging interactively with the audience offer new ways of increasing the popularity and immersive learning of virtual environments. However there are some serious issues in heritage projects adopting a game-style approach. Would using interactive game techniques and technologies create a more engaging user experience? If we can animate the past in this way, will the entertainment factor help or impede learning, and how will we know how effective the interactivity is? And would our results help bridge the gap between the industry (be it virtual exhibitions or interactive game design) and academia?"
