        "text": "How do I become a previs artist?\n\nTo become a previs artist you need to understand the VFX production pipeline and have a high level of skill in using 3D software. You might progress to this role by first becoming an assistant technical director. Or you might go the route of becoming an environment artist and later transferring your skills to previs.

They’re a great opportunity to earn while you learn. NextGen Skills Academy offer VFX apprenticeships for school leavers.

Go to how to become an apprentice to learn how to find apprenticeships in your region or approach companies directly.\n\nBuild a portfolio:\n\nLearn how to use, and then experiment with, VFX programs and create a showreel that you can show to admissions tutors or employers. This is essential. Go to build your VFX portfolio to learn how. Watch ScreenSkills’ advice on VFX showreels. It’s really important to develop your appreciation for VFX. Make sure you’re familiar with what’s out there.\n\nGet a degree:\n\nHave a look at ScreenSkills’ list of recommended courses in VFX and select one in computer science, computer animation, maths, IT, art and design or another VFX-related subject.

Meet professionals and ask them questions about their work, while demonstrating interest and knowledge in the sector. Offer to provide them with your professional contact details and try to stay in touch with them. Go to how to network well to learn how to do this.\n\nSearch for jobs:\n\nResearch VFX companies that you’d like to work for. Go to their websites and check if they are advertising for junior roles the art or pre-production departments. Search job websites and apply for positions.
