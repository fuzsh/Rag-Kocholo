When you have applied to us, you’ll be told about any new developments through Student View.\n\nPlacement year\n\nYou have the option of a year’s paid placement after your second year. Going on a placement builds confidence, can help you decide what how you want to specialise in your final year and strengthens your CV.\n\nOur students have been on placement with organisations including Unity Technologies, Glyndebourne, Ash Gaming, and the BBC.\n\nWhat's included\n\nYou may have to pay additional costs during your studies. The cost of optional activities is not included in your tuition fee and you will need to meet this cost in addition to your fees. A summary of the costs that are included and any extras that you may be expected to pay while studying a course in the School of Architecture, Technology and Engineering in the 2022–23 academic year are listed here.\n\nTravel and accommodation costs are included for all mandatory taught residential field trips, but you’ll need to provide your own food and drink.\n\nThere will be opportunities to attend additional study trips or optional taught residential field trips throughout the school, but these are not required to pass your course. Normally, a contribution will be required towards expenses such as travel, entrance fees and accommodation. This will vary depending on where and how long the trip is, but you should budget around £1,500.\n\nWhere optional international field trips are offered, these are not required to pass your course. You should expect to budget £300–£500 for these, to cover flight, accommodation, food and entrance to museums. The total amount spent would be based on location and number of trips taken.\n\nIf you choose to take an optional paid placement, you’ll be expected to cover your own travel, accommodation, food and drink.\n\nSome students require specialist outdoor equipment and/or personal protective equipment (PPE) and should budget up to £150.\n\nYou will have access to computers and necessary software; however, many students choose to buy their own hardware, software and accessories. The amount spent will depend on your individual choices, but this expenditure is not essential to pass any of our courses. Find out what free software is available from the University of Brighton.\n\nCourse books are available from the university, but you may wish to budget from £15 to £100 per year to buy your own copies and subscribe to design magazines.\n\nIn most cases coursework submissions are electronic but students may wish to print notes which would involve an extra cost.\n\nCosts of up to £50 are included in the fees for students on engineering courses to pay for materials for their final year projects. On rare occasions where material costs exceed £50, they will need to be paid for by the student.\n\nArchitecture, interior architecture, design and product design additional costs\n\nStudents should budget around £25 for printing and binding dissertations in their final year.\n\nIn your first year of studies, you will need to buy a drawing and modelling toolkit. Each course will suggest a list of items of which some will be essential, and others optional. You should budget around £100–£250 for these.\n\nFor most courses you will need to budget between £100 to £300 per year for printing and portfolio costs. Costs will vary depending on type of printer and type and size of paper used. Some students tend to work digitally, spending more on printing and some by hand, spending more on materials so these costs vary widely between students.\n\nFor most courses you will need to budget between £10 and £100 for material costs per design project. Costs will vary depending on how and what you use to make models. You are encouraged to recycle used materials where possible.\n\nYou will need to budget between £5–£50 to exhibit work for the end-of-year show. Fundraising by the student society, BIAAS, normally helps towards this cost.\n\nYou can chat with our enquiries team if you have a question or need more information.
