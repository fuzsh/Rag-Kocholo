        "text": "1 person found this review helpful\n\n0\n\nRecommended\n\n80.6 hrs on record\n\nLoving the game so far, good story, nice graphics, and fun gameplay.\n\nI'm playing on the standard difficulty\n\nAlthough they don't ruin the game for me there are some issues that irk me or make things annoying.\n\nBodies aren't detected by enemies (not sure if there is a difficulty option that changes this), which makes stealthing through missions 10x easier but feels cheesy when you can kill an enemy and have their body walk over their corpse and only be alerted for 6 seconds before going back on his patrol route.\n\nThe pause system can be a little annoying because some events will auto-pause for you like when your troops reach a point of interest or when you reach a station but won't pause for other things like when an upgrade is finished or when squads get back to the train, so you'll be having to watch several different things and be prepared to hammer the pause button but be careful you don't hit it before an auto-pause happens and you acidentlly lurch yourself forward a few more hours. There should be an option to select when the game auto-pauses because it should default to auto pausing at any event.\n\nSome train operations should be handled automatically but aren't. The hospital car doesn't automatically put sick or injured soldiers in the hospital beds, this has lead me to many times not realsing that I have several soldiers not healing up. There isn't a filter option for idle soldiers, you always need to scroll around to find an idle soldier. Also the drivers and stokers should be made avaliable for work when the train is stopped and automatically go back to their positions when the train is put into motion again.\n\nWhile none of these issues ruin the game for me, fixing them would enhance my experience\n\n3 people found this review helpful\n\n0\n\nNot Recommended\n\n3.2 hrs on record\n\nProduct refunded\n\nWithout writing an essay, this game feels like a beta. AI, combat, management, and many other aspects all seem half baked. You have to fight the menus to organise your men, manually moving people around and reassigning them far more than you should have to. Combat is super lackluster, and no one can hit the broad side of a barn. When they do manage to land a shot, the target just tanks it. I don't know what's expected when you're fighting wolves, because you can't really shoot on the run, and your characters just stand there and get mauled to death, so you end up swapping out who's taking the damage since they can't act on their own. Again, everything looks and feels very wooden. Each firearm is locked into specific roles, so you can't just hand them out freely, which seems wrong for the type of game this tries to be. You can't rename the train cars to organise things to your liking, like having a better labelled infantry cart just for the squads.\n\nDon't get me wrong; the game seems fine enough, but it's these small things and many others that turn me off and make it hard to recommend. If the game goes on sale for 75% off or more, maybe it's worth it if you don't mind looking past the imperfections."
