        "text": "This is the main section of Unseen64, our precious archive of videogames we’ll never be able to play (at least until they could be leaked!). When a game is created, it goes trough many development stages: it starts from an idea or concept, they create a playable version (often known as “alpha or beta version”) and if everything goes fine, the game keeps being developed and is finally published, so we can enjoy it.\n\nBut… why was the game different in its beta phase? What happens when a game is cancelled?\n\nBeta games are not the same as the ones you’ve played. Cancelled games are lost. Gaming Philology (originated from classical philology) is the study of videogames, their early development and their unseen history. Here on Unseen64 you can find an archive with info, screens and videos to preserve the most interesting cuts and changes in videogames till the seventh generation of consoles.\n\nWe remember these unseen games for curiosity, historic and artistic preservation.\n\nFind your favorite game you’ll never play\n\nYou can use the following filter to search for unseen games planned for a specific console / PC, genre of game, publisher or development studios. You can choose one option or a mix between the two: keep in mind that not every combination has a result (for example “N64 games by Nintendo” will probably have some results, while “N64 games by Sony” will probably be an empty search).\n\nConsoles / PC\n\nGenres & Developers\n\nTo see a complete list of the most popular beta and cancelled videogames currently archived on Unseen64, choose your favorite retro console or PC from the list below.\n\nComplete list of beta & cancelled games:\n\nNINTENDO\n\nNES\n\nSNES\n\nNintendo 64 – DD\n\nGameCube\n\nWii\n\nGame Boy\n\nGBA\n\nVirtual Boy\n\nNintendo DS\n\nNintendo 3DS\n\nWiiU\n\nSONY\n\nPlaystation\n\nPlaystation 2\n\nPlaystation 3\n\nPSP\n\nPSVita\n\nMICROSOFT\n\nXbox\n\nXbox 360\n\nSEGA\n\nMaster System\n\nMegaDrive/Genesis\n\nSaturn\n\nDreamcast\n\n32X / Mega CD\n\nGame Gear\n\nOTHERS\n\nM2 / 3DO\n\nPhilips CDI\n\nPC\n\nNuon\n\nGame.com\n\nArcade\n\nPC Engine / FX\n\nJaguar\n\nGizmondo\n\nWonderswan\n\nHasbro VR\n\nN-Gage\n\nNeo-Geo Pocket\n\nBrowse our archive by developers or genres:\n\nIf you prefer, you can also check all the unseen games from your favorite developers or gaming genre, here is a list of a few ones from the most popular. You can also search your favorite gaming series from the search field in the right menù, for example for all the proto and unreleased games in the Zelda, Metal Gear Solid, Halo, Crash Bandicoot, Metroid, Banjo, God of War, Monster Hunter or Half Life series.\n\nDevelopers:\n\n3D Realms\n\nAcclaim\n\nActivision\n\nAlphadream\n\nArgonaut Games\n\nDigital Anvil\n\nFactor 5\n\nFASA Studio\n\nRareWare (Rare Ltd)\n\nCapcom\n\nKonami\n\nSquareSoft\n\nSquare-Enix\n\nMidway\n\nElectronic Arts\n\nUbisoft\n\nNamco\n\nSonic Team\n\nTeam 17\n\nPsygnosis\n\nTHQ\n\nValve\n\nDarkworks\n\nInsomniac Games\n\nSilicon Knights\n\nRetro Studios\n\nLionhead Studios\n\nGenres:\n\nAction Game\n\nAction Adventure\n\nAction RPG\n\nPlatform\n\nFPS\n\nThird Person Shooter\n\nRPG\n\nSRPG\n\nRacing Games\n\nShoot ’em up\n\nFighting Games\n\nSurvival Horror\n\nRTS\n\nBeat ’em up\n\nSandbox\n\nMMORPG\n\nPoint & click Adventure\n\nHack & Slash\n\nSport\n\nPuzzle Games\n\nSimulation\n\nStealth Games\n\nMusic Games\n\nWhat you can find in our archive:\n\nBeta versions are not the only ones with interesting differences (and in theory beta games should have most of their final features and assets), but “beta” is usually the most known of all the different stages of development from a videogame and it’s what people usually search on Google when they want to find “videogames in early stages of development with many differences from their final versions”. It’s like when you are late with your assignments and search for someone else who can “do my computer science homework“: a simple concept to summarize what you are looking for.\n\nSo it’s easier to talk about “beta” to indicate those particular dissimilarity between final and still-in-development videogames, but in this archive you can find games with all kind of different stages of development: concept art, design documents, pitch presentations, prototypes, alphas, betas, demos.. and if a game never reaches its “gold master” stage and it’s never released in shops, then it could have been cancelled.\n\nYou should know what “cancelled” means, the game remains officially unreleased and in most cases, we will never play it.\n\nSometimes “beta” and even “cancelled” games are leaked online by collectors or former developers, and this means that people are able to play and preserve them so that they will not be lost forever. It’s a risky topic, because sometimes those games, even if never released, are still under copyright laws and publishers could not be happy if their “property” is shared without their consensus (while sometimes those leaked games are so old or obscure that no-one cares anymore about them).\n\nIn our humble opinion if a game was cancelled, to share it online should not be considered “piracy” because it would have never been sold anyway, but it’s a complex issue that goes through intellectual properties, business men and marketing strategies.. and a final judgment about this is not simple.\n\nIn any case, on Unseen 64 there are not roms or direct link to download games, just links to other websites where you could find them: we need to stay as clean as possible to be able to keep the site online and to keep saving more documents of these unseen games.\n\nJust enjoy this archive and keep dreaming about how awesome those unseen games could have been!\n\nLatest unseen games news:\n\nFollow our twitter account for daily updates and news about lost videogames:\n\nTweets by Unseen64\n\nHow you can help\n\nThere are many ways to help us to preserve screenshots, videos and information about unreleased and beta videogames, please check our “how to help Unseen 64” page to know how YOU, yes, even you can help to save lost videogames!"
