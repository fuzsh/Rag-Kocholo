        "text": "Many companies in existence—even big-name startups—once had to create a pitch deck at the beginning of their journey. Thanks to the internet, we can access and study all those successful pitch decks for a healthy dose of inspiration.\n\nSome of these investor pitch deck examples have become quite famous, like the Airbnb pitch deck from when the company was still called AirBed&Breakfast.\n\nIn this article, we’ve put together the 35 best pitch decks to learn from. We've also recreated some of those pitch decks into templates to help you attract investors and support for your own company.\n\nIf you're ready to create your own pitch deck, use our presentation software to put together a professional investor presentation in minutes.\n\nHere's a short selection of 8 easy-to-edit pitch deck templates you can edit, share and download with Visme. View 23 more templates below:\n\nWhat Makes a Good Pitch Deck?\n\nBefore we launch into 35 of the best pitch decks of all time, let’s talk about what makes a good pitch deck. What’s going to grab investor attention and help propel your business toward the same success that companies like Airbnb, WeWork, Uber and Facebook have all seen?\n\nLet’s dig into a few of the major components to keep in mind when designing a pitch deck.\n\nUse the right slides. There are 10 key slides every pitch deck should have, including an introduction, problem/solution, business model, statistics, etc. Flesh out a proper pitch deck outline before you get started pulling necessary information.\n\nTell a story. One of the best ways to capture your audience is through a compelling story. Make sure you’re really selling your business idea by elaborating on why people are going to want or need it.\n\nBe passionate about your idea. No one wants to listen to someone half-heartedly pitch a business idea. You need to believe in it and make your audience believe in it, too.\n\nProofread and practice. Nothing is going to make you seem less professional than typos and a million “ums” during your speech. Review your slides and rehearse them to make sure you’re ready to present.\n\nPay attention to design. Old, boring, bulleted PowerPoints won’t get you anywhere anymore. With access to beautiful and simple templates and tools (*ahem* Visme *ahem*) it’s never been easier to create beautiful and creative pitch decks.\n\nFor even more tips on your pitch deck design, watch this video:\n\nIf you need help creating attention-grabbing pitch decks, you can use the versions recreated in Visme as a starting point. Better yet, allow Visme's AI presentation maker to do the heavy lifting for you—it handles everything from design to content, speeding up your pitch deck design process.\n\nWith just a text prompt, this advanced tool helps you generate pitch deck presentations complete with images, icons, illustrations, text, and everything else—in just seconds.\n\nFor example, you can draw inspiration from any of these pitch deck examples and instruct the AI presentation maker to generate a similar pitch deck design tailored to your business and topic of choice. Isn't that amazing?\n\nClick on a Pitch Deck to Jump Ahead\n\nDropbox Pitch Deck\n\nTinder Pitch Deck\n\nAirbnb Pitch Deck\n\nWeWork Pitch Deck\n\nUber Pitch Deck\n\nBuzzFeed Pitch Deck\n\nLaunchrock Pitch Deck\n\nFoursquare Pitch Deck\n\nIntercom Pitch Deck\n\nMattermark Pitch Deck\n\nTouristEye Pitch Deck\n\nBuffer Pitch Deck\n\nOoomf (Crew) Pitch Deck\n\nMoz Pitch Deck\n\nBiogrify Pitch Deck\n\nFront Pitch Deck\n\nPiccsy Pitch Deck\n\nLinkedIn Pitch Deck\n\nFyre Festival Pitch Deck\n\nManpacks Pitch Deck\n\nCoinbase Pitch Deck\n\nSnapchat Pitch Deck\n\nYouTube Pitch Deck\n\nFacebook Pitch Deck\n\nCrunchbase Pitch Deck\n\nContently Pitch Deck\n\nWise (TransferWise) Pitch Deck\n\nBliss Pitch Deck\n\nCastle Pitch Deck\n\nShift Pitch Deck\n\nCubeit Pitch Deck\n\nRevolut Pitch Deck\n\nAlto Pitch Deck\n\nWayfair Pitch Deck\n\nWalmart - Flipkart Pitch Deck\n\n1. Dropbox Pitch Deck\n\nDropbox is one of the pioneers of cloud storage as we know it today, and their pitch deck from 2007 was all about revolutionizing the way people stored and shared important data.\n\nThe company has raised around $1.7 billion in funding and is backed by popular investors like JP Morgan and Sequoia Capital.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nWhat makes Dropbox's pitch deck stand out among others is how it addresses the “why” behind the entire idea of cloud storage.\n\nAs you go through the slides, you’ll notice how each section focuses on how Dropbox’s solution will benefit users and the society as a whole by changing the way people work with files.\n\nThis slide deck inspiration also dives into the details of why investing in the company is a good idea at that particular time, making a strong case for securing the funding they need.\n\nKey Takeaway: Draw a comparison with your competitors to show how your product is better. Focus on the features, but then follow up with benefits to explain why those features are worth investing in.\n\nIt's also a good idea to explain why the timing is ideal for launching your product or company. Dropbox does this well by highlighting trends that are relevant to their target audience, such as the increased use of digital devices and more distributed/remote teams.\n\nHere's an investor pitch deck template that comes built-in with a comparison table, data widgets, charts and a benefits slide. Customize it to create a value-focused pitch deck like Dropbox.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n2. Tinder Pitch Deck\n\nPreviously known as Matchbox, Tinder is one of the most popular dating apps in the world.\n\nWhile Tinder's pitch deck below is not officially connected to any funding round, the app managed to raise over $50 million in just three rounds.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nSo, what is it about this that makes it such a great pitch deck inspiration?\n\nFirst, they do an excellent job of communicating the problem with a short (but relatable) story. Then, instead of talking about the solution, they show it within their app.\n\nThe next few slides dive deeper into the app’s functionality — how it works and what value it provides. By using step-by-step screenshots, they let their app do the talking.\n\nFinally, the pitch deck summarizes additional features being developed and the revenue opportunity, or how they plan to make money, in two short slides.\n\nKey Takeaway: Using storytelling to explain a problem can make it relatable and easier to understand. A good pitch deck puts investors in the customers’ shoes, which naturally makes them more intrigued to learn about the solution.\n\nAnother lesson to be learned here is to use your product’s functionality to explain the solution. Tinder does a great job of showing instead of telling with step-by-step screenshots of how users will navigate through the app to fulfill their needs.\n\nCustomize this business pitch deck template below designed especially for apps and SaaS businesses, and apply your own storytelling principles:\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n3. Airbnb Pitch Deck\n\nSome of the best investor decks present information in a quickly-digestible, easily-understandable way. This is where an early pitch deck by Airbnb shines.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nAirbnb’s pitch deck is commonly cited as one of the best, and has helped raise over $112 million.\n\nEach slide is relatively basic, presenting the information quickly and efficiently. They also avoid the pitfalls of sticking simply to text, adding images and charts throughout that illustrate their points in a similar manner.\n\nKey Takeaway: You don’t want to bore your audience, but you also want them to know exactly what your product or service is trying to do. Airbnb's modern pitch deck design exemplifies simplicity at its finest.\n\nHere’s a pitch deck template inspired by Airbnb to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\nThe Visme editor comes equipped with several AI features, like the AI Presentation Maker, which helps you craft a fully designed pitch deck from start to finish, including content and visual graphics. Additionally, the AI Writer can help you refine content in several ways, like summarizing longer text or refreshing older content.\n\nUse the prompt window to explain what you need and watch the tool unleash its magic.\n\n4. WeWork Pitch Deck\n\nIn the WeWork Pitch Deck Series D, they show projected growth in big numbers. They used the power of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) to really bring the message home to investors.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nBy providing big-name services to their members through an affiliate scheme, they were able to add the logos of all these companies in their company deck and show who they were already working with.\n\nNot only did they get tons of funding with this pitch deck, they're now one of the biggest coworking space providers in the world. They knew the potential of WeWork and were definitely not afraid to show it.\n\nKey Takeaway: If you know your idea has the potential to be huge, show it. WeWork knew they had a sound business plan that was bound to grow with the right amount of support. They didn’t take any shortcuts and used visual charts to show huge projections and big plans.\n\nHere’s a business pitch template inspired by WeWork to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n5. Uber Pitch Deck\n\nWhen Uber first started out, it was called UberCab.\n\nThe idea behind the business seemed like something right out of a fairy tale; cabs that would pick you up in minutes, which you didn’t have to call or stand on the curb for.\n\nEven though their initial ideas did not exactly represent how Uber is today, their original pitch deck is a great example of believing in a product.\n\nThis professional pitch deck goes into detail about how UberCab could ultimately change the way taxis work, forever.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nThe actual slides from this business deck rely heavily on bullet points to get the message across, but they hit home because they are simple and short-winded. The bullet points are more like matter-of-fact statements instead of long explanations.\n\nYou can tell that the founders knew they had a great idea and all they needed was the investors to see it the way they did. They had no charts because they were still a small enterprise and had no growth to show.\n\nThey were relying on a simple fact: their idea was a game changer.\n\nKey Takeaway: Even if all you have is a great idea, strongly believing in that idea can help you get the funding you need to turn it into a reality. Forget fancy charts and long explanations — the best pitch deck designs keep it simple and get to the point quickly.\n\nHere’s a pitch deck template inspired by Uber to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n6. BuzzFeed Pitch Deck\n\nWhen BuzzFeed was small, with only five people in a tiny office in Chinatown, they knew they had to stand out from the crowd to get ahead. So, instead of just being one amongst the pack, they created their own pack.\n\nThey visualized this idea perfectly on slide 18 of their pitch deck. BuzzFeed pitched the idea of advertisement as content instead of having content and advertisement as two different entities, which was the norm.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nTheir idea to use content generated by users, computer algorithms and advertisers is what made them different from other journalistic websites. They pitched their platform to investors so they could include their advertisement as content.\n\nIn the pitch deck, BuzzFeed’s founders showed exactly how their idea worked and how it would look online. They also visualized exactly how the “advertisement as content” idea would benefit them, including screenshots of the actual website.\n\nIn their second-last slide, they prompt “How big can this get?”, and they were not shy to show just how their take on viral media could take off.\n\nKey Takeaway: If you're in the SaaS business, visualize your idea using actual screenshots of your product. Showing can be much more effective than simply telling, as it helps investors gain a deeper understanding of your idea.\n\nHere’s a product pitch deck template inspired by BuzzFeed to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n7. Launchrock Pitch Deck\n\nThe usual presentation has a light background and dark-colored content, but the pitch deck for Launchrock went in the opposite direction.\n\nThe slides have a black background, while the content is made of white text and red and blue gradient buttons. This visual quality is perfectly reminiscent of the Launchrock brand.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nThe Launchrock brand is simple, bold and to the point, and so is their pitch deck. The information on each slide is minimal, but precise. The data flows from one slide to the next in a simple storytelling format.\n\nTo top it off, they use social proof and a sense of community to get the message across.\n\nKey Takeaway: Don't be afraid to experiment when it comes to pitch deck design. Just make sure the colors and fonts you choose are aligned with your brand and don't compromise on the readability of your presentation slides.\n\nAnother lesson to be learned is that you don't always need to use text to explain your idea. The flowchart on slide 11 has no text, but it fully visualizes the idea behind their product.\n\nHere’s a professional pitch deck template inspired by Launchrock to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n8. Foursquare Pitch Deck\n\nFoursquare was huge a while ago, but with so many location-based apps now it’s easy to wonder if it still exists. Yes, Foursquare still exists and it’s so much more than it used to be at the beginning.\n\nBack in the young days of Foursquare, it was just two guys with an idea and this pitch deck.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nThis pitch deck has long sections of text, which isn’t usually considered a good idea. But on these slides with long bullet points, there are also mobile device mockups with real screenshots of the app doing its thing.\n\nThis somehow makes it work, along with the fact that the text is inspiring, innovative and perfectly organized.\n\nThe screenshots visualize every single functionality, yet keep things real. There are no excessive growth charts or high pitched dream ideas.\n\nFoursquare has done a great job of growing into a huge enterprise and it all began in the era of this pitch deck.\n\nKey Takeaway: Instead of just focusing on one type of user, show how your idea, company or product will benefit all the stakeholders involved. A large part of this pitch deck’s success is that it shows how the Foursquare app benefits both companies and users.\n\nHere’s a pitch deck template inspired by Foursquare to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n9. Intercom Pitch Deck\n\nThe Intercom logo has seen a lot of revamping since its first pitch deck, but it has always been full of personality.\n\nThe slides in Intercom's pitch presentation example stick to a simple outline accompanied by the hand-drawn font of their logo on the headings and bullets.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nNot only does this keep the pitch deck cover page on brand, it also adds a good dose of personality to all the slides. It shows investors that the Intercom company is simple, but not unpolished. Adding the font shows off the fun, human side of the brand.\n\nAlong with a light blue gradient background, the overall feel of this pitch deck is calm and reassuring. To hit the nail on the head, they used a simple font for the text, adding only some bold styling to reinforce the message.\n\nThe headings are positioned just right so if you skim through the slides, you can read them easily and grasp the big idea.\n\nKey Takeaway: The design of your pitch decks is more important than you'd think. Make sure your slides are easy to read and skim through, the colors don't clash, and the fonts are legible, even if they're fun or handwritten-style.\n\nHere’s a pitch deck template inspired by Intercom to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n10. Mattermark Pitch Deck\n\nThe main idea behind Mattermark was to solve an actual problem.\n\nThey created a “Google for businesses;” a data-driven search engine that helps SaaS businesses stay informed about other companies, which leads to better business decisions and improved market research.\n\nThe idea was a big one and they needed to show a lot of details in the pitch deck. Bordering on “too much information,” the Mattermark pitch deck uses multi-colored charts to compare important data.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nTo present the problem they aimed to solve, they relied on a flowing arrow diagram to visualize the outcome. As the slides progress, information is added on to create a comprehensive message.\n\nThey bring it home towards the end by showing how Mattermark can do it all faster and better. The charts are inspiring and resemble hockey sticks; the ultimate success chart example.\n\nKey Takeaway: If you have a lot of data to present, make it interesting by using different types of graphs. If you're presenting a solution to a problem, you can visualize that too with the help of arrows.\n\nHere’s a good pitch deck template inspired by Mattermark to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n11. TouristEye Pitch Deck\n\nBefore TouristEye was acquired by Lonely Planet, it was one of the first mobile apps directed at travelers. With the strong premise of “Travel Guides Suck,” they used this pitch deck to share the hype of TouristEye.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nIn this pitch deck, screenshots and travel-themed photography visualize a new, more personalized way of traveling where users could create their itineraries on the TouristEye app.\n\nIt’s not surprising that Lonely Planet ended up acquiring TouristEye; it was a huge competition for them.\n\nEven if the hype behind TouristEye was that travel guides sucked, Lonely Planet saw the potential and had to have it for their platform.\n\nKey Takeaway: The best pitch decks explain the big idea up front, even if it sounds a little harsh. If you have data to back your big idea up, especially related to conversions and growth, that's even better. Notice how TouristEye does it on slide 19 by highlighting that intent equals conversions.\n\nHere’s a pitch deck template inspired by TouristEye to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n12. Buffer Pitch Deck\n\nBuffer’s pitch deck is a great example of transparency and believing in your product.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nThe company is one of the first to release their pitch deck publicly, not only helping others with their decks, but illustrating goodwill.\n\nKey Takeaway: Transparency is something that both customers and investors appreciate. It reinforces your honesty and trustworthiness, and helps them better understand how your product works. Even better, it displays complete confidence in your product or service.\n\nHere’s a pitch deck template inspired by Buffer to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n13. Ooomf (Crew) Pitch Deck\n\nA common (and expected) thing you see in most pitch decks is how much growth a company has seen so far with their product.\n\nWhat’s less commonly seen are the people who’ve already taken an interest in your work. This is unsurprising, as many pitch decks are created for projects still looking for funding.\n\nHowever, for those lucky enough to already have some investors, this is a wonderful opportunity to take advantage of.\n\nOne great example of this is Crew.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nTheir pitch deck is incredibly sparse, using only the bare-minimum text and pictures. They also list other companies that have invested in theirs on slide 29, along with the amount they’ve already earned.\n\nIf you don’t have any interested parties yet, no problem; simply add quotes from satisfied customers or workers.\n\nThis deck does that, as well, with Milan C., a worker at Crew, claiming on their last slide, “Crew changed the way I work and with that how I live.”\n\nKey Takeaway: If you already have a few investors, companies or individuals supporting your product, don't be afraid to highlight them in your pitch deck.\n\nGrowth is not the only thing potential investors are intrigued by — proving that your product has earned respect from other groups is often enough to make people believe it's worth investing in.\n\nHere’s a pitch deck template inspired by Crew to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n14. Moz Pitch Deck\n\nMoz's pitch deck features an adorable mascot that appears on all of their slides, and colorful blocks and charts that illustrate their points.\n\nTheir later slides are filled with fun images, such as cartoon character Calvin (from Calvin and Hobbes) rampaging through a city.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nThe pitch deck never sacrifices the facts for fun either. They continue to describe their goals and statistics throughout, showing how useful they could be for investors and the business world in general.\n\nSEOmoz has a rather appealing tagline: “How a tiny Mom & Son consultancy became a leader in SEO Software, and our roadmap to being Seattle’s next $1 billion company.”\n\nThe tagline opens with the promise of an appealing story (their journey to the big time), and ends with an ambitious goal, piquing curiosity and convincing potential investors to follow along.\n\nKey Takeaway: It’s no secret that describing statistics and information can be, well, boring. Many potential investors have already heard such things countless times, even through the course of the day. So, how do you make yours stand out?\n\nSimple: do something different and entertaining, while still offering the information you need to get your point across. SEOmoz does this admirably in their pitch deck.\n\nHere’s a pitch deck template inspired by SEOmoz to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\nWhen creating a pitch deck with Visme, you have access to practical business features that help you create pitch decks more productively.

Biogrify Pitch Deck\n\nNot everyone’s an artist, but you don't need to be one to create a great pitch deck.\n\nSometimes just looking at design ideas and learning the in’s-and-out’s of your product can be enough.\n\nBiogrify's deck is a great example of this, as it’s filled with images and screenshots, most of which aren’t drawings.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nTheir deck looks a little different than the slide deck examples above due to the focus on creativity.\n\nNotice how they’ve used photos with speech bubbles to explain their message and several shots of their product in action to advertise.\n\nThe charts on slide 7 are of special note, as they are organized to not clutter the page and still maximize the amount of images that can fit.\n\nKey Takeaway: Use creativity, but not just for thef sake of it. In Biogrify's pitch deck, each image helps support their words, making the overall experience appealing and interesting, rather than either frustrating or confusing. Better yet, the message is reinforced through the use of visual presentation aids.\n\nHere’s a pitch deck template inspired by Biogrify to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n16. Front Pitch Deck\n\nFront's pitch deck offers a great example of using an attractive color scheme to your advantage.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nThey’ve primarily used white, blue, and pink to fill the slides.\n\nFor example, slide 9 has a white background and pink header, with a line graph that uses blue and pink to represent the specific values mentioned.\n\nFront establishes some of this color scheme early on, with the title page in deep blue with white font. Colorful confetti shapes litter the background, hinting at the “fun” feel the pink would later give.\n\nKey Takeaway: Using a specific color scheme can work wonders for your pitch deck. The colors, spread across the slides, can help unify a presentation and make it pop. Moreover, using specific colors that represent your company will help the pitch deck be more recognizable.\n\nBe careful when choosing colors for your pitch deck. Different colors can evoke different feelings. You can find out more about color psychology and color schemes in our comprehensive guide.\n\nHere’s a startup pitch template inspired by Front to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n17. Piccsy Pitch Deck\n\nPiccsy's deck gives a bit more literal example of smooth transitions. The photo site has an online infographic format, rather than the traditional slide deck format.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nEach individual slide flows smoothly into one another as you scroll down the page, with similar themes (like the circles to hold information and the color scheme) tying the work together.\n\nThis pitch deck also takes an innovative approach by providing information at the end to encourage contact, making it one of the best investor pitch decks.\n\nKey Takeaway: Stand out to potential investors by turning your pitch deck into an interactive experience. Piccsy does this well by creating an infographic-style website, complete with their branding and even contact information at the end to encourage action.\n\nThink of ways to pitch your startup to investors other than going with a traditional presentation deck — videos, interactive web pages and online presentations are a few great alternatives.\n\nHere’s a pitch deck template inspired by Piccsy to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nWhen you’re at the point of adding visuals, you can generate unique images, illustrations and graphics using the AI Image Generator. Likewise, if you have chosen stock or legacy images that need a little editing, take advantage of the AI Edit Tools to upscale, unblur and remove unwanted objects or entire backgrounds.\n\n18. LinkedIn Pitch Deck\n\nThe way you design your pitch deck depends on several things, like your target market and the people you hope will invest in your product.\n\nLinkedIn's Series B pitch deck is specifically aimed towards more serious, business-minded individuals, considering that is the intended audience to use the product.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nTheir pitch deck is filled with straightforward facts and data that logically define the site’s worth, rather than more artistic and stylized elements.\n\nLinkedIn even goes a step further and shows the relations between the current most-used mediums for certain services and their older counterparts (e.g. using a bank in the past versus using PayPal in the present).\n\nThis allows them to prove their point—that the internet has become the most-used base for services previously offered offline—and show their particular niche, again endearing themselves to their audience.\n\nKey Takeaway: Tailor your pitch deck content to your target audience. If your product or service is aimed at the younger generation, you’ll probably want to have more references to pop culture and familiar terms in your deck. If you’re pitching to a more mathematically-inclined group, your deck should be more organized and filled with data.\n\nHere’s a pitch deck template inspired by LinkedIn to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n19. Fyre Festival Pitch Deck\n\nYou might have already seen the Fyre Festival documentary on Netflix.\n\nIf you haven’t, you should consider doing so, especially from a marketing point of view.\n\nFyre Festival was the single most disastrous business event in the past years. But it also managed to round up millions of dollars from investors as it grew, all thanks to the social media hype and this over the top pitch deck.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nSavvy business owners with impeccable BS filters didn’t fall for the bright and shiny influencers being paraded on this pitch deck. But tons of other investors did, mostly due to the FOMO factor the slides presented.\n\nFOMO stands for “Fear of Missing Out,” and that is how Billy McFarland managed to get millions of dollars to fund a badly organized idea.\n\nKey Takeaway: This is the kind of pitch deck that will go down in history as the epitome of blinding investors with celebrities and expert social media schemes. The Fyre Festival pitch deck is not the best pitch deck, but it is a great example of how information can be manipulated.\n\nHere’s a pitch deck template inspired by Fyre Festival to get you started.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n20. Manpacks Pitch Deck\n\nManpacks was a subscription service that sold men’s underwear, socks, toiletries and other products. The service was discontinued in 2018, but was an absolute hit when it first launched in 2010.\n\nManpacks' pitch deck managed to raise $500,000 in funding over one round.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nFor starters, their business model was unique and solved an actual need — regularly shipping basic essentials to men who dislike shopping or are just lazy.\n\nBut what really got to investors was the fact that Manpacks knew who they were. Their brand voice was reflected in every slide of their pitch deck.\n\nBetter yet, they knew who their target audience was, which is also why the service had as many as 10,000 subscribers at one point.\n\nKey Takeaway: Understanding who you are as a brand and being able to express that clearly is just as important as knowing your product — and the best pitch decks are designed with that in mind.\n\nManpacks’ pitch deck is short, but it does the job by communicating the problem, solution, value proposition and incentive for investors all in a fun tone that’s aligned with their brand voice.\n\nIf you're looking to create a light-hearted but on-brand pitch deck similar to Manpacks', here's a fun, colorful and illustrative pitch deck template you can use for your own startup.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n21. Coinbase Pitch Deck\n\nCoinbase is a cryptocurrency platform that lets people buy, sell and store digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nTo date, the company has raised nearly $550 million in funding over 14 rounds.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nWhat’s interesting is they still managed to raise a good amount even back in 2012 when only a handful of people knew about cryptocurrency.\n\nCoinbase's pitch deck above is a great example of how the company generated interest in the concept of digital currency by presenting data-driven arguments.\n\nInstead of talking about their own growth, they start by focusing on the growth of Bitcoin, and why it’s worth investing in a service made specifically for that digital currency.\n\nKey Takeaway: Using data to support your claims can help you build trust and credibility in the eyes of potential investors. The best pitch decks make this data easier to understand by visualizing it into charts and graphs, just like Coinbase did.\n\nLet’s also take a moment to appreciate how Coinbase used ratios and the example of iTunes to successfully capture the essence of its product in four words.\n\nUse the pitch deck template below inspired by Coinbase to put focus on your solution.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n22. Snapchat Pitch Deck\n\nBack in 2011, Snapchat came up with the unique idea of sharing photos and videos that disappear after a short time.\n\nTheir pitch deck below from 2014 is not exactly an investor pitch deck — Snapchat designed this presentation to introduce businesses to their product and its marketing value, and to convince them to sign up for a business account.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nThe presentation above carries immense value if you’re looking for a sales pitch deck example that’s minimalistic and effective.\n\nThe slides are clean and full of images, which makes it easier for businesses to quickly look through and get the point.\n\nWe especially love the “What Do I Snap?” and “Get the Word Out” slides, which show businesses how they can use the app for marketing purposes with the help of visual examples.\n\nKey Takeaway: Stuffing text into your slides is not always the answer. Using images can be much more effective at familiarizing people with your product’s features and functionality.\n\nAlso, think about whether your audience would find more value in real examples or fictional ones. Snapchat uses actual examples from existing brands using the platform to show businesses how others like them are taking advantage of new marketing opportunities.\n\nHere's a pitch deck template inspired by Snapchat that you can use to showcase your product visually.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n23. YouTube Pitch Deck\n\nWith over 2 billion users, YouTube is the largest video sharing platform in the world.\n\nThe company has raised around $83.5 million in funding in just two rounds. This professional pitch deck below is from their first funding round in 2005, when they pitched to Sequoia Capital. At the time, the platform had less than 10,000 users.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nYouTube’s investor presentation is a solid example of what a traditional pitch deck outline looks like. Keep in mind that the pitch deck is quite old, which is probably why it lacks good design and visuals.\n\nEven so, it covers key details by highlighting the problem, presenting the exact solution, listing the competition, and outlining the sales and distribution plan.\n\nKey Takeaway: If your product is unique and better than the competition, it will sell itself. In the case of pitch decks, great products are likely to attract investors even if you don’t focus too much on the design.\n\nAlso, even if you’re keeping it basic, make sure you incorporate all the important details like what you plan to achieve and how you plan to get there.\n\nUse the pitch deck template below inspired by YouTube to highlight your key strengths and what makes you better than your competitors.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\nAs you work on your pitch deck in Visme, you have the opportunity to work collaboratively and brainstorm using the online whiteboard.

Facebook Pitch Deck\n\nWe all know about Facebook — our beloved social media platform that helps us stay connected with our friends, family, colleagues, pets and the world in general.\n\nTill now, Facebook has secured over $2.3 billion in funding, and this pitch deck from 2004 played a key role in helping Mark Zuckerberg build the largest social network in the world.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nInitially, Facebook was created for the students, alumni, faculty and staff at Harvard University. Later, it expanded to include other schools and universities, but it wasn’t long until it transcended academic institutions and took over the world.\n\nBecause Facebook wasn’t really making any money at the time, it relied on social proof as well as usage and engagement statistics to sell its idea — and it worked!\n\nKey Takeaway: As a startup, you don’t always need to have financial information to back up your idea. If you don’t currently have any revenue data to show, you can still make a strong case with usage, engagement and audience metrics that show potential for growth.\n\nAlso, adding social proof can go a long way in building trust and credibility in front of investors. This works especially well if those customer reviews and testimonials talk about your potential for going big.\n\nVisualize usage and engagement statistics using the Facebook-inspired pitch deck template below.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n25. Crunchbase Pitch Deck\n\nCrunchbase is one the best platforms for researching innovative startups and companies. The website lists important information like funding data, mergers and acquisitions, leadership positions and more.\n\nTheir pitch deck below was part of their Series C funding round, and helped secure around $30 million. All in all, there’s a lot to learn from this good pitch deck example coming from a company focused on investment.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nAs you can see, starting with a story helped investors see the opportunity for Crunchbase’s solution and understand the challenges people face while searching for reliable information about companies. So, when Crunchbase presented the solution, the investors were ready for it.\n\nAnother interesting thing to note is Crunchbase’s use of visual analogies to highlight the gravity of the problem and the size of the potential opportunity.\n\nKey Takeaway: Set the stage with a story rather than trying to impress investors with big numbers on traffic and usage data. This will grab their attention and help them understand the purpose of your product.\n\nAlso, using images and graphics as visual metaphors can help you drive the point home more effectively than with plain text.\n\nStart your own presentation with a story using Crunchbase's recreated startup pitch deck template below.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n26. Contently Pitch Deck\n\nContently is a popular content marketing platform that helps businesses with content strategy and connects them with a global talent network of writers, designers, filmmakers and more.\n\nWith the pitch deck below, Contently was able to secure $9 million in funding back in 2014.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nThe design of this pitch deck example is clean and bold. We especially like the big fonts, which get the message across clearly.\n\nThe highlight of Contently’s pitch deck is probably the way they present the problem (and where they fit in.) They set the stage by talking about the huge market size, and then throw in a stat to highlight the problem within that market.\n\nAnother good thing about this pitch deck is the use of social proof to build trust with potential investors. They do this with a powerful quote from Forbes in support of their platform.\n\nKey Takeaway: The design of your pitch deck matters a lot more than you’d think. Using large and bold fonts that’s aligned with your brand identity can a) help you highlight key points, and b) make you look confident.\n\nGrab attention using this pitch deck template inspired by Contently.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n27. Wise (TransferWise) Pitch Deck\n\nFormerly known as TransferWise, this London-based money transfer service gained popularity primarily because of its innovative pricing model that charges users a minimal fee for transfers while showing them what they have to pay upfront.\n\nSince its inception in 2011, the company has raised around $1.3 billion in funding over 13 rounds. The pitch deck below is from 2012, and it helped Wise raise $1.3 million in funding.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nTransferWise’s deck is simple and straightforward, which is also its best quality. Instead of beating around the bush or trying to be too creative, they get straight to the point. This shows they clearly know what they’re doing.\n\nThere’s also a good balance of text and visuals in this pitch deck — you never feel overwhelmed with too much information. They’ve also laid out their short-term and long-term priorities, which shows they have a good roadmap for the next year and a half.\n\nKey Takeaway: Let your product and value proposition guide the design of your pitch deck. If you’re solving a solid problem that doesn’t require too many words to explain, don’t use too many words — use numbers instead.\n\nIn TransferWise’s case, their USP was (and still is) the low cost of money transfers, and they wasted no time in making that clear.\n\nExplain your product and pricing using this Wise-inspired pitch deck template:\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n28.

The deck is pretty decent and covers all key points.\n\nWe love the fact that they establish what they do up front — this is important if you’re presenting a technical idea. The team slide is also very well done as it includes both the founders and the investors.\n\nBliss has also done a good job with using social proof, such as testimonials and logos, to increase their credibility.\n\nKey Takeaway: If your company or product is more on the technical side, it’s a good idea to explain what it is and how it works before anything else. Talking about traction and clients won’t do you much good if your investors are still trying to figure out what you do.\n\nBriefly explain the purpose of your SaaS company with this Bliss-inspired pitch deck template.\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\nWhen your pitch deck presentation is ready, you can share it as a live Flipbook document, an interactive PDF or a printable document.

Castle Pitch Deck\n\nCastle was a property management platform founded in 2014. The company closed its operations four years later, but their pitch deck below helped raise over $270,000 in funding in its early days.\n\nOriginal pitch deck:\n\nThe great thing about this pitch deck is that you can see the team’s personality show through. The headers are non-traditional and sum up key ideas. The design is clean and bold. Also, they’ve used icons and illustrations to highlight key points, which is a nice touch.\n\nCastle’s pitch deck also does an excellent job at presenting the value proposition up front. We also like the “And we have some great ways to grow” slide, which shows that they’ve put a considerable amount of thought into making it big.\n\nKey Takeaway: Don’t be afraid to show some personality in your pitch deck template. If you’re friendly and approachable, incorporate design elements that exude the same feelings in your presentation slides.\n\nAlso, if you have ideas that are not yet concrete, it might not be a bad idea to share them anyway. It shows investors that you’ve at least made the effort to think about your business.\n\nShow your personality and share ideas with this pitch deck template inspired by Castle:\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n30. Shift Pitch Deck\n\nShift’s journey started in 2013 as an automotive marketplace.

The slides come with nice, descriptive headers (with most of them being questions) and the presentation aptly explains the big idea, how the product works and why the timing is just right.\n\nThey’ve also done a fair bit of homework on potential scalability, which can be seen in their cost of acquisition and expansion slides.\n\nKey Takeaway: Sometimes, keeping it short and concise can be the best thing you can do for your investor presentation. The goal of a pitch deck is not to secure funding, it’s to make it to the next meeting. Even if your slides are short, they should be intriguing and full of value, so much so that they make investors want to know more.\n\nPresent your solution and keep it short and sweet with this pitch deck template inspired by Alto:\n\nRecreated in Visme:\n\nCreate your own Pitch Deck with this easy-to-edit template!Edit and Download\n\n34.
