        "text": "Following yesterday’s slightly better-than-expected PPI report US markets rallied sharply with the S&P 500 closing up 1.7% taking the index into a key resistance zone, filling most of the post jobs gap and closing just below the 50d ma. The gains were broad based, but tech continued to led with the NYSE FANG+ index closing up nearly 3%. Energy was the only sector in the S&P 500 to close lower as oil prices fell. Ahead of this morning’s data global markets traded mostly higher overnight with the exception of China/Hong Kong which pulled back modestly. It was a muted overnight session for S&P futures hovering right around unchanged. This morning’s CPI report was essentially in line with estimates. On a monthly basis both headline and core were up 0.2%. On an annual basis there was some slight moderation with headline both falling 0.1% from last month to 2.9% and core 3.2%, respectively with headline a tenth better than expected. There has been some volatility in equity futures post data but as the dust settles they are moving slightly higher. S&P futures are currently up ~0.2% while Russell futures which have been outperforming overnight are up ~0.3% but well off the high. Yields were modestly lower overnight but have moved higher post release with some re-steepening of the curve. 2yr yields are up ~4bps to 3.98% while 10yr yields are up 1bps to 3.86%."
