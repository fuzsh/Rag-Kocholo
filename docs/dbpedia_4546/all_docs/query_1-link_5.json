In VIS iTV we have found the ideal partner with the highest quality product, perfectly complementing iSports TVÃ¢s existing sports and interactive gaming content.\"\n\n\"Being the first to launch virtual horseracing on UK TV is a major achievement for the company,\" commented VIS iTV chief executive Simon Grieve. It's expected that the iRace game will also be rolled out over digital cable networks shortly."
