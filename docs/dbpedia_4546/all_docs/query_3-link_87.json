        "text": "How cool is it to use a code name for an important project rather than “version 2.5” or “next gen”? Same for a company acquisition or game-changing strategic initiative that will fundamentally change the landscape and trajectory for the company. Even adventure games, video game characters for Fortnite or Minecraft, and team names for any sort of competition can benefit from really cool names.\n\nThis article includes a list of more than 500 code names to consider for your use. In fact, one column includes code names grouped by a particular theme and another column just lists a bunch of cool words and phrases to consider for code names. I’ve used many of these over the years and hope you enjoy using them too.\n\nWhy Are Code Names Needed?\n\nFirst, it’s fundamentally fun and cool to use code names, but that’s not necessarily the reason to start using them. The key reason for business settings usually relates to confidential programs and activities that are talked and written about in ways that could possibly be exposed to people that shouldn’t have knowledge, including the general public. Haven’t you ever been in a coffee shop or restaurant and overhead a conversation that was clearly confidential?\n\nThe most common business use cases for code names happen to correspond to articles I’ve written and published on this site.\n\nProduct roadmap and innovation programs\n\nSee related article titled “Prioritizing Your Roadmap“\n\nStrategic partnerships – during the courtship and negotiation phase\n\nSee related article titled “A Secret to Securing a Strategic Partnership“\n\nFuture launch of some big initiative\n\nSee related article titled “A.I. Will Revolutionize the Marketing Function“\n\nAcquisitions\n\nSee related articles in the M&A Category\n\nOther Hints & Tips\n\nIf your company has multiple products or product lines, consider assigning a theme to each and then using code names from those themes. It will help your employees and business partners more easily remember what the code name stands for. For example, one of the companies I worked for in the past used names of philosophers for one product line, types of snakes for another and Greek/Roman gods for another. You’ll see such category groupings below.\n\nFor companies that are active acquirers (M&A), consider using a code name that has the same first letter as the target company. But realize that if your general employee population finds out that you use this approach, they might be able to figure out who your acquisition target is.\n\nThe Lists"
