        "meta_description": "Hi everyone! My name is Jo and I am about to graduate college with a BA in Multimedia art. I am also an indie game developer with my company \"nsomni-art\". For my senior project I would like to make a video game that is tailored to visually impaired gamers! We are new to the game dev community, as well as this community, so I would love to learn as much as I can by being active in this forum. You can find me on twitter and say \"hi\": @notjoordinary. You can also email me at J O at nsomniart dot com. It is like \"insomnia\" minus the letter \"i\" in the beginning. And the word \"art\" finishes the end of the word: \"nsomniart\".",
