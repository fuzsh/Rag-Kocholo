        "text": "Advancing Gaming and Gambling in Macau\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Macau gaming market has long been a global powerhouse, attracting millions of tourists and generating substantial revenue for the region. It is worth reminding the reader that only at the beginning of 2023 were all entry restrictions lifted with the market recovering significantly since then, with special emphasis since the beginning of the second quarter.\n\nRecent trends\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, new concession contracts entered into force pursuant to the public tender of 2022. The incumbent concessionaires awarded with casino gaming concessions, MGM Grand Paradise, Galaxy Casino, Venetian Macau, Melco Resorts (Macau), Wynn Resorts (Macau), and SJM Resorts are now in full fledge to comply with the proposals submitted during the tender and with the concession contracts. The six casino gaming concessionaires operating in Macau’s gaming market have pledged a substantial investment of MOP118.8 billion (USD14.9 billion) over the course of their 10-year concession. Out of this total, MOP108.7 billion (USD13.6 billion) will be dedicated to developing foreign visitor markets and non-gaming projects, while MOP10.1 billion (USD1.26 billion) will be allocated specifically for gaming projects. This significant investment underscores the commitment of these concessionaires to diversify Macau’s tourism offerings and enhance its appeal beyond just gambling.\n\nOverall, Macau’s Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) for the first half of 2023 has surged by 205% year-on-year, amounting to MOP80.14 billion (USD9.93 billion). This robust performance indicates a strong recovery for the Macau gaming market, reflecting positive trends and a rebound in visitor numbers.\n\nWhen we look to the third quarter of 2023, the GGR has increased by 7%, reaching nearly 70% of pre-Covid levels. This indicates a strong recovery for the industry, reflecting positive trends and an uptick in visitor numbers.\n\nThe mass-market segment has particularly thrived, with an impressive 11% growth, achieving a remarkable 95% recovery compared to pre-pandemic levels. This surge in the mass-market segment highlights the resilience and appeal of Macau’s gaming offerings to a broader range of visitors.\n\nIn addition to the growth in GGR, the sector’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) may have reached USD1.7 billion in the third quarter, which demonstrates the industry’s financial strength and profitability, further solidifying Macau’s position as a leading global gaming destination.\n\nOverall, these positive developments indicate a robust and promising outlook for Macau’s gaming market in the third quarter of 2023. The steady recovery in GGR, particularly in the mass-market segment, coupled with strong EBITDA figures, showcases the resilience and potential of the industry as it continues to rebound from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDevelopments\n\nAs we look ahead to 2024, several trends and developments are expected to shape the industry, further solidifying Macau’s position as a premier destination for gambling and entertainment.\n\nMacau’s government has been actively promoting the development of Macau as a world-class tourism destination. The integrated resorts (IRs) are part of this strategy that aims to diversify the region’s tourism offerings beyond gambling. In the next couple of years, we can expect to witness the completion of the expansion of the existing IR projects. These resorts will feature a mix of gaming facilities, luxury hotels, retail outlets, entertainment venues, and convention spaces, attracting a broader range of visitors and boosting non-gaming revenue, one of the goals of the government in line with the focus on non-gaming elements by the concessionaires.\n\nThe VIP gaming segment has traditionally been a significant driver of Macau’s gaming revenue. However, recent regulatory changes and geopolitical factors have impacted this segment. We may still witness a resurgence in the VIP market as travel restrictions ease and high-net-worth individuals resume their international travel. Macau’s operators will likely focus on enhancing their VIP offerings, providing personalised experiences, and strengthening relationships with key players to regain momentum in this segment, relying less on the gaming promoters and more on international marketing teams.\n\nTo reduce reliance on the VIP segment, Macau’s operators have been actively targeting the mass market. This trend is expected to continue in 2023, with operators diversifying their offerings to cater to a broader range of visitors. We can anticipate the introduction of more non-gaming attractions, family-friendly entertainment options, and affordable accommodation choices to attract a wider audience that will stay in Macau for more nights. Additionally, operators will likely invest in marketing campaigns to promote Macau as a destination for leisure and entertainment, beyond just gambling.\n\nAs the global focus on sustainability and responsible gaming intensifies, Macau’s gaming industry is also expected to prioritise these aspects. Responsible gaming duties played an important role during the tender after the changes to the Macau Gaming Law (Law 16/2002) introduced during 2022. In accordance with the law, concessionaires shall take into consideration the complexity associated with the operation of casino gaming activities, promoting actions and information within the scope of preventive awareness, developing codes of conduct, and disseminating best practices. It is also within their duties to present annually to the regulator (DICJ) a report of the enforcement of the responsible gaming promotion plans that may comprise stricter responsible gaming measures, including enhanced player protection programmes, self-exclusion options, and initiatives to combat problem gambling. Additionally, sustainability practices such as energy-efficient operations, waste management, and eco-friendly designs may gain prominence in the near future.\n\nMoving forward, the Macau gaming industry will continue to monitor and adapt to changing circumstances, ensuring the satisfaction of visitors while striving for sustainable growth. The positive performance in the first three quarters 2023 provides optimism for the industry’s recovery and potential for continued success in the future.\n\nDiversification\n\nCasino gaming concessionaires shall align with the government plans for the diversification of the economy, aiming to attract foreign patrons with a strategy to achieve the goal including the non-gaming attractions like entertainment shows, cultural events, shopping experiences, and fine dining to appeal to a broader audience. Marketing campaigns highlight Macau’s unique cultural blend and vibrant experience. VIP programmes and services catering to high-net-worth international individuals should also be part of the plans, offering personalised experiences and exclusive gaming areas.\n\nIn light of this, effective from 1 January 2023, a new regulation (Administrative Regulation 54/2022) has been implemented in Macau to outline the factors that will be considered for the reduction or exemption of the 5% contributions from the GGR as stipulated in the Macau Gaming Law. The factors to be evaluated include the expansion of foreign client markets by the casino gaming concessionaires and the negative impact of unforeseen events on the Macau economy and the operation of the concessionaires. The regulation also clarifies that “foreign markets” clients are those who visit Macau for tourism or trading purposes and hold travel documents issued by countries or regions outside of the People’s Republic China. The specific criteria for the reduction or exemption are established in Chief Executive Dispatch 216/2022, which focuses on calculating the GGR generated through the expansion of foreign client sources by the casino gaming concessionaires.\n\nAs to the legal landscape, for all aspects of the industry, Macau follows an administrative concession system, under which the government and private entities legally incorporated in Macau enter into a concession contract with Macau SAR. This is the case for the operation of casino games, lotteries (Chinese and sports lotteries), and pari-mutuel (horse racing and greyhound).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite the commitments of the horse racing concessionaire and the current concession contract, which is effective until 2042, there are indications that 2023 might mark the final year of horse races in Macau. This possibility arises due to various factors and considerations that have emerged during 2023. One significant factor is the declining popularity of horse racing as a form of entertainment and betting activity in Macau. The industry has faced challenges in attracting a younger demographic and competing with other forms of entertainment and gaming options available in the region. This decline in interest has led to a decrease in attendance and wagering, which may make it financially unsustainable to continue operating horse races.\n\nWhile the current concession contract for horse racing in Macau extends until 2042, the activity faces challenges that may lead to 2023 being the final year of horse races in the region. The aforesaid factors contribute to the uncertainty surrounding the future of this traditional activity in Macau.\n\nRegulatory outlook\n\nRegarding the legal and regulatory outlook for the Macau casino gaming market, there are expectations for changes in both the credit for gaming law and the illegal gambling law.\n\nSpecifically, a new credit for casino gaming law is pending final approval in second reading and is expected to enter into force on 1 January 2024.\n\nProposed changes to the credit for casino gaming law in Macau aim to regulate and enhance the granting of credit within the gaming industry. The changes include requirements for gaming promoters to have contracts with concessionaires, excluding management companies from extending credit. New duties and consequences for credit grantors are introduced to promote responsible lending practices. General provisions related to supervision, authority powers, precautionary measures, and sanctions are also included.\n\nWhen effective, the new law aims to ensure transparency, fairness, and responsible practices in the extension of credit for casino gaming in Macau.\n\nOn 11 December 2023, it was announced that the Macau Executive Council has concluded discussions on the Draft Law Proposal on Combating Illegal Gambling. The rationale behind this draft law is to enhance the legal framework for combating various criminal acts associated with illicit gambling. The existing law on illegal gambling has been in effect for over 20 years, prompting the need for a comprehensive revision. The draft law aligns with recently enacted gaming laws and the ongoing discussion on the “Legal Framework for the Granting of Credit for Casino Gambling”.\n\nThe main points of the draft law include clarifying the crime of “side betting” and incorporating it into the illegal operation of games of chance. It also addresses the issue of illegal online gambling by expressly prohibiting its operation, promotion, and organisation, regardless of the location of the computer systems involved. The draft law aims to standardise and co-ordinate statutory rules related to pari-mutuel betting and proposes allowing residential searches during specific hours for certain crimes.\n\nTo combat evasion and protect informants, the draft law introduces provisions for undercover agents and establishes a new protection regime for individuals who provide information or co-operate with the police. It also strengthens penalties for offences related to illicit gambling and improves corresponding criminal and procedural rules. Additionally, the draft law aims to enhance the sanctioning regime for administrative offences by increasing fines and improving related provisions.\n\nThe full content of the draft law was yet to be released at the date of writing, and it will undergo review by the Legislative Assembly.\n\nEnforcement\n\nIn recent developments, the enforcement of justice within the gaming industry has taken significant strides. One notable case involved Alvin Chau, the former influential gaming promoter kingpin and CEO of Suncity Group. After his arrest in late 2021 on charges of organised crime and illegal gaming, Chau’s illicit bets, surpassing HKD823.7 billion, highlighted the extent of his illegal activities. In early 2023, the court reached a verdict, finding him guilty and imposing a substantial 18-year prison sentence. This decision was later confirmed by the Second Instance Court in mid-October, which, while acquitting him of fraud, increased the compensation to be paid to the SAR for money laundering and illicit gaming offences to nearly USD3.1 billion. It is important to note that the decision is still subject to appeal to the Last Instance Court.\n\nAnother prominent figure in the gaming industry, Levo Chan, CEO of Tak Chun Group, also faced legal consequences. Alongside other defendants, Chan received a 14-year prison sentence and was ordered to repay a significant sum of HKD553.4 million to Macau SAR and the affected gaming operators. Like the one involving Alvin Chau, the decision on this case is still subject to appeal.\n\nThe court’s decisive actions in these cases seems to send a clear message that illegal activities within the gaming industry will not be tolerated. These verdicts mark a significant step towards safeguarding the integrity of the industry and ensuring fair play for all stakeholders involved. By holding individuals accountable for their illicit actions, the enforcement of justice contributes to maintaining a transparent and lawful gaming environment in Macau.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the casino gaming industry in Macau is poised for significant developments over the next couple of years. The region’s casino gaming concessionaires and government are actively working to attract international clients through the development of integrated resorts, non-gaming attractions, targeted marketing campaigns, and exceptional VIP services, with strategies aiming to position Macau as a global gaming hub and entice a broader audience beyond traditional gambling enthusiasts.\n\nFurthermore, commitment to collaboration with tourism boards and continuous promotion of the region as a premier gaming destination will contribute to attracting a wider audience and solidifying the region as a “world-class tourism destination”.\n\nLooking ahead, the gaming industry can expect a comprehensive entertainment experience, strengthened regulatory measures, and a focus on responsible gaming practices. Macau’s efforts to diversify its offerings and cater to the evolving preferences of international clients will drive growth and maintain its position as a leading gaming destination in Asia. The amount of investment committed by the casino gaming operators during the tender of 2022 inked in the concession contracts will also play a very important role in achieving the objectives. The areas of investment that the concessionaires are abided to comprise, among others, conventions and exhibitions (MICE industry), entertainment shows, sporting events, culture and art, health and well-being, themed amusements, city of gastronomy, community, and maritime tourism.\n\nAs the next years unfold, it is anticipated that Macau will continue to innovate, adapt, and thrive in the dynamic landscape of the industry, cementing its status as a global powerhouse in the years to come."
