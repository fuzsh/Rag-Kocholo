When I first landed in Montenegro, I was amazed. I loved the views, the food, and the people. But I quickly noticed something odd. Everyone was using the Euro. I was puzzled because Montenegro isn’t part of the European Union. This made me curious: Why does Montenegro use the euro?

What is Eurozone?

First, let’s get a quick overview of the Eurozone. The Eurozone, often referred to as the Euro area, represents a collective of European nations that have chosen the euro (€) as their official currency. Out of the 27 European Union member states, 20, including the recent addition of Croatia, belong to the Eurozone. This monetary policy is steered by the European Central Bank situated in Frankfurt, Germany.

Outside of the EU, certain countries and territories have adopted the euro through varied arrangements. Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City hold formal agreements with the EU, allowing them to mint a restricted quantity of euro coins bearing their national symbols, though they don’t produce euro banknotes. Additionally, some regions and dependencies of EU member nations, like Guadeloupe, Martinique, and French Guiana, utilize the euro, irrespective of their non-EU status.

Montenegro and Kosovo, not EU members, have unilaterally adopted the euro. And neither has a formal agreement with the EU for its use.

To get the full picture, we must go back to hyperinflation in Yugoslavia.

Yugoslavia’s Economic Crisis

Hyperinflation is often depicted in economics textbooks as a worst-case scenario, a phenomenon where prices rise so rapidly and severely that the concept of currency begins to lose its meaning. For the former Yugoslavia during the early 1990s, this was not just a theoretical concept, but a harrowing reality.

In the backdrop of Yugoslavia’s complex political and ethnic turmoil, its economy took a severe hit. The dissolution of Yugoslavia, coupled with the wars of independence, disrupted trade and caused massive economic downturns. International sanctions, coupled with a rapid increase in the money supply by the government, led to one of the most extreme cases of hyperinflation in history. The government, in an attempt to finance its deficits, printed excessive amounts of money. This, combined with a loss of confidence in the national currency and the economic sanctions imposed by the international community, exacerbated the situation. To put this into perspective, prices doubled approximately every 34 hours in January 1994. Imagine going to sleep and waking up to find everything twice as expensive as it was the night before.

The national currency, the Yugoslav dinar, became virtually worthless. People carried bags full of cash for simple purchases, and barter trade became commonplace. It wasn’t unusual to see citizens trading household items for basic necessities like bread or milk. Savings evaporated, trust in financial institutions collapsed, and the social contract that binds people to their government began to fray.

Montenegro’s Path to the Euro

In the aftermath of Yugoslavia’s hyperinflation crisis, Montenegro urgently sought economic stability.

By 1999, the German mark, without any formal endorsement, had become Montenegro’s primary currency, signaling a desire to distance from the Yugoslav Federation. The mark, stable and trusted, was used for daily transactions and savings. When the euro emerged in 2002, replacing the mark, Montenegro naturally shifted to it, even though it wasn’t part of the EU or Eurozone.

Montenegro’s adoption of the euro was unilateral. Without a say in the Eurozone’s policies or the ability to mint their own coins, Montenegro saw more benefits in the euro’s stability and the economic prospects it offered. Today, the euro stands as Montenegro’s official currency, symbolizing its journey from economic chaos to stability.

The Benefits and Trade-offs for Montenegro

Montenegro’s choice to embrace the euro is an unusual one. In doing so, they opted for “unilateral adoption”. This essentially means that Montenegro chose to use the euro without receiving formal permission from the European Union or joining the Eurozone. Practically, it meant acquiring euros from the international market and circulating them within the country, just like any other currency. This bold move presented both rewards and risks.

On the bright side, the euro brought about much-desired stability, shielding Montenegro from the haunting memories of hyperinflation. With the euro as its currency, the nation became a more attractive hub for investments from both nearby and distant shores. Additionally, trading became less cumbersome with many Eurozone partners, eliminating the constant juggle of currency conversion.

However, the move wasn’t devoid of challenges. By unilaterally adopting the euro, Montenegro gave up any control over its monetary policy. They couldn’t adjust interest rates or deploy other financial strategies tailored for their own economic conditions. Moreover, despite using the Eurozone’s currency, Montenegro doesn’t get the financial safety nets that EU members benefit from in times of economic downturns.

Final Thoughts

On your next trip to Montenegro, the euros you use have a special past. Eating local treats, seeing old buildings, or just having a coffee with a view, remember the story of the euro. It’s a part of the country’s history.
