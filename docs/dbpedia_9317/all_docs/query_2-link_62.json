        "text": "By the mid fourth-century BC, coins were issued primarily on the islands of Pharos, the island of Issa and in the kingdom of Paeonia. Paeonian and Celtic coins (in Croatia) were succeeded by Roman coins following the annexation of Macedonia in the second century BC, though initially these coins were minted in Rome. After the fall of Rome, Byzantine coins were predominant until the twelfth century when Freisach pfennigs and Venetian denarii began to circulate. In the 1260s, the kings of Serbia began issuing imitations of Venetian grossi.\n\nSerbia fell under Ottoman rule in 1459. Slavonia and northern Yugoslavia remained mostly under Hungarian rule, while Montenegro remained independent. Venice remained an important influence in Dalmatia until 1797 where Venetian coinage made up most of the currency. Ragusa survived as a republic under Turkish protection from 1526 until 1806 using a monetary system similar to that of Venice with 1 ducat equal to 40 grossetti and 240 soldi.\n\nMontenegro became a Principality within the Ottoman Empire on March 13, 1852. It became an independent Kingdom on August 28, 1910, but merged with Serbia/Yugoslavia on November 26, 1918. Montenegro was occupied by Italy on April 17, 1941, and gained nominal independence from Serbia on July 12, 1941 though it remained under Italian control until December 4, 1943 when the Italians signed an armistice with the Allies and the Germans took over the administration of Montenegro until it was liberated in 1945. In 2002, the two remaining republics of the former Yugoslavia, decided to continue their union until at least 2005 and take on the name of Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nThe Montenegran coins were minted in Risan in the 2nd Century B.C. Turkish coins were used in Montenegro while it was part of the Ottoman Empire. After the end of the Venetian Republic, Austrian coins became predominate, and by 1857 the Austrian Florin had become the basic currency of Montenegro.\n\nThe first Perper (MEP) coins were issued in Montenegro in 1906 by Prince Nikola. Some banknotes in Perper had been issued in 1852 at par with the French Franc and Austrian Crown. After merging with Serbia in 1918, its monetary history followed Yugoslavia's. After the World War I, Yugoslavia adopted the Serbian Dinar as its currency with 1 Silver Dinar (YUS) equal to 4 Kronen (YUK). During the Italian occupation of Montenegro, Italian Lira (ITL) circulated.\n\nIn April 1945, Yugoslavia was liberated, and the Yugoslav Federation Dinar was introduced with official rates of exchange set at 1 Yugoslav Federation Dinar (YUF) equal to 40 Croatian Kuna or 20 Serbian Dinars, and 50 YUF equal to 1 US Dollar. On January 1, 1966, the Hard Dinar (YUD) replaced the Federation Dinar at the rate of 1 Hard Dinar equal to 100 Federation Dinara. Throughout this period, Yugoslavia had various currency controls which included, at various points in time, special rates for imports, exports, nonresident accounts, socialist transactions as well as black market rates.\n\nA Convertible Dinar (YUN) was introduced on January 1, 1990 at the rate of 1 Convertible Dinar equal to 10,000 Hard Dinara. A Reformed Dinar (YUR) was introduced on July 1, 1992 at the rate of 1 Reformed Dinar equal to 10 New Dinara. This issue was followed by the October Dinar (YUO), first issued on October 1, 1993 and equal to 1,000,000 Reformed Dinar, and the 1994 Dinar (YUG), first issued on January 1, 1994 and equal to 1,000,000,000 October Dinar. The 1994 Dinar was followed by the New Dinar (YUN) on January 24, 1994, which was issued separately from the 1994 Dinar and was equal to about 13 million 1994 Dinar by the end of January 1994.\n\nOn November 2, 1999, Montenegro made the Deutschemark (DEM) legal tender in Montenegro. The Law of the Central Bank of March 2001 made the Deutschemark the only legal means of payment, and on January 1, 2002, Montenegro replaced the Deutschemark with the Euro (EUR) as its legal tender currency. On February 4, 2003, the parliaments of Serbia and Montenegro voted to change their name from Yugoslavia to Serbia and Montenegro. The ISO codes were changed to SC and SCG for the union."
