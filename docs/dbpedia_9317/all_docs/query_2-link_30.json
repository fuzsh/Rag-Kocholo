        "text": "Austria\n\nBy November 1981, Austria had completed a transition to what was effectively an informal monetary union with Germany, comprising a tight, unilateral peg against the deutsche mark (DEM) at a rate of 7.03 Austrian schilling (ATS) per DEM. As can be seen in Figure 1, this rate coincided with the exchange rate between the two currencies at the beginning of 1970. From November 1981 until the adoption of the euro on January 1, 1999, it was maintained within the very narrow fluctuation margin of ±0.1 percent.\n\nFollowing the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, the following factors underpinned the decision of the Austrian authorities to maintain a tight peg against the DEM:5\n\n1. Austria’s policymakers traditionally exhibited a fundamental “fear of floating.” Because the foreign exchange market lacked depth, a floating exchange rate was considered susceptible to high volatility and, possibly, to longer-lasting exchange rate misalignments. Misalignments could undermine the domestic policy goal of structural adjustment and macroeconomic stability. Hence, appropriately tying the exchange rate of the ATS to that of a stable currency, that of Austria’s most important trading partner, was viewed as a way of improving competitiveness and, therefore, trade performance.\n\n2. Austria also had a deeply entrenched, historically motivated fear of inflation that precluded the use of the exchange rate as a tool for maintaining external price competitiveness. A pegged exchange rate (against a stable foreign currency) was viewed as a disciplinary device. Devaluations were regarded as counterproductive because, in the past, wage earners often reacted (rationally) to devaluation-induced price increases, leading to a vicious circle in the form of a wage-price spiral. In contrast, it was thought that pegging to a stable anchor currency would discipline employers and employees and anchor domestic policies. To maintain competitiveness on international markets, policies other than exchange rate adjustment—for instance, supply-side policies and wage restraint—would be required.\n\n3. At a very early stage, Austria’s policymakers emphasized that a peg of the ATS against the DEM would stabilize inflation expectations at a very low level, thereby helping to constrain wage pressures as well as raising Austria’s real growth potential.\n\n4. While the foregoing arguments precluded competitive devaluations, a view supporting occasional revaluations also emerged. Specifically, in a small, open economy, price stability could be imported through (temporary) real revaluations of the nominal exchange rate against the DEM.6 A large and quick pass-through from import prices to consumer prices would have a substantial dampening effect on inflation in the short run, which, in turn, would reduce inflation expectations, inducing a corresponding reaction by unions in wage demands and contracts. Thus, over the longer term, the equilibrium real exchange rate would be reestablished at the revalued nominal rate. In this context, an independent and conservative central bank, such as the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, was considered essential. It could signal sufficient “dryness” to earn the credibility required to influence union reactions (cf. Hochreiter and Winckler, 1994).\n\n5. While credibility could be temporarily borrowed, ultimately it needed to be earned. Policymakers as well as the social partners could earn credibility by supporting the creation of flexible markets and by fostering real wage flexibility. The role of the central bank was to maintain an anti-inflationary stance, even in turbulent times. Under these conditions, the authorities could enhance their credibility by maintaining the peg, even in the presence of asymmetric shocks.\n\nAustria’s economic history during the 1980s and at the start of the 1990s can be separated into two subperiods, 1981–85 and 1986–91. First, a subperiod of sluggish growth occurred during 1981–85, with real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging about 1.5 percent annually. The sluggish performance exposed the structural weaknesses of the Austrian economy, especially in the important nationalized industry sector. Second, from 1986 to 1991 the Austrian authorities took a number of actions to remedy these weaknesses. Policy reform measures included a well-balanced tax reform and credible medium term–oriented fiscal consolidation. Policy actions were supported by the accelerated liberalization of foreign transactions in line with the single-market provisions and by moderate wage settlements and were further aided in their effects by a favorable international economic environment. The result was strong, sustained, low-inflation growth without bottlenecks or other strains. Between 1988 and 1991, Austria’s annual real GDP growth accelerated to an annual rate of a little less than 4 percent.\n\nA decisive point for our analysis is the response of policymakers to the economic shocks that hit Austria during the period under consideration. As shown by Hochreiter and Winckler (1994), in the 1980s Austria was subjected to a variety of demand and supply shocks that were predominantly asymmetric relative to the German economy. Consequently, Austria did not form an optimum currency area (OCA) with Germany.7 To maintain the peg in the absence of significant labor mobility, wages needed to be flexible. In this regard, wages reacted to the shocks in the required manner, especially in the nationalized industry sector (foremost in the iron and steel industry), where, in addition to a general moderation of wage growth, there were some nominal wage cuts. Thus, the Austrian economy developed the necessary flexibility to sustain the informal monetary union, providing support for the view that OCA properties can be endogenous.8\n\nThe central bank’s policy was supported by a consistent government policy mix that included sound public finance. As a result, by the middle of the 1980s, interest-rate differentials with Germany narrowed, reaching a few basis points at the short end and 20 to 30 basis points at the long end. The narrowing of the interest rate differentials is prima facie evidence in support of the view that credibility of monetary policy can be acquired.\n\nAs far as the liberalization of capital account transactions is concerned, beginning in the 1970s, Austria followed a cautious, step-by-step approach (with some small reversals along the way). By November 1991, capital account liberalization had been completed. The results of this pragmatic approach toward dismantling foreign exchange restrictions implied that the economic effects were largely discounted by economic agents so that the measures did not cause unexpected shocks for financial institutions and monetary policy. In addition, the broad political consensus regarding the hard-currency policy, in association with the credibility the central bank had earned, made overall economic policies more consistent so that capital flows were not subject to sharp and abrupt reversals.9\n\nGreece\n\nThe main feature of the Greek economy from 1981 to 1992 was stagflation. Inflation persisted in the vicinity of 20 percent while real growth averaged only about 1.5 percent. While disinflationary monetary policies commenced in most industrial countries in the early 1980s, in Greece the ability to use monetary policy to reduce inflation was sharply curtailed by the obligation to finance large fiscal deficits with money creation. The general government deficit-to-GDP ratio jumped from around 2.5 percent in 1981 to around 8.5 percent in 1982; it averaged about 11 percent in the ensuing decade (i.e., through 1991). The government played an influential role in setting the objectives of monetary policy; together with an underdeveloped tax system, this circumstance provided a powerful incentive for money creation. Monetary and credit aggregates consistently reached double-digit growth rates, frequently exceeding their targets (see below), while real interest rates ex post were negative until 1987.\n\nThe accommodative macroeconomic policies led to a marked increase in the current account deficit and a rapid buildup of external debt in the first half of the 1980s, resulting in devaluations of the drachma (GRD) in both 1983 and 1985. In addition to the accommodative macroeconomic policies, the competitiveness of the economy and the growth of potential output were undermined by long-standing structural weaknesses such as a high concentration of industrial activity in declining traditional industries and the pervasiveness of rigidities and controls in labor and product markets and the financial system. These structural weaknesses became especially problematic after Greece acceded to the European Communities (EC) in January 1981. Participation in the EC meant that Greece had to compete on liberalized terms with other European economies that were more advanced (in terms of trade liberalization) and more efficient (see Table 2). The potential benefits from accession to the EC were limited by the large domestic and external imbalances. Weak growth and the structural weaknesses contributed to a rise in the unemployment rate from about 4 percent in 1981 to almost 10 percent in 1991.\n\nTable 2.\n\nAustria and Greece: Foreign Trade Shares, 1981–2001\n\nSources: Trade in goods: IMF Directions of Trade.

Note: EU = European Union (always refers to EU15); GDP = gross domestic product.\n\nWith regard to the framework for monetary policy, the Bank of Greece announced targets for monetary aggregates (for M0) beginning in 1975; in the early 1980s the bank placed increasing weight on broader aggregates, especially on M3. Three main factors contributed to a frequent overshooting of the targets: (1) as noted above, the obligation to finance the large fiscal deficits; (2) an unstable demand for money in light of innovations in financial services, sparked by higher rates of inflation;10 and (3) instruments of monetary policy that were not well developed, so that the supplies of the monetary aggregates were difficult to control. Monetary policy was disinflationary conducted through direct instruments of monetary control, which operated by setting or limiting either prices (interest rates) or quantities (amounts of credit outstanding) through regulations. To the extent that economic agents found ways to circumvent controls over time, the controls tended to lose their effectiveness. In practice, the bank found it useful to monitor a range of supplementary targets. One such indicator was the exchange rate. Following the 1985 devaluation of the GRD, the Bank of Greece adopted an implicit (i.e., unannounced) exchange rate target involving a sliding depreciation of the GRD. An implicit target was maintained until 1995, when an explicit exchange rate target was adopted (see below).\n\nAustria\n\nPolicymakers in Austria responded to the international economic slowdown with substantial fiscal easing. While increased public expenditure may have helped contain the economic downswing, it also entailed a sharp deterioration of the fiscal position. The general government deficit jumped from 2.0 percent in 1992 to 5.1 percent in 1995, far surpassing the Maastricht benchmark of 3.0 percent. The Austrian authorities struggled to find a solution to this situation; indeed, the issue led to the collapse of the government in 1995. By 1997, however, the budget deficit was reduced enough to satisfy the Maastricht criterion.\n\nWhat did the economic downturn, the loose fiscal policy, and the ERM crises imply for the sustainability of the Austrian informal monetary union with Germany? In contrast to other European currencies, the ATS was not affected by the currency crises of 1992 and 1993. This outcome was remarkable given the smallness and openness of the Austrian economy, the fixed peg, and fully liberalized capital account transactions. In our judgment, this outcome can be explained primarily by the accumulation of policy credibility, in general, and of monetary policy credibility, in particular. Additionally, the prospects for EU membership and the conclusion of the Maastricht Treaty in December 1992, which raised the prospects for the establishment of the single currency, increased the feasibility of disciplined stability-oriented government policies and strengthened the political will to pursue such policies.\n\nA relatively minor speculative attack on the ATS did occur, and the central bank reacted to maintain credibility. The attack took place in August 1993 and quickly dissipated, as it was based on erroneous information.12 Nevertheless, the episode cost the central bank approximately US$1.5 billion,13 the loss of which the bank—adhering to the rules of the game of a fixed exchange rate—did not offset. As a result, there was some tension in the money market. It was reflected on the respective Reuters pages, where interest rates on instruments with maturities of up to three months ceased being quoted. Short-term interest rates jumped on August 12 by some 20 percentage points, reaching 28 percent. The magnitude of the jump reflected the thinness of the Austrian money market.14 Official rates, however, were left unchanged. Market participants’ recognition that they had acted on erroneous information and the central bank’s resolve to adhere to the rules of the game ended the attack.\n\nYet the depreciations of several European currencies—particularly the Italian lira, the Swedish kronor, and the Finnish markka—following the EMS crisis affected the policy discussion in Austria. The broad consensus in Austria about the fixed peg lost support as some academics, industrialists (representing the most-affected manufacturing sectors: paper, forestry, and textiles), and representatives of the tourist industry called for a weakening of the ATS to restore international price competitiveness. While the criticism of the peg in the paper, forestry, and textile industries subsided in the light of an increase in profitability after sizable cost-cutting measures and, in some cases, restructuring, representatives of the competitively weak tourist industry continued to call for a softening of the peg. This demand was rebuffed by central bank authorities and representatives of the social partners, inter alia, on the grounds that such a move would run counter to the need of structural adjustment, which had become more urgent in view of Austria’s impending EU accession.\n\nAround the same time, however, a further argument for a hard peg emerged in some industries that were highly exposed to sharp exchange rate fluctuations against currencies other than the DEM. Instead of calling for a softening of the DEM peg, as they had in the past, representatives of those industries called for an acceleration of the move to stage 3 of the EMU because, in their view, it would lessen swings in the effective exchange rate, which had caused profits to be volatile.\n\nGreece\n\nIn the early 1990s Greece was saddled with macro-economic imbalances that were probably the largest among all industrial countries (OECD, 1990–91, p. 11). Thus, in 1991 inflation averaged about 20 percent, the fiscal-deficit-to-GDP ratio reached 16 percent, the current account deficit exceeded 8 percent of GDP, and real interest rates approached zero. The fiscal performance reflected in part a rapid increase in the relative size of the government in the economy over the previous 15 years. According to Moesen and Schollaert (2003), it also reflected a lack of trust in public sector institutions that resulted in generally low quality of public sector service provision.15 In response to the macroeconomic imbalances, incomes policy was tightened and the wage indexation system was abolished, contributing to a decline in weekly earnings in manufacturing (in real terms) on average from 1992 to 1994.\n\nWith regard to monetary policy, the annual growth rates of both M3 and domestic credit fell significantly from 1992 to 1994, compared with the rates of 1981–91. Still, M3 growth and domestic credit overshot their targeted ranges in both 1992 and 1993 as the fiscal-deficit-to-GDP ratio averaged about 12 percent of GDP. In addition to targeting M3 and the credit aggregates, the Bank of Greece set a rate of depreciation of the GRD that did not fully accommodate the inflation differential between Greece and the country’s main trading partners. This policy led to an appreciation of the real exchange rate, which, combined with a weak global environment, contributed to an average real GDP growth rate of only 1 percent from 1992 to 1994.\n\nThe tightened incomes policy, the appreciation of the real exchange rate, and weak economic growth led to a fall in inflation to low double-digit rates. Yet by 1994 it had become apparent that inflation contained a good deal of inertia. Thus, the annual rate of inflation in the year to December 1994 (10.6 percent) was essentially unchanged from the rates prevailing earlier in the year. Meanwhile, the large fiscal deficits contributed to real interest rates (ex post) that averaged about 5 percent from 1992 to 1994 and to a growing public debt.\n\nAs noted above, for much of the 1980s the financial system was highly regulated and monetary policy operated through direct instruments of monetary control, including directed credits, credit ceilings, and interest rate controls. Beginning in the mid-1980s, a series of deregulation measures allowed the financial markets to start to function more efficiently, permitting the gradual adoption (in the 1990s) of indirect instruments of monetary control. Financial liberalization, however, was a gradual process, reflecting the view that gradualism was necessary to avoid potentially destabilizing effects from a rapid elimination of regulations in an economy characterized by sizable macroeconomic imbalances (Papademos, 1992, p. 280). Thus, even in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the level and structure of interest rates were effectively influenced by the authorities through their control of interest rates on savings deposits, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of private deposits, and on government securities (Garganas, 1992, p. 133). Subsequently, indirect instruments, including a refinance facility, open market operations, and reserve requirements, were increasingly used (especially in the second half of the 1990s) to influence overall monetary and credit conditions by affecting the supply of, and demand for, liquidity, working through markets and the general level of interest rates. Indirect instruments permitted the authorities to have greater flexibility in policy implementation. Small, frequent changes in the instrument became feasible, enabling the authorities to respond rapidly to shocks.\n\nFinancial reform initially involved raising interest rates on deposits, loans, and government securities to market-clearing levels. This step was followed by the abolition of interest rate ceilings and the elimination of quantitative restrictions on credit allocation. Financial liberalization was accompanied by the lifting of foreign exchange controls, with the last vestige of capital controls removed in May 1994. Essentially, by 1995 financial deregulation was completed.\n\nAustria\n\nOn January 1, 1995, Austria became a member of the EU.16 In the context of EU accession, ERM issues regarding the timing of entry and the selection of the central rate membership needed to be resolved. A further issue (of importance for prospective EU members), the duration of the currency’s operation in the ERM, was not relevant at the time of Austria’s EU accession, as the date at which stage 3 of the EMU would be implemented was uncertain at the time.\n\nRegarding the timing of Austria’s ERM entry, there had long been a broad political consensus among social partners and politicians to enter into the core of the EMU uno actu with EU entry. In addition to the economic arguments discussed above, a political argument supported early participation in the ERM; specifically, Austrian authorities believed that participation would signal a strong commitment to European monetary unification. Also, the authorities could point to the long and successful peg to the DEM that underpinned the competitiveness and flexibility of the Austrian economy in support of early participation. Thus, in contrast to Finland and Sweden, which also joined the EU in 1995, Austria decided to accept the unconditional right to participate in the ERM with the normal band of ±15 percent upon accession.17\n\nWith regard to the central rate, the Austrian position was that the bilateral exchange rate of the ATS against the DEM was at, or at least close to, the equilibrium rate. Hence, in their multilateral negotiations the Austrian authorities sought to obtain agreement that the European Currency Unit (ECU)-denominated ERM central rate would be chosen in such a way that the prevailing bilateral ATS-DEM rate would be unaffected. The decision to base the ERM central rate on the bilateral rate against the DEM was made for both economic and political reasons. In particular, there was concern that participation in the ERM could be viewed as implying a regime shift to a higher-inflation exchange rate regime than of the informal monetary union with Germany. Against this background, Austrian policymakers felt that even the slightest hint of a regime shift could destabilize market expectations and induce capital outflows. Signaling “no change” was, therefore, an important aspect in the debate about ERM entry. It was this line of reasoning that also induced the Oesterreichische Nationalbank not to seek a special narrow-margin agreement with the Bundesbank, as was concluded by the ministers of finance and the central bank governors of the Netherlands and Germany on the occasion of the widening of the ERM fluctuation bands from those in 1993. The formal adoption of such a narrow margin could have been interpreted as a change in regime, despite (indeed, because of) the fact that the ATS-DEM exchange rate had remained essentially constant for nearly 15 years.\n\nParticipation of the ATS in the ERM in the following years was smooth; there was no question that Austria would fulfill the Maastricht exchange rate convergence, inflation, and interest rate criteria. There were, however, some doubts regarding Austria’s ability to abide by the fiscal criteria. As discussed above, Austria’s fiscal deficit soared in the aftermath of the economic slowdown of 1991/92. As a result, the public debt surpassed the critical 60 percent of GDP reference value contained in the treaty in 1993 and continued to rise until 1996, when it reached 69.2 percent, jeopardizing Austria’s ability to adopt the euro in the first wave. Despite the continued widespread domestic consensus in favor of meeting the Maastricht fiscal criteria on time, the collapse of the government in October 1995 reflected disagreements about the measures needed to consolidate the federal budget. The successor government, however, put in place a fiscal consolidation package that led to satisfaction of the Maastricht fiscal criteria in 1997. As a result, Austria was among the first wave of accession to the third stage of the EMU.\n\nThere remained the issue of the market participants’ perception of the country’s fiscal problems and chances of successful fiscal consolidation in time for the “Maastricht test.” Despite the earlier (i.e., beginning in 1992) move toward an expansive fiscal position and the collapse of a government (in 1995) over the issue, market expectations were that the fiscal situation would be corrected. Nonetheless, the interest rate differential between Austrian long-term government debt and German government debt briefly rose by some 10 to 20 basis points in 1995, reaching a maximum of 30 basis points in November of that year (which was, nevertheless, a small difference given the adverse developments). The markets took account of the overall sound fiscal policy the Austrian government had pursued since the beginning of the informal monetary union in 1981 and—using this experience to extrapolate expectations—concluded that the fiscal laxness from 1992 to 1995 was temporary.\n\nGreece\n\nBy 1994, other EU economies—as well as prospective EU members, such as Austria—had made substantial progress in their quests to achieve nominal convergence and become members of the EMU. Greece, however, was falling farther and farther behind them. For example, in 1994 Greek inflation was more than double the rates experienced in such formerly high-inflation EU countries as Italy, Portugal, and Spain, and the fiscal deficit (as a percentage of GDP) was considerably higher in Greece than in any of those countries. Clearly, if the EMU was to be a realistic medium-term target, a regime change was necessary. It came in 1995. The signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the government’s publicly stated objective of joining the euro area provided powerful incentives for mobilizing broad public support for policy adjustment.\n\nTo focus expectations, beginning in 1995, the Bank of Greece adopted a “hard drachma” policy under which the exchange rate was used as a nominal anchor. For the first time, the bank announced a specific exchange rate target. Underlying this policy was the belief that the adoption of a visible anchor could enhance the credibility of the bank’s disinflation effort. With the exchange rate pegged at an appropriate level, inflation could be brought down rapidly because of (1) the stabilization of prices in the traded goods sector, (2) the attendant restraint imposed on wage- and price-setting behavior, and (3) the restraint imposed on government spending.18\n\nThe hard drachma policy was an application of the Barro-Gordon (1983) model of an open economy. Barro and Gordon (1983) sought to explain the route through which a positive inflation rate can exist, on average, even when long-run real economic performance does not seem to be correlated with expansionary policies. They contend that the public views policymaking as opportunistic. The next election is never far away, and policymakers are tempted to improve the situation in the short run at the cost of higher inflation in the long run. Thus, policymakers are willing to manufacture an unexpected expansion in macroeconomic policy even in the absence of a long-run trade-off between unemployment and inflation. Assuming that the public has rational expectations (so that inflation cannot come as a surprise on average) and that the government values both price stability and high employment, this explanation yields the following strong policy conclusions: (1) the policymakers do not succeed in surprising—or cheating—the public systematically (and, thus, do not permanently increase employment); and (2) the actual and expected rates of inflation are higher than the inflation rate that would prevail if the policymakers could credibly precommit.\n\nIn an open economy context, the credibility hypothesis implies that policymakers in a high-inflation economy can make credible their intentions to reduce inflation by pegging their exchange rate to the currency of a low-inflation economy. If the exchange rate commitment is credible, so that it is really believed in the goods, labor, and foreign exchange markets, then the unemployment and output costs of the restrictive policies will be reduced. The credibility hypothesis emphasizes that, if credible, the use of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor may discipline both policymakers and private agents (Corden, 1994, pp. 76–84; Tavlas, 2000). When expectations of the latter are changed, the costs of attaining a low-inflation equilibrium are reduced.\n\nIn the implementation of the hard drachma policy from 1995 to 1997, the bank set annual inflation objectives. To attain these objectives, specific targets for the exchange rate were announced in 1995 and 1996 (3 percent and 1 percent depreciations, respectively, against the currencies of EU trading partners) and achieved. In 1997, the intermediate objective was defined as a stable nominal ECU/GRD exchange rate, and it was also achieved. Although the exchange rate was the main intermediate policy objective, in the three years 1995–97, the bank also announced projections for broad money growth and total credit expansion, which were viewed either as supplementary intermediate targets compatible with the inflation objective or as supplementary indicators (or information variables) of the monetary policy stance. However, policy instruments (e.g., interest rates) were set primarily to ensure the stability of the exchange rate, which was judged to be the most effective intermediate means of reducing inflation.\n\nDuring the first three years of the hard drachma policy, inflation was more than halved (from over 10 percent in 1995 to under 5 percent by the end of 1997). Indicative of the stance of monetary policy and the large but declining (as a percentage of GDP) fiscal deficits in the three years through 1997, nominal and real (ex post) interest rates remained very high. Correspondingly, the real effective exchange rate (measured on the basis of relative unit labor costs) appreciated by about 17 percent, implying a reduction of competitiveness (see below). Although inflation fell sharply, real growth accelerated; real GDP growth averaged about 2.8 percent from 1995 to 1997 compared with 1.0 percent from 1992 to 1994.\n\nWhy did real growth accelerate during a period when inflation fell from a moderate level to single digits? Although the credibility gain is difficult to quantify, the hard drachma policy provided an unambiguous target for monetary policy, exerting a measure of self-discipline and tying down inflation expectations. Other factors also strengthened credibility. First, substantial fiscal adjustment occurred. Relative to GDP, the fiscal deficit fell from about 10 percent in 1995 to around 4 percent in 1997. Measures to increase the efficiency of tax collection were stepped up so that seigniorage became a less significant source of revenue. The prohibition of monetary financing of the public sector borrowing requirement (in 1994) increased the scope for monetary control.19 Second, with the complete deregulation of the financial system by 1995, the Bank of Greece was increasingly able to use interventions that were flexible and reduced the operational costs of monitoring and controlling incurred by the bank of other financial institutions. Third, the Greek parliament approved central bank independence and provided the Bank of Greece with a mandate to achieve price stability. The law granting central bank independence gave the bank control over exchange rate policy within a framework agreed to with the government. Although the legislation was not approved until December 1997, the markets had been told of its impending enactment well in advance, providing an unambiguous signal that a regime shift was in process.\n\nYet, as is typically the case with nominal-anchor exchange rate pegs, this regime produced difficulties. Conducting an independent monetary policy with an exchange rate peg and an open capital account became increasingly demanding. The wide interest rate differentials in favor of GRD-denominated financial instruments led to a capital inflow problem. The Bank of Greece responded by sterilizing these inflows, limiting the appreciation of the nominal exchange rate, reducing the impact of the inflows on the monetary base, and buying time for other policies to adjust. Still, the sterilization entailed quasi-fiscal costs and, by keeping domestic interest rates at high levels, tended to maintain the yield differential that had given rise to the inflows. Additionally, the Greek economy experienced a fundamental problem associated with all nominal-anchor exchange rate pegs during the move to lower inflation; as noted above, the real exchange rate appreciated significantly, contributing, along with strong domestic demand, to a widening current account deficit.\n\nThe open economy Barro-Gordon model was a double-edged sword. In Greece, as elsewhere, while the nominal anchor provided by the exchange rate brought down inflation, during the transition to low inflation the anchor generated an appreciation of the real exchange rate. In the case of Greece, the appreciation reduced competitiveness, contributing to a widening current account deficit.\n\nThese problems came to a head at the end of 1997 and in early 1998. The widening current account deficit, combined with rapid wage growth, fed market perceptions that the GRD was overvalued and provided the basis for contagion from Asia, which commenced with the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997. The sharp rise in interest rates required to support the GRD increasingly undermined growth and fiscal targets. A further regime shift was needed. That regime shift was provided by the ERM. Effective March 16, 1998, the GRD joined the ERM at a central rate that implied a 12.3 percent devaluation against the ECU (central rate: ECU 1 = GRD 353.109; see Figure 2). The devaluation of the GRD was both backward-looking and forward-looking; the magnitude of the devaluation took account of past inflation differentials between Greece and other EU countries and prospective differentials in the period leading up to Greece’s expected entry into the euro area. Thus, the new central rate was meant to be sustainable. Also, a package of supportive fiscal and structural measures was announced. Efforts to restructure public enterprises were stepped up. The measures aimed to support the sustainability of the GRD’s new central rates.\n\nUnlike many other devaluations of the mid- and late 1990s, the GRD’s devaluation was followed by neither further rounds of speculative attacks nor a financial crisis. Unlike other devaluations, it was followed by not contraction but expansion in economic activity. Moreover, and again in contrast with the other devaluations of this period, the impact of the GRD’s devaluation on inflation was strictly contained. What accounts for the GRD’s successful exit from one pegged rate to another? The key ingredients of the successful devaluation were as follows:\n\nUnlike other currencies that were devalued during the mid- and late 1990s, the GRD exited a unilateral peg and entered a systems arrangement, benefiting from the credibility of the ERM.\n\nFiscal tightening continued following the devaluation. Labor market policy gradually adjusted to the necessity of fiscal discipline, which enhanced international competitiveness.\n\nPrudential regulation and supervision of the banking system were strictly enforced so that there was no net foreign exposure of the banking system. Thus, there was no currency-mismatching problem—that is, large, uncovered foreign currency positions that, under conditions of currency devaluations, raise the debt burden of domestic foreign currency borrowers, increasing the probability of bankruptcies and financial crises. In addition to placing the Bank of Greece’s disinflation strategy within a new institutional framework that gave it added credibility, the ERM provided another important advantage. Entry at the standard fluctuation bands of ±15 percent provided the bank ample room for maneuver. Thus, when capital inflows resumed following ERM entry, the bank allowed the exchange rate to appreciate relative to its central rate, helping to maintain its tight monetary policy stance and to contain the inflationary impact of the devaluation. The exchange rate remained above its central rate throughout the rest of 1998 and for all of 1999. In 1999, for example, the GRD traded (on average) 7.7 percent above its central rate while, for most of that year, the three-month interbank rate stood about seven hundred basis points above the corresponding German rate (see Figures 2 and 3). As a result of the tightened and consistent policy mix, inflation reached a low of 2 percent (annual rate) during the second half of 1999. Then, to limit the degree of depreciation that would be required for the market rate of the GRD to reach its central rate and the resulting inflationary pressures, the central rate was revalued by 3.5 percent in January 2000 (new central rate: EUR 1 = GRD 340.75). Having fulfilled all the Maastricht criteria, on January 1, 2001, Greece became the twelfth member of the euro area."
