United States Government Accountability Office: GAO: Report to the Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, and the Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives: March 2008: International Trade: U.S. Trade Preference Programs Provide Important Benefits, but a More Integrated Approach Would Better Ensure Programs Meet Shared Goals: GAO-08-443: GAO Highlights: Highlights of GAO-08-443, a report to the Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, and Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives. Why GAO Did This Study: U.S. trade preference programs promote economic development in poorer nations by providing export opportunities. The Generalized System of Preferences, Caribbean Basin Initiative, Andean Trade Preference Act, and African Growth and Opportunity Act unilaterally reduce U.S. tariffs for many products from over 130 countries. However, three of these programs expire partially or in full this year, and Congress is exploring options as it considers renewal. GAO was asked to review the programs� effects on the United States and on foreign beneficiaries� exports and development, identify policy trade-offs concerning these programs, and evaluate the overall U.S. approach to preference programs. To address these objectives, we analyzed trade data, reviewed trade literature and program documents, interviewed U.S. officials, and did fieldwork in six countries. What GAO Found: Overall, trade preference programs have a small effect on the U.S. economy. Some U.S. industries have shared-production arrangements with foreign producers that depend on preference benefits, while others compete with preference imports. Preference programs are used to advance U.S. goals, such as intellectual property rights protection. Developing countries extensively use preferential access to boost exports to the United States. Preference imports have grown faster than overall U.S. imports, and recent changes in product coverage have expanded beneficiaries� export opportunities. Gaps in duty-free access continue for sectors such as agriculture and apparel. Preference exports remain concentrated in a few countries and products, but trends indicate greater diversification and increased use by the poorest countries. Those GAO interviewed in beneficiary countries also stressed the benefits derived from preferences. Preference programs balance two key policy trade-offs. First, programs offer duty-free access to the U.S. market to increase beneficiaries� trade, while attempting not to harm U.S. industries. Second, Congress faces a trade-off between longer program renewals, which may encourage investment, and shorter renewals, which may provide more opportunities to change the programs to meet evolving priorities. Finally, some beneficiary countries� concerns over the eroding value of preferences must be weighed against the likely greater economic benefits of broader trade liberalization. Trade preference programs have proliferated over time, becoming more complex (as shown below), but neither Congress nor the interagency Trade Policy Staff Committee that manages the programs has formally considered them as a whole. Responsive to their legal mandates, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and other agencies use different approaches to monitor compliance with program criteria, resulting in disconnected review processes and gaps in reporting on some countries and issues. Separate reporting and examination also hinder measuring programs� contribution to economic development.

[End of figure] What GAO Recommends: GAO recommends that USTR periodically review beneficiary countries that have not been considered under the regional programs. Additionally, USTR should periodically convene relevant agencies to discuss the programs jointly. Congress should consider whether trade preference programs� review and reporting requirements may be better integrated to facilitate evaluating progress in meeting shared economic development goals.

Rangel: Chairman: Committee on Ways and Means: House of Representatives: In an effort to promote and achieve various U.S. foreign policy objectives, trade preference programs have expanded in number and scope over the past three decades. The purpose of these programs is to foster economic development through increased trade in qualified beneficiary countries while not harming U.S. domestic producers. The trade preferences, which reduce tariffs, or duties, for many products from eligible countries, are \"nonreciprocal\"--they are granted unilaterally, without requiring reciprocal liberalization for U.S. goods for countries receiving them. Currently, the United States offers the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and three regional programs, the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). As we noted in our previous report on U.S. trade preference programs,[Footnote 1] these programs represent a small share of total U.S. imports, but they constitute a significant share of many beneficiary countries' exports to the United States. Imports under U.S. preference programs have grown sharply since 2002. In 2006, imports through U.S. trade preference programs totaled approximately $92 billion--about 5 percent of total U.S. goods imports. However, while U.S. preference programs are widely used, concerns exist about perceived shortcomings in these programs. For example, frequent program lapses and renewals have created uncertainty about program availability, and questions have been raised about effectiveness. This year, three preference programs expire partially or in full; as a result, Congress is exploring options for improvements as it considers program renewal. At your request, in this report, we (1) describe how U.S. preference programs affect the United States, (2) review the effects of U.S. preference programs on foreign beneficiaries' exports and development, (3) identify the trade-offs policymakers face with respect to U.S. preference programs, and (4) evaluate the overall U.S. approach to preference programs. To address these objectives, we reviewed and analyzed U.S. laws and regulations and authoritative international trade documents. We analyzed official U.S. trade data and we spoke with officials from agencies participating in the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC)-- including the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR)--and reviewed and analyzed documentation we received from the agencies. We conducted a literature search on the impacts of U.S. preference programs on the United States and on foreign beneficiaries. We attended the sixth AGOA Forum in Accra, Ghana, in July 2007. We also traveled to Brazil, Colombia, Haiti, Kazakhstan, and Turkey to meet with U.S. embassy officials, foreign officials, and industry groups using U.S. preference programs. We selected at least one country from each of the preference programs based on income levels according to the World Bank and United Nations and the spectrum of issues related to usage and capacity of each of the programs in-country (for more information on the how we selected these countries, see the full scope and methodology in app. I). We conducted this performance audit from March 2007 to February 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Results in Brief: Overall, the effect of trade preference programs on the U.S. economy is small. Nevertheless, preference programs have economic effects on U.S. businesses, consumers, and the federal budget, and they provide an opportunity to advance U.S. trade and foreign policy. Effects on U.S. industries and individual businesses vary, as some have shared- production arrangements with foreign producers that depend heavily on duty-free preference benefits, while others compete with imports benefiting from preferences. U.S. consumers benefit to the extent that tariff savings result in lower prices on some products. Program costs include the loss of tariff revenues that would otherwise accrue to the U.S. Treasury. Preference programs have been used to advance U.S. foreign policy goals in areas such as intellectual property, labor, and human rights, as well as on broader market-oriented and democratic governance reforms. Periodic reviews under some of the programs provide the United States leverage to engage with governments and motivate policy change. By providing new opportunities, preferences can increase U.S. imports from developing countries and thus promote their economic development. Our analysis of U.S. tariff and trade data shows that U.S. trade preference programs now offer relatively extensive opportunities to many developing countries to increase their sales to the United States and have resulted in increased and somewhat more diversified U.S. imports from them. Gaps in product and associated duty-free coverage persist, continuing to limit beneficiaries' export options, in sectors such as agriculture and apparel; however, some key products that would otherwise face high tariffs have been added to regional programs, increasing their likely benefit to development. Available preferences are highly used by most partners, particularly countries that have access to regional programs. Fuel now accounts for more than half of the value of preference trade, but expansion of programs also appears to have helped the poorest countries increase their share of total preference exports. Nevertheless, some countries lack capacity to take advantage of the available preference opportunities. For example, 34 of the 46 beneficiaries designated as \"least-developed\" barely used U.S. preferences in 2006. Nevertheless, those we met in the varied range of beneficiary countries visited stressed the benefits they derive from preferences and the importance of continuing them to their trade and development. The nature and evolution of the U.S. trade preference programs require trade-offs among competing policy goals. One key trade-off balances the programs' goals of aiming to expand U.S. imports from developing countries and of not harming U.S. industries. Balancing this tension has, in some cases, resulted in products of importance to developing countries being excluded from preference programs. Attempts to target preferential trade opportunities to the poorest countries, while phasing out benefits to more competitive countries, may benefit countries other than those targeted. A second trade-off concerns the periodic renewal of program benefits. Private sector representatives have indicated that giving programs longer renewal periods or making them permanent would help beneficiaries attract the investment necessary to derive significant development benefits from the programs. However, program renewals offer an opportunity to engage with beneficiary countries on broader policy goals. Finally, the balancing of these trade-offs takes place against a backdrop of increasing global trade liberalization--a primary U.S. trade objective--which makes the benefits of preference programs less consequential to beneficiaries. Some developing countries have cited this concern in resisting liberalization, even though evidence suggests that, in many cases, there are greater economic benefits from trade openness compared with the costs associated with erosion of preferences. Separate approaches to preference programs impede assessing whether they are meeting their collective goal of economic development for beneficiary countries. Over time, trade preference programs have increased in number and complexity, but Congress and the interagency TPSC that manages the programs consider them separately. While following statutory requirements, agencies' approaches to monitoring compliance with program criteria nevertheless result in disconnected review processes that are separate from ongoing U.S. efforts to protect intellectual property rights, such as the Special 301 Review, and to combat trafficking in persons; they also result in gaps in reporting on some countries. For example, the TPSC may not review countries under the preference programs that are not beneficiaries of a regional program against the eligibility criteria for a long period of time. Based on statutory directions and available resources, the U.S. government also pursues different approaches to trade capacity building in conjunction with the various trade preference programs, with AGOA having the clearest statutory direction. Different approaches agencies use to report on these programs impede an integrated assessment of progress made under U.S. trade preferences to foster development in beneficiary countries. As Congress deliberates on whether to renew the ATPA, Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA), and GSP programs this calendar year, it should consider whether a more integrated approach would better ensure programs meet shared goals. Specifically, Congress should consider which elements of the approaches used by agencies to administer these programs, such as petition-initiated compliance reviews or periodic assessment of all countries under certain programs, have benefits that may be applied more broadly to trade preference programs in general. Congress should consider streamlining various program reporting requirements to facilitate evaluating the programs' progress in meeting their shared economic development goal. We are recommending in this report that USTR periodically review preference beneficiaries that have not otherwise been reviewed by virtue of their membership in the regional programs. Additionally, USTR should periodically convene the TPSC to discuss the programs jointly to determine what lessons can be learned from the various provisions concerning matters such as linkages to trade capacity building. USTR should also work through the TPSC and its associated agencies to consider ways to administer, evaluate, and report on preference programs in a more integrated manner to ensure the programs, as a whole, meet their shared goals. We provided draft copies of this report to USTR, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State, and Treasury. USTR and the Departments of Agriculture, Labor, Commerce, Treasury, and State provided extensive technical comments on an interagency basis. Customs, Labor, State, and ITC also provided separate technical comments. We have incorporated these comments where appropriate. USTR indicated that it would report on the actions taken in response to the recommendations in a letter, within 60 days of public issuance of this report, as required under U.S. law. Background: The United States extends unilateral tariff reductions to over 130 developing countries through one general trade preference program (GSP) and three regional programs--CBI, ATPA, and AGOA (see table 1). The preference programs are tools that the U.S. government uses to assist countries in the developing world.

It was initially established in 1983 through CBERA, Pub. L. No. 98-67, Title II, 97 Stat. 384 (1983) and expanded in 1990 by the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Expansion Act, Pub. L. No. 101-382, Title II, 104 Stat. 655. It was substantially expanded in 2000 by CBTPA, Pub. L. No. 106-200, Title II, 114 Stat. 275 (2000). The most recent change to CBI was made by the HOPE Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-432, Div. D., Title V, 120 Stat. 3181 (2006). In this report, we at times describe HOPE separately from CBI to illustrate the key characteristics of HOPE. [B] Pub. L. No. 102-182, Title II, 105 Stat. 1236, as amended. ATPA was substantially expanded in 2002 by ATPDEA, Pub. L. No. 107-210, Div. C. Title XXXI, 116 Stat 1023 (2002) and amended in 2006 by the Andean Trade Preferences Extension Act, Pub. L. No. 109-432, Div. D, Title VII, 120 Stat. 3194 (2006). [C] Pub. L. No. 106-200, Title I, 114 Stat. 252 (2000), as amended. [End of table] At the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 1964, developing countries asserted that one of the major impediments to their accelerated economic growth and development was their inability to compete with developed countries in the international trading system; the developing countries argued that preferential tariffs would allow them to increase exports and foreign exchange earnings necessary to diversify their economies and reduce dependence on foreign aid. The rationale for trade preferences was that poorer countries need to develop industrial capacity for manufacturing in order to move away from dependence on imports and production of traditional commodities that could be subject to declining prices in the long term. It was argued that poorer countries also needed time to retain some protection to develop their \"infant industries,\" but that increases in exports would be necessary to help countries capture economies of scale in production and earn foreign exchange. In addition, it was evident that some provision for the elimination of preferences once the industries were firmly established was necessary. The argument was that trade preferences should be temporary, introduced for a period of no less than 10 years with respect to any given industry in any developing country. At the end of the 10-year period, preferences would be withdrawn unless it could be shown that special circumstances warranted their continuation. At the second UNCTAD conference in New Delhi in 1968, the United States joined other participants in supporting a resolution to establish a mutually acceptable system of preferences. In order to permit the implementation of the generalized preferences, in June 1971 the developed countries, including the United States, were granted a 10- year waiver from their obligations under the global trading system, now embodied in the World Trade Organization (WTO), to trade on a most favored nation (MFN)[Footnote 2] basis. Following the granting of this waiver, developed countries created their GSP programs, and Congress enacted the U.S. GSP program in January 1975. The United States maintained that GSP was a temporary program to advance trade liberalization in the developing world, but it recognized the need to address the legal basis for granting these preferences, in anticipation of the expiration of the waiver in 1981. An agreement was reached at the 1979 conclusion of the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, known as the \"Enabling Clause,\" which has no expiration date and replaces the waiver. Because the Enabling Clause applies to preference regimes that are \"generalized, non-reciprocal, and non- discriminatory,\" separate waivers have been sought for U.S. regional preference programs.[Footnote 3] The GSP program seeks to accelerate economic growth and development in developing countries by providing access to the U.S. market. GSP establishes a basic level of product coverage common to all the preference programs. Over the years, Congress has also enacted a series of regional trade preference programs that have evolved to address U.S. foreign policy objectives beyond the shared general objective of promoting economic development. The regional programs expand on GSP to cover additional products that are not covered by GSP, including some apparel, footwear, and certain leather-related products. While regional programs may generally have more liberal conditions for product entry than GSP, these differences are more likely to affect products for which countries cannot receive GSP benefits (e.g., textiles and apparel). CBI was created to promote economic and political stability in the Central America and Caribbean region, to diversify exports, and to expand trade between those countries and the United States. ATPA was established to combat drug production and trafficking by providing sustainable economic alternatives to beneficiary countries in the Andean region of South America. AGOA was set up to facilitate Sub- Saharan Africa's integration into the global economy. The regional preference programs have some eligibility criteria that overlap with GSP, but the regional programs also set forth additional eligibility criteria that are not part of the GSP statute. In order to be eligible for AGOA, a country must also be eligible for GSP. In addition, all preference programs contain certain common eligibility requirements, such as having national policies to ensure workers' rights and protect intellectual property. Regional program beneficiary countries are subject to more extensive eligibility criteria than GSP beneficiary countries. For example, ATPA requires cooperation with U.S. counternarcotics and antiterrorism efforts, and AGOA requires that countries be making progress toward political pluralism and not commit gross violations of human rights. Eight agencies have key roles in administering U.S. trade preference programs. Led by USTR, they include the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Labor, State, and Treasury, as well as ITC. USTR utilizes an interagency mechanism, the TPSC, and its associated subcommittees to consult and coordinate with these and other agencies such as USAID. This year, ATPA,[Footnote 4] CBTPA,[Footnote 5] and GSP[Footnote 6] expire, and Congress will need to explore the option of renewing these programs. At the same time, legislative proposals to provide additional, targeted benefits for the poorest countries are pending. In addition to examining the benefits trade preference programs provide, Congress will need to consider concerns by beneficiary and other developing countries, industry groups, and economic experts surrounding these programs. Such concerns include the potential for diversion of trade from other countries that these programs can cause; the complexity, scope of coverage, certainty, and conditionality of these programs; and the potential opposition to multilateral and bilateral import liberalization that preference programs can create. Preference Programs Have Some Economic Effects on the United States and Provide an Opportunity to Advance U.S. Foreign Policy: The overall effects of trade preference programs on the U.S. economy are small, but preference programs have direct effects on U.S. businesses, consumers, and the federal budget. Effects on U.S. industries and individual businesses vary; some have shared-production arrangements with preference beneficiaries, while a few U.S. industries compete with imports benefiting from preferences. U.S. consumers have benefited from lower prices resulting from duty-free imports under trade preference programs, while tariff revenues to the U.S. Treasury have been lower because of foregone tariff revenues. In addition, preference programs serve as a tool to advance U.S. foreign policy objectives. The Overall Effect of Trade Preference Programs on the U.S. Economy Is Small: Imports under preference programs represent a small share of total U.S. imports. As shown in table 2, U.S. preference imports across all programs accounted for about 5 percent of U.S. imports in 2006. Table 2: U.S. Preference Imports, 2006 (Dollars in billions): Total preference imports[A]: $36 (AGOA); Percentage of U.S. imports: 2%. Total preference imports[A]: $33 (GSP); Percentage of U.S. imports: 1.8. Total preference imports[A]: $13 (ATPA); Percentage of U.S. imports: 0.7. Total preference imports[A]: $10 (CBI); Percentage of U.S. imports: 0.5. Total U.S. imports: $1,845; Total preference imports[A]: $92; Percentage of U.S. imports: 5%. Source: GAO analysis of official U.S.trade statistics. [A] CBI includes CBTPA imports, and ATPA includes ATPDEA imports. Shares are based on dollar value of imports. Program values are based on preferences actually claimed upon entry. [End of table] In general, studies of the effects of preference programs on the U.S. economy find that the overall impact is small. For example, the ITC consistently finds in its biennial reports on ATPA[Footnote 7] and CBI[Footnote 8] that the impact of imports from these programs on the U.S. economy is minor. In the most recent ITC reports on ATPA and CBI, ITC reported again that the overall effect of imports from these programs on the U.S. economy continued to be negligible, representing only 0.09 percent and 0.10 percent, respectively, of the U.S. gross domestic product in 2005. Similarly, in January 2008, the Congressional Research Service concluded that the overall effects of GSP on the U.S. economy are relatively small and that the rate of increase of imports entering under GSP in the past 10 years is relatively flat, indicating that there may be little impact on the U.S. market as a whole by extending these preferences.[Footnote 9] Trade Preference Programs Have Direct Effects on Some U.S. Businesses, Consumers, and the Federal Budget: Businesses: Some U.S. industries and individual businesses have shared-production arrangements with foreign producers that depend heavily on duty-free preference benefits. Over the last two decades, U.S. producers of apparel have come to rely on \"outward processing arrangements.\" In such arrangements, U.S. factories focus on relatively capital-intensive operations, such as fabric production. Fabrics and components are then shipped to CBI, ATPA, or AGOA countries, where factories conduct the relatively labor-intensive business of assembling the finished garments. In addition, U.S. manufacturers and importers benefit from the lower cost of consumer goods and raw materials imported under preference programs, such as jewelry, leather, and aluminum imported through GSP. Furthermore, U.S. manufacturers also rely on and benefit from intermediate goods from preference beneficiary countries. For example, Brazil is a major user of GSP. In 2006, 10 percent of all nonfuel imports to the United States from all preference programs came from Brazil.[Footnote 10] Much of what Brazil ships to the United States under GSP are intermediate goods produced by U.S.-affiliated multinational companies. Once exported to the United States, these goods are further processed or incorporated into U.S.-manufactured goods such as cars and power generators. Given the importance of these intermediate goods to domestic manufacturers, the Congressional Research Service reported that an expiration or modification of GSP would directly affect them, at least in the short term. Smaller U.S. businesses that regularly import inputs under a preference program may be especially affected by a lapse or expiration of the program because they rely on GSP's duty savings to compete with much larger companies, and they are less able to adjust to increased costs. A wide range of U.S. companies submitted official comments to USTR on several countries during an overall review of GSP in 2006.[Footnote 11] For example, concerning GSP imports from Thailand, U.S. companies' comments were overwhelmingly positive and supported continued preferential treatment for imports that included items such as jewelry, bottle-grade polyethylene terephthalate resin, motor vehicle tires, microwave ovens, ophthalmic lenses, televisions, cookware, golf equipment, and tuna. On the other hand, certain other U.S. industries compete with imports benefiting from preferences. For example, ITC estimates that U.S. methanol producers may have experienced displacement of between 5.2 percent and 10.1 percent of production, valued at $27.6 million to $54.2 million in 2006, because of methanol imports from CBI countries. ITC also found that U.S. asparagus, fresh cut roses, chrysanthemums, carnations, and anthuriums may have experienced displacement of more than 5 percent of the value of production in 2005 because of imports that receive ATPA preferences. However, product coverage of the preference programs is dynamic, based on statutory provisions. Based on thresholds added by the legislation passed by Congress in December 2006 when it extended the GSP program, the President removed GSP duty-free treatment for methanol from Venezuela. Consumers: U.S. consumers benefit to the extent that tariff savings result in lower prices on final products, as well as from the lower costs of intermediate goods. U.S. importers of goods who import duty-free components, parts, or materials under GSP maintain that the preference results in lower costs for these intermediate goods that, in turn, can be passed on to consumers. In a May 1, 2006, letter to the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees, a coalition of importers and retailers stated that if GSP were allowed to expire or its benefits were reduced, it \"would impose a costly hardship on not only beneficiary countries but their American customers as well.\" As part of biennial reviews of CBI and ATPA, ITC assessed the effects of these programs on the U.S. economy, industries, and consumers.[Footnote 12] Following are illustrative (not comprehensive) single-year examples extracted from the most recent ITC reports on CBI and ATPA, highlighting products where U.S. consumers benefited: * ITC found that, in 2006, knitted cotton T-shirts provided the largest gain in consumer surplus[Footnote 13] ($63.7 million to $68.5 million) resulting exclusively from CBI tariff preferences. The price U.S. consumers would have paid for imports of such T-shirts from CBI countries would have been 12 percent higher without CBI. Men's and boys' woven cotton trousers or shorts provided the second-largest gain in consumer surplus ($56.7 million to $62.3 million). Without CBI, the import price of such woven cotton trousers or shorts from CBI countries would have been 15 percent higher. * ITC found that, in 2005, men's or boys' knitted shirts provided the largest gain in consumer surplus ($30 million to $34 million) from lower prices and higher consumption resulting exclusively from ATPA tariff preferences. Federal Budget: In December 2006, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued cost estimates associated with the extension of GSP, ATPA, and AGOA and the enactment of HOPE under the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006,[Footnote 14] including the loss of tariff revenues that would otherwise accrue to the U.S. Treasury. In the multiyear review, CBO came to the following conclusions: * Changes to the GSP program will result in an estimated reduction in revenues of $297 million in 2007 and of $992 million over the 2007 to 2009 period. This estimated reduction of revenue is due to the extension of GSP to December 31, 2008, and the new provisions concerning competitive need limit waivers. In addition, CBO estimated in its \"Budget Outlook\" for fiscal years 2007 to 2016 that revenue losses would amount to about $3.1 billion if GSP were extended to 2011. * The extension of ATPA to June 30, 2007, was estimated to result in a decrease in revenues of $25 million in 2007. The most recent ATPA extension to December 31, 2008, will result in $119 million in reduced revenues in 2008 and 2009, according to a February 2008 CBO cost estimate. * AGOA will result in an estimated reduction in revenues of about $2 million in 2007, $127 million over the 2007 to 2011 period, and $180 million over the 2007 to 2016 period. * The enactment of HOPE will result in an estimated reduction of $4 million in 2007, and $28 million over the 2007 to 2011 period. Without econometric analysis, it may be difficult to determine whether, absent preferences, the same volume of goods would still be exported to the United States. If no or a reduced volume of exports occurs without the preferences, less tariff revenue would be foregone. Preference Programs Have Significance as a Tool to Advance U.S. Foreign Policy: Preference programs have been used to advance U.S. foreign policy goals in areas such as intellectual property protection, labor, and human rights, as well as on broader market-oriented and democratic governance reforms. Some supporters of GSP and other nonreciprocal preferences believe that the country practice criteria that developing countries must meet if they are to qualify for GSP provide the United States with political leverage that can be used to support U.S. foreign and commercial interests. Periodic and petition-initiated reviews under the programs provide the United States the opportunity to engage with governments and motivate policy change. As we noted in our previous report,[Footnote 15] these reviews serve to encourage beneficiary countries to comply with country eligibility criteria, such as the extent to which the country is providing adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights (IPR), taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights, and implementing its commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. For example, GSP has annual reviews of country and product eligibility, based on petitions (requests) filed with USTR concerning GSP beneficiary countries and products by U.S. industry groups, governments, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) such as labor unions.[Footnote 16] According to USTR, the United States works with a beneficiary country during a country practice review before removing it from eligibility. Our review of agency records and meetings with officials and interest groups indicate that the leverage associated with preferences creates an opportunity to secure improvements in IPR and labor protections. Regional trade preference programs also serve important foreign policy interests. For example, ATPA complements counternarcotics efforts by providing opportunities for legal crops to be exported to the U.S. market, thus encouraging farmers to shift away from coca and heroin poppy production. Similar to GSP, ATPA also has an annual review of country eligibility practices, based on petitions filed against beneficiary countries by the public; this review has not resulted in the withdrawal or suspension of benefits from any ATPA country. By Providing New Opportunities, Preferences Can Increase U.S. Imports from Developing Countries and Thus Promote Economic Development: In assessing the effects of trade preferences on beneficiary country development, economists note that preferences are just one element of a complex economic development process and that isolating their direct impact is difficult. However, there is fairly wide agreement among economists that expanding trade promotes growth and development. If trade preferences lead to increased exports, and export earnings are used to expand industrialization and promote a more diverse economy, then preferences can contribute to the economic development of beneficiary countries.[Footnote 17] To shed light on the question of whether U.S. trade preference programs are helping countries develop, we look at the fundamental link between the programs and the trade activity of beneficiary countries, focusing on three key elements: (1) the extent and nature of the new opportunities provided under U.S. preference programs, (2) whether countries are fully using the available opportunities, and (3) whether U.S. imports from beneficiaries have grown and diversified. We also report countries' perspectives on the benefits they derive from U.S. preferences, based on fieldwork. Overall, we find that U.S. trade preference programs have contributed to increased and more diverse trade for many developing country partners. Opportunities Offered Beneficiaries under U.S. Preferences Have Expanded: To assess the opportunities provided to beneficiary countries by U.S. preference programs, we examined the scope of programs' coverage by beneficiary and product, the size of tariff cuts (or margins of preference), and some eligibility conditions that can affect the ability of beneficiaries to access program opportunities. Overall, we found that the opportunities for beneficiaries to export under preferences have expanded, but still have gaps (see detailed data and further discussion in app. III). Coverage: As detailed in appendix III, product coverage, as measured by tariff lines eligible for duty-free treatment, is extensive for most U.S. preference programs, products, and partners. In 1996, the number of duty-free tariff lines offered under GSP was expanded to provide additional benefits to beneficiary least-developed countries (LDC). Enactment of the regional programs continued this expansion. But, as figure 1 shows, notable gaps remain in tariff lines available for duty- free import under preference programs, particularly in agricultural and textile and apparel products. Figure 1: Product Groups with Most Dutiable Product Lines in U.S. Tariff Schedule, Taking Into Account All U.S. Preference Programs: [See PDF for image] This figure is a series of pie-charts depicting the following data: Product group: Animal and plant products; Dutiable products that face MFN duties and are ineligible for U.S. preference programs: 8%; Duty-free products due to MFN or U.S. trade preference programs: 92%. Product group: Prepared food, beverages, spirits, and tobacco; Dutiable products that face MFN duties and are ineligible for U.S. preference programs: 17%; Duty-free products due to MFN or U.S. trade preference programs: 83%. Product group: Textiles, leather, and footwear; Dutiable products that face MFN duties and are ineligible for U.S. preference programs: 48%; Duty-free products due to MFN or U.S. trade preference programs: 52%. Product group: Apparel; Dutiable products that face MFN duties and are ineligible for U.S. preference programs: 57%; Duty-free products due to MFN or U.S. trade preference programs: 43%. Source: GAO analysis of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, 2006. [End of figure] Moreover, in examining coverage by beneficiary countries' trade with the United States in 2006, using the ratio of eligible to dutiable imports[Footnote 18] for each partner, we find wide variation in coverage even within programs. Our analysis finds that: (1) countries eligible for only GSP or GSPLDC have the least coverage of partners' dutiable imports--approximately 25 percent, (2) regional programs and GSPLDC have much higher coverage of partners' dutiable imports, and (3) country variations in coverage are wide. For example, 35 GSP or GSPLDC beneficiaries, including Lebanon, Paraguay, Somalia, and Zimbabwe, have high coverage rates, exceeding 75 percent of the value of their dutiable imports. Yet, 54 GSP or GSPLDC beneficiaries such as Bangladesh, Egypt, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan have low coverage rates (less than 25 percent of dutiable imports). Preference Margins: The expansion of U.S. program coverage since 1996 appears to have increased the benefit of U.S. preferences by adding some key products under GSP-LDC and the regional programs that otherwise would face relatively high U.S. tariffs. A recent effort[Footnote 19] to quantify margins of preference (the difference between the preference rate and the otherwise-applicable tariff rate) across all U.S. preference programs, including GSP, by staff economists at ITC and the World Bank finds that preference margins are relatively high for apparel products, as well as certain agricultural goods (melons, cut flowers, frozen orange juice, raw cane sugar, and asparagus);[Footnote 20] they tend to be relatively low for other products and fairly uniform among programs. Program Conditions: Conditions on product entry are also a significant factor affecting opportunities and trade under U.S. preference programs. While the data on coverage and margins of preference suggest a degree of success in improving the benefits of U.S. preference programs, in general, recent assessments of the literature express some skepticism as to whether trade preferences, and GSP in particular, have had more than a very modest impact on the export performance, and hence the development, of eligible countries. In discussing factors that underlie the performance of preference programs, researchers Ozden and Reinhardt, for example, not only indicate that GSP often fails to cover products in which beneficiary countries have the greatest comparative advantage, such as agricultural products, but cite administrative features of the programs--notably, export ceilings and rules of origin--as key constraints on benefits.[Footnote 21] Nevertheless, conformity with such requirements can be vital to ensuring that benefits flow to the intended country--that is, the designated beneficiary country or countries, rather than countries that are ineligible for preferences. Two specific conditions--\"competitive need limitations\" and \"rules of origin\"--illustrate how administrative implementation of statutory provisions, although addressing important policy considerations, may affect the ability of beneficiary countries to fully access the opportunities otherwise offered by U.S. preference programs. GSP places export ceilings, or competitive need limitations (CNL), on eligible products from GSP beneficiaries that exceed specified value and import market share thresholds (LDCs and AGOA beneficiaries are exempt). Rules of origin for U.S. trade preference programs typically specify a minimum percentage value-added to the entering product that must come from the beneficiary country. However, more complex rules apply to some products, notably textiles and apparel. Our fieldwork revealed examples where complex rules-of-origin requirements appear to be complicating preference trade, for example, in Haiti and in Ghana. On the other hand, liberalizing quotas and rules of origin have been the principal means by which the regional programs have been liberalized or made more likely to permit imports in recent years, particularly on apparel products. Utilization of Regional Programs Is Fairly High Compared with GSP but Varies by Partner: The effectiveness of trade preference programs in expanding trade is also dependent on beneficiaries' actual use of the preference opportunities offered. The utilization rate indicates the extent to which beneficiaries are taking advantage of the opportunities offered.[Footnote 22] Our analysis shown in appendix III finds that U.S. preference programs have fairly high utilization rates, but utilization varies by program and beneficiary. Although utilization of the regional preference programs is higher than utilization of GSP, to some extent, this lower utilization of GSP reflects the fact countries that have access to both GSP and regional programs often opt to use the regional programs. Our analysis of utilization across programs by beneficiary country finds substantial variation. For example, under AGOA, a number of countries, such as Nigeria, Angola, Chad, and Gabon have high utilization rates, but 12 of the 38 AGOA eligible countries did not export under the program.[Footnote 23] Overall U.S. Imports from Developing Countries Have Risen, and Preference Imports Have Risen Even Faster: The improved opportunities for market access provided by U.S. preference programs appear to have contributed to the rapid growth in U.S. imports from developing countries in recent years. The total dollar value of U.S. imports from both developed and developing countries has steadily grown since 1992, but developing countries have witnessed much faster growth since 2000. The developing countries' share of total U.S. imports has increased, while the developed (high- income) countries' share has declined. The overall gains by developing countries are mostly attributable to middle-income developing countries. The share of low-income and LDCs remains small.[Footnote 24] Turning to preference imports specifically, we also find that preference programs have generally contributed to the increasing shares of developing countries in U.S. imports, particularly imports from low- income developing countries. However, imports under U.S. preference programs only accounted for about 5 percent of total U.S. imports in 2006. Total U.S. preference imports grew from $20 billion in 1992 to $92 billion in 2006. Most of this growth in U.S. imports from preference countries has taken place since 2000, when preference imports grew faster than overall U.S. imports. Whereas total U.S. preference imports grew at an annual rate of 0.5 percent from 1992 to 1996, the growth quickened to an annual rate of 8 percent from 1996 to 2000, and 19 percent since 2000, which also suggests an expansionary effect of program changes that increased product coverage and liberalized rules of origin for LDCs under GSP in 1996 and African countries under AGOA in 2000. A Few Countries Dominate U.S. Preference Imports, but Lower-Income Countries Have Garnered a Growing Share: While U.S. preference imports remain concentrated in a few countries, overall the poorer countries' share of preference imports has risen recently. As can be seen from figure 2, the top 5 suppliers under preference programs in 2006 accounted for 58 percent of preference imports, and the top 10 suppliers accounted for 77 percent of preference imports. Among the top 10 suppliers, two countries--Nigeria and India--are low-income, and six countries--Angola, Ecuador, Colombia, Thailand, Peru, and the Dominican Republic--are lower middle- income countries.[Footnote 25] The top 25 preference beneficiaries accounted for over 95 percent of U.S. preference imports.

[End of figure] Nevertheless, as figure 3 shows, the poorest countries have been more successful in increasing their shares in total U.S. imports under preferences than they have been in increasing their share of overall U.S. imports. The year 2000 marks the beginning of gains in preference imports for low-income countries and declines in the share of middle- income developing countries. By 2006, imports from low-income countries had risen to 38 percent of U.S. preference imports. Within the middle- income grouping, the share of upper middle-income countries has generally declined since 1992, while that of lower middle-income countries rose, then moderated; in 1996, lower middle income countries share surpassed that of the upper middle income countries. The share of U.S. preference imports from the least-developed countries was 17 percent in 2006, versus nearly zero until 1996--the year of major revisions in GSP. Figure 3: U.S. Preference Imports by Beneficiary Income Levels in 2006: [See PDF for image] This figure is a series of line graphs and pie-charts depicting U.S. preference imports by beneficiary income levels in 2006. The first graph depicts total imports from preference beneficiaries under preference programs from 1992 to 2006. Four income levels are represented: Low; lower-middle; upper-middle; and total. Indicated on the graph are three specific points in time: 1999, GSP expanded; 2000, AGOA initiated; CBTPA added; and 2002, ATPDEA added, GSP renewed. The following data is depicted (U.S. dollars in billions): Low income: 1992: $1.1; 1993: $1.3; 1994: $1.3; 1995: $1.4; 1996: $1.4; 1997: $1.9; 1998: $2.3; 1999: $2.0; 2000: $2.1; 2001: $1.8; 2002: $1.8; 2003: $2.5; 2004: $3.2; 2005: $3.5; 2006: $3.5.

The value of U.S. preference imports tripled in the decade from 1996 to 2006, as coverage under existing programs improved, and new programs were added. All developing country income groups saw a rise, but low- and lower-middle income rose most. The next figure is a series of pie-charts depicting the following data: All U.S. imports: Year: 1992; Low income: 4%; Middle income: 27%; High income: 68%.

Lower-middle income: 1992: 32%; 1993: 31%; 1994: 38%; 1995: 37%; 1996: 43%; 1997: 54%; 1998: 62%; 1999: 61%; 2000: 57%; 2001: 40%; 2002: 40%; 2003: 44%; 2004: 42%; 2005: 43%; 2006: 42%. Upper-middle income: 1992: 58%; 1993: 58%; 1994: 50%; 1995: 52%; 1996: 47%; 1997: 34%; 1998: 27%; 1999: 28%; 2000: 32%; 2001: 22%; 2002: 24%; 2003: 20%; 2004: 18%; 2005: 17%; 2006: 16%. Percentage from preference beneficiaries: LDCs� share has risen from virtually nil in 1992-1996 to about 17 percent by 2006. The following data is depicted: LDC: 1992: 0%; 1993: 1%; 1994: 0%; 1995: 0%; 1996: 0%; 1997: 11%; 1998: 28%; 1999: 29%; 2000: 25%; 2001: 15%; 2002: 16%; 2003: 14%; 2004: 12%; 2005: 15%; 2006: 17%. Note: The data presented in this figure is for the current set of beneficiary countries. Income categories were assigned based on 2006 rankings by the World Bank or the United Nations. Each country's income group remained constant for the period. In other words, if a country's present income status was higher in 2006 than it was previously, it is not captured here. [End of figure] Reliance on Preference Programs among Least-Developed Countries Varies Considerably: While our analysis shows that the LDC's share of U.S. preference imports has risen, the extent of their trade and reliance on preferences (as measured by the share of preference imports in total imports) varies considerably. Three LDCs--all oil exporters--rank among the leading suppliers of total imports into the United States under preference programs (Angola, Chad, and Equatorial Guinea) as shown in table 3. Other LDC exporters to the United States, such as Lesotho, Madagascar, and Haiti are also extensive users of preference programs and have the opportunity to export apparel under AGOA or an expanded CBI. In contrast, several of the top 10 LDC exporters such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Liberia, Niger, Nepal, and Guinea do not have the opportunity to export textiles and apparel under GSP and do not rely on preferences to support their exports to the United States. Overall, 34 of the 46 eligible LDCs barely used preference programs for their exports to the United States.[Footnote 26] Table 3: Leading LDC Exporters to the United States and Their Share under Preference Programs, 2006 (Dollars in millions): Country: Angola; Total U.S. imports: $11,514; Ratio of preference program imports to total U.S. imports from country or country group: 98.2%.

[End of table] Fuels and Apparel Dominate Preference Imports, but Overall Imports Have Diversified Somewhat: The growth in imports from developing countries is accompanied by significant changes in the product mix of U.S. imports from preference- eligible countries. Notably, the rapid rise in fuel imports since 1996 is the defining feature of U.S. imports under preference programs. Fuels were less than 1 percent of U.S. imports from preference countries in 1996 but, in 2006, account for nearly 60 percent of U.S. preference imports from preference-eligible countries. Figure 4 also highlights the importance of apparel in the growth of U.S. preference imports up to 2005. After the phase out of global quotas on textiles and apparel in 2005 and the entry into force of the Dominican Republic- Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) for several CBI nations during 2006, however, these imports under preference programs declined somewhat. Figure 4: Key Products in U.S. Preference Imports, 1992-2006: [See PDF for image] This figure is a stacked multiple line graph depicting total key product imports from 1992 to 2006, and indicating three specific dates: 1996: GSP expanded; 2000: AGOA initiated and CBTPA added; 2002: ATPDEA added, GSP renewed. The following approximated data has been extrapolated from the graph: Year: 1992; Product: All other products; Amount of imports: approximately $29 billion. Year: 1996; Product: All other products; Amount of imports: approximately $30 billion. Year: 2000; Product: Apparel, fuels, all other products; Amount of imports: approximately $35 billion: apparel ($1), fuels ($4), all other products ($30). Year: 2002; Product: Apparel, fuels, all other products; Amount of imports: approximately $63 billion: apparel ($8), fuels ($24), all other products ($31). Year: 2006; Product: Apparel, fuels, all other products; Amount of imports: approximately $90 billion: apparel ($5), fuels ($50), all other products ($35). Source: GAO analysis of official U.S. trade statistics. [End of figure] In 2006, fuels comprised 94 percent of all imports under AGOA, nearly 70 percent of ATPA/ATPDEA imports, but only 27 percent each of GSP and CBI/CBTPA imports. Apparel imports represent about 6 percent of total preference imports but represent over 30 percent of U.S. imports under CBI, 10 percent of ATPA imports, and just 3 percent of AGOA imports (see app. V). Figure 5 further breaks down trends in nonfuel, nonapparel imports under preference programs. Notably, after 1993, when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was implemented, Mexico lost GSP eligibility, and global agreements to eliminate tariffs in certain sectors such as electronics and information technology were effectuated by the United States, imports under preferences of machinery and electronics--initially the largest product category-- declined, but increased somewhat after 2000. Four product areas show increases. The year 2000 changes in U.S. preference programs (the implementation of AGOA, CBTPA, and enhancements in ATPA) appear to have contributed to growing imports of agriculture; textiles, leather, and footwear; glassware, precious metals and stones, and jewelry; and chemicals, plastic, wood, and paper. Figure 5: U.S. Preference Imports: Nonfuel, Nonapparel Sectors: [See PDF for image] This figure includes a line graph depicting U.S. preference imports in the nonfuel and nonapparel sectors and also depict the following key dates: 1996: GSP expanded; 2000: AGOA initiated and CBTPA added; 2002: ATPDEA added, GSP renewed.

[End of figure] Diversification of Products Imported from Some Beneficiary Countries Has Increased Modestly: An important goal of trade preferences concerns helping developing countries diversify the range of products that they produce and export. Our analysis shows that total U.S. imports from all preference-eligible countries remain quite concentrated when countries are grouped by their preference program eligibility. However, when viewed over time, imports from preference-eligible countries appear to have become somewhat more diversified since 1992. Our analysis of diversification of total U.S. imports from preference- eligible countries is shown in figure 6. Using a widely used measure of trade and commodity concentration, we constructed an index to show a value of 0 when products are extremely concentrated and a value of 1 when products are most diversified.[Footnote 27] Consequently, a high value of this index indicates a relatively diversified import/export product mix. In figure 6, the relative level of diversification among the programs is indicated by the height of the line, and the change in the level of diversification over time is shown by the trend in the line from 1992 to 2006. Looking first at the diversification level of each program, we see that U.S. imports from those countries that qualify for GSP only, and those that import to the United States under CBI, have the most diverse profile. Conversely, imports from countries eligible for the AGOA, GSP- LDC, and ATPA show a relatively less diverse profile. This finding can be seen as broadly consistent with the concentration of imports under these preference programs in fuels and apparel products. Second, looking at the trend in the diversification index over time, we find that all country groups, except CBI, which already was the most diversified, show a modest increase in diversification over time. The highest rate of increase in diversification (as measured by the rate of increase of the lines in fig. 6), is noticeable for imports from countries eligible only for GSP. AGOA countries, which are the least diversified, have shown relatively little change over time.[Footnote 28] It is also important to note that determination of diversification at such a high level of aggregation still allows for significant diversification within each broad product group. Figure 6: Diversification Index of U.S. Imports from Preference- Eligible Countries, 1992-2006: [See PDF for image] This figure is a line graph indicating the diversification of imports from eligible countries, from least diverse to most diverse. The following is depicted: Diversification Index of U.S. Imports from Eligible Countries: AGOA: 1992: 0.13; 1993: 0.14; 1994: 0.14; 1995: 0.14; 1996: 0.16; 1997: 0.17; 1998: 0.19; 1999: 0.23; 2000: 0.23; 2001: 0.20; 2002: 0.23; 2003: 0.22; 2004: 0.21; 2005: 0.18; 2006: 0.20.

[End of figure] Developing Countries' Ability to Use Preference Opportunities May Be Constrained by Limited Trade Capacity: A key factor that can determine the impact of trade preference programs on economic development is the ability of developing countries to take advantage of global trading opportunities.[Footnote 29] The existence of a preferential tariff is of little use in countries without the ability to produce goods desired by importers, at competitive prices. This ability to produce and trade competitively on world markets, which is termed \"trade capacity,\" is generally related to having the appropriate economic conditions and institutions that help to attract investment and enhance efficiency. Yet, many developing countries lack of trade capacity prevents them from taking full advantage of opportunities to export goods and services. The lack of trade capacity is due to inadequate economic, legal, and governmental infrastructure. Poor networks of roads, small and outdated ports, inadequate supplies of energy and other utilities, rigid financial institutions, inefficient or corrupt customs bureaus, and poorly educated citizens are some of many obstacles that can make production and exporting difficult and more costly. For example, in Haiti, an apparel manufacturer located in a government-owned industrial park told us they did not have reliable public sources of electricity or water. Therefore, they had to pay for backup electricity generators and trucked-in water to operate their factories. In addition, entrepreneurs in developing countries may have little access to information about markets and export standards or to affordable financing that would enable them to set up a successful export business. Even countries that have developed industries to produce items with strong global markets, with or without the assistance of preferences, may need to improve their trade capacity. For example, mineral commodities such as oil, or agricultural products such sugar and soybeans, are an important source of export income to many developing countries. However, developing a greater diversity of export industries requires new skills, technologies, and investment. Country Visits Highlight Importance Attached to Preferences, Despite Diversity of Recipients: While the impact of trade preferences on the development of beneficiary countries remains a subject of debate among economists and other analysts, our fieldwork in several beneficiary countries indicates the diverse range of countries being served, and most countries emphasized their view that U.S. trade preferences are important to their trade and development objectives. The countries include several whose efforts to use U.S. preferences are at nascent stages and several that achieved notable success. We chose to visit Haiti and Ghana because they are among the poorest beneficiaries and ones where mechanisms to take advantage of recently expanded benefits under newer preference programs--HOPE and AGOA--are being put in place. Overall, the people we met in Haiti and Ghana expected their countries will increase their use of the preferential access to the U.S. market, but urged continued U.S. commitment and patience. Following are illustrative observations from our fieldwork in these countries: * In-country officials and business representatives in Haiti see preferences as a much-needed engine for creating jobs in the short- term, attracting investment in the medium-term, and fostering growth over the longer-term. Haitian officials recognize Haiti must confront the daunting challenges of repairing its damaged infrastructure and international image and improving security in order to be able to effectively take advantage of the opportunities offered by the HOPE program. Haiti's base of entrepreneurs with experience in the apparel industry and geographic proximity to the United States are assets that may help the country use the new access provided by HOPE and thereby convince Congress to reenact it in 2011. * Ghanaian authorities have put in place policy reforms and are pursuing trade promotion initiatives to encourage the private sector to take advantage of export opportunities provided under AGOA. Authorities noted that hosting the annual AGOA forum among government, private sector, and civil society increased the program's visibility in the country. However, many of the Ghanaian business people we met were still in the initial stages of exporting to the United States. Additionally, Ghana National Chamber of Commerce officials told us many potential beneficiaries of the program, particularly agricultural producers, are still unfamiliar with the full range of opportunities available under AGOA, and see the program as being primarily targeted to the textile and apparel industry. Like Haiti, Ghana lacks such essential capacity as reliable energy supply and cost-competitive transportation. Yet, both governments were mobilizing and were receiving considerable on-site and other resources from various U.S. government and multilateral agencies to develop customs and port facilities, and navigate U.S. rules and requirements, etc. We picked Brazil and Turkey to visit because these countries have successfully used U.S. trade preferences to export a diverse range of relatively sophisticated manufactured goods. The two countries were also of interest because both Brazil and Turkey rely on their own government and government-affiliated business associations to promote awareness of GSP, with limited assistance from U.S. agencies such as USAID.[Footnote 30] Both expressed a continued need for preferences, even though their overall economies are growing, and they are among the leading developing country users of U.S. preferences. Following are illustrative observations from our fieldwork in these countries: * The government and private sector officials we met in Brazil emphasized that GSP benefits both nations. Information provided GAO shows that more than 90 percent of the value of what Brazil ships to the United States under GSP are raw materials and intermediate or capital goods, some produced by U.S.-affiliated multinationals. [Footnote 31] Upon arrival in the United States, these intermediate goods are destined for further processing and/or incorporation into U.S. manufactured goods such as cars and power generators. Officials at Brazil's Commerce and Development agencies have stepped up efforts to promote awareness and use of GSP, seeing it as a valuable tool for helping its poorest regions and boosting participation by smaller businesses in export markets. An analysis by Brazil's Commerce Ministry shows that Brazil has had more success in exporting manufacturing goods under GSP and that more than 80 percent of the products Brazil exports to the United States under GSP would otherwise face relatively low tariffs (facing: MFN tariffs set at or below 5 percent).[Footnote 32] Yet, the loss of such privileges in competitive need limitations (CNL) decisions has caused actual or likely business contraction and layoffs at two companies on GAO's schedule of visits (in the automotive part and copper wire industry). The people we met said such preferences are particularly important now as they face intense competition from China, which has displaced them in traditional industries such as leather footwear (which is excluded by statute from the GSP program). Ironically, China's rise has also coincided with a run-up in demand and prices for Brazil's commodities, boosting the country's total exports but disadvantaging its manufactured goods because the Brazilian currency has appreciated. * Turkey also has been buffeted by rising commodity prices in sectors such as jewelry. It has been successful in exporting a diverse range of manufactures to the United States under GSP, ranging from stone slabs to steel, and says continuing to do so is vital to its competitiveness. As in Brazil, the Turkish business representatives we met with said that profit margins are so thin in the highly competitive U.S. market they serve that even small preference margins make the difference between being able to sell or being forced to exit entirely. Indeed, Turkey wishes to widen the list of eligible products (e.g., hazelnuts) and expressed concerns over losing GSP access for products such as jewelry and marble that officials indicate have exceeded, or are likely to exceed, CNLs. They attributed exceeding CNLs in part to rising commodity prices, levels of aggregation in the U.S. tariff schedule that are too high for certain products, and the related issue of importer use of broader versus more specific categories to enter goods to avoid complications in customs classification and clearance. Colombia and Kazakstan were selected for high use, as well as their involvement in ongoing liberalization: Colombia, through a free trade agreement with the United States, and Kazakstan, as a result of its efforts to join the WTO. Following are illustrative observations from our fieldwork in these countries: * Colombia dominates the ATPA program, and exports to the United States accounted for 20 percent of Colombia's overall exports in 2006. Relying on ATPA for more than half (54 percent) of its exports to the United States that year, Colombia has attained success in steadily increasing its exports in all but 2 years since the program's inception in 1991, particularly since the program was expanded in 2002. Yet the range of products it exported under preferences is considerably narrower than that supplied by Brazil or Turkey. To diversify away from coca production and spur participation in international trade, Colombia has pursued improved security, political stabilization, and economic diversification in the years since Plan Colombia was implemented in 2000 and the Andean Trade Preference Program was expanded in 2002. The Department of State and USTR credit Colombia's efforts and these programs, as well as strong internal and external demand, with revitalizing Colombia's economy. Colombian business sector spokesmen and government officials with whom we met generally underscored the important role trade preferences have played in allowing certain sectors, notably cut flowers, to compete in the U.S. market; however, they also noted that their country needs to move beyond trade preferences. In March 2007, Colombia's trade minister publicly stated that his country has effectively exhausted the utility of U.S. trade preferences and is eager to consummate a comprehensive free trade agreement with the United States. This not only will assure continued preferential access to the U.S. market for Colombia's exports, on which it depends, but provide additional access and involve reciprocal liberalization and rule-of-law changes in such areas as investment and IPR that may help it attract additional investment and innovation. * Kazakhstan's resource-driven economy is also booming based largely on its vast oil, gas, and minerals reserves, which together make up about two-thirds of its economic output. Its exports to the United States reached $1 billion in 2006, of which half was imported using GSP preferences. The country's development goals include managing its mineral wealth, integrating into the world economy, and diversifying its exports. Despite its goal of becoming a hub for East-West business, Kazakhstan faces many challenges associated with the legacy of the Soviet era, such as legal structures that make business formation and trade difficult and a business mentality of dependence on government subsidies. Geographically, Kazakhstan is challenged in trading with the United States, although opportunities for integrating regionally with the European Union are great. The major goal of Kazakhstan's trade policy at present is WTO accession. Awareness and interest in the U.S. GSP program was rather limited. In fact, exports of several major products reached CNL limits, and the country did not seek a waiver for its producers. The major GSP export in 2006, copper cathodes, turned out to be more likely a one-time event prompted by factors other than GSP preferences (the normal or MFN tariff rate on this product is just 1 percent). A major producer of the country's leading preference export told us he sells the commodity at world prices and does not depend on preferences or focus on the U.S. market, due to strong demand and transportation linkages elsewhere. Fundamental Program Trade-offs Balance Foreign and Domestic Benefits: Preference programs balance two key trade-offs. First, programs offer duty-free access to the U.S. market to increase beneficiary trade, to the extent that it does not harm U.S. industries. Product exclusions, country graduation, and product import limits are tools to make this trade-off, although their use has raised concerns that nonbeneficiary countries may gain U.S. market share from a beneficiary's loss of preferences. Second, policymakers face a trade-off between longer or permanent program duration, which may encourage investment, and shorter renewal periods, which may provide leverage to achieve other policy goals. Finally, the preference programs balance these trade-offs against a backdrop of increasing global trade liberalization. Although multilateral trade liberalization is a primary U.S. trade objective and would be beneficial to most developing countries, liberalization dilutes the marginal value of the preferences to beneficiaries. This may affect their willingness to participate in reciprocal trade liberalization. However, economic studies suggest that the negative effects of preference erosion are outweighed by other factors, most notably the benefits for developing countries associated with open markets. Product Exclusions Shield Domestic Industries but Limit Magnitude of Preferences to Beneficiaries: Statutory Product Exclusions Affect Products of Importance to Developing Countries: A basic policy trade-off is the extent to which preference programs benefit businesses in beneficiary countries versus those in the United States. As described in appendix III, U.S. preference programs provide duty-free treatment for a little over half of the 10,500 U.S. tariff lines, in addition to those that are already duty-free on an MFN basis for all countries. But, they also exclude many other products from duty- free status, including some that developing countries are capable of producing and exporting. The extent of product exclusions, therefore, may directly affect the ability of some developing countries to use and benefit from the preferences. Some product exclusions were established in preference legislation to protect sensitive U.S. industries from import competition. The GSP statute, for example, prohibits various \"import-sensitive\" categories of products from being designated as eligible. These include most textiles, apparel, watches, footwear, handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather apparel; import-sensitive electronics, steel, and glass products; and \"any other articles which the President determines to be import-sensitive in the context of the Generalized System of Preferences.\"[Footnote 33] In addition, agricultural products subject to a tariff-rate quota are not eligible under GSP for duty-free treatment if such imports exceed the in-quota quantity. The regional preference programs exclude some of these products as well. U.S. tariffs on a number of these excluded products tend to be high. The GSP statutes provide some discretion for the administration to determine which items within some of these product categories are not import-sensitive. Specifically, for electronic, steel, and manufactured and semi-manufactured glass products, USTR and ITC officials told us that the President may determine which of these items are eligible for GSP benefits, based on advice from the ITC about import sensitivity. The administration has at times self-initiated such a determination for individual products, but the officials told us it has reexamined eligibility for large numbers of products only within the context of extending new benefits to subsets of countries, namely for LDCs in 1996 and for AGOA suppliers in 2000. More often, it makes determinations for individual products based on petitions filed by interested parties. There is no discretion for administrative product additions for the other product categories specifically excluded by law from GSP eligibility. However, the statutory language for each of these other product categories is based on business conditions as of specific dates--January 1, 1994, for textiles and apparel; June 30, 1989, for watches; and January 1, 1995, for footwear, handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather apparel. We note that U.S. industries have changed in the intervening years, and these statutory provisions may not be up-to-date. For example, in comments to USTR on the GSP program in 2006, the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America stated that imports now account for 99 percent of U.S. footwear sales and urged that the footwear exclusion be removed from the GSP legislation. According to USTR officials, the initial GSP statute provided that the President could not designate as eligible those \"textile and apparel articles which are subject to textile agreements.\" Certain handcrafted wall hangings, clothing, and other hand-loomed articles were not covered by the Multi-Fiber Arrangement.[Footnote 34] In the late 1970s, the agencies administering GSP sought to provide commercial opportunities for handicraft producers of nonimport-sensitive items in interested beneficiary countries. Based on an interagency review, the President determined in 1981 that U.S. imports of certain wall hangings, pillow covers, and carpets and textile floor coverings that had been certified as handmade by the beneficiary country could enter under GSP. USTR officials told us that since that time 15 GSP beneficiaries have entered into such certified textile handicraft agreements; however, by 2007, all but two of the items originally covered by the presidential determination have become MFN duty-free. As noted above, no textile and apparel items can be added to GSP eligibility if they were not on the GSP-eligible tariff list as of January 1, 1994. Studies indicate that even when GSP product exclusions have been liberalized within the context of GSP for LDCs or the regional programs, remaining limits on product eligibility can affect the ability of beneficiary countries to use and benefit from U.S. preference programs. One recent study[Footnote 35] examined the expansion of tariff lines under AGOA. In agriculture, the study noted, AGOA appears to have liberalized nearly all products, although a substantial portion of agricultural tariff lines are still subject to tariff-rate quotas and, as a result, are not, in effect, fully liberalized. Products not fully liberalized include certain meat products, a large number of dairy products, many sugar products, chocolate, a range of prepared food products, certain tobacco products, and groundnuts (peanuts), the latter being of particular importance to some African countries. The study noted that, in manufacturing, AGOA liberalized additional tariff lines, but the increase is most notable for those countries granted apparel benefits. According to the study, key products that remain excluded are textile products, certain glass products, and certain headwear. A related trade-off involves deciding which developing countries can enjoy additional preferential benefits for products excluded for most preference recipients. One controversy concerns a few LDCs in Asia that are not included in the U.S. regional preference programs, although they are eligible for GSP-LDC benefits. Two of these countries-- Bangladesh and Cambodia--have become major producers and exporters of apparel to the United States and have complained about the lack of duty- free access to this country for their goods. For example, Cambodian trade and industry officials argue that it is not fair that many LDCs enjoy preferential access to the U.S. apparel market through the regional preference programs, while Cambodia does not.[Footnote 36] In comments filed with USTR on possible U.S. proposals at WTO to provide duty-free, quota-free access to least-developed countries, some African and other beneficiary countries, as well as certain U.S. industries, have opposed the idea. African private sector spokesmen have raised concerns that giving preferential access to Bangladesh and Cambodia for apparel might endanger the nascent African apparel export industry that has grown up under AGOA, while other non-LDC developing countries have expressed similar concerns about their own industries. U.S. textile manufacturers have also protested that the possible expansion of apparel benefits to these countries would threaten their textile sales to Latin American clothing producers under the regional preference programs and free trade agreements. However, numerous U.S. importing industries, such as retail groups, are strongly in favor of these proposals. Country and Product Graduation Aim to Focus Benefits on Poorest Countries but May Not Achieve That Objective: Over the 30-year life of the GSP program, questions about which countries should benefit and how more benefits could be directed to poorer countries have been raised repeatedly. The concerns relate to the original intention that preference programs would confer temporary trade advantages on developing countries, which would eventually become unnecessary as the countries became more competitive. The GSP program has mechanisms to limit duty-free benefits by \"graduating\" countries that are no longer considered to need preferential treatment, based on income and competitiveness criteria.
