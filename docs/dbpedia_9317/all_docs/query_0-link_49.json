This Element provides a comprehensive account of major Chinese government-financed infrastructure projects in the Global South since 1949. Using new datasets, it demonstrates that Chinese global infrastructure is distinct in terms of its historical tenacity and massive contemporary scope. But this does not imply that contemporary Chinese global infrastructure or the Belt and Road Initiative should be studied in a vacuum. Historical and comparative perspectives show that contemporary projects often emerge based on similar political logics to those that shaped infrastructure investment in earlier periods of Chinese history and other international contexts. The Element then examines how infrastructure projects have created both purposeful and unintended sources of influence by serving as valuable but risky political capital for host country governments as well as the Chinese government.

Around that time, the Chinese government began financing overseas development projects at a breathtaking pace. Since 2000, it has committed hundreds of billions of dollars for projects in transportation, energy, industry, water, and other infrastructure-heavy sectors. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), launched in 2013 to promote connectivity along a broadly envisaged overland “belt” in Eurasia and a maritime “road” spanning several regions, accelerated this trend, and China soon became the largest bilateral provider of development finance in the Global South (Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. 2022). Today, physical infrastructures such as roads, highways, railroads, bridges, ports, dams, power plants, factories, mines, pipelines, stadiums, government buildings, and event venues visually embody China’s massive, complicated role as a provider of development capital.\n\nChina’s global infrastructure spree has attracted widespread international attention, particularly in the United States and other liberal democracies concerned about China’s growing economic power, as well as in developing countries that host Chinese-financed projects. Debates are contentious and often polarized. Advocates appreciate the speed, efficiency, and lack of bureaucratic red tape with which China finances and builds development “hardware” (Reference WadeWade 2008; Shikwati, Adero, and Juma 2022). Critics warn that China is a strategic, opaque lender determined to extract natural resources and policy concessions while making recipient countries less prosperous, more debt-laden, and less democratic (Reference NaimNaim 2007; Reference ChellaneyChellaney 2017). Other skeptics contend that Chinese infrastructure is economically wasteful, consisting of “useless buildings” and roads to nowhere. The BRI’s first decade has intensified this debate by providing opportunities for enthusiasts and skeptics alike to gather anecdotes as datapoints for their respective claims.\n\nConcerns about Chinese overseas infrastructure in particular have fueled larger assertions about China’s global economic influence. Outside suspicion toward Chinese overseas infrastructure projects is of course not new, much less did it originate with the BRI. For example, the “rogue aid” label first popularized by Foreign Policy in 2007 suggested that China offers aid and infrastructure abroad for “boosting international alliances that advance China’s growing global influence” (Reference NaimNaim 2007, 97; emphasis added). Decades earlier, Cold War-era Chinese global infrastructure projects were similarly criticized by Western observers as tools of an expansionist foreign policy designed to accumulate influence and spread political ideology (Reference LargeLarge 2008).\n\nToday, such sentiments are even stronger. According to some accounts, China’s influence is advancing in lockstep with its economic development. The US Department of State is publicly operating on this assumption, asserting in 2020 that China’s “global reach and international influence have expanded accordingly” following four decades of rapid growth (Office of the Secretary of State 2020, 40). Chinese global infrastructure is often seen as an important influence tool within this narrative. Observers have suggested that China is “weaponizing” the BRI to bring other countries into its orbit (Reference Russel and BergerRussel and Berger 2020). In particular, the opaqueness of Chinese policy bank-issued loans for infrastructure creates potential for massive liabilities, including “hidden debt” that China might shield from the international community and wield as a “debt trap” to exercise influence over other countries (Reference ChellaneyChellaney 2017; Reference Gelpern, Horn, Morris, Parks and TrebeschGelpern et al. 2022).\n\nThis viewpoint has been popular in the corridors of power within the United States amid mounting bilateral tensions. The US 2017 National Security Strategy asserts that “China’s infrastructure investment and trade strategies reinforce its geopolitical aspirations” (Reference TrumpTrump 2017). In 2018 Vice President Mike Pence contended that “China uses so-called ‘debt diplomacy’ to expand its influence,” and that for China’s development finance to developing countries, “the benefits invariably flow overwhelmingly to Beijing” (Reference PencePence 2018). A year later, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized Beijing for brokering “corrupt infrastructure deals in exchange for political influence.” In 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested that many BRI host countries ”feel pressured to take bad deals on terms set by others,” tacitly referring to China’s influence over these governments.\n\nAmerican anxieties about the consequences of Chinese global infrastructure are shared by other governments. French President Emmanuel Macron stated in 2018 that new Silk Roads built along the BRI are “a tool to promote new international standards, rules and norms.” The same year, Penny Wong, now Australia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, remarked that the BRI “is a game-changer” that “employs economic power as an expression of strategic power” and represents “a fundamental change in the way that strategic business is done.” Host country governments have also occasionally perceived Chinese infrastructure projects as influence conduits. As discussed in Section 4, former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in 2018 criticized “unfair” infrastructure deals signed by his predecessor that would disproportionately benefit China and leave Malaysia “indebted,” and later advised other infrastructure-seeking countries to “regulate or limit influences from China.”\n\nConcerned governments have begun backing rhetoric with bilateral and multilateral policy responses. Both the United States and Japan have notably eschewed the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a Chinese-led multilateral, infrastructure-focused development bank founded in 2015. In 2018, the US Congress passed the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act, which enabled the formation of the Development Finance Corporation designed in part to finance infrastructure alternatives to Chinese-financed projects. In November 2019, Australia, Japan, and the United States launched the “Blue Dot Network” to monitor the quality of global infrastructure projects, including those financed and built by China. In December 2021 the European Union (EU) established the Global Gateway and in June 2022 the Group of Seven (G7) unveiled the Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment (PGII), formerly Build Back Better World (B3W), ostensibly to provide alternative infrastructure initiatives to the BRI. The United States claims that PGII will deliver “game-changing projects to close the infrastructure gap in developing countries, strengthen the global economy and supply chains, and advance U.S. national security.”\n\nResearchers have been more cautious in questioning and qualifying assertions about Chinese infrastructure and influence. But policy and popular debates have largely abandoned nuance and clarity in favor of a linear narrative that pegs China’s influence to its global infrastructure and other investments, even as many observers possess strong doubts about the economic viability and future of the BRI. This has primed audiences to fixate on the potential influence benefits of infrastructure for China while downplaying its potential risks.\n\nMoreover, despite enormous policy, media, and academic interest, the conceptual and empirical contours of Chinese global infrastructure remain surprisingly unclear. A large literature has unpacked the nature and impacts of different forms of Chinese overseas development capital (e.g. Reference AldenAlden 2007; Reference BräutigamBräutigam 2009; Reference LeeLee 2017; Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. 2022). But there are few if any systematic accounts of Chinese overseas infrastructure, which instead is often bundled into more general studies of Chinese aid, lending, and investment. Moreover, existing measures of infrastructure often rely on indirect measures of financial flows rather than actual infrastructure projects. For example, researchers employing statistical analyses often proxy for infrastructure by aggregating dollars committed to infrastructure-intensive sectors such as energy, transport, and industry, or to financial flow types such as loans, lines of credit, export buyer’s and seller’s credits, and other instruments (e.g. Reference Blair, Marty and RoesslerBlair, Marty, and Roessler 2022; Reference ZeitzZeitz 2021; Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. 2022). Qualitative research that employs interviews, case studies, site visits, or other approaches has carefully examined many individual Chinese-supported infrastructure projects around the world, but struggles to generate scalable, systematic inferences due to local contextual factors.\n\nIn addition, existing accounts of the BRI and Chinese overseas infrastructure offer remarkably little comparative or historical context for their claims. This recency bias discounts both earlier eras of Chinese global infrastructure and preexisting knowledge from other fields about domestic and international infrastructure projects. It also makes it difficult to assess whether and how contemporary Chinese global infrastructure is distinctive in its motives, features, and impacts.\n\nChina’s “infrastructure-influence nexus,” that is, the ways in which infrastructure potentially generates influence, remains similarly nebulous despite immense curiosity. Many existing accounts assume that infrastructure creates Chinese influence but do not specify how this occurs. Most research has focused on high-level policy outcomes, such as China’s ability to finance and build infrastructure in exchange for diplomatic and political support by other governments, though evidence suggests that rising powers like China also care deeply about “winning hearts and minds” among foreign public audiences (e.g. Reference Brazys and DukalskisBrazys and Dukalskis 2019). In general, few studies have rigorously considered how infrastructure in particular might generate influence for China’s government (e.g. Reference HillmanHillman 2019a; Reference HoHo 2020).\n\nIn short, the BRI has attracted immense public and scholarly attention as a global infrastructure drive since its launch a decade ago. But despite this curiosity, we have surprisingly little clarity about what Chinese global infrastructure actually refers to, or how it impacts China’s pursuit of international influence.\n\nThis Element offers a comprehensive account of Chinese global infrastructure and helps address the aforementioned questions in three steps. First, it situates China’s twenty-first-century global infrastructure drive within China’s broader global development finance program since 1949. It offers a general definition of Chinese global infrastructure that can be applied to study a wide range of China’s most economically and politically consequential infrastructure projects in the Global South. In particular, it spotlights two primary forms of global infrastructure that China has consistently financed and built: “high-profile” infrastructure such as transportation and other large, economically productive projects, and nationally symbolic “prestige” infrastructure such as government buildings and stadiums.\n\nSecond, it operationalizes this definition and employs two newly created datasets to directly measure Chinese global infrastructure projects committed since 1949. One of these datasets was constructed over the past three years, during which my research team catalogued approximately 4,000 total projects, including nearly 1,500 physical infrastructure projects, that the Chinese government committed to developing countries during the second half of the twentieth century. This comprehensive catalog of historical projects challenges overwhelmingly present-focused accounts of Chinese global infrastructure. Decades before the BRI was conceived, the Chinese government had already begun financing and building global infrastructure at scale, including hundreds of high-profile and prestige projects in over 100 countries across Africa, Asia, and other developing regions.\n\nThird, the Element helps clarify how global infrastructure generates different intended and unintended influence outcomes that affect China’s interests. Chinese global infrastructure is a valuable form of national political capital for host country leaders who can acquire and brand projects to serve a variety of economic and political functions. But China’s overseas infrastructure projects are no less immune to well-known pitfalls that have jeopardized other large-scale infrastructure ventures throughout history. The same features that make infrastructure attractive also tend to make its planners prone to risk miscalculation. In addition to economic risks, earlier Chinese global infrastructure and the BRI have demonstrated that overseas infrastructure can also introduce major volatility for states’ international influence, even when influence-seeking is not the primary objective. These projects have unpredictable trajectories and have likely complicated rather than enhanced China’s global influence, and have also diminished the ability of the Chinese government to control its net influence abroad. Overall, global infrastructure has been a useful tool for China’s pursuit of high-level influence outcomes such as political support from foreign governments. But its returns for China’s popular influence and image abroad, as well as China’s longer-term net influence, are considerably murkier.\n\nImportant takeaways emerge from this contextual approach. Contemporary Chinese global infrastructure is unique in terms of its currently unrivalled scale throughout the Global South. The evidence presented below shows that China is also rather distinct in terms of its consistent willingness to provide global infrastructure since the Cold War. But historical and comparative perspectives also reveal that contemporary Chinese global infrastructure projects are hardly exceptional. Their political dynamics often resemble those of earlier Chinese-financed global infrastructure, and of other large infrastructure ventures pursued by governments and other stakeholders in a variety of settings.\n\nMoreover, Chinese global infrastructure projects remain as much political ventures as they are financial investments. Overlapping domestic and international political incentives between host country governments and China’s government provide important rationale for both sides to pursue global infrastructure. These visible, nationally relevant projects promise short-term political benefits – including potential influence for China’s government – but also generate major economic and political uncertainty for governments over time. More careful appreciation for global infrastructure’s political dynamics complements recent research heavily focused on the financing and debt aspects of Chinese infrastructure lending. Chinese global infrastructure’s political logic is crucial for understanding its long-term persistence in developing countries.\n\nThe remainder of the Element proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a primer on the evolution of China’s development finance from 1949 in order to situate contemporary Chinese global infrastructure. It explains how China’s government arrived at its current position as the world’s largest provider of global infrastructure, and how important policy foundations were laid down during the second half of the twentieth century. It also synthesizes a large literature on the nature, motives, and consequences of Chinese development finance – including but not limited to infrastructure – that has emerged over the past 20 years.\n\nSection 3 turns specifically to Chinese overseas infrastructure development projects. A sprawling, interdisciplinary literature suggests that these projects generate important short-term economic benefits as well as longer-term risks. I introduce the concept of “global infrastructure,” defined as government-financed physical infrastructure projects which are both highly visible and nationally salient in other countries. I focus on two prominent forms of Chinese global infrastructure: “High-profile” projects are large-scale, complex economic infrastructure projects, including massive transportation, energy, and other productive infrastructures. “Prestige” projects are financially smaller but equally visible and flashy infrastructure projects possessing national symbolism such as government buildings, stadiums, and conference centers, and are primarily allocated to small states in the Global South. Global infrastructure’s visibility and national scope produces an outsized, conspicuous presence that host country politicians amplify through their own branding efforts. These features make global infrastructure distinct forms of political capital for both host country governments and China’s government relative to other types of development cooperation. Section 3 utilizes two new datasets to document China’s provision of global infrastructure since 1949.\n\nSection 4 turns to the relationship between infrastructure and influence. It argues that global infrastructure possesses outsized scale, complexity, and visibility that magnify both its political benefits for host country governments and influence possibilities for donor and lender governments. In the short-term, global infrastructure offers concrete political capital for both host country leaders and for China’s government. The former can seek, acquire, and brand high-profile or prestige infrastructure as national achievements that serve a variety of domestic political purposes, while China’s government can provide these projects to enhance its international influence. These features make global infrastructure politically attractive for governments in the short term, but also create complicated and poorly understood political consequences for China’s government and host country governments as projects move from conception to reality. In particular, global infrastructure activates unintended “influence externalities” for China via political mobilization and infrastructure narratives in host countries that muddle the net political value of these projects and weaken governments’ control over influence outcomes.\n\nSection 5 summarizes and reflects on the Element’s main findings. It concludes that the BRI is an important chapter in a larger history of Chinese global infrastructure and in a much larger, global story of states’ consistent attraction to infrastructure despite massive socioeconomic and political risks. This broader view helps grasp the roles of political in addition to economic considerations that lead host countries and the Chinese government to jointly pursue global infrastructure. It also suggests that global infrastructure is likely to remain as a central component of China’s development cooperation even as it evolves into digital and other new forms with different stakeholders and financial arrangements.\n\n2 The Lineage of Chinese Overseas Development Projects\n\nHow did China’s government become the world’s largest provider of infrastructure in developing countries? This section first provides a background of China’s broader set of global development activities since 1949 to situate Chinese global infrastructure. It reviews evidence on the motives and impacts of China’s global development projects and then discusses two new datasets that can be used to document and analyze Chinese global infrastructure.\n\n2.1 China’s Long March toward Global Infrastructure\n\nPolicymakers, journalists, and scholars have closely scrutinized the growing overseas development programs of China and other “emerging donors” since 2000 (Reference WoodsWoods 2008). But China is not a new donor or creditor. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) initiated overseas development assistance almost immediately after its founding in 1949. Since then, China’s basic posture toward overseas development finance has shifted multiple times, often in response to changing political and economic priorities at home. For example, China was a net donor throughout most of the Mao era. Outgoing aid was an important foreign policy tool driven heavily by political and ideological directives, particularly after the Sino-Soviet Split, when Mao adopted an extremely activist, revolutionary foreign policy orientation (Reference YuYu 1977; Reference Alden and AlvesAlden and Alves 2008; Reference BrazinskyBrazinsky 2017; Reference Cheng and TaylorCheng and Taylor 2017; Reference EisenmanEisenman 2018). This expansion was significant: Even as hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens lived in poverty, Chinese government spending on foreign aid accounted for over 5 percent of the national budget by the early 1970s (Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. 2022). Chinese foreign aid was initially concentrated in nearby socialist states, but during the 1960s China began providing aid to dozens of countries in Asia, Africa, and other regions within the “Third World.”\n\nRevolutionary aid was fiscally unsustainable, and China experienced a role reversal and became a major net recipient of aid inflows during the reform and opening period. Its outgoing aid was scaled down and redirected toward smaller, economically sustainable projects under Deng Xiaoping. China concurrently began to receive high volumes of development finance, including many large-scale infrastructure projects, from donors and lenders like Japan and the World Bank. The Chinese government reengineered its development finance approach once again during the 1990s – a process discussed more in the following section – and returned to its status as a net provider of development finance around 2005 (Reference KobayashiKobayashi 2008; Chin 2012).\n\nThese shifts are important for understanding the origins of China’s contemporary global infrastructure drive. In particular, important policy changes during the early reform era helped position China to dramatically scale up its provision of overseas infrastructure. As China’s economy incrementally opened up during the 1980s and 1990s, the Chinese government reoriented its outgoing development finance to chiefly serve commercial in addition to political purposes. This adjustment was informed by China’s own experience hosting Japanese-financed infrastructure and other development projects. For example, Japan’s government frequently utilized commodity-backed loans when financing infrastructure projects in China (Reference BräutigamBräutigam 2009). It also adopted a project allocation approach in which China’s government, often jointly with Japanese enterprises, directly proposed specific infrastructure projects for Japan to finance (Reference Zhang and SmithZhang and Smith 2017). Both of these features are now well-known attributes associated with many contemporary Chinese-financed infrastructure projects abroad.\n\nSeveral specific policy changes also occurred during this period with consequences for Chinese global infrastructure. In 1982, China’s Ministry of Commerce, at the time called the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (对外经济贸易部), established the Department of Foreign Aid (援助司) to manage overseas foreign assistance projects. Around the same time, China National Complete Plant Import & Export Corporation Ltd. (COMPLANT), which would eventually become a state-owned enterprise (SOE), was mandated with implementing most of China’s overseas development projects. China’s government also adopted a Contract Responsibility Mechanism (承包责任制) under which newly formed subsidiary enterprises of central and provincial government institutions, which would also eventually become SOEs, implemented Chinese-financed projects abroad (Reference Cheng and TaylorCheng and Taylor 2017, 39–42). The government also began to encourage the creation of joint ventures between Chinese enterprises and foreign governments and firms, in part to support overseas development projects. Finally, the Chinese government started encouraging Chinese contractors to explore overseas markets as early as the 1970s, and Chinese construction companies began to accumulate experience as contractors for international infrastructure projects (Reference ZhangZhang 2020).\n\nCommercialization of China’s development finance accelerated further in the 1990s with the establishment of China’s two primary “policy banks,” the Export-Import Bank of China (“China Eximbank”) and China Development Bank (“CDB”), which were created in part to take over underperforming domestic projects in China (Reference Sanderson and ForsytheSanderson and Forsythe 2013). After their formation, Eximbank and CDB also began serving as the major financial vehicles through which China’s government provided capital for infrastructure projects around the world, particularly through concessional loans. Collectively, these experiences, policy reforms, and new institutions provided the foundation for China’s post-2000 global infrastructure drive.\n\nThe “Going Out” strategy launched by Jiang Zemin in the late 1990s and the BRI launched fifteen years later drove and accelerated China’s global infrastructure spree. Both initiatives explicitly linked several national economic priorities with China’s overseas development finance and mobilized immense state resources for financing and building infrastructure in developing countries. These objectives included finding alternative investment opportunities to US treasury securities and managing excess foreign exchange reserves; increasing foreign demand for Chinese goods and services, especially industrial inputs produced in excess; creating globally competitive, national champion firms; enhancing China’s energy security; and attempting to wean China’s own economy off of infrastructure investment (e.g. State Council 2013; Reference Kong and GallagherKong and Gallagher 2017; Reference MinYe 2020; Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. 2022). Relative to other development projects, infrastructure is particularly useful for pursuing many of these objectives as it offers massive financial and construction scale for allocating capital and supporting Chinese companies who serve as contractors.\n\nThe net result of these developments was that, by the early 2000s, China’s government was no longer a “traditional” donor who provided most of its overseas development capital as concessional aid. Instead, it had transformed into a massive provider of infrastructure primarily financed by loans motivated just as much by commercial considerations as political goals (Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. 2022). China still remained an important aid donor during this transformation, and its provision of smaller, highly concessional foreign aid projects in agriculture, education, health, and various social sectors has also increased significantly since the 1980s and after 2000. But these projects now represent a shrinking share of China’s overall global development footprint. China has taken on a hybrid role as a major source of both development aid and commercial infrastructure lending, though the latter is increasingly dominant as a share of China’s overall development finance. For example, between 2000 and 2007 China committed 61 cents of aid for every dollar of lending committed (Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. 2022, 105). In contrast, from 2013 to 2017, it committed just 11 cents of aid for each dollar of lending (Reference Malik, Parks and RussellMalik et al. 2021).\n\nThis evolution has arguably made it more difficult for the Chinese government to consolidate its development finance program – an already strenuous task given a wide range of stakeholders – by further increasing the number of relevant political and commercial actors. The Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) has long been the primary actor in managing China’s overseas development projects, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) as well as several domain-specific ministries, including the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Health, have also long been involved with implementing Chinese-financed aid projects.\n\nChina’s infrastructure-heavy development finance approach since 2000 significantly increased the pool of financial and policy stakeholders. These include, to name a few, sovereign funds that finance Chinese banks, China Eximbank and China Development Bank, China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), other commercial banks involved with lending for Chinese-financed projects, Economic and Commercial Counselor Offices (ECCOs) (经济商务参赞处) attached to Chinese embassies abroad, and SOEs implementing projects on the ground in other countries. These actors play important roles across project financing and implementation (e.g. Reference Gill and ReillyGill and Reilly 2007; Reference CorkinCorkin 2011).\n\nChinese SOEs serving as contractors and in other roles have become especially important infrastructure actors on the ground. They possess the expertise needed to build large-scale infrastructure projects in diverse foreign environments and, even as Chinese labor costs have increased, they can often do so at significantly lower costs than contractors from “traditional” donor and creditor countries (Reference Huang and ChenHuang and Chen 2016). State-owned enterprises are not passive actors who simply implement state directives, and available evidence shows that they can affect and interact with Chinese development finance in multiple ways. One study based on elite interviews with Chinese officials finds that Chinese SOEs and politicians in host countries can coordinate to secure infrastructure loans backed by Chinese policy banks, which impacts both the national and subnational allocation of projects (Reference Zhang and SmithZhang and Smith 2017). Moreover, in recent years Chinese SOEs have expanded from their traditional roles as contractors responsible for engineering, procurement, and construction. They are increasingly playing more active roles in overseas infrastructure projects often involving more equity and risk. They are doing so through build-operate-transfer (BOT) and other forms of public-private partnerships, as well as emerging forms of stakeholder-ship such as “integrated investment, construction, and operation” (Reference LeutertLeutert 2019; Reference ZhangZhang 2023).\n\nActor proliferation has likely made bureaucratic coordination more difficult. In 2018, China’s government created the China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) to serve as an independent aid agency under the State Council and improve coordination (Reference RudyakRudyak 2019a). But CIDCA’s vice-ministerial rank may circumscribe its relative authority, and thus far it remains unclear whether and the extent to which CIDCA or other new institutions can help streamline China’s development finance bureaucracy. It remains to be seen whether these bureaucratic and commercial actors can coordinate effectively and minimize informational and operational inefficiencies, especially when implementing large, complex infrastructure projects (Reference Zhao and JingZhao and Jing 2019). As discussed in Section 4, actor diversity also presents challenges for China’s government in trying to leverage global infrastructure for its pursuit of international influence.\n\nIn summary, Chinese development finance has undergone multiple shifts over the past seven decades. China’s shift from an aid donor to a hybrid, global provider of both aid and less concessional developmental capital reflects growing importance of economic motivations in addition to longstanding political motives. This evolution introduced a plethora of new state and commercial actors into China’s development finance arena, and also paved the way for China’s contemporary global infrastructure drive. As Section 3 demonstrates, however, overseas infrastructure has a long lineage that has survived diverse periods of Chinese development finance.\n\n2.2 What Do We Know about Contemporary Chinese Global Development Projects?\n\nChina’s reemergence as a major donor and lender since 2000 has sprouted a large literature focused on the nature and consequences of China’s global development projects, including but not limited to infrastructure. This section summarizes evidence on the allocation and impacts of these projects.\n\n2.2.1 Where Does China Finance Development Projects?\n\nChina’s government publishes considerably less detailed information on its overseas development projects compared to other major donors and lenders. Without systematic official data, researchers initially struggled to accurately categorize and measure China’s global development projects. Earlier studies tended to aggregate all of China’s state-financed capital in developing countries into catch-all measures such as “aid.” But only a portion of China’s international development projects resemble aid projects based on definitions set by multilateral bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) (Reference BräutigamBräutigam 2011).\n\nDifferentiating between Chinese aid- and debt-financed projects is thus crucial. As Reference Axel, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. (2018) show, Chinese aid and debt have fundamentally different features and motives, so it makes little sense to lump them together. In terms of aid (i.e. “official development assistance,” or “ODA,” as defined by the OECD-DAC), in recent years China’s government has provided several billion dollars globally each year and would rank within the top ten bilateral donors worldwide. It thus has remained a major and important source of foreign aid. But China’s debt-based development finance (i.e. “other official flows,” or “OOF”), which is usually much less concessional than aid and primarily provided via China Eximbank and CDB loans closer to prevailing market rates, far outpaces lending from any other bilateral lender.\n\nAs China’s development finance grew throughout the early 2000s, international observers primarily located in Western democratic countries became anxious. They worried that Beijing would be a “rogue donor” that deployed aid to strengthen corrupt dictators, extract natural resources, and undermine aid from “traditional” donors and creditors rather than help communities most in need of assistance (Reference NaimNaim 2007). Available evidence suggests that these accusations have largely not materialized (Reference Dreher and FuchsDreher and Fuchs 2015). Instead, China’s foreign aid is heavily concentrated in less developed, poorer countries with high levels of economic need (Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. 2022).\n\nThe Chinese government does employ aid to pursue strategic foreign policy objectives such as securing international diplomatic recognition and political support. Since the 1950s it has used aid as a carrot to cement its international diplomatic recognition and isolate Taiwan, a dynamic examined more in Section 4 (Reference Kao, Feldman, Kao and KimKao 1988). For example, the prospect of economic assistance from China was an important factor in shaping Chad’s decision to abandon (for the second time) diplomatic support for Taiwan in favor of the PRC in 2006 (Reference Cheng and ShiCheng and Shi 2009). A more recent example is the government of Nicaragua, who severed official ties with Taiwan in December 2021. Shortly after, the government inked several agreements for economic assistance from China, including a 12,000-unit social housing scheme as well as provisional agreements for other infrastructure including ports, railways, energy, and water projects.\n\nEmploying aid for geopolitical interests makes China similar to, rather than different from, “traditional” donors and creditors in the OECD-DAC. For example, political economists have shown repeatedly that donor governments funnel more bilateral aid to governments serving on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to sway policy decisions there (e.g. Reference Kuziemko and WerkerKuziemko and Werker 2006), and can also steer multilateral development finance to temporary UNSC members or other strategically important recipient countries (e.g. Reference Dreher, Sturm and Raymond VreelandDreher, Sturm, and Vreeland 2009).\n\nOn the other hand, Chinese aid often differs from aid provided by other major donors and lenders in at least one important way. China’s “no strings attached” approach often allows host country politicians to steer the selection, location, and branding of aid projects to a greater degree than projects financed by other large donors and lenders. As a result, Chinese aid can become a form of “unearned income” that host country leaders strategically manipulate and allocate to politically salient areas, especially during important political periods (Reference SmithSmith 2008). Reference Dreher, Fuchs and HodlerDreher et al. (2019) find that Chinese-financed aid projects are heavily concentrated in the birth regions of African leaders, particularly in the lead-up to competitive elections. Unfortunately, this means that projects sometimes do not end up in places with strong socioeconomic need, as leader birth regions tend to be located in wealthier regions (Reference Hodler and RaschkyHodler and Raschky 2014). In contrast, neither debt-financed projects from China nor development projects financed by the World Bank exhibit this tendency. These null findings make sense: The World Bank is known for conducting extensive pre-project evaluations and screenings to guard against political capture, while China is not known for employing rigorous safeguards (Independent Evaluation Group 2010; Reference Dornan and BrantDornan and Brant 2014; Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. 2022).\n\nChinese debt financing follows a different allocative logic. The Chinese government’s approach to financing overseas infrastructure and other capital follows an “encompassing accumulation” logic aimed at both commercial and political objectives (Reference LeeLee 2017). Commercial calculations in particular have become increasingly important since 2000, and as mentioned earlier, several national economic objectives have driven Chinese development lending for the past two decades. Allocation of Chinese debt-financed projects reflects these priorities. Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. (2022) show that Chinese development projects financed with debt are most frequently located in large, stable economies that offer greater potential for large returns on investment and lower likelihood of default. Another recent study supports this intuition and suggests that Chinese-financed electrification projects increasingly are allocated to wealthier countries with lower investment risks and higher ex ante electrification rates (Reference Sauer, Díaz Anadón, Kirchherr, Plummer Braeckman and SchulhofSauer et al. 2022). However, debt-based finance – much of which supports large-scale infrastructure projects – also flows heavily into countries with higher levels of corruption and lower levels of democracy. This is perhaps because such an institutional environment – which often features less bureaucratic red tape, regulation, and public oversight – makes it easier for China’s policy banks and companies to do business with their host country counterparts.\n\n2.2.2 What Are the Impacts for Host Countries and Societies?\n\nA related research agenda examines how Chinese-financed development projects affect the societies and economies in which they are implemented. On balance, Chinese development projects appear to create important economic benefits in the short run, but also introduce several different types of risks for host countries.\n\nDespite skepticism by other major donors and creditors, China’s global infrastructure push has been a welcome sight for many developing countries. Host countries throughout Asia, Africa, and beyond have enormous infrastructure gaps, and most bilateral and multilateral donors and creditors stopped financing infrastructure at scale decades ago. One estimate suggests that US$3.3 trillion in infrastructure investment is required globally through 2030, which equates to over US$350 billion more than current annual levels, in order to maintain current economic development forecasts (McKinsey Global Institute 2016). Proponents of China’s approach thus often point out that Beijing is financing urgently needed “hardware” otherwise unavailable to many developing countries (Reference MoyoMoyo 2009; Reference Lin and WangLin and Wang 2017). Evidence suggests that Chinese infrastructure is indeed helping fill this massive gap. Chinese development projects – both those financed through aid and especially those financed with debt – improve socioeconomic development in the short term as projects are built and come online. Reference Axel, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. (2021) find robust evidence that Chinese projects increase economic growth and activity both nationally and locally. In the short run, they find that an additional development project boosts economic growth on average between .41 and 1.49 percentage points two years after project commitment. At the same time, there is little or no evidence that Chinese development projects undercut potential development gains produced by Western donors and lenders – another claim of the aforementioned “rogue donor” narrative.\n\nOver longer periods of time, however, the net benefits of China’s global infrastructure and other development projects are less clear. Short-term economic boosts created by Chinese projects occur alongside complex economic, political, environmental, social, and other challenges introduced by the same projects. Grasping the medium- and long-term net economic effects of development projects, including those financed and built by Chinese actors, is a much more difficult task.\n\nThe issue of debt sustainability offers an illustration of this complexity. On the one hand, scholars have repeatedly challenged the well-known but highly controversial “Debt Trap Diplomacy” narrative insinuating that China’s government has been strategically luring borrower countries into its economic and political orbit by saddling them with unsustainable infrastructure debts (e.g. Reference BräutigamBräutigam 2020; Bräutigam 2022). Careful analysis of several flagship BRI projects finds little evidence of debt trap motives.\n\nOn the other hand, debt-financed infrastructure by definition requires substantial borrowing by host country governments. One earlier study found that eight countries may face high risks of debt distress because of their planned pipelines of BRI infrastructure projects, and this was calculated before many developing countries’ balance sheets significantly worsened following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (Reference Hurley, Morris and PortelanceHurley, Morris, and Portelance 2019). Another study suggests that debt challenges from Chinese-financed infrastructure are due to both scope – i.e. the sheer volume and scale of Chinese-financed infrastructure around the world – as well as the lack of transparency on the part of China’s government and policy banks, and the requirements in some loan contracts for borrower countries to keep loan terms shielded from public view (Reference Gelpern, Horn, Morris, Parks and TrebeschGelpern et al. 2022). A more recent analysis suggests that in recent years China’s government has used US$240 billion – primarily in the form of People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) currency swaps in Renminbi and additional loans – in bailing out debt-distressed host governments, many of whom initially pursued BRI infrastructure projects (Reference Sebastian, Parks, Reinhart and TrebeschHorn et al. 2023).\n\nIn addition to debt sustainability issues, measuring the net, long-term impacts of Chinese development projects on various socioeconomic outcomes is considerably more complicated than studying short-term indicators. It will nonetheless be an important task for researchers in the coming years as many BRI projects currently under implementation become operational.\n\nChina’s overseas development projects produce a wide range of other consequences in addition to socioeconomic impacts. To name but a few, Chinese-financed aid and debt projects can help reduce conflict in African countries when they fill voids created from aid withdrawals by “traditional” providers of development finance (Reference Strange, Dreher, Fuchs, Parks and TierneyStrange et al. 2017). At the same time, debt-financed projects might instead fuel conflict by expanding the reach of the state or creating local grievances (Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. 2022). Large infrastructure projects in particular can also create negative environmental externalities. This has long been a source of concern for environmental advocates who worry that infrastructure projects can harm the natural environment – via air pollution, deforestation, water and sewage contamination, and other channels – if these risks are not internalized by project implementers. Many planned transportation corridors along the BRI fall on or near fragile ecosystems and important biodiversity areas across Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America (Reference HughesHughes 2019; Reference Hongbo, Alexander Simmons and RayYang et al. 2021). Commercially driven, debt-financed projects provided by China are not known to be subject to internal vetting processes that adequately internalize these environmental risks and put in place corresponding standards. One study finds that Chinese-financed projects accelerate deforestation but that this effect is most severe in countries with poor environmental regulations and law enforcement, while negative effects can be minimized in more stringent regulatory environments (Reference BenYishay, Parks, Runfola and TrichlerBenYishay et al. 2016). Another study points out that energy projects financed by Chinese policy banks, particularly coal-fired power plants financed before President Xi Reference JinpingJinping’s 2021 pledge to stop building them, use enormous amounts of water and raise important questions about water security and sustainability (Reference Alkon, He and ParisAlkon et al. 2019).\n\n2.3 New Evidence on China’s Global Development Projects since 1949\n\nUntil about a decade ago, little systematic evidence existed for studying China’s evolving overseas development portfolio. As noted earlier, the Chinese government is less forthcoming than other major donor and creditor governments in terms of providing detailed information on its overseas development activities. Several open-source research initiatives have recently emerged to help fill this informational gap. These efforts have made it possible for researchers to more holistically and objectively study China’s global development finance using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Research organizations like AidData at William and Mary and a joint project between Boston University and Johns Hopkins University have produced and published large datasets on China’s global development finance. In subsequent sections, this Element employs two recently published datasets to study China’s provision of infrastructure projects since 1949.\n\nThe first dataset is AidData’s Chinese Official Finance Dataset, Version 2.0 (Reference Custer, Dreher and ElstonCuster et al. 2021; Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. 2022). This dataset was constructed and refined over the past twelve years in collaboration with an interdisciplinary team of scholars as well as hundreds of staff and students, primarily at William and Mary in the United States. The data are collected and refined using a publicly documented method called Tracking Underreported Financial Flows (TUFF) (Reference Custer, Dreher and ElstonCuster et al. 2023). Social scientists routinely use this database to analyze the aims and effects of China’s overseas development projects on a variety of outcomes. The 2.0 version of the dataset includes over 13,000 project records of Chinese government commitments of overseas development finance between 2000 and 2017, and the recently-released 3.0 version extends data coverage through 2021.\n\nThe second dataset is China’s 20th-Century Global Development Projects, a new dataset I also developed along with a research team based at the University of Hong Kong. It includes all publicly known Chinese government-financed development projects worldwide committed between 1949 and 1999. Over the past three years, our research team developed and applied a data collection methodology that builds on the general principles of TUFF and makes particularly heavy use of historical Chinese government publications – including bilateral agreements, various other government documents, and Party-state-controlled newspapers – to track China’s twentieth-century overseas development projects.\n\nThe dataset also benefits from and builds on earlier attempts to track twentieth-century Chinese global development activities (e.g. Reference HorvathHorvath 1976; Reference LawLaw 1984; Reference BartkeBartke 1989; Reference LinLin 1993; Reference Morgan and ZhengMorgan and Zheng 2019). Each of these efforts relied on a combination of official and unofficial sources to track Chinese-financed development projects in Africa and beyond. These earlier studies provide valuable evidence on China’s evolving role in financing global development, but none of them produced a comprehensive accounting of Chinese development finance before 2000, whether in terms of the overall sample of projects or in terms of the specific details and sources for each project. The new dataset thus helps fill a longstanding gap in the literature.\n\nThe twentieth-century data also complement other recent initiatives that track contemporary China’s overseas development finance – such as AidData as well as the Chinese Loans to Africa (CLA) Database – by enabling researchers to examine Chinese development projects since 1949 to the present day. The historical dataset includes nearly 4,000 Chinese-financed development project commitments between 1949 and 1999 to over 130 countries.\n\nFinally, these data are also valuable for studying Chinese global infrastructure projects, the focus of the remainder this Element. They help make three contributions in the proceeding sections. First, as mentioned in Section 1, the outpouring of policy and academic analysis on Chinese infrastructure suffers from recency bias and rarely offers historical context for the BRI. The historical data are compatible with contemporary datasets and, as shown in the following, enable analysis of Chinese overseas infrastructure projects over a long time horizon.\n\nSecond, in documenting China’s twentieth-century development projects, our research team directly coded all of China’s publicly known infrastructure projects. This is a departure from previous approaches that typically document Chinese development finance projects at the transaction- rather than project-level. The approach herein is novel because, despite a wide consensus that infrastructure is central to China’s development cooperation, available datasets and research tend to measure and analyze infrastructure indirectly. As pointed out in Section 1, most quantitative research that makes use of public datasets employs proxies for infrastructure projects, such as dollars committed to infrastructure-intensive sectors or certain types of financing instruments, rather than analyzing actual infrastructure projects. In contrast, in building the dataset of historical Chinese development projects, we carefully coded every individual project for several infrastructure-related variables. Crucially, our research team also applied this infrastructure coding protocol to AidData’s Chinese Official Finance Dataset, Version 2.0. The data featured in the following section make use of this approach.\n\nThird, and relatedly, measuring infrastructure requires a definition. Whereas earlier research often refers to Chinese overseas infrastructure in broad or vague terms, in the following section I first explicitly define different kinds of Chinese global infrastructure and then operationalize the definitions to catalog Chinese projects since 1949 using the aforementioned datasets.\n\n3 Chinese Global Infrastructure: High-Profile and Prestige Projects\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, most existing research focuses on Chinese development finance generally rather than infrastructure specifically. This section first contextualizes popular debates on Chinese overseas infrastructure. It considers Chinese and general perspectives on infrastructure, then introduces a new definition – covering both “high-profile” and “prestige” projects – and applies it to empirically catalog China’s global infrastructure since 1949.\n\n3.1 Chinese and International Perspectives\n\nChina’s overseas infrastructure is loosely defined concept without clear boundaries. Most analysts are plausibly referring to large, physical development projects with one or more tangible sites. Roads, railways, airports, harbors and ports, office buildings, housing complexes, power plants, factories, mines, industrial zones, government facilities, stadiums, and entertainment and meeting venues are among the most common types of Chinese infrastructure development projects. In addition, Chinese overseas infrastructure includes a growing portfolio of “digital infrastructure” such as wireless networks, artificial intelligence, smart cities and digital surveillance technologies, nanotechnology, and quantum computing projects (Reference XinhuaXinhua 2017).\n\nIn conceptualizing Chinese global infrastructure, Chinese official and quasi-official interpretations are a natural starting point. The term “infrastructure” (基础设施), and related terms such as “infrastructure construction” (基础建设), began regularly appearing in Party-state-controlled newspapers in the 1980s. For example, across People’s Daily (人民日报) articles published between 1950 and 2022, “infrastructure” appears regularly in the early 1980s and became a frequently mentioned topic thereafter. Much of the discussion, however, pertained to domestic infrastructure construction in China. Since then, as shown in Table 1, China’s official conceptualization of infrastructure has gradually evolved over the past three decades. Infrastructure initially referred to physical projects seen as prerequisite foundations for economic development. Subsequent definitions continue to suggest that infrastructure is vital for socioeconomic development, and that it plays a “foundational, leading, and all-encompassing” (基础性、先导性、全局性) role. More recent interpretations highlight transportation and digital fields in particular, differentiating them as “traditional” and “new” infrastructure.\n\nDateInfrastructure in Chinese textTranslation11/09/1990基础设施一般指能源、交通、邮电、江河流域治理、农田水利建设、环境保护以及供热、供水、供气等基本设施, 它是社会经济发展的基本物质条件。Infrastructure generally refers to basic facilities such as energy, transportation, post and telecommunications, river basin management, agricultural irrigation and water conservancy, environmental protection, as well as heat, water and gas supply, which are the essential material conditions for social and economic development.01/16/2017基础设施互联互通是“一带一路”建设的优先领域 … 基础设施 (包括高速公路、大桥、高铁、港口、电厂、通讯设施等)。基础设施对经济社会发展具有基础性、先导性、全局性作用。Infrastructure is a priority area of the “Belt and Road” initiative. Infrastructure (including highways, bridges, high-speed railways, ports, power plants, communication facilities, etc.). Infrastructure plays a fundamental, pioneering, and an all-encompassing role in economic and social development. 06/08/2020传统基础设施建设主要指‘铁公机’, 包括铁路、公路、机场、港口、水利设施等建设项目, 在我国经济发展过程中具有重要的基础作用。新基建则主要指以 5 G、数据中心、人工智能、工业互联网、物联网为代表的新型基础设施, 本质上是信息数字化的基础设施。Traditional infrastructure construction mainly refers to “RHA,” including construction projects such as railways, highways, airports, ports, and water conservancy facilities, which have a fundamental role in China’s economic development. New infrastructure construction, on the other hand, mainly refers to 5G technology, data centers, AI, the industrial internet, and internet of things (IoT), which is essentially digitalized infrastructure.\n\nChinese discussions of infrastructure built outside of China have often concentrated on three themes: the importance of “connectivity,” the application of China’s domestic infrastructure experience to the international realm, and, to a lesser extent, China’s international influence. First, Chinese government speeches and documents, particularly those published since the launch of the BRI, emphasize the socioeconomic value of infrastructure connectivity. For instance, at the Belt and Road Forum in May 2017, Xi Jinping remarked:\n\nInfrastructure connectivity is the foundation of development through cooperation. We should promote land, maritime, air and cyberspace connectivity, concentrate our efforts on key passageways, cities and projects and connect networks of highways, railways and sea ports … . We need to seize opportunities presented by the new round of change in energy mix and the revolution in energy technologies to develop global energy interconnection and achieve green and low-carbon development. We should improve trans-regional logistics network and promote connectivity of policies, rules and standards so as to provide institutional safeguards for enhancing connectivity.\n\nThe Chinese government has continuously doubled down on this sentiment. At the third symposium on Belt and Road development in 2021, Xi emphasized that infrastructure is important for building “hard connectivity” (硬联通) along the BRI (Reference JinpingXi 2021). The State Council’s 2021 white paper on “International Development Cooperation in the New Era” also emphasized the role of infrastructure connectivity (State Council 2021). The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)’s Belt and Road Construction Promotion Center (国家发展改革委一带一路建设促进中心) added in January 2022 that infrastructure connectivity is a key priority of the BRI (People’s Daily 2022). Chinese economists have argued that spatial connectivity created through overseas infrastructure generates economic value because it relieves bottlenecks such as unemployment and productivity, whereas Western bilateral and multilateral financiers’ emphasis on social development lacks connectivity elements and has thus failed to provide these benefits (e.g. Reference Lin and WangLin and Wang 2017). In short, from the perspective of China’s government and other observers, global infrastructure is a defining feature of Chinese international development cooperation, and one of its key functions is to promote “connectivity.”\n\nAnother perspective is that overseas infrastructure projects are an outward reflection of China’s own approach to promoting development at home. Both Chinese and international scholars have interpreted China’s global infrastructure drive as the “internationalization of a development-finance model that has facilitated its own growth in the past decades” (Reference Yeh and WhartonYeh and Wharton 2016; Reference ChenChen 2020a, 437). This approach emphasizes economic “hardware” such as transportation infrastructure, for which China’s government plays a central role in financing and projects and increasing their creditworthiness. Observers inside and outside of China point to large-scale infrastructure as China’s clear comparative advantage over other donors and creditors that stems from its own development approach (Reference WangWang 2017; Reference WahbaWahba 2021). Over the past three decades, local, provincial, and national government actors invested hundreds of billions of dollars in upgrading China’s transportation infrastructure. China’s government began overhauling and expanding the highway system in the early 1990s, which spread out economic activity from large cities into surrounding areas and had potentially large, positive effects on average incomes (Reference Roberts, Deichmann, Fingleton and ShiRoberts et al. 2012; Reference Nathaniel, Brandt, Vernon Henderson, Turner and ZhangBaum-Snow et al. 2017). Similarly, between 2004 and 2019, China built over 35,000 kilometers (km) of high-speed rail operating at a speed of at least 250 km/hour (Reference XiaoMa 2022, 2). Beyond transportation projects, Chinese government agencies and state-owned enterprises at various administrative levels have also invested heavily in other large, physical infrastructures such as office buildings, malls, stadiums, performing arts centers, and event venues, to name but a few.\n\nA third perspective held by some within and outside of China parallels international debates discussed in Section 1: The potential for overseas infrastructure to enhance China’s global influence. Even before the launch of the BRI, Chinese leaders purportedly believed that international infrastructure would increase China’s global influence and advance its foreign policy interests. As Reference MinYe (2020, 177) points out, the idea of “infrastructure diplomacy” dates at least to 2008 when a blueprint for a “Chinese Marshall Plan” was laid out. Earlier generations of Chinese leaders also saw merit in deploying high-visibility infrastructure projects to pursue influence across Asia and Africa. One of China’s most famous aid projects, the Tanzania–Zambia Railway (TAZARA, 坦赞铁路), was endorsed by Premier Zhou Enlai, who believed the project would generate substantially greater influence than would using the money to instead build small and medium-sized projects in other countries (Reference BoardEditorial Board 2008, 322; Reference MonsonMonson 2021). Though TAZARA – and many other major Chinese infrastructure projects discussed in the following sections – was also heavily motivated by other economic and political objectives, the Chinese government perceived the project as an important conduit for pursuing international influence.\n\n3.2 Infrastructure Promises and Pitfalls: Comparative Context\n\nBeyond Chinese perspectives, earlier research and debates in other settings provides additional context for China’s overseas infrastructure drive. For example, a large literature in economics suggests that government spending on infrastructure generally has positive effects on economic productivity growth (e.g. Reference AschauerAschauer 1998; Reference Sanchez-RoblesSanchez-Robles 1998; Reference Roller and WavermanRoller and Waverman 2001; Reference Esfahani and Teresa Ramı́rezEsfahani and Ramirez 2003). Infrastructure can generate short-run economic boosts by stimulating investment and employment, and can also produce long-term productivity increases as projects become active and begin to reshape economic activity (Reference Leduc and WilsonLeduc and Wilson 2013). Big infrastructure projects in particular directly create new employment opportunities (e.g. Reference Ifzal and PerniaAli and Pernia 2003; Reference Stephen, Lyytikäinen, Overman and Sanchis-GuarnerGibbons et al. 2019) which can be politically valuable to governments. On balance, existing research suggests infrastructure promotes economic growth, though there is less consensus over the precise channels and timing over which this occurs (Reference Calderón and ServénCalderón and Servén 2014). International development actors have applied this economic rationale to prescribe infrastructure investment in developing countries, and international institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) consistently emphasize the need for global infrastructure investment (e.g. World Bank 1994).\n\nIn terms of economic potential, at first glance China’s global infrastructure push should thus be a welcome sight. Developing countries throughout the Global South have enormous infrastructure gaps, and Chinese-supported infrastructure promises to help address them. Available evidence, including that discussed in the previous section, generally supports the notion that Chinese-financed infrastructure stimulates economic activity in these countries. Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. (2022) find that Chinese debt-financed projects – including many big-ticket infrastructure projects – improve socioeconomic outcomes in the short run in host countries at national and local levels. These projects increase economic output, decrease child mortality, and reduce spatial inequality by alleviating bottlenecks. Transportation infrastructure projects in particular can lower the cost of commuting to and from cities and increase property values in suburban and rural communities in developing countries (Reference Richard, Dreher and FuchsBluhm et al. 2021). Other recent studies report similar findings of positive, short-term economic impacts of Chinese infrastructure (e.g. Reference De Soyres, Mulabdic and RutaDe Soyres, Mulabdic, and Ruta 2020; Reference MuellerMueller 2022). There is also evidence that Chinese infrastructure projects abroad can increase local employment by stimulating short-term demand for low-skilled labor and longer-term demand for skilled labor after projects are finished, in countries such as Angola, Ethiopia, and Uganda (Reference Warmerdam and van DijkWarmerdam and van Dijk 2013; Reference Guo and JiangGuo and Jiang 2021; Reference Oya and SchaeferOya and Schaefer 2023). Chinese-financed projects that mitigate infrastructure bottlenecks may also help local firms become more productive, particularly those lacking access to quality transportation options (Reference Marchesi, Masi and PaulMarchesi, Masi, and Paul 2021).\n\nOver the longer term, evidence from other contexts is less conclusive about whether large infrastructure drives sustainable growth in developing countries (e.g. Reference Warner, Berg and PattilloWarner, Berg, and Pattillo 2014). Assessing the economic impacts of large infrastructure projects is difficult because of their scale, long implementation time, and financial and operational complexity (Reference Leduc and WilsonLeduc and Wilson 2013). On the one hand, these projects usually possess outsized economic ambitions that are not captured by short-term changes. Big infrastructure is not merely about direct, short-term results, and often hinges on grander visions of reshaping socioeconomic activity within or across communities of various scales. For example, city and other administrative governments in the United States undertook large public infrastructure projects at an unprecedented scale in the 1950s and 1960s, as a strategy aimed at revitalizing urban centers by attracting private and commercial investment (Altshuler and Luberoff 2003).\n\nWhile transformational ambitions make large-scale infrastructure appealing, they also inject major economic risks for project and community stakeholders. Even if infrastructure projects increase aggregate welfare, they also often create highly uneven distributional consequences (e.g. Reference Duflo and PandeDuflo and Pande 2007). Other studies question the basic economic viability of large infrastructure. Scholars of “megaprojects,” often defined as multibillion dollar transformational projects, have studied this phenomenon extensively. In their global study, Reference Flyvbjerg, Bruzelius and RothengatterFlyvbjerg et al. (2003; Reference Flyvbjerg2017, 12) suggest that these projects follow “iron laws”: the majority are consistently “over budget, over time, under benefits, over and over again.” Drawing on evidence from several hundred projects, they find that megaprojects are highly prone to economic underperformance across different political and geographic environments. Another study examines over 300 industrial megaprojects and similarly finds that over 65 percent “failed to meet business objectives” (Reference MerrowMerrow 2011, vii). “Megastructures,” or “massive construction or structure[s], especially a complex of many buildings,” have also historically yielded subpar economic and publicity results given their enormous scale, cost, and lengthy time horizons (Reference BanhamBanham 2020, 16). These tendencies are no less likely in developing countries, where infrastructure has always tended to take longer than expected to implement (Reference Calderón and ServénCalderón and Servén 2014; Reference Estache and FayEstache and Fay 2007).\n\nOther researchers have similarly documented how government investments in infrastructure and other large-scale interventions often disappoint. Reference ScottScott (1998, 5) shows how high-modernist ideologies that became prevalent during the second half of the eighteenth century convinced governments to attempt to reorder societies around infrastructural interventions such as “huge dams, centralized communication and transportation hubs, large factories and farms, and grid cities.” Developing countries, many of which were still colonies at the time, were often experimental sites for these interventions as colonial governments sponsored infrastructure projects that envisioned socioeconomic transformation and justified repression (Reference LorenziniLorenzini 2019, 13–14).\n\nWhen governments become captivated by infrastructure visions and promises, they also can struggle to identify and select socially optimal projects. As Reference Anand, Gupta and AppelAnand, Gupta, and Appel (2018, 19) explain, “Shiny new airports with huge capacities are built in many countries although they only serve a tiny elite, whereas less glamorous infrastructures, which would actually be more useful to the poorer segments of the population, are ignored and overlooked.” Alternatively, even if governments are relatively clear-eyed regarding infrastructure investment costs and benefits, political incentives can lead them to investment large sums in socioeconomically wasteful infrastructure (e.g. Reference Robinson and TorvikRobinson and Torvik 2005).\n\nSeveral other factors can further help explain large-scale infrastructure’s fraught economic performance. Proponents of major infrastructure are prone to tendencies and biases that can jeopardize objective calculation. Political leaders may desire the “rapture” from “building monuments to themselves” and from the “visibility this generates with the public and media,” while project architects, planners, and consumers may derive “pleasure” from “building and using something very large that is also iconic and beautiful” (Reference FlyvbjergFlyvbjerg 2017, 6). These and other individual-level “sublimes” can lead project supporters to neglect thorough cost-benefit analyses and subvert potential opposition voices that would otherwise serve as accountability mechanisms. Reference Flyvbjerg, Bruzelius and RothengatterFlyvbjerg et al. (2003, 5) note that even in democratic contexts, project advocates often shun “established practices of good governance, transparency and participation in political and administrative decision making.” The sheer financial and operational scale and complexity of large infrastructure further make it vulnerable to a suite of challenges, including corruption, public-private coordination bottlenecks, lack of flexibility, and bias toward linear thinking.\n\nExisting research suggests that China’s overseas infrastructure projects display many of these basic features. Chinese government-financed projects are similarly large, complex, and have long time horizons that complicate cost-benefit analysis. For example, Reference KaplanKaplan (2021) describes Chinese overseas development loans for infrastructure as “patient capital” with long time horizons, high risk tolerance, and low conditionality relative to capital from other foreign creditors. Other scholars have similarly noted that “the costs and benefits of large-scale infrastructure construction cannot be conclusively determined through a set of standard measurements; rather, many contributing factors must be observed and analyzed over the long term” (Reference TangTang 2021, 81–82).\n\nThese general pitfalls of large infrastructure should also sound familiar to observers of the BRI. For example, Chinese government-financed infrastructure and other development projects may insulate host governments from potential opposition. One study finds that natural resource-related project financing from China reduces “horizontal” legislative and judicial accountability, but has no effect on “vertical” accountability between rulers and their constituents (Reference Ping, Wang and ChangPing, Wang, and Chang 2022). Development projects provided by the Chinese government are also associated with higher levels of corruption in local communities that host them (Reference Samuel, Elkink and KellyBrazys, Elkink, and Kelly 2017; Reference Isaksson and KotsadamIsaksson and Kotsadam 2018). In particular, large-scale infrastructure – which tends to be located in relatively corrupt and undemocratic countries – may further exacerbate accountability and governance issues in already corrupt business environments. Infrastructure projects can do so by creating new interest groups or strengthening and augmenting existing ones composed of political and business elites (e.g. Reference CambaCamba 2021).\n\nThe tendency for large infrastructure to encounter delays is also frequently cited along the BRI. One study examines 431 Chinese-financed development projects and finds that more than half were completed behind schedule (Reference Malik, Parks and RussellMalik et al. 2021, 132). The same study finds that ninety-one projects that underperformed compared to their initially stated objectives in terms of profits, debt repayments, or implementation milestones. As an example, the Chinese-financed high-speed railway in Laos experienced major delays in allocating credit for different phases of the project. This has slowed overall progress and also left various intended beneficiaries – including Chinese SOEs as well as Chinese and Laotian workers – worse off (Reference ChenChen 2020b). On the other hand, roughly a quarter of projects for which there is information on both start and end dates were reportedly completed ahead of schedule. Kenya’s SGR is one well-known example of infrastructure along the BRI completed ahead of time (Reference WangWang 2022).\n\nIn short, Chinese overseas infrastructure projects exhibit many of the properties and tendencies associated with infrastructure in other contexts. It is also possible that big-ticket infrastructure loans provided by Chinese policy banks may produce even greater vulnerability to economic miscalculation on the part of China’s government, borrower governments, contractor firms, or other stakeholders due to opaque lending practices. On the other hand, however, being able to point to examples of efficient implementation is likely an important priority for China’s government given that speed and efficiency, especially relative to “traditional” donors and lenders, has become one of its reputational cornerstones. In any case, assessing the net socioeconomic impacts of overseas Chinese infrastructure projects, and infrastructure projects in general, is an arduous task given these projects’ scale, complexity, long time horizons, and multidimensional impacts.\n\n3.3 Conceptualizing Chinese Global Infrastructure\n\nResearchers in other fields have provided a variety of definitions for infrastructure, but none are ideally suited for studying Chinese infrastructure in the Global South. For example, infrastructure can refer broadly to “vast, complex, and changing systems that support modern societies and economies” (Reference Carse, Harvey, Jensen and MoritaCarse 2016), or “the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions” (American Society of Civil Engineers 2017). Other researchers have studied related concepts that overlap with infrastructure. “Megaprojects” are defined as “large-scale, complex ventures that typically cost $1 billion or more, take many years to develop and build, involve multiple public and private stakeholders, are transformational, and impact millions of people” (Reference FlyvbjergFlyvbjerg 2017, 2). Anthropologists have argued that infrastructure possesses important cultural, social, and political dimensions in addition to financial and economic concerns, highlighting both its material and immaterial functions. Reference LarkinLarkin (2013, 328) defines it as “built networks that facilitate the flow of goods, people, or ideas and allow for their exchange over space” that are both dependent on and constitutive of local context. Reference Anand, Gupta and AppelAnand, Gupta, and Appel (2018, 3) further note that “material infrastructures, including roads and water pipes, electricity lines and ports, oil pipelines and sewage systems, are dense social, material, aesthetic, and political formations that are critical both to differentiated experiences of everyday life and to expectations of the future.”\n\nThese definitions are helpful starting points for Chinese global infrastructure. However, the concepts of “infrastructure” and “megaprojects” are broad and encompass many projects and initiatives beyond the realm of international development. These general definitions can also lead to problematic measurement. For example, in the context of Chinese development finance, “infrastructure” would capture thousands of small-scale, local projects unlikely to be consequential for Chinese influence or other national- or international-level outcomes. Similarly, the US$1 billion threshold for a megaproject does not account for country context and has limited use for development finance projects since host countries have differently sized economies; one billion dollars means different things in different places. If applied to Chinese development finance, “megaprojects” would include many financially large projects that are nonetheless relatively inconsequential for studying influence or other outcomes of interest. Conversely, looking only at projects valued over US$1 billion would omit hundreds of infrastructure projects with potentially important influence or other consequences.\n\nConsider a recent Chinese-financed infrastructure project as an example. In 2016, the Chinese government committed a US$80 million grant for the 15 MW Ruzibazi Hydroelectric Power Plant in Burundi. The plant represents over 2 percent of Burundi’s GDP and is one of the largest hydropower projects in the country. In contrast, it would rank outside the top 20 power generation projects that China’s government has financed in Indonesia over the same period.\n\nI define Chinese global infrastructure as high-visibility, national-level physical infrastructure projects financed by China’s government in other countries. Given the immense diversity of Chinese state, quasi-state, and non-state actors involved in overseas development activities, this definition is not meant to capture every single aspect of Chinese overseas infrastructure. For example, it omits projects financed by non-Chinese entities and built by Chinese contractors, even though this is also an already large and growing component of China’s global development footprint (e.g. Reference LeutertLeutert 2019; Reference ZhangZhang 2020). Nor does this definition include projects financed by China’s government but not carried out by Chinese companies or other actors. It also omits small-scale, auxiliary, low-visibility, or other infrastructure unlikely to constitute highly visible, national projects.\n\nInstead, this definition is designed to measure Chinese-financed and -built infrastructure projects that are global in character relative to other types of international development projects. Global infrastructure projects are negotiated bilaterally between governments, but these projects engage both state and non-state actors and produce local, national, and even global socioeconomic, political, environmental, and other consequences. They are also more likely to be salient in local, national, and global debates involving a wide range of actors. For these reasons, global infrastructure is also more likely than other Chinese development projects to produce influence or other political consequences for both host country governments and the Chinese government (the focus of Section 4).\n\nChinese global infrastructure spans an extremely diverse set of projects that generally share two important traits. First, relative to other forms of development finance, global infrastructure projects are highly visible. They have an outsized physical presence and also generate higher levels of publicity locally, nationally, and globally. Physical visibility correlates with project size and involves tangible and large or centrally located project sites. Media presence involves heavy publicity, particularly around project milestones such as announcement, groundbreaking, and completion ceremonies featuring rituals and performances, ribbon-cuttings, speeches by leaders, or other conspicuous activities (e.g. Reference MengaMenga 2015, 485). As discussed in the next section, visibility is an important feature that enables host country governments to brand infrastructure projects and advertise them to large audiences at home and abroad (e.g. Reference HirschmanHirschman 1967; Reference Simone, Mahmud and WintersDietrich, Mahmud, and Winters 2018; Reference Baldwin and WintersBaldwin and Winters 2020). Second, and relatedly, global infrastructure is national in scope within host countries. Financially and spatially large infrastructure, typically negotiated by (or at least involving approval from) national governments and possessing high visibility, is more likely to be salient in national political discourse within host countries compared to other projects.\n\nChina’s government has primarily financed two types of global infrastructure since 1949, which are outlined in Table 2. First, high-profile infrastructure projects are massive economic projects typically motivated by a mix of commercial and political considerations (Reference StrangeStrange 2023a). High-profile infrastructure has comprised the bulk of Chinese global infrastructure and encompasses flagship, big-ticket infrastructure projects that have come to symbolize the BRI. As the next section illustrates, this project class mostly includes transportation, energy, and other economic infrastructure.\n\nHigh-profilePrestigeVisibilityHighHighHost country scopeNational-levelNational-levelNo. projects, pre-2000>300>120No. projects, post-2000>900>250Avg. size, post-2000~US$ 371 million~US$ 29 millionHost countriesGlobal SouthSmall states in the Global SouthComplexityHighLow to mediumCommercial motiveStrongWeakConcessionalSometimesUsuallyHost country symbolismSometimesUsuallyCommon examplesInfrastructure projects in transportation, industry, energy, and other economic sectors (see Figure 2)Government buildings; conference and convention venues; sports facilities; performing arts venues (see Figure 3)\n\nIn addition to being highly visible and nationally salient, high-profile infrastructure generally possesses two additional, related features that make it a distinct form of political capital for both host governments and China’s government. First, relative to other development projects, high-profile infrastructure is financially and operationally large. Since 2000, the typical high-profile project has cost several hundred million dollars, and many of these projects have cost more than US$1 billion. In contrast, the average Chinese foreign aid project commitment since 2000 has cost less than 10 percent of a high-profile project, or approximately US$23.7 million. High-profile infrastructure is also physically sizable, encompassing one or more large project sites. Sheer scale makes high-profile infrastructure inherently different than smaller, locally focused projects. High-profile infrastructure is often envisioned by its planners as being “trait making” rather than “trait taking,” with the potential to transform rather than simply fit into existing local economic and social structures (Reference HirschmanHirschman 1967, vii, xi). As such, high-profile infrastructure is not merely about direct economic impact and often involves longer-term visions of reshaping socioeconomic activity at scale.\n\nSecond and relatedly, high-profile infrastructure is complex in terms of its configuration of stakeholders, financial structure, and operations. High-profile projects often involve constellations of domestic and foreign actors – such as central governments of the host and financing countries, local and regional governments, multilateral development institutions, foreign and local firms, and foreign and local workers – who perform different project functions such as financing, design, implementation, operations, and monitoring (Reference WintersWinters 2019; Reference Strange, Plantan and LeutertStrange, Plantan, and Leutert 2023). These projects also involve longer implementation timelines, more detailed and lengthier contracts, and relatively complicated financing arrangements.\n\nPrestige projects are the second class of Chinese global infrastructure discussed in this Element. Like high-profile projects, prestige infrastructure is a well-known component of Chinese development finance. According to earlier accounts, Chinese overseas prestige projects include national-level government buildings, stadiums and other large sports facilities, convention and exhibition centers, and performing arts and cultural venues that are national in scope (Reference TullTull 2006; Reference BräutigamBräutigam 2011; Reference SwedlundSwedlund 2017).\n\nMost prestige projects have been financed as nonrepayable turnkey or “complete projects” (成套项目) in which China’s government is responsible for project design, construction, and maintenance. Chinese financing for prestige infrastructure is typically provided via nonrepayable grants or interest-free or otherwise highly concessional loans. A relatively small group of politically connected Chinese design and construction companies can bid for contracts from China’s MOFCOM and profit from implementing prestige projects abroad. However, these projects, which are on average much financially smaller compared to high-profile projects, are driven primarily by host country demands and Chinese political interests outlined in Section 4.\n\nThese projects are much less expensive than high-profile infrastructure but can still have an outsized presence in some host countries. One reason for this is that prestige projects can serve as national symbolic capital for host country governments. Political symbols are difficult to define due to their ubiquity (e.g. Reference EdelmanEdelman 1972; Reference DittmerDittmer 1977; Reference O’NeillO’Neill 2001), and national symbols here refer generally to representations of national themes or ideas embedded in infrastructure projects. Prestige projects themselves can become national symbols or instead can transmit higher-level, national ideals such as modernity, progress, or unity (Reference SteinbergSteinberg 1987; Reference van der Westhuizenvan der Westhuizen 2007). As discussed in Section 4, host governments in the Global South typically frame prestige projects around themes of national identity, development, progress, and modernity, and also situate them in the context of a country’s regional or international status ambitions.\n\n3.4 Measuring Chinese Global Infrastructure\n\nThis section measures Chinese global infrastructure projects by operationalizing the definitions introduced in Section 3.3. I carefully combed over each development project that China’s government has financed during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries using the aforementioned datasets, and identified physical infrastructure projects financed by China’s government since 1949. These were then classified as high-profile, prestige, or other (non-global) types of infrastructure (Reference StrangeStrange 2023a; Reference StrangeStrange 2023b).\n\nThis approach provides a more direct, sharper measure of Chinese global infrastructure than earlier research. As an example, consider the transportation sector, an infrastructure-heavy sector often used to proxy for infrastructure. The two datasets collectively include over 1,200 project records in the Transport and Storage sector within the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System (CRS). Individually coding infrastructure projects demonstrates that this sector contains over 700 actual unique infrastructure projects. About 450 of these fit the definition of either high-profile or prestige projects. Nearly half of the project records included in the transport sector are in fact additional financial transactions; surveying, maintenance, or other supplementary work; supplementary or auxiliary sub-infrastructures for a larger project; follow-on phases for an existing project; Chinese bank contributions to syndicated loans for projects not primarily financed or built by Chinese actors; or otherwise vague projects without sufficient information about a specific project. Directly coding unique infrastructure projects provides a more accurate picture of when and where the Chinese government has supported global infrastructure across the Global South.\n\nUsing these definitions reveals that China’s government has financed over 1,500 unique global infrastructure projects since 1949. The Chinese government committed over 400 Chinese global infrastructure during the twentieth century. The data also contain over 5,000 physical infrastructure projects, including both global as well as other smaller and less visible infrastructure projects, approximately 1,500 of which were provided before 2000.\n\nCombining data on China’s twentieth- and twenty-first-century global infrastructure provides useful context for the BRI. Figure 1 plots the number of global infrastructure projects – including both high-profile and prestige projects – committed annually by China’s government since 1949. It illustrates, in line with previous research, that the sheer annual volume of Chinese global infrastructure rose dramatically after the “Going Out” strategy and again after the launch of the BRI. However, it also shows that global infrastructure was actually equally or more salient as a share of China’s total development projects during the first two decades of the PRC. Global infrastructure was a major project class well before China’s development finance was reoriented to support national economic objectives outlined in the “Going Out” strategy and reinforced under the BRI. Over a quarter of all of China’s global infrastructure across the Global South to date was committed before 2000.\n\nSource: Reference Custer, Dreher and ElstonCuster et al. (2021); Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. (2022); Reference StrangeStrange (2023a). More lightly shaded bars indicate a higher level of salience, which is measured as the percentage of all Chinese development projects that are global infrastructure projects committed in a given year\n\nHigh-profile projects have accounted for the majority of Chinese global infrastructure. The data include nearly 1,200 high-profile projects in over 120 countries since 1949. Figure 2 plots the most common types of high-profile projects that China’s government has financed and built in developing countries since 1949. The pre- and post-2000 distributions are similar and show that transportation infrastructure such as roads, bridges, airports, railways, and maritime ports collectively account for over a third of China’s high-profile projects. Power generation infrastructure has been the other major project type and represents approximately a quarter of all high-profile projects. Figure B2 (online Appendix) maps the global distribution of high-profile infrastructure and Table A1 (online Appendix) lists the top host countries in terms of the number of projects. These major infrastructure projects have historically been most heavily concentrated in throughout various regions of Africa and Asia. High-profile infrastructure has been particularly prolific in Southeast Asia, and Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, and Vietnam are all among the top host countries.\n\nPrestige projects are smaller and less numerous than high-profile infrastructure, but have also been a consistent and important class of Chinese global infrastructure. They have appeared in roughly ninety developing countries since 1949, and as Figure 3 (and Table A2 in the online Appendix) show, China’s government has financed and constructed nearly 400 prestige projects since 1950. Over 120 of these were financed before 2000. In both the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, China has financed hundreds of prestige projects in the form of government buildings, stadiums, conference venues, and entertainment and cultural venues. Figure B3 in the online Appendix maps the global allocation of prestige projects since 1949. It illustrates that China’s government has allocated prestige projects mostly in developing countries located in Asia, Africa, and in small island regions such as Oceania and the Caribbean. Among African countries, DRC, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Guinea are all among the top host countries. Small island states such as Samoa, Cape Verde, Comoros, Vanuatu, and Antigua and Barbuda are also among the most common host states.\n\nSource: Reference StrangeStrange (2023b)\n\nHigh-profile and prestige infrastructure both constitute high-visibility, nationally salient projects, but China’s government has different motivations for financing them abroad. High-profile projects are typically heavily or at least partially motivated by commercial and development objectives. Their visibility and national presence – combined with their sheer material and financial scale, operational and financial complexity, and long time horizons – makes them textbook risky infrastructure projects as outlined in Section 2. In other research, I examine the factors that shape the global allocation of high-profile infrastructure and find that commercial considerations play an important role (Reference StrangeStrange 2023a). This finding is largely consistent with that of Reference Dreher, Fuchs, Parks, Strange and TierneyDreher et al. (2022), who show that debt-financed projects from China follow a commercial logic.\n\nIn contrast, prestige infrastructure is smaller and less heavily motivated by economic considerations on the part of host country governments, China’s government, and other state or non-state actors on either side. In my research on prestige infrastructure, I instead find that these projects are heavily concentrated in the smallest states in the Global South whose leaders can request, acquire, and strategically brand Chinese-financed prestige projects as symbolic national achievements. My analysis shows that prestige project allocation is also associated with lower levels of economic development and smaller populations (Reference StrangeStrange 2023b). In contrast, prestige projects have not been more likely to flow to more or less democratic governments. This suggests that these projects are not merely driven by host country leaders operating in highly clientelistic or institutionally weak political environments who need to rely on private goods provision to stay in office (e.g. Reference de Mesquita, Bruce, Siverson and SmithBueno de Mesquita et al. 2003; Reference Robinson and TorvikRobinson and Torvik 2005).\n\nGlobal infrastructure’s historical lineage is notable given important shifts in China’s approach to overseas development finance outlined in Section 2. While its global infrastructure initially peaked in the 1970s at the height of Mao’s revolutionary foreign policy, China continued to finance and build these projects albeit at a more modest scale during the 1980s and 1990s. Consider Chinese-financed prestige projects. By the middle of the 1980s, China’s government was squarely in the early reform and opening period and intent on recalibrating and downsizing its overstretched aid campaign. Nonetheless, in 1980 China and Cape Verde signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (经济技术合作协议)–a framework agreement commonly used throughout the twentieth century for China’s overseas development project agreements–wherein China agreed to fund the construction of a parliamentary hall in Cape Verde. The project was previously suspended, but in July the two sides fi"
