        "text": "Interim Monetary Policy Framework\n\nThe Kyrgyz Republic did not adopt its own currency after the break-up of the USSR. It remained in the ruble area and operated with a rudimentary set of monetary instruments and institutions, which did not function well. Attempts to agree with other former Soviet Union (FSU) countries on a coordinated monetary policy to reduce inflation were futile.\n\nAt the outset, even the basic monetary policy framework was unclear, as no decision was made whether to remain in the ruble area or introduce a national currency. On May 3, 1993, the discussions on the extent of economic independence from the FSU culminated in the parliament formally approving the issuance of the new currency, the som.\n\nThe IMF’s delivery of TA started at the beginning of the transition period, when the country was still part of the ruble area. TA consisted of the simultaneous review of several central banking topics and the appointment of resident general advisors to the NBKR until the time when more specialized advice was needed (i.e., until September 1996).\n\nThe central bank was very receptive to the TA recommendations. In addition, the work of subsequent resident advisors was moderately successful, even if they were somewhat overstretched because of the NBKR’s need for extensive hands-on advice.\n\nThe IMF assisted the central bank in implementing its reform agenda. The transition process in monetary operations included the introduction of a range of monetary policy instruments to allow for the implementation of indirect monetary control. As a first step, these measures included improvements to: (i) the system of refinancing credits and the accompanying refinancing policy of the NBKR; (ii) the reserve requirements system, including the remuneration of reserves; (iii) the auctions for government securities; (iv) the internal requirements for monetary policy decision-making within the central bank; and (v) the introduction in August 1993 of the Lombard facility.\n\nWork on the creation of financial markets started early in the transition process (May 1993). The initial steps included: (i) the establishment of weekly credit auctions; (ii) the development of the money market; (iii) weekly sales of foreign exchange by the NBKR to the interbank market; and (iv) putting into operation regular treasury-bill auctions.\n\nThe initial reforms were partially successful in developing the monetary framework. Some weaknesses derived from the fact that the foundation on which these reforms were built was unsophisticated. As a consequence, the early rules for the operation of some of these instruments and markets had to be changed later, while others, notably, credit auctions, had to be discontinued in a more advanced phase of the transition process.\n\nEffects of the 1998 Regional Crisis\n\nThe spill-over effects of the 1998 crisis dealt a severe blow to the nascent reforms in monetary operations. The adverse effects on the banking system led to a loss of confidence in financial intermediation and thereby impaired monetary operations. Specifically, the NBKR’s monetary instruments were rendered ineffective, liquidity was squeezed, and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy was severely constrained. The country came close to a financial crisis, requiring decisive action in order to stem the loss of confidence in a financial system that was facing the specter of depreciating financial assets and capital flight.\n\nThe liquidity problems stemmed from the market’s concern that the government might default on its domestic debt, as had happened in Russia. The key issue for monetary policy was the erosion of the demand for soms, coupled with falling confidence in banks. The lack of trust in the banking system translated into a lack of trust in the national currency and triggered a flight to safety in foreign currency deposits. The central bank reacted to these difficulties by drastically raising interest rates (to 64 percent at the height of the crisis). The annual inflation rate rose from 8.9 percent in 1998 to almost 40 percent in 1999.\n\nWith IMF technical support, the NBKR took steps to address the slack in the demand for T-bills and restore the credibility of the primary sales of these securities. Emphasis was placed on the need to limit the risks of contagion through the payments system and distress borrowing by illiquid banks. The NBKR was to provide sufficient liquidity support to solvent banks on a timely basis. However, this lender of last resort function had to be transparent and not used to prop up insolvent banks. Much against the initial IMF advice, the NBKR veered toward issuing central bank bills, risking impairing its balance sheet and compromising its autonomy somewhat. Furthermore, this went against the efforts that had been put on developing the T-bill market.\n\nThe macroeconomic effects of the 1998 crisis gradually wore off, with the process lasting from August-September 1998 until at least mid-2000. By 2001, there were positive signs regarding confidence in the domestic currency. Most of the framework for the effective implementation of monetary policy had been created by this time, including a wide range of monetary instruments (including central bank bills, repo and reverse repo operations, an overnight credit facility, reserve requirements, and the discount rate).\n\nCurrent Situation\n\nThe new set of monetary instruments still does not function properly, owing to the shallowness of the markets and certain operational deficiencies. In particular, the securities settlement systems are only partially satisfactory, there is no proper collateral, and the maturity profiles of some securities preferred by the markets are missing. The turnover in the securities market is very low, and this can be partly explained by the fact that: (i) the auction process allows the Ministry of Finance to significantly alter the composition of the tender after the bids are received; (ii) the Ministry of Finance does not advertise the tender schedule; and (iii) while there is little retail demand for securities, the demand from large investors is not met. The equity market is also very small. Neither the securities nor equity market employs delivery-versus-payment settlement; only central bank bills are settled within the NBKR in that manner. The money market is underdeveloped, and the development of the inter-bank market is undermined by banks’ ready access to the overnight credit facility of the NBKR at close to market interest rates. The problem of collateral has been a long-standing issue, which has not been solved since the start of the transition process. Collateral systems other than the traditional mortgage are poorly developed, due also to a lack of available securities and gaps in the legal framework. Implicitly admitting the problems with collateral, the NBKR (non-emergency) overnight credit facility is uncollateralized, potentially creating credit risk for the central bank. As in many other transition countries at an early stage of development, the maturity structure of the government securities is skewed toward the short end. The reason is essentially a lack of confidence in longer term investments by the retail sector, while banks have no interest in creating a maturity mismatch in their balance sheets, and institutional investors are very small in size.\n\nRecognizing the difficulties with the securities markets and the effectiveness of monetary instruments, the Swiss government has agreed to fund a regional project that aims at promoting the development of the government securities markets and domestic debt management, and thus strengthening the monetary policy framework. The project will be managed by the IMF and covers Azerbaijan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan. While sharing the broad overall objectives, the project has country specific components to reflect what needs to be done for each of the countries to increase the range of monetary instruments, deepen the markets, and improve their infrastructure. A long-term resident advisor has been appointed to coordinate the project. He will be stationed in the Kyrgyz Republic and will travel to the other countries as necessary. Additional TA will also be provided in other areas of monetary operations, such as liquidity management, and inflation forecasting.\n\nEarly Approach to Banking Problems\n\nEarly on, the NBKR tightened its licensing procedures and suspended new bank registrations until minimum capital requirements and prudential regulations had been reviewed and strengthened. The procedural and institutional arrangements of the Gosbank (the U.S.S.R. Central Bank) were inadequate to address the new situation and emerging challenges. Recognizing the capacity and manpower constraints, as well as institutional and accounting deficiencies, IMF TA recommendations proposed a sequential approach for building the necessary blocks for a strong supervisory function for the NBKR. IMF TA was coordinated with World Bank advice on bank legislation and accounting procedures. The Bank of England provided a foundation course in bank supervision to NBKR officials.\n\nIn light of initial constraints, in 1993, the NBKR adopted a two-stage approach to dealing with problems in the banking system. This entailed aggressive tackling of the problems of small banks and some holding operations for the four large banks formerly owned by the state. In the latter case, the objective was to prevent a further deterioration of the situation while crafting an overall strategy to address the problems with the assistance of donors. Within this framework, the IMF recommended that all banks with negative net worth be placed under direct supervision and that all undercapitalized banks draw up plans for recapitalization and restructuring, including other remedial measures such as strengthening credit polices and enforcing compliance with prudential rules in a time bound manner.1 Four banks were brought under direct supervision and two banks were placed under temporary administration and had their licenses suspended.\n\nRegarding the former state-owned banks, it was clear that the government had contributed to the banks’ problems through directed credit. This reinforced the view that the government needed to assist in the one-time recapitalization operation by substituting government bonds for the banks’ bad loans. The IMF alerted the NBKR to two alternative strategies, and pointed out the pros and cons of each. One approach would be to have an outside agency take over all or the largest part of banks’ bad loans and the other would be to have the banks manage their own restructuring processes. Although the IMF TA staff expressed marginal preference for the latter, a separate agency was used, namely the Debt Enterprise Bank Resolution Agency (DEBRA), which had been established under the World Bank financial sector program in the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\nToward a Comprehensive Bank Restructuring Plan\n\nResolution and stabilization remained elusive as over half of the banking system continued to experience severe capital and earning problems. The pitfalls of the partial, sometimes hesitant approach to solving banking system problems became apparent. In response, the IMF and the NBKR worked on a more comprehensive and proactive plan. This plan, which was conceived in 2000, was to be underpinned by a shared vision between the government and the NBKR. The stabilization of the banking system was to be accorded first priority in an overall strategy that sought to restructure the banking system and remove underlying weaknesses. The key elements of the strategy were to: (i) involve a high level policy committee in the design, coordination, and advocacy of the plan; (ii) resolve and restructure banks, while charging the recovery of assets to a separate agency (DEBRA); (iii) undertake a full assessment to determine the cost of bank resolution and ensure explicit budget support for recapitalization; (iv) identify and put in place the supportive institutional and legislative arrangements; and (v) make bank resolution transparent and fully accountable to the public.\n\nThe NBKR took a proactive stance in addressing banking distress by immediately establishing the high level committee, initiating the liquidation of some banks, and effectively marshaling assistance from multilateral institutions. The high level policy committee faced problems in ensuring proper governance, transparency, and accountability in several areas that were core to the banking sector problems. In particular, there was a lack of sound principles of bank governance, the legal system was inefficient and corrupt, and financial governance weak. Insider and directed lending to shareholders or their associates proliferated. The NBKR did not have any legal basis to conduct fit and proper tests of the owners and its powers over the Board of Directors were limited. The court system could overturn NBKR actions and thus further undermine the central bank’s supervisory function. A survey of several banks and law firms in the country revealed that the only two ways to win a judgment in a court were the use of political or family influence, or the use of financial incentives.\n\nFinancial sector reforms were an integral part of the authorities’ economic program, and were supported by IMF resources. From the start, the policy dialogue between the IMF and the NBKR has been covered both in the IMF’s TA and its surveillance activities. In 2002, an FSAP mission identified a number of challenges and constraints in the banking sector, and its recommendations further broadened the scope of the IMF’s TA.\n\nThere has also been close collaboration with the World Bank. In early 2001, a joint IMF/World Bank team proposed urgent action to break the cycle of abuses in the banking system, stem the accumulation of quasi-fiscal losses, stabilize the banking system and restore depositor confidence, and establish a sound framework for effective bank supervision. Immediate actions were to be taken to remove insolvent banks from the system, and clear signals were to be given to the public and bank shareholders that financial abuses would not be tolerated. Box 3.1. summarizes the five main guiding principles provided to the NBKR in this plan for addressing banking sector problems.\n\nBox 3.1.\n\nKyrgyz Republic: Guiding Principles for Banking Resolution\n\nPrinciple 1. The NBKR should take timely measures to address problem banks, based on prompt intervention on insolvent banks and intensified measures to ensure that systemically important banks remain sound. The NBKR should inform the government of the actions to be taken but not engage in policy debate about a rescue of a bank unless the bank has systemic significance.\n\nPrinciple 2. Shareholders should participate in problem bank resolution—by capitalizing banks to adequate standards or losing their investment in the event of closure and liquidation of an insolvent bank. Creditors should have the right to pursue shareholders in the event of mismanagement or misappropriation. This will herald a policy of “zero tolerance” of financial abuses.\n\nPrinciple 3. There should be no explicit or implicit deposit protection scheme. In the event of liquidation, non-affiliated depositors may be partly covered based on fair valuation of the assets of the bank.\n\nPrinciple 4. Thorough investigation of the causes of failure should be undertaken and in cases where shareholders or management have contributed to the failure through malfeasance, the cases should be referred to the Interior Ministry for prosecution.\n\nPrinciple 5. The costs of bank restructuring should be borne by the budget and not through monetization, which would impair the NBKR’s ability to maintain stable monetary conditions.\n\nThe NBKR made considerable progress in addressing the issues raised by IMF staff, closing four of the five problem banks identified for immediate action and initiating liquidation procedures. However, certain serious legal and institutional issues remained unresolved.\n\nCurrent Situation on Banking and Supervisory Issues\n\nThe banking sector in the Kyrgyz Republic remains shallow, with credit to the private sector amounting to a mere 11 percent of GDP at the end of 2006. By and large, confidence in the banking system has been restored. Two major banks—Inexin and Asia Universal Bank’ account for about 40 percent of the total assets of the sector.\n\nThe increase in minimum capital requirements has not led to a significant consolidation of the banking system as envisaged. However, overall, bank portfolios have strengthened, and the share of nonperforming assets in the total loan portfolio declined from 13 percent in 2002 to 6.5 percent in 2005. Over the same period, return on equity increased to 18 percent compared to about 5 percent in 2002. Partly reflecting the increased profitability of the sector and the increasing liberalization of foreign ownership clauses in the banking law, foreign participation in the banking sector has grown’ Kazakh banks have recently expressed interest in the sector.\n\nRecent TA in banking supervision took the form of peripatetic visits by a banking expert, who advised NBKR staff on early warning systems for banking sector difficulties, and stress tests; regulations governing banking; country risk analysis; foreign exchange position calculations; and market risk. Notwithstanding the numerous existing regulations and legislation, the NBKR still faces some challenges in improving its regulatory enforcement powers and authority; eliminating conflicting articles in various laws to ensure coherence among rules and regulations; and strengthening the enforcement of creditor rights and the insolvency regime. Overall, the management and the staff of the NBKR have been receptive to advice, welcome new ideas, and are eager to introduce the proper rules and regulations.\n\nSetting Up the Central Bank of an Independent Country\n\nBefore the Kyrgyz Republic became an independent country, its central bank was essentially a branch of the Gosbank, with limited tasks and responsibilities. At the beginning of the transition process, the Kyrgyz Republic faced the challenge of transforming this former branch of the Gosbank into a full fledged central bank that would dispense with directives and let market mechanisms work. Much of the early work on the central bank entailed the creation of basic functions, the legal framework, and building a core of staff with the requisite skills.\n\nThe creation of the new central bank required developing new functions or adapting old functions to the new situation. The building of the NBKR’s capacity to formulate and implement monetary policy was one of the early concerns. At the outset, the IMF and other providers impressed upon the Kyrgyz authorities the importance of autonomy for the NBKR, and also underscored the importance of accountability for its behavior in the execution of its mandate.\n\nAt the time of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the statutes adopted for the central bank did not ensure the independence of the central bank from the government nor did they provide for all key functions of a central bank operating in a market economy. There was an immediate need to create the proper legal framework in order to ensure the desired features of a central bank in a market-friendly setting. The new National Constitution of 1992 enshrined wider powers and more independence than before for the NBKR, and was followed at the end of 1992 by a new central bank law.\n\nThe structure, staff complement, and training of the new central bank also needed to be significantly improved. Initially, in the NBKR structure, the governor supervised many departments directly. The NBKR contained departments or other organizational units that disappeared or were significantly altered later as their relevance changed. Recognizing the need for fundamental changes, the structure of the NBKR and the supervisory tasks of its top managers had already been revamped in 1992, and was then gradually changed over the following years. New staff had to be hired to fulfill new tasks and, because everyone had been raised to be knowledgeable about the workings of a planned economy, they had to radically alter their whole outlook. Initially, this was only possible through training, which mostly took place outside the country.\n\nThe wholesale changes that were required to modernize the central bank would have been impossible without effective leadership at the NBKR, and would have been more protracted and costly, in terms of mistakes, had the international community—including the IMF—not provided substantial support. Starting in 1992, IMF technical support covered issues such as central bank legislation and organization, human resources, and training. In the initial period, the various IMF teams dealt with the basics, including providing “model” central bank laws, useful organizational structures, advice on the tasks of individual departments and their preferable groupings. IMF staff also arranged for training to be provided to the NBKR.\n\nSetting Up an Independent Central Bank\n\nSince the mid-1990s, the focus of central bank modernization has shifted from basic changes to the adaptation of the NBKR to the challenges of an independent central bank. This second phase, which followed further modifications in the central bank law in 1997, addressed questions of central bank independence, accountability, governance, and the details of internal organization.\n\nEven though the independence of the NBKR was enshrined in the constitution and the 1997 NBKR Law, the central bank has been repeatedly subjected to pressure from the government, the parliament, and the public. This pressure is exacerbated by the limited financial autonomy of the NBKR, which is reflected both in the legal framework (which, for example, sets a yearly ceiling on the development budget of 5 percent of international reserves and according to which the government could withdraw assets from the NBKR) and the weak balance sheet position of the NBKR on account of the need to service its own securities. To some extent independence has also been breached by an exaggerated notion of accountability in which the NBKR is subjected to continuous audits and inspections from various bodies, negatively affecting staff morale, as they are obliged to devote much of their time to these investigations (especially in the departments dealing with accounting and foreign exchange operations).\n\nCentral bank governance is crucial to build confidence in the institution, both within the political sphere and from the population. In the second stage of the development of the NBKR, governance issues revolved around the structure of the central bank Board, the number of its members, the role of the Board and that of management, and the accountability of the NBKR. While the central bank law set the number of Board members at nine, a presidential decree of 2004 cut this down to seven, with repercussions for the organizational chart of the NBKR, and ultimately having a negative effect on its independence. As for the structure of the Board, the NBKR made great efforts to follow best international practices by designating the governor as the chief executive officer and laying down (albeit sometimes with some contradictions) the tasks and responsibilities of individual members. Internal rules also describe the hierarchy of decision-making procedures, and the roles and composition of Board committees.\n\nThe smooth functioning of the NBKR is enhanced by the importance given to internal organizational issues and, more generally, personnel matters. The organizational structure was revamped more than once during the period in question, with the last change—as indicated above—resulting from the externally-imposed decrease in the number of Board members. The number of staff has continued to increase significantly during the last couple of years.\n\nOverall, the NBKR has carried out extensive changes to modernize its structure and operations. Many of these changes were implemented based on earlier advice, since the NBKR very enthusiastically made use of international assistance to improve its operations. At the same time, especially in the latter phases, it also actively worked to find the best solution in the particular circumstances it was facing.\n\nRuble-Based System\n\nIn the initial phase of independence (between 1991 and 1993), the Kyrgyz Republic used the Russian ruble as the currency for payments. The most important payment instrument was cash, which was supplied by the central bank of Russia, and this was problematic.2 The use of non-cash payments was restricted by the limited use of bank accounts and the absence of bank branches in remote areas. Consequently, the government made efforts to introduce and encourage the use of direct deposits and payments. Regional clearing centers were set up to process wholesale payments. However, paper records of all transactions were sent to Bishkek only every five days, and this increased credit risks considerably. Almost all interbank payments cleared through accounts in the central bank, and this slowed down the payment process considerably in the early stages. A significant “float” developed because, after a commercial bank debited the sender’s account, several days passed before the receiver’s account was credited (in 1992 some banks estimated the float to have reached 40 percent of their capital).\n\nThe crucial element in the early plans for the modernization of the payments system entailed the modernization of the clearing centers. The goal was to improve the speed and efficiency of the payments system by providing each center with computers and hence establishing the possibility of on-line connections between them. The new system was planned in such a way as to lessen the risks emanating from the payments system and to reduce the size of the float, and hence make the system more efficient and less costly for the ultimate users. The early plans were supported by extensive foreign assistance, including by the IMF, as well as outstanding support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).\n\nUsing the ruble had not only the disadvantage of possible cash shortages, but severe difficulties emerged in payments between the former Soviet republics. These difficulties originated in the inability of some central banks and enterprises to make payments, but also in the inefficiency of the payments system itself.3 In addition to the modernization of the clearing centers within the Kyrgyz Republic, initiatives were taken to solve the difficulties in payments between the former Soviet republics. One initiative was to set up an interstate bank that would handle these payments. Such initiatives, however, were superseded by the decision of the Kyrgyz Republic and other former republics to issue their own currency.\n\nFurther Work in Developing the Payments System\n\nAfter the introduction of the new currency, the authorities’ attention shifted to changes that were required to make the existing payments system more efficient and to new improvements that needed to be made. The payments system projects (especially the automated clearing house project and the setting up of a gross settlement system) were heavily supported by the JICA, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the IMF. Nevertheless, the success of the projects absolutely hinged on the NBKR, which did its best, but encountered human resource capacity constraints in some areas. Thus, the project for the development of the gross settlement system started very early on, but due to these constraints it stalled during the second half of the 1990s.4 In contrast to the lengthy delays in the area of gross settlements, the projects for the improvements in the paper-based clearing system and for the setting up of an automated clearing house, succeeded (albeit with minor delays).\n\nThe NBKR continued to view the payments system as a critical component of economic development and, in order to achieve more success, developed a new phase of payments system reform. This phase of the reform, which started in 2003, focuses on the setting up of the electronic disbursement of salaries and pensions, a bulk clearing system, a card processing center and, ultimately, a real time gross settlement system. This ongoing work also has a clear link with IMF surveillance, as the preparation of a payments system action plan is part of the government’s economic program. The projects are assisted by the IMF, the World Bank, and the Swiss and Danish central banks."
