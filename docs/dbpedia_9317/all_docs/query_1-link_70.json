        "text": "The Republic of Montenegro on the south-eastern Adriatic coast in south-east Europe with the capital Podgorica covers 13,812 km². The country name Crna Gora means \"Black Mountain\" and refers to the mountainous country. The state borders Croatia to the far west, Bosnia-Herzegovina to the north-west, Serbia to the north-east, Kosovo to the east and Albania to the south-east. Following a referendum in 1992, Montenegro remained part of Yugoslavia for the time being. After the break-up of Yugoslavia triggered by the war, the remaining state was called Serbia-Montenegro from 2003. Finally, in 2006, Montenegro also became an independent state following a new referendum."
