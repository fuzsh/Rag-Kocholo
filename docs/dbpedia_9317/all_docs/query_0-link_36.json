        "text": "Transforming Education\n\nGlobal Education is in crisis. Today nearly 300 million children don’t go to school, more than 80% of whom are found in low-income countries, and 800 million young people will leave school without any qualifications. Recent data shows that global learning poverty in low- and middle-income countries is estimated to have risen to 70%, with more than half of the world’s children unable to read or write a simple text at the age of 10 and no accredited skills for the workplace when they leave school. Coupled with the ‘violation’ of children’s right to education evidenced by these high levels of learning poverty, the latter is bound to have a devastating impact on future productivity, earnings, and well-being for this generation of children and youth, their families, and the world’s economy.\n\nThis failure to deliver an inclusive and equitable, academic, and vocational quality education to all puts us at grave risk of not achieving the laudable aims of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 and of the many other SDGs dependent or reliant on it. It also means we are only providing for half of our future.\n\nEducation budgets in low- and lower-middle-income countries will have to more than double to $3 trillion by 2030 if we are to achieve SDG 4 and universal access to quality education. Without action, the loss in lifetime earnings of the current generation of school-age children and youth due to shortcomings in education investment is estimated to amount to more than 15% of today’s global GDP ($21 trillion). This economic cost will be disproportionately borne by low- and middle-income countries and this generation of their students, further aggravating already serious intergenerational inequalities and divides, as well as gaps and divides between and within countries.\n\nIn spite of this recognised demand for investment, countries across the globe have had to cope with the financial pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic, now compounded by the food, energy, debt, and currency crises triggered and exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, making education compete for the limited resources governments have available. But the reduction in education spending is particularly paradoxical since an educated and skilled workforce is central to escaping poverty, eliminating the gender and wealth disparities that continue to plague our societies, and to achieving economic recovery and growth. While the internationally recommended level of spending on education is at least 4% of GDP, the majority of the world’s 82 low- and lower-middle income countries continue to spend less, in some cases less than 2% of GDP.\n\nAnd sadly, despite promises being made, the development aid rich countries currently channel to education has been falling too – from 8.5% in 2010 to just 6.6% in 2020. Today, even when all the world’s education aid is combined, including that from bilateral and multilateral sources, it amounts to just $18 per African child, hardly enough to pay for a textbook, far less a teacher or a classroom.\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres will convene the Transforming Education Summit which will be taking place in New York this September. With COVID-19 waning, and in light of the complexity of converging crises, we must now seriously get into building back better mode and address the enormous challenge of access to education for all, upon which much of our future will depend. Without addressing the persistent exclusion of minorities, migrants, refugees and other marginalised groups in our education systems, the entrenchment of existing inequalities within societies will only grow deeper and we will fail to achieve inclusive, peaceful and sustained development.\n\nModernisation of education systems through better training and rewards for teachers, the application of new technologies and digital learning and new pathways for skills training will make an important difference on the outcomes we are able to achieve – but so will money. One proposal now being considered is for a Compact for Global Education between developing countries and the developed economies that provide donor aid.\n\nThrough such a Compact, countries would agree to raise education spending in stages to at least 4-6% of their national income, over a period of five years, and invest at least 15% and hopefully 20% of all their public spending in education.\n\nSustainable funding for education can be increased through domestic action to reform national tax systems, coupled with international action to cut tax loopholes and illicit financial flow. Implementing taxation reforms that support equity and redistribution can address critical poverty and inequality concerns in many low- and middle-income countries.\n\nIn parallel, multilateral institutions can offer enhanced support in order to encourage the fast-tracking of educational opportunities.\n\nThe World Bank’s low-income facility – the International Development Association (IDA) ¬– could raise its spending on education from 10% to 15%, leveraging new resources from donors and an enhanced use of its reflows – the capital returned from past loans – to fund this enhanced spending. Larger support for schools and teachers in the developing world alone would unlock education opportunities for more than 20 million children every year in the poorest countries.\n\nThe biggest number of out-of-school children are located in lower-middle-income countries, home to 700 million children. In turn, these countries are today hosting a high share of the world’s refugees and displaced young people. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the World Bank Group’s middle-income country facility, however, currently allocates just 5% of its loans to education in lower-middle-income countries, down from an already very low 6% in 2010.\n\nIDA and IBRD funding could be complemented through a revival of the International Finance Facility for Education put forth several years ago by the Education Commission in The Learning Generation report. This Facility would fund education programs in low- and lower-middle-income countries at low-interest rates, akin to that of IDA’s credits, using guarantees backed by grants from donor countries through the various multilateral development banks.\n\nSuch funding would be additional to bilateral aid from Development Assistance Committee (DAC) donors who would commit to higher Official Development Assistance (ODA) levels, with a greater amount of the latter channeled through international and multilateral institutions, including UNESCO, UNICEF, and other UN agencies, and through educational initiatives such as the Global Partnership for Education and Education Cannot Wait. Funding could be further enhanced by a call for greater and more innovative social impact investment in education through cross-border individual and corporate philanthropy in the sector.\n\nOver the next five years, this plan could produce an extra $10 billion of new educational funds for low-income countries, and yet another $10 billion in additional resources for middle-income countries.\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres in the 2021 Our Common Agenda report, identified the need for a second World Social Summit in 2025. This event could serve as a critical platform to support better coordination and more innovative responses for catalysing the type of initiatives needed to transform the education sector globally.\n\nWe are so far away from our goal of universal education by 2030 that unless we act quickly and generously we will fall further behind on our SDG 4 commitment to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.” We, therefore, call on countries to support these bold measures.\n\nWe can be the first generation in history where every child goes to school. Instead of developing some of the potential for some children in some countries, we can develop the potential for all children in all countries, but we have to act. To achieve this, we urge all countries in the UN family to support this initiative at the summit on 19th September."
