        "text": "Note: Our branches no longer have foreign currency cash on-hand available for over-the-counter same-day purchase and we no longer can take foreign currency cash orders over the phone.\n\nYou can order foreign currency cash online, using the mobile app, or in person at a Wells Fargo branch and have currency delivered within 2-7 business days.\n\nOnline. To order through Wells Fargo Online®, log into online banking and select foreign currency cash under the Accounts tab.\n\nMobile. Order using the Wells Fargo Mobile® app. Tap Menu on the bottom bar, select Account Services, then select Foreign Currency.\n\nUsing an eligible Wells Fargo checking or savings account, it takes just minutes to place an order online or mobile. Foreign currency cash orders can be delivered to your home address or scheduled for local branch pickup. The minimum foreign currency cash order amount is $200, and orders over $3,000 USD must be picked up at a branch. Currently, business accounts cannot be used when ordering foreign currency cash online or mobile.\n\nIn person. Wells Fargo account holders can order foreign currency cash at any Wells Fargo branch, for branch pickup.\n\nFor online orders, the minimum amount is $200, and orders over $3,000 USD must be picked up at a branch.\n\nMore information about ordering foreign currency online:\n\nThe shipping and handling fee may vary based on the USD amount of foreign currency cash that you order. The shipping and handling fee will be added to your total order amount. We'll send you an email confirmation when your order ships. Note: Less common currencies may take longer to process and deliver, due to limited availability. Delivery to Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. territories may take longer. A signature is required upon delivery. We do not deliver to P.O. boxes.\n\nOften the foreign currency cash rate quoted by Wells Fargo can be a buy or sell rate, which can differ. The foreign currency cash rate includes costs, such as shipping and handling, transaction processing, and also includes the revenue Wells Fargo earns. Wells Fargo may offer different rates to different counterparties for the same or similar transactions. No representation is made that Wells Fargo’s pricing is reflective of rate sources or publications, or rates being offered by other providers. Wells Fargo provides rates at its sole discretion.\n\nOrders placed online, or via mobile app, (less than $3,000 (USD equivalent)) can be delivered to the home address saved in your Wells Fargo customer profile. Wells Fargo delivers within the United States only and cannot deliver to P.O. boxes. A signature is required upon delivery. If your home address has restrictions that prevent delivery, you can place a foreign currency cash order online, or in person and have it delivered to a nearby Wells Fargo branch. Orders placed for a business checking or savings account can only be delivered to a Wells Fargo branch.\n\nNote: Our branches no longer have foreign currency cash on-hand available for over-the-counter same-day purchase and we no longer can take foreign currency cash orders over the phone.\n\nIn person. Wells Fargo account holders and authorized signers can order foreign currency cash at any Wells Fargo branch.\n\nWhether or not the wire transfer fee is waived, Wells Fargo makes money when we convert one currency to another currency for you. The exchange rate used when Wells Fargo converts one currency to another is set at our sole discretion, and it includes a markup. The markup is designed to compensate us for several considerations including, without limitation, costs incurred, market risks, and our desired return. The applicable exchange rate does not include, and is separate from, any applicable fees. The exchange rate Wells Fargo provides to you may be different from exchange rates you see elsewhere. Different customers may receive different rates for transactions that are the same or similar. The applicable exchange rate may vary based on such factors including, but not limited to, currency pair, transaction size, payment channel and product type, such as foreign currency cash, checks, remittances, and wire transfers. Foreign exchange markets are dynamic and rates fluctuate over time based on market conditions, liquidity, and risks. Wells Fargo is your arms-length counterparty on foreign exchange transactions. We may refuse to process any request for a foreign exchange transaction.\n\nIncoming wire transfers received in a foreign currency for payment into your account will be converted into U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate without prior notice to you. For more information, see the “Applicable Exchange Rate” and “Incoming international wire transfer” sections of the Deposit Account Agreement.\n\nFees may be charged by third parties or other banks, in addition to those described above."
