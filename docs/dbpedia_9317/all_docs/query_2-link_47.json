        "text": "European Union candidate Montenegro is seeking to expand ties with the bloc, including possibly refinancing a Chinese loan it took to build its first highway that once threatened to wreck its public finances.\n\nAfter the country of 620,000 underwent a historic power shift last year, Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapic ’s government has appealed for EU support to refinance the debt, which equaled a fifth of the economy when it was taken in 2014. A previous government borrowed the funds under China’s Belt and Road initiative in defiance of warnings that it would subject Montenegro to undue influence from Beijing."
