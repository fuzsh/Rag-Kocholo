        "text": "SUMMARY The geographical proximity of the euro area as well as the close trade and financial relationship with Eurozone countries , accelerated the wide acceptance of Euro parallel with domestic national currency in all Balkan countries , while Montenegro and Kosovo accepted euro as their official tender. However , the turbulences in the Eurozone, brought many challenges to highly euroised Western Balkan countries including vulnerability of the financial system to sudden changes in capital flows, weakening the central banks \" effectiveness in the conduct of their monetary policy in providing macroeconomic and financial stability. Thus, the WBC monetary authorities were forced to introduce certain macro-prudential measures, to initiated the process the reversible process of de-euroisation. The aim of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of the measures for de-euroisation, introduced by the authorities in three West Balkans countries , Macedonia, Serbia and Albania through measuring the effect of the interest rates spreads on both loans and deposits in local currencies and those expressed or indexed in euro.\n\nThe inflation in the first and half year after the introduction of Euro in Slovenia was of a short-term nature, conditioned also by a favorable economic growth. The cumulative (retail) price level growth was also conditioned by internal factors (a weak competition in certain sectors and an increase in domestic demand) and external factors (some originate from the increase in\n\nEven after more than a decade of low inflation, Croatia remains highly dollarized. Commercial hanks avoid currency mismatch hy indexing loans to the exchange rate. Although this eliminates direct currency risk, it creates credit risk, because any larger depreciation might induce borrower defaults. Monetary and exchange rate policies focus on exchange rate smoothing to safeguard financial stability. DoUarization has prevented the use of monetary policy to stabilize output. Given Croatia's likely entry into the EU and adoption ofthe Euro, dedollarization .seems unfeasible. Rather than attempting to reverse doUarization, the central bank has taken measures to make the banking system more robust to shocks. {JEL E52, E58, F31, G21, P24)\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a small and open economy in transition with great distrust in local authorities and institutions. The country applies a currency board as the only acceptable and optimal exchange rate system in order to protect its monetary policy from political influences. The strict rules of the currency board provide monetary stability and confidence in the domestic currency, but disable the pursuit of discretionary monetary policy and limit autonomous fiscal policy for the purpose of stimulating an investment cycle and economic development without coordinated accompanying support of monetary policy.The subject of this paper is an analysis of the short-term and long-term effects of the currency board application in Bosnia and Herzegovina in conditions of increasing liberalization through the process of European integration. Given the negative consequences and limitations of the currency board system, this paper analyses in particular the possibility of introducing a cent..."
