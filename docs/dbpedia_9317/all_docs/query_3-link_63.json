        "text": "Language English\n\nIndependent since 2006, Montenegro is one of only two states (the other is Macedonia) to have separated peacefully from what used to be Yugoslavia. The largely coastal republic has the advantage of a tourism-oriented economy. Its small size (pop: 650,000) means it can be easier to carry out speedy, high-impact reforms. But Montenegro's short history as a democratic country also means that law-based national institutions have had to be built, in some cases, from the ground up. For the EU candidate country to reap the full benefits of the rule of law, the local skills base and judicial capacity need to grow further.\n\nIDLO supports Forum in Montenegro to build regional judiciary links\n\nStronger judicial cooperation across the Western Balkans region is crucial for countering serious crimes – notably money laundering, corruption, organized crime, cybercrime and war crimes – speakers underscored at the Third Regional Forum on Judicial Cooperation in Budva, Montenegro.\n\nIDLO promotes anti-corruption dialogue with students in Montenegro\n\nStudents and scholars from 30 countries convened in Igalo, a coastal village in Montenegro, to study, discuss and exchange views on the rule of law at the European Union and Legal Reform Summer School in July 2019.\n\nProtecting competition in Montenegro\n\nCompetition is crucial to developing healthy and productive markets, strengthening the private sector, reducing poverty and promoting economic growth. However, it can be challenging to develop effective competition policy, especially in transition countries. In Montenegro, judges are hampered by insufficient knowledge of competition law, limited experience with related cases, and a lack of training.\n\nConfidence and judicial cooperation: Regional Forum in Montenegro\n\nIDLO together with the Government of Montenegro organized a Regional Forum on Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters in Bar, Montenegro from 14 – 15 December. The forum facilitated dialogue about cross-border judicial cooperation for effective criminal investigation in the region.\n\nEBRD and IDLO strengthen judicial capacity building\n\nEBRD and IDLO strengthen judicial capacity building\n\nInvestment climate to improve through creation of transparent and predictable legal environment\n\nSupporting rule of law reforms in Montenegro\n\nLanguages: English - Pусский\n\nWidely considered to improve the effectiveness of justice systems by helping both the State and litigants avoid the costs and delays of court procedures, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is a commonly used mechanism to resolve conflicts in many countries.\n\nReflections on IDLO’s 2016 work in the EECA region\n\nOn a recent trip to a Central Asian preliminary detention center, the custodians proudly showed us the new ventilation system to prevent from spread of TB – a cut-in window directly across the door.\n\nPromoting legal cooperation between Italy and Montenegro\n\nItalian and Montenegrin justice sector counterparts and government representatives discussed enhancing public access to judicial information in commercial law cases and ways to further strengthen Italian-Montenegrin legal cooperation in a roundtable event held at IDLO’s headquarters in Rome.\n\nMs Senka Danilovic, from the Judicial Training Center (JTC) in Montenegro\n\n\"In 2016, IDLO - with financial assistance from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Government of Italy - conducted a project in commercial law judicial training support in Montenegro.\n\nPages"
