        "text": "Expanding the EBRD's regions of operations\n\nReforms were supported by sound advice, training and technical expertise, and supplemented by major investments in the private and public sectors. With domestic capital on its own insufficient to finance transition, the EBRD helped to bring in external capital from both private and public sources.\n\nSuch experience has stood the EBRD in good stead when it has expanded its original region of operations - four times already - into new countries such as Mongolia (2006), Türkiye (2009), Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Kosovo (in 2012), Cyprus (2014), Greece (2015) and Lebanon (2017).\n\nIt is currently active in more than 35 countries from central Europe to central Asia and the southern and eastern Mediterranean, plus the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nAt our 2023 Annual Meeting our Governors have approved amendments to the Bank’s statutes to enable the limited and incremental expansion of its operations to sub-Saharan Africa and Iraq. From 2025 to 2030, the EBRD will be able to invest in up to six countries in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nCzechia is the only member to have ‘graduated’ from the EBRD, which it did in 2007. However, in 2021, after a request by its government to help with the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the Bank agreed to resume investing in the country for a limited period.\n\nThe EBRD’s understanding of how a market economy works and engagement with other international financial institutions also allowed us to play a crucial role in stabilising its regions and planning for recovery after the shock of the global financial crisis in 2008.\n\nPart of our response to that crisis was a substantial and rapid increase in the volume of our operations. That increase continued throughout the second decade of the century, despite a new operational approach to Russia, previously the EBRD’s largest country by business volume, under which, following guidance from a majority of our Directors, the Bank no longer undertook new business there. In 2022, soon after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Bank's Governors voted to suspend Russia's and Belarus's access to Bank resources.\n\nAt the end of 2023 our governors approved a resolution to increase the Bank’s paid-in capital by €4 billion, bringing its capital base to €34 billion. This was the third such increase in our history (the others being in 1996 and 2010).\n\nThe additional capital from shareholders is aimed at providing significant and sustained investment for Ukraine’s real economy, both in wartime and during reconstruction, and helping support our other priorities across all economies where we operate. The EBRD significantly ramped up its support for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion of the country in February 2022.\n\nWhile the Bank remains as committed to fulfilling its original mandate as ever, its understanding of what the transition to market economics actually entails has evolved in the light of recent history.\n\nAt the beginning of 2017, for example, we began applying a new transition concept which defines a well-functioning market economy as more than just competitive; it should be inclusive, well-governed, green, resilient and integrated as well.\n\nAnd over the nearly 30 years of our existence, we have become more convinced than ever before that financing projects alone cannot bring about the changes our countries need. They need help with policy reform and in creating an enabling investment climate as well.\n\nThe EBRD's unique mandate\n\nUniquely for a development bank, the EBRD has a political mandate in that it assists only those countries ‘committed to and applying the principles of multi-party democracy [and]pluralism’.\n\nSafeguarding the environment and a commitment to sustainable energy have also always been central to the EBRD’s activity. A commitment to promote ‘environmentally sound and sustainable development’ was made explicit at its founding.\n\nMore recently, our Green Economy Transition approach has made climate finance a key measure of the Bank’s performance. We are now committed to ensuring that, by 2025, the majority of our business volume is green. That target was first hit in 2021, when green finance accounted for 51 per cent of our annual business volume. At our 2021 Annual Meeting our Governors also approved our full alignment with the Paris Agreement by the end of 2022 and we plan to be a majority green bank by 2025.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic of 2020 was a huge challenge to the countries where the EBRD works, all our shareholders and the Bank itself. The EBRD responded by committing all its activity in 2020 and 2021 to countering its economic impact.\n\nThe EBRD serves the interests of all its shareholders - 73 countries from five continents plus the European Union and the European Investment Bank - not just those countries which receive its investments (a record €13.1 billion in 2022). At the same time, the number of EBRD shareholders is still increasing; recent new members include China, India, San Marino, Libya, United Arab Emirates, Algeria and Iraq. Indeed, the EBRD is one of only two major multilateral development banks currently expanding its shareholder base.\n\nHowever many shareholders the EBRD has, we all stand to gain from the EBRD regions' closer and deeper integration into the global economy and their economies’ continued progress on their transition journeys."
