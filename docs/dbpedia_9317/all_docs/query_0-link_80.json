        "text": "This paper contributes to the literature on hyperinflation and stabilizations by analyzing the great Yugoslav hyperinflation and stabilization during the period 1992 to 1994. The paper makes three contributions. First, it provides updated and more accurate estimates of key economic variables on economic activity, public finances, and seigniorage revenues during hyperinflation based on most recent and updated data. Second, it identifies and analyzes salient features, causes, transmission mechanisms, and monetary consequences of the extreme Yugoslav hyperinflation in the period 1992-1994. It discusses what we call the fundamental equations of the Yugoslav hyperinflation and their implications for inflation expectations and subsequent stabilization. And third, it analyzes the implementation, achievements, and challenges of the currency reform and stabilization program that ended hyperinflation, highlighting the roles of the currency board, currency reform, and of the architect of the p...\n\nThe paper analyses the causes and dynamics of hyperinflation in the Republic of Croatia – which lasted from 1991 to 1993. Through the analysis of primary and secondary sources, the individual causes of hyperinflation are broken down, and based on the analysis the authors conclude that while the primary inflationary impulse is due to the economic legacy of Yugoslavia, and historical circumstances such as war and the collapse of the former state, the rise in prices would not have been maintained had there not been inflationary taxation as a form of accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. The authors aim to provide newer generations of economists with a complete overview of factors that instigated and maintained inflation in this turbulent and transitory period in Croatia’s history.\n\nThe violent dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which spanned throughout the 1990s has a complex and profound back-story. Nationalist tendencies played a significant role in Yugoslavia’s demise, however it is often omitted that the unstable economic situation in Yugoslavia during the 1980s also majorly contributed to the sudden destructive collapse of the Socialist Federative Republic a quarter century ago. In this research paper, the economic crisis of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia throughout the 1980s shall be observed. In order to fully grasp the actual reasons for the failing Yugoslav economy, Tito’s economic policies that echoed beyond his death into the 1980s shall be analyzed as well. The role of the International Monetary Fund during the Yugoslav economic crisis in the 1980s also will be covered, since the IMF majorly intervened in order to decrease the Yugoslav trade deficits, introducing a “shock therapy” to the Yugoslav economy. Lastly, it shall be observed to what extent the economic crisis and the IMF contributed to the dissolution of Tito’s 2nd Yugoslavia, which officially started in 1991 with the declaration of independence by Slovenia and Croatia.\n\nSFRY republics achieved a different level of economic development, despite unique economic system and the economic policy governed at the state (federal) level. After the dissolution of Yugoslavia, independent countries have achieved different results in economic growth and overall prosperity. Following the declaration of independence , new states have begun the process of economic and institutional reforms, towards the development of modern, market economies, with institutional solutions adapted to the strategic choices. Unique strategic concept was membership in the European Union, while in some elements different concepts of economic policy were applied. Monetary policy is example (Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia opted for new domestic currency, Serbia continued using the dinar, the official currency of the former Yugoslavia, Montenegro was a dollarized (eurized) economy partly since 1999. and in its entirety since 2000, while Bosnia and Herzegovina introduced its own currency, but according to the currency board model), dynamics and models of privatization were also not identical, as was the degree of economic liberalization. Also, different instrument of fiscal and foreign trade policy were often applied. Slovenia and Croatia are members of the European Union, while Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia are in the process of accession, with still uncertain dynamics of completing this process. The level of economic development, measured with GDP per capita (2015) ranges from $ 4,249 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to $ 20,728 in Slovenia. The aim of the research is the analysis of factors that resulted in different levels of economic transformation of the former Yugoslav republics, and the analysis of potential challenges of future economic growth .\n\nThe main goal of this paper is to analyze the economic transition process in the Western Balkans (WB) in the period between 2000-2014. In this period, countries made radical political changes and economic reforms. They opened up to global trade, became increasingly export-oriented and expanded the role of the private sector. They also fulfilled criteria regarding convertibility of the current account, interest rates liberalization, price liberalization and small-scale privatization. However, reforms, such as large-scale privatization, competition policy and governance and enterprise restructuring, have still been delayed. In all WB countries except in Serbia, the inflation rate during this period is low, which is very big achievement taking into account the history of hyperinflation at the beginning of the transition. Furthermore, from the year 2000 onwards, the countries under review also made progress in real convergence, but the gaps in terms of income per capita relative to the ...\n\nSuccessful functioning of monetary and fiscal policies is a prerequisite for economic growth of any economy. This paper is designed in a way that, among other things, analyzes two very important points of these policies, namely the budget on the one hand and inflation on the other. Also, the adoption of economic reform agenda, and the entry into force of the Stabilization and Association Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) show serious intention to join the European Union. We determine the directions which must guide the consolidation of B&H fiscal system in order to create conditions for economic growth. Emphasis is placed on the importance of fiscal consolidation in B&H, and the consequences that may result if the implementation of fiscal consolidation is not done. This paper includes a comparison of the Croatian example as a neighbouring country in the period when it was a candidate for the membership in the EU, before the accession on 1 July 2013, because the reforms that Croatia had to undertake as a candidate country will also await B&H as a potential candidate for EU membership. The comparison established that the fiscal situation on the territory of B&H is identical to the status of neighbouring countries, so equal fiscal consolidation could be done. It indicates the reforms that authorities would need to undertake in the area of consolidation of the fiscal system. On the other hand, inflation is a monetary phenomenon that has preoccupied economists for decades. In this paper we analyze the inflation as a monetary phenomenon, and point out results of inflation and economic growth correlation. Due to the negative correlation between high inflation and economic growth, driven by these postulates, we analyze the level of inflation in B&H and the region to assess the success of the Central bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Also, this paper analyzes the fulfilment of Maastricht criteria relating to inflation, and the result obtained confirms that at this aspect Bosnia and Herzegovina fulfils this criterion."
