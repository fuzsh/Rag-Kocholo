        "text": "The Maastricht Treaty seems to have locked the EU countries into a process that is likely to lead their economies to full monetary unification by the year 2002. Following the decisions taken at the Madrid European Council in December 1995, the main uncertainties have now been dispelled. An agreement was reached then on the name of the single currency, to be called the euro, and the timetable for its introduction was set.\n\nIn spring 1998, the European Council will name the first group of EU countries to take part in EMU, that is, those member countries that meet the convergence criteria laid down in the treaty. The ECB will be established no later than July 1, 1998. On January 1, 1999, EMU will effectively start, with the rates of conversion between the euro and the participating currencies being fixed irrevocably. The ECB, in conjunction with the participating national central banks, will start using euros for its monetary policy operations, and new issues of tradable public debt will be denominated in euros. Most participating countries are likely to redenominate outstanding stocks of public debt from January 1, 1999. Banks and firms in the EU will have the option of operating in euros. In the first half of 2002, the national currencies of participating countries will be substituted by new notes and coins denominated in euros. The final changeover to the single currency will thus be completed by July 1, 2002, at the latest. All EU countries appear committed to the final goal, with the possible exception of Britain, although some of them may take longer to fulfill the criteria laid out in the Maastricht Treaty.\n\nMany operational uncertainties remain (Portes, 1996), and there are still potential blocks—more political than economic—associated with the “convergence criteria.” Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that a major new international currency will emerge from January 1, 1999. We shall go even further and assume that not too long after that, the euro area will cover the entire existing EU, although it will take longer to bring in the countries expected to join the EU from 2002–2003 onward. We assume also that the ECB will quickly establish its credibility and reputation, and our arguments are based on the presumption of a “neutral” monetary policy relative to the initial (pre-euro) position.\n\nEMU and the introduction of the euro are bound to have important international implications. The new currency will be issued on behalf of a large economic area, by a new central bank that will be responsible for the joint monetary policy of the EU. International institutions such as the Group of Seven industrial countries, the IMF, and the OECD will have to adapt (see Alogoskoufis and Portes, 1991), but, most important, there will be a major shock to the existing international monetary and exchange rate system. Within a time frame that is difficult to specify, the euro will emerge as a serious challenger for the role of the U.S. dollar as the dominant international means of payment, unit of account, and store of value. The monetary policies of the new ECB will have far more important international spillovers than those of any of the existing central banks of the EU countries. The extent of these spillovers is likely to affect the process of international policy coordination and the exchange rate regime of all the main industrial economies.\n\nIn this paper we examine the prospective implications of the creation of the euro for the international monetary system. We confine our attention to the implications after the year 1999, when, according to the timetable agreed upon in the 1995 Madrid summit of the EU, the euro will be introduced in asset markets. Part of our discussion is more relevant for the period after 2002, when the existing EU currencies will have been replaced by the single currency.\n\nWe concentrate on two main issues: first, on the prospective role of the euro as an international means of payment, unit of account, and store of value, and the process through which these roles develop; and second, on the prospective changes that EMU will imply for the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro, both in the short and in the long run.\n\nWe suggest that the introduction of the euro in financial markets in 1999 is likely to upset the role of the dollar as the major international currency. Following an initial period of consolidation after the introduction of the euro in financial markets, we anticipate strong demand to use the euro as an international store of value, unit of account, and means of payment. Thickness externalities in the use of the euro as a means of payment, together with integration of the East European countries into the EU, as well as the development of euro financial markets, will be major medium- to long-term influences. Because of inertia and hysteresis, however, the dollar will remain quantitatively dominant for some time. With the possibility of multiple equilibria and threshold effects, we would not expect a quick transition to a new equilibrium. But the early period could see considerable instability associated with the emergence of the euro.\n\nEarly on, the main effect of the introduction of the euro will come through portfolio shifts that are likely to favor a sharp appreciation of the new currency vis-à-vis the dollar (and the yen). As euro securities markets become deeper and more liquid, and transactions costs fall, euro assets will become more attractive and the use of the euro as a vehicle currency will expand.\n\nBecause of the sluggish response of trade flows, the current account surplus of the EU will widen, and the initial appreciation will overshoot the long-run equilibrium exchange rate of the euro. This will be followed by a gradual depreciation, with interest rates falling. After the initial J-curve effects have worked through, the current account of the EU will worsen. The EU will become a net capital importer. This process of importing capital will help expand the international use of the euro as an international means of payment and as a store of value. The synergy between these two roles will further enhance the international significance of the euro. Finally, if the euro does challenge the dollar's hegemony, this is likely to be a cause of instability in the international monetary system, which appropriate policy coordination could mitigate.\n\nInternational Role of the Euro\n\nLike national currencies, international currencies have three major roles. They serve as means of international payment, as units of account, and as stores of value. There is one major difference between national and international currencies. Within national borders, the sole use of one currency is usually imposed by government fiat. Thus, the question of which characteristics make one currency more in demand than another does not usually arise, since normally market participants have little option but to use the currency designated by the government and supplied by an agency such as the national central bank. It is only in exceptional circumstances, such as very rapid inflation, that national currencies are replaced in one or more of their functions by other currencies or commodities.\n\nIn the international economy, demand factors play a much more important role in the determination of which currencies are being used. Since there is no supranational authority that can impose the use of a single currency, these issues are decided in the marketplace, by the behavior of public and private agents of all countries. Because of economies of scale in the use of currencies, the externalities involved, and the considerable degree of uncertainty and asymmetric information, there is no guarantee that the world will end up with the best monetary system, let alone a single international currency. In addition, there is the possibility of multiple equilibria and hence considerable instability, as the expectations and beliefs of agents are among the major factors that will determine which equilibrium will prevail.1\n\nHistory teaches us that many of the institutions and modes of behavior from previous regimes do not change overnight, or do not change at all. There has been considerable continuity in the international monetary system, even after the breakdown of coordination and major changes in regime, following shocks to the fundamentals or the preferences of governments.2 And in a world with many equilibria, history and institutions also play a key role in determining which equilibrium will prevail or in determining the transition path from one equilibrium to another.\n\nEMU can be seen as an important change in the fundamentals of the international monetary system. A subset of countries have decided to coordinate on the use of a single currency. The remainder of this section is concerned with the implications of this decision for the currencies that are used as international means of payment, units of account, and stores of value.\n\nMeans of Payment Function\n\nLet us start with the means of payment function of international currencies. Many seem to think that this function is the most important. For example, according to Cohen (1971, 25–6):\n\nAn international economy with only national moneys is like a barter economy.... Transactions costs are high because of the practical problem of achieving the required double coincidence of wants in the foreign-exchange market. However, as in a barter economy, transactions costs can be substantially diminished for an individual if he adapts his own currency mix to that of other individuals, holding for specific use as international exchange intermediaries inventories of the most widely demanded foreign currencies. These are of course the currencies of the countries that are predominant in world trade—the countries that account for the largest proportion of international transactions (pp. 25–26).\n\nTo assess the potential role of the euro we must look to demand for means of international payment by official bodies and by the private sector.\n\nWe begin with the demand by official bodies. As Krugman (1984) among others suggests, “Probably the most important reason for holding reserves in dollars is that the dollar is an intervention currency” (p. 273). Data on the composition of official international reserves suggest that the share of the U.S. dollar in official reserves, although declining, is overwhelmingly higher than the share of any other single currency.3 In fact it is still higher than the combined share of all the other currencies taken together. From 76.1 percent of total official currency reserves in 1973, the share of the U.S. dollar fell to 63.3 percent in 1994. The share of major European currencies shows a steady increase, and has risen from 14.3 percent in 1973 to 21.9 percent in 1994. The share of the deutsche mark has risen from 7.1 percent in 1973 to 15.5 percent in 1994. The most impressive rise has been that of the Japanese yen, which rose from almost zero in 1973 to 8.5 percent of the total in 1994. Despite significant efforts (e.g., Dooley, Lizondo, and Mathieson, 1989), we do not have a satisfactory empirical account of the determinants of reserve-holding behavior and these observed trends.\n\nThe trend decline in the share of dollar reserves in the portfolios of central banks is likely to be reinforced as a result of the process of EMU. The reduced need for exchange market intervention in dollars by EU central banks that will follow establishment of EMU will entail a significant decline in the use of the dollar as an international means of payment by official bodies (see the evidence in Frenkel and Sondergaard, 1996). But this will not necessarily make the euro a major reserve currency outside the EU, unless foreign exchange intervention by non-EC countries is also in euros. The euro will substitute for the dollar in the portfolios of EU central banks that do not participate in the final stage of EMU, or in the portfolios of non-EU central banks that decide to peg their exchange rate to the euro. These may in due course include, for example, the central banks of the economies of Central and Eastern Europe. On the other hand, there will be a one-off, “arithmetic” reduction in nondollar reserve holdings when European currencies going into the euro that are held by European central banks become converted into euros—and hence are no longer international reserves.\n\nAdditional demand could arise if the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) were to conduct a large part of its borrowing and lending in euros rather than dollars or yen. Such a preference toward the euro on the part of the EBRD would of course cause an even higher increase in the demand for euro reserves by the central banks of the Central and Eastern European economies.4\n\nWe next turn to the means of payment function of international money as it applies to the private sector. Note that whereas international transactions in goods markets are arranged between importers and exporters, eventual payment is intermediated through commercial banks. Thus, what one should look for are the “thickness” externalities that cause dealers to prefer indirect exchange, through a vehicle currency, over direct exchange of one currency for another. These externalities have to do with transactions costs that become lower as the users of currencies increase. Such network externalities are very important in monetary transactions. If there are many dealers prepared to exchange dollars (the dollar market is “thick”), then a dealer wishing to exchange pesetas for drachmas finds it less costly to go through two exchanges, one of pesetas for dollars and one of dollars for drachmas, than to go through a direct exchange of drachmas for pesetas. However, even when this is not the case, a vehicle currency is still often used to finance bilateral trade imbalances (Krugman, 1980).\n\nThe market for euros will be thicker than the market for any of the existing EU currencies. This will make it more likely that the euro will emerge as a medium of exchange more on par with the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The dollar is currently used in 83 percent of two-way transactions in foreign exchange markets, while the deutsche mark is used in only 37 percent; other EMS currencies in 21 percent of transactions; sterling in 10 percent; and the yen in 24 percent (BIS, 1996, and Ilzkovitz, 1996). The euro is bound to occupy a larger share because of thickness externalities. Thus the fundamentals point toward a potentially large shift in favor of the euro. Note that if the world consisted of only the United States and the EU, the establishment of the euro would eliminate all interbank markets for foreign exchange, except for one—that between the dollar and the euro. Thus, the dollar would immediately lose its importance as a vehicle currency and it would be as widely used as the euro.\n\nOf course, the dollar's role is important because it also intermediates in the financing of trade between the EU and third countries, as well as trade of third countries among themselves. One of the reasons is again lower transaction costs in the interbank market. The euro will not necessarily substitute for the dollar in these other markets. But the reduction in transaction costs in all markets involving the euro, vis-è-vis the markets involving the existing EU currencies, will make some substitution likely.\n\nThe EU accounts for a higher percentage of world exports and imports than the United States, even when intra-EU trade is netted out. The average share of the EU in world exports in the 1970s was on the order of 14 percent, as opposed to about 12 percent for the United States and 7 percent for Japan. In the 1980s the EU share rose to about 16 percent and Japan's rose to 9.5 percent, as opposed to a stagnant share for the United States. In 1992, the U.S. share of world exports was 12.3 percent, versus 9.3 percent for Japan and 16.9 percent for the EU when intra-EU trade is netted out.\n\nThese facts point toward a significant potential for the euro as a means of payments in international markets. The dollar will be displaced significantly as an intervention, reserve, and vehicle currency. The trade fundamentals are favorable to the euro. In all this, however, it is worth keeping in mind an important lesson from the models of international money, stressed by Rey (1997). This is that “history will matter: once an exchange structure is established, it will persist unless the structure of payments shifts enough to make it untenable or unless the system experiences a shock large enough to shift it from one equilibrium to another” (Krugman, 1980, p. 523).\n\nEMU will be a large enough shock that it will significantly affect the current position of the dollar and is likely to upset the foreign exchange market. Even the experience with the replacement of the pound sterling by the U.S. dollar in the interwar period may not have involved as large and as abrupt a change in the fundamentals of the international monetary system as EMU is likely to bring (see Brown, 1940, for a classic treatment of this episode).\n\nThe precise nature of the new equilibrium is difficult to predict, however, especially as even the simplest triangular exchange models have multiple equilibria, and beliefs may play an important role in determining which equilibrium prevails. To paraphrase Newlyn (1962, p. 2), international money “falls within that perplexing but fascinating group of phenomena… affected by self-justifying beliefs. If the members of a community think that money will be generally acceptable, then it will be; otherwise not.”\n\nIt is also worth noting that for both the interbank market and the nonbank private sector the euro will not be adopted unless transaction costs are low and banking in it is as cheap as the alternatives. The extent to which this will be the case will also depend on the success of financial deregulation in bringing down the cost of banking in the EU (Giovannini and Mayer, 1991). It will also depend on central bank and regulatory policies determining the costs of using the euro payments mechanism (Folkerts-Landau and Garber, 1992).\n\nUnit of Account Function\n\nWe next turn to the unit of account role of international money. This is closely linked to the means of payments role for national economies, although less so in the international monetary system. The unit of account role for an international currency depends first on whether importers and exporters invoice in that particular currency. Black (1985) presents evidence that whereas European firms invoice a very large proportion of their exports in their own currencies, the proportion of their imports that is invoiced in other currencies, and especially dollars, is quite significant. On the other hand, Japanese firms invoice mainly in dollars, while developing countries invoice overwhelmingly in dollars. In an update, Black (1990) found that the share of Japanese exports invoiced in dollars has been falling over time, while the share denominated in yen has been rising. He also reports some indirect evidence that the share of U.S. trade denominated in foreign currencies is rising. Recently Hartmann (1996) reported that 48 percent of world exports are invoiced in dollars, 15 percent in deutsche mark, 18 percent in other major European currencies, and still only 5 percent in yen. At the same time, the Japanese and European shares of world exports have also been rising, while the share of U.S. exports seems to have been stagnant.5\n\nThe consequence seems to be a trend decline in the share of dollar-denominated world trade. In all probability EMU will result in the almost exclusive invoicing in euros by EU firms. The only likely exceptions are imports from the United States and Japan and some primary commodities, if invoicing by commodity producers were to continue to be in U.S. dollars. It is also quite possible that the economies of scale created by the substitution of a number of European currencies by a single one will induce firms from other areas that trade mainly with the EU to start invoicing in euros. This may include the Central and Eastern European economies and many Middle Eastern Mediterranean economies. It may also induce many multinational Japanese and U.S. firms to follow suit, as they will also benefit from such economies of scale. Again, however, there will be an initial one-off “arithmetic” effect raising the share of dollar-denominated trade, when intra-EU trade becomes “domestic”—but this will not change the trends.\n\nTo the extent that trade relations become concentrated in regional blocks (e.g., Europe-Africa-Middle East, Japan-Southeast Asia, United States-Latin America), we might end up with, at least three vehicle cum unit-of-account currencies. But insofar as trade is multilateral and more uniformly distributed geographically, there will still be powerful forces behind the use of a single dominant currency for these roles. In the latter case the change in the fundamentals will favor the euro, but history (inertia) will favor the dollar. For example, it seems unlikely (although not unthinkable) that the OPEC countries and producers of other internationally traded commodities would switch from dollar to euro invoicing soon after the establishment of EMU. Again, any change will depend on the extent and the speed with which the euro displaces the dollar as a means of payments in international trade. As we suggested above, the fundamentals point toward a large displacement of the dollar as a means of international payments. Displacement of the dollar as an international unit of account is bound to follow at least partially, and possibly at a later stage.\n\nThe second aspect of the unit-of-account role of an international currency is related to whether there are countries that peg their own currency against it. This is also a reflection of the importance of a currency as an international unit of account. Of the 47 countries that either pegged their currency or maintained limited flexibility against a single other currency in March 1994, 25 did so against the U.S. dollar and 14 against the French franc. All these economies are small, however, and even jointly they do not amount to a significant share of the world economy. Although the euro will have a long way to go in order to become a major international unit of account, a number of factors will favor such a development. One is the growing integration of the Central and Eastern European economies with the EU. This makes it far more likely that both their firms and their central banks will use the euro as a unit of account. Bénassy-Quéré (1996) stresses the potential “anchor” role for the euro (which goes beyond pegging strictly defined) at the regional level.6\n\nTraditionally, the means of payment and unit-of-account functions of money go hand in hand. This was the case with sterling during the gold standard, and with the dollar during the Bretton Woods system and beyond. It is very likely that the euro will eventually become the dominant unit of account and means of payment in Europe and its immediate vicinity (like North Africa and the Middle East). But it is more uncertain whether it will replace the dollar elsewhere. Much will depend on whether the dollar displays weakness because of the persistence of global imbalances, on the relative stability (inflation performance) of the two currencies, and on the attitudes of traders in the interbank market.\n\nStore of Value Function\n\nThe final issue related to the fundamentals of whether the euro will become an important international currency has to do with the desire of private investors to hold assets denominated in euros. Some of the factors that affect international investors also affect central banks. However, central banks have an additional transactions motive, as they have to intervene in support of their home currencies.\n\nAs in the case of central bank reserves, U.S. dollar bonds make up a significant proportion of the international bond market. The data suggest a substantial decline of the role of the U.S. dollar since the early 1980s: from 62 percent of the stock of bonds outstanding in 1985 to only 38 percent at end-1996 (of a total stock amounting to $3,200 billion), with a corresponding sharp rise in the share of yen-denominated bonds to 16 percent (BIS, 1997, p. 11). Normally stocks change slowly, so this is a significant movement. The shares in new issues fluctuate substantially from year to year—for example, dollar-denominated bonds accounted for 24 percent of total issues in 1995 and 43 percent in 1996 (some of this reflects the appreciation of the dollar in 1996). Clearly, the fundamentals are related to risk and return, and there are considerable uncertainties both about the fundamentals and about the appropriate model for analyzing international financial investments.\n\nThe “domestic” market in Europe for private bonds is already fairly unified, and with outstanding stocks of $2,948 billion, it is two-thirds of the U.S. market. The segmentation that one observes in this market appears to derive primarily from the existence of separate currencies. According to McCauley and White's paper in this volume, “In the pricing of government debt, prospects for integration in the trading of the bonds of the most creditworthy governments look brighter than is generally acknowledged” (p. 331). Total public sector domestic debt in the EU-15 amounts to $4,618 billion, two-thirds of that in the United States (BIS, 1997, p. 47).\n\nThe initial share of international assets denominated in euros will be much lower than the size of the EMU bloc in world GDP and trade. And as the euro financial markets integrate further, they will become more liquid and deeper, transactions costs will fall, and they will therefore be more attractive to external investors. A private sector portfolio shift to bring the share of euro asset holdings close to parity with the economic size of the EMU bloc might involve increasing euro asset stocks by $700 billion (McCauley and White, pp. 358), that is, 15–20 percent of the total outstanding stock of international assets. We analyze the potential exchange rate consequences of such a shift in the next section.\n\nSupply will of course respond endogenously to the increase in demand—that is, debt issuers will be inclined to increase their offerings denominated in euros. This will tend to moderate the appreciation of the euro. But changing debt issue denominations will, we believe, be a much slower process than the portfolio shifts. To illustrate this point, note that total new dollar issues of international bonds in 1990–95 were $828 billion, that is, slightly under $140 billion annually. If all were in euros, it would take five years to absorb a stock increase in demand of $700 billion. It is also true that European institutional investors are currently very little diversified into foreign assets, except those in the United Kingdom (see Artus, 1996). But they may initially prefer to diversify across countries, in the newly integrated European capital markets, without incurring exchange risks. Meanwhile, U.S. institutional investors—who also show very high home preference currently—are likely to find the new euro financial market attractive as they diversify, especially if euro bond interest rates are less correlated with U.S. bond yields than are current European government bond rates. This is to be expected. The ECB is likely to be a more independent actor in monetary policy, if only because of the size of the monetary area it covers, than were the individual central banks relative to the United States.\n\nA number of developments may work in the euro's favor in the longer term. First, we may witness a diminution of the so-called “safe haven” motive for dollar holdings. If the liberalization of the Central and East European economies proves durable and not a forerunner of political instability, and if the EU is successful in “widening” as well as “deepening,” then Europe may eventually seem a much safer haven than previously. This, together with the liberalization of financial markets in the EU, could increase the attractiveness of euro-denominated assets. The second factor at work may be the anti-inflationary reputation of the Bundesbank, if it can credibly be transferred to the ECB. Conversely, if liberalization in Central and Eastern Europe were to stall and Balkan instability were to deepen and spread (or, a fortiori, if there were serious instability east of Poland), it would be that much more difficult for euro assets to displace dollar assets in international portfolios.\n\nIn the presence of “thickness externalities” on foreign exchange and financial markets, there are interactions between the medium of exchange and the store of value function of currencies (see Algoskoufis, Portes, and Rey, 1997). According to McCauley and White (p. 333), “the euro money market is likely to prove a very liquid market from its inception.” This will increase the potential of the euro to become a vehicle currency and will strengthen its international role.\n\nHowever, the substantial inertia and history dependence that characterizes the international monetary system should not be discounted. After all, many models with multiple equilibria suggest that big shocks to the fundamentals are required to effect a shift from one steady state to another. The introduction of the euro is likely to be a big shock. The resistance of the dollar in its position as an international currency will also be strong, however, and it will slow down the process of the internationalization of the euro.\n\nThe Euro and the Dollar\n\nWe now consider the exchange rate implication of the process through which the creation of the euro would affect international markets for foreign exchange, as well as the dynamic process that is likely to be initiated by the tendency to substitute euros for dollars in international portfolios. Here, it is important to recognize that the analysis abstracts from both cyclical and trend developments. We take current cyclical positions as the baseline and assume that the trends of the past decade or so will continue.\n\nFrom our examination of the demand-side fundamentals in the previous section it appears that the creation of the euro will cause a potentially large substitution of euros for dollars by both central banks and private asset holders. The question that arises is how this higher demand will be translated into a higher supply of euros in international portfolios.\n\nEuro-denominated assets will be supplied even before the year 2002, as banks and financial intermediaries will be allowed to issue liabilities denominated in euros. In the first half of 2002, the stock of financial assets denominated in the existing EU currencies will be denominated in euros. This will of course include assets held by the rest of the world. Since one also expects a substitution of euros for dollar holdings, however, additional euro-denominated assets will need to be created. What will be the implications of this process for the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar?\n\nTo examine this issue we need to look at the interaction between the current and the capital account of the EU. The shift in favor of the euro in international financial markets cannot cause a matching supply of euros immediately, since there would be nobody on the other side to provide the quantities of euro-denominated assets. The result will be a rise in the price of the euro against the dollar, that is, a real euro revaluation.\n\nIf the euro revaluation caused an increase in the current account deficit of the EU, then the EU would be able to start correcting the excess demand for euros through the capital account. By supplying additional euros or disposing of dollar holdings through the capital account, the EU would support the process of establishing the euro as an international currency.\n\nThis process will not start immediately, however, because of the J-curve. The immediate reaction of the current account to a revaluation is sluggish and even perverse. Thus, in the short term we may see a narrowing rather than a widening of the current account of the EU following a revaluation of the euro. This possibility suggests that the euro will have to overshoot its long-run revaluation in the short run, causing expectations of a future devaluation that will cause European real interest rates to rise temporarily. That rise in interest rates raises net domestic private sector savings, as is necessary to accompany a current account improvement.7\n\nOver time, the revaluation of the euro will cause a current account deficit, and an increased inflow of capital into the EU, causing higher euro holdings internationally. European real interest rates will fall, as the euro will weaken toward long-run equilibrium.\n\nThe outcome in steady state is a euro appreciation relative to the initial position vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. How much might we expect? Just for illustration, note that the $700 billion stock shift suggested above would convert about 20 percent of existing dollar assets into euro assets. If the initial levels of the two are about the same, and if the values of the two debt stocks and of interest rates were held constant, the dollar would have to depreciate by 40 percent. Note that in 1996, capital flows into the United States were $395 billion ($123 billion official and $272 billion private), and the dollar appreciated by 30 percent with respect to the deutsche mark.\n\nThis scenario of major change must be evaluated in the light of the likely willingness of the ECB to allow the euro to become an international currency. The ECB may resist the widespread international use of the euro because of the perceived burden of acting as an international lender of last resort.\n\nThere are two recent historical examples: the postwar prohibition on the part of the United Kingdom of the use of sterling balances for third-country credits, which may have been a stimulus to the growth of the Euromarkets; and the reluctance of the Bundesbank to allow the deutsche mark to be used as an intervention currency in the EMS, because this would have brought greater external influences on domestic monetary policy. Nevertheless, even if the ECB were to take a similar attitude, this would merely slow down the emergence of the euro as an international currency, not stop it.\n\nOn the other hand, if the ECB pursues the opposite route, actively promoting the international use of the euro, one cannot discount the possibility of an overt tug of war between the euro, the incumbent (the dollar), and the major other contender (the yen) for international monetary supremacy. Some of the recent language of European political leaders suggests that they look forward to this prospect and that they believe the United States—despite its official pro-EMU position—in fact opposes the single European currency because it regards the euro as a threat, in this sense. We regard such attitudes themselves as a threat and such a prospect as a potentially dangerous development. One might draw this lesson from the interwar experience of the rivalry between sterling and the dollar, with the French franc on the sidelines (Eichengreen, 1987). Even without such a potential rivalry, if EMU were to result in large-scale substitution of euros for dollar balances and a quick appreciation of the euro against the dollar (and the yen), along the lines we have analyzed, this may be a cause for concern. There may well be an increased need for better monetary policy coordination at the international level to cope with such an eventuality.\n\nPolicy Implications\n\nWe now turn to the assessment of the likely implications of EMU for the process of international policy coordination and the determination of the exchange rate regime between the dollar, the euro, and the yen. Let us start by briefly discussing the rationale for international policy coordination and cooperative exchange rate management.\n\nInternational Macroeconomic Policy Coordination\n\nThe main argument in favor of international macroeconomic policy coordination is that, in its absence, macroeconomic policies may result in inefficient global outcomes. Inefficiency is defined here in terms of the well-known Pareto criterion that some countries can be made better off without any country being made worse off. Because the policies of large economies have international “spillovers,” the perceived outcomes of particular policy actions for any one country depend on the actions of other countries. In such cases, as in classical oligopoly, the nationalistic pursuit of economic policy by all countries is unlikely to be optimal. World macroeconomic policy may well end up being too expansionary or too contractionary, because individual countries cannot properly account for international spillovers in a regime without coordination.\n\nA well-known example from flexible exchange rate regimes leads to deflationary bias. Suppose that each country tries to reduce inflation through restrictive policies that operate through a nominal appreciation of its currency. Because the exchange rate cannot appreciate for everyone, the efforts of at least some of them, if not all, will be frustrated. Meanwhile, the attempt to achieve exchange rate appreciations in a noncoordinated fashion leads to an overrestrictive monetary policy for everyone, which in the short run would result in too much unemployment. Everybody could be made better off by a coordinated monetary contraction that would achieve a better balance between the reduction of inflation and the increase in unemployment. This example has often been invoked to explain the worldwide rise in unemployment in the early 1980s.\n\nAn unwarranted increase in inflation could equally well occur if countries are concerned not with inflation, but with domestic unemployment and balance of payments deficits. An attempt to achieve depreciations of the nominal and real exchange rate in a noncoordinated fashion would result in over-expansionary monetary policy, as the exchange rate depreciations cannot occur for everybody. Since the world is a closed economy, world inflation would rise, and the effects on average unemployment and trade imbalances would be minimal. A coordinated monetary expansion could result in a better balance between inflation, unemployment, and trade imbalances. This example has equally often been invoked to explain the worldwide rise in inflation in the aftermath of the first oil shock.\n\nIf coordination is beneficial, why is it not more prevalent? Some coordination in the monetary sphere undoubtedly characterizes fixed exchange rate regimes. In fact, all such regimes have been asymmetric, in the sense that in some form or another one country or central bank has acted as a (Stackelberg) leader. World outcomes are not Pareto-efficient under this type of coordination, but in many circumstances they can be shown to be better than uncoordinated monetary policies (see Canzoneri and Henderson, 1991). Yet coordination of fiscal policies has not occurred, even in fixed exchange rate regimes, and fixed exchange rate regimes often face tremendous pressures and eventually break down. Thus, one is still left with the puzzle of why, despite the presumed benefits of coordination, very little coordination exists.8\n\nTo begin with, continuous coordination, in the sense that countries negotiate and agree on their reactions in each instant, may be extremely costly, because of the negotiation, implementation, and monitoring costs that would be involved. Such costs explain not the lack of coordination, however, but the prevalence of coordination in setting the “rules of the game” over coordination of “how to play” at each instant. It is thus widely agreed that any coordination ought to take the form of agreements on relatively simple rules that would focus on a selected range of intermediate targets, such as exchange rates and nominal income growth, together with some arrangements for crisis management and avoidance of conflicts over shared targets such as bilateral exchange rates or current accounts. The objective of continuous full coordination of all policy actions appears unattainable because of the costs involved. In any case, the potential benefits from full coordination have been estimated to be modest and skewed in favor of the EU and against the United States; moreover, most of the benefits accrue even in moderately cooperative regimes in which there is some joint targeting of intermediate targets such as nominal exchange rates or nominal GDPs.\n\nBut there are several obstacles to agreeing and sustaining the “rules of the game” even in moderately cooperative regimes. One problem is uncertainty about the objectives and priorities of foreign countries, although empirical research based on simulations of macroeconometric models has not shown the benefits from coordination to be particularly sensitive to this source of uncertainty. Another problem lies in disagreements about how the international and national economies function. This has been shown to affect the estimation of benefits from coordination significantly and is a major source of disagreements in international policy discussions. It affects the choice of intermediate targets (e.g., nominal exchange rates versus nominal income or money growth) and the drafting of the rules of how to respond to particular developments. Eichengreen and Ghironi (1997), for example, in an initial effort to model policy coordination between an “EMU bloc” and the United States, find that the incentives to coordinate differ greatly according to how they specify the consequences of fiscal contraction or expansion.\n\nIn conclusion, although in principle the coordination of macroeconomic policies can be shown to lead to better macroeconomic outcomes at the world level, it is realistic to expect that the international monetary system will not change to one of full coordination of policies in the aftermath of EMU. The costs of negotiating, sustaining, and monitoring coordinated policies, the vexed question of the distribution of the benefits, uncertainty about the objectives of foreign authorities, and disagreements about how the macroeconomy functions preclude not only the full coordination of policies, but even coordination in the form of agreeing on simple rules for the cooperative conduct of monetary and fiscal policy. In the few instances when coordination has succeeded it seems to have focused around the management of exchange rates (monetary policy coordination), and it is to this question that we now turn.\n\nEMU and International Exchange Rate Management\n\nThe cooperative management of exchange rates through monetary policies has been the major focus of most attempts at coordination and of much of the analytical literature (e.g., Kenen, 1988, and Miller, Eichengreen, and Portes, 1989) since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. Exchange rate management is no longer seen as anathema, as the experience with floating rates in the 1970s and the first part of the 1980s is not viewed as particularly successful (empirical evidence suggests, for example, that inflation persistence is greater in flexible exchange rate regimes; see Alogoskoufis, 1992). In addition, since the exchange rate is a variable shared by at least two countries, it is a natural focus for coordination.\n\nCoordinated exchange rate management had a high point in the late 1970s: in November 1978 the Group of Three industrial countries intervened heavily to halt the depreciation of the dollar, while in 1979 and early 1980 the United States intervened to halt the dollar's appreciation, by selling dollars and acquiring substantial exchange rate reserves. The Reagan administration then adopted a policy of “benign neglect” toward the dollar, and cooperative exchange rate management (and macroeconomic policy coordination) was avoided until September 1985. The Plaza Agreement then marked the beginning of another period of active exchange rate management that culminated in the Louvre Accord of February 22, 1987, to “foster stability of exchange rates around current levels” (Funabashi, 1988). Since then, the resolve of the Group of Three industrial countries to stabilize exchange rates has been diluted. The consequences of events in Eastern Europe and the run-up to the 1992 U.S. presidential election brought some of the worst failures in the coordination of monetary and exchange rate policies of recent years.\n\nWill European monetary union and the creation of the euro create more pressure for exchange rate management, or will it allow the maintenance of “benign neglect” about exchange rates? Analytical models (e.g., Giavazzi and Giovannini, 1989) suggest that more symmetry may generate instability in the international monetary system. If one economy is much larger and more closed than the others, it will be quite happy to act as a (Stackelberg) leader, using the money supply as its monetary policy instrument, without regard for its nominal exchange rate. We may then have an equilibrium in which the large economy sets its money supply while the small economies intervene to affect their nominal exchange rates. If another major player were to emerge, however, in the absence of full cooperation, the greater symmetry could lead to instability. Both economies will have an incentive to try to use exchange rate policy, as their bilateral exchange rate vis-é-vis the other large country matters more, and in such a case instability will arise. Thus, in the presence of large shocks we may see both economies trying to manipulate their exchange rates, that is, use beggar-thy-neighbor monetary policies, in which case there is a reversion to flexible exchange rates. As Giavazzi and Giovannini (1989) put it, “when the size of the Nth country is much larger than that of the other country (or countries), so that bilateral exchange-rate fluctuations do not significantly affect the Nth country’s output and real income, a regime of managed rates does not display the instability that characterizes the symmetric case” (p. 208). The results suggest that the greater symmetry that EMU will imply for the international monetary system may result in greater difficulty in managing exchange rates internationally.\n\nIt may well be that it is not practical in today’s circumstances to move away from fully flexible exchange rates. This has less to do with asymmetries and more with the technological and communications advances that have speeded up capital mobility and created global financial markets.\n\nWhat scope is there for monetary policy coordination then? If our analysis in the previous sections is broadly accepted, there should be scope for monetary policy interventions that would help avoid the overshooting of the exchange rate of the euro, after the third stage of EMU starts. This could be achieved through either monetary relaxation in Europe, following the start of the third stage, or monetary tightening in the United States. Such actions would slow down the appreciation of the euro vis-à-vis the dollar and could help avoid turbulence in the exchange markets. But such a policy would be a difficult task for the newly established ECB to execute. If it went wrong it would risk its anti-inflationary credibility exactly at the time when there would be need to build it up. On the other hand, the U.S. Federal Reserve would have less to fear in tightening monetary policy to avoid a sharp dollar depreciation.\n\nIn any case, it is difficult to envisage major monetary policy switches in response to the appreciation of the euro after the start of EMU. Such a response would come only if Europe were to face a worsening unemployment problem that would deepen still further following the appreciation of the euro, or if the U.S. economy were expanding too vigorously. In all probability, the appreciation and subsequent depreciation of the euro vis-é-vis the dollar remains the most likely scenario after the start of the final stage of EMU."
