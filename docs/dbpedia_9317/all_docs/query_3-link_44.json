Neither Argentina nor Serbia and Montenegro was able to penetrate the other's territory, and the crowd at Scorpio, an outdoor bar in the seaside Montenegrin town of Kotor, had started to discuss other subjects: real estate, girls, local hip-hop. I was beginning to understand why Americans are not big soccer fans. Then, out of nowhere, the ball skipped into the air and a player flew after it, one Adidas-clad foot extended. Goal!\n\nThe applause echoed off the white stone walls of this medieval town, wedged between a fortress-crowned mountain and a pristine fjordlike bay. For a moment, I was shocked. The dozen Montenegrin guys drinking 1.50-euro Nik beers at Scorpio were cheering not for their home team but for their apparent opponents, Argentina.\n\nActually, it wasn't their home team, they explained: Of the 11 players on the Serbia and Montenegro team, only two were from Montenegro -- and one was on the bench. To ever-louder hoots from the men of Kotor, Argentina ended up winning the game with a humiliating 6-0 lead. The losers that day weren't Montenegrins, but the Serbs.\n\nSo it goes in Montenegro, the latest stop on my high-style, low-budget trip around the globe. This country of 600,000 might have been a mere way station, a pause on my southward leg from Croatia to Albania. But on May 21, its citizens voted for independence from Serbia, thus dissolving the last remnants of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. How could I skip the world's newest nation, especially when -- because of decades of underdevelopment and wartime sanctions -- Montenegro was reputed to be significantly cheaper than its northern neighbor?\n\nFrom Dubrovnik, Croatia, where I spent two brief but happy days, I took a two-hour bus (99 Croatian kuna, or about $17) along the dramatic coastal highway to Perast, a tidy town on the Bay of Kotor, a Unesco-protected fjord. Why Perast? Because it's gorgeous -- the Newport, R.I., of Montenegro. The waterfront is lined with stately Venetian-style palaces and old merchant homes built by wealthy sea captains. The scene is intimate and proud, with a whiff of nostalgia for a once-glorious era when Peter the Great would send his officers to the maritime academy here.\n\nBut most important, Perast had Vladimir Bulatovic.\n\nVladimir -- or Vlatko, as everyone calls him -- is one of only about eight Montenegrins on Couchsurfing.com, a Web site that allows members to offer their sofas, floors and spare bedrooms to like-minded travelers. A restaurateur in his late 30's, Vlatko has the slightly crazed look of a man besieged by errands and chores, but utterly delighted to be juggling them. (And like many younger Montenegrins, he speaks English fluently, or at least enthusiastically.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
