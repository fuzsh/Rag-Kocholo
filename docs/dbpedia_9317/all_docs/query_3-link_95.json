        "text": "6. Montenegro – 5.2 per cent\n\nMontenegro is one of Europe’s youngest nations and only gained its independence in 2006. The country is not yet a member of the European Union, and is therefore not part of the EU’s support mechanism for the reception of refugees. Nevertheless, Montenegro has received more refugees in relation to its population than any other European country in recent years.\n\nWhen the war in Ukraine broke out, several million Ukrainians fled to European countries. Many settled in the countries bordering Ukraine. But Montenegro, a small country which is geographically remote from Ukraine, still received more refugees in relation to its population than any of Ukraine’s neighbours.\n\nThe UN refugee agency has praised the authorities and people of Montenegro for the hospitality they have shown Ukrainian refugees. This positive attitude is one of the reasons why so many refugees have applied to Montenegro. There are close ties between these two Slavic peoples, who are also linguistically related. Paradoxically, relatively few Ukrainian refugees have received protection in Montenegro’s neighbouring country Serbia.\n\n7. Colombia – 4.8 per cent\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, some 2.5 million Venezuelans fled to neighbouring Colombia. Only a minority have received formal refugee status, but the UN refugee agency emphasises that displaced Venezuelans need protection and supports the authorities in Colombia, which have granted Venezuelans a 10-year temporary residence permit.\n\nThe humanitarian conditions for refugees in Colombia are still difficult, in a country that itself has more than five million internally displaced people. Colombia has experienced prolonged conflict, despite the peace initiatives of recent years. The level of violence within the country is high and this also affects vulnerable people on the move.\n\n8. Türkiye – 4.6 per cent\n\nTürkiye has received more refugees than any other country since 2013 – as many as 4 million. Türkiye is a large and populous country and is better equipped to handle the challenge than, for example, Lebanon. Nevertheless, it is challenging to provide protection to such a large number of people within a short space of time.\n\nTürkiye signed an agreement with the EU in 2016 that prevents refugees from moving on to Europe. This has had serious consequences for both the refugees who have made it to Greece and those who remain in Türkiye.\n\n9. Czech Republic – 4.2 per cent\n\nUntil war broke out in Ukraine, there had been very few refugees in the Czech Republic. Indeed, the country had been one of the most reluctant in Europe to accept refugees from the Middle East and Africa. The opposition to accepting Muslim refugees was particularly strong.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with the hospitality that has since been shown to refugees from Ukraine. Unlike Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, the Czech Republic does not share a border with Ukraine. Nevertheless, it has accepted more refugees per capita than any of these countries. Only Montenegro has received more, relative to its population.\n\nAt the same time, opposition to Muslim refugees coming to the Czech Republic is intensifying. In 2022, border controls were introduced to prevent Syrian refugees from entering from Slovakia. Together with Hungary and Poland, the Czech Republic has refused to participate in the EU’s scheme for the relocation of refugees from Greece and Italy. The European Commission is now threatening the three countries with punitive measures if they do not change their position.\n\n10. Uganda – 3.9 per cent\n\nUganda has received almost 1.9 million refugees over the last ten years and is one of the largest recipients of refugees in the world. In recent years, Uganda has provided protection to many refugees from DR Congo and South Sudan, as well as people from Burundi, Somalia, Rwanda and several other countries. Uganda is a pioneer in integrating refugees and giving them full rights.\n\nOther major recipient countries\n\nIn addition to the ten countries that have received the most refugees relative to their population, there are certain populous countries that have received a large number of refugees in the last 10 years.\n\nThe most significant of these are:\n\nGermany – 2,517,000 refugees (3% of the total population)\n\nRussia – 1,764,000 (1.2%)\n\nIran – 1,690,000 (1.9%)\n\nSudan – 1,285,000 (2.7%)\n\nPoland – 972,000 (2.4%)\n\nPeru – 955,000 (2.8%)\n\nSee also: A few countries take responsibility for most of the world’s refugees\n\nNote: The figures in the article include all those who have been granted individual protection or temporary collective protection, as well as groups defined by the UN refugee agency as being in a refugee-like situation without having been granted formal refugee status. Asylum seekers who are waiting to have their asylum application processed are not included. If asylum seekers had been included, Cyprus would have been among the top ten receiving countries, and Peru would have been even higher on the list.\n\nThis article was first published in November 2020. It was updated on 29 June 2023 to include the 2022 figures."
