Here’s a little Morricone that would fit well on an acid jazz compilation. “18 Pari” is a groovy instrumental number from the soundtrack Un Uomo Da Rispettare (The Master Touch) directed by Michele Lupo and featuring Kirk Douglas as a professional thief just released from prison who decides to take on one last heist. Wait a minute? Didn’t we feature a Morricone-scored heist movie just a few weeks back with a funky number? Well, this one is especially smooth.

Every Monday, we celebrate a joyous composition by Maestro Morricone! This song can be found on the compilation album More Mondo Morricone. It is also on the soundtrack to Un Uomo Da Rispettare.
