        "text": "MICHELE LUPO\n\nMichele Lupo (Corleone, December 4, 1932) is an Italian film director.\n\nFrom the fifties to the early sixties he began his career as assistant director, until the film debut of \"Maciste, the world's strongest gladiator\" (1962), of which he signed two sequels. After directing some mythological films, he moved to the direction of detective and westerns as \"Master shot in the service of his British Majesty\" and \"Friend, stay away at least a hand ...\". At the end of the eighties he has signed together with Bud Spencer and Elio Scardamaglia a sci-fi comic movie like \"An extra-terrestrial sheriff ... not too much and very terrestrial\" and the sequel to \"I wonder why ... they all happen to me\", the sportsmen \"They called him Bulldozer\" and \"Bomber\" and the western \"Occhio alla penna\". The Sicilian director was also one step away from signing the direction of the film \"My name is Nobody\" but after a fight with Sergio Leone (producer of the film) due to a diatribe on the screenplay was practically hunted by the Roman director, to his at the suggestion of Ernesto Gastaldi, he was called Tonino Valerii."
