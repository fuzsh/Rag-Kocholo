        "text": "Press Release from Beat:\n\nBeat Record and Digitmovies are pleased to release for the absolute first time on CD the complete edition of the brilliant soundtrack by Guido & Maurizio De Angelis for the sci-fi comedy “Chissà perché…capitano tutte a me” (aka Everything Happens to Me) directed in 1980 by Michele Lupo and a cast starring Bud Spencer, Cary Guffey,Ferruccio Amendola, John Bartha, Giancarlo Bastianoni, Paolo Figlia, Lorenzo Fineschi, Giovanni Gianfriglia,Robert Hundar, Clayton Landey, Amedeo Leorini, Ottaviano Dell'Acqua, and Carlo Reali. For the sequel to “Uno sceriffo extraterrestre... poco extra e molto terrestre” where Sheriff Scott Hall fights crime and alien androids to protect the extraterrestrial child H7-25 with the final victory of the good guys, Guido & Maurizio De Angelis composed a really nice soundtrack.\n\nAt the time, a 45 rpm single (Polydor 2040289) was released in Germany featuring the tracks “Mr. Nothingoesright,” a vocal version, and the instrumental “Blue Space.” For this CD of ours, with a generous duration of 75:03, we used the recording session master tapes provided by Cabum. The main theme, “Mr. Nothingoesright” is the funny country tune that we hear in the version performed by the famous Douglas Meakin and reprised in both slow and fast instrumental versions. The legendary De Angelis brothers wrote dramatic and action music with a recurring electronic rock piece that serves as the background to Sheriff Scott's skirmishes with criminals which is also reprised in an extended version entitled “Blue Space”.The Oliver Onions songs “Six Ways” , “What 'll I do”, “Dreaming woman” also appear in some scenes throughout the film. There is no shortage of pleasant South American pieces as well as an epic Western theme for a large orchestra. For the sake of completeness, we have also included \"L’ultimo valzer\" from “Uno sceriffo extraterrestre...” (re-used in this sequel), the electronic effects of the device used by the child , the music for the alien androids (in stereo), and “Silent Night” for child's voice and choir used in the pre-titles. To the delight of fans of the De Angelis brothers, we have included the stereo versions of the original German single and the stereo backing track of “Mr. Nothingoesright”.\n\n1.
