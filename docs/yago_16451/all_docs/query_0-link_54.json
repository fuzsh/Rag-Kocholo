Wait a minute? Didn’t we feature a Morricone-scored heist movie just a few weeks back with a funky number? Well, this one is especially smooth.\n\nEvery Monday, we celebrate a joyous composition by Maestro Morricone! This song can be found on the compilation album More Mondo Morricone. It is also on the soundtrack to Un Uomo Da Rispettare.\n\n.\n\n."
