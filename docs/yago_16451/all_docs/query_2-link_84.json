        "text": "Whether you love Logan or hate him, the actor has a point.\n\nFans of Gilmore Girls are still debating which of Rory Gilmore's suitors is right for her. And while the reboot once more had fans choosing between Logan Huntzberger, Dean Forester, and Jess Mariano, the cast is now weighing in on the boys, too. Matt Czuchry, who played Logan on the beloved series and now stars in The Resident, recently responded to a TikTok video that called his character inconsistent and \"below average.\" He defended his character and pointed out a few facts that fans may not be happy to hear, but are undeniably valid.\n\n\"We shouldn't be searching for perfection in anything,\" Czuchry said during an Apr. 1 appearance on The Talk. \"Whether it be relationships or whatever it may be.\"\n\nCzuchry went on to point out that on the show, all of Rory's love interests had their \"strengths and weaknesses,\" including fan favorite Jess, played by Milo Ventimiglia. So, even if viewers lean towards one specifically (team Jess for life), there's no denying that just like in the real world, the Stars Hollow men aren't perfect.\n\n\"I think that Logan had his strengths and weaknesses and Jess had his strengths and weaknesses and Dean had his strengths and weaknesses, like we all do,\" he said. \"And I think that the fun of the show is that you've got these characters who are flawed and had these great pieces.\"\n\nRelated: The Creator of 'Gilmore Girls' Says New Episodes Are Never \"Off the Table\"\n\nLogan and Rory reconnected in Netflix's 2016 reboot of the show, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. During the limited series's last episode, Rory found herself pregnant and many fans believe that the father is Logan. That fan theory was confirmed in 2023 by the show's costume designer.\n\n\"They told me who the father of the baby was,\" Czuchry told Us Weekly in 2021. \"And they said, ‘Yeah, you can tell whoever you want.' And I never have.\"\n\nDuring his appearance on The Talk, Czuchry also spoke about the show's enduring success, saying that the characters' relatability make the series something anyone can watch any time and still feel a connection. \"That show has spanned generations because of the timeless nature of it,\" he added. \"Amy Sherman Palladino and Dan Palladino, that created it, are amazing artists.\"\n\nFor more InStyle news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
