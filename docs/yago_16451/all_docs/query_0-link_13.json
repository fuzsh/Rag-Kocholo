        "text": "Kirk Douglas plays Steve Wallace, a man who has just gotten out of jail, a man about to make one final play, and above all else, A Man To Respect!\n\nSteve is a master thief who decides to take a job offered to him by an organization that recognizes his particular talents. The first job he ever\n\ntook from them landed him in jail but now he knows what’s out there and it’s time to take it!\n\nThis great flick features a fantastic score by Ennio Morricone and is filled with enough action, emotion, and twists to satisfy any eurocrime action enthusiast! There is an amazing car chase that has to be seen to be believed.\n\nPreviously, A Man to Respect has only been available fullscreen and in some countries has been cut by nearly 15 minutes! This is the uncut widescreen print that is the way this crime action caper was meant to be seen."
