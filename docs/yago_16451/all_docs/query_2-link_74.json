        "text": "TV revivals have always been pretty polarizing, but there’s one thing every fan can agree on: If you’re going to bring a show back to life, you’d better do it with as many of the original actors as possible!\n\nUnfortunately, as we’ve seen far too many times, that is easier said than done.\n\nFrom behind-the-scenes disputes to professional retirements, there are plenty of reasons why a performer might choose not to reprise a role years (or even decades) later. To that end, TVLine is taking stock of many times a series vet was MIA in its revival. (We’re also updating this round-up by subtracting, now that Sex and the City vet Kim Cattrall has literally phoned in a visit to And Just Like That….)\n\nAs always, this list comes with a big ol’ SPOILER ALERT. We’re going to be looking back at a pretty eclectic mix of revivals, from Girl Meets World to Criminal Minds, so you’d better be all caught up. Or just not care. Either one works for us!\n\nTwo notes: For this list, we did not include actors who died prior to their show’s revival (because that would be messed up), nor did we include reunion movies."
