        "text": "Too sad for Lupo did some cool westerns. I haven’t seen Ben+Charlie yet, but I like the other three.\n\nArizona COlt for me is one the best Gemmas. It’s a real actioner with much shoting and even more dying.\n\nBuddy is OK. It’s not as good as the two original trinities, but way better than the flood of badly made SW comedies. I like Buddy, cause it’s well made and it shows Lupo’s love for the genre.\n\nCalifornia is my favourite Gemma and it also is in my top20. It is by far the best of the late SWs.\n\nThen what do you think of the rest of the twilights? I really love Keoma and Mannaja and Four of the Apocalypse is very good. Even if I don’t “immediately” enjoy it. By immediatley I mean that I don’t think too much of it right away. I have to…take a few steps back to appreciate it and then it becomes very god.\n\nI just had a thought. It seems Lupo did films in almost all of the major spaghetti genres. Strait forward actioner, comedy, and twilight.\n\nI’m not a big fan of Keoma. It’s OK but for ma not as godd as everyone says.\n\nMannaja - I’ve only seen it once - but I thought it was awful. It looks really cheap and the part with him in the cave it too trashy, but not trashy enough to be entertaining.\n\nI somehow like “the four” because it’s something completely different.\n\nAll of Lupo’s westerns look quite good, have a good looking production design, but none of them impressed me very much. 3 of them belong in the so, so category.\n\nBuddy Goes West is a bit weaker, directing is not bad, Morricone’s score is quite good, but it’s intended to be a comedy, a pure comedy, nothing else, and it’s not funny. 3,5 /10\n\nCalifornia is too flat about it themes. 4/10\n\nBen and Charlie is an entertaining flic, yet no match for the Clucher comedies. 5/10\n\nAnd Arizona Colt, entertaining as it is, suffers from often being a bit simple and from some lousy action scenes. 5/10\n\n(6/10 is hereby still the mark which divides the good from the ok ones. Obviously I haven’t changed my rating system like promised. It’s somehow impossible for me to give a 6/10 to a film which is only short above average. )"
