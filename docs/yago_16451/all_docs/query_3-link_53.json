        "text": "Caribou, ME. and Saint John's, FL. - Michèle A. Lupo, 68, passed away unexpectedly on Monday, August 24, 2020. She was born on February 26, 1952, the daughter of Christiane (Splingaerd) Nadeau.\n\nMichèle's greatest love was her three children, Michael, Peter, and Catherine and her eight grandchildren, Alexandra, Emma, Olivia, Sophia, Evan, Caitlyn, Lilly, and Saylor. She raised her children in Caribou and was either seen at a ballfield cheering them on or working at Lupo's Men's Wear. While living in Caribou she dedicated many hours to volunteering at the Cary Medical Center and teaching CCD classes at the Holy Rosary. Each summer at the end of Little League season, Michèle and her children would make the nine-hour trip to Newport, RI to visit with her mother and family and soak up the warmth for days at the beach; this was always one of her best memories. Michèle's most favorite time of the year was Christmastime when she would bake, decorate, trim her tree, and pick out the perfect treasures for her family; truly was the best time of year for her family, too.\n\nAfter leaving Caribou, Michèle headed south with her husband Robert (Bob) Lupo where they began a new chapter by building a home in Florida. She was most content tending to her beautiful flower gardens and decorating her home, and she greatly cherished her trips back north to Maine and New Hampshire with Bob, antiquing up and down the Maine Coast and spending time with their children and grandchildren (and of course cheering them on at their ballfields and rinks all over NH and ME). Michèle also traveled to Newport, RI to visit and celebrate with her brothers and sisters as often as she could; Newport held a dear place in her heart where she made wonderful memories with her family.\n\nMichèle had a passion for decorating and designing homes; she spent an unimaginable number of hours with clients helping them to make their house a home, always finding just the right thing to compliment a room. She was a highly sought-after design consultant who helped others to start businesses in clothing and home design, which she would manage. Clients adored her and followed her when it was time to take on a new adventure. Most recently Michèle was a Design Consultant for Pottery Barn. She was extremely successful with her special gift and knack for decorating, so much that she was recognized for selling over one million dollars in merchandise, which is a very unusual award to receive once and she achieved this two years in a row. Michèle made wonderful friends through her many years at Pottery Barn and made everyone feel very special; she took such pride in her work which brought her much joy and happiness.\n\nMichèle is survived by her children, Michael Ouellette and his wife Julie along with their children Emma, Olivia, and Lilly of Cape Elizabeth, ME, Peter Ouellette and his children Alexandra and Sophia and his girlfriend Jeanine Salica and her daughter Saylor of Scarborough, ME, and Catherine Plourde and her husband Rob along with their children Evan and Caitlyn of Durham, NH. She is also survived by an aunt, Renee Roth, eight brothers and sisters, Hélène, Charles, Philippe, Jacqueline, Monique, Paul, Anne, and Denise, along with several nieces and nephews, a step-granddaughter Emily Peterson Griffin and her son Everett, a special sister and brother-in-law Cindy and Danny Ouellette, dearest friends Dr. Alroy and Valerie Chow, Roberta Pagano, Michael Thurston, Ty, and Charmen Quinn, and many other loved ones in Maine and Florida including Debbie Aldrich, David and Jane DuBois, Lute and Linda Disy, Al and Karen Lebrecht, and Rick and Wendy Roark.\n\nIn addition to her mother, Michèle was predeceased by her husband, Robert Lupo.\n\nDue to the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions, a private family celebration of life will be held at a later date.\n\nMemories and condolences may be shared at\n\nlancastermorgan.com"
