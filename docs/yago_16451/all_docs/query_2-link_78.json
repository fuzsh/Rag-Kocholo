        "text": "The Mainers head abroad in the special series \"Maine Cabin Masters: Building Italy,\" premiering on Magnolia Network June 17\n\nThe Cabin Masters are saying so long to Maine!\n\nIn a PEOPLE exclusive first look at the new series, Maine Cabin Master: Building Italy (above), contractor Chase Morrill shares the happy news with his costars that he purchased a house in a remote Italian village for himself, his wife Sarah, and their four teenagers.\n\nThe catch: his crew has to help him overhaul what is essentially a ruin. Luckily, the show's handy stars — including Chase's decorator sister Ashley Morrill, her husband Ryan Eldridge, and their childhood friends Matt \"Dixie\" Dix and Jared \"Jedi\" Baker — have gained plenty of experience transforming problem properties over 10 seasons.\n\nRelated: The Maine Cabin Masters Reveal How Chip & Joanna Gaines' Kids Helped Save Their Show\n\nBuilding Italy sees them tackle new challenges — like finding tools without speaking the local language and dealing with unfamiliar materials — all with the same grit and humor that their fans have come to love.\n\nThey also squeeze in some time to explore all the country has to offer with the Morrill kids, who have grown up appearing on the original series.\n\nNot unlike the stars' own hometown in central Maine, many small villages in Italy have suffered from declining populations as young people leave to find greater opportunities in urban areas. Some have even made headlines in recent years for selling unoccupied homes to foreign buyers for as little as $1 in the hopes of garnering more interest and investment in these areas.\n\nWhile the Morrills have not shared how they plan to use their new home, they have made an impact worth emulating in Maine.\n\nRelated: The Stars of ‘Maine Cabin Masters’ Are Using Their TV Fame to Help Lift Up Their Hometown (Exclusive)\n\nTheir series' popularity has had a positive effect on he stars' small town of Manchester (about an hour north of Portland) which has become a popular tourist destination, not unlike the Gaineses' Magnolia Market at the Silos in Waco, Texas, though on a smaller scale for now.\n\nRyan told PEOPLE in a 2022 interview, \"There's restaurants popping up. It really is changing a lot and I'm proud to say we have had something to do with it.\"\n\nMaine Cabin Masters originally aired on the DIY Network before being saved by Chip and Joanna Gaines for their new Magnolia Network when it replaced the channel in 2022.\n\nMaine Cabin Masters: Building Italy premieres on Monday, June 17 at 9/8c on Magnolia Network with a new episode every Monday.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
