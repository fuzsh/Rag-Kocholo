        "text": "With increasing design complexity, the need for a detailed understanding of design intricacies becomes pivotal, leading to large simulation models. The Finite Element Analysis system must allow users to run large problems efficiently using available computer resources. Abaqus takes advantage of the high-performance features of modern computers, so the model size limitations rarely prevent you from realizing an adequate simulation.\n\nUsers appreciate being able to meet schedules because the code runs large, complex jobs through to completion. Realistic models quickly expose how meticulously the code designers handled the details. Abaqus holds up under the rigors of real-life, large model requirements.\n\nAnalysts must consider nonlinear responses as an essential part of a simulation. Lightweight structures buckle; in accident scenarios, they could collapse. Some important modern materials — like rubbers and plastics — are too soft to simulate based on linearized deformation. Often, the designer wants to take full advantage of the ductility and toughness of the materials available.\n\nMany design problems involve contact. It could range from Hertz contact in bearing design to general sliding contact between a part and the die/mold used to form it. Or between two parts, each undergoing substantial deformation. Abaqus can address these types of complex problems. It has led to its worldwide reputation as the tool of choice for simulations where nonlinearity dominates the response.\n\nAbaqus is popular as an advanced analysis code specializing in production analysis. It has a comprehensive suite of capabilities that are straightforward to learn. It is modular and has simple, consistent and intuitive problem definition rules that relieve you of artificial and frustrating limitations. Users can model geometry as closely as needed, define material behaviors associated with various components of the model and simulate a sequence of events of concern.\n\nAbaqus is designed to ease complex tasks. One of the best examples is automatic time stepping in nonlinear static, dynamic and heat transfer problems: Abaqus chooses and continuously adjusts the time increments automatically. This feature alone has permitted many users to perform simulations that would have been impossible otherwise. Users can tackle realistic simulations with the confidence of success and assurance of meeting the design schedules.\n\nResearch organizations use Abaqus extensively because of its versatility and user-defined extensibility. Its great success arises from its acceptance in the design analysis community as a general analysis tool that provides convenience in routine simulations and greatly extends the range of possible simulations.\n\nAbaqus has a proven record of success in the largest and most complex problems, which distinguishes it. Abaqus is a pleasure to work with for relatively straightforward applications. For complex problems, Abaqus shines as the most trusted tool that provides reliable answers."
