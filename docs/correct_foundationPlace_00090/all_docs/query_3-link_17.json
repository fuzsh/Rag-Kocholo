Faculty and students, supported by all CEC constituents, working together to advance the idea of improving the general well-being of individuals and societies through integrating social and technical aspects into our pedagogical, design and scholarly endeavors as a practice and field of inquiry. We intended to accelerate the social benefits of technological innovation, by ensuring our graduates understand user/community needs and incorporate this into their future designs.\n\nLyndsey McMillon-Brown '13\n\nResearch Engineer, NASA\n\nMcMillon-Brown graduated from Miami in 2013 with a bachelor's in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering. Now, she is a Research Engineer at NASA Glenn Research Center. Here, her work is focused on making solar cells more efficient, affordable, and durable for space applications. She is currently leading a team of six researchers in a $2.5 million effort to develop a new class of solar cells that can be manufactured in space and on the moon."
