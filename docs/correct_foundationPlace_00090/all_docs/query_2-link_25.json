        "text": "Dassault Systèmes SIMULIA and our partners offer regularly scheduled public training courses as well as private training courses at customer sites. Course levels range from introductory for beginning users through advanced for application- and industry-specific topics. The same courses, and more, are available as eLearning for on-demand training.\n\nVisit the links below to find a filtered schedule of DS and partner classes, by location or language\n\nThis Cancellation Policy only applies to Dassault Systèmes led classes and does not apply to any other seminars or training classes, including but not limited to any seminars or classes led by a Dassault Systèmes partner. Partner-led seminars and training classes are subject to change and these changes may not be reflected in the public training schedule. Please refer to each partner’s website for their up-to-date training schedule and related policies.\n\nSIMULIA and its representatives or Dassault Systèmes affiliates, those companies who are owned or controlled by Dassault Systèmes, reserve the right to cancel Dassault Systèmes led classes and seminars up to two weeks prior to the scheduled seminar or class and/or limit class size based upon demand. In such cases refunds of prepaid seminar or training fees will be made in full. Both payments and refunds are processed in the base currency for the seminar or training with no adjustments for fluctuations in currency exchange rates that may occur. While we and our Dassault Systèmes affiliates or representatives reserve the right to cancel seminars or training, or limit enrollment, every effort will be made to fulfill all scheduled training. We may be able to refund payments if a participant cancels but these will be made at our sole discretion.\n\nTo help prevent class or seminar cancellation, please be sure to register at your earliest convenience. Classes and seminars will be confirmed no later than two weeks before the scheduled start date. Classes and seminars without enrollments may be removed from the website or canceled.\n\nClasses and seminars in the U.S. are offered by Dassault Systèmes Americas Corp. and its affiliates or representatives. In the U.S., registrations received less than five working days before a seminar or class are subject to a surcharge of 10%. If a participant cancels a seminar or class reservation more than five working days before the seminar, 80% of the fee will be refunded. No refund will be given for cancellations made less than five working days before a seminar. Please contact your local office for policy information on seminars hosted outside of the U.S."
