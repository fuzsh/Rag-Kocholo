        "text": "Dassault Systèmes today announced the official opening of a new, high tech office in Cork, doubling its office space in an ongoing commitment to innovation and growth in the region\n\nCork – March 21st 2019 - Dassault Systèmes opened their new office in Phoenix House, Monahan Road, Cork today. The French Ambassador H.E. Stéphane Crouzat presided over the opening ceremony with Simon Coveney, Tánaiste & Minister for Foreign Affairs & Trade, and Cllr. Mick Finn, Lord Mayor of Cork City Council, with many members of the French and Irish business communities in attendance.\n\nDassault Systèmes, which is headquartered in Paris and employs over 17,000 staff worldwide,\n\nare showing their long-term commitment to Cork with their office expansion. This new state of the art office in Phoenix House has doubled the capacity of the previous office in an area of the docklands which is going through considerable growth.\n\nThe Dassault Systèmes team in Cork has a historic expertise in the Life Science industry but more recently has evolved into other industries such as aerospace, automotive and high tech.\n\nKevin O’Leary , Country Manager Dassault Systèmes Ireland, said “We have an outstanding team in Cork delivering innovation and growth across our global client base. With this new investment we now have the foundation from which to accelerate our cross-industry expansion.”\n\nDonal Travers, Head of Enterprise Technology Group at IDA Ireland said “As a source of foreign direct investment, Europe continues to be a hugely important market for Ireland. Companies are attracted to Ireland due to the talented multi-lingual and tech savvy workforce here. I wish Dassault Systèmes continued success with this move to their new office in Cork.”\n\nThe office opening showcased a number of interactive demos including The Living Heart Project and the 3DEXPERIENCE City Project.\n\nThe Living Heart Project\n\nThis experience provided attendees with the opportunity to explore and interact with the Living Heart Human Model in 3D.\n\nCoupled with a virtual-holographic platform, this experience provided a glimpse into the future of medicine where cardiovascular experts can explore treatment options, educate their patients, or study the efficacy of new medical devices and predict reliability under real-world conditions.\n\n3DEXPERIENCE City Project\n\nThe 3DEXPERIENCE City Project demo of Singapore and the French city of Rennes, which has been twinned with Cork since 1982, demonstrated the best way to address the challenges of urbanization which is to put people at the heart of the renewal process. As cities look to enable officials, citizens and business people to work together. Dassault Systèmes’ visionary 3DEXPERIENCE City is a 3D collaborative environment where data from sensors and city systems is federated into a virtual referential that benefits everyone."
