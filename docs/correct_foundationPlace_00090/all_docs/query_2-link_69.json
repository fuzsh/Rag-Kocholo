This way was used by Reul, 2000 as he described below:\n\n\"For the modelling of the contact zone between soil and\n\nraft, and between soil and the large-diameter bored piles,\n\nthin solid continuum elements have been applied instead of\n\nspecial interface elements. The contact between structure\n\nand soil was described as perfectly rough. This means that\n\nno relative motion takes place between the nodes of the\n\nfinite elements that represent the structure and those of the\n\nfinite elements that represent the uppermost layer of soil.\n\nThe material behaviour in the contact area was simulated by\n\nthe material behaviour of the soil.\"\n\nHope this help\n\nZiyad\n\n____________ _________ _________ __\n\nFrom: saeed <s.salehimalek@ yahoo.com>\n\nTo: ***@yahoogroups. com\n\nSent: Wed, February 24, 2010 11:21:11 AM\n\nSubject: [Abaqus] interaction between pile and soil\n\ni want to model a piled raft foundation.how must i model interaction between soil and pile?\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]"
