The Remote Point is affected with the added mass through a MASS21 element, and is attached to the scoped geometry through Constraint Equations. When a Distributed Mass is inserted in the model, SURF154 surface elements are added on top of the scoped geometry. These surface elements are affected with the distributed mass through Real Constant n°6 defining an added mass per unit area."
