        "text": "The Abaqus finite element system includes:\n\nAbaqus/Standard, a general-purpose finite element program;\n\nAbaqus/Explicit, an explicit dynamics finite element program;\n\nAbaqus/CAE, an interactive environment used to create finite element models, submit Abaqus analyses, monitor and diagnose jobs, and evaluate results; and\n\nAbaqus/Viewer, a subset of Abaqus/CAE that contains only the postprocessing capabilities of the Visualization module.\n\nSeveral add-on options are available to further extend the capabilities of Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit. The Abaqus/Aqua option works with Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit. The Abaqus/Design and Abaqus/AMS options work with Abaqus/Standard. Abaqus/Aqua contains optional features that are specifically designed for the analysis of beam-like structures installed underwater and subject to loading by water currents and wave action. The Abaqus/Design option enables you to perform design sensitivity analysis (DSA). Abaqus/AMS is an optional eigensolver that works within Abaqus/Standard providing very fast solution of large symmetric eigenvalue problems. The Abaqus co-simulation technique provides several applications, available as separate add-on capabilities, for coupling between Abaqus and third-party analysis programs. Abaqus/Foundation is an optional subset of Abaqus/Standard that provides more cost-efficient access to the linear static and dynamic analysis functionality in Abaqus/Standard. These options are available only if your license includes them.\n\nThe Abaqus guides provide a reference to using Abaqus/Standard (including Abaqus/Aqua, Abaqus/Design, and Abaqus/Foundation) and Abaqus/Explicit (including Abaqus/Aqua). Abaqus/Standard solves a system of equations implicitly at each solution “increment.” In contrast, Abaqus/Explicit marches a solution forward through time in small time increments without solving a coupled system of equations at each increment (or even forming a global stiffness matrix).\n\nThroughout the guides the term Abaqus is most commonly used to refer to both Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit; the individual product names are used to indicate when information applies to only that product. Product identifiers appear at the beginning of sections in many guides indicating the products to which the information in the section applies.\n\nMany analyses that demonstrate the numerous capabilities of Abaqus are discussed in the Abaqus Example Problems Guide, the Abaqus Benchmarks Guide, and the Abaqus Verification Guide. These examples can help you become familiar with the functionality that Abaqus provides and the structure of the Abaqus input file. For example, Beam impact on cylinder discusses the various modeling techniques that can be used to analyze the dynamic response of a cantilever beam.\n\nInformation on requesting output from an Abaqus simulation is discussed in About Output. Requested results from an Abaqus simulation are viewed through the Visualization module in Abaqus/CAE (also licensed separately as Abaqus/Viewer). The output database file is read by the Visualization module in Abaqus/CAE to create contour plots, animations, X–Y plots, and tabular output of Abaqus results. See Viewing results for detailed information on using the Visualization module in Abaqus/CAE."
