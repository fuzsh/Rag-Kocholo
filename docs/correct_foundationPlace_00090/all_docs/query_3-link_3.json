        "text": "VELIZY-VILLACOUBLAY, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:\n\nDassault Systèmes (Paris:DSY) (Euronext Paris: #13065, DSY.PA), the 3DEXPERIENCE Company, world leader in 3D design software, 3D Digital Mock Up and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions, today announced a cooperation with the National Research Foundation (NRF), Prime Minister’s Office, Singapore, to develop Virtual Singapore, a realistic and integrated three-dimensional (3D) model with semantics and attributes in the virtual space. Advanced information and modelling technology will allow Virtual Singapore to be infused with static and dynamic city data and information.\n\nVirtual Singapore is a collaborative platform with a rich data environment and visualization techniques that will be used by Singapore’s citizens, businesses, government and research community to develop tools and services that address the emerging and complex challenges Singapore faces. This project will build upon Dassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCity to create a dynamic, 3D digital model of Singapore and connect all stakeholders in a secured and controlled environment. The model will employ data analytics and simulate modeling capabilities for testing concepts and services, planning, decision-making, researching technologies and generating community collaboration.\n\nWith images and data collected from various public agencies, including geometric, geospatial and topology, as well as legacy and real-time data such as demographics, movement or climate, Virtual Singapore users will be able to create rich visual models and realistic large-scale simulations of Singapore. Users can digitally explore the impact of urbanization on the city-state and develop solutions that optimize logistics, governance and operations related to environmental and disaster management, infrastructure, homeland security or community services.\n\n“Singapore is the most advanced city in the world in terms of leveraging technology to plan and manage its transformation over the next decades, and its government’s forward-thinking vision towards a Smart Nation parallels our own mission to harmonize product, nature and life through 3D universes,” said Bernard Charlès, President & CEO, Dassault Systèmes. “Cities are some of the most complex ‘products’ created by humanity. Through more efficient and accurate predictions of future experiences within these cities using state-of-the-art tools and applications, we can better anticipate national resource planning or provision of services, and contribute towards a more sustainable quality of life. We hope to see other cities echo Singapore’s exciting initiative.”\n\nDassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCity, powered by the 3DEXPERIENCE platform, provides a scalable, single unified hub to represent, extend and improve the real world and manage data, processes and people of sustainable cities. 3DEXPERIENCity addresses architecture, infrastructure, planning, resources and inhabitants through virtualization, simulation and collaboration capabilities.\n\nResearch, innovation and enterprise are central to Singapore’s development as a knowledge-based economy and society as it helps to provide solutions to improve people’s lives, create job opportunities and enter new industries. Virtual Singapore was launched in December 2014 as part of Singapore’s Smart Nation drive. The Virtual Singapore platform is expected to be completed by 2018.\n\nAbout Dassault Systèmes\n\nDassault Systèmes, the 3DEXPERIENCE Company, provides business and people with virtual universes to imagine sustainable innovations.
