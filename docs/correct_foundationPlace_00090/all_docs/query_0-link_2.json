He was previously an expert manager at the Michelin Ladoux Research Center, part of the Group's Advanced Research Division. Specifically, since autumn 2015, he has led teams of physicists in charge of cross-functional activities inherent in the dimensioning, validation and modeling of composite materials and structures. He also studied engineering at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, then, thanks to one of the ten national scholarships awarded by the CNRS, defended a thesis at the same institution on issues of damage and durability of composite structures, which are clearly the common thread running through his scientific research work. It was during this period that he became a regular user of EF Abaqus software and has been for some fifteen years. Since then, he has been an active user of the 3DEXPERINECE chain. In addition, a very important component of his activity consists in supervising and developing the activities of a team of physicists with varied multi-scale expertise, ranging from molecular modeling to tire mechanics and materials expertise.

After his graduation, Brix started at MesH Engineering, where he used Simpack to produce load collectives for durability testing and also performed vehicle dynamic testing for stability. In 2019, Brix started as a Simulation Engineer at Mercedes-Benz, using Simpack models for real-time testing on their Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) test benches and other topics such as the suspension controller application.\n\nChristoph Herzog has been working in the field of multi-body system simulation (MBS) since studying mechanical engineering at the TU Dresden. After completing his studies, he worked for three years as a project engineer at SIMPACK AG in Gilching, near Munich. The main topics in this position were powertrain dynamics and lifing. Christoph also held Simpack training courses for new Simpack customers and led Simpack training courses at the Technical University of Munich. Since 2015, Christoph has been working at Rolls-Royce Germany in Dahlewitz, where he is active in very different areas, from gearbox design and the development of whole-engine models to the evaluation of structural dynamics in extreme events such as fan blade-off. MBS simulation is Christoph's first choice for non-linear vibration phenomena. He uses Simpack for this to a large extent. This is mainly due to the fact that the Simpack EHD module is the state-of-the-art software for journal bearings and squeeze fil damper simulations. In addition to the usual gearbox elements, Christoph also uses user routines for bevel gears or ball bearings. An essential component at Rolls-Royce is an adequate representation of the rotor dynamics simulation, which is why Rolls-Royce and, thus, Christoph put a lot of effort into model validation in this area. In Christoph's current position as a mechanical engineer at Rolls-Royce, MBS simulation with Simpack is a central component of the current research projects that Christoph supervises.\n\nDamiano Belluzzo is an Advanced Tyre Dynamics Expert at Prometeon Tyre Group.

Usually, Abaqus's capability allowed Seung Ryul Na to get insight into mechanics in given non-linear problems, which other FEA software packages failed to deliver proper solutions to him. Due to the superiority of non-linear problems, Abaqus has suggested strong, reliable, and trustable engineering solutions.\n\nSri Yarasi did his Ph.D. at IIT (Indian Institute of Technology)-New Delhi and Post-Doctoral Fellowship work at the University of Waterloo, Canada and he has now been working as an Antenna Designer for over 2 decades. He has been using CST Studio Suite since 2006 to design antennas, to verify if antennas designed by vendors are correct, to fix any issues that arise during the product cycle, and to estimate some FCC parameters such as SAR and HAC. At CST's invitation, he presented his simulation work in a workshop in Dallas, 2009 (see link).\n\nStarting with his Ph.D. in Fracture Mechanics in 1994, wedged between Unix workstations and some – then – absurdly large computer screens, Stephan got drawn to the fascination of colorful 3D results. Ignoring all caution about requiring considerable expertise highlighted in the Abaqus manuals (those days in absurdly large binders), he started developing user subroutines for constitutive models. His learning curve was assisted by a group of real experts in continuum mechanics at TU & BAM Berlin, École des Mines, Paris and UWA, Perth, Australia. Following excursions into analysis of airship designs, dental implants, fusion reactor components and tungsten carbides, his focus shifted to advanced numerical modeling methods for geotechnical analysis in mining. Mentoring and managing teams specialized in Geomechanics over the last two decades, he held a position as A/Professor and Director Mining & Resources Engineering at Monash University. Now, as Head of Technology and Innovation for Mining One, he is driving the development and application of the IUCM rock mechanics model with SIMULIA Abaqus and the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.\n\nUtku A. Özden serves as the Lead Simulation Specialist in the Advanced Materials Technology department at Velux A/S, where he is dedicated to the research and development of both existing and novel products. With over 20 years of expertise in computer-aided design and finite element analysis, his daily responsibilities revolve primarily around devising structural mechanics solutions and exploring material applications for roofing-based light and ventilation solutions. Before assuming his current role, Utku spearheaded micromechanics research at the Institute for Materials Applications in Mechanical Engineering (IWM) at RWTH Aachen University in 2010. During this period, he led the pioneering group in this field until 2016. Throughout his extensive career in both academia and industry, he actively participated as a speaker in numerous conferences and seminars, contributing to various international publications and patents. His work, largely centered on finite element studies conducted in Abaqus, has contributed to the advancement of the field. Driven by an unyielding curiosity to enhance his understanding of new methodologies, Utku is an ardent advocate for computer-aided engineering. Holding a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from RWTH Aachen University, he continues to pursue excellence in his field.\n\nDr. Li received his bachelor's degree from Fudan University, his Ph.D. from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and he is currently an independent researcher in ultra-high field magnet technology for medical instruments. Dr. Li has been engaged for 15 years in the research and development of strong field superconducting magnets, especially in the fields of ultra-high field MRI and high-temperature superconducting magnets for various industrial applications. His working experiences with the simulation tool Opera started more than 10 years ago when he was still a Ph. D student. He has mastered many core key technologies, has rich research experience and profound academic achievements in the field of MRI magnets. Dr. Li has published one book as the first author regarding the operation of Opera, one of the SIMULIA products. He published 14 SCI/EI articles and obtained a number of authorized patents and software."
