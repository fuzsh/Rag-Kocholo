Region bridge engineers review RFAs and bring forward to the Bridge RFA Coordination Committee (BRFACC) for deliberations. This project focuses on developing guidelines and tools for bridge inspection engineers, region bridge engineers, and the other members of the BRFACC to help them streamline the RFA submission and evaluation process. This will help overcome programming and resource allocation challenges while ensuring public safety and avoiding potentially unnecessary restrictions on the motoring public. These tools and guidelines will help the Load Rating Unit (LRU) load rate deteriorated and repaired beam ends.\n\nOperational Baseline and Structural Health Monitoring for the 2nd Avenue Network Arch Bridge\n\nFunding Agency: The Michigan Department of Transportation\n\nPI: Upul Attanayake, Ph.D., P.E.\n\nDuration: January 2022 –May 2024\n\nA skewed, unbraced network tied-arch bridge was constructed to carry the 2nd Avenue over I-94. This 265 ft long, 96.5 ft wide structure carries vehicular traffic, bicycles, and pedestrians in separate dedicated lanes. The unique structural configuration and the use of innovative accelerated bridge construction (ABC) technique made this one of the most significant projects in bridge engineering. The bridge skeleton, consisting of trapezoidal steel arch ribs, tie girders, end diaphragms, and steel floor beams was assembled in a staging area near the bridge site. In implementing ABC, the bridge skeleton was moved into alignment using self-propelled modular transporters (SPMTs) during a 7-day closure of I-94. Following the SPMT move, including lifting and sliding activities, and the placement of the skeleton on permanent bearings, the remaining construction activities were completed.\n\nThe ultimate goals of this project are to establish (i) the final state of stress at the end of the 2nd Avenue over I-94 bridge construction, (ii) the operational baseline by conducting a static live load test, (iii) stress envelopes for the safe operation of the structure, and (iv) a functional monitoring system and necessary tools for data-driven maintenance decision-making.\n\nCompleted projects\n\nConcrete Deterioration of Prestressed Bridge Beams\n\nFunding Agency: The Michigan Department of Transportation\n\nPI/Co-PI: Upul Attanayake, Ph.D., P.E.;
