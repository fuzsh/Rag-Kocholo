        "text": "VELIZY-VILLACOUBLAY, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dassault Systèmes (Paris:DSY) (Euronext Paris: #13065, DSY.PA), the 3DEXPERIENCE Company, world leader in 3D design software, 3D Digital Mock Up and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions, today announced that it will showcase how the 3DEXPERIENCE platform is helping industry, government and citizens worldwide to imagine, develop and experience sustainable urban solutions at the World Cities Summit in Singapore from July 10-14, 2016. The company’s on-site experiences will include immersive, virtual reality universes with the HTC Vive.\n\nIndustrial change is taking place at many levels with the emergence of smart products, 3D printing and automation. These major trends will impact the world economy and society, and converge in cities of the future that will boast and connect intelligent systems. Given that almost 60 percent of the world’s population already lives in urban centers, innovations are essential to reconcile economic growth with sustainable development.\n\nIn the context of this year’s theme, “Liveable & Sustainable Cities: Innovative Cities of Opportunity,” Dassault Systèmes will enable World Cities Summit visitors to experience the future of health and social services, utilities, mobility, security and public safety, facilities management and environmental planning in sustainable cities. Three locations at the event will feature Dassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE City, including 3D virtual reality environments with the HTC Vive, gaming, demonstration videos and discussions that inspire a thought-provoking understanding of urban economic and social opportunities.\n\nIn the city of Singapore’s official “Towards a Smart & Sustainable Singapore” pavilion, visitors can discover how “Virtual Singapore” integrates city data from sensors and systems in 3DEXPERIENCE City’s collaborative environment to virtually represent and manage Singapore’s data and processes. “Virtual Singapore” is championed by National Research Foundation (NRF), the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), in collaboration with Dassault Systèmes.\n\nDassault Systèmes’ invitation-only hospitality suite will virtually transform into a penthouse with 360° city views. Here, guests can participate in an interactive, immersive review of an urban master plan. As four fictional city stakeholders—mayor, town planner, architect and economic development manager—they can access and share 3DEXPERIENCE City data in a virtual environment to collaborate on traffic, business activity, public services and architecture.\n\nAt Dassault Systèmes’ booth, consumers can engage in fun and easy 3DEXPERIENCE City serious game and virtual reality experiences. These demonstrate how urban solutions can begin at home and collectively impact a city, by challenging players to improve their level of sustainability while changing the virtual configuration of a Singapore apartment.\n\n“We are now entering an era of urban renaissance centered on quality of life and economic efficiency. In this era, experiences are necessary to open up new avenues for collaboration, discussion, planning and, ultimately, sustainable living,” said Dominique Florack, President, Research and Development, Dassault Systèmes. “The 3DEXPERIENCE platform facilitates this on city official, business and individual levels: to analyze and manage city resources and services, virtually simulate ‘what if’ infrastructure and logistics scenarios, as well as to serve as an information portal or a virtual marketplace.”\n\nDominique Florack will participate in the panel discussion “Building Resilient Cities and Communities – Strengthening the Physical City,” hosted by Henk W. J. Ovink, Special Envoy for International Water Affairs for the Kingdom of the Netherlands, on July 12 from 9-10:30 a.m.\n\nDassault Systèmes’ hospitality suite will be located on Level 4 #4412, and both its booth and “Virtual Singapore” on Level 5.\n\nFor more information about Dassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE City initiative, visit: www.3dexperiencecity.com\n\nAbout Dassault Systèmes\n\nDassault Systèmes, the 3DEXPERIENCE Company, provides business and people with virtual universes to imagine sustainable innovations.
