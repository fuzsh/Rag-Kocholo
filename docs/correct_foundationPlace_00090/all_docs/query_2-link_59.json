        "text": "Simulia Abaqus: Crash Test, Fracture & Damage, Blast & Explosion, Impact & Penetration, Thermal Analysis, Drop Test, Acoustics and Vibro-Acoustics\n\nMany real-world engineering problems involve nonlinear behavior, such as material nonlinearity, contact, and large deformations. Abaqus is well-equipped to handle such scenarios and has a strong reputation for its ability to accurately simulate nonlinear responses. It is particularly suitable for modeling buckling, collapse, soft materials, and contact between deformable bodies. With Abaqus, we can simulate conductive and convective heat transfer, mass diffusion, acoustics, piezoelectricity, and electrochemistry either independently, sequentially coupled, or fully coupled with the stress analysis. What makes Abaqus uniquely powerful is its modularity. Abaqus can simulate rubber and polymers, reinforced concrete, glass and ceramics, crushable or resilient foam, and geotechnical materials like soils and rock.\n\nAbaqus/Explicit\n\nAbaqus/Explicit is an explicit-dynamic finite element solver specifically designed for simulating brief transient dynamic events. It is well-suited for scenarios involving highly nonlinear behavior, such as consumer electronics drop tests, automotive crashes, ballistic impacts, rolling of hot metal, and slow crushing of energy-absorbing structures.\n\nAbaqus/Explicit excels in handling severely nonlinear behavior, including contact, which makes it attractive for simulating quasi-static events.

Complex mechanical assemblies present design challenges that require a dynamic system-level analysis to be met. Accurate modeling can require representations of various types of components, like electronic controls systems and compliant parts and connections, as well as complicated physical phenomena like vibration, friction and noise. MBD analysis enables us to meet these challenges by quickly evaluating and improving designs for important characteristics like performance, safety and comfort.\n\nRead more...\n\nNVH & Acoustics for Hybrid & Electric Vehicles\n\nIn NVH Engineering and simulation of Hybrid/Electric Vehicles, the noise from tire, wind or auxiliaries, which consequently become increasingly audible due to the removal of the broadband engine masking sound, should be studied. New noise sources like tonal sounds emerge from the electro-mechanical drive systems and often have, despite their low overall noise levels, a high annoyance rating. Engine/exhaust sounds are often used to contribute to the “character” of the vehicle leads to an open question how to realize an appealing brand sound with EV.\n\nRead more..."
