        "text": "I remember visiting QARGOS's Pune facility in November 2022 with Suchit Jain and meeting up with Alok Das Pranav Shinde and their talented team. The atmosphere in their design space was electrifying. You could feel that the team was focused and committed to a mission - To Advance the World's Transition to Sustainable Logistics. Of course, they are one of the 20,000 startups that are part of our SOLIDWORKS for Startups program and are using the power of the #3DEXPERIENCEplatform. Special thanks to the world-class mentoring by Srikrishna Srinivasa Chittur, Go-To-Market Leader: 3DEXPERIENCEWorks Simulation Portfolio. You have a Winner here, and we are so proud of you, Team Qargos!!

It‚Äôs always humbling to bump into startup founders who joined the SOLIDWORKS for Startups program a few years ago and are now well on their way to launching their innovations in the market successfully. In the words of one founder I met at TechCrunch Disrupt last year, ‚ÄúWhen we started out 4 years ago, all we had was- a napkin sketch, sleepless nights, no money, and a SOLIDWORKS model that we would pan, zoom, rotate ad infinitum as we ran optimization cycles on it‚Äù. It‚Äôs powerful! We started the SOLIDWORKS for Startups program 7 years ago in the spirit of ‚Äògivefirst‚Äô and continue to provide access to over $100,000 worth of Design, Engineering and Simulation software FREE for the first year, at 70% and 50% off for the subsequent years. Thanks to all of you who have helped shape this program that has accelerated journeys of over 20,000 hardware startups. Couldn‚Äôt have been possible without the help of: Inspiring Leaders - Philippe LAUFER John Kitchingman Gian Paolo Bassi Suchit Jain Frederic Vacher Florence Verzelen Ramakrishnan Venkataraman P M Ravikumar Sudarshan Mogasale Benjamin Tan William Ma CK Goh Jaein Bae Tom Acland Simge Akarsu Walsh Jennifer Thomas Kristen Wilson (Syrek) Filip Kuttner Srikrishna Srinivasa Chittur A hard-working team - Rollin Willis Axel Erraoui Praveen Charles Mikkel Marott - I ‚ù§Ô∏èüöÄüí° 3DEXPERIENCE Lab team - Jillian Friot Sean Farrell Fabien Bartel Suhaspritipal G Our Partners - Greentown Labs MassRobotics T-Works PEN Ventures Rev: Ithaca Startup Works mHUB HAX HCVC and 200+ accelerators/incubators Gl√ºxkind | Techstars '23 Linas Gela≈æanskas\n\nAs the 24 of us complete our year-long journey of Dassault Syst√®mes Go Lead Our TomorroW (GLOW) Leadership program with INSEAD, it brings me great joy in thanking these seven sets of leaders without whom this pursuit could not have been possible. John Kitchingman Gian Paolo Bassi Suchit Jain Frederic Vacher Victoire de Margerie from SOLIDWORKS and 3DEXPERIENCE Lab for their trust in me and for nominating me for the program. Florence Verzelen Laurence Barth√®s for their executive vision and energy behind the GLOW program, with exemplary support from Auriane Joudiou Fabienne COURTEIX Executive Jury - Florence Verzelen Erik Swedberg Florence HU-AUBIGNY Philippe LAUFER Laurence Barthes for awarding our team‚Äôs Action Learning Project (ALP) the coveted LEADERSHIP MINDSET AWARD. I know it was a tough choice as all the teams had compelling presentations. Our Professors at INSEAD - Chengyi Lin (specially you- for your inspiration, energy and perspectives on Leadership) Dr Franklin Vrede Li Huang Antonio Fatas Veronique Doux Tom Acland - our project sponsor, for his indomitable trust and patience as our core team navigated the labyrinthe of online touchpoints engineering to synthesize our final direction. C√©line CHEDRU GUIGAN for her unwavering patience, positivity and commitment as our GLOW deputee :) And of course, Oumaima K. Marc Truffault Chris Clark David Gadarian for being co-passengers, drivers, navigators and sometimes ticket checkers on this amazing journey. The fact that at one point we actually fell deeply in love with our project made all the difference I think. Together we did Glow! Thanks for being the hurdler, the anthropologist, the cross pollinator and the set designer for the project!! Special thanks to Patrick JOHNSON Manish Kumar Fran√ßois-R√©gis Chaumartin Kurt Chen and Vincent Liu for your guidance and time! And to the entire cohort of GLOW 2024. Thanks for being part of the extended family and for the fun times we had at Fontainebleu. Of course, to my family - Poonam Dhiman and my two guinea pigs (Cookie and Candy) whom I disturbed at 3am twice a week for past few months as I worked on our project and bumped into furniture trying to reach for the lights. You can sleep well now :) And yes, my team, for your constant support! - Personally, it felt like I completed a full circle here. 9 years ago as I was packing my bags to come to the beautiful #Cornell campus for my MBA, I stumbled upon an INSEAD info booklet. I didnt end up applying but I distinctly remember saying to myself ‚ÄúMaybe Next Time!‚Äù Thanks Dassault Systemes for helping me manifest that fleeting thought! And finally, I have the answer to the question I asked Chengyi Lin on Day 1 of the program. Yes, Leadership can be FUN! Lourdes Casanova Soumitra Dutta Sara Dutta #WeAre3DS #WeAreGLOWERS\n\nOk I was waiting.. waiting to return to Boston and see if the magic of #3dexperienceworld2024 would wear off or if the crazy schedule - helping with presentations, maker zone, startup zone, meetings,..would wear me down. Well neither did, and I came whistling to office at 8am today again..as my friend Katerina Miklos (Pichugina) said ‚ÄúI actually feel refreshed by the 3DEXPERIENCE World‚Äù. So true! This 3DEXPERIENCE World was different somehow!! It had this element of ‚Äúdense thrill‚Äù sprinkled with the indomitable spirit of #community that‚Äôs so palpable when you are part of the large SOLIDWORKS and the larger Dassault Syst√®mes family. Special thanks to - Chinloo Lama Sal Lama for making my life so easy by championing the Makers Zone this year - Jillian Friot Rollin Willis Axel Erraoui for bringing the power of startups from 3DEXPERIENCE Lab and the SOLIDWORKS for Startups program to the playground - Sean Farrell for plugging all the gaps and lending his yeoman‚Äôs service to the Lab and the event!
