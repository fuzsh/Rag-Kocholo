        "text": "With the increased use of high-strength, low-weight composite materials in structural design, DatapointLabs has seen an increase in demand for physical properties of these materials. For many years DatapointLabs has offered testing to capture rate sensitivity of polymeric and metallic materials for use in CAE simulation. Now we are extending this offering to composite materials, incorporating tensile, flexural and shear deformations.\n\nComposites present a significant simulation challenge because of their orthotropic nature, so that even simple stiffness predictions require a complex material model. Last year, we presented a paper at the NAFEMS conference on Use of Digital Image Correlation to Obtain Material Model Parameters for Composites. Composites testing has now been extended into the dynamic arena with high strain-rate testing capability up to 100/s. Further developments are under way to provide even more material tests for composite materials, as well as to implement more composite material models for supported structural CAE platforms.\n\nReview our Test Catalog to find individual tests and TestPaksÂ® to meet your material data needs.\n\nDatapointLabs is proud to be a sponsor of Ithaca High School's FIRST Robotics Team 639, Code Red Robotics. In March, the team successfully defended its 2013 Buckeye Regional title in Cleveland, Ohio, among 54 teams from across North America. In addition, the team received the Innovation in Control Award, which recognizes an innovative application of control components to provide unique machine performance, their unique hammer drive provided exceptional power as needed while also conserving battery power.\n\nA Code Red Robotics team member with the \"Red Hippo\" robot, sponsored in part by DatapointLabs, watches the action at a competition (left). The 2014 Buckeye Regional Championship alliance included Team 639, Code Red Robotics (right).\n\nThe Code Red Robotics team has now qualified for the 2014 International Championships in St. Louis from April 24-26, where less than one percent of FIRST teams worldwide will compete.\n\nThe team has done well at past competitions, winning Regional competitions in 2004, 2005, and 2013; receiving the Engineering Inspiration Award in 2012; and attending the International Championships last year. We wish the team continued success as they plan for the 2014 International Championships!"
