        "text": "Abstract\n\nMSML2023 is the fourth edition of a newly established conference, with emphasis on promoting the study of mathematical theory and algorithms of machine learning, as well as applications of machine learning in scientific computing and engineering disciplines. This conference aims to bring together the communities of machine learning, applied mathematics, and computational science and engineering, to exchange ideas and progress in the fast-growing field of scientific machine learning (SciML). The objective of this annual conference series is to promote the study of:\n\nTheory and algorithms of machine learning.\n\nApplications in scientific and engineering disciplines such as physics, chemistry, material sciences, fluid and solid mechanics, etc.\n\nTo provide hands-on tutorials for students and new researchers in the field.\n\nPrevious MSML Conferences:\n\nFirst MSML: https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/news/msml2020-mathematical-and-scientific-machine-learning-conference\n\nSecond MSML: https://msml21.github.io/\n\nThird MSML: https://msml22.github.io/\n\nSubmission for contributed posters/talks is now open and will stay open until February 10, 2023.\n\nPlease submit this form to be considered.\n\nThis workshop is partially funded by AFOSR award FA9550-23-1-0193 and DOE award DE-SC0023818."
