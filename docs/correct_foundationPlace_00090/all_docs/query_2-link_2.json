In the decades since, we’ve grown to become a global leader in sustainable innovation, with 13 brands spanning the product development cycle serving over 300,000 companies of all sizes and industries.\n\nSince 1981 we have helped thousands of manufacturers reinvent their development and production methods to enable sustainable innovation and catalyze the modern world’s greatest industrial transformations. Two generations of innovators at Dassault Systèmes have revealed the power of virtual worlds to imagine and create disruptive innovations, and to empower businesses to realize their greatest ambitions.\n\nFrom 3D design to 3D experiences, Dassault Systèmes has transformed the way products are designed, simulated and produced across industries. Having started with virtual twins of things – planes, cars, factories, cities – we now extend this capability to living organisms, including human beings. We’re a little more than 40 years in, but we’re just getting started.\n\nWe are a growing company! To quickly fulfill our purpose of harmonizing product, nature and life, we have acquired many firms to advance our offerings and add people who share our vision for transforming industry."
