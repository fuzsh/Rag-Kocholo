        "text": "üì£ Breaking News! EOMYS Joins the SIMULIA Brand of Dassault Syst√®mes! üéâ We‚Äôre happy to announce that EOMYS has joined the SIMULIA brand of Dassault Syst√®mes, which aligns perfectly with our vision to shorten development cycles, reduce prototyping costs, and democratize modeling and simulation. üåü EOMYS has been the forefront of helping our customers solve magnetic noise & vibration (e-NVH) issues induced by electric motors. Initially started as an engineering services company, our e-NVH knowledge and experience became the foundation for the robust technology in the EOMYS Manatee software. üí° Manatee‚Äôs unique capabilities makes it easier and faster for electrical, mechanical and NVH engineers to assess requirements and improve NVH performance at all design stages of electrical drives, from the e-motor concept phase to the system-level detailed design phase üí° We're committed to strengthening the interoperability between Manatee and the SIMULIA simulation portfolio spanning electromagnetics (Opera and CST Studio Suite), multibody dynamics (Simpack), structures (Abaqus), and vibro-acoustics (Wave6), among others, to increase the value of multidisciplinary and multiphysics simulation for our customers. üåê By integrating Manatee into the Dassault Syst√®mes 3DEXPERIENCE¬Æ platform, which provides the foundation for unified modeling and simulation, our combined teams will deliver end-to-end solutions for accelerating the design and development of electrical machines. üöÄ We are highly motivated to support and expand the global Manatee and SIMULIA user communities. Connect with us to keep up with fresh news as we embark on this new journey together! Note: Manatee website can now be accessed at https://buff.ly/3WZFbZI #WeAre3DS #SIMULIA #eNVH #Manateesoftware #electricmotors #electricalmachines"
