        "text": "After teaching 1000’s of students and writing about SOLIDWORKS and SOLIDWORKS Simulation for over 25 years, David Planchard, emeritus WPI, is exploring 3DEXPERIENCE Simulation and the Abaqus solver. Through the SOLIDWORKS and 3DEXPERIENCE Simulation Lesson series, David helps educators understand 3DEXPERIENCE Simulation fundamentals through simple examples and industry practices.\n\nDassault Systèmes owns SOLIDWORKS and various simulation software packages. Simulation packages range from SOLIDWORKS Simulation, CATIA Analysis, Abaqus and many others. All of them are under the SIMULIA family.\n\nWhy do I teach my first year engineering students about simple stress analysis using 3DEXPERIENCE Simulation? I want them to get excited about their more advanced classes over the next 4 years.\n\nLearning the theory to derive complex formulas to understand the variables is essential, but getting early exposure to simulation software, brings theory to reality with instant visualizations and what-ifs. This shows the students the potential of using simulation in the real world.\n\nIn this lesson, learn the proper workflow to upload a SOLIDWORKS part to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform and perform a Static Linear Simulation study using the Abaqus solver.\n\nOpen a SOLIDWORKS part that has not been saved to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. Upload the part to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. Save the part in your Collaborative space. Use an existing Bookmark. Return to your SOLIDWORKS desktop. Lock the part.\n\nLaunch the Linear Structural Validation App from the SOLIDWORKS Task Pane. Set Simulation Study preferences. Understand how to modify the default solver units. Run a Structural analysis. Set Study conditions: Mesh type (Tetrahedron second-order elements), Material (Alloy Steel), Fixed Displacement Restraint (three holes) and Load (13300N Force).\n\nCreate three plots: Von Mises Stress, Displacement, and Factor of Safety. Review the plots to interpret the results. Save the simulation in your Collaborative space.\n\n3DEXPERIENCE Engineer in Education contains the entire 3DEXPERIENCE Works Structural Simulation portfolio.\n\nLaunch the 3DEXPERIENCE Platform and start SOLIDWORKS\n\nBefore we start, there are a few items that you need to know.\n\nIn this lesson, use your default Collaborative space. An internet connection is required. A 3DEXPERIENCE ID is required.\n\nThe Simulation lesson provides a foundation to users who are new to using simulation to solve real-word engineering and design problems. A Solid body is used. You should have a basic understanding of Stress and Finite Element Method (FEM).\n\n3DEXPERIENCE Launcher needs to be installed. 3DEXPERIENCE Works Lesson 1: Getting Started with SOLIDWORKS.\n\nThe 3DEXPERIENCE platform is browser driven. Your existing cookies and cache determine what you will see on your computer desktop or during a SOLIDWORKS login. A full installation of SOLIDWORKS 2019 SP0 or later is required.\n\nStart a SOLIDWORKS session from your desktop.\n\nDouble-click the SOLIDWORKS icon.\n\nView the illustration below. Depending on your system setup, cookies, and cache, it will be different. Read the provided information.\n\nInput the requested data.\n\nClick Accept All.\n\nThe Welcome – SOLIDWORKS dialog box is displayed.\n\nYou are logged into the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.\n\nClose the Welcome dialog box.\n\nClick the 3DEXPERIENCE icon in the Task Pane. The MySession panel is displayed. This displays the two-way communication between SOLIDWORKS running on your desktop and the 3DEXPERIENCE platform running in the cloud.\n\nIn this lesson, I’m using a Collaborative space named Quick Start xDesign.\n\nNote: If you do not see the 3DEXPERIENCE icon, click the Options drop-down arrow, click Add-Ins, check the 3DEXPERIENCE box, click OK, from the SOLIDWORKS Main menu.\n\nClick Accept All.\n\nDownload Model 8-6\n\nDownload the SOLIDWORKS part, Model 8-6 to follow along with this lesson.\n\nModel 8-6\n\nOpen Model 8-6 that has not been previously uploaded or saved to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.\n\nExpand the Task Pane bar. The MySession panel displays a tree view of the active file and a list of commands that can be accessed through the Action bar and context menu.\n\nThe orange save Status icon for Model 8-6 informs you that the local file on your computer has not been saved to the platform. Save the part to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.\n\nClick Save Active Window from the Lifecycle tab in the Action bar.\n\nThe file is temporarily being saved to a local cache area. The platform is checking for out of date components, modified components from the last save to the platform, different revisions, missing components, etc.\n\nSelect Bookmark\n\nThe Save to 3DEXPERIENCE dialog box and PLM attributes are displayed.\n\nSave the model. Use your existing Collaborative space. Use an existing Bookmark. Note: If needed view 3DEXPERIENCE Works Lesson 3: SOLIDWORKS and Bookmarks, Share and Delete.\n\nClick the Select Bookmark down arrow.\n\nClick Select Bookmark. The Select a Bookmark dialog box is displayed.\n\nIn the below example, I selected Design Project 104 as my bookmark.\n\nClick Apply from the Select a Bookmark dialog box.\n\nClick Save from the Save to 3DEXPERIENCE dialog box.\n\nThe model is directly loaded into your Collaborative space and Bookmarked on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. You return back into your SOLIDWORKS desktop session.\n\nView the Status column in the updated MySession panel. The Status icon displays a green check mark. This means that the current file on your SOLIDWORKS desktop is updated and saved to the platform. The default Revision is A. The Maturity State is “In Work”. This is the default Lifecycle state after you saved the model to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.\n\nLock the part. This prevents anyone else in making a change to it.\n\nRight-click Model 8-6 in the MySessionPanel.\n\nClick Lock. The lock icon is displayed. Model 8-6 is selected.\n\nLinear Structural Validation App\n\nClick the center of the Compass. Use the Linear Structural Validation App. Think of this App as the SOLIDWORKS Simulation Add-in inside of SOLIDWORKS. Most of the 3DEXPERIENCE Apps run in your web browser. 3DEXPERIENCE Simulation Apps perform a small installation on your windows machine. Both types of Apps are linked to your PLM data on the platform. The Linear Structural Validation App provides the ability to run Linear Structural, Buckling, Frequency, and Thermal Simulation studies.\n\nDrag the slider downward to view the Linear Structural Validation App.\n\nLaunch the Linear Structural Validation App. Note: If this is your first time using a 3DEXPERIENCE Simulation App, download the needed App information on your computer.\n\nThis can take 10 – 15 seconds.\n\nThe 3DEXPERIENCE | SIMULIA Linear Structural Validation App is displayed.\n\nExcept the default Simulation title.\n\nSelect Structural from the Analysis type drop-down menu.\n\nClick OK from the Simulation initialization dialog box. In a Linear analysis, there is a linear relationship between the applied loads and the induced response of the component. In a Nonlinear analysis the response of the component is not a linear function of the magnitude of the applied loads.\n\nThe Action bar is displayed.\n\nUse a View tool to move the model in the center of the window.\n\nView the Orientation of the Triad.\n\nRename the default Simulation title. The default title is Physics Simulation 00001853.\n\nSetup Simulation Properties\n\nClick the Setup tab in the Action bar.\n\nClick Simulation Properties.\n\nThe Properties dialog is displayed.

Click Tree Display.\n\nThe Simulation Study tree displays the Structural Simulation Process. Model (Geometry, Meshing (Element Family), and Property Definition). Scenario (Simulation Type, Solution Method, Element Type, Boundary Conditions, Loads, and Solver). Result (Types of plots, Animations and Tools).\n\nApply Mesh\n\nApply a Global mesh. Use the default element type (Tetrahedron second-order elements). Mesh refinement is very important in regions of high stress concentrations such as regions of contact or sharp corners. Typically a smaller element size yields more accurate results, but increases the run time.\n\nClick the Mesh tab in the Action bar.\n\nClick Generate Mesh. Meshing splits continuous geometric models into finite elements. The types of elements created by this process depend on the type of geometry meshed. In this example a solid element (Continuum) – solid geometry is used.\n\nThe mesh is displayed on the model.\n\nUnits and Preferences\n\nView the default solver units and preferences.\n\nClick your profile picture (Avatar).\n\nClick Preferences from the drop-down menu.\n\nThe Preference dialog box is displayed. View your options.\n\nModify the mouse profile from the default (3DEXPERIENCE) to SOLIDWORKS.\n\nClick the Common Preferences tab.\n\nClick Profile.\n\nSelect SOLIDWORKS from the drop-down menu under Profile Management.\n\nView the default Parameters, Measures, and Units in the Abaqus solver.

View the results. Your material library maybe different than illustrated.\n\nClick Alloy Steel under the Steel column.\n\nClick the Simulation tab. The material definition in a FEA simulation specifies all of the relevant material properties and the proper material behavior (such as Density, Young’s Modulus, Thermal conductivity, etc.).\n\nReturn back to the Material screen.\n\nDrag and drop Alloy Steel on the model.\n\nThe material is applied to the model.\n\nClick the green check mark from the Pop-up menu.\n\nClose the Material Palette dialog box.\n\nSave Study\n\nSave the Simulation study.\n\nClick the Share icon as illustrated.\n\nClick Save. By default, the model and Simulation study data is saved to your Collaborative space on the platform. For Simulation study data, there are two locations, either on your local machine or on the platform. By default, the Simulation study data is stored to your Collaborative space.\n\nNo Connections are required for the study. The Assistant displays a green checkmark.\n\nBoundary Conditions\n\nAddress Boundary Conditions. Restraints are used to restrict the motion of certain surfaces in the model when loaded. In a Static Stress simulation, one or more restraints are required. Apply three restraints in the study.\n\nClick Boundary Conditions from the Assistant dialog box.\n\nDrag the slider downward to view Fixed Displacement.\n\nClick Fixed Displacement.\n\nThe Fixed Displacement dialog box is displayed.\n\nSelect the inside faces of the three holes. 3 Faces are displayed in the Support box.\n\nClick the X, Y, Z Translation box. No movement in the X, Y, Z direction will occur.\n\nClick OK from the Fixed Displacement dialog box. Boundary Conditions display a green check mark in the Assistant.\n\nView the Simulation Study tree. The Simulation Study tree displays the object structure. The Material area displays Alloy Steel. The Scenario area displays a Static Stress Simulation.\n\nLoads\n\nApply a translational load (13300N Force) in a single direction on a flat face.\n\nClick Loads from the Assistant dialog box.\n\nDrag the slider downward to view Force.\n\nClick Force.\n\nThe Force dialog box is displayed. The default name is Force.1. The default unit in the Abaqus solver is Newton.\n\nClick the top circular face of the model as illustrated. 1 Face is displayed in the Support box.\n\nEnter 13300N for Force. The Force is pointing downwards in the Global or local z direction.\n\nClick OK from the Force dialog box.\n\nLoads (1) is created. A green check mark is displayed.\n\nClick Loads (1) in the Assistant dialog box.\n\nClick the edit icon.\n\nThe Feature Manager dialog box is displayed.\n\nDouble-click Magnitude: 13300N in the Definition column. The Force dialog box is displayed. Edit the Force if needed. Note: This will be performed in Lesson 12 Part 2.\n\nClick Cancel.\n\nVisibility Manager\n\nClick the Visibility Manager icon. The Visibility Manager is displayed.\n\nView your options to Hide/Show Simulation Study objects.\n\nClose the Visibility Manager dialog box.\n\nClose the Feature Manager dialog box.\n\nSimulate\n\nRun the Simulation.\n\nClick Simulate from the Assistant dialog box.\n\nClick Simulate as illustrated to run the Linear Static Simulation.\n\nFor a new user, It is recommended to run the Simulation using Local interactive. Local interactive is set by default using an embedded license. The Simulation is executed on your computer and the user interface is locked while the Simulation is in process.\n\nUp to 4 physical cores are supported when using an Educational license.\n\nClick OK from the Simulate dialog box.\n\nExpand and read the Warnings.\n\nClose the Simulation Status dialog box.\n\nClick Close.\n\nClose the Assistant dialog box.\n\nResults Von Mises Stress Plot\n\nAnalyze the simulation results to understand the stress and displacement patterns that develop as the force deforms the model. The Von Mises Stress plot is displayed by default.\n\nIn this example, use the result contour plots for the Von Mises stress, Displacement, and Factor of Safety (FOS). Verify that the Von Mises stresses do not exceed the material’s yield strength. For most metals, the yield strength is defined as the stress point at 0.2% strain offset. For Alloy Steel this is (6.204 × 108N/m2).The maximum Von Mises stress (1.1 × 109N/m2) is above the material’s yield strength of (6.204 × 108N/m2). Basics of Stress Limits for 3DEXPERIENCE – YouTube.\n\nThe mouse cursor automatically acts as a probe.\n\nRotate the part to view the highest stress area.\n\nClick a point on the model as illustrated. View the Von Mises Stress at that point. A Pop-up menu is displayed. Note: to deselect the displayed point, click in the Graphics area.\n\nClick the Show Min/Max Values icon in the Pop-up menu.\n\nView the results. The maximum stress occurs at the corner as illustrated. The maximum Von Mises stress (1.1 × 109N/m2) is above the material’s yield strength of (6.204 × 108N/m2).\n\nClick the Hide Max or Min values and close icon.\n\nThe bolt hole closest to the maximum stress also experiences a high amount of stress compared to other regions of the model. When a part sustains high stress values that exceed the material’s yield strength, you need to validate that the part is safe from material failure.\n\nResults Displacement Plot\n\nCreate a Displacement contour plot. Note: In SOLIDWORKS Simulation the URES Resultant Displacement and the Displacement in 3DEXPERIENCE Simulation represents the same displacement components. Displacement Component 1, 2 and 3 in 3DEXPERIENCE Simulation represents the same displacement components as UX, UY and UZ in SOLIDWORKS Simulation.\n\nThe maximum displacement occurs at the bottom of the cylindrical feature. There is a relatively small amount (0.0502mm) of deformation on one side of the base.\n\nResults Factor of Safety Plot\n\nReview the Factor of Safety (FOS) contour plot to identify the critical regions of the model.\n\nThe FOS plot displays how close a material is to yielding. The Factor of Safety is calculated by dividing the material’s Proof (Yield) Strength by the Allowable stress.\n\nCreate a Factor of Safety (FOS) contour plot.\n\nThe FOS plot has a maximum limit of 2 by default. Regions of the model with a FOS larger than 2 are shown in gray.\n\nRegions of the model with a FOS less than 1, develop stresses above the material’s yield strength under the current loading conditions.\n\nThe smallest factors of safety occur in the localized regions where the highest Von Mises stresses occur.\n\nNote: To modify the max value of the FOS plot, double-click the plot legend, and enter a value.\n\nSave and Close\n\nSave the model and Simulation study.\n\nClick the Share icon as illustrated.\n\nClick Save.\n\nClose the Simulation study.\n\nClick Close on the First Simulation A tab.\n\nThe lesson is finished.\n\nIn Analysis Lesson 3: SOLIDWORKS and 3DEXPERIENCE Simulation Linear Structural Part2, modify the Simulation Study and create a Simulation report.\n\nMore to Explore\n\n3DEXPERIENCE Communities:\n\nAcademic Community: After you create a 3DEXPERIENCE ID, Educators, can get more information on SOLIDWORKS and the 3DEXPERIENCE Platform.
