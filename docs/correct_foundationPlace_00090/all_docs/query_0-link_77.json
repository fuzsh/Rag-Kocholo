(1980) has proven successful to capture the essential mechanical features of articular cartilage. In order to analyse the joint contact mechanics in real, anatomical joints, the cartilage model needs to be implemented into a suitable finite element code to approximate the irregular surface geometries of such joints. However, systematic and extensive evaluation of the capacity of commercial software for modelling the contact mechanics with biphasic cartilage layers has not been made. This research was aimed at evaluating the commercial finite element software ABAQUS for analysing biphasic soft tissues. The solutions obtained using ABAQUS were compared with those obtained using other finite element models and analytical solutions for three numerical tests: an unconfined indentation test, a test with the contact of a spherical cartilage surface with a rigid plate, and an axi-symmetric joint contact test. It was concluded that the biphasic cartilage model can be implemented into the commercial finite element software ABAQUS to analyse practical joint contact problems with biphasic articular cartilage layers.\n\nMicromechanics-Based Structural Analysis (FEAMAC) and Multiscale Visualization within Abaqus/CAE Environment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nArnold, Steven M.; Bednarcyk, Brett A.; Hussain, Aquila; Katiyar, Vivek\n\n2010-01-01\n\nA unified framework is presented that enables coupled multiscale analysis of composite structures and associated graphical pre- and postprocessing within the Abaqus/CAE environment. The recently developed, free, Finite Element Analysis--Micromechanics Analysis Code (FEAMAC) software couples NASA's Micromechanics Analysis Code with Generalized Method of Cells (MAC/GMC) with Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit to perform micromechanics based FEA such that the nonlinear composite material response at each integration point is modeled at each increment by MAC/GMC. The Graphical User Interfaces (FEAMAC-Pre and FEAMAC-Post), developed through collaboration between SIMULIA Erie and the NASA Glenn Research Center, enable users to employ a new FEAMAC module within Abaqus/CAE that provides access to the composite microscale. FEA IAC-Pre is used to define and store constituent material properties, set-up and store composite repeating unit cells, and assign composite materials as sections with all data being stored within the CAE database. Likewise FEAMAC-Post enables multiscale field quantity visualization (contour plots, X-Y plots), with point and click access to the microscale i.e., fiber and matrix fields).\n\nToward high-speed 3D nonlinear soft tissue deformation simulations using Abaqus software.\n\nPubMed\n\nIdkaidek, Ashraf; Jasiuk, Iwona\n\n2015-12-01\n\nWe aim to achieve a fast and accurate three-dimensional (3D) simulation of a porcine liver deformation under a surgical tool pressure using the commercial finite element software Abaqus. The liver geometry is obtained using magnetic resonance imaging, and a nonlinear constitutive law is employed to capture large deformations of the tissue. Effects of implicit versus explicit analysis schemes, element type, and mesh density on computation time are studied. We find that Abaqus explicit and implicit solvers are capable of simulating nonlinear soft tissue deformations accurately using first-order tetrahedral elements in a relatively short time by optimizing the element size. This study provides new insights and guidance on accurate and relatively fast nonlinear soft tissue simulations. Such simulations can provide force feedback during robotic surgery and allow visualization of tissue deformations for surgery planning and training of surgical residents.\n\nAn open source software tool to assign the material properties of bone for ABAQUS finite element simulations.\n\nPubMed\n\nPegg, Elise C; Gill, Harinderjit S\n\n2016-09-06\n\nA new software tool to assign the material properties of bone to an ABAQUS finite element mesh was created and compared with Bonemat, a similar tool originally designed to work with Ansys finite element models. Our software tool (py_bonemat_abaqus) was written in Python, which is the chosen scripting language for ABAQUS. The purpose of this study was to compare the software packages in terms of the material assignment calculation and processing speed. Three element types were compared (linear hexahedral (C3D8), linear tetrahedral (C3D4) and quadratic tetrahedral elements (C3D10)), both individually and as part of a mesh. Comparisons were made using a CT scan of a hemi-pelvis as a test case. A small difference, of -0.05kPa on average, was found between Bonemat version 3.1 (the current version) and our Python package. Errors were found in the previous release of Bonemat (version 3.0 downloaded from www.biomedtown.org) during calculation of the quadratic tetrahedron Jacobian, and conversion of the apparent density to modulus when integrating over the Young×³s modulus field. These issues caused up to 2GPa error in the modulus assignment. For these reasons, we recommend users upgrade to the most recent release of Bonemat. Processing speeds were assessed for the three different element types. Our Python package took significantly longer (110s on average) to perform the calculations compared with the Bonemat software (10s). Nevertheless, the workflow advantages of the package and added functionality makes 'py_bonemat_abaqus' a useful tool for ABAQUS users. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It delivers linear and nonlinear analyses of mechanical and fluid dynamics, includes multi-body system and multi-physics coupling. However, the visualization capability of Abaqus using its CAE module is limited. Models from microtomography have extremely complicated structures, and datasets of Abaqus output are huge, requiring a visualization tool more powerful than Abaqus/CAE. We convert Abaqus output into the XML-based VTK format by developing a Python script and then using ParaView to visualize the results. Such capabilities as volume rendering, tensor glyphs, superior animation and other filters allow ParaView to offer excellent visualizing manifestations. ParaView's parallel visualization makes it possible to visualize very big data. To support full parallel visualization, the Python script achieves data partitioning by reorganizing all nodes, elements and the corresponding results on those nodes and elements. The data partition scheme minimizes data redundancy and works efficiently. Given its good readability and extendibility, the script can be extended to the processing of more different problems in Abaqus. We share the script with Abaqus users on GitHub.\n\nComparison between FEBio and Abaqus for biphasic contact problems.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeng, Qingen; Jin, Zhongmin; Fisher, John; Wilcox, Ruth\n\n2013-09-01\n\nArticular cartilage plays an important role in the function of diarthrodial joints. Computational methods have been used to study the biphasic mechanics of cartilage, and Abaqus has been one of the most widely used commercial software packages for this purpose. A newly developed open-source finite element solver, FEBio, has been developed specifically for biomechanical applications. The aim of this study was to undertake a direct comparison between FEBio and Abaqus for some practical contact problems involving cartilage. Three model types, representing a porous flat-ended indentation test, a spherical-ended indentation test, and a conceptual natural joint contact model, were compared. In addition, a parameter sensitivity study was also performed for the spherical-ended indentation test to investigate the effects of changes in the input material properties on the model outputs, using both FEBio and Abaqus. Excellent agreement was found between FEBio and Abaqus for all of the model types and across the range of material properties that were investigated.\n\nComparison between FEBio and Abaqus for biphasic contact problems\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJin, Zhongmin; Fisher, John; Wilcox, Ruth\n\n2013-01-01\n\nArticular cartilage plays an important role in the function of diarthrodial joints.

In HTGRs, graphite components moderate and reflect neutrons. During reactor operation, high temperature and high irradiation cause damage to the graphite crystal and grains and create other defects. This cumulative structural damage during the reactor lifetime leads to changes in graphite properties, which can alter the ability to support the designed loads. The aim of the present research is to develop a finite-element code using commercially available ABAQUS software for the structural integritymoreÂ Â» analysis of graphite core components under extreme temperature and irradiation conditions. In addition, the Reactor Geometry Generator tool-kit, developed at Argonne National Laboratory, is used to generate finite-element mesh for complex geometries such as fuel bricks with multiple pin holes and coolant flow channels. This paper presents the proposed concept and discusses results of stress analysis simulations of a fuel block with H-451 grade material properties.

To evaluate the fracture energy, V-notch specimen is fractured using the Johnson and Cook Damage model. The Charpy impact tests are of great importance related to fracture properties of steels. The objective of this work is to present absorbed energy variation at pendulum velocities of 5 m/sec, 6 m/sec, 7 m/sec and 9 m/sec in addition to stress distribution at v-notch. Finite Element Method of modeling for three dimensional specimens is used for simulation in commercial software of ABAQUS.\n\nAbaqus Simulations of Rock Response to Dynamic Loading\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSteedman, David W.; Coblentz, David\n\nThe LANL Geodynamics Team has been applying Abaqus modeling to achieve increasingly complex simulations. Advancements in Abaqus model building and simulation tools allows this progress. We use Lab-developed constitutive models, the fully coupled CEL Abaqus and general contact to simulate response of realistic sites to explosively driven shock.\n\nCoupled porohyperelastic mass transport (PHEXPT) finite element models for soft tissues using ABAQUS.\n\nPubMed\n\nVande Geest, Jonathan P; Simon, B R; Rigby, Paul H; Newberg, Tyler P\n\n2011-04-01\n\nFinite element models (FEMs) including characteristic large deformations in highly nonlinear materials (hyperelasticity and coupled diffusive/convective transport of neutral mobile species) will allow quantitative study of in vivo tissues. Such FEMs will provide basic understanding of normal and pathological tissue responses and lead to optimization of local drug delivery strategies. We present a coupled porohyperelastic mass transport (PHEXPT) finite element approach developed using a commercially available ABAQUS finite element software. The PHEXPT transient simulations are based on sequential solution of the porohyperelastic (PHE) and mass transport (XPT) problems where an Eulerian PHE FEM is coupled to a Lagrangian XPT FEM using a custom-written FORTRAN program. The PHEXPT theoretical background is derived in the context of porous media transport theory and extended to ABAQUS finite element formulations. The essential assumptions needed in order to use ABAQUS are clearly identified in the derivation. Representative benchmark finite element simulations are provided along with analytical solutions (when appropriate). These simulations demonstrate the differences in transient and steady state responses including finite deformations, total stress, fluid pressure, relative fluid, and mobile species flux. A detailed description of important model considerations (e.g., material property functions and jump discontinuities at material interfaces) is also presented in the context of finite deformations. The ABAQUS-based PHEXPT approach enables the use of the available ABAQUS capabilities (interactive FEM mesh generation, finite element libraries, nonlinear material laws, pre- and postprocessing, etc.). PHEXPT FEMs can be used to simulate the transport of a relatively large neutral species (negligible osmotic fluid flux) in highly deformable hydrated soft tissues and tissue-engineered materials.\n\nFuselage Versus Subcomponent Panel Response Correlation Based on ABAQUS Explicit Progressive Damage Analysis Tools\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGould, Kevin E.; Satyanarayana, Arunkumar; Bogert, Philip B.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAnalysis performed in this study substantiates the need for high fidelity vehicle level progressive damage analyses (PDA) structural models for use in the verification and validation of proposed sub-scale structural models and to support required full-scale vehicle level testing. PDA results are presented that capture and correlate the responses of sub-scale 3-stringer and 7-stringer panel models and an idealized 8-ft diameter fuselage model, which provides a vehicle level environment for the 7-stringer sub-scale panel model. Two unique skin-stringer attachment assumptions are considered and correlated in the models analyzed: the TIE constraint interface versus the cohesive element (COH3D8) interface. Evaluating different interfaces allows for assessing a range of predicted damage modes, including delamination and crack propagation responses. Damage models considered in this study are the ABAQUS built-in Hashin procedure and the COmplete STress Reduction (COSTR) damage procedure implemented through a VUMAT user subroutine using the ABAQUS/Explicit code.\n\nSpectrally formulated user-defined element in Abaqus for wave motion analysis and health monitoring of composite structures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhalili, Ashkan\n\nWave propagation analysis in 1-D and 2-D composite structures is performed efficiently and accurately through the formulation of a User-Defined Element (UEL) based on the wavelet spectral finite element (WSFE) method. The WSFE method is based on the first order shear deformation theory which yields accurate results for wave motion at high frequencies. The wave equations are reduced to ordinary differential equations using Daubechies compactly supported, orthonormal, wavelet scaling functions for approximations in time and one spatial dimension. The 1-D and 2-D WSFE models are highly efficient computationally and provide a direct relationship between system input and output in the frequency domain. The UEL is formulated and implemented in Abaqus for wave propagation analysis in composite structures with complexities. Frequency domain formulation of WSFE leads to complex valued parameters, which are decoupled into real and imaginary parts and presented to Abaqus as real values. The final solution is obtained by forming a complex value using the real number solutions given by Abaqus. Several numerical examples are presented here for 1-D and 2-D composite waveguides. Wave motions predicted by the developed UEL correlate very well with Abaqus simulations using shear flexible elements. The results also show that the UEL largely retains computational efficiency of the WSFE method and extends its ability to model complex features. An enhanced cross-correlation method (ECCM) is developed in order to accurately predict damage location in plates. Three major modifications are proposed to the widely used cross-correlation method (CCM) to improve damage localization capabilities, namely actuator-sensor configuration, signal pre-processing method, and signal post-processing method. The ECCM is investigated numerically (FEM simulation) and experimentally. Experimental investigations for damage detection employ a PZT transducer as actuator and laser Doppler vibrometer as sensor\n\nAnalysis of SMA Hybrid Composite Structures in MSC.Nastran and ABAQUS\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTurner, Travis L.; Patel, Hemant D.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nA thermoelastic constitutive model for shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators and SMA hybrid composite (SMAHC) structures was recently implemented in the commercial finite element codes MSC.Nastran and ABAQUS. The model may be easily implemented in any code that has the capability for analysis of laminated composite structures with temperature dependent material properties. The model is also relatively easy to use and requires input of only fundamental engineering properties. A brief description of the model is presented, followed by discussion of implementation and usage in the commercial codes. Results are presented from static and dynamic analysis of SMAHC beams of two types; a beam clamped at each end and a cantilever beam. Nonlinear static (post-buckling) and random response analyses are demonstrated for the first specimen. Static deflection (shape) control is demonstrated for the cantilever beam. Approaches for modeling SMAHC material systems with embedded SMA in ribbon and small round wire product forms are demonstrated and compared. The results from the commercial codes are compared to those from a research code as validation of the commercial implementations; excellent correlation is achieved in all cases.\n\nUsing ABAQUS Scripting Interface for Materials Evaluation and Life Prediction\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPowers, Lynn M.; Arnold, Steven M.; Baranski, Andrzej\n\n2006-01-01\n\nAn ABAQUS script has been written to aid in the evaluation of the mechanical behavior of viscoplastic materials. The purposes of the script are to: handle complex load histories; control load/displacement with alternate stopping criteria; predict failure and life; and verify constitutive models. Material models from the ABAQUS library may be used or the UMAT routine may specify mechanical behavior. User subroutines implemented include: UMAT for the constitutive model; UEXTERNALDB for file manipulation; DISP for boundary conditions; and URDFIL for results processing. Examples presented include load, strain and displacement control tests on a single element model. The tests are creep with a life limiting strain criterion, strain control with a stress limiting cycle and a complex interrupted cyclic relaxation test. The techniques implemented in this paper enable complex load conditions to be solved efficiently with ABAQUS.\n\nEnhancing the ABAQUS Thermomechanics Code to Simulate Steady and Transient Fuel Rod Behavior\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nR.

Potential applications of these analysis results are also presented. The first section describes how software complexity analysis provides quantitative information on code, such as code structure and risk areas, throughout the software life cycle. Software complexity analysis allows an analyst to understand the software structure, identify critical software components, assess risk areas within a software system, identify testing deficiencies, and recommend program improvements. Performing this type of analysis during the early design phases of software development can positively affect the process, and may prevent later, much larger, difficulties. The second section describes how software reliability estimation and prediction analysis, or software reliability, provides a quantitative means to measure the probability of failure-free operation of a computer program, and describes the two tools used by JSC to determine failure rates and design tradeoffs between reliability, costs, performance, and schedule.\n\nLAMPAT and LAMPATNL User’s Manual\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-09-01\n\nnonlinearity.

Experimental data, from acceptance tests for 'Pad A' conducted at the Kansas City Plant (KCP), was used to calibrate the model. The data includes gap (relative displacement) and load measurements from three locations on the pad. Thirteen sets of data, from pads with different serial numbers, were provided.

The data was converted from gap and load to nominal (engineering) strain and nominal stress in order to implement it in Abaqus. Strain computations required initial pad thickness estimates.

However, easy and straight forward synergies between these analyses and tools rarely exist because of their stand-alone nature, their platform dependence, their different input and output formats and the variety of data to analyze. As a consequence, distributed and collaborative software analysiscollaborative software analysis scenarios and in particular interoperability are severely limited. We describe a distributed and collaborative software analysis platform that allows for a seamless interoperability of software analysis tools across platform, geographical and organizational boundaries. We realize software analysis tools as services that can be accessed and composed over the Internet. These distributed analysis services shall be widely accessible in our incrementally augmented Software Analysis Broker software analysis broker where organizations and tool providers can register and share their tools. To allow (semi-) automatic use and composition of these tools, they are classified and mapped into a software analysis taxonomy and adhere to specific meta-models and ontologiesontologies for their category of analysis.\n\nResearch on stress distribution regularity of cement sheaths of radial well based on ABAQUS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShi, Jihui; Cheng, Yuanfang; Li, Xiaolong; Xiao, Wen; Li, Menglai\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTo ensure desirable outcome of hydraulic fracturing based on ultra-short radius radial systems, it is required to investigate the stress distribution regularity and stability of the cement sheath. On the basis of the theoretical model of the cement sheath stress distribution, a reservoir mechanical model was built using the finite element software, ABAQUS, according to the physical property of a certain oil reservoir of the Shengli oilfield. The stress distribution of the casing-cement-sheath-formation system under the practical condition was simulated, based on which analyses were conducted from multiple points of view. Results show that the stress on the internal interface of the cement sheath exceeds that on the external interface, and fluctuates with higher amplitudes, which means that the internal interface is the most failure-prone. The unevenness of the cement sheath stress distribution grows with the increasing horizontal principal stress ratio, and so does the variation magnitude. This indicates that higher horizontal principal stress ratios are unfavourable for the structural stability of the cement sheath. Both the wellbore quantity of the URRS and the physical property of the material can affect the cement sheath distribution. It is suggested to optimize the quantity of the radial wellbore and use cement with a lower elastic modulus and higher Poissonâs ratio. At last, the impact level of the above factor was analysed, with the help of the grey correlation analysis.\n\nSimulation of Weld Mechanical Behavior to Include Welding-Induced Residual Stress and Distortion: Coupling of SYSWELD and Abaqus Codes\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-11-01\n\nMemorandum Simulation of Weld Mechanical Behavior to Include Welding -Induced Residual Stress and Distortion: Coupling of SYSWELD and Abaqus Codes...

Th e results were based on finite element analyses using ABAQUS# and ANSYS# and were calculated from the finite element results using the same post-processing routine to assure a consistent procedure. Mixed-mode strain energy release rates obtained from post-processing finite elem ent results were in good agreement for all element types used and all specimens modeled. Compared to previous studies, the models made of s olid twenty-node hexahedral elements and solid eight-node incompatible mode elements yielded excellent results. For both codes, models made of standard brick elements and elements with reduced integration did not correctly capture the distribution of the energy release rate acr oss the width of the specimens for the models chosen. The results suggested that element types with similar formulation yield matching results independent of the finite element software used. For comparison, m ixed-mode strain energy release rates were also calculated within ABAQUS#/Standard using the VCCT for ABAQUS# add on. For all specimens mod eled, mixed-mode strain energy release rates obtained from ABAQUS# finite element results using post-processing were almost identical to re sults calculated using the VCCT for ABAQUS# add on.\n\nStructural Technology Evaluation and Analysis Program (STEAP).

Dolphin cephalometric software greatly enhances the conduction of this analysis for orthodontic measurements. However, Dolphin is very expensive and cannot be afforded by many clinicians in developing countries. A suitable alternative software program in Farsi/English will greatly help Farsi speaking clinicians. The present study aimed to develop an affordable Iranian cephalometric analysis software program and compare it with Dolphin, the standard software available on the market for cephalometric analysis. In this diagnostic, descriptive study, 150 lateral cephalograms of normal occlusion individuals were selected in Mashhad and Qazvin, two major cities of Iran mainly populated with Fars ethnicity, the main Iranian ethnic group. After tracing the cephalograms, the McNamara analysis standards were measured both with Dolphin and the new software. The cephalometric software was designed using Microsoft Visual C++ program in Windows XP. Measurements made with the new software were compared with those of Dolphin software on both series of cephalograms. The validity and reliability were tested using intra-class correlation coefficient. Calculations showed a very high correlation between the results of the Iranian cephalometric analysis software and Dolphin. This confirms the validity and optimal efficacy of the newly designed software (ICC 0.570-1.0). According to our results, the newly designed software has acceptable validity and reliability and can be used for orthodontic diagnosis, treatment planning and assessment of treatment outcome.\n\nSpectrally formulated user-defined element in conventional finite element environment for wave motion analysis in 2-D composite structures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhalili, Ashkan; Jha, Ratneshwar; Samaratunga, Dulip\n\n2016-11-01\n\nWave propagation analysis in 2-D composite structures is performed efficiently and accurately through the formulation of a User-Defined Element (UEL) based on the wavelet spectral finite element (WSFE) method. The WSFE method is based on the first-order shear deformation theory which yields accurate results for wave motion at high frequencies. The 2-D WSFE model is highly efficient computationally and provides a direct relationship between system input and output in the frequency domain. The UEL is formulated and implemented in Abaqus (commercial finite element software) for wave propagation analysis in 2-D composite structures with complexities. Frequency domain formulation of WSFE leads to complex valued parameters, which are decoupled into real and imaginary parts and presented to Abaqus as real values. The final solution is obtained by forming a complex value using the real number solutions given by Abaqus. Five numerical examples are presented in this article, namely undamaged plate, impacted plate, plate with ply drop, folded plate and plate with stiffener. Wave motions predicted by the developed UEL correlate very well with Abaqus simulations. The results also show that the UEL largely retains computational efficiency of the WSFE method and extends its ability to model complex features.\n\nSoftware Reliability Analysis of NASA Space Flight Software: A Practical Experience\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSukhwani, Harish; Alonso, Javier; Trivedi, Kishor S.; Mcginnis, Issac\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we present the software reliability analysis of the flight software of a recently launched space mission. For our analysis, we use the defect reports collected during the flight software development. We find that this software was developed in multiple releases, each release spanning across all software life-cycle phases. We also find that the software releases were developed and tested for four different hardware platforms, spanning from off-the-shelf or emulation hardware to actual flight hardware. For releases that exhibit reliability growth or decay, we fit Software Reliability Growth Models (SRGM); otherwise we fit a distribution function. We find that most releases exhibit reliability growth, with Log-Logistic (NHPP) and S-Shaped (NHPP) as the best-fit SRGMs. For the releases that experience reliability decay, we investigate the causes for the same. We find that such releases were the first software releases to be tested on a new hardware platform, and hence they encountered major hardware integration issues. Also such releases seem to have been developed under time pressure in order to start testing on the new hardware platform sooner. Such releases exhibit poor reliability growth, and hence exhibit high predicted failure rate. Other problems include hardware specification changes and delivery delays from vendors. Thus, our analysis provides critical insights and inputs to the management to improve the software development process. As NASA has moved towards a product line engineering for its flight software development, software for future space missions will be developed in a similar manner and hence the analysis results for this mission can be considered as a baseline for future flight software missions.

Data collection is no longer limited to paper-and-pencil format, and numerous methods are now available through Internet and electronic resources. With these techniques, researchers are not burdened with entering data manually and data analysis is facilitated by software programs. Quantitative research is supported by the use of computer software and provides ease in the management of large data sets and rapid analysis of numeric statistical methods. New technologies are emerging to support qualitative research with the availability of computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS).CAQDAS will be presented with a discussion of advantages, limitations, controversial issues, and recommendations for this type of software use.\n\nAnalysis Software\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1994-01-01\n\nGeneral Purpose Boundary Element Solution Technology (GPBEST) software employs the boundary element method of mechanical engineering analysis, as opposed to finite element. It is, according to one of its developers, 10 times faster in data preparation and more accurate than other methods. Its use results in less expensive products because the time between design and manufacturing is shortened. A commercial derivative of a NASA-developed computer code, it is marketed by Best Corporation to solve problems in stress analysis, heat transfer, fluid analysis and yielding and cracking of solids. Other applications include designing tractor and auto parts, household appliances and acoustic analysis.\n\nNext generation lightweight mirror modeling software\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArnold, William R.; Fitzgerald, Matthew; Rosa, Rubin Jaca; Stahl, H.

Software safety practitioners need to ensure that software related hazards are completely identified, controlled, and tracked. This paper discusses in detail how to incorporate the traditional reliability techniques into the entire software safety analysis process. In addition, this paper addresses how information can be effectively shared between the various practitioners involved in the software safety analyses. The author has successfully applied the approach to several aerospace applications. Examples are provided to illustrate the key steps of the proposed approach.\n\nSMAUMAT_ITI\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nJannetti, C.; Becker, R.\n\nThe software is an ABAQUS/Standard UMAT (user defined material behavior subroutine) that implements the constitutive model for shape-memory alloy materials developed by Jannetti et. al.

Semantic metrics represent a more human-oriented view of software than do syntactic metrics. The semantic metrics of a given computer program are calculated by use of the output of a knowledge-based analysis of the program, and are substantially more representative of software quality and more readily comprehensible from a human perspective than are the syntactic metrics.\n\nStandardizing Activation Analysis: New Software for Photon Activation Analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSun, Z. J.; Wells, D.; Segebade, C.; Green, J.\n\n2011-06-01\n\nPhoton Activation Analysis (PAA) of environmental, archaeological and industrial samples requires extensive data analysis that is susceptible to error. For the purpose of saving time, manpower and minimizing error, a computer program was designed, built and implemented using SQL, Access 2007 and asp.net technology to automate this process. Based on the peak information of the spectrum and assisted by its PAA library, the program automatically identifies elements in the samples and calculates their concentrations and respective uncertainties. The software also could be operated in browser/server mode, which gives the possibility to use it anywhere the internet is accessible. By switching the nuclide library and the related formula behind, the new software can be easily expanded to neutron activation analysis (NAA), charged particle activation analysis (CPAA) or proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE). Implementation of this would standardize the analysis of nuclear activation data. Results from this software were compared to standard PAA analysis with excellent agreement. With minimum input from the user, the software has proven to be fast, user-friendly and reliable.\n\nKubios HRV--heart rate variability analysis software.\n\nPubMed\n\nTarvainen, Mika P; Niskanen, Juha-Pekka; Lipponen, Jukka A; Ranta-Aho, Perttu O; Karjalainen, Pasi A\n\n2014-01-01\n\nKubios HRV is an advanced and easy to use software for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The software supports several input data formats for electrocardiogram (ECG) data and beat-to-beat RR interval data. It includes an adaptive QRS detection algorithm and tools for artifact correction, trend removal and analysis sample selection. The software computes all the commonly used time-domain and frequency-domain HRV parameters and several nonlinear parameters. There are several adjustable analysis settings through which the analysis methods can be optimized for different data. The ECG derived respiratory frequency is also computed, which is important for reliable interpretation of the analysis results.

The material model is an elasto-plasticity model in which the yield strength depends on pressure. Both the elastic properties and the yield stress are estimated by fitting a line to the elastic region of each test response. The model parameters are fit to the data (in a non-rigorous way) to provide both a conservative and not-conservative material model. ThemoreÂ Â» model is verified to perform as intended by comparing the values of pressure and shear stress at yield, as well as the shear and volumetric stress-strain response, to the test data.Â«Â less\n\nNumerical Analysis of Deflections of Multi-Layered Beams\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBiliÅski, Tadeusz; Socha, Tomasz\n\n2015-03-01\n\nThe paper concerns the rheological bending problem of wooden beams reinforced with embedded composite bars. A theoretical model of the behaviour of a multi-layered beam is presented. The component materials of this beam are described with equations for the linear viscoelastic five-parameter rheological model. Two numerical analysis methods for the long-term response of wood structures are presented. The first method has been developed with SCILAB software. The second one has been developed with the finite element calculation software ABAQUS and user subroutine UMAT. Laboratory investigations were conducted on sample beams of natural dimensions in order to validate the proposed theoretical model and verify numerical simulations.

ST-SIZE was chiefly conceived as a means to improve and speed the structural design of a future aerospace plane for Langley Hypersonic Vehicles Office. Including the NASA computer code into HyperSizer has enabled the company to also apply the software to applications other than aerospace, including improved design and construction for offices, marine structures, cargo containers, commercial and military aircraft, rail cars, and a host of everyday consumer products.\n\nAcoustic Emission Analysis Applet (AEAA) Software\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNichols, Charles T.; Roth, Don J.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nNASA Glenn Research and NASA White Sands Test Facility have developed software supporting an automated pressure vessel structural health monitoring (SHM) system based on acoustic emissions (AE). The software, referred to as the Acoustic Emission Analysis Applet (AEAA), provides analysts with a tool that can interrogate data collected on Digital Wave Corp. and Physical Acoustics Corp. software using a wide spectrum of powerful filters and charts. This software can be made to work with any data once the data format is known. The applet will compute basic AE statistics, and statistics as a function of time and pressure (see figure). AEAA provides value added beyond the analysis provided by the respective vendors' analysis software. The software can handle data sets of unlimited size. A wide variety of government and commercial applications could benefit from this technology, notably requalification and usage tests for compressed gas and hydrogen-fueled vehicles. Future enhancements will add features similar to a \"check engine\" light on a vehicle. Once installed, the system will ultimately be used to alert International Space Station crewmembers to critical structural instabilities, but will have little impact to missions otherwise. Diagnostic information could then be transmitted to experienced technicians on the ground in a timely manner to determine whether pressure vessels have been impacted, are structurally unsound, or can be safely used to complete the mission.\n\nThe finite element simulation analysis research of 38CrSi cylindrical power spinning\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiang, Wei; Lv, Qiongying; Zhao, Yujuan; Lv, Yunxia\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn order to grope for the influence of the main cylindrical spinning process parameters on the spinning process, this paper combines with real tube power spinning process and uses ABAQUS finite element analysis software to simulate the tube power spinning process of 38CrSi steel materials, through the analysis of the stress, strain of the part forming process, analyzes the influence of the thickness reduction and the feed rate to the forming process, and analyzes the variation of the spinning force, finally determines the reasonable main spinning process parameters combination.\n\nGWAMA: software for genome-wide association meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMÃ¤gi, Reedik; Morris, Andrew P\n\n2010-05-28\n\nDespite the recent success of genome-wide association studies in identifying novel loci contributing effects to complex human traits, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, much of the genetic component of variation in these phenotypes remains unexplained. One way to improving power to detect further novel loci is through meta-analysis of studies from the same population, increasing the sample size over any individual study. Although statistical software analysis packages incorporate routines for meta-analysis, they are ill equipped to meet the challenges of the scale and complexity of data generated in genome-wide association studies. We have developed flexible, open-source software for the meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. The software incorporates a variety of error trapping facilities, and provides a range of meta-analysis summary statistics. The software is distributed with scripts that allow simple formatting of files containing the results of each association study and generate graphical summaries of genome-wide meta-analysis results. The GWAMA (Genome-Wide Association Meta-Analysis) software has been developed to perform meta-analysis of summary statistics generated from genome-wide association studies of dichotomous phenotypes or quantitative traits.

The software calculates the teleroentgenogram by the original method which was developed in this medical department. Program allows designing its own methods for calculating the teleroentgenograms by new methods. It is planned to use the technology of machine learning (Neural networks) in the software. This will help to make the process of calculating the teleroentgenograms easier because methodological points will be placed automatically.\n\nModeling viscoelastic deformation of the earth due to surface loading by commercial finite element package - ABAQUS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKit Wong, Ching; Wu, Patrick\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWu (2004) developed a transformation scheme to model viscoelatic deformation due to glacial loading by commercial finite element package - ABAQUS. Benchmark tests confirmed that this method works extremely well on incompressible earth model. Bangtsson & Lund (2008),however, showed that the transformation scheme would lead to incorrect results if compressible material parameters are used. Their study implies that Wu's method of stress transformation is inadequate to model the load induced deformation of a compressible earth under the framework of ABAQUS. In light of this, numerical experiments are carried out to find if there exist other methods that serve this purpose. All the tested methods are not satisfying as the results failed to converge through iterations, except at the elastic limit. Those tested methods will be outlined and the results will be presented. Possible reasons of failure will also be discussed. BÃ¤ngtsson, E., & Lund, B. (2008).

To assess the feasibility of using the identical seal design for the Upper Stage as was used for the Space Shuttle External Tank manhole covers, a preliminary seal deflection analysis using the ABAQUS commercial finite element software is employed. The ABAQUS analyses are performed using three-dimensional symmetric wedge finite element models. This analysis technique is validated by first modeling a heritage External Tank liquid hydrogen tank manhole cover joint and correlating the results to heritage test data. Once the technique is validated, the Upper Stage configuration is modeled. The Upper Stage analyses are performed at 1.4 times the expected pressure to comply with the Constellation Program factor of safety requirement on joint separation. Results from the analyses performed with the External Tank and Upper Stage models demonstrate the effects of several modeling assumptions on the seal deflection. The analyses for Upper Stage show that the integrity of the seal is successfully maintained.\n\nDebugging and Performance Analysis Software Tools for Peregrine System |\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nHigh-Performance Computing | NREL Debugging and Performance Analysis Software Tools for Peregrine System Debugging and Performance Analysis Software Tools for Peregrine System Learn about debugging and performance analysis software tools available to use with the Peregrine system.

The new software will replace CALC/SOLVE and many related utility programs. It will have the capabilities of the current system as well as incorporate new models and data analysis techniques. In this paper we give a conceptual overview of the new software. We formulate the main goals of the software. The software should be flexible and modular to implement models and estimation techniques that currently exist or will appear in future. On the other hand it should be reliable and possess production quality for processing standard VLBI sessions. Also, it needs to be capable of processing observations from a fully deployed network of VLBI2010 stations in a reasonable time. We describe the software development process and outline the software architecture.\n\nTheoretical and software considerations for nonlinear dynamic analysis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchmidt, R. J.; Dodds, R. H., Jr.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nIn the finite element method for structural analysis, it is generally necessary to discretize the structural model into a very large number of elements to accurately evaluate displacements, strains, and stresses. As the complexity of the model increases, the number of degrees of freedom can easily exceed the capacity of present-day software system. Improvements of structural analysis software including more efficient use of existing hardware and improved structural modeling techniques are discussed. One modeling technique that is used successfully in static linear and nonlinear analysis is multilevel substructuring. This research extends the use of multilevel substructure modeling to include dynamic analysis and defines the requirements for a general purpose software system capable of efficient nonlinear dynamic analysis. The multilevel substructuring technique is presented, the analytical formulations and computational procedures for dynamic analysis and nonlinear mechanics are reviewed, and an approach to the design and implementation of a general purpose structural software system is presented.\n\nACES: Space shuttle flight software analysis expert system\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSatterwhite, R. Scott\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe Analysis Criteria Evaluation System (ACES) is a knowledge based expert system that automates the final certification of the Space Shuttle onboard flight software. Guidance, navigation and control of the Space Shuttle through all its flight phases are accomplished by a complex onboard flight software system. This software is reconfigured for each flight to allow thousands of mission-specific parameters to be introduced and must therefore be thoroughly certified prior to each flight. This certification is performed in ground simulations by executing the software in the flight computers. Flight trajectories from liftoff to landing, including abort scenarios, are simulated and the results are stored for analysis. The current methodology of performing this analysis is repetitive and requires many man-hours. The ultimate goals of ACES are to capture the knowledge of the current experts and improve the quality and reduce the manpower required to certify the Space Shuttle onboard flight software.\n\nFinite element Analysis of Semi-Grouting Sleeve Connection Member Based on ABAQUS\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBao, Longsheng; Fan, Qianyu; Wang, Ling\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThis paper use investigates the force transfer mechanism and failure form of semi-grouting sleeve members under axial load, analyze the weak points of structural bearing capacity and verify the reliability of the connection of steel bars through finite element analysis software. The results show that adding the axial load to semi-grouting sleeve forms a 45Â°oblique compression zone, which help to transfer stress between reinforcement, grouting material and sleeve. Because the maximum stress of sleeve doesnât reach its tensile resistance and the deformation of the sleeve is located at the junction of the grouting and the threaded section when the stress value of steel bars at each end of the semi-grouting sleeve reach its ultimate tensile strength, we conclude that the semi-grouting sleeve members can meet the construction quality requirements and be used to connect the steel bars at the joints of the assembled structures. It is necessary to avoid breaking down, since the deformation section will accumulate large plastic deformation during the processing of the sleeve.\n\nPIV/HPIV Film Analysis Software Package\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBlackshire, James L.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nA PIV/HPIV film analysis software system was developed that calculates the 2-dimensional spatial autocorrelations of subregions of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) or Holographic Particle Image Velocimetry (HPIV) film recordings. The software controls three hardware subsystems including (1) a Kodak Megaplus 1.4 camera and EPIX 4MEG framegrabber subsystem, (2) an IEEE/Unidex 11 precision motion control subsystem, and (3) an Alacron I860 array processor subsystem. The software runs on an IBM PC/AT host computer running either the Microsoft Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 operating system. It is capable of processing five PIV or HPIV displacement vectors per second, and is completely automated with the exception of user input to a configuration file prior to analysis execution for update of various system parameters.\n\nFour applications of a software data collection and analysis methodology\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBasili, Victor R.; Selby, Richard W., Jr.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe evaluation of software technologies suffers because of the lack of quantitative assessment of their effect on software development and modification. A seven-step data collection and analysis methodology couples software technology evaluation with software measurement. Four in-depth applications of the methodology are presented. The four studies represent each of the general categories of analyses on the software product and development process: blocked subject-project studies, replicated project studies, multi-project variation studies, and single project strategies. The four applications are in the areas of, respectively, software testing, cleanroom software development, characteristic software metric sets, and software error analysis.\n\nSoftware Users Manual (SUM): Extended Testability Analysis (ETA) Tool\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMaul, William A.; Fulton, Christopher E.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis software user manual describes the implementation and use the Extended Testability Analysis (ETA) Tool. The ETA Tool is a software program that augments the analysis and reporting capabilities of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) testability analysis software package called the Testability Engineering And Maintenance System (TEAMS) Designer. An initial diagnostic assessment is performed by the TEAMS Designer software using a qualitative, directed-graph model of the system being analyzed. The ETA Tool utilizes system design information captured within the diagnostic model and testability analysis output from the TEAMS Designer software to create a series of six reports for various system engineering needs. The ETA Tool allows the user to perform additional studies on the testability analysis results by determining the detection sensitivity to the loss of certain sensors or tests. The ETA Tool was developed to support design and development of the NASA Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle. The diagnostic analysis provided by the ETA Tool was proven to be valuable system engineering output that provided consistency in the verification of system engineering requirements. This software user manual provides a description of each output report generated by the ETA Tool. The manual also describes the example diagnostic model and supporting documentation - also provided with the ETA Tool software release package - that were used to generate the reports presented in the manual\n\nIntroducing a New Software for Geodetic Analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHjelle, G. A.; DÃ¤hnn, M.; Fausk, I.; Kirkvik, A. S.; Mysen, E.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAt the Norwegian Mapping Authority, we are currently developing Where, a newsoftware for geodetic analysis. Where is built on our experiences with theGeosat software, and will be able to analyse and combine data from VLBI, SLR,GNSS and DORIS. The software is mainly written in Python which has proved veryfruitful. The code is quick to write and the architecture is easily extendableand maintainable. The Python community provides a rich eco-system of tools fordoing data-analysis, including effective data storage and powerfulvisualization. Python interfaces well with other languages so that we can easilyreuse existing, well-tested code like the SOFA and IERS libraries. This presentation will show some of the current capabilities of Where,including benchmarks against other software packages. In addition we will reporton some simple investigations we have done using the software, and outline ourplans for further progress.\n\nAn online database for plant image analysis software tools.\n\nPubMed\n\nLobet, Guillaume; Draye, Xavier; PÃ©rilleux, Claire\n\n2013-10-09\n\nRecent years have seen an increase in methods for plant phenotyping using image analyses. These methods require new software solutions for data extraction and treatment. These solutions are instrumental in supporting various research pipelines, ranging from the localisation of cellular compounds to the quantification of tree canopies. However, due to the variety of existing tools and the lack of central repository, it is challenging for researchers to identify the software that is best suited for their research. We present an online, manually curated, database referencing more than 90 plant image analysis software solutions. The website, plant-image-analysis.org, presents each software in a uniform and concise manner enabling users to identify the available solutions for their experimental needs. The website also enables user feedback, evaluations and new software submissions. The plant-image-analysis.org database provides an overview of existing plant image analysis software. The aim of such a toolbox is to help users to find solutions, and to provide developers a way to exchange and communicate about their work.\n\nApplication of Dynamic Analysis in Semi-Analytical Finite Element Method\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOeser, Markus\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAnalyses of dynamic responses are significantly important for the design, maintenance and rehabilitation of asphalt pavement. In order to evaluate the dynamic responses of asphalt pavement under moving loads, a specific computational program, SAFEM, was developed based on a semi-analytical finite element method. This method is three-dimensional and only requires a two-dimensional FE discretization by incorporating Fourier series in the third dimension. In this paper, the algorithm to apply the dynamic analysis to SAFEM was introduced in detail. Asphalt pavement models under moving loads were built in the SAFEM and commercial finite element software ABAQUS to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the SAFEM. The verification shows that the computational accuracy of SAFEM is high enough and its computational time is much shorter than ABAQUS. Moreover, experimental verification was carried out and the prediction derived from SAFEM is consistent with the measurement. Therefore, the SAFEM is feasible to reliably predict the dynamic response of asphalt pavement under moving loads, thus proving beneficial to road administration in assessing the pavementâs state.

Quantitative analysis of radiotherapy data can improve the success of the treatment and support the prediction of outcome. In this paper, we first identify functional, conceptional and general requirements on a software system for quantitative analysis of radiotherapy. Further we present an overview of existing radiotherapy analysis software tools and check them against the stated requirements. As none of them could meet all of the demands presented herein, we analyzed possible conceptional problems and present software design solutions and recommendations to meet the stated requirements (e.g. algorithmic decoupling via dose iterator pattern; analysis database design). As a proof of concept we developed a software library \"RTToolbox\" following the presented design principles. The RTToolbox is available as open source library and has already been tested in a larger-scale software system for different use cases. These examples demonstrate the benefit of the presented design principles. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Many of these computers will control physical objects and processes. Such hidden computerized environments introduce new safety and correctness concerns whose treatment go beyond present Formal Methods. In particular, one has to begin to speak about Real Space software in analogy with Real Time software. By this we mean, computerized systems which have to meet requirements expressed in the real geometry of space. How to translate such requirements into ordinary software specifications and how to carry out proofs is a major challenge. In this talk we propose a research program based on the use of no-standard analysis. Much detail remains to be carried out. The purpose of the talk is to inform the Formal Methods community that Non-Standard Analysis provides a possible avenue to attack which we believe will be fruitful.\n\nOff-the-shelf Control of Data Analysis Software\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWampler, S.\n\nThe Gemini Project must provide convenient access to data analysis facilities to a wide user community. The international nature of this community makes the selection of data analysis software particularly interesting, with staunch advocates of systems such as ADAM and IRAF among the users. Additionally, the continuing trends towards increased use of networked systems and distributed processing impose additional complexity. To meet these needs, the Gemini Project is proposing the novel approach of using low-cost, off-the-shelf software to abstract out both the control and distribution of data analysis from the functionality of the data analysis software. For example, the orthogonal nature of control versus function means that users might select analysis routines from both ADAM and IRAF as appropriate, distributing these routines across a network of machines. It is the belief of the Gemini Project that this approach results in a system that is highly flexible, maintainable, and inexpensive to develop. The Khoros visualization system is presented as an example of control software that is currently available for providing the control and distribution within a data analysis system. The visual programming environment provided with Khoros is also discussed as a means to providing convenient access to this control.\n\nLandscape analysis software tools\n\nTreesearch\n\nDon Vandendriesche\n\n2008-01-01\n\nRecently, several new computer programs have been developed to assist in landscape analysis.

On layer orientation 0Â°,30Â°,45Â°,60Â° and 90Â° with layer number 10 and layer thickness 2 mm, the purpose of this study was to determine the strength of fiberglass that was influenced by the orientation of the layer, and to determine the orientation of fiberglass layer before making. This method used Finite Element Analysis method using ABAQUS, with homogenous and heterogeneous layer parameters. The simulation result shows the difference in von misses value at an angle of 0Â°, 30Â°, 45Â°,60Â° homogeneous value is greater than heterogeneous value, whereas in orientation 90 heterogeneous values have value 1,689e9 Pa, greater than homogenous 90 orientation value of 1,296e9 Pa.\n\nAnalysis of Software Systems for Specialized Computers,\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\ncomputer) with given computer hardware and software .

P.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nDuring the heat treatment by quenching in a liquid medium the convective heat transfer coefficient plays a crucial role in the extraction of heat. The heat extraction ultimately influences the cooling rate and hence the hardness and mechanical properties. A Finite Element analysis of quenching a simple flat copper sample with different orientation of sample and with different quenchant temperatures were carried out to check and verify the results obtained from the experiments. The heat transfer coefficient (HTC) was calculated from temperature history in a simple flat copper disc sample experimentally. This HTC data was further used as input to simulation software and the cooling curves were back calculated. The results obtained from software and using experimentation shows nearly consistent values.\n\nAutomated Software Vulnerability Analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSezer, Emre C.; Kil, Chongkyung; Ning, Peng\n\nDespite decades of research, software continues to have vulnerabilities. Successful exploitations of these vulnerabilities by attackers cost millions of dollars to businesses and individuals. Unfortunately, most effective defensive measures, such as patching and intrusion prevention systems, require an intimate knowledge of the vulnerabilities. Many systems for detecting attacks have been proposed. However, the analysis of the exploited vulnerabilities is left to security experts and programmers. Both the human effortinvolved and the slow analysis process are unfavorable for timely defensive measure to be deployed. The problem is exacerbated by zero-day attacks.\n\nBoundary condition identification for a grid model by experimental and numerical dynamic analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMao, Qiang; Devitis, John; Mazzotti, Matteo; Bartoli, Ivan; Moon, Franklin; Sjoblom, Kurt; Aktan, Emin\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThere is a growing need to characterize unknown foundations and assess substructures in existing bridges. It is becoming an important issue for the serviceability and safety of bridges as well as for the possibility of partial reuse of existing infrastructures. Within this broader contest, this paper investigates the possibility of identifying, locating and quantifying changes of boundary conditions, by leveraging a simply supported grid structure with a composite deck. Multi-reference impact tests are operated for the grid model and modification of one supporting bearing is done by replacing a steel cylindrical roller with a roller of compliant material. Impact based modal analysis provide global modal parameters such as damped natural frequencies, mode shapes and flexibility matrix that are used as indicators of boundary condition changes. An updating process combining a hybrid optimization algorithm and the finite element software suit ABAQUS is presented in this paper. The updated ABAQUS model of the grid that simulates the supporting bearing with springs is used to detect and quantify the change of the boundary conditions.\n\nFunRich proteomics software analysis, let the fun begin!\n\nPubMed\n\nBenito-Martin, Alberto; Peinado, HÃ©ctor\n\n2015-08-01\n\nProtein MS analysis is the preferred method for unbiased protein identification.
