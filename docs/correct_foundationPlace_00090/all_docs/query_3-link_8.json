        "text": "After teaching 1000’s of students and writing about SOLIDWORKS for over 25 years, David Planchard, emeritus WPI, is exploring SOLIDWORKS desktop and the integrated 3DEXPERIENCE Platform. Through the 3DEXPERIENCE Works Lesson series, David helps educators understand the 3DEXPERIENCE Engineer, Plastics Injection App with simple examples and industry practices. The Platform offers are available thru your Education Partner (VAR).\n\nSIMULIA apps provide a full spectrum of solutions that enable you to simulate the behavior of your designs in a Multi-physics modeling environment. These apps span a scalable portfolio of finite element analysis solutions that include simulating structural, thermal, and fluid dynamics problems.\n\nIn this lesson, simulate the injection molding of a part made from a single material using the Plastic Injection App on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.\n\nOpen the part in SOLIDWORKS. Save the part in your Collaborative space using an existing Bookmark. Return to your SOLIDWORKS desktop. Lock the part. Apply the Plastic Injection App. Create the FE Model or FEM.\n\nAssign the appropriate domains to the geometries that contribute to the molding simulation. Note: A domain must be assigned to all geometries that contribute to the simulation.\n\nApply Polycarbonate material. The material you select must have the Injection molding behavior specified in their simulation domains.\n\nDefine the process settings. Modify the Fill Rate Profile and Pack Switch point.\n\nDefine the injection point on the back of the model. Mesh the Switch Plate.\n\nRun the Simulation study. Use the Physics Results Explorer App. Note: The Simulation should take approximately 6 – 7 minutes using 4 CPU cores.\n\nView the created simulations: Fill, Pack + Cool and Warp. Analyze various simulation contour plots. Create an animation of the Warp Simulation – Total Displacement contour plot. Save the study. Close the study.\n\nBefore we start, there are a few items that you need to know.\n\nIn this lesson, use your default Collaborative space. A 3DEXPERIENCE ID is required.\n\nThe Simulation lesson provides a foundation to users who are new to using simulation to solve real-world engineering and design problems. Before you use the Plastic Injection App, you must define all required parts. For example, you must have a model of the part cavity defined as a single solid part. If you plan to simulate the temperature distribution in the mold, you must also define any mold cooling lines as solid parts. You can use the Functional Plastic or Mold Tooling Design Apps to create these parts.\n\nThe Switch Plate part has been updated from the SOLIDWORKS Plastics tutorials to use with the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.\n\nLaunch the Platform and SOLIDWORKS\n\n3DEXPERIENCE Launcher needs to be installed. 3DEXPERIENCE Works Lesson 1: Getting Started with SOLIDWORKS.\n\nThe 3DEXPERIENCE platform is browser driven. Your existing cookies and cache determine what you will see on your computer desktop or during a SOLIDWORKS login. A full installation of SOLIDWORKS 2019 SP0 or later is required.\n\nStart a SOLIDWORKS session from your desktop.\n\nDouble-click the SOLIDWORKS icon.\n\nView the illustration below. Depending on your system setup, cookies, and cache, it will be different.

Save the part to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.\n\nClick Save Active Window from the Lifecycle tab in the Action bar. Note: You can also right-click Switch Plate in MySession, and click Save with Options.\n\nThe file is temporarily being saved to a local cache area. The platform is checking for out-of-date components, modified components from the last save to the platform, different revisions, missing components, etc.\n\nThe Save to 3DEXPERIENCE dialog box is displayed. Product lifecycle management (PLM) attributes are displayed. The PLM attributes include: Bookmark locations, Selected Collaborative space, Owner, Title, Saved Status (3DEXPERIENCE), Revision, Maturity Lifecycle State and Collaborative Space name.\n\nSave the part. Use your existing Collaborative space. Use an existing Bookmark. Note: If needed review 3DEXPERIENCE Works Lesson 3: SOLIDWORKS Bookmarks, Share and Delete. Use Bookmarks (links) to delete entire groups of data or just a single file. For assemblies within the Bookmark folder, there is an option to delete the entire structure of the assembly and all reference components.\n\nClick the Select Bookmark down arrow.\n\nClick Select Bookmark. The Select a Bookmark dialog box is displayed.\n\nIn the below example, I selected Design Project 104 as my bookmark.\n\nClick Apply from the Select a Bookmark dialog box.\n\nClick Save from the Save to 3DEXPERIENCE dialog box.\n\nThe part is directly loaded into your Collaborative space and Bookmarked on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. You are returned back into your SOLIDWORKS desktop session.\n\nView the Status column in the updated MySession panel. The Status icon displays a green check mark. This means that the current file on your SOLIDWORKS desktop is updated and saved to the platform. The default Revision is A. The Maturity State is “In Work”. This is the default Lifecycle state after you saved the model to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.\n\nLock the part in the MySession panel. This prevents anyone in making a change to the part.\n\nRight-click the part name.\n\nClick Lock. The part is locked.\n\nSelect the Switch Plate from the MySession panel.\n\nClick the center of the Compass. Use the Plastic Injection App. Think of this App as the SOLIDWORKS Flow Simulation Add-in inside of SOLIDWORKS.

Currently, the Educational version has a maximum allowable node count of 1million nodes with up to 4 physical cores are supported.\n\nView the Quality Analysis of the Surface Triangle Mesh.1.\n\nRight-click Surface Triangle Mesh.1.\n\nClick Quality Analysis from the drop-down menu.\n\nThe Quality Report dialog box is displayed.\n\nExplore the Quality, Connectivity, and Failed Criteria tabs.\n\nReturn back to the Plastic Mesh Part Manager dialog box.\n\nClose the Quality Report dialog box.\n\nClose the Plastic Mesh Part Manager dialog box.\n\nSimulate Fill, Pack + Cool and Warp\n\nRun the simulation.\n\nClick Simulate from the Assistant dialog box.\n\nClick Simulate from the Commands box. Note: You can also select Simulate from the Results tab in the Action bar.\n\nThe Simulate dialog box is displayed.\n\nRun the Simulation using Local interactive. Local interactive is set by default using an embedded license. The Simulation is excuted on your computer and the user interface is locked while the Simulation is in process.\n\nWith an Educational license, up to 4 physical cores are supported. Select All is the default option. Note: The Simulation should take approximately 6 – 7 minutes using 4 CPU cores.\n\nClick OK from the Simulate dialog box.\n\nThe Simulation Status dialog is display.\n\nWhen finished, click Close.\n\nView the created simulations: Fill, Pack + Cool and Warp.\n\nClose the second Simulation Status box.\n\nView Results\n\nView the results in the Graphics area. The default contour plot is Fill time. The Fill time plot displays the time when the plastic flow front reaches each point in the model. The portion of the Switch Plate that is filled with plastic last is the furthest from the injection location.\n\nView the Result folder.\n\nGenerate contour plots for the Pack Simulation.\n\nReview the pressure at the end of the Pack analysis case.\n\nSelect Pack + Cool Simulation from the Step drop-down menu as illustrated.\n\nSelect Pressure at end of Pack from the Plot drop-down menu.\n\nView the results. During the pack stage, the injection molding machine applies additional pressure to the molten plastic to add more polymer material into the filled cavity. The additional pressure compensates for part shrinkage and reduces the occurrence of external sink marks.\n\nReview the temperature at the end of Pack analysis case.\n\nSelect Temperature at end of Pack from the Plot drop-down menu.\n\nClick a point on the model as illustrated. The mouse cursor automatically acts as a probe. View the temperature at that point. A Pop-up menu is displayed.\n\nClick the Show Min/Max Values icon from the Pop-up menu. View the results.\n\nView the Global Max temperature at end of Plot (injection point).\n\nClick the Hide Max or Min values and close icon from the Pop-up menu.\n\nGenerate a contour plot for the Warp Simulation.\n\nSelect Warp Simulation from the Step drop-down menu.\n\nSelect Displacement, total from the Plot drop-down menu.\n\nThe largest displacement due to warp occurs at the corners of the plate. Warp occurs because of the stresses that develop during the Fill and Pack stages of the injection molding process, as well as the stresses that develop as the material contracts during cooling.\n\nEdit the deformation scale of the displacement plot to view the deformed shape of the Switch Plate in true scale.\n\nClick a point on the Switch Plate. A Pop-up menu is displayed.\n\nClick the Plot options icon from the Pop-up menu.\n\nThe Contour Plot dialog box is displayed.\n\nEnter 1 for Scale factor.\n\nClick OK from the Contour Plot dialog box.\n\nDisplay an Isometric view of the Switch Plate.\n\nAnimate Displacement\n\nCreate an animation of the current contour plot (Warp Simulation – Displacement, total).\n\nClick the Play Animation icon from the Results tab in the Action bar.\n\nView the animation.\n\nClick the Stop and Rewind icon.\n\nSave the animation.\n\nClick the Options icon.\n\nThe Animation Options dialog box is displayed.\n\nClick the Save video icon.\n\nClick the Open to choose browser location icon.\n\nSelect file location and name.\n\nClick Save from the Animation Options dialog box.\n\nClose the Animation Options dialog box.\n\nClose the Player.\n\nClick Exit from the Player tab in the Action bar.\n\nSave and Close\n\nSave the Simulation study (Model, Scenario, and Result).\n\nClick the Share icon as illustrated.\n\nClick Save.\n\nClose the Simulation study.\n\nClick Close on the Physics Simulation tab.\n\nThe lesson is finished.\n\nCommunity\n\nAcademic Community: After you create a 3DEXPERIENCE ID, Educators, can get more information on xDesign and SOLIDWORKS.
