Cowen of Arizona, a formal Naval commanding officer and lifelong forester, first in Rhode Island and later as a professor (now emeritus) at Ohio State University, has won numerous awards and written too many publications to list. He writes: “My record at OSU is a result of the education I received at URI and Yale, and I am proud of it. I originally attended URI for one year and joined Phi Mu Delta fraternity. I also had the honor of holding the ram at URI football games—some honor!—and had to wear a beanie cap.” Cowen served in the Pacific Theater in WWII before returning to URI to get a botany degree, then a masters at Yale. “My years at URI were magical,” he adds. “Now I just wonder how many of us are still living.”\n\n’51\n\nBruce G.

For more information, visit http://www.marcseifer.com.”\n\n’74\n\nDouglas Ritter of Keller, Tex., writes: “I was a guest speaker at a communications class of Professor Roth. The speech was on advising students on how to get a job after graduation. First trip back to URI in 22 years. The students are younger and I am older.”\n\n’77\n\nWayne Kaplan of New York, N.Y., writes: “40 years later, we are four URI alums who are still good friends. I sent in a photo taken at my wife Kathy ’78’s and my country house in Bridgehampton, N.Y., in July. When we all moved down the line after the first year or two of URI, I moved to Harbour Island and Kathy, Roni and Laurie moved to Narragansett. We’ve all been friends since. Raised our kids together and now we’re on to grandchildren”.\n\nLaurie (Kikoen) Schwartz of Great Neck, N.Y., see Wayne Kaplan ’77 entry.\n\nTanya Trinkaus Glass, M.L.S. ’82, of Naples, Fla., writes: “I have a new artist’s website: www.tanyatrinkausglass.com.

In December I was the coordinator for the Southwest Florida Pastel Society’s “Small Works 2016” pastel show at the Norris Community Center Gallery in Naples.
