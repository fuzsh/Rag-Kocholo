        "text": "Welcome to Jewish Fiction .net, the only English-language journal, either in print or online, devoted exclusively to the publishing of Jewish fiction. We showcase the finest contemporary writing on Jewish themes (either written in, or translated into, English), and provide an online community for writers and readers of Jewish fiction from around the world.\n\nIn our first thirteen years, we have published nearly 600 stories or novel excerpts, originally written in 21 languages: Albanian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish), Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Turkish, and Yiddish. Jewish Fiction .net is truly an international journal and we have readers in 140 countries.\n\nWe are very honoured to have published fiction by such eminent writers as Elie Wiesel, Aharon Appelfeld, Nava Semel, A.B. Yehoshua, Natan Zach, Amir Gutfreund, Chava Rosenfarb, Gabriel Josipovici, Savyon Liebrecht, George Jonas, Yente Serdatsky, and Yoram Kaniuk, as well as many fine writers not yet well-known. We also are honoured that one of our stories (“The Ba’al Shem’s Daughter” by Glenn Gitomer) was selected for the Pushcart Prize this year and published in the 2023 Pushcart Prize anthology.\n\nAs the founder and editor-in-chief of Jewish Fiction .net, I see this journal as a means to bring together in one place first-rate Jewish fiction from around the globe, thus allowing readers to experience simultaneously the rich diversity that exists within Jewish culture and the core elements that unite us. Jewish Fiction .net is completely independent of any organization or funding body, relying entirely on donations from its readers, and we are proud that with our readers' support we are able to keep our journal free of charge and therefore accessible to all.\n\nDr. Nora Gold\n\nJoseph Kertes\n\nJoseph Kertes studied English at York University and the University of Toronto, where he was encouraged in his writing by Irving Layton and Marshall McLuhan. Kertes founded Humber College's creative writing and comedy programs. He is currently Humber's Dean of Creative and Performing Arts and is a recipient of numerous awards for teaching and innovation. His first novel, Winter Tulips, won the Stephen Leacock Award for Humour. Boardwalk, his second novel, and two children's books, The Gift and The Red Corduroy Shirt, met with critical acclaim. His latest novel, Gratitude, has won a Canadian National Jewish Book Award and the U.S. National Jewish Book Award for Fiction.\n\nBorn in Germany in 1926, Alice Shalvi was educated in England and immigrated to Israel in 1949. She is professor emerita of English Literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and served as principal of Pelech Religious Experimental School for Girls, as well as founding chairwoman of the Israel Womens Network, a pioneering feminist advocacy organization.\n\nAbout the Manuscript Reviewers & Editors\n\nJewish Fiction .net is very grateful to its dedicated manuscript reviewers and editors. In addition to one individual who chooses to remain anonymous, we thank:\n\nCharlotte Berkowitz\n\nCharlotte Berkowitz received her BA in French from Hofstra University and both her MA in Creative Writing and Ph.D. in English from the University of Houston, where she later taught English and Women's Studies. Charlotte's work on the capacity of the Torah to humanize self-styled \"man(kind)\" appears in the Routledge anthology, Religion in French Feminist Thought, and in such journals as The European Legacy, The Bible and Critical Theory, and Interdiscipli- nary Humanities.\n\nBernice Heilbrunn\n\nBernice Heilbrunn received a BA and MA in History and a JD from Harvard and earned a PhD in History from the University of Houston, where she teaches Jewish Studies. She also enjoys teaching adults in the Melton program.\n\nSidura Ludwig\n\nSidura Ludwig is a novelist and short story writer. Her collection of short fiction, You Are Not What We Expected, is published in Canada and the US by House of Anansi Press. Her novel, Holding My Breath, was published by Key Porter Books (Canada), Shaye Areheart Books (US) and Tindal Street Fiction (UK) in 2007. She was shortlisted for the Danuta Gleed Literary Award, the Vine Award for Canadian Jewish Literature, and the Carol Shields Winnipeg Book Award. She holds an MFA in Writing for Children and Young Adults from the Vermont College of Fine Arts. Sidura lives in Thornhill with her husband and three children.\n\nJulia Wolf Mazow\n\nJulia Wolf Mazow, PhD, was the Fiction Editor of Lilith magazine from 1984-1995, and was on the English faculty of the University of Houston for over 20 years. Her work on 19th century American writers has appeared in various academic journals, and she compiled and edited The Woman Who Lost Her Names (1980, 1981). Other articles have appeared in Bridges, Sojourner, Lilith, and The Jewish Woman: An Historical Encyclopedia.\n\nCarol Ricker\n\nCarol Ricker, PhD, is an educational consultant with a background in English education, women's and cultural studies, and contemporary literary criticism. Her publication record includes articles in refereed journals, book chapters, and curriculum resources. A long time anti-bias educator, she develops materials to encourage students (and adults) to read widely in order to become familiar with events, cultures and values different from their own, and to read critically for how authors address issues of identity, representation and power arrangements in their work.\n\nWe also acknowledge with gratitude the past contributions of our various manuscript reviewers and editors."
