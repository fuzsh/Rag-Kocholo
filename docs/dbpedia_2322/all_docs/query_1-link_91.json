        "text": "A poignant drama about love and reconciliation adapted by one of Israels most beloved authors from her own short story, this hit Israeli play follows the young Sephardic Rivka, a religious teenager, who falls for Dooby, a secular kibbutznik, at a dance class in Jerusalem. She arranges to follow him back to his kibbutz in the Negev Desert, but not before Rivkas orthodox parents bar her from leaving, forcibly at first, only to chase after Rivka as she flees.\n\nA timeless and timely confrontation between tradition and modernity becomes a moving reckoning, as the sweetest of meals is offered and two generations learn to make peace."
