        "text": "Posts Tagged‘Jewish-American literature’\n\nPre-Shabbat Jewish Literary Links\n\nEvery Friday My Machberet presents an array of Jewish-interest links, primarily of the literary variety.\n\nAdding another title to that TBR list: Elizabeth Edelglass’s take on Israeli author Savyon Liebrecht’s Apples from the Desert: Selected Stories has made me eager to get my hands on a copy of that book.\n\n“Finding Unexpected Faith in the Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit” is the title of a remarkable excerpt from Elizabeth L. Silver’s new memoir The Tincture of Time, which you can find over on Literary Hub.\n\nJob alert in New York: “The Harold Grinspoon Foundation (HGF) is seeking a PJ Library Communications and Marketing Coordinator who will implement a calendar of varied and diverse marketing and communication needs. The majority of this position serves the more than 26,000 New York-area PJ Library subscribers, with special projects and national-scale duties as assigned by the national Marketing and Operations team. This position reports to the Director of PJ Library in New York with cross-supervision by the Project Lead on the Marketing and Operations team in the national office.”\n\nICYMI: There’s a new poem of mine, titled “History Lesson in 210 Words,” over on the Jewish Journal website.\n\nAnd as we close a week during which we again observed Yom HaShoah: some reflections on “The Holocaust on Display,” with a focus on a current photography exhibit (“Memory Unearthed: The Lodz Ghetto Photographs of Henryk Ross”) at Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts, by Howard Richard Debs, on the Hevria site.\n\nShabbat shalom.\n\nPre-Shabbat Jewish Literary Links\n\nEvery Friday My Machberet presents an array of Jewish-interest links, primarily of the literary variety.\n\nOn Tablet, in time for Yom HaShoah: an excerpt from Leela Corman’s forthcoming graphic novel Victory Parade, in which a Jewish American soldier helps liberate Buchenwald—and is haunted by the experience.\n\nAlso connected with Yom HaShoah: “UnWitnessable: A Reading of Contemporary Poetry and Prose Related to the Holocaust,” an event for those in the Philadelphia area, happening next Wednesday, April 26.\n\n“Washington Jewish Week, a print and multi-platform digital publication covering the capital region’s diverse Jewish community, is looking for an enthusiastic, quick-learning general assignment reporter/writer to join our Rockville-based news team full time.”\n\nCheck out the April Jewish Book Carnival, hosted this month by Yael Shahar.\n\nAnd enjoy Judy Bolton-Fasman’s super write-up of Lilith magazine’s recent 40th-anniversary celebration at Brandeis University. Included: a sneak peek into Rachel Kadish’s forthcoming novel.\n\nShabbat shalom.\n\nPre-Shabbat Jewish Literary Links\n\nEvery Friday My Machberet presents an array of Jewish-interest links, primarily of the literary variety.\n\nNice to see this Q&A with my former poetry teacher Matthew Lippman over on The Whole Megillah.\n\nA powerful essay by Pearl Abraham, centered around her mother’s final Passover, over on Literary Hub.\n\nWith echoes of the stories of Lucette Lagnado and André Aciman, Ashley Jacobs recalls her grandparents’ “20-Century Exodus” from Egypt on JewishBoston.com.\n\nA pretty great week for Abigail Pogrebin’s My Jewish Year: a review in The New York Times, an appearance on The Today Show—and, coming up on Sunday morning: an appearance on Face the Nation.\n\nAnd, ICYMI, what I consider to be yesterday’s necessary deed of the day: calling out anti-Israel bias on a major radio show’s website.\n\nShabbat shalom.\n\nICYMI: Video Recordings of Recent #JewLit Events\n\nOne of the wonders of our modern world: recordings of literary events that make it possible for us to “attend” readings, conversations, and seminars—no matter where we live or what time of day we might be able to watch them.\n\nHere are just three events from the past week or so that I have viewed and recommend highly:\n\nCONFESSIONS OF A HASIDIC POET\n\nYehoshua November interviewed by journalist Danielle Ziri of the Jerusalem Post (Manhattan Jewish Experience).\n\n(more…)"
