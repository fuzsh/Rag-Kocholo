        "text": "Jewish Fiction .net is a prestigious online literary journal that publishes Jewish-themed fiction (either written in, or translated into, English) from around the world. In our first thirteen years, Jewish Fiction .net has published nearly 600 first-rate works of fiction (stories or novel excerpts) that had never been previously published in English, and that were written on five continents and in twenty-one languages: Albanian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish), Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Turkish, and Yiddish. Jewish Fiction .net is a truly international journal with readers in 140 countries.\n\nIn our first 36 issues, we are honoured to have published fiction by many eminent authors, such as Elie Wiesel, Aharon Appelfeld, Chava Rosenfarb, S.Y. Agnon, A.B. Yehoshua, Nava Semel, Steve Stern, Nessa Rapoport, Abraham Karpinovich, Amir Gutfreund, Alicia Steimberg, Shira Gorshman, Gabriel Josipovici, Natan Zach, Clive Sinclair, Savyon Liebrecht, Grigory Kanovich, Yoram Kaniuk, Ana Maria Shua, Tova Mirvis, Yente Serdatsky, Miron Izakson, and Radu Cosaşu. We feel privileged, as well, to have published many very talented writers who are not yet well-known.\n\nRecently Jewish Fiction .net was greatly honoured when one of our stories was selected and published in the Fall 2023 anthology of the Pushcart Prize."
