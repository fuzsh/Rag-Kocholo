        "text": "Since the 1990s, a new type of Holocaust story has been emerging in Israeli children's literature. This new narrative is directed towards very young children, from preschool to the first years of elementary school, and its official goal is to instil in them an authentic 'first Holocaust memory'. This essay presents the literary characteristics of this new Holocaust narrative for children and its master narrative. It brings into light a new profile of both writers and readers. The writers were young children during the Holocaust, and first chose to tell their stories from the safe distance of three generations. The readers are their grand-children and their grand-children's peers, who are assigned an essential role as listeners. These generational roles – the roles of a First Generation of writers and of a Third Generation of readers – are intrinsically familial ones. As such, they mark a significant change in the profile of yet another important figure in the Israeli intergenerational Holocaust discourse, the agent of the Holocaust story for children. Due to the new literary initiatives, the task of providing young children with a 'first Holocaust memory' is transferred from the educational authority, where it used to reside, to the domestic sphere.\n\nThis article engages with both the experience and construction of victimhood in Israel, moving between different locations and events, and comparing the public, or grand narrative with individual accounts. The main issues on which the article focuses are the relationships between victims and perpetrators, and between past and present, inquiring as to the political and moral consequences of forming these categories and identities, and of extrapolating from the past to the present. Both of those issues are discussed in relation to one another, in questioning how this extrapolation constitutes victimhood-related identities, and how those categories are formulated via the movement between past and present. Drawing on the notions of “storytelling”, the “short story”, and the “merographic connection”, the article offers a new perspective on accommodating tensions and moral paradoxes between and within narratives, as well as between past and present. These notions also provide the textual templates which form the basis of this article.\n\nThis article reports results from a qualitative study of Israelis living in Germany, focusing on their traumatized national habitus. The study is based on 80 in-depth interviews and on replies of more than 100 respondents to an online questionnaire. The present article focuses on one specific aspect of the Israeli traumatized habitus: 'the wounded eye and the scratched ear'. Specifically, it explores the ways by which the trauma of the Holocaust is inscribed in Israeli senses. It details how respondents' eyes, ears and thoughts are activated by German mundane episodes, linking day-today experiences to the trauma of the Holocaust. Trains, suspect on-boarding Israelis, might end up in Auschwitz; snow brings up associations of the death marches; old people are perceived as Gestapo officers; and contemporary child-rearing practices 'explain' to Israelis the obedience and collaboration of ordinary Germans with the Third Reich. Using thick description from the interviews I expose the suspicious Israeli habitus – which always looks for 'signs' that might explain what happened in Germany 80 years ago.\n\nIn literary narratives by Nava Semel (1954–2017) and Etgar Keret (b. 1967), both Israeli children of Holocaust survivors, readers encounter the kinds of searching questions about inheriting the burden of traumatic inheritance, witnessing, and postmemory frequently intrinsic to second-generation literature in other national contexts. However, their works are further distinguished by acute examinations that probe the moral fabric of Israeli society itself, including dehumanization of the enemy through slogans and other debased forms of language and misuses of historical memory. In addition, their fiction measures the distance between the suffering and pain of intimate family memory (what Semel once dubbed their “private Shoah”) and ceremonial, nationalistic forms of Holocaust memory, and the apartness felt by the children of survivors who sense themselves somehow at odds with their society’s heroic values. Semel’s numerous articles, and fiction as well as nonfiction books, frequently ..."
