To face a future filled with danger and hope, forging into territory that can only be surveyed with the lamp of imagination on our brows.\"- David Brin, multiple Hugo and Nebula award-author of EARTH and Existence\n\n\"When my collection Wandering Stars: An Anthology of Jewish Fantasy and Science Fiction was published in 1974, [It] became a classic. And now...we have the first ever anthology in the entire universe of Israeli fantasy and science fiction: Zion's Fiction...Go forth and read...and may you find Zion's Fiction unexpected, delightful, and delirious!\" -Jack Dann, award winning author and editor of over 75 books including The Memory Cathedral and The Silent\n\n\"The basic joy in science fiction and fantasy is the chance to look inside minds different from your own. Here's your chance. Some bright minds in the nation of Israel have been exercising their imaginations, sharing their different dreams and nightmares, and the results are ours to enjoy.\" - Larry Niven, a multiple Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author of the Ringworld Series\n\nSheldon Teitelbaum, an award-winning Los Angeles-based Canadian/American/Israeli writer, and former member of the Editorial Board of Fantasia 2000, is a longtime commentator on Jewish and Israeli science fiction and fantasy literature who has published widely in the Los Angeles Times, Cinefantastique, The Jerusalem Report, Foundation: The Review of Science Fiction, and The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\n\nEmanuel Lottem, a central figure in Israeli science fiction and fantasy scene and former member of the Editorial Board of Fantasia 2000, is the translator and editor of some of the best SF/F books published in Hebrew, and a moving force in the creation of the Israeli Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy.\n\nAvi Katz, an award-winning American-born Israeli illustrator, cartoonist, and painter, is the staff illustrator of Jerusalem Report magazine. He has illustrated over 170 books in Israel and the United States.\n\nReview Quotes\n\nThis is an essential and important work of genre scholarship that will introduce the vital work of Jewish and Arab authors in Israel as they create the future and, to steal a phrase, explore strange new worlds and boldly go where no mensch has gone before. -Mark Altman, Writer/Producer, Free Enterprise, \"World's Foremost Trekspert\" (The Los Angeles Times).\n\nWhat a rate of mutation! That mystic shepherds should become a people of priests and sacrifices, then transform under hard pressure into enduring, argumentative teachers, then again into scientific pioneers... and now? Zion's Fiction explores the unlimited dreams of a people who have learned to stand on shifting ground. To face a future filled with danger and hope, forging into territory that can only be surveyed with the lamp of imagination on our brows.- David Brin, author of EARTH and Existence\n\nThere is no gainsaying the worth of a literary anthology, especially in the field of fantastic literature. Other Canadas created the concept of Canadian science fiction and fantasy. I have no doubt that the anthology proposed by Sheldon Teitelbaum and his collaborators will do the same for the literature of the powerful imagination of the Israeli people.- John Robert Colombo, author, anthologist\n\nI have never been a fan of science fiction but I am fanatic about celebrating the incredible diversity of opinion, artistic expression and, yes, thought that the Jewish people in Israel celebrate every day. In a region where freedom remains as scarce as water in the desert, I know that Zion's Fiction will attract many followers -- Science Fiction mavens the world over... and the rest of us, Jews and non-Jews alike. B'hatzlacha! [Good luck!] - Rabbi Abraham Cooper, Associate Dean, The Simon Wiesenthal Center, Los Angeles.\n\nWhen my collection Wandering Stars: An Anthology of Jewish Fantasy and Science Fiction was published eight hundred years ago in 1974, the estimable author Leo Rosten asked, \"Jewish Science fiction?\" In fact everybody asked... \"What? Jewish science fiction?\" Bless his heart, Leo Rosten went on to say that the book was \"unexpected, delightful, and delirious,\" and what seemed at first to be a \"huh?\" idea became a classic. And now...now, right now, we have the first ever anthology in the entire universe of Israeli fantasy and science fiction: Zion's Fiction. What Israeli Science fiction So, nu? Go forth and read...and may you find Zion's Fiction unexpected, delightful, and delirious!- Jack Dann, author, anthologist\n\nI'm thrilled to hear of this project. At last I can read some of Israel's best science fiction! Translators are the hidden heroes that make the global village work. I co-edited 'Speculative Japan' a collection of Japanese SF, and I know that the translations in Zion's Fiction will be first rate. The quality of the translation decides the quality of the book, and I know that the translations in Zion's Fiction will be first rate. I co-edited Speculative Japan, a collection of Japanese SF. I know that the quality of the translations decides the quality of the book, and I know that the translations in Zion's Fiction will be first rate.- Grania Davis, editor, writer, translator, widow of American-Israeli SF writer Avram Davidson\n\nIsraeli writers and readers need an anthology like this. May it accomplish for Israeli science fiction the wonders and mind-opening possibilities that science fiction offers- James Gunn, author, anthologist, teacher, SF historian\n\nThe State of Israel's rebirth was a miracle. Its survival to this day is a continuing miracle. It is a land of scientific and human miracles. It makes perfect sense that Israel's rich and tumultuous culture should produce a blossoming science fiction community. A land that welcomes Ashkenazi, Sephardim, Ethiopian Jewry, Arabs, Russians -- a melting pot of the world's intellects and creators -- will inevitably bless the world with its unique and uniquely varied visions! - Richard A. Lupoff, novelist, editor, SF historian, critic, radio host\n\nOne of Israel's best-kept secrets has been the existence of a vibrant, colorful and imaginative community of mostly young science fiction and fantasy writers. Their work, long hidden behind the language barrier, is now about to burst out to the world in the Zion's Fiction anthology. May the Force be with them! - Avi Nesher, internationally acclaimed Israeli filmmaker\n\nGreat storytelling has been coming out of the Holy Land since the time of the Book of Genesis, and the tradition probably goes back a long way before that. This splendid new anthology will open a window on contemporary Israeli fantasy and science fiction -- a stream of powerful work that we need to know more about. - Robert Silverberg, author, anthologist\n\nZion's Fiction will supply a distinctive bright line to the spectrum of futuristic fiction, which stands in sore need of broadening, in the cause of promoting cross-cultural understanding as well as showcasing exciting new talent. - Brian Stableford, author, SF historian\n\nAbout the Author\n\nSheldon (Sheli) Teitelbaum is a Los Angeles-based Canadian/Israeli editor and writer, a former contributor to and member of the editorial board of the seminal Israeli SF magazine Fantasia 2000. He has contributed essays on Jewish and Israeli SF/F to the scholarly journal Foundation: The Review of Science Fiction, to the SF/F trade magazine Locus, and to the authoritative second and third (online) editions of The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and The Encyclopedia Judaica.\n\nTeitelbaum has also covered SF film, television, books and dark fantasy extensively for Cinefantastique, Cineaste, Midnight Graffiti, The Los Angeles Times, Wired, SF Eye, the Jerusalem Report, The Forward and the Jerusalem Post. The second and subsequent online edition of the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (Orbit, 1993) cited him as the first Israeli critic to contribute a regular column on science fiction to a daily Israeli newspaper. Dr. Adam Rovner, an Associate Professor of English and Jewish Literature at the University of Denver, generously (if extravagantly) described Teitelbaum in the Los Angeles Jewish Journal as \"the expert in the area of Israeli sci-fi.\"\n\nTeitelbaum, a long time senior writer for the Jerusalem Report, received Canada's first Northern Lights Award, three Brandeis University Jewish Press Association Awards and a Bronze Quill Award from the International Association of Business Communicators. He is a member of the Israeli Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy.\n\nEmanuel Lottem, Ph.D. (Econ) Emanuel Lottem has been a central figure in the Israeli science fiction and fantasy scene since the mid-1970s: Translator of some of the best SF/F books published in Hebrew and editor of others; advisor to beginning writers; the moving force in the creation of the Israeli Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy and its first Chairman; the founder of its annual ICon conventions and other activities.\n\nLottem's first SF translation was Frank Herbert's Dune, which has become a classic. According to Israeli literary historian Eli Eshed, \"this translation is considered a masterpiece of SF translations\"; and according to the Hebrew Wikipedia, \"some consider it even better than the original version\", a flattering characterization which Lottem nonetheless disagrees with. More SF/F translations followed, and Lottem's name became familiar to and respected by Hebrew-reading fans.\n\nAfter a few career changes, Lottem became a freelance translator and editor. In addition to SF/F, he also specializes in popular science and military history. In 1983, Lottem became chairman of the editorial board of the Israeli SF/F magazine Fantasia 2000, which unfortunately (but in terms of the exigencies of Israeli publishing, perhaps miraculously as well) lasted for 44 issues before rolling down its awning. A few years later, in 1996, Lottem presided over the inaugural meeting of the Israeli Society for Science Fiction and Fantasy, which he founded with a small group of devoted fans. Visiting author Brian Aldiss officially announced the ISSF&F open for business, and Lottem was unanimously elected its first Chairman.\n\nTo date, Lottem's SF/F translations include works by Douglas Adams, Poul Anderson, Isaac Asimov, Alfred Bester, Lois M. Bujold, C.J. Cherryh, Arthur C. Clarke, Michael Crichton, Philip K. Dick, William Gibson, Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert, Ursula Le Guin, Ann Leckie, Larry Niven, Mervyn Peake, Robert Silverberg, James Tiptree, Jr., J.R.R. Tolkien, Jack Vance, and Connie Willis, among many others. In 1994 Lottem won one of Israel's highest translation awards, the Tchernichovsky Prize, for his translation of Richard Dawkins's The Selfish Gene."
