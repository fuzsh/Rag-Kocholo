        "text": "A Good Place for the Night\n\nSavyon Liebrecht\n\nThis collection by one of Israel’s most popular authors turns upon issues of family, place and disconnection, and the stories have the dreamy, evocative smoothness of underwater films. As one character observes “I was frightened by the unfamiliar sensations flooding me, as if I'd lost my old place and still didn't have a new one.”\n\nDisorientation afflicts Liebrecht's characters from the Israeli reporter in Munich to cover a Nazi war trial to the mentally handicapped man trying to make a life among unsympathetic members of a kibbutz.\n\nIn the last and finest story, “A Good Place for the Night,” a woman struggles to survive in an unnamed place virtually destroyed by a nuclear catastrophe. The permanent unsettledness of Israel is exported and globalized here; no matter where Liebrecht's characters go or what they do, they are never yet truly at home.\n\n“I read these stories with bated breath...a wondrous and thrilling human and literary experience.”\n\n—Orit Harel, MAARIV (Tel Aviv)\n\nSavyon Liebrecht was born in Germany in 1948 and immigrated to Israel as a young child. She is an award-winning playwright and the author of six story collections and the novels A Man and a Woman and a Man and The Women My Father Knew. She lives in Tel Aviv.\n\nPaperback / $14.00 (Can $20.00) / ISBN 978-0-89255-320-4 / 224 pages / Fiction"
