All the purchase of ThinkFilm by Capitol Films means is that L.A. entrepreneurs David Bergstein and Ron Tudor have now expanded their way into the U.S. indie film distribution scene, having already established themselves in England by owning the U.K.-based Capitol Films. (Oddly, Capitol has Bordertown, that crackling Jennifer Lopez drama about the unsolved Juarez murders that no one will pick up, on its website — kind of an industry advertisement that says “we pick up shit nobody else wants!”) The upshot is that ThinkFilm (which will hang onto its name and retain all of its staffers) will now have more money to be more competitive with. Capitol also holds rights to the recently-wrapped Sidney Lumet drama Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead, which has no U.S. distributor.
