        "text": "Advertisement (gone after registration)\n\nWith the huge resurgence of film, the immense success of Ektachrome, Fujifilm seems to be truly hell-bent on discontinuing their film stock. What's really concerning to me is the announcement of the 5-packs of Velvia 50 & Velvia 100 soon, the singles can't be too far behind given their history. On the other hand, the Hipster Instax film can be found EVERYWHERE! My wife walked into a Joann's the other day and found it at the register. Unbelievable.\n\nIt feels that we got into film a couple years too late. We've really missed out on amazing films .. FP100c, Natura 1600, Superia, Acros (we did find some stock at Blue Moon Camera).\n\nSeems like a better business strategy would be to spin-off the film division of Fujifilm into a more nimble operation, rather than totally killing it off.\n\n12 hours ago, lcd32bit said:\n\nWith the huge resurgence of film\n\nYeah, well. Film is like a stock that peaked at $1000.00, and dropped to $0.02 a share, and has now \"resurged\" to $0.03 a share. I like to use it - I'm glad it's not in my retirement fund!\n\nCompanies are not charities - they make stuff that makes a profit for them.\n\nAs it happens, Kodak never got its other products to be as profitable as film, so it kept making film (going through bankruptcy in the process), As did Ilford (which mostly had no other products - Ilford inkjet papers were a separate Swiss company left over from the Ciba-Geigy/Ilford merger decades ago). As did Agfa - which did spin off its \"photo materials\" division, which shrivelled and died within 3-4 years.\n\nThe deal is this: Fujifilm and Kodak informally divided up the color film market after the 2008 crash. Kodak dropped slide films (Kodachrome, then Ektachrome) in favor of negs (since they had a big share of the motion-picture market, which uses color neg film for shooting (when not using digital)). Kodak cut a deal with Hollywood that guaranteed the studios would buy X-million feet of color-neg movie film per year so long as Kodak guaranteed to make X-million feet of movie film per year.\n\nFuji got the color slide/positive market, and reduced their participation in the color neg market (including abandoning their motion-picture products). And, of course, revived \"Instant Polaroid\" under the Instax brand (although there's also another revived Polaroid - formerly The Impossible Project, a group of ex-Polaroid chemists who restarted the Enschede, Netherlands factory - now using the original name).\n\n(Still with me? )\n\nBut now Kodak is reviving Ektachrome as part of their motion-picture deal - Hollywood needs new blood, and student cinematographers need a \"simple\" way to make and process and edit student color movies, thus Kodak is producing a Super-8mm \"student\" movie camera and the Super-8mm Ektachrome to feed it.\n\nhttps://www.kodak.com/consumer/products/super8/default.htm\n\nWith the side benefit that they will coat 35mm and 120 for us still photographers.\n\nBut that's going to eat into Fuji's slide-film share, that they've had all to themselves for whatever it's been - 6-7 years. So Fuji sees the writing on the wall, and will scale back E6 films, and count on Instax and their office copier and digicam businesses.\n\nIn other news, the Kodak UK pension fund (KPP2) is apparently in the latter stages of negotiating the sale of its paper, photochemical and film division (as part of divesting itself entirely of Kodak Alaris if it can). As is well known, Kodak Alaris is a marketing and distribution entity and not the manufacturer of Kodak film so the demise of Alaris (if that is what ultimately happens) isn't the end of the story for Kodak film. The PPF division is described as \"cash generative\" (though clearly not cash generative enough to dissuade the pension fund against flogging an asset it values at only $34m) and it sounds as if a sale is imminent. It will be interesting to see who might be buying. My guess is that it isn't Ilford, Fujifilm or another surviving film manufacturer, even if that would seem logical.\n\nWhilst I don't fear for the immediate future of Kodak (either Eastman or Alaris) I thought it was a good excuse to buy some more Portra.😀\n\nEdited February 4, 2019 by wattsy\n\nIt has been a bleak couple of weeks for film, what with the Fuji indications of cut backs, Tetenal probably closing unless a buyer can be found in the very near future and Kodak looking to sell Alaris. Just when we thought it was safe to go back in the water and film was looking at a modest revival. The main champion of film at Fuji, Mr. Shigetaka Komori, is 79 years old and one wonders how much longer he will want to remain as chairman and CEO.\n\nWho would buy Alaris? Sadly, I doubt that buyers will be queuing up round the block. Alaris have been trying hard with the re-introduction of Ektachrome, TX3200 and wider distribution of Profoto 100 \"tropical\" colour negative film. I have bought 10 rolls of this latter film for my India trip. What happens if no buyer/rescuer for Alaris appears? The main shareholder of Alaris is not Kodak per se but the Kodak pension fund. The fund trustees are obliged under law to take dispassionate decisions and emotionally much as they would like film production to continue, Alaris would have to demonstrate that they can operate profitably - not easy.\n\nWilson\n\nWouldn't surprise me if Kodak simply buys back their former property (basically, the rights to be the distributor on Kodak photo products, and take the \"middle-man\" profits).\n\nKodak (as opposed to the Alaris spinoff) never gave up the film production business - they just provided the products for Alaris to sell. (At cost? for free?) The machines and labs in Rochester still belong to Kodak (and also produce motion picture film by the millions of feet per year - not a part of the KPP/Alaris portfolio).\n\nBottom line, the UK Kodak Pension Plan (KPP) is finding out the same thing Kodak did before declaring bankruptcy. Selling film can be profitable - it can't be profitable enough to support the burden of decades of corporate pension obligations. Especially for a pension fund, which is at core an investment business, not a \"running a company\" business.\n\nKPP is reportedly shopping around the photography part of the business (film, color paper, chemicals) for $34 million. Less than the price of one Gulfstream IV business jet (!).\n\nSomeone who is an investment maven can probably figure out what level of EBITDA justifies an investment of that amount.\n\nI'd guess Kodak can do better than a de novo investor. Absorb it back in, keep their machines running efficiently, handle the distribution to stores (on-line and brick-and-mortar) and take all the profits for themselves."
