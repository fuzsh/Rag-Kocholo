        "text": "Introducing Richard Matson, Vice President of Theatrical Distribution\n\nI hail from the glorious metropolis of Little Rock, AR in the verdant foothills of the mighty Ouachita Mountains (top peak 2753 ft!). From there, I bounced around for college stints at Hampshire, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, then Columbia College. I made my way to NYC to start my career directing epic, Fellini-esque movies. Filmmaker friends told me that if I wanted to direct I should avoid the industry, get a bartending job and dedicate all of my free time to writing… so I immediately took a job running a production/distribution company.\n\nLuckily for me, the two ad agency guys who started the company knew even less about the film business than I did. We had a fantastic time and I learned so much from them about taking risks in an established industry, following your customer/audience, and recognizing the needs and values of all parties along the way. In 4 short years we produced and distributed Adrien Brody’s first 2 starring roles and a political doc with Philip Seymour Hoffman.\n\nIn 2002, I decided to enter the burgeoning online world and founded a company, Transmission Films, which became the third largest online film distributor in the world. Of course, in 2002, it took 12 hours to download a feature film. Being third largest of nothing isn’t much fun! After 2 years, I sold the company and gratefully reentered the theatrical world with Matson Films. For the past 13 years, I have had the privilege to distribute over 100 films of all shapes and sizes working with a wide variety of clients. Since 2014, The Orchard has been one of those clients – and it has been a true pleasure to work with the entire film team on a fantastic slate of movies.\n\nI’ve been a fan of the company since somewhere around 2004. Back then, my best friend was running an all-Arkansan record label. The Orchard secured a $60,000 TV pilot paycheck for one of his no-name artists on a song about a snake and a canoe. Now that’s amazing! After 20 years, I’m still passionate about independent film, am constantly excited by the challenges and opportunities of the ever-changing landscape, and inspired by a community of professionals that believe our medium has a unique ability to change the way people think about the world.\n\nThe Orchard has assembled an exceptional team with a strong vision for the future. I’m very excited to contribute whatever I can."
