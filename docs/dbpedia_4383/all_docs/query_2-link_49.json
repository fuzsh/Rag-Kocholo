        "text": "(New York, NY - February 6, 2024). Metrograph announced today that Independent Film Distribution Executive David Laub has joined the company as Head of Metrograph Pictures. Laub departs his role at A24 and will assemble a team to build a prestigious slate of theatrical releases that Metrograph will distribute. Prior to Laub’s appointment, the company focused on restorations. Metrograph, founded by Alexander Olch in 2016, is coming off an incredibly successful, record-breaking year at both its New York theater and Metrograph At Home, its SVOD service, under CEO Christian Grass. The further development of its theatrical distribution label expands Metrograph’s growth as a next generation movie studio. This comes at a time when the industry is in dire need of fresh thinking and inventive distribution options. Laub will immediately hit the ground running at the upcoming Berlinale and European Film Market next week.\n\nFor the past nine years, David Laub has been a highly respected distribution executive for film and television studio A24. During his tenure, Laub worked in all aspects of film distribution including acquisitions, marketing, publicity, and exhibition. Among the projects he oversaw there include the Academy Award ® nominated Aftersun, the Academy Award nominated ® Close, Joanna Hogg’s The Souvenir and The Souvenir: Part II, Kelly Reichardt’s Showing Up and First Cow, Paul Schrader’s First Reformed, and the restoration of Jonathan Demme’s Stop Making Sense. David has also worked across the wider A24 slate on campaigns of such releases as Academy Award ® Best Picture winner Everything Everywhere All At Once, Ari Aster’s Hereditary and Midsommar, Josh and Benny Safdie’s Uncut Gems and Good Time, Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird, Sean Baker’s The Florida Project and Red Rocket, Barry Jenkins’ Academy Award ® winning Moonlight, and Robert Eggers’ The Witch and The Lighthouse. Prior to A24, Laub spent 3 years as Co-President of Oscilloscope Laboratories and 2 years as their Head of Acquisitions, where he worked on films such as Banksy’s Exit Through The Gift Shop, Oren Moverman’s The Messenger, Kelly Reichardt’s Wendy and Lucy and Meek’s Cutoff, and Lynn Ramsay’s We Need To Talk About Kevin. He started his career at ThinkFilm where he worked for 5 years. He has a BA in Film Studies and English from Wesleyan University, and an MA in Film Studies, also from Wesleyan.\n\nAt Metrograph, Laub will be reporting to and working closely with CEO Christian Grass, who joined the company in 2018 to grow the brand. This is a significant step to expand Metrograph’s national footprint as it comes off record 2023 and January 2024 theatrical box office numbers under Director of Programming Inge de Leeuw. Laub will be building a theatrical slate of American Independent, International and Documentary Features as well as continuing to release restorations of classic films from around the world. Metrograph will be looking at both finished films as well movies in earlier stages to potentially provide financing. The company is currently looking at projects with an aim to get up to 10 robustly supported releases per year.\n\nChristian Grass, CEO, said, “Metrograph Pictures is an important building block in our strategy to continue the strong growth of the Metrograph brand. It was important for us to find someone as passionate, strategic and experienced as David to lead this venture. His passion for film and filmmaker relationships are as impressive as his knowledge of all aspects of the business. We are really excited to work with him on building this into a significant distribution label.”\n\nDavid Laub, Head of Metrograph Pictures, said: “I am so proud to be heading up this new venture for Metrograph. Their taste and passion for cinema is second to none, and they have demonstrated an incredible ability to connect great movies with fresh and enthusiastic audiences. We are excited to work with a wide range of films and filmmakers, and be a robust new presence in the distribution landscape.\""
