He was previously head of the Capitol Films (GOSFORD PARK) specialist division, Thinkfilm International where he was responsible for a diverse slate of films from directors such as Nigel Cole and Alex de la Iglesia.Between 2003 and 2007, Will worked at UK production company, Carnaby Films PLC (RISE OF THE FOOTSOLDIER, LONG WEEKEND) where he launched the international sales arm, Carnaby International before taking on additional duties including financing, business affairs and overseeing production on all Carnaby titles. Between 1999 and 2003, Will worked for Lolafilms (THE DANCER UPSTAIRS, JAMON JAMON), Spain’s leading film production, distribution and sales company, owned by multinational media and telecoms company Admira (formerly Telefonica Media). As Co-President of International Sales, he was responsible for world-wide sales and acquisitions as well as English language co-productions.
