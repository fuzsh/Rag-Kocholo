        "text": "Should you go to film school? If you're just starting out as a filmmaker, deciding if you should attend a traditional film school is something you need to decide. And it's a costly decision – some of my friends here in Los Angeles are over fifty-thousand dollars in debt.\n\nWhile most of my friends value having a college education, all agree that having a film school degree will not guarantee success in Hollywood. Like any industry, becoming successful requires passion, commitment and hard work.\n\nLast year, I was introduced to filmmaker Seth Hymes. When he was in high school, he worked as Production Assistant, Sound Tech and an Editor. After high school, he went off to film school. In fact, he graduated from NYU with honors. From there, he was an editor for Fox News Channel and also managed to get two features into production.\n\nShould You Go To Film School?\n\nSo I sat down with Seth and asked him some questions about his experience.\n\nJason Brubaker\n\nSeth. After visiting your website and chatting, you seem to have an interesting perspective on formal film school education. What are your thoughts? Is there any value in film school?\n\nSeth Hymes\n\nNo, there isn't. And it's a great question. What does “value” mean? It means that something adds merit or worth to your life for a reasonable cost. A lot of people say things like “you learn the basics” and it's a “good place to experiment”.\n\nJason Brubaker\n\nSo in your experience, you think film school is over priced?\n\nSeth Hymes\n\nWell, in film school, you write a check for $100,000. In return, they give you a $2,000 video camera and tell you how to push the on button. Are you going to learn something? Sure. Is it valuable? No. There is no value in learning basic technical concepts for an obscene mark up in cost.\n\nJason Brubaker\n\nIn the past, students enrolled in film school because held the promise of networking, as well as access to equipment. You're saying this sort of stuff is no longer relevant?\n\nSeth Hymes\n\nThe 3 main “values” of film school are no longer relevant. They are, access to equipment, lessons in filmmaking craft and connections. In the 60s, 70s, and 80s, when people like Lucas, Scorsese, and Spike Lee went to film school, it was probably a good investment. You couldn't just pick up a high quality HD camera and start shooting. Filmmaking equipment cost a ton of money and was hard to find. You really couldn't learn about things like continuity and storyboarding without either apprenticing with a filmmaker or going to school. And it was a good place to meet other creative professionals.\n\nJason Brubaker\n\nBut all of that has changed.\n\nSeth Hymes\n\nYeah. If you look at today, High Definition filmmaking equipment costs less than a semester at most film schools. The craft of filmmaking, from lighting, editing, shot composition, writing – all of it is available to learn on websites like yours, as well as other sites all over the net. And these days, most connections happen through the net. And further, many new filmmakers find their agents because they produce a short and get some heat on youtube, rather than meeting them in school.\n\nJason Brubaker\n\nSort of a silly question. But would you recommend that anybody attends film school?\n\nSeth Hymes\n\nI do not recommend anybody attend film school. It is an unholy waste of money and time. And not only are the schools making a huge profit, they also neglect to teach their grads about anything of real value or importance when it comes to having a career in the business. Things like real networking, fundraising, or film distribution.\n\nJason Brubaker\n\nSo instead of film school, what suggestions do you have for any students who is considering a degree in filmmaking?\n\nSeth Hymes\n\nIf you're considering film school, here's the litmus test. Is it a community college or vocational school where classes are anywhere from $60 to $1000? If anyone is charging more than that, they are making an obscene profit and should be dismissed outright. You will be mocked within the film business for attending such an institution. Instead, I recommend that students save their money, buy their own equipment, and learn how to shoot their own movie.\n\nThese days, filmmakers can learn everything you need to know in a week or less.\n\nJason Brubaker\n\nReading your posts on other websites and the comments that follow, I can see why some filmmakers, especially the filmmakers sitting on film school debt can get a little emotional with your perspective.\n\nSeth Hymes\n\nMost film school grads and filmmakers agree with me, but there are a few haters. Some people hate hearing the truth. It's hard for some people to admit they got hosed out of $100K, but the consensus everywhere is that film school is a waste.\n\nJason Brubaker\n\nI took a look at your website. Tell us what you teach there.\n\nSeth Hymes\n\nI teach people first, exactly why places like NYU are a complete joke and secondly, what to do instead of film school. There's a lot of pressure to go to college, and I understand that. My book “Film Fooled” is a powerful reality check, a class by class account of NYU's film curriculum to help people realize that no, they are not missing out on anything by skipping film school.\n\nJason Brubaker\n\nSounds like you think film schools should improve their curriculum.\n\nSeth Hymes\n\nYeah. I get into the stuff they should be teaching in schools. Mainly, how to be taken seriously as a director from day one, how to get on real film sets, meet real working filmmakers, write feature scripts, manage a set, hire film students, and get seen. Anyone taking my course will be 4 years ahead of any film school student in just a week.\n\nJason Brubaker\n\nOk. So tell us about your online film course.\n\nSeth Hymes\n\nOk.
