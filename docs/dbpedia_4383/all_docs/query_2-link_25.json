        "text": "I've recently become nail-bitingly obsessed with something called dot watching. It's an exciting little deviation from work-related demands. The reason I've become obsessed with dot watching is an incredible person called Abdullah Zeinab - an Adelaide born ultra-endurance cyclist who's redefining limits. Seven years ago, whilst Abdullah was filming the inaugural Indian Pacific Wheel Race across Australia, one of the main characters in his film, Mike Hall, died in a tragic road accident whilst competing. Drawing on inspiration from Mike and other competitors in the race, Abdullah decided to begin his own cycling journey and went on to win that very same race just one year later. He subsequently won the 2019 Trans America Bike Race (6800kms) and the 2022 Rhino Run (2,741km course across Africa.) This year Abdullah is taking part in the 10th anniversary of the prestigious Transcontinental Race (founded by Mike Hall). He sees this as an opportunity to not only take on his biggest challenge to date, but also to close a circle that was opened seven years ago when he met Mike and began his ultra-endurance journey. For Abdullah, cycling is about much more than riding a bike. He believes its true value lies in the opportunity to explore the outer limits of his mind by pushing his body beyond its conceivable limits. Abdullah is currently in second place. He's the underdog in this race, having never competed in a TCR before. He has now been riding for 3 days, 20 minutes and has slept for only around 6 hours. Our Think Films team is currently in Bosnia filming the race and making their way towards the third checkpoint at Kosovo. Below are stills taken recently of Abdullah riding through Bosnia. Tonight I leave for Istanbul where I'll join them at the finish line. I'm very excited to be producing this documentary which will be an immersive, psychological exploration of the lengths one will go to in pursuit of happiness and relief from the tyranny of external validation. A film that so many of us will relate to. Already we have interest from an international film festival and a streamer in this film. Exciting times ahead. If you're keen to explore dot watching Abdullah as he races, he's number 21 and here's the dot watching link: https://lnkd.in/gaX5uXCm Stay tuned for an immersive look into one man's extraordinary journey. üö¥‚ôÇÔ∏èüé• #DotWatching #UltraEndurance #Cycling #Documentary #TranscontinentalRace\n\nIn 2014, my journey to Emmaus Community in Perth marked the beginning of a lasting connection. Initially tasked with creating a short film spotlighting the community's impact in providing long-term homes for adults facing mental health challenges, I soon found myself immersed in a world of deep human connection. Six years later, among national lockdowns at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, we unveiled a powerful documentary on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) titled \"A Place to Call Home.\" This documentary explored Emmaus Community's transformative influence, not only on its residents but also on the broader mental health landscape of Western Australia. At its heart, \"A Place to Call Home\" narrated the remarkable genesis of Emmaus Community, rooted in Br Al Archer's journey from pursuing fame and fortune in Los Angeles to his unwavering commitment to providing stability and support for those in need. Through this documentary, viewers were invited to connect with Emmaus residents as they witnessed the unveiling of their photographic portraits for the first time. I love that the essence of our work at Think Films lies both in sharing short form stories for online audiences and also longer form pieces for viewers across broadcast and streaming platforms.
