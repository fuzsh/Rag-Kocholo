        "text": "Introducing Rebecca Fisher, Director, Theatrical Publicity\n\nHi everyone! I am Rebecca Fisher and I am so happy to be joining The Orchard team as Director of Theatrical Publicity.\n\nI’ve come here from the publicity agency PMK*BNC, where I worked for two years on a variety of films including CAROL, THE HATEFUL EIGHT, THE IMITATION GAME, IRIS, and LIFE AFTER BETH. Prior to PMK, I was at another agency called Block Korenbrot for eight years, where I worked closely with Sony Pictures Classics on a range of wonderful films including AN EDUCATION, A SEPARATION, IN A BETTER WORLD, and SEARCHING FOR SUGAR MAN. I also worked on Pablo Larraín’s NO, which was nominated for a Foreign Language Academy Award. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to work on his new film NERUDA, which we just acquired out of Cannes.\n\nI moved to LA 14 years ago from Seattle. While there, I worked for the Seattle International Film Festival, and before that I managed several independent video stores.\n\nWhen I am not at work, I love to go to the cinema, hang out with my cat, and travel! I look forward to meeting all of you and to share many fun and successful film adventures."
