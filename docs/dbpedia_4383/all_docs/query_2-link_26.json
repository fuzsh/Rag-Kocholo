        "text": "Raijin - I don't think that Garden State should be considered 'independent'. It doesn't seem like it at least, it was very famous, had famous actors...I don't think so either. However, it was a very good film.\n\nFaust - Where I live, only losers watch indies I mean, how could you ever turn down Legally for a very well made, indie flick ?!?!?! And I think you'd be surprised what the Hollywood Video ninja in my neck of the woods carries ..but yes, I have thought of joining netflix. Thankyou for the list, I'll try and see all of those.\n\nI just watched Mean Creek last night. Many people see an indie film and don't consider it indie because of the people the story is about, maybe in this film they were teens whose only major topic of discussion was ' licking'. However, in the end their cheap talk was left for a very deep music amidst the silence and the only other sound was the creek and their tears. The film ended in a very thought provoking manner. The acting was a bit bad at times, and very good at other times, but I still recommend this film. I definately recommend this film.\n\nfashionologie said:\n\nI agree with you, waukon73.\n\nThirteen may has gotten a lot of press for being \"avant garde,\" yes, but does that media attention mean it was a major Hollywood production? No. The film was produced by Michael London Productions and Antidote Films, and we should all ask ourselves, \"Are these major production companies?\" Simple answer: No. Sure, they've produced a few other films, but they're not the big boys when it comes to the league of big-time blockbusters. Moreover, simply looking at the finances, Thirteen's budget didn't even reach $1.5 million, nor did it gross $5 million in the box office. Can you even compare $5 million total to an average of over $50 million the first weekend for major blockbusters? Probably not. Finally, Thirteen was distributed by Fox Searchlight in the states. Yeah, it's Fox, and yeah, Fox is big and ugly and evil, but the truth of the matter is that Fox Searchlight was created for the sole purpose of distributing indie flicks like Thirteen. Granted, the film's not as \"indie\" as some of the ultra-low budget films out there just barely scraping along, but it still definitely falls under the \"indie\" category and qualifications. That said, it was a really good film, and even if it weren't indie, which it is, I'd still recommend it.\n\nLast I've heard, big advertising campaigns and hype BEFORE the film gets into theaters kind of disqualify the film from beind an indie. Just because it deals with a serious subject matter, doesn't make it an indie. The film was not bad, I never said it was. Yet, it had that Hollywood polish under all the rough stuff. It's still worth watching, but it's not nearly as strong as Kids, that's all I'm saying...\n\nArturo let me know your opinion of the films as you go through them, I'd be interested to hear. I just remembered another stong one, which I haven't personally seen yet, \"Brazil.\"\n\nfaust said:\n\nLast I've heard, big advertising campaigns and hype BEFORE the film gets into theaters kind of disqualify the film from beind an indie. Just because it deals with a serious subject matter, doesn't make it an indie.\n\nOk, let's take a quick example: Primer. The film had a measly $7,000 budget, with no major financial backings; ThinkFilm was the only Production Company/Distributor that got behind it. It ended up winning the Grand Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival last year, but before doing that, was hyped out the wazoo. There were posters, flyers, trailers in major movie theaters; from what I know, they ended up spending more than twice their budget on advertising and the subsequent hype just built from there. Now this film was about as indie as they come, but it was hyped, yes. Does that mean it's still indie? Why not? It just happened to do well. Now I hate hype as much as the next person, but you can't lie to yourself and say that any movie that's hyped automatically falls out of the indie category.\n\nNow, on to your example of Kids as a good indie film, better than Thirteen. Quality aside, if you're going to disqualify anything that's hyped or advertised as indie, you're going to have to disqualify Kids as well. Why? First off, one of the Production Companies was Miramax Films (read: ultra-mainstream film company). Next, it got so hyped it was almost disgusting, and the hype is still alive and kicking. In fact, among college circles, it's still probably the most hyped film (comparable with City of Lost Children). Moreover, it had the exact same budget as Thirteen but ended up making a whole lot more money than it. By your standards, Kids is actually less of an indie movie than Thirteen.\n\nOh, and as for your recommendation of Brazil, it's a great film! However, not indie at all. It was directed by Terry Gilliam (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, assorted Monty Python films, aka not an indie director but good nonetheless), and produced and distributed by Universal, one of the largest film companies around. Needless to say, it's not indie film at all (although it may feel like it is), but it's still good and recommended.\n\nfashionologie said:\n\nOk, let's take a quick example: Primer.

Needless to say, it's not indie film at all (although it may feel like it is), but it's still good and recommended.\n\nFirst time I hear about Primer. What does that tell you? Thirteen on the contrary was EVERYWHERE. I didn't go see in a special indie/foreign film movie theater, I went to the mainstream one. Kids was all word-of-mouth advertisement. It didn't have Hollywood actors, not even professional actors in it. It got a lot of attention because it was such a strong film. The \"hype\" is still alive because Larry Clark is still preoccupied with the adolescency theme.\n\nAnd your point about distribution is not a good one, almost everything is distributed by major studios."
