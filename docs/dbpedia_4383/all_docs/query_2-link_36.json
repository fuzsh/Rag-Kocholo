        "text": "For Jeff Sackman and the other executives at ThinkFilm, revenge will be a dish served cold. Antarctic cold. Coming soon, the Toronto-based movie distributor will release Farce of the Penguins into theatres, the brainchild of comedian and former sitcom dad, Bob Saget.\n\nThe film doesn't just poke fun at 2005's massively successful March of the Penguins, it skewers the feel-good nature flick, which grossed a stunning $122-million (U.S.) at the box office and went on to claim the best documentary feature prize at the Oscars.\n\nWhile March of the Penguins poetically tracks the epic lengths the species goes to each year to mate, Farce of the Penguins chronicles \"one bird's search for love while on a 70-mile trek with his hedonistic buddies.\"\n\nMr. Sackman smirks. That should show them. After all, it was March of the Penguins that beat out ThinkFilm's edgy Murderball at the Academy Awards this year, even though many critics pegged it as the best documentary of 2005.\n\nBut aside from the pleasure he may get from poking fun (Mr. Sackman insists he isn't anti-penguin, as Farce was in the works long before the Oscars), the coming release is the quintessential ThinkFilm movie. It is controversial, relatively inexpensive to get the distribution rights for and will practically market itself through buzz on the street.\n\nThat, in a sentence, has become the ThinkFilm recipe. The company doesn't merely court controversy, it milks scandal for all it's worth. Five years after launching ThinkFilm, Mr. Sackman and his colleagues have carved out a niche as the distributor that goes after the kinds of movies most companies won't touch.\n\nBrowse through a list of their titles and you get a sense of ThinkFilm's strategy as a movie distributor. There is the documentary, Fuck, an exploration of the world's most famous expletive. There is The Aristocrats, a film no other distributor would touch because it involves comedians telling the same crass joke over and over. ThinkFilm bought the rights for it and parlayed the movie into $7-million at the box office, a healthy sum for a small production, despite threats of being banned from some theatres.\n\nThen there is Shortbus, the much anticipated film at this year's Toronto International Film Festival that drew gasps from audiences at Cannes for its vivid sex scenes. ThinkFilm picked up on that reaction, saw the potential for controversy and media attention, and jumped aboard as a distributor for the film.\n\nShortbus is a perfect example of ThinkFilm's strategy, Mr. Sackman says. The distribution business is all about marketing. The biggest companies will spend dollars, but the smaller ones find other means to generate buzz. When a theatre chain in the United States threatened to refuse The Aristocrats, Mr. Sackman admits he loved every minute of the free advertising the film got from the media coverage.\n\nWith Shortbus, Mr. Sackman may be the only person at the Toronto film festival this week to have hired an obscenity consultant. A lawyer familiar with the content of Shortbus approached ThinkFilm recently to counsel the company if it gets into trouble in U.S. states where decency laws may come into play.\n\n\"He saw the film and said 'there's no concern there, but you should still hire me.' The idea is to protect yourself,\" Mr. Sackman says. \"If we played in Alabama and it violates their community standards, it could be an issue, so now we've got a specialist in First Amendment rights . . . none of us really believe [the threat is real] But it cracks me up that somebody said that.\"\n\nWhen ThinkFilm started five years ago, courting controversy was a conscious decision. The company intentionally stays out of the industry association in the United States that requires all members to have their films rated. That way, ThinkFilm can pick up risky movies that other companies would avoid because they require a rating. The company then sends them into theatres without a rating, usually drawing headlines along the way.\n\n\"We seem to have become synonymous with edgy and controversial material,\" Mr. Sackman says. \"We don't love those films simply for salacious purposes, we love them because they are clay that we know how to mould.\"\n\nThat approach hasn't kept the company from garnering respect, however. ThinkFilm's picks have won several accolades, including an Oscar for the documentary Born into Brothels and the nomination for Murderball.\n\n\"Once you're at the theatre, it's an equal playing field,\" Mr. Sackman says. With Shortbus set to be released soon, Mr. Sackman is hoping to draw the ire of someone. It will help the film immensely.\n\n\"Please,\" he says in his office, mocking a fictional conversation with Canadian film raters. \"Call this porn. Somebody please do it.\"\n\nThinkFilm is a private company, so its balance sheet is a guarded secret. However, it is profitable, Mr. Sackman says. It has also been at the centre of rumours that it is up for sale, which Mr. Sackman confirms by saying: \"ThinkFilm has been up for sale since it started.\"\n\nOnce again, he is stoking publicity for the firm, which has lasted five years in a business with much bigger competitors threatening to trample people like Mr. Sackman.\n\n\"People think you can just get into this business because it looks easy in some respects,\" he says. \"Well, if that's what they think, then come right in.\"\n\nJeff Sackman, president and CEO, ThinkFilm\n\nAge: 46\n\nFamily: Married, with twin six-year-olds.\n\nCareer background: Began in the industry in 1985 as an executive with Cineplex Odeon. Former president of Lions Gate. Started ThinkFilm in 2001.\n\nEducation: Master of business administration degree with a specialty in film from Syracuse University. Bachelor of commerce degree from McGill University.\n\nManagement style: \"It's best described as horizontal where everybody has a role where we don't follow a strict hierarchy. I look at all the roles as side to side instead of top to bottom.\"\n\nStrategy for finding the next hit film: \"You can have a hard and fast plan, but we find opportunism and flexibility is the best. There are always films that emerge from festivals that create a buzz, which we will then pounce upon and try to outwit the competition and gain the rights.\"\n\nSavviest move: Taking the controversial film The Aristocrats to better-than-expected box office success, even though the film centres around the repeated telling of a lewd joke by a variety of comedians and no major distributor would touch it.\n\nBiggest disappointment: When the Oscar-nominated documentary Murderball, about wheelchair rugby players, did not meet box office expectations despite almost unanimous critical acclaim. \" Murderball goes down as the biggest disappointment of my career.\"\n\nFavourite movies: The Godfather and Raiders of the Lost Ark. \"My personal favourite is a film called The Stunt Man, which is a classic that I try to foist on all the young people in the office.\"\n\nTEXT: GRANT ROBERTSON PHOTO: AARON HARRIS/THE GLOBE AND MAIL"
