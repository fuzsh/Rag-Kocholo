        "text": "If youâre a filmmaker or indie producer, nowâs the time to acquaint yourself with independent film distributors. That is, if you want eyes on your film.Â Without an indie film distributor, no one will see your film but you and your family. Get familiar with this list of independent film distribution companies to find the right partner!\n\nAbramorama\n\nHave a documentary in need of indie film distribution? Especially if your film has a social impact message, it might be the perfect fit for Abramorama, an indie distribution company that specializes in that very type of media.Â\n\nIt considers itself âinnovator in focused, niche film distribution, direct-to-consumer engagement, and live, event and digital cinema.â\n\nAnd if youâre seeking distribution outside of the United States, Abramorama offers global options for its clientele.Â\n\nBayView Entertainment\n\nFinding indie film distribution across multiple platforms is vital to a modern indie film. BayView Entertainment has been leading low budget film distributors in this field for fifteen years across all film genres.\n\nPer its website, it has partnerships with:\n\nAmazon\n\nComcast\n\nDish\n\nGoogle Play\n\niTunes\n\nPluto\n\nRedbox\n\nRoku\n\nSling\n\nTubi\n\nVimeo\n\nVizio\n\nVudu\n\nYouTubeÂ\n\nMoreover, it markets itself as âa full service media company committed to acquire, develop, produce, market, and distribute audio-visual content.â As a filmmaker considering indie film distributors, one with this type of comprehensive support should be on your list.\n\nBreaking Glass Pictures\n\nWhen assessing independent film distribution companies, itâs never a bad idea to see what they offer in the way of international distribution. Case in point, Breaking Glass Pictures. It markets itself as âa globally connected indie film distribution companyâ with its primary focus in North America.\n\nHowever, Breaking Glass Pictures also has an international sales branch with distribution partners in regions such as:\n\nAsia\n\nAustralia\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nSo if youâre a filmmaker researching independent film distributors with global reach, add Breaking Glass Pictures to your list.Â\n\nCanyon Cinema Foundation\n\nAre you an experimental or avant-garde filmmaker or indie producer working out of the West Coast? Then you may want to add Canyon Cinema to your list of film distributors.Â\n\nThe beginnings of this indie distribution company go all the way back to 1967 when it was an artist-run distribution co-op. It formally became the non-profit Canyon Cinema Foundation (CCF) in 2014 and offers distribution options for West Coast artists.\n\nGiven that many independent film distribution companies tend to cater to more traditional films, Canyon Cinema Foundation can be a tremendous partner for anyone working in the experimental or avant-garde space.\n\nCinedigm\n\nWhen putting together your list of independent film distributors, are you considering exactly how they will circulate your film? Does their indie film distribution include theatrical, broadcast television, streaming, digital, cable, or satellite VOD?Â\n\nNot to mention, some film lovers still purchase physical media. Do your potential low budget film distributors offer DVD, Blu-ray, or 4K options?\n\nCinedigm does. Moreover, it provides distribution through a number of broad and genre-specific streaming channels, including:Â\n\nBloody Disgusting\n\nDocurama\n\nDove Channel\n\nLone Star Channel\n\nRetro Crush\n\nScreambox\n\nThe Cinema Guild\n\nProducers Philip and Mary-Ann Hobel have been behind a number of documentary and scripted narrative works, including the Oscar-winning Tender Mercies. Theyâre also the founders of The Cinema Guild, one of several independent film distributors based in New York City.\n\nGiven their professional background, the Hobels focus primarily on distribution for independent, foreign, and documentary films. If your project falls into any of those categories, add The Cinema Guild to your list of independent film distributors.\n\nCohen Media Group\n\nThe Hobels arenât the only filmmakers turned independent film distributors.Â\n\nFor nearly 15 years, Charles S. Cohen, the executive producer behind the Oscar-nominated Frozen River, has been heading up the Cohen Media Group. The CMG keeps its distribution focus on North America for both contemporary and classic cinema.\n\nWhy does Cohen Media Group concentrate its distribution efforts solely in North America when many of the indie distribution companies weâve covered so far make it a point to distribute globally?Â\n\nThey say itâs so that the CMG team can âdevote their best efforts towards each filmâs fullest potential.â Something for filmmakers to keep in mind when researching low budget film distributors.\n\nEntertainment One\n\nFilmmakers who regardless want to work with an indie distribution company that has a larger scope may want to consider Entertainment One.Â\n\nKnown as eOne, this distributor works on a global scale, with partners across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. In fact, eOne can offer prospective clients over five-hundred broadcast partners across more than 150 territories around the world. As its site states, eOne has the âreach of a studio and the flexibility of an indie.â\n\nThe Film Collaborative\n\nNot quite sure what independent film distributors do or what film distribution entails? The Film Collaborative can help.\n\nThe Film Collaborative is a non-profit indie distribution company that aims to help filmmakers through the distribution process. Its three central taglines â âfilmmakers first,â ânon-profit, on purpose,â and âwe donât own your rightsâ¦ you do!â speak to The Film Collaborativeâs focus on championing the indie filmmaker.\n\nNeed a reliable entertainment payroll solution? Explore here.\n\nFilmRise\n\nAdd FilmRise to the list of indie distribution companies that were founded by film producers. For the last decade, producers Danny Fisher, Jack Fisher, and Alan Klingenstein have been bringing both films and television shows to audiences across the world.\n\nWith an impressive library of more than â50,000 licensed and originally produced scripted and unscripted feature films and television episodes across all genres,â FilmRise has partnered with many of the biggest global names in distribution:\n\nAmazon\n\nBET+\n\nBritBox\n\nCNN\n\nCrackle\n\nDiscovery\n\nHBO\n\nHoopla\n\nHulu\n\nInvestigation Discovery\n\niTunes\n\nKanopy\n\nNetflix\n\nOvation\n\nPeacock\n\nPBS\n\nPluto\n\nRakuten TV\n\nRedbox\n\nRoku\n\nSamsung TV Plus\n\nShowtime\n\nSling\n\nStarz\n\nStirr\n\nTubi\n\nVizio\n\nVudu\n\nWaipu.tv\n\nXbox\n\nXumo\n\nFreestyle Digital Media\n\nFreestyle Digital Media is a boutique distribution groupâ¦\n\nWhen they hear the word âboutique,â some filmmakers and indie producers may think small. But when it comes to low budget film distributors, it can also mean a company that carefully curates its content. That pays more time and attention to the filmmakers.\n\nThat is the experience filmmakers get with Freestyle Digital Media. An indie distribution company that emphasizes the veteran experience of its team, FDM provides additional Ã la carte options, including:Â\n\nCreative advertising\n\nDirect email marketing\n\nPiracy protection\n\nPublicity\n\nSocial media services\n\nWith this individualized approach, filmmakers receive a tailored-made distribution experience should they partner with Freestyle Digital Media.\n\nGood Deed Entertainment\n\nGood Deed Entertainment is an Ohio-based indie distribution company that works in multiple entertainment spaces both in terms of genre and medium.\n\nThat being said, if youâre a horror or sci-fi filmmaker, Good Deed may be of particular interest on account of its Cranked Up Films division. Through it, the company distributes âhigh concept horror, grounded sci-fi, and speculative fiction.âÂ\n\nIt also develops and produces genre content, so filmmakers may want to consider connecting with GDE before their next horror or sci-fi project goes into production.\n\nGravitas Ventures\n\nWhen researching independent film distributors, youâll likely come across industry terms such as âall-rights distributor.â This means that should you partner with one of these indie film distributors, theyâll do all the legwork to distribute your film via theaters, television, streaming, you name it.\n\nEnter Gravitas Ventures, which is one of the independent film companies on our list that is an all-rights distributor. For more than fifteen years, Gravitas Ventures has been helping filmmakers and indie producers get their movies seen across the globe through multiple mediums, including various forms of video-on-demand.\n\nGreenwich Entertainment\n\nViewing audiences watch documentaries in growing numbers. Great news for documentarians!Â If you have a doc youâre looking to put out through indie film distribution, you may want to partner with a company that specializes in this type of film.\n\nFounded in 2017, Greenwich Entertainment focuses on documentary features. But for all you scripted narrative filmmakers out there, donât leave Greenwich Entertainment off your list of film distributors! It offers distribution options for you as well.\n\nGunpowder and Sky\n\nGunpowder and Sky is an indie distribution company that champions filmmakers early in their careers, a huge plus for anyone who might be trying to distribute their first or second film.\n\nEstablished in 2016, Gunpowder and Sky has distributed more than forty features and series, typically with a focus on âpop culture, social issues and larger-than-life personalitiesâ from both emerging and established creatives.Â\n\nIFC Films\n\nIFC Films has been one of the leading independent film distributors for more than twenty years. That fact speaks to how nimble it has been in the face of ever-changing entertainment platforms and mediums.\n\nIFC Films champions the independent filmmaker, but it also has a division called IFC Midnight that focuses specifically on genre films such as sci-fi and horror.
