        "meta_description": "Outlaw Jim Stokes robs a stagecoach using stuffed dummies as \"accomplices\". Pursued and wounded, he collapses by a water hole. He is found by a kindly miner and nursed back to health by the miner's daughter, Nell. Stokes falls in love with Nell and decides to return the money and reform. Nell and Stokes are married, but the very next day, as he is preparing to send the stolen money to the Overland Stage Company, he is recognized and again must flee, this time with Sheriff Walsh in hot pursuit. Walsh catches up to Stokes in a border town where he takes him prisoner and confiscates the money Stokes had intended to repay, but promptly loses it at the roulette table. Stokes strikes a bargain with the sheriff--he steals the money back, and in return, the sheriff sets him free and gives him the chance to start a new life with his bride.",
