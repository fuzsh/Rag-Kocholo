New documentary DEVI follows her story as she leads a grassroots movement pressuring the Nepal government to follow through on transitional justice commitments and shines a vital spotlight on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence (CRSV) survivors in Nepal and worldwide. In 2022, Think-Film platformed Devi on an international stage at the major Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Conference (PSVI) in London where she gave a keynote address to a room of policymakers and civil society. We also secured her testimony as the first-ever entry from Nepal in the UN Digital Book \"Voices of Survivors of Conflict-Related Sexual Violence and Service-Providers\", bringing Nepal back into the conversation. This #InternationalDayForTheEliminationOfSexualViolenceInConflict, we stand in solidarity with Devi Khadka in her mission to pursue justice for all wartime rape survivors in Nepal. DEVI resonated strongly with audiences in Canada, becoming a Top 20 Audience Favourite at Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. The film is now coming to New Zealand's Doc Edge film festival!
