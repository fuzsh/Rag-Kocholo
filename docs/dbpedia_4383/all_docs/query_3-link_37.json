        "text": "Vaidas reminded me that today is the 5 year anniversary of my blog. I had totally forgotten that, but somehow remembered the 5 year anniversary of the Mankiw/Krugman dispute. I feel burned out, so I’m going to relax today and do a file dump of stuff I wrote a while back.\n\nHere are all the films I saw at the theatre last year, including a bunch that were made years earlier (warning; don’t see them based on my recommendation):\n\nIn the Mood For Love (Hong Kong) 4.0 This 2000 Wong Kar Wai film was voted by film critics the best movie of the past 20 years. Indeed one of only two recent films to even make the Top 50 of All Time list (along with Mulholland Drive.)\n\nFallen Angels (Hong Kong) 3.9 A 1995 film from Wong Kar Wai’s golden age (1991-2004.) How many modern directors produced 7 masterpieces in a row? One of the coolest films ever made and just a blast to watch on the big screen. I enjoyed it more the second time, as I went in understanding there wasn’t much plot.\n\nHer (US) 3.8 Thought-provoking on many different levels. Almost flawlessly directed. The one must see film of 2013.\n\nSunless (French) 3.8 A 1982 Chris Marker philosophical meditation on Iceland, Africa, Tarkovsky’s Stalker, cats, Vertigo, and above all Japan. How good is it? The narrative is dense and elliptical and comes at you fast. Enough of the ideas hit home with me to make it work, but it would take a much brighter person (Tyler Cowen?) to review this film properly.\n\n20 Feet from Stardom (US) 3.5 A very enjoyable documentary about backup singers. Was Merry Clayton’s singing on Gimme Shelter the high point of 1960s rock?\n\nPost Tenebras Lux (Mexican) 3.5 Less than the sum of its parts, but the parts are occasionally sublime. Especially the intro. Had very vivid dreams after this film—is there any higher praise?\n\nAmerican Hustle (US) 3.5 Perhaps because I’m nostalgic for the 1970s (which may go down in history as the decade of “peak privacy”) I really enjoyed this film, despite its Hollywood formulaic style.\n\nThe Grandmaster (Hong Kong) 3.4 I tend to get bored with kung fu fight scenes, but this was better than most. We’ll have to wait ten years for the “director’s cut” to find out how good this film actually is (I either under or overrated it.) Its length was sharply reduced for American audiences and it shows. Like Post Tenebras Lux it is less than the sum of its parts, but it does have some glorious parts.\n\nInside Llewyn Davis (US) 3.3 A typical Coen brothers film. Made with great skill, but more interesting as a concept than in execution.\n\nStoker (Korean/American) 3.3 Nowhere near as interesting as Park’s “Vengeance Trilogy,” but skillfully directed. Spike Lee remade Oldboy? I think I’ll pass.\n\nDesign for Living (US) 3.3 A Ernst Lubitsch comedy from 1933. Not as good as his best work.\n\nBad Blood (French) 3.3 Leos Carax’s second film, from 1986. The director gave a very interesting talk after the film. Very good at using visuals and sound to create certain moods. He was strongly influenced by silent films.\n\nLike Someone in Love (Japanese/Iranian) 3.3 Kairostami continues to do films in non-Iranian settings. A few echoes of Ozu in this intriguing film set in Tokyo.\n\nSpring Breakers (US) 3.2 Almost a campy masterpiece, but the film gradually ran out of steam. I don’t think the director had a clear plan. But maybe that’s for the best, as it was an entertaining ride.\n\nThe Enforcer (US) 3.2 This 1951 noir was the first film to use mob terms like “contract” and “hit.” The NYT review in 1951 called the film extremely violent, which seems almost laughable today. There is virtually no violence at all! I knew that 1950s people would be shocked by the sex in modern movies, but they’d be even more shocked by the violence. What would shock us about the films of 2075? Raoul Walsh actually directed, but someone else was credited.\n\nA Touch of Sin (China) 3.2 A bit of a disappointment considering the director. It’s hard to make a movie work when it is a collection of mostly unrelated short stories. Only a few directors can pull that off, and Jia Zhangke doesn’t seem to be one of them.\n\nOblivian (US) 3.2, Very nice visuals, and reasonably entertaining, but it’s still a sort of “tweener.” Way too derivative to be a creative Sci-fi breakthrough like 2001 or Solaris, and not nearly as entertaining as Star Wars. Watch on big screen or not at all.\n\nAll is Lost (US) 3.1 Somewhat interesting story of a man lost at sea. I would have preferred an ending like Bruegel’s painting “Fall of Icarus”, but that’s not feel good enough for Hollywood.\n\nL’Amour (French) 3.0 I could never get interested in this film, despite the fine acting and direction. Everyone else thinks it’s a great film, so I suppose it is.\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street (US) 3.0 Shows how the power to make any sort of film a director wants gradually leads him to indulge in filming mindless drug-fueled orgies with beautiful actresses because . . . because he can. Also about corruption on Wall Street (not just Hollywood), although it’s not really clear in the film exactly what these guys did wrong (in a legal sense.) Presumably insider trading and unethical marketing practices. Martin Scorcese could make a 3.0 star film in his sleep, and he did. At least it’s never boring.\n\nNight Across the Street (Chile) 3.0 A highly intelligent film but it never really connected with me.\n\nUpstream Color (US) 2.8 The director of Primer has another intellectual sci-fi effort, but the final product just doesn’t seem as interesting as the concept.\n\nMuseum Hours (Austrian) 2.8 It seemed like a film version of a Max Sebald novel. But not nearly as good.\n\nThe Man With a Camera (Russian) 2.8 This “classic” silent film from 1929 left me cold. It seemed too much like single stunt stretched out to 90 minutes. Number 8 on the all time best film list””and rising.\n\nLevel Five (French) 2.8 An old Chris Marker film/documentary on the Battle of Okinawa, where more than 200,000 Japanese died. Convinced me that dropping the bomb on Hiroshima was the right move.\n\nBlue Jasmine (US) 2.7 One of Woody Allen’s weaker films. The characters were not at all interesting, and the plot was somewhat predictable. I don’t recall any great lines. Some nice music and the lead actress was excellent.\n\nAnna Karenina (British?) 2.5 Probably even worse than 2.5, but since I’ve never read the novel, and the acting was pretty good, I was somewhat interested in what was transpiring.\n\nThe Hobbit, pt. 2 (New Zealand) 2.2 A big disappointment. While watching this I found it hard to remember why the LOTR was so good. The director got almost everything wrong.\n\nI don’t have much time anymore for serious reading, but I did get through two long biographies of artists (Cezanne and Titian, two of my absolute favorites). The most noteworthy novels I can recall reading last year were My Struggle (pt. 2) by Knausgaard, The Museum of Innocence by Orhan Pamuk, Your Face Tomorrow by Javier Marias, and Correction by Thomas Bernhard (an older book). All four authors have very distinctive voices, but I’d say the Knausgaard was my favorite. Can’t wait for the rest of the volumes.\n\nIn an earlier post I made an off-hand comment about the explosion of pop music creativity between 1963 and 1969, and got a lot of criticism. Let’s take a look at the Rolling Stone top 50 pop songs by year:\n\n1955-56: 5\n\n1957-58: 2\n\n1959-60: 2\n\n1961-62: zero\n\n1963-71: 34\n\n1972-74: zero\n\n1975-1991: 7\n\n1992-2013: zero\n\nI don’t know why they didn’t include songs from an earlier period, perhaps it was just meant to be top pop songs from the rock era. So there’s a burst of creativity about the time Elvis bursts on the scene, then a slack period, then an explosion around the time the Beatles/Dylan/Stones show up (plus lots of Motown songs, etc.) BTW, I believe the artists of today are at least as talented as those of the 1960s (probably more so)–that’s a different issue.\n\nThis is common in the arts, although not usually quite so pronounced. Here’s the top 50 films of all time (actually 52), according to a poll of 846 film buffs:\n\n1925-34: 7 (these are all silent, 5 are from 1925-27)\n\n1939-41: 3\n\n1948-49: 2\n\n1950s: 12\n\n1960s: 15\n\n1970s: 7\n\n1980s: 1\n\n1990s: 3\n\n2000-01: 2\n\n2002-13: zero\n\nSo in both cases the 1960s dominate, but much more in music. That’s partly because the film list is global—different countries had their artistic peaks at different times. The music list just looks at English language songs. It’s partly because the music list ignores the period before 1955. But both lists have very few modern works. Is that just boomer nostalgia? Partly, but not entirely. To me it’s also the “Renaissance phenomenon.” When there are cultural and technological developments that open up vast new vistas of artistic possibilities, and economic conditions that allow people to explore those places, they fill up rapidly. De Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, etc, quickly “invented” or “discovered” all the best picture ideas (Borges says the two words have the same meaning), forcing their successors to work in the margins (hence “mannerism.”) David Lynch (the most recent director on the film list) is a sort of mannerist. So is Radiohead. The first flowering of film was the peak of the silent era, 1925-27. The next was the post-WWII explosion of stylistic possibilities. And then with Apocalypse Now and Stalker in 1979 it all ended. Maybe that’s why Coppola burned out. He saw there was no future.\n\nDidn’t Kurt Cobain say he’d been born too late? (The good songs were taken.) Right before killing himself? He’s got the most recent song on the list.\n\nBe careful what you wish for. I’m in the slightly embarrassing position of having my favorite song and film top the two critics lists. You’d think that would be great, but now that it’s happened I’d much rather pick some unconventional choice; an obscure film from Taiwan, Thailand or Turkey. Or a great schlocky film like Titanic. Or a quiet modest film like Local Hero that others overlook. But I can’t, I’m as boring as that composite face generated by averaging 1000s of faces on a computer.\n\nPS. I saw Tarkovsky’s Mirror for the second time at Harvard last night. It will probably top my 2014 list.\n\nTags:"
