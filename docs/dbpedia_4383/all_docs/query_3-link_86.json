        "text": "In 2020, remember the time when people were ready to wait for the covid-crisis to get over? When we sipped hot coffee while watching the news on our televisions, as if it was about someone else and not me or us, the immediate network?\n\nAnd then do you remember exactly the date or week when everyone started showing up online? Work From Home, remote working, etc. suddenly became words of the year. I am not able to put dates to these but it looks like really long back to me somehow!\n\nAnd then, at one point I found myself thinking that when everything is making the switch to the virtual world, why should Film Festivals stay behind? Almost all major Film Festivals across the globe which were scheduled to be held in 2020 or after started turning virtual;\n\nFurther back in time, during the spring of 2020, the “We Are One: Global Film Festival”—spearheaded by Tribeca Enterprises and more than twenty other festivals including Cannes, the Venice International Film Festival, and the Toronto International Film Festival—ran on YouTube from May 29 to June 7, 2020. Sundance Film Festival, which had a year of pandemic festival planning at its disposal, took place digitally from late January to early February of this year. Through its Sundance-built platform that included a smartphone festival app, it streamed premieres online and held a few physically distanced in-person events.” according to the University of California Press.\n\nThe process of making the transition from physical to online may have been difficult for film festival circuits, but the end results of this transition, according to most people involved in the process, are actually positive. Thanks to virtual reality, footfall for film festivals has actually increased, even more than what they were in pre-pandemic times because the logistical costs are greatly minimized.\n\nIf the transition to an online festival increases convenience for the audience, then why should it not be made permanent?\n\nEven if the pandemic had not caused worldwide lockdown, logical analysis says that film festivals would have anyway made the transition, at least to the point of a physical-virtual hybrid format. This is because as the brand of a film festival, say for eg., London Indian Film Festival gains more repute, it will try to diversify its guest list, including people from as many countries and regions as possible. This kind of inclusion will raise curiosity for cinema enthusiasts of those places. virtual presence then enables them to attend the festival without any traveling costs or hassles.\n\nThe biggest cause of celebration in a virtual film festival is the fact that these festivals can be held through simple and easily navigable software like zoom or YouTube. In fact, the entire process of a virtual film festival can now be done through simple tools that any tech-savvy person can understand.\n\nFrom creating an informational website for a festival (via wx.com etc) to streaming it (Facebook Live or Youtube or Instagram). From creating an online ticket counter (Match My Talent Events, BookMyShow, insider) to identifying a video broadcasting player (IBM Cloud Player, Vimeo, and JW Player) and all the way to securing payment gateway for ticket sales (Vimeo OTT, for example, has a payment gateway that transforms your live content into a full-scale subscription service or even pure payment gateways like Razorpay), to eventually conducting a film festival virtually, has never been easier, I say.\n\nLike all great inventions, virtual film festivals combine the best of both the worlds- you get to witness the next generation of outstanding cinema, gain new perspectives, as one does in a film festival, but apart from that, with virtual, you get to show up in film festivals of other countries (which is a whole other experience in itself), without actually having to travel to those countries!\n\nI know! Film Festivals are supposed to be experienced, with friends, not watched on a screen alone, like a regular binge-watcher. But, as it turns out, attending a film festival isn't that different from attending a physical film festival. After all, the final destination is a movie screen.\n\nYes, you don't get the actual 3D experience of attending a physical event, you don't get to meet the various kinds of people you might have met otherwise…but, there is also the element of infinite scale. You’re basically watching a lineup of premieres. It’s exciting!” said Manmeet Dawar, our Project Lead, when I had asked her for her sense of it all.\n\nSomeone said to me that it's a lonely experience. That got me thinking. Is it or is it not? Well, one can invite other people and friends, and have a shared viewing experience. In the time of the pandemic, when the virus is attacking and re attacking our society in a kind of a- more dangerous progression, experiencing a virtual film festival, with friends through remote viewing, seems like a very safe and prudent choice. And I do sincerely feel that being with friends is fine but eventually, I watch a film by myself. It really doesn’t matter if I know anyone else in the physical crowd or not, isn’t it?\n\nAnd oh, the Q&A with filmmakers. This goes to a whole new intimate level in virtual that can never be possible in a physical event. Very few filmmakers are actually invited to them and so a very limited direct interaction happens with indie filmmakers there. What is a film without really getting the world of the person who brought the story to us!\n\nFestival fraternities and circuits have realized that halting a film fest is not commercially viable; sooner or later they will have to make the shift to virtual. This is especially true of high-profile film festivals like Cannes or SXSW or Sundance or Venice. This is because such film festivals actually decide the competitors and winners in even bigger commercial awards like the Oscars. For example, if a film A has had a great round at SXSW, Cannes, and London, it is very likely that it will be on the top contenders' list for Oscars too.\n\nTherefore, if film festivals are halted altogether, then there will be a huge void in the Oscar season. Obviously, big money-making machinery like the Oscars cannot be stopped…it must go on!\n\nNot that the grass isn't greener on the other side!\n\nBesides the profit, no travel required for participants also translates to greater diversity in the audience. When supported by an internet connection, a film festival leads to the inclusion of a more ethnically diverse audience, and therefore, more appreciation for independent filmmakers.\n\nApart from all these benefits, a virtual film festival incurs fewer costs than a physical film festival. Decor, lighting, food, personnel costs, all such costs are minimized.\n\nAnd oh, the masterclasses and talks. It's no more about the budget feasibility of the festival to fly in the experts, regardless of where they come from. Everyone has to eventually log in from their living rooms and hence the scale of knowledge and expertise possible in a virtual film festival is a treasure!\n\nThe positive implications of a virtual film festival are universal and timeless. Its viability outlasts the CoVid pandemic. Then why shouldn't they replace the current norm?\n\nWith this being so clear in my head, we did take the responsibility to put together the unbiased video festival, Malhaar again this year as its season II. The show must not just go on but also thrive, not just survive!\n\nAbout Malhaar Film Festival: Malhaar is a vision to create a window of global vernacular cinema- Cinema which is vernacular in its concept, approach, communication and the minutest of its details yet universally relevant, relatable and retainable. This is possible when endless narratives come up as a direct result of cinema appreciation. This is possible when we stop figuring out what ‘sells more’. Malhaar is that space where a democratic approach to the business of making cinema is shaping up, where the “business” of film festivals is fine-tuned, and where the conversation of a truly global narrative is being explored.\n\nIn 2021, where humans across the globe have experienced life like never before, Malhaar helps to form a collective consciousness around a range of topics and themes. Bringing together a community of content creators and audiences who are sensitive, expressive and respectful of mankind.\n\nThis year, Malhaar unfolds to observe different moods that a creator can wrap a theme into. Hence, a warm welcome again to both - the amateurs and the experienced creators, to narrate their untold stories in their own language."
