        "text": "Producers Berry Meyerowitz and Jeff Sackman announced on Tuesday that they’re launching Quiver Distribution, a new independent distributor focused on acquiring and marketing high concept, commercial films across all media in the United States and Canada.\n\nFor the last two and half years Sackman and Meyerowitz have collaborated with producers to help finance and sell 14 feature films to the likes of Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Sony and Paramount. These films have featured actors such as Nick Nolte, Tim Roth, Josh Radnor, Toni Collette, Donald Sutherland, Bob Saget, Richard Dreyfuss, Damian Lewis, Greg Kinnear and Ben Platt, to name a few.\n\nThe company will launch with two films already in the wings. The first, “The Fanatic,” is a suspenseful thriller starring John Travolta. Quiver plans to release that film in theaters on September 6. The other stars Nicolas Cage and Laurence Fishburne in an action thriller titled “Running With the Devil.” The film is currently slated for September 13.\n\n“Our collective experience and relationships will bring value to all constituents,” Meyerowitz and Sackman said in a joint statement. “Quiver Distribution will capitalize on the emergence of new platforms by providing entertaining and star driven films for consumers, no matter where they choose to watch them.”\n\nQuiver marks a return to distribution for both Meyerowitz and Sackman, who have both enjoyed successful careers in the independent film business.\n\nMeyerowitz sold his company, Phase 4 Films, to Entertainment One in 2014, and became head of its U.S. Film business. Sackman was the first President of Lionsgate Films and then launched and led THINKfilm until its sale in 2006. He subsequently ran Tajj Media Services for 10 years, which focused on consulting, producing and executive producing in the film and television industry.\n\nThe executives joining Meyerowitz and Sackman in this new venture are Sean Monson, who will oversee finance & operations, and Larry Greenberg, who will oversee acquisitions and U.S. distribution. Quiver Distribution has offices in Toronto and Los Angeles."
