        "text": "kleptomaniac\n\nYauch looks to film distribution (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iea16e1ac946e5235df4e79f169c1c9e6)\n\nNEW YORK -- Beastie Boy Adam Yauch is launching indie film distribution and international sales company Oscilloscope Pictures, a new arm\n\nof his music and film production outfit, Oscilloscope Laboratories. Former ThinkFilm vp David Fenkel is set to run the unit.\n\nYauch and Fenkel plan to acquire narrative and documentary features from festivals for release in the U.S. and provide funds to complete and\n\nrelease unfinished films.\n\nThe pair, who worked on Yauch's Beastie Boys docu \"Awesome! I Fuckin' Shot That!\" at ThinkFilm, will complete all postproduction and\n\nmarketing work from OL's downtown Manhattan production space. Fenkel's fellow ThinkFilm alumni Dan Berger is joining them in the venture.\n\n\"We're kind of winging it,\" said Yauch, who has recorded albums, produced \"Awesome\" and created ads out of the 8,000-square-foot office\n\nsince 2002. He plans on releasing two to 10 films in the first year, and without any outside financial backing for the self-financed venture,\n\nhopes to make deals where the filmmakers share the risk.\n\n\"We're not looking to throw big (minimum guarantees) at filmmakers or have lawyers throw numbers at us demanding a big minimum P&A,\"\n\nYauch said. \"It's been the downfall of many distributors.\"\n\nInstead, Yauch hopes to craft deals with \"real back-end participation\" for the filmmakers, and possibly outside film financing for marketing if\n\nthe film warrants it.\n\nOP will handle its own theatrical distribution and control all marketing materials in-house but likely will partner with an outside distribution\n\ncompany for home video releases.\n\nIts first theatrical release, set to be announced within the next month, will hit theaters by the summer.\n\nFenkel said many campaigns will incorporate an indie music label-style, DIY approach in keeping with the Beastie Boys' style of connecting with fans.\n\nFriis gal\n\nFrom o-scope news (http://www.oscilloscopepictures.com/news.php):\n\nAdam Yauch announces Oscilloscope Pictures,\n\na new indie film distribution company\n\nFormer THINKFilm exec David Fenkel to run division\n\nNew York, NY (February 4th, 2008)  Beastie Boys member and filmmaker Adam Yauch has expanded his music and film production company, Oscilloscope Laboratories, with the addition of Oscilloscope Pictures, a full-service film distribution company. The new movie division will release independently produced English and foreign language films and documentaries into the U.S. theatrical marketplace, as well as handle international sales. In its first year, Oscilloscope will look to acquire completed films at festivals, and find projects in production, where the company can provide finishing funds.\n\nOscilloscope plans to handle all creative and production work in-house using its post-production facilities and recording studio to design all theatrical, DVD, international and online marketing campaigns including the creation of posters, trailers, DVD packaging and authoring, and delivery. In addition, Oscilloscope will open up their facilities to support filmmakers in completing their films.\n\nDavid Fenkel, who most recently spent 6 years at THINKFilm in the domestic distribution and the international sales departments as Vice President, handled many of THINKFilms recent critical and box office successes, including: the Academy Award-winner, BORN INTO BROTHELS, Academy Award nominees HALF NELSON and SPELLBOUND, and Yauchs AWESOME; I SHOT THAT!. Reporting directly to Yauch, Fenkel will oversee acquisitions, domestic distribution and international sales while also expanding Oscilloscopes staff. Fenkels colleague from THINKFilm, Dan Berger, has already started working at Oscilloscope Pictures.\n\nYauch says I grew up around indie record labels, where a handful of people would put their heads together and figure out what needed to be done to put out a record. The approach of this company is very much in the same vein, but well apply that ethic to producing and releasing films. I want Oscilloscope Pictures to be a home for innovative films and filmmakers. We can offer them a place to finish their films and a way to release them.\n\nFenkel says My time at THINK showed me how to release films with the right balance of a strategic publicity campaign and an aggressive promotional grassroots campaign, while always investing wisely in both traditional and untraditional advertising. Its essential that on each and every title we make sure our films are handled with the same artistic energy and smarts with which they were made. The team at Oscilloscope Laboratories, under Adams guidance, has been producing cool content for many years and with their artist relationships we are already in contact with a handful of projects that would be perfect for us to release. I am excited to mesh the different aspects of what Adam and I do to help launch this new breed of film label.\n\nOscilloscope Pictures plan on launching their first theatrical film in the first half of this year. So check your local listings for theaters and showtimes.\n\nAbout Oscillope Laboratories\n\nOscilloscope Laboratories is the umbrella company owned and operated by Adam Yauch. Its a NYC -based recording studio, film production and distribution company, and post-production facility."
