        "text": "Canadian Film Distribution Company\n\nLevelfilm, stylized as levelFILM, is a Canadian film distribution company based in Toronto, Ontario. The company was founded by David Hudakoc and Michael Baker in 2013,[1] and later acquired two other Canadian distribution houses: Search Engine Films in 2018[2] and KinoSmith in 2021.[3] It has released more than 200 titles, with a focus on independent Canadian films.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nlevelFILM was founded by Michael Baker and David Hudakoc in August 2013, who had previously worked together at the U.S. distribution house ThinkFilm.[4] The company's first acquisition, Chen Kaige's Caught in the Web, was announced along with the company's creation.[1]\n\nIn 2017, the company sold a majority stake to Laurie Venning, a Canadian investor, entrepreneur, and producer.[5]\n\nAt the 2018 Berlin Film Festival levelFILM announced its acquisition of another Canadian distributor, Search Engine Films (SEF). John Bain, the head of SEF at the time, joined as the company's new Head of Distribution.[2] SEF's library was folded into levelFILM's existing catalogue, including titles such as Equals, Kilo Two Bravo, and Mary Shelley.\n\nIn 2019, it was announced that levelFILM and U.S.-based distributor Good Deed Entertainment had struck a four-year output deal, ending in 2023.[6]\n\nAt the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival levelFILM announced a multi-year output deal with the U.S. company Greenwich Entertainment, beginning with The Capote Tapes.[7] Later in the fall, levelFILM acquired KinoSmith, and folded in its CEO, Robin Smith, as the new Head of Factual. Simultaneously, the company partnered with Smith's other venture, the documentary financing and distribution house Blue Ice Docs, a subsidiary of the Blue Ice Group.[3]\n\nIn April 2022 the company was listed at number 9 in The Globe and Mail's list of the 22 most influential people in the Canadian film industry.[8]\n\nDuring the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival levelFILM signed an exclusive output deal with Bleecker Street. Mafia Mamma, directed by Catherine Hardwicke, is set to be the first release of the deal and is scheduled for April 2023.[9]\n\nIn October 2022, levelFILM released Eternal Spring, which was selected to be Canada's official submission to the 95th Academy Awards for the Best International Feature Film category.[10] The film was also eligible for Best Documentary and Best Animated Feature, but did not make the shortlist in either category.[11]\n\nReleased films\n\n[edit]\n\nList of films released by levelFILM Year Canadian Release Date Title Director Genre 2014 April 11, 2014 That Burning Feeling Jason James Comedy, Romance May 30, 2014 Hotel Congress Michel Kandisky, Nadia Litz Romance, Comedy July 18, 2014 Lawrence & Holloman Matthew Kowalchuk Comedy, Drama November 21, 2014 Rosewater Jon Stewart Drama, Thriller 2015 March 6, 2015 Two Men in Town Rachid Bouchareb Comedy, Drama April 17, 2015 Sunshine on Leith Dexter Fletcher Musical, Drama May 5, 2015 Soul Boys of the Western World George Hencken Documentary, Music May 15, 2015 Wet Bum Lindsay Mackay Drama, Kids & Family August 21, 2015 Bang Bang Baby Jeffrey St. Jules Sci-fi, Romance August 18, 2015 Learning to Drive Isabel Coixet Comedy, Drama September 4, 2015 Before We Go Chris Evans Drama, Romance November 13, 2015 Kilo Two Bravo Paul Katis War, Thriller December 4, 2015 I Smile Back Adam Salky Drama December 11, 2015 People Places Things Jim Strouse Comedy, Romance 2016 January 8, 2016 The Liberator Alberto Arvelo Drama, War March 15, 2016 Glassland Gerard Barrett Drama, Thriller March 18, 2016 Coconut Hero Florian Cossen Comedy, Drama July 15, 2016 Equals Drake Doremus Romance, Sci-fi August 19, 2016 Standing Tall Emmanuelle Bercot Drama September 23, 2016 The Girl King Mika Kaurismaki Drama November 4, 2016 Morris from America Chad Hartigan Comedy, Drama November 11, 2016 Jean of the Joneses Stella Meghie Comedy, Drama November 29, 2016 Dégradé Arab Nasser Drama December 6, 2016 The Great Gilly Hopkins Stephen Herek Kids & Family, Comedy 2017 February 9, 2017 Urban Hymn Michael Caton-Jones Drama, Musical May 9, 2017 Sled Dogs Fern Levitt Documentary May 19, 2017 Alone in Berlin Vincent Perez Drama, War August 25, 2017 Bushwick Cary Murnion, Jonathan Milott Action, Adventure September 22, 2017 Don't Talk to Irene Pat Mills Comedy, Drama December 1, 2017 Wexford Plaza[12] Joyce Wong Comedy, Drama December 1, 2017 Suck It Up[12] Jordan Canning Comedy, Drama 2018 January 12, 2018 Never Steady, Never Still[13] Kathleen Hepburn Drama January 16, 2018 The Devout Connor Gaston Drama, Sci-fi March 16, 2018 I Can Only Imagine Andrew Erwin, Jon Erwin Drama March 30, 2018 Journey's End Saul Dibb War, Drama June 22, 2018 Hearts Beat Loud Brett Haley Music, Drama June 22, 2018 Octavio Is Dead!
