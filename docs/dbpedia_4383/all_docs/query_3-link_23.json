        "text": "by Eugene Hernandez\n\nTHINKFilm has added Ross Kauffman & Zana Briski‘s “Born Into Brothels” to a roster of new docs to be released by the company. Mark Urman, the company’s head of U.S. theatrical distribution, announced the deal on Friday and revealed a full list of docs recently added to the THINKFilm slate.\n\n“Born Into Brothels” won the documentary audience award at Sundance this year and has also won festival awards at numerous fests since, including Seattle, Atlanta, Cleveland, Nashville, Full Frame, Sydney and others. The company will release the movie in association with HBO/Cinemax Documentary Films in December. The company also worked with HBO/Cinemax on its releases of “Spellbound” and “The Agronomist.”\n\nKauffman & Briski’s film is a portrait of the children of prostitutes living in Calcutta’s red light district. Briski gave cameras to the children and taught them how to capture their world. Andrew Herwitz of the Film Sales Company brokered the deal with THINKFilm’s SVP of acquisitions and business affairs Randy Manis and VP of acquisitions Daniel Katz."
