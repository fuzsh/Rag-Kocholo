William 'Bill' Henry Lancaster (November 17, 1947[1] â€“ January 4, 1997) was an American screenwriter. He was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Burt Lancaster and Norma Anderson. He developed polio at an early age, leaving one of his legs shorter than the other.

Lancaster's best known work is his adapted screenplay for John Carpenter's The Thing. He also penned the original screenplays for The Bad News Bears films.

He is featured in the documentary The Thing: Terror Takes Shape, found on the collector's edition DVD of The Thing. Lancaster states that he did not think Who Goes There? was a "great" story, but that he responded to the tale's sense of claustrophobia and paranoia. The documentary is dedicated to him because of his death shortly after it was filmed.

Lancaster was married to Kippie Kovacs, daughter of the comedian Ernie Kovacs.[2][3] They had one child, daughter Keigh Lancaster.[4].

Lancaster died at the age of 49 due to cardiac arrest.
