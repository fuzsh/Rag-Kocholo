LOS ANGELES â€” The Century City condominium where Oscar-winning actor Burt Lancaster made his home for nearly two decades is for sale at $2.65 million.

The 18th-story unit is found within Century Towers, a high-rise originally built as apartments in 1964 and converted to condos in 1976. Lancaster bought two units that year and combined them into one residence of 2,800 square feet.

Designed in Spanish-style by architect Hal Levitt, the condo has white stucco walls, tiled floors and hand-painted counter tiles. Thick beams span the length of the common areas, which include a great room, a dining room and a center-island kitchen.

The master suite has his and hers bathrooms and closets for a total of two bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms. Floor-to-ceiling windows bring in city, mountain and ocean views.

The condominium came up for sale in 1996, two years after Lancaster died at 80, and sold the following year. More recently, it changed hands in 2001, records show.

Lancaster appeared in more than 70 films, including "From Here to Eternity" (1953), "Judgment at Nuremberg" (1961), "The Birdman of Alcatraz" (1962) and "Field of Dreams" (1989). He won an Academy Award for "Elmer Gantry" (1960) and shared another as co-producer of the film "Marty" (1955).
