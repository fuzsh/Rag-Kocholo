Los Angeles is filled with modern homes, rustic homes, beach homes, and hilltop homes, but there’s nothing quite like its Old Hollywood legacy homes. From Frank Sinatra’s family abode to Katharine Hepburn’s former stomping grounds, plenty of storied residences have been on the market in the past few years. Now, the past home of actor Burt Lancaster is up for sale.

Lancaster was first known for playing tough-guy-with-a-heart-of-gold roles and starred in movies alongside Ava Gardner, Deborah Kerr, Clark Gable, and more. He was a four-time nominee for Best Actor at the Academy Awards and won the honor once. Around the same time Lancaster shot to fame, this sweet Hollywood oasis he would one day own was being built by famed architect Max Maltzman.

Listed for $2.399 million, the 2,800-square-foot home is elegant yet modest and currently owned by a designer. There aren’t grandiose chandeliers or stately columns, but instead, the design is livable and bright. It’s been thoroughly updated inside, so although the house was built in 1941, it’s already almost in 2021 with style that is so completely “now.” The open kitchen and living area exude chic simplicity with a white color palette and contemporary light fixtures. Glass doors lead out from there to the terraced gardens, patio, and pool.

It’s a perfect size for many house hunters with four bedrooms and four bathrooms. All that it’s missing now is a new owner to enjoy this revamped piece of Hollywood history.
