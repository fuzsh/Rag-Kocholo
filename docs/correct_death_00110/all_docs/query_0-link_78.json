It is not an actual glossy photo or studio-issued snapshot, and we have no idea of its origin. It came to us via an estate lot purchased from the son of an extraordinary older gentleman who collected Hollywood memorabilia. We are only making it available to other fans who may find it of interest or want to frame it, put it in their locker, use it in a collage, etc. The picture shown is the actual picture, though a company logo may have been water-marked on it to prevent image theft (it doesnâ€™t come like that, of course). The approximate measurement represents the actual dimension of the image, though there may be a caption or short border surrounding it in some cases. It will be mailed in an envelope with cardboard backing.",
