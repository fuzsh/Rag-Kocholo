        "text": "Academy award winning leading man, his rugged athletic appearance landed him his first movie role as a tough guy at the late age of 32. He was on the way with a series of adventure movies such as ‘The Crimson Pirate’ and then proved his acting ability in ‘From Here to Eternity.’ ‘The Sweet Smell of Success’ followed and then the blockbuster ‘Elmer Gantry,’ based on the life of Billie Sunday the famous Chicago Evangelist, where he won the best actor Oscar. He continued acting in his later years while earning his fourth Oscar nomination with ‘Atlantic City.’ Burt Lancaster set up his own production company, hiring experts to direct his career. He produced ‘Marty’ which won an Oscar in 1955. Often remembered for the leading role in ‘Birdman of Alcatraz,’ he suffered a debilitating stroke and died from a heart attack three years later in his Los Angeles home. The prolific actor was gone at the age of eighty but not after a career where he was linked to hundreds of movies in various roles, either as a writer, director, producer, a major starring actor, simply making a guest appearance on a TV mini series and even doing special roles as a narrator. Burt Lancaster was a one-man gang. He was cremated with his ashes interred in Westwood Memorial Park with a small square ground plaque marking the burial spot. In accordance with his wishes, he had no memorial or funeral service."
