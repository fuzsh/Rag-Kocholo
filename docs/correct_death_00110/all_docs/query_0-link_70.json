        "text": "The Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Charles Schnee\n\nAdaptation: Robert Smith and John Bright\n\nBased on the Play “Beggars Are Coming to Town” by Theodore Reeves\n\nDirector: Byron Haskin\n\nCast: Burt Lancaster, Lizabeth Scott, Kirk Douglas, Wendell Corey\n\nCinematography: Leo Tover\n\nMusic: Victor Young\n\nStudio: Paramount\n\nRelease: December 31, 1947\n\n“I Walk Alone” uses a tried-and-true noir narrative to create a film which explores the complex emotions of a quartet of three-dimensional humans, all broken and all looking for safety in very different, often dangerous, ways. I love when noir films are willing to get this messy and grey about their leading ensemble.\n\nBurt Lancaster stars as Frankie, a guy just out of jail after doing 14 years for a major alcohol robbery during prohibition. His best friend Dink (Kirk Douglas) promised him half of the spoils when he got out of prison, and then proceeded to open a giant, popular nightclub in town with the money. When Frankie comes calling for his 50%, Dink sends his girlfriend Kay (Lizabeth Scott) to get to know him and see how serious he is about getting the money. Dink has also hired all the other guys from the gang in his club, including Dave (Wendell Corey), who has cooked the books so that it’s impossible for Frankie to get what he earned, but is now second guessing his move and sympathizing more with Frankie.\n\nThe film is mostly shot in the club, and I was not surprised to find out that it had been adapted from a play. Luckily, the filmmakers lean into the claustrophobia of the location beautifully throughout, with rooms hidden within other rooms – a veritable labyrinth lorded over by Dink, who shuffles different members of the cast into different isolated locations in order to keep himself in control at all times. This backfires when he sends Kay to have dinner with Frankie to “get to know him,” thinking he can just use all the information she learns against him. But Kay and Frankie genuinely form a bond quickly, and watching her empower both herself and Frankie is one of the highlights of the film.\n\nScreenwriter Charles Schnee (“They Live By Night”) isn’t much interested in the actual money plotline – but he is fascinated in exploring the ways the main four characters react to it. Note how Dink appears fully engaged and loving with Frankie, but slowly degrades until he’s essentially a rabid animal lashing out to protect the business he has built. I love that he uses taxes and capitalism to strip Frankie of what should be rightfully his. And Frankie is essentially a live wire for most of the film, certain of what he deserves until realizing letting go of him will be the thing that genuinely sets him free. Most interesting of all is Kay, who thinks she knows who she is and who Link is… only to be forced into a position where she needs to reinvent herself from the ground up or be fated to be the other woman in Link’s loveless marriage for the rest of her life.\n\nSure, some of the dialogue is oh-so on the nose. Frankie especially has some clunkers in the first act, like when he sees shadows that look like prison bars and ominously intones that he can never escape. But in general, Schnee is hugely successful at making us care deeply about Frankie, Kay and Dave’s fates… and hope that Link won’t stoop to the depths he eventually does.\n\nOf course, it helps that the cast is sterling all around. Lancaster and Scott were reteamed here after sharing ample chemistry in “Desert Fury,” and here it is even more potent. Lancaster oozes charisma, and this is the best noir performance I’ve seen so far from Scott. She is especially impactful in her scenes with Douglas, who leans hard on his inherent likability early before becoming very, very dangerous. Corey (who was also in “Desert Fury”) is excellent here playing a torn man, wisely underplaying his big scenes – after his death, the movie misses him.\n\nLancaster was on a roll other actors rarely get close to. Here are the noir films from this era which he starred in, starting with his first major role ever: “The Killers,” “Brute Force,” “Desert Fury,” “I Walk Alone,” “Sorry, Wrong Number,” “Kiss the Blood Off My Hands” and “Criss Cross.” I mean… holy shit. This and “Hands” are the least remembered today, but I really like both and think they merit rediscovery. And he’s absolutely fantastic in each one of them.\n\nDirector Byron Haskin is more remembered today for his adventure and special-effects driven films like “War of the Worlds,” which is why I was surprised at how good he was in cerebral thriller mode. His collaboration with Cinematographer Leo Tover (“Dead Reckoning”) is outstanding – the club at the center of the story is both sprawling and claustrophobic. I love the way scenes switch from tense to intimate with a simple lighting change, and Dave’s murder on an empty city block is beautifully rendered.\n\nI wish that there were more noir films like “I Walk Alone.” Movies that embrace mess and keep twisting ethical questions around and around as the characters figure things out along with the audience. Though not one of Lancaster or Scott’s best remembered films, I recommend tracking it down – there is much to love here.\n\nScore: ****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Lucille Fletcher\n\nBased on her radio play\n\nDirector: Anatole Litvak\n\nCast: Barbara Stanwyck, Burt Lancaster, Ann Richards\n\nCinematography: Sol Polito\n\nMusic: Franz Waxman\n\nStudio: Paramount Pictures\n\nRelease: September 1, 1948\n\nAwards: Stanwyck was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar but lost to Jane Wyman in “Johnny Belinda”\n\nPercent Noir: 90%\n\nThe ending of “Sorry, Wrong Number” is one of the most iconic in film history, so much so that even if you’ve never heard of the film, if I described the plot you probably could tell me what happens in the finale. Unlike films like “The Sixth Sense” or “The Usual Suspects,” whose ends rely on twists, “Sorry, Wrong Number” simply refuses to let the audience off the hook, painting a black-as-pitch ending which leaves the viewer stunned by its ballsiness.\n\nThat aspect of the film is why it’s one of the most famous in noir. But if we ignore the ending, I have to say that the entire package does not hold up as well as I wanted it to. In my eyes, there are several fundamental problems that the movie, for its many attributes, cannot overcome.\n\nBut first, the story… in case you were somehow unaware. Queen of noir Barbara Stanwyck plays the bedridden Leona Stevenson, making busybody calls to fill her evening until her husband Henry (Burt Lancaster) comes home. Thinking she’s hearing a crossed line, Leona overhears two men preparing to murder a woman in her home that night. Many, many phone calls later, Leona realizes that the person about to be murdered is her… and that her husband is behind it all.\n\nThe film is based on an incredibly popular radio play by Lucille Fletcher, who adapted it into a screenplay. The original play, which starred Agnes Moorehead, is only a half hour and is genuinely gripping and engaging all the way through. In expanding (and expanding (and expanding)) the storyline to feature length, Fletcher is not only throwing in a lot of hot air, but accidentally placing a spotlight on coincidences and plot holes. They worked in the short drama because the script was already moving on to the next thing, but not here.\n\nFurther, the radio play works because it is intentionally claustrophobic. We can feel the walls closing in around Leona. In the film, director Anatole Litvak (“The Long Night”) goes to extreme pains to open up the world. The camera swoops all through Leona’s house. Leona’s calls always go through to crowded, expansive rooms. Flashbacks expand the world further. It seems to me that, in jumping through all these hoops to legitimize turning the radio play into a film, the filmmakers had completely lost track of why the play worked in the first place. Oops.\n\nAnd then there’s Stanwyck’s casting as Leona. As previously established in most of my articles on this Web site, I love Stanwyck. But here I think she’s gravely miscast. Not because she can’t play a horrible person, because she obviously can… and do it well. She’s miscast because I don’t for a moment buy her as an invalid. And yes, there a vagueness to how sick Leona actually is, but Stanwyck conveys this inner strength in all her characters that comes through here… when it shouldn’t. It feels like she is putting on a show instead of actually inhabiting Leona, and her increasing paranoia as the movie continues equates to her going further and further over the top. It’s a real shame. Then again, Stanwyck was nominated for an Oscar for her performance here, so I assume I’m in the minority.\n\nThe final fundamental problem I have here is the story’s predictability. The film is 89 minutes (it feels longer) and by minute 3 any viewer of moderate intelligence will be able to figure out that Leona’s husband Henry is behind everything. Plus, there’s the poster. And then we wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for the reveal. To her credit, Fletcher tries to throw in some red herrings and also hints at a larger conspiracy at play… but none of these are engaging enough to keep us from focusing on Henry’s guilt. Plus, he’s played by Burt Freaking Lancaster, so you know he didn’t show up for a nothing role… even if, ultimately, the performance and character still come across as thankless.\n\nFor all these problems, and they are myriad, I didn’t hate “Sorry, Wrong Number.” Honestly. There are a lot of small things that the film gets exactly right, especially in the character details, that makes me appreciate both Fletcher and the ensemble’s talent. And though I think Litvak took the wrong approach for this adaptation, I must admit that the location work and the atmosphere of the apartment look great, thanks in no small part to his collaboration with cinematographer Sol Polito (“The Long Night”).\n\nAnd then there’s the fact that the film fills a bunch of walk-on and small roles with African American actors, including the cutest little girl ever as a lost child in a police station. As sad as it is to admit it, I’d gotten completely used to seeing these all-white films noir… and it was such a pleasant surprise to see diversity here, even if they are background characters.\n\nI think that, at some point, every noir enthusiast finds his or her way to “Sorry, Wrong Number.” And, dear reader, I genuinely hope that you end up liking it much better than I do. That finale still packs a punch… but the rest of the movie leading up to it is a swing and a miss. Did I just mix metaphors? I don’t know sports…\n\nScore: **\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Robert Rossen\n\nBased on the novel “Desert Heat” by Ramona Stewart\n\nDirector: Lewis Allen\n\nCast: Lizabeth Scott, John Hodiak, Burt Lancaster, Mary Astor, Wendell Corey\n\nCinematography: Edward Cronjager & Charles Lang\n\nMusic: Miklos Rozsa\n\nCompany: Paramount Pictures\n\nRelease: August 15, 1947\n\nPercent Noir: 50%\n\nIt’s not often that I would describe a movie as hysterical, but that’s the exact way to describe “Desert Fury.” I’ve never seen a film noir like this before. Actually, strike that, I’ve never seen a film from this era like this before… it’s one of a kind.\n\nBefore we get into the storylines and characters, I want to broach the subject of LGBTQ representation in the film. So often in movies of this era, and noir in particular, there are characters that are supposed to be LGBTQ, but often this is done subtly enough that it does not impact the storytelling. If you are watching the film and get it, you get it. If not, you don’t notice and move on. Even the most obvious examples, like “Gilda” or “Laura,” work if you ignore the gay material. Not so with “Desert Fury.” This film only works if you understand that certain characters are in a LGBTQ relationship, and though the filmmakers try to blur certain things (probably thanks to the Hays Code), this is the first film I’ve seen that comes thisclose to explicitly stating the obvious. Which, all things considered, is pretty fucking cool.\n\nThe film is centered on a love pentagon. First up we’ve got Eddie (John Hodiak), a bisexual small-time crook currently in a relationship with more crooked crook Johnny (Wendell Corey) but finding himself more attracted to Paula (Lizabeth Scott). Paula resembles Eddie’s dead wife (ick!), Eddie very clearly had something to do with that woman’s death (double ick!!)… and Eddie was also banging Paula’s mother Fritzi (Mary Astor) for years prior to the film (triple ick!!!). Paula and Fritzi have their own weird incest-y thing going on between them, with casino-owner Fritzi determined to have her daughter not follow in her footsteps. Also in play is police officer and nice guy Tom (Burt Lancaster), who used to date Paula but she lost interest.\n\nThis is because Tom is impotent. The movie never says this outright, but one of his character’s first scenes is him riding a horse only to be thrown. Paula watches, turned on, until someone tells her that, due to an accident, Tom can never ride horses well again. It’s no flashing neon sign with the word “impotent,” but it might as well be.\n\nPart of the fun of watching “Desert Fury” comes by just how far the filmmakers go to underline what is really happening in any given scene. At one point, Paula asks Eddie how he met Johnny. Eddie’s response? “It was in the automat off Times Square. About two o’clock in the morning on a Saturday. I was broke. He had a couple of dollars, and we got to talking. He ended up paying for my ham and eggs. I went home with him that night, and we were together from then on.” In the finale, Paula asks her mother for a kiss, and Fritzi gives her one. On the lips. That lingers a second too long for it to be innocent.\n\nIt’s a testament to how enjoyable all this is that I still like the film despite its two leads being terribly miscast. Scott’s character is 19 going on 45 thanks to some bad hair and make-up choices (to be fair, she was 25 at the time), and she never gets across that innocence the character needs in order for her corruption to resonate. Hodiak is also incredibly out of his depth. I’ve only seen him before in “Lifeboat,” which he almost sunk (I couldn’t help myself), and here he has zero chemistry with Scott or Corey. Which is, you know, kind of an essential. Frankly, he’s just not good here.\n\nThe dead weight is thankfully lifted by the rest of the ensemble. Astor in particular seems to understand that there aren’t many roles like Fritzi and knocks every one of her scenes out of the park, creating an overbearing mother for the ages. Corey gets across his character’s danger and possessiveness in spades, and nails his big speech in the third act. I’m surprised Lancaster got the good guy role instead of Hodiak’s part, but he acquits himself quite well here and shares ample chemistry with Scott, turning what could have been a nothing role into something quite memorable.\n\nAnother interesting thing about “Desert Fury” is that it is a color noir – a rarity for the time period – and that this choice is entirely justified. Cinematographers Edward Cronjager (“The Capture”) and Charles Lang (“The Big Heat,” “Sudden Fear”) work hard to create a feeling of isolation even in the sumptuous desert photography. The world feels like a technicolor triumph of location and mood, underlined by the excellent costumes by Edith Head. Lang is a noir superstar, as is director Lewis Allen, who made “Suddenly!” and “Illegal,” among many others. This feels different from Allen’s other genre films – more heightened, more visceral – he’s a long way from his subtle, refined work in the haunted house masterpiece “The Uninvited,” for example.\n\nBut that change works wonders for the film. The climax, which sees a three car chase through the desert towards an infamous bridge we’ve been waiting the entire movie to revisit, sees voiceover flashbacks of important dialogue we’ve already heard as the characters sweat and stare intensely just off camera. It feels more like Douglas Sirk than noir, though the fact that Allen could manage the tight-rope act between these two styles merits high praise.\n\n“Desert Fury” deserves a rich cult following with midnight showings. I’m not surprised it hasn’t garnered it yet – the movie was finally (finally!) released on DVD and Blu-Ray here in the US last year after being out of distribution for decades. I suspect this had something to do with the print needing restoration and it being more difficult because the film is in color, but who knows why. The point is this – the film is here, it’s queer and deserves a wider audience. Watch it with a dry martini in your hand and several friends who enjoy camp and Burt Lancaster’s dreamy eyes.\n\nScore: ****\n\nThe Criterion Odyssey\n\nSpine #994\n\nWriter/Director: Bill Forsyth\n\nCast: Peter Riegert, Burt Lancaster, Peter Capaldi, Denis Lawson\n\nCinematography: Chris Menges\n\nMusic: Mark Knopfler\n\nCompany: Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox\n\nRelease: February 17, 1983\n\nCountry: UK\n\n“Local Hero” is a movie of moments – ones you look back on long after the film has ended and smile about. Those visuals or lines of dialogue are where writer/director Bill Forsyth gets humanity precisely right. The film isn’t interested in telling us a story so much as capturing a mood… a desire… a melancholy. In this, it succeeds. For better or worse.\n\nA beachfront town in Scotland is designated the perfect area to create a gigantic oil refinery for the Knox Oil company. CEO Felix Happer (Burt Lancaster) sends one of his key executives, the boringly handsome Mac (Peter Riegert) to scope the area out and help make the sale of the town a reality. Once there, Mac meets up with two other boringly handsome guys who help him figure stuff out – the innkeeper/banker Gordon (Denis Lawson) and Knox employee Danny (Doctor Who). If you’re anything like me, you may have trouble telling them apart in any given scene, but so does Felix when he comes to visit, so I guess that’s part of the joke. Anyway, the magic of Scotland sweeps Mac off his feet… and I don’t even need to finish this sentence for you to know the rest of the logline.\n\nEven as I write that, it’s important to underline that Forsyth uses an expected structure to tell a story that isn’t interested in that structure at all. What Forsyth is more concerned with is playing with his more eccentric characters and keying in on his theme of nature & conservation.\n\nAnd when the movie is focusing here, it is at its very best. There’s a delightful little model of the town and beach that Mac is shown when he gets to Scotland that belongs on either a miniature golf course or in a Bond villain’s lair. There we meet an expert on marine life named Marina (Jenny Seagrove), who has webbed feet, can swim underwater for minutes at a time and may just be a mermaid. Later, the entire deal comes down to a man named Ben (Fulton Mackay) who not only lives in a hut on the beach… he actually somehow owns the beach itself.\n\nCharacters like these, along with Lancaster’s Happer, are so interesting that you wish that the movie was solely focused on them. And before I make this critique, I will write that I feel like Mac’s character functions both as a straight man and as a critique on the usual straight man cliché. After all, he might fall in love with Scotland, but at the end he heads back to Texas, spending the movie’s ending very, very alone. And he’s not the one who gives his boss the great idea about conservation. Actually, he’s pretty impotent all the way through.\n\nLike I said, I suspect that this is a subtle jab at the usual straight man character by Forsyth, which is all well and good… but that doesn’t mean that Mac is any more interesting. For most of the running time, he’s just there. Riegert is bland throughout and cannot do a good impression of a drunk human. He gets one good scene where he realizes that his lunch is the rabbit he hit with a car then subsequently adopted and named… and the aforementioned ending… but that’s it. Copy and paste any other actor in his role and it would have been fine.\n\nWhat’s more, there isn’t just one of Mac, there are three! Gordon is zzz as well, while Danny at least gets a sweet romance with the possible mermaid. I’d much, Much, MUCH rather be watching any of the other cast having fun, and almost all the moments I remember from “Local Hero” don’t involve these characters, which is a shame.\n\nThen again, I’m beginning to think that the necessity of a straight man as the viewer’s eyes into an eccentric, off-kilter world is just a myth. Did we really need Stingo in the “Sophie’s Choice” movie or Nick in “The Great Gatsby”? Hell, keeping John in the “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil” adaptation all but sunk it. Even in comedies, all you want are the scenes with Lucy and Ethel… the moments Ricky walks in and his eyes bug out are afterthoughts. Give the viewer an engaging character and we’ll go along for the ride. Ciphers will be obvious to us from moment one.\n\nAnd I’d even argue that the powerful, sad ending works not because we identify with Mac’s character and feel for him. It works because we care about that town and work, because we all understand that feeling of touching something great and retreating. Our hearts don’t break for him – they break for us.\n\nOkay, tangent over, because I fear I’m talking you out of watching “Local Hero,” because you definitely should watch it. It’s one of those films that is so great and so perfect in so many ways that those few problems it has feel magnified tenfold. But for most of its running time, I was just sitting there like a silly fool with a big ‘ole smile covering my face. And I so appreciate that Forsyth has more on his mind than just a regular comedy – the issues and humanity he explores throughout resonate deeply and with great purpose. This is the first film I’ve seen from the beloved filmmaker, and it definitely won’t be the last.\n\nCover\n\nMark Thomas offers up a lovely, eye-catching cover that captures the mood and essence of the film quite well. I love his use of color here and would happily get the poster.\n\nI award it five bunny rabbits out of five.\n\nEssay\n\nThis appears to be Johnathan Murphy’s first essay for the Collection, and it reads much like someone really trying to impress his boss. Lots of dollar words and sentences that take 20 words when 7 would have been more than enough. I like a lot of the ideas Murphy introduces, but struggle with his execution.\n\nI award it three seashells out of five.\n\nExtras\n\nCriterion went all out.\n\nThere’s an excellent commentary from the soft-spoken Forsyth and the more talkative scholar Mark Kermode. It’s not my favorite commentary, but I’m so happy that Criterion is regularly producing them once again.\n\nA conversation between Forsyth and critic David Cairns, who starts the conversation by calling “Local Hero” “a perfect movie.” It comes across about as awkward as you think it does. The new information is fine, but you’d be better off listening to the commentary… though a Michael Powell cameo (?!) makes it worth watching.\n\nA documentary about cinematographer Chris Menges that covers “Local Hero,” but also so many other great movies in his filmography. A highlight of the disc.\n\nThree very repetitive short documentaries from the ‘80s (yes, one is a television show and one is a one-on-one interview, but still) that cover the making of “Local Hero.” No major new nuggets to be seen, though hearing Lancaster be incredibly excited about the project… and also calling Forsyth “Mr. Forsyth”, made me smile from ear to ear.\n\nA meh trailer.\n\nI award them five falling-apart beach dwellings out of five.\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Daniel Fuchs\n\nBased on the novel by Don Tracy\n\nDirector: Robert Siodmak\n\nCinematographer: Franz Planer\n\nMusic: Miklos Rozsa\n\nCast: Burt Lancaster, Yvonne De Carlo, Dan Duryea\n\nRelease: February 4, 1949\n\nStudio: Universal Pictures\n\nPercent Noir: 100%\n\nIt was the first or the second year of the annual TCM Fest in Los Angeles, and I was an eager ticketholder. It was the first show on Saturday morning, and I was running late because the train on the subway stalled out between stations. The various TCM screenings are spread across Mann’s, the Chinese and the Egyptian Theater. I figured that, even though I was arriving a few minutes late, since it was the 10 a.m. screening I would have no problem getting into my first choice of film. Then it was sold out. So was my second choice. Frustrated, I looked at the three other options and, sight unseen, decided to go into “Criss Cross” because… I’m not sure why. There were a few seats left in the front row and I entered the theater just as the Universal logo popped up.\n\n84 minutes later, the movie ended, the lights went up and could not move. I could barely breathe. The movie I had just seen was one of the transformative cinematic experiences of my life – and it started me on this path as a film noir fan/obsessive.\n\n“Criss Cross” is a great movie, but it’s also a perfect encapsulation of everything a film noir fan could want, expect or desire in a motion picture. If you want to explain to someone what film noir is, this is a movie you could put on and the viewer would come away knowing exactly what the genre represents and how great it can be. All that, and yet it still manages to feel fresh and surprising after multiple viewings.\n\nIn case you can’t tell, I love this film.\n\nThe movie takes place out of chronological order, but I’ll synopsize in it. Steve Thompson (Burt Lancaster, never more smoldering) returns to Los Angeles under the guise of helping out at his family home, but in reality wants to reconnect with his ex-wife Anna (Yvonne DeCarlo). They do reconnect (physically), but Anna is also dating (and soon married to) local mafioso Slim (Dan Duryea, because of course). Steve’s got a job working for an armored truck company, and when Slim begins getting too suspicious, Steve comes up with an armored truck robbery idea as an excuse (as one does), which is usually nearly impossible. Steve plans on escaping after with Anna and the money, but where do her loyalties really lie?\n\nThe trifecta of Lancaster, DeCarlo and Duryea are absolute gold as the leads. I suspect that director Robert Siodmak (“The Spiral Staircase”) was eager to reteam Lancaster with his “The Killers” co-star Ava Gardner and it didn’t work out, because DeCarlo is physically similar, done up in Gardner’s style and is lit and shot the same way Siodmak did in that film. Gardner would have been great here, but that doesn’t diminish how wonderful DeCarlo is. She never breaks character in her love scenes with Lancaster like a lesser actress would, essentially winking to the audience that she’s going to fuck him over. Because of this, her coldness in the final scene comes as a huge wallop – we expected it, but it still hurts a hell of a lot.\n\nLancaster and Duryea were both old hats at this type of flick at this point and could have phoned it in, but the great hardboiled dialogue of Daniel Fuchs’ (“Panic in the Streets”) script seems to have energized them. It helps that the characters are more dimensional than most comparable archetypes. Though Duryea’s Slim comes off badly in the first few scenes, subsequent moments underline character over danger, which (again) make that final scene all the more impactful.\n\nFuchs’ script is fascinating structurally. We have a long prologue leading into what we assume will be the climax of the movie (the armored car heist) before flashing back to how we got to that moment. But then Fuchs surprises us by having the heist happen much earlier than expected – a little past the midpoint – instead allowing plenty of space to explore the consequences of Steve’s actions during the heist. The entire hospital sequence is dripping with tension, and then we think we are building to a big, elaborate, emotional conclusion. We don’t get that, though – Steve realizes that Anna has double crossed him then, seconds later, Slim walks in and shoots them both to death. The end.\n\nThe bluntness of the murders is truly shocking. Siodmak even frames the moment so that we’ll expect more. As the gun fires, he cuts to a close-up of Slim’s face, not the murdered lovers, and we see smoke rising into frame. We’ve seen similar shots hundreds of times in crime films, and it almost always means that it’s a fake-out and the person we think is shooting has actually been shot from behind. But nope! Siodmak is wisely using the language of editing to surprise us, so when he cuts to the bodies, it takes a moment for us to process what we’re seeing. And then, suddenly, “The End.” It’s brilliant.\n\nThe rest of the movie looks incredible too, never moreso than the heist sequence. Collaborating here with cinematographer Franz Planer (“The Chase”), the heist is certainly a highlight of Siodmak’s most impressive filmography. The smoke that fills the entire frame, the men in masks, the explosions going off at odd points in frame unexpectedly… it’s a master class in how to build and pay off suspense. What’s more, it’s not all clinical – Steve’s character makes an important emotional choice here and Siodmak makes sure to allow time for that impact to come across.\n\nIn case you can’t tell, I love “Criss Cross.” If we are measuring a good movie by Howard Hawks’ quote: “three great scenes, no bad ones,” then the movie succeeds in spades. Here is a film I know I’ll carry with me through my life, revisiting it every few years and loving it each time.\n\nScore: *****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Leonardo Bercovici\n\nAdaptation: Ben Maddow & Walter Bernstein\n\nAdditional Dialogue: Hugh Gray\n\nBased on the novel by Gerald Butler\n\nDirector: Norman Foster\n\nCinematographer: Russell Metty\n\nMusic: Miklos Rozsa\n\nCast: Joan Fontaine, Burt Lancaster\n\nRelease: October 30, 1948\n\nStudio: Universal\n\nPercent Noir: 70%\n\nAt long last we have come to the best title in the history of film noir. Think about it… does it get any better than “Kiss the Blood Off My Hands”? I don’t think so. But is the movie itself more than just that name? After all, it didn’t garner much attention when first released, despite newly minted A-lister Burt Lancaster’s presence, and it seems to have fallen through the cracks of history. Unavailable on any of the film noir compilations from Universal, you can only get it on one of those cheaply made DVD-Rs. Turns out, it’s actually great… with a fantastic beginning that grabs you and never let’s go.\n\nI’m surprised the first ten minutes aren’t more well-remembered, because the sequence is a doozy. Drunk ex-GI Bill (Lancaster) accidentally kills someone he sucker punches in a bar in the UK. Immediately pursued by the cops, he races across the fog-ridden city with the law at his heels, finally climbing up the skeleton of a building and into the window of a sleeping Jane (Joan Fontaine). She wakes up and he sorta kinda holds her hostage, but Jane senses that he’s not a danger to her. Despite several opportunities to get the police, she allows him to stay and leave when he wants to. Immediately smitten, Bill finds her at her job the next day and Jane notices the sparks too. But, partially because he’s a former POW of the Nazis and partially because he’s the hero in a film noir, Bill has a short fuse and gets violent in front of Jane, assaulting three men and getting arrested. She breaks things off and he’s sentenced to six months in prison.\n\nWhen released, they reconnect and Bill tries to stick on the straight and narrow to prove himself worthy of Jane. That gets especially difficult when a man who witnessed Bill kill the man in the bar finds Bill and blackmails him into taking part in a medical supply robbery.\n\nUnfortunately, despite the movie having a kinky side – Bill is stripped, shackled and whipped by the police as punishment for the assault – no bloody hands are kissed during the runtime. Still, a shirtless Burt Lancaster is always a pleasure, so thank you filmmakers.\n\nThough the story follows the broad strokes of “Kiss of Death,” which was released a year prior, “Kiss the Blood From My Hands” has its own identity. I love the twist of having Jane stab Bill’s blackmailer to death, “Dial M For Murder”-style, and the bittersweet choices the characters make in the finale are quite powerfully staged and acted.\n\nPerhaps the reason the film isn’t remembered much today is because it puts much more emphasis on romance than a normal noir. The beating heart of the movie is Bill’s relationship with Jane, and if we don’t buy into their attraction and, later, love for one another, then the movie does not fundamentally work.\n\nLuckily, Fontaine and Lancaster spark a fine coupling onscreen. It’s quite an odd match at first, with their acting styles quite different. Fontaine’s natural fragility doesn’t seem like it would mesh with Lancaster’s roughness, but somehow… it just works. Lancaster’s soulful eyes and Fontaine’s warm smile help. Their first few scenes together are touch and go, especially an ill-conceived one at a zoo where Bill has a breakdown (the animals are in cages… and so was he! Metaphor!). But when the duo go on a date to the racetrack together, the chemistry takes off. You engage with them as a couple, and because of that you buy the difficult conversations they have with one another in the third act.\n\nThe director, Norman Foster, is little-remembered today aside from the Orson Welles produced “Journey Into Fear,” which many scholars insist Welles ghost-directed even though they have no evidence. Foster was a journeyman director, working on several Mr. Moto films (unseen by me) and some of the best installments of the Charlie Chan franchise (“Charlie Chan at Treasure Island”). The promise he showed elsewhere is on display in most every scene here. I’ve already written about that opening – and must give cinematographer Russell Metty (“The Stranger,” “Ride the Pink Horse”) credit too – but I would be remiss if I didn’t spotlight the romantic scenes either. Foster takes great advantage of location shooting in these scenes to bring a natural atmosphere forward, contrasting it beautifully with the stylized night scenes.\n\nThe screenplay is also well done, despite involving the work of four screenwriters, and that’s only the credited ones. I like how strong they make Jane when she needs to be, whether fending off the blackmailer with those scissors or standing up to Bill when he’s flying off the handle. This is one of those great examples of a “good girl” heroine who is just as interesting and engaging as any femme-fatale character.\n\nA quick shout out to Miklos Rozsa for his sublime score, which balances the tone of noir and romance perfectly. It helps to keep the tone balanced throughout, and his love theme here is one for the ages.\n\nLook, I know getting your hands on “Kiss the Blood Off My Hands” is rough. It’s not streaming anywhere, and the DVD costs as much as several other DVD and Blu-ray noir sets. And yet… it’s worth it. Here is a hidden film noir treasure that engages you emotionally thanks to the wonderful romantic pairing at the center, but also stuns as a visual tour de force. That opening sequence should be studied in film schools as a great example of how to build suspense and action over a prolonged period of screentime. It’s one of my favorite discoveries so far on the Odyssey.\n\nScore: ****1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Richard Brooks\n\nStory: Robert Patterson\n\nDirector: Jules Dassin\n\nCinematographer: William Daniels\n\nMusic: Miklos Rozsa\n\nCast: Burt Lancaster, Hume Cronyn, Charles Bickford\n\nRelease: June 30, 1947\n\nStudio: Universal Pictures\n\nPercent Noir: 60%\n\n“Brute Force” is a very good movie that has not aged as well as it should through no fault of its own. In the same way “The Big Heat” served as a blueprint for revenge thrillers and “The Asphalt Jungle” did the same for heist movies, this film has been ripped off and copied by so many other prison dramas that it can’t help but lose some of its impact.\n\nBurt Lancaster stars as Joe, one of a troupe of inmates who plot a prison break to escape the clutches of sadistic head of security Munsey (Hume Cronyn). Just from reading that sentence, you can probably think of over a dozen movies and television shows that share a nearly identical logline. In the end, it comes down to the little details in the telling, and “Brute Force” has a weird sense of male intimacy to it that makes the sudden shocks of violence all the more impactful.\n\nThis stems from a decision by screenwriter Richard Brooks (who wrote and directed “In Cold Blood”) to make all the men in the group planning the breakout genuinely good men stuck in a horrible situation. They either didn’t commit the crime they are in prison for or committed an ethically correct crime, and as a result it’s easy to root for them and immediately buy into their bond. But while it works well as a shorthand on a story level, I must admit that it’s a bit of a cop out. Was it a studio note that the men had to be good guys even though they were in prison? Unnecessary flashbacks to their crimes don’t do much but pad the running time. It would have been a different movie, but I think I would have liked it better if we had no idea what their backgrounds and crimes were.\n\nI’m going to get my other major issue out of the way upfront, and that’s the subplot involving a battle for power between Munsey and two other prison executives. While it does inform some of the decisions made that impact the prisoners, this subplot adds little to the movie. I understand its inclusion – the men in the prison are honest and genuinely want to help one another, but those who run the prison are a bunch of scorpions stinging one another – but that doesn’t make it a black hole that envelops 20 minutes of screentime. Munsey is the best thing about the movie, so just focus on him. He’s enough.\n\nThose problems out of the way, let’s get to the good stuff, which is myriad. The prison itself is an astonishing location, mixing very real location work for the exteriors and nightmareish, angular interiors that are obviously inspired by German Expressionism. The contrast between the two shouldn’t work, especially considering how gritty many of the events that take place inside the prison are… and yet it does. Director Jules Dassin (“Rififi”) and cinematographer William Daniels (“Lured”) thread the needle beautifully, creating images that linger specifically but also as an overall mood long after the film ends.\n\nThey also create some terrifying moments that seem much too edgy for a movie that had to be approved by the production code. There’s the climactic prison break attempt, but I’m thinking specifically of the sequence where a group of men hunt down a prisoner in a metal shop. While only hinting at the extreme violence that is happening just offscreen, Dassin manages to create a prolonged five-minute sequence that is so tension-filled it is almost impossible to watch. Seriously. When the guys came out with the blow torches, I almost needed a minute to catch my breath. The explosive ending to the sequence, which sees the man crushed to death like a bug under a shoe, is causing my skin to be covered in goosebumps just at the memory.\n\nThe cast is mostly filled with decent character actors doing solid work that is aided immensely by Brooks’ screenplay, which does a gangbusters job at defining smaller characters by making their introductions interesting and distinctive. That said, the entire enterprise is grounded by two astonishing performances from Lancaster and Cronyn.\n\nLet’s deal with Lancaster first. This was his second film as lead after “The Killers,” and he is again introduced shirtless and wet. I’m detecting a pattern here… but not complaining. His work is soulful and deeply introspective. I’m actually surprised he pulls it off as well as he does considering he was so new to film. I guess that’s why he’s a movie star. His work in the second half of the film, with the resignation on his face about what he has to do, is also quite powerful, and the savagery in his final battle with Cronyn’s character is… wow.\n\nSpeaking of Cronyn, despite the hundreds (hundreds!) of variations on this character we have seen more recently, his performance still holds up. It’s something about how Dassin frames him – keeping him slight in frame instead of making him overwhelming like in a horror movie. He seems like the type of guy who could be overpowered by any of the prisoners, which makes his sadistic actions and power all the more shocking and impactful. Most importantly, Cronyn doesn’t overplay it or chew on any scenery even though it would have been so easy to – which is why he remains dangerous from beginning to end.\n\nSo what if subsequent prison break movies may have eclipsed “Brute Force” in terms of quality? It’s still a damn good piece of entertainment worthwhile thanks to its fascinating visual style and lead performances. Even though you know where the movie is going long before it gets there, the tragedy of the ending still affects you emotionally, which is the sign of a movie well made.\n\nScore: ****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Clifford Odets & Ernest Lehman\n\nBased on the Ernest Lehman story\n\nDirector: Alexander Mackendrick\n\nCinematographer: James Wong Howe\n\nMusic: Elmer Bernstein\n\nCast: Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, Susan Harrison, Martin Milner\n\nRelease: June 27, 1957\n\nStudio: United Artists\n\nPercent Noir: 30%\n\nI don’t want to know any of the characters in “Sweet Smell of Success.” Further, if any of them walked into a room where I was, I would more than likely exit immediately. And yet, while watching them make the lives of everyone around them miserable, I could not look away. Here is one of the most engaging character portraits in the history of cinema – just expect to feel that noir grime covering you after it’s all over.\n\nTony Curtis, all over-greased hair and sweaty hands, stars as Sidney Falco, a middling press agent who is being squeezed out by influential New York columnist J.J. Hunsucker, who refuses to publish anything in his columns about Falco’s clients. The reason? Hunsucker has told Falco to break up a romance between Hunsucker’s sister Susan (Susan Harrison) and a local jazz musician Steve Dallas (Martin Milner). So Falco pings from place to place in New York City like a pinball, sinking lower and lower in search of a way to please his master.\n\nNeither Falco or Hunsucker have a soul, but Falco teases himself late in the movie that he might grow one. Falco wants everything Hunsucker has, and Hunsucker relishes the fact that Falco would do anything for him. The men need one another in the most fucked up of ways, destroying lives because they can and taking pleasure from what little power they have. You don’t have to squint to see all sort of sexual undertones to their relationship, but Hunsucker’s weird, incest-y relationship with his sister also merits mention.\n\nCurtis is so good as Falco that it becomes difficult to separate him from this persona in other films. Perhaps the best dramatic moment of his entire career comes in a scene where he attempts to blackmail another popular columnist in order to get a smear item published about Dallas. Curtis flaunts that he knows the columnist had an affair with a cigarette girl, then invites himself to sit at the columnist’s table… with his wife. All the while Falco keeps shoving the piece of paper with the item at the columnist, until the columnist simply calls Falco’s bluff. “Do you have something to say to my wife?” the columnist demands, making a scene before confessing everything to his none-too-surprised wife. Curtis doesn’t have much dialogue in the scene (he nails every line), but watch his reaction shots. When the columnist is making a scene, his eyes nervously ping pong from the columnist to the wife to the other restaurant patrons to the staff, suddenly powerless and embarrassed. It’s incredible acting, and I doubt many others could have pulled it off.\n\nLancaster wears big glasses that somehow warp his handsome appearance, accenting the sharpness of his cheekbones and making him seem almost inhuman as a result. He speaks “logically” in almost every scene, which makes him all the more dangerous. As soon as I finished the scene where he destroys what begins as a simple meeting between himself, Susan and Dallas, I watched it again to note all the small ways Hunsucker grabs power from the other characters. Lancaster is astonishing here.\n\nPoor, poor Harrison and Milner always get the short end of the stick in conversation about the film because Curtis and Lancaster are just that good. But both give excellent performances in their respective roles – Harrison at being a “kept” woman (albeit kept by her brother) desperate to find a way out, and Milner at barely concealing his rage at Falco and Hunsucker.\n\nThe movie was written by two of the best writers of the twentieth century in Clifford (“The Country Girl,” “Clash by Night”) Odets and Ernest (“North by Northwest,” “West Side Story,” “The Sound of Music”) Lehman. Lehman originated the story (and was supposed to direct) and did some drafts of the script before an illness forced Odets to take over. Like any noir worth its salt, the dialogue isn’t realistic, but note the way the writers make Falco and Hunsucker in particular speak in ALL CAPS, as if they were writing headlines mentally as they spoke.\n\nMost of director Alexander Mackendrick’s filmography isn’t well known today or overwhelmingly loved, but he still should get all the credit in the world for pulling the performances he does from the leads and then getting out of their way. Cinematographer James Wong Howe gets most of the credit for creating the indelible look of the interiors and exteriors of New York City, managing to make things look at once opulent and a little seedy, which is no small feat. A case could be made that Howe is the best cinematographer in film history, and you won’t hear much argument from me.\n\nFor a film that sails through most of its 95-minute running time, it’s a shame that the film sags a bit towards the finale, which offers up Falco talking and talking and TALKING to Susan when less dialogue and more emotions would have been more resonant. Things improve exponentially when Hunsucker enters the proceedings, though. I do have to wonder, though, just how many films noir end with a female character walking off into the light, preferably by herself. Though it works here, I feel like I’ve seen some variation on this at least 20 times so far on this Odyssey, and it’s becoming a clam very quickly.\n\n“Sweet Smell of Success” is one of those movies that is hard to categorize. It’s a masterpiece, but it doesn’t really have a genre. Like “The Lost Weekend,” it’s easy enough to wedge into noir because of its oily “heroes,” dark storytelling and excellent visuals. And yet… perhaps it’s one of those movies that is just so good that it transcends all genres, becoming its own thing. Perhaps.\n\nScore: *****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Richard Brooks, John Huston (uncredited), Anthony Veiller (credited)\n\nBased on: “The Killers” short story by Ernest Hemingway\n\nDirector: Robert Siodmak\n\nCinematographer: Woody Bredell\n\nMusic: Miklos Rozsa\n\nCast: Burt Lancaster, Ava Gardner, Edmond O’Brien, Charles McGraw, William Conrad\n\nRelease: October 9, 1947\n\nStudio: Universal Pictures\n\nAwards: “The Killers” was nominated for Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Dramatic Score and Best Editing (Arthur Hilton) Oscars, but lost in every category to “The Best Years of Our Lives.”\n\nPercent Noir: 90%\n\nIf “Citizen Kane” wasn’t already a film noir, then “The Killers” would be the “Citizen Kane” of film noir. Not because it matches the former in terms of quality, because it does not (and, frankly, nothing ever has), but because “The Killers” focuses on placing together the pieces of a recently dead man’s life, searching desperately for answers despite no assurance that there are any.\n\nThe dead man in question is commonly known as the Swede (Burt Lancaster), who was found by two hired guns (Charles McGraw, William Conrad) and surrendered to his shooting death, not even trying to protect himself. An insurance investigator named Reardon (Edmond O’Brien) looks into the odd circumstances surrounding the murder, piecing together stories from the Swede’s varied friends/enemies/frienemies, including his cop friend (Sam Levene), a hotel maid who stopped the Swede from committing suicide, his prison cellmate (Vince Barnett) and finally the mysterious, beautiful Kitty (Ava Gardner).\n\nThe film was a breakthrough for both Lancaster and Gardner, rocketing them onto the A-list. Since the film is structured so interestingly, both their characters must make a huge impact in their early scenes, despite not being able to define who they are. Heck, we get no glimpse of the Swede’s real personality until 35 minutes into the movie. The screenwriters and director Robert Siodmak use several methods to keep things interesting for viewers. First, and most blatantly, they play up Lancaster’s sex appeal. He appears in a tight sleeveless t-shirt in his first two scenes, and then is shirtless in wrestling trunks and showering in his next. And since what is good for the goose is good for the gander, Gardner appears in a beautiful dress and sings (not well), glancing at the Swede (and, by extension, the audience) all too seductively.\n\nThen, once Reardon really starts digging into the case, both get meatier, better scenes where they can show off their star quality. The climactic scene of Gardner attempting to force a dying man to lie is a stunner – despite having little to do earlier, the audience leaves the theater just wanting to discuss her. And despite this being Lancaster’s first major role, he had already perfected that perfect sexy brood he’d bring to most of his most memorable roles.\n\nBut despite those two excellent showcases, “The Killers” works because it is, at its heart, an ensemble piece. It appears as if every character actor, from O’Brien on down, recognized that this was their opportunity to make a huge impact with very little screen time, and adjusted themselves accordingly. We remember wonderful small moments, like the jealousy the Swede’s ex shows when she watches him spying Kitty for the first time. Or Barnett’s prison buddy character trying to tenderly tell the Swede a truth about love without breaking him. Then there’s the opening sequence, which is rightly one of the most lauded in noir history, with the hit men entering a diner, giving the most aggressive food order ever and then taking everyone hostage. Not a line is wasted and none of the actors hit a sour note. The economy with which Siodmak and his cinematographer Woody Bredell lens the scene makes it even more tense – there’s no need to show off.\n\nThey do enjoy showing off elsewhere, though, specifically allowing awesome visual expressionism to color the flashbacks. Take the prison scene, lit with amazing shadows and framed near an entirely unconvincing (yet still impactful) sky. Or the graveside scene where everyone has umbrellas that drip water despite it not raining. But the most incredible has to be the one-shot robbery, which matches more famous one-ers like “Touch of Evil” in quality, keeping the viewer on the edge of his seat from the storytelling while astounding them at the visual invention on display.\n\nSiodmak made a great many films over his career, but “The Killers” is part of his unofficial noir trilogy, which also includes “The Spiral Staircase” and “Criss Cross.” Together, they represent peak noir, and are among the most well respected by critics and fans everywhere. I’ll never forget walking into a screening of “Criss Cross” at the Turner Classic Film Festival several years ago. I was running late and my chosen film and my back-up film were sold out, so I went into the movie knowing nothing. By the end, I was so stunned by its quality that I could barely move from my chair. I walked out of the theater wanting to grab everyone and insist they watch the movie right now, do you hear me, right now!\n\n“The Killers” never quite reaches that level of excellence, at least for me. A lot of it comes from the fact that the Swede remains an enigma for most of the movie, so there’s no beating heart of the film to latch on to. Sure, one could argue Reardon acts as our hero, but he’s as much a cipher as the reporter in “Citizen Kane,” albeit one more fleshed out and allowed to appear out of the shadows.\n\nThat said, the film has moments that linger long after the film ends. That opening sequence is as close to perfect filmmaking as you can get. And Lancaster is a revelation – while Gardner’s career would veer her away from film noir, Lancaster remained enmeshed in the shadows of the genre for several more years. Right where he belongs.\n\nScore: ****"
