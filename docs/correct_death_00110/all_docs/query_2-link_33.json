        "text": "City in California, United States\n\nCity in California, United States\n\nLancaster is a charter city in northern Los Angeles County, in the Antelope Valley of the western Mojave Desert in Southern California. As of the 2020 census, the population was 173,516,[7] making Lancaster the 153rd largest city in the United States and the 30th largest in California. Lancaster is a twin city with its southern neighbor Palmdale; together, they are the principal cities within the Antelope Valley region.[8]\n\nLancaster is located approximately 70 miles (110 km) north (via I-5 and SR 14) of downtown Los Angeles and is near the Kern County line. It is separated from the Los Angeles Basin by the San Gabriel Mountains to the south and from Bakersfield and the San Joaquin Valley by the Tehachapi Mountains to the north. The population of Lancaster has grown from 37,000 at the time of its incorporation in 1977 to over 157,000 as of 2019.\n\nAntelope Valley, the area where Lancaster is now located, was home to the Paiute tribe at the time of first contact with Europeans. The Antelope Valley's central geography then served as the hub of a trade route for tribes trading between the California coast, the Central Valley, the Great Basin, and the pueblos of Arizona.[9]\n\nAfter statehood, the Antelope Valley again served as a geographic shortcut but for the Stockton-Los Angeles Road and the Butterfield Overland Mail, which had two nearby stops in Mud Spring and Neenach in the 1850s. However, Lancaster's origins as a settlement start with the Southern Pacific Railroad, which replaced the stage coach routes. The railroad built a station house, locomotive watering facility, section gang housing, and railroad track in the location of the town's current center. In 1876 the Southern Pacific completed the line through the Antelope Valley,[10] linking San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nLancaster began as a Scottish settlement.[11][12] The origin of Lancaster's name is unclear, attributed variously to the surname of a railroad station clerk, the moniker given by railroad officials, or the former Pennsylvania home (Lancaster, Pennsylvania) of unknown settlers. Train service brought passengers through the water-stop-turned-community, which, with the help of promotional literature, attracted new settlers. The person credited with formally developing the town is Moses Langley Wicks, who in 1884 bought property from the railroad for $2.50 per acre, mapped out a town with streets and lots, and by September was advertising 160-acre tracts of land for $6 an acre. The following year, the Lancaster News started publication, making it the first weekly newspaper in the Antelope Valley. By 1890, Lancaster was bustling and booming, and thanks to adequate rainfall, farmers planted and sold thousands of acres of wheat and barley.[13]\n\nThe town was devastated by the decade-long drought that began in 1894, killing businesses and driving cattle north, though fortunes improved somewhat in the late-1890s following the nearby discoveries of gold and borax. The Tropico Gold Mine in Rosamond was briefly the largest goldmine in Southern California before its 1956 closure.[14][15] The Pacific Coast Borax Company mine would later become the world's largest borax mine, producing nearly half of the world's supply of borates.[16] The 1912 completion of Antelope Valley High School allowed students from the growing region to study locally instead of moving to distant cities, hosting the state's first high school dormitory system.[17]\n\nLancaster State Prison opened in 1993 and before that Los Angeles County hosted no prisons but accounted for forty percent of California's state-prison inmates.[18] \"Most of Lancaster's civic leaders and residents\" opposed the building of the prison, and four inmates escaped from LAC in its first year of operation.[19] Nevertheless, by 2000 a proposal to increase the proportion of maximum-security inmates received little criticism.[19]\n\nIn 2005, Hyundai Motor Co. announced the grand opening of a 4,300-acre, $60 million \"Proving Ground,\" a state-of-the-art testing facility for cars and sports utility vehicles in nearby California City.\n\nIn 2010, the city opened The BLVD, a one-mile revitalized stretch of Lancaster Boulevard between 10th Street West and Sierra Highway, with additional construction on Elm Avenue and Fig Avenue continuing for the next few months.[20]\n\nCity leaders set the goal of becoming the nation's first Net-Zero municipality, wherein the city would produce more clean energy than it consumes. Much of the city's infrastructure including City Hall, local schools, and the minor league baseball stadium are solar-powered. In March 2013, Lancaster became the first city in the USA to require solar panels on all new homes in an effort to make the community more carbon neutral. The rule took effect in January 2014.[21]\n\nWar Eagle Field is a former airfield located in the Mojave Desert, about 5 mi (8.0 km) west of central Lancaster.\n\nIn 1944, the flight school changed its name to Mira Loma Flight Academy. The airfield inactivated on October 1, 1945, and was declared surplus in 1946. Responsibility for it was given to the War Assets Administration. The land was then bought by Los Angeles County. The airfield was converted to the Mira Loma Detention Center. In 2012, Los Angeles County closed the detention center.[22] Los Angeles County is currently collaborating with the City of Lancaster, the faith-based community, and the non-profit community to convert the facility into a winter shelter.[23]\n\nLancaster has a semi-arid climate, bordering on an arid climate. The area within Lancaster is covered by shrublands (80%), forests (8%), grasslands (7%), lakes and rivers (2%), and croplands (2%).[24] Lancaster and its immediate surroundings are part of USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 8b.[25] Winters are cool to mild, with daily normal minimum temperatures at or just below freezing from late November until late January; summers are hot and nearly rainless. On average, annually there are 68 mornings with a minimum at or below freezing, and 35.7 afternoons with a maximum at or above 100 °F (37.8 °C).[26] With a normal annual precipitation of 6.81 inches (173 millimeters), clear days are the norm even in winter, when surrounding mountain ranges are blanketed with snow. Thunderstorms are infrequent but do occur in July through September. Spring wildflowers are abundant, including Lupines, the California Poppy, Fiddlenecks, purple owl's clover, California Goldfields, Creamcups, and Coreopsis. Summer nights are cool and the Pacific tree frog or barn owl can be heard. Average annual snowfall is around 2 inches (5.1 cm).\n\nThe record high temperature in Lancaster was 115 °F (46.1 °C) on June 30, 2013. The record low temperature was 2 °F (−16.7 °C) on December 24, 1984. The wettest “rain year” was from July 1992 to June 1993 with 19.57 inches (497.1 mm) and the driest from July 2012 to June 2013 with 1.26 inches (32.0 mm). The most precipitation in one month was 7.46 inches (189.5 mm) in January 1993. The most precipitation in one twenty-four-hour period was 2.93 inches (74.4 mm) on March 1, 1983. In December 1979, 23.9 inches (0.61 m) of snow fell in Lancaster.[27]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 196026,012—197030,94819.0%198048,02755.2%199097,291102.6%2000118,71822.0%2010156,63331.9%2020173,51610.8%\n\nThe 2010 United States Census[30] reported that Lancaster had a population of 156,633.

Mexico (44.3%) and the Philippines (8.4%) are the most common foreign places of birth in Lancaster.[34]\n\nIn 2022, there were 636 homeless individuals in Lancaster.[36]\n\nThe Greater Antelope Valley Economic Alliance describes five areas as business and industrial parks in the city of Lancaster: Fox Field Industrial Corridor (adjacent to the General William J. Fox Airfield) along Avenue G, North Valley Industrial Center, Lancaster Business Park, Enterprise Business Park, Centerpoint Business Park, and the Southern Amargosa Industrial Area. The former Lancaster Redevelopment Agency is credited with attracting major business operations to the area such as SYGMA, Rite Aide, Micheals, Bank of America, and many more. In 2012 the state of California abolished all local redevelopment agencies. The city's economic development department is now responsible for recruiting large employers and is involved in attracting retail and dining to Lancaster Town Center, Front Row Center, and other retail centers throughout the city.\n\nAnother focus of the Agency and the city was the revitalization of Downtown Lancaster. With historic buildings interspersed with modern amenities such as a library[37] and performing arts center,[38] downtown businesses formed the Lancaster Old Town Site (LOTS). LOTS has resulted in the renovation of business facades and attraction of new businesses, including boutiques and restaurants in the Old Town Area.\n\nIn 2009, Lancaster had 17% unemployment.[39] Given the strength of China's economy in the face of the global recession, Mayor R. Rex Parris identified recruitment of Chinese manufacturing firms as a high priority in 2009. In early 2010, Mayor Parris led a delegation to explore trade opportunities with China.[40] An essential component of this trade mission was a stop in Shenzhen, China to meet with representatives of the battery, alternative energy, solar panel, and vehicle manufacturing firm BYD. BYD was looking to break into the United States vehicle manufacturing market, and was introduced to the City of Lancaster by Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich and his wife, Christine.\n\nLancaster's partnership with BYD began with the \"Home of the Future,\" in which KB Home utilized BYD's energy efficiency and storage technology to construct some of the first affordable near net-zero homes in the U.S. Through the success of this project, a working relationship was born, which BYD and Lancaster continued to cultivate as BYD Auto prepared to enter the U.S. market. Once the firm was ready to establish its manufacturing facility, Lancaster was its first stop. In May 2013, BYD Auto announced two manufacturing facilities to be located in Lancaster. These include a 120,000-square-foot BYD electric bus manufacturing facility, as well as a separate 44,000-square-foot energy storage system (large scale battery) manufacturing facility.[41][42] By April 2019, BYD Lancaster had produced over 300 electric buses for US and Canada.[43] Lancaster has the highest solar production per capita in California.[44]\n\nAs of 2017 unemployment is around 6%.[39]\n\nValley Central Way[45]\n\nLancaster Boulevard (The BLVD)[46]\n\nLancaster Commerce Center Shopping Center\n\nWest Lancaster Plaza Shopping Center\n\nThe city has prioritized arts and culture as an economic driver, opening the Lancaster Museum of Art and History, or MOAH, in 2012 locating the new facility in its downtown district known as The BLVD. Originally founded as the Lancaster Museum/Art Gallery in 1986, the MOAH operates four sites within the city, serving the Antelope Valley, Los Angeles County, and parts of Kern and San Bernardino Counties.[47] The museum contains over 10,000 art pieces about Southern California.[48]\n\nIn 2018, downtown Lancaster was designated The BLVD Cultural District, one of fourteen California Cultural Districts recognized as a place where culture happens within the state. Within the district, BLVD Cultural District Family Days and the biannual POW! WOW! Antelope Valley mural and arts festival has added nearly 50 murals by both local and internationally known artists to the district. The BLVD project was completed in 2010 and consists of Lancaster Blvd from 10th Street West to Sierra Highway. The multiple festivals have attracted huge crowds in the tens of thousands. The BLVD project was largely accepted as a major success. The Western Hotel (1876) is the oldest standing structure in the city of Lancaster, which was converted to a museum under the California Historic Site program in 1992, is also located within The BLVD Cultural District.\n\nThe Lancaster Performing Arts Center, in addition to MOAH, is a cultural anchor within the cultural district, providing a varied array of fine arts from community theatre productions to classical music and various forms of dance. It also draws celebrity performers from across the country and around the world, including renowned singers, dancers and musicians of all genres as well as comedians and variety shows.[49]\n\nThe BLVD Cultural District is also home to the Lancaster Aerospace Walk of Honor. Established in 1990 by the Lancaster City Council, the Aerospace Walk of Honor celebrates test pilots who were associated with Edwards Air Force Base.
