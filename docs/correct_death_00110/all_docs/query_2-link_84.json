I tell the story about how I almost met him and you won’t believe it! Also, we take you inside the air-raid shelters of London city 1940 and we explore an old ghost town in Colorado.\n\nOur OTR Story – Rope Of Sand\n\nOur OTR story stars the great Burt Lancaster and it comes from the classic radio series Screen Director’s Playhouse. It is story that could have been from anyplace and anytime and plays well today. It is all about the diamonds and what one will do to protect them. It is an adventure tale called Rope of Sand and first aired on April 28, 1950.\n\nRon’s Amazing Stories is produced and hosted by Ronald Hood\n\nEmail: ronsamazingstories@gmail.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ronsamazingstories/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RASpodcast\n\nWe tune up the search engine once again for Ron’s Amazing Stories true or false. This time we focus on another American icon, Burt Lancaster. Let’s start with the truth.\n\nTrue – Burt Lancaster was not only was one of America’s darlings, but his background was the stuff of legend. He was one of five children, born in 1913 in Manhattan, NY, and was a tough street kid who took an early interest in gymnastics.\n\nBurt joined the circus as an acrobat?\n\nTrue – Lancaster met Nick Cravat, with whom he developed a lifelong partnership. Together they learned to act in local theatre productions and circus arts at Union Settlement. Together they formed the acrobat duo Lang and Cravat in the 1930s and joined the Kay Brothers Circus. They continued this until Burt was injured and had to give up the circus life.\n\nBurt didn’t find acting until after World War II?\n\nFalse – It was in the Army during WW II that he was introduced to the USO and acting. At first he liked the idea of acting, but it was not his first choice for a career. He tried out for the play, A Sound of Hunting and his performance attracted the interest of Hollywood agent, Harold Hecht. This lead to an eight-movie contract and his first film, The Killers (1946).\n\nBurt attended some the finest acting schools in the world?\n\nFalse – He was a self-taught actor who learned the business as he went along. Lancaster sought demanding roles, and was prepared to work for less pay than he might have earned elsewhere. He even helped to finance movies in whose artistic value he believed in.\n\nBurt became a producer/director in the later stages of his career?\n\nTrue – He chose not to sign with a major studio. Harold Hecht promised him the opportunity to produce their own movies within five years of hitting Hollywood. Hecht kept his promise and the two formed a partnership production company under the name Norma Productions (the duo later changed the company’s name to Hecht-Lancaster Productions). He also mentored directors such as Sydney Pollack and John Frankenheimer and appeared in several of the firms films. Including Lancaster’s last film, Field of Dreams (1989) .\n\nBurt Lancaster never won an Oscar?\n\nFalse – Lancaster made many great films during his career: Criss Cross (1949), The Crimson Pirate (1952), Trapeze (1956), Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), The Train (1964), Atlantic City (1980), and many others. He was nominated for an Oscar four times, and took home the golden statuette for the title role in Elmer Gantry (1960). In addition, his company produced several successful films, most notably the Best Picture Oscar-winner, Marty (1955).\n\nClosing Thoughts?\n\nBurt Lancaster lead an impressive life. He made many films and produced or directed many more. He held actors Montgomery Clift and Marlon Brando in high esteem and said that they were the only two men whose talent intimidated him. Lancaster died in his Century City apartment in Los Angeles from a heart attack in 1994 at the age of 80.\n\nThis Week’s Podcast:\n\nOn the podcast this week we will feature Burt Lancaster in a reprise of his role as a diamond thief in Rope of Sand.

I am no expert on this subject, but when I was flipping through the news archives I came across this one given by General Douglas Macarthur on April 19, 1951. A little more than a week before, President Harry S. Truman had relieved him as commander of U.S. forces fighting in Korea. MacArthur had publicly challenged Truman’s leadership by threatening to attack China directly—a strategy that the U.S. feared would spark a wider war. MacArthur’s dismissal was not popular. Americans revered him as the mastermind of the victorious Pacific campaign in World War II. A quarter million people filled the National Mall to cheer the war hero. After summarizing his 52-year Army career he concluded his speech by recalling a line from a West Point barracks song: Old soldiers never die, they just fade away.\n\nI will have an excerpt from this speech in this week’s podcast. I knew that I could not play the entire thing, but I want you guys to be hear it for yourself. If you look at the problems that still plague us today from North Korea and China one is left to wonder if MacArthur was right some 65+ years ago.\n\nIf you would like to listen to the entire speech for yourself you can click below or listen to the closing five minutes in the podcast. The full speech It just over an hour in length but, it is from another time and place\n\n-Ron\n\nhttps://ronsamazingstories.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1951-04-19-cbs-macarthur-congress1.mp3\n\nThis Week’s Podcast:\n\nOn the podcast this week we will have the ‘Old Soldiers Never Die’ speech, A western from the OTR series Gunsmoke, Three emails from you guys and of course another Five Minute Mystery.
