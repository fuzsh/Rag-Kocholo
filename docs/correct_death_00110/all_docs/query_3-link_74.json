        "text": "Pierce Brothers Westwood Village is located at 1218 Glendon Avenue in Westwood, California. I had never been there before and I drove right past the entrance. Google repeated three times that I had reached my destination, but I hadn’t seen it. I turned my car around, parked on the street and went looking for the cemetery on foot.\n\nThe entrance to the cemetery is hidden. It’s up a narrow access road that looks more like an alley than a street and the graveyard isn’t visible from the street. The cemetery is hidden behind buildings. One of those buildings is the Westwood Public Library.\n\nBelow you can see the ENTIRE cemetery in these two shots.\n\nThis cemetery probably has more stars per square foot than any other cemetery in Los Angeles County.\n\nBelow are a few of the notable individuals buried at Westwood Village.\n\nNatalie Wood circa 1962.\n\nNatalie Wood is one of the few child stars who was able to make the transition from child star to full fledged movie star. One of her early roles was as the girl who didn’t believe in Santa Clause in the movie Miracle on 34th Street (1947). She made the transition from child star to teenage star opposite James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause (1956). In 1956, she also had a pivotal role in John Ford’s The Searchers which starred John Wayne.\n\nIn 1961, she achieved full blown movie stardom with West Side Story which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In the 1960s, she starred in Splendor in the Grass (1961), Gypsy (1962), Love with the Proper Stranger (1963), Sex and the Single Girl (1964) and Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969). She drowned under mysterious circumstances in 1981. She was filming Brainstorm at the time of her death and that film was eventually released in 1983. She was 43 years old.\n\nNatalie Wood was born July 20, 1938, and died on November 29, 1981.\n\nEddie Albert circa 1960.\n\nEddie Albert was born in Rock Island, Illinois in 1906. He became well-known as a result of his work in the film Roman Holiday (1953). The film starred Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck and Albert received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Later he appeared in The Longest Day (1962) and Captain Newman, M.D. (1963). From 1965 to 1971 Albert co-starred with Eva Gabor in the very successful television series Green Acres. After his television series ended he worked in motion pictures again and received another Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for the film The Heartbreak Kid (1972). His later films included The Longest Yard (1974) and Airport 1979. He died from a pneumonia at the age of 99.\n\nEddie Albert was born on April 22, 1906, and died on May 26, 2005. He married Margo in 1942. She was best known for her role as Maria in the Ronald Coleman version of Lost Horizon (1937).\n\nDonna Reed circa 1953.\n\nDonna Reed was born in Dennison, Iowa in 1921. She didn’t make many memorable movies, but she made one that practically everyone in America has seen. In the history of American film there are few movies like that. Before she made that film she was in Shadow of the Thin Man (1941), The Courtship of Andy Hardy (1942), The Human Comedy (1943) and The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945). Then, in 1946 she had the female lead opposite Jimmy Stewart in Frank Capra’s It’s A Wonderful Life. That film is one of the most watched films ever released in the United States. There is no way she could have topped it, but she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for From Here to Eternity (1953). After Eternity she was in The Benny Goodman Story (1956) opposite Steve Allen, but at that point her film career was pretty much over.\n\nShe made the transition to television and starred in her own TV series called The Donna Reed Show which ran from 1958-1966. Her husband in the show was the very likeable Carl Betz and her daughter was portrayed by Shelley Fabares.\n\nReed was married three times. First to make up artist William Tuttle (1943-1945), then to producer Tony Owen (1945-1971) and finally to Army colonel Grover W. Asmus (1974-her death). Donna Reed was born on January 27, 1921, and died on January 14, 1986. She died from pancreatic cancer. She was 64 years old.\n\nNote: Grover Asmus died in 2003, but his death date has yet to be added to their marker.\n\nLew Ayres circa 1932.\n\nLew Ayres was born in Minneapolis in 1908 and he played in a band before he arrived in Hollywood in the late 1920s. Ayres made two movies of note around 1930. One was opposite Greta Garbo called The Kiss (1929). The other was selected as the Best Picture of 1929/30. That film was All Quiet on the Western Front (1930). After Western Front, he made a number of less than memorable films until he made Holiday (1938) opposite Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant. That same year he starred as Young Dr. Kildare which became a series so more Dr. Kildare movies followed over the years.\n\nAfter World War II he starred opposite some big female stars including Olivia DeHavilland in The Dark Mirror (1946), Ann Sheridan in The Unfaithful (1947) and Jane Wyman in Johnny Belinda (1948). In the early 1960s he starred in two films with all star casts: Advise and Consent (1962) and The Carpetbaggers (1964). Then, Ayres worked in television; everything from The Big Valley to The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\n\nLew Ayres was born December 28, 1908, and died on December 30, 1996. He was 88 years old.\n\nEve Arden circa 1945.\n\nEve Arden was born in Mill Valley, California in 1908. Once in Hollywood, Arden was in RKO’s Stage Door (1937) with Ginger Rodgers and Katherine Hepburn. She also had a part in a lesser known Marx Brothers’ movie — At the Circus (1939) and in Clark Gable’s Comrade X (1941). She was featured in that great Warner Bros. film The Unfaithful (1947) with Ann Sheridan, Zachary Scott and Lew Ayres. Yet, Arden is best remembered for three roles in three films. The first as Joan Crawford’s friend and sidekick in Mildred Pierce (1945). The second as Jimmy Stewart’s secretary in Anatomy of a Murder (1959) and the third as Rydell High’s principal in Grease (1978).\n\nLike many other film stars she turned to television in the 1950s and starred in the immensely popular Our Miss Brooks from 1952-1956.\n\nEve Arden was born April 30, 1908, and died November 12, 1990. The cause of death was a heart attack. She was 82 years old. She’s buried next to her second husband, actor and producer, Brooks West.\n\nDarryl F. Zannuck circa 1934.\n\nDarryl F. Zanuck was born in Wahoo, Nebraska on September 5, 1902. In 1908, he and his mother moved to Los Angeles. At 15, he signed up for the service and after serving in World War I, Zanuck returned to Los Angeles and worked for both Mack Sennett and Jack Warner. In 1933, Zanuck entered into a partnership with Joseph Schenck and the company they created was Twentieth Century Pictures. This incarnation of the company existed from 1933 to 1935. During these three years Twentieth Century Pictures were released through United Artists. In 1935 Zanuck and Schenck bought Fox Studios and from that point forward the company was known as 20th Century-Fox.\n\nZanuck fought to be a part of the military in World War II and saw some action in France. When he returned to the United States he took his place as the undisputed head of 20th Century-Fox. He is the credited producer on numerous films including: Wilson (1944), Dragonwyck (1946), The Razor’s Edge (1946), Nightmare Alley (1947), Gentleman’s Agreement (1947), The Snake Pit (1948), Pinky (1949), Twelve O’Clock High (1949), All About Eve (1950), Viva Zapata! (1952), With a Song in My Heart (1952), The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit (1956) and The Longest Day (1962).\n\nZanuck died of pneumonia. He was 77 years old.\n\nThat’s a whole lot of text for a burial marker! I found it difficult to read even when I was there.\n\nCornel Wilde circa 1945.\n\nCornel Wilde was born in 1915. He ended up in Hollywood in the early 1940s and his first big success was in the Monty Woolley film Life Begins at Eight-Thirty (1942). He followed that up opposite Gene Tierney in Leave Her to Heaven (1945) and A Song to Remember (1945). In the latter film he portrayed Frederic Chopin and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Those films were followed by another hit, Forever Amber (1947), opposite Linda Darnell. In 1948, he starred opposite Ida Lupino in the very enjoyable film Road House. In the 1950s he starred in the Academy Award winning Best Picture of 1952 The Greatest Show on Earth. Wilde then produced and starred in a magnificent film noir opposite his wife Jean Wallace. That film was The Big Combo (1955).\n\nHe continued to make films throughout the 1960s and 1970s, but none were successful either artistically or commercially. The only film of any note that is remembered today is The Naked Prey (1966).\n\nCornel Wilde was born on October 13, 1915, and died of leukemia on October 16, 1989. He was 77 years old.\n\nBurt Lancaster circa 1950.\n\nBurt Lancaster was born in lower Manhattan in 1913. He worked as a circus acrobat when he was young and eventually served in World War II. After the war, he was appearing in a New York play when he was spotted by Harold Hecht. Hecht thought Lancaster had the looks necessary for a leading man in motion pictures and was able to convince Lancaster to move to Hollywood. Hal Wallis agreed with Hecht’s assessment and signed Lancaster.\n\nBurt Lancaster made a series of highly successful films including: The Killers (1946), Brute Force (1947), Sorry, Wrong Number (1948), Criss Cross (1949), Jim Thorpe – All-American (1951), Come Back, Little Sheba (1952), From Here to Eternity (1953), The Rose Tattoo (1955), Marty (1955),* The Rainmaker (1956), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), Sweet Smell of Success (1958), Separate Tables (1958), Elmer Gantry (1960), Judgement at Nuremberg (1961), Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), The Swimmer (1968), Airport (1970), The Island of Dr. Moreau (1977), Atlantic City (1980) and Local Hero (1983). His last film of note was Field of Dreams (1989).\n\nLancaster suffered a stroke in 1990 that left him partially paralyzed and he suffered a fatal heart attack in 1994. Lancaster was born on November 2, 1913, and died on October 20, 1994. He was 80 years old.\n\n*He was the producer of Marty with Harold Hecht. I didn’t see any family nearby but his friend and partner, Harold Hecht, is about fifteen feet away.\n\nKirk Douglas circa 1952.\n\nKirk Douglas was born in New York in 1916 and ended up in Hollywood in the mid-1940s through the help of Lauren Bacall. (They knew each other in New York City.) His first film was opposite Barbara Stanwyck in The Strange Loves of Martha Ivers (1946). Next up was the classic noir film Out of the Past (1947) opposite Jane Greer and Robert Mitchum. The following year he starred in Champion (1949) and then had a string of hits in the 1950s. Douglas starred in Young Man with a Horn (1950), Ace in the Hole (1951), Detective Story (1951), The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954), Lust for Life (1956) and Paths of Glory (1957). His last two films of note were Spartacus (1960) and Seven Days in May (1964).\n\nDouglas continued to make films over the next three decades. He had a stroke in 1996 which had an affect on his speech, but it didn’t stop him from living. He died in 2020 at the age of 103.\n\nKirk Douglas was born on December 9, 1916, and died on February 5, 2020. No cause of death was given at the time of his death, but one can assume it was natural causes or old age.\n\nWalter Matthau circa 1980.\n\nWalter Matthau made a series of movies with director Billy Wilder and actor Jack Lemmon. Their first collaboration together was The Fortune Cookie (1966) which won Matthau the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The trio also made The Front Page (1974) and Buddy Buddy (1981) together. Matthau also starred in The Odd Couple (1968), Hello Dolly (1969), Plaza Suite (1971), Kotch (1971), The Sunshine Boys (1975) and The Bad News Bears (1976).\n\nThere’s an Alfred Hitchcock Presents that Matthau did with Betty Field that I like. It’s called “A Very Moral Theft” (1960). In the episode Betty Field’s character, Helen, who is older and on the verge of spinsterhood wants to marry Matthau’s character, Harry Wade, but Wade isn’t so sure. Helen makes the ultimate relationship mistake; she loans Harry Wade money at which point things go unexpectedly wrong.\n\nWalter Matthau died from a heart attack. He was 79 years old.\n\nJack Lemmon circa 1955.\n\nJack Lemmon‘s first big role was opposite Judy Holiday in It Should Happen to You (1954). He followed that up with Mister Roberts (1955) and then starred in a string of very successful films including: Some Like it Hot (1959), The Apartment (1960), Days of Wine and Roses (1962), The Fortune Cookie (1966), The Odd Couple (1968), The Out-of-Towners (1971), Save the Tiger (1973), The Front Page (1974), The China Syndrome (1979) and Missing (1983).\n\nLemmon’s son, Chris Lemmon, wrote a book regarding his father. In the book Neil Simon recounted a story in which super agent Swifty Lazar threw a party for Simon when Simon first arrived in Hollywood. Simon said some of the biggest stars in Hollywood were at the party including Gregory Peck, Rosalind Russell, Natalie Wood, Billy Wilder, Jack Lemon and Fred Astaire. Simon recounted that none of the stars made any attempt to engage him in conversation except for Jack Lemmon. Lemmon was the only one who walked over and spoke to him without being prompted by Lazar. Simon said he always remembered that.\n\nJack Lemmon was born on February 8, 1925, and died on June 27, 2001. The cause of death was bladder cancer. He was 76 years old.\n\nBilly Wilder circa 1950.\n\nBilly Wilder was born in Poland in 1906. In the 1920s, as a young adult, he moved to Berlin, first, and then to Paris. In 1933, he fortunately left Europe for good and moved to America. In Hollywood, he found a job at Paramount and along with his writing partner, Charles Brackett, he worked on a series of scripts that included: Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife (1938-Paramount), Midnight (1939-Paramount), Ninotchka (1939-MGM), Hold Back the Dawn (1941-Paramount) and Ball of Fire (1941-RKO). [Note: Paramount loaned out Wilder and Brackett to other studios to work on scripts.]\n\nIn 1942 Wilder got his chance to direct a Ginger Rodgers film, The Major and the Minor. Rodgers co-star was Ray Milland and the film was a success. From the moment The Major and the Minor was released until the 1970s Wilder was a major film director who created a series of films that are held in even higher esteem today than they were when they were released.\n\nA partial list of the films Wilder directed include: Double Indemnity (1944), The Lost Weekend (1945), A Foreign Affair (1948), Sunset Boulevard (1950), Ace in the Hole (1951), Stalag 17 (1953), Sabrina (1954), The Seven Year Itch (1955), Witness for the Prosecution (1957), Some Like it Hot (1959), The Apartment (1960), The Fortune Cookie (1966), The Private Life of Sherlock Homes (1970), The Front Page (1974) and Fedora (1978).\n\nThe text on his headstone is a homage to the last line of Some Like it Hot. Billy Wilder was born June 22, 1906, and died on March 27, 2002, from pneumonia. At the time of his death he was 95 years old.\n\nBrian Keith circa 1955.\n\nBrian Keith was born in New Jersey in 1921. After he arrived in Hollywood, he starred opposite Ginger Rogers in Tight Spot (1955) and opposite Maureen O’Hara in The Parent Trap (1961). He also had a role in a Best Picture nominee: The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming (1966). Opposite Doris Day he starred in the very enjoyable With Six You Get an Eggroll (1968).\n\nFrom 1966-1971 Keith starred in the long running television series Family Affair with Sebastian Cabot.\n\nIn most of his work Brian Keith had a pleasant, warm and easy-going persona yet there is an Alfred Hitchcock Presents where he plays against type. It’s in an episode titled “Your Witness” (1960). In the episode he portrays an attorney and unfaithful husband who’s a heel. A horrible heel. He’s just horrible! Unfortunately, for him, his wife in the story gets tired of his abuse and when the opportunity arises — gets even.\n\nDaisy Keith was one of Brian Keith’s daughters. In April of 1997 Daisy Keith committed suicide. Keith, who had both lung cancer and emphysema, committed suicide — with a gun — on June 24, 1997. He was 75 years old.\n\nJanet Leigh circa 1948.\n\nJanet Leigh was born in Stockton, California in 1927. In the mid 1940s, Leigh was working at a California ski resort when she caught the attention of MGM’s Norma Shearer who was at the resort on vacation. Shearer thought Leigh had star potential so Shearer set up an interview for Leigh at MGM and then persuaded the MGM executives to give Leigh a studio contract. Leigh made a series of average but unspectacular films until she hit her stride in 1958. That year she starred with Charlton Heston and Marlene Dietrich in Orson Wells’ Touch of Evil. She followed that up with her most famous role, as Marion Crane, in Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho (1960). Two years later she appeared in John Frankenheimer’s The Manchurian Candidate (1962) and followed that up with George Sidney’s Bye Bye Birdie (1963). She semi-retired after that to concentrate on her family.\n\nYears later she starred opposite her daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis, in The Fog (1980) and in Halloween: H20 (1998).\n\nJanet Leigh was married four times. Her most famous marriage was to Tony Curtis which lasted from 1951-1962. Her last marriage was to Robert Brandt. She was married to him from 1962 to the time of her death. Leigh was born on July 6, 1927, and died on October 3, 2004, from vasculitis. Vasculitis is a blood vessel disorder. She was 77 years old.\n\nMarilyn Monroe circa 1955.\n\nMarilyn Monroe had a small part in The Asphalt Jungle (1950) which is a very good movie and garnered a great deal of praise at the time and is held in high esteem today, but that picture really belongs to Sterling Hayden and Louis Calhern. She had another small part in Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s All About Eve (1950). That film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, but that’s a Bette Davis picture. Monroe had yet another small part in Monkey Business (1952), but the stars of that film were Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers. All the small parts paid off because in 1953 Marilyn Monroe became a star. That year three of her most memorable films were released.\n\nThe three films are: Niagara, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire. She followed up those films with Bus Stop and The Seven Year Itch (both 1956) and at the end of the decade she co-starred alongside Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Some Like it Hot (1959). Her last film was The Misfits (1961) opposite Clark Gable and Montgomery Clift. She died from an overdose of barbiturates the following year.\n\nMarilyn Monroe was born on June 1, 1926, and died on August 4, 1962. She was 36 years old. The founder and publisher of Playboy magazine, Hugh Hefner, has the crypt directly to the left of Monroe’s crypt.\n\n—\n\nMost of the images are postcards from the 1930s and 1940s. The images of Marilyn Monroe and Natalie Wood are from Wikimedia commons. The images of Eddie Albert, Brian Keith, Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder are publicity photos. I bought the picture of Walter Matthau off E-bay. It was one photo in a set of four (I purchased all four) from an estate sale. The estate belonged to a woman who had gone to a luncheon where Matthau spoke. The image of Zanuck is part of a trade paper advertisement that I also bought off E-bay.\n\n—\n\nSources\n\nBrackett, C., Slide, A. (Ed.). (2014).
