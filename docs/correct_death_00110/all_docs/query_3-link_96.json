        "text": "November 2, 1913 – October 20, 1994\n\nIt’s the age-old Hollywood story: Athletic boy grows up to become a circus acrobat, joins the military and becomes a film legend. Standard stuff, really.\n\nBurt Lancaster was a tall, muscular actor who started off his long career playing tough guy roles. Eventually, he managed to land roles with more depth like Sergeant Warden in From Here to Eternity or his Academy Award winning titular character in Elmer Gantry. Lancaster was so serious about taking on roles with more substance that he often took pay cuts to play better characters. He even put his own money into projects he truly believed in. All in all, he made over 60 films throughout his career. Not bad for a kid who started off as a gymnast.\n\nA number of significant health issues slowed him down in his final years. After suffering a stroke, Burt Lancaster died of a heart attack at the age of 80.\n\nBurial\n\nWestwood Village Memorial Park – Los Angeles, CA\n\nSpecific Location\n\nOn the eastern side of the main lawn section is a small urn garden (directly across from the Sanctuary of Love – where Dean Martin is buried,) Burt’s small marker is in this urn garden, 2nd row down and 2 markers in from the left edge of the garden."
