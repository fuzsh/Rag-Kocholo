        "text": "He rolled in the surf with Deborah Kerr in From Here to Eternity. He preached hellfire and damnation in Elmer Gantry. He did hard time in The Birdman of Alcatraz.\n\nBurt Lancaster was all those roles and more _ acrobat, actor, producer, gymnast and iconoclast.\n\nHe died at home Thursday of a heart attack. Mr. Lancaster was 80.\n\n\"He was patting my hair and touching my face,\" said his wife, Susan, \"and he took a sigh, and that was it.\"\n\nThere will be no funeral and burial will be private, she said.\n\nMr. Lancaster, who won an Academy Award in 1960 for his performance as the salesman turned evangelist in Elmer Gantry, had been in failing health since a stroke nearly four years ago.\n\n\"It's the passing now of a giant. But Burt will never die. We'll always be able to see him swinging from a yardarm in The Crimson Pirate . . . and shooting with me in Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,\" said fellow actor Kirk Douglas.\n\nMr. Lancaster had been in relative seclusion since he was hospitalized in November 1990. He suffered the stroke while visiting a friend near Los Angeles and lately had refused visits, even from such old friends as Douglas.\n\nThe stroke proved the last in a series of physical maladies that had befallen the virile and versatile star of more than 70 films.\n\nIn 1983 he underwent multiple coronary-artery bypass surgery and he continued to suffer from a heart condition.\n\nEven though he filmed Little Treasure six months after the surgery and continued working steadily in film and television, Mr. Lancaster was denied the title role in The Old Gringo in 1988 because of his health. Columbia decided that insurance on him would be too expensive and hired Gregory Peck instead.\n\nBut he bounced back from that setback to give a heralded performance in Field of Dreams in 1989.\n\nMr. Lancaster took no acting classes, played no second leads and was a bonafide star from his first screen appearance _ as the doomed hero in The Killers in 1946.\n\nThe Academy Award he won in 1960 and the Venice Festival award he received two years later for Birdman were remembered. But many forgot the earlier Oscar he had shared with Harold Hecht as co-producer of Marty, the Best Picture of 1955.\n\nIt was a romantic role _ as the elderly chronic loser dreaming of a happy life with Susan Sarandon in Atlantic City _ that won him the Los Angeles and New York film critics' awards in 1981 and nearly brought his second performance Oscar.\n\n\"There are lots of good actors, but there are very few one-of-a-kinds. Like Cagney and Bogart, Burt was one of a kind,\" said Gantry co-star Shirley Jones.\n\nHis work in such major dramatic productions as Come Back Little Sheba, From Here to Eternity, Judgment at Nuremberg, The Rainmaker, Seven Days In May and Atlantic City tended always to overshadow his work in efforts such as Trapeze, The Flame and the Arrow and The Crimson Pirate, which displayed the lighter side of his nature.\n\n\"Burt was not just an actor,\" Douglas said. \"He was a curious intellectual with an abiding love of opera who was constantly in search of unique characters to portray.\"\n\nBurton Stephen Lancaster was born Nov. 2, 1913, the son of a postal clerk. He grew up in New York's tough East Harlem neighborhood. He said he might have become a juvenile delinquent had it not been for the local library.\n\nHe attended New York University on a basketball scholarship but left without completing studies. With a friend, he formed an acrobatic team, and for several years they toured with circuses and vaudeville.\n\nMr. Lancaster quit that act for a while to appear with the depression-era WPA Theater Project. But it was difficult living.\n\nOver the next three years he was a floorwalker in the lingerie department of the Marshall Field's store in Chicago and a haberdashery salesman and held other blue-collar jobs.\n\nEventually he returned to New York, but before he could take a new job he was drafted.\n\nAfter World War II, he was invited to read for a part in a play called A Sound of Hunting.\n\nMr. Lancaster got the part. The play survived only for five weeks, but reviewers were unanimous in their praise.\n\nThe result: seven screen contract offers.\n\nInstead, he signed with agent Hecht, who came backstage to make the kind of offer no one else had mentioned:\n\n\"In five years,\" Hecht told him, \"we'll be making our own pictures.\"\n\nThey shook hands on that, and began an association that yielded an almost unbroken supply of movies, millions and Oscars for the next quarter century.\n\n\"Why, I'd still be the same punk kid I used to be back in East Harlem during the Depression,\" Mr. Lancaster once said, \"if I was afraid to take a chance.\"\n\n_ Information from the Los Angeles Times, Associated Press, Dallas Morning News and New York Times was used in this report.\n\nFilms of Burt Lancaster\n\nThe Killers 1946\n\nDesert Fury 1947\n\nVariety Girl 1947\n\nBrute Force 1947\n\nI Walk Alone 1948\n\nSorry, Wrong Number 1948\n\nKiss the Blood Off My Hands 1948\n\nAll My Sons 1948\n\nCriss Cross 1949\n\nRope of Sand 1949\n\nMister 880 1950\n\nThe Flame and the Arrow 1950\n\nVengeance Valley 1951\n\nTen Tall Men 1951\n\nJim Thorpe All-American 1951\n\nThe Crimson Pirate 1952\n\nCome Back Little Sheba 1952\n\nSouth Sea Woman 1953\n\nFrom Here to Eternity+ 1953\n\nHis Majesty O'Keefe 1954\n\nApache 1954\n\nVera Cruz 1954\n\nThe Kentuckian (also directed) 1955\n\nThe Rose Tattoo 1955\n\nTrapeze 1956\n\nThe Rainmaker 1956\n\nGunfight at the O.K.
