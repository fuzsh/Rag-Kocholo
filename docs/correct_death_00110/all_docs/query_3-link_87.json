        "text": "Like most people, I have a colourful alter ago. By this I mean that I have access to a second personality I summon forth from time to time: when I am bored, when I find myself in a situation where my actual personality is not equal to a given task, or simply when I have time to kill. This is a habit - though some might call it a personality defect - I developed as a small, spindly child, when my dad used to knock me around and I began fantasising about growing up to be a big strong man. Role models I tried out ranged from Charlemagne to John Wayne to Cassius Clay to Keith Richards.\n\nFor one reason or another, all were found wanting. Charlemagne seemed fine during that brief period when I had a crush on the French, but then I found out that the Franks were actually Germans. John Wayne got the heave-ho after I discovered that he was a pigeon-toed draft-dodger masquerading as a tough guy. I liked the idea of pretending that I was Cassius Clay well enough until I found out that Cassius was the name of one of the conspirators who murdered Julius Caesar, a man I greatly admired without ever wishing to impersonate (he was bald). Also, I never really looked all that much like Cassius Clay, though the same could be said about my physical resemblance to Charlemagne. Keith Richards fell by the wayside early because I did not seriously expect him to outlive Brian Jones. That he did, that he is still very much with us, is one of the great mysteries of medical science. But Keith would never have been the ideal candidate for the job, because at no point in his life was he ever a big, strong man.\n\nOne day when I was 11 years old, I saw Burt Lancaster in John Frankenheimer's 1962 film Birdman of Alcatraz. From that moment on, I knew that Lancaster was the man for me. In Birdman of Alcatraz, Lancaster plays a touchy, anti-social murderer serving a life sentence in the famous Frisco Big House, who used his many hours of free time in jail to became an expert on ornithology. The film's message was that no matter how abhorrent the crimes you may have committed, redemption was still possible, provided you developed a worthwhile hobby. At the time, because of a number of prepubescent social transgressions - shoplifting, contempt for authority, daydreams about pushing my father under a truck - I was feeling less than sanguine about my chances of growing up to be a solid citizen, so the Birdman of Alcatraz seemed like the perfect alter ego for me.\n\nFrom that moment on, you couldn't keep me away from the thrushes, starlings and magpies that made our otherwise charm-free urban neighbourhood an avian Eden, and anytime I visited my Aunt Marge's house, Petey the Parrot and I were inseparable companions. But it wasn't just Burt Lancaster as the Birdman of Alcatraz who had me transfixed. It was Lancaster himself. With his rugged good looks, Praxitelean physique, piercing eyes, stentorian voice, and most important of all, that decisive, bellicose set to his teeth that became his trademark, Lancaster was one of the most revered stars of my childhood. He was one of those charismatic tough guys who wanders in off the streets one day, takes a few acting lessons, and soon has an entire nation at his knees. Lancaster, like Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart, was an actor the public fell in love with right off the bat (in the 1946 film The Killers), and they never stopped loving him until the day he died. Like Stewart, but most particularly like Grant, Burt Lancaster was a one-off, an actor so brilliantly original he literally could never be replaced. In this, he was a little bit like Charlemagne.\n\nOne of the things people loved about Burt Lancaster was that he seemed authentic. Because he was a New York street kid who had worked in the circus before entering the film business, Lancaster was completely believable as a trapeze artist, a gunslinger, a lawman, a general, a train engineer, a psychopathic ornithologist, in a way that many other actors were not. To the extent that it was possible, he did his own stunts, and looked damn good doing them.\n\nThat's why, even after my Alcatrazian phase ended, I continued to impersonate the actor. Just like JJ Hunsecker, the gratuitously cruel gossip journalist in Sweet Smell of Success, I grew up to be a gratuitously cruel journalist. My untethered, unoccasioned venom so closely resembled Lancaster's that a few people thought I was the author of the vicious JJ Hunsecker column in Spy magazine. (I was not; the column began appearing before I knew anyone at Spy, and was written by one of the founders, with input from others.)\n\nJJ Hunsecker was not my only inspiration. Like Burt's smarmy Bible-thumping preacher in Elmer Gantry, I have long championed causes I do not believe in, extolling values I do not share, as long as there is money in it. It was Burt's evocation of a dying Sicilian aristocrat trying to come to terms with modern Italian politics in Luchino Visconti's The Leopard (1963) that inspired me to learn the language of Garibaldi at a Gotham school called Parliamo Italiano. It was Burt's unforgettable performance as a menopausal executive in The Swimmer that motivated me to move to Westchester County, where the film takes place. And it was Burt's bravura turn as Wyatt Earp in Gunfight at the OK Corral - especially his sweet but puzzling friendship with the tubercular, dipsomaniacal dentist-turned-gunslinger Doc Holiday (Kirk Douglas) - that decided me to never put myself in harm's way unless I was accompanied by at least one convivial drunk.\n\nWhen I say that Lancaster is my alter ago, I am not being coy or precious in the way I might be if I said that Keanu Reeves or Jason Statham is my alter ego. Throughout my life, to the extent that it is possible, I have tried to emulate Lancaster as often, as enthusiastically and as plausibly as possible, sometimes physically simulating famous shots from his movies. Like JJ Hunsecker, I am often seen wearing glasses I do not actually need, props I don merely because they make me look even more scurrilous. Whenever I have found myself on the beach with a woman, I have tried to embrace her in the same passionate way Burt kisses Deborah Kerr in that unforgettable scene in From Here to Eternity. This has not always gone over so well, particularly with women to whom I had not previously been introduced. It went down even less well with my wife, especially on those occasions when she was not the woman on the beach.\n\nMost tellingly, I have made a fetish out of doing my own research, refusing help from the fresh-faced fact-checkers whose services magazines regularly offer me. I do this because I want to be just like Burt Lancaster up there on that high wire in Trapeze. When people read a book or an article with my name on it, I want them to enter into our evanescent relationship confident in the knowledge that every single word is my own. Like Burt, but unlike many sleazebag journalists I know, I do my own stunts.\n\nOne of the most admirable things about Burt Lancaster is that he found a graceful way to get off the stage once he understood that his box-office magic was fading. Unlike so many other over-the-hill matinee idols, portly ghosts of days of yore who hang around forever taking roles they are far too old to play, romancing glamorous co-stars young enough to be their granddaughters, Lancaster decided at a certain point in his 50s to accept smaller roles, to appear in less glitzy films, and to make even more films overseas. Some of his finest work can be found in Valdez Is Coming, where he played an incommunicative but indefatigable Mexican lawman sporting a brazenly unfashionable hat; in Local Hero, where he was cast as an eccentric oilman; in Atlantic City, where he played an ageing Lothario down on his luck; and in 1900, where he played an ageing Italian gentleman trapped in an incomprehensible foreign film: Last Tango in Tuscany, if you will.\n\nAll of these films had a tremendous influence on me. Because of Valdez Is Coming, I often speak in heavily accented English, trying to pass myself as a lawman just up from Puerto Vallerta. Atlantic City instilled in me the as yet (and for obvious reasons) unfulfilled desire to spy on beautiful women as they smear lemon oil on their breasts. To be perfectly honest, they wouldn't even have to be beautiful. Local Hero prodded me to visit the picture-perfect Scottish fishing village where the film takes place, and even to phone home and wake a close friend to tell him I was calling from the little red phone box that serves as a running joke in the film. As it was six in the morning, US time, when I dialled, my friend did not appreciate the call. It didn't help that he had never seen the movie.\n\nNow in my 50s, I have reached the point in my career where I too must step back and accept a less commanding role on the grand stage of life. Older, wiser, but somewhat less steady on my pins, I can no longer mix it up with the boys the way Burt does in Vera Cruz, The Professionals, Desert Fury, Apache. Yet every single day of my life, Burt is there as a steadying hand. The other day, when I wrote something needlessly cruel about Madonna, I did it because of Sweet Smell of Success. This morning, when I fed a pack of pigeons that didn't look all that hungry, it was because of Birdman of Alcatraz. This very afternoon, I will sneak into a neighbour's back yard and frolic in his pool the way Lancaster did in The Swimmer. Thankfully, there isn't any water in the pool at this time of year. Last but not least, before I go to bed tonight, I'll accost at least one tough guy who's mistreating a defenceless little kid, grab his arm, and channelling Elmer Gantry, set my teeth in a cruel, determined way, and demand: \"Didn't anybody ever tell you that hurts?\"\n\nI wish somebody had said that to my dad."
