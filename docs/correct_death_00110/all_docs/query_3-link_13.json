        "text": "For the pioneer aviator, see Bill Lancaster (aviator).\n\nAmerican screenwriter (1947–1997)\n\nWilliam Henry Lancaster (November 17, 1947[2] – January 4, 1997) was an American screenwriter and actor.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nHe was born November 17, 1947, in Los Angeles, California, the son of Burt Lancaster (1913–1994) and Norma Anderson (1917–1988). He contracted polio at an early age, leaving one leg shorter than the other.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nLancaster, who resembled his famous father at the time, guest-starred in an episode of the television series The Big Valley in 1967. Lancaster played the role of \"King\", the boyfriend of a murdered college student in The Midnight Man (1974), a mystery film starring and co-directed by his father.\n\nLancaster's best-known work is his adapted screenplay for John Carpenter's The Thing.[3] He also penned the original screenplays for two of The Bad News Bears films.[4]\n\nIn 1982, he worked on a first-draft script of an adaptation of Stephen King's novel Firestarter for Carpenter to direct. Months later of the same year, Carpenter hired Bill Phillips to work on a rewrite of Lancaster's draft. When The Thing did not match the studio's financial expectations, Universal replaced Carpenter with Mark L. Lester and both drafts were scrapped in favor of Stanley Mann's draft.[5]\n\nLancaster is featured in the documentary The Thing: Terror Takes Shape, found on the collector's edition DVD of The Thing. Lancaster states that he did not think Who Goes There? was a \"great\" story, but that he responded to the tale's sense of claustrophobia and paranoia. The documentary is dedicated to him.[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLancaster was married to Kippie Kovacs, daughter of the comedian Ernie Kovacs.[6] They had one child, daughter Keigh Kristin.[7]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nLancaster died of a heart attack at the age of 49. His ashes were buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, where his father's ashes are also interred.[8] The ashes of his daughter Keigh, who died in 2017 at age 51, were buried with her father's in the same plot.[7]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nScreenplays\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Bad News Bears (1976)\n\nThe Bad News Bears Go to Japan (1978) (Also co-producer)\n\nThe Thing (1982)\n\nFirestarter (1984) (earlier unused screenplay)\n\nActing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Big Valley (1967) – Second Boy\n\nMoses the Lawgiver (1974, TV Mini-Series) – Young Moses\n\nThe Midnight Man (1974) – King\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
