        "text": "Kirk Douglas has finally left us after 103 years. But he’ll always be Hollywood’s forever man.\n\nThe ragman’s son turned self-made superstar embodied the American dream — and the dream the movies promoted, too. Loved by millions, kind of married into aristocracy, started a dynasty and in more than one way, he proved heroic offscreen as well.\n\nWell, not always in his films. Perhaps the main thing that Douglas the actor will be remembered for is how powerfully and consistently he’d go to the dark extremes of human behavior without tarnishing the “popularity” that was so important to stars of Hollywood’s golden era.\n\nFrom the greatest of films noir “Out of the Past” (1947) to his breakout role as an unscrupulous boxer in “Champion” (1949), “Ace in the Hole’s” (1951) despicable journalist and “The Bad and the Beautiful’s” (1952) manipulative producer, Douglas early on established himself as a guy you had to watch whether you liked him or not.\n\nHe wasn’t the first star to do that, nor to transfer successfully into such moral role models as “Spartacus” (1960) and “Paths of Glory’s” Colonel Dax. But the impactful energy and palpable commitment he brought to those and a variety of other roles felt like something new and powerful at the time, and remains unforgettable.\n\nAs was the man and his life story.\n\nBorn Issur Danielovitch to Jewish immigrant parents from what is now Belarus, the famously cleft-chinned boy grew up poor in Amsterdam, N. Y., with a dysfunctional dad, six sisters and a desperate longing to get out.\n\nDrive, fast-talking charisma and, especially, genuine talent eventually got the still-broke Douglas a special scholarship to New York’s American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where his classmates included Betty Joan Persky (the future Lauren Bacall) and the daughter of a knighted British official, Diana Dill. She became his first wife and the mother of Michael and Joel Douglas, who of course followed their father into show business careers.\n\nAlthough Douglas acknowledged being a hard guy to deal with professionally and often personally, it certainly said something about the guy that he and Diana remained on cordial terms after their divorce, even coming back together late in their lives to make a movie together with their superstar offspring Michael, “It Runs in the Family,” in 2003. Kirk stuck with his second wife, Anne, from 1954 until the end, by most reports happily. Their sons Peter and Eric also pursued the family business. Sadly, Eric died of a drug overdose in 2004.\n\nWhatever real-life darkness there was that Douglas was able to call on for those memorable early roles, however, those who got to know him later in life pretty much had to take his word about how awful he could be from his best-selling books, including the autobiographical “The Ragman’s Son.” A total charmer in public, Douglas had a way of making people he encountered feel like he wanted to be their best friend.\n\nI did several interviews with Douglas, all of which were sheer, open-hearted delights. Two were the most memorable.\n\nOne was with his famously cranky pal and colleague Burt Lancaster for “Tough Guys” (1986), during which Douglas vulnerably, almost neurotically acted like it was his duty to be extra cordial for the both of them.\n\nThe other: When “It Runs in the Family” opened, half a dozen years after the devastating stroke he fought so long and determinedly to recover from. At the start of the interview he shook my hand with a steel-vice grip I can still feel, and would not be deterred from giving voice to every thought fully, however much it was a struggle for him to do so.\n\nKirk and Anne’s philanthropic endeavors have been no less inspiring (and awe-inspiring), from funding school playgrounds throughout Los Angeles to the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City — which dimmed its lights in his honor Wednesday evening — to Harry’s Haven (named after Kirk’s father), the dementia care facility at the Motion Picture and Television Fund’s Woodland Hills retirement campus that’s just been completely overhauled and improved with money from the Douglases.\n\nIt was on the business side of the show business equation, however, where Kirk Douglas arguably became the truest hero.\n\nThough he downplayed his Jewish background while climbing Hollywood’s ladder, Douglas reconnected with his faith and was one of the first Hollywood stars to make a Holocaust-themed film in Israel, “The Juggler” (1953).\n\nIn 1955, he became one of the more successful actors to get out of their studio contract and start his own company, Bryna Productions, named after his mother. That led to two of the films that kick-started Stanley Kubrick’s directing career, “Paths of Glory” and “Spartacus.” The latter was instrumental in breaking the Hollywood blacklist against hiring suspected Communist sympathizers when producer/star Douglas insisted on giving banished screenwriter Dalton Trumbo full on-screen credit.\n\nFor years Kirk failed to get a screen version of a property he controlled, “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” off the ground. On Broadway, he’d played its protagonist — the anti-authoritarian icon Randall Patrick McMurphy, who feigns mental illness to elude being sent to a prison work farm — but eventually sold the film rights to his son, Michael. The subsequent,1975 production starring Jack Nicholson is one of just a handful of movies that have ever won all top five Oscars.\n\nFor all his accomplishments, Hollywood icon Kirk Douglas never snagged a competitive Oscar (he was nominated for “Champion,” “Bad and Beautiful” and portraying Vincent Van Gogh in the 1956 “Lust for Life”). He was given an honorary Academy Award in 1996 “for 50 years as a creative and moral force in the motion picture community.”\n\nWhich, of course, he was.\n\nPerhaps, though, we can find one final, revealing thing about Kirk Douglas in what he said was the favorite of all his films. “Lonely Are the Brave” (1962), was a low-key contemporary Western, scripted by Trumbo, in which the actor underplayed (for him) a cowboy at odds with the modern world, whose primary act of courage was to be who he was no matter how difficult it made life for him.\n\nKirk Douglas made a lot about his life appear magical, which of course is the eternal Hollywood dream. The star was at his most indelible, however, when he dealt with something as hard as his steely, post-stroke grip."
