        "text": "From Here to Eternity is a Lancaster classic\n\nThe trustees for the estate of the late Hollywood star Burt Lancaster have sued movie giant Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM) over profits from the actor's films.\n\nThe suit, filed this week in the Los Angeles Superior Court, claims MGM held back $2m (Â£1.27m) made from Lancaster classics such as Judgment at Nuremberg, The Birdman of Alcatraz and Elmer Gantry.\n\nThe studio declined to comment on the legal action, said MGM spokesman Joseph Fitzgerald.\n\nAccording to the trustees' claim, MGM failed to pay Lancaster's estate its share of earnings from the distribution of Lancaster's films between 1996 and 2001.\n\nBurt Lancaster died in 1994\n\nMGM is also accused of charging excessive distribution fees and deducting excessive amounts of interest on production costs.\n\nLancaster died in October 1994 at the age of 80 after a career taking in more than 70 films over a period of almost 50 years.\n\nHe won an Oscar for his role preaching hellfire and damnation in 1960's Elmer Gantry.\n\nHe also received several Oscar nominations, including one for his role in The Birdman of Alcatraz in 1962 and another for From Here to Eternity.\n\nLater in his career, in the1980s, he appeared in a number of supporting roles.\n\nThese included parts in Local Hero in 1983 and Field of Dreams in 1989."
