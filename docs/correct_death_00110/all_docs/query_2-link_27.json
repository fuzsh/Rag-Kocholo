        "text": "Lancaster, Burton Stephen “Burt”, born 02-11-1913, as one of five children in to the postal worker James Henry Lancaster (1876–1961) and his wife Elizabeth, born Roberts Lancaster (1876–1929). He had two brothers and one sister,James Roberts Lancaster (1910–1961), William Henry Lancaster (1912–1946) and Florence Lancaster( 1917–1918). Burt was married with Norma Mari Anderson Lancaster (1917–1988) ( married in 1946). The couple had one son William Henry “Bill” Lanchaster (1947-1997)\n\n. Bill Lancaster was married to Kippie Kovacs, daughter of the comedian Ernie Kovacs. They had one child, daughter Keigh Kristin. Bill Lancaster died of a heart attack at the age of 49. His ashes were buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, where his father’s ashes are also interred. The ashes of his daughter Keigh, who died in 2017 at age 51, were buried with her father’s in the same plot.\n\nBurt was a tough street kid growing up in East Harlem and took an early interest in gymnastics which led him to the circus becoming an acrobat. An injury put an end to his career. He went from the circus to the U.S. Army. The United States having entered World War II, Lancaster joined the United States Army and performed with the Army’s Twenty-First Special Services Division, one of the military groups organized to follow the troops on the ground and provide USO entertainment to keep up morale. He served with General Mark Clark’s\n\nFifth Army in Italy from 1943–1945.\n\nIn 1953, just before Army General Mark Clark agreed to serve as the 11th president of The Citadel, he was stationed in Japan as the Supreme Commander of the United Nations Command. As the Korean War came to a close, an Army corporal named William Bozeman served alongside Clark as his body guard. Bozeman protected Clark from April 1953 until Clark left the post in October of that same year. Nearly 70 years to the day from when Bozeman met the four-star general, he visited The Citadel to tour the campus, visit Clark’s grave and pay respect to the man he so admired. Bozeman came to the Military College of South Carolina on Feb. 17, just one day after his 94th birthday."
