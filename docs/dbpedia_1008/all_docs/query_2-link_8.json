        "text": "By Johnny Askounis/ info@eurohoops.net\n\nFenerbahce Beko has ruled out Danilo Barthel for at least three weeks after successful arthroscopic knee surgery, the team announced Tuesday.\n\nBarthel, 29, will be re-evaluated in three weeks, as noted in his health update. Depending on the medical exams, a timetable will be set for his return to practices and eventually to game action.\n\nThe German forward/center started his second season at Fener with a brief scoreless outing against Panathinaikos OPAP in Turkish Airlines EuroLeague Regular Season Round 2. Also, he logged seven points and one rebound in his lone appearance in the 2021-22 edition of Turkey’s BSL.\n\nHe did not travel to Germany for the away game versus ALBA Berlin scheduled to be held tonight at the Mercedes-Benz Arena. Achille Polonara is also out due to family reasons. The remaining players on the roster of Sasha Djordjevic will be available on the top end of the first double-game week in the 2021-22 campaign of Europe’s premier club continental competition. UNICS Kazan at home will come up on Thursday. Another home game bringing in archrival Anadolu Efes follows on Monday in BSL Regular Season Round 4.\n\nBarthel, after a couple of EuroLeague seasons as a member of FC Bayern Munich, joined Fenerbahce in July 2020 for his first abroad experience. He registered 6.3 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per EuroLeague contest over 29 appearances, including 18 starts.\n\nHis side is currently 1-1, tied with five more teams in seventh place of the EuroLeague standings. At the domestic level, the team led by Djordjevic is 3-0 and paired with Anadolu Efes on top of the table.\n\nPhoto Credit: Fenerbahce Twitter"
