        "text": "The U.S. basketball team got back to winning — and winning easily.\n\nDamian Lillard scored 21 points and the Americans rebounded from an opening loss with their first victory of these Olympics, romping past Iran 120-66 on Wednesday.\n\nDevin Booker scored 16 points and Jayson Tatum had 14 for the Americans, who had their 25-game Olympic winning streak snapped with an 83-76 loss to France on Sunday.\n\nThe U.S. not only bounced back with a win but did it in a Dream Team-type performance against an overmatched opponent, racing out for transition dunks and stepping back to knock down 3-pointers.\n\n\"We came out with more freedom as individuals and took the shots that we normally take,\" said Kevin Durant. \"And they went in tonight and we guarded up, so it was a good step.\"\n\nAnd they made the shots they normally take. The U.S. knocked down 19 3-pointers and 23 of its 37 shots (62 per cent) inside the arc.\n\nIt was a loud statement that might quiet some of the criticisms the team has heard right from the start of its summer, when it dropped its first two exhibition games.\n\nThose came against a different calibre opponent. The Americans had played some of basketball's best, with games against Spain, Australia and Argentina — the Nos. 2-4 teams in the men's rankings — before facing the seventh-ranked French in the Olympic opener.\n\nBut Iran presented none of the problems of those contenders, a team that only earned its spot in the field in Tokyo by being the highest-finishing Asian team at the 2019 Basketball World Cup. The Iranians are ranked 23rd, ahead of only host Japan — which qualified for the Games automatically as the host country — in this 12-team field.\n\nLillard struggled and then stumbled in his Olympic debut, going 3 for 10 from the field before a costly fall and foul with 17 seconds left.\n\nBut he came out aggressively looking for his shot, a player known for his deep 3-pointers in the NBA having it easy while shooting behind the closer international line.\n\nHe had six of the Americans' 13 3-pointers in the first half. All 11 U.S. players who played in the first half scored — late roster addition Keldon Johnson of the San Antonio Spurs didn't play until the second half.\n\n'We were a bit too unselfish early on'\n\n\"Our chemistry has been great since Day 1,\" Durant said. \"We all decided to be here. This is the national team. But I think we were a bit too unselfish early on, trying not to step on toes. That might have bit us. But tonight guys came out super-aggressive to look for their shot but also keep everybody involved and we were able to make some shots.\n\n\"Damian came out and got it scorching for us. We're going to need that going forward.\n\nFormer NBA centre Hamed Haddadi scored 15 points for Iran (0-2).\n\nThe U.S. and Iran are longtime rival nations in the political arena but have little history in the basketball one. They had played only once before, a U.S. victory in the 2010 world basketball championship in Istanbul.\n\nPlayers on both teams then — Durant was one of them — said it was just a regular game despite the history of tension between their nations and this game looked the same. Players exchanged cordial fist bumps and some pats on the arm before tipoff.\n\nThe Iranians wouldn't be anywhere near the Americans much longer.\n\nThe U.S. led 28-12 after one and pushed the lead to 30 on its 10th 3-pointer in 17 attempts to begin the game, making it 47-17 when Zach LaVine made his second in a row.\n\nThe U.S. plays the Czech Republic on Saturday to close pool play, with a victory guaranteeing the Americans a spot in the single-elimination quarter-finals.\n\nThe Americans are probably through already no matter what thanks to what will be an enormous point differential as a result of this rout.\n\nThe U.S. probably doesn't care what type of team it came against. The Americans just needed to look good against somebody.\n\nThey came into the game just 2-3 this summer after splitting their exhibition games in Las Vegas before the loss to France. They had rarely looked sharp while navigating roster changes, a game cancellation for coronavirus safety concerns and the absence of Jrue Holiday, Khris Middleton and Booker until the eve of their opener because those three had played in the NBA Finals.\n\nHoliday, who was the best American player in the opener, and Booker moved into the starting lineup Wednesday.\n\nGermany defeats Nigeria\n\nJohnannes Voigtmann scored 19 points, and Germany used a 14-0 run in the final minutes to pull away and beat Nigeria 99-92 on Wednesday at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nMoritz Wagner scored 17 points, while Danilo Barthel scored 14, Maodo Lo had 13 and Andreas Obst finished with 12 for Germany (1-1).\n\nBarthel was subbed in after Wagner got his fourth foul late in the third quarter — and made a big impact. He was 4 for 4 from the field in the final period, including the basket that started the 14-0 run that broke an 81-81 tie and put the Germans on top for good.\n\nJordan Nwora scored 33 points for Nigeria (0-2), while Miye Oni scored 15. Nigeria made 17 3-pointers, but was outscored 19-7 from the foul line.\n\nEach team let double-digit leads slide.\n\nGermany started the game on a 22-12 run; Nigeria responded with a 15-2 burst to take a 27-24 lead early in the second quarter. And then it was Nigeria's turn to grab and cede control; a 16-5 run to open the second half put the D'Tigers up 11, but Niels Giffey's 3-pointer rattled in as the third-quarter horn sounded and sent the teams in the final period tied at 74.\n\nThe lead changed hands five times in the opening minutes of the final quarter, before Germany put together the decisive run and wound up taking a big step toward qualifying for next week's knockout stage.\n\nBoth teams will finish their round-robin Group B schedules on Saturday. Nigeria faces Italy, and Germany takes on Australia."
