        "text": "FIBA Basketball World Cup, formerly known as FIBA World Championship from 1950 until 2010, stands as the premier event of the International Basketball Federation.\n\nFIBA World Cup has been the center stage for some of international basketball's greats -- from Oscar Schmidt and Drazen Petrovic to Pau Gasol and Kevin Durant and many in between.\n\nUnfortunately, the upcoming edition will see the absence of many present-day stars. The likes of Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jamal Murray, Jayson Tatum, and others won't grace the FIBA World Cup 2023 courts in Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines.\n\nAmidst this, a particular wonderboy will be in the spotlight. A 24-year-old Slovenian sensation who has already etched his name as the record holder for the second-highest scoring performances in both EuroBasket and Olympic history.\n\nWhenever you see Luka Doncic on the floor, you know something magical awaits you.\n\nSlovenia comes to the FIBA Basketball World Cup without two of their core guys -- NBA champion Vlatko Cancar and former national team captain Edo Muric.\n\nHence, all eyes are on the Dallas Mavericks superstar. Known for his competitive spirit and unique skill set, Doncic stands poised to make a run at individual records in his first World Cup.\n\nFirst of all, no player has ever had a triple-double in a FIBA World Cup game. In 2019, two players came very close to posting the first and historic one.\n\nJoe Ingles had 17 points, 10 rebounds, and 9 assists for Australia against Senegal, while Germany's Dennis Schroder registered 21 points, 10 rebounds, and the same 9 assists in a game vs. Canada.\n\nDoncic has already displayed his triple-double prowess in friendly matches, and his summer tune-up games have produced near triple-double averages of 22.0 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 8.0 assists.\n\nIn addition, Doncic could aim to knock down more than 35 three-pointers during the tournament.\n\nYes, this record needs at least seven games to be realistically possible, and Slovenia will have a tough time in the potential second-phase appearance against formidable teams from Group E (Germany, Finland, Australia, and Japan) joining the squads of Group F.\n\nOn top of that, this pursuit also hinges on Luka maintaining a consistent shooting form, a task complicated by his expected significant workload. In the 2022-23 season, his 3-point shooting stood at 34.2% on 8.2 attempts per game.\n\nIt's worth noting that the record for the most three-pointers in a World Cup is currently shared by Bogdan Bogdanovic, who sank 35 long-range shots in 2019, and Puerto Rico's Larry Ayuso, who achieved the same feat in 2002.\n\nMost 3-pointers made in a single game\n\nNo. Player Team 3-pointers Year 1. Hur Jae South Korea 14 1990 2. Weidong Hu/Larry Ayuso China/Puerto Rico 9 1994/2002 3. Reggie Miller/Kyung-Eun Moon/Nan Li/Nicolas Batum USA/South Korea/China/France 8 1994/1994/2002/2014\n\nWhat sounds more likely is to have a double-double in every tournament game. In 2019, South Korea's big man Guna Ra became the first player to register 15+ points and 10+ rebounds in four consecutive games at a single World Cup since 1994.\n\nHe also carved his name as the sole player to record a double-double in every match of a World Cup.\n\nGiven Doncic's ability to find his teammates and a sense for rebounds, it's conceivable he could replicate the latter accomplishment while extending it across a few additional games.\n\nExpanding on Doncic's proficiency in involving his teammates, the Slovenian could give it a try to improve Dennis Schroder's average assists record, set in 2019. In the previous World Cup edition, the German floor general averaged 9.4 assists per game.\n\nThe all-time single-game assists record belongs to Toni Kukoc, who dished out 15 dimes to his teammates in 1994.\n\nBest assists average during one tournament\n\nNo. Player Team Assists average Year 1.

His legacy looms large as the all-time leading scorer, amassing an impressive 906 career points across four tournaments spanning from 1978 to 1990.\n\nHe is also the all-time highest scorer for a single tournament, averaging 33.7 points per game for the Brazilians in 1990.\n\nFor instance, Doncic averaged 26.0 points last autumn, 23.8 points in the Tokyo Olympics, 21.3 points in the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Kaunas, Lithuania, and 14.3 points in the FIBA EuroBasket 2017 at the age of 18.\n\nBest scoring average during one tournament\n\nNo. Player Team Scoring average Year 1.

Dirk Nowitzki Germany 216 2002\n\nWhen it comes to a single game, this is where Luka Doncic's brilliance could come to the fore.\n\nMavs leader dropped 47 points against France at FIBA EuroBasket 2022 and posted 48 points vs. Argentina in his Olympic debut in Tokyo. He now ranks second in single-game scoring in both of these FIBA competitions.\n\nTurning to World Cup records, South Korea's Hur Jae holds the all-time record of 54 points scored in one game. He did it back in 1990 against Egypt.\n\nThe most recent incredible scoring performance came in 2006 when freshly-baked Hall of Famer Dirk Nowitzki put up a 47-point show over Angola.\n\nMost points in a single game\n\nNo. Player Team Points Opponent Year 1.

Amidst the array of talents, his brilliance is potentially the most dazzling of them all.\n\nOther major individual World Cup records\n\nMost rebounds in a single game\n\nNo. Player Team Rebounds Opponent Year 1.
