        "text": "Our client is a German Basketball Federation development coach and individual skills coach for national players in Germany. In the past, he has worked with world renown players such as Maxi Kleber (German national team/ Dallas Mavericks) and Danilo Barthel (German National team/ Fenerbahce). He needed urgent travel from Germany to support current NBA Draft prospect Oscar Da Silva (Stanford University), who will be participating in the NBA Draft 2021. A National Interest Exemption (NIE) is the only way that athletes and coaches can travel directly to the United States from Europe.\n\nNational Interest Exemption For National Team Members\n\nOscar originally planned to participate within the draft in 2020, unfortunately, due to COVID-19 this was unable to happen. This is the biggest opportunity for Oscar, a Stanford University Senior, to enter the NBA. The opportunity to join the professional ranks in America, and become a global icon, is the most prestigious event for elite athletes. The support and experience of a trusted coach and mentor is critical for young athletes.\n\nTiming And Activities Of The National Interest Waiver\n\nOur office was approached to figure out a way to obtain a NIE and was able to secure one within a week for travel to the United States.\n\nOscar will be attending the NBA G-league from the 19th to the 21st of June and the NBA Combine event from the 21st to the 27th of June. The presence of his personal coach will strengthen his performances and enhance his chances within the draft. Oscar plans to have individual works outs Phoenix Suns, Philadelphia 76ers, Boston Celtics, Charlotte Hornets, Cleveland Cavaliers, Golden State Warriors, Dallas Mavericks, Indiana Pacers, Miami Heat, Oklahoma City Thunder, Sacramento Kings, Toronto Raptors, and the Washington Wizards."
