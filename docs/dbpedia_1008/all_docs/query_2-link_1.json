        "text": "By Eurohoops Team / info@eurohoops.net\n\nEuroLeague big man Danilo Barthel announced his retirement from basketball at 31 years of age due to a persistent knee injury. Barthel was also a longtime member of the German national team, starting from youth categories.\n\nBarthel became well-known in European basketball as a player of Bayern Munich. He joined the Bavarian side in 2016 and in 2018 he led them to the German League title, winning Finals MVP.\n\nIn 2020, Barthel joined EuroLeague powerhouse Fenerbahce Beko where he stayed until 2022. Overall, he played in 94 EuroLeague games throughout four seasons (two with Bayern and two with Fener), averaging 8.7 points and 3.5 rebounds.\n\nHere’s what Barthel wrote on his Instagram profile:\n\n“As I write down these words, a mixture of gratitude and sadness fills my heart. After fighting for more than a year to get back on the court, I have to accept that I will not be able to play basketball anymore. So now the time has come to announce my retirement and I want to thank all of you who have supported me in the last years.\n\nThey say every athletes journey is made from passion, sweat and perseverance. My story was no different. But as life often teaches us, it is not without challenges. A knee injury forces me to retire earlier than expected. The time has come to say goodbye to the basketball court, a place that has been my sanctuary for almost my whole life. This journey, filled with highs and lows, victories and defeats, has been incredible.\n\nTo each organizations, I got to play for: I will be forever thankful for the opportunities and honored to have played in your jerseys. Also a huge thank you to everyone working there – your work “behind the scenes” is impressive and without you giving everything everyday we players would not be able to perform.\n\nTo all the coaches, I was given the opportunity to work with: I’m deeply grateful for being able to learn from and work with you.\n\nTo my fellow teammates: Thank you! The battles we fought, victories we celebrated and the laughter we shared will forever stay in my heart.\n\nI want to thank all the fans for your cheers and support. Playing in front of you and achieve remarkable victories – I will never forget that feeling.\n\nDear Family and Friends, I want to thank you for your unwavering support. Your unconditional encouragement and faith in me have meant the world.\n\nTo my wife Viktoria, your love, understanding and sacrifices have been my rock throughout my career. You’ve supported me through everything.\n\nAs I step away from the court, I carry with me the lessons that basketball has taught me – the importance of teamwork, the value of dedication and the beauty of pushing yourself beyond limits.\n\nThank you basketball and everyone who have been part of this journey – you’ve made it unforgettable.\n\nAs this journey ends, a new begins – let’s see where it takes me.”"
