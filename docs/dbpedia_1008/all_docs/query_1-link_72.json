        "text": "A playoff spot is on the line for Real Madrid tonight in the Spanish capital. Los Blancos can secure an early spot in the quarters with a win over Bayern Munich in Round 23 of the Turkish Airlines Euroleague. The Germans are locked in a 5 team scrap for the final top 8 spots in the standings with just 8 weeks to go in the regular season. The Bavarian side have already proved they can go toe to toe with the heavyweights of the league, and will look to repeat history tonight in the Wizink Center.\n\nLos Blancos have not been playing their best basketball of late. They have lost two of their last four, one of those loses to lowly Bucucnost Voli another to CSKA, and almost blew a 13 points 4th quarter lead against Darussafaka in Istanbul at the begining of February. Before the Domestic Cup break Madrid went to Moscow and dropped a tight 82-78 decision to CSKA. Anthony Randolph led the way for the visitors dropping 20 points, while Gustavo Ayon had 11,6 and 6, but it wasn´t enough to keep up with the leagues highest scroing offense. Meanwhile the reigning Euroleague champs were battered on the boards grabbing only 28 to Moscow´s 40 to drop to third in the table due to head to head advantage for the the Russians.\n\nBayern have been in the hunt all season. At the beginning of this month they got a huge victory at home agianst Fenerbahce, but then had a double dose of dissapointment losing not just the game to Kirolet Baskonia, but the tie breaker with them as well. Derrick Williams led all scorers with 18 points but only got help for Danilo Barthel who knocked down 11. The Germans were within a possesion in the fourth quarter but were undone by dreadful 3 point shooting, going just 4-25 from long range and failed to complete the comeback dropping to 11-11 on the year.\n\nMadrid are a deep team that rely on a handful of players who average 9 points or more, but swingman Anthony Randolph, leads all scorers averaging 13.4 points a game and Sergio Llull gets a shade over 10 a night. The capital city side are 4th in PPG averaging 85 an outing and pull down 36 rebound a night. Gustavo Ayon is the big banger beneath the boards averaging 6.3 RPG, good enough for 5th best in the league.\n\nBayern may have trouble contending with Ayon and Tavares on the interior. The Munich side pull down a league worst 29.9 points a game. So it will be up to one of the leagues leading scorers Derrick Williams to lift Bayern like he did against Fener a couple rounds ago. Williams is 4th in the league in PPG at 14.4 a game, but Dejan Radonjic´s men will need an all around game to try to take down the Spanish giants at home.\n\nBayern are 3-8 on the road this year with only one win away from home against current teams in the playoff picture. Madrid have been nearly perfect at home losing only one game to CSKA back in November. It may be a case of bad timing for Bayern as Real Madrid return to the Wizink Center after a devastating OT loss in the Copa del Rey Final, and this is the typical game where the Madrid will be looking to release a bit of pent up frustration after the controversial title game. Madrid has a chance to wrap up playoff qualification tonight, but will Bayern will want to sneak out of Spain with a win and keep pace with the rest of the teams in the middle of the pack."
