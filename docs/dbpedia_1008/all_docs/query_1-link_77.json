        "text": "Jacob Andrew Kasper (October 3, 1994) is an American professional wrestler and former amateur wrestler currently signed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on the Raw brand under the ring name Julius Creed.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nJacob was born in 1994 in Wheeling, West Virginia to parents Brad and Angie Kasper. He has two brothers named Gregory and Drew. Kasper's early years were spent being a small child. Between 4th and 8th grade, Kasper wrestled at a weight of 90 lbs (41 kg) and was uncertain he would ever play competitively in other sports. He played as a linebacker in football and a catcher in baseball however, held reservations he would ever perform in high-level competition. When he entered high school, Kasper still considered himself undersized. By graduation however, Kasper experienced a growth spurt standing over six feet tall and weighing no less than 180 lbs (82 kg) .\n\nAmateur wrestling career[]\n\nKasper competed in amateur wrestling beginning at 170 lbs (77 kg). He excelled in the sport during each year of high school finishing at 182 (83 kg) lbs and winning a four-year letter. He enrolled at Duke University where he began his 2013–14 freshman year at 184 lbs (85 kg) competing in heavyweight.\n\nDuring the 2015–16 season, Kasper trained at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado, intending to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympic Games. During the 2016–17 season, Kasper competed as Duke's team starter in the 285 lbs (129 kg) heavyweight division. Kasper finished his season with a 30-6 overall record. He finished sixth at the NCAA Championships and became Duke's third All-American in their program's history. After graduating, Kasper returned to Duke where he worked as the assistant coach of the wrestling team.\n\nProfessional wrestling career[]\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (2020–present)[]\n\nKasper was scouted by WWE Hall of Famer Gerald Brisco, a former amateur wrestler himself and a man reputed for holding high recruiting standards when visiting amateur wrestling events. Brisco is also credited for recruiting multiple-time WWE Champion and former NCAA wrestling champion Brock Lesnar.\n\nOn October 8, 2020 it was reported Kasper was one of eight recruits signed by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). He made his televised debut on the September 7, 2021 episode of NXT under the ring name Julius Creed with Brutus Creed under the team name The Creed Brothers as new members of Diamond Mine in a tag team match against Chuckie Viola & Paxton Averill.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nKasper attended Duke University on a full athletic scholarship in wrestling. He pursued a double major in Sociology and Evolutionary Anthropology with a formal concentration in Paleoanthropology and Anatomy. In a 2017 interview, he stated he would pursue a minor in Biology or African and African-American Studies. Kasper has a brother named Drew.\n\nIn wrestling[]\n\nFinishers\n\nSignature moves\n\nEntrance music\n\nNicknames\n\nManagers and valets\n\nTag teams and stables\n\nDiamond Mine\n\nThe Creed Brothers - w/ Brutus Creed\n\nChampionships and accomplishments[]\n\nNXT\n\nNXT Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Brutus Creed\n\n[]\n\nProfile\n\nTwitter\n\nJacob Kasper's Duke University Profile"
