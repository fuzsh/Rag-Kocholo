        "text": "Frankfurt sports offer many diversions for fans. There are three local football or soccer teams, as well as hockey and basketball arenas. A marathon provides a fun competition for the whole family. And the annual cycling competition promises a challenging course for bikers.\n\nFootball / Soccer\n\nWhat would Frankfurt sports be without football? There are four clubs here, including one wildly successful women’s team, the 1. FFC Frankfurt. Eintracht Frankfurt is the most popular and they play in the first-tier Bundesliga. Check out their home games in the 52,000-seat Commerzbank-Arena (Mörfelder Landstrasse 362).\n\nThe smaller clubs are the FSV Frankfurt and Frankfurter FC Germania.\n\nHockey\n\nHockey has quite a good following in the Frankfurt sports scene as well. The local hockey team is the Frankfurt Lions, who play at the Eissporthalle am Ratsweg (located at Am Bornheimer Hang) in Frankfurt’s Bornheim district. Crowds of up to 7,000 come to support them in the matches against their rivals.\n\nBasketball\n\nThe Deutsche Bank Skyliners are another important part of Frankfurt sports. Their home base is the 5,000-seater Ballsporthalle (Silostraße 46). This competitive team won championship games in 2000 and 2004!\n\nMarathon\n\nThis annual event, the Frankfurt-Marathon, is fun for the whole family. There are even special races for the little kids, like the 400-meter Struwwelpeterrennen. The 5K Pretzelrennen is another easy race where finishers get this traditional German treat and some apple juice as a reward. Early birds may want to sign up for the Breakfast Run on Saturday morning.\n\nYou can come to run or watch, but there are many perks for your participation. A free massage is available for all runners and the Pasta Party provides free food and drinks.\n\nCycling\n\nIf you don’t think your feet will carry you to the finish line, you may want to attend the Eschborn-Frankfurt City Loop. Formerly called the Rund um den Henninger-Turm, it is also known as the Frankfurt Grand Prix. This cycling competition is certainly an uphill battle, as the trails go not only though the city but also the surrounding mountainside.\n\nFrankfurt sportsmen and women, as well as foreign competitors, must ensure they are up to the challenge before signing up. ;-)"
