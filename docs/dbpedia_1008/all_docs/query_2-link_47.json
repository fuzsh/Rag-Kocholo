        "text": "This article is part of our EuroLeague Primer series.\n\nPREGAME UPDATES\n\nKhimki has ruled out Alexey Shved and has added Dairis Bertans and Sergey Karasev to its list of inactive players.\n\nTHE SLATE\n\nAX Armani Exchange Milan at Olympiacos Piraeus\n\nKey Injuries: Vladimir Micov (MIL), Kevin Punter (MIL), Kostas Sloukas (OLY), Livio Jean-Charles (OLY)\n\nBest Bets for Success: Milan has gotten a lot out of its offseason additions, as newcomers Malcolm Delaney, Shavon Shields and Kyle Hines are the team's top three scorers after two Rounds. You can make a case for each of them to be included in DraftKings lineups, but Delaney -- although he is the most expensive of the group -- seems to be the safest option, as he has notched eight assists twice and is also getting up 10 shots per game. Although he is just a notch below $10,000 on DraftKings, consider him a headliner if you are looking to fill a lineup with players below that mark. Sloukas is off to a slow start and is banged up, but he's still the most trustworthy player on Olympiacos' roster. If you're looking for someone who figures to be low owned but is capable of a big day, Sloukas -- who averaged 11.6 points, 2.8 rebounds and 6.1 assists last season with Fenerbahce -- could be your man.\n\nDFS Darlings: Milan's roster is a bit top-heavy at the moment, which doesn't leave much room for value plays. Olympiacos, on the other hand, has a couple intriguing affordable options in Sasha Vezenkov and Hassan Martin. Vezenkov averaged 11.2 ppg over the last 11 contests last season, and he has been productive early without scoring as much. Martin is averaging 10.0 points, 4.0 rebounds and a block per game, and at $5,500 on DraftKings it won't take much more than that to reach 5x value.\n\nFC Bayern Munich at Maccabi Playtika Tel Aviv\n\nKey Injuries: Omri Casspi (TEL), Yovel Zoosman (TEL), John DiBartolomeo (TEL)\n\nBest Bets for Success: Unsurprisingly, Scottie Wilbekin bounced back in Round 2 after a quiet opener -- and in a big way, too, putting up 40 points on DraftKings. He didn't shoot the ball well over the first two games, but he did have a big fourth quarter last week, and Maccabi will need him to score the ball to keep pace with a Bayern team that scored the most points over the first two Rounds. The German squad has four players averaging at least 20 points per game on DraftKings, and none will cost more than $8,900 on Wednesday. Wade Baldwin looks like the top option among that group, as he's leading the team in field-goal attempts, is second in minutes played and is also the cheapest of the bunch. Jalen Reynolds' price has jumped significantly, but even at his current rate he would have been one of the top values on the slate over the first two Rounds.\n\nDFS Darlings: Nick Weiler-Babb's price jumped a bit after he returned just shy of 8x value last week, but he still costs just $5,500 on DraftKings, and his big game should earn the EuroLeague rookie another extended look. Ante Zizic took a step forward last week and nearly recorded a double-double. He played in the NBA as recently as last season and should continue garnering consideration on DraftKings as long as his price remains below $7,000.\n\nCSKA Moscow at Fenerbahce Beko Istanbul\n\nKey Injuries: Nikola Milutinov (CSK), Johannes Voigtmann (CSK), Janis Strelnieks (CSK), Danilo Barthel (ULK), Leo Westermann (ULK), Melih Mahmutoglu (ULK), Ahmet Duverioglu (ULK)\n\nBest Bets for Success: This will be the marquee game on Wednesday's schedule, as it features two teams that combined to win three of the last four EuroLeague championships, as well as four players who were either first- or second-team All-EuroLeague last time those awards were handed out. All four of those players -- Mike James, Nando de Colo, Will Clyburn and Jan Vesely -- are off to strong starts and can be counted on week in and week out. The two guards, James and de Colo, are the most likely of that quartet to hit the 30-point mark on DraftKings, but Vesely -- healthy and back in MVP form -- is not far behind and will cost you quite a bit less.\n\nDFS Darlings: CSKA will be even thinner in the frontcourt if Voigtmann sits out, and in that scenario Joel Bolomboy would have even more appeal on DraftKings. On the Fenerbahce side, Johnny Hamilton -- at just $4,300 on DraftKings -- could be worth a dart throw after starting in place of an injured Duverioglu and putting up 18 points in the club's last domestic-league game.\n\nKhimki Moscow Region at Real Madrid\n\nKey Injuries: Alexey Shved (KHI), Greg Monroe (KHI), Janis Timma (KH), Jordan Mickey (KHI), Stefan Jovic (KHI), Dairis Bertans (KHI), Evgeny Voronov (KHI), Jeffery Taylor (MAD)\n\nBest Bets for Success: This game looks ripe for fantasy points, as Madrid allowed the second-most points and Khimki the third-most over the first two Rounds. Also consider the Russian team may only have seven players available, which could lead Madrid to push the pace more than usual. There have been conflicting reports on Shved's status for Round 3, but it seems more likely he remains sidelined than not. If that's the case, expect Jonas Jerebko and Devin Booker to remain the top scoring options for the short-handed Russian squad. Facundo Campazzo and Walter Tavares reminded fantasy players over the first two Rounds that they are about as safe as fantasy options come.\n\nDFS Darlings: You can put Vyacheslav Zaytsev in the top category if Shved sits out, which would make him an absolute steal on DraftKings at just $5,600. Dairis Bertans would slot in here if he plays, but his availability may not be known until after the game starts, and that's certainly not ideal. If you're looking to use another cheap player on Khimki's roster in your DraftKings lineups, take a look at a $4,900 Sergei Monia, who he notched at least two tallies in four different categories with just seven Khimki players taking the court in Round 2. Madrid's Anthony Randolph is not nearly as cheap as the players just mentioned, but he's far better than the stats he has put up to date, and he's among the group of players that figure to be low owned but are capable of putting up the same type of points as the top players on the board.\n\nThe author(s) of this article may play in daily fantasy contests including – but not limited to – games that they have provided recommendations or advice on in this article.
