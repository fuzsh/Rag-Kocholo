        "text": "07.08.2024 14:54 source: Frankfurter Rundschau; author: Miguel Ciołczyk Garcia\n\nIn a statement to a local media outlet, a member of Eintracht Frankfurt's board of directors played open cards and announced that the club would be willing to host a new arena if one is built next to the stadium. However, he did not rule out the construction of a new facility, although, as he admitted, the initiative is not even in the planning phase yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA sports hall next to the stadium\n\nIn an interview with Frankfurter Rundschau, Eintracht Frankfurt board member Axel Hellman announced that if the long-discussed sports hall project comes to fruition in its proposed form, the club is ready to become the arena's operator.\n\nThis one will, however, be selected through a tender process, but only if the city council votes on the project, and if the arena is indeed built in the immediate vicinity of Waldstadion. The estimated cost of the investment is €260 million, and the beneficiaries would primarily be the basketball (Skyliners Frankfurt) and hockey (Löwen Frankfurt) teams.\n\nA new stadium “by 2035, 2040\"\n\nAlthough Hellman admitted, when asked about the possibility of a new stadium for Eintracht, that there are no concrete plans yet, he noted that it is important to start thinking about it. If you want a stadium that meets modern standards by 2035-2040, you have to start planning now, - he noted.\n\nAccording to Frankfurter Rundschau, Frankfurt mayor's spokeswoman Caroline Nützel did not explicitly respond to this speculation because, according to her, this issue does not occupy her boss. The priority for now is the new hall."
