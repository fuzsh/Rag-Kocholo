Danilo Barthel has embarked on a new experience, exploring uncharted territory.

The 31-year-old, who represented Germany in the Tokyo Olympics two years ago, has taken on the role of assistant coach for the U18 German national team.

Barthel and the U18 coaching staff are set to commence their initial training sessions this summer, with their sights set on the FIBA U18 European Championship in Nis, Serbia.

Within the team, Barthel will primarily focus on improving the skills of the big men players.

"It's all about the detail work. For me, it is important to use my experience in the best possible way in order to improve the players in different game situations," Barthel said.

Having last competed for Fenerbahce Beko Istanbul during the 2021-22 season, Barthel's final EuroLeague appearance dates back to April 8, 2022.

Prior to this, Barthel enjoyed a successful four-year spell at FC Bayern Munich, where he clinched the German League championship and earned the accolade of Finals MVP in 2018.

Unfortunately, his playing career is plagued with knee injuries.
