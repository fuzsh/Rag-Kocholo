        "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJump to: navigation, search\n\nPortland is a city located in the Northwestern United States, near the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers in the state of Oregon. As of July 2008, it has an estimated population of 575,930,[5], making it the thirtieth most populous in the United States, and has been referred to as the greenest city in the United States.[6] Portland is Oregon's most populous city, and the third most populous city in the Pacific Northwest, after Vancouver, British Columbia, and Seattle, Washington. Approximately two million people live in the Portland metropolitan area (MSA), the 23rd most populous in the United States as of July 2006.[7]\n\nPortland was incorporated in 1851 and is the county seat of Multnomah County.[8] The city extends slightly into Washington County to the west and Clackamas County to the south. It is governed by a commission-based government headed by a mayor and four other commissioners.\n\nThe city and region are noted for strong land-use planning[9] and investment in light rail, supported by Metro, a distinctive regional-government scheme. Portland is also known for its large number of microbreweries and microdistilleries, and as the home of the Trail Blazers NBA basketball team.\n\nPortland lies in the Marine west coast climate region, marked by warm, dry summers and rainy but temperate winters. This climate is ideal for growing roses, and for more than a century, Portland has been known as \"The City of Roses\"[10][11] with many rose gardensâmost prominently the International Rose Test Garden.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n1.1 Nicknames\n\n2 Geography\n\n2.1 Topography\n\n2.2 Climate\n\n3 Cityscape\n\n3.1 Parks and gardens\n\n4 Culture and contemporary life\n\n4.1 Entertainment and performing arts\n\n4.2 Tourism\n\n4.3 Shopping\n\n4.4 Breweries\n\n4.5 Cuisine\n\n4.6 Sports\n\n4.7 Media\n\n5 Economy\n\n5.1 Real estate and construction\n\n5.2 Manufacturing\n\n5.3 Logistics\n\n6 Transportation\n\n7 Law and government\n\n7.1 Planning and development\n\n7.2 Free speech\n\n8 Demographics\n\n9 Education\n\n10 Sister cities\n\n11 See also\n\n12 References\n\n13 Further reading\n\n14 External links\n\n15 Related information\n\n[edit] History\n\nMain article: History of Portland, Oregon\n\nPortland started as a spot known as \"the clearing,\"[12] which was on the banks of the Willamette about halfway between Oregon City and Fort Vancouver. In 1843, William Overton saw great commercial potential for this land but lacked the funds required to file a land claim. He struck a bargain with his partner Asa Lovejoy of Boston, Massachusetts: for 25Â¢, Overton would share his claim to the 640 acre (2.6 kmÂ²) site. Overton later sold his half of the claim to Francis W. Pettygrove of Portland, Maine. Pettygrove and Lovejoy each wished to name the new city after his respective home town; this was decided with a coin toss, which Pettygrove won in a series of two out of three tosses.[13] The coin used for this decision, now known as the Portland Penny, is on display in the headquarters of the Oregon Historical Society.\n\nAt the time of its incorporation on February 8, 1851 Portland had over 800 inhabitants,[14] a steam sawmill, a log cabin hotel, and a newspaper, the Weekly Oregonian. By 1879, the population had grown to 17,500.[15] The city merged with Albina and East Portland in 1891 and with Linnton and St. Johns in 1915.\n\nPortland's location, with access both to the Pacific Ocean via the Willamette and the Columbia rivers and to the agricultural Tualatin Valley via the \"Great Plank Road\" through a canyon in the West Hills (the route of current-day U.S. Route 26), gave it an advantage over nearby ports, and it grew quickly.[16] It remained the major port in the Pacific Northwest for much of the 19th century, until the 1890s, when Seattle's deepwater harbor was connected to the rest of the mainland by rail, affording an inland route without the treacherous navigation of the Columbia River.\n\n[edit] Nicknames\n\nMain article: Nicknames of Portland, Oregon\n\nThe most common nickname for Portland is The City of Roses.[17] Other nicknames include Stumptown,[18] Bridgetown,[19] Rip City, Little Beirut, and PDX.\n\n[edit] Geography\n\n[edit] Topography\n\nPortland lies at the northern end of Oregon's most populated region, the Willamette Valley. However, as the metropolitan area is culturally and politically distinct from the rest of the valley, local usage often excludes Portland from the valley proper. Although almost all of Portland lies within Multnomah County, small portions of the city lie within Clackamas and Washington counties with mid-2005 populations estimated at 785 and 1,455, respectively. The Willamette River runs north through the city center, separating the east and west sections of the city before veering northwest to join with the Columbia River (which separates the state of Washington from the state of Oregon) a short distance north of the city.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 145.4 sq mi (376.5 kmÂ²). 134.3 sq mi (347.9 kmÂ²) of it is land and 11.1 sq mi (28.6 kmÂ²), or 7.6%, is water.[20]\n\nPortland lies on top of an extinct Plio-Pleistocene volcanic field known as the Boring Lava Field.[21] The Boring Lava Field includes at least 32 cinder cones such as Mount Tabor,[22] and its center lies in Southeast Portland. The dormant but potentially active volcano Mount Hood to the east of Portland is easily visible from much of the city during clear weather. The active volcano Mount Saint Helens to the north in Washington is visible in the distance from high-elevation locations in the city and is close enough to have dusted the city with volcanic ash after an eruption on May 18, 1980.[23]\n\n[edit] Climate\n\nPortland lies within the Marine west coast climate zone. Summers in Portland are warm, sunny and rather dry, with July averaging a high of 27 Â°C (81 Â°F) and a low of 14 Â°C (58 Â°F) Heatwaves have been known to occur.(In particular during the months of July and August.) Winters can be mild to chilly, and very moist, with January averaging a high of 8 Â°C (46 Â°F) and a low of 3 Â°C (37 Â°F). The rainfall averages 42.7 inches (1,080 mm) per year in downtown Portland. Portland averages 155 days with measurable precipitation a year. Snowfall occurs no more than a few times per year, although the city has been known to see major snow and ice storms thanks to cold air outflow from the Columbia River Gorge. The city's winter snowfall totals have ranged from just a trace on many occasions, to 154.7 cm (60.9 inches) in 1892-93. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Portland was â19 Â°C (â3 Â°F), set on February 2, 1950. The highest temperature ever recorded was 42 Â°C (107 Â°F), set on July 30, 1965 as well as August 8, 1981 and August 10, 1981. Temperatures of 38 Â°C (100 Â°F) have been recorded in each of the months from May through September.\n\n[edit] Cityscape\n\nPortland straddles the Willamette River near its confluence with the Columbia River. The denser and earlier-developed west side is mostly hemmed in by the nearby West Hills (Tualatin Mountains), though it extends over them to the border with Washington County. The flatter east side fans out for about 180 blocks, until it meets the suburb of Gresham. Rural Multnomah County lies farther east.\n\nIn 1891 the cities of Portland, Albina, and East Portland were consolidated, and duplicate street names were given new names. The \"great renumbering\" on September 2, 1931 standardized street naming patterns, and changed house numbers from 20 per block to 100 per block. It divided Portland into five sections: Southwest, Southeast, Northwest, North, and Northeast. Burnside St. divides north and south, and the Willamette River divides east and west. The river curves west five blocks north of Burnside and in place of it, Williams Ave. is used as a divider. The North section lies between Williams Ave. and the Willamette River to the west.\n\nOn the west side, the RiverPlace, John's Landing and South Waterfront Districts lie in a \"sixth quadrant\" where addresses go higher from west to east toward the river. This \"sixth quadrant\" is roughly bounded by Naito Parkway and Barbur Boulevard to the west, Montgomery Street to the north and Nevada Street to the south. East-West addresses in this area are denoted with a leading zero.\n\n[edit] Parks and gardens\n\nPortland is proud of its parks and its legacy of preserving open spaces. Parks and greenspace planning date back to John Charles Olmsted's 1903 Report to the Portland Park Board. In 1995, voters in the Portland metropolitan region passed a regional bond measure to acquire valuable natural areas for fish, wildlife, and people. Ten years later, more than 8,100 acres (33 km2) of ecologically valuable natural areas had been purchased and permanently protected from development.[24]\n\nPortland is one of only three cities in the contiguous U.S. with extinct volcanoes within its boundaries (besides Jackson, Mississippi and Bend, Oregon). Mount Tabor Park is known for its scenic views and historic reservoirs.[25]\n\nForest Park is among the largest wilderness parks within city limits in the United States, covering more than 5,000 acres (20 kmÂ²). Portland is also home to Mill Ends Park, the world's smallest park (a two-foot-diameter circle, the park's area is only about 0.3 square m). Washington Park is just west of downtown, and is home to the Oregon Zoo, the Portland Japanese Garden, and the International Rose Test Garden. Nearby is Council Crest Park, the highest point in Portland.\n\nTom McCall Waterfront Park runs along the west bank of the Willamette for the length of downtown. The 37-acre (15 ha) park was built in 1974 after Harbor Drive was removed and now hosts large events throughout the year. Portland's downtown features two groups of contiguous city blocks dedicated for park space; they are referred to as the North and South Park Blocks.\n\nTryon Creek State Natural Area is one of three Oregon State Parks in Portland and the most popular; its creek has a run of steelhead. The other two State Parks are Willamette Stone State Heritage Site located in the West Hills and the Government Island State Recreation Area located in the Columbia River near Portland International Airport.\n\nThe Beverly Cleary Sculpture Garden, which immortalizes three of the award-winning author's best known characters with bronze sculptures, quote plaques, and a fountain, is located in Grant Park, just a few blocks from the real Klickitat Street of \"Henry Huggins\" fame.\n\nLeach Botanical Garden is a 15.6-acre (6 ha) botanical garden in the Southeast section of the city, featuring indigenous plants of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nCrystal Springs Rhododendron Garden is a 9.49-acre (4 ha) garden in the southeastern city adjoining Reed College, featuring more than 2,500 rhododendron, azalea, and companion plants.\n\nHoyt Arboretum is a popular Portland open space, covering 185 acres (0.7 km2) of forested ridge-top about two miles (3 km) west of downtown. It is home to a collection of trees representing more than 1,100 species gathered from around the world.\n\nAudubon Society of Portland, founded 1903, is one of the largest and oldest Audubon chapters in the country with over 10,000 members.\n\n[edit] Culture and contemporary life\n\nPortland is well known as a hub of American DIY youth culture. From the late 1980s through today, Portland has been a major center for movements such as zine-making, including hosting such events as the Portland Zine Symposium[26] and home to major zine distributors such as Microcosm. The DIY craft community has also seen a population explosion in Portland since the 1990s and now hosts such events as Crafty Wonderland[27] and regular Church of Craft[28] meetings, and is home to such stores as Knittn' Kitten,[29] SCRAP,[30] and many independently-owned stores such as Bolt, Yarn Garden,[31] and the downtown Fiber District. Portland, is also home to radical feminist and lesbian activist movements as well as the home city of The Worlds Oldest Teenage Drag Queen Pageant\" Rose Bud and Thorn Pageant started in 1975 and modeled after the Imperial Sovereign Rose Court of Oregon,[32], and the city is also considered a haven for punk, hardcore, crust punk and anarchist movements and subgenres, including the self-reliant DIY culture movement that has been part of the aforementioned subcultures.\n\n[edit] Entertainment and performing arts\n\nMajor performing arts institutions include the Oregon Ballet Theatre, Oregon Symphony, Portland Center Stage, and the Portland Opera.\n\nThe city's many theater companies include: Portland Center Stage, Artists Repertory Theatre, Miracle Theatre, Northwest Children's Theater And School, Northwest Classical Theatre Company, Profile Theatre Project, Stark Raving Theatre, and Tears of Joy Theatre.\n\nPortland hosts the world's only HP Lovecraft Film Festival[33] at the Hollywood Theatre.\n\nIt has been home to many performing artists and bands including The Kingsmen, Paul Revere and the Raiders, The Hudson Brothers, The Wipers, Poison Idea, Gary Jarman from The Cribs, Isaac Brock and Johnny Marr of Modest Mouse, Jacob Golden, The Dandy Warhols, Everclear, Elliott Smith, Pink Martini, Floater, Quarterflash, Quasi, Sleater-Kinney, Stephen Malkmus, Blitzen Trapper, Lifesavas, The Decemberists, Glass Candy, The Shins, The Thermals, Menomena, Viva Voce, Portugal. The Man, and M. Ward; animators Matt Groening, Bill Plympton, and Will Vinton; filmmakers Todd Field, Todd Haynes, and Gus Van Sant; actors Sam Elliott, Sally Struthers, and Lindsay Wagner; and authors Agalloch, Jean M. Auel, Beverly Cleary, Katherine Dunn, Donna Kossy, Ursula K. Le Guin, Phillip Margolin, Chuck Palahniuk, and Tom Spanbauer.\n\nAn unusual feature of Portland entertainment is the large number of movie theaters that serve beer, often with second-run or revival films. Examples of these \"brew and view\" theaters include the Academy Theater, Bagdad Theater, Clinton Street Theater, Edgefield, Kennedy School, Laurelhurst Theater, Mission Theater, and St. John's Theater.\n\nThe city was featured in a song by country music legend Loretta Lynn, titled \"Portland Oregon\" in a duet sung with rock star Jack White. The video shows the May-December couple flirting in a bar that was supposedly in Portland, but was in reality located in Nashville, Tennessee. However, footage of actual Portland scenery was interspersed between the bar scenes. [34]\n\n[edit] Tourism\n\nPortland is home to a diverse array of artists and arts organizations, and was named in 2006 by American Style magazine as the tenth best Big City Arts Destination in the U.S.\n\nThe Portland Art Museum owns the city's largest art collection and presents a variety of touring exhibitions each year and with the recent addition of the Modern and Contemporary Art wing it became one of the United States' twenty-five largest museums. Art galleries abound downtown and in the Pearl District, as well as in the Alberta Arts District and other neighborhoods throughout the city.\n\nThe Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) is located on the east bank of the Willamette River across from downtown Portland, and contains a variety of hands-on exhibits covering the physical sciences, life science, earth science, technology, astronomy, and early childhood education. OMSI also has an OMNIMAX Theater and is home to the USS Blueback (SS-581) submarine (which was featured in the film The Hunt for Red October).\n\nPortland is also home to Portland Classical Chinese Garden, an authentic representation of a Suzhou-style walled garden.\n\nPortlandia, a statue on the west side of the Portland Building, is the second-largest hammered-copper statue in the U.S. (after the Statue of Liberty). Portland's public art is managed by the Regional Arts & Culture Council.\n\nPowell's City of Books claims to be the largest independent bookstore in the United States and the largest bookstore west of the Mississippi River.\n\nPortland has five indoor skateparks and is home to the rather historically significant Burnside Skatepark. Gabriel Skatepark is the most recent, which opened on July 12, 2008. Another fourteen are in the planning or development stage.[35]\n\nThe Portland Rose Festival takes place annually in June and includes two parades, dragon boat races, and carnival rides at Tom McCall Waterfront park.\n\nPortland hosts a number of festivals throughout the year in celebration of beer, including the Oregon Brewers Festival. Held each summer during the last full weekend of July, it is the largest outdoor craft beer festival in North America with over 70,000 attendees in 2008.[36] Other major beer festivals throughout the calendar year include the Spring Beer and Wine Festival in April, the North American Organic Brewers Festival in June, the Portland International Beerfest in July,[37] and the Holiday Ale Festival in December.\n\n[edit] Shopping\n\nPortland has many options for shopping. Some of the well known shopping areas are Downtown Portland, N.W. 23rd Avenue, Pearl District, and the Lloyd District. Major department stores include Nordstrom, Macy*s, Saks 5th Avenue, and Mario's. The major malls in the metropolitan area are Bridgeport Village, Washington Square, Clackamas Town Center, Lloyd Center, Vancouver Mall, and Pioneer Place.\n\n[edit] Breweries\n\nPortland is well-known for its microbrewery beer. Oregon Public Broadcasting has documented Portland's role in the microbrew revolution in the United States, in a report called, \"Beervana,\"[38] a term that is also a Portland state of mind.[39][citation needed] Some illustrate Portlanders' interest in the beverage by an offer made in 1888, when local brewer Henry Weinhard volunteered to pump beer from his brewery into the newly dedicated Skidmore Fountain. However, the renown for quality beer dates to the 1980s, when state law was changed to allow consumption of beer on brewery premises. In short order, microbreweries and brewpubs began to pop up all over the city.[citation needed] Their growth was supported by the abundance of local ingredients, including two-row barley, over a dozen varieties of hops, and pure water from the Bull Run Watershed. The Willamette Valley is one of the leading hop growing regions in the United States.\n\nToday, with twenty-eight breweries within the city, Portland is home to more breweries than any other city in the country.[40] The McMenamin brothers alone have over thirty brewpubs, distilleries, and wineries scattered throughout the metropolitan area, several in renovated theaters and other old buildings otherwise destined for demolition. Other notable Portland brewers include Widmer Brothers, BridgePort, and Hair of the Dog, as well as numerous smaller quality brewers. In 1999, author Michael \"Beerhunter\" Jackson called Portland a candidate for the beer capital of the world because the city boasted more breweries than Cologne, Germany. The Portland Oregon Visitors Association is promoting \"Beervana\" and \"Brewtopia\" as nicknames for the city.[41] In mid-January 2006, Mayor Tom Potter officially gave the city a new nickname-- Beertown.[42]\n\n[edit] Cuisine\n\nPortland has a growing restaurant scene, and among three nominees, was recognized by the Food Network Awards as their \"Delicious Destination of the Year: A rising city with a fast-growing food scene\" for 2007.[43] The New York Times also spotlighted Portland for its burgeoning restaurant scene in the same year.[44] Travel + Leisure ranked Portland #9 among all national cities in 2007.[45] The city is also known for being the most vegetarian-friendly city in America.[46]\n\n[edit] Sports\n\nMain article: Sports in Portland, Oregon\n\nPortland is home to the Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association.[47] Beginning in 2011, the city will host a Major League Soccer franchise, which will be a continuation of the Portland Timbers.[48] The city is also host to a top level box lacrosse team in the NLL's LumberJax. The city is also home to a number of minor league teams. Running is a popular sport in the metropolitan area, which hosts the Portland Marathon and much of the Hood to Coast Relay (the world's largest such event).\n\nSkiing and snowboarding are also highly popular, with a number of nearby resorts on Mount Hood, including year-round Timberline.\n\nIt was formerly home to the Portland Rosebuds of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, the first professional sports team in Oregon and the first professional hockey team in the U.S.\n\nPortland has one of the most active bicycle racing scenes in the United States, with hundreds of events sanctioned each year by the Oregon Bicycle Racing Association. Weekly events at Alpenrose Velodrome and Portland International Raceway allow for racing nearly every night of the week during spring and summer, and fall cyclocross races such as the Cross Crusade can have over 1000 riders and boisterous spectators.\n\nClub Sport League Championships Home Venue Founded Portland Trail Blazers Basketball National Basketball Association 1 (1976-77) Rose Garden 1970 Portland Timbers Soccer United Soccer Leagues First Division 0 PGE Park 2001 Portland Winter Hawks Ice hockey Western Hockey League 2 (1982-83, 1997-98) Rose Garden, Memorial Coliseum 1976 Portland Naughty Dogs Paintball National Professional Paintball League Multiple tournaments None 1996 Portland Beavers Baseball Pacific Coast League 0 PGE Park 2001 Rose City Rollers Roller Derby Women's Flat Track Derby Association 0 Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center 2004 Portland Chinooks Basketball International Basketball League 0 Multiple arenas 2005 Portland LumberJax Indoor lacrosse National Lacrosse League 0 Rose Garden 2006 Portland Wolfpack Mixed Martial Arts International Fight League 0 Rose Garden 2006\n\n[edit] Media\n\nThe Oregonian is the only daily general-interest newspaper serving Portland. It also circulates throughout the state and in Clark County, Washington.\n\nSmaller local newspapers, distributed free of charge in newspaper boxes and at venues around the city, include the Portland Tribune (general-interest paper published on Thursdays), Willamette Week (general-interest alternative weekly), the The Portland Mercury (another weekly, targeted at younger urban readers), The Asian Reporter (a weekly covering Asian news, both international and local), and The Portland Chinese Times (a Chinese-language weekly).[49]\n\nPortland Indymedia is one of the oldest and largest Independent Media Centers. The Portland Alliance, a largely anti-authoritarian progressive monthly, is the largest radical print paper in the city. Just Out, published in Portland twice monthly, is the region's foremost LGBT publication. A biweekly paper, Street Roots, is also sold within the city by members of the homeless community.\n\nThe Portland Business Journal, a weekly, covers business-related news, as does The Daily Journal of Commerce. Open Spaces is a quarterly magazine of society, culture, the environment and the arts. Portland Monthly is a monthly news and culture magazine. BarFly Magazine is a popular weekly periodical covering the city's nightlife and bar scene. Exotic Magazine is the major monthly magazine covering the city's adult entertainment and nightlife since 1993. The Mid-county Memo is a neighborhood newspaper serving the Gateway and Parkrose neighborhoods on Portland's east side. The Bee, which is over 100 years old, is another neighborhood newspaper serving the inner southeast neighborhoods. PORT is an art macroblog dedicated to the vibrant art scene that provides daily updates on the arty goings on around town. Oregon Business magazine covers business from a statewide perspective. Oregon Home magazine is the region's remodeling and decor publication.\n\nPortland is well served by television and radio. The metro area is the 22nd largest U.S. market area with 1,086,900 homes and 0.992% of the U.S. market.[citation needed] The major network television affiliates include:\n\nKATU 2 (ABC)\n\nKOIN 6 (CBS)\n\nKGW 8 (NBC)\n\nKOPB-TV 10 Oregon Public Broadcasting (PBS)\n\nKPTV 12 (FOX)\n\nKPXG 22 (ION)\n\nKRCW-TV 32 (The CW)\n\nKUNP-LP 47 (Univision)\n\nKPDX 49 (MyNetworkTV)\n\n[edit] Economy\n\nPortland's metro area population growth has outpaced the national average during the last decade, with current estimates showing an 80% chance of population growth in excess of 60% over the next 50 years.[50] This population growth improved Portland's economic forecast.\n\nâ\n\nPortland's location is beneficial for several industries. Relatively low energy cost, accessible resources, North-South and East-West Interstates, international air terminals, large marine shipping facilities, and both west coast intercontinental railroads are all economic advantages.[51]\n\n[edit] Real estate and construction\n\nOregon's 1973 \"urban growth boundary\" law limits the boundaries for large scale development in each metropolitan area in Oregon.[52] This limits access to utilities such as sewage, water and telecommunications, as well as coverage by fire, police and schools.[52] Originally this law mandated that the city must maintain enough land within the boundary to provide an estimated 20 years of growth, however in 2007 the legislature altered the law to require the maintenance of an estimated 50 years of growth within the boundary, as well as the protection of accompanying farm and rural lands.[50]\n\nThe growth boundary, along with efforts of the PDC to create economic development zones, has led to the development of a large portion of downtown, a large number of mid- and high-rise developments, an overall increase in housing and business density, and an increase in average house prices.[53][54]\n\n[edit] Manufacturing\n\nComputer components manufacturer Intel is the Portland area's largest employer, providing jobs for more than 14,000 residents, with several campuses to the west of the city in the city of Hillsboro.[51] The metro area is home to more than 1,200 technology companies.[51] This high density of technology companies has led to the nickname Silicon Forest being used to describe Portland, a reference to the abundance of trees in the region.\n\nPortland is home to the regional headquarters for Adidas. The metro area serves as the headquarters for the Columbia Sportswear corporation, and Nike, Inc., the only Fortune 500 company which is located primarily in the Portland Metro Area. Philip Knight, co-founder and chairman of Nike, is an Oregon native and University of Oregon alumnus.\n\nThe steel industry's history in Portland predates World War II. By the 1950s, the steel industry became the city's number one industry for employment.[55] The steel industry thrives in the region, with Schnitzer Steel Industries, a prominent steel company, shipping a record 1.15 billion tons of scrap metal to Asia during 2003.[55]\n\nThe aluminum industry expanded in the Portland area during the later half of the 20th century. This was primarily due to the comparatively low cost electricity in the region, courtesy of the many dams on local rivers. The industry has been one of the more intrusive industries politically however, due to the effect on residential and business energy costs to the rest of the city, and the pollution associated with aluminum production.[56]\n\n[edit] Logistics\n\nPortland is the largest shipper of wheat in the United States,[57][58] and is the second largest port for wheat in the world.[59] The marine terminals alone handle over 13 million tons of cargo per year, and is home to one of the largest commercial dry docks in the country.[60][61] The Port of Portland is the third largest U.S. port on the west coast, though it is located about 80 miles (130 km) upriver.[51][61]\n\n[edit] Transportation\n\nMain article: Transportation in Portland, Oregon\n\nThe Portland metropolitan area has transportation services common to major U.S. cities, though Oregon's emphasis on proactive land-use planning and transit-oriented development within the urban growth boundary means that commuters have multiple well-developed options.\n\nSome Portlanders use mass transit for their daily commute. In 2005, 13%[62] rode buses, light rail, or the downtown streetcar. TriMet operates most of the region's buses and the MAX (short for Metropolitan Area Express) light rail system, which connects the city and suburbs. Westside Express Service, or WES, opened in February 2009 as commuter rail for Portland's western suburbs, linking Beaverton and Wilsonville. The Portland Streetcar operates from the south waterfront, through Portland State University and north to nearby homes and shopping districts. In Fareless Square, a designated geographic area centered in downtown, rides on TriMet's buses, MAX, and streetcar are free. Fifth and Sixth Avenues used to be the Portland Transit Mall, devoted primarily to bus traffic with limited automobile access. Intense public transit development continues as two light rail lines are under construction, as well as a new downtown transit mall linking several transit options. Trimet also provides real-time tracking of buses and trains with its TransitTracker [2] and even makes the data available to developers so they can create customized tools of their own. [3].\n\nI-5 connects Portland with the Willamette Valley, Southern Oregon, and California to the south and with Washington to the north. I-405 forms a loop with I-5 around the central downtown area of the city and I-205 is a loop freeway route on the east side which connects to the Portland International Airport. US 26 supports commuting within the metro area and continues to the Pacific Ocean westward and Mount Hood and Central Oregon eastward. US 30 has a main, bypass, and business route through the city extending to Astoria, Oregon to the west; through Gresham, Oregon, and the eastern exurbs, and connects to I-84, traveling towards Boise, Idaho.\n\nPortland's main airport is Portland International Airport, located about 20 minutes by car (40 minutes by MAX) northeast of downtown. In addition Portland is home to Oregon's only public use heliport, the Portland Downtown Heliport. Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Portland at Union Station on three routes. Long-haul train routes include the Coast Starlight (with service from Los Angeles to Seattle) and the Empire Builder (with service from Portland to Chicago.) The Amtrak Cascades commuter trains operate between Vancouver, British Columbia and Eugene, Oregon, and serve Portland several times daily.\n\nThe city is particularly supportive of urban bicycling and has been recognized by the League of American Bicyclists among others for its network of paths and other bicycle-friendly services.[63] The Bicycle Transportation Alliance sponsors an annual Bicycle Commute Challenge, in which thousands of commuters compete for prizes and recognition based on the length and frequency of their commutes.[64] Three and a half percent of commuters bike to work, more than in any other major U.S. city.[62] Car sharing through Zipcar is available to residents of the city and some inner suburbs. Portland has a commuter aerial tram, the Portland Aerial Tram, which connects the South Waterfront district on the Willamette River to the Oregon Health & Science University campus on Marquam Hill above.\n\n[edit] Law and government\n\nSee also: Government of Portland, Oregon\n\nThe city of Portland is governed by the Portland City Council, which includes the Mayor and four Commissionersâand an auditor. Each is elected citywide to serve a four year term. The auditor provides checks and balances in the commission form of government and accountability for the use of public resources. In addition, the auditor provides access to information and reports on various matters of city government.\n\nThe city's Office of Neighborhood Involvement serves as a conduit between city government and 95 neighborhood associations, which are grouped into seven coalitions.\n\nPortland and its surrounding metropolitan area are served by Metro, the United States' only directly elected regional government. Metro's charter includes land use and transportation planning, solid waste management, and map development. It also owns and operates the Oregon Convention Center, Oregon Zoo, Portland Center for the Performing Arts, and Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center. The Multnomah County government also provides many services to the Portland area, along with that of Washington and Clackamas Counties to the west and south.\n\nSince the 1950s, if not earlier, Portland has strongly favored the Democratic Party at all levels of government.[citation needed] Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are Democrats. Democrats also dominate the city's delegation to the Oregon Legislature.\n\nFederally, Portland is split between three congressional districts. Most of the city is in the 3rd District, represented by Earl Blumenauer, who served on the city council from 1986 until his election to Congress in 1996. Most of the city west of the Willamette River is part of the 1st District, represented by David Wu. A small portion of the city is in the 5th District, represented by Kurt Schrader. All three are Democrats; a Republican has not represented a significant portion of Portland since 1975. Both of Oregon's senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, are from Portland. Portland's current Mayor, Sam Adams, became the city's first openly-gay mayor in 2009.[65] As such, Portland became the largest U.S. city with a GLBT mayor.\n\n[edit] Planning and development\n\nThe city consulted with urban planners as far back as 1903. Development of Washington Park and one of the country's finest greenways, the 40 Mile Loop, which interconnects many of the city's parks, began.\n\nPortland is often cited as an example of a city with strong land use planning controls;[9] This is largely the result of statewide land conservation policies adopted in 1973 under Governor Tom McCall, in particular the requirement for an urban growth boundary (UGB) for every city and metropolitan area. The opposite extreme, a city with few or no controls, is typically illustrated by Houston, Texas.[66][67][68][69][70]\n\nPortland's urban growth boundary, adopted in 1979, separates urban areas (where high-density development is encouraged and focused) from traditional farm land (where restrictions on non-agricultural development are very strict).[71] This was atypical in an era when automobile use led many areas to neglect their core cities in favor of development along interstate highways, in suburbs, and satellite cities.\n\nAs the population has grown, and undeveloped land inside the urban growth boundary has dwindled, there has been pressure to change or relax the rules.[citation needed] The rapid growth of two major employers in Washington County, namely Nike and Intel, contributed to this pressure.[citation needed]\n\nThe original state rules included a provision for expanding urban growth boundaries, but critics felt this wasn't being accomplished. In 1995, the State passed a law requiring cities to expand UGBs to provide enough undeveloped land for a 20 year supply of future housing at projected growth levels.[72]\n\nThe Portland Development Commission is a semi-public agency that plays a major role in downtown development; it was created by city voters in 1958 to serve as the city's urban renewal agency. It provides housing and economic development programs within the city, and works behind the scenes with major local developers to create large projects.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the PDC led the razing of a large Italian-Jewish neighborhood downtown, bounded roughly by the I-405 freeway, the Willamette River, 4th Avenue and Market street.\n\nMayor Neil Goldschmidt took office in the 1970s as a proponent of bringing housing and the associated vitality back to the downtown area, which was seen as emptying out after 5pm. The effort has had dramatic effects in the 30 years since, with many thousands of new housing units clustered in 3 areas: north of Portland State University (between the I-405 freeway, SW Broadway, and SW Taylor St.); the RiverPlace development along the waterfront under the Marquam (I-5) bridge; and most notably in the Pearl District (between I-405, Burnside St., NW Northrup St., and NW 9th Ave.).\n\nThe Urban Greenspaces Institute, housed in Portland State University Geography Department's Center for Mapping Research, promotes better integration of the built and natural environments. The institute works on urban park, trail, and natural areas planning issues, both at the local and regional levels.\n\nAccording to Grist magazine, Portland is the second most eco-friendly or \"green\" city in the world trailing only ReykjavÃ­k, Iceland.[73]\n\n[edit] Free speech\n\nBecause of strong free speech protections of the Oregon Constitution upheld by the Oregon Supreme Court which specifically found that full nudity and lap dances in strip clubs are protected speech,[74] Portland is widely considered to have more strip clubs per capita than Las Vegas or San Francisco.[75][76][77]\n\nA judge dismissed charges against a nude bicyclist November 2008 on the grounds that the city's annual World Naked Bike Ride, which has as many as 1200 riders, \"was a well-established tradition in Portland.\"[78]\n\nA state law prohibiting publicly insulting a person likely to provoke a violent response was tested in Portland and struck down unanimously by the State Supreme Court as violating protected free speech and being overly broad.[79]\n\n[edit] Demographics\n\nHistorical populations Census Pop. %Â± 1850 821 â 1860 2,874 250.1% 1870 8,293 188.6% 1880 17,577 111.9% 1890 46,385 163.9% 1900 90,426 94.9% 1910 207,214 129.2% 1920 258,288 24.6% 1930 301,815 16.9% 1940 305,394 1.2% 1950 373,628 22.3% 1960 372,676 â0.3% 1970 382,619 2.7% 1980 366,383 â4.2% 1990 437,319 19.4% 2000 529,121 21.0% [80]\n\nAs of 2008, there are 575,930 people residing in the city, organized into 223,737 households and 118,356 families. The population density is 4,228.38 people per square mile (1,655.31/kmÂ²). There are 237,307 housing units at an average density of 1,766.7/sq mi (682.1/kmÂ²).\n\n2005-2007 American Community Survey Estimates (Race)[81] 74.1% (401,053) non-Hispanic White 8.5% (46,296) Hispanic or Latino (of any race) 7.9% (42,665) Black or African American 7.9% (42,589) Asian 2.9% (15,804) Some other race 2.8% (15,074) American Indian and Alaska Native 0.6% (3,220) Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\n\nCompared to the Oregon state average, Portland's median house value is above state average, and its black, Hispanic, and foreign-born populations are significantly above state average.[citation needed]\n\nOut of 223,737 households, 24.5% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.1% are married couples living together, 10.8% have a female householder with no husband present, and 47.1% are non-families. 34.6% of all households are made up of individuals and 9% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 2.3 and the average family size is 3.\n\nThe age distribution was 21.1% under the age of 18, 10.3% from 18 to 24, 34.7% from 25 to 44, 22.4% from 45 to 64, and 11.6% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 35 years. For every 100 females there are 97.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 95.9 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city is $40,146, and the median income for a family is $50,271. Males have a reported median income of $35,279 versus $29,344 reported for females. The per capita income for the city is $22,643. 13.1% of the population and 8.5% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 15.7% of those under the age of 18 and 10.4% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line. Figures delineating the income levels based on race are not available at this time.\n\nHowever, though the population of the city is increasing, the total population of children is diminishing, which has put pressure on the public school system to close schools. A 2005 study found that Portland is now educating fewer children than it did in 1925, despite the city's population having almost doubled since then, and the city will have to close the equivalent of three to four elementary schools each year for the next decade.[82]\n\nIn 1940, Portland's African-American population was approximately 2,000 and largely consisted of railroad employees and their families.[83] During the war-time liberty ship construction boom, the need for workers drew many blacks to the city. The new influx of blacks settled in specific neighborhoods, such as the Albina district and Vanport. The May, 1948 flood which destroyed Vanport eliminated the only integrated neighborhood, and an influx of blacks into the NE quadrant of the city continued.[83] At 7.90%, Portland's African American population is nearly four times the state average. Over two thirds of Oregon's African-American residents live in Portland.[83] As of the 2000 census, three of its high schools (Cleveland, Lincoln and Wilson) were over 70% white, reflecting the overall population, while Jefferson High School was 76% non-white. The remaining six schools have a higher number of non-whites, including Blacks and Asians. Hispanic students average from 3.3% at Wilson to 14.9% at Roosevelt.[84]\n\n[edit] Education\n\nMain article: Education in Portland, Oregon\n\nPortland is served by six public school districts and many private schools. Portland Public Schools is the largest school district. There are also many colleges and universities- the largest being Portland Community College, Portland State University, and Oregon Health & Science University.\n\n[edit] Sister cities\n\nPortland has nine sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:[85]\n\n[edit] See also\n\nList of people from Portland, Oregon\n\n1972 Portland-Vancouver Tornado\n\nList of hospitals in Portland, Oregon\n\n[edit] References\n\n[edit] Further reading\n\nC.
