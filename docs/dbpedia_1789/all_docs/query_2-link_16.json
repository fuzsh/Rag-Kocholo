This is done by introducing a new area code to the same region as the existing one that needs assistance and more telephone numbers. In this situation, existing customers retain their current area code and phone number while a new code provides more telephone numbers.503 Parent: When the 503 Area Code began running out of available telephone numbers, Area Code 971 was created to provide relief and more telephone numbers for this geographic region. Area Code 503 is considered the parent for all of the overlays listed above.Area Code 503 Prefix Assignment: There are 800 possible prefixes per Area Code. This shows how much of those prefixes have been assigned to a telcom company. A high percentage of assignment shows that numbers are running out and close to being exhausted. When this occurs, Overlays are created to increase how many numbers are available for this geographic area. A geographic region can also be \"split\" into smaller geographic regions. One region retains the existing area code with a new code created for the other region.42.1% [See More]Quick Link: Copy the direct link to the 971 Area Code page and use anywhere you like!\n\nhttps://www.zip-codes.com/area-code/area-code-971.asp\n\nPopulation: The Total Population of all counties in Area Code 971 from the U.S. Census.
