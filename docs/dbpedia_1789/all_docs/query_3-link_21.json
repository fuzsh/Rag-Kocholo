        "text": "Congestion and safety concerns have been increasing over the last few years, and this pilot project aims to reduce the amount of congestion to ensure all visitors have a good experience while visiting federal lands along the corridor. This pilot will allow shuttles and transit to run more reliably, while ensuring all visitors are able to come to the Waterfall Corridor to hike, take in the scenery, and enjoy nature while reducing the impacts from high visitation demand and overcrowding at popular parking lots.\n\nAll personal vehicles using the Waterfall Corridor along Historic Columbia River Highway to access federal lands will need a Waterfall Corridor Timed Use Permit between 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. from just east of the Bridal Veil off-ramp from I-84 (Exit 28) to Ainsworth State Park (Exit 35) from May 24 to Sept. 5, 2022. If you’re traveling by bike, tour bus or by transit, no permit is needed. Angel’s Rest Trailhead and Bridal Veil State Scenic Viewpoint are not within the permit area.\n\nThis in-person permit from the Visitor Center or Historical Museum is only valid for using your personal vehicle to travel along the Waterfall Corridor to federal lands. If you can find an open, marked parking space along the Waterfall Corridor, you can park and visit any site. Parking near Multnomah Falls is popular and spots are not guaranteed. To visit Multnomah Falls using I-84 Exit 31 in your personal vehicle, a separate permit is required and must be purchased online. Go to Multnomah Falls Timed Use Permits.\n\nVisiting​ Multnomah Falls is easy and direct via tour buses and public transit.\n\nDepending on how far you want to ride, you can bike to the Waterfall Corridor or take transit with your bike close to where you want to start your ride. View a bike map. There are limited places outside of and within the Waterfall Corridor to park and begin your ride, such as the Toothrock Trailhead or Bridge of the Gods Trailhead to the east.\n\nColumbia Area Transit's buses run every 30 minutes from the Gateway Transit Center in Portland and from Hood River seven days a week with stops in Troutdale, Cascade Locks and at Multnomah Falls. CAT buses are equipped with three bike racks. Once bike racks are full, no more bicycles can be accommodated.\n\nIf you have a permit, once you arrive, you can stay as long as you like. Parking is not guaranteed. You will not be able to leave the Waterfall Corridor and then re-enter the permit area with the same permit.\n\nBetween 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Oregon Parks and Recreation Department staff will be at the two check-in points off I-84 just east of the Bridal Veil off-ramp (Exit 28) and Ainsworth State Park (Exit 35) and will ask to see your permit. Permits picked up at the Gateway to the Gorge Visitor Center, or Cascade Locks Historical Museum, or a printed or digital copy of a permit obtained online are valid. Once you check-in, you do not need to display your permit. Come on the day listed on your permit, stay as long as you would like. Permits will not be checked when leaving the corridor.\n\nSasquatch Shuttle pricing begins at $15 per person for all day shuttle service with on and off privileges.\n\nGray L​ine Waterfall Trolley tours begin at $21​ per person for all day hop on and off service at one of the nine stops for some sightseeing, exploring or a hike."
