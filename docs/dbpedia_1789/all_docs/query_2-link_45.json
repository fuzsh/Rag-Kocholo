The process of being arrested, taken to jail, fingerprinted, and photographed was probably very dehumanizing to you. Peter Carini is an Oregon DUI Lawyer who can sincerely sympathize with that.\n\nPeter Carini writes:\n\n\"To be honest with you, you're faced with a charge which can have serious outcomes. I don't want to scare you, but let me give you a glimpse of what's in store for you. If your case goes the wrong way you could lose your license ... your insurance could go up or be cancelled ... you could even go to jail.\n\nPlus it doesn't end there. A conviction is something that could haunt you for many years to come, even hurting you when you apply for a job.\n\nI'll Help You Keep Your License and Your Freedom\n\nI know you're fearful about what might happen to you, but I'd like you to know that there's a good chance I can help. Did you know that there are at least 20 possible challenges that can be made to the charges you are facing? I'll raise the applicable challenges for you so your case is as strong as possible.\n\nSure, I can just fill out the forms and talk to the District Attorney, but in many cases the best choice is to fight. That's the kind of case I focus on. My goal is to get you off, to keep your record clean, and to prevent you from losing your freedom and your license to drive. You see, my practice is based on the belief that you were arrested when you shouldn't have been.\n\nAt the very least, I'll make sure that you're being treated fairly.\n\nThe District Attorney prosecutes these types of cases all day. He knows--and is willing to use against you--all of the fine legal points that are available to him/her. The law says that he only needs to prove that after drinking you were not able to drive your car safely or that your blood alcohol exceed a certain limit. That sounds pretty cut and dried, but it's not quite as simple as that.\n\nYou see, if challenged, the DA also has to show that the arresting officer made the arrest properly, that you were properly advised of your rights, that the equipment he used to test you was working accurately, and even that the person operating that equipment was certified to operate it. If he gets information which may prove you innocent, an attorney can make him give you that information also.\n\nYou Will Get the Legal Help You Need\n\nThat's where I come in. I know how and where to make the proper motions which force the DA to prove that all the steps used in your arrest were done properly. If they weren't, then his/her case is weakened. However, all things being equal, I think you'll find that I am well-skilled and that I fiercely protect your rights.\n\nWhen you retain me you'll get expert legal help from an attorney who knows how to guide your case through the complexities of the legal system because I've done it hundreds of times. You'll be certain you are being treated fairly by the judicial system because I'll insist:\n\nthat the District Attorney provide us with the name and address of anyone he plans to call as a witness, as well as copies of every written or recorded statements of their testimony. This will allow us to prepare the kind of questions that can weaken the State's case against you.\n\nthat the DA provide us with any information or material he has which would show that you are not guilty of the charges against you, or which may help you get a lighter sentence.\n\non receiving copies of records showing that the equipment used for tests was functioning properly, and that the person giving the tests was properly certified.\n\non proof that you were advised of all of your rights. If you weren't, the DA's case may be weakened.\n\nI talk to the District Attorney beforehand to get him to produce his proof and let him know that I will be contesting in court all these points I mentioned. As you can see, what looks simple gets pretty complex. As your attorney I will look into all of these things for you so that you will have the best possible case. You're probably like most people arrested for a DUI. You don't really know the right thing to do about it, and you don't know whether or not you can win if you contest your arrest.\n\nIf you would like to meet with me, I will be happy to set up an appointment with you. That way you'll be able to learn all you need to know about your situation.\n\nHere's How Oregon DUI Attorney Peter Carini will Protect Your Rights\n\nWhen we talk, I will analyze the facts of your case, give you my opinion about it, and discuss my approach to it. I'll explain how we'll protect your legal rights, what your options are, and how the whole judicial process works, so you'll know exactly what happens.\n\nPlus, you'll learn how I will guide you through the court system and how I'll champion your rights, using all my ingenuity and the options in the legal system to defend and protect you.\n\nFor example, I'll review the Complaint against you, the steps which were used to conduct the chemical and roadside tests against you to determine if they are valid, and I'll show you how the police officer's testimony can be discredited.\n\nI will also tell you about my fees. Anything you tell me during this and all other meetings will be confidential, whether or not you retain me.\n\nIn summary, with my help you'll get:\n\nPersonalized attention. I'll keep you informed, and answer all questions to help you put the pieces back together.\n\nReasonable fees, and you'll know in advance how you'll be charged.\n\nExperience. For over 8 years I've helped people just like you.\n\nAggressiveness. While I accept peaceful settlements, I take a tough stance to protect you.\n\nSo, if you want an attorney you can talk to, who understands what you want, who is interested in you and your situation, and who fights to get you results, call me today at 541-734-7001.\n\nThe first meeting is only $40, and you'll be able to get all your questions answered. When we are finished, if you're not convinced that I will be able to protect you to your complete satisfaction, then you can leave and I won't trouble you again . . . and you'll owe me nothing more.\n\nIn any event, at the end of the consultation you'll be more knowledgeable, you'll know what to expect in the judicial process, and be able to make more informed decisions about your case.\n\nAnd by the way, your arrest may have included a cancellation of your driving privileges. You only have ten days to respond to this issue."
