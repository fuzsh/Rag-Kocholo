        "text": "It is estimated that Oregon residents generate over 4.2 million tires a year that need to be properly disposed of and recycled. Oregon’s regulatory agency that oversees tire waste is the Department of Environmental Quality, DEQ. DEQ’s mission is to be a leader in restoring, maintaining and enhancing the quality of Oregon’s air, land and water. The Castle Tire team supports DEQ’s mission by being a responsible tire disposal and recycling service provider.\n\nFor good reasons, the state has made it illegal to landfill whole tires. Oregon law requires any business or person that transports or stores more than 100 tires of waste to be permitted by the DEQ. Retreaders may store up to 3,000 tires before they must get a permit. Tire retailers may store up to 1,500 waste tires without a permit. To learn more about DEQ regulation and Oregon tire waste laws, you can visit DEQ’s website by clicking here."
