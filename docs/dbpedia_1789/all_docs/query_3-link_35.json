        "text": "The Oregonian\n\n\"It's -- cozy,\" postal clerk Tara Stiller said in 2015. \"That's a nice way to describe it.\"\n\nIt is a nice way to describe it, but it's not accurate anymore.\n\nA Christmas Eve break-in and vandalism at the 110-square-foot post-office building in Bridal Veil, Oregon, has forced its indefinite temporary closure. Mail is being forwarded to the Corbett Post Office, according to reports.\n\nBridal Veil during its early days (Oregonian archives)\n\nThis is a serious blow to the tiny former lumber town, where wedding-related mail -- soon-to-be-joined couples want the postmark on their invites to read \"Bridal Veil\" -- has been pretty much its only business for years. Bridal Veil is listed on a national ghost towns reference site.\n\nThe last mill in the Columbia River Gorge burgh shut down more than 30 years ago, and the remaining residents packed up and left. Only a few of Bridal Veil's buildings remain, now mostly owned by the federal government.\n\nCustomers visiting the Bridal Veil post office in 1986 (Oregonian)\n\nYet the post office, located at 47100 W. Mill Road, is known far and wide thanks to the town's unique name. For years wedding mail has passed through Bridal Veil from places around the world.\n\nEven NBC News has reported on the post office's \"tiny, nondescript building\" and romantic postmarks -- \"interlocking hearts or interlocking doves.\"\n\nBridal Veil during its logging heyday (Oregonian archives)\n\nNow the building sits empty, with a sign on the door that states: \"Due to a recent break-in, the Bridal Veil Post Office will be closed until further notice.\"\n\nHow bad is the vandalism at the little post office? Pretty bad, it seems.\n\n\"The damage was significant enough to close the facility altogether,\" U.S. Postal Service spokesman Ernie Swanson told Portland Tribune. \"That's something we don't do lightly.\"\n\nThe Oregonian\n\n-- Douglas Perry\n\n@douglasmperry\n\nVisit\n\nto get Oregonian/OregonLive journalism delivered to your email inbox."
