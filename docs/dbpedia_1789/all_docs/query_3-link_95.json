        "text": "On the Trail\n\nAt 620 feet, Multnomah Falls is Oregon’s tallest waterfall and the Columbia Gorge's most iconic landmark. Immense crowds are part of the scene here, as people enjoy the view, the spray, and the trails, along with the coffee, visitor center, and gift shop. More languages are heard at Multnomah Falls than perhaps any other place in Oregon. For quieter contemplation of this natural wonder, visit early or late in the day, or in winter, when ice can shroud the falls. The out-and-back hike to the overlook atop the upper falls is 2.4 miles total, with 800 feet of elevation gain.\n\nPermits & Pets\n\nTimed use permits are required at the I-84, Exit 31 parking lot from 9 a.m.-6 p.m. May 26-Sept. 4. Timed entry offers a one-hour time slot for arrival, but visitors may stay as long as desired.\n\nObtain timed use permit: via Rec.gov (can reserve up to two weeks prior) or U.S. Forest Service.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service administers this site. No permits are required. Dogs must be on leash.\n\nTrail Notes\n\nFrom Multnomah Falls Lodge, walk to the overlook below the lower tier of Multnomah Falls, which drops 69 feet. Then follow the paved trail (Larch Mountain Trail/Trail 441) up to the Benson Bridge, which sits between the two tiers.\n\nBeyond the bridge, the trail switchbacks steeply uphill, with excellent Columbia River views. In 1.1 miles, turn right to the viewpoint atop the upper falls, via Multnomah Falls Overlook Spur Trail/Trail 441A.\n\nWalk 0.1 mile to a wooden overlook that’s thrillingly close to where the upper falls begins its 542-foot drop. (The total drop is 620 feet: 69 in the lower falls, 9 feet between the falls, and 542 feet for the upper falls.)\n\nRetrace your steps to the start.\n\nPlease always stay on the trail and clean your boots before and after you hike. Hikers are a common vector for spreading invasive seeds.\n\nRestrooms are available in Multnomah Falls Lodge’s lower level.\n\nPost-Hike Explorations\n\nSpend some time learning about this iconic place in the lower level of the lodge, at the Visitor Center. It’s jointly staffed by the all-volunteer Friends of Multnomah Falls and the U.S. Forest Service. In the adjacent gift shop are books and maps, along with souvenirs.\n\nOther Hikes from This Trailhead"
