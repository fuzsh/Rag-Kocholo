        "text": "Description\n\nThe Columbia River Zone is all waters of the Columbia River upstream from a north-south line through Buoy 10 at the river mouth and includes those portions of tributaries (including lakes) downstream from the mainline railroad bridges near the tributariesâ mouths except for the Willamette (including Multnomah Channel), Sandy, Hood, Deschutes and Umatilla river systems, Skipanon River, and Youngs Bay. The Columbia River Zone includes, Camas Slough downstream of the HWY 14 Bridge at the eastern tip of Lady Island, downstream from Hwy 730 on the Umatilla River and from Interstate 84 on the Deschutes River, and the lower Skipanon River downstream of the Harbor Street Bridge. The boundary is a straight line across the mouths of the Willamette (including Multnomah Channel), Sandy and Hood rivers and the Hwy 101 Bridge on Youngs Bay\n\nOregon and Washington state waters are defined by the state line which lies within the waters of the Columbia River. In the area from the mouth upstream to Altoona, WA (Rivermile 24), the state line is near the Washington shore. In the area from Altoona, WA upstream to above McNary Dam (except near mainstem dams) the state line is in the middle of the ship channel.\n\nColumbia River Management\n\nMainstem Columbia River fisheries for salmon, steelhead and sturgeon are co-managed by the Oregon and Washington Departments of Fish and Wildlife and the four Treaty Tribes, represented by the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission. Based on discussions among the co-management agencies, Oregon may adopt in-season changes to sport fishery regulations in the Columbia River. Regulation changes can occur on short notice and will be made available to ODFW field offices, the news media and license agents. Anglers can check the status of regulations prior to fishing the Columbia River by checking the ODFW website: myodfw.com for these rules, or calling 503-947-6000 during normal business hours."
