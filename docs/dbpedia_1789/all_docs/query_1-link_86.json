        "text": "One of the best things to do in the Columbia River Gorge is to tour all of the waterfalls on the Oregon side. The popular ones are fairly close together and not far from the main roads running along the river. There is so much epic hiking, sightseeing, and outdoor activities along this route. It is one of the most beautiful places in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nBut with that comes big crowds and fighting for parking spaces, especially in summer. And on the weekends? You may as well plan for spending most of your time in the car as you wait for a parking space to open up.\n\nWhat if I told you there was a better way? A MUCH better way? Leave your car in one convenient parking area, hop on a bus and let a professional drive you up and down the Columbia River Gorge?\n\nIntroducing the Sasquatch Shuttle! These friendly folks will be your escort and your sweet ride so you can explore the best waterfalls in the Columbia River Gorge with ease, at your own pace.\n\nThe shuttle makes stops from the Women’s Forum on the west end of the Gorge, to Vista House, Latourell Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, Angel’s Rest, Wahkeena Falls, Multnomah Falls, and ending at Horsetails Falls at the east end. For more details about hiking in the Columbia River Gorge, visit this website.\n\nThe Sasquatch Shuttle runs about every half-hour, and at each stop there is a Sasquatch Shuttle sign to let you know where to wait for the next shuttle. There’s even a bar code you can scan at each stop with your wristband or your iPhone that will let you know exactly when the next shuttle comes! I found that to be so handy in timing my hikes along the way, so I knew when to be back to catch the next one.\n\nHere are the Details:\n\nTo park in their parking area, it is only $5 per vehicle. The lot is near Bridal Veil Falls, a nice short hike to take with an amazing waterfall to see as soon as you park, or as a last stop before you leave.\n\nIt is a mere $10 per person for your hop-on-hop-off all-day pass. What a bargain!\n\nYou will get a handy wrist band to use as your ‘ticket.’\n\nIf you are a regular visitor to the Gorge, get a yearly pass for $200.\n\nYou can pay online at their website in advance, or just show up in the Sasquatch Shuttle parking lot and pay the friendly staff for parking and wristbands.\n\nChildren 3 and under are FREE, and they offer discounts to military, law enforcement, and first responders.\n\nHere is a Columbia Gorge waterfalls map with all of the stops the shuttle makes.\n\nSo next time you are in the Gorge, take advantage of this awesome service. It is so convenient and will save you so much time and hassle! It may also save you money on gas, as you won’t be driving your car up and down the gorge."
