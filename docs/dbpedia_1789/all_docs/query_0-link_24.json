You can call PDX 311 from a cell phone that does not have a 503/971 area code if the call is placed from within Multnomah County. If you are unable to successfully dial 3-1-1 and are not using a VOIP or office phone, please report the issue so that we can troubleshoot. Alternatively, you can reach PDX 311 by dialing 503-823-4000.\n\nCalling from a VOIP phone\n\nIt is up to individual VOIP providers to make PDX 311 service available to their customers. Once configured, VOIP service should work properly if the user is registered as being located within Multnomah County. If you are a VOIP customer and you are having difficulty calling PDX 311, it is best to contact your respective carrier and let them know you cannot connect. Alternatively, you can reach PDX 311 by dialing 503-823-4000.\n\nCalling from a phone in an office or large organization\n\nMany offices and institutions have complex telephone systems that may need to be configured to allow users to dial 311. If your initial attempt to dial 311 doesn’t work, please try dialing 9 first (9-3-1-1). If you are still unsuccessful, you can contact the telecommunications office for your company or institution and request that they reconfigure the system to allow calls to 311. Alternatively, you can reach PDX 311 by dialing 503-823-4000.\n\nCalling using a relay service\n\nIf you are calling using any type of relay service, such as video relay, Oregon Relay Service, or TTY, please ask to connect to 503-823-4000 to reach the PDX 311.\n\nCalling from outside of Multnomah County"
