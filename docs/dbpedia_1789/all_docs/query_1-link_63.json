Mid-Columbia Propane, which had faithfully served the Columbia Gorge for two decades, joined Carson in 2022. With that brought us Carson Propane’s Hood River branch.\n\nCarson Propane provides propane related services and equipment throughout Southwest Oregon and along both sides of the Columbia River Gorge. Four Carson branches offer propane services: Hood River, Hermiston, Grants Pass and Sutherlin. Carson Propane is amongst our fastest growing service lines, and we look forward to bringing propane to more Carson customers soon."
