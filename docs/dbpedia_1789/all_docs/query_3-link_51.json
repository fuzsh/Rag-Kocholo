        "text": "Wood Village Hub\n\nBeing the Base Camp for all Columbia River Gorge, Mount Hood, and PDX activities is more than just being a “jumping off” point to these destinations. It is about providing information, and a world-class experience. This is what we hope to achieve as a Gorge Hub stop. This joint effort with ODOT, Oregon State Parks, Travel Oregon, and other communities of the Gorge adds a unique and one-of-a-kind experience for residents and travelers through the Gorge along the historic Route 30 Highway and Trail.\n\nWhile each Hub along the route will be unique to the host community, there will be some unifying features. Enhancements around the restrooms include rock retaining walls, accessibility ramps and walkways, added bike racks, additional signage, and landscaping.\n\nThis project was identified in the Parks Master Plan and Capital Improvement Plan. Construction was completed in March of 2020 by Lee Contractors, LLC.\n\nPlan Your Trip\n\nSasquatch Shuttle\n\nSasquatch Shuttle\n\nSasquatch Shuttle offers shuttle service in the Waterfall Corridor from their parking lot just off I-84 at exit 28. Between Memorial Day and Labor Day, Sasquatch will also offer weekend pickup locations at the Gateway to the Gorge Visitor Center in downtown Troutdale. The first pickup at the visitor center will be at 9 a.m., 11 a.m., and 1 p.m. with a 5:30 p.m. drop off only and for guests at McMenamins Edgefield.\n\nFor $15 per person riders can enjoy on and off privileges so they can take extended hikes between attractions or spend the day hopping on and off the shuttle to see them all. Kids 3 and under ride free and dogs are allowed on the buses! Pricing includes parking at their Bridal Veil lot and riders are not required to arrange reservations for access to Multnomah Falls. You also have the option of a buying just a 1-day parking pass for $5 and hike from there.\n\nVisit the Sasquatch Shuttle website for full details including pickup times and route maps.\n\nGOrge Pass & CAT Bus\n\nReady to plan your trip? Be sure to purchase a GOrge Pass for full access to the historic route before embarking on your journey. Hop on your bike or the bus from Donald L Robertson City Park for easy access to the Troutdale CAT bus stop (900 Block NW North Frontage Road). For information on biking the Historic Columbia River Highway, visit the Gorge Pass Bikes page.\n\nVisit by Car\n\nAs of September 6, 2022: No permits are needed.\n\nUpdates on any permit needs for summer 2023 will be posted on the ODOT Waterfall Corridor site in spring 2023.\n\nBetween May 24 and September 5, 2022, a Timed Use Permit was required for each personal vehicle accessing federal lands adjacent to the Waterfall Corridor between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. just east of the Bridal Veil off-ramp (Exit 28) to Ainsworth State Park (Exit 35).\n\nGo Car-Free\n\nVisit Columbia Gorge Car-Free for ideas and tips on car-free trips to the Gorge.\n\nSasquatch Shuttle\n\nSasquatch Shuttle offers shuttle service in the Waterfall Corridor from their parking lot just off I-84 at exit 28.

Hop on your bike or the bus from Donald L Robertson City Park for easy access to the Troutdale CAT bus stop (900 Block NW North Frontage Road).\n\nBike Trail\n\nYou do not need a permit to ride your bike on the Historic Columbia River Highway! Columbia Area Transit’s buses run every 30 minutes from the Gateway Transit Center in Portland and from Hood River seven days a week with stops in Troutdale, Cascade Locks, and at Multnomah Falls. CAT buses are equipped with three bike racks. Once bike racks are full, no more bicycles can be accommodated.\n\nIn addition, the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail is free of motorized vehicles (e-bikes are allowed) and can be accessed from three trailheads that have parking: Toothrock Trailhead, Eagle Creek Day-use Area (requires a USFS Northwest Forest Pass), and the Bridge of the Gods Trailhead in Cascade Locks. Note: Dogs are allowed on the Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail, but must be leashed at all times.\n\nThe Oregon Department of Transportation has a great Biking Map (PDF) to help you plan your route.\n\nFor information on biking the Historic Columbia River Highway, visit the Gorge Pass Bikes website."
