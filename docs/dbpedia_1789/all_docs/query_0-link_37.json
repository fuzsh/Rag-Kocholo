        "text": "492 Zip Codes serve Oregon\n\nOverview\n\nOregon, like the rest of the United States, employs a zip code system to facilitate efficient mail delivery. Zip codes in Oregon typically consist of five digits, with optional additional digits for more precise localization. The first digit of the zip code generally represents a group of U.S. states, and as one moves from the first to the fifth digit, the code becomes increasingly specific to a particular area. In Oregon, lower zip code numbers are generally found in the western part of the state, progressing eastward. Major cities, towns, and regions in Oregon each have their unique zip codes, aiding in the streamlined sorting and delivery of mail throughout the state. The zip code system plays a crucial role in the postal infrastructure, ensuring accurate and timely mail distribution across Oregon's diverse communities."
