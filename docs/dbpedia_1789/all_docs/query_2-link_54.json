Notwithstanding ORS 9.160 and 9.320, in any hearing under ORS 813.410 in which a city attorney or district attorney does not appear, the peace officer who issued the citation for the offense may present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses and make arguments relating to:\n\n(1) The application of statutes and rules to the facts in the case;\n\n(2) The literal meaning of the statutes or rules at issue in the case;\n\n(3) The admissibility of evidence; and\n\n(4) Proper procedures to be used in the hearing.

See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further explanation.\n\n813.420 Duration of suspension for refusal or failure of test. When the Department of Transportation imposes a suspension under ORS 813.410, the suspension shall be for a period of time determined according to the following:\n\n(1) If the suspension is for refusal of a test under ORS 813.100 and the person is not subject to an increase in the suspension time for reasons described in ORS 813.430, the suspension shall be for a period of one year.\n\n(2) If the suspension is for refusal of a test under ORS 813.100 and the person is subject to an increase in the suspension time for reasons described in ORS 813.430, the suspension shall be for a period of three years.\n\n(3) If the suspension is because a breath or blood test under ORS 813.100 disclosed that the person had a level of alcohol in the person's blood that constituted being under the influence of intoxicating liquor under ORS 813.300 and the person is not subject to an increase in the suspension time for reasons described in ORS 813.430, the suspension shall be for a period of 90 days.\n\n(4) If the suspension is because a breath or blood test under ORS 813.100 disclosed that the person had a level of alcohol in the person's blood that constituted being under the influence of intoxicating liquor under ORS 813.300 and the person is subject to an increase in the suspension time for reasons described in ORS 813.430, the suspension shall be for a period of one year. [1985 c.16 §171; 1993 c.305 §7; 1995 c.568 §7]\n\n813.430 Grounds for increase in duration of suspension. This section establishes circumstances under which ORS 813.420 requires an increase in the time for suspension of driving privileges and under which ORS 813.520 requires an increase in the time before the Department of Transportation may issue a hardship permit. A person is subject to an increase in suspension time under this section if any of the following apply:\n\n(1) The person is presently participating in a driving while under the influence of intoxicants diversion program in this state or in any similar alcohol or drug rehabilitation program in this or any other jurisdiction.\n\n(2) Within the five years preceding the date of arrest any of the following occurred:\n\n(a) A suspension of the person's driving privileges under ORS 813.410 or 482.540 (1981 Replacement Part) became effective.\n\n(b) The person was convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants in violation of ORS 813.010 or its statutory counterpart in another jurisdiction or a municipal ordinance.\n\n(c) The person commenced participating in a driving while under the influence of intoxicants diversion program in this state or in any similar alcohol or drug rehabilitation program in this or any other jurisdiction. [1985 c.16 §173; 1985 c.672 §15; 1987 c.801 §12]\n\n813.440 Grounds for hearing on validity of suspension. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 813.410, the Department of Transportation may provide a hearing to determine the validity of a suspension under ORS 813.410 only if the time requirements under ORS 813.410 could not be met because of any of the following:\n\n(a) The person's physical incapacity, verified by a physician to the satisfaction of the department to be of a nature that would prevent the person from making the appropriate request or attending the hearing.\n\n(b) A death in the immediate family of the person, verified to the satisfaction of the department.\n\n(c) An error of the department.\n\n(d) The inability of a subpoenaed police officer to appear due to the officer's illness, vacation or official duty conflicts. The department shall set forth by rule the conditions that constitute official duty conflicts. A hearing may not be rescheduled more than once for reasons described in this paragraph.\n\n(e) A request for a change of administrative law judge under ORS 183.645.\n\n(f) Other just cause as defined by the department by administrative rule.\n\n(2) A hearing held under this section is subject to the same provisions as a hearing held under ORS 813.410, except that the department is not required to hold the hearing and make the determination within the time required by ORS 813.410.\n\n(3) The granting of a hearing under this section shall not delay the imposition of a suspension under ORS 813.410 within the time required under ORS 813.410. However, if a person establishes that the person was deprived by either department error or a subpoenaed police officer's illness, vacation or official duty conflicts of an opportunity to appear at a hearing, the department shall rescind the suspension and shall promptly schedule a subsequent hearing to determine the validity of the suspension under ORS 813.410. In other cases under this section, when the department is unable to hold the hearing within the time required by ORS 813.410, the department shall rescind any suspension imposed under ORS 813.410 only if the department determines, at a hearing held under this section, that the suspension was not valid as described under ORS 813.410.\n\n(4) The following apply to this section:\n\n(a) The department shall issue a final order within 10 days after the hearing described in this section.\n\n(b) If the department has rescinded a suspension under subsection (3) of this section and if the department, at the hearing described in this section, determines that the suspension is valid as described under ORS 813.410, the department shall reinstate the suspension effective five days after the final order is issued.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding ORS 809.430, no additional notice or order of suspension need be given. [1985 c.16 §169; 1985 c.672 §14; 1987 c.272 §5; 1993 c.600 §2; 1999 c.831 §1; 2001 c.294 §§9,10; 2003 c.75 §68]\n\n813.450 Appeal from suspension for refusal or failure of breath test. (1) The petition to the circuit court appealing an order of the Department of Transportation after a hearing under ORS 813.410 shall state the nature of the petitioner's interest and the ground or grounds upon which the petitioner contends the order should be reversed or remanded.\n\n(2) The court shall conduct the review without a jury. Review shall be limited to the record of the department's hearing.\n\n(3) Any party to the proceedings before the circuit court may appeal from the judgment of the court to the Court of Appeals.\n\n(4) Upon review in the circuit court and Court of Appeals, the court may affirm, reverse or remand the order as follows:\n\n(a) If the court finds that the department has erroneously interpreted a provision of law and that a correct interpretation compels a particular action, it shall:\n\n(A) Set aside or modify the order; or\n\n(B) Remand the case to the department for further action under a correct interpretation of the provision of law.\n\n(b) The court shall remand the order to the department if it finds the department's exercise of discretion to be any of the following:\n\n(A) Outside the range of discretion delegated to the agency by law.\n\n(B) Inconsistent with a department rule, an officially stated department position, or a prior department practice, if the inconsistency is not explained by the department.\n\n(C) Otherwise in violation of a constitutional or statutory provision.\n\n(c) The court shall set aside or remand the order if it finds that the order is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n\n(5) Upon review, the court shall affirm the department's order unless the court finds a ground for setting aside, modifying or remanding to the department under a specified provision of this section.\n\n(6) In any review under this section, the court shall also review de novo determinations made by an agency that are subject to ORS 183.650 (4).

If the Department of Transportation verifies to its satisfaction that it has suspended the driving privileges of the wrong person under ORS 813.410 because a person arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicants gave false identification at the time of the arrest, all the following apply:\n\n(1) The department shall immediately rescind the suspension order under the false name and shall issue a suspension order for the period set forth in ORS 813.420 to the person arrested.\n\n(2) The department shall issue the order in the manner set forth in ORS 809.430.\n\n(3) No further notice of suspension need be give"
