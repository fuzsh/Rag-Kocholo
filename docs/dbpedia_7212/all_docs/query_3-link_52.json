You will find this book approaches language acquisition with a balance of OLD SCHOOL and NEW SCHOOL. Comprehensible Input is an important part of language acquisition, and that comes with a well trained instructor who understands the methods and implementation of CI.\n\nHowever, this series also provides new teachers and independent students a very user friendly format to engage with the language through understanding the mechanics and structure of linguistic communication. Every grammar point is explained through the use of Prezi in a step by step format followed by guided practices that are paired to music. If you can finish the guided practice before the song is over with all the right answers, you will be ready to move to the next step. Every Prezi has follow up PDF files for practice activities for listening, reading, writing and speaking. There are similar activities available in each of the vocabulary tabs as well.\n\nEvery unit is followed up with a project based assessment. The ideas for you students to show what they can DO with the knowledge they have garnered from each unit. ​\n\n​\n\nHomepage of each chapter:\n\n1- A summary of the vocabulary and grammar.\n\n2- A link explaining the culture theme.\n\n3- \"Cosas que ya sabes\" (Things you already know). Review of important points learned last year.\n\nRemember that Spanish is a building process and it is very important to make sure that you remember the basics to ensure a strong foundation for the building blocks to come.\n\nIn general, you will not have a quiz or test on the review points of \"Ya sabes\". The objective is for you to experience a quick reminder of these points so that you can effectively build on them with the new material presented in each chapter. This means that you are expected to know the review points and use them properly because although your test may not be on those points specifically, your ability to execute the new material correctly may depend on what you learned last year.\n\nThe drop-down menu of each chapter:\n\nCulture\n\nVocabulary\n\nGrammar lesson 1\n\nGrammar lesson 2\n\nGrammar lesson 3\n\nReview page\n\nVocabulary page of each chapter:\n\n1- Vocabulary section 1 (R-V-1) (1-V-1) (2-V-1) ...\n\n2- Vocabulary secion 2 (R-V-2) (1-V-2) (2-V-2) ...\n\n3- Quizlet button for each section.\n\nYou will need to set up a quizlet account using your school google email account. The teacher will provide a link to join the quizlet class where students will be assigned various activities to help them master the vocabulary of each chapter.\n\nGrammar pages of each chapter:\n\n1- A prezi that will explain the grammar point step by step\n\n2- Assigned worksheets for homework(R-1-A) (1-1-A) (2-1-A)\n\nThe prezi grammar lessons will have built in practice exercises that should be done together in class as \"guided practice\". These guided practice exercises are an excellent way for students to test their understanding at home too!\n\nThere are worksheets/practice activities below each Prezi that can be assigned for homework (consider this as a \"workbook\").\n\nTaking notes:\n\nAlthough the notes for all the grammar points are accessible at the students' fingertips, it is my philosophy that \"writing is part of the learning process\". Therefore, students should take notes while the instructor is presenting the lessons.\n\nReview page of each chapter:\n\n1- Screen shots of the important pages of each Prezi\n\n2- Notes review\n\n​3- Pretest\n\n​"
