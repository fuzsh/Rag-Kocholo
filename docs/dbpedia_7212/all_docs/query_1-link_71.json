In the 19th century, immigrants who arrived in the province from Italian Friuli bought with them their own customs and traditions, which lead to a type of artisan wine production that was based on non-traditional wines such as the raspberry grape. Since then, regional wines have been produced there that are part of the Cordovan identity and cultural heritage. The intensity of its flavour is enhanced by that of the cured meats, sausages and cheeses from Colonia Caroya, where most of the local wine production is concentrated.\n\n* You will need to be 18 or older in order to join the Northern Wine Trail.Â\n\n...\n\n$36 pp\n\nUSD\n\nUnited States Dollars - $\n\nAustralian Dollars - AU$\n\nBrazilian Reals - R$\n\nBritish Pound Sterling - Â£\n\nCanadian Dollars - CA$\n\nChinese Yuan - CNÂ¥\n\nEuros - â¬\n\nHong Kong Dollars - HK$\n\nMexican Pesos - MX$\n\nNew Zealand Dollars - NZ$\n\nSingapore Dollars - SG$\n\nSwiss Francs - CHF\n\nUAE Dirhams - AED\n\nHow to book?\n\nApply and register for an IVHQ volunteer program\n\nYour dedicated IVHQ Program Manager will confirm availability and book your place on your chosen tour(s) and help you organize your trip.\n\nFootball Experience\n\nWelcome to Buenos Aires, the heart of authentic football fervor and home to the Soccer World Champions!

Finally you will visit the Quebrada Dam, Provincial Water Reserve before returning to CÃ³rdoba.\n\nNorthern Wine Trail - Wine arrived in CÃ³rdoba from the hand of the Jesuits. At the beginning of the 16th century, the wine populated the ground of the JesÃºs MarÃ­a ranch, near Colonia Caroya, 54 km from the capital of CÃ³rdoba. In the 19th century, immigrants who arrived in the province from Italian Friuli bought with them their own customs and traditions, which lead to a type of artisan wine production that was based on non-traditional wines such as the raspberry grape. Since then, regional wines have been produced there that are part of the Cordovan identity and cultural heritage. The intensity of its flavour is enhanced by that of the cured meats, sausages and cheeses from Colonia Caroya, where most of the local wine production is concentrated.\n\n* You will need to be 18 or older in order to join the Northern Wine Trail.Â\n\n...\n\n$36 pp\n\nUSD\n\nUnited States Dollars - $\n\nAustralian Dollars - AU$\n\nBrazilian Reals - R$\n\nBritish Pound Sterling - Â£\n\nCanadian Dollars - CA$\n\nChinese Yuan - CNÂ¥\n\nEuros - â¬\n\nHong Kong Dollars - HK$\n\nMexican Pesos - MX$\n\nNew Zealand Dollars - NZ$\n\nSingapore Dollars - SG$\n\nSwiss Francs - CHF\n\nUAE Dirhams - AED\n\nHow to book?\n\nApply and register for an IVHQ volunteer program\n\nYour dedicated IVHQ Program Manager will confirm availability and book your place on your chosen tour(s) and help you organize your trip.\n\nPrivate Spanish Language Lessons\n\nElevate your Spanish skills with personalized, one-on-one lessons led by a certified, native-speaking teacher.\n\nFrom $78\n\nPrivate Spanish Language Lessons\n\nWhile Spanish fluency is not a prerequisite for the IVHQ Argentina - CÃ³rdoba program, volunteer work on certain projects will be restricted with limited language ability.
