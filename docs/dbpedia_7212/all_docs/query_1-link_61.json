I came across this poem and recognized the timelessness of her thoughts. I also have two years of Spanish and this is one of the better translations I have seen (some are so far off it becomes criminal). It cannot be translated word for word - it is the meaning that becomes important - and it's there. I plan on pairing this with with Christina Aguilera's \"Can't Hold Us Down\" to help my students comprehend that literature is a way to communicate about the culture in which it is written and how many similarities there are among different cultures because it is all about humans - and there is much commonality; with gender roles being just one aspect of this. I will say that I do believe there is a bit of venom to it - and rightfully so. To be intelligent and capable but restricted on the basis that you are a woman was just as criminal then as it is now. I'm not saying we haven't made progress in that regard - but we still have a long way to go. There are still parts of the world in which women are not allowed to pursue education or other means of living up to their potential - and only because they were born female and are not considered to have the same value. Although many women have done remarkable things, the same double standard applies. In essence, a man and a woman can both participate in a relationship that shouldn't be - but the man is exalted for it while the woman is condemned - but neither was in the right. Such a patriarchal mode of thought is so antiquidated - and yet it still manages to survive.\n\non Jan 17 2009 01:05 PM PST edit\n\nRead more →"
