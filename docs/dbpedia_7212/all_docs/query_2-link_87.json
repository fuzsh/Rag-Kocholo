        "text": "The Bilingual Review/Revista Bilingüe (BR/RB) was founded in 1973 by a group of students and young faculty members who were passionate about the subjects of bilingualism, ethnic scholarship, the creative literature of U.S. Hispanic communities that displayed code switching for artistic purposes, and bilingual education. The faculty experts on the subject were Eduardo Rivera, who was an English professor, and Gary Francisco Keller, Spanish professor, both at the City College of New York (CCNY). Karen Van Hooft, who was an adjunct faculty member at CCNY and an experienced editor who had worked at Harcourt Brace, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, and elsewhere, became the managing editor. Keller was particularly motivated to create the journal at the City College of New York because, having just completed his PhD in Spanish language and literature at Columbia University and been appointed to his first tenure-track position at CCNY, part of his job was to create an undergraduate and graduate specialization in sociolinguistics and bilingualism in the Department of Foreign Languages. Eduardo Rivera specialized in creative literature and was a writer himself who over the years attained considerable status for his work, including his biographical novel Family Installments, Memories of Growing Up Hispanic (New York: Morrow 1982).\n\nThe first issue of BR/RB was published in 1974 and the journal has been published continuously ever since. It was designed to be a triannual and has retained that format continuously, with the additional feature that we have sometimes published double issues that covered eight months and triple issues, covering an entire year, that were designed in book form with their own covers. For example:\n\nHispanics in the United States: An Anthology of Creative Literature. Ypsilanti, MI: Bilingual Press, Vol. I, 1980, and Vol. II, 1982.\n\n[End Page 141]\n\nCurriculum Resources in Chicano Studies: Undergraduate and Graduate. Tempe, AZ: 1989.\n\nFrom the beginning, each single issue that we published had scholarly articles on such topics as bilingualism, ethnic studies, and bilingual education; works of creative literature, usually poems or short stories; book reviews of both scholarly works and creative literature; and a material-received section. Working with us and usually appointed to the editorial advisory board of BR/RB were a number of well-known professors, emerging faculty, and graduate students. Among these principals on the journal were some bilingual education experts, including Hernán Lafontaine, then the head of bilingual education in New York City, some excellent undergraduate students, and some students who were beginning their graduate studies. One student was Diana Vélez, now a professor at the University of Iowa. We dedicated the first issue of the journal not to bilingual education but to bilingualism."
