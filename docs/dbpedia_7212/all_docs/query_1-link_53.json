        "text": "Online Nahuatl Dictionary, Stephanie Wood, ed. (Eugene, Ore.: Wired Humanities Projects, College of Education, University of Oregon, ©2000–present). The team associated with the Wired Humanities Projects wishes to acknowledge the generous support from the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The \"Documenting Endangered Languages Grant\" underwrote not only the construction of the dictionary, but also the significant contributions of John Sullivan, Eduardo de la Cruz Cruz, Abelardo de la Cruz de la Cruz, Delfina de la Cruz de la Cruz, Victoriano de la Cruz Cruz, Sabina Cruz de la Cruz, Ofelia Cruz Morales, Catalina Cruz de la Cruz, and Manuel de la Cruz Cruz, our much esteemed colleagues from the Zacatecas Institute for Teaching and Research in Ethnology in Zacatecas, Mexico. In all projects involving the Nahuatl language we wish to acknowledge the inspiration and guidance of James Lockhart, Frances Karttunen, and R. Joseph Campbell. Finally, we are thrilled to have enjoyed the technical genius of Ginny White, R. Jamil Jonna, and Len Hatfield, among other outstanding employees, and generous accounting assistance from Teodoro Reyes-Ramírez at the Center for Equity Promotion and numerous student assistants at the University of Oregon. We greatly need and appreciate your donations."
