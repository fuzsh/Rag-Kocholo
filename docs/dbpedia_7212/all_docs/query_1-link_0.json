Read in Spanish without looking up words with our interlinear material The HypLern project has been creating manually word-for-word translated language material since 2006. The aim of our project is to allow students to start reading the language of their choice immediately, and expand their vocabulary fast. This book contains La Cruz Del Diablo by Gustavo Adolfo Becquer, in Spanish. We have added an interlinear translation to the Spanish text. This means that the meaning of every Spanish word is immediately accessible, which in turn will make it much easier for you to expand your Spanish vocabulary fast. How to learn Spanish fast and easyUse the following method to attain new Spanish vocabulary fast and easy. Read the stories and re-read them until you know almost all the words. This is a fast process because there's no lookup time. Then focus on the remaining words that you still don't know by marking those in the text, for example. Because of the literal and idiomatic interlinear text this is the fastest method to learn to read Spanish. Also, contact us on shop.hyplern.com for non-translated pdf versions of this book with which you can practice reading Spanish without the interlinear translation. Check out our HypLern interlinear French, German, Russian, Swedish or other languages on Amazon as well.",
