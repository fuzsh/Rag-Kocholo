Cruz and Mary Elizabeth Perry\n\nTo arrive at complete certainty, this is the mental attitude we should maintain: I will believe that the white object I see is black if that should be the decision of the hierarchical church. — Spiritual Exercises, Ignatius of Loyola\n\nCulture and control became issues of primary importance for public policy during the Counter-Reformation in Spain. From the reign of Ferdinand and Isabel through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Spain experienced the exhilaration and anxiety of attempts to effect meaningful reform that pressed far beyond the confines of religion. The Counter-Reformation was an \"order-seeking\" period, in the words of historian A. G. Dickens, during which officials exerted greater efforts than before to define culture and set limits on how much cultural diversity would be tolerated. Cultural formation, however, is not an internalized phenomenon, but responds to and influences a number of external factors, both political and economic. The consolidation of an empire that grew ever larger in the sixteenth century, for example, posed problems of unification and administration that a more homogeneous culture would have been able to ameliorate. Yet economic development, as the Spanish empire engaged in largescale mercantile capitalism, produced class tensions that threatened the stability of any monolithic culture. The authors of this volume view culture as a social construct ix\n\nx\n\nANNE J. CRUZ AND MARY ELIZABETH PERRY\n\nconstantly in process. As anthropologist Clifford Geertz has argued, culture is best seen as a set of \"control mechanisms,\" or systems of signification, that can assume different patterns. It is the accumulated totality of these patterns, he states, that governs human behavior and gives shape to human experience (45-46). Challenging traditional views that placed biological development before acculturation, Geertz considers culture central to human evolution, and its symbols prerequisites of social existence. In stating that human beings are only \"completed\" or \"finished\" through highly particular forms of culture, Geertz's studies have been crucial to the rethinking of cultural development, particularly in moving away from the nature/nurture controversies and toward a view of symbolic structures as essential to cultural systems. According to Geertz, \"Our ideas, our values, our acts, even our emotions, are, like our nervous system itself, cultural products—products manufactured, indeed, out of tendencies, capacities, and dispositions with which we were born, but manufactured nonetheless\" (50). As an anthropologist, Geertz is mainly interested in the interpretation of culture, in discovering the conceptual structure that, he stresses, lies embedded in symbolic forms. Yet, as Raymond Williams suggested more than a decade before Geertz, culture also involves issues of dominance and conflict. In order to reach an understanding of how individual societies form their members, we must study the nature and origin of the shaping process (312). In a dominant culture, he states, this happens through communication—not passively, but through the interactions of message, reception, and response (312-313). By historicizing cultural production, Williams reminds us that symbolic systems are not only inherited by one group, but equally as often are imposed by another. Culture, then, is a process by which humans construe significance for themselves and the world around them; in its response to external forces, it also represents alternative ideas of the nature of social relationships (325). In the case of Counter-Reformation Spain, alternative means of coexistence were shaped both because of and despite the control imposed by the dominant social and religious groups. Sup-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxi\n\nported by the Monarchy, and through the efforts of the Council of Trent and the Inquisition, the Catholic Church acted as an official organ of cultural production. In the first chapter of this volume, Jean Pierre Dedieu notes that the Church ensured religious instruction through its increasing catechization of the unlettered. Adherence to orthodox religious beliefs was then sought through such symbolic representations as the mass or, as Sara T. Nalle and Gwendolyn Barnes-Karol demonstrate, public devotions to saints and the theatrical rhetoric of religious oratory. The oral recital of prayers, as well as the aural and visual reception of sermons and spectacles, were effective means of impelling the members of society toward cultural and political integration. The consequences of such an integration were complex and far-reaching. According to Jose Antonio Mara vail, the reorganization of social hierarchies culminated in the restoration of seigneurial power through the revalorization of agrarian land ownership. He credits this process with granting new power to the upper classes, which he defines as including the nobility, the Church, wealthy commoners, and state bureaucrats (71-72). Because such social realignments were inherently unstable, however, they both proscribed a return to the earlier feudal system and resulted in a more strongly centralizing monarchy that required that order be imposed, as the continuing tensions between the dominant groups and marginalized subalterns constantly threatened to disrupt the tenuous social balance. The marginalized groups were marked as different either through physical signs, as in the cases of morisco circumcision studied by Bernard Vincent, or metaphorically by the persistent conflicts within the social body, such as the clashes between New and Old Christians documented by Jaime Contreras. In studying gender repression, the chapters by Mary Elizabeth Perry, Anne J. Cruz, Maria Helena Sanchez Ortega, and Alison Weber illustrate the ways in which women endeavored to attend to their own spiritual and economic needs by challenging patriarchal control. John R. Beverley's chapter on the literary Baroque shows just how such paradoxes are contained and exploited within literature. He agrees with John Elliott, who warns against overestimating the passivity of Spanish society and ex-\n\nxii\n\nANNE J. CRUZ AND MARY ELIZABETH PERRY\n\naggerating the dominant group's capacity to manipulate for its own ends since, as Elliott makes clear, \"the works of Spain's Golden Age contain sufficient ambiguities to suggest that subversive subtexts are there for the reading\" (\"Concerto\" 28). The strife between social groups analyzed in the chapters of this volume forms part of a long record of gender, class, and ethnic struggles. From its early history, Spanish culture—its values, traditions, systems of signification, ideas, and institutions—has been heterogeneous and undiminishingly conflictive. Americo Castro often reminded us that Christians, Moslems, and Jews coexisted peaceably until the end of the fourteenth century; he dated the \"conflictive age\" to the span between that period and the total breakdown of caste relations in the seventeenth century (30-31, note 7). While opening the country to the modes of thought of other European countries, Spain's unification under the Catholic Monarchs ensured that only one of the three groups would predominate, dependent as the country was upon the dominance of Christianity and Castilian values over all others. Although both nonconverted Jews and Muslims had recently been expelled from Spain, the sixteenth century's early decades ushered in a period of renewed vitality and intellectual freedom that encouraged the introduction of novel literary styles even as it created the climate for such political uprisings as the comunero rebellion of 1521 (Lynch 1:51). The beginning years of Charles V's reign welcomed reform, in particular the humanistic revival advocated by such philosophers as Erasmus, whose writings were widely admired throughout Spain. The University of Alcala de Henares, founded in 1498 by the Franciscan reformer and archbishop of Toledo, Francisco Ximenez de Cisneros, opened in 1508 and became one of the most renowned centers of learning in Europe. Because of the rising dominance of the Catholic Church, this atmosphere of intellectual and religious openness was to be short-lived. By 1537, the Inquisition, soon to become the leading institution of the Spanish Counter-Reformation, had convicted of heresy both Alfonso de Valdes, Charles V's apologist for the sack of Rome, and Pedro de Lerma, the University of Alcala's chancellor, who was condemned to recant his Erasmian preach-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxiii\n\nings. Juan Luis Vives's letter to Erasmus decrying that \"we can neither speak nor remain silent without danger,\" eloquently illustrated the difficult conditions under which these humanists soon found themselves, and nowhere was the situation more dangerous than in Spain (Lynch 1: 72-73). Prefiguring the Baroque vision of the \"theater state,\" remarked upon by Beverley, with its entangling alliance of politics and art, Hernando de Acuna's sonnet heralding the age of \"one monarch, one empire, one sword\" in reality signaled an era increasingly intolerant and intent upon control. One of the means utilized to program and delimit social behavior was the Inquisition. Originally established in 1478 to maintain religious unity within the Peninsula by exterminating apostasy among those Jews and Muslims who had converted to Christianity, this institution soon extended its jurisdiction to such diverse acts as bigamy, sodomy, and blasphemy. Virgilio Pinto has pointed out that heresy represented a complete breach with the Church, and was viewed as an intellectual crime in that it signified the point where freedom of thought became subject to punishment (304). The Inquisition's powers, therefore, eventually extended to deviant forms of private and public expression that threatened cultural homogeneity. Visually and ideologically similar to the public executions described by Michel Foucault in his study of the French penal system, the Inquisition's public exposure of the victim, paraded through the streets in coroza and sanbenito, and the dreaded autos de fe affirmed the power and superiority of the Church (Foucault 48-49). The climate of fear created by the Inquisition preceded the Counter-Reformation, which was initially a movement begun by the Church to affirm dogma and discuss disciplinary reform so as to deter the encroachment of Protestantism. Religious reform had been attempted in Spain even before the Lutheran revolt; Ximenez de Cisneros's efforts were perhaps the most illustrious example of a movement that would include the Dominicans and Benedictines, as well as the Franciscan Observants, raising the standards of monasticism well before the Carmelite reform. By the beginning of the Council of Trent in 1545, theologians such as Francisco de Vitoria, Melchor Cano, and Domingo de Soto had strengthened the Catholic position, protecting Spain from\n\nxiv\n\nANNE J. CRUZ AND MARY ELIZABETH PERRY\n\nProtestant proselytizing (Lynch 1: 67). The Catholic Church applied its own rigorous programs of instruction through, among others, the catechistical and oratorical methods discussed by Dedieu and Barnes-Karol. Like the Inquisition, then, the reaches of the Counter-Reformation extended far beyond its intended purpose. Meeting for some twenty-five sessions between 1545 and 1563, the Council of Trent reviewed in detail such issues of religious dogma as the constitution and function of the sacraments, consubstantiation, and the adequacy of the Latin Vulgate Bible, as well as those more directly affecting lay public attitudes such as the sacramental character of matrimony, purgatory, indulgences, and the veneration of relics, images, and saints. In an effort to counteract the Protestant Reformation, which rejected the veneration of saints, the Counter-Reformation especially promoted new cults, as Sara T. Nalle demonstrates in her chapter on Saint Julian. Yet the growing interest in spiritual matters became a threat to orthodox doctrine, and as religious occasions became intermingled with everyday concerns, social control depended on increasingly broader inquisitorial powers. If the Reformation left a legacy of political and religious division throughout Europe, Spain's Counter-Reformation would forever mark the country's spiritual, intellectual, and material development. This volume focuses on the climate of repression fostered by the Counter-Reformation, and investigates the varying forms of social control exerted by Spanish institutions, both through the Inquisition and by less overt but equally powerful means. Religious as well as secular rhetoric, whether sermons or popular poetry, and ecclesiastical theater as much as the comedia, all contributed to a growing cultural homogenization. Indeed, all the chapters in this volume demonstrate that no one was entirely free from the strictures imposed by either Church or State, and several of the contributors focus on the diverse methods employed to maintain an atmosphere of conformity and fear. Yet they also recognize the paradoxical nature of these methods, which had to legitimize themselves while drawing precisely on the contingency of social authority. The analyses of the strategies of survival utilized by those minority groups—women, conversos, and moriscos—who suffered the greatest abuses from the\n\nINTRODUCTIO\n\nv\n\ninstitutions in power acknowledge the remarkable resilience of the heterogeneous cultures that had existed for so long on the Iberian Peninsula. While the Inquisition pursued offenders, the Church was concerned with enforcing prescribed behavior through such normative means as prayers, sermons, and the promotion of religious cults. Even before the Council of Trent, the various synods had regulated Church doctrine, stipulating that children and adults learn the four basic prayers. Jean Pierre Dedieu relies on the Toledo synodal decrees in order to document the growing interest of the Church in the religious education of the people. By studying approximately 700 inquisitorial interrogatories, he demonstrates how the male population of New Castile learned the basic Catholic catechism and availed themselves of the sacraments. Dedieu concludes that by the beginning of the seventeenth century, Spain had reached a level of religious education surpassing that of France and Italy. As we have seen, direct religious instruction was only one of several ways that the Church maintained control over its flock. Although literacy was increasing and religious texts flourished, oral and visual reminders of their beliefs helped sustain the people's faith. While Church officials encouraged the veneration of saints, Nalle states that they did so in a reversal of the traditional pattern in which popular enthusiasm for a local saint finally won official recognition. Studying the case of Cuenca, she points out that city government and cathedral chapter worked together to popularize Saint Julian, a medieval bishop whose cult had been all but forgotten. By moving his burial place, disinterring his body, and inviting the faithful to record miracles attributed to his relics, officials resurrected and revitalized his cult in order to strengthen the traditional faith. They held celebrations on his day that emphasized the hierarchy, visual decoration, and drama so essential to Counter-Reformation attempts to control and guide reception of public festivals. To Nalle, these celebrations were performed to impress the public as \"baroque spectacles of power,\" rather than to permit participation in them. This same hierarchy of power was evident in the religious oratory addressed to town audiences. The Council of Trent institutionalized preaching as a means of rhetorically controlling the\n\nxvi\n\nANNE J. CRUZ AND MARY ELIZABETH PERRY\n\npeople and of disseminating social propaganda that encouraged the status quo. In its attempt to regularize oratory, the Church formulated a religious discourse intended to instruct, entertain, and persuade, one that was delivered orally but that also availed itself of novel scriptural constructs. Gwendolyn Barnes-Karol demonstrates how the preachers' power to control public opinion depended upon both their linguistic ability and the dramatic appeal of the sermons. She analyzes the sermons not only for their rhetorical mastery, but also in relation to their semiotic function. Signs such as the preacher's voice, gestures, and dress combined with the theatrical settings of churches and convents—with their highly realistic images of the Crucifixion and saintly martyrs as backdrops—to manipulate the audience's reception of the total performance. Aiming for admimtio rather than rational consensus, preachers often became skilled actors, transforming their churches into \"ecclesiastical theaters\" with elaborate special effects. Barnes-Karol asserts that the parallel between the pulpit and the stage was frequently drawn for the purpose of instructing preachers, and she follows Maravall in her claim that the impact of live oratory, like that of secular theater, reaffirmed a past social reality. But in discussing the circulation of written sermons in collections called sermonarios (sermons that dealt insistingly with the stability of the written word), Barnes-Karol points to the same problematics of authority and entropy noted by Beverley. Because the written sermons were read aloud to groups, they encouraged attendance at oral sermons; the cycle of print to performance thus created a system that maintained Church conservatism. Despite the efforts of the Church to impose religious homogeneity on the population, the various minority groups resisted change. Although nominally converted, as Bernard Vincent and Jaime Contreras explain, many moriscos and converses held firmly to their preestablished practices. In many cases, persecution helped these groups rediscover the significance of their ethnic practices and actually encouraged new loyalties to the minority groups' origins. Vincent's chapter, \"The Moriscos and Circumcision,\" deals specifically with the ceremony of circumcision in three townships. By tabulating the ages of circumcised and uncircumcised males, he is able to determine the responses of the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxvii\n\nmorisco communities to religious control. As Vincent shows, the practice continued clandestinely: to elude inquisitorial persecution, the moriscos delayed circumcision until after infancy. The community proved admirably adept at dissimulating. When questioned by inquisitors, young males often blamed their deceased parents for their circumcision; others would deny any knowledge of the circumstances. Vincent makes clear how the practice of circumcision assumed significance to both Christians and moriscos. To the Inquisition, the visible sign meant an opportunity to implicate the individual further and thus extract a general confession; to the morisco, it offered an identity linking him to his community. Like the moriscos, converses were often the targets of inquisitorial persecution, inasmuch as the group was viewed as recalcitrant and subversive. In an impressive demonstration of historical detective work, Jaime Contreras goes beyond this perception to bring to light the intricate and hidden relations of power among Old and New Christians. The tensions between families who had previously coexisted peacefully escalated as municipal offices were increasingly relegated to the nobility. The decade of the 1560s witnessed the growing paranoia around the \"purity of blood\" issue, as converse efforts to purchase titles of nobility were blocked both by competing groups of commoners and by nobles. Piecing together clues of tightly interwoven lives of New Christians in the townships of Lorca and Murcia, Contreras uncovers the ways in which inquisitorial authority was often abused to marginalize New Christians from positions of power by accusing them of Judaizing. His case histories vividly illustrate that the climate of fear and hatred fomented by the Counter-Reformation against alleged crypto-Jews was exploited for political purposes as well. Our efforts to address culture and control in Counter-Reformation Spain could hardly be complete if we ignored the repeated attempts to order and constrain women's lives. Unlike the religious minorities we have discussed, women posed different problems of control: crossing both class and ethnic lines, women were perceived in the Counter-Reformation as the most dangerous threat to Christian morality, yet they could not be totally separated from the majority, and indeed they were ever\n\nxviii\n\nANNE J. CRUZ AND MARY ELIZABETH PERRY\n\npresent, whether as wives, daughters, sisters, or mothers. Gender control, then, represents one of the most pervasive and complex of cultural mechanisms. During the Counter-Reformation, the Church and the State reinscribed misogyny by focusing on women's powers to lead men's souls to hell. While other minorities were condemned for their unorthodox beliefs and practices, only women as a group were viewed as inherently dangerous to men. Control of the female body was thus not only an economic strategy, but one of the most important means of ensuring men's salvation. The chapters by Mary Elizabeth Perry, Anne J. Cruz, Alison Weber, and Maria Helena Sanchez Ortega discuss the significance of women's social roles both in the private and the public spheres, be they roles conforming to their accepted sexual and reproductive functions, or ones threatening social order. Either as Old Christians, moriscas, or conversas, women formed a gender subculture separate from other minority groups; rather than differentiated by ethnicity, religion, or class, women were distinguished by social expectations. As such, the primary behavior that had to be inculcated in them was sexual purity—not so much for their own social and moral good, but to protect male privilege. For this purpose, chastity was the most exalted virtue for females, but given their \"natural\" weakness, it was also the most difficult to protect. Mary Elizabeth Perry reasons that while clerics urged parents to guard their daughters \"as dragons,\" the very presence of unchaste women revealed the failure of the attempts to impose moral control over women. Officials feared that unchaste women threatened social order and the salvation of men's souls, yet their fear revealed an ambivalence: unchaste women could be seen either as Magdalens, victims of circumstances such as poverty and seduction, or they could be seen as Jezebels, agents of evil who seduced young boys and infected others with disease and debauchery. Disagreeing about the possibilities of redemption, officials nevertheless agreed that these women should be enclosed in the brothel, the Magdalen house, or the prison. The forms of control over women's sexuality varied according to their own responses and others' needs. Many cities legalized\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxix\n\nprostitution as a means to protect the chastity of some women and the sexual privilege of men. Yet the appearance of the Sevillian syphilis epidemic gave real urgency to a growing debate over prostitution, calling both for stricter regulation of prostitutes and also, paradoxically, for their legal prohibition. Not surprisingly, the nun who proposed to Philip III a severe prison as punishment for recalcitrant women used disease as a metaphor to describe the contagion, both physical and moral, that female impurity could spread throughout his kingdom. For those women whose chastity made them desirable brides, marriage represented yet another form of enclosure, and many were to lament their married state. Anne J. Cruz traces the ballad of La bella malmaridada from its lighthearted origins in French chansons to its increasingly darker Spanish variants, where the wife's unhappiness leads to adultery, then death at the husband's hands. Her chapter relates the attitudes expressed by literary texts—oral, cultured, and dramatic—to the growing strictures placed on Spanish women during the Counter-Reformation. By comparing literary genres, she studies the function of popular poetry and theater as oral and visual means of gender indoctrination. Arguably less constrained during the medieval period, women's roles in the sixteenth century were privatized by the division of labor based on the sexes. When Lope de Vega glosses the poem in his play of the same title, both husband and wife exemplify Church teachings on marital behavior. Considered the most popular of popular songs, La bella malmaridada''s lament is staged by the Golden Age playwright as a lesson for the good wife. The woman's role never deviates from that of a caring mother and long-suffering wife whose love finally compels the husband to abandon his concubine and his gambling—a vice that had recently come under attack by Tridentine reformers. In its paradigm of Christian marriage, the play rewrites normatively the punitive lesson sung by the ballad's adulterous wife. Yet no matter how normative, literary depictions sketch only a partial view of a very complex network of gender behavior. The enclosure of women, either through marriage or in convents, did not guarantee their control, whether real or fictional. The moralists' adjurations for cloistered women were increas-\n\nxx\n\nANNE J.

Perry comments that the urgency with which parents and clerics policed women implies the failure of the system to impose a homogenous moral order that would contribute to political stability. Enclosure, whether in the brothel, the Magdalen house, or the convent, often proved powerless in controlling women's behavior. Religious women, for instance, often enjoyed more intellectual freedom without the domestic constraints imposed by husbands and children. The most striking example of how a religious vocation could offer women control over their own lives is Saint Teresa of Avila, whose writings demonstrate her indefatigable spirit as religious reformer, author, and mystic. Yet Saint Teresa's experiences were judged by her confessors as those of a religious woman, and as such, she was considered susceptible to diabolical illusions. Alison Weber's study of Teresa's works reveals her autobiography to be a dissenting demonological treatise that defines the nature and limits of diabolical power. Teresa's Devil never loses the grotesque appearance he had in medieval iconographic tradition, a characteristic that Weber suggests could be viewed as a strategic attempt to displace the more seductive Counter-Reformation Devil. Clearly preoccupied by the potential apparitions of demons to her nuns, Teresa attributed most demonic visions to physiological conditions brought on by excessive prayer and meditation, and refused to perpetuate the myth that women were the Devil's compliant sexual partners. In this, Weber tells us, as well as in her confidence in women's capacity for genuine mystical experience, Teresa dissented from the traditional view of women as pawns of the Devil. Women's subversive tactics, within the convent or outside its walls, could not completely elude control; Teresa's experiences, for example, came under the careful scrutiny of her confessors. The gaze of her superiors carried with it apparent disciplinary power, what Foucault has called a \"mechanism that coerces by means of observation\" (170). By scrupulously obeying their orders, however, Teresa recast her submissive role into an active attitude of penitence, thereby reversing discipline to suit her own needs, rather than those of the Church.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxxi\n\nNonetheless, in the fervor of renewed ecclesiastical antifeminism, Teresa's skepticism toward demonic possession was uncommon and quite dangerous. The relationship between women and the Devil was increasingly affirmed through inquisitorial cases that intended to prove heretical behavior. Indeed, in daily life, women were as much feared as they were constrained; not only moralists, but society in general fostered strong beliefs regarding women's powers and viewed them as sources of evil. Maria Helena Sanchez Ortega studies Inquisition cases of women accused of sorcery, whose spells, she points out, gained a reputation as diverse and dangerous as the women who employed them. Most women who cast spells on livestock, crops, and their neighbors were not considered professional sorceresses, but many who practiced \"love magic\" took on a professional role and were sought by women abandoned by a lover. Men believed as fervently as women in the spells, and often would accuse the sorceresses to the Inquisition as a means of breaking their bonds. Men's testimonies demonstrate both their fascination with and their fear of these powerful women. Although the Inquisition was generally more tolerant of the women accused than were their neighbors and relatives, when a case involved harm to a child, inquisitors often explained the events as a diabolical pact, effectively converting the women into witches. Older women, women who lived by themselves, and those whose lives were somehow different from others', increased people's suspicions and fears, and the transformation from sorceress to witch offered a way of controlling women by placing them more fully within the jurisdiction of the Inquisition. The conversion of sorceress into witch is most evident in a literary source: Cervantes's description of Canizares in his El coloCjuio de los perros (The Dogs' Colloquy). As a text of the CounterReformation, Cervantes's exemplary novel also exemplifies the cultural significance of Baroque literature. To John R. Beverley, the paradoxical quality of the Baroque may explain both the attempts and failures to control culture during the Counter-Reformation. A Janus that looked behind to the sunset of feudalism and ahead to the dawn of capitalism, this ambivalent phenom-\n\nxxii\n\nANNE J. CRUZ AND MARY ELIZABETH PERRY\n\nenon was the voice of both the absolutist state, with its small literate elite comprising the powerful aristocracy, and the growing commodification of literary production and distribution in nascent capitalism. In the last chapter of this volume, Beverley traces the historical and social implications of Baroque literature as the \"cultural form\" of the Counter-Reformation. Emerging from the Renaissance genres that had been placed on the Index, this literature assigns itself the task of recontaining a subversive potential within Counter-Reformation orthodoxy. For the Jesuit Baltasar Gracian, for example, the art of literary conceits was indeed a prerequisite, not only for the \"man of letters\" but also for the politico, the political man. Yet what Gracian recognizes is the irresolution between a rhetorical notion of power, and power as an innate quality that, as we have seen in Contreras's study of crypto-Jews and local power, was demanded by both the nobility and Counter-Reformation political theory. Beverley therefore considers as overly monolithic Maravall's view of the homology of the Baroque as a cultural phenomenon with the absolutist monarchy as the very essence of aristocratic power. Instead, he sees the representation of the State, along with the authority of the Church, not as a reflection of its actual coherence, but as an imaginary concept, a projection of desire misconstruing the real. To Beverley, the Baroque literary forms that attack the emergent bourgeois and artisanal culture arise precisely from the forms that enhance a man as a \"solitary individual.\" Baroque ambiguity is perhaps most evident in its representation of history as an apotheosis of empire, all the while acknowledging Spain's inexorable decline. Pointing out the contradictory nature of Baroque literature, Beverley's chapter serves as a fitting conclusion to our volume. What he considers Baroque spiritualism's \"paradoxical conjunction of the principle of submission to authority with the practical and theoretical ideal of the self-willed, independent individual\" addresses as well the conflictive and conflicting values expounded by Counter-Reformation Spain. Yet not all groups could assume the individualism ascribed to them, as cultural identities often emerged from and depended upon communities. Rather, we have seen the ways in which many women, con-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxxiii\n\nversos, and moriscos relied upon each other in order to promote and maintain cultural difference. By isolating diverse instances of these social practices, as well as the normative means that intended to control them, the authors of this volume underline the cultural heterogeneity of a Spanish society made up of Old Christians, converses, moriscos, women, and men. In doing so, they highlight both the methods of repression and control utilized to bring these minority groups into conformity with dominant patterns, and the alternative means of survival and subversion with which these groups responded.

Unanimously agreed upon by the bishops of Toledo, from 1480 until the end of the seventeenth century. —Jose Sanchez Herrero\n\nIn 1975, Professor Delumeau, in his inaugural address at the College of France, presented a brilliant synthesis of the history of Christianity. According to him, during the Middle Ages an abyss separated an elite minority, who adhered to a set of established religious practices, from the masses, who believed in magic and ignored the most elemental Christian truths, in spite of the fact that they did indeed consider themselves Christians. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Catholic and Protestant elite became aware of this fact, influenced both by the mendicant orders' attempts to awaken the religious spirit of the public and by the intellectual ferment of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation (Delumeau, \"Dechristianisation\" 3-20). They undertook the tremendous task of \"Christianizing\" the masses, an endeavor that reached its peak at the end of the seventeenth century. Professor Delumeau believes that this effort achieved its objective. His project consists of quantifying the results and studying their geographical, sociological, and temporal aspects—a complex and impassioned undertaking. A scholar studying the twentieth century can at least evaluate external attitudes or anl\n\n2\n\nJEAN PIERRE DEDIEU\n\nalyze deeper levels expressed in public opinion polls (Michelat and Simon). The historian does not have the same resources. The wealth of material available in the Spanish archives, nonetheless, converts the country into a veritable laboratory. Documents of inquisitorial trials offer rich sources of study (Dedieu, \"The Archives\" 158-189). Beginning with the case files of the Holy Office, we will study how a communal religious practice was created: how the Spanish people acquired a basic knowledge of theology, how they learned the fundamental prayers of the Church (the Pater, Ave, Credo, and Salve), how they fulfilled Church commandments (mass, confirmation, confession, and annual communion), and the extent to which they went even beyond that required of them. The documentation provides abundant sociological data allowing for various differential criteria such as age, cultural level, social category, and residence. The first part of this study analyzes the growing concerns of the ecclesiastical hierarchy with religious instruction of the masses and control over their religious practices. We will then examine the inquisitorial documents and compare them with results of the clergy's efforts. The clergy's concerns are evident in their desire that everyone have a solid knowledge of basic Christian dogma and norms of behavior, what we today call the catechism. Let us examine measures taken between the fourteenth and the sixteenth centuries to institutionalize instruction in the Christian faith.1 Before 1473 Up to the late fifteenth century, the synods did not appear very concerned with catechesis. The acts of the 1323 synod contain a \"Christian doctrine\" in Latin, a text containing the Articles of Faith, God's Commandments with a commentary, and a list of the seven sacraments, vices, and virtues. Apparently ordered by the Cardinal of Santa Sabina, the Papal Legate, priests were to read the text to the public in the vernacular (Sanchez Herrero 173-176). The following ten synods and six councils did not mention the doctrine. It appeared once more at the 1356 synod, which included the 1323 measures and added the stipulation that the public readings take place during high mass at Christ-\n\n\"CHRISTIANIZATION\" IN NEW CASTILE\n\n3\n\nmas, Easter, Pentecost, Assumption, and on the first Sunday of Lent (Sanchez Herrero 224-226, 228). The 1379 synod made no reference to the doctrine. From 1473 until Trent The issue was revived at the end of the fifteenth century. The provincial council at Aranda ordered the priests to have a written copy of the Articles of Faith, the Commandments, and the list of sacraments, vices, and virtues in order to read them to parishioners every Sunday during Lent (Sanchez Herrero 285). While this order did not add anything new, Alonso Carrillo, who presided over the Alcala synod in 1480, went much further. He ordered all priests to have, within three months, a parchment letter containing all the items required by the council at Aranda and including works of charity, the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the five corporal senses, and the list of the cases reserved for the Pope and the Bishop. This letter was to be posted in a public place and read to parishioners every Sunday of Lent. Furthermore, the synod publicly expressed for the first time its concerns about the religious instruction of the faithful (Sanchez Herrero 302-305). It requested that priests seek the assistance of a capable clergyman or sacristan in order to open a school and teach the parish children how to read, write, and sing. They were also taught the contents listed in the letter; priests encouraged parishioners to send their children to school. Thus, secular and religious education were to take place together. The Carrillo mandate was followed by all the assemblies until the end of the seventeenth century.2 The synods of reformist bishop Francisco Ximenez de Cisneros confirm these orders. In 1497, he instructed priests to ring the bells, calling to Salve and to sing the prayer solemnly every Sunday, after vespers and before nightfall. They were to teach children to make the sign of the cross,3 and to recite the Pater, the Ave Maria, the Credo, the Salve, the Ten Commandments, and the General Confession; attendance at such sessions was mandatory. To induce the adults to attend, all present would receive forty days' indulgence (Sanchez Herrero 344-345). The 1498 synod published a text of the \"doctrine\" that priests were\n\n4\n\nJEAN PIERRE DEDIEU\n\nobliged to teach, which included the Credo in Latin, divided into twelve paragraphs, each one traditionally attributed to an apostle; the Articles of Faith; the Ten Commandments; the commandments of the Church; the works of charity and the capital sins, all in Castilian; as well as a final reminder of the two commandments to love God above all else and to love one's neighbor as oneself. The 1536 synod led by Cardinal Tavera supported the effort to catechize. It did not publish any doctrine, but merely repeated, with some variations, the dispositions of its predecessors. It added that every Sunday at high mass, after the faithful were absolved of venial sins, the priest had to require them to recite a Pater or a Credo as penance and recite the prayers with them \"in order to accustom the people to say them correctly\" (Synod 1536, fol. 4r). The priest was to sing the Credo a capella, so as to facilitate better understanding of the words (Synod 1536, fol. 22r). Teachers were to instruct their pupils in Christian doctrine every day; couples who could not correctly recite the four basic prayers could not marry. Such a requirement at a key moment in life was significant: the synodal decisions were no longer abstract, but were to be carried out. This was the spirit of Trent avant la lettre (Synod 1536, fol. 3v). Trent The Council of Trent was not really concerned with catechism. It named a commission to compile an instruction manual for priests, but not for the public. It decreed that the bishops had to ensure early religious instruction in each parish, at least on Sundays and holidays (Session XXIV, Reformation Decree, Can. 4). The Spanish bishops showed more concern for catechesis than did the fathers of Trent. Jose Goni Gaztambide has pointed out how obsessively the issue was dealt with during the Navarrese clerical visits beginning in 1540 (Los navarros 153-155). At the same time, many catechisms were being edited throughout Spain, earlier than in other Catholic countries (Guerrero 225-260); the French presses did not begin producing such books in large numbers before 1640, and the first mention of catechism in the synodal statutes of Autun occurred in 1652 (Delumeau, Le\n\n\"CHRISTIANIZATION\" IN NEW CASTILE\n\n5\n\ncatholicisme 288, 290). Spain took the lead within Christendom, while within Spain Toledo led all other dioceses, if we may draw any conclusions from the Navarrese example. In Toledo, the Council of Trent was but the continuation of a previous movement. The provincial council of 1565-1566 published the Tridentine decrees and ordered priests to teach the catechism on Sundays and days of obligation in the church or some other stipulated locale, after high mass, around noon (Council 1566, fols. 49v, 50r). Don Gomez Tello Giron, the diocese administrator during Carranza's captivity, added a canon at the 1566 synod that reiterated the dispositions of the provincial council (Synod 1568, fols. 20v-21r). He forbade communion to those who did not know the four prayers (Synod 1568, fol. 77v), a prohibition that turned catechism into a tool of social control for ensuring the fulfillment of the annual precept. We know that during the eighteenth century in Navarre, a similar measure obligated parishioners to obey the commands of the hierarchy; we will see that the same measures were efficient in Toledo (Goni Gaztambide, \"El cumplimiento pascual\" 361-372). In this area as in others, Cardinal Quiroga suspended his predecessor's measures; Cardinal Rojas y Sandoval reinstated them. Returning to the Cisneros tradition, he published a complete \"Christian doctrine\": the Credo in Latin and a simplified version in Castilian, without dividing it into the apostolic paragraphs; the Articles of Faith in Castilian; the Ten Commandments in Latin and the vernacular; the Church commandments; the list of the sacraments, the works of corporal and spiritual charity, the virtues, the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the beatitudes, the mortal sins, the enemies of the body and the soul, the corporal senses, all in Castilian; the Pater, the Ave, the Salve, and formulas for making the sign of the cross in Latin and in Castilian; and various prayers for specific moments of the mass in Castilian.4 Until the end of the seventeenth century, all synodal records would reiterate this \"doctrine,\" discreetly expanding upon it. After Quiroga it was no longer published as an appendix, but at the beginning of the main text, constituting the most important part of the profession of faith that opened the text (Synod 1583, fol. 2r).5 At the 1601 synod, Cardinal Rojas incorporated learning the Ten Commandments and the commandments of the Church as\n\n6\n\nJEAN PIERRE DEDIEU\n\nprerequisite for marriage (Synod 1601, fol. 74r). He also published a canon that strongly recommended that the episcopal inspectors ensure catechism instruction (Synod 1601, fols. 97r99r), and he changed the preamble to the \"Christian doctrine\" (Synod 1601, fols. 3r-3v). Cardinal Infante's constitutions again modified the same preamble (Synod 1622, fols. Ir-lv), and more important, introduced the obligation of knowing the Ten Commandments and the commandments of the Church in order to receive communion, as well as \"all that is necessary for receiving the sacraments\" (Synod 1622, fol. 85r). Later modifications were not quite so important. In summary, the active interest shown by the Toledan hierarchy in catechism instruction began around 1480, according to synodal records. Archbishop Carrillo laid the groundwork, and each synod expanded upon it. In 1540 a stronger requirement than any called for by the Council of Trent was already in existence: during at least one moment in their lives—at the time of marriage—Christians must prove that they had learned the four prayers of the Church, a requirement constituting the clergy's maximum obligation in the mid-sixteenth century. Trent thus accelerated the movement, but did not create it. New details appeared: the Church commandments had to be fulfilled, and Christians were to be examined not only once during their entire lives, but rather every year. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the minimum requisite became knowledge of the Ten Commandments and those of the Church. We should note as well that the catechizing effort was not merely nor even principally directed at the young. In the schools, of course, instruction of the children was the main objective. However, the examinations, the most effective measures, affected the adults more. Christians were obliged to remember Church doctrine actively during their entire lifetimes, a fact that demonstrated its importance to the clergy. What was the meaning of this immense effort? Why were the faithful obliged to memorize so many formulas? For the effort did indeed involve memorization and nothing more. There was no commentary, no hierarchization of the beliefs or the Commandments, no internal organization or governing principle in the doctrine, except for one formal category, singularly reveal-\n\n\"CHRISTIANIZATION\" IN NEW CASTILE\n\n7\n\ning, regarding \"what one must believe,\" \"what one must do,\" and \"what one must ask.\" Many did not understand what they were learning. The majority of the prisoners who appeared before the inquisitors for having believed that fornication was not a sin knew the Sixth Commandment and the meaning of the word \"fornication\"; they simply believed that prostitution was a special case, falling outside the divine prohibition. And despite the fact that Gabriel de Salazar knew that the Trinity was one God and three divinities, as he was taught according to the Articles of Faith, he also firmly believed that Christ was the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (AHN, Inq. Leg. 205, Expd. 24). Was the Church laboring in vain? Catechism must be understood within the context of the entire clerical project at that time. Memorization was only a principle; the preachers and confessors were responsible for commenting upon the \"doctrine\" and rendering it explicit.6 Sermons developed, ordered, and gave meaning and feeling to bare doctrinal compendia. In reality, catechistical elements structured both sermons and confessions. The following instructions were given by all archbishops to priests beginning with the time of Cardinal Quiroga: We order that when the priests are preaching the gospel throughout the year, they be careful to include instruction of the articles of faith as well as the mandates and precepts of the Church, and . . . how to love God the Father, how to perform works of charity, how to avoid giving offense or committing moral sins; admonish the people to behave as good Christians, desirous of their salvation. (Synod 1536, fol. 4r; Synod 1622, fols. 7v-85r) In other words, instruction had to be organized around the content of the \"doctrines.\" If we examine any \"Art of Confession,\" we are presented with all the permissible forms of confession, an enumeration of the sins according to the Ten Commandments, the potentiality of the soul according to the Articles of Faith, the articles of the Credo, the corporal senses, and the demands of the Pater (Arte\n\n8\n\nJEAN PIERRE DEDIEU\n\npara bien confesar). Knowledge of the corresponding formulas, even in the form of rote memorization without any active comprehension, was indispensable for the clergy to be able to act. Inquisitors proceeded in the following manner when dealing with recalcitrant prisoners: they were ordered to say the Credo and the Ten Commandments or the Articles of Faith. When the pertinent point arose (the Sixth Commandment in the case of fornication), they were stopped and interrogated until they realized that they had explicitly or implicitly disobeyed one of the Ten Commandments or an Article of Faith by committing the sin. The effect was powerful: the prisoners experienced a profound emotional crisis (Bennassar 260-261). In order for this to occur, they had to have a knowledge of the Articles or the Commandments, and they must have assimilated the idea that without them, there could be no salvation. Without this, there could be no shock and consequent penitence. Memorizing formulas thus functioned as the bridge between the general will of the Old Christians to be good Catholics and, what was more difficult, the observance of the ecclesiastical institution's particular interpretations. This constituted a sign of identity, of being one of the faithful. It was, ultimately, a pedagogical technique appropriate for massive education of an illiterate society. We will limit ourselves to a summary study of confession and communion. We must remember that these two sacraments were closely associated; before and after the Council of Trent, the hierarchy insisted that one could not receive communion without having confessed beforehand (Sanchez Herrero 165; Council of Trent, Session XIII, Can. 11). We must also remember that the essential dispositions dated from the Lateran Council IV (1215) and had not been modified since then; Christians had to confess at least once a year with the parish priest (not with another priest) and receive communion during Easter (Lateran Council IV, Can. 21). There was some resistance: the synods of 1323 and 1356, as well as the provincial council of 1339, were constrained to enforce this disposition (Sanchez Herrero 174-175, 203-204, 225). After more than a century of silence, the issue was raised once more at the Carrillo synod in 1480. The synod did not allude to the precept, as it had undoubtedly become part of local\n\n\"CHRISTIANIZATION\" IN NEW CASTILE\n\n9\n\ncustom earlier, but it did order that priests in towns with more than one hundred inhabitants be assisted by another priest at Easter and during epidemics, so that everyone could confess. Later synods repeated this constitution with minor variations. This marked the beginning of modern legislation on this issue (Sanchez Herrero 313). Cardinal Tavera made a vital decision to institute an effective system of control. All the faithful of sound mind were to confess during Lent and receive communion between Palm Sunday and Quasimodo Sunday; in case they did not do so within a grace period of one week, they would be excommunicated ipso facto. The priests were responsible for drawing up a list of all parishioners and classifying them according to the head of each family; the names of the recalcitrants were to be sent to the archbishop's prosecutor. Since this occurred in 1536, it was a display of Tridentine spirit avant la lettre (Synod 1536, fol. 37v)7 The Council of Trent placed great importance on the Eucharist. Unlike the Protestants, the Council viewed this sacrament as defining Church doctrine and exalted its significance by various means. It insisted upon the annual communion as required by Church commandment and encouraged \"frequent communion\" (Session XIII, Cans. 9, 11). In Toledo, this decision gave rise to a series of decisions that made Tavera's mandates more effective. Don Gomez Tello Giron insisted that priests denounce publicly and by name all transgressors (Synod 1568, fol. 77v). He also ordered the construction of \"the richest tabernacles that can be constructed,\" plated in gold or silver (Synod 1568, fol. 63r). He decreed that those who confessed to some priest other than their parish priest must present to the latter a proof of confession (Synod 1568, fol. 12r).8 In order that Christians could receive communion at times other than Easter, Cardinal Quiroga encouraged couples to take the sacrament at their wedding (Synod 1583, fol. 22v). He prohibited confession in private homes and ordered the use of the confessionaries (Synod 1583, fol. 12r). Extending previous measures against priests without benefice, he also prohibited confession without the permission of the parish priest (Synod 1583, fol. llr). Confessors could not receive any remuneration or gifts from penitents (Synod 1583, fol. llv).\n\n10\n\nJEAN PIERRE DEDIEU\n\nAttending mass on Sundays and days of obligation was an ancient precept, so ensconced in religious practice that medieval synods hardly mentioned it. Cardinal Tavera's intense clerical concern led him, nonetheless, to take some additional measures. He emphasized that individuals were obligated to attend mass in their own parishes and encouraged priests to denounce recalcitrants (Synod 1536, fols. 13v, 7v). The theology and celebration of the Holy Sacrifice were the focus of multiple decrees at the Council of Trent, and mass was one of the key points of Catholic reform. Thus, the Toledan synods made the ceremony more solemn and majestic. From the vantage of the clergy, the most important aspect was the attempt to elevate the parochial mass above private votive masses and convent masses. During high mass, Don Gomez Tello Giron wanted all stores closed, including all businesses of an essential nature (Synod 1568, fol. 33v). He recommended that family heads order their children and servants to attend (Synod 1568, fol. 34v). Those who gambled during the ceremony were to be fined. His successors did not introduce substantive changes to his mandate. The Church had required confirmation for a very long time (Vacant and Mangenot, col. 1076). However, although the 1323 synod mentioned the topic, concrete measures were not taken until 1480. In that year one synod lamented the lack of public enthusiasm for the sacrament and ordered the priests to advertise it on the first Sunday of each month (Sanchez Herrero 318319). There were no momentous decisions until the Council of Trent. The Tridentine fathers limited themselves to theological considerations and to the condemnation of Protestant doctrine (Session VII). However, the sacrament was revalorized through their interest: in Toledo, Cardinal Quiroga insisted on the necessity of making it a common practice (Synod 1583, fol. 8v). As we shall see, he need not have worried. In concluding the first part of this study, we note the general precocity of the Toledo prelates' reformist tendencies.9 The early desire to \"Christianize\" the masses is unmistakable. We may now begin to examine the results. Our investigation focuses on the inquisitors' first interrogation of prisoners. Fernando de Valdes describes the encounter in his 1561 Instructions:\n\n\"CHRISTIANIZATION\" IN NEW CASTILE\n\n11\n\nAfter the interrogation concerning identity, the prisoner must declare his genealogy, as far back as possible. . . . Then he must be asked where he grew up, with whom, if he has ever studied in a school, whether he has ever left the country, and if so, with whom. . . . And he must be questioned about prayers and Christian doctrine, where and when he confessed, and with which confessors. (Jimenez Monteserin 205-206) During the second half of the sixteenth century, Pablo Garcia's Order to Prosecute in the Holy Office confirmed that this was a triple inquiry. It first asked about genealogy, then about Christian doctrine, specifically whether or not prisoners had been baptized and confirmed; if they attended mass, confessed, and received communion as ordered by the Church, specifying the time and place where they last did so, and with whom; if they knew how to make the sign of the cross; if they knew the Pater, the Credo, the Ave Maria, and the Salve, and in what language (Latin or vernacular); if they knew the \"Christian doctrine\"; if they could read and write, if they had studied, if they had ever left the country and with whom. Last, the prisoners had to tell their life stories: where they were born, where they grew up, and in chronological order, all the places they had lived, and what they did in each place (AHN, Inq. Leg. 199-211, 69-75, 31-48). Focusing specifically on those questions concerning Christian doctrine, we have thoroughly investigated the cases preserved in the Toledo inquisitional archive that deal with the following offenses: \"scandalous words,\" \"dishonesty,\" and \"blasphemy.\" We have consulted a total of 1,286 case files from the years 1525 to 1650 (see Table 1). The vast majority of the prisoners are Old Christians. The inquisitors performed the interrogation regarding Christian doctrine in only 747 cases. Luckily, Valdes's instructions covered an already familiar practice. The reader will note that inquisitorial concern about the level of religious instruction increased the Toledo clergy's concern with catechism. For this reason, it makes sense to study the history of the Inquisition within the framework of the general history of the Church (Bennassar 16-42). This parallel is even more noteworthy if we examine the kinds of questions\n\n12\n\n12\n\nJEAN PIERRE DE Table 1.\n\nYear Before 1540 1540-1550 1551-1555 1556-1560 1561-1565 1566-1570 1571-1650\n\nNumber of cases with doctrine interrogation\n\nPercentage among cases consulted\n\n8 69 134 82 64 79 280\n\n3 27 60 79 84 95 97\n\nasked. The oldest part of the questionnaire deals with the four Church prayers and the form of making the sign of the cross, and was present in 80 percent of the interrogations taking place before 1560 and in over 99 percent after 1574. These questions represented, coincidentally, the minimum religious instruction required by the Church from 1540 on. Prior to 1565, prisoners were rarely asked about the other formulas comprising \"Christian doctrine\" (Articles of Faith, general confession, the Commandments). After that date, the Ten Commandments alone acquired much more importance and were present in approximately 70 percent of the interrogations after 1574, foreshadowing their inclusion in the clergy's list of required knowledge at the beginning of the seventeenth century. After 1550, in 75 percent of the cases it was asked whether the prisoner had confessed and received communion during the previous Lent. This question became standard after 1570 (in more than 95 percent of the cases) and appeared in all interrogations after 1574. At this time, the interest in identifying the officiating priest became evident. Finally, between the years 1565 and 1574 the inquisitors began to ask whether the prisoners could read and write. After 1575, this question became standard. In summary, the fundamental data were available after 1540, but not all issues mentioned by Pablo Garcia can be studied before 1575. The inquisitors evaluated the answers as good, fair, or bad; prisoners passed the test (for example, they recited the Pater correctly), passed it with a few errors (they made mistakes in a few words of the Pater), or they failed totally (they had no knowl-\n\n\"CHRISTIANIZATION\" IN NEW CASTILE\n\n13\n\nedge of the Pater). The prisoners' personal data concerning identity and \"genealogy\" were available from the interrogation: sex, age, occupation, place of birth, residence, \"race,\" etc. The \"story of a prisoner's life\" allowed the geographical assessment of individuals on a nine-point scale. The documents are extremely informative, yet also present serious problems. We must confront what we believe to be a false objection that the Inquisition trials concerned aberrant cases and the conclusions based on them cannot be applied to the population as a whole. In a previous article, I have concluded that this is not true. Yet the 747 prisoners whose case files we have examined do not constitute what a statistician would call a representative sample. First, women are almost completely absent from the sample, comprising less than 10 percent of the total; this small percentage prohibits any kind of differential study on the basis of sex.10 Furthermore, we know very little of the geo-socioprofessional distribution of the population of New Castile. While manual laborers are poorly represented in the group, comprising one-third of the interrogated prisoners, city dwellers, especially those residing in the largest cities, are overrepresented. As a means of overcoming these defects, we need to study only the overall results for each subgroup. Even more serious are the deviations resulting from the lack of homogeneity of the target population. We have noted the following, beginning with the most serious, a geographical deviation. Until approximately 1560, the target population represented the entire district. Later on, inquisitorial activities were concentrated in La Sagra, central La Mancha, and the region around Madrid and Alcala, that is, the central and southern areas of the district. Second, there is a residential deviation (rural districts, city).11 Third, we point out a deviation concerning migration patterns; while at first the migrants represent less than 20 percent of the cases, they comprise more than 50 percent at the end. Finally, we can detect other deviations that may have serious consequences for our investigation. We note that all the curves drop between 1585 and 1595, to rise again later. This is apparently because of the laborer subgroup's completely losing all knowledge of the catechism. Yet it is hard to believe that in only a few years the laborers had forgotten all the Church's\n\n14\n\nJEAN PIERRE DEDIEU\n\nprayers. In fact, at that time the Inquisition had changed its tactics to concentrate its efforts in the cities, not bothering with rural districts except in the most serious cases of poorly socialized individuals or in cases of subtle segregation not included in the total numbers. The drop thus appears to be deceptive. With what criteria did the inquisitors evaluate the responses? Were the criteria stable or did they change over time? From 1540 until 1650, at least sixty judges presided over the Toledo tribunal. According to the documents kept by the inquisitor Diego Ramirez de Sedeno during his visit to the district in 1556, in the Henares region of Alcala 85 percent of those questioned knew the four fundamental prayers perfectly. An examination of his colleagues' observations from the periods 1551-1555 and 1561-1565 reveals that the statistics are 41 and 53 percent, respectively. The percentage of responses classified as frankly \"bad\" does not vary substantially, however. We may conclude that Ramirez benevolently tabulated as \"good\" the stammerings his colleagues must have considered \"fair,\" or that perhaps he limited himself to asking the prisoners if they knew the prayers without verifying their assertions.12 Barring this, deviations in the system of notation could only indicate greater strictness; the changes traced in the first part of this study imply that this is indeed the case. This fact does not detract from our conclusions; rather, it strengthens them. At any rate, Christianization is seen as gaining momentum. The global perspective from the documents is conclusive and confirms a striking homogeneity in each of the distinct subcategories that reflects on the conclusions of the whole. The small number of cases obliged us to divide the material in seven blocks of unequal duration, thus compromising between constituting useful statistical unities and maintaining a precise chronological dimension. The divisions are shown in Table 2.13 We have noted a universal indicator: individuals passed the test if they recited the four prayers correctly, and they failed if they were ignorant of one or more. Those who were familiar with all four without being able to recite them correctly were classified under the category of \"fair.\"\n\n'CHRISTIANIZATION\" IN NEW CASTILE\n\n15\n\nTable 2.

The success rate is doubled between 1555 and 1575. This curve should be modified according to previous observations, however. The results would not change significantly: before 1550, 40 percent of males from New Castile passed the test on basic Christian doctrine, leaving the other half below the proficiency level required by the Church. Twenty years later, three out of four answered correctly and only one in ten failed completely. The beginning of the seventeenth century thus saw a total success rate for the\n\n16\n\nJEAN PIERRE DEDIEU\n\ntested population. If we remember that Inquisition prisoners were not among those who had best learned Church doctrine, it is probable that the above success rate is even higher for the population as a whole. It is interesting that the progress between 1560 and 1570 was apparently due to efforts aimed more at adults than children. The individual's age had no influence on the response and corresponded to the above strategies utilized by clergy. Table 4. Success rate of four prayers by occupation Year Before 1540 1540-1550 1551-1555 1556-1560 1561-1565 1566-1570 1571-1650\n\nAgriculture\n\nHandicraft\n\n17 21 50 65 78 50 74\n\n42 48 71 69 82 77 91\n\nThe small number of cases obliges us to limit the occupational analysis to the two best represented groups: laborers and artisans. We note that both curves are similar; that they follow the general curve; and that artisans consistently achieved better results than laborers. This is to be expected for reasons impossible to elaborate on at the present time, but was perhaps due to greater literacy among artisans (Rodriguez and Bennassar). (See Table 4.) We note also the wide initial disparity followed by an increasing approximation; the progress of \"Christianization\" is the result not of the consolidation of former positions, but rather of the conquest of virgin territory. We must keep in mind that the drop in the number of laborers between 1585 and 1599 merely reflects a modification in the selection criteria of target individuals. In studying the places of residence, we conclude that knowledge of the prayers varied in inverse proportion to the size of the township. The difference was minor, however, and the greater statistical importance of the cities at the end of the period undoubtedly distorts the results. Geographical mobility should be considered to be an explanatory factor. It is evident that (1) ig-\n\n\"CHRISTIANIZATION\" IN NEW CASTILE\n\n17\n\nnorance of the prayers was systematically greater among recently established populations; (2) the catechistical effort was successful in two phases—until 1565 among stable populations, and essentially between 1575 and 1585 among the migrant populations; (3) the Church was successful in completely eliminating ignorance of the basic formulas of the faith among settled populations, as well as substantially reducing ignorance among mobile populations. It is important to point out the close relationship between literacy and the level of Christian culture. Between 1575 and 1650, 86 percent of literates successfully passed the test, as opposed to 73 percent of illiterates; 13 percent of the latter failed completely, as opposed to the former's 3 percent. Most likely the period's overwhelmingly positive results reduced the impact of illiteracy, and we encounter this problem again in more difficult tests, such as knowledge of the Commandments. The relation of instruction to literacy can be easily explained by methods used to teach reading; the \"letters\" containing the prayers were also used as textbooks in the elementary schools. The level of familiarity with all four prayers was very different among the four, with the Ave and the Pater being the most familiar. By the mid-sixteenth century, there were few who could not at least stammer their way through the Credo in its simplified version. Yet, there were also few who could recite it correctly. In the seventeenth century, the percentage of those barely familiar with it is not above 10 percent. The results are the same with the Salve; in the seventeenth century only foreigners were unfamiliar with it.14 In the mid-sixteenth century, however, the percentage of absolute failures was high, as was the percentage of those who knew the prayer well; few people had only partial knowledge of it. Some foreigners did not know how to cross themselves; this number diminished progressively, proving that the clergy reached even the most isolated groups. Ignorance of the sign of the cross soon became an aberration. One-fourth of the cases specify the language in which the prisoner was to recite the prayers. The data, scarce before 1555, became more systematic after 1580, indicating greater accuracy on the part of the judges. Until 1585, they preferred the Latin version (appearing in half of the cases); afterward, the Castilian\n\n18\n\nJEAN PIERRE DEDIEU\n\nversion was given preference.15 Did this evolution correspond to a global change within the Church? If so, it would denote a trend toward interiorization and thus less insistence on the rote repetition of incomprehensible formulas. In any case, we can generally conclude that until 1600, the male population of New Castile, after half a century's efforts by the clergy, possessed the minimum theological knowledge considered indispensable for salvation, and the seventeenth century was to see even more improvement. The Ten Commandments and the commandments of the Church became required knowledge at the beginning of the seventeenth century. Since 1570, the Inquisition had asked whether prisoners were familiar with the former. The success rate for this test remained approximately 40 percent for a long time, rising dramatically to 70 percent during the last fifteen years of the sixteenth century and slowly increasing. By 1595, the number of complete failures had fallen to 10 percent, regardless of age or place of residence. Unfortunately, the inquisitorial documentation does not allow us to engage in a parallel study of other issues of \"Christian doctrine.\" Questions on the Articles of Faith do not offer a basis for statistics; however, their importance appears equal to that of the Ten Commandments. During the second half of the sixteenth century, an increasing number of primarily urban prisoners could correctly recite \"the entire Christian doctrine.\" In some cases, the inquisitors declared themselves satisfied or even impressed. The study of the commandments of the Church regarding communion and confession presents no special difficulties. The percentage of recalcitrants, most notably before 1550, diminished rapidly; we cannot find a single case between 1575 and 1584. Except for extraordinary cases such as the refusal to forgive wrongs committed against another person—which barred one from absolution—and detainment in civil jails, by the end of the sixteenth century Old Christians fulfilled the obligations of confession and communion.16 It is noteworthy that if in the sixteenth century, detainment in civil jails was one of the most frequently alleged reasons for failing to fulfill the religious obligations, in the seventeenth century, prisoners in such jails (eleven cases in all) had all received\n\n\"CHRISTIANIZATION\" IN NEW CASTILE\n\n19\n\ncommunion on the last important holiday, thus surpassing Church requirements. This situation resulted from the intensive work carried out by the religious orders, especially the Jesuits, and confirms the fervor of the Counter-Reformation clergy. In the sixteenth century, abstention from communion was due to several factors noted by statistics: to residence in large towns, a low level of Christian culture, unemployment and agriculture, and geographical mobility. Indeed, it may have been the result both of insufficient integration into the surrounding community, specifically with regard to the Church, and of the pressures of daily life that often eclipsed the Christian tenet of forgiving wrongs. Since Valdes required that prisoners be questioned concerning their latest confession, it is possible to study and correlate the frequency of confession and communion. However, as the interrogations took place throughout the year with many occurring immediately after Holy Week, the phenomenon was undervalued. If people declared in April that they had received communion during Holy Week, this did not mean that they would not do so again for a year. Keeping in mind the dangers of reducing statistical data, the only solution is to isolate the interrogations that took place in January, February, and March, as shown in Table 5. Table 5. Surpassing requirement Cases studied\n\n1540-1554\n\n1555-1574\n\n1575-1599\n\n1600-1650\n\n0% 13\n\n10.5% 57\n\n15.1% 33\n\n50% 18\n\nWe can adjust the results presented in Table 5 by comparing them with the interrogations carried out between October and December, as shown in Table 6. Table 6.

If we take all the dates into consideration, however, the granting of plenary indulgence (jubileos) was the most frequent reason for receiving communion, outside of Easter time. The small number of the target group does not permit a differential analysis of frequent communicants. It seems that communion other than during Easter was systematically accompanied by confession to a confessor other than a priest. During the sixteenth century, chaplains and friars shared this responsibility; in the seventeenth century, the regular clergy appear to have had a true monopoly, perhaps due to their encouragement of the practice.17 While Spain evolved similarly to the rest of Catholic Europe as regards communion, confirmation was a different matter (Delumeau, Le catholicisme 282-284). In France, confirmation was implemented late and with difficulty; in the seventeenth century, a large part of the population was still not confirmed. In contrast, New Castile implemented this sacrament enthusiastically, and inquisitorial documents allow us to go back to approximately 1510. Almost all the prisoners acknowledged being confirmed at the age of fourteen; some of them declared a younger age. Almost all of them remembered the occasion, manifesting the importance this sacrament had for them. The ones who were not confirmed were three Frenchmen, one Italian, one Asturian, one Galician (these last two were still adolescents), one Moslem, and one Castilian, a very poor orphaned baker's apprentice. The concern of the clergy was quite intense. One Portuguese man said he had been confirmed twice, once in his hometown, and once at the beginning of the seventeenth century in Cuellar by a priest who would not listen to his protests. Other indications reveal that the population was strongly attached to this sacrament.18 When studying attendance at mass, we must once again trust the prisoners' declarations, with an added difficulty: it is easier to lie about attending mass than it is about confirmation or meeting one's paschal obligation. Between 1560 and 1650, the total percentage of those who swore that they missed mass occasion-\n\n\"CHRISTIANIZATION\" IN NEW CASTILE\n\n21\n\nally (no one confessed to never going) is less than 3 percent. In fact, absenteeism was stronger in some groups. Of the twentyone cases that we know of, eight are artisans, five are shepherds, three muleteers, three servants, and only two laborers (one of whom lived in an isolated farmhouse). Three types of individuals did not attend mass: those who lived in isolated areas without a priest, travelers, and mountain people — muleteers, shepherds, transporters, merchants, coal burners, and servants. For these individuals, Sunday was a workday like any other, and if some artisans chose not to miss the opportunity to make money, others stated directly that they would not give up a card game or a day in the country with friends.19 Local traditions limiting attendance to public services should also be taken into account; in La Mancha, for example, in the town of Daimiel, unmarried women did not attend mass except during Lent (AHN, Inq. Leg. 230, Expd. 5, fol. 60r). Thus was the process of Christianization in New Castile. Does this mean that Charles V's subjects were not Christians? Obviously not, and the question would have surprised or even scandalized them: to be a Christian, to see oneself as one, was the center of their sense of identity (Bennassar 285). What we have observed, in fact, is a growing control exercised by the Christian elite over the masses who were no less Christian than they. Simply stated, a more intellectual conception of Christianity was imposed over another. Can we speak accurately of \"Christianization\"? Certainly we can, if being a Christian meant manifesting by means of external signs one's belonging to a group, or if being a Christian meant practicing Christianity. Without a doubt the Spanish Church penetrated the center of the country as far as the conditions of the times permitted—at any rate, much farther than her French counterpart. No doubt her success was due to the Council of Trent, and the movement continued to grow after 1650. In later trials, the majority of Old Christian prisoners showed off their Christian culture, receiving communion several times during the year. In 1778, one of the prisoners declared that he wanted to confess in El Casar de Talamanca, a small town in the province of Guadalajara, but that he had been unable to do so because of the large number of penitents and the small number of\n\n22\n\nJEAN PIERRE DEDIEU\n\nconfessors (AHN, Inq. Leg. 203, Expd. 5). Another prisoner responded to the inquisitor's questions \"with certain depth\" (AHN, Inq. Leg. 26, Expd. 11 [1718]), despite the fact that he was a journeyman from La Mancha who barely knew how to read. What was obtained was much more than simple memorization; that aspect reflects the pedagogical phase. It is very possible that the deep structures of popular religiosity were modified by the new knowledge and practices. This is still a hypothesis to be either upheld or disproved by future studies. At any rate, the Church's actions appear increasingly as one of the determining factors in the evolution of religious mentalities. It would be of no use to study the latter without keeping this fact in mind (Russo clxxii-clxxxii). Notes An earlier version of this article was published as \"Christianisation en Nouvelle Castille. Catequisme, communion, messe et confirmation dans 1'archeveche de Tolede, 1540-1650,\" in Melanges de la Casa de Velazquez 15 (1979): 261-294. Professor Sara Nalle arrives at similar conclusions in her unpublished dissertation, \"Religion and Reform in a Spanish Diocese. Cuenca, 1545-1650,\" Johns Hopkins University, 1983, based on the Cuenca Inquisition trials. 1. The synods and Toledan provincial councils of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries have been published by Jose Sanchez Herrero. We will note others by the word \"synod\" or \"council\" followed by the year of publication and the page of the edition we have consulted. All documents are housed in the National Library, Madrid. 2. This synod, a forerunner of Trent, was also responsible for making essential decisions concerning marriage. 3. Signarse means the same as persignarse: to make the sign of the cross on the forehead, the mouth, and the chest, saying, \"By the sign of the Holy Cross, from our enemies deliver us, our Lord God.\" Then the sign of the cross is made again, moving the fingers from the forehead to the umbilicus and from the left shoulder to the right, saying, \"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.\" 4. Cardinal Rojas added the Latin translation of these formulas to his \"doctrine.\" 5. The priests were also to remind stepfathers that they are required to teach the doctrine to their stepchildren (Synod 1583, fol. 8r). 6. The catechistical value of preaching is evident. Usually, the value of confession is not stressed to the same extent. Between one-third and one-half of the prisoners appearing before the inquisitors discovered through the confessor that fornication was a sin, and when one prisoner alleged his ignorance, the judges invariably responded by saying that his confessor must have told him.\n\n\"CHRISTIANIZATION\" IN NEW CASTILE\n\n23\n\n7. Cardinal Rojas includes a matriculation form in his synod (Synod 1601, fols. 83v-84r). 8. The case was frequent in Spain: the Cruzada Bull allowed the individual to choose freely his own confessor. 9. I agree with Casimiro Sanchez Aliseda's conclusions. We must remember, however, that there was a distance between the Church's will and its practice. 10. This fact diminishes the value of our study. The Inquisition archives, like all the judicial systems of the Hapsburg Regime, provide more data on men than they do on women, save the cases of New Christians. 11. We classify the populations in three categories, according to the number of inhabitants during the second half of the sixteenth century, the complexity of the socioprofessional structure, and the strength of the clergy's presence. We refer to Madrid, Toledo, Alcala de Henares, Guadalajara, Talavera de la Reina, Ocana, and Ciudad Real as \"cities\"; the \"large towns\" are Brihuega, Almagro, Mondejar, etc. 12. Diego Ramirez de Sedeno (or de Haro, or de Fuenleal) was Inquisitor of Toledo from the end of 1555 until the end of 1562. When he died in 1573, he was the Bishop of Pamplona. His lack of seriousness led to a complaint by the prosecutor, directed to the Suprema in 1556 (AHN, Inq. Leg. 3067, Expd. 100). His character and his methods are studied by Sara Nalle, \"Old Christians and the Inquisition: Blasphemy Trials in the Sixteenth-Century Tribunal of Toledo,\" unpublished paper presented at the Early Modern Seminar, Johns Hopkins University, 1977. 13. The period between 1555 and 1564 also has the advantage of including all the cases in which Ramirez intervened. 14. The Spanish Church was the only one requiring knowledge of the Salve. 15. This is the case if we exclude foreigners who do not speak Spanish and say the prayers in Latin. We have not included them in our statistics. 16. It was already evident, from the examples of the other regions, that Catholic reform had achieved unanimity in Spain. 17. Penitents who declare that they have confessed to Jesuits also declare that they have received communion outside of Easter time. 18. Communicated to me by Professor Christian Hermann. 19. The Spanish bishops came to the same conclusions; see Ayala.\n\nWorks Cited Actiones Concilii provincialis toletanis. Alcala, 1566. Archivo Historico Nacional (AHN). Various documents.

Nalle\n\nWhile much of the focus of the Counter-Reformation was on the suppression of heterodoxy, enormous effort was also directed toward creating new cults that would carry forward the emerging Tridentine ethic. Particularly favored were cults that explicitly defended points of doctrine legitimating the religious regime that the Protestants hoped to overthrow. The Protestants cast doubt on the validity of the sacraments of penance and the Eucharist as the center of Christian faith. In addition, they denied the authority of priests, held images to be idolatrous, and attacked the cult of the saints as superstition. Each of these attacks on Catholic belief was countered not only in the famous decrees of the Council of Trent but also through the promotion of Tridentine cults for the people. Late-sixteenth-century Spain witnessed the creation of countless new holy days, pieces of artwork, and religious brotherhoods dedicated to celebrating cults of the Eucharist, souls in purgatory, the Holy Family, and the saints in heaven.1 Spanish Church officials especially wanted to promote new cults of the saints. In 1566 rioting Calvinists in the Netherlands smashed images of the saints and destroyed their relics. Philip II 25\n\n26\n\nSARA T. NALLE\n\nordered the rescue of Flemish relics (most notably San Eugemo and Santa Leocadia) which were brought back to Castile and installed in El Escorial and the Cathedral of Toledo.2 But the times demanded more than the rescue of saints endangered on foreign soil; militant, native exemplars of sanctity had to be put before the people to lead them in faith and succor them in times of hardship. In addition to new saints such as Diego de Alcala, Ignatius Loyola, or Teresa de Avila, during the Counter-Reformation numerous older Spanish miracle workers were called up from reserve and put on active duty in the defense of their cities. Avila invented the cult of San Segundo while nearby Segovia rediscovered San Frutos. Leon turned to San Froylan, Madrid found San Isidro Labrador, Toledo celebrated Santa Leocadia, and Cuenca resurrected San Julian, the city's second bishop.3 Efforts to canonize the bishop of Cuenca and propagate his cult actually were begun in 1518, long before the Council of Trent, and continued throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Because of the unusual amount of publicity generated by the lengthy fight to canonize the saint and win privileges for his cult, Julian's case effectively illustrates some of the aspects of cultural control at work during the Counter-Reformation. For nearly two centuries the saint was prominent in the public's eye, and as the religious and social environment changed, new generations found different meanings in the saint's life and works. The history of the cult reveals in striking detail how Church and city authorities came to see in the obscure medieval bishop a saint for their own times, a saint whose cult, if successfully promoted, would help to restore faith in the Church's threatened credibility.4 Unlike many of the saints whose cults were revived during the sixteenth century, there is little disagreement in the sources over the known details of Julian's life or the provenance of his relics. Julian was born circa 1128 in the city of Burgos. Oddly, despite the fact that he eventually became archdeacon of Toledo and bishop of Cuenca, his last name is not known. He left Burgos to study philosophy and theology in Palencia and also taught there for a number of years. When his parents died, Julian, now middle-aged, returned to Burgos where he retired to a small house next to the Monastery of San Agustm.5 There he\n\nTHE CULT OF SAN JULIAN\n\n27\n\ndedicated himself to prayer, giving lessons, and preaching to the Christians and Moors of the city. Preaching became his passion: he took holy orders and, accompanied by one companion, San Lesmes, he left the city to go on several evangelical missions among the Islamic and Jewish populations of Castile. In 1192 he became archdeacon of the Cathedral of Toledo and in 1196, at age 68, bishop of Cuenca, which had been reconquered only nineteen years before, in 1177. Shortly after his arrival in the diocese, Cuenca was attacked by a plague. Julian is credited with saving the diocese from the pestilence through his prayers. He died in the odor of sanctity on January 28, 1208, and was buried in a tomb close by the western entrance to the cathedral. According to one tradition, he was canonized by the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215; another tradition holds that he was canonized at the Council of Constance in 1414. Be that as it may, no record of any medieval canonization survives. In the late sixteenth century Clement VIII reconfirmed his sainthood and cult. Despite his legendary beatification Julian's cult enjoyed little popularity in Cuenca during the Middle Ages. Even his own cathedral was slow to accord him honor. The earliest record of a mass in San Julian's memory is found in 1371, some 160 years after the saint's presumed canonization (Sanchiz Catalan 7). As late as 1531, his feast day was not part of the diocese's calendar of holy days (Ramirez, fol. llv). Outside the realm of liturgical observance, there are other signs that the medieval cult was weak. For example, popular tradition in the seventeenth century held that San Julian had instituted the city's charity box, which dowered orphan girls. The records show, however, that the box was founded in 1478 by the cathedral chapter, which made no mention of the saint as the one establishing the charity (ACC, Estatutos, fol. 181v).6 In the city hall's records there is no indication that Cuenca paid any public homage to the saint before 1550. Finally, if name-giving is taken as something of a barometer of the popularity of saints (Christian, Person and God 8893; Wilson 46) Julian had no credit at all with the people of fifteenth-century Cuenca. In the city censuses of 1442 and 1502, which list a total of 1,350 citizens, the name \"Julian/a\" appears just once (AMC, Leg. 1503: 2, 9).\n\n28\n\nSARA T.
