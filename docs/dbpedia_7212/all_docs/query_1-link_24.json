        "text": "WALNUT CREEK — In side-by-side classrooms, kindergartners at Bancroft Elementary are learning to read, write, sing, add and talk to each other and their teachers in both English and Spanish.\n\nTeacher Lorena Stiles speaks only Spanish to her students, as she leads them in activities on the carpet in front of a giant “Bienvenidos!” sign, followed by lessons in math, then Spanish reading and writing.\n\nWhen Stiles asked students on Monday to put together the numbers that make “veinticinco,” they held up the number 2 next to the number 5.\n\n“Muy bien!” Stiles said, smiling.\n\nIn honor of Groundhog Day, students read about a “marmota” and wrote short answers in Spanish to questions about what they had read.\n\nNext door, in Elle Velasquez” class, students counted from 1 to 100 in English, adding gestures such as hand-clapping and marching along the way.\n\nEvery day, all 28 students in each class switch places after about an hour-and-a-half. The goal of the pilot dual immersion program is for all students to be bilingual and biliterate in both languages as they progress through elementary school.\n\nThe Mt. Diablo school district, which oversees the program, hopes to attract about 56 more students to the kindergarten program next year. Ideally, the district would like one-third English speakers, one-third bilingual students and one-third Spanish-speakers, said Jeanne Duarte, director of English learner services.\n\n“You will see a mirror image,” Duarte said, of what happens in each classroom throughout the day, as well as what is posted on the walls.\n\nSimilar programs have sprung up in other districts around the state and country, including in the Hayward district, Duarte said. They are different from bilingual programs because they provide 50/50 instruction in English and Spanish and are geared toward students who speak either language, instead of only English learners, she said.\n\nStudent Olive Wright, 6, of Concord, said she loves learning Spanish because it”s challenging and fun.\n\n“I can really roll my ”Rs,”” she said, demonstrating by saying “perro,” which means “dog.”\n\nOlive read two short stories in Spanish, then translated them into English. One featured a white polar bear, while the other described a yellow and orange kite with a long tail.\n\nStiles said students are adapting easily to swapping between two languages, with some helping others when they have trouble.\n\n“They support each other,” Stiles said.\n\nVelasquez said she preps her students before they go into the Spanish classroom.\n\n“I would say, ”In English, we say Q, But, in Spanish, we say, koo.””\n\nParent Traci McPhee, whose son is in the dual immersion program, said she is impressed by the way the teachers coordinate in both languages.\n\n“They”ve done such a great job,” she said. “It”s amazing how in sync both teachers have to be. It”s almost like they”re a married couple — like they have to finish each other”s sentences.”\n\nThe district hopes to add another grade level to the program each year so that those who are in kindergarten now can continue through middle school. Both teachers said they are confident their students will be successful as they transition to new dual immersion first grade classes next year.\n\n“I think it”s going really well,” Velasquez said. “They”re doing it seamlessly.”\n\nif you go:"
