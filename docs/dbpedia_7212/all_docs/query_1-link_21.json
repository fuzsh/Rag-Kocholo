        "text": "English Translation\n\nSilly, you men-so very adept\n\nat wrongly faulting womankind,\n\nnot seeing you’re alone to blame\n\nfor faults you plant in a woman’s mind.\n\nAfter you’ve won by urgent plea\n\nthe right to tarnish her good name,\n\nyou still expect her to behave—\n\nyou, that coaxed her into shame.\n\nYou batter her resistance down\n\nand then, all righteousness, proclaim\n\nthat feminine frivolity,\n\nnot your persistence, is to blame.\n\nWhen it comes to bravely posturing,\n\nyour witlessness must take the prize:\n\nyou’re the child that makes a bogeyman,\n\nand then recoils in fear and cries.\n\nPresumptuous beyond belief,\n\nyou’d have the woman you pursue\n\nbe Thais when you’re courting her,\n\nLucretia once she falls to you.\n\nFor plain default of common sense,\n\ncould any action be so queer\n\nas oneself to cloud the mirror,\n\nthen complain that it’s not clear?\n\nWhether you’re favored or disdained,\n\nnothing can leave you satisfied.\n\nYou whimper if you’re turned away,\n\nyou sneer if you’ve been gratified.\n\nWith you, no woman can hope to score;\n\nwhichever way, she’s bound to lose;\n\nspurning you, she’s ungrateful—\n\nsuccumbing, you call her lewd.\n\nYour folly is always the same:\n\nyou apply a single rule\n\nto the one you accuse of looseness\n\nand the one you brand as cruel.\n\nWhat happy mean could there be\n\nfor the woman who catches your eye,\n\nif, unresponsive, she offends,\n\nyet whose complaisance you decry?\n\nStill, whether it’s torment or anger—\n\nand both ways you’ve yourselves to blame—\n\nGod bless the woman who won’t have you,\n\nno matter how loud you complain.\n\nIt’s your persistent entreaties\n\nthat change her from timid to bold.\n\nHaving made her thereby naughty,\n\nyou would have her good as gold.\n\nSo where does the greater guilt lie\n\nfor a passion that should not be:\n\nwith the man who pleads out of baseness\n\nor the woman debased by his plea?\n\nOr which is more to be blamed—\n\nthough both will have cause for chagrin:\n\nthe woman who sins for money\n\nor the man who pays money to sin?\n\nSo why are you men all so stunned\n\nat the thought you’re all guilty alike?\n\nEither like them for what you’ve made them\n\nor make of them what you can like.\n\nIf you’d give up pursuing them,\n\nyou’d discover, without a doubt,\n\nyou’ve a stronger case to make\n\nagainst those who seek you out.\n\nI well know what powerful arms\n\nyou wield in pressing for evil:\n\nyour arrogance is allied\n\nwith the world, the flesh, and the devil!"
