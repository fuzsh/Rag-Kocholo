        "text": "Spotify is taking its AI DJ feature to the next level by launching a Spanish-language version. This exciting expansion introduces the AI DJ beta to select markets in Latin America and Spain. It will provide users with a more personalized and immersive listening experience.\n\nNew Voice, Same AI Magic\n\nThe Spanish-language voice for the AI DJ is provided by Spotify’s senior music editor, Olivia “Livi” Quiroz Roa. Users now have the option to switch between hearing Livi or Xavier “X” Jernigan, who voices the English-speaking DJ variant that was released in February 2023. This feature uses an AI-generated voice to create radio-like commentary, giving listeners additional context and information about the songs they’re hearing. According to Spotify, this commentary makes listeners less likely to skip to another track.\n\nPersonalized Music Experience\n\nThe AI DJ feature pairs this engaging commentary with an endless playlist of personalized music recommendations. The playlist adapts to user activity, switching genres or artists based on what the user prefers. This ensures that every listening session feels fresh and tailored to individual tastes, keeping the music experience dynamic and exciting.\n\nExpanding Reach\n\nThe Spanish-speaking DJ will be available to Premium users in select Latin American and Spanish markets. This rollout joins the regions where the English-speaking DJ feature has already launched, expanding Spotify’s innovative offerings to a broader audience. This expansion follows recent price increases for Spotify Premium subscriptions in both the US and international markets. Spotify stated that these increases would allow the company to continue investing in and innovating on their product features, ensuring users get the best possible experience.\n\nWith this new feature, Spotify is not just playing music; it’s creating a more connected and engaging world for its listeners, one personalized track at a time. For more on this, check out our in-depth coverage, here."
