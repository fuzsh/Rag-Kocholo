        "text": "The book undertakes to contrast and analyse how the communicational contexts in which borrowing from the indigenous languages of Latin America and the indigenous language of the Canary Islands ('Guanche') took place. The authors summarize the results from existing monographic lexical studies, focusing on the period between 1492 and 1550, known as the 'Antillean stage'. The methodological approach is based on quantitative and qualitative lexical analysis of the corpora. The first five decades of territorial conquest saw the establishment of a Canarian and American society. The authors' leitmotif is that the documents reflect 'the socio-cultural structure of the members that produced them' (p.133), thus their goal is: a) To identify trends and word selections to explain why some words are chosen and not others. The factors that affect word selection include prestige, education as well as the existence of already established communities. b) To highlight the underlying beliefs and attitudes -- motivational factors -- of the participants in the communicative situation that could have motivated lexical borrowing. c) To reconsider the role of register and intertextuality when studying the impact of the indigenous lexicon on the Spanish languages of that period. The book is divided into five chapters plus a conclusion, bibliography and index. The chapters are: 1. 'Introduction' (\"Introducción\"), 2. 'The documentary sources in the American context' (\"Las fuentes documentales en el contexto americano\"), 3. 'Procedures of lexical incorporation by the chroniclers of the Americas' (\"Procedimientos de incorporación léxica en cronistas americanos\"), 4. 'Borrowings from indigenous languages in the documents from the Canary Islands' (\"El indigenismo en la documentación canaria\"), 5. 'The missionary vision in the description of the Canary Islands' (\"La visión misionera en la descripción de Canarias\").\n\nAbout four decades ago, the two modern editions of the Cancionero de obras de burlas (19OB), of Domínguez (1978) and Jauralde Pou-Bellón Cazabán (1974), finally condemned to its deserved obscurity Usoz y Río’s 1841 edition. Even though both his edition and his library on spiritual topics have an evident archaeological interest (Vilar), the Quaker sympathiser born in Spain presented an abbreviated version of this cancionero to prove that, by his lights, the obscene and decadent habits of the Spanish empire were built upon Catholicism. Thus, the first thing to point out is that scholars have only been able to read the complete 19OB since the late 20th century, which has made it impossible for us to understand in depth what we can consider to be the first catalogue of medieval and renaissance jibes and jests written in Spanish.\n\nIn this paper, the author's aim is to indicate the linguistic and cultural relationships between Catalonia and Latin America by analyzing the lexicographical treatment of the words caiman, carei and gall dindi in Spanish and Catalan dictionaries, without taking into account the chronology of their incorporation in either language. In the same way, it has been noted that the information included on the headword depends on the characteristics of both lexicographical traditions.\n\nThe discourse of Otherness is crucial for constructing identity. This paper deals with the role played by the views of the Other in the creation of an image of the Anglo-American as the positive Other in the Canary Islands (Spain), and the emergence of a view of Canarians as the strange natives of an exotic land. After introducing the socio-historical background for these intercultural contacts, we make a brief reference to the way the discourse of Otherness has been used in cultural and literary studies. Then we offer a series of descriptions taken from a selection of English-written publications dealing with the Canaries. Another section is devoted to the Canarian vision of the “ingleses” (English), mainly through the works of two authors, Guerra and Millares Sall. The article is conceived as a broad survey that tries to account both for textual detail and the discursive trends found in the corpus used.\n\nThis paper aims to contribute to contemporary research on Spanish images of Englishness and thus on cross-cultural otherness. More precisely, it seeks to identify and describe the composite image of Anglo-Saxon Others as portrayed in ten nineteenth century Spanish history books and to critically discuss the results. Despite Anglo-Saxon England being a marginal issue for nineteenth century Spanish scholarship, it has been proved that existing narratives constitute seminal representations of Anglo-Saxon identity and serve a neatly defined heterogeneous array of political and collective aims. The present analysis suggests that the portrayal of Anglo-Saxon Others contributes to reinforce the ideological bases on which the Anglo1 This paper was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Education.
