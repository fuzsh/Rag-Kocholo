        "text": "When singer Frank Alton is late for work at a radio station in New York, Conroy, the manager, fires him. Without Frank on the program, Ninón Silk Stockings, the show's sponsor, begins to lose sales. The president of the company, John Baxter, and his bored daughter Lolita, are then dismayed to learn that Frank has begun to work for their competitor, Bon Soir Stockings. After learning that Frank is stealing their customers, Lolita convinces her father and his associates, who do not believe that women can do \"men's\" work, to let her sell stockings. Using the name of Mary Smith, Lolita makes an appointment with Mr. Morán, one of Frank's customers, and then sells him 150 gross of stockings. Discovering that he is being undermined, Frank determines to win his next sale with a man named Fishback, whom he meets for dinner. At the restaurant, Fishback confesses that women are his weakness and eyes \"Mary\" from across the room. Not realizing that she is the salesperson who stole his customer, Frank enlists her help. When Fishback places his order for 300 gross, Lolita uses the Ninón order form without Frank's knowledge. After this second failure, Frank travels to Pottsville, where his customer, Mr. Brown, meets him at the station to tell him that he's already signed an order for Ninón stockings. At an inn in Pottsville, Frank meets Lolita, still in the guise of Mary, and having caught on to the fact that she is stealing his trade, gives her a list of the customers he's planning to see and challenges her to steal them away. The next morning on the train, Frank dresses up like the porter and tricks Lolita into getting off at the wrong stop. When Frank jokingly tells the conductor about the ruse, the conductor places him under arrest. Lolita gets Frank out of jail and tells him that the customer he has come to see, Mr. Evans, is out of town. They decide to declare a truce, and Lolita suggests that they take the rest of the afternoon off. They drive to an isolated spot for a picnic, and when Frank makes a pass at Lolita, she breaks their agreement by returning to the city and leaving him stranded. At Ninón headquarters, Baxter slights Conroy as they plan for the upcoming Annual Stocking Show. At the show, Frank flaunts his new advertising slogan, \"Follow me -- I won't run,\" which he has printed on buttons. In the Ninón dressing room, Conroy, to sabotage Lolita, takes one of Frank's buttons and rips holes in the Ninón stockings. When the models appear in ripped hose, the audience is aghast. Next, Frank sings a song for Bon Soir Stockings and sends his models out into the audience for orders. Lolita stops Fishback as he is about to place an order and, after telling the customers that the runs in Ninón's hosiery were the work of a diabolical competitor, demonstrates their resilience. After the customers flock to buy from Lolita, Frank's boss, who believes that he sabotaged the Ninón show, fires him. Frank then visits Lolita at her home and still unaware of her true identity, mistakenly thinks that Baxter, her father, is making sexual advances toward her. Frank hits Baxter in the face, and after the misunderstanding is cleared up, Frank explains that Conroy ruined the show. Baxter then agrees to rehire Frank, while he and Lolita plan their wedding.\n\nUndercover agent Mark Owens is sent to aid the Border Patrol in the trans-border town of Hernandez in breaking up a well-organized band of smugglers. Since the town is also noted for a place for obtaining quick marriages on the Mexico side, Mark obtains the job of pilot on \"The Honeymoon Express.\" He does not realize that he has been recognized as a G-Man by \"Hot Cake\" Joe, operator of a sandwich stand and an informant for the smugglers. Reporter Nancy Rawlings, assigned to the airport on the American side of the border, sees Mike running the matrimonial express in his flamboyant uniform, and thinks he is ridiculous enough to make a good story. Her suspicions are aroused when he refuses to be photographed. She is further convinced he is a smuggler when she sees him accepting money from Kurt Feldon, suspected head of the smugglers. Feldon has accepted Mike as a genuine pilot for wedding parties and is paying him to steer customers to his café. Learning the truth from Joe, Feldon orders his henchman/flyer Blast Reardon to get rid of Mike. Blast, with a gang moll as his accomplice, charters Mike to fly them across the border to get married. A waitress at the airport, who Nancy has bribed to watch Mike's activities, tips her off about the flight and Nancy hides in the plane. Once in the air, Blast forces Mike to land at the smuggler's hideout, where he is imprisoned."
