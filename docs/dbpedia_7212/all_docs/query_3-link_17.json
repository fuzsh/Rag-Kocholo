        "text": "Season 4 explores celebrations all over the Spanish-speaking world. Many Hispanic celebrations are based in religion, but some involve the melding of Spanish, African and native cultures. Each fiesta is unique to the region where it is celebrated.\n\nThe links below will bring you to the audio, transcript, video, and pdf handout of each of the stories.\n\nEpisode 1: Las Celebraciones hispanas It is said that every day there is a celebration somewhere. This is especially true in the Spanish-speaking world.

No matter where you are in your language journey, stories will help you on your way. Happy listening!\n\nEpisode 2: Las Fallas One of my favorite fiestas occurs in March in the city of Valencia, España. San José (St. Joseph) is the patron saint of Valencia and in his honor, they build impressive life-like sculptures. They also decorate a tall statue of the Virgen María with sweet-smelling carnations and light up the sky with “fuegos artificiales”, or fireworks. This legend is told in the both the present and past tenses. Repeated words and phrases include “madera” (wood), “quema” (burn), “fuego” (fire), “vestido” (dress) and “calle” (street).\n\nEpisode 3: La Santísima Tragedia Latacunga Ecuador is the home of a celebration in honor of la Virgen de las Mercedes (The Virgen Mary has many names and many faces in Hispanic cultures, in this instance, she is the Virgen of Merced, or “Mercy”). They celebrate with a large parade. At the center of this celebration is Mama Negra, a representative of the African cultures in Ecuador. This legend is told in the both the present and past tenses. Repeated words and phrases include “desfile” (parade), “rezar” (to pray), “esclavos” (slaves), “ropa” (clothing) and “iglesia” (church).\n\nEpisode 4: La Feria de las Flores Medellín, Colombia is already a vibrant city, but somehow it becomes even more vibrant and lively during “La Feria de las Flores”. The entire city is decorated by carnations, lilies, orchids, roses and more as the Department of Antioquia, of which Medellín is the capital, celebrates one of its largest exports with flower displays, flower decorations, and a giant flower parade.

Each country has its own special way to showcase their local culture during this multi-day party of food, music, and dancing. Carnaval originated as a three day party before Lent, but has since evolved into vibrant celebrations of culture. In the Dominican Republic, Carnaval lasts an entire month with each town giving it its own twist. This story is told in the both the present and past tenses. Repeated words and phrases include “desfile” (parade),“disfraz” (costume), “máscara” (mask) and “diablo” (devil).\n\nEpisode 6: Inti Raymi Inti Raymi was the most important celebration of the Incas.

In this region you can find Bolivian, Peruvian, and indigenous influence. This combination of cultures is presented each year in the Fiesta de la Tirana. While “Tirana” means “tyrant” the festival actually celebrates the Virgen del Carmen, one of the Virgin Mary’s many incarnations.
