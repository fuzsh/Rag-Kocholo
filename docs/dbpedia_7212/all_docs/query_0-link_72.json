        "text": "CONCORD — Parents interested in enrolling their students in a new regional magnet program at Holbrook Elementary, focused on language and culture, are invited to attend an informational meeting scheduled Tuesday morning.\n\nThe meeting will take place from 8:30 a.m. to 10 a.m. at Willow Creek Center at 1026 Mohr Lane in Concord.\n\nThe school’s principal, Marga Marshall, will be sharing updates about Holbrook Language and Culture Academy’s two-way dual immersion language program, that will serve the Mt. Diablo school district community starting next school year. The school was closed in 2010, after serving the Mt. Diablo community for 56 years, because of budget cuts, but will reopen in the fall as a regional magnet school.\n\nStudents, kindergarten through fifth grade, will receive instruction in both languages. Students will spend 50 percent of their day learning to read and write in English, and the other 50 percent learning to read and write in Spanish. Students are not required to speak both languages in the home.\n\nStudents will also be offered opportunities each week to learn a variety of languages, including Russian, German and Italian. Multi-cultural events also will be held throughout the year, including grade-specific presentations emphasizing different languages and cultural practices for countries where the language is spoken.\n\nStudents also will be given opportunities to engage in science, technology and project-based learning that will to help prepare them for the future and global world, district officials said."
