        "text": "Located in the province of Tungurahua in Ecuador’s Andean region, Baños de Agua Santa is a tourist town that sits in a beautiful valley surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. The area is known for its hot springs, waterfalls and rivers, as well as for the huge variety of outdoor and cultural activities on offer.\n\nAmong the most popular tourist attractions in Baños de Agua Santa are the Pailon del Diablo waterfall, the Baños cable car, the hot springs of the city and the Mirador Cruz de Bellavista, among others. Read on to discover these places and a few others, as well as some tips to help you organize your trip with greater ease.\n\nWhat are the best things to see and do in Baños de Agua Santa?\n\n1. El Pailon del Diablo Waterfall\n\nAlthough it is not exactly in the city of Baños, but about 15 kilometres away, the Pailón del Diablo waterfall is one of the main attractions you should visit. This impressive waterfall is some 80 metres high, and its eerie name comes from the fact that, according to legend. If you stare into the mist created by the waterfall and catch a glimpse of the “pailón” or cauldron-shaped rock into which the water falls, you can see the face of the devil.\n\nBesides watching the waterfall, you can do many other nature-related activities in the place where the Pailon is located. Examples of these are organized ecological walks, crossing a suspension bridge or entering the “Grieta al Cielo”, a huge crack in the rock generated over centuries by water erosion. The entrance fee to the waterfall and surrounding area is €2.5.\n\n2. Waterfall traverses on tarabita\n\nIn case you don’t know the word, a tarabita is a kind of cable car widely used in the mountainous areas of Latin America to cross river areas or ravines. And besides being a practical means of transport, it is also a real adventure that you can experience on your trip to Baños de Agua Santa.\n\nKnown as Tarabita Manto de la Novia, this cable car crosses the Pastaza River and takes visitors to the “Manto de la Novia” waterfall, a beautiful 60-metre high waterfall surrounded by lush vegetation. This thrilling experience offers breathtaking views of the river and the surrounding rainforest.\n\n3. Mirador Cruz de Bellavista\n\nIf you want to know where to get the perfect postcard of your trip to Baños de Agua Santa, the undisputed answer is the Mirador Cruz de Bellavista. And not only that. The viewpoint is high enough to offer views. Not only to the beautiful city, but to the entire valley and the immense Tungurahua volcano.\n\nAlthough you can, of course, get there by taxi. A very good option if time permits is to walk from Baños. The walk takes about half an hour, but will pass in the blink of an eye thanks to the beauty of the road. However, if your legs aren’t used to climbing hills, it’s best to get there by taxi and walk back.\n\nPrice for access to the lookout point: €2.\n\n4. Treehouse\n\nOne of the most popular places among visitors to Baños de Agua Santa is its famous Tree House. It is located 2660 metres above sea level on the slopes of the Tungurahua volcano. So, it offers wonderful views of the valley. Visiting the Tree House is also an adventure, as it has a cliff-side swing that, if you decide to climb, will send you soaring over Tungurahua.\n\nIt can be reached with your own vehicle or by bus. The entrance fee to the house is €1, and it is open from 7:00 to 19:00.\n\n5. Visit the hot springs of Baños de Agua Santa\n\nAnd in a town called “Baños de Agua Santa”, you can’t miss the natural hot springs that spring from the mountains. One of the most relaxing is the hot springs “El Placer”. They are located in the Sangay National Park, some 140 km from Baños. But are well worth a visit if you have the time. Visiting the El Placer hot springs is an experience only for the most adventurous and nature-loving, as getting there is not easy, but very beautiful. First you have to reach the wetlands known as Laguna Negra, about two hours by car from Baños. And here begins a beautiful walk of about 3 hours in the middle of nature. The hot springs are a natural oasis of tranquillity and beauty.\n\nBut these are not the only ones. If you want some closer to Baños de Agua Santa and with a less demanding route, we recommend the Santa Ana hot springs. With different pools of sulphate waters and different temperatures, with incredible views of the mountains. The price is €2 adults and €1 children.\n\nWhat to see in the surroundings of Baños de Agua Santa?\n\nQuito, the capital city of Ecuador\n\nBaños de Agua Santa is about 190 km from Quito. So, it’s likely that if you’re travelling to the Amazonian city, you’ll pass through Quito first. So, if you didn’t plan to spend at least a day in Quito before heading to Baños, we highly recommend you do so. As the capital of Ecuador is a beautiful city that’s well worth a visit.\n\nQuito is a city steeped in history and culture and is known for its beautiful colonial architecture and stunning mountain views. Its Historic Centre is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is home to colonial churches and beautiful old squares. The Parque Metropolitano is one of the city’s largest parks and offers panoramic views and picnic areas. Other tourist attractions include the Panecillo, the Basilica del Voto Nacional, the Museo de la Ciudad and the Cable Car. These are just some of the many attractions Quito has to offer visitors. But this vibrant city has much more to discover.\n\nWhat and where to eat in Baños de Agua Santa\n\nEcuadorian gastronomy is characterized by a mixture of indigenous, Spanish and African influences, as well as by the use of seasonal products. Among its typical dishes include ceviche, locro de papas, seco de carne, arroz con menestra and churrasco, among others. And more specifically from Baños, one of its dishes per excellence are the empanadas de viento, delicious wheat flour pasties filled with cheese.\n\nRestaurante Las Orquídeas: A restaurant with traditional cuisine of Ecuador and Baños on the slopes of the Tunguragua volcano and beautiful views.
