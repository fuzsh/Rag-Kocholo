        "text": "Christians are the largest religious group in the world, fueling the need to communicate Christian words and expressions in different languages. In 2015, there were 2.3 billion Christians in the world, which composed 31% of Earth’s human population.\n\nThat’s a lot of people!\n\nThe Bible—the most important book for Christians—has been translated from the original Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic to hundreds of other languages. Because of this, many Christian words, expressions, and common phrases have made their way around the world—however, the language barrier can be a problem when trying to share the Gospel.\n\nThis article will be useful for you if you are preparing to go on a Mission to a Spanish-speaking country, or if you want to discuss the Gospel and Christian beliefs with Spanish speakers, or if you are looking to expand your language knowledge and practice your Spanish fluency.\n\nLet’s get to it!\n\n200+ Spanish Christian Words\n\n200+ words will improve your vocabulary by leaps and bounds! To keep it interesting, this article is divided into several segments, allowing you easy access where you can quickly find whatever word or expression you are searching for.\n\nChristian Denominations\n\nA Christian denomination refers to a distinct religious body in Christianity and comprises all church congregations of the same kind, even if the traits, history, organization, leadership, doctrine and worship style are different. Christian denomination is a neutral term that refers to established Christian churches, unlike sects and cults.\n\nDifferent Christian denominations in Spanish include:\n\nWords for Leadership and Members\n\nEach denomination and church has their own words for referring to their members and leaders, but these are the more common ones:\n\nInfrastructure\n\nDifferent buildings and infrastructure provide spaces for worshippers to congregate and celebrate their beliefs and faith. Some of these spaces include:\n\nHolidays\n\nMany common Christian words in Spanish refer to holidays and celebrations. Some of these are mostly celebrated by the Catholic Church, and others are so popular that they’re celebrated by Christians and non-Christians.\n\nChristian Traditions\n\nChristianity and all its denominations have traditions that have existed since the beginning of the primitive church—the Church founded by the followers, especially the Apostles, of Jesus Christ after his ascension to Heaven— and continue to be practiced to this day. Other traditions are more recent, but that doesn’t impact their importance.\n\nMost Common Christian Words\n\nCommon Christian words are relevant for preaching, sermons, lessons, or in casual conversation with other Christians. Let’s take a look!\n\nThis table has words related to God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit so you can access them easily and quickly!\n\nHere are some Christian words divided in alphabetical order for easy access and understanding:\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nL\n\nM\n\nN\n\nO\n\nP\n\nR\n\nS\n\nT\n\nU\n\nW\n\nHow to Learn Spanish While Reading the Bible\n\nTo learn something new, like Spanish, you need constant exposure to the language to improve your familiarity with the words and their pronunciation. And, of course, you benefit from studying new words on a regular basis to help expand your vocabulary.\n\nLearning Christian words is an amazing way to build your vocabulary, but another great way of learning Spanish is reading your Bible!\n\nTo learn Spanish by reading your bible, you will need:\n\nA Bible in English\n\nA Bible in Spanish (it can be a virtual bible)\n\nA dictionary\n\nThe will to learn and grow, not only in the Scriptures but also in the Spanish language\n\nI highly recommend you have a “bilingual” bible (like this one), but if you can’t or don’t want to buy another bible, it’s important that your English and Spanish Bibles are the same version, for example:\n\nKing James Version / KJV or Versión del Rey Jacobo\n\nNew International Version or NVI / Nueva Versión Internacional\n\nQueen Valera 1960 / Reina Valera 1960\n\nThis will help you to learn the words according to each version. For example, the NVI version comes closest to the way we talk nowadays, making it easier to understand. The Queen Valera version, on the other hand, has antiquated expressions of speech that are difficult to understand—even to Spanish speakers!\n\nStrategies for Learning Spanish with Christian Words\n\n1. Memorize Your Favorite Verses\n\nTo learn Spanish while studying the Bible, memorize your favorite verses in Spanish! This way you can be sure of what you are expressing and proclaiming, and it’s easier to associate the English words you know by heart with the new Spanish vocabulary.\n\n2. Listen to Spanish Sermons and Podcasts\n\nAnother great idea to practice Spanish while fortifying your Christian faith is to listen to sermons and Christian podcasts! You can listen anytime—while you’re exercising, driving, cleaning, or working. With this technique, you become accustomed to hearing Spanish, while enhancing your exposure to new words and different accents. As an added bonus, you could watch Spanish sermons with subtitles or listen to Christian podcasts in Spanish with transcripts (some of which have English translations).\n\n3. Explore Sunday School Lessons in Spanish\n\nA third way to practice Spanish with the Gospel is with Sunday School lessons! These lessons are simple, to help kids understand them, but they still have the essence of the Bible. It’s a great way to learn about your favorite bible stories at the same time you practice your Spanish.\n\nCheck this out! The Jesus Storybook Bible: Every Story Whispers His Name (Spanish Edition)\n\n4. Listen to Religious Music in Spanish\n\nAnd lastly, an entertaining way to practice your Spanish with Christian resources is to listen to religious, or “Christian” music! I recommend you find the lyrics to study as you sing and to enjoy this fun and engaging time of worship. Spanish music will help you become more familiar with the accents as well as common words and expressions!\n\nBible Verses in Spanish for Religious Conversation\n\nHere are some popular bible verses perfect to use in a religious conversation, share with your friends and family or to use them to share the Gospel with Spanish speakers!\n\n“Porque tanto amó Dios al mundo que dio a su Hijo unigénito, para que todo el que cree en él no se pierda, sino que tenga vida eterna.” Juan 3:16 NVI\n\n“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” John 3:16 NIV\n\n“19 Por tanto, vayan y hagan discípulos de todas las naciones, bautizándolos en el nombre del Padre y del Hijo y del Espíritu Santo, 20 enseñándoles a obedecer todo lo que les he mandado a ustedes. Y les aseguro que estaré con ustedes siempre, hasta el fin del mundo.” Mateo 28:19-20 NVI\n\n“19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” Matthew 28:19-20 NIV\n\n“4 El amor es paciente, es bondadoso. El amor no es envidioso ni jactancioso ni orgulloso. 5 No se comporta con rudeza, no es egoísta, no se enoja fácilmente, no guarda rencor. 6 El amor no se deleita en la maldad, sino que se regocija con la verdad. 7 Todo lo disculpa, todo lo cree, todo lo espera, todo lo soporta.” 1ra de Corintios 13:4-7 NVI\n\n“4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres”. 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 NIV\n\n“Por eso les digo: Crean que ya han recibido todo lo que estén pidiendo en oración, y lo obtendrán.” Marcos 11:24 NVI\n\n“Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.” Mark 11:24 NIV\n\n“Así está escrito:\n\nNo hay un solo justo, ni siquiera uno.” Romanos 3:10 NVI\n\n“As it is written:\n\nThere is no one righteous, not even one.” Romans 3:10 NIV\n\nPractice Makes Perfect!\n\nWhen you practice your Spanish every day, you improve your skills in comprehension and expression—just like when you study your Bible!\n\nThe most effective way to learn and practice Spanish is with personalized classes!
