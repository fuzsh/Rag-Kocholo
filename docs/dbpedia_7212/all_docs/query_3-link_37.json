Please read this Disclosure for details.\n\nIf youâre planning a trip to Guatemala, you donât want to miss el DÃ­a del Diablo â the Day of the Devil. Not only is it one of the most important Christmas holiday traditions in Guatemala, itâs one of the worldâs most exciting fire festivals.\n\nEvery year on December 7th, Guatemalans light bonfires and burn the devil in effigy.\n\nWhile many celebrations take place on streets outside peopleâs homes, the most spectacular event is the Quema del Diablo or Burning of the Devil in the countryâs former capital city of La Antigua.\n\nHow Do they Celebrate Christmas in Guatemala on Dia del Diablo?\n\nDuring this special Guatemalan tradition, people douse enormous effigies with gasoline and light them on fire in the streets in a ceremony called la quema del diablo (burning of the devil).\n\nThey also light bonfires, buy devil piÃ±atas and enjoy special dÃ­a del diablo food. The fiery festivities kick off the beginning of the Christmas season in Guatemala.\n\nItâs well worth travelling to Guatemala to experience the Burning of the Devil festival in person!\n\nWhile itâs possible to experience the Quema del Diablo independently (and instructions to do so are below), the best way to get the most out of it is on a private walking tour of Antigua.\n\nCheck prices and availability of a private walking tour of Antigua on Viator.com.\n\nHistory of La Quema del Diablo (Burning of the Devil) in Guatemala\n\nLike many other major celebrations and traditions in Guatemala, the Burning of the Devil is a Guatemalan custom deeply rooted in spiritual and pre-Hispanic beliefs.\n\nThe history of el dia del diablo dates back to ancient times.\n\nThe power of fire has long been recognized by early cultures who revered the element of fire for its ability to provide warmth, to provide sustenance through cooking as well as its ability to destroy.\n\nFire rituals can be seen in virtually every culture and religion around the world.\n\nFrom Buddhist Fire ceremonies to First Nations smoke smudging traditions to the fireworks of Valencia, the primary symbolic function of fire is one of purification, cleansing and transformation into the divine.\n\nIn Guatemala, the tradition of la quema del diablo or burning of the devil symbolizes the ritual cleansing and banishment of bad spirits to usher in the Christmas season.\n\nItâs a process of purification leading up to a holy season filled with important religious dates and other Guatemala Christmas traditions.\n\nThese include:\n\nDecember 8th Feast Day honouring the Conception of the Virgin Mary.\n\nnightly posadas (processions) that take place during the nine days leading to Christmas.\n\nChristmas Eve or Nochebuena.\n\nNavidad (Christmas Day)\n\nThree Kings Day.\n\nWhen is DÃ­a del Diablo in Guatemala?\n\nWhile the DÃ­a del Diablo and the fire ceremonies, fireworks and festivities take place on December 7th, preparations begin several days in advance.\n\nOne of the places to go to fully understand this Guatemalan tradition is the village of ConcepciÃ³n. This picturesque Maya village is set in a fertile valley 20 minutes from SololÃ¡, near Lake Atitlan, a major natural landmark in Guatemala.\n\nThe townâs patron saint is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and her saint day of December 8th. At the heart of ConcepciÃ³n is a sturdy Catholic church constructed in 1621.\n\nItâs one of Guatemalaâs few wooden churches to have survived centuries of earthquakes. It features a wooden roof carved with angels, saints and apostles.\n\nItâs also home to an active cofradÃ­a, a Maya brotherhood who are guardians of ancient religious practices.\n\nMany still wear their traditional embroidered clothing featuring a distinctive batâa symbol for the last Kaqchikel dynastyâatop rainbow-hued trousers, a tunic wrap and sandals.\n\nFor the December 8th Feast Day honouring the Conception of the Virgin Mary, they lay wooden platforms through the center aisle of the church to serve as pagan altars for offerings of food, candles and other tribute.\n\nThe church brotherhood also installs a ceremonial silver candelabra and carries the Virgin in procession through the village.\n\nItâs incredible to see the diminutive stature of the Virgin festooned with money, lottery tickets and other adornment for her saint day.\n\nThe locals also celebrate with fireworks, music and special dishes such as pulique, a chicken stew.\n\nTip: Learn how to prepare authentic Maya pulique in my post on Cooking Class in Guatemala: Ceremonial Chicken.\n\nWhere is the Burning of the Devil in Antigua Guatemala\n\nIn addition to being the heart of organized festivities for la Quema del Diablo in Guatemala, Antigua is also a great base for experiencing Semana Santa (Easter Holy Week) and Day of the Dead, other unique Guatemala celebrations.\n\nSome of the other top things to do in Antigua include studying Spanish at one of the many Spanish language schools, climbing a volcano and visiting the coffee plantation dotted on the lush volcanic slopes nearby.\n\nA good hotel for Day of the Devil is Hotel Cirilo, an art-filled boutique hotel in the quiet Candelaria neighborhood.\n\nAlthough not quite as luxe ( or as pricey) as Hotel Panza Verde (read my hotel reviews in 3 Budget Hotels Youâll Love in Antigua), Hotel Cirilo offers an elegant and quiet stay away from the festivities.\n\nThe sense of tranquility is accentuated by its setting within the bougainvillea-draped ruins of a 17th century chapel.\n\nAs the sun begins to set in the evening of Dec. 7th, people make their way to Barrio de Concepcion.\n\nIn Antigua this is the epicentre of Quema del Diablo or Burning of the Devil festivities.\n\nYou know youâre in the right neighbourhood when you see this sign. Or, just follow the crowds.\n\nItâs the opposite side of town from La Merced church.\n\nAlthough other Guatemalan communities celebrate by burning tires in the streets, in the Concepcion neighborhood of Antigua, authorities are trying to keep festivities under control for safety reasons.\n\nA papier-mÃ¢chÃ© effigy of the devil serves as a hub for a giant communal bonfire. A firetruck with firefighters is always nearby on standby.\n\nLa Quema del Diablo Food and Festivities\n\nMuch like most other Guatemala celebrations, food is a highlight of the Quema del Diablo festival. Traditional food stands are packed with street food goodies including:\n\nbunuelos, deep friend donuts drenched in anise-scented honey\n\nrompope, a spiced eggnog from Quetzaltenango,\n\ntortas (crusty buns stuffed with meat and crisp vegetables)\n\nRubbing shoulders with locals, you can watch as the 10-foot tall devils, such as the one pictured above and crafted by artist Pablo Godinez Pichiya, get soaked with an incendiary fuel.\n\nThen, a costumed announcer will step forward. And, to the sound of a full brass band, heâll renounce a long list of transgressions committed by politicians.\n\nThen, a flaming torch sets the effigy of the devil on fire.\n\nWhile the devil burns, flames and sparks will dance into the night sky.\n\nBetween cameras flashing and shouts from the crowd itâs a bacchanalian celebration merging Guy Fawkes Day and Halloween.\n\nThe Burning of the Devil â La Quema del Diablo â is an incredible (and unique) way to usher in the Christmas season!\n\nLike this post?
