        "text": "These unique Mexican quotes in Spanish celebrate Mexican culture. They‚Äôve shaped the thinking, traditions, and customs of generations of Mexicans.\n\nProverbs are phrases that reveal a general truth, a moral, or a piece of advice. Mexican proverbs about success, love, and life often include food, animals, or habits.\n\nThe many benefits of learning these classic Mexican proverbs include:\n\nLearning colloquial sayings\n\nUnderstanding Mexican culture\n\nSounding like a native Spanish-speaker\n\nMexican Quotes About Love\n\n1. Agua que no has de beber, d√©jala correr ‚Äì Anonymous\n\nLiteral translation: Water that you must not drink, let it run.\n\nThis Mexican proverb warns us not to get involved in something that we won‚Äôt be able to face later. People normally say this to you so that you don‚Äôt dar alas (give wings) to anyone.\n\nDar alas means to seem interested in someone when you really aren‚Äôt. Someone who ‚Äúgives wings‚Äù is often seen as abusive or unreliable, so you give them this advice to stop that behavior.\n\n2. Mejor solo que mal acompa√±ado ‚Äì Anonymous\n\nLiteral translation: Better alone than In bad company.\n\nIt is better to be alone than to be around a toxic person. In Mexico when people ask about a boy‚Äôs girlfriend and he says she couldn‚Äôt come, people may joke with this saying.\n\n3. Escoge una persona que te mire como si quiz√°s fueras magia ‚Äì Frida Kahlo\n\nLiteral translation: Choose a person who looks at you as if you were magic.\n\nThis is a romantic Mexican quote from revolutionary artist Frida Kahlo. When you watch a magic trick, your face expresses admiration and surprise, and you can‚Äôt believe your eyes. This is the feeling Frida wishes for you, to be with a person that looks at you with such delight.\n\nSee also: 25 Famous Movie Quotes from Incredible Spanish Movies\n\n4. Amo el canto del cenzontle p√°jaro de 400 voces, amo el color del jade, y el enervante perfume de las flores, pero amo m√°s a mi hermano, el hombre ‚Äì Nezahualc√≥yotl\n\nLiteral translation: I love the sound of the mound bird of 400 voices, I love the color of jade, and the unnerving perfume of the flowers, but I love my brother more, the man.\n\nThis poetic Mexican quote expresses gratitude for nature and its beauty, yet a greater love for humankind.\n\n5. Todo acto de creaci√≥n, es un acto de amor ‚Äì Jos√© Revueltas\n\nLiteral translation: Every act of creation is an act of love.\n\nThis Jos√© Revueltas Mexican quote in Spanish is true. When you create something purposely‚Äîa painting, a building, a baby‚Äîyou put in the effort, focus, time, and money. That‚Äôs why endeavors like this are considered an act of love.\n\n6. Amamos a un ser mortal como si fuese inmortal ‚Äì Octavio Paz\n\nLiteral translation: We love a mortal being as if it were immortal.\n\nOctavio Paz was a Mexican writer who won the Nobel Prize in 1990. He created this phrase as part of his response to the fascinating question ‚Äúwhat is love?‚Äù in one of his last pieces. Octavio said writing about love while on his last days felt like a goodbye or a testament.\n\nMexican Quotes About Food\n\n7. Barriga llena, coraz√≥n contento ‚Äì Anonymous\n\nLiteral translation: Full belly, happy heart.\n\nThis is a typical Mexican grandma phrase. Whenever you feel sad, brokenhearted, or lonely Mexican matriarchs try to help by stuffing you with delicious food.\n\n8. La panza es primero ‚Äì Anonymous\n\nLiteral translation: The belly is first.\n\nIn Mexico, once you eat you can do anything else because being hungry ruins any mood or party.\n\n9. Sali√≥ m√°s caro el caldo que las alb√≥ndigas ‚Äì Anonymous\n\nLiteral translation: The broth was more expensive than the meatballs.\n\nWe use this Mexican proverb plenty. You normally say this when the solution was more expensive or cost more effort than the original problem. Another analogy for this can be ‚Äúthe wrapping was more expensive than the present.‚Äù\n\nMexican quotes\n\n10. Echarle mucha crema a sus tacos ‚Äì Anonymous\n\nLiteral translation: Add a lot of cream to their tacos.\n\nSomeone ‚Äúadds a lot of cream to their tacos‚Äù when they exaggerate their skills or achievements. It involves a lot of ego and people can easily perceive it as false.\n\nMexican Proverbs About Life\n\n11. Al que a buen √°rbol se arrima, buena sombra le cobija ‚Äì Anonymous\n\nLiteral translation: He who gets close to a good tree is sheltered by good shade.\n\nThis Mexican quote teaches you to get close to a skilled person to help you. If you do, this experience will benefit you.\n\n12. M√°s sabe el diablo por viejo que por diablo ‚Äì Anonymous\n\nLiteral translation: The devil knows more by being old than by being the devil.\n\nThis Mexican quote is about respecting your elders. It‚Äôs another way of saying ‚Äúlisten to what I am telling you, I know more than you because I‚Äôm older.‚Äù\n\n13. El que se enoja, pierde ‚Äì Anonymous\n\nLiteral translation: The one who gets mad loses.\n\nThis is a wise dicho (saying) that tells you to try to find solutions without getting angry. If two people are in conflict, the one who invests more anger loses.\n\n14. Mucho ayuda el que poco estorba ‚Äì Anonymous\n\nLiteral translation: The one who hinders little helps greatly.\n\nThis Mexican quote is an indirect way of saying ‚Äúget out of the way!‚Äù Sometimes it‚Äôs best to stop trying to help‚Äîand start helping a lot by bowing out.\n\n15. Ni tanto que queme al santo, ni tanto que no lo alumbre ‚Äì Anonymous\n\nLiteral translation: Not so much that it burns the saint, not so much that it does not illuminate it\n\nThis Mexican proverb comes from the Catholic tradition. What it means is that both extremes are bad, if you put a lot of candles around the saint‚Äîsomething we do when we ask for a miracle or favor‚Äîyou might burn it, if you put the only one you might not even be able to see it. Instead, the key is balance.\n\nThe most common way of using this Mexican quote is to make it short: ni tanto que queme al santo. It is easier to learn and say because that way it also rhymes.\n\nSee also: 25 Funny Mexican Spanish Quotes With English Translations\n\nMexican Quotes About Success\n\n16. A quien madruga Dios lo ayuda ‚Äì Anonymous\n\nLiteral translation: God helps the one who wakes up early.\n\nThose who make an effort to wake up early and work are favored by God or other circumstances.

No estudio para saber m√°s, sino para ignorar menos ‚Äì Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz\n\nLiteral translation: I don‚Äôt study to know more, but to ignore less.\n\nSor Juana In√©s de la Cruz, one of the greatest exponents of the Golden Age of Literature in Spanish was a bright mind born in an archaic world. As a woman, she wasn‚Äôt allowed in school or intellectual circles So Sor Juana had to dress up as a man to get a formal education.\n\nA famous historian once said that he studied to calm the anxiety produced by not knowing. This Mexican quote encompasses that idea and more.\n\n20. M√°s vale ser cabeza de rat√≥n que cola de le√≥n ‚Äì Anonymous\n\nLiteral translation: Better to be the head of a mouse than the tail of a lion.\n\nIt‚Äôs better to be the leader of a little group than to be the least remarkable in a big group.
