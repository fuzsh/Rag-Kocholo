Vaqueros de La Cruz del Diablo is a photographic work that Werner Segarra has undertaken in astonishing detail since 1982 when, all but by accident, her reached northern Mexico's Senora Sierra and found himself facinated by it's landscape, people and cowboy culture. The history of Senora's cowboys called Vaqueros goes back to the sixteenth century, when the first heards reached northwest Mexico. The later presents of the Jesuits along the banks of the Yaqui River gave rise to the live stock ranching.

Vaqueros de La Cruz del Diablo represents not only cultural heritage but also the narration of change processes in a world of which Werner Segarra is not and ineluctable part.
