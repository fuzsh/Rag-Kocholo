Drottningholm Palace (Drottningholm Slott) is a well-preserved royal palace in Sweden, renowned as the ‘Versailles of Scandinavia’.

History of Drottningholm Palace

The first incarnation of Drottningholm Palace was built by King Johan III in the late 16th century. The king built it for his wife, Queen Katarina Jagellonika, hence its name meaning ‘Queen’s Island’. However, this palace was razed to the ground by a fire in 1661 and a new one built in its place in 1662, marking the foundation of the Drottningholm Palace visible today.

It was the influence of Crown Princess Louisa-Ulrika in the 18th century which can still be felt most keenly. She had Drottningholm Palace renovated in image of Versailles, taking inspiration from the opulence of Louis XV.
