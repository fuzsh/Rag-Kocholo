The most interesting building in the gardens of Drottningholm Palace is the Kina Slott (Chinese Palace). In 1753, at her 33rd birthday, queen Louisa Ulrika received a wooden Chinese pavilion as a birthday gift from her husband, king Adolf Frederick. It was secretly constructed in Stockholm and transported in pieces to Drottningholm, where it was reassembled. Ten years later the fragile wooden pavilion was replaced by the current group of four small pavilions, magnificently designed by Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz in Rococo style with elements that were considered typically Chinese. At the time Europe's royal families were intrigued by Chinese culture and almost all royal pleasure castles had a Chinese pavilion.
