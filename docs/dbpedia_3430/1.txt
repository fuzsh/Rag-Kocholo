The Chinese Pavilion (Swedish: Kina slott), located in the grounds of the Drottningholm Palace park, is a Chinese-inspired royal pavilion originally built between 1753â€“1769. The pavilion is currently one of Sweden's Royal Palaces and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The first building was a simple pavilion with two wings in Chinese style. The pavilion was a surprise gift to the Queen from King Adolf Frederick. Having been built in haste and secrecy, the small castle did not endure the harsh Swedish climate.

The second and current structure replaced the old wooden pavilion from 1753. Designed by Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, construction began in 1763 and was completed in 1769 (Wikipedia).
