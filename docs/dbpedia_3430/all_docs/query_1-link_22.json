        "text": "This article examines special features of \"Chinoiserie\" or \"Chinese fashion\" (\"Kitaischina\") in Russia from the late 17th to the early 18th century: The reign of Peter the First. It discusses this cultural phenomenon's historical origins, demonstrates the role of Chinese luxury goods and art objects in the era's Russo-Chinese cultural exchange, and illustrates how Chinese decorative arts were used in Russian palaces. While Chinoiserie in Russia was influenced by similar trends in Western Europe, it was rooted in the unique history of regular contacts between Russia and the Qing Empire. Chinese objects not only appeared as commodities in the higher levels of Russian society, they also contributed to the prestige of the Russian state. Peter the First had a political purpose behind the collection, display and imitation of Chinese art objects in Russian palaces, as these practices demonstrated the growing wealth and power of newly established Russian Empire, which enjoyed trade connections with the Qing Empire. While contemporary perceptions of China in Russia were derived mostly by the exotic images of export art, ethnographic collections of genuine Chinese utensils, which were founded during that period, also contributed to Russian views of China. This research uses a comprehensive methodology, combining studies of material objects preserved in Russian museums and written sources, including archival records.\n\nThe quotation from a satiric verse by a Russian 18th century poet Antiokh Kantemir included in the title of the paper, shows an important aspect of the image of China in the Russian artistic space of the 18th century – from Peter I to Catherine II. Strange and funny – this is the formula that concentrates the images of China in chinoiserie style. British researcher Katie Scott, basing on the concept of Orientalism by E. Said, showed that the “invention” of chinoiserie became a form of representation of the Other in European art of the 18th century. Cultural transfer of chinoiserie from Western Europe to Russia was not only linked to the transfer of artistic techniques, but also with the principles of the creation of the image of the Other.\n\nIn the realm of ideas, cross-culturally there are those who take or borrow and those who offer or give. There are those who act with knowledge of actualities and sources and those to whom it doesn’t occur to care. And, there are those who tailor ideas to be used according to views they construct of their audience or clients. All positions in the matrix of possibilities suggested in these oppositions have been occupied over the history of Chinese-style gardens and garden ideas outside China. The ignorant, the knowledgeable and the cunning have each been active both as borrowers and as donors. Concentrating on the development of now publicly-accessible gardens, this paper considers first the history of Chinese-style garden ideas – initially in Japan and South-East Asia, then in Western Europe and, after a considerable hiatus (just before which the favour was briefly returned), now all over the world. But, that history is balanced with consideration of the future: through focusing on three of the problems with wider dissemination and further development of Chinese-style garden ideas – their architectural quality, Chinese taste in rocks, and the already deep entanglement of Japanese-style garden ideas with Modernist landscape aesthetics.\n\nThe first of two, related projects, The Garden of the Cool Change is a project for a hypothetical garden in suburban Melbourne, designed on Chinese principles – though it is NOT a classical Chinese garden. The project explores connections between poetry, painting, the garden and architecture in China and inklings of similar connections in Australia. The Garden of the Cool Change uses Australian means to do what a naturalised Song, Ming or early Qing, Jiangnan Chinese transported to the present might have attempted: to make an allusive, condensed picture of European Australia and some of its iconic experiences that are peculiar to its place. At the same time, the garden is a (curious) suburban dwelling, a private place of contemplation, art and writing and a centre for entertaining friends. It is not any Chineseness that matters, but the potential for experiential and intellectual richness as an unfolding, inhabited and embodied place. We think that designing is a particularly fruitful way to study something. The whole enigma of design is in its synthetic, nonreductive character – necessary in art – as opposed to the logical exploration or analysis in scientific thinking. Our project is an ongoing, open-ended experiment. Several particular interests drive our efforts: in translation and in design approaches, strategies and methods – how do Chinese gardens attempt ‘maximalism’ (lots of ideas packed into one artifact) and ‘simultaneity’ (a ‘symphonic’ composition), for example. But, our interest is especially in works of art which exist not entirely in the material artifact, but through that comprehension which is only possible with participation. Mostly, the paper describes The Garden of the Cool Change and the principles on which it is based. It considers briefly the development of the project as it has been recorded in conventional files, lectures, drawings, participation in Exhibitions, Decision Diaries, written papers, Precedence Diagrams, seminars, the preparation of a multimedia design approach and design methods tool and the design of a second, quite different garden together with their mutual influences and interactions – noting particularly two sets of rules for describing gardens that have been developed as the result of the research. The paperconcludes with reflections on what has been learned from this experiment.\n\nThe case studied in this chapter deals with the social sphere located between the official cosmopolitanism promoted by the court and rivalries and tensions characteristic of professional corporations. The critical reappraisal of interactions between foreigners and local elites nuances the opposition between aristocratic cosmopolitanism and nascent nationalism—an opposition that informs social and cultural histories of the Russian nobility (Greenfeld 1990). How did Russian nobles feel about their foreign peers who had to leave their country and to abandon property (and rent), and who came to Russia to enjoy ranks, pensions, and honors dispensed by the imperial court? Did the local elite pride itself on its new capacity as the host offering refuge to those who, until recently, pretended to be the role model of the civilized world? These questions will guide my essay in the social history of perceptions of Europeans among Russian elites.\n\nPortraits with black pages constitute a special group of artwork in eighteenth-century Russian art. This motif is an example of cultural transfer, during which signs inevitably changed their meanings. The emergence of the portrait with a black page in sixteenth-century European painting was preceded by a long process of selecting and combining elements. By the end of the seventeenth century, the iconographic canon had been formed and became a representation of Europe’s cultural superiority over the non-European world. The transfer of the motif into Russian art at the beginning of the eighteenth century was accompanied by a reduction of the social referent and the use of details and nuances, and by the transformation of the image of cultural identity into the abstract sign of supreme authority. This motif was in demand in Russian art, due to the experiments in iconography, resulting from the general processes of Europeanization, the specific circumstances of the accession to the throne as a result of palace coups, as well as from the issue of representation of a female ruler."
