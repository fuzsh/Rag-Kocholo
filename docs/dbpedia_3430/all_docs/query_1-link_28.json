        "text": "Archaeological excavations at Guishan in the southern end of Taiwan have recovered more than a hundred glass beads dating to mid-1st millennium CE. This research investigates the exchange of glass beads between Guishan, eastern Taiwan and Southeast Asia, by analysing the styles, chemical composition and microstructure of 64 glass beads from Guishan, using SEM-EDS, EPMA and LA-ICP-MS. The findings suggest that beads with an m-Na-Al glass and v-Na-Ca composition are the most common, supporting evidence for bead exchange between Guishan and Southeast Asia, originated in South Asia and Western Asia. Furthermore, most m-Na-Al glasses were coloured by copper, and different types of copper-based additives may have been used for different colours, indicating the beads may be derived from multiple production centres or workshops via Southeast Asia. Conversely, the glass bead compositions suggest that glass bead exchange between other contemporary sites in Taiwan is less evident at Guishan, except for one type of yellow glass bead containing bone ash which is different. This bone-ash containing yellow glass at Guishan is firstly identified in Iron Age Taiwan as well as around the South China Sea region. Its counterparts are also found from archaeological sites in southeastern and coastal eastern Taiwan, which might indicate small scale glass bead exchange. This evidence together suggests a dynamic glass bead exchange network between Guishan, eastern Taiwan, Southeast Asia and beyond.\n\nThe status of glass-bead manufacturing in northern China is undergoing rapid change due to the development of the plastic-bead industry. Several manufacturing plants, including the large Beijing Glass Ware Factory, are no longer making beads and several other plants are contemplating changes. The variety of domestic glass beads available for purchase today would indicate a greater number of manufacturing sites than are mentioned in the popular literature.\n\nArchaeological research has revealed a long history of glass bead exchange and use in Taiwan, yet it has seldom been discussed in the literature. This paper provides an introduction to this exchange from the Iron Age (ca. late 1st millennium BC - mid-2nd millennium AD) to the early modern period (ca. AD 1600-1900) by revisiting the archaeological and historical records. It is suggested that changes in bead styles and chemical compositions over time reveal the transition of bead supply in Taiwan, which further reflects two broad phases of bead trade: Phase I) the earlier involvement of Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific bead exchange (1st millennium AD) and Phase II) the later cultural and economic contacts between the indigenous people, Chinese merchants, and Europeans (2nd millennium AD).\n\nThis paper addresses two issues. First, why did West Asian pottery was need in China, starting from the 9th century, when China was already the leading ceramic making country of the world? Why the 12th-14th centuries saw many more Middle Easterners visiting and residing in China, yet imported West Asian ceramics were scarcer in China than two centuries earlier. In the conclusion it is argued that by 1200 AD or so, West Asians in China had undergone a process of cultural naturalization that may have caused them to be less interested in the manufactured products of their homeland.\n\nThe earliest Chinese beads and pendants were composed of faience and appeared during the early Western Zhou period, around the 11th Century B.C. True glass began to be made about the time of the Spring and Autumn period (771-467 B.C.). An amazing variety of beautiful “dragonfly-eye beads” appeared in China during the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.), but these were imported and not local products. The complex eye beads were replaced during the Han dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 220) by small, plain glass beads generally intended to be strung together. Small glass stringing beads as well as other forms continued in use in subsequent dynasties, as did various types of pendants. During the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), glass was used to produce beautiful imitation jade objects including fanciful compound pendants.\n\nFascinating and diverse beadworking traditions have flourished in Asia for more than 1000 years, with the preponderance of surviving specimens dating to the 19th and 20th centuries. Based on a lecture presented at the Third International Bead Conference in Washington , D.C., in 1995, this article introduces Asian beadwork as a fruitful topic of inquiry for bead specialists. Representative examples produced in the last millennium by various cultures in South Asia, mainland and island Southeast Asia and East Asia are shown and discussed. Although they certainly testify to the material wealth of their makers, in many cases these pieces also carry spiritual implications. As the study of Asian beadwork is still in its infancy, it is hoped that this article will inspire others to conduct further research on the subject .\n\nFascinating and diverse beadworking traditions have flourished in Asia for more than 1000 years, with the preponderance of surviving specimens dating to the 19th and 20th centuries.

In 2016, a large number of glass beads were unearthed from the 40 tombs excavated on this site. In this study we determined the chemical compositions and manufacturing technology of bodies and decorations of twelve glass beads from the M5 tomb of Bizili by using LA-ICP-AES, EDXRF, Raman Spectrometry, and SR-μCT. The chemical compositions of the beads were all Na 2 O-CaO-SiO 2 , with plant ash mainly used as a flux. Lead antimonate and lead stannate were used as the opacifying agents. We detected elevated levels of boron and high levels of phosphorus in some beads: this is discussed in the context of the type of flux used and the possible use of a P-rich opacifier. Some of the beads with high contents of aluminum may potentially come from Pakistan. In terms of manufacturing technology, the craftsmen made 'eye' beads in different ways and also trail decorated beads."
