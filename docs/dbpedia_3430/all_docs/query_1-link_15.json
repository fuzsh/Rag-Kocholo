Some highlights of objects selected for the initial pilot include Drottningholm Palace, the Chinese Pavilion, and Västra Stenby Church. Next steps discussed are expanding tourism uses as well as improving object descriptions, geo-coordinates, and Creative Commons licensing.\n\nEditor's Notes\n\nWe think Google’s Field trip app is a fun and effective way to share and engage people with cultural heritage, with the app reaching over a million users globally to date. While several apps and web services already use cultural heritage data from SwNHB’s databases, we are happy to contribute to an app focused on tourists for the first time. What’s more, it’s also a beneficial partnership: networks help us find partners in other sectors such as commercial and creative businesses and offer the potential for future collaborative projects in the cultural sector. For us, the bottom line is to try to support and stimulate the widest possible use and re-use of digitised cultural heritage. Joining Google’s Field Trip provides an important step forward in that journey.\n\nWe handpicked a selection of historic places and buildings for Google’s Field Trip app that not only met the criteria for good quality data, but are also easily accessible for visitors and have obvious appeal for tourists. The pilot highlights the importance of providing both high resolution images with open licenses and good metadata. Specifically: Tourism-relevant theme: objects related to architecture (historical buildings, monuments), unique urban and nature landscapes, archaeological sites * High-quality image(s) * Narrative object description –interesting facts about the place or object should be presented in a story-telling style. This description can be in either the local language or in English.* Exact geo-coordinates* Freely Reusable content (Public Domain or CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA) Luckily, SwNHB has plenty of photographs that are free to re-use, for example images by photographer Bengt A Lundberg. We searched for objects with photographs by him and then picked out (manually) buildings that had good descriptions of the history of the buildings. We used the database &amp;quot;Bebyggelseregistret&amp;quot; (detta kan du säkert freestyla om, Jonas :-) Our final list for the pilot project consisted of 29 buildings in different parts of Sweden. One of them was Drottningholms slott which is also a world heritage site, but there are also some lesser known places such as the cottage where Carl Linnaeus was born. Challanges with scaling content: Many objects in our databases did not qualify for the app because the descriptions were not narrative enough - the texts are meant for heritage professionals and are not very accessible for the general public.\n\nDrottningholm Slott/Drottningholm Palace (Stockholm, Uppland) Drottningholm Palace in Stockholm is on UNESCO&amp;apos;s World Heritage list and is the most well-preserved royal castle built in the 1600s in Sweden. The very first castle building was built by Johan III in the 1570s for his wife, Queen Catherine Jagelonica. Queen Hedvig Eleonora bought the castle in 1661 but on New Year&amp;apos;s Eve the same year the building was destroyed in a fire. She hired architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder to design a new castle, and the construction work was completed 37 years later, in 1699. Nicodemus Tessin the Younger continued to work on the castle&amp;apos;s interiors after his father&amp;apos;s death, as well as on the installation of the park. The castle has been renovated on a regular basis over the past 400 years. The palace is the permanent residence of the King and Queen of Sweden. A large part of the palace and grounds including the exotic Chinese Pavilion and palace gardens, are open to the public all year round.\n\nKina Slott/The Chinese Pavilion(Stockholm, Uppland) This Chinese-inspired wooden castle was a birthday gift from King Adolf Fredrik to Queen Lovisa Ulrika and is located within the Drottningholm Palace grounds in Stockholm. With The Swedish East India Company&amp;apos;s trade relations during the 1700s, the interest in Chinese and Japanese art and culture grew tremendously and became very fashionable in Europe.\n\nVästra Stenby kyrka/Västra Stenby Church (Motala, Östergötland)According to the legend, Saint Bridget used to spend the night in the tower room of the original church building when she was traveling between Ulfåsa and Vadstena. In 2003, during an archaeological analysis of the deposited layers of dirt in tower room, they found a silver coin from the 1200s and a dendrochronological dating of the timber from the preserved tower indicated that the timber was felled around 1212. The new church was built in 1811-1812 in neoclassical style, and the tower is the only part remaining from the old church.\n\nAbout the Swedish National Heritage Board (SwNHB): Our mission is to facilitate the preservation, development and use of cultural heritage in Sweden. Through our national aggregator, SOCH (Swedish Open Cultural Heritage), the Swedish National Heritage Board is one of the largest suppliers of free cultural heritage data to Europeana. We are also looking for ways to connect cultural heritage data to tourism, and how to support the tourism sector with digital content. For the Google Field trip pilot project with Europeana, we further explored how to give people access to cultural heritage that is as usable as possible, contains good quality data and is enriched with context."
