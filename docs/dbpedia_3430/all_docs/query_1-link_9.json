It was secretly constructed in Stockholm and transported in pieces to Drottningholm, where it was reassembled. Ten years later the fragile wooden pavilion was replaced by the current group of four small pavilions, magnificently designed by Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz in Rococo style with elements that were considered typically Chinese.
