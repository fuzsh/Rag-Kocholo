MICHAEL O'LEARY / THE HERALD By Gale Fiege Herald Writer EVERETT — The USS Nim- itz tied up to its pier Monday morning at Everett Naval Sta- tion following a 70-day trip that included an exercise with other Pacific Rim countries. The aircraft carrier Nimitz, homeported in Everett, delivered its crew back to friends and family who had not seen them for more than two months. “I can’t overemphasize how proud I am of each and every one of the sailors aboard,” said Capt. Jeff Ruth, Nimitz command- ing officer, in a statement. “Their professionalism and stellar per- formance led 22 nations through this demanding exercise.” Since leaving Everett in June, the Nimitz crew completed a number of inspections and certifications that monitored the ship’s ability to overcome various emergency sce- narios, which then led up to the biennial “Rim of the Pacific” exer- cise, Ruth said.

The cause of her death has not been released. She was a staple of night- clubs and television from the 1950s — when female comics were rare indeed — until her retirement in 2002. Diller built her stand-up act around the persona of the comer-cutting housewife (\"I bury a lot of my ironing in the backyard”) with bizarre looks, a wardrobe to match (by “Omar of Omaha”) and a husband named “Fang.” Wrote Time magazine in 1961: \"Onstage comes something that, by its own description, looks like a sackful of doorknobs. With hair dyed by Alcoa, pipe- cleaner limbs and knees just missing one another when the feet are wide apart, this is not Princess Volupine. It is Phyllis Diller, the poor man’s Auntie Mame, only success- ful female among the New Wave comedians and one of the few women funny and tough enough to belt out a ‘standup’ act of one-line gags.” She inspired a generation of female comics, including Joan Rivers, Ellen DeGeneres and Whoopi Goldberg. Diller described herself as “one of those life-of-the- party types,” in an interview in 1965. “You’ll find them in every bridge club, at every country club. People invited me to parties only because they knew I would supply some laughs. They still do.” She didn’t get into comedy until she was nearly 40, after her first husband, Sherwood Diller, prodded her to give up a successful career as an advertising and radio writer. Through it all, she was also a busy mother. \"We had five kids at the time. I don’t how he thought we’d handle that,” she told the AP in 2006. ASSOCIATED PRESS /1 999 Phyllis Diller, the housewife turned humorist, inspired a generation of female comics. A Chicago Tribune col- umnist, describing her appearance at a nightspot there in 1958, noted she was from San Francisco, hailed her as \"the weirdest, wild- est yet” — and made sure to mention her five youngsters. Her husband managed her career until the couple’s 25-year marriage fell apart in the 1960s. Shortly after her divorce she married entertainer Warde Donovan, but they separated within months. Through both marriages and other relationships, the foibles of “Fang” remained an integral part of her act. “Fang is permanent in the act, of course,” she once said. “Don’t confuse him with my real husbands. They’re temporary.” She appeared in movies, including “Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number” and “Eight on the Lam” with Bob Hope. In 1966-67, she was the star of an ABC sitcom about a society family . trying to stave off bankruptcy, \"The Pruitts of Southampton.” In 1968, she was host of a vari- ety series, \"The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show.” Although she could be serious during interviews, sooner or later a joke would pop out, often as not fol- lowed by that outrageous “AH-HHAAAAAAAAAAAA- HA-HA-HA!” laugh. “It’s my real laugh,” she once said. “It’s in the family. When I was a kid my father called me the laughing hyena.” Diller is survived by her two children, four grandchildren and a great- granddaughter.

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., attend a town hall at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., on Monday, TOPEKA — A freshman congressman from Kansas has apologized for going skinny-dipping in the Sea of Galilee during a fact-finding trip to Israel last summer. Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kan., said late Sun- day he was “incredibly remorseful that I have caused embarrassment to my constituents” for a \"momentary lapse of judgment” that resulted in his jump- ing into the water without his clothes on during the August 2011 trip to Israel. Politico reported that he stripped during a late-night swim with other lawmakers, congressional spouses and staffers. The Sea of Galilee is a lake in northern Israel. Scripture says Jesus walked on water there. GOP aides denied Politico’s report that the FBI looked into the incident. The trip was paid for by the American Israel Edu- cational Foundation. D.C.: New Mars mission Point-counterpoint by candidates Obama defends tenor of his campaign; Romney stays in attack mode By Jim Kuhnhenn and Charles Babington Associated Press WASHINGTON— Denounced by his Republican rival for divi- siveness, President Barack Obama on Monday defended the tone of his campaign and insisted it’s actually Mitt Rom- ney’s ads that are “patently false.” But Obama did distance himself from a particularly provocative negative ad by a political group that supports him. Obama alsojoinedthecascade of criticism from both parties for comments on rape and abortion by a Republican Senate can- didate in Missouri, using that new controversy to draw sharp distinctions between his views on women’s health issues and those of Republicans. Obama turned the day into a long-distance point-counter- point debate with his opponent. He made a surprise visit to the White House briefing room and took questions from four report- ers, the most he has taken from the national press corps in two months, dealing to an extent with complaints about his inaccessibility. The flap over rape-and- abortion remarks by Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri gave Obama a chance to make a direct appeal to women, who both campaigns say make up a majority of unde- cided voters. At issue was Akin’s answer in an interview that aired Sunday that women’s bodies can pre- vent pregnancies in \"a legitimate rape” and that conception is rare in such cases. Akin later said he misspoke and apologized, but he said he would not get out of the race despite such urging from several prominent fellow Republicans. As for the tone of the President Barack Obama makes a suprise visit Monday to the White House briefing room to defend the tone of his campaign. campaign, Obama declared that it was important to draw attention to major differences with Romney, but he said his criticism has never been “out of bounds.” Still, he distanced himself from an ad by the pro-Obama Priorities USA Action super political action committee, which is run by former Obama White House aides. That ad pointedly notes the death of the wife of a steelworker whose company had been taken over by a group of partners that included Bain Capital, the pri- vate equity firm that Romney cofounded. “I don’t think that Governor Romney is somehow responsi- ble for the death of the woman that was portrayed in that ad,” Obama said. But he added that he did not approve or produce the ad and said it had had only a brief airing on television. Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, made their first appearance together in New Hampshire after a week of vigor- ous campaigning separately. The Republicans sus- tained their criticism Monday, leveling new claims of duplic- ity in Obama’s TV ads before about 3,000 friendly people in Manchester. “It seems that the first victim of an Obama campaign is the truth,” Romney said. Asked by a woman about Obama campaign “lies” that claim the GOP ticket would raise taxes, Romney said, “All we’ve heard so far is one attack after another.” “I will not raise taxes on anyone,” Romney said. “Mr. President, stop saying some- thing that’s not the truth.” In his news conference, Obama countered, saying his speeches and the ads run by his re-election campaign have focused accurately on substan- tive issues such as taxes and spending. By contrast, he said Romney has aired “patently false” claims that the president is “gutting” welfare’s work requirement. Obama also defended ads criticizing Romney’s refusal to release more than two years’ worth of tax returns. He said those seeking the White House must know their life is an “open book.” Obama said he has “sharp differences” with Romney on major issues and that those are fair game for tough ads. Even so, he added, “Nobody accused Mr. Romney of being a felon,” as some Republicans have suggested of Obama.

Romney also weighed in, call- ing Akin’s comments on rape “insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong.” A number of other Republi- cans decried the remarks as well and at least two Republican sen- ators called on Akin to drop out of the race.

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., attend a town hall at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., on Monday, Point-counterpoint by candidates Obama defends tenor of his campaign; Romney stays in attack mode By Jim Kuhnhenn and Charles Babington Associated Press WASHINGTON — Denounced by his Republican rival for divi- siveness, President Barack Obama on Monday defended the tone of his campaign and insisted it’s actually Mitt Rom- ney’s ads that are “patently false.” But Obama did distance himself from a particularly provocative negative ad by a political group that supports him. Obamaalso joined thecascade of criticism from both parties for comments on rape and abortion by a Republican Senate can- didate in Missouri, using that new controversy to draw sharp distinctions between his views on women’s health issues and those of Republicans. Obama turned the day into a long-distance point-counter- point debate with his opponent. He made a surprise visit to the White House briefing room and took questions from four report- ers, the most he has taken from the national press corps in two months, dealing to an extent with complaints about his inaccessibility. The flap over rape-and- abortion remarks by Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri gave Obama a chance to make a direct appeal to women, who both campaigns say make up a majority of unde- cided voters. At issue was Akin’s answer in an interview that aired Sunday that women’s bodies can pre- vent pregnancies in “a legitimate rape” and that conception is rare in such cases. Akin later said he misspoke and apologized, but he said he would not get out of the race despite such urging from several prominent fellow Republicans. As for the tone of the President Barack Obama makes a suprise visit Monday to the White House briefing room to defend the tone of his campaign. campaign, Obama declared that it was important to draw attention to major differences with Romney, but he said his criticism has never been “out of bounds.” Still, he distanced himself from an ad by the pro-Obama Priorities USA Action super political action committee, which is run by former Obama White House aides. That ad pointedly notes the death of the wife of a steelworker whose company had been taken over by a group of partners that included Bain Capital, the pri- vate equity firm that Romney cofounded. “I don’t think that Governor Romney is somehow responsi- ble for the death of the woman that was portrayed in that ad,” Obama said. But he added that he did not approve or produce the ad and said it had had only a brief airing on television. Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, made their first appearance together in New Hampshire after a week of vigor- ous campaigning separately. The Republicans sus- tained their criticism Monday, leveling new claims of duplic- ity in Obama’s TV ads before about 3,000 friendly people in Manchester. \"It seems that the first victim of an Obama campaign is the truth,\" Romney said. Asked by a woman about Obama campaign “lies” that claim the GOP ticket would raise taxes, Romney said, “All we’ve heard so far is one attack after another.” “I will not raise taxes on anyone,” Romney said. “Mr. President, stop saying some- thing that’s not the truth.” In his news conference, Obama countered, saying his speeches and the ads mn by his re-election campaign have focused accurately on substan- tive issues such as taxes and spending. By contrast, he said Romney has aired “patendy false” claims that the president is “gutting” welfare’s work requirement. Obama also defended ads criticizing Romney’s refusal to release more than two years’ worth of tax returns. He said those seeking the White House must know their life is an “open book.” Obama said he has “sharp differences\" with Romney on major issues and that those are fair game for tough ads.

AROUND THE WORLD Sierra Leone: Cholera strikes Court: Alabama can’t check student immigration (Alabama's law) significantly deters undocumented children from enrolling in and attending school .... — The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals By Bill Barrow and Jay Reeves Associated Press ATLANTA — Part of Alabama’s immigration law that ordered public schools to check the citi- zenship status of new students was ruled unconstitutional Monday by a federal appeals court that also said police in that state and Georgia can demand papers from criminal suspects they have detained. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Ala- bama schools provision wrongly singles out children who are in the country illegally. Alabama was the only state that passed such a requirement and the 1 1th Circuit previously had blocked that part of the law from being enforced. Judges said fear of the law “sig- nificantly deters undocumented children from enrolling in and attending school ....” Both private gfoups and the Obama administration filed lawsuits to block the law consid- ered the toughest in the country. The court, however, upheld parts of immigration laws in Alabama and Georgia allowing law enforcement to check docu- ments for people they stop. And the panel left in place an injunction that blocks a section L of the Georgia law that allows for the prosecution of people who knowingly harbor or transport an illegal immigrant during the commission of a crime. In Alabama, the judges sided with opponents of the law on other key points, including chal- lenges to sections that made it illegal to harbor illegal immi- grants; made it a crime for illegal immigrants to seek work; and made it a state crime for people in the country illegally not to Have registration documents. The decisions follow a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding parts of a similar law in Arizona. The Adanta-based court referenced that decision in its opinion to lift the injunc- tion on the suspect verification section. Georgia, and Alabama are among se^feral states that have enacted anti-illegal immigration laws in recent years. Proponents have argued they are necessary in part because of alleged fed- eral inaction. Opponents have argued that many of the laws are punitive to immigrants and that policy must be steered by the federal government. Omar Jadwat, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney involved in challenging similar laws in Alabama and Georgia, said the judges stuck down the schools provision “in pretty robust terms” and effectively opposed the sponsors’ stated idea of forcing illegal immigrants to “self-deport” by making then- lives too difficult. \"The original idea behind the law, that these provisions would all work together to allow the states to aggressively identify and prosecute undocumented residents, has been shot down,” said Jadwat. Alabama Republican Gov. Robert Bentley disagreed, saying the court upheld the “essence” of the law. “The core of Alabama’s immi- gration law remains that if you live or work in the state, you should do so legally,” said Bent- ley, who signed the measure. “It is time now to move past court battles and focus on enforce- ment of Alabama’s law.\" School officials said many Hispanic parents quit sending their children to class immedi- ately after Bentley signed the law, and some families left the state in fear. Local education systems have said many chil- dren returned to class, and some immigrant families moved back to Alabama after courts blocked many provisions in the law. In a statement, Georgia Attor- ney General Sam Olens said he was generally pleased with the ruling for his state but disagreed with the court on the section dealing with transporting ille- gal immigrant that is still being blocked. Jadwat said the organization will continue to challenge so- called “show-me-your-papers” provisions of the state immigra- tion laws. An outbreak of cholera in West Africa has infected more than 13,000 people and killed at least 258 people in Sierra Leone and Guinea, authorities said as they appealed for international assistance. Sierra Leone’s Minister of Health and San- itation, Zainab Hawa Bangura, said that in the capital, Freetown, there have been about 100 deaths during the past month. That brings the total to at least 176 dead in Sierra Leone, while 82 deaths have been reported in neighboring Guinea. Venezuela: Prison violence More than 20 people were killed dur- ing a prison riot as two groups of inmates waged a gunbattle inside the peniten- tiary, officials said Monday.

It was the latest in a series of bloody clashes that have flared in Venezuela’s overcrowded prisons. Syria: Gov’t, attacks kill 100 Government forces pummeled the bat- tered city of Aleppo with airstrikes and tanks and shelled parts of Damascus and southern Syria on Monday, killing at least 100 people during a major Muslim holi- day, rights groups and activists said. The violence escalated dramatically after a one-day lull Sunday, the start of the three- day Eid al-Fitr holiday which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. The renewed fighting showed President Bashar Assad’s regime is not letting up on its drive to quell the 17-month-old uprising out of respect for the occasion. From Herald news services 7 Two cents' worth \"When bright young minds can't afford col- lege, America pays the price.\" — Arthur Ashe, tennis player, 1943-1993 A4 I HERALD I WWW.HERALDNET.COM/BUSINESS I TUESDAY, 08.21.12 Studies show degree’s value College graduates have an easier time finding work, one study finds, but another says the debt that some incur is hobbling families and hitting low-income students harder. ByJustemPope Associated Press Two new studies offer emphatic answers to much-discussed ques- tions about higher education: Yes, a college degree is worth it, but yes, it’s the middle-class that’s getting particularly squeezed with student debt in the pursuit of one. Both studies make persuasive cases, though each could be mis- understood without important context. The first, released last week by the Lumina Foundation and Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce, seems to thoroughly demolish the idea that the Great Recession diminished the value of a college degree. Yes, recent college grads have struggled more than usual to find jobs matching their training. But overall, even as unemployment was rising past 10 percent, the authors found the economy actu- ally added 200,000 jobs for workers with a bachelor’s degree. Since the recovery began, it’s created 2 million more. Just as there wasn’t really a recession, at least in terms of job creation, for those with college degrees, there hasn’t been a recov- ery for those without them. Nearly 6 million high-school-only jobs have been lost since the downturn began, and they are still declining even in the recovery. That recovery may well never come if you have no college at all (though people with some college have done reasonably well of late). “This is the clearest information that we have seen to date about the advantage of having college-level skills in the employment market,” said Lumina’s president and CEO Jamie Merisotis. “Since the recovery started two years ago we’ve seen a real acceleration. The gap between those with a college credential and those without one is growing.” The unemployment rate for all four-year graduates is 4.5 percent. For recent graduates, it's 6.8 per- cent. For recent graduates trying to work with only a high school diploma, it’s nearly 24 percent. In construction and manu- facturing, which accounted for two-thirds of all Great Recession job losses, virtually all of the hiring during the recovery has targeted people with bachelor’s or at least associate’s degrees.

BRIEFLY For 4th year, ’94 Honda Accord most stolen car Honda’s 1994 Accord was the most frequently stolen car in the United States in 2011 for the fourth straight year as the vehicle’s popularity and lack of security features made it a favorite among thieves. Last year, 7,596 Accords from the 1994 model year were sto- len, according the National Insurance Crime Bureau. The 1998 Honda Civic was the sec- ond most-stolen car, the trade group said Monday. “They’re actually stealing the older cars because the safety features that the newer cars have, they’re not there,” said Joe Brosius, a retired Tempe, Ariz., police officer who heads the International Associa- tion of Auto Theft Investigators. U.S. airline stocks rise on airfare increases Shares of U.S. airlines gained Monday following a successful attempt to raise fares to cover the rising cost of fuel. South- west Airlines Co. raised fares Friday on short routes by $10 per round trip, and several large airlines quickly matched the increase. The fare hike applied to flights of less than 500 miles each way, or about one-third of Southwest’s routes. Just two days earlier, Delta Air Lines dropped a fare increase of up to $10 per round trip because other airlines didn’t follow suit. Southwest carries a lot of influ- ence in fare sales because while other airlines fly more miles, Southwest carries more pas- sengers within the U.S. titan anyone. Many attempts to raise prices don’t stick because Southwest doesn’t play along. The really big Apple With a market capitalization of $623 billion, Apple is now the world's most valuable company ever.

In inflation-adjusted dollars, the software giant was worth about $850 billion on Dec. 30, 1999. Microsoft is now worth $257 billion. Analysts believe Apple’s stock has room to grow. The average price target of 38 analysts polled by FactSet is $745.80. Despite the surge, Apple’s stock is not particularly expensive compared to its earnings for the last twelve months. The compa- ny’s “price-to-eamings ratio” is 15.6, compared to 16. 1 for the S&P 500 overall. That suggests inves- tors, unlike analysts, don’t believe the company can grow its profits much from current levels. By contrast, Microsoft had a price-to-eamings ratio of 83 at the 1999 peak.

The new program will last a month longer than last year’s and will include more items than the toys and electronics featured last year. The world’s largest retailer says its mostly lower-income shop- pers are still having a hard time stretching their dollars to the next paycheck. A little more than three years into the economic recov- ery, shoppers, particularly in the low-income bracket, remain particularly hard hit by unemploy- ment and other financial worries. The return of layaway is also occurring after the discounter, based in Bentonville, Ark., saw its sales momentum slow at its namesake U.S. business accord- ing to its latest quarterly results, though business has rebounded from a more than two-year slump. Wal-Mart says its layaway pro- gram, which will begin Sept. 16 and end Dec. 14, will give shop- pers an extra month to spread their payments. The list of items that will be available for layaway has broad- ened and goes beyond last year’s toys and electronics. Shoppers will be able to set aside small home appliances and select sporting goods such as trampolines and large exercise equipment. Wal-Mart is still requiring that each item is priced at $15 or more, and the total layaway purchase must be at least $50. A down payment of 10 percent or $10, whichever is greater, is required and will be applied to the purchase, the same terms as last year. There’s also a refundable $15 fee to open an account. If the order is cancelled or not paid in full, the $15 is not refunded.

Apple is demanding Samsung pay it $2.5 billion and pull its most popular smart- phones and computer tablets from the U.S. market after accus- ing the South Korean company of “ripping off” its iPhone and iPad technology. Samsung, in turn, is demanding Apple pay it $399 million for allegedly using Samsung’s technology without proper payments in making the iconic iPhones and iPads.

The amusement park company did not give a reason for the change, which takes effect next year. The Wild Safari portion of the park also will end its 2012 season a month early, on Sept. 30, except for previously sched- uled VIP tours, park officials said. Park officials said details about how the animal sanctuary will operate in the future will be made public Aug. 30. Six Flags currently lets visitors ei- ther drive their own vehicles through its 350-acre animal sanctuary or take guided bus tours. Since opening in 1974, the Wild Safari animal park at She Flags has had more than 10 mil- lion drive-through visitors.

But there are 15 percent fewer jobs for those with only high school in manufacturing, and 25 percent fewer in construction. Overall, the number of jobs for people with at least some college is growing at a healthy 4 percent annually. But the growth rate for high school-only jobs is zero and those jobs remain 10 percent below their pre-recession levels. Still, there is another variable needed to answer the question, “Is college worth it?” That’s the cost of college, and that has been rising rapidly. On average, the answer is pretty clear: A degree is worth it, to the tune of $1.3 million in addi- tional lifetime earnings, a very good return on even an expensive degree. . But, as Georgetown’s Anthony Camevale acknowledges, there’s no such thing as a generic bachelor’s These kids, even though they have pursued the American dream, they're starting their careers with hugely unequal amounts of student loan debt. Jason Houle, University of Wisconsin demographer degree. Where you study, and what you study, matter a lot. “What people shouldn’t take away from this is you can get any old BA or AA,” Carnevale said. “They need to get past that. They need to think about which degree and what it will it do for them.\" As many as one in five under- graduate degrees — for instance in counseling, at least for those who don’t go on to get a master’s — pro- duce average earnings no greater than those of a high school graduate. Many types of AA degrees produce better average earnings than some bachelors. The research paints a powerful portrait of an economy where more education is better, but the kind of education matters too. The second study, being pre- sented Monday at the American Sociological Association’s annual meeting in Denver, highlights the particular burden of growing stu- dent debt on middle-class families, who may be too well off to qualify for financial aid like Pell Grants that target students from the poor- est families. In the study, University of Wis- consin demographer Jason Houle finds students from middle- income families rack up more student loan debt on average than others: not only students from high-income families — no sur- prise — but also than those from low-income families. About 40 percent of students left school with debt, and the average was about $22,000. But students from families earning between $40,000 and $59,000 were saddled with $6,000 more on average than peers from families earning less than $40,000. Students from the next tier — family income between $60,000 and $99,000 — had $4,000 more in debt than their lowest- income peers. One reason is that federal grant aid targets the lowest-income stu- dents — roughly 90 percent who receive Pell Grants come from families earning under $50,000. Lower-income students may be also be more debt-averse, causing those who go to college to choose cheaper schools. But the figures reinforce the struggles of families just above the bottom level to afford even the average public 4-year college, with tuition plus room and board (before factoring in financial aid) now run- ning more than $17,000 peryear. “These kids, even though they have pursued the American dream, they’re starting their careers with hugely unequal amounts of stu- dent loan debt,” Houle said. “That could be the difference of a kid who can take an unpaid internship that would put their career on an upward trajectory.” The caveat with Houle’s study is that he looked only at people who attended some college. As Houle acknowledges, while those from low-income fami- lies who go to college may get out of school with less debt, poorer students are still less likely to go in the first place. If the George- town survey shows anything, it’s that graduating with a moder- ate amount of student debt is still much better than not graduating. So the lesson isn’t necessarily that the lowest-income students are better off overall: Just 8 percent of those from families in the bot- tom income quartile (under about $36,000) have earned a bachelor’s degree by age 24, compared to more than 82 percent from the top quartile (roughly $108,000). But Houle’s study does illustrate the serious bind of families above the very bottom (earning between roughly $36,000 and $65,000). Just 17 percent of those students earn a degree by 24, and they’re racking up more debt in the process.

But there are 15 percent fewer jobs for those with only high school in manufacturing, and 25 percent fewer in construction. Overall, the number of jobs for people with at least some college is growing at a healthy 4 percent annually. But the growth rate for high school-only jobs is zero and those jobs remain 10 percent below their pre-recession levels. Still, there is another variable needed to answer the question, “Is college worth it?” That’s the cost of college, and that has been rising rapidly. On average, the answer is pretty clear: A degree is worth it, to the tune of $1.3 million in addi- tional lifetime earnings, a very good return on even an expensive degree. But, as Georgetown’s Anthony Camevale acknowledges, there’s no such thing as a generic bachelor’s These kids, even though they have pursued the American dream, they're starting their careers with hugely unequal amounts of student loan debt. Jason Houle, University of Wisconsin demographer degree. Where you study, and what you study, matter a lot. “What people shouldn’t take away from this is you can get any old BA or AA,” Camevale said. “They need to get past that. They need to think about which degree and what it will it do for them.” As many as one in five under- graduate degrees — for instance in counseling, at least for those who don’t go on to get a master’s — pro- duce average earnings no greater than those of a high school graduate. Many types of AA degrees produce better average earnings than some bachelors. The research paints a powerful portrait of an economy where more education is better, but the kind of education matters too. The second study, being pre- sented Monday at the American Sociological Association’s annual meeting in Denver, highlights the particular burden of growing stu- dent debt on middle-class families, who may be too well off to qualify for financial aid like Pell Grants that target students from the poor- est families. In the study, University of Wis- consin demographer Jason Houle finds students from middle- income families rack up more student loan debt on average than others: not only students from high-income families — no sur- prise — but also than those from low-income families. About 40 percent of students left school with debt, and the average was about $22,000. But students from families earning between $40,000 and $59,000 were saddled with $6,000 more on average than peers from families earning less than $40,000. Students from the next tier — family income between $60,000 and $99,000 — had $4,000 more in debt than their lowest- income peers. One reason is that federal grant aid targets the lowest-income stu- dents — roughly 90 percent who receive Pell Grants come from families earning under $50,000. Lower-income students may be also be more debt-averse, causing those who go to college to choose cheaper schools. But the figures reinforce the struggles of families just above the bottom level to afford even the average public 4-year college, with tuition plus room and board (before factoring in financial aid) now run- ning more than $17,000 per year. “These kids, even though they have pursued the American dream, they’re starting their careers with hugely unequal amounts of stu- dent loan debt,” Houle said. “That could be the difference of a kid who can take an unpaid internship that would put their career on an upward trajectory.” The caveat with Houle’s study is that he looked only at people who attended some college. As Houle acknowledges, while those from low-income fami- lies who go to college may get out of school with less debt, poorer students are still less likely to go in the first place. If the George- town survey shows anything, it’s that graduating with a moder- ate amount of student debt is still much better than not graduating. So the lesson isn’t necessarily that the lowest-income students are better off overall: Just 8 percent of those from families in the bot- tom income quartile (under about $36,000) have earned a bachelor’s degree by age 24, compared to more than 82 percent from the top quartile (roughly $108,000). But Houle’s study does illustrate the serious bind of families above the very bottom (earning between roughly $36,000 and $65,000). Just 17 percent of those students earn a degree by 24, and they’re racking up more debt in the process.

The pace of the increases has slowed considerably, however. Gas rose 19 cents in the two weeks ended Wednesday. It’s up just 1 penny in the five days since. Gas costs about 26 cents more than a month ago and 14 cents more than a year ago, according to AAA, OPIS and Wright Express. Across the U.S., prices range from a low of $3.43 per gallon in South Carolina to $4.32 in Hawaii. Arizona, Mississippi and New Mex- ico also have average prices below $3.50 per gallon, while California and Illinois are up above the $4 mark. to $199 for the latest Google and Amazon tablets.

Investors have worried about disruption to oil supplies in the Middle East and North Sea. In the U.S., there were problems with refineries and pipelines in the West Coast and Midwest, including a fire in California. Seasonal factors are also at play: Summer blends of gas cost more and demand goes up as families go on vacation. Gas hit an all-time high of $4.11 per gallon in July 2008. But a plunge in oil prices knocked it down to $3.69 by the end of August.

A stop in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, meant that the Nimitz crew played host to more than 500 visitors as part of a public aware- ness campaign. The ship also hosted the Pacific Rim exercise closing reception, with nearly 2,000 people in attendance in the ship’s hangar bays. Additionally, the Nimitz hosted its first “Lt. Cmdr. Regina Pearl Mills Leader- ship Award” presentation ceremony by her husband, Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Mills. The award went to Aviation Boatswain’s Mate 2nd Class Saleema N. Massey while in port at Naval Air Station North Island on Aug. 9. Mills served aboard the Nimitz as the Navy’s first female aircraft handler prior to being struck and killed by a vehicle when she stopped to assist others in a traffic collision Jan. 23 near Bremerton.

Class From Page A1 mid-2014. That same law requires WSU to offer mechanical engineer- ing program now and, in December, to provide leg- islators a road map for the center’s future operations. \"I think it’s a huge step for higher education in our state,” WSU president Elson Floyd said. “It’s been two decades in which we’ve been talking about the need for access to higher education in Everett and Snohomish County. Now it’s becoming a reality.” While lawmakers provided funding for the students, they didn’t provide a site for a branch campus, money to construct buildings or dol- lars to install a flagpole to fly the crimson and gray. That’s not curtailing the optimism of those involved in cementing WSU’s pres- ence in the community. “It’s a start. It’s extremely gratifying,” said state Rep. Mike Sells, D-Everett, a member of the House Higher Education Com- mittee where the 2011 law underwent many revisions before emerging. “I’d like to predict it moves us forward to a fuller delivery of four- year degrees.” Snohomish County Exec- utive Aaron Reardon, who’s pushed for an independent polytechnic university, didn’t think too highly of the law. He viewed it as the smallest possible step toward getting a four-year university. Since then, he’s gained confidence Floyd will move swiftly to enlarge WSU’s presence. “What I get from them is a real sense of commitment. They have a larger vision of WSU up here,” he said. “They are not just plant- ing the flag. This is not just symbolism.” With the transition far from complete, WSU inten- tionally kept a low profile Monday. No pennants, no flags, no Cougar colors at all in or around the classrooms Jensen From Page A1 donated to the Cascade High School’s annual food drive in his memory to help hard- pressed families celebrate the holidays. Behind the scenes, nearly two dozen volunteers give Don and Jan Jensen the resolve to organize a large- scale event each year to raise more money to help their community. “We could never find the strength to do this without them,” Don Jensen said. Jan Jensen was a teacher at Eisenhower Middle School for more than 20 years; Don Jensen, a counselor at Cas- cade for 18. Their daughter, Megan, a year younger than her brother, is now a doc- torate student in California. They made a lot of friends along the way. And those friends are will- ing to go to great lengths to help. Consider one donation that was supposed to be part of this year’s silent auction but will be marketed else- where to fetch the highest price for scholarships. The Jensens are in posses- in Gray Wolf Hall where the University Center partners hold classes. “We did not want to engage in any fanfare. I don’t want people to believe we are overstepping our bounds legislatively,” Floyd said. EvCC Resident David Beyer said the transfer of power is “going very posi- tively and productively. Things are moving forward.” And he credited WSU’s arrival with inciting a spike in enrollment in pre-engineer- ing classes. The community college hired an instructor to deal with the increase and for the first time is offering courses at night. Meanwhile, the eventual transfer of power is not scar- ing away University Center partners, as some worried, though St. Martin’s Univer- sity did drop its engineering classes this year. WSU’s arrival is not the reason, a St. Martin’s spokes- woman said. Rather, the private college is refocus- ing attention to its Lacey campus where a new engi- neering building is under construction. Officially, the Washington State University era at EvCC began 20 minutes later than planned. WSU intended its 11:10 a.m. materials science course in Everett to be tele- vised to students in Pullman as well but a glitch in con- necting the two sites caused the delay. TVventy-five students, all juniors, are in the program. About half are transfers from Everett Community College with the rest coming from around the Puget Sound region. Nathan Oppie, 31, of Everett, completed his pre- engineering courses at Edmonds Community Col- lege. While blazing a trail is nice, earning his degree near home rather than at a university in Seattle is even better. “I heard about it last year. I didn’t think it would hap- pen,” he said. “I’m glad it did.” Jerry Cornfield: 360-352- 8623; jcomfield@heraldnet. com.
