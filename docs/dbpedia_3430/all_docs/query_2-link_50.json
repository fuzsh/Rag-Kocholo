        "text": "Drottningholm Palace (Drottningholm Slott) is a well-preserved royal palace in Sweden, renowned as the ‘Versailles of Scandinavia’.\n\nHistory of Drottningholm Palace\n\nThe first incarnation of Drottningholm Palace was built by King Johan III in the late 16th century. The king built it for his wife, Queen Katarina Jagellonika, hence its name meaning ‘Queen’s Island’. However, this palace was razed to the ground by a fire in 1661 and a new one built in its place in 1662, marking the foundation of the Drottningholm Palace visible today.\n\nIt was the influence of Crown Princess Louisa-Ulrika in the 18th century which can still be felt most keenly. She had Drottningholm Palace renovated in image of Versailles, taking inspiration from the opulence of Louis XV.\n\nDrottningholm Palace Today\n\nSince 1981, Drottningholm Palace has been the home of the current royal family. Parts of the Palace are open to the public and 50 minute guided tours of Drottningholm Palace are included in the ticket price.\n\nAmongst the highlights at Drottningholm Palace are its restored 18th century theatre (the work of Louisa-Ulrika), its gardens, and the Chinese pavilion gifted to Gustav III in 1769.\n\nIn 1991, Drottningholm Palace became a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nGetting to Drottningholm Palace\n\nFrom the centre of Stockholm, the palace is reachable in around 25 minutes by car via Drottningholmsvägen/Route 275 and Route 261. There are also a number of public transport options. From the centre of Drottningholm, the palace is reachable in 2 minutes by car via Malmbacken."
