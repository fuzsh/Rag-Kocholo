The pavilion is currently one of Sweden's Royal Palaces and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\t\n\tThe first building was a simple pavilion with two wings in Chinese style. The pavilion was a surprise gift to the Queen from King Adolf Frederick. Having been built in haste and secrecy, the small castle did not endure the harsh Swedish climate. \n\t\n\tThe second and current structure replaced the old wooden pavilion from 1753. Designed by Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, construction began in 1763 and was completed in 1769 (Wikipedia).\n\t\n\tPanoramic image made by combining 9 individual images in Lightroom.",
