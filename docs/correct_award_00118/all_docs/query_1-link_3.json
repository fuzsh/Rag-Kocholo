        "text": "J.M. Coetzee (born February 9, 1940, Cape Town, South Africa) is a South African novelist, critic, and translator noted for his novels about the effects of colonization. In 2003, he won the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nCoetzee was educated at the University of Cape Town (B.A., 1960; M.A., 1963) and the University of Texas (Ph.D., 1969). An opponent of apartheid, he nevertheless returned to live in South Africa, where he taught English at the University of Cape Town, translated works from the Dutch, and wrote literary criticism. He also held visiting professorships at a number of universities.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nA Study of Writers\n\nDusklands (1974), Coetzee’s first book, contains two novellas united in their exploration of colonization, The Vietnam Project (set in the United States in the late 20th century) and The Narrative of Jacobus Coetzee (set in 18th-century South Africa). In the Heart of the Country (1977; also published as From the Heart of the Country; filmed as Dust, 1986) is a stream-of-consciousness narrative of a Boer madwoman, and Waiting for the Barbarians (1980), set in some undefined borderland, is an examination of the ramifications of colonization. Life & Times of Michael K (1983), which won the Booker Prize, concerns the dilemma of a simple man beset by conditions he can neither comprehend nor control during a civil war in a future South Africa.\n\nCoetzee continued to explore themes of the colonizer and the colonized in Foe (1986), his reworking of Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe. Coetzee’s female narrator comes to new conclusions about power and otherness and ultimately concludes that language can enslave as effectively as can chains. In Age of Iron (1990) Coetzee dealt directly with circumstances in contemporary South Africa, but in The Master of Petersburg (1994) he made reference to 19th-century Russia (particularly to Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s work The Devils); both books treat the subject of literature in society. In 1999, with his novel Disgrace, Coetzee became the first writer to win the Booker Prize twice. After the novel’s publication and an outcry in South Africa, he moved to Australia, where he was granted citizenship in 2006.\n\nThe structure of Coetzee’s Elizabeth Costello (2003), a series of “lessons” (two of which had been published in an earlier volume) in which the eponymous narrator reflects on a variety of topics, puzzled many readers. One reviewer proposed that it be considered “non-nonfiction.” Costello makes a surreal reappearance in Coetzee’s Slow Man (2005), about a recent amputee’s reluctance to accept his condition. Diary of a Bad Year (2007) employs a literally split narrative technique, with the text on the page divided into concurrent storylines, the main story being the musings of an aging South African writer modeled on Coetzee himself. In The Childhood of Jesus (2013), a boy and his guardian scour a dystopian world—from which desire and pleasure have apparently been purged—in search of the boy’s mother. The first in a trilogy, it was followed by The Schooldays of Jesus (2016) and The Death of Jesus (2020)."
