        "text": "J. M. Coetzee is regarded as one of the world’s most brilliant writers. Twice winner of the Booker Prize, Coetzee was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2004. Born in Cape Town, South Africa, Coetzee now lives in Adelaide, South Australia. Many say that the reclusive author left for Australia because of the controversy surrounding Disgrace (1999), a work which won the Booker Prize but which pleased very few in his native South Africa.\n\nWhile the African National Congress denounced Disgrace as racist for depicting the gang rape of a white woman, white South Africans were shocked by what they saw as the novel’s bleak vision of their post-apartheid future. Today, in our deeply polarised times, the novel continues to provoke and disturb its readers, resonating eerily with the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements.\n\nThis masterclass will focus on sex, race, and power in Disgrace, looking in particular at the symmetry between the two rapes – one committed by David Lurie, a conservative white Professor of Romantic Literature, the other a gang rape inflicted on his daughter Lucy. Their relationship is a fraught one. Lucy is a lesbian who has turned her back on the city and on her father’s conventional aspirations for her. The gang rape she suffers, together with the absorption of her land into that of her black neighbour, are shocking enough but even more disturbing is her acceptance of all this as the price she must pay for her country’s unjust history.\n\nCoetzee is on record as saying that South African literature is a ‘literature in bondage’ because a ‘deformed and stunted’ society can only ever produce a ‘deformed and stunted’ inner life. Is Disgrace itself an expression of this ‘bondage’, imprisoned by the distorting history of apartheid?"
