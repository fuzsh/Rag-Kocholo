        "text": "I take it as universally acknowledged that âdifficultâ in the proposition âA's style is difficultâ is a complex word, and hence that the proposition in fact expresses a number of component conclusions, many of them quantitative in nature and therefore capable of being chiselled into numerical form. We may infer, indeed, that these quantifiable components take their origin in some quantitative, cumulative procedure, however loose, that we follow in our minds as we read, and hence that propositions about âdifficultyâ and perhaps other so-called qualities of style are most simply and logically formulated with their quantitative and nonquantitative components kept distinct. Â [Coetzee 1969a,Â 226]\n\n[I]f we propose to describe the style of a text, an index must remain meaningless until we can specify precisely what it measures, i.e. with which phenomena in the text it varies systematically. If the value of the trace is high, as it is for Othello, what features of the language of Othello would this value enable us to predict without referring to the text? If its value is low, as it is for the present essay, what features of the essay are being reflected? Can we specify the features both simply and informatively? Â [Coetzee 1969a,Â 228]\n\nThe most obvious, and least useful, answer to these questions, Coetzee suggests, is that the âfullest statement of what the index measures is a mathematical restatement of the definition of the indexâ Â [\n\nWhat we hope for is presumably a compromise: neither the extreme simplicity but extreme vagueness of words like âdifficultyâ, nor the tautology of the restatement, but a fairly short, fairly precise set of empiric features of the text, between the index and which there is a fairly steady correlation. Â [Coetzee 1969a,Â 228]\n\nSo, what Coetzee proposes here is that the index will be meaningful if and only if variation in the trace is consistently accompanied in the object text by a commensurate variation in certain other empirically observable features: if, for instance, the trace is higher in one text than another, then we should reasonably be able to expect that the first text will contain fewer âclustersâ of words of more than three syllables â where the term âclusterâ is sufficiently defined â and that this increase ought to be commensurate with the increase in the trace value.\n\nIn the course of a fusillade against what he calls âthe revolt against reasonâ in present-day humanistic studies, Joshua Whatmough quotes a pronouncement of David Hilbert's from 1918: âEverything that can be an object of scientific thought at all, as soon as it is ripe for the formation of a theory, falls into the lap of the axiomatic method and thereby indirectly of mathematics.â Â [Coetzee 1969b,Â 1]\n\nLiterary criticism\n\nBetween the conceptions of style held by Bloch and implied by Beckett there are no doubt similarities: Beckett's âwriting without styleâ could be interpreted as writing with the statistical features of the language as a whole, whatever that may be. But there is a deeper cleavage which gives the two viewpoints a polar and antithetic relation. Underlying Bloch's definition is the idea of the text as a collection of sets of linguistic features (phonemes, morphemes, words, etc.) which can be treated like members of statistical populations; and a statistical population is only a metaphor for a set of points in probabilistic space. To Bloch, a word can be conveniently reduced, for the purposes of study, to a dimensionless and immaterial point. For Beckett, on the other hand, the âterribly arbitrary materiality of the word's surfaceâ[3] is, we infer, at least in 1937, a burden. Â [Coetzee 1969b,Â 3]\n\nThus, for example, of the âunique translucent enumerating styleâ of Watt he writes, âIt is an austere prose, not narcissistic, nor baroque. It is not opulent. It moves with the great aim of some computation, doing a thousand things but only necessary ones.â Â [Coetzee 1969b,Â 9â10]\n\nSimilarly, he explains, Ludovic Janvier's\n\nNo empirical data are introduced into his chains of speculation. The multiplication of these chains depends on a maneuver in four stages: statement of a question, proposal of a hypothesis, breakdown of the hypothesis into components, and analysis of the implications of the hypothesis and its components. [...] The third stage typically breaks the chain into two or more branches. The only qualification Watt demands of a hypothesis is that it answer the question: his criterion is one of logic rather than of simplicity. Â [Coetzee 1969b,Â 81]\n\nOn the one hand, then, Watt's consciousness represents the very model of the supposedly perfectly closed logical system of mathematics; on the other, his access to the sensory world beyond this closed system introduces experiential data that consistently evade its processes of assimilation and hence are habitually disregarded. This disregard, Coetzee continues, is in fact a âdisregard for simplicityâ and is the\n\nThe explosion of logic, epistemology, and ontology takes Watt into another zone (the asylum) in which he lives a progressively inverse life. Decline and inversion are reflected in Watt's language, as reported by the narrator Sam. Decline and inversion constitute what I call the shape of the telos. What is still lacking is the causal element. For certain reasons a certain kind of man experiences a call to a certain kind of situation, and the result is decline and inversion: we see the results but not the causes, unless we take the step of calling Watt's whole universe absurd. Â [Coetzee 1969b,Â 35â36]\n\nIt is in a similar context in the essay âSamuel Beckett and the Temptations of Styleâ [\n\nOn the other hand, the smallest amplifications of meaning, particularly those which were probably not under the conscious control of the author - - for example, the frequencies of the words in the text - - show, when quantified, what looks suspiciously like system, i.e. they act like well-behaved mathematical functions. Turning the syllogism upside down, we infer that well-behaved mathematical functions defined on the quantified components of the text define components that belong to the smaller amplifications of meaning. Â [Coetzee 1969b,Â 40]\n\nIn other words, certain initial â and often subconscious â affirmations are ultimately responsible for determining the nature of both the component features we discern as constitutive of a given text and the types of mathematical function that appear to describe or even govern their behaviour. Once a reader makes these affirmations, both the nominal and the functional aspects of the text become ontologically linked in a manner that has astonishingly little to do with the ontological status of the text prior to those affirmations. Extrapolating this observation to the use of natural language alongside quantitative evaluations, one can see the potential for such frameworks to engender obfuscation rather than the desired objective clarity. In Coetzee's example, for instance, one might question the effect of introducing an index for a term such as âelevation in dictionâ as a descriptor for certain textual features, other than to provide a misleading âconnotative freightâ:\n\nBy the time sufficiently many literary works have been described in terms of the same measures, the measures themselves may come to have associative values with different texts. We may find, for example, that a high noun-to-adjective ratio is common to Pliny and Thomas Ã Kempis, a low ratio to Virgil and Tacitus. The ratio may then become associated with a quality we may call elevation in diction. But ultimately elevation will have to be defined in terms of the noun-to-adjective ratio and other measures. There is no escape from the absolute measure of quantification here. Â [Coetzee 1969b,Â 44]\n\na little computation shows us that, whatever definitions of noun and verb we adopt, their effect on the noun-to-verb ratio, while greater than the effect introduced by the uncertainties created by implicit nouns and verbs, is considerably less than the effect that could be introduced by uncertainties in the classifications ânounâ and âverbâ [â¦]. It does imply that the potential for disastrous error is high when we depend on figures not derived from identical and therefore exhaustive definitions of noun and verb for the purpose of comparing the ânominalismâ of different texts and authors. Â [Coetzee 1969b,Â 46]\n\nCoetzee draws attention here, then, to the fatal circularity of any analysis that fails from the outset to recognise the uncertainties inherent in categorisations even as seemingly fundamental as ânounâ or âverbâ. Generally, the comparison of the works of any two authors requires strict definition of the terms of that comparison: the result of this comparison, however, is destined ultimately to become primarily a comment on the act of definition that has taken place, rather than on any inherent quality of the texts or authors themselves. To Coetzee's mind, the only conceivable solution to this problem that might help to âsquare intuition with mathematicsâ Â [\n\nBut now we have opened the floodgates. For we are not concerned, for example, with absolute rarity (whatever that is) but with rarity in a context. The position becomes untenable, for no generalization is possible, and the reason for computing to ratio in the first place is to have a measure of nominalism in the text, i.e. to have a generalization about a certain aggregate of particulars. Â [Coetzee 1969b,Â 49]\n\nWe are faced, then, with a story in which statistical analysis of the distribution of vocabulary, classification of the less neutral diction, and analysis en masse of sentence structure, seem at best only to confirm our understanding of the structure of the work and at worst to remain trapped in their own terminology. Â [Coetzee 1969b,Â 54]\n\nAs such, then, these âamplifications of meaningâ â affirmations for which the critic is solely responsible, ranging from the grouping of verbs under some grammatical concept such as transitivity (âholdâ with âthrowâ and ârevealâ for example) to the less robustly delineable association of nouns on a semantic basis (âbuildingâ with âedificeâ and âconstructionâ) â are necessarily echoed in the âfunctionâ that analysis of them reveals. In other words, in stylostatistics, as in mathematics generally, our observable and delineable data and our modes of observation and analysis are irrevocably bound up with one another and, in a sense, offer little more than tautology.\n\nIs it coincidence, or is it one instance of isomorphism between the structure of language and the structure of mathematics? In the first case the Zipf-Mandelbrot law[4] is a useful descriptive fact, loosely a âlaw.â In the second case it is indeed tautologous, but the consequences are too immense to bear contemplation. Â [Coetzee 1969b,Â 240â241]\n\nWilhelm Fucks is a polymath of refreshing synoptic vision or another of those muscle-men of statistics (Yule, Herdan et al.) to whom a ward of kwashiorkor[5] victims or a page of print is first of all a set of quantifiable phenomena and only secondarily people or literature. Â [Coetzee 1971,Â 92]\n\nGiven that Coetzee was already by this stage developing a dramatisation of an extremely similar process in\n\nThe first level of this consciousness contains a past womb-existence, a set of figments. The second level contains the figments of the new fiction Lessness that the consciousness now inhabits: ruin, sand, body, etc. The third level contains only the pair dawn-dusk, each of which eventually cancels both the other and the figments for which the other is responsible. Â [Coetzee 1973b,Â 198]\n\nSince any fragment can combine with any other fragment, and since the 106 phrasal components are not only formal elements but also pretty irreducible elements of meaning, composition is a combinatorial game played with creations of what I have called the second level of the imagining consciousness â a level whose creations are dismissed as figments â and the upshot of the game is nothing more than what Sam, in Watt, called âa pillow of old words.â Â [Coetzee 1973b,Â 198]"
