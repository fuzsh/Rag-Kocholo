        "text": "South African John Maxwell Coetzee has won the 2003 Nobel prize for literature.\n\nCoetzee was born in South Africa, but now lives in Adelaide with his partner, academic Dorothy Driver, after migrating to Australia in 2001.\n\nIn its citation, the Swedish Academy said Coetzee's novels are characterised by their well-crafted composition, pregnant dialogue and analytical brilliance.\n\n\"But at the same time, he is a scrupulous doubter, ruthless in his criticism of the cruel rationalism and cosmetic morality of Western civilisation.\"\n\nThe prize brings with it 10 million kronor ($A1.9 million) - not to mention increased sales and literary prestige.\n\nLiterary critic and Quarterly Essay editor Peter Craven described Coetzee as one of the most remarkable writers of fiction at work in the world today.\n\n\"His most recent book, Elizabeth Costello . . . was deeply witty and extremely moving.\n\n\"We are extremely privileged to have him living in this country,\" he said. Coetzee was a guest at the Melbourne Writers' Festival in 2002, where he read Elizabeth Costello to 500 people.\n\nBefore migrating to Australia, Coetzee held academic attachments to Melbourne University, as well as Queensland and Adelaide universities.\n\nSince moving to Adelaide, Coetzee has involved himself in the local literary scene by joining the Adelaide Festival Writers' Week committee.\n\nFellow committee member Greg Mackie said Coetzee's award was a fabulous recognition of his unique talent.\n\n\"He is one of the most remarkable writers in the English language anywhere,\" Mackie said.\n\nCoetzee was the first author to win the Booker Prize twice, for Life and Times of Michael K in 1983 and Disgrace in 1999.\n\nThe 18 lifetime members of the 217-year-old Swedish Academy make the annual selection in secrecy and do not reveal the date of the announcement until two days beforehand.\n\nNominees are not revealed publicly for 50 years, leaving the literary world to only guess about who was in the running.\n\nAlfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite, said the awards should go to those who \"shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\" and \"who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\".\n\nThe prizes are presented on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896.\n\nLast night Coetzee was in the United States, teaching a three-month creative writing course at Chicago University.\n\n- AP, with Sasha Shtargot, Penelope Debelle"
