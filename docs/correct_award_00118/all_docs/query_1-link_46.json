        "text": "\"But at the same time, he is a scrupulous doubter, ruthless in his criticism of the cruel rationalism and cosmetic morality of Western civilization.\"\n\nThe prize includes a check for more than 10 million kronor ($1.9 million), but it can also bestow the added advantage of increased sales, celebrity and admiration.\n\nThe academy had been Eurocentric in its recent decisions, giving the award to Europeans the last eight years.\n\nSince 1980, only three winners have come from Africa, three from South America, two from the United States and one from Asia.\n\nIt's been 14 years since someone from the Middle East was given the nod, Egyptian Naguib Mahfouz.\n\nCoetzee's works include Dusklands and Disgrace, which won the 1999 Booker Prize, the second time he took home that award.\n\nThe 18 lifetime members of the 217-year-old Swedish Academy make the annual selection in deep secrecy at one of their weekly meetings and do not even reveal the date of the announcement until two days beforehand.\n\nNominees are not revealed publicly for 50 years, leaving the literary world to only guess about who was in the running. However, many of the same critically acclaimed authors are believed to be on the short list every year.\n\nLast year's award went to Hungarian writer Imre Kertesz, whose fiction drew on his experience as a teenager in the Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nA week of Nobel Prizes starts on Monday with the medicine award, followed on Tuesday by physics and on Wednesday by chemistry and economics.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize winner will be named on October 10 in Oslo, the only Nobel not awarded in Sweden.\n\nAlfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite, specified in his will endowing the awards that nationality should not be a consideration, but many believe the Swedish Academy tries to spread the honour over different geographical areas.\n\nNobel otherwise gave only vague guidance about the prize, saying that it should go to those who \"shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\" and \"who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\".\n\nThe prizes always are presented December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896.\n\nA spokesman for the University of Adelaide said the university was very proud of Coetzee and pleased for his win.\n\nCoetzee is teaching graduate-level courses at the University of Chicago this northern autumn on Plato's Phaedrus and US poet Walt Whitman, the university said."
