        "text": "The South African writer JM Coetzee won the Nobel prize for literature last week for dark meditations on post-apartheid South Africa that have been acclaimed for reflecting the human condition.\n\nThe Swedish Academy hailed the author of such novels as Disgrace and Waiting For The Barbarians as a \"scrupulous doubter, ruthless in his criticism of the cruel rationalism and cosmetic morality of Western civilisation\".\n\nTypically Coetzee, 63, as spare in speech as prose, declined all interview requests. A statement released by the University of Chicago, where he is a visiting professor, said the news was a complete surprise. \"I was not even aware that the announcement was pending,\" he said.\n\nTributes from friends and colleagues hailed the award as recognition of a literary great whose fiction captured the anguish of inner lives against the backdrop of a changing social order. The citation from Stockholm commended an ability to write fiction that \"in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider\".\n\nCoetzee left South Africa several years ago for what some called self-imposed exile after a clash with the ruling African National Congress over his novel Disgrace. The daughter of the main character, like Coetzee a white academic, is raped by three black men but declines to prosecute, partly because of colonial guilt. Cabinet ministers said the story was racist, and invoked the human rights commission in a high-profile attack.\n\nCoetzee never fully explained whether his subsequent move to Australia was linked, but many South Africans believe he felt hounded. There is also speculation that he was upset by a burglary.\n\nIf the ANC felt awkward last week it did not show it, heaping praise on the writer and welcoming the award as a sequel to Nadine Gordimer's 1991 Nobel prize for literature. \"On behalf of the South African nation, and indeed the continent of Africa, we salute our latest Nobel laureate and bask with him in the glory radiating from this recognition,\" said President Thabo Mbeki.\n\nGordimer said she was delighted for her friend. \"It's an honour for the country, and it [gives] some indication of how South African literature has developed, particularly under the difficult conditions we have [had].\"\n\nCoetzee, a former lecturer at the University of Cape Town, had been tipped to win a Nobel after two Booker prizes in 1983 and 1999 for Life & Times Of Michael K and Disgrace. A virtual recluse, he shunned both award ceremonies and it is not clear if he will attend the Nobel ceremony on December 10.\n\nIn addition to a cheque for $1.3m the prize will boost Coetzee's sales, with his publishers hoping for a run on his new novel, Elizabeth Costello.\n\nThe 18 lifetime members of the Swedish Academy who made the annual selection all agreed on Coetzee, according to Horace Engdahl, the permanent secretary of the academy. \"We were convinced of the lasting value of his contribution to literature. I'm not speaking of the number of books, but the variety and the very high average quality.\"\n\nThe son of liberal parents, Coetzee worked briefly in Britain as a programmer for IBM and in 1969 received a PhD from the University of Texas for computer-generated language.\n\nExcept for Disgrace, which sold more than 100,000 copies in South Africa, he is not widely read there. \"I don't think the majority of South Africans know who he is,\" said David Attwell, a professor at the University of Witwatersrand.\n\nÂ· The 2003 Nobel Prize for medicine was won jointly on Monday by the American scientist Paul C. Lauterbur and Britain's Sir Peter Mansfield for discoveries leading to the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a procedure used by doctors to create internal images of patients.\n\nThe Nobel peace prize will be announced on Friday from a record field of 165 candidates. Tips for the prize include Pope John Paul, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and former Czech President Vaclav Havel."
