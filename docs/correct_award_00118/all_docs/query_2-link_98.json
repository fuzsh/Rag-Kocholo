        "text": "A 1990 book review of Age of Iron in The New York Times.\n\nMichiko Kakutani of The New York Times takes a look back on Coetzee's works and the direction that they have taken over the years.\n\nAn article in The New York Times poses the question as to whether Coetzee left his homeland because the government denounced one of his novels as being racist.\n\nCheck out this text version of the lecture Coetzee delivered when he won the Nobel Prize in 2003.\n\nHorace Engdahl announces that J.M. Coetzee is the 2003 Nobel Laureate in Literature. He announces it in like ten languages. Jeez. Also, check out how crazy the media gets about it with lights flashing everywhere!\n\nCoetzee receives the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature, looking quite dapper and refined, if we do say so ourselves.\n\nHorace Engdahl, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, introduces J.M. Coetzee before he gives his Nobel lecture. Engdahl provides a few good tidbits about Coetzee's reputation and personality.\n\nCoetzee gives a lecture to the audience after winning his Nobel Prize in 2003.\n\nCheck out where Age of Iron takes place â€“ in the areas surrounding Cape Town in the western part of the country.\n\nCoetzee speaks with poet Peter Sacks and reads selections of his work. (Recorded November 8, 2001.)\n\nOur boy J.M. got to take home this absolutely gorgeous prize in 2003."
