        "text": "The Booker prize threw up one of its greatest surprises last night when the South African writer J M Coetzee won for the second time, for his book Disgrace. He is the only novelist to have won the prestigious award twice.\n\nCoetzee, 59, was not at Guildhall in London to receive the Â£21,000 prize, which insiders thought was destined to go to Michael Frayn.\n\nRumours of a deadlock among the judges spread after they failed to make it into the main hall for the beginning of the speeches. But chairman Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP, said there had been no falling-outs in the four hours of deliberations. However, agreement had not been easy. \"I won't say we were deadlocked, but it was certainly agonising for some of us.\"\n\nCoetzee's novel centres on an embittered lecturer at Cape Town university who is forced to resign after an affair with a young student and takes refuge with his grown-up daughter on a remote farm.\n\nThe book is a dark meditation on the new South Africa from the perspective of a disillusioned middle-class white man, and turns even darker when the central character's daughter is raped.\n\nCoetzee, who also did not attend when he won the Booker in 1983 with The Life and Times of Michael K, can look forward to a huge boost in sales. Last year's winner, Ian McEwan, saw an extra 300,000 sales of his novel Amsterdam.\n\nGeoff Mulligan, Coetzee's editor at Secker & Warburg who collected the award on his behalf, said the famously reclusive writer could not be at the ceremony because of a prior engagement. He was thought to be taking a seminar at the Cape Town university, where he teaches English.\n\nHe read from a letter which Coetzee had prepared in the event of a win. \"If I do win it's only because the stars this October 25 are in a lucky conjunction for me,\" it said. The author described all the shortlisted authors as \"equally worthy winners\".\n\nHe said of the prize: \"It remains the ultimate prize to win in the English speaking world.\"\n\nUp until the cliff-hanging final deliberations, this year's Booker was devoid of the traditional rows and falling-outs. Only the fact that a number of literary big-hitters, including Salman Rushdie and Vikram Seth, were left off the short-list caused a stir.\n\nMr Kaufman said there had been no recriminations about the judges' choice. However, it is believed that Coetzee pipped Frayn's comic novel Headlong in the final straight after literary critic Natasha Walter felt it was too lightweight for the prize. At least two other judges had been pushing Frayn, 66.\n\nMr Kaufman unusually declared that Anita Desai, shortlisted for her novel Fasting, Feasting, would have been the judges' runner-up if such an award existed. Desai has been shortlisted three times."
