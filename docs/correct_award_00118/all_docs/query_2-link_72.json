        "text": "2023 Taobuk International Award for Literary Excellence\n\nA recognition of moral, artistic and professional value, the Taobuk Awards were established in 2014 and are given annually to high-profile personalities in the literary, artistic and civic worlds. The International Award for Literary Excellence and the Lifetime Achievement Award have brought distinguished personalities in every field of knowledge to Taormina to form a Roll of Honour.\n\n2021 Strand Magazine Critics Awards: Lifetime Achievement\n\nRecognizing excellence in the field of mystery fiction and publishing, the 2021 Strand Critics Awards are judged by a select group of book critics and journalists.\n\n2020 Prix mondial Cino Del Duca\n\nRecognizing an author whose work constitutes, in a scientific or literary form, a message of modern humanism.\n\n2019 Killer Nashville John Seigenthaler Legends Award\n\nJohn Seigenthaler was a well-known editor, publisher, writer, TV personality, First Amendment champion, advocate for writers, and longtime supporter of Killer Nashville.\n\nLike its namesake, the annual Killer Nashville John Seigenthaler Legends Award™ is bestowed upon an individual within the publishing industry who has championed First Amendment Rights to ensure that all opinions are given a voice, has exemplified mentorship and example to authors, supporting the new voices of tomorrow, and/or has written an influential canon of work that will continue to influence authors for many years to come.\n\n2019 Jerusalem Prize\n\nSince 1963 the Jerusalem Prize is awarded biennially, as an integral part of the JIBF, to a writer whose work best expresses and promotes the idea of “freedom of the individual in society.” Some of the authors who were awarded the Jerusalem Prize later received Nobel Prize for Literature, among them – Bertrand Russell , Octavio Paz, V. S. Naipaul, Mario Vargas Llosa and J. M. Coetzee.\n\nThe 2019 Jerusalem Prize will be awarded to critically acclaimed American Author Joyce Carol Oates. Oates will receive the prize from the Mayor of Jerusalem, Moshe Lion, at the joint opening ceremony of the Jerusalem International Book Forum and the International Writers Festival of Mishkenot Sha’ananim (May 12, 2019).\n\nFrom the Jury’s decision:\n\n“With a deep and profound psychological understanding, she confronts her heroes – as well as her readers – with the ways in which people deal with internal or external demons, and their struggle defines the boundaries of the human condition. But throughout this confrontation, even in its wildest manifestations, a constant line of grace and compassion is discernible.”\n\nJoyce carol Oates:\n\n“I am deeply honored to be a recipient of this distinguished international literary award made to writers whose work deals with the freedom of the individual in society. In a world in which individual freedoms are under assault, the autonomy of the individual and the role of art in our lives is of great concern.”\n\nMembers of the jury for the 2019 Prize are Dr. Tamar Hess (chairperson), Dr. Omri Herzog and Prof. Shimon Adaf.\n\n2017 Bilbao BBK Ja! Prize\n\nThe International Festival of Literature and Art with Humour, Ja! Bilbao is a cultural event that aims to highlight the importance of humour -understood in the broadest sense of the term-, in the arts in general and especially in literature. The organisers understand and really work to reclaim the role of humour as an expression of intelligence, civilization and the joy of living. Through the BBK Ja! Bilbao Award, the festival pays tribute each year to an international figure, whose work grants humour a starring role. The prize winners up until now have been Tom Sharpe, Francisco Ibáñez, Ismail Kadaré (in an edition on humour against barbarism), Robert Crumb, Julian Barnes and Fernando Trueba.\n\nHumour runs throughout the extraordinary work of Joyce Carol Oates. Perhaps not evidently, but in a substantial way. It is veiled, deadpan, subtle humour. In a recent interview published in Spain she was asked if there was something in her literature that had not been talked about enough. She drew attention to her “black humour, and also modern humour” and insisted that she likes to see the ironic side of things even at the most tragic times.\n\n2016 American Philosophical Society Member\n\nAn eminent scholarly organization of international reputation, the American Philosophical Society promotes useful knowledge in the sciences and humanities through excellence in scholarly research, professional meetings, publications, library resources, and community outreach. This country’s first learned society, the APS has played an important role in American cultural and intellectual life for over 250 years.\n\n2015 A.J. Liebling Award for Outstanding Boxing Writing\n\n…it is her occasional forays into boxing, most notably her critically acclaimed 1987 collection of essays, On Boxing, which have made her a lightning rod for both praise and criticism from an insulated, mostly male group that prefers to see only that which is good about the most primal of athletic endeavors.\n\nBarnes & Noble Writers for Writers Award, 2014\n\nEstablished in 1996, the Barnes & Noble Writers for Writers Awards celebrate authors who have given generously to other writers or to the broader literary community. Nominations are solicited from past winners, other prominent writers, members of the publishing community, and Poets & Writers’ Board and staff. These nominations are reviewed and winners selected by a committee comprised of current and past members of the Board of Directors. Title of the award has been given to Barnes & Noble in appreciation of their extraordinary support of Poets & Writers\n\nPoets & Writers is pleased to recognize Joyce Carol Oates’s dedication to promoting emerging writers, through the Ontario Review and Ontario Review Press, which she founded with her late husband Raymond J. Smith, and the Pushcart Prize anthology, for which she served as a founding editor.\n\n2012 PEN Center USA Award for Lifetime Achievement\n\n2012 Mailer Prize for Lifetime Achievement\n\n2012 Howard T.
