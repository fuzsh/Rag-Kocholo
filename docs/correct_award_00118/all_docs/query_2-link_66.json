        "text": "Introduction\n\nOne of the most prestigious prizes in the literary field launched in 1969 as the Booker-McConnell Prize. Today, it is known as the Man Booker, most often referred to as simply the “Booker,” and is administered by the National Book League of the United Kingdom. The Man Booker Prize itself is awarded to the best novel written in English and published in the United Kingdom, while the Man Booker International Prize is intended to compliment the Man Booker proper. In 2013, the rules were changed to allow the Booker Prize to be awarded to any novel written in English, as opposed to novels written by writers from the Commonwealth, Ireland, or Zimbabwe (see Postcolonial Novel).\n\nDuring the 1990s, awarding of the prize became highly controversial. Publicity stunts encouraged by the marketing power of the prize marred the prestige of the award. Many accused the prize committee of catering to either the needs of otherwise unknown authors in the right place at the right time or to the same few authors each year. Political agendas and profit motives have also received much attention in recent years, further fuelling the controversy surrounding the prize. Furthermore, there has been much debate over the qualification of the writers and other members of the prize committee.\n\nMarketing & Publicity\n\nBecause of its prestige, the Booker Prize has become an enormously successful marketing vehicle for nominated authors and their publishers alike. It has been so ubiquitously sought that the award committee has limited entrants to three per publisher for each year. They award a £20,000 prize in late October or early November (Middlemiss). That prize money, however, is hardly worth mentioning compared to the exponential growth in book sales that follows. It is because of an almost guaranteed marketing power that the Booker is not without controversy. Even during the mid 1980s, the Booker was known to “create free publicity on a scale which makes it a major marketing tool” (Potts 27). For example, Anita Brookner had previously sold 2,000 to 3,000 of her books each, but when Hotel du Lac was announced the Booker Prize winner, sales soared to best selling levels (Goff 22).\n\nSuch an enormous potential by means of increased sales has made the Booker subject to marketing ploys heretofore unknown in the literary field. First of all, an author must make his presence known to his potential judges. It seems as though the author has to live in the literary section of London but not write about modern life there; instead, write “magically realistically.” Booker winners all should have “cool, stylish, amoral pose[s]” on the book cover. Because of the increased media attention for which the authors who win the Booker seem to strive, Richard Potts, a critic for the Times Literary Supplement quips that the author should “go for extreme publicity ploys i.e. the author should shoot his literary agent on live TV – anything to draw attention” (27).\n\nIn accordance with Potts’ observations, in 1996 four of the six writers on the Booker’s short list had been nominated before. The other two consisted of a magical realist writing about London in the 1950s and a Northern Irish poet and critic. Both of the authors match exactly Potts “criteria.” They are both well known among their colleagues, and one of them has the good fortune of being from a politically sensitive area (“Déjà Vu All Over Again” 106).\n\nThe Judges\n\nUnlike many other modern awards, the Booker committee must consist of an author, a hardback and a paperback publisher, a librarian, the chairman of the committee, the prize’s administrator, and an executive from the Booker Party, Limited (Goff 12). The actual administration of the prize is handed over to Book Trust, an independent charitable organisation whose mission is to promote reading and literacy (Goff 12), nonetheless the judges of the prize cannot seem to exist without controversy (“Judging the Booker Prize” 89).\n\nConclusion\n\nBecause of the marketing potential and the industry-renowned judges, the Booker Prize now is a very high stakes award. Authors, in turn, have more reason to tailor their work to the expectations of the Booker arbiters. On occasion, the obtuse wording of the requirements of the winning book has been exploited and has resulted in ironic results. For example, because South African authors are included in those eligible to receive the Booker Prize, twice during the apartheid regime, Nadine Gordimer and J. M. Coetzee, authors known for their anti-apartheid stance won the award. Some even believe that novice authors whose work could win the Booker should consider changing publishers. Even though the second publisher might not have the marketing power that the first commands, the winning of the Booker will certainly cause higher sales of the book (Goff 19). Those types of abuses definitely provide fodder for thought about the validity and the purpose of the Booker. The Booker Prize garners much attention but not always for reasons with which the prize committee would be most comfortable.\n\nFor the most part, though, Booker Prize winners are excellently-written works with well-executed themes, plots, and purposes. The books themselves are well deserving of such prizes and can provide for entertaining reading or appropriate additions to a college level literature course. Sometimes, though, the Booker Prize garners much attention but not always for reasons with which the prize committee would be most comfortable.\n\nRecent Winners\n\nWinners of the Booker Prize over the past few years are as follows:\n\n2017 Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders\n\n2016 The Sellout by Paul Beatty (first non-Commonwealth, Ireland, or Zimbabwean winner)\n\n2015 A Brief History of Seven Killings by Marlon James\n\n2014 The Narrow Road to the Deep North by Richard Flanagan\n\n2013 The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton\n\n2012 Bring Up the Bodies by Hilary Mantel\n\n2011 The Sense of an Ending by Julian Barnes\n\n2010 The Finkler Questions by Howard Jacobson\n\n2009 Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel\n\n2008 The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga\n\n2007 The Gathering by Anne Enright\n\n2006 The Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai\n\n2005 The Sea by John Banville\n\n2004 The Line of Beauty by Alan Hollinghurst\n\n2003 Vernon God Little by DBC Pierre\n\n2002 Life of Pi by Yann Martel\n\n2001 True History of Kelly Gang by Peter Carey\n\n2000 The Blind Assassin by Margaret Atwood\n\n1999 Disgrace by J.M.
