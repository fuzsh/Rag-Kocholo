He was the fourth African writer to be honored and the second South African to be honored after Nadine Gordimer. Coetzee was awarded the Order of Mapungubwe by the South African government for his “exceptional contribution in the field of literature and for putting South Africa on the world stage.” In addition to that, he holds numerous honorary doctorates and is considered one of the most celebrated authors of his time.\n\nPublication Order of Jesus Trilogy Books\n\nPublication Order of Scenes from Provincial Life Books\n\nPublication Order of Standalone Novels\n\nPublication Order of Short Story Collections\n\nPublication Order of Non-Fiction Books\n\nPublication Order of Anthologies\n\nIf You Like J.M.
