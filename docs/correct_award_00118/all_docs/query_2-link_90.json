The award is given to an individual who has produced “in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction”.\n\nREAD MORE: Bob Dylan’s Poetic Mastery: 10 Of His Finest Lyrics\n\nThe Guardian reports that Sara Danils, Secretary of the Swedish Academy, described Dylan as “a great sampler… and for 54 years he has been at it, reinventing himself.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn his classic ‘Blonde on Blonde’, she said: “An extraordinary example of his brilliant way of rhyming. putting together refrains, and his brilliant way of thinking.”\n\n“If you look far back, 5000 years, you discover Homer and Sappho. They wrote poetic texts which were meant to be performed, and it’s the same way for Bob Dylan. We still read Homer and Sappho, and we enjoy it.”\n\nPrevious winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature include Alice Munro, Harold Pinter, Doris Lessing, J M Coetzee, Toni Morrison and Seamus Heaney.\n\nRecommended"
