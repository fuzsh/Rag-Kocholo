        "text": "Biography\n\nJ(ohn) M(axwell) Coetzee was born in Cape Town in 1940 and studied both in South Africa and the United States as a computer scientist and linguist. He is the only person to win two Man Booker Prizes. His work is typified by his”deconstruction” (yes, I know, I hate that word too) of Western literature (Dostoevsky, Defoe), his sparse Afrikaaner view of history and his brilliant almost allegorical dissection of the structures of power. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2003. In 2006 he became an Australian citizen. He is undoubtedly the leading South African novelist.\n\nBooks about J M Coetzee\n\nDominic Head: J.M.
