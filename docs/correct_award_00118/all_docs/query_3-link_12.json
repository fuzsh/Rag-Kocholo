        "text": "(born 1940). The South African-born writer J.M. Coetzee is best known for his novels about the effects of colonialism in Africa. In 2003 he won the Nobel Prize for Literature. In the 21st century, he left South Africa and became a citizen of Australia in 2006.\n\nJohn Maxwell Coetzee was born on February 9, 1940, in Cape Town, South Africa. Although he came from an Afrikaner family (descendants of Dutch settlers), he grew up speaking English. In 1963 he received a master’s degree from the University of Cape Town. Then he went to the United States, where he earned a Ph.D. at the University of Texas in 1969. During this time, the South African government was enforcing its policy of apartheid, or racial segregation. Coetzee was opposed to apartheid, but he returned to South Africa.\n\nCoetzee taught English at the University of Cape Town and other universities. He began publishing novels in the 1970s. He also wrote about literature and translated books from Dutch and Afrikaans into English.\n\nCoetzee’s first books were Dusklands (1974), In the Heart of the Country (1977), and Waiting for the Barbarians (1980). Two later novels—Life & Times of Michael K (1983) and Disgrace (1999)—won the Booker Prize, a top British literary award. Coetzee was the first author to win the Booker Prize twice. Coetzee continued to write novels in the 21st century. In 2003 he received the world’s highest award for literature, the Nobel Prize.\n\nIn addition to novels, Coetzee published a number of nonfiction books. He wrote his autobiography in three parts: Boyhood (1997), Youth (2002), and Summertime (2009). Coetzee moved to Australia in 2002."
