        "text": "South African writer JM Coetzee has won the 2003 Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nThe 63-year-old writer, long a favoured contender, was given the prestigious award for his ability to write stories that \"in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider.\"\n\nIn its citation, the academy said Coetzee's novels are characterised by their well-crafted composition, pregnant dialogue and analytical brilliance. \"But at the same time, he is a scrupulous doubter, ruthless in his criticism of the cruel rationalism and cosmetic morality of western civilisation.\"\n\nHorace Engdahl, the permanent secretary of the academy, said the decision was an easy one.\n\n\"We were very much convinced of the lasting value of his contribution to literature. I'm not speaking of the number of books, but the variety, and the very high average quality,\" he said. \"I think he is a writer. . . that will continue to be discussed and analysed and we think he should belong to our literary heritage.\"\n\nThe prize includes a cheque for more than 10m kronor (US$1.3 million), but it can also bestow the added advantage of increased sales, celebrity and admiration.\n\nIt is the second time since 1991 that the academy has given the award to a South African. In 1991, they awarded the prize to Nadine Gordimer.\n\nThe academy has been Eurocentric in its recent decisions, giving the award to Europeans the last eight years. Since 1980, only three winners have come from Africa, three from South America, two from the United States and one from Asia. It's been 14 years since someone from the Middle East was given the nod, Egyptian Naguib Mahfouz.\n\nCoetzee is renowned for shunning publicity, and never bothered to collect the two Booker prizes he won in 1983 and 1999 (for Disgrace).\n\nCoetzee, who holds a Ph.D in computer-generated language, is one of South Africa's most successful authors, penning eight novels and numerous essays and manifestos covering everything from rugby to censorship.\n\nCurrently in Chicago on sabbatical from the University of Cape Town, Coetzee spent time working as a computer programmer in the United Kingdom before studying linguistics in Texas.\n\n\"There is a great wealth of variety in Coetzee's works,\" the academy said in its citation. \"No two books ever follow the same recipe. Extensive reading reveals a recurring pattern, the downward spiraling journeys he considers necessary for the salvation of his characters.\"\n\nThe 18 lifetime members of the 217-year-old Swedish Academy make the annual selection in deep secrecy at one of their weekly meetings and do not even reveal the date of the announcement until two days beforehand.\n\nNominees are not revealed publicly for 50 years, leaving the literary world to only guess about who was in the running. However, many of the same critically acclaimed authors are believed to be on the short list every year.\n\nLast year's award went to Hungarian writer Imre Kertesz, whose fiction drew on his experience as a teenager in the Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nWork by JM Coetzee\n\nFiction\n\nDusklands (1974)\n\nIn the Heart of the Country: A Novel (1977)\n\nWaiting for the Barbarians (1980)\n\nLife and Times of Michael K 1983 (Winner of the 1983 Booker Prize)\n\nFoe (1986)\n\nAge of Iron (1990)\n\nA Land Apart (1992)\n\nThe Master of Petersburg (1994)\n\nDisgrace 1999 (Winner of the 1999 Booker Prize)\n\nThe Lives of Animals (1999)\n\nYouth: Scenes from Provincial Life II (2002)\n\nElizabeth (2003)\n\nNonfiction\n\nWhite Writing: On the Culture of Letters (1988)\n\nDoubling the Point : Essays and Interviews (1992)\n\nGiving Offense: Essays on Censorship (1996)\n\nStranger Shores: Literary Essays, 1986-1999 (2001)\n\nNobel literature laureates since 1960:"
