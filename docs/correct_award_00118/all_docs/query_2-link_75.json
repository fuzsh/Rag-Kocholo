        "text": "Who wrote it?\n\nJohn Maxwell Coetzee (1940-; active 1974-), born Cape Town, South Africa. A much-awarded novelist, with accolades including the Nobel Prize for Literature, he was the first author to win the Booker twice (in the chronological sense, at least) - with 1983’s Life and Times of Michael K taking the honours back in 1983.\n\nSomething of a polymath, he studied English before working as a computer programmer for IBM in London, and managed to combine the two by completing a computer-aided analysis of the language of Beckett for his doctoral thesis while in the US on a Fulbright scholarship. He was one of a small number of prominent white South African authors to overtly criticize Apartheid, and has a history of protest dating back to anti-Vietnam war protests and continuing through recent involvement in animal rights issues.\n\nWhat's it about?\n\nDisgrace is told from the perspective of David Lurie, a divorced literature professor at a university in post-Apartheid Cape Town. The first half of the novel details Lurie’s life as an aging academic and Byron obsessive, satisfying himself with weekly visits to prostitutes. He loses everything following his pursuit and eventual rape of a young female student, and subsequent refusal to co-operate with an enquiry that seems designed to protect him.\n\nDavid moves to the country to visit his daughter, Lucy, which initially seems to offer respite, before Lucy’s world is shattered by a shockingly violent attack and rape by three young black men, who also try to kill David and shoot several of the farm’s dogs. David becomes increasingly estranged from his former life, from his daughter, and ultimately from the modern world, seeking solace in his attempts to write an opera about Byron, and less predictably, in disposing of euthanised dogs as a help to Bev Shaw, a friend of his daughter’s.\n\nWhat I liked\n\nThis is an astonishing novel, in so many ways. It’s unflinchingly honest, and incredibly lucid. The writing is supremely well-crafted and minimal, with not a word going to waste.\n\nIt’s a novel whose morals and messages are impossible to reduce to simple summaries. It’s tackling massive themes around race relations in South Africa, life and death, father-daughter relationships, aging, and the terrifying truths of maleness. To me, it never felt like it was preaching or over-simplifying any of these issues.\n\nIt’s a provocative novel, in that David’s perspective is the only one we hear, and he is emphatically an awful person but he speaks in Coetzee’s alarmingly compelling prose. He is at least somewhat aware of his own failings, but seemingly powerless to do anything about them. Every attempt he makes with Lucy, in particular, only furthers her suffering. His lack of true self-knowledge and inability to adapt to a changing world means his only solution is ultimately to withdraw further and further from his life, and take himself out of situations where he is a danger to those around him.\n\nReading the novel in 2021, as many have pointed out, is an incredibly prescient experience. In the wake of the Me Too movement, are we closer to dismantling the systems that enabled characters like Lurie to evade real justice (if not their own conscience)? Jia Tolentino’s excellent article Reading Disgrace during the Harvey Weinstein Trial, from the New Yorker, is an intriguing read on the subject.\n\nUltimately, for all the horrors within, I couldn’t put this one down. It’s unsettling, disturbing, and at times horrific reading, but it’s supremely compelling for all of those reasons.\n\nWhat I didn’t like\n\nI have to be honest and say that personally, I found this an incredible read, up there with the absolute best of the Booker winners. I can absolutely see why others might not have had such a positive experience. It certainly will be a triggering novel for some, and it does not hold back on the brutality of the experiences it’s describing.\n\nSome might also take issue with Coetzee, a white man, being the voice of these complex and divisive issues. However, I think this is satisfactorily acknowledged by the text - it examines the darkness at the heart of the male, white, middle class South African protagonist, who ponders whether he has it in him to put himself in the place of his daughter (or, by implication, his own victim/s.)\n\nFood & drink pairings"
