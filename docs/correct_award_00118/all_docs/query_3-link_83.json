        "text": "Disgrace won the 1999 Booker Prize and four years later Coetzee won the Nobel Prize in Literature, partly on the basis of it. So we are among the heavy hitters, the big players, the prize winners.\n\nUnfortunately, although it rises to an awesome level by the end, for most of its length I really didn’t get on with this book for three simple reasons: the clichéd subject matter of the first half, the repellent character of the central figure, and the pompously orotund prose style all the way through which set my teeth on edge.\n\nClichés and stereotypes\n\nWhen I realised just a few pages in that the subject of at least the first part of the book was going to be a grumpy, middle-aged, white male academic (David Lurie), pissed off with his job, pissed off with the modern world, pissed off his know-nothing students (‘the bored youth of the country’), and a hardened philanderer and letch into the bargain, my heart sank down to my boots. A horny grumpy old male academic complaining about the ‘modern world’ – good grief, is there a subject more hackneyed, clichéd, overworked, exhausted and worn out?\n\nJust in the UK I can think of novels by Kingsley Amis, David Lodge, Howard Jacobson and Tom Sharpe which all feature grumpy, middle-aged, sex-obsessed academics leching after their students and colleagues’ wives. At least those authors have the excuse of exaggerating things for comic effect in consciously comic novels. ‘Disgrace’ is absolutely humourless.\n\nIn this Coetzee struck me as more like the American tradition of creepy, self-centred academics, who behave appallingly and then complain that the world’s got it in for them, a tradition which would include the protagonists of at least three novels by Saul Bellow (Herzog, The Dean’s December and Ravelstein) and at least one by Philip Roth, The Human Stain.\n\nPretentious\n\nThe central protagonist of Disgrace is David Lurie. He used to be a professor of modern languages but wearily relates that there was ‘a great reorganisation’ at Cape Technical University where he works and now he’s forced to teach ‘Communications 101’ and ‘Communications 201’. He thinks this subject is rubbish, the university authorities are idiots, and all his students are ignorant morons with zero knowledge of western culture.\n\nThe trouble is that Lurie himself is such a clichéd figure, and routinely spouts cultural references of such obviousness, that it made me want to bang my head against the wall.\n\nAt Lurie’s university the lecturers are given space to teach on subjects in addition to their set ones (‘he is allowed to offer one special-field course a year’) and in these spaces Lurie teaches topics close to his heart, such as Wordsworth. In the scenes we are shown of him teaching, Lurie goes heavy on the ‘inner archetypes of the spirit’ which Wordsworth describes and which actual reality, in so many of his poems, fails to live up to (p.21). This is potentially interesting but Coetzee makes sure to frame it in such a way as to make Lurie sound pompous and precious, enthralled by his own superior sensitivity.\n\n‘Wordsworth has been one of my masters.’ It is true. For as long as he can remember, the harmonies of The Prelude have echoed within him. (p.13)\n\nIt’s not so much the tiresome way the character makes literary references all the way through the novel, it’s that they’re so obvious. When Lurie ponders the complexities of having affairs, he immediately thinks of Emma Bovary, probably the most famous affair-haver in Western literature. All of his literary namedropping is of the most obvious, clichéd kind – as I detail below.\n\nIn addition, Lurie is much given to dropping French tags into his conversation. For example when he is thinking about the prostitute he enjoys sleeping with once a week on a regular basis, he clever-cleverly reflects that her name is probably a nom de commerce. Ho ho, qu’il est intelligent, ce type-ci!\n\nI’ve just finished reading William Boyd’s novel ‘An Ice Cream War’, set during the First World War, and one of the British Army officers in it thinks he makes himself interesting by dropping French or Italian tags into everyday conversation whenever possible, with the result that all the other officers come to thoroughly hate him.\n\nWell, that’s what Lurie does here and it made me despise his straining pretentiousness. When Lurie notices his daughter is running to fat he can’t leave it at that, he has to go on to share a quote from the medieval French poet François Villon:\n\n‘Qu’est devenu ce front poli,\n\nces cheveux blonds, sourcils sourcils voûtis?’\n\nThis isn’t how literature should be used, as superficial tags to impress and intimidate people, as decorations and baubles. Literature should open your mind, deepen your perceptions and enrich your life, not be a shallow instrument for showing off.\n\nA little later, Lurie makes a tired reference to the third-century theologian Origen, but not to his theology, which would be demanding, just to the single most notorious thing about Origen which is that he is alleged to have castrated himself to ensure entry into the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\nWhen he wants to make the latest student he is seducing, Melanie, more relaxed (or, more likely, just intimidate her with his cultural capital) Lurie puts Mozart’s clarinet concerto on the gramophone. As you do. On another occasion he asks her, ‘Do you like dance? Not dancing, dance?’ and having established his intellectual superiority, slips a video cassette into the VCR of two modern dancers filmed with a stroboscopic camera so as to leave ghost images behind as they move. Yes. Aren’t you clever? Aren’t you the culturally superior one.\n\nAfter the first time he and Melanie have sex, Lurie self-satisfiedly thinks the dishevelled scene worthy of the satirical German artist, George Grosz. All the way through he dresses up his often squalid behaviour with trite cultural tinsel.\n\nWhen Lurie explains that he refused to kowtow to the committee investigating his behaviour, his daughter:\n\ngives him what he can only call a sweet smile. ‘So you are determined to go on being bad. Mad, bad, and dangerous to know?’ (p.77)\n\n‘Mad, bad and dangerous to know’ is probably the most famous quote about the English Romantic poet Lord Byron. I realise that the daughter is making a joke about the long-pondered, long-delayed study Lurie is meant to be writing about Byron, but the ‘joke’ just feels so obvious and trite. All these knowing references would be bearable if they were at least interesting or shed new light on the subjects he’s referring to, or came from interesting angles – instead of which they are mind-numbingly limp and clichéd. There are t-shirts with the slogan mad, bad and dangerous to know on them, it’s that much of an obvious meme.\n\nPretentious cultural references\n\nByron (throughout, for example on page 120 he slips the line ‘Though the heart be still as loving,\n\nAnd the moon be still as bright’ into his thoughts, unattributed, though anyone who’s done an English degree should spot them as lines from maybe Byron’s best known poem)\n\nWordsworth (numerous times in the early chapters, the aim being to demonstrate Lurie’s fine sensibility, when he’s not hitting on his students)\n\nEmma Bovary (pages 5 and 150)\n\nOrigen (p.9)\n\n‘From fairest creatures we desire increase,’ he says, ‘that thereby beauty’s rose might never die.’ Shakespeare, sonnet 1 (p.16)\n\nGeorge Grosz (p.19)\n\nZola (p.40)\n\nquote from Villon (p.65)\n\nreference to, and explanation of, the River Lethe (p.83)\n\nthe French word ‘paysan’ (p.117)\n\nreference to French philosopher René Descartes (p.124)\n\nquote from Thomas Hardy’s novel Jude the Obscure (p.146)\n\nVirgil, his most famous line sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt from Book 1 of the Aeneid (p.162) which I have reviewed\n\nquote from W.B. Yeats (p.190)\n\nquote from the English medieval poem Piers Plowman (p.192)\n\npassing reference to Freud’s theory of the Pleasure Principle (p.199)\n\nquote from Dante’s Inferno (p.209)\n\nquote from Victor Hugo (p.218)\n\nNow, maybe all this is by way of presenting David Lurie the character as a pretentious, shallow pseudo-intellectual i.e. it’s not Coetzee it’s Lurie who is addicted to making trite and obvious literary references. But it makes for an irritating read. And anyway, it’s not the main problem with the character…\n\nAbusive sex pest\n\nLurie displays staggering, breath-takingly sexist attitudes, continually, on every page.\n\nHe does not like women who make no effort to be attractive. (p.72)\n\nThe book goes out of its way to highlight, from page one, that Lurie is a sex pest. Twice divorced (another teeth-aching cliché of the stereotypical angry male fictional academic) Lurie is currently having sex with a Muslim prostitute once a week, the one he so cleverly thinks must use a nom de commerce.\n\nBut very early on we overhear him looking back on his track record as a Lothario – seducing colleagues’ wives, picking up tourists at seafront bars, regularly sleeping with whores – propositioning anything in a skirt, basically (p.7). For example, he takes the new faculty secretary for lunch and pretends to listen while she yaks on about her kids, before taking her out a second time then onto his house where they, with horrible inevitability, have sex. What a creep.\n\nBut, having thoroughly established that Lurie is a lecherous sex pest, Coetzee then takes him way over the line into active abuse, into professionally inappropriate and illegal behaviour, when Lurie starts an affair with one of his students. One day he happens to be walking across the old college gardens and overtakes one of his students, Melanie Isaacs. He tells us, in his casually sexist way, that she is not a particularly pretty student, not one of the ones he’s been lusting after for ages (!) but nevertheless, having accidentally bumped into her, he offers her a lift home because it’s raining, then invites/coerces her to stay on for dinner which he showily cooks (to the accompaniment of Mozart’s clarinet concerto) then he has sex with her. Thus begins their ‘relationship’.\n\nAll the way through this ‘relationship’ Melanie is portrayed as an object, a body for sexual gratification, her mind and personality remaining a complete mystery to him. She acquiesces in seeing him, acquiesces in having sex, acquiesces in all his coercive behaviour but he never really gets to know her.\n\nThis is what my daughter the sociology student calls ‘rapey’ behaviour and, when I looked it up, Lurie is an exact match of the dictionary definition: ‘sexually aggressive or inappropriate in a way that causes fear or unease.’\n\nBecause it continually comes over that Melanie is intimidated by Lurie, he forces her to meet up, pressurises her to have sex, he reluctance makes the reader extremely uneasy. And all this leads up to the occasion when his bullying behaviour turns into actual rape. On this key occasion Lurie comes to Melanie’s flat, inveigles his way in, starts to kiss and undress her, but Melanie is concerned that her flatmate will return at any moment and so, for once, tells him ‘No’ and tries to push him away and off her. But despite all his protestations, Lurie he forces himself onto her and penetrates her and she turns her eyes away and lets him get on with it. At that point I really began to despise this creep who uses fine words and fancy quotations to dress up despicable behaviour, and dislike this book which was making me feel sick.\n\nLurie and Melanie’s ‘affair’ creates all kinds of tensions in the weekly seminar which he holds and she attends. Word gets around that the creepy old prof is screwing one of his students, Melanie’s tough leather-jacketed boyfriend intervenes a couple of times to warn Lurie off, slips threatening notes under his door and vandalises his car (p.31).\n\nThings go downhill. Melanie misses some classes and fails to hand in an essay but Lurie, feeling misguidedly protective, a) marks her as present and b) gives her a middling 70% (for a test she hadn’t taken) with a view to encouraging her to take it later. But she becomes progressively more unhappy, makes excuses, doesn’t turn up for dates, and that’s when Lurie gets her address and phone number from the college database, goes round to her house, talks his way in and despite her protestations, rapes her.\n\n‘No, not now!’ she says, struggling, ‘my cousin will be back!’ But nothing will stop him…\n\nHe sees himself in the girl’s flat, in her bedroom, with the rain pouring down outside and the heater in the corner giving off a smell of paraffin, kneeling over her, peeling off her clothes, while her arms flop like the arms of a dead person. (p.89)\n\nAnd Lurie justifies this with a typically pretentious cultural reference:\n\nHe carries her to the bedroom, brushes off the absurd slippers, kisses her feet, astonished by the feeling she evokes. Something to do with the apparition on the stage: the wig, the wiggling bottom, the crude talk. Strange love! Yet from the quiver of Aphrodite, goddess of the foaming waves, no doubt about that. (p.25)\n\n‘Yet from the quiver of Aphrodite, goddess of the foaming waves’ – what the hell is he on about? Lurie is self-justifying rape culture personified.\n\nSo I’m already regarding this novel’s protagonist as a pompous, pretentious, abusive prick even before the next development. This is that Melanie appears to try and kill herself with an overdose of pills. Suddenly her father, Mr Isaac, is on the phone to Lurie, at first asking him if he knows why his bright daughter is suddenly so depressed and has told the family she wants to quit college; then, in the next phone call, once Melanie has told her father about Lurie’s exploitative behaviour, demanding his resignation.\n\nThe tribunal\n\nMelanie’s father informs the university authorities. Lurie is suspended from teaching and issued a formal warning, then brought before a tribunal or enquiry or commission of his peers. Here, because he is a pompous narcissistic dickhead, he refuses to kowtow to the members of the enquiry and plays stupid academic games: he immediately pleads guilty to the two charges of 1) falsifying Melanie’s academic record and 2) having an affair with a student, but then obstinately refuses to express any regret for his actions or sympathy for his victim. When his colleagues on the tribunal insist that he make an apology, he does so in the most grudging way possible, making it super-clear that it’s a pro forma statement of words he doesn’t genuinely feel. Then he goes on the attack, objecting to them wanting him to show some sign of genuine repentance and turns it into some kind of issue of principle. In the middle of it all he claims to be a hero, heroically defending the right of ‘desire’ in a modern world which is determined to crush it. What a jerk.\n\nLurie’s fancy wordplay and arrogance predictably infuriates the female members of the panel. The tribunal’s role is not to punish but to advise the university Rector on what steps to take but, despite the sympathetic (male) members of the tribunal warning him that he’s risking not just his job but his pension, Lurie in his twisted mind has made it into some kind of issue of conscience, and refuses to back down.\n\nHe shrugs. ‘These are puritanical times. Private life is public business. Prurience is respectable, prurience and sentiment. They wanted a spectacle: breast-beating, remorse, tears if possible. A TV show, in fact. I wouldn’t oblige.’ (p.66)\n\nHe is a self-pitying, self-justifying, rapist prick.\n\nSummary so far\n\nSo not only does this novel feature the unbearably clichéd figure of the grumpy self-righteous middle-aged academic, but he’s a a shallowly pretentious pseud, a humourless sex pest and rapist into the bargain. Hopefully you can see why I took so strongly against the book. And that’s before we get to Coetzee’s prose style, my God!\n\nCoetzee’s prose style\n\nDespite all, he feels a tingling of desire. (p.26)\n\nYou or I might have written ‘despite everything’ but that would be common and ordinary and Coetzee’s prose insists on its specialness.\n\nAlmost he says, ‘Tell Daddy what is wrong.’ (p.26)\n\nNot ‘he almost says’, that would be common.\n\nPeople will find out, they always do; there will be whispering, there might even be scandal. But what will that matter? A last leap of the flame of sense before it goes out. (p.27)\n\nWhat a pretentious creep.\n\nShe promises, but with a promise that is not enforceable. He is vexed, irritated. She is behaving badly, getting away with too much; she is learning to exploit him and will probably exploit him further. But if she has got away with much, he has got away with more; if she is behaving badly, he has behaved worse. To the extent that they are together, if they are together, he is the one who leads, she the one who follows. Let him not forget that. (p.28)\n\nSee how a) he manages to make himself out to be the victim b) in excruciatingly pretentious phraseology: ‘Let him not forget that’. God, what a self-satisfied toad. When it’s not unbearably pretentious, Coetzee’s prose is revoltingly prim and schoolmarmish. Take his tiresome insistence on using the dying form ‘whom’.\n\nThe same afternoon there is a knock at his office door and a young man enters whom he has not seen before. (p.30)\n\nThe case is supposed to be confidential, but of course it is not, of course people talk. Why else, when he enters the common room, does a hush fall on the chatter, why does a younger colleague, with whom he has hitherto had perfectly cordial relations, put down her teacup and depart, looking straight through him as she passes? (p.42)\n\n‘For whom is this?’ he asks. (p.111) [not: ‘Who is his for?’]\n\nHe is trying to get used to looking odd, worse than odd, repulsive – one of those sorry creatures whom children gawk at in the street. (p.120)\n\nThere is one old woman over whom a particular fuss is made (p.128)\n\nThe combination of Lurie’s twisted sympathy for the girl whose life he’s messing up and Coetzee’s Mills and Boon prose style are repellent:\n\nToday, looking thin and exhausted, she sits huddled over her book. Despite himself, his heart goes out to her. Poor little bird, he thinks, whom I have held against my breast! (p.32)\n\n‘whom I have held against my breast’. What a pompous prick. When Melanie’s dad, Isaacs, first calls him, Lurie thinks:\n\nWhy not come clean? I am the worm in the apple, he should have said. How can I help you when I am the very source of your woe? (p.37)\n\nDo you think anyone who thinks and speaks in English would ever actually think or say that? No, it’s novelish prose, prose on stilts, embarrassingly conceited and knowing. When Isaacs accuses him to his face, Lurie can’t think of a response:\n\nNow is his chance indeed: let him who would speak, speak. But he stands tongue-tied, the blood thudding in his ears. A viper: how can he deny it? (p.38)\n\nSelf-dramatising, self-aggrandising, self-justifyingly clever-clever, dressing up feeble excuses in pompous prise. When he watches Melanie fill out the form complaining about his behaviour, Lurie typically melodramatises the situation, and deflects the truth, by invoking another (cheap and obvious) cultural reference, by comparing her filling in the form to the French novelist Émile Zola writing J’accuse, his famous article about the Dreyfus Affair.\n\nWhy does Coetzee write as if he’s got a poker shoved up his arse, costive schoolmarm prose from a century earlier, like prose from the upper class 1920s, only more dated, arch and showily formal? When Lurie goes for dinner with his ex-wife:\n\nThey speak of Lucy, sole issue of his first marriage, living now on a farm in the Eastern Cape. (p.43)\n\n‘Sole issue of his first marriage’ – who thinks or speaks like this or writes like this? Only an intellectual drone stuffed to overflowing with sophomore-level literature. In the tribunal scene Lurie declares himself guilty:\n\n‘…of everything Ms Isaacs avers, and of keeping false records.’ (p.49)\n\n‘Avers’? It is typical of his pompous self importance, his delusion that fancy words and clever quotes somehow clear him of the guilt of being an abuser, harasser and rapist. Slightly off at a tangent, I found it weird and irritating that he kept calling his grown-up daughter ‘my dearest’ as if in a costume drama:\n\n‘Lucy, my dearest, don’t be cross.’\n\n‘My dearest child!’ he says\n\nHe looks into her eyes. ‘My dearest, dearest . . .’ he says, and chokes on a sudden surge of tears.\n\n‘Lucy, my dearest, why don’t you want to tell?’\n\n‘At least it won’t be for ever, my dearest,’ he says.\n\nLurie routinely translates everything into a kind of histrionic self-dramatisation complete with phrases redolent of Byron-era melodrama, often with cod-Biblical portentousness.\n\nThe photograph appears in the next day’s student newspaper, above the caption ‘Who’s the Dunce Now?’ It shows him, eyes cast up to the heavens, reaching out a groping hand toward the camera.\n\nI found hundreds of sentences throughout the book an unbearable combination of pretentiousness and contrivance. At some point I realised Lurie reminds me of Lord Jacob Rees-Mogg, MP for the eighteenth century, and a figure of fun much mocked for his antiquated way of speaking. On the Radio 4 comedy show ‘Dead Ringers’ he announces his arrival not by saying ‘Hello’ but ‘Salutations’. Well, Lurie continuously exudes exactly the same sustained tone of laughably pompous formality.\n\nShe carries a tiny flashlight. They walk up the track to Petrus’s house, father and daughter arm in arm, she lighting the way, he bearing their offering. (p.128)\n\nI hope this absurd prose style is designed to reflect Lurie’s pompous, pretentious, deflecting, denying personality. But if it’s just Coetzee’s standard operating prose, God help us.\n\nThe future of English\n\nSpeaking of language, Coetzee has several passages specifically commenting on the tool of his trade, the English language. He doesn’t like it.\n\nThe language he draws on with such aplomb is, if he only knew it, tired, friable, eaten from the inside as if by termites. Only the monosyllables can still be relied on, and not even all of them. What is to be done? Nothing that he, the one-time teacher of communications, can see. Nothing short of starting all over again with the ABC. By the time the big words come back reconstructed, purified, fit to be trusted once more, he will be long dead. (p.129)\n\nSpeak, you want to reply, for yourself. It’s no surprise that Coetzee finds the English language exhausted when he has painted himself into the corner of only using the most pompous, formal and outdated version of it.\n\nThe bad news, Johnnie, is that plenty of other people are finding English a perfectly serviceable means of expression, are expanding and developing it all the time. It’s only your personal idiom which feels constricted and asphyxiating, which is a palpable dead end.\n\nAs one example from thousands, when Lurie attends Petrus’s party (details below) the atmosphere turns bad and the guests are offended, which Coetzee conveys as:\n\nNo longer is there friendliness in their aspect. (p.132)\n\nThis is not the current English language, it is Coetzee’s personal idiom, which reeks of bookishness and moth balls. Earlier, he writes of his protagonist that:\n\nMore and more he is convinced that English is an unfit medium for the truth of South Africa. Stretches of English code whole sentences long have thickened, lost their articulations, their articulateness, their articulatedness. Like a dinosaur expiring and settling in the mud, the language has stiffened. Pressed into the mould of English, Petrus’s story would come out arthritic, bygone. (p.117)\n\nI read this as an admission by Coetzee that he realises that his own personal style of English is dead, arthritic, a dying dinosaur, completely inapt for the modern world. And yet he’s trapped himself in it, and readers of his books are forced to enter the asphyxiating trap he’s made of his strangled style.\n\nPositive aspects of the prose\n\nThere is a plus side, sort of, to Coetzee’s prose, which is a quality of concision and briskness. In some passages he switches to a style made up of swift, one-word clauses. Telegraphese. I know it doesn’t go logically with the pompous orotundity I’ve just been describing but there you are. They’re both present in his style. It can be seen as a different type of contrivance.\n\nDogs and a gun; bread in the oven and a crop in the earth. Curious that he and her mother, cityfolk, intellectuals, should have produced this throwback, this sturdy young settler.\n\nHer own fingernails are none too clean. Country dirt: honourable, he supposes.\n\nMenstruation, childbirth, violation and its aftermath: blood-matters; a woman’s burden, women’s preserve. (p.104)\n\n‘Will you come in and have some tea?’ She makes the offer as if he were a visitor. Good. Visitorship, visitation: a new footing, a new start. (p.218)\n\nI’m not sure I like it but it is a) unquestionably effective and b) comes into its own in the second part of the book, which has a very different feel from the rapey, unpleasant first section.\n\n‘Disgrace’: part two\n\nWith nothing to stop him, suspended from his job, disgraced among all his colleagues, Lurie drives out to the rural home of his grown-up daughter Lucy. It used to be a commune living in a big old farmhouse, now they’ve all left except Lucy and her ‘friend’, Helen, who Lurie doesn’t much like.\n\nLucy shows her dad (and the reader) round the ‘estate’, the septic tank, the water reservoir, the dam, the beehives, the flower garden. She makes a core living by running a dog kennel, backed up by selling flowers and garden produce at local markets. Which is why Lurie feels she is a scion of the original Boer settlers, very unlike her two metropolitan, intellectual parents.\n\nLurie has invited himself to come and stay on Lucy’s smalholding indefinitely, and this section moves away from the smart-arse cultural references of part one, in favour of blood and soil, dogs and crops, guns and physical labour. To which a brisker, telegraphic style is more appropriate.\n\n‘Petrus, come in, meet my father,’ says Lucy. Petrus wipes his boots. They shake hands. A lined, weathered face; shrewd eyes. Forty? Forty-five? (p.64)\n\nA cool winter’s day, the sun already dipping over red hills dotted with sparse, bleached grass. Poor land, poor soil, he thinks. Exhausted. Good only for goats. (p.65)\n\nMind you, even out here in the country, Coetzee’s prose routinely reverts to Jane Austen formality. When he asks his daughter after the first night whether the dogs bark every night, she replies:\n\n‘One gets used to it. I’m sorry.’\n\nI can’t imagine my daughter or any of her friends ever saying ‘one’ like that, as if they are the queen. And again:\n\nDoes one speak to one’s father like that? (p.159)\n\nWhat if, after an attack like that, one is never oneself again? What if an attack like that turns one into a different and darker person altogether? (p.111)\n\n‘Science has not yet put a limit on how long one has to wait.’ (p.125)\n\nOne, one, one. Alongside whom, whom, whom.\n\nNever before have he and Lucy spoken about his intimate life. It is not proving easy. But if not to her, then to whom can he speak? (p.69)\n\nContinually the prose walks on stilts. You or I might have written: ‘If he can’t talk to her, who can he talk to?’ but you feel that to write something as straightforward and natural as this would, for Coetzee, drag him down into the gutter of the common herd, down into the scruffy masses. His characters must say ‘one’ and ‘whom’ and quote Villon and walk on a superior plane. It comes over as a psychological compulsion to feel special and superior.\n\nIt is pretentious in the most literal sense of pretending to a wisdom and authority it doesn’t have. When he does try some of the ‘wisdom’ or learning which novelists like to throw in amid their stories, Coetzee’s musings are limp and disappointing, nothing at all special. Reflecting on his daughter’s life as a farmer he thinks:\n\nShe talks easily about these matters. A frontier farmer of the new breed. In the old days, cattle and maize. Today, dogs and daffodils. The more things change the more they remain the same. History repeating itself, though in a more modest vein. Perhaps history has learned a lesson.\n\nNumber 1) how characteristic of Lurie to throw in a tired French tag (‘plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose’) which immediately drags the whole intellectual level down to dinner party tattle.\n\nBut 2) how flaccid, how embarrassingly banal is the conclusion to this paragraph: ‘Perhaps history has learned a lesson.’ This is grand sounding but to all practical purposes meaningless, how can the abstraction ‘history’ learn anything? It would have been less nonsensical if he’d written ‘Perhaps people have learned a lesson from history’ but this would still be trite and untrue.\n\nThis kind of empty rhetoric exactly fulfils the dictionary definition of ‘grandiloquent’ meaning ‘pompous or extravagant in language, style, or manner, especially in a way that is intended to impress’.\n\nWhile I’m obsessing about his style, Coetzee has the same phobia of ending a sentence with a ‘dangling’ preposition as Giles Foden has:\n\nThe commentary alternates between Sotho and Xhosa, languages of which he understands not a word (p.75)\n\nI was also irritated by Coetzee’s insistence on writing in the narrative – and having all the characters say – the full written-out version of phrases almost all normal human beings contract i.e. writing ‘do not’, ‘have not’ instead of the everyday ‘don’t’ or ‘haven’t’. So obtrusive was this mannerism that the small handful of times when someone did use a contraction stood out like a fire alarm. So when Bev says, ‘Lucy doesn’t speak about her either,’ it is a rare instance of realistic dialogue, of demotic English as people actually speak it.\n\nThen there’s the main character’s tiresome obsession that everything’s going to the dogs, maybe the most mind-damagingly banal cliché of all time:\n\nHe shrugs. ‘These are puritanical times. Private life is public business. Prurience is respectable.’\n\nLucy has not led a protected life. Why should they not be open with each other, why should they\n\ndraw lines, in times when no one else does? (p.76)\n\n‘The case you want me to make is a case that can no longer be made… not in our day. If I tried to make it I would not be heard.’ (p.89)\n\nLucy: ‘You should try to be a good person too.’\n\nLurie: ‘I suspect it is too late for me. I’m just an old lag serving out my sentence. But you go ahead. You are well on the way.’\n\nA good person. Not a bad resolution to make, in dark times. (p.216)\n\nIn these sentences you can see how this ‘everything’s gone to the dogs’ cliché is really a form of self pity. It’s too late for me. Once upon a time I would have had a fair hearing but not in our day. Well, boo hoo for the rapist. For in Lurie’s pompous opinion, it’s the times that are wrong, not him. He sounds like the Daily Mail railing against wokeness and immigrants and the modern world in general. The worst kind of reactionary, a boring reactionary.\n\n‘The insurance will not give me a new car,’ he explains, trying to be patient. ‘Assuming it isn’t bankrupt by now because of all the car-theft in this country…’ (p.137)\n\nHe buys a small television set to replace the one that was stolen. In the evenings, after supper, he and Lucy sit side by side on the sofa watching the news and then, if they can bear it, the entertainment. (p.141)\n\nThis first section overflows with instances of Lurie’s self-satisfied, unsinkable high opinion of himself.\n\nShe teases him as her mother used to tease him. Her wit, if anything, sharper. He has always been drawn to women of wit. Wit and beauty. (p.78)\n\nOf course he has always been drawn to women of wit, wit and beauty – because he is a legend, a legend in his own mind. What a plonker.\n\nChapter 10: Bev Shaw\n\nHaving moved in with his daughter, Lurie tries to make make himself useful. He helps pick flowers and load them and veg into the van and drive off to the market where he helps man her stall. He wants to fit in and help.\n\nLucy has a friend, Bev Shaw, who runs what sounds like a veterinary clinic, the Animal Welfare League. She suggests Lurie goes to help out. This is where the novel, maybe, begins to turn a corner. Lurie is still a pompous ass, given to showy literary references –\n\nhe showily tells us that the word ‘lethal’ derives from the classical legend of the River Lethe which the souls of the dead had to be rowed across, page 83) but for the first time someone else really enters the narrative\n\nhe has to tell us that the English word ‘friend’ derives from the Old English ‘freond’ from freon, to love (p.102)\n\nhe has to tell us that ‘peasant’ derives from the French word paysan which is rooted in the word pays meaning country, so a ‘country-man’ (p.117)\n\nAnd so on, boring us to death with his pointless erudition. Anyway, Lurie, in his objectifying sexist way, initially takes against Bev because she is extraordinarily ugly, with no neck.\n\nHer hair is a mass of little curls. Does she make the curls herself, with tongs? Unlikely: it would take hours every day. They must grow that way. He has never seen such a tessitura from close by. The veins on her ears are visible as a filigree of red and purple. The veins of her nose too. And then a chin that comes straight out of her chest, like a pouter pigeon’s. As an ensemble, remarkably unattractive. (p.82)\n\nNote how even when he’s been objectionably objectifying, Lurie can’t stop using uses fancy foreign words – tessitura is, apparently, Italian for ‘texture’, although is mostly used to denote a classical singer’s vocal range – so Lurie’s using it in a metaphorical way; filigree means ‘ornamental work of fine wire formed into delicate tracery – to dress up his repellently objectifying male gaze.\n\nSympathetic readers (like the Booker Prize and Nobel Prize judges) might take this as wonderfully literary, applying sophisticated terminology and insights to bring his descriptions to life. Alternatively, like me, you could see these as examples of Lurie’s power play, his strategy of conning the reader (and anyone he’s showing off to) into thinking pretty run-of-the-mill, sexist and unpleasant observations are somehow profound and ‘literary’.\n\nAnyway, back in the plot, Bev’s persistence with the series of sick animals which are brought in by her very poor clients eventually impresses Lurie. Her way with animals but also her philosophising about them – about how we humans treat them with contempt – as things, leads to speculation about whether animals have souls.\n\nAfter a particularly upsetting case of a goat which has been mauled by dogs and badly infected, Lurie realises that Bev doesn’t offer cures, she is more or less a putting-down service (hence the reference to lethal/Lethe, the river of Death), that she puts down all the animals herself, and that it upsets her terribly. Slowly Lurie overcomes his initial dislike of Bev (for not making enough effort to be a sex object for him) and begins to respect her dedication.\n\nChapter 11: The attack\n\nWithout any warning three men attack the house. They easily knock Lurie out and he regains consciousness to find himself locked in the toilet which has a big oak door, too heavy to break down. Out the window he sees the burglars stealing bin bags full of stuff, then watches one of them systematically shoots all Lucy’s dogs in the kennel.\n\nThen the loo door is opened and one of them threatens Lurie with a bottle to get him to hand over the keys to his car. He tries to shove past but they trip him to the ground and pour meths all over him and light a match. He feels his hair, eyebrows, face on fire, crawls back to the loo, pours water from the pan over himself to douse the flames. The lids of his eye are stuck together. His right hand hurts a lot. He hears the roar of his car as the attackers drive off. He goes looking for Lucy but she has already showered and cleaned. They’ve let down the tyres of her kombi truck and smashed the phone but she is utterly self possessed and tells Lurie she’s going to walk to the nearest house to raise the alarm.\n\nChapter 12\n\nLucy gets the neighbour, Ettinger, to drive Lurie to the nearest hospital for his burns. Couple of hours wait then treatment. Nothing too serious. Bill Shaw waits for him and drives him back to their house. Lucy has already gone to bed. In the middle of the night Lurie is convinced he has a vision of her and goes to her bedroom. Somehow, during all the confusion, Lurie realises, becomes convinced, that while he was locked in the loo his daughter was gang raped.\n\nIn the morning Lucy is crying but then talks to him as if he were the child who needed helping through the psychological aftermath. She insists is going back to the farm despite his objections.\n\nChapter 13\n\nIndeed Lurie suddenly feels old, like an old man, past caring. Happy to let Bev Shaw change his dressings as he helped her do for animals at the clinic. Back at the farmhouse a few days later, Lucy has cleared up and the police visit, interview them, take notes, and leave. Lurie realises she didn’t mention the rape to the police, underplayed the time the entire episode took so as not to have to account for the time.\n\nAfterwards Lurie interrogates her on why she won’t report it. Overflowing with overthinking, with references to Christian theology or modern therapy, Lurie pesters her why she won’t report it. Because, Lucy says, very firmly, it is a private matter. It is her thing. Nobody else can tell her what to do.\n\nChapter 14\n\nLucy keeps to herself, expresses no feelings, shows no interest in anything around her.\n\nPetrus, the old black guy she shares the land and some of the work with, returns from wherever he’s been with his wife, bringing corrugated iron and two sheep with a view to improving his own shareholding and rough house.\n\nAbsolutely nothing whatsoever about his literal or symbolic role in the plot interested me, but I was interested in this snapshot of the economic realities of rural South Africa in the mid-1990s i.e. the crushing poverty with the smallest conceivable businesses starting out from the lowest possible base. I wanted to stop reading the novel here but forced myself to read on.\n\nLurie goes with Petrus to the market instead of Lucy but trade is not to good. Lucy is going downhill. Lies in bed all day or sits on the sofa sucking her thumb. Doesn’t want to eat. Lurie has ended up doing all the housework plus cooking novel dishes to try and get her to eat.\n\nChapter 15\n\nPetrus’s tethered sheep’s bleating is getting on Lurie’s nerves. In fact he dislikes Petrus. He strongly suspects the old black guy had something to do with the attack and rape and this gets mixed up with Lurie’s increasing sympathy with dumb animals i.e. the two tethered bleating sheep. What right do we have to slaughter them for our own purposes etc?\n\nPetrus holds a big party, Lurie and Lucy go, they are the only whites, everyone has dressed up, the music is African jazz and people start dancing. Then Lucy spots one of the attackers, there, at Petrus’s party. Lurie shoulders through the crowd, outside to the back of the building where the barbecue is being held, and confronts the man, the youngest of the three attackers. But this youth shouts back, trembling with anger. It is strongly implied it is almost uncontrollable anger against white people in general, who still have all the good things of life while he and his people continue to live in poverty.\n\nLurie asks Lucy to confirm the boy’s identity but Lucy refuses, insists on leaving the party straight away, going back to their house, where she refuses to call the police. It is her thing and he has no right to dictate to her.\n\n‘Don’t shout at me, David. This is my life. I am the one who has to live here. What happened to me is my business, mine alone, not yours, and if there is one right I have it is the right not to be put on trial like this, not to have to justify myself- not to you, not to anyone else.’ (p.133)\n\nChapter 16\n\nDavid helps Petrus lay water pipes and tries to tackle him about the youth at his party. Petrus insists the youth is innocent, and insists Lucy will be safe living on at the farm, He, Petrus, will protect her. Well, you didn’t protect her last time, says Lurie. I will protect her, replies Petrus in his stolid, undeflectable English. Lurie is angry with multiple frustrations.\n\nIn a separate thread, Lurie volunteers more and more to help at the Animal Welfare clinic and more and more understands it is a place where people come to simply get rid of animals which have become surplus to requirements, especially dogs. He helps Bev with countless euthenasias (watching her calm injection of the poison) but instead of getting used to it finds himself getting more and more upset, more jittery each time. Driving from the clinic back to the farm he is often in tears. I wondered if this was, at least to some extent, an expression of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nLurie thinks the other dogs can smell the disgrace of dying, as the killings are carried out. And by now it’s obvious that the book is about multiple disgraces:\n\nLurie’s disgraceful behaviour with his student\n\nhis public disgracing and shaming (by the university but also by the press who sensationally reported his sacking)\n\nthe ‘disgrace’ of Lucy’s rape (at least, as Lurie sees it)\n\nand now this addition, the disgrace of our treatment of dumb helpless animals\n\nand, behind it all, the ultimate disgrace, for all mortal things, the disgrace of death\n\nDescription of the incinerator at the nearby hospital where Lurie drives all the dead dogs they’ve killed, and which he personally loads into the furnace. His grim sense of inexplicable duty. He reflects that there are just too many of them, they breed to excess. Which, of course, he can’t let pass without injecting a literary reference, in this case quoting ‘because we are to menny’, the note left behind by Jude’s son who kills his two younger siblings and then hangs himself in Thomas Hardy’s macabre tragedy, Jude the Obscure.\n\nChapter 17\n\nConversation with Bev at the clinic. He still finds her ‘a plain little creature’ (p.148). At a pregnant psychological moment, on an impulse, he runs his finger along her lips. To his amazement, she kisses his finger. They lock up and leave the clinic without a word. A few days later she calls to make an assignation at the clinic on Monday, its closed day. Methodically, she gets blankets out of a cupboard, makes up a bed, and they have sex. Oh dear oh dear. Novels and sex. Like academics and gender. Moths to a flame. Plus which, with characteristic gracelessness, Lurie finds her ugly but fucks her anyway.\n\nSlipping off his underpants, he gets in beside her, runs his hands down her body. She has no breasts to speak of. Sturdy, almost waistless, like a squat little tub. (p.149)\n\nHe does what he regards as his duty without any pleasure. This, he reflects gloomily, is what I’ve been reduced to. Fucking squat little tubs. What a charmer he is, eh?\n\nAfter the sweet young flesh of Melanie Isaacs, this is what I have come to. This is what I will have to get used to, this and even less than this. (p.150)\n\nThis is maudlin self pity masquerading as soulfulness, pretending to be ‘thought’. Inevitably, the situation brings to mind yet another literary reference, in this case his second reference to Emma Bovary.\n\nChapter 18\n\nPetrus hires a tractor and quickly ploughs up his part of the farmland. His star is rising. Lurie asks Petrus if he’ll look after the farm if Lucy takes a break. He feels the ignominy of becoming supplicant to a black man. Petrus uses the word ‘boy’ of himself with conscious irony. Not so long ago he was a ‘boy’ to the white apartheid masters. Now the white man is asking his help.\n\nThe police in New Brighton call to say Lurie’s stolen car has been recovered and two men charged with stealing it. He and Lucy drive to the police pound but he’s disappointed to discover it’s not in fact his car. Sitting in her van outside the police station, Lurie has another go at getting Lucy to do something, either inform the cops or move away from the farm. She slumps in tears.\n\nOn the drive back she finally tells him that what shook her was the way she was raped with such anger. Where did the anger come from? In fact, it’s the first time she’s actually confirmed that she was raped. Up till now Lurie has merely deduced it, assumed it. This is her first confirmation.\n\nLurie, typically, intellectualises it. Says the anger was historical, it was the history of white injustice against blacks expressing itself through them. The rape was symbolic. Revenge, justice, or something. Just as typically, Lucy rejects this grand vision and focuses on the opposite, the fact that it was so personal.\n\nLucy says she thinks they’ve done it before. In fact she thinks rape is their thing, the robbery is just a perk. She thinks she is in their territory and has been marked. Lurie begs her to leave. But Lucy sets off on an uncharacteristic speculation, wondering whether being raped is the price she’ll have to pay for living on at the farm. He says they want her to be their slave. She says it’s more like subjugation (p.159).\n\nLate that night Lurie writes a note begging her to leave and slips it under her door. She writes a counternote saying he doesn’t understand. She is a ‘dead person’ but she is going to stay to see if she can come back to life. And I thought – these bookish types and their endless writing.\n\nCut to Lurie and Bev lying in the blankets on the floor of the clinic, having had sex again. Bev asks about his ex-wives. Lurie explains one of them went back to live in Holland. That’s why he’s encouraging Lucy to go there, to be with family, to be safe.\n\nChapter 19\n\nFor some reason (because he’s a self-centred plonker?) Lurie has driven all the way to visit the father (Mr Isaacs) of the student he abused (Melanie Isaacs). Coetzee pushes home what a creep Lurie is by having the door opened by Melanie’s younger sister, Desiree, and Lurie immediately explode with sexual fantasies, imagining what this schoolgirl would be like naked, what she would look like during sex, imagining a three in a bed session with her and Melanie, ‘an experience fit for a king’ (p.164). So the robbery, the assault, his daughter’s rape, haven’t really changed his core creepiness.\n\nDesiree tells Lurie her dad’s still at school so he drives on to the school where Isaacs is a teacher, is ushered into the office and, for some reason, insists on telling him ‘his side of the story’. Basically, that it was an irresponsible fling by a middle-aged philanderer but he was surprised that it caught real fire. Then he stops. There’s a pause, he stands, shakes hands. Isaacs, a small beaky man, is astonishingly restrained. Surprisingly, he invites Lurie to come have dinner with his family, at their trim clean suburban home. Here Lurie meets the pretty daughter again, and the wife once, obviously, a beauty. (All women are clinically assessed by Lurie for their sexual potential.)\n\nThe mother and daughter know about him. The mother says one sentence all evening (‘Mind, it’s hot’), the younger daughter is embarrassed and silent, but Lurie and Isaacs keep up a regular conversation with the former telling lots of stuff about his daughter’s farm out in the sticks.\n\nOnly at the end, as he’s leaving, does Lurie apologise for the trouble he’s caused. Turns out Isaacs was only waiting for this apology all along and now proceeds to invoke God. I’m surprised – with a name like Isaacs I thought he’d be Jewish and his Jewishness would be part of the story. Turns out he and his family are devout Christians.\n\nAn improbably theoretical dialogue follows, with Isaacs asking Lurie what he thinks God wants from him and Lurie saying he is living in disgrace, isn’t that enough?\n\nFoolishly, on one of his impulses, Lurie blunders down the hallway and into the bedroom where the mother and daughter are talking. They freeze. Like an idiot he kneels down and puts his forehead to the floor. Kneeling back up and looking at them a bolt of lust goes through his body. What a maniac. Does he think they don’t realise what he is?\n\nLater, Isaacs phones him at his room at a hotel and says he hopes he, Lurie, didn’t call by because he expected Isaacs to intervene with the university authorities to have him reinstated. Lurie honestly replies the thought never occurred to him. Isaacs says good. God has assigned him a different path, a new life. He must follow it.\n\nChapter 20\n\nAfter this strange interlude, Lurie drives on to his house in Cape Town to discover it’s been burgled, everything stolen, computer, stereo, even the kitchen stripped bare, ransacked. Here, too, the barbarians have attacked. Lurie explicitly links the burglary with retribution for a century or more of white oppression:\n\nNo ordinary burglary. A raiding party moving in, cleaning out the site, retreating laden with bags, boxes, suitcases. Booty; war reparations; another incident in the great campaign of redistribution. (p.176)\n\nWell, what did you expect Mr Daily Mail? That the legacy of white privilege would go on untroubled? When he sinks into depression, can’t bring himself to tidy up, contact the utilities companies to get the phone and electricity turned back on, I couldn’t help smiling. He walks to the university only to find his old office now occupied by some young whippersnapper who’s packed all his stuff into a box. When he goes to take the box to the library he finds his pass has expired. This descent into shabby has-beenery is kind of touching. But he is such premiere class creep, I couldn’t help feeling secretly pleased.\n\nLurie rings Lucy from a payphone. She’s polite but doesn’t want him to come back to the farm.\n\nHe bumps into acquaintances who blank him. Bumps into the head of his department at the supermarket who can’t wait to get through the checkout quick enough to shake him off. Yes, he is in disgrace.\n\nThere is an extended passage where Lurie ponders the opera he’s thinking about writing about Byron, about his affair with the Italian contessa, Teresa Guiccioli. Lurie had thought it would feature Byron and be set in the summer they spent at the contessa’s husband’s villa. But the double disgrace of his sacking from the university, and his experiences at the farm, have made him feel old. Now he imagines his opera being set well after Byron’s death (aged 35, in Greece) and featuring the middle-aged Teresa, living on long afterwards, stuck tending her ageing father, with only a box of letters from the grand English Milord and a handful of memories to live on.\n\nThis is all ably done but reads exactly like all the thousands and thousands of other novels which feature a fictional writer or academic mulling over their new novel or play or whatever. Some of the Byron background is mildly interesting, but as a concept, the fictional author pondering his next work, at length, has been done to death and feels as threadbare and exhausted as a subject as Lurie thinks English itself is (see above).\n\nAt least Lurie has the self awareness to mock his pretensions. When he tries to compose music on the piano he finds it too rich and formal. With comic inappropriateness he ends up digging out an old banjo he bought for Lucy as a child and composing plinky-plonk melodies on that.\n\nLurie imagines the scene of Byron first lifting up the skirts of his 18-year-old Italian hottie while they rested on a horse ride somewhere, and fucking her (of course he does). But the entire passage only comes to life when he finds, unprompted, the idea of Byron’s neglected 5-year-old daughter forcing itself into the composition, with the repeated line ‘so hot, so hot’ sung as she lies dying of malaria in the convent where Byron had shut her away, her pathetic cries cutting across the guilty whisperings of the bad father.\n\nThis has been a horrible book, written in a wretched style about a disgusting man but, in moments like this, the timelessness of some of the scenarios, particularly Lurie’s sense of parental fatherly guilt over his daughter, cut through the crap and really bite.\n\nChapter 21\n\nLurie goes for lunch with one of his ex-wives (Rosalind). He, of course, has flashbacks to them writhing on a hot bed, naked.\n\nShe is repelled by his burned ear (the only part of his body which actually caught fire during the attack). She is worried about Lucy. Lurie doesn’t tell her about the attack let alone, God forbid, the rape.\n\nRosalind says she saw Melanie in the play she was rehearsing at the time of the affair. She thought it trite and overdone. Lurie ponders going to see Melanie. He gives a typically self-serving, self-flattering interpretation of the famous tribunal which led to his sacking. Again, note in the following passage how the literary reference – to the Greek figures of Cronus and Harmony – is used to deflect and distract away from his guilt.\n\nThe marriage of Cronus and Harmony: unnatural. That was what the trial was set up to punish, once all the fine words were stripped away. On trial for his way of life. For unnatural acts: for broadcasting old seed, tired seed, seed that does not quicken, contra naturam. If the old men hog the young women, what will be the future of the species? That, at bottom, was the case for the prosecution. Half of literature is about it: young women struggling to escape from under the weight of old men, for the sake of the species. (p.191)\n\nThis is bullshit. He still does not accept that it is unprofessional and illegal, and a clear abuse of power, for a professor to seduce a student. And he caps this farrago with yet another tiresome literary reference, this time to Yeats’s supersonically famous poem, Sailing to Byzantium. Here’s the Coetzee:\n\nHe sighs. The young in one another’s arms, heedless, engrossed in the sensual music. No country, this, for old men. (p.190)\n\nAnd here the verse he’s quoting:\n\nThat is no country for old men. The young\n\nIn one another’s arms, birds in the trees,\n\n—Those dying generations—at their song,\n\nThe salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,\n\nFish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long\n\nWhatever is begotten, born, and dies.\n\nCaught in that sensual music all neglect\n\nMonuments of unageing intellect.\n\nLurie’s pretentious cultural referencing would be bearable if he had anything interesting to say about the poems or philosophers or theologians he namedrops. But he never does. They’re just crutches for the text and reference-dropping to impress the gullible. To drop a little culture bomb of my own and quote W.H. Auden from, aptly enough, his Letter to Lord Byron:\n\nIt’s pleasant as it’s easy to secure\n\nThe hero worship of the immature.\n\nLurie goes along to the theatre to see Melanie perform. The play is clunky agitprop farce but she is good. Characteristically, he imagines Melanie naked. When the audience around him laugh and applaud he feels like shouting out what amounts to ‘I’ve ‘ad ‘er, I ‘ave.’ Able to quote Wordsworth at the drop of a hat but mind like a Soho porn shop.\n\nThinking of Melanie naked prompts a memory of a tourist hitchhiker he picked up, drove to a motel and screwed, and this triggers a tsunami or memories of the many, many women he’s slept with (what a legend!) which in turn triggers a characteristic literary reference, this time to the medieval poem Piers Plowman:\n\nIn a sudden and soundless eruption, as if he has fallen into a waking dream, a stream of images pours down, images of women he has known on two continents, some from so far away in time that he barely recognizes them. Like leaves blown on the wind, pell-mell, they pass before him. A fair field full of-folk: hundreds of lives all tangled with his. (p.192)\n\nAnybody who’s studied English should spot the reference or at least recognise that the alliteration (those f’s) is indicating a literary source. But there’s also the sly appositeness in Lurie quoting it is as if he has fallen into a waking dream as that, as anybody who knows about Piers Plowman knows, is how the poem starts, with the poet falling asleep and dreaming a dream. Some might interpret this as Coetzee enriching his text with literary references. Some might find it an appropriate depicting of the thought processes of a professor of literature. Or it could be regarded as tedious tricksiness.\n\nOn a more mundane level, did he just brag about sleeping with hundreds of women? Truly a legend in his own mind.\n\nAt which point he is hit by a little pellet of crushed paper. Then another. Then the sound of hissing. It’s Melanie’s boyfriend in his leather jacket, throwing them at him. Lurie stands and squeezes along the row of seats to the aisle and so out into the car park. Here the angry boyfriend, Ryan, confronts him. Uh oh.\n\nTypically, as Lurie and Ryan have a stand-off, a Latin tag pops into the pompous, burned old man’s mind: ‘Omnis gens quaecumque se in se pecere vult’ – which he himself parses as ‘The seed of generation, driven to perfect itself, driving deep into the woman’s body, driving to bring the future into being. (p.194) Yet again, literary quotation is used to deflect and hide the actual reality of what he did, of who he is.\n\nRyan tells Lurie to back off and leave Melanie alone, a not unreasonable request. Driving home Lurie realises his hands are shaking. The streetwalkers are out in force., He stops and gets one, drives somewhere dark. She is stoned or drunk, and younger even than Melanie. He pays her to give him a blowjob but she passes out in her lap. Look on the bright side, at least she didn’t throw up over his groin. He’s a sleazeball.\n\nChapter 22\n\nLurie keeps phoning Lucy who tells him everything is alright but it obviously isn’t. He calls Bev who says Lucy must tell you herself. So he flies to Durban, hires a car (he probably doesn’t think of himself as rich, but this is rich behaviour from where I’m sitting, flying, hiring) and drives to the farm. Petrus’s land is now fenced off and he’s built a proper farmhouse. He, black, is rising; Lucy, white, is falling. The seesaw of history.\n\nLucy answers the door in a nightdress and looks a wreck. She drops a massive bombshell by telling him she is pregnant. From that day. By the rapists. Lurie is appalled, asks all kind of intrusive questions and it’s at this point that she delivers the Author’s Message:\n\nDavid, I can’t run my life according to whether or not you like what I do. Not any more. You behave as if everything I do is part of the story of your life. You are the main character, I am a minor character who doesn’t make an appearance until halfway through. Well, contrary to what you think, people are not divided into major and minor. I am not minor. I have a life of my own, just as important to me as yours is to you, and in my life I am the one who makes the decisions.’ (p.198)\n\nMaybe all the literary references are designed as evidence for this fundamental accusation, that Lurie lives in his head, in a world of literary archetypes, and is completely unable to relate to other people realistically, to accept them for who they are, especially to accept women as people rather than dolly birds created purely for his sexual pleasure. That his insistent literary allusions are as selfish as his sex obsession.\n\nOn this reading, the persistent literary references, like the obsessive sexualising of women, along with the ‘going to the dogs’ trope, are three aspects of Lurie’s inability to face reality. They are all, in their ways, coping mechanisms.\n\nAnyway, Lucy tells him the boy is back, the third of the rapists, the one they saw at Petrus’s party, he is now living at Petrus’s place, turns out to be a brother of Petrus’s wife, has been kicked out of school, Petrus has a family obligation. His name, improbably enough, is Pollux (some kind of reference to the twins from Greek mythology, Castor and Pollux?).\n\nFurious, Lurie clambers over the wire fence onto Petrus’s land to confront the old black guy (Petrus has a grizzled beard and smokes an old-fashioned pipe). To his amazement, Petrus starts out by defending his wife’s brother, saying he has to look after family, just like Lurie is looking after his family. Then flabbergasts him by saying that he, Petrus, will marry Lucy. She needs to be defended. It is not safe for a single woman at the farm.\n\nWhen Lurie goes back to Lucy with what is, in effect, a proposal of marriage, he is astonished that she accepts. She knows that Petrus really only wants the land. She will marry him, he will get the land and her as a wife or concubine or whatever. That way she will come under his wing and his formal protection. Lucy’s only proviso is that the house must remain legally hers.\n\nLurie begs her to go to Holland or come back to the city with him, but she refuses. Partly this is because she has become an allegorical figure. She is white person redux, reduced to nothing, starting again with nothing, the historic debt wiped clean.\n\n‘Yes, I agree, it is humiliating. But perhaps that is a good point to start from again. Perhaps that is what I must learn to accept. To start at ground level. With nothing. Not with nothing but. With nothing. No cards, no weapons, no property, no rights, no dignity.’\n\n‘Like a dog.’\n\n‘Yes, like a dog.’ (p.205)\n\nAnd with this preposterous gesture of abasement, the fictional character of Lucy becomes symbolic of something massive, of the huge historical wrong done to the black people of Africa and the humiliating guilt of the white colonists and oppressors and beneficiaries from apartheid, and of the new situation where the blacks have the upper hand and the whites have to face up to an entirely new reality.\n\nAt this moment, the novel steps into the realm of allegory or symbolism – or a great huge organ chord eclipses everything which went before. With one bound what had previously been irritating and repellent somehow becomes quite awesome in its power. For me, at any rate, the reading experience utterly changed.\n\nChapter 23\n\nReturning from walking the bulldog, Katy, Lurie finds Pollux by the wall of the farm peeking in through the window. He catches Pollux unawares, slaps him a couple of times, the boy falls to the ground where Katy mauls him and Lurie kicks him. So much for western civilisation, for Wordsworth and the ‘inner archetype’.\n\nLucy comes running up, pulls the dog away and the boy staggers to his feet uttering the heartfelt: ‘I will kill you’ and then highly symbolic: ‘We will kill you all!’ Exactly. Exactly Lurie’s (and Coetzee’s?) fear.\n\nThe incident leads to an argument between Lurie and Lucy who tells him everything had settled down before he came back and stirred it all up again. She had found a balance, a calm. He had better leave. He realises that he:\n\nmust change [his] life. Well, he is too old to heed, too old to change. Lucy may be able to bend to the tempest; he cannot, not with honour. (p.209)\n\nHe drives to see Bev. We haven’t had a literary allusion for a while so I’m not surprised when an image from Dante comes into his mind, from the Inferno, Lurie has a vision of South Africa as ‘the great marsh of Styx, with souls boiling up in it like mushrooms’ (p.209).\n\nLurie redux: Bev tells a dismayed Lurie that he can help out at the clinic. He buys a pickup truck to transport the bodies of the dead dogs. He rents a room in a seedy boarding house. He works at the clinic seven days a week and fixes up a snug out back where he cooks his meals, dozes, idly tinkers with the supposed Byron opera.\n\nOne morning he glances up to see the faces of three little boys peering at him over the concrete wall. He rises from his seat; the dogs start barking; the boys drop down and scamper off whooping with excitement. What a tale to tell back home: a mad old man who sits among the dogs singing to himself? (p.212)\n\nChapter 24\n\nLurie is immerse in the opera but it is going nowhere. He no longer has the mental energy. He returns to the same scene over and again, Teresa howling with longing. He has ‘adopted’ a seriously ill dog from Bev’s kennels. No-one wants it. It will be put down soon. It sits at his feet in the sun while Lurie plunks at his banjo fantasising about writing a successful chamber opera which will astound his enemies and reinstate his place in society. Pathetic, and he knows it.\n\nHe drives Lucy to the market. Afterwards takes her for lunch. She is swelling with pregnancy. One day he drives to the farm but stops a distance away and observes her working in the flower beds then softly walks up behind her, head full of portentous thoughts, how she has become a peasant, how her child will carry her lineage forward until he is forgotten etc etc.\n\nCharacteristically, he thinks he must have another look at Victor Hugo, ‘poet of grandfatherhood’. Looking at Lucy working he thinks of Goethe’s phrase about das ewig Weibliche, the Eternal Feminine (from Goethe’s Faust).\n\nFor some reason, since the allegorical turn the book took in chapter 22, this kind of fanciful grandiloquence and literary name-dropping no longer seem out of place. It’s as if the narrative has caught up with the orotundity of the style which was there from the start. It’s an eerie effect.\n\nThe final passage in the whole book, just two pages, describes a typical Sunday’s work at the clinic for Lurie, handling the sick cats and dogs, one by one, as Bev whispers tenderly to them and administers the lethal injection. Twenty-three in total.\n\nThe maimed dog that sits at his feet while he tinkers with the banjo in the sun? He had been saving him, putting off the black day. Now, on impulse, Lurie takes him up in his arms and carries him into the operating room where Bev is surprised because she knows how much the dog means to him. The last words of the novel are heavily pregnant with meaning:\n\nBearing him in his arms like a lamb, he re-enters the surgery. ‘I thought you would save him for another week,’ says Bev Shaw. ‘Are you giving him up?’\n\n‘Yes, I am giving him up.’ (p.220)\n\nAmong many other echoes and connotations, this phrase symbolises the way Lurie has been forced to give up all his dreams: of being a great scholar; of being some kind of Byronic lover; of writing a great opera; of having a happy family; all his hopes for his daughter’s successful career, all his dreams and fantasies. He has been much reduced. And now he is giving up the only thing left in the world that trusted him. He is empty. He is ready.\n\nJesus, how did a book I started out loathing, and despised heavily almost all the way through, end up becoming so profound and moving?\n\nRape and South Africa\n\nIn 2012 Interpol named South Africa the rape capital of the world.\n\nIt is estimated that over 40% of South African women will be raped in their lifetime (Wikipedia).\n\nThe TEAR charity estimated that a woman born in South Africa has a greater chance of being raped than learning to read.\n\nRace and South Africa\n\nThe novel is set in South Africa where the majority population is, of course, black. (I looked it up: Black African 81.4%, Coloured 8.2%, White 7.3%, Indian/Asian 2.7%, other 0.4%.) So it’s an oddity that Coetzee nowhere indicates which characters are black – for example, Petrus who helps on the farm or the customers at the market or the clients who bring their animals to Bev Shaw’s. You have to guess from their names (or lack of names) or the context, whether characters are black or not.\n\nIn fact, reflecting on this, I realised that none of the black characters, apart from Petrus, are given names at all – while the Europeans and Asians (in the university scenes) are all given their full first and surnames.\n\nThe novel is almost entirely about white characters (who are generally ‘good’), Asian characters (who lead the enquiry against Lurie, so are ambivalent), with the three rapists being unnamed and black.\n\nIntelligence and culture, finer feelings and psychology, the novel implies, belong almost exclusively to sensitive, cultured, white people (people who can quote Byron and Wordsworth), while people who don’t speak English (larded with fancy foreign tags), people who speak Xhosa or other African languages for example, are excluded from the novel’s discourse.\n\nI could be a bit inflammatory and say the book replicates a kind of cultural apartheid, one more reason for finding it a highly problematic production.\n\nThe historical moment of ‘Disgrace’\n\nAs to understanding the situation in South Africa, ‘Disgrace’ feels like it comes from a very specific historical moment, the later 1990s, after the end of apartheid and the ANC had been elected to government, but it was starting to realise how difficult it was going to be to make the sweeping reforms and improvements so many blacks had hoped for, for so long.\n\nI stumbled across a section on ‘Disgrace’ on the Gradesaver website which has much useful background information. For example:\n\n‘Post-apartheid South Africa was by no means idyllic, however. Violence increased significantly in the country. Incidents of car jackings escalated, and many commercial farmers either emigrated or gave up farming because of violence committed against them. From 1989 to 1994 the murder rate doubled, and a young South African woman could be expected to be raped twice in her lifetime on average. The changing landscape encouraged many of the wealthier South Africans, particularly in Johannesburg, to move into gated communities.’\n\nIn this respect, ‘Disgrace’ can be seen as an extremely potent evocation of the exact time it was written in, its plot touching on very current hot topics and depicting them with brutal candour, not so much the rape itself, but the confused and confusing responses of those affected by it, above all, of course, the blundering academic who has taken guilt-free sex and black passivity for granted all his life and now is being forced to wake up to a new reality.\n\nGoing to the dogs or…fleeing the country\n\nMaybe we should attribute the text’s ‘everything’s going to the dogs’ pessimism to the novel’s (deeply unattractive) protagonist and not to Coetzee himself, certainly in a sentence like this one, the cliché clearly describes Lurie’s psychological state after the attack:\n\nLucy’s future, his future, the future of the land as a whole – it is all a matter of indifference, he wants to say; let it all go to the dogs, I do not care.\n\nBut then again, stepping back from this particular book, looking at Coetzee’s life as a whole, arguably Coetzee’s simplest statement about the political situation and future of his native country is that he left it, emigrating to Australia in 2002.\n\nSummary\n\nA lot happens, a lot of over-thinking, half-baked ideas and sophomore-level cultural references. Physically it’s a short book (220 pages) but dense with ratiocination.\n\nIt is also full of canny echoes and cross-weavings, the themes of sex and race and violence, evoked and then reworked in different variations, alongside secondary ones like the dumb helplessness of animals and the difficulty of father-daughter relationships. By the end you realise you’ve navigated through swirling cross-currents with these themes extensively explored, repeated, echoed and refined.\n\nI was tired by half way through, tired of despising Lurie and disliking Coetzee’s pompous prose, but struggled on, like wading deeper into a surfy sea. But if you can close your eyes to all the obvious defects, the creepy protagonist, the degrading attitude to women, the rape, and Coetzee’s pompous prose, then the development of the plot, and the cumulative effect of these themes, acquire a real power.\n\nIn my opinion the book struggles through to greatness in spite of itself, in spite of the repulsive central character and in spite of Coetzee’s irritating prose. But there is, undeniably, something mighty in its conception, its shape and depth, something which is only revealed in the turning chapter, number 23, when Lucy announces her pregnancy.\n\nLike a whale surfacing on a previously flat sea, something huge emerges from the hitherto merely irritating text. In an extraordinary turnaround, I ended the book feeling profoundly moved and in the presence of some kind of genuine greatness. I hated it a lot and wouldn’t really recommend it to a friend and yet, by the end, it was an undeniably intense and bewildering and weirdly inspiring read.\n\nCredit\n\nDisgrace by J.M.
