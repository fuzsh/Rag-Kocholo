        "text": "J.M. Coetzee, a South African writer whose fiction deals with the cruelt foibles of humankind, was awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature yesterday.\n\nRather than expressing the customary enthusiasm and gratitude, Coetzee issued a statement saying: \"It came as a complete surprise. I was not even aware that the announcement was pending.\" He then detailed his academic plans for this semester at the University of Chicago and said he will soon publish a translation of Dutch poetry.\n\nBorn in 1940, John Maxwell Coetzee has published two novellas, two memoirs, seven novels and several collections of critical essays. He was the first writer to win the Booker Prize twice - in 1983 for \"The Life Times of Michael K\" and in 1999 for \"Disgrace.\"\n\nHe lives in Australia but comes to the United States for about 10 weeks each year to teach literature.\n\nHis next work, before the Dutch poetry, is \"Elizabeth Costello,\" a fictional tale told through a series of lectures, to be published by Viking Penguin this month.\n\nThe Nobel committee praised Coetzee, who \"in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider.\"\n\n\"Waiting for the Barbarians,\" published in 1980, is an allegory about a magistrate who steadfastly represents the Empire. His faith is shaken when he observes the Empire's oppressive side.\n\n\"Disgrace\" is the story of a college professor in post-apartheid South Africa who seduces a student and then begins to feel his life unravel. \"Michael K\" follows a gardener's well-meaning escape from Cape Town for the countryside, one which leads him instead to labor camps and oppression.\n\nKathryn Court, president of Penguin Books and Coetzee's editor since 1982, said she believes he won the prize because of \"his humanity, his compassion and his understanding of all of the bad things we do and we feel. I think he really understands human nature and he can write about it in a way that is devastating.\""
