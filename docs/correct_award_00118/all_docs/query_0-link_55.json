        "text": "Coetzee Awarded Nobel Prize for Literature\n\nRoger Wilkison\n\nSouth African writer JM Coetzee has won this year's Nobel Prize for Literature. The Swedish Academy, which awarded the prize, praised Mr. Coetzee's works for what it called theirwell-craftedï¼ææå·§å¦ï¼composition and analytical brilliance.\n\nJohn Maxwell Coetzee, whose novels and essays are characterized by ableakï¼èåç, ååçï¼vision of his racially divided homeland, is the second South African author to win the Nobel Prize. Nadine Gordimer received the award in 1991.\n\nMr. Coetzee was the first writer to win Britain's prestigiousBooker Prizeï¼å¸å å¥ï¼twice, first forThe Life and Times of Michael Kï¼ãéº¦å¯Â·K ççå½ä¸æ¶ä»£ãï¼in 1983 and, again, forDisgraceï¼ãè»ãï¼ in 1999.\n\nBut the publicity-shy author has long been skittish about the attention of the media and stayed away from the awards ceremony on both occasions.\n\nMr. Coetzee's main characters are often innocents oroutcastsï¼è¢«éå¼çï¼who are overwhelmed by historical forces over which they have no influence. South Africa's formerapartheidï¼ç§æéç¦»ï¼system of separating the races is a recurring theme in his works.\n\nThe Swedish Academy praised Mr. Coetzee for his intellectual honesty, noting that the 63-year-old author has been, in its words, ruthless in his criticism of the cruel rationalism and cosmetic morality in western civilization.\n\nThe academy, in announcing the .3 million award, also noted that, although Mr. Coetzee makes the distinction between right and wrongcrystal clearï¼æå ¶æç½, ååæ¸ æ¥ï¼, he also portrays it as being ultimately pointless.\n\nMr. Coetzee was born inCape Townï¼å¼æ®æ¦ï¼to an English-speaking family of Afrikaaner background. Though he has spent most of his life in South Africa, he studied and worked in the United States and Britain and emigrated to Australia two years ago.\n\nHis novels includeWaiting for the Barbariansï¼ãç­å¾ éè®äººãï¼andDusklandsï¼ãå¹½æä¹ä¹¡ãï¼as well as his latest work of fiction,Elizabeth Costelloï¼ãä¼ä¸½èç½ï¼å ä¸æ³°æ´ãï¼. He has also written essays on such topics as rugby and censorship.\n\nThe literature prize is the first of the Nobels to be awarded this year. In the days ahead, the Swedish Academy will announce the winners of the medicine, physics, chemistry and economics prizes. On October 10, the Norwegian Academy will announce the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize."
