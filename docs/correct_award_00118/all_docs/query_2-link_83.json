Brown University B.A. Bates College Faculty Mentor to Ithaca College Men's Rowing I received my PhD from Brown University in 2012 where I was awarded the Presidential Excellence in Teaching Award, a distinction given to one graduate student at the university each academic year. I joined the English Department at Ithaca College in 2011, and I teach introductions to postcolonial and contemporary literatures, as well as upper division courses on the South African novel, literature and surveillance, and on the emergent genre of the global novel. Since 2013, I have been the co-director, with the novelist Eleanor Henderson, of Ithaca's New Voices Festival, a three-day celebration of talented, early career writers. Now in its second decade, New Voices brings seven writers of poetry, fiction, drama, and essay to campus each Spring Semester for a series of readings and workshops.  My book, Kazuo Ishiguro Against World Literature, is currently under contract with Bloomsbury Press. My primary research field is contemporary postcolonial/Anglophone literature, especially those texts and authors that cross borders, geographic and otherwise, and become, willingly or not, works of world literature. I have published research articles on the theoretical and philosophical concept of the limit in Literature Compass, corporate personhood and Kazuo Ishiguro's novels in NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction, Zadie Smith's novels of style in The Companion to Contemporary British and Irish Literature, and on genre in Ishiguro's canon in The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to World Literature. With Kelly Mee Rich (Harvard), I edited a special issue on \"Kazuo Ishiguro After the Nobel\" for the journal Modern Fiction Studies. My research on The Man Booker Prize and post-imperial British fiction appears in Oxford University Press's ORE Literature Research Encyclopedia. With Thom Dancer (U Toronto), I edited a special issue on \"The Novel at its Limits\" for the journal Critique. I have recently published a chapter on the controversies surrounding JM Coetzee's novel Disgrace for The Bloomsbury Handbook to J. M. Coetzee, edit. Andrew Van Der Vlies (Adelaide), along with an essay for Public Books about Haruki Murakami's short story collection, After the Quake.  I am a member of the Editorial Board of ARIEL, a Johns Hopkins University Press a journal of international literature in English. I am the creator and host of the literary interview podcast, Burned by Books, and I am a lead host and producer for the official podcast of the Society for Novel Studies, Novel Dialogue, which is sponsored by Duke University, in partnership with Public Books. In 2018, I received the Faculty Excellence Award at Ithaca College for distinction in Teaching, Scholarship, and Service.
