        "text": "On May 5, Nobel Prize winning author J.M. Coetzee, who earned a Ph.D. degree in 1969 from The University of Texas at Austin, will be speaking at the LBJ Auditorium as part of the Centennial Celebration of the Office of Graduate Studies.\n\nAn acclaimed novelist, academic, and literary critic, Coetzee is one of the university’s most distinguished alumni. Said to be influenced by his own personal history of growing up in South Africa, Coetzee writes with strong anti-imperialist feelings. He has published 13 books, including The Life and Times of Michael K in 1983 and Disgrace in 1999. Both books were awarded the Booker Prize, making him the first author to be given the award twice. His novel Waiting for the Barbarians was adapted into an opera composed by Philip Glass.\n\nThe event runs from 6-7:30 pm. Click here for more information about this free event and to RSVP.\n\nCheck out J.M. Coetzee’s work at the Libraries.\n\nMeghan Sitar is Instruction & Outreach Librarian for the University of Texas Libraries."
