        "text": "Who wrote it?\n\nJohn Maxwell Coetzee (1940-; active 1974-), born Cape Town, South Africa. A much-awarded novelist, with accolades including the Nobel Prize for Literature, he was the first author to win the Booker twice (in the chronological sense, at least) - with 1999’s Disgrace also taking the Prize.\n\nSomething of a polymath, he studied English before working as a computer programmer for IBM in London, and managed to combine the two by completing a computer-aided analysis of the language of Beckett for his doctoral thesis while in the US on a Fulbright scholarship. He was one of a small number of prominent white South African authors to overtly criticize Apartheid, and has a history of protest dating back to anti-Vietnam war protests and continuing through recent involvement in animal rights issues.\n\nWhat's it about\n\nMichael K, a poor man with a cleft lip, quits his job as a gardener in Cape Town to honour his sick mother’s wishes to return her to the countryside of her childhood, in Prince Albert. In a fictionalized South Africa which is descending into civil war, Michael is unable to leave freely by ordinary means due to a (shall we say, kafkaesque?) bureaucracy that is purposefully paradoxical and impossible to defeat, so sets off on an impossibly long journey, carrying his mother through heavily guarded streets and freezing nights on a shoddily improvised rickshaw.\n\nRelatively early in their journey, his mother succumbs to her illness and passes away. Michael is left to continue his journey alone, carrying her ashes to Prince Albert but otherwise lacking either purpose or a true sense of freedom. Wherever he goes he is met by people who seek to imprison or enslave him (literally or metaphorically), spends time in internment camps and on labour gangs, as well as living in mountain caves. He becomes chronically malnourished, unable to stomach food even on the rare occasions he can get hold of it. Nonetheless, he finds purpose in cultivating and growing food, and ultimately escapes and finds his way back to Cape Town, where he has a strange encounter on a beach.\n\nWhat I liked\n\nIf you’re anything at all like me, you’ll have read the above and thought “Well, this sounds like a right barrel of laughs. Maybe I’ll give it a swerve.” That, readers, is absolutely what I would have done in any normal circumstances (despite a couple of glowing recommendations from trusted friends!) But luckily I’m ploughing through all these winners, like it or not. And once again I’m very pleased that I am, because this is an incredible novel. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything quite like it.\n\nAbove all else, I loved the sparseness of the prose. Every short sentence, particularly in the first three quarters of the book, felt like a line of poetry. There is a huge amount of depth and studied ambiguity in a lot of the writing.\n\nThe world created is fictionalized but clearly deeply allegorical of an incomprehensibly divided South Africa, as well as more broadly of a world inclined to destroy itself rather than try to reconcile its issues. There’s a sense throughout of a vast landscape, with room enough for everyone and everything to thrive, but that its vast riches and possibilities (at least for some members of society) are shut down at every corner by a small number of powerful men trying to protect their own interests.\n\nThe non-too-subtle Kafka referencing of the title is more than borne out by references in the narrative - particularly near the beginning in a series of pages you can’t help but read with a profound sense of exasperation at the prison of bureaucracy Michael finds himself in.\n\nOverall it’s a complex novel, despite its brevity. One of the more interesting aspects is the withholding of information about Michael. Some other reviews I’ve read see this as frustrating, a sign of an underdeveloped character (or cipher, perhaps), but for me it’s surely a deliberate move on Coetzee’s part. Other characters (deliberately or not) fail to acknowledge who Michael is, seeing only his physical appearance and repeatedly misnaming, aging and otherwise dismissing him. The system refuses to allow him the documentation to move freely. His effective erasure by society is something that he can ultimately only defeat by embracing it, playing his own part in self-obliteration by starvation, refusal to speak, and a belief that “man should live so that he leaves no trace of his living.”\n\nOne of the more surprising parts of the novel is an abrupt narrative shift as a second “chapter” appears, almost at the end of the novel. We briefly switch away from Michael’s own perspective into the lens of a (relatively) sympathetic doctor who tries to argue his case. The fact that this narrative collapses with Michael taking control of his own destiny and escaping the camp by his own means is surely also symbolic. As, you have to imagine, is the fact that all it leads to is a strange, sad climax (literally) on a beach right back where he started - a little more philosophically advanced, perhaps, but no further on in any practical sense.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n\nI can certainly empathize with some of the criticism I’ve read that suggests that Coetzee puts a lot of philosophy (and indeed scientific and horticultural capability) into the words/thoughts of someone who’s also supposed to be - in generous terms - not the smartest. But I also think it misses the point. It’s easy to get frustrated with some flaws of Michael’s “realist” characterization because you’re drawn in by huge amounts of emotional heft in places that makes you think you’re dealing with straightforwardly “realist” characters, when it seems far more to me to be a novel of metaphors and allusions in which “characters” are more of a vehicle for ideas, not necessarily intended to believable or internally consistent. So… I don’t actually think this is something I didn’t like, is it? Sorry…\n\nYou can certainly tell that Coetzee is not in any sense a laughing man (see below), but let this be a reminder to me that perhaps not every novel needs to have that “touch of lightness” I often crave in order to satisfy.\n\nFood & drink pairings"
