"Moscow 24" is the main TV channel about the life of Russian capital. Its audience - active citizens who are interested in living in Moscow and everything around this topic. These people are open to everything new and are not afraid of the change. To match the tastes and interests of its young and bold audience, the "Moscow 24" TV channel decided to change and did it with the help of Vizart.

"Moscow is a dynamic and modern megapolis. This city needs a fashionable and constantly evolving television channel, "- art director of the studio Vizart Alexey Fedotov.

The basic requirements for the new style were ease and simplicity. Therefore, we replaced the heavy news bars and titles with their more modern, airy-looking versions. In addition to that, we have updated all design elements of the channel up to keynote templates for stand-ups and screensavers for monitors. Each element, each line was carefully thought out, so together they formed a single, well-coordinated ensemble.

The main task of "Moscow 24" TV channel is to promptly inform about all the events taking place in the capital. The new style, created by the Vizart Studio, not only aesthetically improved the flow of information, but also helped to solve some technical issues. Due to the light weighted design, the video signal is less overlapped. In addition, we turned the "Beginning of the Hour" from just a beautiful header into an original newsstand, which allows the "input" to the broadcast begin to be implemented more quickly.

In recent years, Moscow has changed a lot. And, thanks to the Vizart Studio, the "Moscow 24" TV channel has changed with it.
