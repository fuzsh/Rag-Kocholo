To avoid further harm to society's security and to protect the public interest ... action must be taken immediately,\" the TTJA's chief Kaur Kajak said.\n\nThe ban is valid for 12 months.\n\nUntil now, TTJA had been monitoring all Russian channels, but recently eight (RTR-Planeta, RTVI, Rossija 24, REN TV, NTV Mir and PBK) have come under closer scrutiny.\n\n\"Russian propaganda channels have been inciting hostility and carried propaganda and war propaganda,\" Kajak noted.\n\nThe difference between the current and previous situation is that the propaganda has a clear result, i.e. Thursday's large-scale attack on Ukraine, Kajak said.\n\nTelecomms firm Telia announced early on Friday that some Russian TV channels would no longer be broadcast via its service.\n\n\"Pursuant to the situation, Telia will end broadcasting RTR Planeta, NTV Mir, Rossia 24 and TV Centre International (TVCI) from the night of February 25 to its TV service clients,\" Telia announced.\n\nElisa announced on Friday morning at 8.30 a.m. that broadcasting RTR Planeta, TVCi, Belarus 24 and NTV Mir will be banned.\n\nThe TTJA had on Thursday stated it would within the ensuing 24 hours be making a decision on the future of the channels' airing in Estonia.\n\n--"
