        "text": "By Virgin TV Edit\n\nIf the smorgasbord of TV channels can’t fulfil your insatiable urge for top-notch telly, then for you lucky Virgin Media customers armed with Virgin TV 360, Stream from Virgin Media, a TiVo® box or a V6 box (powered by TiVo), there’s a plethora of apps offering oodles more top quality content for you to feast your eyes on (app availability depending on box, some subscriptions apply).\n\nWe’re adding brand new apps to our service all the time. What does that mean? It means you can watch even more of your favourite shows when you want.\n\nWith Box Sets, films, games and activities that keep the whole family entertained, there are plenty of apps to choose from. Customers with our 360 or Stream box can press Home > Apps, or use voice control and just say “apps”. To find them on our V6 box, simply head on over to Home > Apps & Games > All Apps, and get watching.\n\nSome apps are not available on our older TV boxes, such as our V6 or TiVo boxes. In order to access all the great content available, contact us on 0345 454 1111 or 150 from a Virgin Media phone to upgrade now.\n\nNetflix is where you’ll find some of the biggest hits of the streaming era, including Stranger Things, Bridgerton, Squid Game, The Queen’s Gambit and Wednesday, as well as 2023’s breakout hits like The Diplomat and The Night Agent. But there’s more to this streaming giant than top-class drama series. Netflix also brings you star-studded, acclaimed original movies such as Maestro, Don’t Look Up and Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.\n\nAnd that’s not all: there’s hilarious stand-up comedy specials, a huge catalogue of beloved TV and films to discover (or enjoy again and again), and even games. Ever heard someone claim that they’ve “completed Netflix”? You can scoff that them. It will never happen.\n\nWith Prime Video, you simply get TV of a kind you won’t find anywhere else. New hit series for in 2024 include acclaimed video game adaptation Fallout and slick spy caper Mr & Mrs Smith. There’s big-budget, epic fantasy like The Wheel Of Time, Good Omens and The Lord Of The Rings: The Rings Of Power. Hyper-violent, sharply satirical comic-book stories like The Boys and Gen V. Intriguingly esoteric series like Deadloch, Upload and the animated Invincible. High-class action dramas like Reacher and The Terminal List. Brilliant reality shows like 007: Road To A Million and Clarkson’s Farm. Sports documentaries like Ronnie O’Sullivan: The Edge Of Everything and The Test.\n\nAnd it’s not just streaming series! Prime Video also gives you original and exclusive movies with big stars, including Jake Gyllenhaal in Road House, Zac Efron and John Cena in Ricky Stanicky and Jennifer Lopez in This Is Me… Now: A Love Story, as well as Anne Hathaway in romcom The Idea Of You. You’ll never run out of entertainment with Prime Video.\n\nPrime Video is available on our 360, Stream and V6 boxes only.\n\nWant even more?\n\nThere are even more apps waiting for you. Thinking about upgrading your Virgin TV account? You can do that via the TV Upgrades app. With the Radioline app you get access to 70,000 radio stations from across the world.
