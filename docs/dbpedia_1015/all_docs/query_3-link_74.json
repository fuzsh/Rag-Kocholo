Ambassador Fu’s comments may represent an attempt by Beijing to restore confidence among EU member states following statements made by Lu Shaye, the Chinese Ambassador to France, after Lu questioned the sovereignty of post-Soviet states on Friday, April 21, 2023.\n\nApril 21, 2023\n\n[Statement] China’s Ambassador to France Lu Shaye says in an interview with French television network LCI that “…these ex-Soviet Union countries do not have the status, the effective [status] in international law, because there is no international agreement to materialize their status as a sovereign country.”\n\nForeign ministers of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, as well as the EU’s foreign policy chief, condemn the comments and describe them as “unacceptable” and “false.” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Zelenskyy’s office, says on social media that China cannot expect itself to be taken seriously as a “major political player” if it parrots Kremlin propaganda.\n\nOn April 24, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mao Ning states at a news briefing that “China respects the status of the former Soviet republics as sovereign countries after the Soviet Union’s dissolution,” and that this is the “official position of the Chinese government.” The Chinese Embassy in Paris issues a statement the same day rejecting Ambassador Lu’s comments as “an expression of personal views during a televised debate.”\n\nApril 18, 2023\n\nBloomberg reports that Russian officials “privately raised concerns” in Summer 2022 about becoming dependent on Chinese technologies following U.S. and European sanctions. A “previously unreported assessment” from the Russian Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media states that Russian officials are concerned about companies such as Huawei dominating the Russian market and posing “a risk to the country’s information security and networks.” European officials “familiar with the document” say that the assessment was shared among the Russian General Staff of the Armed Forces and the Russian Security Council.\n\nApril 16, 2023\n\n[Action/Statement] In his first visit to a foreign country as Minister of Defense, Li Shangfu meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in Moscow, according to South China Morning Post. According to the Washington Post, President Putin tells Minister Li that he hopes China and Russia can conduct more joint training exercises and professional exchanges. Minister Li said that China seeks to deepen its relationship to “strengthen strategic communication between the two militaries, strengthen multilateral coordination and cooperation, and make new contributions to safeguarding regional and global security and stability.”\n\nApril 14, 2023\n\n[Action] Reuters reports that according to Russian customs data, Chinese firm Quzhou Nova purchased $7.4 million worth of copper alloy from a Russian-annexed region of Ukraine between October 8, 2022 and March 24, 2023. Debaltsevsky Plant of Metallurgical Engineering, located in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, produces the copper alloy ingots. According to Reuters, the Russian Federal customs service cannot share information since it is confidential, and the Kremlin did not confirm if the purchase of the cooper alloy took place, claiming it has no information on the matter.\n\nApril 5, 2023\n\n[Action] Beijing hosts French President Emmanuel Macron and European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen. President Macron says he can count on General Secretary Xi to bring Russia “back to its senses” and get “everyone back to the negotiating table.” Reuters also notes that President Macron tells the press after his arrival to Beijing that Europe must “resist reducing trade and diplomatic ties” with China. Politico asserts, however, that during the second day of Macron’s visit on April 6, 2023, General Secretary Xi “gave no hint he would use his influence to help end the conflict.” Politico says that General Secretary Xi Jinping and the CCP “enthusiastically endorsed” Macron’s concept of strategic autonomy.\n\nMarch 21, 2023\n\n[Action] TheNew York Times reports that Russia has purchased $12 million worth of drones from Chinese manufacturers, including DJI Technology and Autel, since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.\n\n[Statement] Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin issue a joint statement outlining Beijing’s self-proclaimed “unbiased position” on the war in Ukraine. The statement also vaguely notes that the countries will commit to further studies on the proposed Power of Siberia-2 natural gas pipeline, although Putin reportedly sought a specific commitment from Xi on constructing the pipeline, according to the Financial Times. Additionally, General Secretary Xi invites President Putin to come to China “at a convenient time” in 2023.\n\nMarch 20, 2023\n\n[Action/Statement] Reuters reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping for a dinner at the Kremlin, holding informal talks that lasted over four hours. Reuters also notes that General Secretary Xi’s decision to make the visit takes place despite an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant issued on Friday, March 17 that accuses Putin of war crimes for deporting children from Ukraine. Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin says during a press conference that the ICC “needs to take an objective and just position, respect the jurisdictional immunity of a head of state under international law,…” and should “not engage in politicization or use double standards.”\n\nMarch 16, 2023\n\n[Action] Politico reports that according to customs data, China North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) sent 1,000 CQ-A rifles to Russia between June and December 2022. Politico also reports that Chinese companies sent 12 tons of body armor to Russia over the same time period. In November and December 2022, DJI Technology sent 12 shipments of drone parts to Russia, routing the shipments through the United Arab Emirates according to the report.\n\nMarch 13, 2023\n\nWall Street Journal reports that Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping plans on speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to “people familiar with the matter.” Wall Street Journal says that the discussion would likely take place virtually following General Secretary Xi’s visit to Moscow, but China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request to comment. A Ukrainian official who spoke to the Journal states that the call is yet to be scheduled.\n\nMarch 7, 2023\n\n[Statement] Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang states that “currencies should not be trump cards for unilateral sanctions, still less a disguise for bullying or coercion.” Qin states that trade between China and Russia will use “whatever currency is easy to use.” An increasing share of Russian trade with China is denominated in RMB, as Russian financial institutions and businesses have struggled to access dollars and euros under Western financial sanctions.\n\nMarch 1, 2023\n\n[Action] MMC Norilsk Nickel, Russia’s largest mining company, is accepting payment denominated in Renminbi (RMB) for its sales of nickel to China, according to Bloomberg. Russian companies’ ability to transact in dollars, in which the vast majority of commodities trading is priced, have been severely curtailed under U.S. and partner countries’ financial sanctions on Russia. MMC Norilsk Nickel’s willingness to accept prices set in RMB will likely boost its sales to China. In 2022, 14 percent of Russia’s total exports were paid for in RMB, an increase from 0.4 percent at the beginning of that year. Over the same period, bilateral trade rose to $190 billion, a 30 percent increase compared to 2021.\n\n[Statement] Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko states that Belarus “fully supports” China’s peace proposal while visiting General Secretary Xi in Beijing. According Xinhua News Agency, both sides agree to jointly implement China’s Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative. General Secretary Xi says that “China is ready to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Belarus at multilateral fora, including the United Nations, to jointly address global challenges and build a community with a shared future for mankind.”\n\nThe Global Security Initiative, a security framework proposed by General Secretary Xi at the Boao Forum for Asia’s annual conference in April 2022, is increasingly a key part of China’s foreign engagements. This initiative endorses the concept of “indivisible security,” which Russia has cited in its negotiations over Ukraine. The concept of “indivisible security” and the Global Security Initiative are broader than the Ukraine crisis and appear to be attempts by China and Russia to coopt portions of concepts from agreements inked in the 1970s to establish, influence, or distort contemporary international norms in the security realm.\n\nFebruary 25, 2023\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency Director Bill Burns confirms in a CBS News interview that China is considering sending lethal aid to Russia to support the Kremlin’s efforts in Ukraine. He says that China has yet to decide on transferring lethal equipment to Russia, and that there are no “actual shipments of lethal equipment” found yet.\n\nFebruary 24, 2023\n\n[Action] On the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs releases “China’s Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis,” a twelve-point paper that calls for all parties to support dialogue between Russia and Ukraine to “gradually deescalate the situation.” Though it does not name the United States and Europe, it repeats criticisms of a “Cold War mentality” and the economic measures taken against Russia. Without naming Russia, the paper repeats opposition to any use of nuclear weapons and any attacks on nuclear power plants. The paper offers little by way of substantive diplomatic proposals and repeats many of Beijing’s standard positions on Ukraine.\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\n\n[Action] China’s top diplomat and CCP Politburo member Wang Yi meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders. Wang describes China-Russia relations as “rock-solid.” In a press conference later that day, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang Wenbin says that the two sides agreed to “firmly oppose hegemonism and bloc confrontation,” and “jointly uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter,” among other core concepts outlined in the Global Security Initiative, which the Russian government has not formally endorsed.\n\nFebruary 21, 2023\n\n[Action] China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs publishes the Global Security Initiative Concept Paper, which elaborates on China’s “alternative” to military alliances. The paper restates the six commitments expressed last year at the Boao Forum and adds two new sections on “Priorities for Cooperation” and “Mechanisms for Cooperation.” The paper reiterates China’s position of supporting “a political settlement of hotspot issues such as the Ukraine crisis through dialogue and negotiation.”\n\nFebruary 19, 2023\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken says in an interview with CBS News that the United States has information indicating China is considering providing lethal support to Ukraine.\n\nFebruary 18, 2023\n\n[Statement] China’s top diplomat and CCP Politburo member Wang Yi delivers a speech at the Munich Security Conference, an annual conference on international security policy held in Munich, Germany. In his speech, Wang promotes General Secretary Xi’s Global Security Initiative and states, without elaborating on specifics, that “on the Ukraine issue, China’s position boils down to supporting talks for peace.”\n\nFebruary 17, 2023\n\n[Action] Officials from China’s Ministry of Commerce meet with ten Chinese independent oil refiners regarding the volume and prices of their imports of Russian oil, according to sources that spoke with Reuters. The officials refrain from offering guidance on the oil imports. One of Reuters’ sources also stated that ministry officials met earlier in February with China’s state-owned refiners to discuss the impact on Chinese exports following the February 5 expansion of the Group of Seven (G7), the EU, and Australia’s price cap mechanism, which now covers Russian refined products in addition to crude oil. The price cap is intended to reduce the revenue Russia receives from oil exports without fully cutting off supply from Russia and avoiding a spike in the price of oil.\n\nFebruary 14, 2023\n\n[Action] Reutersand Bloomberg report that Chinese state-owned petrochemical giants Sinopec, PetroChina, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) are resuming purchases of Russian crude oil. China’s major state-owned petrochemical companies had halted purchases of Russian crude after the G7, the EU, and Australia first implemented a price cap mechanism on December 5, 2022, which is aimed at limiting the revenue Russia receives on oil exports. Oil importers that purchase oil above a set price will be ineligible for shipping and services, including insurance, from G7 -based companies. However, the cargoes purchased by these Chinese refiners are purchased through trading companies that arrange payments to Russian oil producers as well as insurance and shipping, side-stepping the limitation imposed by the price cap mechanism. Oil industry consultants Energy Aspects estimate that China’s daily imports of Russian oil may rise by 500,000 barrels or more over the course of the year, reaching 2.2 million barrels per day. China’s total crude imports are projected to reach as high as 11.8 million barrels per day.\n\nFebruary 8, 2023\n\n[Statement] China’s Ambassador to the European Union Fu Cong expresses concern about the West calling for Ukraine to attain a “complete victory on the battlefield” and instead suggests finding a solution “on the negotiation table” at an event hosted by the Brussels-based think tank European Policy Centre. Fu Cong also said “And we don’t believe that only providing weapons will actually solve the problem.”\n\nG7 member states discuss whether to sanction Chinese, Iranian, and North Korean companies for providing parts and technology to Russia for military use. Anonymous individuals familiar with the matter tell Bloomberg that the G7 member states may seek to coordinate a package of measures by February 24, 2023, on the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to Bloomberg. The individuals note, however, that G7 member states may take different actions and still need to decide what companies to include.\n\n[Statement] China’s Ambassador to France Lu Shaye says in an interview with French news channel LCI that China has “not supplied weapons to Russia.” When pressed on whether Chinese companies are selling spare parts that support Russia’s war effort, Lu states “parts are not weapons, are they?” Lu states that China believes that weapons supplied by NATO countries “to one side of the war is not conducive to ending the war as soon as possible.”\n\nFebruary 4, 2023\n\n[Action] The Wall Street Journal reports that multiple Chinese state-owned and non-state companies have exported military and dual-use technology items to Russian defense companies. According to the Journal’s review of Russian import and transshipment records compiled by U.S. think tank C4ADS, these transactions include $1.2 million worth of SU-35 jet fighter components sold by Chinese state-owned aerospace firm AVIC International Holdings Corp, whose parent company Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) is included on the U.S. Treasury Department’s Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List. China also exported over $128 million in computer chips and chip components to Russia between April and October 2022, according to the Journal.\n\nJanuary 26, 2023\n\n[Action] The U.S. Treasury Departmentadds Changsha Tianyi Space Science and Technology Research Institute (Spacety China) and its Luxembourg-based subsidiary to the Specially Designated National (SDN) list after it provided support to Russia’s military industrial base. Treasury asserts that Russia-based technology firm Terra Tech procured high-resolution satellite images from Spacety China to support the combat operations of Russian proxy private military company Wagner Group. Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for China’s Embassy in the United States, subsequently states that Treasury’s determination “has no factual basis, but is purely speculative and deliberately hyped up.”\n\n[Action] Google’s Threat Analysis Group claims that the pro-Chinese influence campaign DRAGONBRIDGE disseminated narratives about the war in Ukraine on social media in 2022. Google’s Threat Analysis Group says that DRAGONBRIDGE pushes narratives criticizing the U.S. for sending military equipment to Ukraine and “worsening the conflict.”\n\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\n[Statement] Financial Times reports that an anonymous Chinese official said Russian President Vladimir Putin is “crazy.” The official also asserts that China shouldn’t “simply follow Russia,” and acknowledges that only a handful of Russian officials made the decision to invade.\n\nDecember 23, 2022\n\n[Statement] China’s Ambassador to the European Union Fu Cong states that the Ukraine crisis has put Beijing “in a very difficult position” and hurt China’s relations with the EU during an interview with South China Morning Post. Ambassador Fu says that China sees itself as “collateral damage” of the crisis and reiterates appeals by former Chinese officials not to “read too much into the terminology” of China’s “no limits” partnership with Russia.\n\nDecember 9, 2022\n\n[Action] Bloombergand Reuters report that China’s independent oil refiners may be purchasing oil above a price cap on Russian crude oil that the Group of Seven industrialized nations (G7) introduced on December 5. The cargoes purchased by these Chinese refiners are likely insured and transported by Russian oil sellers, side-stepping the price cap mechanism’s proscription on G7-based companies providing shipping, insurance, and other services to purchasers that pay above the cap.\n\nDecember 1, 2022\n\n[Statement] General Secretary Xi Jinping meets with European Council President Charles Michel in Beijing. After the meeting President Michel said in his remarks that he “urged President Xi — as we did at our EU-China Summit in April — to use his influence on Russia to respect the UN charter. A readout from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs says the two leaders “exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis” and that “China supports the EU in stepping up mediation efforts.”\n\nNovember 29, 2022\n\n[Action] Newsweek reports that Russian An-124 transport aircraft visited China nine times within seven days in November. The article repeats claims in an article by the Ukrainian military news outlet Defense Express that for some flights the aircraft turned off their transponders, and that internet users speculated the cargo included military aid. On November 24, China’s state-owned news agency Xinhua reported that three Russian An-124 planes landed at Zhengzhou Airport on November 23 and that airport staff “loaded several hundred tons of cross-border e-commerce and clothing goods into the cargo hold… These items will fly directly from Zhengzhou Airport to Moscow with the cargo plane, and will soon be sent to the homes of local people.”\n\nNovember 16, 2022\n\n[Statement] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi says China endorses Russia’s no nuclear pledge on Ukraine at the Group of Twenty (G20) summit. According to Wang, China acknowledges that Russia reiterated its position that a nuclear war is “impossible and inadmissible” in a meeting with Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Wang says, “It is a rational and responsible position from Russia” on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nNovember 15, 2022\n\n[Statement] The Washington Post reports that during the G20 summit Indonesia, China’s delegates objected to calling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a “war” in a joint communique. Russia and China reportedly advocated for a different term to describe the war, according to delegates at the summit. The joint communique, the “G20 Bali Leaders’ Declaration,” states that G20 leaders have “witnessed the war in Ukraine further adversely impact the global economy,” and cites UN General Assembly Resolution ES-11/1, which “deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and demands its complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine.”\n\nNovember 14, 2022\n\n[Action] Chinese independent and state refiners cut back on purchases of Russian crude oil as the imposition of the G-7’s price-cap mechanism on Russian oil nears, according to Reuters reporting. Speaking to reporters during the G20 Summit, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen states that China’s purchase of Russian oil would be “completely consistent” with the planned cap.\n\nNovember 2, 2022\n\n[Action] Russian forces use Iranian-made suicide drones with Chinese knock-off parts to attack Ukrainian cities. The Shahed-131 and Shahed-136 drone use an engine by Beijing MicroPilot Flight Control Systems, which is a copy of the German aerospace company Limbach Flugmotoren’s engine design. Aside from indigenously producing the engines China also exports the designs to Iran.\n\nOctober 27, 2022\n\n[Statement] China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi expresses in a phone call with Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov that China will firmly support Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government to help lead the Russian people to “overcome difficulties, eliminate disturbances, realize the strategic goals of development, and further establish Russia on the international stage.” Wang Yi also says that China is willing to deepen exchanges with Russia at all levels. In response, Foreign Minister Lavrov congratulates the “complete success” of the 20th Party Congress and reciprocates Wang Yi’s remarks saying that Russia is also willing to strengthen ties with China at all levels.\n\nOctober 21, 2022\n\n[Statement] China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin expresses China’s disagreement with the European Union’s decision to sanction three Iranian generals and an Iranian company for supplying drones to the Russian military for use in its invasion of Ukraine. On October 20, 27 governments of the European Union imposed an asset freeze and a travel ban on three Iranian generals suspected of facilitating drone delivery to Russia, as well as an asset freeze on Shahed Aviation Industries who produces the drones Russia is accused of using against Ukraine.\n\nOctober 15, 2022\n\n[Statement] The Chinese Foreign Ministry urges its citizens to leave Ukraine and releases registration information for evacuation on its WeChat account.

On October 19, the Chinese Embassy in Ukraine issues guidance for evacuations to the neighboring states of Moldova, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia.\n\n[Statement] At the Arctic Circle Assembly, Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer says that China “doesn’t share our values and undermines the rules-based international order.” He Rulong, China’s ambassador to Iceland, says in response that Bauer’s comments are “filled with arrogance.” Bauer then says to He Rulong, “I have a question for you, because you underline the principle of sovereignty and the importance of the internationally recognized borders in the world,” Bauer continues, saying, “I am correct, isn’t that true? Yeah. So why is it possible then that China still is not condemning Russia’s attack in Ukraine?”\n\nOctober 10, 2022\n\n[Statement] Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning calls for de-escalation in Ukraine, stating “all countries deserve respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity” and that “support should be given to all efforts that are conducive to peacefully resolving the crisis.”\n\nSeptember 26, 2022\n\n[Statement] Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin avoids media queries about diplomatic communications between Ukraine and China. President Zelenskyy gave an interview on September 23 to French newspaper Ouest France, where he stated that there is currently no communication channel with China.\n\nSeptember 22, 2022\n\n[Statement] China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi outlines China’s four priorities in resolving the Ukraine conflict before the UN Security Council: providing support for negotiations; urging the de-escalation of conflict, particularly around nuclear facilities; alleviating the humanitarian crisis; and curbing the “spillover effects” of the war, such as the global food crisis. Wang maintains that China seeks to safeguard the “sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries,” yet still makes no statement acknowledging that Russia has invaded Ukraine’s territory and violates its integrity by occupying Crimea and portions of Eastern Ukraine.\n\nSeptember 21, 2022\n\n[Statement] Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin that China calls “on the parties concerned to achieve a cease-fire and an end to the war through dialogue and negotiation, and find a way to take into account the legitimate security concerns of all parties,” as reported by the Wall Street Journal, the Agence France-Presse, and Al Jazeera. Although the official readout from the Foreign Ministry press conference excludes the term “cease-fire”, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning also used the phrase during a September 13 press conference.\n\nSeptember 18, 2022\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden says in an interview with 60 Minutes, “Thus far, there’s no indication [China has] put forward weapons or other things that Russia has wanted.”\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\n[Support] General Secretary Xi Jinping meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in Uzbekistan. According to the Russian readout, Xi and Putin discuss Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, about which Putin acknowledges that China has “questions and concerns,” while also thanking China for what Putin calls China’s “balanced position” on the invasion. The Chinese readout of the bilateral meeting does not mention a discussion of Ukraine or China’s no-limits partnership with Russia.\n\nSeptember 14, 2022\n\nMembers of Ukraine’s parliament Oleksandr Merezhko and Mykola Kniazhytskyi join the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a group of lawmakers from 30 legislatures which collaborates on policy responses to China.

Li asserts that “the political trust, strategic coordination and pragmatic cooperation between the two countries have reached new heights” and states that China fully understands and supports Russia’s need to secure its core interests, including Russia’s actions in Ukraine.\n\nSeptember 6, 2022\n\n[Sanctions] Chinese state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation agrees to pay for half of the gas it buys from Russian company Gazprom using renminbi (RMB), and will use rubles for the other half. Shifting towards gas payments denominated in rubles and RMB supports Russian efforts to stabilize the value of the ruble and reduce the use of dollars and euros when settling international transactions. Russian businesses and financial institutions have struggled to access dollars due to Western sanctions imposed in response to its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAugust 30, 2022\n\nChair of Ukraine’s Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Policy and Interparliamentary Cooperation Oleksandr Merezhko states to the Voice of America that “Ukraine should seriously reconsider [its] strategic partnership” with China over China’s support for Russia. He says, “I don’t think that a strategic partner of the aggressor state can be simultaneously our strategic partner. It makes no sense.” China’s designation of Ukraine as a strategic partner indicates a lower level of cooperation than the bilateral designation China formally uses to describe its relationship with Russia, which it calls a “comprehensive strategic partner.”\n\nAugust 27, 2022\n\n[Action] Newsweek reports that Chinese diplomats are pressuring members of Ukraine’s parliament over their membership in the Taiwan Friendship Group, a parliamentary caucus created on August 18, 2022 to promote ties with Taiwan. Chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Policy and Interparliamentary Cooperation Oleksandr Merezhko tells Newsweek that the complaints from Chinese diplomats indicate that China is “trying to dictate what a foreign parliament should do.”\n\nAugust 24, 2022\n\nBloomberg reports that Russia’s Ministry of Finance is considering issuing government bonds denominated in RMB, although it has not announced plans to do so in 2022. Russia has considered issuing RMB-denominated bonds since Russian companies were impacted by sanctions imposed in response to Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAugust 23, 2022\n\n[Statement] China’s Ambassador to the United Nations Geng Shuang notes the risk of a “serious nuclear accident” stemming from the fighting near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Geng states, “Under the current circumstances, it is necessary for the IAEA to conduct a site visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as soon as possible to make a professional and technical assessment of the safety and security situation of the nuclear facilities.”\n\nAugust 18, 2022\n\nThe research unit of SWIFT, the financial messaging system, finds that Russia’s use of RMB to settle international transactions has skyrocketed since its invasion of Ukraine. According to the monthly reports released by SWIFT, Russia surpassed Singapore as the third-largest market for overseas transactions denominated in RMB, behind Hong Kong and London. In July 2022 Russia was responsible for 3.9 percent of all payments using RMB outside of China, compared to less than 1 percent in January 2022. Russian businesses and financial institutions may be exploring opportunities to use RMB in their international transactions after international sanctions curtailed Russian banks’ access to U.S. dollars and euros.\n\nFifteen members of Ukraine’s parliament form a cross-party caucus called the Taiwan Friendship Group, which is aimed at promoting closer ties with Taiwan. Chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Policy and Interparliamentary Cooperation Oleksandr Merezhko states that the group was formed in gratitude for the sanctions Taiwan has introduced against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAugust 17, 2022\n\n[Action] China’s Ministry of Defense announces that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will participate in Russia’s annual strategic level military exercise, VOSTOK- 2022, and claims the PLA’s participation “is unrelated to the current international and regional situation.”\n\nNote: This will be China’s fifth time participating in the Russian military’s annual strategic exercise that rotates between four regions: VOSTOK (East), TSENTR (Central), KAVKAZ (Caucasus), and ZAPAD (West). ZAPAD-2021 took place across training ranges in Russia’s Western Military District and in Belarus, and placed Russian troops near the Ukrainian border in the months leading up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAugust 16, 2022\n\n[Action] Russia’s embassy in Beijing publishes and subsequently deletes a Weibo post that praises the Mavic, a drone produced by Chinese owned drone making company, DJI Technology Co., as a “true symbol of modern warfare.” DJI Technology rejects the Russian embassy’s statement and insists that their drones are “for civilian purposes and cannot meet the requirements of military specifications.” In April 2022, DJI suspended all business in Russia and Ukraine in response to concerns that the Russian army was using its drones in Ukraine and a request from Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedoroy for DJI to block the Russian military from using its drones. The United States sanctioned DJI drones in 2020 for facilitating repressive regimes and human rights abuses.\n\nAugust 8, 2022\n\n[Sanctions]Bloomberg reports that Chinese exports to Russia in July were valued at $6.7 billion, which is comparable to the level of Chinese exports to Russia from before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Bloomberg notes that some “Chinese goods are filling the niche left by the exodus of western brands,” particularly with vehicle sales from Great Wall Motor Co. and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd, which now rank among Russia’s best-selling cars. Rising local Russian demand for Chinese currency also drove RMB-ruble currency trade to its highest ever volume in July.\n\nAugust 5, 2022\n\n[Statement] Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying defends Russia when asked about the U.S. Senate resolution to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.

In an interview with the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper, Zelenskyy states that he “would really like China to review its attitude towards the Russian Federation” and “urged China to use its UN Security Council status to ‘show’ countries that they needed to comply with international norms.” Xi has not spoken with Zelenskyy since Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nAugust 3, 2022\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy states during an event at the Australian National University that he “would like China to join the unified world position” on Russia’s tyranny against Ukraine. He says, “As for now, China is balancing, and indeed has neutrality and, I will be honest, this neutrality is better than China joining Russia.”\n\nJuly 29, 2022\n\n[Sanctions] RUSAL, a Russian aluminum producer listed on the Hong Kong and Moscow exchanges, issues the first ever RMB-denominated bond in Russia. Alexei Grenkov, Head Corporate Finance of RUSAL, explains that “the Yuan [RMB] is a good alternative to traditional foreign exchange investments” to meet the growing demand from Russian banks and private investors for financial instruments that help them circumvent sanctions and the dollar-denominated financial system. International sanctions on Russia for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine have isolated many Russian banks from western financial institutions. Aluminum Insider reports that three Russian banks, Gazprombank, Credit Bank of Moscow, and Bank Zenit, managed the bond’s issuance.\n\nJuly 28, 2022\n\n[Statement] U.S. President Joe Biden holds a phone call with General Secretary Xi Jinping.

A price cap on Russian oil would limit Russia’s revenue from Chinese and other countries’ purchases by preventing U.S., U.K. and European institutions from providing financing or insurance to shipments of Russian oil sold above the proposed price cap. The Chinese readout of the call describes the exchanges as “constructive” but does not mention any discussion of Russia’s war against Ukraine.\n\nJune 30, 2022\n\n[Statement] China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian states NATO chose to “smear China’s foreign policy and point fingers at China’s normal military posture and defense policy” in its 2022 Strategic Concept, NATO’s strategic planning document which noted China’s support for Russia in the Ukraine war. Zhao asserts that NATO “poses systemic challenges to world security and stability” and seeks to “destabilize Europe and the Asia-Pacific.”\n\nJune 29, 2022\n\nNATO allies adopt the 2022 Strategic Concept, which states the “deepening strategic partnership between the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order run counter to our values and interests.” NATO allies pledge to work together to “address the systemic challenges posed by the PRC to Euro-Atlantic security and ensure NATO’s enduring ability to guarantee the defense and security of Allies.”\n\n[Statement, Sanctions] China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian states that the U.S. Department of Commerce’s decision on June 28 to sanction five Chinese companies over their support for Russia’s military is “another example of U.S. unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction.” The Department of Commerce included the five companies on the Entity List, which effectively prevents U.S. firms from exporting to these companies. Responding to a follow-up question from Reuters, Zhao does not evaluate whether these Chinese companies sold goods to Russian military entities, asserting “there is no basis for the U.S. to slap sanctions on Chinese companies by citing domestic laws.”\n\n[Statement] China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian condemns the Leader’s Communiqué from the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations (G7) summit on June 28, stating “the G7, rather than committing to solidarity and cooperation, is preoccupied with stoking division and confrontation and has shown absolutely no sense of responsibility or moral authority.” The communiqué outlines China’s disruptive economic, foreign, and security policies and calls on China “to press Russia to immediately comply with the legally binding order of the International Court of Justice of 16 March 2022 and to abide by the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly and stop its military aggression – and immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine.”\n\nJune 28, 2022\n\n[Sanctions] The U.S. Department of Commerce adds five Chinese companies to the Entity List over their continued support of Russia’s military efforts since Russia invaded Ukraine despite export controls aimed at blocking Russia’s access to dual-use technology and equipment.

According to an Indian customs document reviewed by Reuters, India’s UltraTech Cement purchased 157,000 tons of coal from Russia’s SUEK using RMB. An Indian government official who spoke with Reuters, stated that “the use of the yuan to settle payments for imports from countries other than China was rare until now, and could increase due to sanctions on Russia.” It may be difficult for Indian companies to acquire RMB for transactions with Russia, however, as People’s Bank of China’s interbank foreign exchange trading platform does not currently process direct exchanges of rupee for renminbi.\n\nJune 23, 2022\n\n[Statement] General Secretary Xi Jinping speaks at the BRICS Leaders’ Summit, which brings together the heads of state of five emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.

It does not target any third party.” He states that China does “not believe that maximum pressure or sanctions can solve the problem. If anything, they may even exacerbate tensions and further complicate the issues.”\n\n[Action] The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a think tank based in Finland, estimates that China has imported 12.6 billion euro ($13.2 billion) in oil from Russia since the start of the war in Ukraine.

Lavrov specifically identifies the opportunity to use local currencies for bilateral trade settlement, which has historically relied on the use of euro and dollar before the United States, G7, and the EU isolated Russian banks from western financial institutions, raising barriers to transacting in these currencies. Transacting using rubles or RMB could facilitate trade between the two countries. According to the South China Morning Post report, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi did not comment on financial cooperation, choosing only to reiterate China’s stance that military blocs do not guarantee regional security. The virtual event is not listed on the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs page for Ministry activities.\n\nJune 1, 2022\n\n[Action] The Nikkei reports that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) changed the venue for its October annual meeting to a virtual format hosted by the bank’s Beijing headquarters.

Sources who spoke with RBK said that China is requiring Russian airlines to provide evidence that their Boeing and Airbus planes are de-registered abroad, showing proof that they are Russian-owned. While many of the planes operated by Russian airlines are leased from international lessors, Russia passed a law in March permitting Russian airlines to dual register these aircraft in Russia and continue service, in violation of international law. Russian-operated Boeing and Airbus aircraft are also impacted by U.S. and EU export controls, including prohibitions on providing maintenance components, which has raised safety concerns from other aviation authorities. The United States has also identified a list of noncompliant aircraft operated by Russian entities and could take enforcement actions against “any person, anywhere” who provides any services, even refueling, to these aircraft.\n\n[Sanctions] Bloombergreports that China International United Petroleum & Chemical Co., a subsidiary of state-owned Sinopec, has hired ten additional tankers to transport Russian crude oil loaded at Kozmino port.

The resolution, which is approved by a majority, states that the body could consider Russia in violation of the Constitution of the WHO if it does not cease attacks against healthcare facilities in Ukraine. China also votes in favor of an alternative proposal from Russia and Syria which contains similar support for humanitarian efforts but lacks the other proposal’s provisions targeting Russia.

According to Reuters, Yang states that the WHO is “the wrong forum for discussing Ukraine’s health problems.”\n\nMay 24, 2022\n\n[Action] China and Russia hold their first joint military exercise since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The People’s Liberation Army Air Force and the Russian Air Force conduct aerial patrols with four bombers over the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan near Japan’s airspace. Japan’s Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi calls this action more provocative than past drills because it occurred during the Quad summit in Japan. Kishi also asserts that in light of “Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, the fact that China took such action … cannot be overlooked.”\n\n[Statement] Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin expresses China’s appreciation for Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s statement that Russia will focus on developing relations with China and “reliable” countries to reduce its dependence on Western imports.
