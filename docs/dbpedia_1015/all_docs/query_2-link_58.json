Financial questions\n\na. What does billing day mean?\n\nBilling day is a fixed day for each user every month. Users are billed on a monthly basis on their billing day, for the past period, on the basis of the chosen tariff plan (or tariff plans in case the tariff plan was changed during the billing period), and taking into account the actual amount of services used.\n\nb. How the price for a video program is calculated\n\nThe price for a movie or a program is calculated based on the determined length of the program (see table “Length”).\n\nIf the User has watched at least 5% (or 1 / 20 part) of the specified duration of the movie or program, he/she is not charged. For example, if the specified length of the movie or program is 40 minutes long, 5% (or 1 / 20 part) of this length is 2 minutes. If the User watched less than 2 minutes, he/she will not be charged.\n\nIf the User has watched more than 5% (or 1 / 20 part) of the specified duration of the movie or program, he/she is charged in full (as if watching the movie or program in full). For example, if the movie or program is 40 minutes long and the User has watched more than 2 minutes, he/she will be charged. The charge is calculated the following way:\n\n- for tariff plan «Pay As You Go»: $0.60 * 40 min / 60 min = $0.40;\n\n- for tariff plan «Pay As You Go»: $0.50 * 40 min / 60 min = $0.33;\n\n- for tariff plan «Economic»: $0.45 * 40 min / 60 min = $0.30;\n\n- for tariff plan «Convenient»: $0.39 * 40 min / 60 min = $0.26\n\nThere is no charge for repeated viewings of the same movie or program within the same 24 hour period.\n\nWhen watching movies and programs you can use the \"Pause\" and \"Rewind\" features and ni additional fees are charged.\n\nc. Hours, included in each tariff plan\n\nA specific number of hours are included in monthly payment for all tariff plans except for \"Unlimited\" tariff. More information can be found here. When the numbers of hours included in the chosen tariff plan are used up, the service does not stop and every additional hour is a charged according to the chosen tariff plan. The User can constantly monitor the number of hours viewed, the number of days remaining until the end of the billing period and so on in “My account” page. This data can help the User in deciding whether there is a need to change the tariff plan. More details about the change of tariff plans.\n\nd. Billing\n\nUsers are billed on a monthly basis on their billing day for the past period on the basis of the chosen tariff plan (or tariff plans in case the tariff plan was changed during the billing period), and taking into account the actual amount of services used. The bill will also include applicable taxes, if any.\n\nf. How is the monthly bill calculated?\n\nBills are based on the selected tariff plan (or tariff plans in case the tariff plan was changed during the billing period) and on the actual amount of services used. Consider an example:\n\n- The User’s billing day is the 23rd of each month\n\n- Having an \"Unlimited\" tariff plan and having watched 25 hours up until July 29th, the User goes on a vacation and asks to temporary suspend the service.\n\n- When the User returns on August 14th he decides to resume the service and switch to \"Comfortable\" tariff plan.

Payment\n\nPayment of accounts shall be made by User on the set billing day.\n\nh. What penalties exist?\n\nPenalties exist only in connection with financial matters, for example, a check with non-sufficient funds, chargeback, etc. The amount of the fine is determined by the bank's fees for such matters.\n\nNo other additional fees or penalties for use, enable, disable, change the user account is not charged.\n\ni. Can bills be paid automatically?\n\nAutomatic payment is provided as one of the payment options in “My account” page when the user clicks on the link “Enter the user credit card details”. The bill amount is automatically deducted monthly from the User’s credit card on the billing day until the User asks to deactivate this feature or suspend the service.

Consider an example:\n\n- We never ask to enter the any credit card details. In the e-mail letter there are no direct links leading to pages associated with payment for the services.\n\n- We will never ask the User to re-register.
