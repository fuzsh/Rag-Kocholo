Properly located inside of Emperia Tower, one of the dazzling towers of \"Moscow City\" complex. \"Hotel\" comprises of 7 rooms co-located on the same floor with several business offices. However, it's not presenting any discomfort or unconvince. Hotel rooms are on the small size, except one which is corner larger room. Perfect size for single travellers. Amazing view from 48th floor over Moscow takes your breath away. When I stayed Internet was not super stable. Prepare to rely on your own phone. Breakfast was great. Fresh home made stuff! Yumm. Pleasant and helpful staff. Small inconvenience, when you returning back to the building you need to go see downstairs tower attendant for entry pass card EVERY TIME you enter the building. But, if you gone all day it's not a big deal. There is a huge Mall called Afimal right next to it.
