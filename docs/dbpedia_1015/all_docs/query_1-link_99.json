        "text": "At least eight people have died in a large office building fire near Moscow, the regional Governor Andrey Vorobyov has said.\n\nEmergency officials told the state-owned Tass news agency that just one person was rescued from the blaze at the burning building in Fryazino, about 25km (15.5 miles) north-east of the capital.\n\nTwo people were killed after they jumped from a window, while six died when the interior of the office collapsed in the blaze, Mr Voroyov wrote in a post to social media.\n\nFootage online showed thick smoke billowing from the upper floors of the eight-storey complex.\n\nThere are conflicting reports about the building's purpose. It once homed the Platan Research Institute and defence industry, according to Tass.\n\nA statement to the agency from Ruselectronics, a Russia-owned electronics organisation, said the building has been privately owned since the 1990s.\n\nHowever, opposition media outlets recently reported that Platan was based in the building as late as 2023.\n\nMr Vorobyov said that a 34-year-old man had been taken to hospital in a serious condition, while two firefighters were also being treated for injuries sustained in the blaze. Local emergency services said the man was the only person rescued from the blaze."
