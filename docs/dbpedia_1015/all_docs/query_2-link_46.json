        "text": "Moldova has temporarily suspended the broadcast licenses of six television channels for airing \"incorrect information\" about the country and Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe six TV stations are owned or affiliated with businessman Ilan Șhor, who is a fugitive from Moldovan justice and who has been designated for sanctions by the United States and Britain.\n\nThe stations have seriously and repeatedly violated Moldova’s Audiovisual Services Code in broadcasting information related to the war in Ukraine, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilița said on Facebook.\n\n“After almost 300 days of war in Ukraine, the propaganda in the Republic of Moldova has not stopped, in fact it has intensified,” Gavrilita said. “In the situation where not only an energy war is being waged against our country, but also an information war, we have the responsibility and even the obligation to protect our citizens and the country.”\n\nShe added that the decision aims to “secure the information space in the country, to eliminate manipulation and propaganda, corrupt and particularly dangerous elements, especially in the difficult period we are going through.”\n\nTV6, one of the channels whose license was suspended, said the decision was illegal and an \"unprecedented attack on freedom of expression, editorial freedom, [and] freedom of journalists.\"\n\nThe channel, which is owned by Shor, said the arguments put forth by the country’s Commission for Exceptional Situations, which announced the decision, were unfounded and false.\n\nShor owns two of the other six channels; another two belong to his close associates; the sixth channel suspended sympathizes with him.\n\n\"Moldova must be protected from propaganda and lies,\" Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu said on Telegram.\n\nThe six channels, he said, had covered Moldova and the war \"in a biased and manipulative manner.\"\n\nRussia denounced a decision as \"political censorship.”\n\nThe ban will start on December 19 and last for the duration of a state of emergency that Moldova declared after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The state of emergency has been renewed several times and currently is due to expire in February.\n\nBritain on December 9 announced the sanctions against Shor and another fugitive, Vladimir Plahotniuc, a businessman and a former politician. The two were sanctioned in October by the U.S. Treasury Department “for actions related to systemic corruption and interference in the elections in Moldova, supported by the Kremlin.\"\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nReviving the Iran nuclear deal remains off the agenda for the Biden administration, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said on August 26, as Tehran called for “new negotiations” to update the agreement before it can be revived.\n\nIran’s new foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, said last week that the agreement “cannot be revived in its current form” due to sunset clauses that have expired and insisted that new talks are needed to resuscitate the agreement.\n\nHowever, a State Department spokesperson told RFE/RL that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the 2015 nuclear accord is formally known, “is not on the table right now.” The United States unilaterally exited the deal in 2018 under then-U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n“The United States will ensure one way or another that Iran will never have a nuclear weapon, and we are prepared to use all elements of national power to ensure that outcome,” the spokesperson said.\n\nStill, Washington views “diplomacy as the best way to achieve a sustainable, effective solution,” the spokesperson said.\n\nDuring a televised interview, Araqchi conceded that renegotiating the agreement would be challenging.\n\n“This document definitely needs to be reopened and parts of it needs to be changed. That is no easy task because once you reopen a document, putting it back together will be challenging,” he said in a live television interview.\n\nComplicating matters further are the November presidential election in the United States and ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nAraqchi said the Ukraine war had “deeply impacted how Europeans view security,” while the Gaza conflict has “completely upended the situation in the region.”\n\nThe minister, who was one of the architects of the deal between Iran and six major world powers, said the format of talks since 2021 to revive the agreement can no longer work.\n\n“New negotiations are needed,” Araqchi added.\n\nThe deal restricted Iran’s nuclear program and capped uranium enrichment at 3.67 percent. In return, the United States lifted sanctions that had suffocated Iran’s economy and energy sectors.\n\nBut Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that had been lifted under its terms. Iran retaliated by gradually scaling back its commitments and is currently enriching uranium at 60 percent.\n\nAraqchi, then a deputy foreign minister, led Iran’s negotiating team when Tehran and Washington started indirect talks in April 2021 to restore the agreement. Negotiations paused when hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi came to power in Iran and a new team of negotiators entered the fray.\n\nBut talks were suspended in September 2022 in the wake of nationwide protests that rocked Iran for months. Hundreds were killed in the unrest as the authorities cracked down on demonstrations.\n\nIran's new president, Masud Pezeshkian, who succeeded Raisi after he died in a helicopter crash earlier this year, has vowed to engage the West.\n\nBut the ultimate decision-maker in Iran is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has praised efforts by conservatives to expand the country's nuclear program.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Ukraine's global allies to take \"decisive action\" after Russia launched a massive drone and missile attack on Kyiv and other cities across the country that damaged vital utilities.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nThe Russian strikes targeted several Ukrainian cities early on August 26, killing at least three people and wounding several others, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nZelenskiy, in a video message posted on X, said the \"vile\" attacks, involving more than 100 missiles and around 100 drones, showed the West's restrictions keeping Ukraine from using long-range weapons to strike deep inside Russian territory must be lifted.\n\n\"Ukraine cannot be constrained in its long-range capabilities when the terrorists face no such limitations,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\n\"Weakness and inadequate responses fuel terror...Every leader, every one of our partners, knows the decisive actions required to end this war justly,\" he added while calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"sick creature.\"\n\nThe aerial attack was the largest in weeks from Moscow and comes as Ukrainian forces are advancing as they mount a major offensive into the Kursk region of Russia.\n\nKyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said water and power supplies in parts of the capital had been disrupted as Russia launched its large-scale attack during the morning rush hour.\n\nUkraine’s state-run energy authority Ukrenerho said that it was introducing emergency power outages.\n\nOne person was reportedly killed and a residential building was damaged in the northwestern city of Lutsk, according to the city’s mayor, Ihor Polischuk.\n\nTwo people were killed in the Zaporizhzhya and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to local authorities.\n\nIn the Poltava region, five people were wounded after an industrial facility was struck. Three explosions were reported in the Vinnytsia region\n\nEarlier, 16 regions across Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, are under fresh air raid alerts after Russia launched waves of drone attacks on August 26.\n\nUkraine’s Air Force Command had warned citizens not to ignore air raid alerts after it had detected 11 Russian Tu-95MS bombers taking off.\n\nThe Air Force Command added that it had detected drone movements in Chernihiv, Sumy, Cherkasy, Mykolayiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv, while the Ukrainian Navy said there are four Russian ships in the Black Sea carrying up to 28 Kalibr cruise missiles.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed that 20 Ukrainian drones had been destroyed overnight.\n\nThe governor of Russia’s Saratov region, Roman Busargin, said drones had targeted the cities of Saratov and Engels and damaged two residential buildings.\n\nHe said the damage was caused by falling debris after air defenses shot down the drones.\n\nRussian news agencies said four women were injured in Saratov, with one woman hospitalized. No casualties were reported in Engels.\n\nEngels and Saratov are located on the opposite banks of the Volga River, with a strategic bomber military base located around 12 kilometers from where the drones were intercepted. Saratov is around 900 km from the Ukrainian border.\n\nQuoting the airport’s press office, news agencies said flights were restricted at the regional Saratov airport.\n\nRFE/RL could not independently verify the reports.\n\nUkraine and Russia insist that they do not target civilians in their attacks but infrastructure critical to war efforts.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nIsrael has reportedly launched new strikes at Hizballah, which has been designated at terrorist organization by the United States, just inside Lebanon a day after a heavy exchange of missile and drone attacks between the two foes that Iran claimed showed a shift in the balance of power.\n\nState media reported on August 26 that Israel targeted the border village of Tair Harfa and an area near Sidon in Lebanon a day after Hizballah launched scores of rockets and drones against targets in northern and central Israel in the early hours of August 25. The attack came shortly after Israel carried out what it described as preemptive strikes targeting Hizballah’s rocket launchers.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties from Israel's strikes on August 26.\n\nIran said on August 26 that the exchange of fire, which marked one of the largest clashes to hit the Middle East since war broke out in the Gaza Strip last October, showed Israel has lost not only its ability to anticipate small-scale attacks but also its deterrent power.\n\n“Despite the full backing of its supporters, including the United States, Israel has lost its deterrent power and ability to predict the time and place of even a limited and calibrated attack,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani wrote on X, referring to the large-scale attack on Israel by Iran’s Lebanese ally Hizballah a day earlier.\n\n“The occupying regime has always sought territorial expansion, but now has to defend itself within the occupied territories,” Kanani added. “Fear has been embedded in the homes of the residents of the occupied lands.”\n\nIsraeli officials said the preemptive attack prevented the launch of “thousands” of rockets. Hizballah claimed to have launched more than 320 rockets and drones but Israel put the figure at around 150.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:50 0:00\n\nHizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah alleged that the group’s operation was calibrated to ensure it did not trigger a full-scale conflict.\n\nAddressing Nasrallah and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's preemptive operation was \"another step toward changing the situation in the north and returning our residents safely to their homes.\"\n\nHizballah said its operation was “phase one” of its retaliation for the killing of Fuad Shukr, widely believe to be Hizballah’s second-most powerful person. Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut on July 30.\n\nHours after Shukr’s assassination, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas was killed in Tehran. Iran vowed to avenge Ismail Haniyeh and accused Israel of killing him. Israel has neither denied nor claimed responsibility.\n\nIn his speech, Nasrallah said one reason why Hizballah took nearly a month to hit Israel was because it was discussing with Iran and other allies about whether to carry out a coordinated attack on Israel or attack separately.\n\nPressure has been growing on Iran to deliver on its promised attack against Israel to avenge Haniyeh.\n\nDuring a phone call on August 25 with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, Iran’s top diplomat Abbas Araqchi insisted that a “measured and well-calculated” response will come.\n\n“We do not fear escalation, yet do not seek it -- unlike Israel,” Araqchi told his Italian counterpart.\n\nIsrael and Hizballah, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, engaged in a massive exchange of missile fire on August 25, but signaled they were not looking to escalate the conflict amid fears of all-out war in the region.\n\nTensions also remained high near the Gaza Strip after Hamas – an Iran-backed group also designated a terrorist organization by the United States and EU – apparently fired an \"M90\" rocket toward Tel Aviv late on August 25, although Israeli officials said it fell harmlessly into an empty field.\n\n\"Following the siren that sounded in Rishon LeTsiyon, one projectile was identified crossing from the southern Gaza Strip and falling in an open area in the area of Rishon LeTsiyon,\" the Israeli military said.\n\nIn one of the biggest clashes to rock the Middle East since war broke out in the Gaza Strip last October, Israel said it launched preemptive air strikes on targets of Iran-backed Hizballah in southern Lebanon after Israeli intelligence detected that Hizballah was planning to attack in the morning.\n\nHizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech later in the day that the attacks, which did not include using precision or strategic missiles, targeted \"the Glilot base -- the main Israeli military intelligence base,\" near Tel Aviv, about 100 kilometers across the southern Lebanese border with Israel.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:50 0:00\n\nNasrallah added in the televised speech that Israel began striking Hizballah targets about 30 minutes before the group launched its attack, which was in response to the killing of one of its commanders.\n\nAddressing Nasrallah and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's preemptive operation was \"another step toward changing the situation in the north and returning our residents safely to their homes.\"\n\nThousands have been displaced in northern Israel as Hizballah and Israel continue to trade cross-border attacks, which have intensified since war broke out in Gaza following an October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas that left some 1,200 people dead and scores more taken hostage.\n\nThe August 25 exchange of hundreds of missiles and drones sparked fears that the war may escalate and engulf the entire region, but a Hizballah official said in a written statement to media outlets that the group had \"worked\" to ensure its attack would not trigger a full-scale war.\n\nReuters quoted its diplomatic sources as saying Israel and Hizballah exchanged messages following the exchange saying neither wanted to escalate the conflict further.\n\nRanda Slim, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Middle East Institute, said that at least for now, the scope of the strikes from both sides may be enough to avoid a major war between Israel and Hizballah \"because both sides do not want it.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said around 100 fighter jets \"eliminated thousands of Hizballah rocket-launcher barrels\" that had been \"aimed for immediate fire\" toward northern and central Israel.\n\nHizballah said the attack was \"phase one\" of its retaliation for the killing of its top commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli strike on July 30 in Beirut. It insisted the operation had been \"completed successfully.\"\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant declared a 48-hour state of emergency across Israel.\n\nThe IDF said Hizballah had fired 150 projectiles, but Hizballah claimed to have launched more than 320 Katyusha rockets.\n\nIsraeli fighter jets continued to strike Hizballah rocket launchers after the group's attack to \"remove threats.\"\n\nThree people were killed in areas in southern Lebanon, according to the country's Health Ministry.\n\nThe extent of damage caused by Hizballah's attack is unclear. Video footage on social media showed some rockets being intercepted and the aftermath of several rockets making impact.\n\nThe Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon called the developments \"worrying\" and called \"on all to cease fire and refrain from further escalatory action.\"\n\n\"We will continue our contacts to strongly urge for de-escalation,\" it said.\n\nHizballah and Israel have inched even closer to a full-blown war for weeks, especially after the death of 12 people in an apparent Hizballah rocket attack in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on July 27.\n\nThree days later, Israel struck a target in Beirut, killing Shukr, who was widely believed to be the second-most powerful person in Hizballah's hierarchy behind Nasrallah.\n\nDiplomats, meanwhile, huddled in Egypt on August 25 for high-level talks aimed at brokering a cease-fire in the 10-month-old war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.\n\nLater, a Hamas representative said the group's delegation left Cairo after meeting with Egyptian and Qatari mediators “who briefed them on the results of the latest negotiations\" and said it had rejected Israel's latest terms for a cease-fire.\n\nIsrael's attack on Gaza has killed more than 40,000 people, according to the local Hamas-run health authorities.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nSix people were killed in Ukrainian attacks in the Russian border region of Belgorod, local officials said on August 25, as Ukrainian authorities reported that several people -- including Western news agency staffers -- were among the dead and wounded in Russian strikes across the country.\n\nMeanwhile, in his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his forces made further advances deeper into Russia's Kursk region and had taken control of two additional settlements.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

Two more settlements were taken under control,\" said Zelenskiy, who added that \"active actions” were continuing.\n\nIn Russia, Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that five civilians were killed and 12 others were wounded in Ukrainian shelling in the town of Rakitnoye. One person was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on the village of Solovyovka, he added.\n\nGladkov said six of the wounded were in serious condition, including a 16-year-old girl who was in intensive care.\n\nThe claims cannot be independently verified.\n\nRussian authorities declared a state of emergency in Belgorod earlier this month, and Moscow said it was sending more troops to defend the region following Ukraine's surprise cross-border incursion into neighboring Kursk on August 6.\n\nUkraine has since captured more than 90 settlements in the Kursk region, according to Kyiv, the biggest invasion of Russia since World War II.\n\nIn the Ukrainian city of Sumy -- some 30 kilometers from the Russian border -- authorities on August 25 reported that heavy Russian shelling killed at least four people and injured 13 others over the past 24 hours.\n\nAuthorities also said one person was killed and several others were wounded in Kharkiv and Donetsk regions in Russian missile and drone attacks.\n\nDonetsk regional officials said the body of a British citizen was recovered from the rubble following an overnight strike at a hotel in Kramatorsk, a city of some 147,000 people in southeastern Ukraine.\n\nReuters later identified the person as Ryan Evans, 38, who was working as a safety adviser for Reuters. Evans, a former British soldier, had been with the news agency since 2022, advising staffers on safety issues at sites around the world.\n\nOfficials said four journalists -- including those with German, Latvian, and U.S. citizenship -- and two local citizens were among the injured, but the report could not immediately be confirmed.\n\nReuters earlier said several team members had been at the hotel but couldn't immediately confirm their whereabouts or status.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:01:39 0:00\n\nVadym Filashkin, head of the Donetsk regional government, wrote on Telegram that the hotel was destroyed and that \"17 private houses, six high-rise buildings, three enterprises, an administrative building, and a coffeeshop were damaged.\"\n\nRussian attacks hit residential buildings in Kharkiv's Balakliya, Chuhuiv, and Kupyansk districts, as well as the regional capital, Kharkiv city, wounding at least 17 people and damaging several houses, local authorities said.\n\nRussia launched several missile and drone attacks overnight, targeting northern and eastern regions, but Ukraine’s air-defense systems destroyed most of the weapons before they reached their targets, Ukraine's air force said.\n\n\"Most of the missiles did not reach their targets,\" the air force said on Telegram, adding that Russia launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile, an Iskander-K cruise missile, and six guided air missiles. It did not specify how many missiles were destroyed.\n\nThe air-defense systems shot down eight of the nine drones launched by Russian forces overnight over the Mykolayiv region, the air force claimed.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, Zelenskiy on August 25 said talks with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, and Switzerland were continuing regarding a potential second peace summit.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader also said he had told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his recent visit to Kyiv that he would support India hosting the summit.\n\n\"This applies not only to India but to any state that would be positive about hosting a second summit,” Zelenskiy added.\n\nSome 80 countries, but not Russia, met in Switzerland in mid-June to discuss the potential for a peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nZelenskiy has insisted Ukraine's territorial integrity must be the foundation of any peace deal, while Russia has said conditions for ending the war include Kyiv renouncing its desire to join NATO and ceding Crimea and four other occupied regions of Ukraine.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry in Kyiv also said on August 25 that Ukrainian intelligence agencies had reported that Belarusian armed forces, under the guise of military exercises, have been concentrating a significant number of personnel, weapons, and equipment including tanks, artillery, rocket launchers, air-defense systems, and engineering equipment its border with Ukraine.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, and AP\n\nVARNA, Bulgaria -- Teachers in Bulgaria say they are facing threats for signing a petition opposing recently passed legislation banning “LGBT propaganda” in schools and point the finger of blame at the far-right Revival party, initiator of the widely criticized controversial law.\n\nThe leader of Revival, Kostadin Kostadinov, said on August 22 that he would file a report with the Prosecutor’s Office about educators who have voiced opposition to the law.\n\nThe law, passed on August 7 in parliament with the backing of pro-European parties, sparked protests in Sofia and elsewhere in the largely conservative Balkan country of some 6.5 million people.\n\nThe amendment to the country's education code prohibits the \"propaganda, promotion, or incitement\" of LGBT \"ideas and views\" in schools, without specifying further details.\n\nThe pro-Western reformist We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria (PP-DB) coalition is still hoping to gather support in the National Assembly, Bulgaria's unicameral parliament, to repeal the legislation.\n\n​Critics said the law is nearly identical to the Russian anti-LGBT propaganda law adopted in 2012 and the Hungarian anti-LGBT propaganda law adopted in 2021, both of which have been deemed by various international stakeholders and institutions as incompatible with international and European human rights standards.\n\nBulgaria is one of the few countries in the European Union that does not give equal civil rights to people of differing sexual orientations. Last year, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg obliged Bulgaria to create a legal framework to recognize same-sex relationships, an obligation with which Sofia has not yet complied.\n\nThe LGBT community and supporters in Bulgaria often face verbal as well as physical threats and attack, including the 2021 targeting of an LGBT center in Sofia.\n\nSome 460 teachers and other specialists in the educational field signed a petition to demand the amended law to be scrapped. About 20 from the Black Sea resort of Varna said they were targeted by the local branch of the Revival party, including on Facebook.\n\nMartin Stoyanov, a school psychologist in Varna, said a teacher in the Black Sea town had contacted him late one night recently on Viber, expressing fears over the recent threats.\n\n\"At some point we're becoming a country where it's dangerous to express your opinion,\" Stoyanov told RFE/RL’s Bulgarian Service.\n\nThe Facebook post on August 21 on the account linked to the Varna branch of the Revival party included what it termed a \"black list\" of local educators who had signed the petition -- including Stoyanov -- against the newly amended law, referring to them as \"parasites.\"\n\nA day later, Kostadinov, long a controversial figure and spreader of pro-Kremlin disinformation, said he would hand over to the Prosecutor's Office the names of some 800 teachers he claimed were \"criminals\" who \"want to push homosexual propaganda.\"\n\nThe threatened teachers in Varna have received much support.\n\nThe mayor of Varna, Blagomir Kotsev, voiced his support in a Facebook post on August 22, urging them to be brave and to personally contact him if they are threatened.\n\nPavel Popov, Varna’s deputy mayor who is also in charge of educational matters, told RFE/RL that Revival was calling for \"repressive actions against Bulgarian teachers.\"\n\n\"Bulgarian teachers cannot be talked about in this way,\" said Stella Nikolova, a member of the National Assembly from Varna and a member of the PP-DB bloc in a Facebook post on August 22.\n\n\"We demand that all institutions take action to protect citizens' rights and to be held accountable for the fascist methods by which a political power operates,\" Nikolova wrote.\n\nThe Revival party did not respond to request by RFE/RL’s Bulgarian Service for comment.\n\nSeveral petitions have been launched condemning the vaguely worded changes to education code. One that garnered the signatures of nearly 460 teachers and educators was spearheaded by Boris Iliev, a teacher of Bulgarian literature and language at the National Science and Mathematics High School in Sofia.\n\n\"We have authentic arguments against the changes because our work depends on this law,\" Iliev told RFE/RL.\n\n\"When I saw the threats made against colleagues, I was extremely worried,\" Iliev added.\n\nDenislava Nikolaeva said she was shocked when the name of her son’s teacher appeared on the Revival posting.\n\n\"We are collapsing as a society,\" Denislava told RFE/RL.\n\nAs Ukraine marks 33 years of independence on August 24, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has announced that 115 Ukrainian prisoners were released in a swap with Russia.\n\n\"Another 115 of our defenders have returned home today. They are warriors from the National Guard, the Armed Forces, the Navy, and the State Border Guard Service,\" Zelenskiy said in a message on X.\n\n\"We remember everyone.
