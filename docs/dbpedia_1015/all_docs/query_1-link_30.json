        "text": "Pant, vice-president for studies and foreign policy at the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think tank, said India is seeking to maintain open communication channels with Russia as Moscow’s relationship with Beijing deepens.\n\nIsolated from the West, Russia has become increasingly reliant on India and China to buy its oil as its economy continues to sputter amid the war in Ukraine.\n\n“There will also be an attempt to understand where Russia is going with China and what the future possibilities of India-Russia defence relations are as well. From multiple fronts, this is an important visit,” Pant said.\n\nSanction considerations\n\nModi’s trip comes amid Washington’s dissatisfaction with some Indian companies for violating global sanctions against Russia.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Hindu’s Businessline news outlet, US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said any Indian company that violated global sanctions against Russia would have to be aware of the “consequences”.\n\nThe company, which was also previously sanctioned by the EU and US, is a partner of the Indian IT ministry’s “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (Make in India) campaign.\n\nThe US has sanctioned more than 4,000 Russian businesses and individuals around the world since the start of the Ukraine war.\n\nMichael Rubin, a former Pentagon official, told This Week in Asia that Modi’s trip to Moscow would not affect India’s relations with the US, as the two countries were strategically important to each other.\n\n“That said, Washington will continue to push New Delhi to see the world its way. Garcetti is right on one point, though. Some sanctions have waivers and wiggle room to make exceptions for allies, but others do not,” Rubin said.\n\nRubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said Indian companies should not think they can use their connections to get around the consequences of violating US regulations.\n\n“Ultimately, Indian companies will need to make a cost-benefit assessment … will they gain more from working with the United States or with Russia?”\n\nPant said the US has thus far chosen not to punish India over its relationship with Russia.\n\n“I think the issues around Indian companies, the impact of sanctions … all of that the Americans have been observing. But so far they have largely given India a long rope ignoring relations [between Delhi and Moscow],” he said.\n\n“So it would also depend on what kind of outcome this [summit] produces,” Pant said.\n\nClose ties in trade and defence\n\nFormer Indian diplomat Anil Trigunayat noted that Russia and India have a strong strategic partnership with engagement across various fields.\n\nThe Modi-Putin summit would also offer perspective on whether India could play a role in bringing about an end to the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, he said.\n\nRussia and India have maintained strong ties with each other since the Cold War. Despite its closer ties with the US and European nations in recent years, India continues to buy Russian oil, disregarding Western sanctions against the Kremlin.\n\nIndia’s exports to Russia rose by 35 per cent to US$4.26 billion in 2023-24. Its imports from Russia increased by 33 per cent to US$61.43 billion over the same period, with oil purchases accounting for almost 90 per cent of imports.\n\nRussia’s market share of India’s arms imports has shrunk over the decades.\n\nFrom 2009-2013, Russia accounted for 76 per cent of India’s arms imports before its share fell to 36 per cent from 2019-2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nRajan Kumar, an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University’s School of International Studies, said Modi’s visit was aimed at restoring Russian confidence in their bilateral ties.\n\nPreviously, the Indian and Russian leaders would meet regularly but their summits were disrupted by the pandemic and the Ukraine war, Kumar said.\n\n“So the people started raising concerns, especially from the Russian side about India’s shifting policies.”\n\nKumar said Western countries hoped India would downgrade its ties with Russia, but they were also aware of Delhi’s pressing economic and defence needs.\n\n“India is now engaging with multiple countries for its economic and defence requirements and among them all, Russia is very critical for them,” he said.\n\nKumar said he did not expect the US to impose sanctions against Delhi over its ties with Moscow as Washington perceived India as a crucial country in counteracting China.\n\n“India wants the US by its side but at the same time India knows it can never be a subordinate ally with the US … India is a big country with powerful neighbours so our policy cannot be in complete alignment with US policies,” he added."
