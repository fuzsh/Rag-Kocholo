        "text": "MoSCoW prioritization, also known as the MoSCoW method or MoSCoW analysis, is a popular prioritization technique for managing and prioritizing requirements.\n\nIn the series of articles on Product prioritization frameworks, today, we will deep dive into the MoSCoW prioritization framework.\n\nThe MoSCoW prioritization framework was developed by Dai Clegg while working at Oracle in 1994 and first used in the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) ‚Äî an agile project delivery framework.\n\nThe MoSCoW method helps you prioritize product features into four clear categories typically with fixed timeframes.\n\nMust have (Mo)\n\nShould have (S)\n\nCould have (Co)\n\nWon‚Äôt have (W)\n\nProduct teams are focused on implementing the ‚ÄúMust Have‚Äù initiatives over the other buckets. This helps in delivering features that has the most immediate business value first.\n\nHow does MoSCoW prioritization framework help?\n\nThere are a few challenges with product prioritization in every organization namely -\n\nTeam members often derive pleasure in working on their ideas that they find fun instead of initiatives with higher impact. That‚Äôs natural! üòÑ\n\nIdeas that originate from the highest paid individual make more easily into the roadmap üòâ\n\nSometimes personal bias and confirmation bias creeps in too üôç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nThe MoSCoW method is a great way to establish strict release criteria and prevent teams from falling into that trap.\n\nUnderstanding categories of the MoSCoW model\n\nAs described earlier, Product teams are focused on implementing the ‚ÄúMust Have‚Äù initiatives before the rest of them.\n\n‚ÄúShould Have‚Äù and ‚ÄúCould Have‚Äù features are important, but they‚Äôre the first to be dropped if resources or deadline pressures occur.\n\nAnd of course, the ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt Have‚Äù don‚Äôt even get discussed. Let us understand these buckets in detail.\n\nMust-haves (M)\n\nThese are the essential features or requirements that must be implemented for the project to be considered successful. They are critical and non-negotiable.\n\nIn software development, for instance, must-have features might include basic functionalities crucial for user interaction or compliance with industry standards. These are the building blocks that define the project‚Äôs minimum viable product (MVP).\n\nShould-haves (S)\n\nThese are important features that should be included if possible. They are not as critical as must-haves but add significant value to the project.\n\nIn the context of a software application, should-have features could include additional functionalities that improve user convenience or advanced features that differentiate the product from competitors. Striking the right balance between must-haves and should-haves is crucial for delivering a product that meets both basic requirements and user expectations.\n\nCould-haves ¬©\n\nThese are desirable but not necessary features. They can be considered if time and resources permit but are often lower in priority compared to must-haves and should-haves.\n\nIn the software development realm, could-have features might include advanced functionalities that cater to a niche audience or experimental features that may be explored in later stages. The inclusion of could-haves depends on available resources, timelines, and the strategic vision for the project.\n\nWon‚Äôt-haves (W)\n\nThese are deliberately excluded items, either because they are not feasible or because they are not a priority at the current time. They may be considered for future phases or versions. Won‚Äôt-haves provide clarity about what is intentionally left out of the current development cycle.\n\nBy using the Moscow method, teams can make informed decisions about what to prioritize and focus on during the project development. It provides a framework for discussions about scope and helps manage expectations regarding what will and won‚Äôt be included in a given iteration or release.\n\nAbove is a nice depiction of MoSCoW model from userwell.com\n\nSummary\n\nIn short, use MoSCoW method when -\n\nYou need to communicate what needs to be included in a release\n\nIdentify product launch criteria\n\nOn the flip side, while MoSCoW can help you prioritize across modules, you can‚Äôt use it to prioritize between features grouped in the same category.\n\nThus, by categorizing requirements into must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, and won‚Äôt-haves, teams can make informed decisions, manage stakeholder expectations, and deliver products that align with both the project‚Äôs objectives and user expectations.\n\nGo ahead, give this a try in your next project!\n\nI hope you like this article. Stay tuned for more üòÑ"
