        "text": "The Kremlin yesterday abruptly silenced TVS, Russia's only remaining independent TV station, raising renewed concern for press freedom in Russia ahead of a state visit to Britain by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe debt-ridden broadcaster, one of four main terrestrial channels in Russia, was cut off during adverts at midnight on Saturday in a move that was described by the press ministry as being \"for the benefit of the audience\". TVS will, for now, be replaced with a sports channel.\n\nThe press ministry said the decision had not been \"an easy one\" but insisted that the company was in the throes of a financial crisis that made its survival impossible.\n\nStaff, some of whom learned of the shutdown on the radio on the way in to work, said the move was hardly unexpected given the heavy burden of debt weighing on TVS, but added that the sinister and abrupt nature of the shutdown was suspicious.\n\n\"I do not know what I should do - laugh or cry,\" said the company's director, Yevgeny Kiselyov, who heard of the decision in the media.\n\n\"The channel might have closed for the most trivial financial reason, but by taking this step, they [the government] have added a political dimension to their decision.\" Mr Kiselyov is one of Mr Putin's most outspoken critics.\n\nFew deny that TVS's chaotic finances jeopardised its operations. The station had been dropped by Moscow's main cable company for unpaid bills, depriving it of its largest viewer market, and its news director warned on Friday that the end might be imminent.\n\nThe company's funding was opaque: staff had not been paid for three months and it was starved of cash, partly due to infighting. Programming standards had dropped notably, as millions of dollars slated for soap operas did not go through. \"The ratings dropped compared to other programmes,\" Mr Kiselyov said.\n\nNevertheless, the overt state intervention led critics to allege that the government had unilaterally shut down the remaining outlet for criticism of the Kremlin.\n\nTelevision is hugely influential, particularly at election time, and the country has both parliamentary and presidential contests due in the next year.\n\nThe Kremlin had already muscled Mr Kiselyov and his journalistic team out of what was the biggest liberal independent station, NTV, two years ago, when it was taken over by the state-run gas monopoly, Gazprom.\n\nWhen the NTV team moved to another privately run channel, TV6, it was closed a year later on another financial pretext. The suspicion of a political motive behind the TVS closure serves as a reminder, two days before Mr Putin meets Tony Blair that the president's reputation in western circles as a reformer and liberal can jar with the situation on the ground.\n\nMany argue that the state of the mass media betrays the Putin administration's authoritarian backbone. Most outlets are either partly owned by the state or run by business conglomerates with loyalties to the Kremlin.\n\nIn the regions outside of Moscow, much of the media is entirely state-run. While a Kremlin official recently acknowledged that \"we cannot say our mass media is in the best condition\", he insisted that the goal was broad independent ownership of outlets that are self-sufficient through advertising.\n\nYet the state has controlling interests in three of the major four TV stations, the independent NTV television channel having come under control of the largest state company, Gazprom, two years ago.\n\nTVS was not a serious critic of the government, being sub ject to the self-censorship that inflicts Russian media in general - yet it was the only TV outlet that might have caused trouble in the presidential election next year.\n\nAnd Mr Kiselyov laid into Mr Putin regularly on a Sunday news show. Elena Afanasyeva, from the political journal Politburo, said: \"There is only one name behind this event, and that is Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. There is only one [big businessman behind] Russian TV, and that is the state.\"\n\nMr Kiselyov listed those he believed responsible: \"First of all the shareholders, then the management, then the ministry, and some people in power. But I would not like to name them now. The news is too recent and, in the fever of recent events, it would be very easy to make some errors.\"\n\nThe opposition MP Boris Nadezhdin said the closure was \"a logical conclusion\" of policy against independent media outlets.\n\n\"TVS was the last TV channel that ventured to criticise leaders. It is natural that leaders did not like it.\"\n\nSergei Ivanenko, first deputy head of the liberal Yabloko opposition party, said: \"Everything that has happened once again proves that business and power are inseparable.\""
