        "text": "Management today is all about prioritization- be a strategy- which some define as the art of prioritization, business analytics- deciding what is important to analyze, project management – to ensure most important areas get the right focus in the right sequence, marketing- to pick the right customer, right channels, etc or software development- to build the most important features first. Prioritization indeed is central to work, ensuring focus and achieving results.\n\nBut as teams diversify, and more stakeholders become involved in the process, so do the complexities surrounding tasks and deliverables for a project or company. As such, methods such as MoSCoW Prioritization can allow managers to prioritize certain products and deadlines in their workflows.\n\nIn this blog, we will talk about\n\nWhat is MoSCoW Prioritization?\n\nMoSCoW method is a prioritization technique for managing requirements and deadlines within a project. While it is defined in the context of project management, the ideas can apply to any discipline of management.\n\nIt is a functional tool that allows management to reach an understanding with the various stakeholders on the importance placed on various requirements and their delivery. The degree of importance identifies its placement on the prioritization list, with high importance requirements being prioritized over low importance requirements.\n\nMoSCoW method was originally developed in 1994 by Dai Clegg specifically for its use in Rapid Application Development. The initial scope of the technique was its use for timeboxed projects. With fixed deadlines to work with, MoSCoW gave Clegg a way to prioritize the tasks that were essential for the project, and sideline those that weren’t, in order to deliver the requirements on time. However, it soon evolved to become a key part of the latest management and prioritization thinking across disciplines.\n\nWhat is MoSCoW Prioritization Technique?\n\nThe MoSCoW Prioritization technique consists of four categories. These categories signify the importance of the task or deliverable to the overall success of the project, as well as those that are essential for its running.\n\nThese four categories are-\n\nHow to Use the MoSCoW Prioritization Method?\n\nUsually, the MoSCoW Prioritization Method is used early in the life cycle of a project. The final list is a collaborative effort by the team, project heads, department heads, upper management, and stakeholders. Everyone that has a vested interest in the project is expected to participate in the process of delineating the different items into different categories. This ensures smooth functioning of the project, where everyone is aware of and aligned to the project’s and stakeholders’ priorities and objectives.\n\nThus, MoSCoW method allows projects to work with a broader perspective, and reach a consensus on the different tasks enabling effective decision making.\n\nIn order to achieve maximum effectiveness in using the MoSCoW Prioritization Method, there are certain things to keep in mind.\n\nBalancing the Priorities\n\nWhen deciding on the Must Have priorities, it becomes important to understand exactly what those are. A method to gauge Must Haves is by defining a product’s minimum usable subset. This is an articulation of the minimum requirements of a project for it to be viable, functional and by all accounts, considered a success.\n\nAnd other priorities, therefore, automatically become a contingency wherein beyond the must-haves, there is no outright effect on the functionality or success of a project.\n\nBalancing all the categories of prioritizations becomes key in successfully managing a project using MoSCoW. Having more must-haves than possible or viable for a team is a one-way ticket to disaster. A good rule of thumb is to have a maximum of 60% of your tasks and team effort be for must-haves. This leaves room for the team to build confidence in their work and their ability to deliver on time.\n\nDefining Prioritization Categories\n\nMust-haves are generally easy to identify when discussing priorities within a group of people. However, the difference between Should Have and Could Have priorities is subjective and can be a point of contention if there are drastically warring views on the same.\n\nTherefore, it is always a good idea to be extremely clear about the definitions and scope of the categories in question with an upfront discussion about the same with each stakeholder.\n\nWhen to Prioritize\n\nThis primarily refers to any new requirements that come up during the process of working on the project. New requirements will need to be categorized under the MoSCoW technique, but they cannot be too disruptive to the process that is already underway. Most importantly, they should not interfere with the previously agreed-upon limit of 60% of work being under must-haves, as that can be an instant demoralizing element for the team.\n\nKnowing when to prioritize any new requirements is key to the smooth functioning of a project.\n\nReviewing Priorities\n\nAt the end of each deliverable or project increment, all priorities need to be re-examined and discussed with the stakeholders. The working process often highlights misplaced and missing priorities, and those need to be included for the next deliverable. It is also important to review all priorities as a low-priority task may now have greater importance in the project.\n\nSlideUpLift Templates for Presenting MoSCoW Prioritization Technique\n\nSlideUpLift offers a vast collection of pre-made presentation templates that can be used to present your MoSCoW Prioritization Technique to all stakeholders and team members, becoming an effective tool for business and professional communication.
