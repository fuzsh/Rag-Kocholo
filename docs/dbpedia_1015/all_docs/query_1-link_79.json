        "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that the brutal attack at a Moscow concert hall on Friday was carried out by “radical Islamists.”\n\nHe also again suggested that Ukraine was to blame for the attack.\n\n“It is also necessary to answer the question why the terrorists tried to go to Ukraine after committing a crime, who was waiting for them there? It is clear that those who support the Kyiv regime do not want to be accomplices of terror and sponsors of terrorism, but there are really a lot of questions,” he said in a meeting via videoconference with government officials, special services and law enforcement agencies on measures taken after the terrorist attack, according to the Kremlin.\n\n“We know by whose hands this atrocity was committed against Russia and its people, and we are interested in who the instigator is,” Putin said.\n\nISIS claimed responsibility for the massacre and released graphic footage showing the incident – but the Kremlin has alleged, without evidence, that the perpetrators planned to flee to Ukraine. Kyiv has vehemently denied involvement and called the Kremlin’s claims “absurd.”\n\nPutin on Saturday also claimed that a “window” had been prepared for the attackers to escape to Ukraine. He did not provide evidence.\n\nThe post has been updated with more details from Putin’s remarks.\n\nThe US State Department said Monday that the United States had warned Russia in early March about a planned terrorist attack in Moscow “potentially targeting large gatherings, including concerts.”\n\nSpokesperson Matthew Miller was responding to a denial by the Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov that Moscow received any warning.\n\nHe noted the United States on March 7 warned US citizens to avoid large gatherings in Moscow.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin had described the security warning as “provocative” and “outright blackmail” before the attack.\n\n“It was because of that warning that we passed on to the Russian government that we issued a security warning on March 7, where we again said to US citizens that we had information about a planned terrorist attack in Moscow… potentially targeting large gatherings including concerts,” Miller added.\n\nAll four suspects in the Crocus City concert hall attack case have been remanded into pre-trial detention until May 22. They are charged with committing a terrorist act, according to the courts of general jurisdiction of the city of Moscow, which under the Russian Criminal Code is punishable by up to life imprisonment.\n\nThree of the defendants pled guilty to all charges, according to state media news agency TASS.\n\nAll four are from Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic, and had been in Russia on either temporary or expired visas.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, authorities said they had identified an additional three people who they believed were involved in the attack — two brothers and a father.\n\nFriday’s attack killed at least 137 people. The attack is Russia’s deadliest in two decades.\n\nCatch up on the latest developments:\n\nDay of mourning: Russian President Vladimir Putin declared Sunday a day of national mourning for the 137 victims in Friday’s attack.\n\nAuthorities work to identify victims: Procedures to identify those killed in the attack have begun, the city’s Department of Health said, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The Russian Investigative Committee said 62 bodies had been identified so far, adding that “for the remaining victims, genetic examinations are being carried out to establish their identities.”\n\nFighting terrorism in Syria and Turkey: Putin held separate calls with his Turkish and Syrian counterparts, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Bashar al-Assad, on Saturday and promised closer cooperation in fighting terrorism following the attack, according to a Kremlin readout.\n\nRussian Embassy says no warnings from US: The Russian Embassy in Washington says it did not receive any warnings about a potential attack in Moscow from the US. Last week, Putin dismissed warnings by the US embassy in Russia that there could be attacks on large groups.\n\nPutin links attack to Ukraine: Putin said the main suspects arrested planned to flee into Ukraine. Ukraine has denied any connection. The UK warned that Russia was creating a “smokescreen of propaganda.”\n\nTerror alert: France has lifted its terror alert to its highest level following the deadly attack in Moscow, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said Sunday.\n\nVideo footage and still images have appeared on Russian social media that appear to show the violent interrogation of several of the men alleged to have taken part in the deadly terror attack on a concert hall outside Moscow Friday.\n\nOne video appears to show one of the suspects, Saidakrami Rachabalizoda, being held on the ground while having part of his ear cut off by a camouflage-wearing interrogator. Rachabalizoda later appeared in court with a heavily bandaged ear.\n\nThe Grey Zone, a pro-Kremlin Telegram channel, published a still photograph that claims to show the electrocution of one of the detained suspects.\n\nMargarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of Russian state propaganda network RT, posted a video that appears to show the interrogation of another suspect, Shamsidin Fariduni, who is shown stammering and shaking as he is questioned by interrogators off camera. Fariduni subsequently appeared in court with a bruised face.\n\nCNN asked the Kremlin about the “visible signs of violence” committed against the suspects, but spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment.\n\nThe Russian Investigative Committee says it has established that more people were involved in Friday’s Crocus City terror attack beyond the four men alleged to have carried out the attack.\n\nThe three individuals are two brothers and their father, Russian state media agency TASS said. Investigators are asking the Basmanny Court of Moscow to choose a preventive measure for the three defendants, the court told TASS.\n\n“Three more materials were received regarding the accused Islomov Aminchon Isroilovich, Islomov Dilovar Isroilovich, as well as the suspect Islomov IsroilIbragimovich,” the court said, according to TASS. Fariduni was one of those detained in Bryansk Saturday. Both Aminchon and Dilovar Islomov appeared in Basmanny court in Moscow Monday. State news agency TASS said that Dilovar Islomov is a citizen of the Russian Federation and works as a taxi driver, citing court documents.\n\nRussian state news agency RIA said Dilovar Islomov “owned the Renault car in which the terrorists fled the crime scene, sold it in February, and the compulsory motor liability insurance remained on him,” citing a source familiar with the situation.\n\nISIS, also known as the Islamic State group, claimed responsibility for Friday’s deadly assault on a concert venue in Moscow, releasing graphic footage purporting to show its gunmen carrying out what was Russia’s worst terror attack in decades.\n\nHere’s what we know about the group:\n\nWhen was it formed?: ISIS-K was formed in 2015 and has been active in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. It is a branch of ISIS, the terror group that emerged in Syria and Iraq and, at its peak, controlled a huge stretch of territory. Five years since the fall of ISIS’ self-proclaimed caliphate across Iraq and Syria, the group has morphed into a terror network with cells spread around the world, including in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.\n\nHow is it linked to ISIS? The connection between the groups is not entirely clear. The affiliates share an ideology and tactics, but the depth of their relationship – such as the chain of command and control – has never been fully established.\n\nWhat is its ideology?: Like its parent organization, ISIS-K aims to create a “pure Islamic state,” according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) – describing the group’s vision of a “global, transnational caliphate” governed by Sharia law.\n\nWhy attack Russia?: ISIS has a longstanding animosity against Russia and Putin, several experts told CNN. “Russia has been at the top or near the top of the list of ISIS for many years,” said Daniel Byman, director of Georgetown University’s security studies program.\n\nRead more about ISIS-K here.\n\nFour days after Friday’s Moscow terror attack, some 200 people gathered at the site of the attack Monday morning, offering condolences to the victims, a CNN team in Moscow reports.\n\nWhile the crowd was much smaller than the numbers who were at the Crocus City hall on Sunday, a steady flow of people were bringing flowers and stuffed toys to the scene, according to the CNN team. Candles were also laid next to the memorial.\n\nA Russian Red Cross tent is set up at the location to provide psychological help. The CNN team said volunteers are helping people with directions on where to pick up belongings or cars left on Friday. The main entrance of the Crocus hall remains barricaded off, with police buses and emergency vehicles clearing rubble. Search operations are still ongoing.\n\nThe victims: Moscow’s Department of Health published an updated list of those still hospitalized in the capital’s medical institutions after the attack, consisting of 76 names.\n\nAt least 137 people died in the attack after gunmen opened fire on people inside the hall, and set fire to the building. Of them, at least three were children. President Vladimir Putin declared Sunday a day of national mourning, vowing to punish the perpetrators and expressing condolences to those who had lost loved ones.\n\nFollowing the identification of the four men charged with carrying out the attack in Moscow on Friday as Tajik nationals, Tajikistan has reiterated its readiness to fight terrorism together with Russia.\n\nThe Russian state news agency TASS published video Monday showing Tajik Prime Minister Kokhir Rasulzoda writing a note in the book of condolences at the Russian embassy in Dushanbe.\n\nState-run RIA Novosti reported on its Telegram channel that Tajikistan is providing assistance to the Russian investigation “in the case of the terrorist attack in Crocus,” citing a source in Tajikistan’s special services. It reported that a source in the Russian Foreign Ministry had confirmed that “Tajikistan specialists are providing assistance to investigators from Russia in connection with the arrest of citizens of the republic in the case of a terrorist attack.”\n\nOn Sunday, the Kremlin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin had spoken with his Tajik counterpart Emomali Rahmon, who had expressed “deep condolences and feelings of solidarity with the Russian people in connection with the death of civilians as a result of the vile terrorist attack at Crocus City Hall.”\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday that it would be “cynical and counterproductive for Russia and her citizens” to try and blame Ukraine for the Crocus City terror attack in Moscow.\n\n“We must be careful of any instrumentalization” of the attack, Macron said in remarks to journalists upon his arrival in the French territory of French Guiana.\n\nMacron expressed his “solidarity” with the Russian people following the “Islamist terror attack” in Moscow, adding that France had offered its help to Moscow regarding intelligence about the attack.\n\nHe noted that ISIS, also known as the Islamic State group, had claimed the attack and that France and its main partners believed it was an Islamic State entity that planned and perpetrated this attack. However, he did not specify which ISIS entity France believes perpetrated it.\n\nMacron said that the same entity had attempted several attacks on French soil in recent months, which contributed to the French government’s decision to raise the country’s terror threat level on Sunday.\n\nRemember: After the attack, Putin said the “perpetrators” were headed to the Ukraine border before being captured. His comments came after ISIS had already claimed responsibility. Ukraine strenuously denied any involvement.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has sidestepped questions about whether Friday’s terror attack in Moscow constitutes a failure by Russia’s intelligence services.\n\nOn a call with journalists Monday, Peskov was asked whether the attack was “a failure of the intelligence services?”\n\nPeskov responded: “There is currently a lot of emotional, hysterical, provocative content online. Clearly, this monstrous tragedy evokes a lot of emotions, but unfortunately, our world shows that not a single city or country can be completely immune to the threat of terrorism.”\n\n“The intelligence services work tirelessly. They are dealing with all the threats, all the challenges that our country faces,” he said.\n\nPeskov also said the fight against terrorism required “full-fledged international cooperation” but suggested that cooperation was not happening. He refused to comment on whether any warnings had been received from the United States about the risk of terror attacks in Russia.\n\nCNN reported Friday that there had been a steady stream of intelligence that ISIS-Khorasan was determined to attack in Russia, according to two sources familiar with the intelligence.\n\nIn response to a question asking if there was any help provided from Western countries in view of the warnings, Peskov said: “Our [special] services operate independently. There is no talk of any help now,” later adding “there are currently no contacts with Westerners now.”\n\nCNN’s Alex Marquardt contributed to this report.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has declined to comment on reports that the four men alleged to have carried out the attack at Moscow’s Crocus City concert hall had been tortured after being apprehended.\n\nPeskov was asked by CNN:\n\nPeskov responded: “No, I leave this question unanswered.”\n\nHe also refused to comment on ISIS, also known as the Islamic State group’s claim that it carried out the attack.\n\nDuring a call with journalists Monday, Peskov was asked: “How can you explain the fact that ISIS was not mentioned by the officials among the versions of this terrorist attack?”\n\nRegarding the claim of responsibility, which was made via the ISIS-affiliated Amaq news agency on Saturday, Peskov said:\n\nNeither President Vladimir Putin nor other senior Russian officials have referred to the claim by ISIS, which included releasing a video of the attack taken by one of the perpetrators.\n\nThis post has been updated to include Peskov’s response to the ISIS claim.\n\nEach of the four defendants charged with committing a terrorist act in the Crocus City concert hall attack was brought to court individually in Moscow on Sunday.\n\nThey are accused of committing a crime under part 3, provision “b” of article 205 of the Russian Criminal Code (terrorist act), which the Russian Criminal Code states is punishable with up to life imprisonment.\n\nThree pled guilty to all charges, according to state media news agency TASS.\n\nHere’s what we know about the accused:\n\nDalerdzhon Mirzoyev: The 32-year-old was the first defendant brought to court. Mirzoyev, from Tajikistan, had a temporary registration for three months in the southern Russian city of Novosibirsk in Siberia, but it expired, according to RIA Novosti.\n\nSaidakrami Rachabalizoda: He appeared as the second defendant, and told the the court that he had Russian registration documents but couldn’t remember where they were. He communicated through an interpreter, according to state media RIA Novosti. Rachabalizoda was reportedly born in 1994.\n\nShamsidin Fariduni: He was born in 1998 in Tajikistan and is a citizen of the Central Asian country. Fariduni was officially employed at a factory in the Russian city of Podolsk and was registered in the city of Krasnogorsk, according to state media RIA Novosti.\n\nMuhammadsober Faizov: The fourth defendant appeared nonresponsive in a wheelchair and was accompanied by a doctor to his court appearance, as seen in Moscow City Court’s video shared on Telegram. Faizov was temporarily unemployed, before which he worked in a barber shop in Ivanovo, a city northeast of Moscow, and is registered in that city, according to state media RIA Novosti. He was reportedly born in 2004.\n\nThe Basmanny District Court of Moscow on Sunday granted the investigators’ motion for detention, as the chosen preventative measure, for all four defendants in the Crocus City Hall attack case.\n\nAll four men have been remanded into pre-trial detention until May 22, Moscow City Court said on Telegram. They are all charged with committing a terrorist act, according to the courts of general jurisdiction of the city of Moscow, which under the Russian Criminal Code is punishable up to life imprisonment.\n\nEach of the four defendants was brought to court individually on Sunday. Three pled guilty to all charges, according to state media news agency TASS.\n\nThe names of the four accused in the case are Dalerdzhon Mirzoyev, Saidakrami Rachabalizoda, Shamsidin Fariduni and Mukhammadsobir Faizov, Moscow City Courts announced via Telegram.\n\nAll four are from Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic, and have been in Russia on either temporary or expired visas. The court held closed hearings for each of the accused with no members of the public allowed, TASS reported, citing the court’s press service.\n\nFrance lifted its terror alert to its highest level on Sunday, after ISIS claimed responsibility for the concert hall attack in Moscow that killed at least 137 people on Friday.\n\nFrance’s decision to raise the alert came after a meeting of its defense and national security council, according to Attal.\n\nOn Monday, Attal said two attempted terror attacks on French soil had been foiled since January and 45 in total since 2017. He said thousands more soldiers were ready to boost its counter-terrorism force, should they be needed.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Paris, Attal said that 4,000 soldiers were on standby to mobilize if necessary “in the event of an alert,” in addition to the current 3,000 soldiers deployed across the country. Police presence in front of sites deemed sensitive such as schools would also be reinforced,” he added.\n\nCNN’s Chris Liakos and Emmanuel Nicholas Miculita in Paris contributed to this report.\n\nBarely a week since Vladimir Putin secured his fifth presidential term, Russia has been plunged into carnage and disarray.\n\nThe attack on the Crocus City Hall concert venue and shopping complex near Moscow, which has been claimed by ISIS, has left hundreds of people killed or injured.\n\nThis is hardly the stability and security for which so many Russians voted for President Putin. For years, the Kremlin strongman has been cast as a leader able to guarantee order in this vast, turbulent country. But Russia today seems more insecure and volatile than at any point in Putin’s 24 years in power.\n\nThe Kremlin’s brutal war in Ukraine, now in its third horrific year, has cost Russians dearly. The military doesn’t publicize casualty figures, but US estimates suggest more than 300,000 Russians have been killed or injured.\n\nThe recent death of Alexey Navalny, Russian most prominent opposition leader, has permanently silenced a vocal Kremlin critic. But the thousands who attended his funeral in Moscow, or who turned out to vote in a Midday Against Putin mass gathering at polling stations on the last day of the presidential election, indicate a base of discontent.\n\nNow, the focus is firmly on the apparent reappearance in Russia of large-scale Jihadi terror attacks, unrelated to the Ukraine war or domestic opposition to the Kremlin. For a leader who has promised security and stability to Russians, a major attack on Russian soil is yet another powerful blow.\n\nRead the full analysis.\n\nThe attack on Moscow’s popular Crocus City Hall that left at least 133 dead has become the deadliest attack in Russia since the Beslan school siege in 2004.\n\nSome other recent attacks include:\n\nSeptember 26, 2022: Eleven children and four adults were killed when a gunman wearing Nazi symbols opened fire at a school in the western Russian city of Izhevsk. The shooter, who was reportedly wearing a black T-shirt with Nazi insignia and a helmet, died by suicide following the attack.\n\nApril 3, 2017: At least 11 people were killed in a blast on the St. Petersburg metro. The explosion tore through a train as it was traveling between two stations in Russia’s second-largest city.\n\nOctober 31, 2015: A Russian passenger jet, Metrojet Flight 9268 crashed on October 31 after departing from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, killing all 224 people on board. US intelligence analysis suggested that ISIS or its affiliates planted a bomb on the plane.\n\nDecember 30, 2013: A massive explosion at a train station in the Russian city of Volgograd killed at least 16 people, including one police officer, the Investigative Committee of Russia said.\n\nJanuary 25, 2011: A suicide bomber attacked Domodedovo Airport, Moscow’s busiest airport, killing 35 people and wounding about 100, authorities and state television said.\n\nMarch 29, 2010: Two explosions rocked the subway stations in central Moscow during rush hour, killing at least 38 people and wounding more than 60 others, spawning widespread public outrage. A website associated with Chechen separatists, who have long fought for independence from Russia, claimed responsibility for the attacks."
