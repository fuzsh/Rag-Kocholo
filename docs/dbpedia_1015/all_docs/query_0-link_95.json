Putin, who made the comments at a news conference during a state visit to China, said Russia’s recent thrust into the Kharkiv region was a response to Ukrainian shelling of Russian border regions such as Belgorod, Reuters reported.\n\nRussian guided bombs killed at least two people and injured 13 others in the northeastern Ukraine‘s city of Kharkiv on Friday, local officials said. It was not immediately clear what they had been targeting but the regional governor said those injured were civilians, Reuters reported.\n\nA massive Ukrainian drone attack on Crimea early on Friday caused power cutoffs in the city of Sevastopol and set a refinery ablaze in southern Russia, Russian authorities said. The drone raids marked Kyiv’s attempt to strike back during Moscow’s offensive in northeastern Ukraine, which has added to the pressure on outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian forces who are waiting for delayed deliveries of crucial weapons and ammunition from Western partners.\n\nA drone attack on Russia’s Black Sea port of Novorossiisk early on Friday hit the Importpischeprom oil products terminal and Sheskharis oil harbour, sources said and video shared on social media showed. The port was shut soon after attack but later resumed oil loadings from Sheskharis oil harbour and fuel oil terminal, according to industry sources and LSEG data, Reuters reported.\n\nRussian forces have advanced 10 km into Ukraine’s Kharkiv region in one area but the situation has “stabilised” as of Friday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said as cited by RBC-Ukraine media outlet. “Today, our defence forces have stabilised the Russians where they are now. The deepest point of their advance is 10 km,” Zelenskiy told journalists.\n\nRussia’s foreign ministry warned the west that it was playing by fire by allowing Ukraine to use Western missiles and weapons to strike Russia and that Moscow would not leave such action unanswered, Reuters reported. The foreign ministry said in a statement that it saw the hand of the United States and Britain behind a recent spate of attacks and blamed Washington and London for escalating the conflict by authorising Ukraine to use long-range rockets and heavy weapons they had supplied against Russian targets.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry said on Friday that its “North” military grouping had taken control of 12 settlements in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region in the last week. President Vladimir Putin said earlier on Friday that Russian forces advancing in Kharkiv region were creating a “buffer zone” to protect Russian border regions, but said capturing the city of Kharkiv itself was not part of Russia’s current plan.\n\nRussia’s ambassador to Britain has described the UK government as a de facto participant in the Ukraine war because of the weapons it was supplying to Kyiv – and said it was also sharing real-time intelligence too. Andrei Kelin, Russia’s ambassador to Britain, made the comments to Russia’s Rossiya-24 state TV channel, Reuters has reported.\n\nUkrainian forces shot down all 20 drones Russia dispatched in an overnight attack, the Ukrainian military said on Friday. The drones were shotdown over the regions of Kharkiv, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Odesa and Mykolaiv, Reuters reported. Russian forces have increasingly targeted Kharkiv region this spring, intensifying the aerial attacks and mounting a new offensive in the border areas forcing Kyiv’s outnumbered troops to try to hold the line on a new front.\n\nRussian forces expanded the area of active combat by almost 70 km by launching their offensive in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine’s army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Friday. Syrskyi said Russia launched the offensive to force Ukraine to throw additional reserve brigades into fighting. He added that he expected fighting to intensify as Kyiv troops are also preparing to defend in northern region of Sumy.\n\nThe Ukrainian artillery on the Kharkiv frontline is facing a bigger threat than ever from Russia’s fleet of Lancet kamikaze drones, according to a howitzer crew fighting there. “One comes, then a second one comes, 10 minutes later a third one comes,” said call sign Artist, the fresh-faced 21-year-old commander of an artillery battery of the 42nd Brigade which has been firing non-stop to repel Russia’s new offensive in the region over the past week. The soldiers requested that they only be referred to by their military call signs to protect their identities, Reuters reported.\n\nA long-range Ukrainian strike on the Moscow-controlled Belbek airbase in occupied Crimea destroyed three Russian warplanes and a fuel facility near its main runway this week, US commercial satellite company Maxar said. The company cited satellite imagery taken on Thursday as showing that two MiG-31 fighter jets and an Su-27 fighter jet had been destroyed. It said one MiG-29 fighter aircraft also appeared to have been damaged.\n\nA plan for Ukraine to be given an invitation to join Nato by the summer of 2028 will be rejected when the alliance meets for its annual summit in Washington this summer, one of the key promoters of the idea admitted on Thursday. Kurt Volker, a former US Ambassador to Nato, warned the US and Germany will veto the plan, sending a signal to Vladimir Putin to keep going, adding: “it means the war is likely to last at least another year.”\n\nUkraine needs more long-range weapons to fight off Russian advances in the northern Kharkiv region where the situation around the country’s second-largest city remains “highly dramatic”, Germany’s foreign minister said on Friday. Russian forces have made inroads of at least several kilometres in the region in recent days, forcing Kyiv’s out-manned troops to try to hold the line on a new front as Moscow mounts more pressure on the front in the east.\n\nPutin queried the political legitimacy of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday when asked about the absence of plans to hold a presidential election in Ukraine at the moment, Reuters reported. Martial law imposed after Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022 means Zelenskiy will not face an election when his term technically expires later this month, something he and Ukraine’s allies deem to be the right decision to take at a time of war.\n\nVladimir Putin is seeking to weaponise the threat of mass migration to divide and weaken Europe as supporters of Ukraine struggle to maintain unity to defeat Russia, Kaja Kallas, the Estonian prime minister said on Friday. “What our adversaries know is migration is our vulnerability,” she said. “The aim is to make life really impossible in Ukraine so that there would be migration pressure to Europe, and this is what they are doing.”\n\nRussia with respond in kind to any ambiguous nuclear behaviour from the West, Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, was reported as saying by the TASS news agency. According to Ryabkov, the West has adopted a stance of strategic uncertainty and ambiguity towards Russia, trying to make it difficult for Moscow to predict how Nato will react in various situations, including with nuclear weapons.\n\nThat’s all from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today.

Our adversaries are weaponising migration.\n\n“They push the migrants over the border, and they create problems for the Europeans because they weaponise this since with human rights, you have to accept those people. And that is, of course, water to the mill of the far right.”\n\nShare\n\nRussia’s foreign ministry warned the west that it was playing by fire by allowing Ukraine to use Western missiles and weapons to strike Russia and that Moscow would not leave such action unanswered, Reuters reported.\n\nThe foreign ministry said in a statement that it saw the hand of the United States and Britain behind a recent spate of attacks and blamed Washington and London for escalating the conflict by authorising Ukraine to use long-range rockets and heavy weapons they had supplied against Russian targets.\n\n“Once again, we should like to unequivocally warn Washington, London, Brussels and other Western capitals, as well as Kyiv, which is under their control, that they are playing with fire. Russia will not leave such encroachments on its territory unanswered,” the statement said.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 16.46 CEST\n\nA drone attack on Russia’s Black Sea port of Novorossiisk early on Friday hit the Importpischeprom oil products terminal and Sheskharis oil harbour, sources said and video shared on social media showed.\n\nThe port was shut soon after attack but later resumed oil loadings from Sheskharis oil harbour and fuel oil terminal, according to industry sources and LSEG data, Reuters reported.\n\nOil products loadings from Importpischeprom oil products terminal in Novorossiisk are still suspended, the sources said.\n\nRussian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft did not reply to a request for comment. Its subsidiary, Novorossiisk Commercial Sea Port Group (NCSP), which operates the Sheskharis oil terminal, declined to comment.\n\nShare\n\nRussian guided bombs kill two, injure 13 others in Kharkiv\n\nRussian guided bombs killed at least two people and injured 13 others in the northeastern Ukraine‘s city of Kharkiv on Friday, local officials said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what they had been targeting but the regional governor said those injured were civilians, Reuters reported.\n\n“Among the 13 wounded, four are in a serious condition,” governor Oleh Syniehubov said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine‘s second largest city, and the surrounding region have long been targeted by Russian attacks but the strikes have become more intense in recent months, hitting civilian and energy infrastructure.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 16.00 CEST\n\nRussian diplomat accuses US of ‘playing with fire’ over Ukraine\n\nA top Russian diplomat said on Friday the United States had long since entered into a state of indirect war with Moscow and was playing with fire over Ukraine by behaving in such a way that the situation could spin out of control, Reuters reported.\n\nThe comments by deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with state TASS news agency reflect growing Russian concern over what Moscow casts as dangerous Western escalation in Ukraine as Russian forces advance in several places.\n\n“We warn that they are playing with fire. They have long been in a state of indirect war with the Russian Federation,” Ryabkov told TASS, referring to the United States.\n\n“They somehow fail to realise that, in order to satisfy their own geopolitical ideas, they are approaching a phase in which it will be very difficult to control what is happening and to prevent a dramatic crisis.”\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 15.31 CEST\n\nAmy Hawkins\n\nIn case you missed it yesterday, Russia and China announced they will deepen their already close military ties, as Vladimir Putin met Xi Jinping in Beijing on his first foreign trip since being inaugurated for a new term as Russia’s president.\n\nIt is the latest in a string of statements and signals that the warm relationship between the two countries is as strong as it has ever been.\n\nXi’s red carpet welcome for Putin – a man he has described as his “best friend” – comes after a whistle-stop tour in Europe where the Chinese president faced tough questions on his country’s economic and political behaviour. On Tuesday, the Biden administration announced tariffs on $18bn (£14bn) of Chinese goods, angering Beijing.\n\nIn a press conference shortly after their meeting on Thursday, and before the two leaders sat down for a celebratory concert to mark the 75th anniversary of formal China-Russia relations, Putin praised the “warm and comradely” talks with Xi. In return, Xi said the friendship between China and Russia was “everlasting” and had “become a model for a new type of international relations”.\n\nShare\n\nRussia’s defence ministry said on Friday that its “North” military grouping had taken control of 12 settlements in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region in the last week.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said earlier on Friday that Russian forces advancing in Kharkiv region were creating a “buffer zone” to protect Russian border regions, but said capturing the city of Kharkiv itself was not part of Russia’s current plan.\n\nShare\n\nMeanwhile, in Ukraine itself it’s emerged president Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed a law allowing some convicts to serve in the army.\n\nA separate law increasing fines for those not opting to join the war effort was also signed, an entry on the Ukrainian parliament’s website showed, according to Reuters.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 14.06 CEST\n\nUK is a de facto participant in Ukraine war, claims Russian ambassador\n\nRussia’s ambassador to Britain has described the UK government as a de facto participant in the Ukraine war because of the weapons it was supplying to Kyiv – and said it was also sharing real-time intelligence too.\n\nAndrei Kelin, Russia’s ambassador to Britain, made the comments to Russia’s Rossiya-24 state TV channel, Reuters has reported.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 13.36 CEST\n\nAfternoon summary\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Russian forces advancing in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region were creating a “buffer zone” to protect Russian border regions, but said capturing the city of Kharkiv was not part of Russia’s current plan.
