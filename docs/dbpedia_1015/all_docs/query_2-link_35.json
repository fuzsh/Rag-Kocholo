The program, at the heart of several controversies, is ending after 12 seasons. The same is true for its spin-off show, “Les vacances des Anges”. This cessation of the show, which accompanied the development of influencers in France, would be due to the very disappointing audiences of the last seasons of the program. But also to the recent controversies surrounding the show. Accusations of harassment and sexism were made against the production by former participants . A violent fight also broke out during the last filming in Reunion. Since its creation, The Angels of Reality TV has inspired other TNT channels, which are multiplying shows of the genre. To replace this program, NRJ12 is banking, according to Le Parisien , on a new reality TV program. It should follow the adventures of an influencer agency. Its working title is “Followers”.

(Formerly known as Есть Только Папа) 148,000 January 8, 2024 The Krasnodar Region police will check a blogger from Anapa, the owner of the channel \"There is only dad\". This was reported on January 10 by the regional department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Subscribers suspect the father of an unhealthy love for his 12-year-old daughter. Videos from the channel \"There is only dad\" are going viral on YouTube. Subscribers admit that these videos make their blood run cold. On the one hand, the footage shows the tender relationship between a father and a teenage daughter, on the other hand, it seems to Internet users that the man treats his child like an adult woman, and does not give her any choice - he dictates what to listen to, read, takes her to a beauty salon and chooses clothes himself. The blogger's content raised questions among thousands of Internet users, and then among the head of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina. Most viewers are inclined to believe that the videos in the “There is only dad” channels were filmed for hype and monetization. The story turned out to be so viral that investigations about who Lisa is to the blogger appeared on social networks, and parodies of only_dad and “princess” appeared on TikTok. After numerous requests, the Anapa police will conduct an investigation into the blogger “There is only dad,” the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Krasnodar Territory reported .[50] WeedLion Animations 147,000 March 27, 2022 In 2013, WeedLion joined Team Crafted as an animator.
