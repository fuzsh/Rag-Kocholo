        "text": "Additional Resources\n\nLearn about the early years of RFE and RL in Arch Puddington’s “Broadcasting Freedom: The Cold War Triumph of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty,” A. Ross Johnson’s “Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty: The CIA Years and Beyond,” Allan Michie’s “Voices Through the Iron Curtain: The Radio Free Europe Story,” and Sig Mickelson’s “America’s Other Voice: The Story of Radio Free Europe & Radio Liberty.“\n\nThe Crusade for Freedom – the Free Europe Committee’s project to raise Americans’ awareness of, and funds for, Radio Free Europe – is examined in Richard Cummings’ “Radio Free Europe’s “Crusade for Freedom”: Rallying Americans Behind Cold War Broadcasting, 1950-1960.”\n\nThe Crusade for Freedom and its successor, the Radio Free Europe Fund, as well as the Radio Liberty Committee, produced several films and public service announcements during the 1950s and 1960s that promoted the work of RFE and RL, including “This is Radio Free Europe,” “This is Radio Liberty,” “Window to the West,” and “The Most Incredible Challenge”.\n\nMark Pomar provides a look at RFE/RL and Voice of America broadcasting efforts to Russia during the 1980s and early 1990s in “Cold War Radio: The Russian Broadcasts of the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.”\n\nThe efforts by Poland’s Communist government to counter the impact of RFE’s influential Polish Service broadcasts are examined in Pawel Machcewicz’s “Poland’s War on Radio Free Europe. 1950-1989”\n\nSeveral RFE/RL veterans have written personal accounts of their service with the Radios, including George Urban (“Radio Free Europe & the Pursuit of Democracy: My War within the Cold War”), Gene Sosin (“Sparks of Liberty: An Insider’s Memoir of Radio Liberty”), James Critchlow (“Radio Liberty: Hole-in-the-Head”), and J.F. Brown (“Radio Free Europe: An Insider’s View”).\n\nLearn more about the impact of RFE and RL broadcasts on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in A. Ross Johnson and R. Eugene Parta’s “Cold War Broadcasting: Impact on the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.”\n\nGene Parta takes a close look at the Radio Liberty research effort he helped build in “Under The Radar: Tracking Western Radio Listeners in the Soviet Union,” and drills into the data in “Discovering the Hidden Listener: An Empirical Assessment of Radio Liberty and Western Broadcasting to the USSR during the Cold War.”\n\nRFE and RL reporters faced many dangers on the journalistic front lines of the Cold War – from attempted poisonings, to esoteric murder plots and the bombing of RFE/RL headquarters Munich in 1981 – as described in Richard Cummings’ “Cold War Radio: The Dangerous History Of American Broadcasting In Europe, 1950-1989”\n\nFor an in-depth look at jamming and the extensive efforts by the U.S.S.R. to disrupt RFE/RL radio broadcasts, watch “Empire of Noise,” a video documentary by Rimantas Pleikys."
