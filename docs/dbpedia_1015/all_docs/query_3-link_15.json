        "text": "Residents of Russia’s Kursk region bordering Ukraine are appealing to authorities for help with evacuating and accusing them of taking insufficient action as an apparent attack by Kyiv’s forces continued for a second day.\n\nWhile armed militants from Ukraine have conducted multiple incursions into Russia’s border regions since last year in retaliation to Moscow’s full-scale invasion against Kyiv, the latest attack appears larger in scale and more prepared than previous efforts.\n\nLocal officials reported at least five people killed and 24 injured in the Kursk region attack, which Russia said was carried out by some 300 Ukrainian troops, 11 tanks and over 20 armored vehicles.\n\nThe regional governor said Wednesday that the situation was \"under control,\" adding that President Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the attack and was \"personally monitoring\" the events.\n\n“Over the past 24 hours, our region has been heroically resisting attacks by Ukrainian Nazis. All emergency services have been put on high alert,” Kursk Governor Alexei Smirnov said Wednesday, repeating the Kremlin’s unbacked claim that Kyiv’s government is controlled by neo-Nazis.\n\nSmirnov said Wednesday that authorities had helped “several thousand people” to evacuate.\n\nHowever, a Moscow Times reporter saw residents of border areas in the Kursk region accusing officials of not doing enough to help them on social media.\n\n“Nobody cared about us... the refugees from that ‘country’ [Ukraine] were given everything at once... and [local] people left for nowhere and with nothing,” wrote Lika Ivanova from Sudzha, a town in the Kursk region that came under massive shelling on Tuesday.\n\n“Why did our state allow this? If you can't protect your people, do an evacuation. As a result, there are victims again,” Kursk resident Andrei Nezlobin posted on the VKontakte social media platform.\n\nFootage published on social media on Tuesday showed what appeared to be Russian warplanes flying over the Kursk region at low altitudes to repel the attack.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said Wednesday that the Ukrainian side suffered losses of 260 soldiers and 50 armored vehicles — a claim that could not be independently verified. Russia’s air defense system also shot down two Ukrainian missiles.\n\nRussian pro-war bloggers reported Wednesday that at least 11 villages were captured and “regular enemy troops are present up to 15 kilometers deep…and 10-11 kilometers wide.\"\n\nThe Defense Ministry has not confirmed these reports, only saying Wednesday that \"the operation” against Ukrainian forces in Kursk was “ongoing.\"\n\nUkrainian forces reportedly captured the Sudzha gas metering station, which is used as a gas transit to Europe through Ukraine, the pro-war Telegram channel Rybar reported Wednesday.\n\nThe situation in Sudzha is “very tense,” the city’s mayor told the state-run RIA Novosti news agency.\n\nAccording to pro-war military bloggers, the attack was first repelled by units staffed with conscripts serving their mandatory military service.\n\nRussian media reported that Kyiv’s forces captured at least six Russian soldiers, including two conscripts.\n\nUkraine has not claimed responsibility for the incursion, the most serious in months.\n\nUkrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak alluded to the attacks on social media without specifically mentioning them, saying Moscow had used its “border regions with impunity for massive air and artillery attacks.”\n\nAFP contributed reporting."
