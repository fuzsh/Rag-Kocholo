        "text": "DRAFT: WORK IN PROGRESS for Volume 2 Athenian Year Primer. IG I3 369 (a.k.a. The Logistai Inscription) remains paramount for any study on the 5th Century Athenian Calendars , specifically the independent Conciliar (Boulitic) Calendar. It often took center stage during the Meritt-Pritchett debates. IG I3 369 records loans to the polis from the Sacred Treasuries of Athene Polias, Athene Nike, and the Other Gods for the quadrennium 426/5 - 423/2 BCE. The Chap follows the astronomical schemas provided AYP and builds upon Mabel Lang's methodology to calculate interest accurately via an Ancient Greek Counting Board (a.k.a. abacus). I challenge some prevailing opinions and seek to debunk the hypothesis that the Conciliar Year ever consisted of consecutive 366 days. I propose a number of alternative restorations. **NOTE**: for specialists thus very very dense so not for the timid. Please do not cite without permission (not that you want to do so). Update divides Chap into sections for clarity, adds YR IV Summary. Also, re-edited, typos removed, etc.\n\nThe author argues the evidence presented by Platon concerning Sokrates' time during the Siege and Battles of Poteidaia, presented in both the Symposium and Charmides, does not conflict and that the Charmides indeed has a precise and accurate \"dramatic date\" (the last days of May, 429 BCE).\n\nThe author argues that the accurate description of the Βενδίδεια's first celebration provided by Platon in the Republic's opening, when compared (and added) to the epigraphic evidence supplied by IG I3 136 and IG II2 1283 shows Athenians imported both Bendis' cults and her festival during the time of the Great Plague and that the inauguration took place the earliest days of June, 429 BCE."
