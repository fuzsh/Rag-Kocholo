        "text": "a thasian type tetradrachm with the legend ΘΡΑΚΩΝ overstruck on an athenian stephane-phoros tetradrachm of ΑΠΕΛΛΙΚΩΝ−ΓΟΡΓΙΑΣ (88/87 BC) has been recently sold and illustrated. We already had several athenian overstuck tetradrachms but no one of such a late date. the new overstrike lowers the chronology by at least 20 years (not ca. 110 BC but after 88 BC). It is most likely now that the ΘΡΑΚΩΝ tetradrachms postdates the First Mithridatic War, with which it has thus no connection. as a consequence, the Prokopov Groups XII to XX were not struck between c.120/115 BC and c. 80/75, but more likely not before the 80s, leaving only Groups IX–XI for the three decades before the War (ca. 115 BC to 86 BC), despite the historical evidence we do have of campaigns undertaken during this period by Roman military forces against thracian tribes. a die-study is provided for the 12 specimens with the letters ΘΡΑΚΩΝ. One also gives the reasons why it should be better not to read the name aesillas, resolving a monogram which appears on some thasian type tetradrachms.\n\nBird bones are rare finds in Bronze Age excavations in Greece, though, the presence of bird representations in art of the same period is remarkable. This paper examines this paradox from a zooarchaeological perspective. It records and presents the osteological evidence for bird exploitation by Bronze Age communities in Greece and examines the characteristics of the bird bone assemblages, emphasizing the need for nuance and methodological rigor in interpreting these data. This evidence is then viewed against the contemporary birds' representations record from the same area. From such a comparative approach, a number of similarities and differences emerge regarding the intensity of human-bird interactions, the preferred bird types or the significance of particular types of birds across the study area. Further study of these discrepancies may offer a better understanding of the role of birds in Bronze Age Aegean."
