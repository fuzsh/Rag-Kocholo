        "text": "This paper, written in the second year of my Honours’ degree, takes a brief look at the Athenian politician and general, Alcibiades. The paper does not offer a detailed account of Alcibiades’ career. Rather, it examines key events in his life from the perspective of what the fluctuations of his career can tell us about the vulnerabilities of Athenian politics to manipulation during the Peloponnesian War. Because this was one of my early assignments, the original paper did take it for granted that the person marking the paper was well acquainted with the historical background to the discussion. This was quite acceptable for the time, but for a broader audience I have added some background notes to put the discussion in context.\n\nThis paper explores Athens’s role during the satrapal revolts of the 360s BC, through the study of several Attic inscriptions dating to the same period. The examination of these texts shows that there was a consistent and complex Athenian foreign policy towards the rebelling rulers and satraps. Athens granted honorary awards to many of the rebellious rulers to negotiate and establish alliances with them but stopped short of officially supporting the revolts. In this way, it maintained the terms of the King’s Peace while also cultivating diplomatic relations with the rebels.\n\nThe paper argues that Cleisthenes’ military reforms were not improvised. The general view of war in Archaic Athens as a series of skirmishes between small contingents recruited on an almost private basis must be qualified, as there are indications to suggest a greater and more regulated involvement of the polis of Athens in the organisation of collective war. This was not entirely effective since it depended on “private” channels, the aristoi from different districts, who fought each other (stasis). Despite this, they were “institutionalised” as part of the common political and institutional framework. The sources seems to indicate that the existence of “Hoplites” in Peisistratid Athens was more widespread than is usually believed.\n\nThis article examines the early Hellenistic honorific decree for the Athenian general Aristeides of Lamptrai (I.Rhamnous 404). After discussing the decree’s date and the external evidence about the honorand, the article provides a detailed analysis of Aristeides’ meritorious deeds in the order in which they are recounted in the motivation clause of the decree. In particular, the article considers the ways in which this decree advances our understanding of the Athenian revolt against Demetrios Poliorketes in 287, of Athenian relations with the Antigonids in the late 280s and early 270s, and of the early phases of the Chremonidean War.\n\nThis paper re-assesses the ongoing debate on the nature of the Second Athenian League, which oscillates between two extremes: either it was an empire from the beginning or it never was. Today the majority view is probably that the League was eventually transformed into a new Athenian Empire, even if the date, the details and the reasons behind such a transformation continue to be vigorously disputed. This reassessment is based on a re-examination of the evidence for the nature of the Aristoteles decree and the status of Athenian allies from 378 to 338, for Athens’s collection of allied suntaxeis (‘contributions’) and for its establishment of cleruchies, governors and garrisons. The paper also considers the reasons for, and the consequences of, the Social War as well as the evolution of Athenian foreign policy in connection with Philip II. The paper argues that the Second Athenian League developed as Athens’s tool not only to contest Sparta’s and then Thebes’s claims to dominance in the Greek world, but also to suppress regional hegemonies. Athens’s inability to quell local centres of power and to resist the rising threat of Macedonia made her acquiesce to cooperating with the Theban Federation and other regional hegemonies in the late 340s and early 330s, thus largely undoing the League’s original purpose even before its ultimate disintegration."
