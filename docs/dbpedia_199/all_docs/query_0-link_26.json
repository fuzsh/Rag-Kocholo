        "text": "In 197 BC, proudly holding Chalcis along with Corinth and Demetrias, the Macedonian King Philip V claimed to be controlling the “fetters” of Greece. Indeed, the site of Chalcis, located at the narrowest point of the strait of the Euripos separating the island of Euboia from the continent, allowed the control not only of the Euboic Gulf and its maritime routes, but also of Central Greece as a whole, and by extension, of the Greek peninsula. This paper investigates the strategic, political and military factors needed in the early Hellenistic period for the transformation of the Euboian commercial port into one of the most significant strongholds in Greece. It will be argued that to achieve this, it was first necessary to destroy Boiotian Thebes, the strongest local power in the 4th century BC, and to disperse its territory. Also, foreign interest in tightly controlling the region was needed. The Macedonian dynasts were the first of course, and it will be argued that, after Alexander the Great, it was probably Demetrios Poliorcetes who first conceived the concept of the three “fetters” of Greece, and who developed a significant element to the system of fortifications of Chalcis: the so-called Aniphoritis Wall, or at least the associated kastro. A survey of the use of the site in international affairs down to the Mithridatic Wars is also offered, followed by an analysis of the impact such a disputed site had at a more local level, in particular on the territory of Oropos.\n\nIn book 4, Erodot (lat. Herodotus) distinguishes between three different warring parties in the Peloponnesian War of the V century BCE: the Peloponnesian city-states (Athens, Thebes, Sparta, etc.), the Gaul/Illyrian barbarians and the Macedonians, whom he judges at least in one passage to be neither part of the city-states world nor barbarians. On the grounds of these ancient testimonies the new scholarly emphasis on Macedonia developed. Supported in part from the many linguistic and genealogical researches, and in part from the new archaeological finds that are revealed almost on a daily basis. Much of our new appreciation of ancient Macedonic culture and society came from the numerous recently excavated tombs of prominent Macedonians dating from the remote ancient times, but also from the modern DNA-genealogical and linguistic researches that also made a remarkable progress. These latest studies together with the fieldwork helped notably to our understanding of the ancient Macedonic populations in Paionia. They recount the prehistoric relations between ancient communities and track down their chronological and spacial coordinates with its sketchy borders."
