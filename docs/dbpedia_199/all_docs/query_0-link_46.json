        "text": "Aenea (city) Topic\n\n0 0\n\nrank #1 ·\n\nAenea (Ancient Greek: Αἴνεια, Aineia) was an ancient Greek city in northwesternmost Chalcidice, said to have been founded by Aeneas, and was situated, according to Livy, opposite Pydna, and 15 miles from Thessalonica. It appears to have stood on the promontory of Megalo Embolo, which forms the northwest corner of the peninsula of Chalcidice, and which, being about 10 geographical miles in direct distance from Thessalonica, may be identified with the promontory Aeneium of Pseudo-Scymnus. Aeneia must therefore have been further north than Pydna. It was colonised by the Corinthians. It is mentioned by Herodotus, and continued to be a place of importance down to the time of the Roman wars in Greece, although we are told that a great part of its population was removed to Thessalonica, when the latter city was founded by Cassander. The city minted coins in antiquity, some of which survive today.\n\nDoberus Topic\n\n0 0\n\nrank #2 ·\n\nDoberus or Doberos (Ancient Greek: Δόβηρος) was a town of Paeonia, which Sitalces reached after crossing Mount Cercine, and where many troops and additional volunteers reached him, making up his full total. Hierocles calls the town Diaborus or Diaboros (Διάβορος) and names it next to Idomenae among the towns of Macedonia Prima under the Byzantine Empire; this, coupled with the statement of Ptolemy that it belonged to the Aestraei, would seem to show that Doberus was near the modern Dojran.\n\nAegae (Macedonia) Ancient Macedonian capital\n\n0 0\n\nrank #3 ·\n\nAegae or Aigai (Ancient Greek: Αἰγαὶ), also Aegeae or Aigeai (Αἰγέαι), was a city in Emathia in ancient Macedonia, and the burial-place of the Macedonian kings. The commanding and picturesque site upon which the town was built was the original centre of the Macedonians, and the residence of the dynasty which sprang from the Temenid Perdiccas. The seat of government was afterwards transferred to the marshes of Pella, which lay in the maritime plain beneath the ridge through which the Lydias forces its way to the sea. But the old capital always remained the national hearth (ἑστία, Diod. Excerpt. p. 563) of the Macedonian race, and the burial-place for their kings. The body of Alexander the Great, though by the intrigues of Ptolemy I Soter, it was taken to Memphis, was to have reposed at Aegae, – the spot where his father Philip II of Macedon fell by the hand of Pausanias of Orestis.\n\nSane (Acte) Ancient Greek city in Chalcidice\n\n0 0\n\nrank #4 ·\n\nSane (Greek: Σάνη) was an ancient Greek city in the Acte headland (Mount Athos) of Chalcidice, situated upon the low, undulating ground, forming the isthmus which connects the peninsula of Acte with Chalcidice. It was founded by Andrians in the 7th century BCE. The ruins of the ancient city were found in the 21st century. Sane in Acte (or Athos) is mentioned by Herodotus in reference to the march of Xerxes I in Thrace, during the Second Persian invasion of Greece.\n\nSpartolos Ancient Greek city\n\n0 0\n\nrank #5 ·\n\nSpartolus or Spartolos (Ancient Greek: Σπάρτωλος) was the chief city of the Bottiaeans, perhaps in Bottike, in the northwest of the ancient Chalcidice, at no great distance from Olynthus. It was a member of the Delian League under the Thracian phoros, paying 2 or 3.5 talents, until the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, when the Bottiaean and the Chalkidian League revolted against Athens in 429 BCE. The ensuing Battle of Spartolos, fought under the walls of Spartolos, saw the rout of the Athenian forces by the Chalcideans. It was of sufficient importance to be mentioned in the treaty establishing the Peace of Nicias between Athens and Sparta in the tenth year of the Peloponnesian War, in 421 BCE, leaving the town neutral. It seems however that sometime later it became again an Athenian allied member. It is mentioned again in connection with the Spartan Teleutias' attack on Olynthus in 381 BCE.\n\nPopulated places in ancient Macedonia · 112T\n\nMembers of the Delian League · 236T\n\nFormer populated places in Greece · 1,238T\n\nAmydon Topic\n\n0 0\n\nrank #7 ·\n\nAmydon (Ancient Greek: Ἀμυδών; gen: Ἀμυδῶνος) was a town of ancient Macedonia in the lower Axios region of Amphaxitis. It is mentioned by Homer, as the capital of the Paeonians, who under Pyraechmes fought on the Trojan side in the Trojan War. The exact location seems to have been unknown in historical times. Amydon was later called Abydon, but according to Strabo, it was destroyed.\n\nEuropos (Macedonia) Ancient city in Greece\n\n0 0\n\nrank #9 ·\n\nEuropus (or Europos; Ancient Greek: Εὐρωπός) was a town in Bottiaea (later named Emathia), ancient Macedonia. It was located between Idomenae and the plains of Cyrrhus and Pella, probably situated on the right bank of the Axius below Idomene. Not far above the entrance of the great maritime plain, the site of Europus may perhaps hereafter be recognised by that strength of position which enabled it to resist Sitalces and the Thracians. We have the concurring testimony of Ptolemy and Pliny that this town of Emathia was different from Europus of Almopia.\n\nPopulated places in ancient Macedonia · 112T\n\nUpper Macedonia · 6T\n\nFormer populated places in Greece · 1,238T"
