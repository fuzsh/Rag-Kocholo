        "text": "Ars Bellum is a low complexity game that allows players to recreate a wide range of battles throughout Antiquity. The game emphasizes playability without sacrificing historical flavor (order of battle, commanders, units with special abilities).\n\nThe core rules take up a mere 5 pages of the 16-page booklet which is replete with illustrations, examples of play, and scenario information. Ars Bellum is an ideal introductory wargame for those newer to the hobby, but can also satisfy more seasoned players in search of a lighter gaming experience.\n\nThe game is articulated around a fluctuating initiative system, and a variety of parameters such as leader quality, unique unit skills and specific scenario conditions. Each scenario is fought on a small format map (17\" x 22\" or 11\" x 17\") and can be completed in one or two hours, depending on the size of the battle. Units represent bodies of 500-2000 men, depending on the type of unit and the scenario played. In addition to their combat strength (including ranged fire when relevant), many units feature special capabilities that reflect their specific behavior in battle and/or use of particular equipment.\n\nThe present volume offers no less than twelve battles, featuring Romans, Gauls, Hellens, Carthaginians, including their generals.\n\nRomans & Gauls Philip of Macedon Hellenes War Arretium (284-283 BC) Erigon (358 BC) Potidea (432 BC) Faesulae (225 BC) Thessaly (354 BC) Spartolos (429 BC) Telamon (225 BC) Crocus Field (352 BC) Olpae (426 BC) Chaeronae (338 BC) Amphipolis (422 BC) DÃ©lion (424 BC)"
