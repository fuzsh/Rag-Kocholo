But in general how bloody an affair was war in the Hellenic world.\n\nMy limited understanding on the matter is that battles were largerly a test of strength: with both sides lining up, singing war songs and then clashing against one another. And that the aim was to break the opposing side's fornation, rather than to skewer them with your spear.\n\nBut once the formation broke, was that it? Or would would a more chaotic melee ensue?"
