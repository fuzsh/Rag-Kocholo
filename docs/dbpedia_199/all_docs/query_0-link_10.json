The fighting started badly for Sparta, after their successful leader Lysander was killed at Haliartus in 395. In the following year the Spartans won inconclusive battles at Nemea in 394 and Coronea (394) while their allies suffered a costly defeat at Naryx. The fighting then moved south to the area around Corinth. In 392 the Spartans and some Corinthian allies captured the port of Lechaeum, but two years later the area of Leuchaeum was the site of a rare defeat for their hoplites, at the hands of lighter troops. Aegina saw prolonged fighting in 390-388, which caused some problems for the Athenians, before the war was ended by the King's Peace.\n\nmap\n\nBattles of the Persian Invasions of Greece\n\nThis map shows the main battles of the Greco-Persian Wars in the central Greek theatre. We start with Eretria in 490 and Marathon 490 , battles of Darius's invasion of 490. Ten years later Xerxes invaded in person, famously defeating the Spartans and allies at Thermopylae, but at the same time his fleet suffered a setback at Artemisium. The Persian victory at Thermopylae forced the Greeks to pull back.

After being expelled from Thebes the Spartans sent several expeditions into Boeotia to try and restore their control. The Theban campaign of 378 and Theban campaign of 377 both ended with the Spartans unable to reach Thebes, while the campaign of 376 was stopped at Cithaeron, on the borders of Boeotia. In the same year the Athenians won their first significant naval victory in their own name since the Great Peloponnesian War at Naxos. 375 saw the Spartans hoplites suffer a rare defeat at Tegyra, and their fleet a more common defeat at Alyzeia. A Spartan attempt to capture Corcyra (373-372 ) ended in failure and peace negotiations began. Eventually everybody but Thebes made peace, but the Spartans then suffered a crushing defeat at Leuctra, the first defeat for their main hoplite army.\n\nAncient Greek Warfare - This is the excellent Wikipedia entry describing the subject in detail.\n\nAncient Macedonian Army - This is the excellent Wikipedia entry describing the subject in detail.\n\nSpartan Army - This is another excellent Wikipedia entry\n\nWars of Alexander the Great - This is a Wikipedia entry - I will be creating a special folder to include the many articles and maps on this subject.\n\n411\n\nAbydos\n\nAbydos was on the Asiatic side of the Hellespont - the critical route for Athenian grain from Ukraine to reach the city.\n\nThe Athenian commanders were Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus with 74 ships\n\nThe Peloponnesian commander was Mindaruswith 97 ships including a fleet from Syracuse commanded by Dorieus.\n\nThe battle was an Athenian naval victory in the Peloponnesian War.\n\nSee the links for more details.\n\n322\n\nAbydos\n\nThe city was subjected to many sieges and battles and changed overlords frequently. The link describes these.\n\nThis battle in March was the first of two (or three) fought in the Lamian war between Athenians and Macedonians (see battle of Amorgos below). At the time the Macedonian ruler was Antipater and he was in Europe (on the European side of the Hellespont) and the Athenian objective was to prevent a Macedonian reinforcement led by Leonnatus from crossing back to Europe to aid Antipater. The Athenian fleet numbered 170 and was commanded by Evetion while the Macedonian fleet numbered 140 and was commanded by Cleitus the White. The Macedonians won, but not decisively - that came in June at Amorgos.\n\n200\n\nAbydos, siege of\n\nOne of many, this siege of Abydos in 200 was one of the final of a series of conquests made by Philip V of Macedonia around the Aegean that helped trigger the Second Macedonian War (against Rome).\n\n366\n\nAdramyttium, siege of\n\nDuring the Great Satraps' Revolt, Ariobarzanes, satrap of Hellespontine Phygia, joined the revolt against Artaxerxes II in 367. Autophradates, satrap of Lydia, and Mausolus, satrap of Caria, besieged Ariobarzanes at Adramyttium in 366. However, the siege of Adramyttium was abandoned following the arrival ofAgesilaus II, King of Sparta, in 365.\n\n458\n\nAegina\n\nAegina was an island and the town on it in the Saronic Gulf opposite to Athens and a constant thorn in Athenian side.\n\nThis was a sea battle that took place between Aegina aided by the Peloponnesian League and Athens, as part of the Third Messenian War. Athens captured 70 ships, and landed, laying siege to the city-state. Not too surprising considering the rudimentary siege equipment at that time it required two years for the Athenians to capture the city.\n\n426\n\nAegitium\n\nThe battle of Aegitium was an Athenian defeat that ended a short-lived invasion of Aetolia during the Peloponnesian War. In 426 Athens sent a small fleet of 30 warships under the command of Demosthenes around the Peloponnese to operate in the north-west of Greece and the Corinthian Gulf. See the link for details..\n\n405\n\nAegospotami\n\nAegospotami was a small stream located on the European side of the Hellespont the critical route for Athenian grain from Crimea and Black Sea coast to reach the city. This time the Athenians were beached without adequate port or logistic facilities. They needed to be there in order to be able to watch Lysander who had a decent port at Lampsacus across the narrow strait on the Asiatic side.\n\nThe Spartan commanders were Lysanderand Aracus with 110 ships.\n\nThe Athenian commanders were Philoches and other admirals (with Conon present but not in command) with 180 ships.\n\nThe Spartan victory made this the decisive battle of the Peloponnesian war because the Spartans were then able to besiege Athens by land and sea and starve the populace into surrender. And the loss of most of their active fleet prevented them from even maintaining communication, let alone control of the many Aegean islands and cities on both sides. see Battle of Aegospotami.\n\n426\n\nAeolian Campaign, Aegitium\n\nDemosthenes led a fleet of 30 ships to the Gulf of Corinth in north west Greece during the Archidamian War phase of the Peloponnesian war. When he reached the area he organized local Athenian allies in the region and besieged Leucas Island. Instead of capturing the city at the urging of Messenians he abandoned that effort and switched into attacking the local tribes in Aetolia. But several of his allies abandoned him. He was successful initially. But then the Aetolians mobilized the various tribes in that large region. His Acarnanian allies were alienated and did not bring their reinforcements from Locris leaving him without the peltasts critical for battle in the rough terrain where the hoplite phalanx could not maneuver well. He did capture Aegitium but was then attacked from higher ground and forced to retreat. A retreating phalanx often then dispersed into a rout. He had heavy casualties which enabled the Spartans with their local allies to attack. Demosthenes regained Athenian local superiority by a brilliant defense of Naupactusand Acarnania.\n\n406\n\nAkragas, siege of\n\nThe Siege of Akragas took place in 406 in Sicily; the Carthaginian enterprise ultimately lasted a total of eight months. The Carthaginian army under Hannibal Mago besieged the Dorian Greek city of Akragas in retaliation for the Greek raids on Punic colonies in Sicily. The city managed to repel Carthaginian attacks until a relief army from Syracuse defeated part of the besieging Carthaginian army and lifted the siege of the city. During the siege, Hannibal and a large number of Carthaginian soldiers perished from the plague, and the survivors were in dire straits after the Greeks managed to cut their supply lines. The Carthaginians, now led by Himilco, a Magonid kinsman of Hannibal, managed to capture a Greek supply convoy of ships using the Carthaginian fleet, which forced the Greeks to face the threat of starvation in turn. This caused first the Sicilian Greek detachment, then most of the population of Akragas to leave the city, enabling Himilco to capture and sack the city.\n\nSee the link for full details.\n\n375\n\nAlyzeia\n\nIn the battle of Alyzeia the Athenians defeated a Spartan fleet that was supporting an attempt to move troops across the Corinthian Gulf into Boeotia (Theban-Spartan or Boeotian War, 379-371. In 379, 378 and 377 the Spartans had reached Boeotia by land, although their campaigns hadn't achieved much. In 376 King Cleombrotus hadn't even got as far as Boeotia, and had abandoned the entire campaign after suffering a minor defeat while attempting to cross the Cithaeron mountain range. see Battle of Alyzeia.\n\n498/7\n\nAmathus, siege of\n\nThe siege of Amathus was an attempt by Greek rebels to capture the pro-Persian Phoenician city of Amathus on Cyprus.\n\n322\n\nAmorgos\n\nAnorgos was a island in the Cyclades.\n\nThe Athenian commander was Eueton (Evetion) with 170 ships.\n\nThe Macedonian commander was Cleitus the White with 240 ships.\n\nIt was a naval battle was in the Lamian War (323=322).\n\nDate May or June 322\n\nResult Macedonian victory\n\nAt the time, despite relatively few Athenian losses it was considered to be the decisive naval battle of the war. The result was the end of Athenian thalassocracy and political independence. see Battle of Amorgos\n\n424\n\nAmphipolis, capture of\n\nThe link is to an entry that describes both the Spartan capture of Amphipolis and the later battle when the Athenians attempted to retake it.\n\nAmphipolis was an Athenian colony located in Thrace on the Strymon river at the northern end of the Aegean Sea and was a strategic city.\n\nThe Spartan leading general, Brasidas, led a Peloponnesian army far north to capture this strategic city in the winter of 424423.\n\nThe city was defended by general Eucles. He sent for reinforcements from Thasos Island, commanded by Thucydides, later the famous historian. He had there only 7 ships but set out for Amphipolis.\n\nBrasidas offered those citizens who would remain could keep their property and those who would leave could have safe passage. The city then surrendered before Thucydides could arrive. Thucydides reached Eion that same day and could only defend the port with the help of the Amphipolis citizens.\n\nBrasidas was busy finding allies from other Thracian cities plus even with the Macedonian king, Perdiccas II.\n\nThucydides claimed he could not have reached Eion any sooner, but he was recalled to Athens, tried and exiled.\n\nThe Athenians were afraid that their other allies would quickly capitulate, and Brasidas wanted to concentrate on expanding Spartan power in Thrace, so both sides agreed to a truce of one year- the armistice was signed in 423.\n\nBut Brasidas didn't stop, he seized Scione during the negotiations. So the Athenians ordered Cleon to recapture Amphipolis as soon as possible. This led to the Second Battle of Amphipolis.\n\n422\n\nAmphipolis, Second Battle\n\nBrasidas remained the Spartan commander with 2,000 hoplites and 300 cavalry and local troops in Amphipolis.\n\nThe Athenian commander was Cleon with 30 ships, 1,200 hoplites and 300 cavalry plus allied troops.\n\nEnroute, Cleon captured Torone and Scione. At Scione the Spartan commander, Pasitelidas, was killed. Cleon reached the city and established his base at Eion, a city slightly south of Amphipolis. Brasidas placed his troops on a nearby hill at Cerdylion on the right bank of the Strymon River. He decided not to face Cleon in an open field battle so moved back into the city but decided to attack from there rather than face a siege.\n\nCleon then recognized that Brasidas would attack so ordered a withdrawal back to Eion and wait for reinforcements.\n\nAs the Athenian hoplites were strung out while passing the city, Brasidas launched his attack by surprise from two different city gates, he lead one in person flanking the lead Athenian elements and the other under Clearidas's command attacking them from the rear of their column.\n\nBrasidas was mortally wounded and died in the city and Cleon was killed in the battle.\n\nThe surviving Athenians (having lost about 600) reached Eion.\n\nOnly seven other Spartans were killed.\n\nThe battle was basically a draw, although Amphipolis was not captured. But the main result was that Brasidas, being the leading Spartan advocating continual war, and Cleon, the most warlike of the Athenians were both dead. Thus the Spartan and Athenian governments agreed on a treaty called the Peace of Nicias in 421 after the leading Athenian leader who continually advocated peace.\n\nThis treaty was also eventually broken and the war was renewed.\n\n357\n\nAmphipolis, siege of\n\nThe siege of Amphipolis in 357 was an early victory for Philip II of Macedon, in which he captured a key foothold in Thrace, although at the cost of permanently damaging his relationship with Athens. Amphipolis was an important city just inland from the coast, to the east of Chalcidice.\n\nSee the link for details.\n\n480\n\nAndros, siege of\n\nThe siege of Andros in c.480 is an incident recorded by Herodotus as taking part in the period after the Greek naval victory at Salamis. In the aftermath of the Greek naval victory at Salamis the Persian fleet retreated back towards the Hellespont. The land army remained in Attica for a little longer..\n\nThe Greeks soon realized that the Persian fleet had escaped, and belatedly decided on pursuit, They put in at Andros, where they debated what to do next. According to Herodotus the Athenians wanted to go to the Hellespont to cut the bridge of ships and thus trap the Persian army, but the rest of the fleet wanted to let Xerxes escape. When the Athenian Themistocles realized that he couldn't win the debate he changed sides, and supported the idea of giving the Persians a way out. The Greeks next turned their attention to the town of Andros.\n\nSee the link to find out what happened next.\n\n246\n\nAndros\n\nThe battle of Andros is one of the more obscure naval battles of the Hellenistic era. It was fought between a Macedonian fleet under Antigonus the old man, and an Egyptian fleet, close to the important Egyptian naval base on Andros. The date of 246 is not certain, and is partly based on the establishment of two vase festivals at Delos in 245 by Antigonus IIGonatas to celebrate an unknown victory. This date would place the battle as taking place during the Third Syrian War (246-241), between Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid Empire. Although Macedonia is not known to have taken part directly in that war, that does not preclude this date. The result of the battle is known. The Macedonian fleet, under the command of Antigonus, defeated a larger Egyptian fleet, under a commander called Sophron. The defeat seems to have ended serious Egyptian interest in the Aegean, although she still possessed a powerful fleet, which played a part in the Third Syrian War, as well as limited possessions in the area, including the island of Thera.\n\n326\n\nAornos\n\nAornos was the Ancient Greek name for the site of Alexander the Great's siege, which took place in April 326, at a mountain site located in modern Pakistan. The warlike tribes around Aornos offered the last threat to Alexander's supply line, which stretched, dangerously vulnerable, over the Hindu Kush back to Balkh, though Arrian (although disbelieving himself of this story) credits Alexander's desire to outdo his kinsman Heracles, who allegedly had proved unable to take a fort that the Macedonians called Aornos (according to Arrian and Diodorus; Aornis according to Curtius; elsewhere Aornus): meaning \"birdless\" in Greek. According to one theory, the name is a corruption of an Indo-Iranian word, such as *awarana \"fortified place\". According to Arrian, the rock had a flat summit well-supplied with natural springs and wide enough to grow crops: it could not be starved into submission. Neighboring tribesmen who surrendered to Alexander offered to lead him to the best point of access.\n\nThe location of the battle was investigated extensively by Aurel Stein who visited the place personally.\n\nSee links for details.\n\n381\n\nApollonia\n\nIn the battle of Apollonia Sparta's ally Derdas of Elimia defeated an Olynthian cavalry raid that had entered the territory of Apollonia. In 382 the Spartans had received two embassies asking for help against Olynthus, a rising power in Chalcidice, and had decided to send an army north to aid Amyntas III of Macedon and the Chalcidian cities of Acanthus and Apollonia. Their first army was sent in two waves, of which only the first reached Thrace, where it soon bogged down. The second wave ended up seizing power in Thebes. The Spartans responded by sending a second army to Thrace, this time commanded by Teleutias, the half brother of King AgesilausII. On his way north Teleutias took care to gather allies, amongst them the Thracian king Derdas of Elimia. Soon after arriving in the area Teleutias led his army to Olynthus, where he was saved from defeat by Derdas (battle of Olynthus, 382. Although Teleutias claimed this had been a victory, over the winter of 382-38 the Olynthians carried out a series of raids into the territory of Sparta's allies in the area. In the spring of 381 the Olynthians sent a force of six hundred cavalry to raid Apollonia, north of Olynthus. By noon on the day of the raid the Olynthian cavalry was quite widely spread, plundering the local area. Unluckily for the Olynthians, on the same day Derdas had arrived in Apollonia with his cavalry. Derdas waited until the raiders were approaching the city walls of Apollonia before he unleashed his own cavalry. This caught the Olynthians by surprise, disorganized, and probably separated into smaller groups in the suburbs of Apollonia. In contrast Derdas's men were well concentrated, and they quickly forced the raiders to flee. The Olynthians were pursued all the way back to their city walls, losing eighty dead during the fighting. This was the high point for Teleutias. Later in 381 he launched another raid into Olynthian territory, but he was caught by the Olynthian cavalry, which had clearly not been too badly damaged at Apollonia, defeated, and killed (battle of Olynthus, 381. This didn't end the bad news for Sparta - a fresh army, commanded by King Agesipolis, was sent north, but didn't achieve much before the king died of a fever in the summer of 380.\n\n406\n\nArginusae\n\nArginusae was a group of islands in the Aegean.\n\nThe naval Battle of Arginusae took place in 406 during the Peloponnesian Warnear the city of Canae in the Arginusae islands, east of the island of Lesbos. In the battle, an Athenian fleet commanded by eight strategoi defeated a Spartan fleet under Callicratidas. see Battle of Arginusae\n\n480\n\nArtemisium\n\nThe Battle of Artemisium, or Battle of Artemision, was a series of naval engagements over three days during the second Persian invasion of Greece. The battle took place simultaneously with the land battle at Thermopylae, in August or September 480, off the coast of Euboea and was fought between an alliance of Greek city-states, including Sparta, Athens, Corinth and others, and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I. see Battle of Artemisium\n\nFor a neat animated map of the battle click here.\n\n404\n\nAthens, siege of\n\nThe siege of Athens in to 404 was the final act of the Great Peloponnesian War, and confirmed the Spartan victory that had been made almost inevitable at the naval battle of Aegospotami in 405.\n\nSee the link for details.\n\n287\n\nAthens, siege of\n\nThe Siege of Athens lasted through 287 when the city was put under siege by King Demetrius I of Macedon. Athens revolted in that year against Demetrius' rule and elected Olympiodorus as strategos. Olympiodorus raised a force among the Athenian citizens, including old men and children, and attacked the Macedonian garrison that had retreated to the fort at the Museum hill which he took with the loss of just 13 of his men.\n\nSee the link for more.\n\n684\n\nBoar's Barrow\n\nThe battle was a year after Derae during the Second Messenian War. Aristomenes defeated the Spartans.\n\n657 - on\n\nByzantium\n\nByzantium was a Greek city It was colonized by the Greeks from Megara in 657. The city was taken by the Persian Empire at the time of the Scythian campaign in 513 of King Darius I, and was added to the administrative province of Skudra. Though Persian control of the city was never as stable as compared to other cities in Thrace, it was considered, alongside Sestos, to be one of the foremost ports on the European coast of the Bosporus and the Hellespont. Byzantium was besieged by Greek forces during the Peloponnesian War. As part of Sparta's strategy for cutting off grain supplies to Athens during their siege of Athens, Sparta took control of the city in 411, to bring the Athenians into submission. The Athenian military later retook the city in 408, when the Spartans had withdrawn following their settlement.\n\n408\n\nByzantium, siege of\n\nThe siege of Byzantium in (408 was an Athenian victory that saw them regain control over the Bosphorus, and remove a threat to Athens's food supplies from the Black Sea (Great Peloponnesian War). Byzantium had been part of the Athenian Empire, but it had rebelled after the Athenian disaster at Syracuse, and by 408 was held by a mixed garrison of Byzantines, Perioci (free non-citizens of Sparta), Neodamodes (Helots freed after serving in the Spartan army), Megarians and Boeotians, all commanded by the Spartan governor Clearchus.\n\nSee the link for more.\n\n340\n\nByzantium, siege of\n\nThe siege of Byzantium in 340-339 was an unsuccessful attempt by Philip II to defeat a former ally, and was begun after his siege of nearby Perinthus ran into difficulties. Both sieges came in the build-up to the Fourth Sacred War.\n\n490\n\nCarystus, siege of\n\nCarystus was a town on the south eastern end of Euboea Island that refused the Persians demands during their campaign in 490 to Marathon. They besieged and captured the city and took the remaining citizens to Persia. See the link.\n\n352\n\nCephisus River\n\nThe battle of the Cephisus River was the second in a series of defeats suffered by the Phocian leader Phayllus during a failed invasion of Boeotia (Third Sacred War) and Third Sacred War.Phayllus became the Phocian leader after his brother Onomarchus was killed at the battle of the Crocus Field in Thessaly in 353 . Almost half of the Phocian army was destroyed in that battle, but Phayllus was soon able to recruit fresh troops. He was also helped by the arrival of 2,000 men under the defeated tyrants of Pherae and troops sent by his allies (1,000 from Sparta, 2,000 from Achaea and 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from Athens). Phayllus used his new army to carry out an unsuccessful invasion of Boeotia. His first target was the city of Orchomenus, but he suffered a defeat in battle near the city. Next came a costly defeat on the Cephisus River. Diodorus provides no details of the battle itself, but records the Phocian losses as 500 dead and 400 prisoners.\n\n447\n\nChaeronea\n\nChaeronea was a village in Boeotia, about 80 kilometers east of Delphi.. Chaeronea was subject to Orchomenus which was, beginning in 600, a member of the Boeotian League. After it was captured by the Athenians in 447 they were attacked and defeated at the Battle of Coronea by Boeotians. But the best known battle was in 338 between Philip II of Macedon and a coalition of various Greek states, including Thebes and Athens.\n\n352\n\nChaeronea\n\nThe battle of Chaeroneia was an early defeat in the career of Phalacus as leader of the Phocians (Third Sacred War). In 353 the successful Phocian commander Onomarchus was killed at the battle of the Crocus Field in Thessaly, a major Phocian defeat at the hands of Philip II of Macedon. He was succeeded by his brother Phayllus, who proved to be a rather unsuccessful commander. He did manage to create a fresh army to replace the one last at the Crocus Field, but then led it to a series of defeats in Boeotia (Orchomenus, the Cephisus River and Coroneia) and at Abae, on the borders of Phocis. During this period Phayllus was suffering from a wasting disease, and soon after the defeat at Abae he died. After the death of Phayllus he was succeeded as general by Phalacus, the young son of his brother Onomarchus. Phayllus had had time to make proper preparations for the succession, and appointed his friend Mnaseas as Phalacus's guardian. Mnaseas and two hundred of his men were killed when the Boeotians carried out a night attack on his camp. This left Phalacus without his guardian, and he was further undermined when he suffered a defeat in a cavalry battle near Chaeroneia. Phalacus wasn't discouraged by this defeat. Possibly later in the same year the Boeotians were distracted by a conflict in the Peloponnese, and Phalacus took advantage of this to occupy Chaeroneia. This was a short-lived success, and he was forced to retreat when the main Boeotian army returned. This was followed by a Boeotian invasion of Phocis, but the Boeotian army retired after gathering a great deal of loot. This ended a rather eventful year, but one that had failed to bring any end to the conflict. The war dragged on for several more years, and didn't end until 346, but for most of the time it was limited to skirmishes close to the border between Phocis and Boeotia.\n\n338\n\nChaeronea\n\nThe Battle of Chaeronea was fought in 338, near the city of Chaeronea in Boeotia, between the Macedonians led by Philip II of Macedon and an alliance of some of the Greek city-states led by Athens and Thebes.\n\nThe battle of Chaeronea (August 338) was the final major battle in the career of Philip II of Macedon, and saw him defeat a Greek alliance led by Thebes and Athens, in the process establishing his dominance over the states of central and southern Greece. Philip was officially present in central Greece in response to a call from the Delphic Amphictyony, for his help against Amphissa (Fourth Sacred War, 339-338), but his main object always appears to have been to settle the affairs of central Greece and in particular to defeat Athens, which had been at war with him since the previous year.\n\nFor a neat animated map of the battle click here.\n\n408\n\nChalcedon, siege of\n\nThe siege of Chalcedon in 408 was part of an Athenian attempt to regain control of the Bosphorus and ensure the safety of Athens's food supplies from the Black Sea during the Peloponnesian War. Chalcedon, on the Asian shore, and Byzantium, on the European shore, had been part of the Athenian Empire, but both cities rebelled after the Athenian defeat at Syracuse. The Athenians managed to regain control over the Hellespont at the battle of Cyzicus in 410, but had to wait another two years before they were in a position to move against Chalcedon and Byzantium.\n\nSee the link for more.\n\n429\n\nChalcis\n\nThe battle of Chalcis was the first of two Athenian naval victories won in the same year in the Gulf of Corinth that helped demonstrate their naval superiority in the early part of the Great Peloponnesian War. In 429 the Spartans decided to launch an invasion of Acarnania, the area to the north-west of the entrance to the Gulf of Corinth. The plan was for their fleets to unite at Leucas, an island to the north-west of the gulf. Part of the combined fleet was to come from the Peloponnese and from other areas outside the gulf, while the rest sailed from Corinth and other areas inside the gulf. See the link.\n\n357\n\nChios\n\nThe battle of Chios was the first battle of the Social War, in which the rebels defeated an Athenian land and sea attack on the island. The Social War (or)was triggered by the refusal of Chios to pay its annual contribution to the Athenian League. Chios, Rhodes and Byzantium were at the heart of the revolt, joined by Cos, and supported by Mausolus, satrap of Caria. The rebels concentrated their forces at Chios, a sizable island off the west coast of Asia Minor, and the nearest of the rebel states to Athens. The Athenians also decided to deal with Chios first. Chares and Chabrias were give command of the army and fleet that was sent to deal with the revolt (Cornelius Nepos provides a different version, in which Chabrias was present in a private capacity, but ended up with more influence than the real commanders). They arrived at Chios after the allies, and decided to attack. The army, under Chares, was landed on the island, while Chabrias commanded the fleet. Diodorus hints at a siege followed by a unsuccessful assault on the city, although it is possible that the assault was made immediately after the Athenians arrived. The plan was for a two pronged assault. Chabrias was to lead the fleet into the harbor, where he would attack the Allied fleet. Chares would attack from the land. Chabrias was soon caught up in a fierce naval battle. His ship was rammed, and probably immobilized. He may have got ahead of the rest of the fleet, as the other ships withdrew intact.\n\nAccording to Diodorus Chabrias chose to fight on, and died of his wounds. Cornelius Nepos has Chabrias dashing ahead of the rest of the fleet as he wanted to be the first into the harbor. He was then surrounded, and chose to fight to the death rather than swim to safety.\n\n596-585\n\nCirrha, siege\n\nThe city was besieged and destroyed in the First SacredWar.\n\nThe ten year siege was the event of the First Sacred War in which the cities of the Amphictyonic League destroyed Cirrha because it had been despoiling the temple of Delphi.\n\n376\n\nCithaeron\n\nThe battle of Cithaeron was a minor Spartan defeat that prevented them from conducting a fourth invasion of Boeotia in four years (Theban-Spartan War). Sparta had seized control of Thebes in 382, but the pro-Spartan government had been expelled in 379. The Spartans responded with a series of invasions of Boeotia. In 379 King Cleombrotusgot close to Thebes, but withdrew without achieving anything. In 378 and 377 King Agesilaus II led the invasions, and managed to get into Boeotia and again got close to Thebes, but both invasions ended without achieving much. In the aftermath of the 377 campaign Agesilaus burst a vein in his leg, and was unfit for the campaign of 376. This meant that King Cleombrotus took command for a second time. In 377 the Spartan garrison of Thespiae had been ordered to keep the passes across the Cithaeron range open, to allow the Spartans to move from Attica into Boeotia, but in 376 the passes were defended by Theban and Athenian troops. It is possible that the Spartan garrisons at Plataea and Tanagra, on the Boeotian side of the mountains, had been defeated before this, thus explaining their inability to help the invasion. Cleombrotus ordered his peltasts to seize the pass. As the Spartans approached, the defenders sortied, and killed forty of the attackers. Cleombrotus wasn't as persistent as Agesilaus, and he decided that this made the entire invasion impossible. He retreated, disbanded the army, and returned home. Cleombrotus's poor performance in Boeotia in 379 and 376 might have played a part in the Spartan disaster atLeuctrain 371, where Cleombrotus was defeated and killed, triggering the start of a dramatic decline in Spartan power. The king may have been motivated to fight by a desire to restore his reputation.\n\n451\n\nCitium, siege\n\nSiege of Kition (Citium) The League fleet was campaigning there in 460, before being instructed to head to Egypt to support Inaros's rebellion. The Egyptian disaster would eventually lead the Athenians to sign a five-year truce with Sparta in 451. This freed the League from fighting, the League was again able to dispatch a fleet to campaign in Cyprus in 451, under the recently recalled Cimon. Cimon sailed for Cyprus with a fleet of 200 ships provided by the Athenians and their allies. However, 60 of these ships were sent to Egypt at the request of Amyrtaeus, the so-called \"King of the Marshes\" (who still remained independent of, and opposed to Persian rule). The rest of the force besieged Kition in Cyprus, but during the siege, Cimon died either of sickness or a wound. The Athenians lacked provisions, and apparently under the death-bed instructions of Cimon, the Athenians retreated towards Salamis-in-Cyprus. Cimon's death was kept a secret from the Athenian army. Thirty days after leaving Kition, the Athenians and their allies were attacked by a Persian fleet composed of Cilicians, Phoenicians, and Cyprians, off Salamis-in-Cyprus. Under the 'command' of the deceased Cimon, they defeated this force at sea, and also in a land battle. Having thus successfully extricated themselves, the Athenians sailed back to Greece, joined by the flotilla which had been sent to Egypt. These battles formed the end of the Greco-Persian Wars.\n\n386\n\nCitium\n\nA naval battle off Citium on Cyprus in which the Persians commanded by admiral Glos attacked Evagoras's fleet, The Cyprians were winning at first but eventually the larger Persian fleet forced Evagoras to withdraw after suffering significant losses. The battle then shifted on to Cyprus and led to the Siege of Salamas city.\n\n412-411\n\nCnidus\n\nThe naval battle of Cnidus in 412 or 411 in which the Athenians were unable to prevent two Spartan fleets from uniting on the coast of Asia Minor during the Peloponnesian War). In the winter of 412/411 the Athenians were besieging Chios, in the centre of the western coast of Asia Minor. The Spartans had a fleet at Miletus, further south along the coast. This fleet was commanded by Astyochus,. When another fleet of 27 ships was sent to join him, a group of officers were sent to work alongside him, and if necessary relieve him. This fleet encountered a small Athenian force on the way, and decided to divert to Crete, and then to Caunus. The Athenians, who had a fleet based at Samos (between Chios and Miletus), discovered this, and sent a squadron of twenty ships under Charminus south in an attempt to intercept the new arrivals. When Astyochus learned that his reinforcements were at Caunus he decided to bring his fleet around the coast to join them. He passed Cos, and reached Cnidus, at the south-western tip of Asia Minor. There he learned that the Athenians were close by, and sailed on towards the island of Syme in an attempt to catch them. In bad weather the Spartan fleet was scattered. In the poor visibility the Athenians sighted the Spartan left wing and incorrectly identified them as the fleet coming from Caunus. Charminus put to sea with as many ships as were ready. The initial encounter was won by the Athenians, who sank three ships and disabled others. The rest of the Spartan fleet then came into sight, and the Athenians became surrounded. The Athenians managed to break out of the trap, although six ships were lost. The survivors then escaped south to the island of Teutlussa, from where they moved north to Halicarnassus. After this battle the Spartans returned to Cnidus where they were joined by the twenty seven ships from Caunus. The defeated Athenians were joined by the rest of the fleet from Samos, but even reinforced they didn't dare risk another battle, and returned to Samos\n\n394\n\nCnidus\n\nIn the naval battle of Cnidus in 394 the Persian Empire fought the Spartan naval fleet during the Corinthian War. A fleet under the joint command of Pharnabazusand former Athenian admiral, Conon, destroyed the Spartan fleet led by the inexperienced Peisander, ending Sparta's brief bid for naval supremacy. The battle outcome was a significant boost for the anti-Spartan coalition that resisted Spartan hegemony in the course of the Corinthian War. see Battle of Cnidus\n\n373-372\n\nCorycera, siege and battle\n\nThe siege and battle of Corcyra in 373-2 was the defeat of a Spartan attempt to seize control of the Ionian Sea, and triggered a resumption of warfare in the Theban-Spartan or Boeotian War of 379-381.\n\n447\n\nCoronea\n\nLocation Coronea\n\nResult Boeotian victory\n\nBilligerents Boeotian city-states versus Athenian ledDelian League\n\nCommanders and leaders\n\nBoeotians - Sparton\n\nDelian League Tolmides\n\nStrength\n\nBoeotians Unknown\n\nDelians 1000 hoplites, others?\n\nCasualties and losses Unknown Unknown\n\nThe Battle of Coronea (also known as the First Battle of Coronea) took place between the Athenian-led Delian League and the Boeotian League during the First Peloponnesian War.\n\nThe Athenians had taken control of Boeotia at the Battle of Oenophyta, and spent the next ten years attempting to consolidate the League's power.\n\nIn 454 Athens lost a fleet attempting to aid an Egyptian revolt against Persia.\n\nAthens moved the treasury to their city from Delos in 453, and signed the Peace of Callias with Persia in 450. By 447 some of the men exiled from Boeotia after the Athenian victory there in 457 had returned home and began to take back some of the Boeotian towns. The Athenians under Tolmides, with 1,000 hoplites plus other troops from their allies, marched into Boeotia to take back the recaptured towns. They captured Chaeronea, but were attacked and defeated by the Boeotians at Coronea. The Athenians were forced to give up control of Boeotia. Boeotia was allowed to leave the Delian League in return for allowing the Athenians to leave Boeotia safely. The defeat led to revolts on Euboea and in Megara, which in turn led to further conflict with Sparta, contributing to the Peloponnesian War.\n\n394\n\nCoronea\n\nIn the battle of Coronea, during the Corinthian War, the Spartans and their allies under King Aegsilaus IIdefeated a force of Thebans and Argives that was attempting to block their march back from Asia Minor to the Peloponnese. see Battle of Coronea\n\n352\n\nCoroneia\n\nThis battle of Coroneia was the second in a series of defeats suffered by the Phocian leader Phayllus during a failed invasion of Boeotia (Third Sacred War) and . In 353 the Phocian leader Onomarchus was defeated and killed by Philip II of Macedon at the battle of the Crocus Field in Thessaly. He was succeeded by his brother Phayllus, who managed to gather a fresh army. This was a mix of troops from his allies (1,000 from Sparta, 2,000 from Achaea and 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from Athens), 2,000 men led by the defeated Tyrants of Pherae, and mercenaries hired using the treasure from Delphi. Phayllus led this new army on unsuccessful invasion of Boeotia.\n\n261 - 255?\n\nCos\n\nThe Battle of Cos was fought in 261, or as late as 255, between an Antigonid fleet and a Ptolemaic fleet. Antigonus II Gonatas led his forces to victory, possibly over Patroclus, admiral of Ptolemy II. It has been widely assumed that the battle severely damaged Ptolemaic control of the Aegean, but this has been contested.\n\nSee link for more details on this significant battle.\n\n322\n\nCrannon\n\nThe battle of Crannon was fought between the Macedonian forces of Antipater and Craterus and the forces of a coalition of cities including Athens and the Aetolian League. It was the decisive battle of the Lamian War. The Macedonian victory, though militarily unspectacular, convinced the other Greeks to sue for peace. see Battle of Crannon.\n\n465\n\nCrastus\n\nThe battle of Crastus (c.465) took place in the period between the removal of several Tyrants on Sicily and the establishment of a period of peace, and was fought between Akragas on one side and the inhabitants of the town of Crastus and their allies from Himera and Gela on the other.\n\n339\n\nCrimissus\n\nThe Battle of the Crimissus (also spelled Crimisus and Crimesus) was fought in 339 between a large Carthaginian army commanded by Hasdrubal and Hamilcar and an army from Syracuse led by Timoleon. Timoleon is one of Cornelius Nepos's great commanders.\n\nWhen the Carthaginians received news that their territory was being raided by Timoleon's mercenaries, they marched against them immediately under the command of Hasdrubal and Hamilcar. When the Syracusians heard about the coming of the huge Carthaginian army, they were terrified; Timoleon could gather no more than 3,000 of them to march against the Carthaginians.\n\nThe battle was fought in early June 339. Timoleon was positioned on a hill with his army, overlooking a plain where the Carthaginian army was located. The Crimissus river separated the two armies and covered the plain in a thick fog, making it impossible to see the Carthaginian camp. However, the noise signaled to the Greeks that the Carthaginians were going to cross the river.\n\nVastly outnumbered, Timoleon attacked the Carthaginian army by surprise while it was crossing the Crimissus river. The Carthaginians fiercely resisted the initial assault, but a storm which started during the battle worked to the advantage of the Greeks. When the first rank of the Carthaginian army was defeated, the whole army was routed. The Greeks killed or captured many of those who fled and Carthage lost a large number of its wealthiest citizens in the battle.\n\nSee the links for more details.\n\n353\n\nCrocus field\n\nLocation - Thessaly, Greece\n\nResult - Macedonian victory.\n\nOpponents Macedon versus Thessaly\n\nConfederation Phocis, Athens\n\nCommanders and leaders:\n\nMacedon -Philip II\n\nAllies: Phocis Onomarchus - Athens, Chares\n\nStrength:\n\nMacedon 20,000 foot 3,000 horse\n\nAllies 20,000 foot 500 horse\n\nCasualties and losses:\n\nMacedon - up to 9,000 dead\n\nThe so-called Battle of Crocus Field (Krokion pedion) (353 or 352 was a battle in the Third Sacred War, (and) fought between the armies of Phocis, under Onomarchus, and the combined Thessalian and Macedonian army under Philip II of Macedon.\n\nIn the bloodiest battle recorded in Ancient Greek history, the Phocians were decisively defeated by Philip's forces.

After the revolt of the critical city of Miletus, the Persian satrap Tissaphernes concluded an alliance against Athens with Sparta. The Spartans remained unwilling to challenge the Athenians at sea, and an Athenian fleet succeeded in recapturing several cities and besieging Chios during the later months of 412. In 411, however, further rebellions at Rhodes and Euboea, and the capture of Abydos and Lampsacus on the Hellespont by a Peloponnesian army that had marched there overland, forced the Athenians to disperse their forces to meet these various threats. The Spartan fleet could now move freely in the Aegean, and took advantage of its new found superiority by lifting the blockade of Chios and bottling up the Athenians' Aegean fleet at Samos. By withdrawing their ships from the Hellespont to Samos, the Athenians were able to reestablish their naval superiority in the Aegean, but in doing so they enabled the Spartans to shift the theater of war. Accordingly, in late July, the Spartan commander Clearchusmade an attempt to slip 40 ships past the Athenian fleet to the Hellespont. These were turned back by a storm, but shortly afterwards 10 ships under the Megarian general Helixus reached the Hellespont, where they triggered revolts in Byzantium, Chalcedon and other important cities. Several months later, the new Spartan navarch Mindarus, deciding that the promises of support made by Pharnabazus,the Persian satrap of northern Asia Minor, were more promising than those of Tissaphernes in Ionia, slipped his entire fleet past the Athenians. He joined up with the Peloponnesian ships already operating in the Hellespont and established his base at Abydos, forcing the small Athenian fleet at Sestos to flee, with losses, to Imbros and Lemnos.\n\nSee both links for two detailed accounts.\n\n329\n\nCyropolis, siege of\n\nCyropolis was the largest of seven towns in the Sogdiana region that Alexander the Great targeted for conquest in 329. His goal was the conquest of Sogdiana. Alexander first sent Craterusto Cyropolis, the largest of the Sogdianan towns holding out against Alexander's forces. Craterus' instructions were to \"take up a position close to the town, surround it with a ditch and stockade, and then assemble such siege engines as might suit his purpose....\". The idea was to keep the inhabitants focused on their own defences and to prevent them from sending assistance out to the other towns.\n\nSee links for details.\n\n410\n\nCyzicus\n\nThe naval battle of Cyzicus took place in 410 during the Peloponnesian War.\n\nOpponents: Athens versus Sparta and Persian Empire\n\nCommanders and leaders:\n\nAthens: Alcibiades, Thrasybulus, Theramenes, Chaereas\n\nSparta: Mindarus, Hippokrates, Clearchus, Hermocrates - Persia Pharnabazus\n\nStrength:\n\nAthens: 86 triremes\n\nSparta: 80 triremes\n\nCasualties and losses:\n\nAthens: Minimal\n\nSparta: Entire fleet\n\nResult: Another great Athenian victory\n\nAthenian naval strategy at the battle of Cyzicus:\n\nAlcibiades' decoy force draws the Spartan fleet out into open water, and then turns about to engage them. Squadrons commanded by Thrasybulus and Theramenes move in behind the Spartan ships, to cut off their line of retreat, trapping the Spartans between three groups of Athenian warships; a much larger force than they had initially expected to engage.\n\nAfter the Athenian victory atAbydos in November 411, the Spartan admiral Mindarus sent to Sparta for reinforcements and began working with the Persian satrap Pharnabazus to plan for a new offensive. The Athenians, meanwhile, were unable to follow through on their victory, since the depletion of the Athenian treasury precluded any major operations. Thus, by the spring of 410, Mindarus had built a fleet of eighty ships, and with the support of Pharnabazus's troops, besieged and took the city of Cyzicus. The Athenian fleet in the Hellespont withdrew from its base at Sestosto Cardia to avoid the superior Spartan force, and the ships under Alcibiades, Theramenes, Thrasybulus that had been dispatched to raise money combined with this force, creating a fleet of 86 ships. This fleet, along with a force of land troops under Chaereas, set out to the Hellespont to challenge Mindarus.\n\nSee Battle of Cyzicus and links for more details.\n\n424\n\nDelium\n\nDelium was a city in Boeotia. The battle took place during the Peloponnesian War. The Athenian generals Demosthenes and Hippocrates planned to invade Boeotia. Demosthenes mistakenly sailed too early and landed at Siphae, where his plans were betrayed by a Phocian named Nicomachus. As Hippocrates had not yet arrived, Demosthenes could not attack and was forced to withdraw. Hippocrates eventually arrived in Boeotia with an Athenian army and began to fortify the temple at Delium. After five days, the fortifications were complete, and Hippocrates set up a garrison and sent the rest of his army back to Athens. At the same time, the Boeotians gathered their army to challenge Hippocrates, but when they saw that the Athenians were leaving, many of them thought that it was pointless to attack. Pagondas of Thebes, the commander of the Boeotian forces, urged them to attack anyway because he knew that the Athenians would eventually return and use Delium as a base for further invasions.\n\nOpponents: Athens versus Boeotia\n\nCommanders and leaders:\n\nAthens - Hippocrates\n\nBoeotia - Pagondas\n\nStrength:\n\nAthens 15,000 total\n\nBoeotia 18,500 total 7,000 hoplites 1,000 cavalry 500 peltasts 10,000 light troops\n\nCasualties and losses:\n\nAthens About 1,200\n\nBoeotia About 500\n\nResult: Boeotian victory\n\nSee the links for details about the battle\n\n406\n\nDelphinium, siege of\n\nThe siege of Delphinium in 406 was a minor Peloponnesian success that came early in the command of Callicratidas,an admiral who replaced the popular Lysander in command of the Peloponnesian fleet in Asia Minor (Great Peloponnesian War). Callicratidas took control of a fleet of 140 warships, including 50 newly provided by Sparta's allies, as well as the fleet recently commanded by Lysander. Callicratidas' first target was the Athenian held fortress of Delphinium, on Chios. Chios had been one of the first areas to rebel against Athenian control after the disaster on Syracuse, and the Athenians had since been unable to regain control of the island, but they had managed to blockade it for some time.\n\nSee the link for more.\n\n685\n\nDerea\n\nThe battle took place during the Second Messenian War when the Messenians conquered in the first war then revolted.

He considers it one of the 5 'greatest contests' they had along with Plataea and Tegea, Mt Ithome in 465 and Tanagra in 458.\n\n226\n\nDyme\n\nThe Battle of Dyme or Dymae was a battle that was fought by the Achaean League under the command of their Strategos, Hyperbatas, and a Spartan army under the command of King Cleomenes III, and was part of the Cleomenean War.

The arrival of stormy weather compelled Chares's collaborators, Iphicrates and Timotheos, who had both joined Chares as advisors with a supplementary force of 60 naval vessels and had joined up with Chares's fleet in the summer, to hold back from advancing. Chares, left with only one-third of his fleet, rashly attacked the Chians and suffered defeat with heavy losses.\n\nAfter Chares suffered defeat in the autumn expedition, he ultimately established a lawsuit against both Timotheos and Iphicrates. Timotheos faced impeachment in the aftermath of the lawsuit, which led to his ruination. As a result, Isocrates developed a personal hatred for Chares since Timotheos was one of his closest pupils. The detailed description of the speeches at Timotheos's trial are as model in Xenophon's Helenica.\n\nThe treatment of its finest admirals is in the case is another example of the the typical way in which the demos - mob - in Athens treated its own leaders. Cornelius Nepos rated both Iphicrates and Timotheos among the greatest ancient commanders.\n\nSee both links for more details about the battle.\n\n498\n\nEphesus\n\nThe battle at Ephesus took place during the Ionian Revolt when the Athenians sent a force to support the Ionian cities in their revolt against Persia.\n\nIn the spring of 498, an Athenian force of twenty triremes, accompanied by five from Eretria, sailed for Ionia.\n\nThey joined up with the main Ionian force near Ephesus. Declining to personally lead the force, Aristagoras appointed his brother Charopinus and another Milesian, Hermophantus, as generals. This force was then guided by the Ephesians through the mountains to Sardis, Artaphernes's satrapal capital. The Greeks caught the Persians unaware, and were able to capture the lower city. However, Artaphernes still held the citadel with a significant force of men. The lower city then caught on fire, Herodotus suggests accidentally, which quickly spread. The Persians in the citadel, being surrounded by a burning city, emerged into the market-place of Sardis, where they fought with the Greeks, forcing them back. The Greeks, demoralized, then retreated from the city, and began to make their way back to Ephesus. Herodotus says that when the Persians in Asia Minor heard of the attack on Sardis, they gathered together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. The Greeks were decisively defeated. Many were killed, including the Eretrian general, Eualcides. The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships and sailed back to Greece.\n\nSee the links for more details.\n\n435\n\nEpidamnus, siege of\n\nThe siege of Epidamnus in 435 saw the Corcyraeans capture their own former colony, overcoming a garrison partly provided by their own mother city of Corinth (Corinth-Corcyra War, 435-431). Epidamnus, on the Albanian coast, was a Greek colony founded by Corcyra (modern Corfu). Corcyra was herself a colony of Corinth, and so in keeping with tradition a Corinthian, Phalius, son of Eratocleides, from the then ruling family of the Heraclids, had been selected as the official founder of the city, and the original colonists included a number of Corinthians amongst the Corcyraeans. As with most Ancient Greek cities Epidamnus was the scene of constant strife between the Aristocratic and Democratic factions within the city, and it was also often threatened by the surrounding Illyrians.\n\nSee the link for much more.\n\n490\n\nEretria\n\nThe battle of Eretria was the second and final Persian success during the campaign that ended in defeat at Marathon. During the Ionian RevoltAthens and Eretria on Euboea had offered some support to the rebels. Darius I was determined to take revenge on the Greek cities, and in 492 he sent an army along the land route through Thrace. This expedition, commanded by his son-in-law Mardonius, restored Persian control over Thrace and forced the Macedonians to submit, but the fleet was then destroyed in a storm while sailing around Mt Athos and Mardonius was forced to retreat (Greco-Persian Wars). After this setback Darius ordered the construction of a fleet of horse transports. In 490 he raised a new army, and placed Datis the Mede and Artaphrenes son of Artaphernes, a nephew of Darius, in command of the expedition. This time the Persians planned to use the sea route across the Aegean. They left Samos and crossed the sea via Icaria, Naxos and Delos. They then landed at the eastern end of Euboea, where they were held up for a period by the refusal of Carystus to submit. After a short siege Carystus surrendered, and the Persians sailed around the Euboean coast, landing at Tamynae, Choereae and Aegilia, east of the city. While the Persians had been crossing the Aegean, the Eretrians had asked for help from Athens, and debated how to defend their city. The Athenians offered them 4,000 men from Chalcis. The debate was less clear-cut. One faction wanted to retreat into the Euboean hills. Another wanted to defend the city. A third wanted to surrender to the Persians. As a result of this confusion the Athenian contingent decided to return to the mainland, possibly following advice from Aeschines, son of Nothon, one of the Eretrian leaders. At Eretria the faction that had decided to defend the city won the debate. According to Herodotus a six day long battle raged, either outside the city or as a siege with the Eretrians defending the walls. He describes their plan as to meet the Persians in battle outside the city and to defend their walls, so either is possible. The city finally fell because of treachery on the part of two Eretrian leaders, Euphorbus son of Alcimachus and Philagrus son of Cyneas. The Persians sacked Eretria, destroying the religious sanctuaries. They justified this as revenge for the destruction of the sanctuaries at Sardis in 498 during the Ionian Revolt, although this may well have been accidental. The population of Eretria was enslaved, although when they finally arrived in Persia Darius is said to have relented and settled them at Cissia, quite close to Susa. The Persians rested for a few days after the fall of Eretria, and then turned south and sailed across to the mainland, landing at Marathon, in the north-east of Attica. The Athenians reacted by rushing their army to Marathon, where they went on to inflict a heavy defeat on the Persians. The Persians made a brief attempt to attack Athens directly, but then retreated back across the Aegean.\n\nSee the link for more details.\n\n490\n\nEretria, siege of\n\nThis is a different description of the same event in the previous entry.\n\nThe Siege of Eretria took place in 490, during the first Persian invasion of Greece. The city of Eretria, on Euboea, was besieged by a strong Persian force under the command of Datis and Artaphernes. The first Persian invasion was a response to Greek involvement in the Ionian Revolt, when the Eretrians and Athenians had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Eretrian and Athenian force had succeeded in capturing and burning Sardis (the regional capital of Persia), but was then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, the Persian king Darius I swore to have revenge on Athens and Eretria.\n\n411\n\nEretria\n\nThe naval battle of Eretria, between Sparta and Athens, took place in September 411, off the coast of Euboea.\n\nDuring the spring of 411, the Eretrians drove the Athenians out of Oropos with the help of the Boeotians. This city was a strategic point for Athens because it allowed them to control all of Euboea. Moreover, all the commercial traffic was made through the city. The Eretrians would hope that Sparta would help them to end the Athenian rule on Euboea.\n\nOpponents: Athens versus Sparta\n\nCommanders and leaders:\n\nAthens - unknown\n\nSparta - Hegesandridas\n\nStrength:\n\nAthens - 36 ships\n\nSparta - 42 ships\n\nCasualties and losses:\n\nAthens - 22 ships\n\nSparta - Minimal\n\nResult - Spartan victory\n\nBy the end of the summer 411, a large Spartan fleet sailed towards Euboea. The Athenians tried to prevent the Euboeans from switching sides by sending a squadron to Eretria. However, the Eretrians supported the Spartans. While the Athenians were in the harbor of Eretria in order to supply themselves, the Eretrians informed the Spartan admiral Hegesandridas by a signal fire that it was an appropriate time to attack. The Athenians hurriedly embarked but were defeated during the naval battle which followed. The Athenians who tried to take refuge in Eretria were killed by the town's inhabitants. Only those who decided to go to the Athenian fort in Eretria (which was likely on the Pezonisi Peninsula) survived.\n\nFollowing the battle, almost all of Euboea switched sides. Then there was a huge debate as to whether the Athenians would take them back, ending up in a massacre of Eretrians.\n\n358\n\nErigon Valley\n\nThe battle of Erigon Valley or the Battle of Lyncus Plain took place in 358 between the Dardanians under King Bardyllis and the Macedonians under King Philip II. After forty years on continuous Dardanian dominance and expansion under Bardyllis, Philip II after marrying Audata, an Illyrian princess, marched into Illyria and confronted the Dardanian tribesmen. The battle described by Diodorus and Frontinus shows the power and excellence of both the Macedonian and Dardanian armies\n\nOpponents\n\nMacedon Kingdom vs. Dardania\n\nCommanders and leaders\n\nPhilip II of Macedon\n\nBardyllis of Dardania\n\nStrength:\n\nMacedonians - 10,000 infantry, 600 cavalry\n\nDardanians -10,000 infantry, 500 cavalry\n\nCasualties and losses:\n\nMacedonians 300-500 killed\n\nDardanians 5,000 killed 1,000 captured\n\nIt seems that Bardyllis opposed the deal with Amyntas II and Sirras and invaded Macedonia in 393. Bardyllis used new warfare tactics never before used by any of the Illyrians. He won a decisive battle against Amyntas III, expelled him, and ruled Macedonia through a puppet king. In 392, Amyntas III allied himself with the Thessalians and took Macedonia under his rule from the Dardanians. However, the Illyrians were constantly raiding and ruling over the northern frontiers of Macedonia. After continuous invasions, Bardyllis forced the Macedonians to pay him an annual tribute in 372.\n\nSee the links for several versions with detail.\n\n413\n\nErineus\n\nThis was a small and brief battle between the Corinthian squadron commanded by Polyanthes and the Athenian squadron commanded by Diphilus based across the entrance to the Gulf of Corinth at Naupactus. But fleets numbered about 33 vessels. The Corinthians took position at the narrow entrance to a bay on the south side of the strait with Corinthian and Peloponnesian troops guarding the headland on each side. The Athenians attempted their usual tactic of bow-to bow ramming. But Polyanthes had innovated by greatly strengthening the bow of Corinthian triremes. They were thus able to cave in the bow of the Athenian vessels. The battle was a draw and no further actions too place. But the innovation was quickly copied by the Syracusians which enabled them to also crush the Athenian ships in their great harbor during the disastrous Athenian defeat of the siege and expedition.\n\n468\n\nEurymedon\n\nCimon carried the war against Persia into Asia Minor and decisively defeated the Persians at the Battle of the Eurymedon on the Eurymedon River in Pamphylia.\n\nOpponents: Delian League versus Achaemenid Empire\n\nCommanders and leaders:\n\nDelian League - Cimon\n\nPersians - Tithraustes,Pherendatis\n\nStrength:\n\nDelians - 200 ships\n\nPersians - 200350 ships\n\nCasualties and losses:\n\nDelians - Unknown\n\nAchaemenid Phoenicians - 200 ships captured and destroyed\n\nCimon's land and sea forces captured the Persian camp and destroyed or captured the entire Persian fleet of 200 triremes manned by Phoenicians. And he established an Athenian colony nearby called Amphipolis with 10,000 settlers. Many new allies of Athens were then recruited into the Delian League, such as the trading city of Phaselis on the Lycian-Pamphylian border. Cornelius Nepos included Cimon in his book of great commanders.\n\n550\n\nFetters, battle of\n\nThe Battle of the Fetters was an engagement between Sparta and Arcadia c. 550, in which the Arcadians defeated the Spartans. According to Herodotus, the Spartans consulted the Delphic Oracle before taking military action. They were told that they would not conquer all of Arcadia but it was possible for Tegea to fall, for the oracle would \"give you Tegea to dance in with stamping feet and her fair plain to measure out the line\".\n\nSee link for more details.\n\n743 - 724\n\nFirst Messenian War\n\nThe First Messenian War was a war between Messenia and Sparta. It began in 743 and ended in 724, according to the dates given by Pausanias. The war continued the rivalry between the Achaeans and the Dorians. Both sides utilized an explosive incident to settle the rivalry by full-scale war. The war was prolonged into 20 years. The result was a Spartan victory. Messenia was depopulated by emigration of the Achaeans to other states. Those who did not emigrate were reduced socially to helots, or serfs. Their descendants were held in hereditary subjection for centuries until the Spartan state finally needed them for defense.\n\n595 - 585\n\nFirst Sacred War\n\nor Cirraean War, was between the Amphictyonic League of Delphi and the city of Kirrha (Cirrha). At the beginning of the 6th century the Pylaeo-Delphic Amphictyony, controlled by the Thessalians, attempted to take hold of the Sacred Land (or Kirrhaean Plain) of Apollo which resulted in this war. The conflict arose due to Kirrha's frequent robbery and mistreatment of pilgrims going to Delphi and their encroachments upon Delphic land. The war, which culminated with the defeat and destruction of Kirrha, is notable for the use of chemical warfare at the Siege of Kirrha, in the form of hellebore being used to poison the city's water supply.\n\n315\n\nGabiene\n\nBattle of Gabiene was the second great battle (the third battle in total; see: the battles of Orkynia and Paraitakene) between Antigonus Monophthalmusand Eumenes, two of Alexander the Great's successors (the so-called Diadochi). The battle was fought near Gabiene in Persia and ended the Second War of the Diadochi. It established Antigonus as the most powerful of the successors. Since the sole reference of this battle is ultimately from Eumenes' personal aide Hieronymus of Cardia (later transmitted through the historian Diodorus), who later switched his allegiance to Antigonus, he provides a unique perspective from both sides' point of view.\n\nOpponents:\n\nAntigonids\n\nEumenes' royalist faction\n\nCommanders and leaders\n\nAntigonus I Monophthalmus, Demetrius I Poliorcetes, Peithon\n\nEumenes, Eudamus, Peucestas, Antigenes, Teutamus\n\nStrength\n\nAntigonus - 22,000 heavy infantry (8,000 Macedonian Phalangites) and an unknown number of light infantry - 9,000 cavalry - 65 elephants\n\nEumenes - 36,700 infantry (both heavy and light) - 6,000 cavalry - 114 elephants\n\nCasualties and losses\n\nAntigonus About 5,000\n\nEumenes - Heavy\n\nAfter the death of Alexander the Great in 323, his generals immediately began squabbling over his empire. Soon it degenerated into open warfare, with each general attempting to claim a portion of Alexander's vast kingdom. One of the most talented generals among the Diadochi was Antigonus Monophthalmus (\"Antigonus the One-eyed\"), so called because of an eye he lost in a siege. During the early years of warfare between the Successors, he faced Eumenes, a capable general who had already crushed Craterus. The two Diadochi fought a series of actions across Asia Minor, and Persia and Media before finally meeting in what was to be the last clash at Gabiene. See the link for an extensive description.\n\n.\n\n331\n\nGaugamela\n\nThe battle of Gaugamela, also called the Battle of Arbela, was the decisive battle of Alexander the Great's invasion of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. In 331 Alexander's army of the Hellenic League met the Persian army of Darius III near Gaugamela, close to the modern city of Dohuk in Iraqi Kurdistan. Though heavily outnumbered, Alexander emerged victorious due to his army's superior tactics and his deft employment of light infantry. It was a decisive victory for the Hellenic League and led to the fall of the Achaemenid Empire.\n\nOpponents:\n\nMacedonia Hellenic League vs. Achaemenid Empire (Persia)\n\nCommanders and leaders:\n\nMacedonians - Alexander the Great, Hephaestion, Craterus, Parmenion, Ptolemy, Perdiccas, Antigonus, Cleitus, Nearchus, Seleucus, Ariston, Simmias, Coenus, Ariston, Glaucias, Sopolis.\n\nPersians - Darius III, Bessus, Mazaeus, Orontes II, Atropates, Ariarathes I.\n\nStrength:\n\nMacedonians 47,000 (See Size of Macedonian army)\n\nPersians: 50,000100,000 (modern estimates) 250,0001,000,000 (ancient sources)\n\nSee the two links for extensive description of the battle.\n\nFor a neat animated map of the battle click here.\n\n332\n\nGaza, siege of\n\nThe Siege of Gaza was a military event in the Egyptian campaign of Alexander the Great in 332 During the Siege of Gaza, Alexander succeeded in reaching the walls by utilizing the engines he had employed against Tyre. After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold was taken by storm.\n\nSee the link for more.\n\n682\n\nGreat Foss\n\nDuring the Second Mesenian War the Spartans continued to try to conquer the Messenains. The Spartans bribed the Arcadians to switch sides during the battle resulting in sever losses to the Messenians. The survivors, led by Aristomenes retreated to mount Eira and defended it for 11 years. At that time the poet, Tyrtaeus, composed the famous songs known to history\n\n195\n\nGythium, siege of\n\nThe Siege of Gythium was fought in 195 between Sparta and the coalition of Rome, Rhodes, the Achaean League, and Pergamum. As the port of Gythium was an important Spartan base, the allies decided to capture it before they advanced inland to Sparta. The Romans and the Achaeans were joined outside the city by the Pergamese and Rhodian fleets.\n\nSee more details at link.\n\n395\n\nHaliartus\n\nThe Battle of Haliartus was between Sparta and Thebes. The Thebans defeated a Spartan force attempting to seize the town of Haliartus, killing the Spartan leader Lysander. The battle marked the start of the Corinthian War,which continued until 387.\n\nSee the links for more details.\n\n334\n\nHalicarnassus, siege of\n\nThe Siege of Halicarnassus was fought between Alexander the Great and the Achaemenid Persian Empire in 334. Alexander, who had no navy, was constantly being threatened by the Persian navy. It continuously attempted to provoke an engagement with Alexander, who would not oblige them. Eventually, the Persian fleet sailed to Halicarnassus, in order to establish a new defense.\n\nSee the link for more detail.\n\n346\n\nHalus, siege of\n\nThe siege of Halus in 346 was carried out as the same time as peace negotiations between Philip II of Macedon and Athens, and may have been part of Philip's wider plan for a campaign in central Greece (Third Sacred War) 358-338 The siege is only known to us through scattered references, mainly in the writings of Demosthenes. Halus was a minor polis in Phthiotis, the area around the head of the Malian Gulf, forty four around the gulf from the pass of Thermopylae. See the link for more.\n\n321\n\nHellespont\n\nThere were many battles IN the Hellespont but this is one with the name. The Battle of the Hellespont took place in 321 between the armies of Craterus and Neoptolemus against Eumenes.\n\nOpponents: Craterus' faction versus Perdiccas' faction among the successors to Alexander the Great\n\nCommanders and leaders:\n\nCraterusand Neoptolemus\n\nEumenes Cavalry, Pharnabazus III, Phoenix of Tenedos\n\nStrength:\n\nCraterus - 20,000\n\nEumenes - 20,000\n\nBattle:\n\nAfter crossing, when Craterus and Eumenes met, each had around 20,000 infantry but Craterus phalanx of veteran Macedonians was superior. Eumenes relied on his more numerous cavalry. Persian cavalry from Asia Minor composed the superior cavalry of Eumenes. Pharnabazus III, the former Persian satrap of Phrygia, was commanding a squadron of cavalry for Eumenes composed principally of Asiatic troops\n\nBoth sides stationed their phalanx in the center and cavalry on the wings. Craterus, commanding the right wing, charged at the onset. The phalanxes engaged and a stiff fight endued. Eumenes being apprehensive of opposing any Macedonians to a general so popular with his countrymen. As soon as they came in sight of the enemy the two commanders charged the army of Craterus, which was unable to withstand the shock, and the aged general himself perished in the confusion. With Craterus slain, his cavalry was scattered. On the other wing, Neoptolemus confronted Eumenes, and in single combat, Neoptolemus was killed. Craterus infantry, by now surrounded and leaderless, surrendered. Eumenes invited the defeated Macedonians to join him. They agreed, but took off by night to rejoin Antipater, the regent of Greece and Macedonia. The Battle of the Hellespont removed two contenders, but the War of the Successors would go on for another 40 years. See BattleHellespont for more details\n\n492\n\nHellorus River\n\nIn the battle of the Helorus River in 493 Hippocrates, tyrant of Gela, defeated the army of Syracuse, but he was unable to capitalise on his victory by capturing the city. Very few details of the battle have survived, and even the date is something of a guess, as the sources for Hippocrates' career don't put events in any clear order. The River Helorus (modern Tellaro) is one of the largest in south-east Sicily, and flows into the sea south of Syracuse. In its lower reaches it is a slow flowing almost stagnant river but further upstream it is more of a mountain stream. The battle is mentioned in passing in one of Pindar's victory odes, (the 9th Nemean Ode, addressed to Chromios son of Agesidamos, a winner at the Pythian Games at Sikyon. Chromios fought at the battle, probably on Hippocrates' side). Pindar places the battle at a ford called the 'Fountain of Ares', in an area where the river had steep cliffs as its banks. This suggests that the battle took place somewhere inland. Other than that we know nothing about the course of the battle other than that a number of prisoners of war were captured by Hippocrates. After the battle Hippocrates moved towards Syracuse and camped in the precincts of the temple of Olympian Zeus. Diodorus has very little on Hippocrates, but he does include a story about his time at the temple. On his arrival Hippocrates found the priests of Zeus attempting to take away the gold dedications in the temple and the gold robe on the statue of Zeus. Hippocrates expelled the priests and ordered them to go back to the city. He then left the temple untouched in an attempt to improve his reputation. Syracuse was saved by the intervention of her mother city of Corinth and fellow Corinthian colony of Corcyra. The two cities intervened, although Herodotus doesn't tell us how (either diplomatically or militarily). Hippocrates agreed to leave Syracuse alone and return the prisoners captured at the Helorus River. In return he was given Camarina, a colony of Syracuse on the River Hipparis, east of Gela.\n\n354-353\n\nHermeum\n\nThe battle of Hermeum (354 or 353) was a Phocian victory over the Boeotians during theThird Sacred War, which followed a brief Phocian intervention in Thessaly in which they inflicted two rare battlefield defeats on Philip II.\n\n480\n\nHimera, siege of\n\nThe siege of Himera in 480 was the first military action of the Carthaginian invasion of Sicily of 480, and was ended by the dramatic Carthaginian defeat at the battle of Himera. The Carthaginian army landed at Parnormus on the northern coast of Sicily. According to the ancient sources the army was 300,000 strong, and was led by one of many Hamilcars to appear in Carthaginian history. After three days of rest Hamilcar led his army east along the coast towards the city of Himera, marching alongside the fleet.\n\n446\n\nHimmera River\n\nThe battle of the Himera River in 446 was a clash between the Greek cities of Syracuse and Akragas, triggered by the return to Sicily of the Sicel leader Ducetius. In 451-450 Ducetius had invaded the territory held by Akragas, and besieged Motyum. He had defeated a combined army from Syracus and Akragas at the battle of Motyum (451 ) but in the following year was defeated at Nomae and forced into exile. In 446 he returned to Sicily to found a new city on the north coast, at Cale Acte, or the 'fair shore' (modern Caronia). This triggered a conflict between Akragas and Syracuse. Akragas accused Syracuse of deliberately allowing Ducetius to return to Sicily. Both sides formed alliances with the other Greek cities of Sicily, and the two armies advanced to the River Himera. In ancient times there were two rivers with that name on Sicily, one that flowed north reaching the sea at the city of Himera and one that flowed south, reaching the coast at Gela, between Akragas and Syracuse. Diodorus doesn't tell us on which of these rivers the battle took place at, but the southern river would make more sense - the northern river is far to the west of Cale Acte and far distant from any route between Akragas and Syracuse. The battle ended as a Syracusan victory. Diodorus tells us that more than a thousand Akragantini were killed in the battle. After the defeat they sent ambassadors to Syracuse, and peace was agreed. Sadly Diodorus doesn't give us any of the peace terms.\n\n480\n\nHimera\n\nThe battle of Himera was a famous victory won by the Greeks of Syracuse over an invading Carthaginian army. The Carthaginians had landed at Panormus, on the northern coast of Sicily. The ancient sources given them 300,000 men under the command of Hamilcar (probably a significant exaggeration). The Carthaginians marched east from Panormus towards the city of Himera. Once there they built two camps - one on the coast to defend their ships and one for the main army. They then defeated the defenders of the city in a battle outside the walls and prepared for a siege. Theron of Akragas, who had recently expelled the tyrant of Himera, was in command of the defence of Himera. He called for help from Gelon, tyrant of Syracuse, who led a force of 50,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry to Himera.\n\nSee the link for more details.\n\n326\n\nHydaspes\n\nAlexander' victory over Porus in northwest India (now Pakistan) that is considered a masterpiece although it also was the battle with the largest casualties of any he fought. -see the two links for details\n\n.\n\n669\n\nHysiae\n\nThe first battle of Hysiae was fought in either 669 or 668 at or near Hysiae, Argolis, during the rule of the Argive tyrant Pheidon. The Argives defeated the Spartans.. Hysiae was a stronghold located in the Peloponnesus to the south-west of Argos and east of Tegea, near the border with Sparta. The battle marked a turning point in military history as it caused the Spartans to adopt the phalanx of hoplites in place of the loose spear-throwing formations prevalent until then. The phalanx was to revolutionize warfare. Conventional warfare during this time period would involve the two armies meeting in an open field. The Argives apparently chose the city of Hysiae for reasons still unknown. By this time, the aspis, a shield designed by the city of Argos, was already in use, giving the Argive army an advantage over the Spartan army.\n\n417\n\nHysiae\n\nThe second battle of Hysiae between the armies of Argos and Sparta took place in 417, during the Peloponnesian War, directly following Sparta's decisive defeat of the Argive/Athenian alliance in the Battle of Mantinea the year before.\n\nThe Spartan kingAgis II invaded Argive territory after a pro-Spartan faction at Argos was evicted by an Athenian force under Alcibiades, whose mission was to establish democracy there. Agis did not manage to take the city of Argos but destroyed the walls that the Argives had begun to extend towards the sea. He then captured and destroyed the town and fortress of Hysiae and had its male population executed. The Spartans did not take Argos, but did capture and destroy the Argive town of Hysiae, taking all the male citizens as hostages. With Hysiae destroyed, the Spartans left a garrison in Orneae and left the territory. In response, Athens dispatched a force of 40 triremes and 1,200 hoplites who fought the Battle of Orneae to remove the garrison and take the city.\n\n426\n\nIdomene\n\nThe Battle of Idomene was a battle in the Peloponnesian War in 426, between the Athenians and the Ambracians. The Ambracians, who were allies of the Spartans, had sent a relief force to help the army that had invaded Amphilochia previously. Unbeknownst to the Ambracians, the first army had been defeated, surrounded and scattered by the allied Athenians, Amphilochians and Acarnanians the day before. The Ambracians, unaware of the incoming Athenian army, camped on the lower of two steep hills. Demosthenes, the Athenian commander, occupied the higher hill, obtaining a strategic advantage. Before dawn, while the Ambracians were still asleep, they were attacked and destroyed by the Athenians. Overall, the Ambraciots lost about 1,000 men over the two battles. Thucydides describes this disaster as: \"The greatest disaster to strike a single city in an equal number of days in this war.\"\n\n301\n\nIpsus\n\nThe Battle of Ipsus was fought between some of the Diadochi (the successors of Alexander the Great) in 301 near the town of Ipsus in Phrygia. Antigonus I Monophthalmus, ruler of Phrygia, and his son Demetrius I of Macedon were pitted against the coalition of three other companions of Alexander: Cassander, ruler of Macedon; Lysimachus, ruler of Thrace; and Seleucus I Nicator, ruler of Babylonia and Persia.\n\nKingdoms of the Diadochi after the battle of Ipsus, c. 301.\n\nKingdom of Seleucus\n\nOther Diadochi\n\nKingdom of Cassander\n\nKingdom of Lysimachus\n\nKingdom of Ptolemy Epirus\n\nFrom the wreck of the Antigonid army, Demetrius managed to recover 5,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, and escaped with them to Ephesos.\n\nSee the link for much more detail.\n\n333\n\nIssus\n\nThe Battle of Issus (also Issos) occurred in southern Anatolia, on November 5, 333 between the Hellenic League led by Alexander the Great and the Achaemenid Empire, led by Darius III, in the second great battle of Alexander's conquest of Asia.

He gathered reinforcements and led his men in a surprise march behind the Hellenic advance to cut their line of supply. This forced Alexander to countermarch, setting the stage for the battle near the mouth of the Pinarus River and the town of Issus.\n\nSee the links for details.\n\nFor a neat animated map of the battle click here .\n\n724\n\nIthome\n\nThe battle was in the First Messenian War and was an effort of the Spartans to conquer the adjacent fertile plain and enslave the inhabitants. But King Theopompus failed twice as the Messenians retreated to their mountain town. The Messian king was killed but was replaced by Aristodemus who then was victorious. The war lasted for 20 years.\n\n329\n\nJaxartes\n\nIn the Battle of Jaxartes Alexander the Great and his Macedonian army defeated the Saka nomads at the River Jaxartes, now known as the Syr Darya River. The site of the battle straddles the modern borders of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, just south-west of the ancient city of Tashkent (the modern capital of Uzbekistan) and north-east of Khujand (a city in Tajikistan). See the links for details.\n\n497\n\nLabraunda\n\nThis battle was the second of three battles between the Persians and Carian rebels during the Ionian Revolt, and was a second costly defeat for the Carians. Caria had joined the Ionian revolt in the aftermath of the Ionian raid on Sardis in 499. Their revolt disrupted the first Persian counterattack of the war, led by three sons-in-law of Darius I.\n\n.\n\n494\n\nLade\n\nThe naval battle of Lade took place during the Ionian Revolt. It was fought between an alliance of the Ionian cities (joined by the Lesbians) and the Persian Empire of Darius the Great, and resulted in a decisive victory for the Persians which all but ended the revolt.\n\nThe Ionian Revolt was triggered by the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them. In 499, the then-tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos, in an attempt to bolster his position in Miletus. The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great. Initially, in 498, the Ionians went on the offensive, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, capturing Sardis, before suffering defeat at the Battle of Ephesus. The revolt then spread to Caria and Cyprus. Three years of Persian campaigning across Asia Minor followed, with no decisive effect. By 494 the Persian army and navy had regrouped, and made straight for the epicenter of the rebellion at Miletus. The Ionians sought to defend Miletus by sea, leaving the defense of Miletus to the Milesians. The Ionian fleet gathered at the island of Lade, off the coast of Miletus.\n\nSee the links for much more detail:\n\n201\n\nLade\n\nThis battle of Lade was the second of two naval battles fought by Philip V of Macedonia during 201. Philip had begun to construct a war fleet during the First Macedonian War against Rome, but the fleet was not completed until after the end of the war in 205. Once the fleet was ready, in 202, Philip went onto the offensive, attacking a series of independent cities around the Aegean. Rhodes and Attalus of Pergamum were both directly threatened by Philips actions, and were soon drawn into a war against him. The exact order of events during 201 is unclear. Philip was active in Asia Minor, at some point attacking the city of Pergamum. One of his targets during this period was the island of Chios, sixty miles to the south west of Pergamum. A large naval battle followed (battle of Chios) in which the Rhodians were successful, but Attalus was defeated, leaving Philip free to complete the conquest of Chios. In the aftermath of this battle Attalus returned to Pergamum, while the Rhodian fleet moved south, taking up a new position at Lade, off Miletus. Philip followed the Rhodians, and attacked them at Lade. The losses he had suffered at Chios meant that the Macedonian fleet was not powerful enough to inflict a crushing defeat on the Rhodian fleet, but he still won a victory. The Rhodian fleet then retreated further south, while Philip returned to his campaign in Asia Minor.\n\n332\n\nLamia, siege of\n\nThe Siege of Lamia occurred in 322 between the Macedonians led by Antipater and a coalition of armies mostly from central Greece led by Leosthenes. After Antipater was defeated at the Battle of Thermopylae he shut himself in the city of Lamia.Leosthenes approached the city and with his army fortified a camp, dug up a deep ditch and constructed a palisade.\n\n209\n\nLamia\n\nThe Second Battle of Lamia was fought in 209 between the forces of Philip V of Macedon and Pyrrhias, a general of the Aetolian League. Pyrrhias was once again aided by Pergamene forces and Roman advisors but again he was defeated. His side suffered heavy casualties.\n\nSee the link.\n\n423- 422\n\nLaodocium\n\nThe battle of Laodocium in 423 or 422 was between two Peloponnesian cities, fought during a brief armistice between Athens and Sparta during Peloponnesian War). The battle was fought between the armies of Tegea, in the centre of the Peloponnese, and Mantinea, in the north-east of the Peloponnese. In the wider conflict Tegea was an ally of Sparta, while Mantinea had fought alongside Sparta earlier in the war, but then sided with Athens. The battle was fought at Laodocium, in the territory of Orestheum. This was close to the site of the city of Megalopolis, founded in 371 as a counter-weight to Sparta, and located to the south-west of both Tegea and Mantinea. Thucydides describes it as happening in the winter of the ninth year of the war, placing it in the winter of 423-2. The battle itself was inconclusive. Each army was victorious on one wing and defeated on the other, and both sides erected a trophy to celebrate their victory. The Tegeans remained on the battlefield overnight, suggesting that they had had the best of the fighting, while the Mantineans retreated to Bucolion before erecting their trophy. Both sides suffered heavy losses during the fighting.\n\n391\n\nLechaeum\n\nThe battle of Lechaeum in 391 was an Athenian victory in the Corinthian War. In the battle, the Athenian general Iphicrates took advantage of the fact that a Spartan hoplite regiment operating near Corinth was moving in the open without the protection of any missile throwing troops. He decided to ambush it with his force of javelin throwers, or peltasts. By launching repeated hit-and-run attacks against the Spartan formation, Iphicrates and his men were able to wear the Spartans down, eventually routing them and killing just under half. This marked one of the first occasions in Greek military history on which a force of peltasts had defeated a force of hoplites (heavy infantry).\n\nHe decided to ambush it with his force of javelin throwers, or peltasts.

This marked one of the first occasions in Greek military history on which a force of peltasts had defeated a force of hoplites (heavy infantry).\n\nBackground:\n\nIn 392, a civil war had taken place at Corinth, in which a group of pro-Spartan oligarchs was defeated and exiled by anti-Spartan democrats. Those exiles cooperated with Spartan forces in the region to gain control of Corinth's port on the Corinthian Gulf, Lechaeum. They then repulsed several attacks on the port by the democrats at Corinth and their Theban and Argive allies and secured their hold over the port. The Athenians then sent out a force to assist in garrisoning Corinth, with Iphicrates commanding the peltasts. The Spartans and the exiles, meanwhile, raided Corinthian territory from Lechaeum, and in 391 King Agesilaus led a large Spartan army to the area and attacked a number of strongpoints, winning a number of successes. The Athenians and their allies were largely bottled up in Corinth, but eventually found an opportunity to take advantage of Spartan negligence.\n\nBattle:\n\nWhile Agesilaus moved about Corinthian territory with the bulk of his army, he left a sizable force at Lechaeum to guard the port. Part of this force at Lechaeum was composed of men from the city of Amyclae, who traditionally returned home for a certain religious festival when on campaign. With this festival approaching, the Spartan commander at Lechaeum marched out with a force of hoplites and cavalry to escort the Amyclaeans past Corinth on their way home. After successfully leading his force well past the city, the commander ordered his hoplites to turn and return to Lechaeum, while the cavalry continued on with the Amyclaeans. Although he would be marching near the walls of the city of Corinth with his force, he expected no trouble, believing that the men in the city were thoroughly cowed and unwilling to march out. The Athenian commanders in Corinth, Iphicrates, who commanded the peltasts, and Callias, who commanded the hoplites, saw that an entire Spartan mora, or regiment, of 600 men was marching past the city unprotected by either peltasts or cavalry, and decided to take advantage of this fact. Accordingly, the Athenian hoplites drew up a little outside Corinth, while the peltasts went after the Spartan force in pursuit, flinging javelins at the Spartan hoplites. To stop this, the Spartan commander ordered some of his men to charge the Athenians, but the peltasts fell back, easily outrunning the hoplites, and then, when the Spartans turned to return to the regiment, the peltasts fell upon them, flinging spears at them as they fled, and inflicted casualties. This process was repeated several times, with similar results. Even when a group of Spartan cavalrymen arrived, the Spartan commander made the curious decision that they should keep pace with the hoplites in pursuit, instead of racing ahead to ride down the fleeing peltasts. Unable to drive off the peltasts, and suffering losses all the while, the Spartans were driven back to a hilltop overlooking Lechaeum. The men in Lechaeum, seeing their predicament, sailed out in small boats to as close as to the hill as they could reach, about a half mile away. The Athenians, meanwhile, began to bring up their hoplites, and the Spartans, seeing these two developments, broke and ran for the boats, pursued by the peltasts all the way. All in all, in the fighting and pursuit, 250 of the 600 men in the regiment were killed. News of the Spartan defeat, accordingly, was a profound shock to Agesilaus, who soon returned home to Sparta. In the months following Agesilaus' departure, Iphicrates reversed many of the gains that the Spartans had made near Corinth, recapturing three of the forts that the Spartans had previously seized and garrisoned. He also launched several successful raids against Spartan allies in the region. Although the Spartans and their oligarchic allies continued to hold Lechaeum for"
