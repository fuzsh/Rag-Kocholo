        "text": "The Battle of Spartolos took place in 429 between Athens and the Chalcidian League and their allies, in the early part of the Peloponnesian War. The Athenians under Xenophon marched into Thrace to attack Spartolos. They destroyed the crops outside the city and began negotiating with pro-Athenian factions in Chalcidice, but the anti-Athenian factions asked for help from Olynthus. An army from Chalcidice, Spartolos, and Olynthus met the Athenians in battle, but their hoplites were defeated and they retreated to Spartolos; their cavalry and peltasts (light infantry armed with javelins), however, gained the advantage over the Athenian troops. Reinforcements soon arrived from Olynthus, and they launched a second attack on the Athenians. The Athenian hoplites could not come to grips with the enemy light troops or horsemen. Eventually the Athenians panicked and were routed, with all of their generals and 430 other men killed. In the Athenian tribute list of 429/8 the only cities of Chalcidice are: Mende, Aphytis, Scione, Stageira and Acanthus (Athos). Acanthus and Mende had not even joined the Chalcidian League.\n\nOpponents:\n\nAthens versus Chalcidice, Spartolos, Olynthus\n\nCommanders and leaders\n\nAthens - Xenophon\n\nOthers - Unknown\n\nStrength:\n\nAthens - 4,000 total\n\nAllies - 5,000 infantry, 400 cavalry\n\nCasualties and losses:\n\nAthens - Over 430\n\nOthers - no more than 315\n\nEarly Stage of Battle:\n\nWhen the phalanxes of the Chalcidians clashed with those of the Athenians, it was clear that the Athenians had a great advantage. The local Chalcidian hoplites made up the centre and right hand portions of the army while hired Peloponnesian forces made up the left side. The locals on the Chalcidian side gave way first, forcing the mercenaries to fall back as well. This left the Chalcidian army worn and strained, and the battle looked very promising for the Athenians. Later Stage of Battle After the Chalcidian side was worn down by the Athenians, the Chalcidians were reinforced by troops sent from Olynthus. With the help of the troops from Olynthus, the Chalcidians rallied back against the Athenians much stronger than before. They had learned that the Athenians did not have the experience or equipment to defend against large numbers of javelins, so when they came back strengthened by their allies and with a new tactic, the Chalcidians forced the Athenians to retreat. As the Athenians retreated, Chalcidian cavalry and light infantry chased down the Athenians to inflict further damage upon them. The Athenians tried multiple counter-attacks to defend themselves from further harm, but each time the Chalcidians were able to evade the attacks. The back ranks of Athenian troops began to abandon those at the front, allowing them to be overwhelmed, surrounded, and killed, including their general, Xenophon.\n\nAftermath:\n\nBetween a fifth and a fourth of the Athenian troops were killed in this battle- twice as much as was expected prior to the battle. This brutal defeat showed Athens what would be required of them to win the war.\n\nThe battle of Spartolus of 429 was a costly Athenian defeat in a battle fought just outside the city of Spartolus in Chalcidice. Spartolus is in the western part of the Chalcidice peninsula, a short distance to the north-west of Potidaia. Early in the Great Peloponnesian War most of Chalcidice had revolted against Athenian control. The Chalcidians had abandoned many of their coastal communities and had adopted a new capital at Olynthus, about an equal distance to the north-east of Potidaia. The city of Potidaia itself was originally part of the Athenian Empire, but at the start of the war it too rose in revolt and was the target of a lengthy siege that only ended during the winter of 430/29. In the summer of 429 an Athenian army of 2,000 hoplites and 200 cavalry, under the command of Xenophon son of Euripides, invaded Chalcidice and marched up to Spartolus. The city was defended by a force of hoplites and auxiliary troops that had been summoned from Olynthus, as well as some peltasts (light infantry) from Chusis, the area to the north-west of the city, and some light troops from Spartolus. When the Athenians arrived outside the city the defenders sallied out to meet them. The Athenian hoplites defeated the hoplites and auxiliaries from Olynthus, who were forced to retreat back into the city. Elsewhere the local cavalry and light troops defeated their Athenian equivalents, but this first phase of the battle ended with the Athenians still holding their ground close to the city. According to Thucydides more peltasts arrived from Olynthus just after the end of this first engagement. Encouraged by the arrival of the new troops the light troops from Spartolus launched a new attack on the Athenians. The Athenians close to the city were forced to retreat back towards the troops who had been left to guard their baggage. The resulting battle demonstrated one potential weakness of a hoplite army. Every time the Athenian hoplites attempted to charge their opponents the lighter peltasts melted away, and the moment the Athenians began to retreat they were subjected to a hail of javelins, as well as repeated cavalry charges. Eventually the Athenian formations broke, and the survivors fled in some disorder back to Potidaea. The Athenians suffered very heavily casualties during this battle, with 430 men and all of the generals killed."
