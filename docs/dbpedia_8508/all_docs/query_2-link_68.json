        "text": "The punk scenes in the United States and the United Kingdom were defined by their performers. They are some of the most iconic musicians — sometimes in the loosest sense of the word — in the history of entertainment. Whether it's the outlandish lifestyles, disturbing behavior on and off the stage, or a unique sense of fashion, punk's characters are hard to forget. Here's a look at 25 of the scene's most interesting characters.\n\nThere was no truer punk personality than GG Allin, who might have been the most dangerous musician on the planet. Beginning in the late 1970s until his death from an accidental heroin overdose in 1993, Allin took shock rock to the extreme. From defecating on stage to fighting with fans, Allin was both disgusting and enthralling while performing with several obscure underground and hardcore punk bands.\n\nThe leader of a band who opened the door for the pop-punk takeover of the mid-to-late 1990s, Billie Joe Armstrong has grown from an immature Green Day frontman to a multimillionaire businessman. He's battled substance abuse, unleashed vocal tirades on stage, and flung mud with the crowd at Woodstock '99. Never violent, Armstrong's persona is like your goofball suburban neighbor.\n\nStiv Bators' career, most notably with the Dead Boys, was not as celebrated as that of other punk pioneers, but he helped usher in the early days of the genre at New York City's famed CBGB. Known for his antics on stage, Bators was officially dead for a bit following a hanging stunt while fronting The Lords of the New Church in the early 1980s. Sadly, he died from a brain injury suffered after reportedly being hit by an automobile in Paris in June 1990.\n\nMany credit the former Dead Kennedys singer as the most influential figure on the hardcore punk scene. From his politically charged lyrics to his agitating persona, Jello Biafra has never shied away from anything and continues to challenge the system via spoken word. This is a guy who also ran for mayor of San Francisco in the late '70s and survived the PMRC.\n\nMost Gen Xers know Glenn Danzig from his solo work in the late 1980s and into the 1990s. But before \"Mother 93\" became an MTV staple, the chiseled Danzig led the underappreciated punk outfit the Misfits. If the Misfits were a film, it would be a horror B-movie with a cult following. Danzig was in the forefront with his makeup, bulging biceps, and baritone voice.\n\nHe was born Paul Hudson but was better known as H.R. (Human Rights), and he was the lead singer of Bad Brains, one of the early groups on the hardcore punk scene. Bad Brains concerts were an experience, by all accounts, with H.R. the focal point. His unique, diverse vocal stylings were on display within the frame of this often complex individual.\n\nThe original Riot Grrrl, Kathleen Hanna helped bring commercial feminism to young punk rock girls looking for an outlet. Her band Bikini Kill led the neo-feminist punk movement of the 1990s, with Hanna as its poster girl. While still performing, Hanna also remains a prominent activist and writer. She's been married to the Beastie Boys' Adam \"Ad-Rock\" Horovitz since 2006.\n\nThe Rock & Roll Hall of Famer started as a folk singer and made her money on the new wave scene with Blondie, But make no mistake: Debbie Harry was, and still is, a true punk. Part of the regulars at CBGB, Harry had the looks of a model and the attitude to hang with even the raunchiest boys on the punk scene. An icon in the true sense of the word.\n\nWhile The Runaways were a true rock band, and her backing group the Blackhearts were early pop-rock regulars on MTV, Joan Jett certainly harbors punk tendencies. This can be seen mostly in her attitude and confidence as a modern-day Riot Grrrl. She always felt she could hang musically with the boys — and proved it. The Hall of Famer remains a feminist champion, philanthropist, activist, and multimedia entertainer while still owning that \"Bad Reputation.\"\n\nJerry Only is often overshadowed by Misfits bandmate Glenn Danzig, but the punk band's status as a cult favorite wasn't done by one man. He has kept the group's legacy as the only consistent member and still sports the macabre makeup and hair on stage. He had a brief foray into the world of professional wrestling and reportedly was with Sid Vicious the night he died.\n\nWhat's perhaps most impressive about the often dubbed \"Godfather of Punk\" is that Iggy Pop's abs are still as tight today in his 70s as they were back in the 1960s. While fronting his Hall of Fame band the Stooges, it was common for Pop to cut or expose himself on stage. It's strange to see him wearing shirts, and more than a few people think he's the father of fellow shirtless frontman Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nAny follower of punk can still hear Dee Dee Ramone's famed, blistering \"1-2-3-4\" count-off before each Ramones song. Originally the band's singer, Dee Dee (born Douglas Colvin), stuck to the bass and was one of the band's most prolific songwriters. However, heroin consumed his life and ultimately claimed it from an overdose in June 2002.\n\nThe look: 6-foot-6, rail thin, pale, ripped jeans, black curly hair, leather jacket, and sunglasses. Joey Ramone was, and probably still is, the most recognizable icon of the punk genre in the United States. He was also perhaps the most beloved. Born Jeffrey Hyman, the late Ramones frontman has a street named after him in New York City and has been paid tribute to in countless songs before and after his death in 2001 from lymphoma.\n\nThough just as revered as Dee Dee and Joey for his work with the Ramones, Johnny Ramone (born John Cummings) was usually stoic and all business on stage. Off it, he was a staunch conservative and had a strained relationship with Joey Ramone up to the singer's 2001 death due to the infamous love triangle that also included the woman who would become Johnny's wife. One of punk's most powerful guitarists, Johnny died from prostate cancer in 2004.\n\nLou Reed's relationship with punk is more indirect than most. His work with the Velvet Underground related more to what would be known as alternative, proto-punk, and new wave, but his overall musical offerings still had elements of that raw punk sound. What Reed certainly had was the punk attitude, though, in a more \"Rebel Without a Cause\" way: the sunglasses, the disdain for authority, and his openness regarding addiction.\n\nFrom his straight-edge roots with Black Flag to mainstream success via the Rollins Band to his current prominence over all mediums, Henry Rollins might be the most mature and educated punk on the planet. Whether barking and screeching through his music or preaching as a public speaker, Rollins remains a captivating character. He's also not afraid to poke fun at himself.\n\nPerhaps nobody fits the stereotypical description of punk, from an attitude and fashion standpoint, more than John Lydon, a.k.a. Johnny Rotten. He was the main face of the Sex Pistols, an agitator and troublemaker, but a trendsetter who played the part of a punk to perfection. Rotten seemed to know what he was doing all along, and he remains one of the most recognizable entertainers and celebrities today. Remember: He's not an anarchist; he only plays one on TV.\n\nBefore fronting alternative favorites Siouxsie and the Banshees, Siouxsie Sioux lived the punk lifestyle as a devoted follower of the Sex Pistols. She challenged authority at an early age and was part of the Sex Pistols' infamous 1976 appearance on Bill Grundy's famed British talk show. She's still going strong today with that same punk attitude and trendy fashion awareness, though in a more grown-up way.\n\nOften called the \"Godmother of Punk,\" Patti Smith provided a poet's approach to the genre. She had the attitude to feel at home within the punk movement in New York City but the talent to become a major influence on musicians across all genres. In fact, her greatest characteristic remains her confidence in her work and herself.\n\nUp there with Johnny Rotten, Joe Strummer provided the other prominent face of British punk rock in the last 1970s. Strummer and The Clash had longevity despite the band's own various levels of dysfunction. A musical and lyrical punk trendsetter, Strummer was not afraid to mix it up with fans. He was a dominating, sometimes combustible personality within his own band. Strummer died at 50 from a heart defect that was not diagnosed, leaving a legacy that's as strong as ever.\n\nBefore Kathleen Hanna, Poly Styrene carried the torch for feminist punks in the late 1970s — first, as the lead singer of X-Ray Spex, then during her solo career. Styrene wore brightly colored clothes and sported braces on her teeth. Her wail could be piercing, but it offered some impressive range that would blow away her male counterparts. Styrene was still active until her 2011 death from breast cancer at 53 years old.\n\nDavid Johansen might have been the more recognizable member of the New York Dolls, but Johnny Thunders arguably is the most influential. While Johansen has enjoyed some modest pop and acting success, Thunders stayed true to his punk roots with The Heartbreakers (not Tom Petty's band). His riffs remained dirty and raw, just like the early days of the Dolls. Thunders' 1991 apparent drug-related death at age 38 remains a mystery.\n\nThough the Sex Pistols are credited with initiating the punk scene in the U.K., David Vanian and The Damned were actually the first such band from across the pond to cut a single. Influenced by art and horror films, Vanian conveyed those influences through music and his own persona within The Damned. Vanian is also known for being extremely private. A somewhat punk characteristic for a punk.\n\nAccording to punk lore, Sid Vicious was in the running to front The Damned. Circumstances surrounding him not getting the gig created Vicious' disdain for the group and singer David Vanian. Vicious even tried to attack the band at one point during a show. That was just one example of Vicious' off-the-rails behavior — usually fueled by drugs. Of course, there was his involvement in the 1978 death of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. Vicious died from a heroin overdose shortly after while out on bail at age 21.\n\nA former sex show performer, Wendy O. Williams became queen of the underground punk scene in New York City. She was loud, brash, and utterly inappropriate. Her band, The Plasmatics, was never really known for its music but for Williams' stage antics, though she was nominated for a Grammy in 1985. Usually half-naked on stage, Williams would smash TVs with a sledgehammer, chainsaw guitars, and blow up the occasional automobile. Williams fatally shot herself in April 1998 at age 48."
