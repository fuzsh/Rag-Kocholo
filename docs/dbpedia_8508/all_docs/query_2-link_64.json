        "text": "Officially licensed GG Allin band merchandise!\n\n\"GG\" Allin (born Jesus Christ Allin; August 29, 1956 – June 28, 1993) was an American punk rock singer-songwriter who performed and recorded with many groups during his career.\n\nAllin's lyrics, which often included misogyny, racism, social apathy, child abuse, incest, rape and homophobia, deeply divided opinions of him within the highly politicized punk community. He is best remembered for his notorious live performances that typically featured wildly transgressive acts. Some of these acts included Allin defecating and urinating onstage, rolling in feces and often consuming excrement, committing self-injury, performing naked, taunting people to perform fellatio on him and committing violent actions toward the audience. Although more notorious for his stage antics than for his wide body of music, he recorded prolifically, not only in the punk rock genre, but also in spoken word, country and Rolling Stones-influenced rock. Though he had a devoted cult following, Allin's music has received mostly negative reviews from critics."
