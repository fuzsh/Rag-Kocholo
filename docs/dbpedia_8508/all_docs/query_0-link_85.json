        "text": "flexible friends and dis-critique\n\nContinuing our look at the entire vinyl output of ACTIVE MINDS in chronological order. Bobs (guitar/vocals) kindly answers my questions. If you missed Part One and would like to catch up, you can find it here\n\nACTIVE MINDS – BEHIND THE MASK EP (Loony Tunes/Fobia Meduros Sentimientos – Spain) 1993\n\nReligion is part of the process of disempowerment which is designed to keep us in our place – obeying rules which cannot be justified by reasoning, and which must therefore be blindly accepted. Well I won’t accept it. I won’t allow my life to be controlled by their irrational superstitions and their repression of freedom. I will challenge their values whenever they rear their ugly heads. I am not a sheep. I will not follow.\n\nexcerpt from sleeve notes to Atheist Anthem\n\nFollowing on from the impressive heft of the Capitalism Is A Disease… EP in 1991, the most notable aspect of Behind The Mask is unfortunately it’s poor sound. AM releases have never been graced with slick production, but for me that’s part of their charm. On the five tracks showcased here though, it’s like listening to a band’s muddy bedroom cassette recording. I asked Bobs where it was recorded, who by and why it turned out the way it did:\n\nBobs: It was recorded at Gladiator/Trinity again, although not by Pete Jackson this time (can’t remember why, and I can’t remember the name of the guy who did record it). We weren’t really happy with the production at the time – it may have been because we were working with an unfamiliar engineer. Yes, perhaps “muddy” is the right description. We felt that there was too much mid-range in the mix, which took some of the edge off it. We actually went to attend the cut of the record (a 12 hour round trip!) for the first, and only, time to try to correct it a bit. We wanted it to be re-EQ’d, with a bit of boost of the bass and treble frequencies. However, after doing that, when we got the test pressings back they were terrible. Although we’d been there in the room when the cut was done, when we’d asked the cutting engineer to boost the bass and treble frequencies, he obviously hadn’t kept an eye on the overall volume levels. The result was that far too much volume had gone through the cutting needle, resulting in the whole thing become far too distorted. Some people may think that you can never have too much distortion, but you certainly can – distorted drums, for example, sound absolutely shit. So we had no choice but to scrap the test pressings, and get the record re-cut just from the original (less than ideal) mix.\n\nThis is a shame as the six-minute opener (Dead From The Neck Up) is a real stand-out moment: ponderously-paced, menacing and with effective use of feedback. Lyrically, it tackles the systems’ remorseless attempts to force square pegs into round hole normality, with all its attendant mindless consumerism.\n\nThey are pretty bruising in their criticism of people who walk the path well travelled: ‘Fuckwit – learn it – live it – Fuck normality’. Protest punk songs, arguably reaching a zenith with CRASS‘ lyrics, did have a habit of referring to ‘normal society’ in derogatory terms. Fair enough, it’s punk, right? With the luxury of hindsight though and with age and life experience giving them the opportunity to see things from different angles, I wondered if the band had any regrets regarding the lyrics to the song:\n\nBobs: well, we all mellow a bit over time, and the way you express things in your 20’s is unlikely to be the same as you would in your 50’s. I guess the “fuckwit” line in the chorus is a bit blunt, but I think that the sentiment expressed in the lyrics and the accompanying explanation are still sound. They’re challenging the blind acceptance of social norms and aspirations, and of people who have no imagination about what to do with their lives. The way it’s screamed in the chorus is probably a bit “attention grabbing” for it’s own sake, but on the whole, it’s not a lyric that I’m uncomfortable with.\n\nVery Bad Brains takes to task the punk scene’s tolerance of early 80’s US hardcore band BAD BRAINS‘ Rastafarian-inspired homophobia. Beginning with a cheeky bit of sampled reggae from BB’s I Luv I Jah (thanks Bobs) followed by that bands’ blazing Pay To Cum riff, it soon careers into scorching one-minute thrash territory. I love this track, from it’s stolen riff, through the blazing thrash to the righteous sentiment. I asked Bobs what kind of reaction they received to the song, positive or negative:\n\nTo be honest, I can’t remember that we ever did. I think it was quite a big issue at the time in the scene – there certainly wasn’t just us saying it (about the Bad Brains, I mean). I don’t think it was just the fact that the Bad Brains were considered to be hardcore legends – I think it was also felt that their attitudes stemmed from their religious culture, and that many people were wary of being disrespectful of that. But to me, that doesn’t make any sense. If somebody’s religious or cultural beliefs includes an intolerance for others, then calling that out is not a sign of your own intolerance.\n\nA Step Further speaks about the importance of using targeted direct action to keep local communities onside as opposed to chucking a brick through a butchers shop window, a practice prevalent among many in the animal rights groups of the ’80s and early ’90s.\n\nIs Mankind Gonna Abolish War? is an interesting one. A recycled SAS song, originally on the Sing Along Songs cassette (1983) by their pre-ACTIVE MINDS band, the lyrics haven’t been updated from talk of the ‘Soviet threat’ but, as explained in the sleeve notes, post the breakup of the Eastern Bloc, the relevance is still there. Conflict in Yugoslavia and the 1991 Gulf War are cited as examples of instability, potentially involving more nuclear powers.\n\nFinally we have Atheist Anthem. I guess it wouldn’t be an ACTIVE MINDS record without a song giving religion a pasting. “why do I hate religion so much? Because it hates me!” state the lyric notes, going on to describe how religion can only function when people give up their individuality and blindly follow without question. The ghost of CRASS’ Reality Asylum haunts these words and it’s powerful stuff, though presented within a manic punk work-out rather than the disturbing avante-garde style of that bands’ debut. Given that criticism of all religion is a theme throughout the bands’ work, I thought this would be a good time to ask Bobs to explain why: had he or Set had a particularly religious upbringing or was their criticism based on the obvious? That is, a punk tradition of questioning a concept rooted in blind faith and control:\n\nNo, we didn’t have a religious upbringing, so the anti-religion theme on our songs is not a reaction to restrictions or brainwashing that was forced on us in childhood. So I guess there’s no reason for our focus on this, other than, as you say, the obvious. As with most people, we were expected to pray and sing hymns in school, and I think that from a pretty early age I took exception to that – to the fact that I was expected to say things (and presumably accept them) which I didn’t believe in or agree with.\n\nWhich leads us to the stark but crude sleeve art, created by an artist apparently still finding his feet:\n\nBobs: The fold-out poster was drawn by Patrick Burke – an early one of his works. I adapted parts of the main poster to produce the front and back sleeve. He’s still doing artwork – he did the last couple of Satanic Malfunctions sleeves, and also produces fine art to sell. His latest stuff is pretty awesome. You can check it out here:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PatrickBurkeArtworks\n\nThe centre label of the record has the message ‘CD’s? NO THANKS!’ and included in the original pressing is an essay detailing their stance on said product, though I don’t have one in my copy. At the time of this release, CD’s had been absorbed into the mainstream and, despite initial resistance, were making inroads into the DIY punk scene. AM stood firm against them for years, pretty much the last outpost of defiance. They refused to compromise, until 2008 when they worked with Active Distribution to release a CD version of their It’s Perfectly Obvious That This System Doesn’t Work LP – or so I thought:\n\nBobs: This is a good example of why you should probably never say “never” about anything in life – time moves on, and the world and circumstances change in ways that you can’t always envision. At 53 years of age, I can now recognise that far better than I could when that EP came out and I was 26 years old. Back then, CD’s were being marketed in a way that encouraged people to simply re-buy all the music they already had, but in a new and more expensive format (they were more expensive than vinyl back then). Shops were stopping selling vinyl – including independent shops, who had limited floorspace and didn’t always have the luxury of stocking releases in multiple formats. In addition, Philips held the patent for CD’s, so it was questionable as to whether or not any CD release could be considered truly independent.\n\nBut, within a few years, a lot of these arguments became redundant. When we wrote that, there was no such thing as the internet in the way we know it today. We didn’t know that within a few years, the ability to burn off your own CD’s would be something that many people would have in their homes through their own personal computers. The patent that Philips held over CD’s ran out early in the new millenium, and whilst that no doubt seemed a long way off in 1993, looking back now it seems just a very short period of time between us writing that leaflet and the circumstances being vastly different. “Behind The Mask” came out just a couple of months after my son was born. By the time he became a teenager we were living in a different world, and arguments to kids just starting to get into music about buying vinyl rather than CD’s were nonsense – CD’s were accessible, and they could easily burn copies and share them with their mates. They were also pretty cheap by then. Vinyl was a format that was only favoured by a different generation, and if you want to stay relevant in what you’re doing then there’s no point in only targetting your music at a clique of old-time friends.\n\nWe’d never wanted to limited our audience just to people of our own age, so we discarded our preconceptions about the format music needed to be made available on. Still, by the time we released anything on CD (2006 – a compilation for a tour of Mexico), many people in the UK and Europe were already moving away from buying actual CD’s – either to buying vinyl again (because of the collectability) or just accessing stuff on the net to download or stream. I’ve always preferred vinyl personally – particularly for the opportunities it gives for creative and interesting artwork. But buying vinyl is expensive these days, and is becoming more and more geared to a collectors’ market – something which we don’t really want to engage with in that way. For that reason, we now make our stuff available to download and stream – including on the mainstream services like Spotify, which I consider to be the modern-day equivalent of trying to get your stuff distributed into major record shops by the Cartel. If you want a younger audience to engage with you, you shouldn’t make it difficult for them to do so by hiding yourself away in obscure places. More than 50% of our current listeners on Spotify weren’t even born when we started out.”\n\nBehind The Mask isn’t the band’s finest hour, ostensibly due to the wreckage of a mix. There are, however, some great tracks on here which would be worth a re-record some day. Coupled with the usual food for thought in the lyrics and notes, it’s well worth picking up and is still available for just a pound. Here’s how Bobs feels about it twenty-seven years later:\n\nTo be honest, I’m pretty much sick of the sight of it! We still have a few copies of it left to sell from the last 1,000 pressed (which must have been more than 15 years ago now), and it’s the oldest one of our releases which we still have in stock. And, as I’ve suggested, even at the time we weren’t entirely happy with the sound of it, although it has some decent songs on it. We often played Atheist Anthem for many years at gigs, and Dead From the Neck Up doesn’t particularly sound like anything else we’ve done. I guess it was quite influenced by some of the “grunge” stuff around at the time – maybe HELMET, or someone like that. That used to be quite a good song to end gigs with, which we did sporadically for quite a while. Listening back to the studio recording of that one does remind me of some endings to gigs where we’d end up making a chaotic, distorted racket with me “playing” guitar with one of Set’s drumsticks and ending with prolonged feedback. It could be quite a dramatic ending…\n\n5,500 copies pressed altogether – initially 3,500, and then 3 further re-pressings.\n\nTHE LUNATICS HAVE TAKEN OVER THE ASYLUM flexi-disc (Loony Tunes – UK, React – France, Per Koro – Germany, Nikt Nic Nie Wie – Poland, Grinding Madness – Belgium, Fobia Duros Sentimientos – Spain, DIY Records – Japan, F.J.A. – Brazil, Resistance Productions – Switzerland) 1994\n\nThe world is a lunatic asylum – enter at your own risk. Greed and stupidity are all that seem to exist. They say that ignorance is bliss, and that certainly seems to fit – why else would people be satisfied with living in shit?\n\nAsylum lyrics\n\nThe 90’s were certainly a prolific time for the band and they had this release out within a year of Behind The Mask. Having hit their stride they made good use of, as well as helping to build, a well connected international DIY punk scene. Their label Loony Tunes collaborated with 8 other labels from around the world to bring this beautifully raw, no frills five track flexi-disc. I thought I’d start by asking Bobs if this was their first such collaboration, how challenging it was pre-internet and whether or not it increased their following world-wide:\n\nWith Behind The Mask we’d collaborated with a Spanish label (Fobia Duros Sentimientos), but the flexi was far more complex, with 8 other labels in 8 different countries being involved. We also had the lyrics and explanations translated into 6 other languages for the record inserts. Yes, I guess it was a challenge – and more so in those days than it would be now, but obviously you didn’t think about that. It was just the way things were, and the internet was way out of anybody’s imagination. Fixing up foreign tours was similar – everything done by mail, and coming up with a co-ordinated tour schedule required a lot of forward planning. I can’t remember how long in advance we’d started planning for the flexi, but it must have been quite a while in order to get all the translations sorted, money transferred etc. It was a significant amount of work for all the labels that were involved, and we’ll always be grateful for the efforts people went to. With each of the labels taking 500 copies it undoubtedly helped to increase our international audience – particularly outside Europe (where we were already touring quite regularly). One of the labels was Brazilian and another one was Japanese, and this really helped us to spread our music to places where people weren’t used to hearing us – particularly as it could be sold so cheaply in those places.\n\nWas there any specific reason, other than financial, to go with a flexi?\n\nBobs: No, it was just the cheap price that we could do it for that attracted us – not just the price of pressing them, but also the cheap price to mail them out in bulk.\n\nPunk and hardcore has a long history of utilising flexi-discs so I wondered if Bobs had any particular favourites:\n\nBobs: I reckon either The Last Days by THE SEXUAL or the first release by Execute (both from Japan) are probably my favourites. There was quite a few classic hardcore flexis that came out in Japan in the 80’s, as flexi releases seemed to be a pretty standard format over there at the time – the equivalent almost of a European band putting out a demo tape.\n\nLaying it’s cards on the table from the off, Where’s The Difference? lays into the hypocrisy of how war crimes are treated depending on which ‘side’ you happen to be on, doing so in a 30 second blast of 1990’s d-beat. Take It Back is a classic AM track of the time: fast, neat, catchy and lyrically inspiring with its defiant call to work cooperatively in order to avoid becoming a cog in the grinding machinery of capitalism.\n\nForce Fed Superstition is this releases’ anti-religion number. One of their patented blastbeat-ridden thrash attacks, it speaks of society’s normalisation of religion through schooling despite it being responsible for many wars, subjugation and exploitation. You won’t be singing along to this.\n\nNot Your Property takes on sexism within an alternative scene and direct action movement in denial with itself and does so in the form of a fast, angry punk song, making good use of feedback in the process. The flexi finishes with the short, mid-tempo Asylum wherein the writer feels despair at a humankind who seem happy to rub up alongside big business’ exploitation of the planet and it’s resources. ‘why else would people be satisfied with living in shit?’\n\nAlthough the lyrics to these songs cover similar ground to previous releases, it does feel like this EP has an overarching theme of war, sexism, religion and control. I was curious to know if this was intentional or simply their latest set of songs:\n\nBobs: I can’t remember thinking that there was an overarching theme, and looking back at it now I don’t see one. It wasn’t just the latest songs we had either – we’ll have had some more to choose from. We’ve always got plenty of unreleased songs lying around. And two of the songs on this had been recorded and released before on compilation LP’s (Not your Property and Take It Back). We usually just choose a collection of songs that we think will fit pretty well together on a record – trying to get a bit of variety in there as well. For this one, I’m also pretty sure that we took the limitations of the format into account – we expected that the sound quality would be a bit compromised, so didn’t want to throw a particularly intricate or mellow track on it where the song wouldn’t be shown at it’s best. That means there’s not as much variety on this one compared to our other releases. Mind you, it is only 6 minutes long so there’s not the opportunity to get much variation in there.\n\nWhere was it recorded and who by? How many copies have been pressed to date?\n\nBobs: By the time we recorded this, Trinity/Gladiator had closed down. I don’t think there was any other studios in Scarborough, so we ventured up north to record at Studio 64 in Middlesbrough. A lot of bands from the North East hardcore scene were recording there at the time, and it was part of the Middlesbrough Music Collective. We recorded there for a number of years after this release, and the only person I recall working with as an engineer there was Dale from MANFAT (later with JOHN HOLMES and now playing for JADED EYES). It’s possible that there was someone else there doing the knob-twiddling for this first session, but if so I can’t remember…\n\nIt’s only had a one-time pressing. We ordered 10,000 of them, as the cost was hardly any more than doing 5,000, and actually they over-supplied us so we ended up with more than 10,500. Perhaps not surprisingly we still have some left. The print run for it sounds very daunting these days, but it was a joint collaboration with 8 other labels, each of whom were taking 500, and it was also going in a fanzine (I can’t remember which one now), and they paid to take some as well. So half of them were already accounted for as soon as it was released.\n\nThe disc itself is a good quality flexi, no slipping or skipping and with better sound quality than many have managed. There is a beautiful piece of writing printed on the middle in a circular shape:\n\n‘If the Earth were only a few feet in diameter, floating a few feet above a field somewhere, people would come from everywhere to marvel at it. People would walk around it, marvelling at it’s big pools of water, its little pools and the water flowing between the pools. People would marvel at the bumps on it, and the holes in it, and they would marvel at the very thin layer of gas surrounding it and the water suspended in the gas. The people would marvel at all the creatures walking around the surface of the ball, and at the creatures in the water. The people would declare it precious because it was the only one, and they would protect it so that it would not be hurt. The ball would be the greatest wonder known, and the people would come to behold it, to be healed, to gain knowledge, to know beauty and to wonder how it could be. People would love it, and defend it with their lives, because they would somehow know that their lives, their own roundness, could be nothing without it. If the Earth were only a few feet in diameter.’\n\nI always assumed that one of the band had written this as it has a similar flow to the lyrics for Stream from the Welcome To The Slaughterhouse LP. I asked Bobs who wrote the piece and who put together the sleeve art for the EP:\n\nBobs: No, I didn’t write it. It was a poem that I found in a book somewhere. It was apparently written by somebody called Joe Miller in 1975. When I saw it, it was written in a circle, the way it is printed on the flexi, so it was easy to just copy it onto the label – just moving a few words in the middle either side so that the hole in the centre of the record didn’t mean they got lost. The sleeve artwork was done by me (obviously pinching from Edvard Munch).\n\nThis is an impressive release not least because of the co-operation and organisation between nine international DIY record labels in a pre-internet era. Included in the sleeve are lyrics in all languages represented by the labels involved and the front covers’ Scream/news cuttings collage is an effective representation of the EP’s title. The music and lyrical content contained on this flexible friend displays enough variation and tuneage to keep most DIY punkers raging and debating. We’ll finish with Bobs’ thoughts on this release today:\n\nI think it’s pretty good for what it is. The sound is a bit thin, but the flexi format isn’t very good for capturing much dynamic range. Again, the fact that we still have some of them does mean that I’m pretty much sick of the sight of it, but it has some decent songs on it. Take It Back is one that we’ve played live many times over the years, and has been frequently requested wherever we’ve been.\n\nDIS IS GETTING PATHETIC EP (Loony Tunes – UK, React – France, Victimas Del Progreso – Spain, Nikt Nic Nie Wie – Poland, Grinding Madness – Belgium, Gnome – Belgium, Tinnitus – Germany) 1995\n\nIdolising heroes is a game for fools – if you imitate them for money you’re playing corporate rules. It may have seemed like fun at the beginning, but now the joke is badly thinning. Need a name for your band? Choose any word starting with “Dis”. We’re trying to be serious – your just taking the piss. I wonder what happened to originality. Is there no longer room for sincerity and individuality?Get a life of your own – don’t be a punk rock clone…\n\nGet A Life lyric\n\nNever afraid to criticise aspects of the very scene they were immersed in, ACTIVE MINDS this time take on the burgeoning trend in bands who slavishly copied DISCHARGE – more on that later.\n\nThis eight track EP kicks off with Slaves To Fiction and musically it’s clear that they have overcome some of the limitations of working as a guitar/drums duo. The guitar sounds deeper and heavier giving a more muscular sound. A scorching opener, it deals with the thorny, and currently topical, issue of needing the freedom to criticise all world religions without being accused of racism for doing so. One can’t help feeling that this would be much more of a hot potato if written in the current climate due to the fact that this freedom has been exploited by racists and xenophobes the world over at an exponential rate. With this in mind, I wondered what the band’s thoughts on the song were:\n\nWell, I think it’s still I song that I’d stand behind 100%. It pretty much presaged a public debate that became very pertinent more than a decade later when the Blair government was putting the Racial And Religious Hatred Act 2006 through Parliament. The initial drafting of the Bill was seen by many (famously including the comedian Rowan Atkinson) as removing the right for people to criticise religious beliefs, by accepting that any such criticism was, by inference, an incitement of racial hatred. I think we face similar issues today – particularly around those who try to identify any criticism of the acts of the state of Israel as being anti-semitic. To me, it’s vital that we retain to the ability to challenge people’s beliefs and actions, regardless of whether or not those stem from religious or cultural upbringing. I guess the message is pretty similar to Very Bad Brains on the previous record.\n\nWe Don’t Need It sees another SAS (pre-AM band) song receive a substantial make-over. From the anarcho punk of the 1983 original, here it is reworked into a harsh slice of thrash incorporating a slow breakdown coda. Poison Cloud tells the tale of the Union Carbide/Bhopal chemical leak of 1984, adding the wider context of companies exploiting the freedom to set up shop in countries with poor health and safety laws. Musically, it’s a fast punker with, inevitably, shades of DISCHARGE but once you have read about this appalling tragedy, trust me, you’ll have forgotten about the music. (photo: Anglo-Asian 1986)\n\nFashion Mask takes to task caricature ‘punks’ who play up to empty media stereotypes via a great mid-paced track with clean, sung vocals. One Step Forward – Two Steps Back sees a change of pace as they take on the then thorny topic of former pacifists advocating violent revolution to bring about change. The band counter this with their realistic brand of pacifism, adding that violence breeds violence. The song begins with a gentle indie guitar intro before settling into a fast-paced, but curiously heartfelt number. The addition of an almost ‘indie’ effect on the guitar completes what is a real highlight of the EP.\n\nA False Sense of Security treats us to a bassy intro followed by a crashing build up to a fast n’ catchy song about the ignorance of many to politics and what is going on outside of their own bubble. When the guitar cuts out leaving the drums and the words “what are you going to do when it happens to you? Who’ll be left for you to turn to?“, you’ll be singing along.\n\nThis great track is followed by Phoenix in which the writer bemoans the state of the hardcore/punk scene, welcoming it’s end so that something better can rise and replace it. Unfortunately, this is done in the form of an enjoyable intro and verse before abruptly finishing and is in need of a chorus and more song – for once, I don’t believe the short song format works here. With regard to the lyrics, I was keen to ask Bobs if he had specific examples of DIY bands aspiring to, or signing with major labels at the time:\n\nWell, this was 1995 and long after the initial “Britcore” boom of the late-80’s, so I think there was quite a lot of commercialism which had crept into the scene. Peaceville Records had sold all it’s catalogue to Music For Nations and had, along with Earache, long since been focused on being primarily a metal label. CHUMBAWAMBA hadn’t yet moved to EMI, but they were now signed to One Little Indian who, despite their underground punk roots and still being officially an “indie” label, seemed to me to act like a wannabe major label. The late 80’s had brought a lot of attention to the scene from the mainstream music industry and I think there was quite a few people who were more than willing to play ball with that, although I can’t think of which particular bands I was thinking of when I wrote the song.\n\nFinally to Get A Life, the title song if you will. By 1995, the punk scene’s worship of DISCHARGE had reached fever pitch but, rather than take inspiration from the Stoke noise legends, had reduced themselves to being cringeworthy copyists. Minimal lyrics about nuclear war, identical imagery, even down to the names of the bands – DISFEAR, DISCLOSE and believe it or not, DISCHANGE. ACTIVE MINDS, despite being fans of DISCHARGE themselves and D-beat in general, took umbridge with these bands’ lyrical lack of originality. The song itself is an energetic speed-rush with more than a hint of d-beat and a brilliant way to end the record. Obviously I wanted to get Bobs’ thoughts on the subject so I asked him:\n\nPP: Could you please give a short summary of your outlook on this at the time and expand on how things have developed since and where we are today? What was the reaction from the bands in question and from the wider scene at the time?\n\nThe first of the “Dis” clone bands I ever saw or heard was, I’m pretty sure, DISASTER from Halifax. I thought they were fun – yes an obvious rip-off of “Why”-era Discharge, but everyone takes ideas from somebody else and the world wasn’t swamped with slavish Discharge copy bands back then. We organized an all-dayer at the 1-in-12 in Bradford and put Disaster on the bill, and I even mocked up a Discharge-style logo for them, because I thought it would be quite funny. Little did I realise that within a few years I would be sick to death of bands who chose any world beginning with “Dis” as their name (or even made words up. Disfornicate? Really?), and slavishly copied both the Discharge sound and artwork style. To me, by the time we got to recording “Dis Is Getting Pathetic…” the situation had got so bad that I thought that some of the bands were almost a parody – a clear sign of stagnation in a scene in which the message had once been so important. I often used to think about how people who were outside hardcore would view a release if they picked it up, and the Dis-clone scene seemed to be like one big in-joke – with lyrics which were just too flippant or simplistic, and too easy to dismiss as irrelevant to the world we lived in. I think the scene has changed now, and although obviously some bands are still a big influence musically I don’t think you get slavish copying in the same way.\n\nI think we’d have to say that the reaction to the EP was “mixed”, to say the least! There was quite a lot of people who agreed with what we said, but to many people it also cemented our reputation as a pair of humourless bastards – even though I thought the record sleeve itself was quite funny and tongue-in-cheek. I think it was a bit more polarising than I would have liked – with some people thinking that there were two camps and they had to choose one. If we were criticising a band that they liked, then they would be against us. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, some of the bands themselves took offence. I try not to take criticism of things that I do too personally – if someone doesn’t like something I’ve said or a record we put out then that doesn’t mean that I can’t be on friendly terms with them. But I do realise now (probably more so than I did then) that many people aren’t like that – particularly when they’re in their 20’s. I think that some people held onto some resentments about us for many years, whereas for me, even at the time of the record, we just hoped to say our piece and move on.\n\nPP: How many copies have been pressed to date?\n\nWe initially pressed 5,000 and then re-pressed another 1,000, so there’s 6,000 of them around altogether. Again this was a multi-label collaboration, with 5 other labels each taking 500 copies, which helped us to shift them all and made the initial print run of 5,000 (which was quite large for us) a sensible option.\n\nThere is a palpable upping of the ante in the production, a beefing up of the overall sound. It’s meatier than anything recorded before by the band so I was interested in whether or not this was as a result of using different equipment and/or production methods:\n\nBobs: It was recorded at Studio 64 in Middlesbrough again, and I’m pretty sure Dale did the knob-twiddling. We were still recording everything live with no overdubs at this stage, but things had changed in that I was now using two amps – a bass amp and a guitar amp, so that’s what accounts for the sound being a bit fuller. I’d got a signal splitting pedal made up by a local guy who worked in a guitar shop, which enabled me to split my guitar signal in two and play through two amps – each signal having an on/off switch, so that I could drop either the bass or guitar out if I wanted and then bring it in for more impact. He only charged me £12 to make it, and it was the best £12 I ever spent! I’m still using it now – I don’t think there’s any pedal in general manufacture that does the same thing. I’d actually first used this double amp method on the flexi, but the overall thin sound of the flexi meant that the effect wasn’t as noticeable as it was on this EP.\n\nThere are some fearless lyrical concerns, the band completely unafraid to tackle the micro as well as the more abstract, international problems. The booklet is crammed with thought-provoking lyrics, explanations and graphics, making this an essential AM release. To finish then, I asked Bobs for his thoughts on the EP today:\n\nI think it’s a pretty decent record – some good songs, although the mix on One Step Forward – Two Steps Back is too thin to do it justice. There’s also a dropout in the sound at the beginning of We Don’t Need It which always irritates me when I listen to it, and listening to that with my present-day head on makes me realise how much recording standards have changed now – we’d never come out of the studio and leave a problem like that in there these days, but, then again, we’re now making recordings which we expect still to be listened too many years from now (living on in eternity on the internet), whereas back then a record was looked on as a much more short-term thing. In hindsight, it probably wasn’t worth us starting a battle with a bunch of “Dis”-clone bands, although that wasn’t really our intention and I still think that what we were saying was valid.\n\nThanks to Bobs once again for taking the time to answer my questions in such detail.\n\nPART THREE\n\nBit of a leap this but I’m trying to stick to the memory each record conjures up. This NEUROTICS single takes me back to a place that had closed down long before it’s release…\n\nAfter leaving school, my best friend Paz attended sixth form college. This left me and Bainy, a tall, rangy oddball with a shock of spiky white hair, with little to do but live the early 80’s punk rock dream: signing on the dole and hanging out in legendary local record shop, Parade. Scunthorpe’s first purely independent record store, it was in the right time and place to ride the late 70’s/early 80’s indie label boom and soon became a magnet for local punks and assorted weirdos. One whole wall was a display of all the latest 7″ singles in stock. We still talk about that wall. The proprietor was a guy called Singer, something of a legend to us as he was a cool, slightly older type who had left punk behind for the more experimental post-punk and DIY electronics of bands like JOY DIVISION and CABARET VOLTAIRE. We got to know him through hanging around in the shop and he was a good guy, quietly spoken and affable, even leaving us to watch the place occasionally while he nipped off to the bank. Harmlessly sniffy about our enthusiasm for the latest CRASS or EXPLOITED releases, we’d pester him to play records all the time. One morning, I begged him to spin Dead Cities, the new single by THE EXPLOITED which had just arrived. As the song roared into life, he shook his head in exasperation and said: “but the bass just follows the guitar, it’s really boring.” Failing to grasp how he could remain unmoved by it, I continued to air drum, vigorously banging my head to the primitive clatter of ‘Dead Ciiiieeees’! It was a rare treat to be present when a delivery of records arrived and we must have plagued the poor man with our excited cooing as he unpacked them.\n\nParade was certainly in the right time and place for us in our formative years of musical obsession and we adored hanging out there, flicking through the racks and agonizing over which records to spend our meagre earnings on. Paz and me recruited our band EVASIVE ACTION’s second singer in Parade. We didn’t really know him too well but we thought he exuded cool with his fluffy Captain Sensible jumper and caustic manner. After we approached him with our offer, he uttered some wisecrack and agreed to do it.\n\nBainy (the spiky-haired oddball) and me spent much of our dole days in Parade, pawing over the latest second wave punk rock releases. We read all the coverage in Sounds (weekly music newspaper) and were enthusiastic about all the different strands: CRASS, Oi!, EXPLOITED, dabbling a little into the harsher side of things with DISCHARGE and DISORDER, although it took a little longer to connect with me. I was still puritanical about tunes and choruses and the sheer brutality of DISCHARGE, coupled with their ‘noise not music’ slogan, was fascinating but initially a little too much for my conventional ears. Regardless, it was all there, up on that legendary wall of singles.\n\nAfter reading a gushing review of NEWTOWN NEUROTICS’ double A side single Kick Out The Tories/Mindless Violence (1981) in Sounds, Bainy decided he wanted it so off we went to Parade. I decided to get something else, figuring that I could just tape it off him and have the best of both worlds. I can’t remember what I bought that day but should have got my own copy of the NEUROTICS single as it’s a classic double A. I played my tape of it into the dust and never did manage to pick a copy up and in these days of eBay and Discogs, it is always just out of reach. ‘Kick Out The Tories’ is a rallying cry, a merciless attack on the heartless Thatcher government of the day (“when that bastard is in, unemployment grows”) but the hero of this double-header is ‘Mindless Violence’, a scorching, early JAM-like blast of tuneful glory. And just listen to that version which blends the song with ATTILA THE STOCKBROKER’s ‘Andy Is A Corporatist’. It transforms the NEUROTICS’ ardent attack on street muggings and random violent assaults, into an equally passionate rant against the scourge of nazi skinheads.\n\nI digress. The LIVING WITH UNEMPLOYMENT EP I’m talking about here is my memory piece simply because it reminds me of Parade. Because it reminds me of that earlier single. It’s tenuous but feels good. A live EP lifted from their Kickstarting A Backfiring Nation LP set, the title track is their reworking of THE MEMBERS’ 1978 classic Solitary Confinement. The lyrics are changed from the originals’ angst-ridden ode to the loneliness of living in the big city, to a reflection of unemployment in Thatcher’s Britain. I’d never heard the MEMBERS’ original at that time and I had to wait for the internet to arrive before I could. The experience was slightly disconcerting, as the NEUROTICS version was so fondly ensconced in my musical brain. It can’t be denied though, that it is a glorious punk racket and, had I heard this in 1978, 13-year-old me would have been careering off the walls. The NEUROTICS EP was released in 1986 during what I refer to as my ‘punk rock wilderness years’ (I’ll expand on this in a future post) when punk had all but disappeared from the usual sources, Sounds and NME (I was still to discover fanzines), Parade had sadly closed its doors and the remaining record shops in Scunthorpe now only stocked the ‘biggies’ of punk like CONFLICT and DEAD KENNEDYS. In short, anything with good distribution. THE NEUROTICS were on Jungle Records at this point (who also distributed CONFLICT releases) and I bought both EP and LP. The 7″ includes a scorching band version of ATTILA THE STOCKBROKER’s Airstrip One. The LP is an outstanding live recording which includes various punk poets performing in between songs, one of whom was PORKY THE POET, aka Phil Jupitus. Both these records take me back to those wilderness years, accompanied by a warm, fuzzy melancholy and are great examples of tuneful punk rock married with simple but effective social commentary.\n\nHere’s one Parade anecdote to leave you with and I’d be willing to bet there are many more out there to be told. One time, when Bainy and me were lolling about flicking through the racks, a middle-aged, pompous looking woman came in with a record in her hand and a sour look on her face. She marched over to Singer who was sitting behind the counter, placing new arrivals into plastic sleeves and no doubt wishing we would just buy something and sod off. He looked up and asked in his quiet, kindly voice if he could help her. She slammed the record down on the counter, prompting Bainy and me to turn around and watch as she, very angrily, told her tale: her son had returned home to find mum and dad entertaining a small gathering of friends. Having just purchased a single from Parade, he proceeded to place it on the turntable, turn the volume up loud and play it for said gathering. The obscene filth that spewed forth from the speakers, she said, had traumatized the assembled guests. She demanded a refund and, while a red-faced Singer dealt with her request, she lambasted him for selling this kind of disgusting trash to children. After leaving the shop, the door crashing shut behind her, the three of us looked at each other, shrugged our shoulders and carried on flipping through the racks. The record she returned? Reality Asylum by CRASS.\n\nParade shut up shop in April 1983, after struggling against competition from Record Village, but also crippled by a massive hike in business rates. It may have only been open for two short years, but for me and my friends it remains a shining memory of those crucial years and we still talk of it in reverential tones. I hope to interview Singer about Parade in a future post.\n\n…Scunthorpe, 1986, driving through town in a shitty car. My mate, Jim, at the wheel. ‘Living With Unemployment’ by THE NEUROTICS blasts from the tape deck, a beautiful moment in time. The song ends. Singer Steve Drewett: “Thank you and goodnight!” Jim: “Thank you, now fuck off!”\n\nInterview with Singer, proprietor of Parade here: https://personalpunk.wordpress.com/category/punk-rock/\n\nflies, blisters and hardcore punk\n\nPLEASANT VALLEY CHILDREN were late 80’s, UK hardcore punk with a dark, nihilistic identity. Criminally underrated, most people prefer their admittedly impressive demo. For me though their best recording was the FUCK KILL DESTROY! LP (released in 1991 on Words Of Warning Records), a near-perfect capture of twisted, sarcastic hardcore. At times unhinged, at others brooding, touchstones are DEAD KENNEDYS & CRUCIFUCKS, though reviews at the time favoured BLACK FLAG as a strong influence. Shot through with a deliciously dark British humour, it was capped off with dismal, nihilistic artwork. That said, it is their debut 7″ EP, What The World Needs Now (1989, also on WOW), that brings back halcyon memories of flies, blisters and youth hostels.\n\nwhat the world needs now… is a personal fly-cloud\n\nSoon after the release of this single, my brother David and I embarked on an ambitious (for us) week of hiking in the Yorkshire Dales. The plan was to walk from hostel to hostel, armed only with an ordnance survey map and Dave’s meticulously planned route. A truly memorable week, not least because the blisters I developed were beyond anything I had expected. Incredible. Then there were the flies. It was towards the start of the trip, the weather was balmy and we were nice n’ relaxed as we passed a copse to our left. As we clambered over a stile to cross a field, an enormous swarm of flies swooped out of the trees, enveloping us completely. Running full pelt, complete with our own personal fly-cloud, rucksacks jouncing, arms waving frantically while making pathetic shrieking noises, we finally we made it to the other side. We collapsed, laughing uncontrollably, the flies having inexplicably retreated back to their watch.\n\nAnother day saw us having to walk half way down a mountain and back up again to avoid a particularly intense looking herd of cows, who hadn’t taken too kindly to a couple of pasty-faced humes crossing their path. Subsequently, we got lost on the top of that mist-shrouded mountain, and Dave wandered off to see if he could figure out the correct route down. He was gone for ages. I stood there, frantically scanning the eerily thick fog, shouting his name until I thought my throat would tear. After a disconcertingly long time, he reappeared out of the mist and I blasted him because my worry came out as anger. I remember thinking that I sounded just like our Dad when he got mad, possibly the first time of many I realised that, at least in part, we can’t escape becoming our parents.\n\n“what do you mean, no pub?”\n\nOn one day’s walking, Dave’s well-researched route had inevitably gone awry, so we hitched a ride the rest of the way. When we arrived, I discovered that he had booked us into a hostel that didn’t have a pub within walking distance. I know. I wonder at how man times I must have said “what do you mean, no pub?” After walking all those miles each day, I always looked forward to plopping down, exhausted, in the nearest Dales drinking establishment, scarfing down some food and following it with a few choice ales (lager). Suitably unimpressed, I fumed on my bunk, attempting to read Silence of the Lambs while listening to a grizzled ex-army bloke pop his blisters with a pin whilst simultaneously opining the lack of conscription in the UK. Downstairs in the games room, Dave played skittles and other table-top thrills with some lasses he’d met – he was single then and always on the lookout. It was a long night.\n\nuncharacteristic casual cruelty\n\nWe gave names to some of the characters we met along the way: Bottle Aftermath, Huge Features and Sheep spring to mind, though I think I can safely leave the origin of these to your imagination. Uncharacteristically cruel as this may seem, the only defence I can offer is that those so-named were, without exception, pompous twats and smug know-it-alls. Skipping forward, the last day arrived and I recall it perfectly, bittersweet though it is. The long, torturous haul to the pick-up point reduced me to a blistered, sun-blasted creature, virtually on my hands and knees. The aforementioned blisters had finally succumbed to the pressure, the leaking fluid soaking the ends of my socks – I had had enough while Dave breezed ahead, cheerily pointing out the welcoming sight of our parents car in the distance. This was the second time during that week that I was immeasurably pleased to see them. The first was on the day we had walked for hours in torrential rain and, on arriving in Settle, there they were, having booked us a room in an actual pub. Just… wow. That week was a truly memorable time for me and my kid brother. The day we decided to take a break from walking, we spent the day rock hopping and arsing about round Aysgarth Falls, like a couple of kids without a care (which we were, really – Dave and me were late to mature) has taken on hazy, soft-focus hues with the passage of time, and remains a special memory.\n\nthe return of Huge Features\n\nSo why does the beautiful mess of the PLEASANT VALLEY CHILDREN EP take me back to that week? One evening, after another days slog, we turned up at Grinton Lodge Youth Hostel to find that they didn’t have any beds left. That’s a lie. They did have a damp, mouldy old caravan on the hostel grounds. Too tired to be choosy, we took it. After walking into Reeth and unearthing a pub with a vegetarian menu – a rarity in most places back then but unheard of in rural Yorkshire – tucked up in our damp cots, we listened to one of my compilation tapes. On it was Flounder by PVC, taken from the EP this article is titled after. Pig Havoc growling “sometimes I could kick you just to see you mooove!” made us laugh so hard, we must have kept awake those staying in the other damp and mouldy caravan across the way. We rose early in the morning to spot none other than Huge Features himself, stepping bleary-eyed from it and didn’t feel so bad. We did, however, keep up our admirable Pig Havoc impressions for the rest of the week.\n\na Sned story\n\nPVC’s drummer Sned was a crucial piece of the DIY scene in the 80s, 90s and beyond. As well as playing in countless legendary UK bands such as GENERIC, ONE BY ONE, HEALTH HAZARD, JOHN HOLMES and BOXED IN, he also released a slew of vital records on his Flat Earth label – all of which are available to stream on the bandcamp page – and he was/is a really amiable bloke. Our paths crossed on a few occasions, so here is a little Sned story: from 1987 to 1989, my then partner Sarah and I promoted DIY punk gigs under the name Off With Her Head at the Queens Hotel in Scunthorpe, and there are many tales from this time. PVC actually appeared at one of the later ones and played an unhinged set to the local crowd who had a penchant for sitting on the floor. This didn’t prevent vocalist Pig Havoc from stalking and thrashing his way among them. That same year, Sned’s other band, GENERIC, played with Danbert Nobacon (of CHUMBAWAMBA), the latter doing his solo acoustic act. Incidentally, around this time, Danbert released a 7″ single with a close up of his genitals on the cover, and had taken to dropping his trousers while playing those songs live. Thankfully, we were spared that on this night.\n\nSned had been feeling rough since arriving earlier in the evening but by the time Danbert took the stage, he looked awful and said that he felt really ill. It was suggested that he should go to A&E to get checked over so I went with him and the rest of the band to Scunthorpe General Hospital. While we waited for him to be seen on that busy Saturday night, back at the Queens the unfortunate Danbert was heroically extending his set in the hope that GENERIC would get back in time to play theirs. Finally, Sned was diagnosed with a urine infection and treated with antibiotics. We made it back to the venue, Sned feeling much better and GENERIC managed to play a brilliant set to an appreciative but seated crowd.\n\nAround the time PVC played their gig at The Queens, the UK punk scene was awash with bands playing crusty, metallic thrash and PVC shone brightly with their off-kilter racket. They remain another unsung gem in the UK DIY hardcore punk canon.\n\n“‘ave ya got Into The Valley by THE SKIDS?” (Paul Calf to DJ)\n\nI first heard THE SKIDS when John Peel played The Saints Are Coming (Wide Open EP, 1978), an electrifying two minutes that stood apart from the punk pack of the time. I bought that EP, a great four-track affair that also features the classic Of One Skin.\n\nWhen Into The Valley came out in 1979, it was an earth-moving moment for me and my punk-obsessed friends. By the end of 1977, contrary to popularly held belief, punk rock had died only for the trendy London set and those lucky enough to discover it early, already moving onto more experimental sounds. For kids like us growing up in small towns it was still filtering through and consuming our young lives.\n\nThe song begins with an ominous, marching bass riff, carved up by Stuart Adamson’s iconic, jaw-dropping guitar, before bursting into a solid-gold classic, aided by powerhouse drumming and the unique Scottish vocals of Richard Jobson. An exhilarating punk rock battle hymn, brought fully to life by the faultless production of David Batchelor, who also worked with THE ALEX HARVEY BAND, DR FEELGOOD & OASIS. The singers’ poetic prose was rendered all but indecipherable by his burly brogue, compelling fans to concoct their own nonsensical versions, though I managed to snag the issue of Smash Hits magazine with the lyrics printed inside. Jobsons’s audacious, high-kicking dance, as witnessed on Top of the Pops, was gleefully adopted by kids at youth club disco’s up and down the land.\n\nI was 14 years old when Into The Valley was released and it was one of those punk singles that I became obsessed with, developing into an obsession with the band generally, albeit for just a couple of years. My interest began to wane sometime around 1980 after buying most of the singles, the last one of which was Circus Games, a fine moment in their run of razor-sharp releases at the time. I obviously wasn’t sufficiently moved (or moneyed) to buy the band’s third album it was lifted from – The Absolute Game – despite being tempted by a limited edition which came with a free LP of experimental material. My younger brother Dave later had another single from this album, A Woman in Winter. When I asked him what he thought of it, he solemnly shook his head and said: “it’s terrible”.\n\nThe album Into The Valley was taken from, Scared To Dance, is an overlooked classic of its time, never referenced in retrospectives – not any real indication of quality I know, but still. A mighty punk rock album by any standard, it succeeded in being powerful and anthemic, while simultaneously harbouring an ageless sense of brooding poetry. My paper round wages wouldn’t cover it and I still remember the jealousy I felt when a mate bought it. Looking back, he was a dark and often cruel character, possibly as a result of having wealthy parents, being shunted around the country every couple of years and given everything he wanted. Our friendship was short-lived, but how I pored over that album. The artwork and lyrics were a little too abstract for my still-developing brain – apart from the self-explanatory Charles – which just served to make it all the more captivating. I copied it to a cassette and that was how I listened to it during that wondrous year of skateboarding, listening to John Peel under the covers, and singing along to punk songs in my bedroom. If proof were needed that things move fast when you’re a teenager, in just a year’s time I would be relying on my bum-fluff ‘stache to get into pubs.\n\nThe b-side, TV Stars, was recorded live at The Marquee in 1978. It displayed a humorous side to the otherwise wordy, intellectual poetry of much of their output. It consisted of a basic punky riff, accompanied by Jobson shouting the names of characters from various soap opera’s (Ena Sharples, Annie Walker, Sandy Richardson) with Kenny Dalglish and John Peel also getting a mention. The rowdy live recording, with crowd chants of ALBERT TATLOCK!, Jobson’s unintelligible Scottish banter and Stuart Adamson’s shredding guitar were thrilling to these pre-live-experience ears.\n\nMy copy of Into The Valley was on black vinyl and soon became well-worn, nay, knackered, so I was delighted to find a copy at a car boot sale years later, on white vinyl and almost as bruised as mine. I like to think that whoever had sold it on had once been a 14-year-old kid eagerly playing it to death, singing a garbled version in his bedroom, perfecting his own high-kicking dance.\n\nSKIDS’ Second album, Days In Europa, was released in 1980. I bought this on release and enjoyed it but it wasn’t a patch on Scared… despite yielding two colossal singles in Working for the Yankee Dollar, released as a double 7″ pack*, and Charade. A further single, Animation, was disappointing but time has been kind and, though not as immediate as some of their other big-hitter singles, it is a mature grower.\n\n*How could any fan resist the limited double 7″ single? In the case of between-album single Masquerade (another potent SKIDS moment), I had no choice. Here is a memory so clear, I can almost taste it, with a pang of melancholy longing: The late 1970’s, a time when it seemed almost every shop you went into sold records. I’m in the record section of an otherwise dull department store (Binns) in Scunthorpe, looking for the new SKIDS single, Masquerade. I’ve already had a scan through the albums, looking at records by XTC, JILTED JOHN and SHAM 69. Now I’m at the counter flicking through their little box of singles, the lady behind the counter watching me closely, impatience emanating from her in waves that fail to dent my excitement. I find what I’m looking for and pull it out. The emotions cycle through me: elation, then puzzlement, followed by disappointment, then excitement again but in the end, simple frustration. I am indeed holding the new single by SKIDS, the very thing I came to buy with my hard-earned paper round money clutched in my sweaty paw, but… why is it in a gatefold picture sleeve? Wait… there’s an extra single included, with more new songs on it – but it’s more expensive. My eyes widen, my mouth gapes and I may even be salivating. I wanted this thing so badly but… I just didn’t have the extra funds. That precious undimmed memory starts to fade around about there but I did buy the single version that day, I cherished it and eventually got myself one of those double packs, albeit twenty-five years later. It was worth the wait.\n\nYesterday, 24th March 2018, I finally bought a release that had been digging away at me since it came out in 2015: SKIDS: THE VIRGIN YEARS. Only available on CD, it is a remarkable collection of 6 discs containing all four of their studio albums, the remixed version of Days In Europa and a separate disc containing all of their John Peel Sessions. There’s also a BBC live set from 1979 as well as b-sides & early singles. It is a startling collection. My music buying habits don’t usually take me this far into the past but I found myself salivating at the thought of hearing this, as if I was that hungry teenager once more. I’ve found myself obsessing all over again. Also, I finally discovered that The Absolute Game is a mixed bag of classic SKIDS and weaker, more progressive material and that their final album, Joy, is a self indulgent atrocity.\n\nThere is hardly any live footage of the band out there from their heyday but what there is looks tantalising. I would have loved to have seen them live, ideally around 1978/79. Of course, they have now reformed as so many do and to their credit, have just released an album of new material (Burning Cities) which is, somewhat inevitably, disappointing. So this leads me to…\n\nSNOBBERY ALERT: I do not judge those who, for reasons of nostalgia or because they were too young the first time around, wish to go and watch reformed old punk bands play. Personally? I find it a little depressing. Lighten up, I hear you say. I get that, but y’know what, and never say never, but I just don’t think it’s for me. I hear reports that some of these bands are still great live. I’m sure that’s true but I’ve seen enough YouTube footage to convince me that this is mostly not the case. I do wish that I could have seen THE SKIDS back in their relatively brief heyday but the hard truth is that some things are better left in the past.\n\nCase in point: the band who had the biggest influence on my life is CRASS. In May 1982, when I was 16, I had the chance to see them play live at the Tower Ballroom in Hull, a little over 30 minutes from my home town. Teenage hormones won out and I skipped it to spend just another night canoodling with my non-punk loving girlfriend. A big musical regret. However, the idea of going to see CRASS vocalist Steve Ignorant in 2011 playing CRASS songs “for the last time” at the Shepherds Bush Empire just wasn’t something I would find anything other than cringe-inducing. I mean, it’s fine. it’s his choice to do it, people’s choice to indulge and my choice not to. As far as I’m concerned I missed out all those years ago and that’s where it ends. Maybe some music genres can get away with it but for me, punk is something else. I was so young, as were the bands, mostly. That youthful, primitive energy, the fury, the intensity, those radical, often naive lyrics written by teenagers. Reforming and playing those songs again as middle-aged men either for money, nostalgia or both is a tough sell. UK SUBS don’t count. They have been at it since they started, and Charlie Harper was already a middle-aged man. I have some respect for those bands who choose to reform and record new material, but why not start a new band? EPIC PROBLEM, featuring Mackie from legendary Oi!-punks BLITZ, could have reformed with him as the only original member. Instead, he kept listening to new punk rock music through the years and formed a new band, influenced by LEATHERFACE and RANCID. Remember that punk rock only withered on the vine if your reference point is the mainstream. If this is your only experience of punk then I can see why you would view it as a passing teenage phase you occasionally relive. In this space, it disappears for a few years only to pop up again when the music press decides to hype a few new bands. Real punk went underground where it has thrived ever since. Dig down into it and you will find thriving, uncompromising punk scenes the world over and an equally rich history. Just don’t expect it to sound like the SEX PISTOLS.\n\nFinal note on THE SKIDS: Stuart Adamson (RIP), This man’s guitar sound and style was as distinctive as Jobson’s vocals. I know nothing about guitars and how he managed to create such a sound but it can be heard on their first independent single Charles, albeit less developed. On Into The Valley, Of One Skin and many others, it is unique, or at least it was then. When the guitar riff kicks in on Into The Valley, it still has the power to send shivers down the spine all these years later. Post-THE SKIDS, he had great success with BIG COUNTRY and continued to develop, giving the band a panoramic clout, aided by his singular style. Although I left them behind, one can definitely hear the SKIDS guitar sound on early BIG COUNTRY singles Harvest Home and Fields of Fire."
