        "text": "The first moment? Driving down a nice two-lane highway, summer day, Ann Arbor, Michigan. I'm in the backseat of a '49 Cadillac. Always had a good car, my dad. Frank Sinatra's singing: \"Fairy tales can come true/It can happen to you/If you're young at heart.\" My dad's singing along. From that moment on, when people asked me what I wanted to be, I would say, \"A singer.\" As I got older, I realized that might not be realistic. So then I thought, I'll become a politician.\n\nThe more walking-around money I have, the less I walk around.\n\nSex may be a little more factual than love. You know whether it was good or not. You know whether you liked it or not. You're not going to change your mind about it ten years later.\n\nTry to find some ground that hasn't been covered.\n\nThe peanut butter, the shards of glass -- I look back upon those moments kind of like a proud parent.\n\nWe lived in a trailer. My parents gave up their bedroom, and I moved in with my drum set. My dad just sat there with his quarter-inch military haircut, reading the newspaper. My parents wanted to light my artistic candle. But over time, the definition of \"the arts\" began to stretch. And as I got older, they suddenly realized, Oh, my God, we're the parents of Iggy Pop.\n\nI became Iggy because I had a sadistic boss at a record store. I'd been in a band called the Iguanas. And when this boss wanted to embarrass and demean me, he'd say, Iggy, get me a coffee, light. And that really pissed me off, because in those days a cool nickname was Tab or Rock. I had a nickname that I couldn't escape around town and it was torture. Then my band opened for Blood, Sweat & Tears. I think the entire band got fifty dollars total. But we had a lot of new ground. And afterward a huge piece was written about us in the Michigan Daily. In this story, the writer calls me Iggy. I was like, Oh, fuck. We got all this press, but they're calling me Iggy. What could I do? I knew the value of publicity. So I put a little \"Pop\" on the end. Took me thirty years to make what I wanted out of the name.\n\nMy mom was a saint. She taught me to be terminally nice.\n\nYou must've had a night where you did two grams of nasty blow in New York City and a fifth of Jack Daniel's and been with not the greatest chick you ever slept with and you got two hours' sleep and you wake up and it's the morning rush and you're hearing honk! honk! honk! out your window and it's gray and it's cold and you just want to die. At that moment, yeah, I regretted what I'd done the night before. But big-picture regrets? Nah.\n\nI'm not a one-trick pony. I've had my picture in People magazine vacuuming the floor. I do a little vacuuming, a little bleeding.\n\nA lot of people tried to out-Iggy Iggy. G.G. Allin. He was just doing every awful thing onstage: having sex, going to the toilet. He took that detail and ran with it. That didn't put me in a position to compete with him. Just the opposite. It made me embarrassed.\n\nI was lucky. I'd seen my own vomit and it was green. It was some sort of bile, and it told me this is too serious. Can't go on. The green vomit gave me a chance to step out and get a little perspective on the world.\n\nThe drugs went away gradually. The outbursts got fewer and farther between. The big turn for me came when my body began to remember all the times it felt bad. Then I became very, very strong. I really don't want to crawl under the table and shiver and see little mice running under my eyes for the next fourteen hours. I don't want my confidence for the next twenty-two gigs fucked with.\n\nQigong is such a powerful form of energy that some of the masters in China can walk on tissue paper. You know -- twelve large men cannot push me. There are guys who can do that shit. I've learned enough of the qigong to deal with the musician's lifestyle.\n\nNothing's shocking anymore. The transfer of information has become so fast, we're at the point where even the straightest little old lady in Jonesville, South Carolina, is saying, Ah, we've heard about that Marilyn Manson and we know what he does at night....\n\nAlmost all cool-ass rock front guys are incredibly huge assholes. It would be nice to meet one who wasn't.\n\nI find it hard to focus looking forward. So I look backward. What was I doing when I was thirty-nine? That was the first time I woke up and thought, You're about to decease unless you get some sort of plan going. I did, and that worked out pretty well. So there's hope for twenty years from now.\n\nThe best piece of wisdom my father gave me came fairly recently. I was trying to decide on a new woman in my life. He said, \"Well, just listen to your medulla oblongata. It'll tell you what to do.\" So I listened to my medulla oblongata, and it said, \"Get with that Nigerian-Irish chick. Go with the hottie.\"\n\nI have no idea why a guy would bring a jar of peanut butter to a concert.\n\nThere will always be explosions. But there will always be a vestige left."
