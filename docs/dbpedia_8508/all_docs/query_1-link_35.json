        "meta_description": "Malpractice single by GG Allin, released 14 January 2022\n\n1. Malpractice - Love Tunnel\n2. Malpractice - Devil&#39;s Triangle\n\nFrom wilderness of New Hampshire in the 1977, Malpractice were one of many original rock bands plying their craft. \r\n\r\nKevin Allin (soon to be GG Allin) was the drummer and his brother Merle Allin played bass. Jeff Penney played guitar and was the songwriter.\r\n\r\nEven though it was 1977, the ground zero year for punk rock, Malpractice were 100% rock and roll. They were contemporaries with other New England bands like The Cars and they loved Aerosmith.\r\n\r\nTheir one and only record was released in 1977 and we at TPOS are proud to have officially reissued it. If you&#39;re a fan of original 1970&#39;s rock, or you&#39;re interested in the musical roots of GG and Merle Allin, this record is for you.",
