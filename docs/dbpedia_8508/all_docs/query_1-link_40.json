        "text": "G.G. Allin’s biography was not typical of those I usually research for this blog. I’ve never listened to his music, nor seen one of his performances. Nor do I wish I had. Up until a few months ago, I had never heard of him.\n\nBe forewarned: If you do not wish to read disturbing material, please refrain from selecting the links below. I have been careful, but truthful, in my presentation of this material.\n\nIf I solely wrote about New Hampshire’s history and people that I find comfortable, or politically correct, then I would not be honest with myself, or with you. I sometimes complain that our history books are sugar-coated, and that they contain selective topics supporting a single point of view. Therefore history honesty has to begin with me.\n\nNew Hampshire’s people are not all angels, nor all demons. Human beings fall somewhere in between those categories–usually. For this blog entry, I’ve selected a person from the not so distant past, who appeared to sit on the demon end of the humanity scale. But did he really?\n\nG.G. Allin’s music and performances were not for the faint of heart. To some, he was the ultimate rebel. To others he was a disgusting degenerate. His stage act, which will NOT be thoroughly described on this blog, resulted in his being arrested over 50 times. Often the clubs where he played closed within 10-20 minutes of his beginning the performance.\n\nHe abused his body, his stage members, and his fans. His supporters admired his ability to freely express himself, and enjoyed that it disgusted or outraged others. Even his song titles were created to shock and repulse. Some called him brilliant, while others saw him as a troubled soul. In 1989 the State of Michigan’s court sentencing recommendation included a description of G.G.’s profile of “alcohol dependency, mixed personality disorder with borderline narcissistic and masochistic features, and antisocial personality disorder.”\n\nG.G. Allin recorded for many small labels and with many different bands. He promised his fans he would commit suicide on stage for them. He died of a drug overdose before he could keep that promise.\n\nReportedly he was born as Jesus Christ Allin, on August 29, 1956 in Lancaster New Hampshire to Merle and Arleta (Gunther) Allin. His name was changed to Kevin Michael Allin by the time he entered school, but went by the name nickname,”G.G.”\n\nDespite living with an reportedly abusive father (who appears to have suffered from a mental illness), G.G. appears to have led a fairly normal childhood, once his mother divorced and remarried. G.G. played the drums in his high school band. His first rock band was called G.G. Allin and the Jabbers. Over time his performances developed into an “extreme” musical act including on stage nudity, assault of others and mutilation of himself. G.G. was arrested 52 times, and served several jail terms for disorderly conduct, assault, indecent exposure, drunk and disorderly, violating parole, and attempted murder. One of those arrests was in 1986 in Manchester NH for disorderly conduct, where he paid a fine, but did no jail time.\n\nIn a television interview on the Jerry Springer Show, G.G. stated, “”My mission is to put danger back into rock and roll.” He died of a drug overdose in New York City on June 28, 1993. He was 36 years, 9 months and 30 days old.\n\nG.G. continued to shock, even after his death. At his funeral, his corpse was dressed in a black leather jacket and a jock strap, and a bottle of Jim Beam was placed beside him in his casket, as per his wishes (openly stated in his song, “When I Die”). GG Allin was buried July 3, 1993 in the Saint Rose Cemetery in Littleton, NH.\n\nJanice\n\n**Additional Reading**\n\n(Caution: These links lead to potentially offensive Material)\n\n–AOL Music Biography of G.G.
