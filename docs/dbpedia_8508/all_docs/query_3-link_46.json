GG Allin was best known for his notorious live performances, which often featured transgressive acts, including coprophagia, self-mutilation, and attacking audience members, for which he was arrested and imprisoned on multiple occasions. AllMusic and G4TV's That's Tough have called him \"the most spectacular degenerate in rock & roll history\" and the \"toughest rock star in the world\", respectively.\n\nKnown more for his notorious stage antics than for his music, he recorded prolifically, not only in the punk rock genre, but also in spoken word, country, and more traditional-style rock. His lyrics, which often expressed themes of misogyny, pedophilia, blasphemy and racism, polarized listeners and created varied opinions of him within the highly politicized punk community. When questioned about his music and shows, Allin often replied that he was trying to make rock music \"dangerous\" again.\n\nAllin's music was often poorly recorded and produced, given limited distribution, and was met with mostly negative reviews from critics, although he maintained a cult following throughout and after his career. Allin promised for several years that he would commit suicide on stage during one of his concerts, but died off-stage of an accidental heroin overdose.\n\nBuried Glenwood Cemetery, Littleton, Grafton, New Hampshire, USA.\n\nSources\n\nSee also:\n\nWikipedia: GG Allin\n\nhttp://allmusic.com/artist/gg-allin-p51370/biography\n\nhttp://www.ggallin.com/\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0021359/"
