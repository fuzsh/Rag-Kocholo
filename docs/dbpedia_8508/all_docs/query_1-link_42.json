        "text": "The other day, my friend’s toddler took off his swimming suit and pooped on the sidewalk in his backyard, just a few feet from his little blow-up pool. Without missing a beat, my friend said, \"Who do you think you are, GG Allin?\"\n\nIt had been years since I thought about the notorious GG Allin show at the long gone Odd Rock Café (originally Café Voltaire), 2010 S. Kinnickinnic Ave.\n\nI didn't attend the Allin show -- it took place before I figured out how to weasel my underaged self into clubs -- but I have heard a lot of shocking stories from that evening.\n\nIn March of 1989, Allin -- a punk rock shock performance artist -- caused quite a commotion when he crapped on stage and then threw his feces at the audience. This was nothing new for Allin, who had a history of including blood, urine and fecal matter in his live shows.\n\nJack Koshik, the owner of the Odd Rock, allegedly stopped the show. A couple of years later, Allin was charged with disorderly conduct and public indecency in a Milwaukee courtroom, and he was sentenced to 90 days in prison and a $1,000 fine.\n\nAfter his sentencing, Allin wrote the song \"Shove That Warrant Up Your Ass,\" that specifically mentions Milwaukee.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Allin was born to an abusive and religious father who named him Jesus Christ Allin. His name was later shortened to \"GG\" when his younger brother couldn't pronounce \"Jesus.\" The family lived in a cabin without electricity or running water in rural New Hampshire.\n\nAllin threatened to commit suicide on stage on Halloween Night, 1990, but did not follow through. Instead, he overdosed in 1993."
