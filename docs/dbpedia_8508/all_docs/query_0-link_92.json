        "text": "Hey Captain, hope you are well! Great question and I'm sure you will get many different answers. Thrash is my favorite of the genres you mentioned; however, it was highly influenced by both Punk and Speed Metal. I will make over-simplifications to give a general idea of what distinguishes these genres, as there are always exceptions to the rule...and I'm sure many other forum members will kindly point them out (thanks in advance, guys!). I will say will confidence that all three genres share a few common traits: passion and ATTITUDE!!! For me, personally, I don't let genres or sub-genres get in the way of enjoying ass-kicking music!\n\nPunk, I'm sure, is many things to many different people and you can sort bands into as many sub-categories and sub-genres as you see fit. For me, it is my least explored genre of the three and I have only scratched the surface, but I think I know it when I hear it. Since I am no expert, I will simply cheat and give you a succinct definition I culled from Wikipedia: \"Punk bands typically produced short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.\" Although this might not always be the case, this is at least one one to explain it. Songs by The Sex Pistols, Ramones, The Clash, etc., will probably sound a bit different than bands like Black Flag, The Dead Kennedys, The Misfits, or G.G. Allin, but they are definitely different than what I heard from Speed or Thrash.\n\nSpeed Metal, is in my opinion, quite different than Punk. It's generally faster, but with a different kind of aggression than Punk (particularly when it comes to the vocal delivery), and often embraces melody and more technical solos. Some would describe it as Heavy Metal (like Dio or Priest), but much faster. I would say there is often a blurred line when people reference Speed Metal and Thrash, and often bands get lumped into both categories. To me, bands that are Speed (and not considered Thrash) would be Exciter, Anvil, Helloween, and on some albums, Riot. These guys all played fast, but seemed to rely a bit less on palm-muted, chugging riffs for impact. The vocals are usually categorized by, perhaps, a bit less snarl and venom than their Thrash counterparts. Some would consider Motorhead a Speed Metal band, but I think Lemmy would just say their a Rock N Roll band. There are quite a few bands that I wouldn't categorize as Speed Metal that had Speed Metal songs, like Accept's \"Fast as a Shark\" or even Judas Priest's \"Painkiller.\" Some would even argue that there are quite a few Power Metal bands that were Speed Metal, and I'm ok with that, too.\n\nThrash is a celebration of both Punk and Speed. It is often fast and aggressive and relies on the almighty \"Power of the Riff\" to get your neck snapping. Solos are often highlighted and can be melodic, technical, shredding, or a complete cat-strangling. I think folks here would look at Metallica's Kill'em All as a good starting point. Vocals are usually less melodic and often spat out, shouted out, or snarled with a good bit of anger and angst. For me, it's the riffs that dominate Thrash and make it unique: simple or complex, they just hook you in with palm-muted, staccatoed impact or with a big fat groove. All early albums by the Big 4 offer something unique, as do the work of Exodus, Testament, Overkill, Sodom, Destruction, and Kreator...the list goes on and on. Metallica's \"Whiplash\" would be a prime example for speed, Overkill's \"Horroscope\" would be a great grooving crawler. Out of all three genres here, I think Thrash raises the bar when it comes to musical technicality...particularly with the drumming and complexity of songwriting.\n\nI hope this is helpful. It's a bit of a generalization and there are a lot of other sub-genres and sub-categories, but I think discussing them all right here, right now, would lead you further down the rabbit hole and a bit away from your original question. The main thing is to listen to what YOU like and not worry about how anybody categorizes it.\n\nMETAL for Life!!!!\n\nI agree with you otherwise, except that the term thrash was also in use at least since '84, and by '88 if not earlier was already the prevailing term. I have a stack of Kerrangs and Metal Hammers to back up my memory. It was definitely often used interchangably with speed metal, sometimes even death metal, which got its modern meaning somewhere around the Florida invasion of the late eighties. In the mid eighties \"death metal\" and \"black metal\" referred more to the lyrical content. Sodom used to be called death metal, black metal, and thrash, probably speed as well.\n\nKerrang! No 80, November 1, 1984:\n\n\"Well, for the wimps amongst you, Thrash Metal or Death/Speed Metal, whatever you want to call it, is the truest form of Heavy Metal - Metal at its fastest and heaviest...\"\n\nThe article is called \"Thrash Metal Roundup\" in the cover, \"Speed Kills\" in the pages, written by Dave Constable, and mentions bands as diverse as Venom, Motörhead, Metallica, Exciter, Warlock, Hellhammer, Acid, Voi Vod, Vulcain and Agent Steel.\n\nIf I had to make a distinction between speed and thrash, in my mind speed would be something cleaner and more melodic and closer to traditional metal, maybe something like early Helloween, as opposed to the full blown thrash of Kreator or Slayer.\n\nAs for punk metal, never heard of it either. Hardcore bands that crossed over to thrash used to be called crossover thrash bands."
