        "text": "Paging All Punks\n\nWelcome to the second installment of Paging All Punks, in which I talk to writers about their connection with punk rock.\n\nI met Emma Alice Johnson in her hometown of Minneapolis a few years ago. Emma’s work is weird—so weird, in fact, that I didn’t have a frame of reference for her writing. After some digging, I discovered her work fits into the bizarre fiction genre. She wears this affiliation to a very specific scene as a badge of honor. Giant lobsters invade cities, zombies populate New York City’s hardcore scene, action figures come to life. It’s by turns grotesque, intense, and hilarious.\n\nIn an attempt to figure out what makes Emma tick, I called her on July 17, 2019. We had a great chat about her fiction and its connection to monolith culture, GG Allin and more. I hope you dig it. You can check Emma’s work out at freaktension.wordpress.com.\n\nMike: Emma, which came first for you: writing or punk rock?\n\nEmma: Writing was first. I fell in love with it as soon as I realized what storytelling was. I knew this was going to be the focus as soon as I could hold a pencil.\n\nMike: It sounds like that was really early in your youth.\n\nEmma: I started writing when I was literally three or four years old. A lot of it was my grandfather. We would sit around and make up stories and draw pictures to accompany them. I have memories of pages and pages of paper strewn across the basement floor of my grandparents’ house, covered with robots that we drew and storylines to go with them.\n\nMike: As you were doing creative things with your grandparents, did you have an urge to keep the stuff or bind it? Or was it more disposable?\n\nEmma: It was very disposable. I’ve retained very little of it. My parents are moving today, so I had to take a lot of stuff that I had been storing from their house and go through it. I found some stories I wrote as a kid: grade school, kindergarten, before. There’s always pictures. I was big on art, too.\n\nTo circle back to the question, I still feel like it’s very disposable. Ninety percent of what I write is forgotten, left in a hard drive somewhere. To me, the joy of it is in the creation. There’s a lot of fun in producing it and bringing it to publication, but the main impetus is the creation and the joy of telling the story, getting it on paper and making it vivid and fun.\n\nMike: Dovetailing off my original question, which came first: getting the work out there, or punk rock?\n\nEmma: Punk rock came first.\n\nMike: How did that happen?\n\nEmma: I got into punk pretty early. I’d say later grade school years. I was obsessed with monsters, and my skater friend’s older brother was listening to the Misfits. I found my way to them—they felt like the perfect band for me (and they still do). So I got into punk rock, DIY, and zines. I saw people putting out their own publications! I was like, “Why don’t I do that?” So I started doing a zine, and there would be a short story in there, goofy true life tales, and random nonsense. Music reviews, of course—what punk rock zine from the ’90s didn’t have them?\n\nMike: Was that Freak Tension that you’re talking about?\n\nEmma: That was, yeah!\n\nMike: Can you give me a brief overview of it?\n\nEmma: I started working on the first issue in ’96 or ’97. I read about the Small Press Co-Op in either Maximum Rock’n’roll or Slug And Lettuce. They were printing zines really cheap, and did a lot of assembly work. I would send them very rough mock-ups and they would turn them into something cool-looking. I didn’t believe in selling them back then, so I’d go to punk shows and give them out. People got into it.\n\nI finally wrapped it up six or seven years ago with issue fifteen. By that time the Small Press Co-Op had closed down, so I was doing photocopies, which ultimately I think I liked better. I liked the tactile aspect of holding and stapling. Something about that was really fulfilling to me.\n\nMike: Were you in Minneapolis when you started publishing?\n\nEmma: I was in Eau Claire, Wis., which is where I was born and raised. Eau Claire had a nice scene with some cool DIY stuff, but shows weren’t frequent enough so we’d drive to Minneapolis, too.\n\nMike: Were there any bands or zines in Eau Claire that I might recognize?\n\nEmma: Oh gosh… no! [laughs]\n\nI mean, I’m sure there were. It was a cool, small town scene where everyone had a band at some point. I was in a band for like three practices and we were a saxophone noise punk band or something. It didn’t get off the ground.\n\nEau Claire could have probably done more in terms of a scene. But we were good at bringing bands from the cities. There were cool shows. The Varukers played there really early in my show-going days. That was hugely influential.\n\nWisconsin had the Beer City Records scene going on, so all these hardcore bands from Kenosha like 1096 and Urban Decay defined what I wanted to see: bloody, messy, dirty punk and hardcore.\n\nMike: That’s very much in line with conversations you and I have had about GG Allin.\n\nEmma: Absolutely! I’m an unapologetic GG Allin fangirl. I understand absolutely everything that’s sketchy about him, but I love him.\n\nMike: Did you move from Minneapolis to Eau Claire?\n\nEmma: I moved to Green Bay, Wis. first. It’s funny, because growing up in Eau Claire, I had this idea that Green Bay was a big city, so I moved there. Green Bay did have an absolutely amazing punk rock scene in the late ’90s and into the early 2000s with the Concert Café, which was my favorite venue in the world: shows every night, bands coming from all over the country. I moved there on the tail end of that scene, which was more pop punk and garage rock oriented.\n\nI fell in with a group of scummy hardcore kids. We were doing basement shows and smashing bottles and getting into fights, that whole thing. I did that for about six years, and moved over to Minneapolis, and here I am.\n\nMike: I think of Minneapolis as having this mystique because of Hüsker Dü and the Replacements. Did you have any sense of that mythology when you were involved in the scene there?\n\nEmma: Not really. [laughs]\n\nI mean, there was discussion about those bands, and their shadow, but it felt very this is happening now. And at least among the people I hung out with, it was more about the contemporary bands. It was about Man Afraid and the Saltines and Dillinger Four and Lifter Puller and Selby Tigers.\n\nI didn’t start digging into Hüsker Dü until much later. I’ve since fallen in love with them, especially the Grant Hart side of the discography.\n\nMike: Did you go to that reading I did with Grant in Minneapolis?\n\nEmma: I didn’t! Why didn’t I go to that? Was I not here?\n\nMike: It was at the AWP conference in Minneapolis. That was the first time we met.\n\nEmma: It was because I was hosting a different reading that night. I was hosting something at Grumpy’s and you were at Patrick’s Cabaret.\n\nMike: I read about your reading at Grumpy’s online. Everyone was talking about how awesome and performative it was. Is that your standard method when you do readings?\n\nEmma: It used to be. I fell in with the bizarre fiction family or subgenre. It feels like a community to me. It’s a group of writers who are all doing aggressively weird fiction that doesn’t fall into the borders of horror or sci-fi or other genres that might be considered weird. Historically, it’s about having these performances. There are legends of people like Cameron Pierce having readings where raw meat is thrown around—craziness. The godfather of bizarre fiction was Carlton Mellick. He goes into this character every time he does a reading, and it’s so larger than life. Discovering that blew my mind, because I had spent time in the academic side of things, going to the university where people did readings in a monotone, staring at the podium. Having spent so much time in punk rock, it was hard for me to connect with those sorts of events.\n\nI fell in love with bizarro. It’s very crowd-involved, a lot of movement, a lot of energy. I started bringing a lot of that into my performances: a lot of yelling, a lot of moving around, smashing things. Wild and crazy in the spectrum of literature readings.\n\nMike: Your love of that splatterpunk genre musically seems like it translated well to the bizarre fiction world.\n\nEmma: It did! There’s been discussion of this recently: what it’s like to shock an audience. Some of my writing is very shock oriented, but that’s never been my goal. It’s just how it turns out because of my influences.\n\nGG Allin thought it was his mission to shock people. But he was putting himself in front of crowds that typically expected it, so how shocking is it to give people what they’re expecting?\n\nPeople don’t expect it from literature. There are a lot of people who go to readings who don’t expect people to be jumping on top of chairs and stuff. I try to play it very fun. It’s sharing these stories in a vivid and energetic way. I’m not trying to piss people off. I know people get upset because my readings defy their expectations. But that was never my goal.\n\nMike: In terms of live performances of bizarre punk and some of the stuff you did, it seems in line with you as a little child, finding joy in creating stuff. It seems like there’s a link there.\n\nEmma: It’s all very of the moment. It’s easy to talk about writing as this laborious thing where you’re sitting in front of the computer, pounding keys. That’s what’s happening in the physical realm. What’s happening in the mental and emotional realm is this wild adventure that keeps moving forward. It’s only when you get into the more mechanical aspect of editing and refining when it becomes this process. The initial process is of the moment: let’s write down these stories, and if I ever come back to make them something publishable, so be it. If not, it served its purpose for me.\n\nPerformances, too. Get up onstage. Share this moment. Have these wild laughs together and let it pass. There were always people who wanted to record performances. I feel this way about punk rock shows, too. They’re both of the moment. You’re there. It’s not the same to watch it on YouTube. I understand that there are ableist connotations to that accessibility and whatnot, but I feel like it’s something to be present for.\n\nMike: How do you decide to transition any of the work you present in a live setting to the books you publish?\n\nEmma: It’s entirely random. I’m occasionally more cutthroat about deciding what I’m going to write if there’s an anthology call looking for stories in a certain theme. I take that as the kernel and have my fun with it. If I feel like that’s something I can eventually sell, that’s going to get my attention and I’m going to refine that, versus the stories that I love so much that come to me when I’m waking up in the morning or going to sleep and I run to a notepad and start scribbling it down.\n\nAfter the creation is over, if I look back and if I think it’s something that would be fun to share, that someone else is going to enjoy, it represents what I’m doing and I can find a place for it, then I’ll take it to that next step. I’ll go through of the real work of writing: refining it so that joy I had writing it translates to the reader.\n\nMike: There was a lot of wild stuff in Berzerkoids, but there was other stuff which was, for a lack of a better term, very MFA program in tone. The amount of control you have over genre and the way you distribute it throughout the book was fantastic. There’s a wide range of influences there.\n\nEmma: Thank you! That’s my goal. There are certain hallmarks that I go for in my stories. They could spread from something gross and gory, with slime spewing everywhere, to something that’s more quiet and thoughtful and confined. That’s something which is pushing me and helping me have fun—exploring these different corners of what I can do, and pushing myself to new places, new genres, tones, and emotions expressed.\n\nMike: What projects are you working on right now?\n\nEmma: I have so many things on a burner! I’m working on a new chapbook, which will be my comeback. It’s called Melt Girl, and that’s going to collect new and older, harder-to-find short stories. I’m going to do that DIY style—stapled and photocopied, and distribute that.\n\nI’m really focusing my attention on short stories. I came to an understanding that at the end of the day, they’re what I love. I know that novels tend to be more popular in a lot of ways, but short stories are where I have the most fun. I have a lot of them coming out in a lot of fun, themed anthologies: I have a short story coming out in a book called Tales from the Crust, which is all pizza-themed horror. I’m excited about that. A book called The New Flesh is coming out and has one of my short stories. It’s all short stories inspired by David Cronenberg, who was one of my first loves when I fell in love with weird movies. And there’s a book called Rosalind’s Siblings, which is all feminist science stories about female, nonbinary, and queer scientists in various settings. My story is about a scientist who’s hired to understand the tendencies of giant lobsters invading a city to help determine scientifically how to deal with them. It’s the story I’m most proud of because of the beautiful turn it takes. It was very fulfilling for me to write.\n\nMike: You said your chapbook will be your comeback. What do you mean by that?\n\nEmma: It’s my first chapbook under my real name, Emma Alice Johnson. I had previously written under a pseudonym that I no longer use or want to reference. I’m leaving that behind and starting fresh. This chapbook will be the first release under my new name.\n\nMike: Doing this comeback chapbook under your real name—how much of the audience’s expectations are you anticipating? Do you think there’s going to be pushback? Do you think it’s going to be hard to re-establish yourself with your new, proper name? What do you think it’s going to be like?\n\nEmma: I’m just not worried about it. [laughs]"
