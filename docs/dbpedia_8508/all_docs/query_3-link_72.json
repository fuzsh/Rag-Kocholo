        "text": "A jam-packed, full-ass-length episode of the Kings of Punk Podcast tackling a backlog of listener emails that's been piling up since the previous \"Mailbag\" episode in November of 2023. Your favorite hardcore punk and subculture commentary troika dive headfirst into the inbox to address your burning questions, impassioned rants, and hilarious stories (introducing Volume 1 of \"The Coworker Chronicles\") - expect both the width and breadth of topics to exceed mere hard core musings.\n\nIn addition, the troika shares some big news about the future of the podcast. For reasons that will become clear during the episode, they plan on taking a brief hiatus after this dip into the mailbag. Don't worry, punk's not dead and it's not the end of the world (or the podcast) - they plan to return be better than ever with new episodes and more hardcore and punk rock insight.\n\nWebsite: KingsOfPunk.com\n\nIG: https://www.instagram.com/koppodofficial/\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPj6iMRyW0GAJnxv9i7TAdQ\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6bSFPxIqSr6kxkgqsRZBvN\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-kings-of-punk/id1541490418\n\nKOPPOD's latest installment in their \"Legacy of...\" series delves into the influential sounds of 80s straight edge titans, Youth of Today. A band known for their raw energy and impactful lyrics, this edition promises to explore the impact and legacy of a group that helped shape the hardcore music genre and subculture. The Kings of Punk trace the band's journey from Danbury, CT to a central role in New York's punk underground alongside greats like Agnostic Front, with the group developing their sound and making a greater and greater impact on the American hardcore scene as they developed the straight edge ethos pioneered by hardcore musicians like Ian Mackaye and Kevin Seconds. The band's relationship with Krishna Consciousness and role in the early development of \"Krishnacore\" also receives some attention. Stay tuned for an in-depth journey through the roots of both the \"Youth Crew\" subculture and the subgenre associated with it.\n\nWebsite: kingsofpunk.com\n\nIG: @koppodofficial\n\nOur team at KOPPOD Punk Podcast apologize for the delay in releasing this episode; we put great effort into providing you with a great episode every week, but balancing this with other endeavors sometimes proves infeasible - especially when we add special musical intros for special episodes, the creation of which does NOT waste two of our hours and will NOT waste two of your minutes for no reason whatsoever.\n\nAnyway, just in time for April, enjoy the FINALS of our MARCH MAYHEM series. 9 SHOCKS TERROR, BASTARD, POISON IDEA, and INITIAL STATE find themselves seated upon the scales of judgement as the troika makes their final selection. Give it a listen and let us know what you think!\n\nPRANK RECORDS TOP 100: https://prankrecords.blogspot.com/2012/10/best-of-90s-diy-hardcore-top-100.html\n\nKingsofpunk.com\n\n@koppodofficial on IG\n\nthe KOPPOD TROIKA push through the next two rounds of MARCH MAYHEM, lots of hard decisions on this very hardcore podcast. Heavy hitters pitted against one another; classic records revered by old school listeners and new generations alike. How do these three guys judge this segment of DIY HC History? Stay tuned as they delve into the essence of this music and emerge with their verdicts. Who will reach the Semifinals? and the FINAL? Give it a listen and find out. Get ready for deep dives and disruptive upsets, as you've come to expect from the KINGS OF PUNK PODCAST\n\nPRANK RECORDS TOP 100: https://prankrecords.blogspot.com/2012/10/best-of-90s-diy-hardcore-top-100.html\n\nKingsofpunk.com\n\n@koppodofficial on IG\n\nThe heaviest of hitters go head-to-head, with upsets and cinderella runs to boot! In this round, our returning guest Mike from the First Seven Inch Club podcast tags in for every matchup - taking the place of one of your beloved KOPPOD co-hosts (chosen at random), and bringing his perspective to these hardcore clashes. This round includes more excitement and tension than either of the first two rounds. Wanna find out who moves forward and who gets left behind? Give it a listen!\n\nFirst Seven Inch Club: https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/9ehaq-52351/First-Seven-Inch-Club-%28AKA-Border-Boss%29-Podcast\n\n@firstseveninchclub on Instagram\n\nKingsofpunk.com\n\n@koppodofficial on IG\n\nIts a bit before March but the March Mayhem series has begun! The first round pits 72 records against each other and the Kings make the arduous trudge through the first round with the help of Special Referee Conner. Who will come out on top? Listen and find out, and let us know how wrong we are at Kingsofpunk.com or on instagram @koppodofficial\n\nThe kings are joined by special guest Conner to do a dive into longtime punk label Prank Records. Founder Ken Sanderson brought to light a myriad of bands from all over the world onto wax, as well as some significant reissues over the years. We discuss some of our favorite releases from his label as well as his Best of 90s DIY Hardcore Top 100 list as well which we will be doing this year for our March Mayhem series.\n\nKingsofpunk.com\n\n@koppodofficial on IG\n\nhttps://prankrecords.blogspot.com/2012/10/best-of-90s-diy-hardcore-top-100.html\n\nThe KOPPOD Troika revisits a previous segment where we explore the history of punk within a city this time choosing the \"Mistake by the Lake\" that is Cleveland, OH. Its a place that is oft maligned and misunderstood, and the hosts divulge their history with the city, the music, and the people and dive into some history of proto-, and proper punk.\n\nMarch Mayhem Poll https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/9458c23c71d24dfbb81d69329bd578cf\n\nAnd as always, kingsofpunk.com for more info, feedback, etc.\n\nA new episode on Monday, which we plan on making the norm going forward. THE KINGS start their episode with a brief tribute to deceased rock/proto-punk legend WAYNE KRAMER of the MC5. Brother Wayne pioneered the sound of punk rock and without him, we might not be doing any of this stuff.\n\nAfter that, the KINGS delve into morbid recent events - specifically, the alleged crimes of one Justin Mohn. Justin Mohn, a now-infamous \"overeducated white man\", declared war on the United States Federal Government in a YouTube video posted to social media. The same YouTube video also featured Justin showing off his father Michael Mohn's (an Army Corps of Engineers employee) decapitated head in a plastic bag. Authorities found a large kitchen knife at the scene of the crime (which Justin Mohn had fled, headed for a National Guard Training Center - presumably targeting more federal employees). Grim stuff.\n\nBut this isn't \"Kings of True Crime\", this is a punk rock podcast. A music podcast more broadly. Your cohosts focus on Pennsylvania man Justin Mohn's very unique musical offerings. Justin Mohn's music, characterized by haunting melodies and thought-provoking lyrics, challenges conventional norms and pushes boundaries. That last sentence? That's how Justin Mohn's music should have been pitched when Justin Mohn emailed record labels. As you'll learn in this episode, the emails he actually sent did not say that. The KINGS compare his music with that of other musicians who killed people, and begin to touch on the concept of \"Outsider Music\".\n\nIn this latest serving of the Kings of Punk Podcast, your hosts go full-throttle into unpleasant territory. The first half of the podcast sees them dissect the eyebrow-raising, discourse-provoking fashion choice made by Kanye West - spotted rocking a t-shirt for contentious, notorious, neuroatypical Black Metal artist BURZUM. Expect a mix of incisive commentary and indecent banter as always.\n\nIn the second half of this episode, the Kings of Punk switch gears to thrash the musical monstrosity that is 'Punk Goes Crunk.' If you've ever wondered why this album even exists, you're not alone: your hosts pose the questions, \"Who thought this was a good idea? Who the fuck greenlit this?\" They explore how this ill-conceived album, which butchered rap (not \"crunk\") by forcibly fusing it with the worst music ever (whatever it is, not \"punk\"), has unfortunately influenced music. Prepare for a hilarious, perhaps grueling at times, listen as the KINGS move in for the KILL.\n\nA return to your regularly scheduled programming... or at least, a program that was scheduled ahead of time. But nothing \"regular\" to be found here... THE KINGS offer an overview of the OUTLAW SCUMFUC himself. A daunting task and an episode sure to provoke listeners and elicit strong opinions, just like the man himself. Please do share those opinions with the Troika via kingsofpunk.com and/or @koppodofficial on Instagram.\n\nAfter a few freeform epsiodes, the Kings conspire this week to discuss the 'Libero De Vivere / Libero De Morire' Album by Wretched. Perhaps overlooked in the modern streaming era, these punks from Milan, Italy would be a great start for anyone looking to get into something a little deeper than what you might find on an 80s HC playlist.\n\nStream/Download the album here: https://hdkpkk.bandcamp.com/album/pkk1-libero-di-vivere-libero-di-morire-1984\n\nThe veil grows thin, and the KOPPOD troika grew anxious to peel it back and examine a singular Los Angeles musical outfit. The absence of an episode last week no doubt caused some distress among our listeners, but hopefully no one wished for death without a new episode. This one makes up for it and then some; a real-deal deep dive into Christian Death, including an examination of other projects including Rozz Williams (RIP). Give it a listen and enjoy the holiday.\n\nKOPPOD's Jake Razor conducts an interview with none other than GARRY BUSHELL. If you listened to Part One, you learned a bit about Garry; he managed the COCKNEY REJECTS, he curated the iconic 'Strength Thru Oi!' compilation (and the other great compilations in that series), he sang for the GONADS, and as a SOUNDS journalist he penned a mountain of words championing punk rock's misunderstood underdogs and UK subculture's quixotic tribespeople. This work and more continues to this day as Garry remains an active writer. For his part, Jake picks the man's brain about the austerity of 70s Britain, UK youth subculture tribes, reggae, punks vs. skinheads, and... British Trotskyite sects, briefly. Maybe we can get his take on Enver Hoxha next time. For now, check out this episode to hear a true powerhouse share insight on the aforementioned topics and much more.\n\nGarry's website: http://www.garry-bushell.co.uk/\n\nMusic featured in this episode:\n\n\"TNT\" by the Gonads (ft. our guest)\n\n\"Punk Rock Will Never Die\" by the Gonads (you already know)\n\n\"Inner London Violence\" by Bad Manners (not ft. Garry Bushell, but an appropriate interlude after the first half)\n\nNEW STICKERS!!!: https://kingsofpunkpodcast.bigcartel.com/product/kill-your-local-band-sticker\n\nInstagram: @koppodofficial\n\nWebsite: kingsofpunk.com\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@kingsofpunkpodcast4349\n\nThe KOPPOD lads lead you on an overdue journey to late-70s England. This guided tour allows you to observe the birth of a sub-genre and subculture which left permanent marks on punk rock as a whole; bruises, tattoos, missing teeth, and much more. Part 1 of a 3-part series, this episode tackles the second-wave punk groups which served as the blueprint for Oi! bands to follow. Give it a listen and find out where all the bootboys came from.

A metaphorical sojourn through the sights, sounds, words, and rhythms of the scenic, historic scene/musical style known as TROY-CORE. Fans of our earlier \"Intro to Metalcore\" episodes ought to like this one; Troy-Core inhabits a specific and crucial corner within the realm of 90s hardcore. If this \"TROY-CORE\" talk is all Greek to you, just give this episode a listen and the KINGS will provide the clarification you need. Is \"TROY-CORE\" a good type of music? Or is it a Trojan Horse smuggling James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Rob Trujillo into the Hardcore scene, right through the gates of Troy, NY?
