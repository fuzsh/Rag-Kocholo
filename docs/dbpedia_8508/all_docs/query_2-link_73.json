        "text": "Mary-Beth said:\n\nOh right, musical preferences.\n\nI like all music. The stack of CD's by my stereo consists mostly metal, but (off the top of my head) there's Billy Holiday, Janis Joplin, Mozart, Faith Hill, and Devo mixed in.\n\nYep. Same here. You could grab a stack of CD's from the pile and be completely confused about what I like. I grabbed some to take to work without really looking the other day and I ended up with Primus, Cherry Popping Daddys, Led Zeppelin, Rocky Horror Picture Show Soundtrack, The Eagles, Metallica, The Cars, Blondie, The Phantom of the Opera Soundtrack, and Violent Femmes. My coworkers just scratch their heads.\n\nUnfortunately, all our local radio stations stink. They have a library of like 20 of the latest songs that they play over and over until you hate the song. The most annoying thing is, once in awhile one of the radio stations will dig up something that I actually havn't heard in awhile and I really enjoy.... then suddenly all three of the stations I rotate to will suddenly play that song through out the week. They all spy on each other and all copy each other. Makes for terribly boring listening. So most of the time I listen to Jack.\n\nhttp://tuner1.dc1.sonixtream.com/SOLON/media/tuner/Tuner?aff=931jackfm\n\nYou just never know what will come on, and I like that.\n\nI'll give anything a listen to, quite diverse when it comes to music.\n\nAt the mo I've got Eddie Halliwells Radio 1 show from last thursday on, but was listening to Tom Petty about half an hour ago. Tiesto always puts a smile on my face with adagio. I'm going see himin scallyland in 2 weeks!! Woot!\n\nSometimes I'm in the mood for easy listening, sometimes some good old rock and indie, and at others I go for Hard-house. I also like a bit of Neophyte when I'm really in the mood for blocking out the rest of the world.\n\nOh, and as someone else mentioned before, Devvo of course. Taking (you know whatsits) with Bob Marley is an absolute class tune.\n\nPrimarily time-wise I listen to what they call \"Industrial Ambient\", wife and I like to think of it as \"mood music for burnouts\" although we copped that phrase from one of the founders of Newbury Comics which is basically the best music store ever and what I miss most about Boston. Bands with 20+ cd's in our collection are: Rapoon, Swans, Controlled Bleeding (last two predate the IA phase, which started in '97 or so). Plenty of rock too alternative for radio tastes, mostly from the 80's when I was listening to college radio in Boston.\n\nAlas, Thug was the best band ever, but only produced two albums. Wonderful blurb about them here about a third of the way down.\n\nWe have some jazz - I prefer the later Miles Davis material, and a fair amount of classical. Bartok is my favorite in that category, but we've got everything from Bach to Babbitt and Part.\n\n-Sean\n\nI like some of a lot of genres- Alternative, whatever you call Joe Satriani/Steve Vai/Yngwei Malmsteen, have gotten to like some metal. Some country- used to like that exclusively, but had a sudden change in 1997- don't know why. Right now my favorite band is the Holy Rollin' Hellfires. I'm pretty into Podcasts, though- which have taken the place of most music. I'll listen to three or four Podcasts, then have two or three songs mixed in, then more Podcasts. Seems like I'm liking a lot of Yellowcard, too. Southern Culture On The Skids.\n\nNanci\n\nI am the most eclectic person I know when it comes to music. First and foremost, I have not yet met a rock band I really cannot stand. I enjoy modern rock (Good Charlotte, Nickelback, Three Days Grace, Cross Fade), classic rock (Guns-N-Roses, Aerosmith, Pearl Jam), some moderately hard rock/heavy metal, such as Breaking Benjamin, Audioslave, Story of the Year etc. I enjoy alternative music such as Green Day, The Killers, Kasabian, and Fall Out Boy. I also love country, and there are very few country artistis I don't like. Some of my favorites include Kenny Chesney, Rascal Flatts, Keith Urban, Carrie Underwood and Martina McBride.\n\nOther genres that appear on my shelf include rap-ISH music (Linkin Park and Fort Minor), and odds and ends such as Gavin DeGraw, Jason Mraz, Journey, etc.\n\nI guess I'll represent the Arabic music scene, then. Really, I do listen to quite a few groups/singers from Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Egypt, etc...in fact, I've studied belly dancing now for 3+ years. So not only do I listen to it and can occasionally make out some of the words despite not knowing Arabic, I can also move & groove with the best of the dancers. A Moroccan ex-boyfriend even told me that I'm more Arabic than he is -- and he grew-up there!\n\nOtherwise, I listen to what I grew-up with: 70's German pop-rock, ABBA, Beethoven, and 80's pop/dance/new wave/hair metal...90's stuff is mostly European pop/dance with the occasional country song (hey, I was traveling to Europe a bit along with residing in WI...!)...and in this century, Arabic dance/pop along with some folk music (Nubian dance is a blast! I also love Melaya & Saidi...the classical stuff is pretty, but I suck with a veil...I'm not good with zils either, but so much more fun ), European classical music, and the only group that I can think of right now, the Scissor Sisters\n\nI love most music. I just say I like rock-- classic rock, hard rock, oldies, metal-- anything that falls in there. And instrumental rock-- I have everything by Joe Satriani, because his music tears at my heart like no music with words could ever do.\n\nLately, I've been switching between Pantera and The Cure.\n\nLove music in other languages-- I just think it sounds pretty. There's a local singer/guitar player here in Boston that sings only in French, and he's amazing. [..but I can't find him. He supposedly hangs out in Harvard Square, but I've visited several times JUST to find him, and I can't. I want to buy his CD.. ]\n\nTeratoma said:\n\nPrimarily time-wise I listen to what they call \"Industrial Ambient\", wife and I like to think of it as \"mood music for burnouts\" although we copped that phrase from one of the founders of Newbury Comics which is basically the best music store ever and what I miss most about Boston.\n\nNewbury Comics is wonderful.\n\n..is it just a Massachusetts thing? I know it's scattered all over-- there's a few stores on the North Shore, where I used to live, and I obviously see 'em here in Boston..\n\nalyndria said:\n\n(...)\n\nNewbury Comics is wonderful.\n\n..is it just a Massachusetts thing? I know it's scattered all over-- there's a few stores on the North Shore, where I used to live, and I obviously see 'em here in Boston..\n\nWell, their site has a \"retail locations\" link, and it looks like they are represented in all of the New England states except Vermont, but nowhere else. I started buying comics there in '83 or so, when they had little store in the Garage in Harvard Square, and they kept expanding until they moved to the other side of the floor, where they are now. I think it was biggest back when they had a lot of records and a lot of cd's, but I don't miss records at all. Mind you I still have a bunch...\n\nbtw, I was wondering where you went. Welcome back.\n\n-Sean\n\nHa, I admit I didn't even click the link-- and I had no clue they've been around so long. Wow. I wish they still had records.. one of my roommates has a record player that we keep in the living room, but we only have a small collection of records. It's not used often.\n\nbtw, I was wondering where you went. Welcome back.\n\nThanks. I'm surprised you noticed I disappeared! I picked up a second job about a month and a half back. Being an adult takes up all my free time!\n\nalyndria said:\n\nI love most music. I just say I like rock-- classic rock, hard rock, oldies, metal-- anything that falls in there.

Blues, Afro-Carribean, pop....and it's got a nice beat and is easy to dance to.\n\nregards,\n\njazz\n\nI'm with Jenn on this one, and listen to just about everything from one end of the spectrum to the other... I love all the stations on xm radio, (except country and rap), and find myself on Ethel, (Alt), and Real Jazz most of the time. I have over 8000 MP3's stored on my external drive and burn some crazy comps too...\n\nI just went through a lounge/world music/acid jazz, (Buddha Bar, Cafe Del Mar, OM Lounge, etc), phase, and now I'm wearing out \"She Wants Revenge\". They remind me of 80's alternative with S&M overtones....\n\nI always have some techno in rotation and my coworkers say the only thing my office is missing is glow sticks and strobe lights.... of course I leave the hardcore industrial at home... don't want to scare the office girls too much...\n\nOh Jenn, did you see Cirque is doing a Beatles tribute? Can't wait for that sound track..."
