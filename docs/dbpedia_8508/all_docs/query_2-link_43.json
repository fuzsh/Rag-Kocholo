        "meta_description": "This top 10 list of songs about New York was inspired by a conversation I had with some friends about their desire to leave sunny southern California and relocate to the big apple. This socal native doesn’t get it, I mean, it's not like we're in Lincoln, Nebraska… we're in Los Angeles. I may not understand it but it did inspire me to put together a collection of great songs about New York. <br />\n<br><center><font color=",
