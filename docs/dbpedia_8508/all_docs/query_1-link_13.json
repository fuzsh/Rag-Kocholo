Allin began included shock value in his lyrics with his second album Eat My Fuc. Allin then formed many solo bands starting with GG Allin And The Scumfucs, with whom he released his third album with, You'll Never Tame Me. Completion album Hated In The Nation was released to help give Allin more notoriety. Allin formed another solo band called GG Allin and the Holy Men, with whom he released his fourth album with, You Give Love A Bad Name.
