        "text": "GG Allin\n\nGG Allin (29 August 1956 â€“ 28 June 1993) was a hardcore punk singer and bandleader who performed and recorded with many groups duringhis career.He is best remembered for his notorious live performances that typically featured wildly transgressive acts such as Allin defecatingonstage, committing self harm, performing naked, taunting people to perform fellatio on him, and violent actions towards the audience.Although more notorious for his stage antics than for his wide body of music, he recorded prolifically, not only in the punk rock genre, but also inspoken word, country and western and Rolling Stones-influenced rock."
