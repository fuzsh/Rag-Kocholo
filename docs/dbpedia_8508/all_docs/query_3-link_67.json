        "text": "If you’ve never heard of GG Allin, watch this video before proceeding:\n\nMore of an underground cultural icon than a revered artist, GG Allin is one of the most controversial figures in rock and roll. Whether punching his fans with his microphone during shows, defecating on stage and then hurling his feces into the crowd, or passing out before a show from too much heroin (only to get severely beaten by a dozen fans), Allin was anything but a conventional musician, even for punk standards.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Allin had a political motive behind almost everything that he did. He believed himself to be a rock and roll Messiah of sorts, reclaiming the dying artform from the commercialism and conformity that he saw taking over the genre. His grotesque and controversial onstage performances were in part an adverse reaction to mainstream rock, and a call to anarchy. Throughout his life, Allin was a staunch belief in personal freedom and destructive anarchy. In Todd Philips’ documentary Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies Allin is interviewed during a stay at New York’s St. Marks Hotel. Though I can’t quote directly, Allin claims to live his life in such a way that he is always ready to leave town. Such a lifestyle would be necessary for someone like Allin, who is often evading arrest, but Allin also had a deeper and perhaps more intelligent reason for his ‘pick up and go’ philosophy. He was disgusted by the way that our society was obsessed with consumerism, or “getting shit” as Allin put it. Everything he owned – including a single pair of pants – could fit into a paper bag.\n\nIn the film Hated, Allin also describes hit artistic and personal beliefs as a sort of call to awareness (obviously not his words…) of “a society that’s going crazy with violence.” This aspect of Allin’s philosophy is difficult to digest though. If he was concerned with the increase of violence in our culture, what was he trying to do to change that? How does fighting your audience, inciting riots, and performing perverse sexual acts onstage do anything but perpetuate that violence?\n\nThere is another aspect of Allin’s life that arguably cancels out any admirable political goals he had – constant drug and alcohol use. One gets the sense while watching Hated that GG Allin was rarely, if ever, sober. His onstage antics were fueled by constant alcohol and drug use. Clips of “solo performances” in which a severely drunk Allin mumbles incoherently into a microphone, make him out to be more of a pathetic, troubled addict than a political punk vigilante.\n\nIn June of 1993, at the age of 36, Allin died of a heroin overdose in a Manhattan apartment, after a show that (typically) ended minutes after it began. As Todd Philips describes it at the end of Hated, Allin’s death is perhaps the best argument that his life was far different from the anarchistic rock and roll philosophy that Allin had preached."
