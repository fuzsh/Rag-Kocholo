        "text": "A new biopic based on the life of shock-punk entertainer GG Allin is in the works and being helmed by director Jonas Åkerlund, who recently chronicled the Norwegian black metal scene in his film Lords of Chaos. Producers to the film, Angry Films and MVD Entertainment Group, have acquired Allin’s life and music rights, and have a script written by Richard Schenkman, according to The Hollywood Reporter. There's no word yet, however, on casting.\n\nIn a statement from the producers, Live. Fast. Die. is a story “of what happens to a borderline personality when the reach for fame exceeds the limits of talent… when substance abuse goes unchecked and mental illness undiagnosed and untreated… and when a fictional character takes over a real person’s life, driving GG beyond limits anyone could possibly endure.”\n\nÅkerlund added in a statement, “This is exactly the type of real and raw story I am looking for and this film explores the ugly belly of the beast and how Kevin Allin came to be GG . Punk was already a genre about pushing limits, expanding on musical genres and the definition of artistic expression. At a time when punk was thought to be dead, sold out or too raw to survive, GG came into the scene bleeding, pissing, and sinking like no punk before. Live. Fast. Die. is about a sick person who should have asked for help. GG’s strong persona was a gift, but this borderline personality disorder was not treated, and killed him.”"
