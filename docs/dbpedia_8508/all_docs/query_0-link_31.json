        "text": "Listen to JediHPDRummer, he speaks the truth.\n\nPeople are so funny these days...\n\nI hear it all the time: \"that band's not punk\", \"he's not punk\", that's not what punk supposed to be\"...it's getting pretty pathetic.\n\nTo hear people talk today, you'd think that punk has become the most conservative of all genres.\n\nI'm pretty sure that a band like Good Charlotte would not call themselves punk if they were handling their own business. It's probably the label that insists on calling them punk.\n\nAnother funny thing is that The Clash used to get heat from fans when they ventured into Reggae and Ska. People were like \"that's not punk\". The Clash decided not to care about other people's opinions and do what they felt was right...and that, my friends, is the essence of true punk IMO.\n\nI agree. That's why bands like GC who let their label well... label them is pathetic.\n\nGG Allin didn't even make music, let alone punk. It was the fact that he crapped on stage and threw it at the audience and the fact that in the middle of a song, he would beat a pregnant woman with a ride cymbal stand.\n\nI lived at CBGB's matinees in the late 80s. I did my time in Agnostic Front and Cro Mags pits. Belive me, I know that punk is not a 'style' of music.\n\nIt's a not selling out attitude that is sorely missing in $#!T bands like the ones mentioned in this thread.\n\nThat... and the lack of any sociopolitical relevancy in their lyrics.\n\nSongs about girls are not songs about revolution.\n\nSo, sorry. Your soapbox has been kicked out from under you.\n\nblink-182 no longer calls themselves punk. Their reinvented themselves and they said that they'd like to permanately back away from that genre. They're more alternative rock like Incubus.\n\nGood Charlotte is just bubble gum rock who's biggest fans are middle school-aged girls.\n\nGreen Day is probably the closest thing to punk on there. Yet they still refer to themselves as pop-punk.\n\nI will say that Green Day's and blink's new album really proved that they had talent. Their riffs are heavier and the lyrics are just great. And Travis Barker is probably one of the best drummers in the world. At the Pop Distaster Tour I did an 8 minute drum solo we'll being rotated upside down. And it sounded great. I'd say you'd have more respect for them if you see them live.\n\nGC on the other hand just sucks. I want to shoot the lead singer every time I see him on TV. They dress like goths but who are they fooling?\n\nMaybe i shouldn't of put the album next to Sgt. Pepper or Blonde on Blonde, or Let it Bleed. But I do beleive it will be one of those top albums in the future.\n\nThe Clash got the same treatment as these bands are getting. The Clash went into this interesting original sound during Saddinista.\n\nIt was like Reggae with folk with punk. But the fans said \"this is not punk.\" But does that really matter? Saddanista is one of my favorite albums of all time. I think Green Day is getting there;\n\nMusic is also about evolution imho. I love it when bands are different every album while still having their stamp on each album. When a band makes the same album twice or even thrice, it gets repetetive. One can only think the Beatles. Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt.Pepper, Magical Mystery, White, Abby and Let it Be all had different sounds to their album. Same with Zeppelin or floyd or ELO and many other bands. This is what Blink, GC and GD are trying to do. The new BLink 182 album was full of sound i never thought i would of heard from these guys. I dont like GC, but the new album sounds a little different. And i've already explained the new green day album.\n\nSometimes people don't want a new sound or don't like the way the band is going. And that's fine. But please don't say that their music sucks because they are not punk or don't fit that particular genre. Please keep an openmind.\n\nAnother issue i want to bring up is that these bands are all mainstream. But for some reason people complain that mainstream bands suck for some reason; and how they aren't \"artful\" enough? These people just listen to Indie bands and they get this elitist attitude. These people ar very closeminded and all they accept are indie bands. They can't even give a listen to these new bands. They get into this stereotype that all mainstream albums suck because ??? i dont know what reason?\n\nGranted; I do love many indie bands or Artists like frou frou, koop, madelein peyroux, travis, zero 7, rufus wainwright, ben harper, rilo kiley, bjork, bebel gilberto, jill scott etc...\n\nBut I give these bands the same equal ground as a mainstream band. I also love the shins, green day, oasis, the vines, mosdef. These new mainstream bands and artists are just as good or better than these indie bands. All these bands can be \"Artful\". Whatever that means?\n\nI always find it amusing how people throw around the word \"sellout\" like it's a concept straight from Satan himself.\n\nLet's face it kids: being a sellout basically means you're making yourself a living. If you're going to seriously rip on these people for taking advantage of an opportunity to be mega-rich and mega-famous then I suggest you sell all your stuff and quit your job/move out of Mom's basement and go squat in an abandoned house somewhere and attempt to make your mark as a \"punk band/artist\" with no record label or manager of any kind. It's hard.\n\nI agree that the definition of \"punk\" has changed - the media and pop culture has obviously shaped it to what will sell best to the masses. But sitting around arguing about what it used to be and how much it sucks now only makes the whole scene full of snobby elitists."
