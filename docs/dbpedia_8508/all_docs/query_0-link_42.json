        "text": "In a country as vast and varied as Canada, myriad musical talents have appeared on one land mass that can feel worlds apart â but when you bring them together, youâd be surprised what they have in common besides nationality. Hailing from Cambridge Bay in Nunavut, Canada, on the south coast of Victoria Island, Tanya Tagaq is an Inuk woman whose heritage, spirituality and politics are deeply woven into her radical musical work. Studying the ancient tradition of throat singing, she developed a solo style of her own that gained her nationwide critical acclaim: releasing three albums of Aboriginal and folk music before winning the prestigious 2014 Polaris Prize with her fourth, Animism. Gaining international recognition for her work with BjÃ¶rk and the Kronos Quartet, Tagaq has shaped herself into a radical, forward-thinking artist.\n\nHer punk spirit finds an affinity with Damian Abraham, the vocalist for the boundary-pushing Canadian hardcore band, Fucked Up. Noted for their ambitious, multi-faceted take on the genre, Fucked Up are also previous winners of the Polaris Prize, for their 2009 album The Chemistry of Common Life. As a performer, Abraham strikes a powerful visual and sonic blow, commanding the stage and audience with an all-or-nothing attitude and vocal range that sees him pull together elements of hardcore, punk, thrash and rock & roll with fervor.\n\nIn this excerpt from RBMA Radioâs Encounters, Abraham and Tagaq explore the connections between their shared philosophies on music, life, politics and the power of ideas.\n\nDemonology and Religion\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nI grew up listening to Iron Maiden a lot, and MotÃ¶rhead, and itâs so funny that metal music is affiliated with demonology. What people think evil is, I donât really associate with it, because being Inuk, the idea of God is what decimated so many groups of people. I think itâs a human construct.\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nAbsolutely. I think if you look at the Church of Satan, historically, as a religion, itâs not about being spooky and being evil. Itâs about the idea of rejection of Christianity, and the idea that maybe the way Christianity has been taken up â not maybe, the way Christianity has been taken up â has been oppressive and decimating. Like, white Christianity has wiped out civilizations, and so many things, in that name.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nEach other, too. Like the Spanish Inquisition and overtaking of Ireland. Everything all in the name of God. Itâs really difficult for me to go, âYeah, Christian faith is so excellent.â I respect people for their own faith on an individual basis. I think people can be good. Once you take it upon yourself to inflict judgment on anyone, I donât think thatâs right. I do really have difficulty believing in the idea of good and evil, because I donât believe in there being any shame surrounding sexuality. Whether you decide to stay a virgin your whole life or whether you sleep with five thousand people, I donât think that morally affects who you are as a person in any way whatsoever. Iâve never understood all of that body shame, shame to be yourself, shame to be everything. Iâm also not a Satanist, because that means you have to believe in Satan, which is as bad as believing in God. Thatâs terrible.\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nWhatâs your favorite singer for Iron Maiden?\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nâRun To The Hillsâ is my favorite. Itâs English people singing about colonialism.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nI wouldnât describe that as narrow at all. Iâd describe someone who only liked the Top 40 as very narrow.\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nI think, though, we live in a poptimist age. When we were younger, youâd look at a magazine and there was the stuff that was in the critical sphere, and that would be the Sugarcubes or that would be Sonic Youth or be those kinds of bands. Now, you look at whatâs in the critical sphere, and itâs the exact same as whatâs on the Top 40 chart. Thereâs not really that breakdown in the same way. I think we live in this weird poptimist moment.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nItâs the same vehicle as the capitalism â thatâs what the problem is. People are throwing the dart to try and sell as many units as possible. Therefore, everyone has to fit in a certain thing, they have to be a certain age, look a certain way, make a certain song. Quite often people donât have to even be good â they just have to be marketable.\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nThatâs probably always been the case, a little bit.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nNo, donât you remember when rock stars were ugly? Not necessarily ugly, but they didnât have to be perfect, like Janis Joplin and Mick Jagger. It was just about being sexy, and having strong presence. That is sexy, I think, having a strong presence.\n\nIâve been into Johnny Cash lately â that guyâs so bad ass. And Dolly Parton.\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nSheâs amazing. [âJoleneâ] is incredible.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nShe captures the feeling of that. Everyoneâs felt that.\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nThereâs a few songs that bleed across the speaker in that way. Thatâs such a real vocal, such a raw vocal, when sheâs delivering it, even though I guess that was a pop song at one point, on the charts.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nItâs the inferiority complex that Canada tends to have, this self-depreciating kind of thing. Itâs frustrating because a lot of things that take in the States arenât necessarily worthy of being as successful as they are. But thereâs a lot of good artists that are very successful.\n\nThe thing about the metal scene that always confused me â itâs the same with the goth vibe â is I grew up seeing things being skinned all the time. Guts, bones â even human bones â laying around the tundra. Graveyards? Not scary. Theyâre just some calcium deposits in a box. Why are people afraid? The goth scene, or people pretending to be vampires? Itâs like, âWell, youâre not?â\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nItâs that Judeo-Christian thing coming back again. Itâs this fear of death, fear of sexuality.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nItâs a movement against that, right?\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nI think itâs a movement in rejection of that, but I think itâs also that fascination with it that comes from a lot of people being raised in that, where itâs all about this obsession over control over life and death and if you believe in this faith, you can live forever and you donât have to be in the graveyard. So much of it is around that, I think.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nYou know how our bodies are made up of cells? Iâm sure thereâs a cell in your lung that isnât aware that itâs part of a body, and itâs not meant to. So what? Itâs alive. I think we are part of something thatâs way bigger than we can possibly comprehend. Weâre not supposed to. Thereâs nothing to fear about death. Thereâs nothing to fear about not being here anymore. We have a little bit of time. Itâs nothing. Itâs a blink of an eye, our lifespan. I donât understand why people are so obsessed with trying to delineate our meaning, when weâre living our meaning everyday.\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nYouâre right. I think maybe itâs from being told, âHey, if you come over here and believe in this set of values and believe in this set of shared principles, you can live forever.â You donât have to be part of the natural order. You can be part of the unnatural order of eternal life through faith and religion.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nDo you think maybe that religion might have been started because they wanted large groups of people to do all the work for them like slaves, so they were like, âThe more you sacrifice in this world, the more youâll get in the afterlife,â in the hopes of getting people to waste away their life and time by basically being enslaved and building everything? I donât know.\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nI think you brought it up earlier when you said itâs about control. Like, it was about controlling women, controlling womenâs sexuality. You read the creation stories in the Bible and itâs right out of the gate â original sin â and itâs very much directed at women.You can kind of see that a lot of times religion is used by men, primarily, to control women, and control people around them.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nWhy do you think they had the need to try to control women?\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nLaziness, maybe. I donât know. Insecurity. Fear. They may fear the power women have.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nI always thought if there was a God, weâd be the closest thing to it. Yeah, of course, we need sperm, but we make the thing. Our flesh becomes more flesh, and itâs so incredible. Iâm trying really hard not to have another [baby].\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nNo, but I just think the range you have and what you doâ¦ It goes back to this one idea of what a voice should sound like and this one idea of what a good vocal is. To me, voices are there to express so much more than just poppy love songs. The first time I heard you, itâs like, âThatâs a voice that does that.â\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nLike Geddy Lee. Itâs like, âWhat the fuck is even happening, this is insane!â Like, you say âOkay, Iâm going to rock this.â It sounds crazy. I remember when I was a kid and my dad would be listening to Leonard Cohen. Iâd be thinking, âHeâs not that great at singing,â but you donât even have to be anymore. Not anymore, but not even ever.\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nLike Nico, from the Velvets. Her voice is another one that I think is not classically beautiful, but unbelievably powerful.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nThe uniqueness of each personâs expression is so good. Thatâs why I want us to collaborate vocally. Which we havenât done yet.\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nI think it would be awesome. I think we could definitely do some fun stuff.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nPoo beard. Artisanal poo beard.\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nThe guy who runs Matador Records, Gerard Cosloy, played in GG Allinâs band. Heâs got some funny stories.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nWell, that guy was just crazy.\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nHe was a performance. He was definitely doing brutal shit to himself, but the sense I get from talking to people that knew him was even though he was doing these ridiculous, reckless things, it was to the end of trying to become a pop star, or trying to become something. It had more in keeping with KISS than I think what weâre trying to do, which is, like, be as honest with a performance as possible.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nYeah, itâs the opposite. That was showmanship, for sure. Less about technical fortitude and more about-\n\nDamian Abraham\n\nPoop.\n\nTanya Tagaq\n\nPoop. More about taking a shit.\n\nIâm still fascinated by that man. He lived his idea of music so much. A lot of musicians, thatâs why we die. We die young because we live the music outside of the music world too much."
