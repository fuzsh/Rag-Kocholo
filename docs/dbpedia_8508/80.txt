Kevin Michael "GG" Allin (born Jesus Christ Allin; August 29, 1956 â€“ June 28, 1993) was an American punk rock musician who performed and recorded with many groups during his career.[4] His live performances often featured transgressive acts, including self-mutilation, defecating on stage, and assaulting audience members, for which he was arrested and imprisoned on multiple occasions.[5] AllMusic called him "the most spectacular degenerate in rock n' roll history",[2] while G4TV's That's Tough labelled him the "toughest rock star in the world".
