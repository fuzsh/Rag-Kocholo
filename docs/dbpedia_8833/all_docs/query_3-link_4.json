        "text": "Throughout his career, American filmmaker, writer, and actor Woody Allen has received a considerable number of awards and distinctions in film festivals and yearly national film awards ceremonies, saluting his work as a director, screenwriter, and actor.[1] Among his many competitive awards, he has won four Academy Awards, ten BAFTA awards, and two Golden Globe Awards.\n\nAllen has won three Oscars for Best Original Screenplay for Annie Hall (1977), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), and Midnight in Paris (2011), and one for Best Director for Annie Hall. He has been nominated 24 times: 16 as a screenwriter, seven as a director, and once as an actor.[2] Allen has more screenwriting Academy Award nominations than any other writer; all in the Best Original Screenplay category. He also holds the record as the oldest winner (at age 76) of the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Midnight in Paris, 2011).[3]As a writer, Allen won the 1978 O. Henry Award for his short story The Kugelmass Episode, published in The New Yorker on May 2, 1977.\n\nDespite friendly recognition from the Academy, Allen has consistently refused to attend the ceremony or acknowledge his Oscar wins. His publicly given reason is his standing engagement to play clarinet in a Monday night ensemble. Back in 1974, Woody was quoted by ABC News as saying, \"The whole concept of awards is silly. I cannot abide by the judgment of other people, because if you accept it when they say you deserve an award, then you have to accept it when they say you don't\".[4] He broke this pattern once. At the Academy Awards ceremony in 2002, Allen made an unannounced appearance, pleading for producers to continue filming their movies in New York City after the September 11 attacks, where he stated, \"I didn't have to present anything. I didn't have to accept anything. I just had to talk about New York City.\"[5] He was given a standing ovation before introducing a montage of movie clips featuring New York.[6]\n\nHis work has been widely celebrated in Europe. Allen twice won the César Award for Best Foreign Film, the first in 1980, for Manhattan and the second in 1986, for The Purple Rose of Cairo. Seven other of his movies were nominated for the prize: Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters, Alice, Husbands and Wives, Manhattan Murder Mystery, Everyone Says I Love You, and Match Point. In 2002, Allen won the Prince of Asturias Award. Subsequently, the city of Oviedo, Spain, erected a life-size statue of Allen.[7] In a 2005 UK poll The Comedian's Comedian, Allen was voted the third greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.[8] In June 2007, Allen received a PhD Honoris Causa from Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nHis honorary awards include a Career Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1995, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Directors Guild of America in 1996, the BAFTA Fellowship in 1997, the Honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival in 2002,[9] and the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2014.[10]\n\nMajor associations[]\n\nAcademy Awards[]\n\nYear Film Result Category 1977 Annie Hall Won Best Director Won Best Original Screenplay[I] Nominated Best Actor 1978 Interiors Nominated Best Director Nominated Best Original Screenplay 1979 Manhattan Nominated Best Original Screenplay[I] 1984 Broadway Danny Rose Nominated Best Director Nominated Best Original Screenplay 1985 The Purple Rose of Cairo Nominated Best Original Screenplay[II] 1986 Hannah and Her Sisters Won Best Original Screenplay Nominated Best Director 1987 Radio Days Nominated Best Original Screenplay[II] 1989 Crimes and Misdemeanors Nominated Best Director Nominated Best Original Screenplay[III] 1990 Alice Nominated Best Original Screenplay 1992 Husbands and Wives Nominated Best Original Screenplay 1994 Bullets over Broadway Nominated Best Director Nominated Best Original Screenplay[III] 1995 Mighty Aphrodite Nominated Best Original Screenplay 1997 Deconstructing Harry Nominated Best Original Screenplay 2005 Match Point Nominated Best Original Screenplay 2011 Midnight in Paris Won Best Original Screenplay Nominated Best Director 2013 Blue Jasmine Nominated Best Original Screenplay\n\n^ I Shared with Marshall Brickman. ^ II Shared with Robert Greenhut. ^ III Shared with Douglas McGrath.\n\nBritish Academy Film Awards[]\n\nWoody Allen has received 24 BAFTA Film nominations, winning 10.
