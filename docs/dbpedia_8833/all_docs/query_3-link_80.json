        "text": "Woody Allen has dropped a lot of unhinged, dithering and raging women into his films, but Cate Blanchett may play the epitome of them all in his latest movie, “Blue Jasmine.”\n\nThe title character is the wife of a crooked New York financier (Alec Baldwin) who, following his imprisonment and her own nervous breakdown, struggles to restart her life in San Francisco, where Jasmine’s decidedly downscale sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins) takes her in.\n\nIt was the acclaimed Australian actress’ first time working with Allen, who’s equally famous for writing great female parts, having his choice of the best actors in the business and, well, not saying much to them once the cameras start rolling.\n\n“What was I expecting?” Blanchett asks rhetorically over a phone link from Australia, where she and husband Andrew Upton run the Sydney Theatre Company. “Though I wasn’t expecting a lot of dialogue with Woody, I guess maybe I’m just a person who asks a lot of questions. I don’t know how to make things other than to make them in conversation with the other actors and the director. So I found him really forthcoming, actually. And you always knew when he didn’t like something.”\n\nBlanchett’s movie work has included playing Queen Elizabeth I twice, winning an Oscar for her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese’s “The Aviator,” and making everything from serious art films such as Todd Haynes’ “I’m Not There” to high-toned dramas like “The Talented Mr. Ripley” and “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” as well as blockbusters like Peter Jackson’s “The Lord of the Rings” and “Hobbit” movies and Steven Spielberg’s “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.”\n\n“You wouldn’t necessarily get a chance to do it again, but he likes things to be buoyant. I think that’s why his films, even when they’re about potentially heavy subjects like divorce and betrayal and terminal disease and financial ruin, there’s always a buoyancy to them; even murder,” she says.\n\n“Blue Jasmine” doesn’t go quite that far. But Jasmine is broke, drinks too much, tends to look down her nose at anyone who isn’t a member of her former class, mentally jumps back and forth in time, talks too much, talks to herself out loud, lies like crazy and sometimes drifts off into a fantasy world only she believes is real.\n\nShe’s also got what you might call an abrasive personality. However, although “Blue Jasmine” is essentially one of Allen’s serious films, Blanchett plays her role with such self-absorbed intensity that the character is often unintentionally hilarious.\n\nWe’re pretty sure Blanchett intended that.\n\n“It’s situational, isn’t it?” she reckons. “The tricky thing is knowing which way to turn because tonally, you think, this is both absurd and tragic; which way is each scene going to fall? So the playing of it is kind of strange and delicate.\n\n“The pleasurable thing for me to play was Jasmine being such an unreliable narrator. She believes like all great fantasistsÃ¯»¿ and all good liars in what she’s saying in the moment. It’s not until after it’s come out of her mouth that, then, she has to see it through, and that’s where the panic is.”\n\nOne thing Blanchett definitely thinks is funny is the general media impression that “Blue Jasmine” is Allen’s version of Tennessee Williams. As someone who’s played Blanche DuBois in hit stage versions of “A Streetcar Named Desire,” the actress acknowledges certain surface similarities between the two stories, but points out that their sensibilities are worlds apart.\n\n“We never directly discussed that,” Blanchett says. “If there’s any reference point for the character, a woman of once-great fortune now faded arrives at her sister of an entirely different class to ask for her help, and the sister is partnered to a man of the more animal variety than she is used to — well, OK, the setup is very similar. But the way it evolved, you can’t possibly hope to put Blanche DuBois in a Woody Allen film.\n\n“You could say that Tennessee Williams in ‘Streetcar’ describes the moment of the death of poetry in America. In the Woody Allen universe, does poetry even exist? What is the value of poetry? It’s definitely more sort of existential angst. To have tried to play Blanche in that environment would have been a bit of creative suicide, I think.”\n\nHow about Ruth Madoff? Allen has denied that the Bernie Madoff scandal was in any way an inspiration for “Blue Jasmine.” Blanchett admits that, well, maybe a little.\n\n“Look, there’s a whole other picture to be made in the epic betrayal that constituted Bernie Madoff’s downfall,” she says. “But I think, like every other person on the planet, I followed the story. It’s just in the ether, and it’s in the back of your mind, but it’s not something that you consciously draw from. I’m not playing Ruth Madoff, but there are a lot of those women who’ve found themselves working in the proverbial shoe store, who have fallen from grace, been estranged from their friends and their social circle, and set adrift because of their husbands’ shocking deeds.”\n\nBlanchett’s full-blast performance in “Blue Jasmine” constitutes a return to cinema after a few years focused on stage work and raising her three sons. She’ll be seen in George Clooney’s World War II art rescue drama “The Monuments Men” later this year and isn’t sure if her Elf Queen Galadriel made the cut for the second “Hobbit” movie or will appear in next year’s third one. She’s equally at sea about what she’ll be doing on screen, if anything, once notoriously indecisive director Terrence Malick finishes cutting the two upcoming features she shot with him.\n\nA part in Disney’s live-action “Cinderella,” directed by Kenneth Branagh, is on her schedule, as is a reteaming with Haynes.\n\n“I hate it, hate it,” Blanchett says with a laugh about movie work. “I’m dragged kicking and screaming every time, but I must like it because I keep doing it.”"
