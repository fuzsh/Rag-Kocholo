        "text": "It’s obvious from “Blue Jasmine” that Woody Allen has been to Hell; what’s more, he imagines some of the neighborhoods there that he was spared from visiting. It’s a movie about pain and loss—and specifically, it tests the limits of the bearable, particularly among those who have never had to bear much. In a peculiarly negative and inverted way, the movie displays Allen’s own lifeboat in a sea of trouble and shows what happens when someone doesn’t have one of her own. The subject is the idle rich, the problem is idleness, the crisis is self-delusion in the face of fear and despair, and the basic material of the movie is the definition of identity. And, as it turns out, Allen’s vision of a modern-day Job is simply someone without a job.\n\nHis protagonist, Jasmine, played by Cate Blanchett, is a middle-aged woman with a sheen of prosperity who, because she has nowhere else to go, shows up at the modest San Francisco apartment of her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins). Jasmine, who grew up as Jeanette, had known comfort and leisure since her marriage to Hal (Alec Baldwin), a wizard of finance brought down, in public shame, by shady, Madoff-like schemes. Hal ended up in jail; their son, Danny (Alden Ehrenreich), has repudiated her; and, having emerged from a mental institution needing to rebuild her life, she repairs to San Francisco, where Ginger has agreed to take her in.\n\nAllen has crafted a masterwork of construction. His writing is pointed and lucid, aphoristic and exemplary. He brings out the elaborate backstory through deftly crafted flashbacks that serve as strong a psychological and thematic purpose as a narrative one—to fill the present with the past. It’s a movie that—for better and for worse—builds its characters from parts that seem pregnant with action and situations that beg for resolution; the movie seems made to be recalled and described.\n\nThe sisters’ relations have long been tense. They’re adoptive siblings; Jasmine had always been the golden girl of the family, and Ginger, who works as a supermarket cashier, cheerfully—surprisingly cheerfully—accepts her relationship with her sister despite decades of condescension and worse. Ginger and her ex, Augie (Andrew Dice Clay), lost a two-hundred-thousand-dollar windfall through their investment with Hal. Unlike Ginger, Augie, who had planned to use the money to start a business, has no forgiveness in him.\n\nThe spring of a plot coils tighter through the practical stages of Jasmine’s struggle to regain a place on earth. First, she needs a job, and she gets one as a receptionist to a dentist (Michael Stuhlbarg), which doesn’t go so well. Second, she needs an ambition, and, prompted by Ginger’s admiration for her taste, she decides to study for an interior decorator’s license. Third, she meets Dwight (Peter Sarsgaard), a rich, accomplished, ambitious man and—concealing her past from him—decides to hitch her wagon to his rising star. Meanwhile, Ginger’s own romantic life takes a turn, seemingly for the better, through Jasmine’s confident influence.\n\nReviewing the movie in the magazine this week, David Denby rightly described Allen’s directorial approach as “curt and decisive—a ‘late’ style, if there ever was one.” Allen has been working in this spare, sketchlike way since “Match Point,” the great liberation of his later abstract turn. It’s as if, delivering himself from the thick textures of daily life—and the particulars of his own experience—he has gone straight to his ideas. These later movies fall into two patterns. There’s Analogue Woody, as in “Vicky Cristina Barcelona,” “Match Point,” and, now, “Blue Jasmine”; and Symbolic Woody, as in “To Rome with Love,” “Scoop,” and “Midnight in Paris”; and two movies that resemble the former but function like the latter, “You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger” and “Cassandra’s Dream” (which is one of his very greatest films). The difference is simple: the former films are stories of motives, the latter, stories of theories. The former emphasize writing as a way of exemplifying character; the latter films use situations and devices to embody ideas. The former depend on actors as dramatic delivery systems; the latter present actors as opaque figures of gesture.\n\nFrom these descriptions, my preferences are obvious. Allen’s dependence on his actors’ performances is highlighted in Blanchett’s interpretation of Jasmine. The character’s moments of forceful emotional violence come off as constructed of its pieces; their wildness seems forced and shows the gears of an actor’s preparation and decision-making. By contrast, Blanchett’s sequences of quiet, frayed agony rise to an exaltedly high dramatic pitch. They feel like scenes from a play, and the actress takes sublime interpretive hold of them.\n\nBut the very dramatic power, the overwhelming compassion for Jasmine at her moments of intimate devastation, gets in the way of Allen’s strongest and most dangerous vision. Jasmine has lost her public identity—indeed, has become something of a pariah. She has lost her money, and she has to find something to do. Like Jasmine née Jeanette, Allen, of course, also endured (in the early nineties) the shattering of his public identity and a barrage of hostility; like her, he was rejected by one of his children in the wake of scandal. (And, like her, he is known to the world under a pseudonym.) But Allen didn’t lose his money and he didn’t lose his ability to work; he didn’t struggle and strive to recover his former status, because he was able to simply keep going forward—and the artistic results have often been wondrous.\n\nIn Allen’s earlier movies, the realistic texture, the sense that he was depicting his own milieu (as hermetic as it may have seemed) and transforming details from his own life, often conflicted with his idealizing tendencies: when he wanted to say something, he said it himself, on-screen. That made for their splendid, spontaneous modernism—but also often left me feeling that there was either too much of him there, or, much more often, too little. His highly accomplished films of the eighties sometimes felt as if they had grown respectable; I was waiting for him to break out.\n\nWith “Husbands and Wives,” he broke out, though only briefly, and it took more than another decade—and a drastic change in the circumstances under which his movies were produced—to effect his most recent flourish. “Blue Jasmine” is, in many ways, among Allen’s most (that word again) accomplished films. Here, in a highly refracted and filtered way, he faces some of his most traumatic experiences—even while suggesting that he was spared their most harrowing implications. He shows that he’d be lost, to the point of madness, if he lost the ability to make movies—or maybe just his money. He distances himself from the passionate and frenzied events on-screen—and quietly contemplates his distance from them. It’s a movie that’s rescued in fragments; in those intermittent quiet moments, it’s among his most moving works (there’s a plot twist, too good even to hint at, that arrives like a thunderbolt). But, for much of its running time, it’s a movie to admire while wishing that the wild man would come out from behind the curtain and sing his blues.\n\nPhotograph: Sony Classics"
