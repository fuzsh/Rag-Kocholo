Blanchett is beyond brilliant, beyond analysis. Her performance is one for the books.”-Mick LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle\n\n“Richly chronicled characters, sharp dialogue and that stupendous centerpiece performance by Cate Blanchett are contributing factors in the best summer movie of 2013 and one of the most memorable Woody Allen movies ever.”-Rex Reed, New York Observer\n\nShare this Film"
