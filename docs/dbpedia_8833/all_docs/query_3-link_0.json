        "text": "Woody Allen awards and nominations\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nAward\n\nWins\n\nNominations\n\n4\n\n24\n\n10\n\n24\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n13\n\n1\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\n\nThroughout his career, American filmmaker, writer, and actor Woody Allen has received a considerable number of awards and distinctions in film festivals and yearly national film awards ceremonies, saluting his work as a director, screenwriter, and actor.[1] Among his many competitive awards, he has won four Academy Awards, ten BAFTA awards, and two Golden Globe Awards.\n\nAllen has won three Oscars for Best Original Screenplay for Annie Hall (1977), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), and Midnight in Paris (2011), and one for Best Director for Annie Hall. He has been nominated 24 times: 16 as a screenwriter, seven as a director, and once as an actor.[2] Allen has more screenwriting Academy Award nominations than any other writer; all in the Best Original Screenplay category. He also holds the record as the oldest winner (at age 76) of the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Midnight in Paris, 2011).[3] As a writer, Allen won the 1978 O. Henry Award for his short story The Kugelmass Episode, published in The New Yorker on May 2, 1977.\n\nDespite friendly recognition from the Academy, Allen has consistently refused to attend the ceremony or acknowledge his Oscar wins. His publicly given reason is his standing engagement to play clarinet in a Monday night ensemble. Back in 1974, Woody was quoted by ABC News as saying, \"The whole concept of awards is silly. I cannot abide by the judgment of other people, because if you accept it when they say you deserve an award, then you have to accept it when they say you don't\".[4] He broke this pattern once. At the Academy Awards ceremony in 2002, Allen made an unannounced appearance, pleading for producers to continue filming their movies in New York City after the September 11 attacks, where he stated, \"I didn't have to present anything. I didn't have to accept anything. I just had to talk about New York City.\"[5] He was given a standing ovation before introducing a montage of movie clips featuring New York.[6]\n\nHis work has been widely celebrated in Europe. Allen twice won the César Award for Best Foreign Film, the first in 1980, for Manhattan and the second in 1986, for The Purple Rose of Cairo. Seven other of his movies were nominated for the prize: Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters, Alice, Husbands and Wives, Manhattan Murder Mystery, Everyone Says I Love You, and Match Point. In 2002, Allen won the Prince of Asturias Award. Subsequently, the city of Oviedo, Spain, erected a life-size statue of Allen.[7] In a 2005 UK poll The Comedian's Comedian, Allen was voted the third greatest comedy act ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders.[8] In June 2007, Allen received a PhD Honoris Causa from Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nHis honorary awards include a Career Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1995, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Directors Guild of America in 1996, the BAFTA Fellowship in 1997, the Honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival in 2002,[9] and the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2014.[10]\n\nMajor associations\n\n[edit]\n\nAcademy Awards\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Category Nominated work Result Ref. 1978 Best Director Annie Hall Won [11] Best Actor Nominated Best Original Screenplay Won 1979 Best Director Interiors Nominated [12] Best Original Screenplay Nominated 1980 Manhattan Nominated [13] 1985 Best Director Broadway Danny Rose Nominated [14] Best Original Screenplay Nominated 1986 The Purple Rose of Cairo Nominated [15] 1987 Best Director Hannah and Her Sisters Nominated [16] Best Original Screenplay Won 1988 Radio Days Nominated [17] 1990 Best Director Crimes and Misdemeanors Nominated [18] Best Original Screenplay Nominated 1991 Alice Nominated [19] 1993 Husbands and Wives Nominated [20] 1995 Best Director Bullets Over Broadway Nominated [21] Best Original Screenplay Nominated 1996 Mighty Aphrodite Nominated [22] 1998 Deconstructing Harry Nominated [23] 2006 Match Point Nominated [24] 2012 Best Director Midnight in Paris Nominated [25] Best Original Screenplay Won 2014 Blue Jasmine Nominated [26]\n\nBAFTA Awards\n\n[edit]\n\nWoody Allen has received 24 BAFTA Film nominations, winning 10. In addition, he has received the British Academy's most prestigious honorary award, the Fellowship. The 1978 best film BAFTA win for Annie Hall went to Charles H. Joffe and Jack Rollins, as the category that year only credited the producers. In 1980, the best film category credited only the director. From 1985 to 1998, both the director and producers were credited.\n\nYear Category Nominated work Result Ref.
