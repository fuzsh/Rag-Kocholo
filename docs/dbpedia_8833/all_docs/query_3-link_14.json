        "text": "Australia's Cate Blanchett has fought off fierce competition to win the Golden Globe award for best drama actress, adding fuel to the Oscar buzz surrounding her performance in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine.\n\nAmerican Hustle and 12 Years A Slave picked up top film honours at the Globes, which mark the start of Hollywood's awards season and are closely watched ahead of the Academy Awards.\n\nAlfonso Cuaron won best director for Gravity, while Matthew McConaughey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence and Jared Leto also took home a coveted statue.\n\nBlanchett defeated Bullock, who was nominated for her role in space thriller Gravity, along with Judi Dench for adoption drama Philomena, Kate Winslet for Labor Day and Emma Thompson for Saving Mr Banks.\n\nShe paid tribute to Allen while accepting the award, which she described as a \"heavy thing that makes your biceps look great\".\n\n\"Woody Allen writes and directs these things with such alarming regularity that we almost take him for granted,\" she told the audience at the Beverly Hills ceremony.\n\n\"Thank you for calling me and not one of the other incredible women in the room this evening.\"\n\nHer trademark humour was on show as wrap-up music began to prompt an end to her speech.\n\n\"Can people at home hear this music? Or do they suddenly think you're just getting really fast and having a panic attack?\" Blanchett joked.\n\nShe also thanked the film's cast and crew for \"plying me with vodka in the way that Judy Garland was probably [supplied] with barbiturates\".\n\nIn Blue Jasmine, Blanchett stars as a wealthy socialite who moves into her sister's apartment after the collapse of her marriage leaves her broke and broken - a performance that has been widely acclaimed.\n\nLast week, she was named best international lead actress by the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts, and she has also received a prestigious British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) nod.\n\nThe Globes win - her third after Elizabeth (1999) and I'm Not There (2008) - will further fuel speculation she will take home her second Oscar later this year.\n\nNominations for the Oscars will be announced later this week, with the Academy Awards ceremony held in March.\n\nAmerican Hustle and 12 Years A Slave win top film awards\n\nCrime caper American Hustle and 12 Years a Slave were seen as frontrunners ahead of the ceremony, and neither disappointed.\n\nDavid O Russell's American Hustle won the Globe for best musical/comedy film, defeating Her, Inside Llewyn Davis, Nebraska and The Wolf Of Wall Street.\n\nThe film also netted awards for stars Amy Adams (best musical/comedy actress) and Jennifer Lawrence (best supporting actress).\n\n\"I would love to direct one day, but I don't want to suck. I want to keep learning,\" Lawrence told reporters backstage.\n\nSteve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave, about a free black man sold into slavery in 19th century America, beat Captain Phillips, Gravity, Philomena and Rush to win the best drama film award.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio picked up the best musical/comedy actor category for his role in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nDiCaprio paid tribute to the director, saying: \"You put the very fabric of our culture up on screen. As the history of cinema unfolds, you'll be regarded as one of the great directors of our time.\"\n\nMatthew McConaughey triumphed for best drama actor in Dallas Buyers Club, about a HIV-positive man who smuggles drugs to treat the disease in the 1980s.\n\nJared Leto, who portrays a transgender woman living with AIDS in the film, picked up the best supporting actor award.\n\nCuaron wins best director for Gravity\n\nBest director went to Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron for space thriller Gravity, which stars Bullock and George Clooney.\n\n\"This is for the hundreds of people that made this film possible - and because of my thick accent, they ended up doing what they thought I said, not what I really said,\" Cuaron said.\n\n\"Sandra, you are the most amazing collaborator. I want to thank you for not weeping when I told you 'Sandra, I am going to give you herpes' when I meant to say 'Sandra, I am going to give you an earpiece'.\"\n\nAllen was recognised for his lifetime's work, winning the Cecil B DeMille award.\n\nOn the small screen, Bryan Cranston won his first Golden Globe for his starring role as Walter White in Breaking Bad - a show that also picked up the gong for best TV drama series.\n\nRobyn Wright picked up best TV drama actress for House of Cards, while best TV movie or mini-series went to Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra.\n\nComedian Amy Poehler - who hosted the glitzy night alongside Tina Fey - also picked up a best comedy actress Globe for her role in Parks and Recreation."
