This was later confirmed along with the rest of the principal cast in June 2012.\n\nThe film was filmed in 2012 in New York City and San Francisco. Letty Aronson, Stephen Tenenbaum, and Edward Walson served as the film's producers. Sony Pictures Classics distributed the film, marking the sixth collaboration between the label and Allen.\n\nRelease[]\n\nBlue Jasmine had a limited release at six theaters in Los Angeles and New York City on July 26, 2013, and expanded wide on August 23, 2013.\n\nWoody Allen refused to release Blue Jasmine in India because the country requires a blurb to be inserted at the bottom of any scenes during which a character is smoking. This is in addition to health warnings that are required to be shown at the beginning and end of the film.\n\nReception[]\n\nBox office:[]\n\nThe film received a slow rollout, modeled after the release of Midnight in Paris; it was estimated to have grossed over $600,000 in its first three days, which took place at six theaters in Los Angeles and New York City. It was Allen's \"best-ever opening per-screen average\" and the year's highest per-screen average, beating Spring Breakers '​ \"impressive debut on three screens\". The film grossed $33 million in the U.S. and $62 million in the rest of the world, resulting in a worldwide gross of $95 million.\n\nCritical response:[]\n\nEarly reviews suggested the film would be rated very highly among Allen's recent offerings, and praised Blanchett's performance as one of her strongest, if not the best of her career: David Denby of The New Yorker stated that \"in all, this is the strongest, most resonant movie Woody Allen has made in years\". Mick LaSalle, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, wrote that \"Blanchett in Blue Jasmine is beyond brilliant, beyond analysis. This is jaw-dropping work, what we go to the movies hoping to see, and we do. Every few years.\" Andrew Dice Clay's performance was also critically praised in the film.\n\nRotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 91%, with an average rating of 8 out of 10, based on 194 reviews. The film is considered a \"Certified Fresh\", with the site's consensus being \"Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine finds the director in peak late-period form—and benefiting from a superb cast led by Cate Blanchett.\" On Metacritic, the film received a score of 78/100 based on 47 reviews.\n\nCritics have stated that they believe the film is Allen's take, tribute or version of the Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire as it shares a very similar plot and characters. Other critics and cultural commentators argued that the story of Jasmine as a \"shrill narcissist falling apart\" and \"in a crisis of self-flagellation after living in denial for years\" was modeled on his former companion, Mia Farrow, and that the film is a \"response\" to their high-profile and acrimonious break-up.\n\nAwards[]\n\nWins:[]\n\nAcademy Awards: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nGolden Globe Awards: Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama (Cate Blanchett)\n\nBAFTA'S: Best Atress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nScreen Actors Guild Awards: Best Leading Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nAACTA Awards: Best International Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nAlliance of Women Film Journalists: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nBoston Online Film Critics Association: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nBoston Society of Film Critics: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nBroadcast Film Critics Association: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nChicago Film Critics Association: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nDallas–Fort Worth Film Critics Association: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nEmpire Awards: Best Supporting Actress (Sally Hawkins)\n\nFlorida Film Critics Circle: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nIndependent Spirit Awards: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nLondon Film Critics' Circle Awards: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nLos Angeles Film Critics Association: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nNational Society of Film Critics Awards: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nNew York Film Critics Circle Awards: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nNew York Film Critics Online: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nOnline Film Critics Society: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nPhoenix Film Critics Society Awards: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nSan Diego Film Critics Society: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nSan Francisco Film Critics Circle: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nSanta Barbara International Film Festival: Outstanding Performer of the Year (Cate Blanchett)\n\nSatellite Awards: Best Actress - Motion Picture (Cate Blanchett)\n\nSoutheastern Film Critics Association: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nSt. Louis Gateway Film Critics Association: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nToronto Film Critics Association: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nVancouver Film Critics Circle: Best Actress (Cate Blanchett)\n\nWashington D.C.
