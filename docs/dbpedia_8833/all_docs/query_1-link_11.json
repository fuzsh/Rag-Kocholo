        "text": "The one towering achievement of Blue Jasmine that is worth your attention is the lead performance of Cate Blanchett.\n\nFebruary 16, 2024\n\nAllen has made an unforgettable character study of a fascinating, despicable, sympathetic, and engaging figure and those around her.\n\nAugust 25, 2022\n\nBlanchett visualizes her struggles through every fidget, every bead of sweat, and every outburst. She’s not a likable character by any stretch but she’s simply mesmerizing.\n\nAugust 19, 2022\n\nCate's performance is something all its own, splitting the seams of what might have been something entirely else, in somebody else's hands\n\nJuly 2, 2021\n\nDarker than most of Allen's recent output, Blue Jasmine doesn't go for laughs - very often anyway - but is an astutely crafted psychological character study.\n\nJanuary 31, 2021\n\nPurposefully structuring a film to deprive viewers of a precise beginning, middle, and end is a risky game that doesn't always pay off.\n\nDecember 3, 2020\n\nBlanchett is the true author of Blue Jasmine. It's a towering performance that remains fixed on your brain.\n\nSeptember 4, 2020\n\nThe film ultimately depends upon and is rewarded by Cate Blanchett's insightful and emotionally resonant performance as Jasmine.\n\nSeptember 3, 2020\n\nJasmine could have been the same neurotic type we've seen in previous Woody Allen films, but Blanchett makes the character just as much her own creation as it is his.\n\nJuly 24, 2020"
