        "text": "LOS ANGELES — How do you give a lifetime achievement award to a director still very much in motion, to an artist who refuses to settle down, to someone who actively doesn’t want one?\n\nWoody Allen is in the midst of a run of box-office successes and critical acclaim, with his latest, Blue Jasmine, firmly implanted in the awards-season conversation.\n\nAt 78, Allen seems as busy as ever.\n\nWhich only partly explains why he won’t be accepting his Cecil B. DeMille Award in person Sunday night at the Golden Globe ceremony. He’ll be in New York, likely watching basketball on television.\n\nDiane Keaton, who won a Golden Globe and an Oscar for her role in Allen’s Annie Hall, will accept the prize on his behalf.\n\nBut on the day after Christmas, in an emptied-out hotel conference room in Beverly Hills, Allen agreed to talk about his movies, especially Blue Jasmine — which seems, as Allen’s pictures so often do, both different and the same.\n\nHis work is at once voraciously diverse and wholly singular.\n\n“I see them as distinct,” he said, “but if you looked at them, you would see recurring themes all the time. The same questions are asked in one form or another.\n\n“There are 100 different dishes that the Chinese eat, but in the end it’s all Chinese food,” he added. “Yes, there’s a pork dish, or a scallop dish — they are all different on the menu, but you’v e had Chinese food. And that’s the way you could think of my films.”\n\nThe four-time Oscar winner said he isn’t “an awards person,” noting that his initial reaction was to turn down the DeMille award outright but that he ultimately acquiesced.\n\n“I said, ‘If I don’t have to watch it and I don’t have to come to it, they can do anything they want.’??”\n\nRobert Weide, who directed Woody Allen: A Documentary, and consulted on the tribute reel for the Golden Globe presentation, has heard Allen bemoan his lack of influence.\n\n“The funny thing is for a guy who says he hasn’t had any influence, put any word before ‘Woody Allen’ and names will come up of filmmakers who have been compared to him in one way or another,” Weide said.\n\nBy the time a movie comes out, Allen has likely already shot and edited another one and is two paces ahead. In a way, he has already moved on by the time a film he has made is being received, positively or negatively.\n\nHe said he hasn’t read a review of his work or an article about himself in more than 40 years.\n\n“I realized, the less preoccupied you are with yourself, the better you do,” Allen said. “You don’t want to read that you’re a genius; you don’t want to read that you have no talent; you don’t want to read how gifted you are or what a lowlife you are.\n\n“The best thing is to just work.”"
