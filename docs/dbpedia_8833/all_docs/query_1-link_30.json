        "text": "In a way, \"Blue Jasmine\" is a perfect encapsulation of Woody Allen's filmmaking career. Both are largely uneven creatures -- with as many elements to like about them as to dislike -- but they demand attention regardless.\n\nThat's because, just when you're ready to give up on them, just when you're ready to wash your hands of the whole erudite exercise, Allen straightens up, pushes his glasses up his nose and hits you with a perfectly timed flash of brilliance -- something that reminds you why his flawed genius is still so worth paying attention to.\n\nIn \"Blue Jasmine,\" that \"something\" is Cate Blanchett, whose magnetic but heartbreaking performance as a woman adrift rescues Allen's otherwise rudderless tragi-comedy. Her Jasmine is an unlikeable character. She's a money-grubbing gold-digger, a woman willing to lie, cheat or alienate as she guzzles glasses of vodka and struggles to find a way back into the elite social circle from which she has been expelled.\n\nStill, likeable or not, Jasmine has every right to be blue. Her fall from grace -- and the resulting push from the penthouse -- isn't even necessarily her fault. At least, not directly. Rather, it has everything to do with her recently dissolved marriage to a Bernie Madoff-styled husband (played by Alec Baldwin). She's only guilty of turning a blind eye to his hijinks, at least until the cops came knocking.\n\nShe's every bit as pretentious as she is penniless, though -- a Blanche DuBois for the new millennium, in her own way -- and while she goes about making-believe that hers is a bubbly world, that bubble is constantly being pierced by a looming darkness.\n\nThat is to say, she's a deeply wounded woman, as Blanchett's soulful, all-in performance makes it clear. Her wounds are what make her such a compelling -- if distant -- character.\n\nAnother reason: the built-in train-wreck factor. After all, when she has to stoop to moving in with her blue-collar -- and, what's worse, common -- kid sister (Sally Hawkins), it's pretty clear that this whole exercise has to end badly. That's only cemented when we learn that among those who have been ripped off by Jasmine's hubby is Hawkins' own ex-husband -- played in a revelatory turn by Andrew \"Dice\" Clay, putting aside his naughty nursery rhymes to show he's got honest-to-goodness acting skills.\n\nIt's that end -- the film's final sobering five minutes -- in which \"Blue Jasmine\" is at its most effective. Credit is due there to Blanchett's table-setting performance in it and in the hour and half preceding it. It's also due to the courage Allen displays as a storyteller in ending this particular story in the way it has to end.\n\nUp until that payoff, though, Allen's film -- a largely grave cautionary tale that wields an undeniable sense of timeliness, with its not-so-gentle exhortations on the downside of avarice -- stumbles around Jasmine-like, scrabbling and phumphering as it tries to gain purchase. So we get clumsy flashbacks, we get extended lulls, we get moments that don't ring nearly as true as they apparently did in Allen's head as he wrote his script.\n\nIn other words, we get all those things that so often conspire to short-circuit Allen's lesser works. (You know, the ones that \"Midnight in Paris\" made you forget about.) They're also, one has to suspect, an occupational hazard that goes along with writing, directing, editing and releasing one film a year for the past three decades, as the prolific Allen has done.\n\nAt the same time, though -- paradoxical as it sounds, given the film's flaws -- \"Blue Jasmine\" also stands as an example of what Allen does best: Coaxing performances of a lifetime from the actors lucky enough to work with him. That's why accomplished actors, such as Blanchett, jump at a chance to anchor one of his films as do actors trying to reinvigorate their careers, such as Clay.\n\nBy my count, 16 actors in Allen films have been nominated for Oscars. What's more, six of them have won it. Blanchett seems like a shoo-in to increase at least the first of those numbers.\n\n_______\n\nBLUE JASMINE\n\n2 stars, out of 5\n\nSnapshot: A tragi-comedy about the ex-wife of a wealthy financial player who struggles to find her way when her husband is exposed by the feds as a high-stakes, Bernie Madoff-styled crook."
