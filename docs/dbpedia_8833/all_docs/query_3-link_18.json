        "text": "Cate Blanchett won the Oscar for leading actress for her role in Blue Jasmine on Sunday during the 86th Academy Awards, playing a rich wife who loses her money and her husband — a role Woody Allen has said was written specifically for her.\n\n“Sit down, you’re too old to be standing,” she said as she took the stage. “As random and subjective as this award is, it means a great deal in a year of extraordinary performances by women.”\n\nShe proceeded to go through her fellow nominees — Amy Adams (American Hustle), Sandra Bullock (Gravity), Judi Dench, (Philomena), and Meryl Streep (August: Osage County) — praising each of their performances.\n\nCate Blanchett sat down with THR after her Spirit award win and openly stated she’s ready to go the “full schlob” after an intense awards campaign. Watch more of the Oscar winner’s interview below.\n\nBlanchett previously won the Oscar in the supporting category for The Aviator nine years ago. The widely-revered thespian has earned some of the year’s best reviews for her return to the big screen — after six years of essentially being away from it — in Blue Jasmine. She also won the Critics’ Choice, Golden Globe and SAG awards and prizes from the New York Film Critics’ Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association and National Society of Film Critics, among many others.\n\nHer road to Oscar was not without controversy. Many wondered if Blanchett’s chances would be hurt by Allen’s recently resurrected scandal. Dylan Farrow, Allen’s one-time adopted daughter with Mia Farrow, penned an op-ed in The New York Times alleging Allen molested her when she was seven.\n\nBlanchett mentioned Allen in her speech, saying, “Thank you so much Woody for casting me.”\n\nShe closed her speech by challenging the perception that female-fronted movies are not as big of a draw with audiences as ones starring men. “The world is round, people,” yelled Blanchett."
