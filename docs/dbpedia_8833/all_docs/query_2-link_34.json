One of her many titular characters.\n\nHow is Cate introduced?\n\nImmediately and memorably. Jabbering away about her life and marriage to a stranger on a plane, sets the tone for how unstable the character is.\n\nBox Office: Domestic = $33MM Int’l = $66MM\n\nMetacritic : 78 RT: 91\n\nTopics discussed:\n\nWoody Allen is a well known terrible person. Though the films are great and influential. Art vs. Artist. How do you reconcile your feelings about him and his art that we have loved for many years?\n\nBlue Jasmine is a performance driven film. Blanchett just holds the screen. What other examples of this are in Allen’s canon?\n\nAnnie Hall (1977) – unique character inspired by the actress playing her, Diane Keaton.\n\nBullets Over Broadway (1994)- comedy genius performance from Dianne Weist.\n\nVicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) – another comic “genius” in Penelope Cruz.\n\nInteriors (1978) – is it the closest to Jasmine of Woody’s women? Certainly the tragic ends of both Eve and Jasmine are similar.\n\nOr is it Judy Davis in Husbands and Wives (1992), an actress who’s closest in temperament to Blanchett?\n\nMia Farrow’s sublime performance in The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985).\n\nEmma Stone as the Woody stand-in Irrational Man (2015).\n\nAllen’s reputation for many years as “women’s writer director” can’t be denied despite some misogynistic roles e.g Hemingway in Manhattan.\n\nThe work of the costume designer and the makeup artist in helping Cate craft this performance\n\nCharting the effects of the economic crisis on one person.\n\nThis is a lauded performance with critics, awards bodies and audiences – where does this stand among the best performances of the 2010s?\n\nReferences:\n\n“I think Woody Allen is a criminal, but I still think about (& might watch) his old films. I think The Cosby Show should still be aired.” Emily Nussbaum to Terry Gross on NPR.\n\nPromotional Work:\n\nNYTimes Video interview.\n\nSAG Q and A.\n\nMore on Blue Jasmine:\n\nPart 1 Actor as Auteur\n\nPart 2 The Streetcar Allusions\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / Google / iHeart\n\nLike?

The many actresses who played Blanche or were inspired by her from the women in Pedro Almodovar’s movies to Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence to most recently Carey Mulligan in Wildlife.

Jabbering away about her life and marriage to a stranger on a plane, sets the tone for how unstable the character is.\n\nBox Office: Domestic = $33MM Int’l = $66MM\n\nMetacritic : 78 RT: 91\n\nTopics discussed:\n\nBlue Jasmine as a riff on Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire. Woody Allen denied the connection, though it’s obvious to anyone who knows the play.\n\nThe differences between Streetcar and Jasmine:\n\n– No sexual tension between Jasmine / Chilli as there was btw Blanche / Stanley.\n\n– It’s Jasmine’s story, diminished roles for other characters.\n\n– Modernized Streetcar though themes of class disparity are consistent.\n\nBlanche is written and played more vulnerable than Jasmine, though they are both architects of their own destruction.\n\nCate has played Blanche DuBois in a production directed by Liv Ullman that came to BAM in 2009.\n\nOther actresses who played Blanche (it’s a right of passage) include: Vivien Leigh, Jessica Lange, Rachel Weisz, Gillian Anderson, Nicole Ari Parker.\n\nOther performances in the vein of “women unravelling” so many examples from Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence to Carey Mulligan in Wildlife to a whole array of Pedro Almodovar leading ladies particulary in All About My Mother.\n\nBlanchett’s performance in relation to the other actors, in particular her chemistry with Sally Hawkins as the “Stella” to her “Blanche”.\n\nWhat reviews said of film / Cate:\n\n“This is a film that draws deep from the well of A Streetcar Named Desire. Cate Blanchett, who has played Blanche du Bois onstage, is here cast as an updated version of Tennessee Williams’s anti-heroine, Blanche’s reveries about a faded Southern aristocracy replaced with contemporary delusions bred by life as lived among the 1 percent in Manhattan and the Hamptons. The film begins with Jasmine (née Jeanette) arriving in San Francisco, broke but still flying first class, the dazed victim of a financial scandal involving her former husband. Now homeless, she is forced to rely on the comfort of her estranged sister, Ginger, who is romantically involved with a blue-collar lug named Chili. (Although we see Chili in a wife-beater, he refrains from shouting, Hey, Ginnnnn-gerrrrrr!!!!) Like Streetcar, Blue Jasmine is the story of Jasmine’s further humbling, of upper-class pretension dashing against the rock of working-class earthiness; also like Streetcar, Allen’s work shares its heroine’s snobbery, the director as appalled as Jasmine by Chili’s and Ginger’s gaucheries, their lack of interest in high culture, their aspirational void” – Vanity Fair\n\nBlanchett, Blanche — the names seem fated for each. Mr. Allen has said that he didn’t see Ms. Blanchett play Tennessee Williams’s most famous creation in Liv Ullmann’s celebrated 2009 production of “A Streetcar Named Desire” at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. (Jasmine’s appalled aside about being forced to move to Brooklyn after being priced out of Manhattan amusingly suggests why he didn’t.) Whatever his inspiration, he has been rummaging around in the classics for decades, so his appropriation of “Streetcar” doesn’t surprise. What does is his reimagining Blanche by way of another figure who changes depending on how you hold her up to the light, Ruth Madoff, the wife of Bernard L. Madoff, the investor turned avatar of a fallen world. It’s a masterly stroke that puts Jasmine’s dissembling into fresh, chilling perspective.\n\nThe allusions to “Streetcar” are copious and obvious, and spotting the quotations initially feels like a kind of humorous parlor game, from the French connection that links Blanche and Jasmine’s names to Mr. Allen’s staging of a violent skirmish, which echoes a similar one in Elia Kazan’s film adaptation. Underscoring the resemblances, Jasmine repeatedly explains that “Blue Moon” was playing when she met Hal, memories that evoke the blue piano that, as Williams wrote in “Streetcar,” expresses “the spirit of the life which goes on here.” In the play, Blanche also says that Stanley isn’t the type who goes for jasmine perfume, an aside that carries an accusation.” – Manohla Dargis, NYTimes\n\nScreenPrism on the similarities between Blue Jasmine and A Streetcar Named Desire.\n\nReviews of Cate as Blanche on Stage:\n\n“What Ms. Blanchett brings to the character is life itself, a primal survival instinct that keeps her on her feet long after she has been buffeted by blows that would level a heavyweight boxer. Ms. Blanchett’s Blanche is always on the verge of falling apart, yet she keeps summoning the strength to wrestle with a world that insists on pushing her away. Blanche’s burden, in existential terms, becomes ours. And a most particular idiosyncratic creature acquires the universality that is the stuff of tragedy. All the baggage that any “Streetcar” usually travels with has been jettisoned. Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have performed the play as if it had never been staged before, with the result that, as a friend of mine put it, “you feel like you’re hearing words you thought you knew pronounced correctly for the first time.” Blessed perhaps with an outsider’s distance on an American cultural monument, Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have, first of all, restored Blanche to the center of “Streetcar.” – NYTimes\n\nMore on Blue Jasmine:\n\nPart 1 Actor as Auteur\n\nPart 3 Jasmine and Her Sisters\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / Google\n\nLike?
