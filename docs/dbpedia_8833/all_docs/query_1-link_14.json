        "text": "Is there anything Cate Blanchett can’t do?\n\nBlue Jasmine is a Woody Allen film that follows Jasmine, a woman who has lost everything, as she tries to rebuild her life in San Francisco with her sister. Jasmine is clearly very troubled and has been through a lot that she hasn’t processed through very well. She is a walking dumpster fire who is entertaining to watch, even if you are cringing at her 80% of the time.\n\nFar and away, the best part of this film is Cate Blanchett’s portrayal of Jasmine. We really see her shine in this incredibly complex role. Jasmine is a character who elicits pity, contempt, worry, and anger from the audience at various points throughout the film. Our perception of her changes as we see the story unfold before us. At times, she is tender and worthy of our sympathy. At other times she is absolutely insufferable and even abusive to those around her. Blanchett plays each and every turn of this character perfectly. The entire movie rests solely on her shoulders and she has enough acting chops to absolutely shine. This film would’ve been a complete flop without her.\n\nThe last scene of the film is haunting and by far my favorite part; I am still thinking about her final lines days after watching it. Her devolution is etched in my mind — what an absolutely phenomenal performance!"
