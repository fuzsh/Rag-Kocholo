The front-runner for Best Picture at Sunday's Academy Awards won five awards, including Best Feature, Best Director (Steve McQueen) and Best Supporting Actress (Lupita Nyong'o).\n\nOscar Surprises and Snubs: The Academy Loves Hustle, Jonah Hill, But Not Tom Hanks and Oprah\n\nIn the words of Sally Field, the Academy likes&nbsp;David O. Russell. It really likes him. On Thursday, Russell's&nbsp;American Hustle&nbsp;co-led (with&nbsp;Gravity) Thursday's Oscar nominations with 10, while Russell carved out a piece of Oscar history for himself: He's now the only director to have two films garner acting nominations in all four categories.
