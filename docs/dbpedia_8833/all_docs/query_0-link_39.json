        "text": "NEW YORK — When Woody Allen called Cate Blanchett with a “Blue Jasmine” role he’d written specifically for her, the two-time Oscar winner wasn’t about to say no.\n\n“I haven’t made a movie in a while, I’ve been out of this environment for almost six years,” Blanchett, 44, said, of running the Sydney Theatre Company in Australia with her husband, Andrew Upton.\n\n“With three children you have to be very excited to uproot them and take them out of school. But when Woody Allen calls I’d be a fool to say no.\n\n“My husband’s still running the Sydney company,” she added in a one-on-one interview at the Waldorf Towers, “and I love being onstage.\n\n“That’s why I loved working with Woody. With Woody you’re always aware of the audience and that’s what you really get onstage. Whether it’s who he is or it comes from the long hours he’s spent strutting the stage doing stand-up, he understands when an audience is with you and when they’re not with you.”\n\nSo Allen might say after a take, “That pause was too long for the audience.”\n\nCertainly Jasmine is one of the richest roles he’s ever written: A woman teetering between reality and fantasy, a walking nervous breakdown since her luxe life back East collapsed in a Madoff-style scandal.\n\nWhile in San Francisco to find refuge with her blue-collar sister, Jasmine clings to the vestiges of that old life as she looks for a new man to take care of her.\n\n“The further she gets away from that world, the more she clings to the memory of it,” the actress said.\n\n“Until she really is forced to look — as the film does — at what happens to her. Then she can’t escape it anymore. She can’t escape the fact that perhaps her fall from paradise — well, maybe it wasn’t paradise in the first place.\n\n“Those things, those designer clothes and handbags, can be a trap.”\n\nBlanchett follows this with December’s “The Monuments Men,” which re-teams her with George Clooney in a true World War II story.\n\nAs for seeing her as Galadriel in December’s “Hobbit” film, “I honestly don’t know whether I’ll be in that one or the next one. When I signed on, it was one film and now it’s not. So I don’t know.”\n\n(“Blue Jasmine” opens tomorrow.)\n\n— cinesteve@hotmail.com"
