Despite not writing or directing it, Blue Jasmine would not be as strong or even the same without her performance. Murtada‘s guest this week is writer and critic Matthew Eng.\n\nhttps://sundayswithcate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ep-14-blue-jasmine-part1.mp3\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / Google\n\nFollow along, the film is streaming at Amazon.\n\nWhat is the film about?\n\nFrom IMDB: A New York socialite, deeply troubled and in denial, arrives in San Francisco to impose upon her sister. She looks a million, but isn’t bringing money, peace, or love…\n\nWhen did it come out?\n\nJuly 2013.\n\nWho does Cate play?\n\nJasmine of course. One of her many titular characters.\n\nHow is Cate introduced?\n\nImmediately and memorably. Jabbering away about her life and marriage to a stranger on a plane, sets the tone for how unstable the character is.\n\nBox Office: Domestic = $33MM Int’l = $66MM\n\nMetacritic : 78 RT: 91\n\nTopics discussed:\n\nThe actor as auteur. Despite not writing or directing Blue Jasmine, the film would not be as strong or even the same with the performance.\n\nFrom the beginning we know this is going to be a performance driven film, Blanchett just holds the screen. I knew when she said to the cab driver “Can I have some privacy?” while trembling.\n\nTo prove our theory that Blanchett is in fact the author of the film; she pointedly thanked the dialect coach in her Oscar acceptance speech for “bringing Sally and I together,” notoriously Allen doesn’t rehearse or give feedback to actors, though he did tell her “you are awful.”\n\nThe work of the costume designer and the makeup artist in helping Cate craft this performance.\n\nCharting what collection of pills and booze Jasmine’s on at all times, and manifesting that in voice, body movement, sweat… the beat before every lie comes out of her mouse.\n\nHer performance in relation to the other actors? Blanchett’s always dominant in movies but the nature of this part showcases that more.\n\nThe film starts with a mention of “Blue Moon” and ends with it too, how that makes the performance so poignant.\n\nMatthew wrote about both Juliette Binoche and Meryl Streep as auteurs of their movies.\n\nFamous quotes:\n\nSO MANY. Who gets the credit Allen or Blanchett?\n\n“I saw you, Erika.”\n\n“What does that stupidity even mean?”\n\n“Anxiety, nightmares and a nervous breakdown, there’s only so many traumas a person can withstand until they take to the streets and start screaming.\n\n“Tip big, boys!”\n\n“Who do you have to sleep with around here to get a Stoli martini with a twist of lemon?”\n\n“I haven’t shown my face socially in so long”\n\n“New York, Park Avenue”\n\n“This was playing on the Vineyard. “Blue Moon”. I used to know the words.”\n\nScenes we liked:\n\nEverytime Cate is on screen basically.\n\nWhat seemed off :\n\nComputer-class subplot – in a lesser actor’s hand the tone deafness of this would be unforgivable. Yet I saw it as another way Jasmine is self-sabotaging.\n\nFilm within context of Cate’s career:\n\nConsidered the pinnacle of her career, won many awards for it including her 2nd Academy Award. It was a return to movie after a 6 year hiatus running the Sydney Theter Company.\n\nWhat reviews said of film / Cate:\n\n“Blanchett’s lavish, almost operatic turn as Jasmine sloshes against the sides of this insubstantial movie like liquid in a too-small container (maybe the room-temperature Stoli Jasmine is continually downing) There are many moments in which, as a viewer, you notice and admire Blanchett’s gestures and inflections, but very few in which you understand her deluded character’s motivations from the inside. She disintegrates beautifully before our eyes, not for any specific set of reasons the film maps, but because that’s what tragic heroines like Blanche DuBois are there to do.” – Dana Stevens, Slate\n\nIn Blue Jasmine, Allen is back in full-on sourpuss mode, even as he purports to be providing a grand showcase for Blanchett, the performance was touching in places, but it was also mannered and precise, like an artfully torn piece of silk. Blanchett strikes each note as precisely as if she were hitting the bars on a xylophone, and in this way, she fits into Allen’s schematic perfectly. – Stephanie Zacharek, The Village Voice.\n\n“The movie is almost meant to belong to Blanchett. Allen has set most of the film on her face and within her hopped-up, motormouth diction. The year thus far has been short on great performances. Blanchett’s belongs to a sadly exclusive club. She’s played Blanche DuBois on the stage. For Allen, she turns the character from a Southern belle into a Stockard Channing in Six Degrees of Separation. But it’s not snobbery she playing. It’s displacement. The separation is from reality. Allen makes use of Blanchett’s statuesqueness. In Ginger’s apartment, at that dentist’s office, in a taxicab, on the glamourless sidewalks of the Mission, Jasmine seems to be in the wrong Wonderland. Blue Jasmine is the searching Allen of Another Woman and Alice, and Jasmine is almost the sort of scornful id that Judy Davis was so good at playing for him. But where Davis came at the comedy with bile and Mia Farrow in Alice with whimsy, Blanchett is going for something unstable but secret. When Jasmine recalls the humiliation of a friend catching her working at a Manhattan shoe store and sneaking out, she goes hard and delirious: “I saw you, Erica Bishop!” Allen has always written good parts for women. This is one of the few to seem made of magic. You actually get the sense that Allen has let Blanchett go off on some kind of adventure, that he planted a seed and this is the wildflower that grew.” – Wesley Morris, Grantland\n\nMore on Blue Jasmine:\n\nPart 2 The Streetcar Illusions\n\nPart 3 Jasmine and Her Sisters\n\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts / Stitcher / Spotify / Google"
