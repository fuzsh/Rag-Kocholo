        "text": "When Cate Blanchett first cruises into Woody Allen’s “Blue Jasmine,” playing a Park Avenue matron fallen on hard times, she looks like a million bucks. She’s wearing pearls and a white Chanel jacket, with an Hermès bag as big as a Shetland pony hanging off one arm. It’s the sort of important accessory worn by women accustomed to being chauffeured around town. Soon after, though, as she stands with her monogrammed luggage on a nondescript San Francisco sidewalk, she looks frightened, alone — like someone who could benefit from some kindness. Instead, she waves off a stranger and, posing a question that’s as existential as it is practical, demands, “Where am I, exactly?”\n\nShe’s in the Mission, for starters, but Jasmine French — this lost, lonely woman brilliantly brought to quivering life by Ms. Blanchett — is more properly in a Woody Allen movie, his most sustained, satisfying and resonant film since “Match Point.” A moral fable about greed and comeuppance, crimes and misdemeanors, “Blue Jasmine” begins with a socialite brought low and evolves into a tragedy that becomes far greater than her own. It’s a familiar story with a few of the usual suspects, starting with the husband, Hal (a perfect Alec Baldwin, all smile and no soul), an investment type who has talked high yields all the way to prison. The government took him, and then it took the rest, leaving Jasmine with little more than her designer threads and luggage.\n\nBlanchett, Blanche — the names seem fated for each. Mr. Allen has said that he didn’t see Ms. Blanchett play Tennessee Williams’s most famous creation in Liv Ullmann’s celebrated 2009 production of “A Streetcar Named Desire” at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. (Jasmine’s appalled aside about being forced to move to Brooklyn after being priced out of Manhattan amusingly suggests why he didn’t.) Whatever his inspiration, he has been rummaging around in the classics for decades, so his appropriation of “Streetcar” doesn’t surprise. What does is his reimagining Blanche by way of another figure who changes depending on how you hold her up to the light, Ruth Madoff, the wife of Bernard L. Madoff, the investor turned avatar of a fallen world. It’s a masterly stroke that puts Jasmine’s dissembling into fresh, chilling perspective.\n\nFrom the moment Jasmine appears on screen she’s broken, and her contradictions — along with the vodka she guzzles and the Xanax she pops — keep her in pieces. She’s pathetic, absurd, complaining about being broke one minute and explaining why she flew first class the next. As she slips from tremulous flirtations to soused meltdowns, she elicits gasps of compassion and snorts of derision. Jasmine, née Jeanette, having reinvented herself, had risen to become a member of New York’s elite but, with everything gone, has come to San Francisco to move in with her sister, Ginger (played with anxious sincerity by Sally Hawkins). For Jasmine this isn’t a comedown, it’s a catastrophe — everything is. When she first walks into Ginger’s apartment, she stops dead, as if paralyzed by its unspeakable ordinariness."
