        "text": "Hat tip to Cate Blanchett for becoming the first actress this awards season, or any awards season for that matter, to compare working with a specific filmmaker to working in the sex industry.\n\nWhile speaking with London’s Daily Express, the actress spoke bluntly about baring herself emotionally for Blue Jasmine under Woody Allen’s tutelage. “Well, working with Woody is like an emotional strip club without the cash,” she reveals. “He’s got the clarity of someone who has done stand-up for so many years. He just knows when a gag works and when it doesn’t work, when a scene is moving or it’s not moving. That can be quite brutal—but when Woody Allen calls you, you know you are going to say yes. You say yes before you even see the script.” (Take a look at what this grueling director-actress dynamic yielded in the Blue Jasmine clip below.)\n\nIn the interview, Blanchett also says that, like Leonardo DiCaprio—who relied on YouTube videos to inspire his most drunken and drug-addled The Wolf of Wall Street scenes—she referred to the Internet for lessons on Xanax usage. “It’s amazing what you find on YouTube . . . Jasmine takes Xanax for her panic attacks and the amount of people talking about Xanax is huge, so I went on all those forums to make sure I got it right.”\n\nAfter Blue Jasmine, Blanchett says that she is eager to revisit another Oscar-winning filmmaker with whom she has already worked: Martin Scorsese. The actress, who earned an Oscar for her supporting role in The Aviator, says that she actually broached the director about a project. “I said to Martin Scorsese, ‘When are you going to make another film with a woman at the center?’” To the journalist, she then reprimanded herself: “You don’t tell Scorsese to make a chick flick!”\n\nTelevision\n\nCate Blanchett Faces Public Shaming in Disclaimer, Alfonso Cuarón’s Revenge Thriller\n\nThe Roma and Gravity Oscar-winner unveils his unsettling new series, which taps into the ancient human desire for schadenfreude.\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon Should End After Season Three\n\nHBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series had a mostly strong second season, but it’s time to start wrapping things up.\n\nPolitics\n\nHow Trumpworld Is Coping With the Kamala Harris Boom\n\nIn just days, the vice president has raked in more than $100 million, scored countless endorsements, started a social media phenomenon, and secured enough delegates for the nomination. “She has been totally dominating,” marveled one GOP strategist.\n\nTelevision\n\nJ.D. Vance’s Mythical Couch Tryst Is a Fact-Checker’s Nightmare. Stephen Colbert Explains Why.\n\nDuring his Late Show monologue, Colbert roasted Donald Trump’s running mate for the untrue (?) sofa-billy elegy currently delighting the internet.\n\nPolitics\n\nDemocrats Are Having Fun?\n\nThey just had to listen to voters.\n\nPolitics\n\nTrump’s GOP Swings and Misses With Desperate Attacks on Kamala Harris\n\nRepublicans built a campaign around assailing Joe Biden. But now he’s out and Trumpworld can’t seem to figure out how to hit Harris besides warmed-over racist and sexist insults.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings. So, in other words, we talk a lot of shit to each other.”\n\nNews\n\nWhat Kamala Harris Means for Democrats’ Chances in Battleground States\n\n“She’s been like a defibrillator to the Democratic Party in this race.”\n\nRoyals\n\nPrince Harry’s Calls to King Charles “Go Unanswered”\n\nThe monarch is reportedly no longer speaking to his younger son over Harry’s ongoing battle to secure enhanced security when he visits the UK.\n\nHollywood\n\nHarvey Weinstein to Face New Sexual Assault Trial in November\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan might bring new accusations against the previously convicted former movie mogul."
