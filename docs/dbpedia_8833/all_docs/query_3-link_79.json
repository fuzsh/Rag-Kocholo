        "text": "01 of 12\n\nCate Blanchett, Blue Jasmine (2013)\n\nNomination: Best Actress\n\nThe Role: An Upper East Side Blanche Dubois who is forced to rely on the kindness of strangers — or at least her working-class sister — when her fraudulent financier of a husband gets carted off to jail. Blanchett tightropes the very thin line between insufferable and pitiable as an inveterate liar whose nose is stuck so high in the air, she'd drown if it rained.\n\nIn a Line: ''Anxiety, nightmares and a nervous breakdown, there's only so many traumas a person can withstand until they take to the streets and start screaming.''\n\n02 of 12\n\nSally Hawkins, Blue Jasmine (2013)\n\nNomination: Best Supporting Actress\n\nThe Role: Ginger, the put-upon sister with a taste for blue-collar mooks and a heart about as big as Jasmine's sense of entitlement. She's more grounded than her sibling but she has her own ways of fooling herself. Sally Hawkins snagged her first nomination for her cheerfully empathetic performance.\n\nIn a Line: ''She's not just broke. She's all screwed-up.''\n\n03 of 12\n\nPenélope Cruz, Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008)\n\nWon: Best Supporting Actress\n\nThe Role: In a film filled with fiery dispositions, Cruz's flame burned the hottest as mercurial artist Maria Elena, who ends up in a polyamorous living situation with her ex-husband (Javier Bardem) and a traveling American (Scarlett Johansson). She's also the least stable leg of the relationship's tripod, and Cruz imbued her with a genuine manic insanity.\n\nIn a Line: ''¡Niñata de mierda! ¡Niñata de mierda!''\n\n04 of 12\n\nSamantha Morton, Sweet and Lowdown (1999)\n\nNomination: Best Supporting Actress\n\nThe Role: Without uttering a word, Morton lit up the screen as Hattie, a mute who falls into a relationship with a colorful but disillusioned jazz guitarist played by Best Actor nominee Sean Penn. It's as if she were giving a performance in a silent movie all her own. (She lost to Angelina Jolie for Girl, Interrupted.)\n\nIn a Line: ''...''\n\n05 of 12\n\nMira Sorvino, Mighty Aphrodite (1995)\n\nWon: Best Supporting Actress\n\nThe Role: With her first nomination, Sorvino earned an Oscar as Linda Ash, the wayward biological mother of Allen's adopted son. She's a prostitute and occasional porn star with a heart of gold (or at least gold plating) and the voice of Mickey Mouse. Her blasé attitude toward her profession provides many of the movie's best punchlines.\n\nIn a Line: ''You didn't want a bl--job, so the least I could do is get you a tie.''\n\n06 of 12\n\nDianne Wiest, Bullets Over Broadway (1994) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)\n\nWon: Best Supporting Actress (twice!)\n\nBullets Over Broadway\n\nThe Role: Wiest earned her second Oscar for a Woody Allen film with a very different performance, as a manipulative, alcoholic, and larger-than-life star of the Great White Way named Helen Sinclair. Replacing Holly's insecurity with Norma Desmond levels of ¬thespian grandeur and arrogance, she crafted one of the great comedic roles, which is exactly as broad as it needs to be.\n\nIn a Line: ''You stand on the brink of greatness. The world will open to you like an oyster. No, no, not like an oyster. The world will open to you like a magnificent vagina.''\n\nHannah and Her Sisters\n\nThe Role: Holly is a neurotic would-be actress, caterer, and former coke addict. She's the black sheep of the film's titular siblings, begrudgingly borrowing money from Hannah (Mia Farrow) and fighting with a friend (Carrie Fisher) over the affections of an architect (Sam Waterston). Thanks to Wiest's brilliant portrayal of long-bubbling resentments and petty jealousies, she ended up gathering up the accolades, alongside fellow Oscar winner Michael Caine as Hannah's adulterous husband.\n\nIn a Line: ''Of course I was so tongue-tied all night. I can't believe I said that about the Guggenheim. My stupid little roller-skating joke. I should never tell jokes. Mom can tell 'em, and Hannah, but I kill 'em.''\n\n07 of 12\n\nJennifer Tilly, Bullets Over Broadway (1994)\n\nNomination: Best Supporting Actress\n\nThe Role: While she lost to her costar, Tilly, as a gun moll named Olive, hilariously channeled the helium-voiced ditziness of Judy Holliday's Oscar-winning turn in 1950's Born Yesterday. Thanks to the connections of her gangster sugar daddy (Joe Viterelli), Olive lands a gig in a new Broadway play that gets much-needed rewrites from her Mobbed-up bodyguard (Chazz Palminteri, who earned an Oscar nomination of his own).\n\nIn a Line: ''Hey, didn't I tell you to make horse durves?''\n\n08 of 12\n\nJudy Davis, Husbands and Wives (1992)\n\nNomination: Best Supporting Actress\n\nThe Role: Sally is an intelligent, acerbic New Yorker with a failing marriage and a riposte perpetually on deck. Allen's examination of rocky couplings came out immediately after his own very public domestic falling-out with Mia Farrow. But it was Davis' riveting performance that helped turn people's attention away from the film's art-imitating-life implications. Though she lost the Oscar to Marisa Tomei for My Cousin Vinny, Davis achieved a perfectly controlled tornado of emotions when she was on the phone with her estranged husband (Sydney Pollack) and learned he was seeing someone new.\n\nIn a Line: ''It's the second law of thermodynamics: Sooner or later everything turns to s---. That's my phrasing, not the Encyclopedia Britannica.''\n\n09 of 12\n\nMariel Hemingway, Manhattan (1979)\n\nNomination: Best Supporting Actress\n\nThe Role: Allen's classic contains the elements that would come to define him: a love of NYC, a disdain for much of its intellectual set, beautiful black-and-white cinematography courtesy of Gordon Willis, and a relationship with a girl many years his junior. Hemingway was only 16 when she played Tracy, the high school naïf dating Allen's 42-year-old writer. She breathed life and tangibility into a difficult role, though Meryl Streep took home the gold for Kramer vs. Kramer.\n\nIn a Line: ''Six months isn't so long. Not everybody gets corrupted. You have to have a little faith in people.''\n\n10 of 12\n\nMaureen Stapleton, Interiors (1978)\n\nNomination: Best Supporting Actress\n\nThe Role: Arthur describes his replacement wife, Pearl, as ''full of energy and demonstrative and open'' — in other words, everything Eve is not. As Pearl, Stapleton brought the only real streak of emotional color to a film of muted grays, a vibrancy that's even more pronounced in contrast. Still, Maggie Smith took the prize for California Suite.\n\nIn a Line: ''You only live once, but once is enough if you play it right.''\n\n11 of 12\n\nGeraldine Page, Interiors (1978)\n\nNomination: Best Actress\n\nThe Role: Page played Eve, an interior decorator and materfamilias who spirals into depression when her husband, Arthur (E.G. Marshall), asks for a separation. Interiors was Allen's first stab at straight drama, a Bergmanesque tale of icy family relations, and Page's performance was one of perfectly crafted frailty. She lost to Jane Fonda that year but eventually won an Oscar in 1986 for Peter Masterson's The Trip to Bountiful with her eighth nomination.\n\nIn a Line: ''You've discussed this with Dr. Lobel behind my back. It's so humiliating.''\n\n12 of 12\n\nDiane Keaton, Annie Hall (1977)\n\nWon: Best Actress\n\nThe Role: The love affair between Keaton's necktie-wearing Annie Hall and Woody's Alvy Singer is one of differences: West Coast vs. East Coast, overfeeling vs. overthinking, Wonder Bread vs. rye. Keaton was Allen's first muse and Annie one of his best creations: a semi-articulate goofball who still comes across as a complex woman and not just a bundle of quirks.\n\nIn a Line: ''La-di-da, la-di-da, la la.''"
