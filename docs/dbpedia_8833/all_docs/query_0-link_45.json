        "text": "It’s hard to know where one might define the beginning of a blue period for Woody Allen, since that writer-director or his on-screen alter egos always seem to be down about something. At the very least, Mr. Allen’s next movie – one of the first he has made in the United States, after a run of European excursions – has a blue component to its title: it will be called “Blue Jasmine,” Sony Pictures Classics said Tuesday, announcing that it had acquired the film for distribution in North America.\n\nIn a news release, Sony said that the film is “the story of the final stages of an acute crisis and a life of a fashionable New York housewife.” Filmed last year in New York and San Francisco, “Blue Jasmine” features a cast that includes Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, Bobby Cannavale, Louis C. K., Andrew Dice Clay, Sally Hawkins, Peter Sarsgaard and Michael Stuhlbarg.\n\nNo release date for “Blue Jasmine” was announced. Sony Pictures Classics has released other Woody Allen films, including “You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger,” “To Rome With Love” and “Midnight in Paris,” which won an Academy Award for best original screenplay."
