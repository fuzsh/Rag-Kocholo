It stars Cate Blanchett as a New York socialite, Jeanette \"Jasmine\" French, who falls into poverty and homelessness. Alec Baldwin, Louis C.K., Bobby Canavale, Andrew Dice Clay and Sally Hawkins feature in supporting roles.[1][2] The film premiered in six theaters in New York and Los Angeles on July 26, 2013.[3] Sony Picture Classics later gave it a wide release on August 23, in more than 1,200 theaters in the United States and Canada. The film has grossed a worldwide total of more than $97 million on a production budget of $18 million.[4][5] Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, surveyed 223 reviews and judged 91 percent to be positive.[6]\n\nBlue Jasmine has garnered awards and nominations in a variety of categories with particular praise for Blanchett's portrayal of the titular protagonist. At the 2014 Academy Awards ceremony, Blue Jasmine had three nominations: Best Actress for Blanchett, Best Supporting Actress for Hawkins and Best Original Screenplay for Allen.[7] Blanchett was the sole winner.[8] At the 2014 Golden Globe Awards ceremony, the film had two nominations: Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for Blanchett and Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture for Hawkins, with Blanchett going on to win. Blanchett also won Best Actress at the BAFTAs, Screen Actors Guild Awards, Independent Spirit Awards and Satellite Awards.[9][10][11][12] Allen's screenplay was also nominated at the Writers Guild of America Awards.[13]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAward / Film Festival Date of ceremony Category Recipient(s) Result Ref(s) AACTA International Awards January 10, 2014 Best International Actress Cate
