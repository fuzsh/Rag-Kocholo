        "text": "Woody Allen's filmography spans over five decades and showcases his unique storytelling style. Beginning with comedies like \"Annie Hall\" and \"Manhattan,\" he explored themes of relationships and urban life. Allen's works often blend humor with introspection, tackling complex subjects with films like \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" and \"Hannah and Her Sisters.\" His European ventures, like \"Midnight in Paris\" and \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona,\" provide cultural insights. Allen's prolific output delves into psychology, morality, and existentialism, with hits such as \"Match Point\" and \"Blue Jasmine.\" Despite controversy, his influence on cinema remains undeniable, marked by witty dialogue and character-driven narratives.\n\nHere is the full list of The 10 Best Woody Allen Films:\n\nwww.highonfilms.com/best-films-of-woody-allen/"
