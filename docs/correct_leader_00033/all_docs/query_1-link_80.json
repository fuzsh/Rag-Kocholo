        "text": "Do you know who presided over the setting up of the National Health Service, or who served the shortest time as leader? Read our timeline of British prime ministers of the 20th century for all the answers.\n\nRobert Gascoyne-Cecil 3rd Marquess of Salisbury\n\nConservative 1895 to 1902\n\nSalisbury was the last peer to serve as PM (this was his third tenure), with the brief exception of Douglas Home (below) who renounced his peerage within a few days of being appointed.\n\nArthur James Balfour\n\nConservative 1902 to 1905\n\nBalfour was the nephew of the Marquess of Salisbury but his cabinet was divided on the issue of free trade and without the support of Edward VII he was forced to resign in December 1905.\n\nSir Henry Campbell-Bannerman\n\nLiberal 1905 to 1908\n\nFollowing Arthur James Balfour’s resignation, Edward VII invited the leader of the next largest party, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, to form a government. He was the first leader to officially use the title of ‘Prime Minister’.\n\nHerbert Henry Asquith\n\nLiberal 1908 to 1916\n\nAsquith is the only Prime Minister to have taken office on foreign soil. At the time that he succeeded Campbell-Bannerman, Edward VII was in Biarritz so Asquith travelled there for the official ‘kissing-hands’ ceremony.\n\nDavid Lloyd George\n\nLiberal 1916 to 1922\n\nOne of the 20th centuries most radical thinkers, Lloyd George was the first and only Welshman to hold the position of prime minister, introducing state pensions and waging a war on poverty.\n\nAndrew Bonar Law\n\nConservative 1922 to 1923\n\nLaw was prime minister for just 209 days. He retired due to ill health in May 1923 and died of throat cancer six months later.\n\nStanley Baldwin\n\nConservative 1923 to 1924\n\nBaldwin took over as prime minister after Bonar Law retired but he was soon ousted from his first term, albeit temporarily.\n\nJames Ramsey MacDonald\n\nLabour 1924 to 1924\n\nIn 1924 Ramsey MacDonald was asked by King George V to form a government when Stanley Baldwin’s Conservative majority proved ungovernable, and his was the first Labour government.\n\nStanley Baldwin\n\nConservative 1924 to 1929\n\nIn his second tenure as prime minister Baldwin extended the right to vote to women over 21.\n\nJames Ramsey MacDonald\n\nLabour 1929 to 1935\n\nIn his second minority government in 1929, MacDonald appointed Margaret Bondfield as the first female cabinet minister, but forming a cross-party government proved his downfall.\n\nStanley Baldwin\n\nConservative 1935 to 1937\n\nBy taking office as prime minister for the third time Baldwin remarkably served under three monarchs.\n\nNeville Chamberlain\n\nConservative 1937 to 1940\n\nChamberlain famously declared “I believe it is peace for our time” following a meeting in 1938 with Adolf Hitler.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nConservative 1940 to 1945\n\nFollowing Chamberlain’s resignation in 1940, Churchill succeeded him as prime minister of an all-party coalition government.\n\nClement Attlee\n\nLabour 1945 to 1951\n\nTaking over from Churchill at the end of the war, Attlee is perhaps best remembered for setting up the National Health Service.\n\nSir Winston Churchill\n\nConservative 1951 to 1955\n\nWhile serving his second term as prime minister Churchill was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953 for his many published works.\n\nSir Anthony Eden\n\nConservative 1955 to 1957\n\nEden is best remembered for his controversial handling of the Suez Crisis, which led to his resignation.\n\nHarold Macmillan\n\nConservative 1957 to 1963\n\nMacmillian took over as leader following Eden’s resignation and led the nation through the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was made Earl of Stockton in 1984 and died in 1986.\n\nSir Alex Douglas-Home\n\nConservative 1963 to 1964\n\nThe aristocratic Douglas-Home took on the trade unions but only served as prime minister for 363 days , the second shortest premiership in the 20th century.\n\nHarold Wilson\n\nLabour 1964 to 1970\n\nWilson won his first election in 1964 but he actually visited 10 Downing Street many years before, when he was eight-years-old, so his aspirations began early.\n\nSir Edward Heath\n\nConservative 1970 to 1974\n\nGrammar school educated Heath served in the Second World War, reaching the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nHarold Wilson\n\nLabour 1974 to 1976\n\nWilson famously rebuffed a schoolboy who threw a stinkbomb at him by saying “with an arm like that he ought to be in the English Cricket XI.”\n\nJames Callaghan\n\nLabour 1976 to 1979\n\nCallaghan is the only prime minster to have also held the three offices of Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary.\n\nBaroness Margaret Thatcher\n\nConservative 1979 to 1990\n\nA formidable leader or a tyrant? Britain’s first woman prime minister divided opinion like none before her, and she passed away in 2013.\n\nSir John Major\n\nConservative 1990 to 1997\n\nFrom his humble beginnings as the son of a former music hall star, Major was reportedly inspired to become a politician after watching Harold Macmillan present his only budget as Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nTony Blair\n\nLabour 1997 to 2007\n\nBlair was the longest serving Labour prime minister and although he initiated reforms in the House of Commons, he was criticised for his involvement in the Iraq War.\n\nRead more:\n\nBritish book settings you can visit\n\nYour July/August 2022 issue is here!"
