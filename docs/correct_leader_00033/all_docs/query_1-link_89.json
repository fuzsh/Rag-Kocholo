        "text": "Two weeks ago the United Kingdom held its first election since 1911. Because of the large numbers of postal ballots from men serving overseas with the armed forces, the votes are only counted today. And the result is a landslide victory for the Conservatives and Prime Minister Lloyd George‘s faction of the Liberals. Lloyd George has just led the country to victory against Germany, so it is perhaps not too surprising that voters have rallied to him and his Conservative allies.\n\nAsquith‘s faction of the Liberals win an impressive number of votes (only slightly less than Lloyd George’s) but lose most of their seats; Asquith himself fails to secure re-election. Aside from the coalition’s popularity, Asquith suffers from his own association with the less successful early years of the war. His long opposition to votes for women may also have counted against him now that women are voting for the first time. Labour meanwhile win more seats than the Asquith Liberals and substantially more votes than Lloyd George’s Liberals; although they are only the fourth largest party in parliament, their power is clearly on the rise.\n\nAlthough women now have the vote, the election is not a particularly successful one for women candidates. Christabel Pankhurst, a leading suffragette, narrowly fails to secure election and is defeated by John Davison of Labour. The only one of the sixteen women’s candidates elected is Constance Markievicz of Sinn Féin. Markievicz stood on an abstentionist ticket and is currently in jail, so she will not be taking her seat in the House of Commons.\n\nMarkievicz was elected in Ireland. The results there have followed an entirely different pattern to the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nimage sources:\n\nDavid Lloyd George (Wikipedia: David Lloyd George)\n\nResults map (Wikipedia: 1918 United Kingdom general election)\n\nToday the people of Britain go to the polls. The electorate has been greatly expanded since the last election in 1911: all men aged 21 and over are now able to vote, as are women over 30 if they meet minimal property requirements. No one is quite sure how this extension of the franchise will affect the composition of the House of Commons but all parties are competing for the attentions of the new voters. Prime Minister David Lloyd George hopes that the coalition government of Conservatives and his faction of the Liberals will be returned to office, while Labour and Asquith‘s Liberals are trying to overturn the government’s majority.\n\nAs well as voting for the first time, women are now also able to run for office, following a change to the law in November. However, only a small number of women have put themselves forward for election, including former suffragette Christabel Pankhurst, standing for the Women’s Party. Other candidates are running as independents or for Labour or the Liberals. In Ireland Sinn Féin has put forward two women candidates, Winifred Carney and Constance Markievicz.\n\nAlthough Britain votes today, it will be some time before the results are known. Because so many voters are still serving overseas in the armed forces, the results will not be counted until the 28th of December.\n\nimage sources:\n\nLloyd George campaigning (University of Oxford World War 1 Centenary: Lloyd George’s Ministry Men)\n\nCartoon from The Railway Review, newspaper of the National Union of Railwaymen (University of Warwick Library – ‘The parliamentary battlefield’: Government, Labour and the khaki election)\n\nNoel Pemberton Billing, MP and patriotic publisher, is being sued for libel by Maud Allan, an actress and exotic dancer. Pemberton Billing had already asserted that 47,000 British sexual deviants in prominent positions are being blackmailed by the Germans to sabotage the war effort. Then in his journal The Vigilante Pemberton Billing published a further article entitled ‘The Cult of the Clitoris‘, asserting that a Miss Allan’s private performance of Oscar Wilde’s Salome is a front for meetings of some of these 47,000 treacherous practitioners of unnatural vice.\n\nPemberton Billing defends himself at the libel trial. Proceedings at times become farcical. Pemberton Billing has claimed the existence of a Black Book listing all 47,000 of the degenerates being blackmailed by Berlin. It is somehow impossible to produce a copy of this book, despite the fact that numerous persons claim to have seen it. Eileen Villiers-Stuart, called as a witness in Pemberton Billing’s favour, asserts that listed in the Black Book are none other than Herbert Asquith, the former prime minister, as well as his wife, Margot (whom Pemberton Billing has previously accused of being Miss Allan’s lover). When the presiding judge orders Villers-Stuart to leave the witness box, she retorts that his own name is also included in the Black Book. Another witness makes much of Miss Allan’s decision to perform Oscar Wilde’s degenerate play on the Sabbath.\n\nPemberton Billing gains from the atmosphere of crisis engendered by Germany’s offensives in France. Today the trial ends; Pemberton Billing is cleared on all points. He receives a standing ovation from the court’s public gallery and then from a patriotic crowd gathered outside the court.\n\nIn some respects the trial is reminiscent of Mata Hari‘s conviction in France last year on espionage charges. Maud Allan has lost her case but she is perhaps lucky that she is not sent to the firing squad as a scapegoat for military failures.\n\nimage sources:\n\nNoel Pemberton Billing (Wikipedia)\n\nMaud Allan (Socialist Review: Homophobia in the First World War)\n\nsee also: Noel Pemberton Billing (Spartacus Educational)\n\nBritain’s political turmoil has come to an end. Asquith may have thought that by resigning as Prime Minister he would reveal the weakness of his opponents. If so he was mistaken. Admittedly Andrew Bonar Law, the Conservative leader, was unable to attract the support of enough Liberals to form a government. David Lloyd George however has better luck. He rustles up the support of enough of his fellow Liberals to form a stable coalition government with the Conservatives.\n\nAsquith remains leader of the Liberal party. Most prominent Liberals follow him out of government. However the party is now split into factions supporting either Lloyd George or Asquith.\n\nLloyd George’s appointment is bad news for both Haig, the Western Front commander, and Robertson, the chief of staff of the British army. Lloyd George is unimpressed with how they have been conducting the war. However he does not have any obvious alternative to Haig and Robertson’s approach. In any case, for the moment he feels too insecure in office to move against these powerful figures.\n\nimage source:\n\nDavid Lloyd George (Wikipedia)\n\nBritish politics is in a ferment. Prime Minister Asquith’s handling of the war is attracting much criticism from the press, who are arguing that the country needs more vigorous leadership. Asquith is also facing challenges from within the coalition government, with his Liberal colleague, David Lloyd George, the War Minister, and Andrew Bonar Law, Conservative leader and Minister for the Colonies, plotting against the prime minister.\n\nIn an increasingly excited atmosphere, Asquith attempts to sack Lloyd George and reconstitute his government, but then realises that this would lose him the support of the Conservatives and Lloyd George’s allies within the Liberals. So now he tenders his own resignation to the King. He is not quite giving up yet: the Liberal leader hopes that no one else will be able to form a government, which would see him recalled to the premiership.\n\nimage source:\n\nHerbert Henry Asquith (Miranda’s Space)\n\nAllied leaders are meeting in Paris to decide on how best to prosecute the war. The old argument between easterners and westerners continues. The representatives of Russia, Romania, and Serbia favour the despatch of a larger force to Salonika in Greece, to press the Central Powers in the Balkans. For the Serbs this might allow them to regain their country, now under enemy occupation, while the Romanians hope that an increased French and British presence in Salonika might save them from the same fate. The French however are more interested in concentrating on the Western Front, so that they can expel the Germans from their country. The British generals concur, while their politicians are more ambivalent.\n\nAsquith, Britain’s prime minister, attends the conference and dines with Haig. Asquith is pleased with the recent success the British have enjoyed at the Somme. Haig is pleased by this political vote of confidence. He orders his generals at the Somme to halt any further attacks for now, in case something untoward happens that displeases Asquith.\n\nWinston Churchill resigned from the British government after the failure of the Gallipoli campaign. He rejoined the army and served on the Western Front, commanding a battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers. But the military life turned out not to suit him, so he gave up his commission and returned to Westminster, where he remains a member of the House of Commons.\n\nChurchill has written a memorandum criticising British progress at the Somme. He argues that the battle is a waste of British lives and resources, with the minimal gains failing to justify the losses. He sees no prospect of a breakthrough and effectively calls for the offensive to be halted. Churchill’s letter is not made public but it is circulated to members of the Cabinet and the government’s War Committee.\n\nThe War Committee meets today. Robertson, the chief of staff of the British army, reads a report from Haig designed to counter Churchill’s claims. Haig claims three positive results of the battle so far. Firstly, the German pressure on the French at Verdun has been relieved. Secondly the German have been prevented from sending troops east to meet the Brusilov Offensive. And thirdly, the battle has had a generally positive effect on morale. Haig furthermore asserts that the British casualties suffered at the Somme are not particularly heavy. He recommends that the battle be continued, at least into the autumn, if not beyond.\n\nIf Churchill’s letter created any misgivings on the part of the politicians, Haig’s report dispels them. Asquith judges Haig’s resport to be “very satisfactory”. The Prime Minister instructs Robertson to reply to Haig assuring him that he retains the War Committee’s full support.\n\nimage source:\n\nWinston Churchill (Telegraph)\n\nIn Dublin the courts-martial and executions of participants in the recent rebellion have been continuing. Each execution must first be approved by General Maxwell, the military governor. Execution is meant to be reserved for ringleaders of the revolt, but Maxwell takes a generous view of who counts as a commander of rebellion.\n\nPearse, Connolly, Clarke and the other signatories of the rebels’ proclamation of independence have all now been shot, but so have some of the Rising’s smaller fish. Seán Heuston commanded a small detachment that was forced to surrender early in the revolt; he is now dead. James MacBride was only second-in-command of the rebel garrison at the Jacob’s Biscuit Factory, but he has long been a thorn in the side of the British so they are happy to send him to the firing squad. And Willie Pearse’s role in the revolt was pretty insignificant, but he is executed essentially for being Patrick Pearse’s brother.\n\nThe executions have led to increasing disquiet in Ireland and have begun to engender a sympathy for the rebels that was lacking during their revolt. In London, John Dillon of the Irish Parliamentary Party condemns the executions in the House of Commons while his party’s leader John Redmond makes representations to Asquith, the prime minister. Asquith is slow to act but now he obliges Maxwell to halt the firing squads. Seán Mac Diarmada and James Connolly die today, the firing squads’ last victims; Connolly is executed sitting in a chair as wounds sustained in the rebellion prevent him from standing.\n\nThe remaining rebels who were facing death have their sentences commuted to penal servitude for life. The most senior remaining rebel is Éamon de Valera, who had commanded the garrison at Boland’s Mill. Another prominent survivor is Constance Markievicz of the Irish Citizen Army, who was second in command at St. Stephen’s Green.\n\nimage sources:\n\nExecution (Militaria Archive)\n\nJames Connolly execution (The Daily Edge)\n\nBritish politics have been in flux since the eruption of the “shell crisis” and the resignation of Admiral Fisher. Many in the press and elsewhere are saying that Asquith’s Liberal government is not prosecuting the war effectively. The stalemate in Gallipoli is also being blamed on the government, with Winston Churchill, the naval minister, being most closely associated with the debacle.\n\nThe political crisis is so grave that the government ends up having to be reconstituted. Asquith forms a new cabinet with ministers from the Conservatives and Labour Party joining the Liberals. Asquith is able, for now, to keep the other parties from any of the key ministries; Andrew Bonar Law, the Conservative leader, becomes merely the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Nevertheless, the principle has been conceded that the Liberals are unable to prosecute the war on their own.\n\nWinston Churchill is no longer the minister in charge of the navy. He remains in the cabinet, but the price of the failure at Gallipoli is his demotion to a non-executive role.\n\nThe “shell crisis” has seen Lord Kitchener subjected to much criticism over his alleged inability to keep the army supplied with munitions. He retains his post, however, as he is a popular figure in the country as large. But responsibility for munitions is taken from him and given to David Lloyd-George.\n\nThe formation of this cabinet marks the end of Britain’s last ever wholly Liberal government.\n\nBritain, France and Russia have been discussing how to carve up the Ottoman Empire. The Allies are confident that Turkey is on its last legs and that one determined blow will knock it out of the war.\n\nAnd now Britain and France launch the blow they hope will finish off the Ottoman Empire. British ships have been bombarding the forts guarding the entrance to the Dardanelles for nearly a month. Today a Franco-British naval force (in which Britain has provided most of the ships) attempts to force its way through the Straits, from there to sail through the Sea of Marmara to the Bosphorus and Constantinople, the Turkish capital. The Dardanelles are defended by minefields, gun batteries and forts, but the Allies expect that their minesweepers will be able to clear a way through while the battleships’ guns knock out the Turkish shore batteries.\n\nBut things do not go according to plan. The battleships are unable to silence the Turkish guns and the Allied minesweepers are unable to operate effectively under enemy fire. Bouvet, a French battleship, hits a mine and sinks in a couple of minutes, with the loss of some 660 of its crew of 710 men. The British battleships Irresistible and Ocean also hit mines and sink, though their crews are successfully evacuated.\n\nThe Allied naval force is commanded by Vice-Admiral John de Robeck. Rather than see the rest of his fleet destroyed, he orders a withdrawal.\n\nBack in London, naval minister Winston Churchill wants de Robeck to resume the attack tomorrow. But Jacky Fisher, the commander of the British navy, thinks a purely naval assault on the Straits is doomed. Lord Kitchener, the war minister, and the Prime Minister, Henry Herbert Asquith, agree to halt naval operations.\n\nThe British do not abandon their plans to force passage through the Straits. The prospect of decapitating the Turkish Empire and reopening the trade routes to Russia is too enticing. Now, though, they realise that if the Straits are to be forced, they will need to land an army on the Gallipoli peninsula to seize and hold the Turkish positions there, to prevent the enemy from firing on minesweepers. Planning for this invasion now begins.\n\nimage source (Wikipedia)"
