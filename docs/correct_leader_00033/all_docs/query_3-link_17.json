        "text": "English poet, novelist, and lawyer (1881–1947)\n\nHerbert Dixon Asquith (11 March 1881 – 5 August 1947) was an English poet, novelist, and lawyer.[2] Nicknamed \"Beb\" by his family, he was the second son of H. H. Asquith, British Prime Minister and the younger brother of Raymond Asquith.[2]\n\nAsquith was greatly affected by his service with the Royal Artillery in World War I.[3] His poems included \"The Volunteer\" and \"The Fallen Subaltern\", the latter being a tribute to fallen soldiers. His poem \"Soldiers at Peace\" was set to music by Ina Boyle. His novels include the best-selling Young Orland (set during and after the First World War), Wind's End, Mary Dallon, and Roon.[2]\n\nIn 1910, he married Lady Cynthia Charteris, who was also a writer. She was the eldest daughter of Hugo Charteris, 11th Earl of Wemyss, and his wife, Mary Constance Wyndham.[2] They had three sons.[4]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
