        "text": "January 24, 2023\n\nThe Last of the Romans.\n\nHerbert Henry Asquith, 1st Earl of Oxford and Asquith is a name most people probably know, but a character and personality they are likely to know little about. He was the last prime minister of a wholly liberal government and the prime minster who took the United Kingdom and its Empire to war in 1914. He was prime minster for eight and a half years from 1908 to 1916 when he was brought down. Roy Jenkins has delivered two masterpieces of political biography in his Churchill and Gladstone books. Both which I highly recommend. However, here Asquith just doesn’t quite hit the mark in the same way. The text is dry, laborious and so unlike Jenkins’ other works.\n\nAsquith is still important and his period in history is extremely interesting. His premiership was dominated by the Home Rule debate in Ireland, an impossible task which he did not solve, with in early 1914, agreeing that Home Rule was needed but it would not be debated again until the following year. This was of course not Asquith’s fault, but the extremely volatile and complicated situation itself. Another heavy hitting subject was the question of women’s suffrage which was at the forefront of Edwardian politics. An idea alien to us today that women didn’t have the vote, again this was a hot topic at the time, which like Home Rule put extreme pressure on the PM and his cabinet. What I found surprising was that Asquith didn’t support giving women the vote, even though the majority of his political allies did. Asquith also dealt with the House of Lords by passing the Parliament Act 1911 which reduced its power to veto bills passed by the House of Commons, in such contributed to its already steps decline.\n\nWhat he will be remembered most for, however is how he lead the country into war in 1914. A huge turning point in history, Britain was changed forever with the move. Asquith is of course not to blame for the First World War, but he was at the centre of it for the first two years. Like so many others, the war was his undoing. Military failures like those of the Gallipoli campaign and the shell shortage scandal forced Asquith to form a coalition government. However this wasn’t enough to save him. The indefatigable campaign from the propaganda master and press baron Lord Northcliffe brought Asquith down. With it, the last of the old world order. The public was given David Lloyd George, and two more years of war.\n\nUnfortunately this social, intelligent family man hasn’t been given justice here. This surprises me from a talented author. But this was written 40 years before his Churchill. The book is also purely political, little is given on his home life or how he was as a husband or father, other than he didn’t really get on with his oldest son Raymond who was unfortunately killed at the front in 1916. Jenkins’ expert knowledge of British political history and parliamentary affairs does shine through, though which for the die hards is worth the read. However, a revisit to Asquith is needed and would be welcomed by me.\n\nFebruary 10, 2019\n\nPrime Minister Asquith occupies one of the chasms of world history: a man of a fading time, facing the problems of a new world. In Roy Jenkins's biography, the author traces the political career of Asquith from Liberal MP, member of Gladstone's cabinet, leader of the Liberal Party, and finally prime minister. During his tenure at 10 Downing Street, Asquith faces the momentous problems of Irish nationalism and Home Rule, the intransigence of the House of Lords, and the early years of World War One.\n\nIn some ways, Asquith has one foot very much in \"modern\" times, particularly in his progressive budget and fight against the veto power of the House of Lords. However, the man appears utterly Victorian in his sensibilities and style of leadership. Moreover, Asquith fails to see the horrors imposed by the war against the Central Powers, killing off the shining youth of the British nation and putting his country on the road to de-colonization and marginalization on the world stage.\n\nJenkins's biography is fine in relaying the facts and political to-and-fro, but lacks considerably in the department of understanding Asquith the man. Very little is written on Asquith's inner feelings, and even the First World War is treated as a backstage prop to the political maneuvering in London. The prose is clear and concise, though, and the facts dispensed fairly, if a bit too coolly."
