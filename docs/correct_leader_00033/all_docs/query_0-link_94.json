        "text": "The enactment into law in January 1916 of the first installment of mandatory military service in modern British history was an event whose importance few scholars dispute. While invariably considered a significant break in the British political and military tradition, recent scholarship has tended to treat the passage of the first Military Service Act as an episode that has little new to tell us about the political rivalry within the coalition cabinet presided over by Herbert Henry Asquith since May 1915. No student of the compulsory service debate can deny that he has been warned off, as Lord Beaverbrook wrote in the late 1920s that close study of the politics of conscription in the Asquith coalition would be “tedious to the last degree.” Most forbidding was the judgment of Lord Blake in his life of the Conservative leader Andrew Bonar Law: “The question of conscription would indeed be a tedious topic to pursue through all its ramifications. The endless discussions, the attitudes taken by public men at various times, the compromises, the disputes, constitute a chapter in English history to which, no doubt in years to come dull history professors will direct their duller research students.”\n\nMany historians of the world war who have found the subject less dull than implied above have concluded that it presents a straightforward story: the implementation of conscription came about because the traditional policy of voluntarism had proven insufficient to raise an army of adequate size. The episode has been judged essentially a triumph of the Tory right wing (with the collusion of the maverick Liberal David Lloyd George) over orthodox Liberalism.\n\n1 For the moment, the sole monograph on the conscription issue remains Hayes, Denis, Conscription Conflict (London, 1949)Google Scholar. There are a small number of works on the anticonscription movement during World War I, of which the most recent and the most insightful is Kennedy, Thomas C., The Hound of Conscience: A History of the No-Conscription Fellowship, 1914–1919 (Fayetteville, Ark., 1981)Google Scholar. Also very useful on the same subject is Rae, John, Conscience and Politics (Oxford, 1970)Google Scholar. Among the most useful discussions of the issue in the politics of the period are Wilson, Trevor, The Downfall of the Liberal Party, 1914–1935 (London, 1966)Google Scholar, chap. 3; Taylor, A. J. P., “Politics in the First World War,” in Politics in Wartime (London, 1964), pp. 11–44Google Scholar; and Gollin, A. M., Proconsul in Politics: A Study of Lord Mitner in Opposition and in Power (London, 1964)Google Scholar, chap. 11. See also the recent essay by Stubbs, John O., “Beaverbrook as Historian: ‘Politicians and the War, 1914–1916’ Reconsidered,” Albion 14, nos. 3–4 (Winter 1982): 245–48CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n57 Simon later recanted his decision to resign: “I have long since realised [he recalled in his memoirs] that my opposition was a mistake …. But where I was wrong was in failing to appreciate the psychological effect, alike on our allies and on the men in the field, who were hard pressed, and their anxious relatives at home, of this demonstration that we would stick at nothing” (Retrospect: Memoirs of the Rt. Hon. Viscount Simon [London, 1952], p. 107Google Scholar). It is interesting that, while Simon's judgment of the ineffectiveness of mandatory service is frequently cited by historians of the period, this admission by the only minister to resign over the question—which appears on the same page—is (in my experience, at any rate) forgotten."
