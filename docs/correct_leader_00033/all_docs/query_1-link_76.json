        "meta_description": "In April 1912, Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith introduced the third Home Rule (Government of Ireland) Bill to Westminster. In so doing, he ignited a crisis in both Ireland and Britain which consumed political discourse right up to the eve of the First World War and beyond. By September of 1912, the Ulster question took centre stage as the dominant issue holding back the constitutionally predetermined progress of the Government of Ireland Bill.This article considers two important developments pertaining to Ulster within the broader Home Rule crisis. The first is the definition and rationalisation of a two-state solution to the so-called ‘Irish question’ which in 1914 resulted for the first time in the drafting of proposals for an Irish border, initially as a strictly temporary measure. The second theme here is to examine how, from November 1913 onwards, Nationalist politicians gradually and grudgingly came to accept, on a strictly temporary basis, the exclusion of a portion of the province of Ulster from the jurisdiction of a Home Rule parliament. This culminated in the summer of 1916 with a convention of nationalist delegates from the six Ulster counties earmarked for exclusion. At this conference, the leading Nationalist MP in Ulster, Joseph Devlin, prevailed upon his followers to vote themselves temporarily out of a Home Rule Ireland so as to ensure the immediate enactment of Home Rule for the rest of the island. Although the deal upon which this pact was predicated failed, it marked the moment where Ulster nationalists consented to the principle of partition. The partition of Ireland became a reality in 1921 and has remained the bedrock of the two-state solution to the Irish question ever since.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Covenant, a year on\n\n21 O’Connor to Dillon, 30 Sept. 1913 (Trinity College Dublin, MS 6740/194).\n\nL[loyd] G[eorge] certainly sees all the difficulties of our assenting to the exclusion of Ulster – I mean, of course, in saying Ulster the four counties: – the desertion of our friends etc. ... It is evident to me that the Tory Party as a whole, is somewhat alarmed by the position of Carson and would grasp at any compromise which would save their faces.\n\n11O’Connor found that Dillon was away so, the following day, he wrote to Devlin explaining how:\n\n22 O’Connor to Devlin, 1 Oct. 1913 (National Library of Ireland, MS 15,181/3).\n\n23 Ibid..\n\n[Lloyd George] had proposed at the beginning of the struggle that Ulster sh[oul]d get this option [of a plebiscite], feeling confident then that it would be refused, and that he still thought this would have been wise tactics.\n\n[We] discussed quite calmly and amicably our difficulty in agreeing to a proposal which would look like the betrayal of our fellow-Nationalists in Ulster.\n\n12Devlin, Dillon, and Redmond all passionately felt the absolute necessity that no consideration should be given to concession, and that the rights of nationalists in all four provinces should be defended at any cost. By contrast, O’Connor had now revealed that he was willing to throw a still undetermined portion of Ulster open to a plebiscite.\n\n14Having found the Irish party intransigent, the Government was now forced to give some level of recognition to the growing potential for trouble in Ulster. What should be remembered is that all of this occurred before 25 November 1913 when the pro-Home Rule Irish Volunteers were founded and thus the only extra-parliamentary force in Ireland was the Ulster Volunteer Force. Faced with the growing popularity of paramilitarism among Ulster unionism, the government sought to assuage Carsonism. Having refused to agree voluntarily to compromises, the Irish party would now be prevailed upon to make concessions for Ulster.\n\n16At a time when much of these policies was being articulated from speaking platforms and in the press, the government urgently sought an opportunity to sit down with the Irish party and talk. On 13 November, Asquith wrote to Redmond requesting a meeting explaining that he was\n\n27 Asquith to Redmond, 13 Nov. 1913 (National Library of Ireland, MS 15,165/3). Emphasis in original.\n\n… anxious to have a talk with you […]\n\nI feel that in your speech at Newcastle you will be careful not to close the door to the possibility of an agreed settlement.\n\nI will only add, for the moment, that I am by no means sanguine that anything of the kind can happen. Nor need I assure you of the firm and unshaken determination of my colleagues and myself to attain with your help our common object.\n\n29 Ibid.\n\nthe Carsonites were in possession of at least five thousand rifles – probably more – and his information from the War Office with re-[gard] [sic] to the attitude of the Army was of a serious character, pointing to the probability of very numerous resignations of commissions of Officers in the event of the troops being used to put down an Ulster insurrection.\n\n22Referring to his scheme for temporary exclusion, Lloyd George’s memo noted that:\n\n36 Lloyd George, “Interview with Mr John Dillon, at No. 11 Downing St.”, 17 Nov. 1913 (Parliamentary A (...)\n\n[Dillon] was anxious the Irish leaders should be free during the next few months to state that no proposal of the kind had been made to the other side, and that they (the Irish leaders) had not assented to such a scheme. He thought that if put forward at the last moment, when the Bill was going through, it [temporary exclusion] might be tactically a very wise plan to propose, and that then the Irish leaders might carry it in Ireland.\n\nThe last hurdle: Devlin\n\nDrawing the border and the origins of permanent exclusion\n\nThe Three Schemes\n\nThe Bailey Scheme\n\nThe Robinson Scheme\n\n39On the eastern end of the boundary line, the Robinson scheme showed considerably more sympathy to Catholics than simple six-county exclusion. Robinson left south Armagh and south Down, including the heavily Catholic town of Newry, within Home Rule jurisdiction. By contrast, in the western half of Ulster, Robinson made a number of sweeping decisions that excluded large swathes of territory with solid Catholic majorities from the jurisdiction of Home Rule.\n\nThe Dougherty Scheme\n\n45Dougherty was a native of Garvagh on the other side of county Derry. Alongside the Catholic enclave constituency of West Belfast, the Derry conundrum seems to have been one of the cases which convinced Dougherty of the merits of whole-county plebiscites over constituency option. By having Derry’s county and city constituencies vote as a single unit, Derry city’s 56 percent Catholic majority was negated. With a reliable 54 percent overall Protestant majority, the full county looked certain to vote itself, including its maiden city, out of the jurisdiction of a Home Rule parliament. The manufacturing of majorities to suit desired outcomes had thus crept into policy thinking on the area for exclusion. If the Derry question could be solved by county option, the same logic did not settle the question of what to do with Fermanagh and Tyrone. With a combined Catholic majority of 64 percent, the decision over these two counties would impact upon an additional 204,501 Catholics for the sake of 113,755 Protestants.\n\n48As the table below illustrates, the exclusion of six full counties was the least sympathetic of the available options. However, from the perspective of administrators full county option had the advantage of being the least disruptive from a governance perspective. However, the power of unionism was the overriding factor.\n\nSummary of the schemes for the excluded area of Ulster, May 1914.\n\nThe Buckingham Palace Conference, July 1914\n\nWar and Rising: Nationalist desperation and Ulster exclusion\n\n97 O’Connor to Dillon, 18 May 1916 (Trinity College Dublin, MS 6741/308).\n\n... been with Joe almost night and day ... he [Devlin] is a man of somewhat uncertain moods, as you know, and now and then he relapses into regrets that he ever consented to help us with regard to Ulster two years ago; and things of that kind, which to me are sheer madness.\n\n57In the context of understanding the shape of the modern Irish border and in charting the path which led to nationalist acceptance of it, the 1916 Belfast conference represents a crucial juncture and the final milestone in the trajectory which this article intends to chart. The temporary exclusion which had been agreed to in principle by the Irish party leadership in March 1914 was now endorsed by a representative assembly of nationalists from the affected area. Although partition would take years to become a reality, all of its essential parts had been assembled by the summer of 1916.\n\nConclusion\n\n58The period 1912-16 witnessed a complete reversal in Nationalist policy on the Ulster question. Beginning with intransigent rhetoric about an indivisible island, by 1916 both the leaders and the followers of the Irish party had conceded willingly to the temporary partition of Ireland. However, the seeds of permanency were sown by their stance.\n\n59Nationalists at all times acknowledged the principle of consent over coercion. In practice, this signalled permanent exclusion and this maxim had been written into a secret cabinet proposal as early as 6 April 1914. Consent was part of the nationalist vision for a unified and united Ireland under Home Rule. They did not want to win a united Ireland by bloodshed. Despite their professed adherence to the principle of consent, nationalists clung to the idea that exclusion would be subject to strict legal time limits. Their logic was predicated on the idea that they could win unionists in the excluded territory over by their exemplary governance. However, so long as nationalists held on to the reasonable and democratic idea that Ulster should not be compelled by force to enter the jurisdiction of a Home Rule parliament, the overwhelming likelihood of permanent exclusion remained a fact.\n\n60Regarding the area for exclusion, if the principle of consent was firmly established in April 1914 then the rationale for excluding six full Ulster counties was determined by the Irish Office in May 1914. Following the impasse at the Buckingham Palace Conference in July, exclusion was hardwired into any future settlement. The point here is that both the shape and nature of the Ulster solution were all-but-set prior to the outbreak of the First World War. Nationalist delegates from the six counties were forced to go through the rigmarole of giving their approval to Lloyd George’s scheme a full two years after it had been determined to be the only remaining viable option.\n\n61The negotiation of the Ulster question should be seen as an example of the pre-war secret diplomacy which Woodrow Wilson derided in the advent of the Paris Peace Conference. In Ulster’s case, all the major players knew most (but not necessarily all) of the parameters long before these were put to the populations who would have to live with the consequences. The manufacturing of majorities prior to the holding of any plebiscite should likewise sound a note of caution to historians of Europe after the Armistice.\n\n62Irish historiography charts the origins of partition to the 1920 Government of Ireland Act; the establishment of the devolved Northern Irish state in July 1921; and the signing and ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty between December 1921 and January 1922. What this article demonstrates is that, six years before any of this, the scheme and shape of a permanently excluded six-county Ulster had been determined by a man who was then the Chancellor of the Exchequer but would go on to become Prime Minister from December 1916 until October 1922. In this later phase, Lloyd George oversaw the implementation of all of these ideas and witnessed the decline, departure, or death of many of the participants he had tangled with in the first phase of the crisis including Asquith, Carson, Devlin, Dillon, and Redmond."
