        "text": "I regret that the ref. to 'Brig Gen Cyril Asquith DSO' is in error,\n\nand in all probability, it refers to Brigadier General Arthur Melland Asquith DSO**\n\nwhose leg was seriously injured, then \"turned septic and, in the middle of January it was finally decided that the leg was never going to heal properly, and it was amputated below the left knee.\" See Command in the Royal Naval Division – A military Biography of Brigadier General A M Asquith DSO by Capt. Christopher Page RN, ISBN 1-86227-048-1\n\nCapt Page also mentions, probably from his records, A M Asquith's admission to '10th General Hospital at Le Treport, on the coast south of Abbeville, on 22 December, the diagnosis was 'GSW Left ankle, satisfactory, not known when he will be evacuated to England' (see page 170)\n\nregards\n\nMichael\n\nAntonia,\n\nMany thanks for posting all those names, though one nurse's name for the back row seems to be missing – do you have it?\n\nQuote: My Great-Aunt nursed at Lady Murray's hospital and a near-identical photo is in her album. Next to it are a couple of press cuttings, one about how Commander (later Brig. General) Arthur M Asquith (RNVR) won his DSO, and the other of the wedding of Brig. General Arthur Asquith to the Hon Betty Manners at All Saints Church, Thorney-Hill, Christchurch (unfortunately no dates but from the position in the album it could be 1916).\n\nArthur Asquith was described by Bernard Freyberg VC as the bravest man he ever knew. He was awarded the DSO on three separate occasions; for actions at Puisieux & River Trenches in February 1917 (LG April), at Gavrelle in April 1917 and near Poelcappelle in October 1917.\n\nAsquith was wounded (his fourth) at about 1.20pm on 20th December 1917. In a letter to his father he describes how he \"climbed out of a trench thinking there was enough mist to conceal me while I cast an eye over the lie of the land. A Bosche sniper, who had also, I suppose, taken advantage of the mist to advance his position, had three shots at me, one penetrating and, I fear, smashing up the left ankle joint: one kicking up the snow: and one grazing my right leg... … …\"\n\nAfter 13 hours on a train he arrived \"under the shade of Lady Murray's benign and matronly presence...\"\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the first operation did not suffice and the leg was amputated below the knee. On 23 February 1918, Asquith was transferred to the UK and to King Edward VII Hospital, Grosvenor Gardens, London, where his progress was sufficient for him to marry Betty on 30th April 1918.\n\n[details from Capt. Page's book, see post #3]\n\nAsquith, the father and former Prime Minister, is pictured on the above postcard surrounded by nurses. This is quite appropriate, since he used to visit the wounded at the London Hospital in the Mile End Road, when in fact he was only hoping to see one of the nurses there; Venetia Stanley.\n\nH H Asquith was not an effective Prime Minister. The first report of the Dardanelles commission found that [item L] \"There was no meeting of the War Council between March 19th and May 14th. Meanwhile important land operations were undertaken. We think that before such operations were commenced the War Council should have carefully reconsidered the whole position. In our opinion the Prime Minister ought to have summoned a meeting of the War Council for that purpose,...\"\n\nIf only H H Asquith had spent more time running the country and its war, and less time writing letters (sometimes three a day!) to this young lady, then...?... … …\n\n27 year old Venetia Stanley probably had more sense than the 62 year old PM: she informed him that she was to marry and could not see him again. Unfortunately, this event coincided with the Tory party's pressure to enter the government and simultaneously get their revenge on Churchill who had previously deserted them for the Liberals. Thus when Asquith should have been defending his government and his friends, he was distracted by the loss of his beloved female companion.\n\n[details from Sir Martin Gilbert as related in the chapter 'Footnote to History' in Steve Newman's book 'Gallipoli Then and Now']\n\nregards\n\nMichael\n\nHallo Michael\n\nThanks for the fascinating detail - it's why I love this forum!\n\nApologies - (I blame it on the new varifocals, which the optician SWORE were going to make my life so much easier ....); I should have counted up. Aunt Nellie's annotations were unusually irregular for this photo so it took a while to work out which name belonged to who (apart from Matron, Lady Murray and Mr Asquith, who were glaringly obvious).\n\nAfter more careful scrutiny, using a magnifying glass this time, I owe apologies to M Scott, who I somehow put down as M Beatty. In fact I think I've committed a major faux pas as it's probably Lady Margaret Scott, eldest daughter to the Duke of Buccleuch. And I think Aunt Nellie does appear: from comparisons to other photos that must be her between Marion Streatfeild (from her signature that is the correct spelling) and Captain Kirkwood. I have double checked against the photo originally posted on this forum, and it's definitely the same line-up (and Miss Murray still looks cheesed off, poor girl).\n\nI did wonder - is there any significance that some have the Red Cross on their aprons and others don't?\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAntonia\n\nAlthough the hospital was originally an independent unit, after June 1916 it came under the authority of the Joint War Committee, otherwise it would not have been allowed to continue within the British sector, although Lady Murray carried on putting up the money. Because we know the identity of the hospital the uniforms are clear cut. The women with the darker sleeves and large floaty hats are trained nurses, though not possible to say exactly how well trained - so the first three in the back row, counting from our left, and then one further along the line. Matron was, I believe, a Miss Jones, and I think would have been wearing navy blue, with the same large hat. Lady Murray was not a nurse, and her title was Directrice, but she paid the money and could wear more or less what she liked, and she obviously liked to dress as a nurse. All the other women with the handkerchief hats tied at the back are VADs. The wearing of the red cross on the aprons cannot really be taken as significant at all. Some units only allowed the red cross after a certain period of time - say a year or so - but some women wore them right from the beginning. As the war progressed and all things became in short supply they were often omitted simply as an economy. By that time there was a system of 'stripes' worn on VAD uniform to signify length of service.\n\nSue\n\nAntonia,\n\nSue Light has very kindly replied on the other thread\n\nAs this one seems to be suffering from gremlins and the links etc do not work\n\nI have copied Sue's reply below\n\nquote:\n\nAlthough the hospital was originally an independent unit, after June 1916 it came under the authority of the Joint War Committee, otherwise it would not have been allowed to continue within the British sector, although Lady Murray carried on putting up the money.
