        "text": "A hundred years ago this week, Herbert Henry Asquith became prime minister unchallenged, but in a unique manner. Unnoticed by journalists - those were the days - the then chancellor of the exchequer took a taxi to Charing Cross station. Travelling entirely alone, he took the overnight boat train to Paris, where he changed trains, arriving in Biarritz the next evening. The following morning Asquith kissed hands with Edward VII in the Hotel du Palais - still there to this day - and became prime minister, the only PM to have to travel abroad to take office. So began what would become, until Margaret Thatcher surpassed it, the longest premiership of the 20th century. And also, in recent times, one of the most neglected. Writing in Prospect magazine, Andrew Adonis argues that this reflects the ambivalence with which liberals look back on a premiership which, though it did much to launch the modern welfare state, was marked also by missed opportunities on education, women's rights and the House of Lords, mismanagement of Ireland and Europe, and ultimately by a catastrophic war from which neither Europe nor the Liberal party fully recovered. That Asquith also wrote some of the best letters penned by any politician and was patriarch to a still much-admired political dynasty are small compensation. He was not the first prime minister to leave a trail of might-have-beens behind him, and he will not be the last. This anniversary is a good moment to reflect afresh on one of the key British liberals."
