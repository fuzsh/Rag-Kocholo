H. Asquith from May 1915 to December 1916. It was formed as a multi-party war-time coalition nine months after the beginning of the First World War[a] but collapsed when the Conservative Party withdrew.\n\nThe new Cabinet included nine Conservatives and one Labour minister, but the Liberals continued to hold most of the important posts;[R. 2003] the Conservatives had demanded Cabinet seats, but they only received lesser positions. Not at all satisfied, Conservative Party leader Bonar Law continued the verbal attacks.\n\nThe ministry collapsed on 5 December 1916 as a result of Conservative resignations, who refused to serve under Asquith's leadership. Asquith and most of the Liberals then moved into opposition, while the Conservatives formed a new coalition with a minority of Liberals, under the leadership of Liberal David Lloyd George, the next day.\n\nPortfolio Minister Took office Left office Party (head of ministry)5 April 1908 ( )5 December 1916 (1916-12-05)Liberal Chancellor of the Exchequer27 May 1915 ( )10 December 1916 (1916-12-10)Liberal Lord Chancellor25 May 1915 ( )5 December 1916 (1916-12-05)Liberal 25 May 1915 ( )10 December 1916 (1916-12-10)Liberal Lord Privy Seal25 May 1915 ( )December 1916 (1916-12)Conservative Secretary of State for the Home Department27 May 1915 ( )12 January 1916 (1916-01-12)Liberal12 January 1916 ( )7 December 1916 (1916-12-07)Liberal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs10 December 1905 ( )10 December 1916 (1916-12-10)Liberal Secretary of State for the Colonies25 May 1915 ( )10 December 1916 (1916-12-10)Conservative Secretary of State for War5 August 1914 ( )5 June 1916 (1916-06-05)Independent6 July 1916 ( )5 December 1916 (1916-12-05)Liberal Secretary of State for India25 May 1915 ( )17 July 1917 (1917-07-17)Conservative First Lord of the Admiralty25 May 1915 ( )10 December 1916 (1916-12-10)Conservative President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries25 May 1915 ( )11 July 1916 (1916-07-11)Conservative11 July 1916 ( )5 December 1916 (1916-12-05)Conservative Minister of Blockade23 February 1916 ( )18 July 1918 (1918-07-18)Conservative President of the Board of Education25 May 1915 ( )18 August 1916 (1916-08-18)Labour\n\nThe Marquess of Crewe\n\n18 August 1916 ( )10 December 1916 (1916-12-10)Liberal President of the Local Government BoardMay 1915 ( )December 1916 (1916-12)Conservative Chief Secretary for Ireland23 January 1907 ( )3 May 1916 (1916-05-03)Liberal31 July 1916 ( )5 May 1918 (1918-05-05)Conservative Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster25 May 1915 ( )25 November 1915 (1915-11-25)Liberal\n\nHerbert Samuel\n\n25 November 1915 ( )11 January 1916 (1916-01-11)Liberal11 January 1916 ( )9 July 1916 (1916-07-09)Liberal9 July 1916 ( )10 December 1916 (1916-12-10)Liberal Minister of Munitions\n\nDavid Lloyd George\n\n25 May 1915 ( )9 July 1916 (1916-07-09)Liberal\n\nEdwin Samuel Montagu\n\n9 July 1916 ( )10 December 1916 (1916-12-10)Liberal Paymaster General\n\nArthur Henderson\n\n18 August 1916 ( )10 December 1916 (1916-12-10)Labour Minister without Portfolio25 May 1915 ( )December 1916 (1916-12)Conservative Postmaster General\n\nHerbert Samuel\n\n26 May 1915 ( )18 January 1916 (1916-01-18)Liberal18 January 1916 ( )5 December 1916 (1916-12-05)Liberal Secretary for Scotland\n\nThomas McKinnon Wood\n\n13 February 1912 ( )9 July 1916 (1916-07-09)Liberal9 July 1916 ( )5 December 1916 (1916-12-05)Liberal President of the Board of Trade5 August 1914 ( )5 December 1916 (1916-12-05)Liberal First Commissioner of Works25 May 1915 ( )10 December 1916 (1916-12-10)Liberal Attorney General25 May 1915 ( )19 October 1915 (1915-10-19)Irish Unionist3 November 1915 ( )10 January 1919 (1919-01-10)Conservative\n\nCabinet members are listed in bold face.\n\nOffice Name Date Party H.
