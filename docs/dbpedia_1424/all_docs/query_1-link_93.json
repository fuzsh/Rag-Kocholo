        "text": "There's something special about the summertime in the Treasure Valley. It seems we come alive when the sun is shining, patios open up, outdoor concerts entertain thousands and all of the great outdoor activities in our backyard come to life.\n\nAlong with these fun summertime 'things' come a few staples-- Boise Music Festival, for example.\n\nBack after a brief hiatus to wrap up our summertime celebrations?\n\nLatino Fest!\n\nWe're lucky to live in an area where so much diversity can contribute to our community and this is going to be a fun one on Saturday, August 24th!\n\nIn a statement posted to the Latino Fest webpage--organizers share:\n\nLatino Fest Boise has become the most awaited event of the latino community and local people for its focus on cultural enrichment in Boise. It is a famil event that grew 10 times in 5 years in attendance. It is remembered by many thanks to the community support, and its artistic expressions such as music, dance, international food, visual arts, workshops, and a lot of fun\n\nDowntown Boise has certainly missed the festival over the last couple of summers but we're excited to hear that the one-day festival is back.\n\nExpect a stage that will feature all sorts of live music, dj performances, and dance!\n\nWe're gluttons for some amazing locally made food and at Latino Fest, you can expect to see (and taste) flavors from all over Latin America--right in downtown Boise at Cecil D. Andrus Park!"
