        "text": "Halfway in between SORCERY’s Bloodchilling Tales, the famous Diablo videogame and a spinoff of Masters Of The Universe, Transylvanian Nightmare striking handmade artwork lets you know right away what the name of the game is doesn’t it? Those Mexican warriors may have started right after Covid and they surely didn’t stop since, this four-tracks EP being the follow-up to their debut album, Handed Execution and no less than three demos… Far being productive for the sake of it, it was actually a matter of forging (in fire) their own brand of classic speed and thrash metal and strike the iron while it was still hot. Hence Transylvanian Nightmare boiling like an unbridled volcano, ready to explode in your face…\n\nWhile the guitar solos and classic heavy metal arrangements abound here, PHANTOM undeniable biggest strength is their out-for-vengeance energy and neck-breaking pace. If the instrumental “Epitaph” features delicate acoustic arrangements and heart-breaking soaring melodies, the title-track is one ripping early-SLAYER like savage ride whereas closer “Raging Pyres” even adds hints of proto-death à la ONSLAUGHT to make sure no-one is left alive once those 19 minutes are over.\n\nReleased on vinyl with the highest standards available by DOOMENTIA, Transylvanian Nightmare is far just into a nostalgia trip but one fantastic METAL (yes, in capital letters) assault, so true to the vivid sound of 1986/87 speed/thrash metal than one could think the last thirty-five years had never existed!\n\nlimited to 300 copies on black vinyl\n\nsturdy 350gsm board w/glossy lamination\n\nphoto collage/lyrics insert sheet\n\nrelease and shipping date: 4th July 2024\n\nChile has become synonymous so much with high-quality and arcane sounding death and black metal that on the other hand, it tends to overshadow the rest of the metal scene, still one of the most vibrant and interesting of the southern hemisphere. BITTERDUSK are a perfect case of a band lost in the flow so to speak, even if they’ve been around in a way or another for over twenty five years.\n\nTruth be told, they haven’t seemingly been that active during that quarter of a century. Or so it seems as they have nevertheless managed in between 2002 and 2017 to put out, either self-released either through small local labels, three high-quality albums which sadly flew totally under the radar for whoever lived outside of their country. Others would have given up or feel happy just playing the same local clubs to the same local crowd. But not BITTERDUSK.\n\nThe boys rolled up their sleeves, took matter in their own hands, started opening for big international acts in Chile but also gigging abroad, including Europe, while working on what is probably their magnum opus, Guardián del Valle.\n\nEntirely sung in Spanish, rooted both in antique doom such as CANDLEMASS and BLACK SABBATH but also classic rock, this beautifully produced set has a class on its own, alternating instant hooks (see the super-catchy guitar lick of ‘Ojos de la Montaña’ for proof) with heavy-as-fuck parts, with everything adorned with that delicate and typically south-American sensibility, taking the listeners… Somewhere else. Somewhere in one of those luxuriant and grandiose valley Chile is now known for, where Nature roars free out in the open. Just like BITTERDUSK.\n\nFor the first time ever, one of their albums is being released in Europe and given the usual high-quality DOOMENTIA treatment so here’s the chance to climb that mountain and see the sun a little bit closer.\n\nLimited to 300 copies worldwide\n\nJacket printed on 350gsm\n\nLyrics sheet\n\nGERM BOMB and DOOMENTIA go way back, starting with the vinyl version of their second album, Sound Of Horns back in 2013, with Under A Fading Sun following two years ago. While Gist Sucked Out was put out udring the label hiatus, both parties are more than happy to renew their partnership with its successor, Monochrome Nightmare.\n\nStill led by the founding pair of Hempus Kuylenstierna (guitar, vocals, bass and organ) and Pierre Ohlsson (drums, vocals) Recorded in their hometown of Gothenburg at the Kust studio in between September 2022 and January 2023, album number five is one strange beast, both faithful to their D-beat/crossover roots with songs like ‘Narcissist’ while at the same treading on new, more rock n’roll ground but with an almost degenerate twist, such as on the opener ‘Nailed To The Cross’ or the post-punk pomp of ‘Sot’. Actually, the more you dive into the album, the more idiosyncratic it gets. Refusing to be pigeonholed yet with nevertheless his foot firmly on the pedal, the Swedish duo in their and self-proclaimed kings of ‘apocalyptic rock n’roll’ now in their fifteenth year of existence sounds more than ever like no-one else, even that means successfully inserting a French horn (!) into the mix like they did on ‘The Wolf’.\n\nDOOMENTIA has always been about supporting those who dare thinking out of the box. And no matter how punk they are, GERM BOMB most definitively fit the bill more than ever with Monochrome Nightmare!\n\nlimited to 300 copies\n\nblack vinyl\n\nsturdy cardboard 350gsm\n\nmatte resistant lamination\n\nreleased in cooperation with Insane Society records\n\nTo say that Belgium’s SCHIZOPHRENIA took the underground by storm would be an understatement. Ever since their first EP Voices four years ago and the following insanely intense debut album in 2022, those starving youngsters have reinjected a much need sense of urgency and danger in the otherwise now quite mundane territory separating thrash from death metal. By using elements of both and adding their own twist and fury to them, hey’ve become one of the hottest bands around. They may have spent most of 2023 with over 80 shows played all over Europe and be working, as we speak, on their second full-length yet they still did find time to record a very special EP, first released digitally and on self released CD but now available as a lavish, cut at 45 RPM speed to ensure the best sound quality possible LP thanks to DOOMENTIA.\n\nMeant to salute their wide range of influences, Chants Of The Abyss was destined to be a quite large selection of styles. And indeed, by opening the hostilities with a raging SLAYER tune (‘Necrophiliac’), the very first cover they worked on for this tribute, before switching to death metal (MORBID ANGEL’s immortal ‘Maze Of Torment’), classic heavy-metal (JUDAS PRIEST’s ‘Metal Meltdown’) and horror punk (MISFITS’ ‘Bullet’) before paddling back to old-school thrash (EXODUS ‘Strike Of The Beast’) and concluding on a hardcore note (GBH’s ‘Race Against Time’), it goes above and beyond its duty.\n\nWe’re not talking here of mere, carbon copy lazy covers but actual performances done with gusto, as if all those songs were theirs and freshly out of the rehearsal room. By paying homage to the godz, SCHIZOPHRENIA solidify their position as their legitimate heirs.\n\nTRANSPARENT RED ltd to 250 copies\n\nBLACK ltd to 250 copies\n\nLyrics sheet\n\nHELLISH CROSSFIRE has always been more than ‘just’ a band. Think of them as a gathering of like-minded maniacs, driven by their endless passion for 80’s metal and bands like KREATOR, BATHORY, VENOM and so on. Those Germans may have not been very prolific over the years but every single release of theirs, especially their two, pedal-to-the-max albums from 2006 and 2010, all had that special spark, the blazing fire burning inside only true dedicated warriors could provide. A true band of brothers, united ‘til the very end, even when one of them alas falls by the wayside…\n\nIn 2022, HELLISH CROSSFIRE four-stringer and founding member Sigi (aka ‘Sick’) passed away, leaving the black/thrash scene stunned and in disarray. After few months away from the public eye licking their collective wounds, not only has the band vowed to carry on but they’ve also decided to celebrate their fallen brother memory with a very special event. On December 1st and 2nd 2023, a festival, dubbed ‘Nights Of The Possessed’ and featuring bands like OLD, WITCHING HOUR, FATAL EMBRACE or DESASTER will be held in Hirschaid, Bavaria to pay homage to Sick.\n\nIn order to make this day even more special, in cooperation with DOOMENTIA, HELLISH CROSSFIRE have agreed to reissue for the very first time on vinyl their first official rehearsal tape from 2004, Unholy Tyranny plus the hardly distributed Demo II recorded the following year under the same conditions. Featuring a mix of later rerecorded songs for their debut Slaves Of The Burning Pentagram plus unreleased tracks, incl. a raging cover of the KAT classic ‘Metal And Hell’. Needless to say those versions are raw-as-fuck and not for the faint of heart but for the true metal fans!\n\n500 copies on picture LP, with two different versions each with a different picture of Sick on the B-side. Also included is an updated version of the Unholy Tyranny cover artwork originally created by Rok from SADISTIK EXEKUTION. Hail 80’s metal, hail HELLISH CROSSFIRE and Rest In Power Sick!\n\nPicture 12\" LP\n\n\"Pleasure to kill\" version limited to 250 copies\n\n\"Persecution mania\" version limited to 250 copies\n\nCircular die-cut jacket\n\nA4 insert sheet\n\nExclusive artwork by Rok\n\nRelease and shipping date 4th December\n\n\"Mörk himmel means dark sky. The name is Swedish, but also Norwegian and Danish. I'm fascinated Scandinavian culture, history, landscape and especially music. I really like our name. Say \"Mörkhimmel\", \"dark sky\" and \"temné nebe\" in succession. What do you think sounds best?\" (Slavek, singer of MÖRKHIMMEL)\n\nCzech band MÖRKHIMMEL has existed since 2007, but the more visible and successful era of existence began in 2012 after a line-up change and the release of the album \"Zloskřivec\". Experienced musicians, played in bands, now we can say legends of the Czech underground (MOTHER, THEMA ELEVEN, !ÚL, SEE YOU IN HELL or TUMMO / hardcore, sludge, thrash, death or black metal), found themselves in a combination of these genres and their metallic crust quickly established not only on the Czech scene, but also abroad. In 2014, the band came out with a well-reviewed album \"Ostří černé kosy zní\", played at big festivals and small clubs, toured Europe, spread their dark and dirty music everywhere, and was one of the first bands in the Czech Republic to unite the previously almost antagonistic scenes - metal and hardcore. Some at MÖRKHIMMEL appreciated the raven's vocals and the metallic sound, others the hardcore disjointedness and crust dirt, and the mix of all of the above came from a split with another Czech band, THE TOWER, released in 2017.\n\nAfter a few years of a slight downturn, MÖRKHIMMEL is back this year with new variations on previously presented musical themes, now spiced up with additional influences and unexpected practices. Texts remain in the Czech language and are in the times \"from the cradle to the black coffin\", as one of the verse, but there are no happy stories in them, it is rather an \"implosion of vanity\". Listen first single on YouTube.\n\nJacket with golden lamination and custom die-cut\n\nSilkscreen printed\n\nBlack vinyl\n\nPrinted sturdy inner sleeve\n\nLimited to 300 units only\n\nJapanese Heavy Metal warriors of METALUCIFER need no introduction to European die hard Metal fans, but they do not tour in Europe that often. This Autumn the band will play series of shows in Germany, Denmark, Belgium, France, Austria, Poland and Czech Republic, and to celebrate it, Doomentia Records will release special limited edition 12\" cut-out maxi single entitled \"Heavy Metal Bang Your Heads\", that includes title track in both English and Japanese versions. The release will be limited to 500 copies only.\n\nMETALUCIFER started in 1995 as a side project of Gezol, vocalist and bassist of the legendary Japanese Black Metal act SABBAT, but quickly turned into regular band with its own identity. Except releasing several mini albums, singles and live albums, METALUCIFER released 3 studio albums: “Heavy Metal Drill”, “Heavy Metal Chainsaw” and “Heavy Metal Bulldozer”. Their newest release entitled “Heavy Metal Ninja”, a special double mini LP – with 4 brand new songs recorded in 2 versions: with English vocals, and with Japanese vocals, came out in 2022. Love them or hate them – their unique style is like a statement. They don’t like or play heavy metal. They ARE heavy metal. Fans of early IRON MAIDEN, ANGEL WITCH, VENOM, HEAVY LOAD and other obscure New Wave Of British Heavy Metal acts: red alert!\n\n12\" cut-out vinyl maxi single\n\nWhite vinyl\n\nHoused in a sturdy discobag\n\nTour poster 600x600mm\n\nOne-time pressing only\n\nLimited to 500 copies\n\nFour months after the super-limited and already sold-out Cataract EP, ALTARAGE strike back with their sixth full-length, and first for DOOMENTIA since 2016’s Nihl.\n\nThose hooded musicians’ taste for thick and noisy layering is quite notorious and indeed, the guitars alone here are not just drowned in tar but are actually bathing in it in delight. Yet somehow for this quite concise album things are taking a slightly different turn here, the mysterious trio has somehow decided to stray away a bit from their usual path in order to achieve something even more unsettling and bizarre, yet as crushing.\n\nIf Worst Case Scenario eight tracks – including the song ‘Cataract’ already included on the EP of the same name yet here with a different mix – are once again some of the heaviest and noisiest bastard sons of the (un)holy trinity of black, death-metal and harsh noise you’ll ever hear this year, a new sense of clarity can felt through some of them. Far from away from the standard ‘metal’ production values and more akin to, say, a strung-out noise-rock band desperately looking for their next fix, instead of lessening their impact, this sonic revaluation maximizes it even more.\n\nYet at the same time, with songs for example like ‘The Rigid Subject’ or ’Exhaust’, ALTARAGE never sounded so chaotic and so on the verge of imploding, super-nova style. Proving once and for all that no other band sounds or even dares going as far as into the abyss as they do… Behold, Worst Case Scenario could well be your worst nightmare.\n\nFull-lenght album on LP\n\nCasewrapped gatefold w/ uv spot\n\nPrinted inner sleeve\n\n100x Ltd colored vinyl SOLD-OUT\n\n400x black vinyl\n\nThree live albums by old school metal bands Barbarian, Eurynomos and Nuctemeron from the last edition of the underground metal festival Thrash Nightmare in Písek, Czech Republic. You get energy and raw metal on black vinyls and live recordings of great and unforgettable shows at sold-out festival from leading names of European black/thrash scene!\n\nSaid about this release:\n\nBorys (Barbarian): \"We never had any plans of releasing a live album, but we felt so comfortable at Thrash Nightmare Fest and the level of energy was so high, that these recordings just couldn't stay shelved.\"\n\nAethon (Eurynomos): \"We really did enjoy the energy of the show, the maniacs in the first rows were true fistbanging wild warriors, just listen to „Spell of Necromancy“ where a stagediver cut the guitar.\"\n\nLunatic Aggressor (Nuctemeron): \"Live at Thrash Nightmare-official bootleg\" perfectly captures the absolute underground atmosphere of Thrash Nightmare. So the listeners of the record can expect the ultimate Black Speed Hell!\"\n\nOfficial live bootlegs\n\n3x 12\" LP\n\nInsert\n\nProfessional sound mix\n\nOne-time pressing\n\nLimited to 150 copies only\n\nRecorded on 14-15/10/2022\n\nEurynomos SOLD-OUT\n\nThe last time both DOOMENTIA and NEKROFILTH worked together, it was back in 2017 for the epic split with juggernauts CIANIDE. A year after that, the seminal Worm Ritual album was released. Then after a year of sporadic festival dates and the like, and the emergence of the pandemic, the band moved it´s home base to Portland in search of a fresh lineup / sound.\n\nIn early 2021, still in the depths of Covid, a death pact was formed with none other than DD LAZY, the sick freak behind Headsplit Records, Hemorrhoid, and many other atrocities! From this sickening union a hellish EP was formed. Recorded on a shitty old four track at the practice space, it has a truly weird and extreme sound, one that the underground maniacs have been craving! Even if you thought that earlier recordings like Worm Ritual were, indeed, filthy-as-fuck, you´ll still never know what´s going to hit you with Nganga. These four new exclusive songs, and first recordings in over three years, are just nasty man. Nasty. Zack Ripper´s guitar tone here is made of the same weird slimy mixture the toxic avenger had fallen into, backed by a nuclear and throbbing bass and the most vitriolic vocals you´ve heard this year. Punk-as-fuck, thrashing to the extreme and always on the verge of collapsing, to put it simple, NEKROFILTH has never sounded this pissed off!\n\nOn top of all of that, once again you can count on DOOMENTIA RECORDS for some seriously cool packaging. Strictly limited to 500 copies, this one-sided deluxe 12\" EP includes a lyrics sheet, circular die-cut jacket, which exposes, wait for it, a deep lenticular effect on the B-side to die for. You definitely don´t have anything in your collection like this! NEKROFILTH and DOOMENTIA RECORDS are fucking back!\n\nSpecial edition of 500 copies\n\nOne-sided 12\" MLP\n\nLenticular picture with a deep effect on the B-side\n\nJacket with circular die-cut, printed on both sides\n\nMangy lyrics sheet\n\nShipping: August 7th\n\nGranted, there’s been a bunch of so-called death metal “super-groups” since the dawn of the millennium. A gathering of talented, determined to show the kids how it’s done and what death freakin’ metal truly means. But very few, if none, had the impact DISMA had. Simply put, their debut demo The Vault Of Membros basically erased all competition back in 2009. Not only did this first recording mark the first collaboration in between INCANTATION “cult” front man Craig Pillard and early guitarist Bill Venner. Now joining with members of FUNEBRARUM. But its earth-shattering heaviness and supreme brutality set a new benchmark for downtuned dark doom/death metal.\n\nFan from day one, DOOMENTIA has been working with the band since 2011 and their first European tour. Besides two split EPs, DOOMENTIA set up new standards with the LP version of their sole album, Towards The Megalith whose diehard edition featured a six panel tri-fold fantastic sleeve with an extra inserted 7 inch.\n\nSince then, instead of putting out an endless stream of easily-forgettable releases, DISMA carefully choose to take their time and release the right songs at the right time. After some line-up adjustments, with now Craig Pillard handling both vocals and guitar duties. Their first new recording in five years, Earthendium showcases a continuous vision with even more effective and lethal firepower. Slightly doomier, yet still as crushing, these three new tracks (including the epic nine minutes long title-track) were recorded at the aptly titled, Neanderthal studios and proves than over eighteen years after their first rehearsal, DISMA remains one of the heaviest and rawest forces in death metal today.\n\nDOOMENTIA once again offered the band to take care of the LP version, determined to stay true to the standards set by Towards The Megalith twelve years prior and to release an easier-to-find version for European customers. Hence this extremely cool-looking one-sided lenticular 3D picture disc version. Ola Larsson’s spectacular dark-fantasy inspired art in all of its glory, displayed in a die-cut sleeve. A fitting monument to one of this years most impressive and dark-as-fuck EP's.\n\nSo be quick or be dead as this will be probably sold out in no time, as did all the previous DISMA releases on DOOMENTIA.\n\nSpecial edition of 500 copies\n\nOne-sided MLP\n\nLenticular picture with a deep effect on the B-side\n\nJacket with circular die-cut, printed on both sides\n\nThick insert\n\nIt would have been too easy wouldn’t it? After all, FORGOTTEN SILENCE could have easily capitalized on the current yearning for vintage mid-90’s extreme sounds. And weren’t the South Moravia-based sextet, next to others Czech Republic contemporaries such as SILENT STREAM OF GODLESS ELEGY, LOVE HISTORY or PARASOPHISMA, supposed to have live the tale and contribute forging that very peculiar sound? Except that you can’t just rewrite history because right from the very start, say around 1996 when they released their out-of-this-world debut Thots on Obscene Productions, they simply refused to play by the rules. And they still do to this day. Their brand-new album, and follow-up to the equally bizarre 2018 masterpiece Kras, is another tour de force, mixing death, doom, progressive rock, jazz and everything in between.\n\nAs all its predecessors, Vemork Konstrukt knows no boundaries. Yet its many left-turns are always at the service of the songs, thanks to crafty arrangements and the angelic voice of newcomer Andrea Baslova. A roller-coaster of emotions it might be but a concise one, as FORGOTTEN SILENCE have put a lot of efforts in their first recording in five years, resulting in a four-tracks 39-minutes long avant- garde masterpiece.\n\nWhile MAGICK DISK MUSICK will take care of the REGULAR BLACK LP (available here too), the long admirer of the band DOOMENTIA will take care of the LP version, culminating with a superb extremely limited diehard version. So join the dance!\n\nColored neon vinyl\n\n8-pages booklet\n\nOldschool logo metal pin\n\nPoster\n\nA5 plastic sticker\n\nJapanese metallic obi strip with numbering\n\nAll limited to 200 units only\n\nBoth CULT OF FIRE and DOOMENTIA have had a long appreciation for each other’s works for a long time so it was only a matter of time before the two get to collaborate together on a project. It finally came together earlier this year with the release of the special one-side EP Píseň černých Vran. And special indeed this was. Not only was it a vibrant tribute to their fallen brother from MANIAC BUTCHER but its deluxe and extremely elaborate packaging instantly set out new standards as well. But those standards are about to be obliterated by CULT OF FIRE themselves with the official release on the 12” shaped picture LP format of their brand new single, the mesmerizing Om Kali Maha Kali.\n\nHaving been the main them behind their second album from 2013, the Hindu goddess Kali makes here a welcome return thanks to some of the most majestic music the mysterious Czechoslovakia trio has ever unleashed. Fourteen minutes through two long and epic songs of pure melodic black metal bliss, permeated with Easter flavors and that unmistakably typical CoF aura, miles above the current average mediocrity of the scene and nearer than ever to the stars. But it’s truly the actual packaging of this band-new recording that will stand out as one-of-a-kind with one mantra on each side, a fantastic and detailed depiction of Kali herself on the cover and a very specially shaped picture disc.\n\nOne very important major statement of intent for both CULT OF FIRE and DOOMENTIA and already 2023 most ambitious EP, without a doubt. Behold!\n\nCollectors Edition\n\nLimited to 500 units worldwide\n\nCustom shaped 12” picture EP\n\nCut at 45 rpm for maximum sound quality\n\nHoused in a magnetic box with foam\n\nWrapped by printed custom made shiny sateen cloth\n\nInner coat displaying an ancient engraving of goddess Durga\n\nSpecial lid covered by foam protecting the record"
