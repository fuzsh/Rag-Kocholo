        "text": "“I think Stu Fine [owner of Wild Pitch Records] actually licensed the record to them — but they didn’t have a deal for the U.S.” Rob says. “So since the record was doing so big out there, Stu came to me as if he had no idea what was going on and he said, ‘Yo Rob, let’s put the song out. I mean it’s doing really well in Germany, we might as well make some money out this.’ It was me, it was my stuff, so I said, ‘Cool, let’s do it.’\n\n“We put the song out and then the next thing you know Arista Records decided that they wanted to put it out over here too, but since they couldn’t use me — they couldn’t just put out the same record — that’s when they got Turbo B to go in the studio and make the version that became Snap! It was Arista records versus Wild Pitch Records, so Wild Pitch lost — big time. Arista was global and Wild Pitch was like, ‘Who’s Wild Pitch?’ I was still running around, doing what I could do to help our cause, but we just couldn’t beat that money. Wild Pitch went in and did a remix to the remix and put out the song called ‘Power Jam’ and had this other female come in and try to sing the Jocelyn Brown part.”\n\nThe first version issued in America by Wild Pitch was billed as Power Jam featuring Chill Rob G and credited as “A Wild Pitch reconstruction of a Logic reconstruction of a Wild Pitch production by DJ Mark, The 45 King.” The video enlisted actress N’Bushe Wright to mime the Jocelyn Brown vocal, while the songwriting credits are shared between Benites, Garrett, Frazier and James [Michael Münzing, Luca Anzilotti, Chill Rob G and The 45 King].\n\nWhen the CD version of Chill Rob G’s Ride The Rhythm album was released on CD in 1990, “The Power” was credited to Nephie Centeno for production duties and had the entire hook re-sung by Kim Davis (but retained the original four writers credits). This version was also released as the second Wild Pitch issue of the single, but when the record was later re-issued a third time in 1998, Chill Rob G was credited as the sole performer, the original sampled hook was back and Toni C had been added as the fifth credited songwriter on the track (since he wrote Jocelyn Brown’s original song and had finally been properly credited).\n\n“My thought was, they had some music, they got ‘I got the power!’ and they said, ‘Let’s put a rapper over it!’’ comments The 45 King. “They just happened to pick Chill Rob G and that’s how it happened. Then the record became popular and they took Chill Rob G off and they put another guy on it. That’s all I really know. The only thing I wrote on that record was ‘Baaaaaaa’ [makes the horn sound]. I didn’t have nothing to do with it. The only reason my name is on it is I did the original record to Chill Rob G’s vocals. I think the record company [Wild Pitch] said, ‘If you’re gonna bite my vocals, I’m gonna bite your music!’ I have a feeling that’s how that happened. That was a big record for Rob. That was his biggest record, I believe. Snap! made it big and Chill Rob G was lucky.”\n\n“The ‘Power’ thing was a mixed blessing because I did get more notoriety,” says Chill Rob. “But now I was really looking at my contract with Wild Pitch. We were negotiating the second record, Stu Fine offered me this mad low number. I was insulted, I was like, ‘Nah, you crazy? I ain’t doing it.’ I walked off on him, that was it. They always had meetings in restaurants. Try to give you a cheeseburger to think he’s gonna get you to sign. ‘I ain’t signing for a cheeseburger this time, Stu!’”\n\nOnce Snap! had signed a distribution deal with Arista Records subsidiary Ariola Munich, the group remade the song with Turbo B and Penny Ford adding new vocals, while still retaining elements of the original samples (the hook and the “It’s gettin’ kinda hectic” line remain). To further confuse things, the version that you hear in the Snap! video with Penny’s adlibs (inspired by Chaka Khan’s “Some Love”) is different from the one included on the Word Power LP, which removes them for a more stripped-down mix.\n\nPenny Ford, as it turns out, has quite the musical heritage behind her. Her father, Gene Redd Sr. was bandleader and A&R man for King Records, the home to James Brown for many years and the place that he met Penny’s late mother Carolyn Ford-Griffith, a fellow musician. After singing at church and idolizing Chaka Khan as a child, Penny broke into the music business at 16 when she sang lead for a local band who invited her on a three month tour of Japan. When she returned, Penny stayed in L.A. and soon landed her record deal with Total Experience, releasing her debut solo album in 1984.\n\n“I left my first record company and took over as the lead singer of a group called Klymaxx,” says Penny. “Then they got some growing pains and everyone decided they wanted to go solo, and I quickly took over the lead position for the group the S.O.S. Band when their lead singer wanted to go solo. There was a period of me replacing lead singers, because I have a knack for sounding exactly like another singer, if they want that. Then I started working with Chaka [Khan] and Barry White and Prince and tons of other groups that I worked with in the studio or live.”\n\n“I’d moved to London and I was doing some writing,” continues Penny. “Chaka and I had an apartment together and they asked her to do the Snap! project. She was busy being Chaka Khan so she sent me to do it. The record was number one in several countries before Turbo and I even met. There was a guy, Rico Sparx, that was heavily involved in the beginning of that track even coming together, and he died and we buried him a couple of years ago. There were some ex-pat Americans that were from the military that were working along with the Snap! producers. [Turbo] was in the army and they just kind of found him. It was just developing as it went along. I believe that they had worked with Chill Rob G on the project, and I don’t know if it was whether he didn’t want to collaborate with them or he wanted to go and release it on his own version in America, so it ended-up with him going up against BMG, and of course the rest is history! [laughs]”\n\nThe fallout resulted in several radio stations and clubs blacklisting the group, while their tour with Soul II Soul was picketed by hundreds of angry protesters. Earlier in the same interview, Turbo also defended Snap!’s commercial success:\n\n“This is a business, right?” continues Turbo. “The object of the thing is to get paid, so if you direct your attention to one audience your income will be minimal. So all these people saying, ‘Ah, it’s diluting rap and they’re selling out!’ — check the bank account! It’s like N.W.A, right? They attract one type of audience. The people who listen to N.W.A cannot stand New Kids On The Block, but New Kids On The Block have made more money in a year than N.W.A will ever make!” [Editor’s note: Snap! and NKOTB both shared the same management at the time. It’s also fair to say that none of us saw Beats By Dre coming.]\n\n“It was like being caught in a cyclone, and sometimes when that happens it’s very hard to take it all in,” explains Penny. “It becomes a big blur at times, but it’s life and you’re living it. You either live it, or you don’t! [laughs] On the business end, people were grabbing for parts of the song, publishing on the song — it became a huge clusterfuck of greed. I left the group, because Turbo and I didn’t have the best communication relationship, to put it mildly. In defense of him and in defense of the group, nobody expected the project to be as big as it had gotten very quickly. When things happen like that, it tends to intensify parts of the character of people.\n\n“All those childhood issues are kinda mixed-up in there, and people dealing with their issues and trying to deal with being an international sensation all at once sometimes doesn’t make for a very good mixture. He was making decisions based on not having been in the business, where I’ve been in the business for several years. I was not wanting his choices to affect my journey. I went back to America and signed a solo deal with Sony, and I couldn’t work with Sony and sing with a BMG act. But they [Sony] didn’t have me signed as a writer, so the Snap! producers paid me to bring some American girls over and I got to write and get royalties from those songs [on the second Snap! album] as well.”\n\n“We tried to get together and do this reunion,” says Penny, when asked about the current status of Snap! “But it was kind of still the same thing, only intensified after twenty years. The touring thing is kind of my baby, they turned it over to me and what I want to do with it, as long as they have their involvement. [laughs] There wasn’t a demand for Turbo, cause he pretty much ruined his reputation over here, in a lot of circles. Michael Münzing is climbing the Appalachian Trail in America right now. Those guys are doing bucket list type of stuff, hanging out with their kids. They’ve been in that mode for many years now — seeing the world, fast cars — things like that.”\n\nTurbo B left Snap! and released a solo album, Make Way For The Maniac, in 1993, which featured a dis towards his old group on the title track, before he reunited with them in 2000 for a comeback attempt. Penny Ford currently lives in Germany and continues to perform Snap! shows around Europe. Chill Rob G is currently working on a new music project, while The 45 King has just released a series of record bags designed for 7-inch vinyl.
