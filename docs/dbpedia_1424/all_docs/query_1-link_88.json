        "text": "Shawn \"JAY-Z\" Carter, Damon Dash, Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke\n\nA list of dynastic Black music founders would be incomplete without the inclusion of Damon Dash, Shawn “JAY-Z” Carter, and Kareem “Biggs” Burke. In 1994, Dash and Burke, both natives of Harlem, joined forces with JAY-Z to help the Brooklyn rapper secure a record deal, first landing the upstart a singles deal with Payday Records. Failing to garner a serious offer from another label once their contract with Payday was up, in 1995, the trio took it upon themselves to launch their own imprint, Roc-A-Fella Records, which would become one of the seminal brands in Hip-Hop over the subsequent decade. Inking a distribution deal with Priority Records, Roc-A-Fella released JAY-Z’s debut album Reasonable Doubt in June 1996, which was hailed as a critical success and stamped the newcomer as one of the premier wordsmiths in rap.\n\nThe buzz surrounding Reasonable Doubt helped earn Roc-A-Fella a 50/50 partnership with Def Jam the following year, with Def Jam purchasing a 50% stake in the label for $1.5 Million. Returning with JAY-Z’s sophomore album In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 in November 1997, the trio capitalized on the momentum from the platinum-certified effort. Dash, Burke, and Hov took things into overdrive in 1998, topping the Billboard album chart with JAY-Z’s Grammy Award winning Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life album, which has sold over six million copies in the U.S. to date. The trio also released their first film, Streets Is Watching, which was accompanied by a soundtrack and marked the launch of the label’s film division.\n\nIn addition to R&B acts Christión and Rell, Roc-A-Fella signed rappers Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, Amil, and DJ Clue, all of whom appeared on his solo albums and released their own debuts on Roc-A-Fella. The label’s first artist besides JAY-Z, Bleek was introduced on the Reasonable Doubt song “Coming of Age” and released his Gold-certified debut Coming of Age in 1999. Beanie Sigel, and Amil, who both appeared on Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life, released their debut albums The Truth and All Money Is Legal in 2000, with Sigel earning a Gold plaque. That year also marked the return of Bleek, whose sophomore album The Understanding also reached the Gold mark, as did DJ Clue’s The Professional 2. By 2002, JAY-Z had become among rap’s most esteemed emcees, while Dash and Biggs were renowned for their business acumen.\n\nBuilding his legend with the chart-topping, platinum-selling albums Vol. 3… Life & Times of S. Carter, The Dynasty: Roc-La-Familia, and Blueprint 1 & 2, JAY-Z capped off his epic run with The Black Album in 2003. Dash’s reputation as a fiery deal-broker was well-earned, as moves like the launch of street wear brand Roc-A-Wear, Roc-A-Fella Films, and other offshoots of the label were credited to the Harlemite. The acquisition of new talent like Philadelphia’s State Property and Kanye West and free agents like Cam’ron and The Diplomats, M.O.P. and Ol’ Dirty Bastard was also indicative of The Roc being an attractive destination.\n\nIn December 2004, it was announced that JAY-Z, Dash, and Burke had sold the remaining 50% stake of Roc-A-Fella Records for a reported $10 Million, ending their decade-long partnership. In addition, it was also revealed that JAY-Z had accepted a position as CEO and President of Def Jam Recordings, retaining control of Roc-A-Fella, as well as his master recordings. He would bring along Roc-A-Fella artists Kanye West, Memphis Bleek, Young Gunz, and Freeway to join him at Def Jam, and sign Foxy Brown, Jadakiss, and Uncle Murda. JAY-Z also resumed his music career, releasing several more studio albums, all of which debuted atop the Billboard 200 and surpassed one million units sold.\n\nStepping down as President of Def Jam in 2007, JAY-Z inked a 10-year, $150 Million deal with Live Nation for his Roc Nation venture the following year, buying out his recording contract with Def Jam for $5 Million in 2009. Under Roc Nation, the rapper has helped shepherd the careers of Rihanna, J. Cole, Meek Mill, Jay Electronica, and others. In 2017, the rapper re-signed with Live Nation for another 10-year agreement, this time worth $200 Million. Now a billionaire and philanthropist, JAY-Z owns several businesses, including Armand de Brignac champagne and Monogram, and is the wealthiest musician in the world as of 2023, with an estimated net-worth of $2.5 billion. Dash has also found success post-Roc-A-Fella, founding DD172, BluRoc Records, and Damon Dash Studios, the latter of which has aired content on FOX Soul. In 2018, Burke executive produced the film, O.G. which premiered on HBO, and was nominated for an Emmy for his work on the film It’s a Hard Truth, Ain’t It, which he co-directed and executive produced. His management company, Circle of Success, has a roster that is headlined by rapper/singer/songwriter SAINt JHN and podcast host/media personality/rapper, N.O.R.E. of Drink Champs. It’s all still the ROC.\n\nJoaquin \"Waah\" Dean, Darin \"Dee\" Dean, Chivon Dean\n\nSpending their early years in the same apartment building where DJ Kool Herc rocked his first jam, Joaquin “Waah“, Darin “Dee” and Chivon Dean grew up Hip-Hop in the truest sense. Raised in the Bronx, New York, the Dean’s landed in Harlem following their parents divorce, where they gravitated to the streets, with Waah and Dee both serving stints in prison. Having survived close brushes with death, Waah took the advice of rap star Heavy D and joined his sister Chivon in her pursuit of a career in the music business. Founding the management company Special Effects in 1988, Waah was introduced to a rapper named Dark Man X, who would later come to fame under the name DMX. Taking on X as a management client, Waah dropped the name Special Effects, rebranding the company as Ruff Ryders after seeing a crew of Black cowboys in a western film. With Dee coming into the fold shortly after, the trio sought out a deal from the Yonkers native. In 1991, the Dean’s helped land X a contract with Ruffhouse/Columbia following his appearance in The Source magazine’s Unsigned Hype column, leading to the release of his debut single, “Born Loser,” in 1992 and the follow-up, “Make a Move” in 1994.\n\nAfter X was dropped from Ruffhouse, the family went back to the drawing board, showcasing the rapper through mixtapes and guest appearances. His verses on records like Mic Geronimo’s 1995 track “Time to Build” featuring Jay-Z and Ja Rule helped reignite his buzz, which coincided with the Dean clan signing on rap group The LOX (Jadakiss, Styles P and Sheek Louch) and Ma$e onto the Ruff Ryders roster. Securing both acts’ record deals with Bad Boy Records, Dee, Waah, and Chivon were now on the precipice of getting DMX the deal they’d been waiting on. In 1997, with Def Jam A&R Irv Gotti campaigning to have the rapper signed to the label, DMX was signed to Def Jam, releasing his debut album It’s Dark and Hell is Hot in 1998. Helping Def Jam survive a period of financial uncertainty off the back of its release, the album topped the Billboard 200 and reached multi-platinum certification while shifting the visual and musical landscape of rap. Returning in December 1998, months removed from the release of It’s Dark and Hell is Hot, with his sophomore album Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood, DMX became the first living rapper to release two chart-topping albums in the same calendar year.\n\nThe overwhelming success of DMX, as well as that of management clients Ma$e and The LOX, made the Deans sought after players on the executive level. Offered their own record label by Interscope Records founder Jimmy Iovine, the siblings launched Ruff Ryders Entertainment, which became a movement within music and beyond. Building a lineup that included Eve, Drag-On, Infa-Red, Cross, and others, Ruff Ryders Entertainment exploded onto the scene, with female rapper Eve making a star turn throughout 1999. Standout appearances on the label’s Ryde or Die Vol. 1 compilation, as well as her chart-topping, multi-platinum solo album Let There Be Eve…Ruff Ryders’ First Lady positioned the Philly native among the most popular women in rap. After releasing their debut album Money, Power & Respect in 1998, The LOX sought a release from their contract with Bad Boy, with Ruff Ryders buying them out from the label for $3 Million the following year. The trio released their Gold-certified sophomore album We Are the Streets, while Drag-On added to Ruff Ryders’ streak of Top 5 debuts with his own Gold-certified album Opposite of H2O months later. In late 1999, DMX returned with his third studio album ...And Then There Was X, which topped out at over five million records sold and remains his most commercially successful effort to date.\n\nEve scored another platinum plaque, as well as a Grammy Award, with her sophomore album Scorpion in 2001, while Jadakiss and Styles P unleashed their first round of solo efforts, both of which earned Gold-certification. Over the subsequent years, DMX remained steady with multiple platinum releases, while Eve, Jadakiss, and Styles P were reliable Gold artists. In 2003, Ruff Ryders’ deal with Interscope Records ended, with Jadakiss, Eve and Styles remaining on Interscope while the Deans signed a joint venture deal with Virgin Records, releasing albums from Drag-On and Jin before concluding that partnership in 2005.\n\nThe latter half of the decade saw Ruff Ryders drop its last albums from its core artists, with DMX releasing Year of the Dog… Again on Sony Urban Music and Columbia Records after departing from Def Jam, and Styles P’s Super Gangster (Extraordinary Gentleman) in 2007 and Jadakiss’s The Last Kiss in 2009 through Interscope Records and Def Jam Recordings, respectively. In 2010, the Dean brothers launched Ruff Ryders Indy, a global music distribution company and affiliate of Fontana/Universal. In 2020, the story of the label’s founders and talent were documented in the BET series Ruff Ryders Chronicles.\n\nTony Draper\n\nTony Draper‘s part in spreading the spirit of independence among aspiring southern music moguls cannot be overstated. Born in Memphis and raised in Houston, Draper got his start in the music business as a teenager, founding Suave House Records in 1990 at the ripe old age of 16. Choosing to launch his own label after failing to garner interest from major labels, Draper recruited former Geto Boys member Prince Johnny C as his in-house producer to help mold the smoothed out funk Suave sound. His maneuvering also is credited with helping Houston rapper Big Mike secure a deal with Rap-A-Lot Records. During a trip back to his hometown, Draper discovered rap group 8Ball & MJG, signing the duo as Suave House’s flagship act and releasing their debut album Comin’ Out Hard in 1993. Setting up shop, Draper’s utilization of one-stop distributors and local retailers paid off, as Comin’ Out Hard reached No. 40 on the Billboard 200 despite no attachment to a major label.\n\nThat initial success resulted in Draper and Suave House being courted by Relativity Records, inking a distribution deal in 1994 with the company that allowed him to retain the label’s master recordings. In addition to releases by 8Ball & MJG, including 1994’s On the Outside Looking In and the Gold-certified On Top of the World in 1995, Suave House built a strong core of artists, with Tela, Mr. Mike, and Crime Boss all releasing successful projects. Generating a reported $25 million in revenue during its time at Relativity, Suave House moved its operations over to Universal Records in a reported $15 million deal in 1997. That same year, MJG dropped his first solo album No More Glory on Draper Inc. Records, and 8Ball released his own platinum solo effort in 1998’s Lost. Draper also played a role in helping Bryan “Birdman” Williams and Cash Money Records get their own distribution deal with Universal in 1998.\n\nThe duo then released their fourth studio album, In Our Lifetime in 1999, which sold over a half million units. Suave House also signed Rick Ross and Gillie Da Kid during this period, both of whom would go on to have successful careers away from Suave House, which they credit in part to Draper’s tutelage. Following Draper’s brief distribution agreement with Artemis Records, under which Suave House released the 2000 compilation Suave House Presents: Off Da Chain Vol. 1, and JCOR (which distributed 8Ball & MJG’s fifth album 2000’s Space Age 4 Eva) the executive regrouped.\n\nThe subsequent years found the tenured vet assisting rap brothers, the Clipse, in being granted their release from Jive Records and brokering the five-year, 50/50 deal the group signed with Columbia Records. He also helped make Ice Cube’s Laugh Now, Cry Later album the highest selling indie rap release of 2006. In 2008, Draper signed a joint-venture deal with Koch to bring the second reincarnation of Suave House to the label. Dubbed Suave House II, the label released a greatest hits album from 8Ball & MJG titled We Are the South that same year. These days, Draper has placed his focus on giving back to the community through his Feed Your City Challenge, which he co-founded in 2020 and has included participants like Dr. Dre, Roddy Ricch, 2 Chainz, Nick Cannon, Pusha T, Jhene Aiko, and Trey Songz.\n\nIrv Gotti\n\nIn terms of scouting transcendent talents, few executives are held in as high esteem as Irving “Irv Gotti” Lorenzo, who is responsible for helping introduce three of the most successful rap artists of the late ’90s and early ’00s. Getting his start as a DJ in the Hollis section of Queens, New York, Lorenzo’s ear as a music man was first tapped as an A&R for TVT Records, bringing Mic Geronimo and the Ja Rule-led group Cash Money Click to the label. Also a producer, Gotti earned a credit for scoring “Can I Live” from Jay-Z‘s 1996 debut Reasonable Doubt and helped bring the Brooklyn rapper and his Roc-A-Fella Records imprint to Def Jam Records, where he served as an executive A&R. Also recruiting DMX and Ja Rule, both of whom released multi-platinum efforts in 1998, to the label, Gotti’s efforts helped propel Def Jam back to prominence and earned him a joint venture with the company for his own label, Murder Inc.\n\nInking Ja Rule as Murder Inc.’s flagship artist, Gotti and the label hit the ground running with Rule’s platinum-certified debut Venni Vetti Vecci in 1999. In 2000, Gotti unveiled Murder Inc.’s debut compilation The Murderers featuring Ja and additional signees Black Child, Tah Murdah, Vita, O-1 and Chris Black. Later that year, Rule released his sophomore album Rule 3:36, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and cemented him as one of the biggest solo stars in rap. Selling over three million units, the album was a massive success, earning Rule a nomination for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 44th Grammy Awards for the runaway hit “Put It On Me” featuring Vita.\n\nIn 2001, the label released the platinum-certified The Fast and the Furious soundtrack and Ja Rule’s third studio album Pain Is Love, his best-selling solo effort of his career. Gotti and Murder Inc.’s success would peak in 2002, with the label introducing R&B artist Ashanti, whose self-titled debut earned the imprint its third chart-topping album, its first Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album, and two additional nominations from the Recording Academy. That year also marked the release of Ja Rule’s platinum-certified fourth studio album The Last Temptation and Irv Gotti Presents: The Inc. reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and reached Gold certification.\n\nHowever, a raid of Murder Inc.’s offices in 2003 amid a federal investigation into Gotti’s relationship with convicted drug kingpin Kenneth “Supreme” McGriff and subsequent money laundering allegations would interrupt the label’s impressive streak. Despite Ashanti’s sophomore album Concrete Rose, newcomer Lloyd’s debut Southside, and Ja Rule’s Blood in my Eye and R.U.L.E. albums all reaching critical and commercial success, Gotti and Murder Inc. were ordered to leave Def Jam offices in late 2004. While Gotti and his brother, Chris, were exonerated on all charges, Def Jam opted not to resign Murder Inc. after their joint-venture agreement was up. This lead to the Gotti’s rebranding the label as The Inc. and signing to Universal Motown.\n\nThe latter half of the ’00s saw Ja Rule, Ashanti, and Lloyd releasing their last albums on The Inc., with the label shuttering before Gotti relaunched as an umbrella label under his Visionary venture in 2013. Gotti and Murder Inc. would partner with former Def Jam President Kevin Liles’ newly formed label 300 Entertainment in 2017, but has yet to release any new full-length projects. In 2022, Gotti announced that he had signed a $300 million deal with Iconoclast, under which he would sell a 50% stake in Murder Inc.’s master recordings, but remains the owner of the label. Gotti has transitioned into television with his BET network series, Tales, which leans on the themes of popular rap songs storylines. Murder Inc. has sold over 30 million units worldwide and has grossed upwards of $500 million to date.\n\nAndre Harrell\n\nThe desire to live a luxurious lifestyle is woven within the fabric of Hip-Hop culture, but Andre Harrell made it his business to cultivate a genre and aesthetic that mirrored those aspirations. Born in The Bronx, New York, Harrell’s first ambition was to become a newscaster, studying at Baruch College before pursuing a communications and business management degree at Lehman College. During that period, he teamed up with high school friend Alonzo Brown to form the rap duo Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, releasing the single “Genius Rap” in 1981 on Profile Records. Dropping out of college and getting a job at WINS radio, in 1983, Harrell was recruited by his best friend, Russell Simmons, to work with him at RUSH Management. Taking on the $200 a week gig and eventually serving as president and general manager of Def Jam Recordings, Harrell continued to perform alongside Brown, releasing their first and lone album, Champagne of Rap, in 1985. However, lackluster sales led Harrell to put the mic to the side and use his expertise and acumen into building his own record label. Leaving his post at Def Jam in 1986, Harrell launched Uptown Records, a company which would produce a melodic, yet streetwise brand of music that spoke to the clubs, avenues and boulevards of its namesake.\n\nHarrell and Uptown found early success with its flagship act Heavy D & The Boys, a rap group out of Mt. Vernon led by a hefty lyricist with a gregarious personality and a knack for dance-friendly hits. In 1987, their debut album Living Large, reached the Top 10 of Billboard’s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and was certified Gold. The group’s popularity skyrocketed during the late ’80s and ’90s, with their albums Big Tyme, Peaceful Journey, and Nuttin’ But Love reaching Platinum status, and Blue Funk earning a Gold plaque. However, Uptown’s reputation for slick R&B stylings would precede them, as Harrell and his artists helped usher in the New Jack Swing era of up-tempo grooves tailor-made for dancefloor. In 1988, Uptown introduced heartlorne crooner Al B. Sure!, who’s debut album In Effect Mode would be one of the defining works of the era. Released through Warner Music, the album hit No. 1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, produced several hit singles and was certified triple platinum. That same year, Uptown act Guy released their eponymous debut, which also topped the R&B chart and sold over two million copies. Both acts would also find success with their sophomore albums, with Guy’s The Future earning the trio their second platinum effort and Al B. Sure!’s Private Times…and the Whole 9! reaching Gold. In 1989, Harrell and MCA entered a distribution agreement, with the company cutting Harrell a check that made him a millionaire overnight. The pact would prove to be timely, as Harrell and his roster was on the brink of their most prosperous period yet. Other Uptown Records acts that released hits during the late ’80s and early ’90s include smooth rapper Father MC, R&B crooners Christopher Williams and Jeff Redd, but as New Jack Swing began to wane in popularity, a new genre coined Hip-Hop Soul was being birthed right under the label’s roof.\n\nUptown Records A&R Sean “Diddy” Combs helped develop new signees Jodeci and Mary J. Blige and groom them into bonadife stars and the faces of this new sound. First up was Jodeci, a vocal quartet that dominated the first half of the ’90s, with their albums Forever My Lady, Diary of a Mad Band, and The Show, the After Party, the Hotel accounting for more than 10 million records sold worldwide. In 1992, Mary J. Blige became the voice of yearning for Black women with her albums What’s the 411? and My Life, both of which were commercial monsters and have been hailed among the most impactful works of the decade.\n\nNot only a music man, Harrell’s contributions were also felt in Hollywood, as he was a producer of the 1991 cult classic Strictly Business. In 1992, he inked a massive $50 million multimedia contract with MCA that encompassed music, television, and film projects. The deal led to the creation of the hit TV series New York Undercover (which he executive produced), Uptown’s iconic MTV Unplugged special, and the production of the soundtrack to the 1993 comedy film Who’s the Man?\n\nAt one point, Uptown Records was the label home of late rap legend Biggie Smalls, who inked a deal in 1992. Releasing his debut single “Party & Bullsh*t” in 1993, he ultimately left Uptown amid Combs’ departure later that year. Harrell and Uptown’s success continued into the latter half of the ’90s, with R&B group Soul for Real, rap crew Lost Boyz, songstress Monifah, and Uptown mainstay Heavy D continuing to produce hit singles and albums for the label. In 1995, Harrell stepped down from his position at Uptown to take on a role as CEO of Motown Records, the label he once envisioned Uptown of replicating. Heavy D, the longtime executive vice president of Uptown, replaced Harrell as president and CEO before resigning in 1997. Upon MCA and Universal Studios being purchased by Seagram’s, Uptown was absorbed into Universal Music Group in 1999. Harrell stepped down from his position at Motown in 1997, moving on to take on others ventures in entertainment and business over the following decades. In May 2020, Harrell, who had gone on to join Combs’ REVOLT Media & TV as vice chairman, passed away at age 59.\n\nSuge Knight\n\nResponsible for building one of Hip-Hop’s most dominant empires, Suge Knight is a figure whose impact is as applaudable as it is infamous. The Compton native and former collegiate and professional football player first got his introduction to the music world as a promoter and bodyguard during the late ’80s. Forming his own music publishing company in 1989, Knight’s acquisition of royalties from Vanilla Ice’s 1990 chart-topping single “Ice Ice Baby” gained him a reputation as a shrewd and allegedly fearsome negotiator. These traits helped him in his role as a manager to stars like DJ Quik and The. D.O.C., the latter of whom assisted him in securing the core pieces of his next venture. Extricating Dr. Dre from his contract with Ruthless Records in 1992, Knight teamed up with the rapper and producer to form Death Row Records, a label that forever altered the musical and cultural landscape.\n\nDeath Row released Dr. Dre’s solo debut The Chronic in December 1992, which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and established the West Coast as the epicenter of Hip-Hop. With artists featuring appearances by Snoop Dogg, Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, Nate Dogg, Lady of Rage, the D.O.C., and RBX, The Chronic has achieved triple platinum status and is hailed among the most influential rap albums of all-time. The subsequent years would yield acclaimed, multi-platinum Death Row releases such as Snoop Dogg’s 1993 solo debut Doggystyle, 1994’s Murder Was the Case and Above the Rim soundtracks, and Tha Dogg Pound’s independently released 1995 album Dogg Food. That same year, Knight made rap’s greatest free agent acquisition upon inking Tupac Shakur to a contract with Death Row upon facilitating his release from prison. Instantly becoming Death Row and rap’s biggest star, 2Pac’s Death Row debut All Eyez on Me has sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. alone and offered several smash singles. In addition, Snoop Dogg’s sophomore album Tha Doggfather, reached double-platinum certification, extending Knight and the label’s momentum.\n\nHowever, the next year would become Death Row’s most turbulent, as the departure of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, and 2Pac’s murder sent the label into a downward tailspin. The posthumous release of 2Pac’s The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory, which debuted atop the Billboard 200 and sold four million copies domestically, caused a slight reprieve. However, Death Row and Knight’s run was cut short in 1997 after his conviction on a parole violation. Released from prison in 2001, Knight attempted to revive the label, now known as Tha Row, during the ’00s, signing TLC’s rapper, Lisa “Left-Eye” Lopes, Cali MC Crooked-I, and North Carolina king Petey Pablo, and others.\n\nThose artists would never release albums on the label, which would remain dormant throughout the decade amid Knight’s legal and financial woes. In September 2018, the mogul pled no contest to voluntary manslaughter in a fatal 2015 hit-and-run, and was sentenced to 28 years in prison. Death Row, which he lost control of in 2006, has since been acquired by Snoop Dogg in a deal with MNRK Music Group. Suge Knight’s career may be shrouded in controversy, however, with over 50 million units sold and over $750 million in revenue generated, he is undoubtedly one of the more successful founders Hip-Hop has ever seen.\n\nTed Lucas\n\nA great founder knows the importance of evolution, which is one of a number of traits that has made Ted Lucas a legendary Hip-Hop mogul. Born and raised in the city of Miami Gardens, Lucas began his career promoting concerts while playing college football, earning up to $20,000 per show. Parlaying those earnings, Lucas founded Slip-N-Slide Records in 1994, making his business partner Hollywood’s younger brother Trick Daddy Dollars the label’s marquee artist. Using $50,000 of his own money to distribute Trick’s debut album Based on a True Story through Warlock Records, Lucas’ gamble paid off, as the project received over 100,000 pre-orders.\n\nReleased in 1997, the album peaked at No. 59 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, sold over 350,000 copies independently, and provided a more streetwise counter to Miami’s signature brand of bass music. In September 1998, Slip-N-Slide went from a promising upstart into a nationally recognized brand with Trick’s sophomore album www.thug.com. Cracking the Top 30 of the Billboard 200, the Gold-certified album (his first as Trick Daddy) was led by the hit single “Naan Ni**a” featuring Trina, who would become a breakout star on the strength of her show-stealing performance.\n\nTwo years later, Trick dropped his third studio album Book of Thugs: Chapter AK Verse 47, nearly cracking Billboard’s Top 25 and earning the rapper his second Gold album. Barely a month later, Trina unleashed her debut Da Baddest Bi**h, which peaked at No. 33 on the album charts and was certified Gold, giving Lucas and Slip-N-Slide two bankable artists under its helm. One of rap’s most popular female artists, Trina would account for millions of sales while at Slip-N-Slide, releasing five studio albums on the label.\n\nReaching the apex of his popularity with his 2001 release Thugs R Us, which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and sold upwards of 1.8 million copies, Trick Daddy continued to remain a franchise artist. Receiving additional Gold plaques for his albums Thug Holiday and Thug Matrimony: Married to the Streets, the rapper departed Slip-N-Slide after the release of Back by Thug Demand in 2006, making way for Rick Ross to make the jump from the background to the forefront.\n\nReleasing his seismic debut single “Hustlin'” in 2006, Rick Ross’ Port of Miami album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, giving Slip-N-Slide its first chart-topping effort in the label’s history. Ross, whom Lucas bought out of his contract with Tony Draper‘s Suave house, would go on to release several successful albums during his tenure on the label, four of which debuted atop the chart and earned Platinum or Gold certification. Despite the label’s name, Lucas and his company remained sturdy throughout the ’00s and beyond, with Florida rapper Plies becoming the new face of Slip-N-Slide with a string of Platinum and Gold singles and albums.\n\nWith over 30 million records sold and successful partnerships with Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment over the past 25 years, Ted Lucas is one of the more decorated CEOs in the game and has the stats to back it up. Lucas has joined the fight for Black representation within tech spaces. In addition to being the co-founder of the Miami NFT Week conference, Lucas’ non-profit organization Technolij recently opened the doors to its Innovation Center at Florida Memorial University, South Florida’s only HBCU. In 2023, Slip-N-Slide continues to hold strong, with a roster that includes Plies, Teenear, F$O Dinero, Mike Smiff, Sebastian Mikael and more.\n\nJ. Prince\n\nThe entrepreneurial spirit among rap founders in the south is often attributed in large part to the influence of one James Prince, who single-handedly helped lay the blueprint for aspiring moguls below the Mason-Dixon. A native of Houston, Texas, Prince co-founded Rap-A-Lot Records with Cliff Blodget in 1986. The first artist was his younger step-brother Sir Rap-A-Lot, who formed the first incarnation of the Ghetto Boys with members Raheem and Sire The Jukebox. Following a string of single releases by the Ghetto Boys and the group’s debut album Making Trouble, as well as Raheem’s A&M Records distributed 1988 release The Vigilante, Ghetto Boys was rechristened as Geto Boys, with a new lineup featuring previous member Bushwick Bill and soloists Scarface and Willie D. The breakout success of Geto Boys 1989 album Grip It! On That Other Level led to a distribution deal with Rick Rubin and Geffen Records, but Rubin’s split from Geffen resulted in Prince inking a distribution deal with Priority Records in 1991.\n\nAchieving platinum status with Geto Boys’ third studio album We Can’t Be Stopped and the gold-certified Scarface’s solo debut Mr. Scarface Is Back, Rap-A-Lot’s stock rose exponentially during the early ’90s, with acts like Seagram, 5th Ward Boys, Odd Squad, Big Mello, Big Mike and others joining the label. Ending its partnership with Priority in 1994, Rap-A-Lot was distributed by Noo Trybe Records (1994-1998) and Virgin Records (1998–2002), which marked Prince and the label’s most fruitful period.\n\nWith three platinum-certified albums (The Diary, The Untouchable, My Homies) and one gold album (The Last of a Dying Breed) during the decade, Scarface established himself as the preeminent soloist out of the south, while Big Mike, Do or Die, and Geto Boys also dropped commercially successful releases. Moving its operations to Asylum Records during the ’00s, Prince and Rap-A-Lot’s run continued, with Pimp C, Bun B, and Yukmouth earning gold plaques, and artists like Z-Ro, Devin the Dude, Tela, Trae tha Truth, and others waving the flag. He and his son, Jas Prince, also famously helped discover Drake and helped broker the deal between the future megastar and Young Money Entertainment in 2009. Following a stint with Fontana Distribution, Prince announced a deal with RED Distribution in 2013. In addition to his work in the music industry, Prince operates a 1200-acre ranch and has managed multiple boxing stars, including Andre Ward, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Winky Wright, Roy Jones Jr., Diego Corrales, Hasim Rahman and, most recently, Shakur Stevenson. The tenured CEO’s profile has risen in recent years, with his son J. Prince Jr.’s Mob Ties imprint inking rising Memphis rap star Finesse2tymes. He has also been honored at the VH1 7th annual Hip Hop Honors Awards and received an honorary doctorate degree in the form of a doctorate of humane letters from Texas Southern University in 2019.\n\nAntonio \"L.A.\" Reid\n\nAtlanta is universally viewed as a hotbed for Hip-Hop culture, but that reputation was non-existent upon Antonio “L.A.” Reid’s arrival in the city. Born in Ohio, Reid was first a drummer for R&B band Pure Essence during the ’70s, later joining a group of musicians and singers to form The Deele in 1981. After the group disbanded, Reid and groupmate Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds forged a partnership, co-founding LaFace Records in 1989. Launched as a joint venture between the pair and Arista Records, LaFace scored early hits from R&B duo Damian Dame, but truly hit its stride in 1992 with R&B trio TLC’s multi-platinum debut Ooooooohhh… On the TLC Tip, which amassed over four million copies sold in the U.S.\n\nReleasing CrazySexyCool in 1994 and FanMail in 1999, the group finished the ’90s as one of the most commercially successful acts in music. In 1993, vocal siren Toni Braxton dropped her self-titled debut, which was a massive hit, selling over 10 million copies worldwide and winning the newcomer three Grammy Awards. Braxton’s hot streak continued throughout the ’90s, as her 1996 album Secrets became her best-selling album with over 15 million copies sold worldwide. Her third studio album, The Heat, stamped her as a veteran hitmaker. Another talent LaFace nurtured was Usher, who blossomed from a teenage heartthrob into one of the best-selling male vocalists of his generation. Releasing several albums under Reid, including his breakout album My Way and the Diamond-certified Confessions, Usher has credited a large portion of his success to Reid and LaFace’s tutelage.\n\nL.A. Reid‘s wins in the R&B world are endless, but his resume of legendary rap acts he’s helped discover can also rival some of the most esteemed executives in that realm. In 1992, Reid signed a group named Outkast, which not only solidified LaFace, but Atlanta’s standing among rap fans. In 1994, Andre 3000 and Big Boi unleashed their debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, which was certified Platinum and praised as one of the stronger debuts in what was a loaded year for the genre. Famously proclaiming that the South had something to say at the 1995 Source Awards, the duo made their sentiments clear, releasing a string of acclaimed albums (ATLiens, Aquemini, Stankonia), that were commercially successful, conceptually ambitious and sonically refined.\n\nIn 2003, Outkast pushed the envelope even further with their Speakerboxxx/The Love Below album, which was certified Diamond and won multiple Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. In addition to Outkast, Goodie Mob was another signing that helped propel LaFace to legitimacy in Hip-Hop. Releasing three consecutive Gold albums (Soul Food, Still Standing, World Party) within a five-year span, the group, along with acts like Society of Soul, Donell Jones, and P!nk proved that Reid and LaFace were capable of identifying talent, regardless of genre.\n\nThe late ’90s and early ’00s saw LaFace introduce fresh faces like Youngbloodz and T.I., both of whom released their debut albums on the label during a period of transition for the company. In May 2000, Edmonds and Reid sold their remaining 50% stake in LaFace to parent company BMG, with LaFace being absorbed by Arista Records and Reid being promoted to president and CEO of Arista. Appointed to Chairman/CEO the following year, Reid was released from his contract with the company in 2004, becoming the Chairman/CEO of The Island Def Jam Music Group. During his tenure, the label helped bolster the careers of numerous stars including Kanye West, Rihanna, Mariah Carey, Justin Bieber and Jennifer Lopez.\n\nStepping down from his position at Island Def Jam in 2011, Reid took over at Epic Records, helping bring the label back to prominence with key signings like Future, Travis Scott, DJ Khaled, and more topping the charts during his time at the company. In 2017, Reid departed from Epic following accusations of inappropriate behavior by a female coworker, claims he has said are not a reflection of his history or character. The founder of HitCo Music Publishing, Reid also became founder and co-chairman of Hitco Entertainment in 2018, taking on major signees like Outkast rapper Big Boi and Texas rapper Yella Beezy. In 2022, HitCo Entertainment was sold to Concord Music Group.\n\nSylvia Robinson\n\nPrior to Hip-Hop’s growth into an industry of its own, Sylvia Robinson cemented herself as the Godmother of the culture. Born Sylvia Vanderpool, the Harlem, NY native began her journey in music as an artist, first performing under the stage name “Little Sylvia” before forming the duo Mickey & Sylvia with Mickey Baker, scoring the chart-topping R&B hit “Love Is Strange” in 1957. Marrying Joe Robinson in 1964, the pair would operate several recording studios and nightclubs before founding their first record label, All Platinum, in 1968. Continuing her music career with her 1974 solo hit “Pillow Talk,” Robinson and her husband ran several other labels during the ’70s and acquired the Chess Records catalog in 1975. However, the Robinsons ran into financial hardship during the latter half of the decade, resulting in the couple filing for bankruptcy.\n\nIn 1978, Sylvia attended a birthday party in Harlem, where she was first introduced to Hip-Hop after hearing rap pioneer Lovebug Starski rhyme over an instrumental break of Chic’s “Good Times.” Enamored with the bubbling genre, Robinson saw the future, founding Sugar Hill Records in 1979 with her husband and recruiting the label’s first rap act The Sugar Hill Gang.The group’s first single, “Rapper’s Delight,” was released that same year and put rap on the map as a commercially-viable brand of music. Garnering significant radio airplay, the single peaked at No. 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, the first rap release to crack the Top-40, and reportedly sold 50,000 copies a day at its peak. The label would house many of rap’s pioneering acts including Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (“The Message,” “White Lines (Don’t Do It)”), Funky Four Plus One (the first rap group to appear on national television), Crash Crew (“Breaking Bells (Take Me to the Mardi Gras)”), The Sequence (the first female rap group signed to a record deal), Treacherous Three and the West Street Mob. Sugar Hill Records also released the first full-length rap albums in the genre’s history and was responsible for the first all-rap tours with their Sugar Hill Revue concerts during the early ’80s.\n\nEarning a landmark distribution deal with MCA Records in 1984, Sugar Hill would end its run by 1986, with Sylvia divorcing Joe and continuing to make an impact in the music industry. Forming Bon Ami Records in 1987, Sylvia signed New Jersey rap trio The New Style, which would later find success as Naughty by Nature after leaving the label. Launching Diamond Head Records in 1994, Sylvia eventually retired from the music industry, handing over the reins of her business to her three sons. Sylvia Robinson passed away on September 29, 2011, but continues to be honored for her contributions, receiving a posthumous induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Ahmet Ertegun Award category in 2022, becoming the second woman to earn that accolade. A biopic on Robinson’s life, which will be written by Malcolm Spellman, Carlito Rodriguez and Tracy Oliver, is reportedly in the works and slated to be produced by Warner Bros.\n\nRussell Simmons\n\nWhen looking at the makeup of the modern Black music mogul, the prototype can be traced back to Russell Simmons, who broke down various barriers while simultaneously becoming rap’s first celebrity executive. Born and raised in Hollis, Queens, Simmons caught the Hip-Hop bug in the ’70s as a student at City College of New York, where he befriended Kurtis Blow, becoming the future rap star’s manager. Spending the early ’80s taking on clients like Whodini and Jimmy Spicer, the fast-talking deal-maker struck paydirt with Run D.M.C., his brother Joseph “Reverend Run” Simmons’ rap group, which earned a recording contract with Profile Records in 1983.\n\nReleasing their debut single “It’s Like That/Sucker MCs” in late 1983, the trio released their self-titled debut album Run-DMC. the following year, establishing the group, and Simmons, as a force to be reckoned with. Looking to fully capitalize off of his cultural expertise and relentless hustle, Simmons partnered with producer and Def Jam co-founder Rick Rubin in 1983. Gaining traction with early single releases by T La Rock’s “It’s Yours, “LL Cool J’s “I Need a Beat,” and Beastie Boys’ “Rock Hard,” Def Jam’s early success earned the label a distribution deal with CBS Records in 1985, with LL Cool J’s debut album Radio being its first album release. Over the latter half of the decade, Def Jam established itself as the preeminent record label in Hip-Hop, with Simmons leading the way.\n\nKrush Groove, a 1985 film loosely based on Def Jam’s origins, helped bring Hip-Hop to the big screen, opening the door for countless movies inspired by the culture and music. Depicted by Blair Underwood in the film, Simmons quickly became the poster-child for the new class of Black businessmen more comfortable in streetwear than designer suits. His popularity was only exceeded by his victories, as he helped Def Jam compile a roster of talent that included superstars like LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, Slick Rick, 3rd Bass, and others. He also helped manage the likes of Eric B & Rakim, Stetsasonic, EPMD, Run-DMC, DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, Big Daddy Kane, The Real Roxanne and more under his Rush Management company, while further bolstering Def Jam’s stable with the launch of Rush Associated Labels in 1990.\n\nSimmons further expanded his portfolio over the next decade, placing his imprint on television (Def Comedy Jam), film (The Nutty Professor and Def Jam’s How to Be a Player), and clothing (Phat Farm and Baby Phat) while continuing to enjoy success with the signing of acts like Onyx during the early ’90s. After CBS folded in 1991, Def Jam was absorbed by Sony Music, with PolyGram purchasing a 50% stake in the label in 1994. Following a resurgence off the strength of the blockbuster signings of superstars like DMX, Jay-Z, Ja Rule and others, in 1999, Simmons sold his remaining stake in Def Jam Recordingsto Seagram’s Universal Music Group for a reported $100 million. In 2004, Simmons sold Phat Farm and Baby Phat to the Kellwood Company for $140 million, later launching his Russell Simmons Music Group, a record label founded as a joint venture with Universal Music’s Island Def Jam Music Group that same year. In 2017, Simmons stepped down from his position at Def Jam amid several sexual assault accusations, claims which the mogul has denied.\n\nAnthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith\n\nThe revival of a whole coast is no easy task, but Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith and Top Dawg Entertainment have proven themselves up for the challenge. Tiffith, a native of the Watts section of Los Angeles, started off as a producer, earning credits on records by The Game and Juvenile before deciding to form TDE in 2004. The label caught its first taste of recognition with signee Jay Rock, a prized prospect who was the centerpiece of a joint-venture deal with Warner Bros. in 2007. Releasing the single “All My Life (In the Ghetto” featuring Lil Wayne and will.i.am, Tiffith left Warner and later Asylum after multiple delays to Jay Rock’s debut album Follow Me Home.\n\nBy this time, the TDE roster had expanded, with rapper Kendrick Lamar beginning to gain steam as a rising star following the release of his Kendrick Lamar EP and Overly Dedicated projects. Lamar and fellow TDE artists ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul would team up with Jay Rock to form Black Hippy, furthering each individual and the label’s reputation within the rap industry. In September 2010, TDE President Terrence “Punch” Henderson and Strange Music announced a partnership under which Jay Rock signed to the label, releasing his long-awaited debut album Follow Me Home in 2011. Projects from ScHoolboy Q (Setbacks, Habits & Contradictions), Ab-Soul (Longterm Mentality), Kendrick Lamar (Section.80) also surfaced that year, making TDE the most coveted roster in the game at that point.\n\nIn March 2012, it was reported that Tiffith and TDE had entered a joint venture deal with Interscope Records and Aftermath Entertainment to release studio albums from Kendrick Lamar. As part of the agreement, ScHoolboy Q’s was signed to Interscope Records through TDE. In another blockbuster move, Tiffith and TDE announced the signing of rapper Isaiah Rashad and singer SZA to the label during that summer, another highlight in a year that culminated with the release of Lamar’s debut album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. Released in October 2012, the album was among the most anticipated of the decading, debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and earning triple platinum status. It also landed Lamar five Grammy Award nominations, for Album of The Year, Best Rap Album, Best New Artist, Best Rap/Sung Performance for “Now or Never” with Mary J. Blige, and Best Rap Performance for “Swimming Pools (Drank).”\n\nKendrick, who departed from the label in 2022, is by no means TDE’s only star, as ScHoolboy Q and SZA have both released Platinum certified, chart-topping albums during their own careers. That success has also extended itself to additional acts on Tiffith’s roster, with Lance Skiiiwalker, SiR, Reason, Zacari, Ray Vaughn, and Doechii all receiving acclaim and cultivating their own respective fan bases. Trusted to oversee blockbuster projects such as the soundtrack to Marvel Studios’ 2018 film Black Panther, Tiffith and TDE are among the more respected and accomplished record labels in Hip-Hop, with more than a decade of success under its belt. Over 10 million records sold, numerous awards and nominations counting, Tiffith is still building onto his resume, yet, has already solidified himself as a venerable founder with a knack for discovery and development.\n\nMichael \"CEO\" Watts\n\nBeing the “CEO” that he is may not have been his desire, but for Michael Watts, it turned out to be a destiny fulfilled. A native of Houston, Texas, Watts original aspiration was to be a DJ, a pastime he picked up during grade school. Selling mixtapes during his teenage years, Watts began spinning at parties before landing a gig at Houston radio station 97.9 The Box as a weekend DJ. Meeting fellow Houston native Ronald “DJ OG Ron C” Coleman at the station in 1994, the duo founded Swishahouse, a crew of DJs and rappers that would take the chopped-and-screwed sound pioneered by DJ Screw, national.\n\nEnlisting rappers Slim Thug, Chamillionaire, Paul Wall, and others, Swishahouse became a dominant force within the region, first with their Swisha ’98 mixtape, as well as their ’99 compilations Choppin Em Up Part 2 and The Day Hell Broke Loose. While original Swishahouse members OG Ron C, Slim Thug, Chamillionaire, and Paul Wall departed from the label during the early ’00s to pursue other endeavors, new signees like Mike Jones would continue to keep the clique hot in the streets.\n\nIn 2004, Paul Wall returned to the fold, appearing alongside Mike Jones and Slim Thug on “Still Tippin’,” a song previously released on the Swishahouse project The Day Hell Broke Loose 2. The buzz surrounding the sleeper hit piqued the interest of Warner Bros. Records, which announced a joint venture between Swishahouse Records and Asylum Records in January 2005. In April of that year, Mike Jones released his major label debut Who Is Mike Jones?, which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and was certified Platinum.\n\nA few months later, Paul Wall made his own major label debut with The People’s Champ, which topped the Billboard 200 and also surpassed one million units sold. The rapper, who gained acclaim for his verse on Kanye West’s Late Registration single “Drive Slow,” also earned his first No. 1 hit with his appearance on Nelly’s 2005 single “Grillz,” which received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap Performance as a Duo or Group. In 2007, Paul released his second major label drop Get Money, Stay True, which peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Responsible for one of the most pivotal movements in southern rap history, Michael “CEO” Watts and Swishahouse’s legacy is one that continues to reverberate within the culture.\n\nTyrone \"Fly Ty\" Williams\n\nThe formative years of Hip-Hop cannot be documented without mentioning the work of Tyrone “Fly Ty” Williams, who helped build one of the most storied record labels and crews in the culture’s history. A native New Yorker, Williams got his start in radio, working at WBLS as a sports reporter and producer of Rap Attack, the first all-rap radio show in history. The show, which was helmed by DJ Marlon “Marley Marl” Williams and on-air personality John “Mr. Magic” Rivas, is regarded as a groundbreaking program that served as litmus test for listeners in New York and beyond. After taking on teenage rapper Roxanne Shante as a management client and helping her secure a deal with Pop Art Records, Williams, along with Marley and Mr. Magic, worked records by MC Shan (“The Marley Scratch”) and The Super Kids (“The Tragedy”) through NIA Records.\n\nLaunching their first label, Bridge Records, Williams and company released MC Shan’s 1986 single “The Bridge”/”Beat Biter” through Pop Art the following year, before Fly Ty partnered with Len Fichtelberg to create Cold Chillin’ Records. Initially a subsidiary of Fichtelberg’s Prism Records, which had released Biz Markie singles “Make The Music With Your Mouth Biz,” “Nobody Beats The Biz” and “Pickin’ Boogers,” Cold Chillin’ ultimately absorbed the label that same year. Housing one of the premier artist lineups in Hip-Hop, Cold Chillin’ produced classic, commercially successful singles and albums from MC Shan (Down by Law), Biz Markie (Goin’ Off), Big Daddy Kane (Long Live the Kane), Marley Marl (In Control Volume 1), and Kool G Rap & DJ Polo (Road to the Riches) within its first three years of operation.\n\nIn 1988, Williams and Cold Chillin’ signed a five-year distribution deal with Warner Bros. Records, with Williams turning down thirty percentages points and securing a joint-venture with Warner. The following two years marked the peak of Cold Chillin’s success, with the label’s legendary Juice Crew widely hailed as rap’s most talent-laden collectives of the decade. Additional signees like Masta Ace, Craig G, Grand Daddy I.U., Kid Capri, The Genius and others helped usher Cold Chillin’ into the ’90s, with Fly Ty later brokering a distribution deal with Epic Street and launching the Cold Chillin’ sub-label Livin’ Large. Cold Chillin’ would end its run in 1998, with Williams turning his attention to service-driven endeavors such as The Brooklyn United Music and Arts Program, which he co-founded with Tyrone Brown in 2013."
