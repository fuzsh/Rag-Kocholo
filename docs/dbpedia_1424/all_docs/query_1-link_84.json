        "text": "Â Jennifer Lopez “J-Lo”\n\nJennifer Lopez “J-Lo” Sony\n\nMusic\n\nPop music has reached an all new “J-Lo.” Jennifer\n\nLopez’s newest album, a hodgepodge of club music,\n\nLatin-tinged pop and ballads, offers little in quality music beyond\n\na few catchy songs. Lopez has never been known for having a\n\npowerful or unique voice, and “J-Lo” does nothing to\n\ndispute that fact. Throughout the album, her vocals sound thin, as\n\nif all their emotion and warmth have been filtered out.\n\nLopez’s vocals aren’t powerful enough to carry the\n\nsongs, but the rest of the music pulls her through. As a whole, the\n\nsongs have good packaging, like most current pop tunes. They are\n\nwell-polished and full of synthesized drumbeats, keyboards, backup\n\nvocals and special effects. They offer little more than a beat to\n\nnod your head to. “Love Don’t Cost A Thing,” one\n\nof the better cuts, has decent beats, but ridiculous lyrics,\n\nsetting the album’s mediocre tone. The dance songs,\n\nespecially the Latin ones, are better than the ballads. Slow tunes\n\nlike “Come Over” and “Secretly” trudge on\n\nfrom beginning to weary end. Ballads give artists a great\n\nopportunity to show their range, but Lopez’s dull delivery\n\nadds nothing to the trite songs. “CariÃ±o” has a\n\ngood vibe, and Lopez phrases the words almost like speech, but the\n\nlyrics are poorly written and Lopez’s performance is far from\n\ndynamic. She sounds totally uninspired as she sings, “I got\n\nso much love to give you/that I would probably want you all the\n\ntime.” “Si Ya Se AcabÃ³,” has a grooving\n\nLatin pop style and is worth a listen. The driving beat, guitar and\n\nhorn riffs and multi-vocal chorus make this one of the more\n\ninteresting songs on the album. Usually when vocalists reach up to\n\ntheir higher registers, the color of their voice changes, and\n\nhigher notes convey deeper emotional substance. Not here. On\n\n“That’s the Way,” Lopez’s vocals on the\n\nhigh end are so emotionless, they’re almost mind-numbing.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s barely a memorable phrase or line on\n\nthe entire album. Essentially all the songs can be divided by\n\nlyrical content into two categories: “Baby, I’m sorry,\n\ncome back to me” and “Baby, respect me, love me.”\n\nListeners can paraphrase all of Lopez’s lyrics simply by\n\ninserting one of these two phrases in each song. One of the few\n\nmemorable lines is during “That’s Not Me,” where\n\nLopez sings, “I looked in the mirror every day/I saw myself\n\nfading away/you tryin’ to mold me into her.” After\n\nplaying the songs a few times, they get a little better, but not\n\nmuch. Hopefully Lopez won’t quit her acting career.\n\nChris Young Rating: 4\n\nShuggie Otis \"Inspiration Information\" Luaka\n\nBop\n\nIf there’s one thing the major record companies hate more\n\nthan originality, it’s an artist who thinks and acts\n\nindependently. Corporate suits who are more concerned with profit\n\nmargins than the expansion of America’s greatest art form, is\n\nthe reason college students can name every song released by generic\n\nsheep-pop bands *NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys, while they\n\nwouldn’t recognize geniuses like Prince or Terrance Trent\n\nD’arby if they handed out their own albums on Bruin Walk.\n\nMajor labels prefer artists that they can pigeonhole and control,\n\nand the result is that the truly great musicians fade into\n\nobscurity while mediocrity goes platinum ten times over. One of the\n\ngreat casualties of the ’70s California soul scene was Los\n\nAngeles musician Shuggie Otis. A musical prodigy, Otis released a\n\nsoul masterpiece in 1974, “Inspiration Information”\n\nthat was so brilliant and ahead of its time that Otis’ label,\n\nEpic Records, had no choice but to bury the record and drop him\n\nfrom the label. The album, which Otis wrote, arranged, produced\n\n(although his father Johnny Otis received the producer credit) and\n\nperformed, set the standard for future DIY artists and\n\ngenre-hopping performers. “Inspiration Information,”\n\nwhich took a then-unheard of three years to record, has recently\n\nbeen reissued by Luaka Bop Records. For musicologists this disc is\n\nan absolute must-buy. It’s amazing how many modern genres are\n\nexplored on this disc. The stripped-down folky blues of\n\n“Sweet Thang” would fit in nicely on any Ben Harper\n\ndisc, while futuristic, drum machine-backed tracks like\n\n“XL-30″ and “Pling” predate the French\n\nambient techno scene by a solid 25 years. Aside from the\n\ngroundbreaking aspects of this disc, “Inspiration\n\nInformation” is a groovy listen from beginning to end. A true\n\n’70s soul act, the album features several tracks which would\n\nfit into the style of the time with the sweeping synthesized\n\nstrings and guitar style that were typical of the Isaac Hayes,\n\nCurtis Mayfield recordings of the period. If Otis’ original\n\nrendition of “Strawberry Letter 23,” which later became\n\na huge hit for the Brothers Johnson, was released as a single, it\n\nwould likely be the best R&B record of the year. The same could\n\nbe said about the title track. Otis has a strong, soulful voice\n\nthat occupies a middle ground between Little Stevie Wonder and the\n\nlate Jackie Wilson, and is greatly benefited by his lo-fi\n\nproduction approach. All the musicianship is first rate. Nothing on\n\nthis disc sounds like it was performed with the economic bottom\n\nline in consideration. As wonderful as this disc is, most listeners\n\nwill never have the opportunity to hear this gem of a recording.\n\nCorporate radio and MTV are even more conservative now than they\n\nwere in 1974. The sad truth of the matter is that this disc has\n\nnext to no chance of going platinum. Otis didn’t record this\n\ndisc to sell records though. He made this classic for people who\n\nlike to listen to great music. Now, fans of soul-based music, this\n\nis a golden opportunity to own one of the most innovative discs of\n\nthe entire genre.\n\nScott Schultz Rating: 9\n\nJoi “We Are Three” Real World\n\nJoi’s “We Are Three,” its second release for\n\nPeter Gabriel’s Real World label, is a brilliant stab at\n\nethnic dance music, combining the highest of hi-tech production\n\nstandards with gritty samples recorded in the streets of Bengal,\n\nIndia. Moving from breakbeat electronica to disco house to avant\n\ngarde alternative, Joi covers a lot of ground without\n\noversaturating its sound with nationality, as is common among\n\nethnotechno hybrids. Joi is comprised of brothers Haroon and Farook\n\nShamsher, who were born in India and raised next to London’s\n\ndance clubs. Having built up a reputation as the self-described\n\n“original Asian backbeat fusionists” earlier in the\n\ndecade, the brothers released their first album “One and One\n\nis Three” to critical acclaim in 1999. Only a few months\n\nafter their first album’s release and their second’s\n\ngenesis, Haroon suffered a fatal heart attack, effectively ending\n\nthe band’s existence. “We Are Three” still shines\n\nwith an uncommon exuberance for breakbeat music, with tracks like\n\n“The Holy Side” piling layers of distorted drum beats\n\natop soul-grasping synth lines, and others like\n\n“Triatma” working in acoustic guitars and sitars over\n\npuncturing bass beats and string washes. On some of the more catchy\n\npieces, such as “Don’t Cha Know That” or\n\n“Deep Asian Vibes,” Joi picks up where The Crystal\n\nMethod and The Chemical Brothers left off, but trades pompousness\n\nfor ecstasy. While a few tracks on “We Are Three,” such\n\nas the slow-moving “Flying With You” and the rather\n\nindigestible “Prem,” might keep the album from being a\n\ntrue masterpiece, ultimate fusionary tracks like “We Need\n\nYour Vote” make the album definitely worth checking out and\n\nearning heavy rotation in the CD carousel."
