        "text": "It's almost a cliche at this point to say that teen fiction isn't just for teens anymore. Just last year, the Association of American Publishers ranked Children's/Young Adult books as the single fastest-growing publishing category.\n\nWhich is why we were only a little surprised to see the tremendous response that came in for this summer's Best-Ever Teen Fiction poll. A whopping 75,220 of you voted for your favorite young adult novels, blasting past the total for last year's science fiction and fantasy poll at, dare we say it, warp speed.\n\nAnd now, the final results are in. While it's no surprise to see Harry Potter and the Hunger Games trilogy on top, this year's list also highlights some writers we weren't as familiar with. For example, John Green, author of the 2012 hit The Fault in Our Stars, appears five times in the top 100.\n\nSelecting a manageable voting roster from among the more than 1,200 nominations that came in from readers wasn't easy, and we were happy to be able to rely on such an experienced panel of judges. But deciding what does and doesn't count as a young-adult novel isn't an exact science. If you're surprised not to see some of your favorite books among the winners, you might want to look at this blog post, which describes the thinking behind the tough calls.\n\nSummer, like youth, is fleeting. But the books we read when we're young can stay with us for a lifetime. Here's hoping that when the school bell rings in a few short weeks, it will find you engrossed in just such a memorable read, selected by the NPR audience. Enjoy. (For your convenience, here's a printable version of the top-100 list, and here's a list of the 235 finalists.)\n\n1. Harry Potter series\n\nby J.K.

The Catcher in the Rye\n\nby J.D. Salinger\n\nWith the author's death, the classic novel about young Holden Caulfield's disillusionment with the adult world and its \"phoniness\" will only rise in popularity — and controversy, since it is a favorite target of censors, who often cite profanity and sexual references in their efforts to ban the book.\n\n7. The Lord of the Rings\n\nby J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nTolkien's seminal three-volume epic chronicles the War of the Ring, in which Frodo the hobbit and his companions set out to destroy the evil Ring of Power and restore peace to Middle-earth.

Fahrenheit 451\n\nby Ray Bradbury\n\nIn a far future world, television dominates, and books are outlawed.

The Princess Bride\n\nby William Goldman\n\nThis tale of a handsome farm boy who, aided by a drunken swordsman and a gentle giant, rescues a beautiful princess named Buttercup comes with a slyly humorous, metafictional edge: Goldman claims to have merely abridged an earlier text by one \"S. Morgenstern\" (actually a pseudonym) and peppers his text with clever commentary.\n\n18. Lord of the Flies\n\nby William Golding\n\nThe classic study of human nature depicts the degeneration of a group of schoolboys marooned on a desert island.
