        "text": "It hit the top spot in the UK charts!\n\nDespite being one of the busiest bees in showbiz right now, Ariana Grande wrote, recorded, mixed and promoted a seventh album - 'Eternal Sunshine', released on 8th March 2024.\n\nThe 31-year-old singer, who is busy working on the Wicked films, somehow found time to make the brand new album which serves as the follow-up to 2020's 'positions' - AND put out a \"slightly deluxe\" version too. Here's everything we know about the record...\n\nWill Ariana Grande tour her album 'Eternal Sunshine'?\n\nShe's certainly hoping to perform the songs in person - whether that becomes a full on tour, we don't know yet. Speaking on a podcast in July 2024, Ari said she'd love to \"trickle\" some shows in between her Wicked filming schedule, but they'd most likely be more intimate performances.\n\n\"It‚Äôs definitely, for a multitude of reasons, not going to be a tour in the way I used to tour,\" she clarified. \"It‚Äôd be a mini little sampling of shows. I do think it‚Äôd be really nice to do that. It‚Äôs something that me and my team are working on.\"\n\n'Eternal Sunshine (slightly deluxe)'\n\nAfter the release of her seventh album on 8th March 2024, Ari put out a 'slightly deluxe' version two days later, which features four additional tracks: 'supernatural' (featuring Troye Sivan), 'imperfect for you (acoustic)', 'true story (acapella)', and the previously released version of 'yes, and?' featuring Mariah Carey.\n\nWhat is the album artwork?\n\nShe was busy sharing posts on Instagram in the lead up to the release, culminating in her post on the day of the album's release, announcing that the album was out along with the album artwork and the caption: 'Àö‚ùÄ¬∑Íï§. eternal sunshine out now ÔΩ°Àö‚ùÄ¬∑Íï§.'\n\nFans were overjoyed by the release and took to the comments to share their happiness. One wrote: 'i‚Äôm not okay I‚ÄôM NOT OKAY', as another added: 'so proud of you it physically hurts. the most beautiful, your best in every way. thank you thank you over and over for giving us something this special.' (sic)\n\nWhere did it come in the charts?\n\n'Eternal Sunshine' hit the top spot in the charts in over 10 countries - including the UK and the US. In May 2024, it was certified Gold by the BPI, translating to over 100,000 album sales in the UK alone.\n\nAriana opens up about making 'Eternal Sunshine'\n\nThe release comes after the singer spoke to Zach Sang at the end of February, revealing that she hadn't initially planned to record an album.\n\nShe said: \"I did not plan to. I didn‚Äôt have the goal to make an album. I actually was really opposed to coming out with music until after Wicked. I wasn‚Äôt sure how it would feel. But as soon as the strike began, I came to New York just for fun to see how it would feel. Max Martin came to spend a week with me at Jungle City Studios and it all just kind of started pouring out.\n\n\"After our first week together, I kept coming to the studio everyday by myself and it kept organically happening that way so I just decided to react and listen to that. And I thought, ‚ÄòMaybe it should come out‚Äô if it‚Äôs coming out of me this way. Maybe it should be shared this way?‚Äô\"\n\nAriana explained how her role in Wicked impacted her seventh album\n\nHaving been busy filming the upcoming Wicked movie, Ariana also revealed that playing the role of Glinda had a powerful impact on her own relationship with music, allowing her to 'fall in love' with it again.\n\nShe explained: ‚ÄúMy relationship to music changed and healed a lot through taking space from it. I think I learned so much from Glinda, and through Glinda I healed a lot of parts of myself, alongside and through her.\n\n\"It actually helped me heal a lot of my own personal, weird stuff that I had with my relationship to music and being an artist, and to that persona‚Ä¶ and I was able to come home and address it, sit with it and change the things that weren‚Äôt working, and fall in love with it again. It all happened absolutely how it was meant to be.‚Äù\n\n'Eternal Sunshine' is her \"favourite\" album\n\nRevealing that she thinks 'Eternal Sunshine' is her \"favourite\" album, Ariana added: ‚ÄúI definitely did several passes at all of the songs just to kind of be protective, because I wrote some of them when I was very emotional. And then there are bops that are more fun. Actually, even some of the bops I cried writing.\n\n\"The thing that was beautiful about it was, when I was writing, it was with no intention for the world to hear it. It was, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs just go and see what comes out‚Äô, and then when I was done, I remembered that people will hear it and how sometimes people can sensationalise things and assign meaning to certain things.\"\n\nWhat is the album about?\n\nShe continued: \"I wanted to make sure that it was what I intended, which, even at my most heartbroken or pained moments of the past few years, there was so much kindness, there was so much love, there was so much honesty, transparency and respect.\n\n\"So even at the hardest moments of the loss and the grief that you hear on some of the album, there was so much love and transparency. That was something that I really wanted to make sure was captured.\n\n‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre making it sound like hell, it‚Äôs not! (The album) is very boppy. It‚Äôs so fun sounding and feeling, but the emotional context is like, ‚Äòwoah‚Äô. I think it‚Äôs my favourite album as well...I‚Äôm sure it is actually.\"\n\nWhat is the tracklist?\n\n1) 'intro (end of the world)'\n\n2) 'bye'\n\n3) 'don‚Äôt wanna break up again'\n\n4) 'saturn returns interlude'\n\n5) 'eternal sunshine'\n\n6) 'supernatural'\n\n7) 'true story'\n\n8) 'the boy is mine'\n\n9) 'yes, and?'\n\n10) 'we can‚Äôt be friends (wait for your love)'\n\n11) 'i wish i hated you'\n\n12) 'imperfect for you'\n\n13) 'ordinary things (feat. nonna)'\n\nAfter the release of the incredible 'yes, and?' which was released in January 2024 and marked Ari's first solo music in three years, she then delighted fans by dropping a remix of the track - featuring none other than global superstar Mariah Carey!\n\nIt was released on 16th February 2024, with Ari sharing a heartfelt post to Instagram to celebrate working with the global icon that is Mariah Carey - citing her as the 'queen of my heart and lifelong inspiration'.\n\nLISTEN: Ariana Grande - yes, and? with Mariah Carey:\n\nWhen was 'AG7' released?\n\nAriana's seventh album is called 'Eternal Sunshine' and was released on 8th March 2024.\n\nWhat hints did she drop about her seventh album?\n\nApril 2021\n\nDespite throwing herself into Wicked and The Voice, she was featured on The Weeknd's remix of 'Save Your Tears', not one of her own releases.\n\nNovember 2021\n\nAfter months of hard work and auditions - plus plenty of rumours - Ari was officially announced to be joining the cast of Wicked as Glinda the Good Witch, directed by Jon M. Chu and co-starring Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba.\n\nAri posted the news to Instagram with the caption: ‚Äòthank goodness üíò‚Äô, including a photo of a beautiful bouquet of flowers from Cynthia, with a note that read: 'Pink goes good with green. Congratulations Miss A, the part was made for you, I look forward to sharing this musical journey with you.'\n\nAri reciprocated the favour, sending her own bouquet to Cynthia with a note that read: 'Dear Cynthia, honoured doesn't even begin to cover it. I cannot wait to hug you. See you in Oz. All my love, Ari.'\n\nApril 2022\n\nAlthough the film was originally announced as one movie, director Jon M. Chu announced that it would be split into two in April 2022. Stating that they were struggling to fit everything in to just one film, Jon confirmed that it would now be a two-parter.\n\nAri posted a statement from Jon on Instagram with the caption: 'some thrillifying news :).' The statement read: 'Here's what happened: as we prepared this production over the last year, it became increasingly clear that it would be impossible to wrestle the story of WICKED into a single film without doing some real damage to it.\n\n'As we tried to cut songs or trim characters, those decisions began to feel like fatal compromises to the source material that has entertained us all for so many years. So we decided to give ourselves a bigger canvas and make not just one WICKED movie but TWO!!!!\n\n'With more space, we can tell the story of WICKED as it was meant to be told while bringing even more depth and surprise to the journeys of these beloved characters. Cynthia, Ariana, and I- and all of the cast and crew- pledge to create nothing less than an experience that honors its foundation for all the fans who've waited for this movie, and to offer a thrilling, fantastical world full of dynamic characters that invites in those who are unfamiliar.'\n\nWhile this was wonderful news for fans of the film, it did mean that another album from Ari was looking likely to be even further away.\n\nMay 2022\n\nAri posted a Q & A on her R.E.M Beauty channel, in which she replied to a fan question about a seventh album. She said: \"This is a question I‚Äôm nervous to answer, but I feel like I want to have a little bit of transparency and honesty with my fans.\n\n\"The truth is, I have not begun an album. I hear through the grapevine that you have a lot of theories and expectations in that department.\"\n\nShe added that after releasing 'positions', she was busy working as a coach on The Voice as well and confirmed that Wicked had taken up her world: \"I started hearing murmurs about a Wicked audition coming soon, so I went into full preparation mode while I was also shooting The Voice.\n\n\"I was shooting and then also doing lessons every day ‚Äôcause I just wanted to be prepared. I know that I know the material like the back of my hand, but I have so much to learn and I want to be prime condition, so I went pretty hard getting ready.\"\n\nAdding that taking part in the film was a childhood dream come true, she said: \"That is going to have every piece of me, every minute, every ounce of my heart, my time, my soul, my everything that I can give it. My hands are quite full with a lot of other ‚Äòthrillifying‚Äô work at the moment. I am spending all of my time with Glinda, I just was not ready.\"\n\nAugust 2023\n\nAri re-released her debut album 'Yours Truly' to celebrate its 10th anniversary, featuring all the original tracks plus six live performances she'd re-recorded in London recently. These were: 'Honeymoon Avenue', 'Daydreamin‚Äô', 'Baby I', 'Tattooed Heart', 'Right There' and 'The Way'. But still no word on another album of fresh songs at the time...\n\nOctober 2023\n\nAriana didn't address her seventh album directly in October 2023, however she did share a photo dump of pics including some with Swedish producer Max Martin. Max has produced a number of huge hits for Ariana, along with other artists, and it looked like they could have been working together again.\n\nLater that month, Ari posted a series of photos - mostly of herself and her mum, Joan Grande, frolicking with some super cute goats! She captioned the post: 'ag7: goat mother', which piqued the interests of fans all over the world.\n\nScrolling through the photos, Ari also shared yet another photo of Max Martin featuring Norbert Leo Butz seemingly serenading him with a guitar. Norbert originated the role of Fiyero in Wicked, winning a Tony award for his performance.\n\nFans flocked to the comments to share their excitement, with one writing: 'üé∂ You believe Goat is a womaaaan and I üé∂', as another added: 'This is my favorite version of you ‚ù§Ô∏è I wanna play with goats now !!!' and one other commented: 'track 5: fml ft Joan Grande.'\n\nShe also shared a snap of herself alongside Wicked co-star Cynthia Erivo to show that she's still working on the picture.\n\nDecember 2023\n\nIn December, Ariana shared a series of silent videos and photos from a recording studio, where it looks like she's working on new music. This Instagram post has sparked a lot of excitement amongst fans and other artists, with Billie Eilish commenting: 'UN MUTE PLS', (sic) and Selena Gomez saying: 'FINALLY'.\n\nTy Dolla $ign also wrote: 'She backkkk'. (sic)\n\nHowever, it was Ariana's Wicked co-star's comment which attracted a lot of attention, as Cynthia Evrio wrote: 'Love you sweetheart, no one is ready, I‚Äôm so freaking proud of you!! This project is so freaking special!!!‚ù§Ô∏è '.\n\nExcitement then built even further when Ari shared even more clips of her singing into the mic in the recording studio, however the videos were still muted so that no music was teased.\n\nDesperate to hear new material from the singer at that time, fans flooded the comments with messages of excitement. Make-up influencer Matt Bernstein even exclaimed: 'girl if you don‚Äôt unmute' (siC), with Hailey Bieber writing: 'Thank GOD!!!'
