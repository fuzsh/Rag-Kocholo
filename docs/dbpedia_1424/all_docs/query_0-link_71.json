However, this quest relies on utilizing the HP Regen skills to pass this challenge. Highly recommended to bring in servants that grant HP Regen skills to others or themselves, since gimmick relies on this skill to bypass the enemies defensive buff. One other tip is to have the skills Debuff Immunity and/or the Remove Debuff since the Soul Gluttony immediatly inflicts the nasty debuff blockers and removers from your party.\n\n(*The Soul Gluttony in Wave 3 will appear right after eliminating the Soul Eater and will end the players turn. Treat this little surprise as you would for Enemies with HP Break and expect the quest to go past 3 turns.)\n\nDevour: All the Soul Eaters have this skill in their sets. It includes the following buffs:\n\nApplies Attack Debuff vs. Units with non-healing buffs; Recovers 500 HP with each attack.\n\nApplies Buff on Damage vs. Units with non-healing buffs; Recovers 500 HP from attacks.\n\nDamage Resistance (70%) vs. Units with non-healing buffs (1 Time).\n\nBinge Eating This is more improved version of the Devour skill that the Soul Gluttony has and will include these buffs as follow:\n\nApplies Attack Debuff vs. Units with non-healing buffs; Recovers 2000 HP with each attack.\n\nApplies Buff on Damage vs. Units with non-healing buffs; Recovers 2000 HP from attacks.\n\nDamage Resistance (90%) vs. Units with non-healing buffs (5 Times).\n\nWhen Soul Gluttony appears on the field, it will first activate the skills and inflict the following debuffs: has and will include these buffs as follow:\n\nKnifes of Segregation Remove 3 effects vs. Buff Positive Effect starting from the latest one on all enemies.\n\nForks of Oppression Apply Buff Blocks vs. Buff Positive Effect on all enemies (3 Times).\n\nStrategy: As mentioned above, only units buffed with HP Regen are the only ones that can bypass the enemies Damage Resistance buffs. For that much, deploy a few servants that can grant such skills to other servants that are planned to attacking the enemies. Here is a list of a few Servants that are highly recommended:\n\nServant Reason\n\nHabetrot\n\nCan give Female party members a long-lasting HP Regeneration effect.\n\nMerlin, Hans Christian Andersen, Asclepius\n\nHighly Recommended Supports\n\nSupportive Casters who have NPs with HP Regeneration.\n\nAsclepius can deal with the third wave's Buff Block with his third skill's debuff removal.\n\nArjuna (Alter)\n\n3rd skill grants HP Regen to himself.\n\nHigh firepower DPS.\n\nThe 3rd skill on its own doesn't give him a lot of uptime on its HP Regeneration, so caution is advised.\n\nNitocris (Alter), Spartacus\n\nDPS options that have HP Regeneration on their skills.\n\nDaikokuten\n\nHighly Recommended DPS\n\nFirst skill grants HP Regen to the entire party.\n\nSeveral useful supportive effects.\n\nGood DPS option against the Earth-attribute Soul Eaters.\n\nXuanzang Sanzang, Charles Babbage\n\nHigh power Caster DPSs.\n\nXu Fu\n\nTeamwide debuff removal on first skill is great for removing the Buff Block effect on wave 3.\n\nNP gives herself a long-lasting HP Regeneration effect.\n\nCompletion\n\nRewardCompletion\n\nRewardClear all arrows for the first time to receive this reward\n\nClear Anastasia\n\n忌避すべき実験 Experiment that is Ought to Be Shunned Against AP Cost Bond Points QP EXP Battlefield type 5 1,830\n\n(366 per AP) 188,000\n\n(37,600 per AP) 76,380\n\n(15,276 per AP) City\n\nEnemies Fatal Battle 1/1 Subject α\n\nLvl 70 19,079 HP\n\n(1st Form) Lvl 77 39,079 HP\n\nSubject α\n\nLvl 71 19,364 HP\n\n(1st Form) Lvl 78 39,364 HP\n\n(2nd Form) Lvl 82 74,364 HP\n\nSubject β\n\nLvl 72 20,217 HP\n\n(1st Form) Lvl 79 40,217 HP\n\n(2nd Form) Lvl 84 75,217 HP\n\n(3rd Form) Lvl 90 135,217 HP Subject α\n\nLvl 70 19,079 HP\n\n(1st Form) Lvl 77 39,079 HP\n\nSubject α\n\nLvl 71 19,364 HP\n\n(1st Form) Lvl 78 39,364 HP\n\n(2nd Form) Lvl 82 74,364 HP\n\nSubject β\n\nLvl 72 20,217 HP\n\n(1st Form) Lvl 79 40,217 HP\n\n(2nd Form) Lvl 84 75,217 HP\n\n(3rd Form) Lvl 90 135,217 HP Notable Drops x5 x5\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nA few gimmicks to watch out for is the fact that the enemies all have different forms. How it works is that all of them are given unremovable Guts status Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable.. After at least killing one of them and they activate the Buff, they will activate another skill that will transition them to the forms and are given more additional buffs according to the forms. Looking at the Quest Body, at least each 2 enemies are limited to a certain number of transformations, so its all about trying to wittle them down, In addition, they gain a demerit called Price of Power, which hits them with Instant Death Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. on themselves after 3 turns. However, this isn't really much of a good outcome, for if the enemy still has a form to evolve to, then they will in turn wait for Death until the next transformation.\n\nImportant Note: When it becomes the Enemies turn, whatever form they are in currently (1st,2nd,3rd), the first time they are acting in their forms is when they will start applying alternate skills to either buff their side or debuff the other team. I say alternate because the AI randomizes between the form's skill and chooses only one to act on. But it only happens when it becomes the enemy's turn, meaning if the player manages to kill them off before they can act, then their skills won't activate. This means right on the player's 1st turn, make sure to have all the Vanguard row ready to fire off their AoE NP to eliminate the enemy's chances of buffing/debuffing anymore than their stages allow them.\n\nHere is the skill list of each form to watch out for:\n\n1st Form: Upon transformation\n\nPrice of Power lvl.1- Instant Death to self Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. after 3 turns (Demerit).\n\nApplies Attack up Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. (20%) on self (3t) (Stackable).\n\nApplies Defense up Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. (20%) on self (3t) (Stackable).\n\nApplies NP gain Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. (self) on self for one charge every turn (Stackable).\n\nEnemy acts on turn:\n\n(Option 1) Pyromancy Magecraft- Apply Burn (-500 HP) on all enemies (3t).\n\n(Option 2) Barrier Magecraft- Apply Damage Cut (-5000) on party (1 Time, 3t).\n\nBullet Protection- Applies Taunt status to one party member that has not yet activated their Guts status Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. (1t).\n\n2nd Form: Upon transformation\n\nPrice of Power lvl.2- Instant Death to self Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. after 3 turns (Demerit).\n\nApplies Max HP up Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. (35,000 HP) on self (Stackable).\n\nApplies HP Regen Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. (5000 HP) on self (Stackable)\n\nApplies Attack up Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. (30%) on self (3t) (Stackable).\n\nApplies Defense up Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. (30%) on self (3t) (Stackable).\n\nApplies NP gain Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. on self for one charge every turn (Stackable).\n\nEnemy acts on turn:\n\n(Option 1) Weakening Magecraft- Apply Damage Up (-300), NP Aquisition Rate Down (30%), and Star Drop Rate Down (30%) on all enemies (3t).\n\n(Option 2) Heavy Drinker- Drains NP (20%) from enemy party, Charges one NP gauge to ally team.\n\nBullet Protection- Applies Taunt status to one party member that has not yet activated their Guts status Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. (1t).\n\n3rd Form: Upon transformation\n\nRampage- Removes Instant Death Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. on self.\n\nApplies Healing power up Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. (500%) on self.\n\nApplies Attack up Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. (50%) on self (5t) (Stackable).\n\nApplies Defense up Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. (50%) on self (5t) (Stackable).\n\nIncreases NP Charge by 5 on self.\n\nApplies NP Damage up Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. (30%) on self.\n\nApplies Attack Down Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. on self, decreases by 10%/turn (Demerit).\n\nApplies Defense Down Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. on self, decreases by 10%/turn (Demerit).\n\nEnemy acts on turn:\n\n(Option 1) Digestive Fluids- 3 times with 50% Chance to Remove 1 Buff Positive Effect starting from the latest one on all enemies.\n\n(Option 2) Body Transformation- Applies Critical Rate Up (100%) on self (1 Time, 3t). Applies Attack Debuff that inflicts Paralysis on enemy for 1 turn (1 Time, 3t).\n\nStrategy: Defeating the enemies here will take a while unless there is a way to constantly fire off AoE NP every chance there is. Fortunatly, this battle isn't one where you are hampered by enemies with HP bar breaks; this is one where Guts skills are activated, So it is better to have all Vanguards with AoE NP damage and fully charged on the 1st turn. Be mindful of which enemies are leftover as the ones with the 2nd and 3rd forms left alive on the field will inflict serious harm on the player with their debuffs, especially the 3rd form that has a chance of activating its Digestive Fluid ability and has a very good chance to one-shot one of the Servants with just one attack.\n\nCompletion\n\nRewardCompletion\n\nRewardClear all arrows for the first time to receive this reward\n\nClear Olympus\n\nヘラの栄光 Glory of Hera AP Cost Bond Points QP EXP Battlefield type 5 1,830\n\n(366 per AP) 188,000\n\n(37,600 per AP) 76,380\n\n(15,276 per AP) Sunlight, Shore\n\nEnemies Fatal Battle 1/1 Heracles\n\nLvl 80 200,860 HP Notable Drops x4 x4\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nFace off against Heracles with his 12 Labors skills and the buffs that come with each turn.

For now, let's go over the methods.\n\nDefeating Heracles; The Offense method:\n\nAs mentioned above, any attempt to attack Heracles and activating his Guts status Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. will give him a Special Defensive buff of the last attack type that killed him for 2 turns. If Heracles was killed by an Extra Attack, then he will be given a low Special Defense of all the types for the 2 turns.\n\n1) The Best Offense is a good Defense: The Bazett Way\n\nUtilizing Bazett can really help get traction against Heracles as her NP is a Counter-type mechanism to taking out his Guts Tooltip for 25px|link=ⓘThis effect is unremovable. at least 2-3 times when he attempts to attack her. This strategy is possible to pull this off with her NP lvl 1. The best way to use this strategy is to make sure on 1st turn, Bazett is given a full attack set with her attacking 4 times (Extra Attack), but try to prioritize using her Buster or Arts first before Quick attacks as we are relying on her NP (Quick attacks ) to deal as much damage to Heracles and you will find him stacking Quick Resistance a lot.\n\n2) Combo with Attack > NP > Attack (Not Recommended, but maybe if paired with Bazette strat)\n\nWhichever Servant you choose as your DPS main, make sure they are buffed well enough where their own single attack can take out as much as 201,000 Hp on Heracles, let alone a NP that does as much. This will help for at least the 1st 3 turns as he will be stacking the Special Defensive buffs, but this is not a good way to start since you need to keep constant pressure on Heracles, even delaying the turns will hurt if that DPS gets taken out soon.\n\nTurtle it out; The Defense method:\n\nIf the Offense way seems impossible to accomplish, then utilizing a team built with defense buffs is the way to go. But for this strategy, there is the matter of timing when and what buffs to trigger before a certain number of turns have past. For Example, If planning to utilize Artoria Caster out on the field, you do not use her NP skill right Before turn 5, since Heracles will activate his Augeias' Stable labor that Removes effects with Buff Increase Defence ( , , . , / / ) on all enemies.\n\n1) Utilize Defense compatibility changes and anti-purge Defense\n\nThere are certain ways for one to defend against Heracle's onslaught, but if you manage to pull this method off, then it shouldn't be much of a problem. One best method is to have Artoria Caster/Tamamo no Mae/Sima Yi (Reines) in the front row with CE's that increases NP rate increase or NP gain. Use all the skills available to stack defenses high. Should you have all their NP fully charged, use them immediatly and prioritize the order of using Reines → Castoria → Tamamo. This is because Reines NP can grant the party ignore defense class disadvantage for 3 turns, taking 1x damage from class disadvantage. briings them down This also helps reduces Heracles Berseker class damage rate of 1.5x -> 1.0x and also grants NP rate up and Removes any negative Debuff . Castoria is also there to keep her NP Anti-Purge Defense on the ready. The lastly, Tamamo's NP gives the team a good NP boost, making it a fair bit easier to access the other two Servant's NP and cool down all skill countdowns.\n\n2) Cheapest Defense; Utilize Guts and Taunts\n\nNot everyone realizes how valuable the low-tier Servants are when it comes to quest gimmicks or strategies. for those in the F2P mode and want to utilize what is available, there there is a way, but plan accordingly. Some Servants like Consort Yu (Lancer), Leonidas I, Georgios, and Musashibō Benkei have Taunt ability and Guts . You can also utilize Mashu for her Defense Buffs. Make use of these Servants and mayble utilize a Support like Ashiya Dōman, Kotomine, or Heracles for their multiple Guts skills, or have some extra defense buffs like Artoria Caster, Jeanne d'Arc, Himiko, Lady Avalon, or Merlin. Make sure some of the low-tier Servants are equiped with CE's with Invincibility or Guts status. This is unlikely to work, but play around with the strategy and it will surprise you how far you may get with the teams.\n\nCompletion\n\nRewardCompletion\n\nRewardClear all arrows for the first time to receive this reward"
