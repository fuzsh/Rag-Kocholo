        "text": "Just picked up a \"Light Years\" promo CD single from a bargain bin at my local record store, and it got me thinking that trying to collect all of PJ's promo singles would be a fun, but relatively cheap, endeavor, now that I have back off from the poster craze.\n\nJust curious: does anyone know which songs actually have promo CD's made for them? Are there any that are generally more or less difficult to find?\n\nOf course, if anybody has one they'd like to sell, I'll probably say yes.\n\nJust to make myself clear, I'm referring to the CD's that are sent to radio stations and record stores before a new single and/or record is to be released. These are almost always one track (if more than one track, it's because there's a radio-edit and album version of the same song). They are labeled either \"Promotional Only\" or \"Demonstration\" on the packaging and/or disc.\n\nEverything has chains...Absolutely nothing's changed. - PJ\n\n“The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.” - Albert Camus\n\nPost edited by Unknown User on January 2008"
