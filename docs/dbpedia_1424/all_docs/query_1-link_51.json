        "text": "Early Life\n\nUtada Hikaru was born in Manhattan, New York on January 19, 1983, and is the only child of Utada Teruzane and Abe Junko. Utada's parents both worked in the music industry - her father, Utada Teruzane (or Skingg U) is a music producer, and her mother was an extremely famous Enka singer in the 1970's, who went under the alias of Fuji Keiko. Utada was raised in both New York and Tokyo, and felt as if both Tokyo and New York were her hometown.\n\nUtada did not originally like the idea of having music as a career, as she saw her parents leading a hectic life and sacrificing so much for music. She was immersed in the music business, and frequently had to sleep on the couch in her parents' recording studio.\n\nWhen she was 10 years old, her parents asked her if she was able to write a song. She reluctantly tried, and wrote the song \"I'll Be Stronger\", which appeared on vinyl. At the same age, she also did small vocal parts in her parents' music project, U3. On the album \"Star\", Utada is able to be heard singing backup in two songs: \"THANK YOU\" and \"Kodomotachi no Uta ga Kikoeru\".\n\nWhile in school in New York, other students had trouble pronouncing her name 'Hikaru', and eventually shortened it to 'Hikki'. At the time she did not realize what 'Hickey' (a kiss mark) meant, but only found out later on. The nickname became widely used by both Utada and her fans (both English and Japanese). Utada moved to Tokyo in 1998, studying at Seisen International School and later at The American School in Japan from which she graduated in 2000.\n\nCubic U\n\nWhile she was still in high school, Utada was told that she was going to be 'making a record' by an EMI-USA representative. She was thirteen at the time and treated the songs as if they were homework. The songs had a very heavy R&B style to them, not unlike the later mainstream R&B/pop hybrid style. She wrote all save for one of the songs herself; the exception was \"Close To You\", which was a cover of The Carpenters song of the same name. The song even had a music video shot for it, filled with varying scenes showing Utada and views of New York. The album was finished in late 1996. It was set to be released into the American market in 1997, however due to restructuring problems in EMI USA the album was only released in Japan. The album itself was praised by artists such as Lenny Kravitz.\n\nUtada had only wanted the single \"Close To You\" to be sold in Japan, and the album, \"Precious\" to be released the same day in Japan as in the United States. Japanese producer Miyake Akira heard the album and managed to convince Utada to try to start a career in Japan and signed her under Toshiba EMI.\n\nOn October 20, 1998 at the 'Music Talks' convention in Akazaka Blitz, Utada debuted in front of an audience of press, producers and other people by singing the English version of Sakamoto Kyu's international hit, \"Ue wo Muite Arukou\" (known as \"Sukiyaki\" in the West). Following this, she introduced herself in English and followed with a Japanese translation of her introduction. Interestingly, another artist who was featured at this concert was Shiina Ringo.\n\nOn January 28, 1997, \"Precious\" was released. Despite the lack of immediate success, the album would later peak at #2 on the Oricon charts, selling 702,060 copies in 1998 when Utada's popularity skyrocketed.\n\nFirst Love Era\n\nOn December 9 of 1998, Utada debuted in Japan as 'Utada Hikaru', with the single, \"Automatic / time will tell\". She, in the words of a classmate, \"became famous overnight\". This was, in part, due to her distinct R&B/Pop style, which had never been seen in Japan before. The two versions of the single, the 8cm and the 12cm, sold an amazing total of approximately 2,063,000 copies (but because they were different products, she only reached #4 and #2 on the charts). Two months later, her follow-up single \"Movin' on without you\" also broke the 1,000,000-copies-sold mark and reached #1 on Oricon charts.\n\nA month later, Utada's much anticipated debut album \"First Love\" was released, debuting at #1, (staying atop the Oricon weekly charts for a consecutive four weeks) and eventually selling an excess of 10 million copies, making it the most sold album in Japanese music history. Soon after this, two \"Luv Live\" concerts were staged; one at Umeda Heat Beat, Osaka on April 1, 1999 and the other at Zepp Tokyo, Tokyo on April 2, 1999.\n\nA post-album single for the song \"First Love\" was released a month after the album, due to its popularity. Sales totaled over 800,000 units sold on the single, impressive for a re-cut single.\n\nFor that year's \"Music Talks\" concert, Utada famously sang a duet with fellow star Shiina Ringo; a cover of The Carpenters' well-known hit \"I Won't Last a Day Without You\". This was subsequently recorded in 2002 for Shiina's \"Utaite Myouri ~Vol. I~\" album. Utada also held a concert entitled \"Sokenbicha Natural Breeze Concert\" on August 24, 1999 at the Nippon Budokan that was later broadcast on TV.\n\nDistance Era\n\nFollowing the success of \"First Love\", Utada's next single, \"Addicted To You\" was released in late 1999. This became Utada's second #1 hit, with 1,784,000 units sold. She followed up this release with a similar chart topping hit in April of 2000 entitled \"Wait & See ~Risk~\". Both these singles were produced by the famed American Hip-Hop/R&B producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. In July-August of the same year, Utada decided to hold a massive tour called \"BOHEMIAN SUMMER Circuit Live 2000\", to be later released on DVD. It was held during her school holidays. The tour originally had 16 dates, but a further three were added due to public demand. The next single of the era was a double A-side, \"For You / Time Limit\", which was released just prior to the Bohemian tour, which continued on the #1 trend.\n\nAfter these recent releases, Utada decided to take a break from the music business to study biology at Columbia University in New York. However, she dropped out after half a semester because \"...it wasn't as difficult as [she] was hoping it would be.\"\n\nIn early 2001, Utada released the single \"Can You Keep A Secret?\", which not only won the Golden Disc Award for \"Song of The Year\" and a \"JASRAC Silver Award\", but became the #1 single of the year. Directly following this single was Utada's much anticipated sophomore album, \"Distance\". \"Distance\" sold over 5 Million copies and became the most sold album in 2001 worldwide. It won the Golden Disc Award for \"Pop Album of The Year\". Due to \"Distance\" and \"Can You Keep A Secret?\", Utada became one of the few artists in who held both the #1 single for the year and the #1 album for the year.\n\nDEEP RIVER Era\n\nMuch like how the title track of her first album \"First Love\" was released as a re-cut single after the album, Utada planned to release the song \"Distance\" in this manner. However, Utada heard of a school shooting/rampage in which schoolgirl Yamashita Rena (山下玲奈) had been killed. Rena had previously won an essay competition; writing about how she wanted to become a singer just like Utada. Utada decided to rearrange the song entirely, creating the single \"FINAL DISTANCE\". The song used the lyrics from \"Distance\", but it was sung in a sweeping orchestral ballad form. Utada said herself that \"\"FINAL DISTANCE\" was really difficult to sing\" because of the technical difficulty she had put into the song. At this point, Utada's PVs reached a whole new level of quality as it was the period in which she started working with her (later ex)husband, Kiriya Kazuaki. At that era, most of Utada's PVs were filled with amazing aesthetics, hidden symbolism and deep meanings.\n\nBy contrast to \"FINAL DISTANCE\" , Utada's next single was the upbeat and extremely popular hit, \"traveling\". This PV could be said to continue the storyline set down in \"FINAL DISTANCE\", and everything was done in a post-modern futuristic style. \"traveling\" won an amazing array of awards, including SSTV's Best Art Direction Video, Best Female Video, Best Video of The Year and Best Music Video. From the Golden Disc awards, \"traveling\" won Song of The Year and Music Video of The Year. It also won the 2003 JASRAC Silver Award.\n\nUtada's first single for 2002, \"Hikari\", was very well known in the west because it was the Japanese theme song for the PlayStation 2 game Kingdom Hearts (the English version was later released as a B-side on her \"COLORS\" single). \"Hikari\" won the Golden Disc award for Song of The Year and the JASRAC Silver Award (for Foreign Production). \"Hikari / Simple And Clean\" would be Utada's most famous songs in the western market. The final \"DEEP RIVER\" single release was \"SAKURA Drops / Letters\", which finished the \"Kiriya Trilogy\" of music. Strangely for a double A-Side single, the second track \"Letters\" did not have a PV to go with it. Utada herself said that this was due to the fact that it was being used as the CM song for DoCoMo ads at the time (in which she herself featured). \"SAKURA Drops\" won the SSTV and MTV JAPAN awards for the Best Female Video, as well as the Golden Disc Award for Song of the Year.\n\nThe following album, \"DEEP RIVER\", was the most critically acclaimed to date, selling over 4 million copies and winning the Golden Disc award for \"Rock & Pop Album of The Year\". It also became the highest selling album in 2002 (much like \"Distance\") as well as the #8 best selling album in Japanese music history.\n\nOn September 6th, 2002, Utada shocked the Japanese press by marrying her music video director Kiriya Kazuaki (real name Iwashita Kazuhiro) who was 15 years her senior. In her defense, Utada said that it does not matter at what age that someone gets married at, as they are equally inexperienced (it would always be the first time).\n\nSINGLE COLLECTION VOL.1\n\nAfter the release of DEEP RIVER, Utada's life became a lot busier as she began preparing for her US debut (See EXODUS below) and singles were few and far between. However, a major single entitled \"COLORS\" was released in 2003, and was written on her honeymoon in France. \"COLORS\" was her only music release for 2003 (however, there was a 20th birthday celebration DVD called \"UH Live Streaming 20 Dai wa Ikeike!\"), yet it still won the Golden Disc award for Song of The Year.\n\nIn March of 2004, Utada Hikaru SINGLE COLLECTION VOL.1 was released. Despite there being no new material or photos, the album sold 2.5 million copies, making it the highest selling album in 2004. This was also Utada's third consecutive album to win the Golden Disc award title of 'Rock & Pop Album of The Year'. At this time, Utada was also making a new single entitled \"Dareka no Negai ga Kanau Koro\", which was inspired from reading the plot manuscript of her husband's movie CASSHERN. The song was a dark power ballad, which won the Golden Disc \"Song of The Year\" award. Also later on in this year, Utada's second major tour commenced. It was called \"Hikaru no 5\" to symbolize the five years that Utada had been in the music industry. Unlike her massive BOHEMIAN SUMMER 2000, this time around there were only five dates set at a single venue.\n\nEXODUS Era\n\nIn early 2001, Utada had signed a temporary contract for one song (\"Blow My Whistle\" on the \"Rush Hour 2 Soundtrack\") under Island Def Jam as a trial run. However, Utada decided to take up Def Jam's full-time offer for a whole album, and announced it in 2002. For her western releases, she had planned to release under the name \"Hikaru Utada\" (as she is listed on the soundtrack) though she later decided to shorten her name to \"Utada\" for her western releases as it was easier to remember.\n\nUtada worked on EXODUS, creating new sounds that she had previously thought she was not able to do. She realized that the production of songs in English were completely different from in Japanese, and hence had to alter her style into something more mature and different from her previous works. Most of the album was recorded in New York; though bits and pieces of it were recorded in Tokyo. Utada had made the first song \"Animato\" while bedridden in hospital because of a benign ovarian tumor in 2002. The second song that Utada wrote, \"Tippy Toe\", seemed like an ordinary song to her, and the next song she wrote would become her first 'Utada' single, \"Easy Breezy\".\n\nNear the end of the album production, she was able to get the help of Timbaland, who remixed the already finished \"Wonder 'Bout\", then helped in writing \"Let Me Give You My Love\" and finally \"Exodus '04\".\n\nUtada felt that in the translation process of EXODUS (the bonus booklet in the Japanese version had song translations), so many details were lost, so that the true sense of the song would no longer be there. To stop people thinking that the bonus booklet lyrics were just the 'Japanese lyrics', Utada translated one song herself, \"Animato\". She later said that this was because the song was so 'her' that someone else would have trouble translating it.\n\nOn July 3, 2004, the first promo of \"Easy Breezy\" was released. Utada said that this single was the first because it shows her humor. The music video style was completely Americanized (it was directed by Jake Nava) and it shocked Utada's Japanese fans with the new style. Soon after on September 8, 2004, the album EXODUS was released in Japan. 550,000 copies of EXODUS were sold in four days, breaking the record for an English-language album in Japan. Total Japanese sales were over 1 million copies, and it is estimated that 30,000 copies were sold in the US when it was released later in October.\n\nThe second single from EXODUS (now in western format where the album precedes the singles) was the dance hit \"Devil Inside\", which reached #1 on Billboard Hot Dance/Club Airplay in the US. The Richard Vission Experience Mix of the song was also featured in the first episode of the final season of the American television show Queer As Folk.\n\nShowcase / 2005 Releases\n\nIn New York City at Skylight Studios on February 23, 2005, Utada held a live showcase to American press, in which she performed six songs: \"Devil Inside\", \"Hotel Lobby\", \"Exodus '04\", \"Animato\", \"You Make Me Want To Be a Man\" and finally \"Kremlin Dusk\" as an encore. Though footage of this concert was recorded (bootleg as well as official) a DVD of this performance was never released.\n\nA third single from EXODUS, \"Exodus '04\" was released in June 2005. This maxi single had 10 mixes on it, remixed by various DJ's. It only reached #24 on Billboard Hot Dance/Club Airplay in the US, despite former success with \"Devil Inside\". No other promotion was done for this single at all.\n\nA fourth single was been released into the UK and European Union, entitled \"You Make Me Want To Be a Man\". This was coupled with a re-release of the EXODUS album a week later. To compliment the release of this album, animated Utada movie clips by anime artist Morimoto Koji were accessible through a cell-phone service called \"Flux\" in Japan (called \"MTV Digital Discovery\" in the UK). The single did poorly, only reaching #227 in the UK Singles Chart. This is credited to a lack of singles pressed as well as the fact that the single was extremely expensive. A fifth single from EXODUS, \"Hotel Lobby\", may have been planned, as a remix for this song had been commissioned, though due to the former single's dismal sales may have been shelved.\n\nULTRA BLUE Era\n\nUtada eased back into the Japanese public spotlight after a string of new singles, comprised of \"Be My Last\" (the theme song to the Japanese film Haru no Yuki), \"Passion\" (the Kingdom Hearts II theme song), and another single, \"Keep Tryin'\".\n\n\"Be My Last\", her first single in 17 months, was seen as a new era of Utada's music by both fans and critics alike. The song contained Utada's trademark vocals and lyrics, but it was sung in a more emotionally charged style, unlike her previous work. While not as commercially successful as her previous singles, \"Be My Last\" signaled a more mature and confident era in Utada's musical career.\n\n\"Passion\" showed yet another style change for Utada, as the song featured a surreal ambiance and atmosphere. Strong beats along with soaring vocals produced one of her most unique singles of the time. When asked to describe the song, Utada referred to \"Passion\" as the \"22 year old version of \"B&C\"; a song from her debut album, \"First Love\", which she had written when she was merely 15 years of age. When heard back to back, these two songs show how much Utada has grown since the birth of her career. As \"Passion\" was used as the theme song to Kingdom Hearts II in Japan, an English version of the song, titled \"Sanctuary\", was also created to be used for the international release of the game. The lyrics for \"Sanctuary\" were written before \"Passion\", and Utada found it difficult to write Japanese lyrics for the melody.\n\nIn February of 2006, Utada released her 16th Japanese language single, titled \"Keep Tryin'\". The track, featured as the \"au Listen Mobile Service\" tie-up song, was a strong pop song with Utada's trademark vocals and intricate arrangement. With wryly humorous lyrics, \"Keep Tryin'\" was another evolution in Utada's songwriting skills.\n\nIn early April, Utada's fourth Japanese album was announced, entitled ULTRA BLUE. It was followed up by Utada's second nationwide tour of Japan (after \"BOHEMIAN SUMMER LIVE 2000\") titled \"UTADA UNITED 2006\". The album contained all the singles since \"DEEP RIVER\"'s release, totaling 13 tracks. Both the tour and the album release date were set for June 2006. Notably, the tour's set list included songs from Utada's English career as well as her Japanese career. ULTRA BLUE reached #1 on the Oricon charts, sold over 900,000 copies, and became the #7 album of 2006.\n\nHEART STATION Era\n\nOn November 22, 2006, Utada released her 17th Japanese single, \"Boku wa Kuma\"; it was used in the television commercial break special show Minna no Uta for October and November 2006. The single was much more successful than expected, outselling her two most recent singles despite there being no television performances.\n\nUtada's Official Japanese website announced that she would be releasing a new single in February, called \"Flavor Of Life\", used as the dorama series \"Hana Yori Dango 2\"'s insert song. Photo shooting was taken on and around Christmas day. Sunday, December 10, 2006 was also her 9 year mark for her time in the Japanese music industry, to when she hinted towards a \"new project\" the single. The single debuted at the #1 position on Oricon charts, and was set to be her most successful single in recent times by large sales, and broke many records in the process. It charted #1 on the Oricon Weekly Singles Charts for 3 weeks, became the most downloaded ring tone on the Chaku-Uta chart for the months of January 2007, February 2007, and of all time in Japan with over 5 million downloads sold; it would be the highest debut for an Asian artist on the United World Singles Chart in more than 8 years, with a #11 peak. The single also ranked in at #2 on the Oricon Half-Year Singles Chart, and was the only female artist single in the top 10, and has amassed in excess of 650,000 units in sales to date. Utada's single sales surpassed the elusive 15 million mark by the seventh week of \"Flavor Of Life\"'s sale trajectory, and placed her only behind Amuro Namie and Hamasaki Ayumi in terms of such sales for a female or any solo artist in Japan.\n\nOn the third of March it was announced on Utada's personal blog that the previous day she had split with her husband, Kiriya Kazuaki, after four and a half years of marriage. It was a mutual split due to the fact that the pair had been gradually growing apart from each other.\n\nFollowing \"Flavor Of Life\", Utada had plans for another new single set to be released that August. The single would be a double-A side featuring the tracks \"Beautiful World\" (which would be the Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone theme song), \"Kiss & Cry\", as well as a new mix of \"Fly Me To The Moon (In Other Words)\". \"Kiss & Cry\" followed \"This Is Love\" as the FREEDOM cup noodle commercial song and the anime theme song. Quite quickly after the \"Beautiful World / Kiss & Cry\" single, in early October rumors of a new Utada song being used as the Asience hair products commercial song flew across the Internet. On October 3, 2007, it was revealed by Kao (the company that owns Asience hair products) that the song was indeed a new Utada song entitled \"Stay Gold\".\n\nLater on December 7th, the same day \"Stay Gold\" was available for Chaku-Uta download, it was revealed that the new single would be another double A-side; \"HEART STATION / Stay Gold\" would be released on February 20, 2008. \"HEART STATION\" being the Recochoku commercial theme song.\n\nTo commemorate her entering her tenth year in the Japanese music industry, complimentary download of a ring tone of her first song, \"Automatic\", was offered to the general public; it was downloaded over 500,000 times. Utada was ranked #3 on Recochoku most downloaded artists of 2007 chart. On January 26, 2008, her official Japanese site launched a special \"HEART STATION\" website with the single's information as well as blog parts to place the \"PON PON Kumachan\" video on fan's blogs. There are also links to several radio stations across Japan, presumably some promotional agreement between \"HEART STATION\" and various FM channels, with some boasting individual \"HEART STATION\" stickers, indicating each as a \"special\" Heart Station. An official \"HEART STATION\" promotional video was announced as being in development by a Barks.com news article that same day. The \"HEART STATION\" PV debuted on TV stations in Japan on February 4th, 2008. \"HEART STATION\" would go on to be the most played song on Japanese radio in the month of February with a total of 1,064 plays. Between March 10 and 13, Utada made her hit 1999 single \"First Love\" available for free as a ring tone in Japan. In those four days, it was downloaded more than 700,000 times 1. Her fifth original Japanese-language album, also titled \"HEART STATION\", was released on March 19, 2008. \"HEART STATION\" sold over 1,000,000 copies, reached #1 on the Oricon charts, and became the #5 album of 2008. With over 15,000,000 downloads, it also became the most downloaded full album of 2008.\n\nThe ninth track off HEART STATION, \"Prisoner Of Love\", was used as the theme to the drama Last Friends. A limited CD+DVD edition of \"Prisoner Of Love\" was released on May 21st, 2008.\n\nThis Is The One Era\n\nAccording to Utada's blog, on September 25, 2007, Utada began speaking to Island Def Jam about her second English-language album. Her tone suggested that she was in no rush.
