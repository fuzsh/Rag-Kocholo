        "text": "Compiling a list of seven all-time Kings of Country Music is no easy task, especially knowing many of country music’s biggest stars through interviews over the years. I have my favorites, and many of them are in the top seven; some of my favorites did not make the top seven but would definitely make the top ten or twenty.\n\nFuture Kings\n\nIn country music today, Luke Combs comes to mind when discussing a possible future King Of Country music, as does Chris Stapleton, Cody Johnson, and many more.\n\nBlake Shelton\n\nBlake is also a future King of Country Music as he brought country music to many American living rooms through his coaching of future country stars on NBC’s The Voice. Blake knows how to pick and write great country songs. He has won many awards, including Entertainer of the Year, and also honors those country stars before him and the Grand Ole Opry. If the list were 10, Blake would have made it for sure.\n\nBlake after being asked to be a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 2010.\n\nPhoto – Rick Diamond/Getty Images\n\nKeith Urban\n\nI love Keith and his music, and I listen to him all the time. Keith’s shows are also epic, and he involves his audience more than anyone else. A two-time Entertainer of the Year winner, it was hard for me personally not to put him in the top seven, but he would be in the top ten. And no one can play a guitar like Urban can. If the six-string instrument had an ambassador, it would be Keith.\n\nUrban says he will love being a mentor on The Voice when he takes on the role of Mega Mentor on the April 8 episode of NBC’s The Voice.\n\nHe told us how appearing on the talent shows when he was young helped him. Keith said, “Just getting good advice and honest advice was something I really loved and needed, so it was a no-brainer when I got asked to do it. The first one I got asked to do was be a coach on The Voice in Australia on their first season, and I did it. I loved it. Then I did quite a few seasons of American Idol as a judge on American Idol and loved it.”\n\nKeith played guitar at the 2022 CMT Music Awards.\n\nTheo Wargo/Getty Images\n\nToby Keith\n\nToby made such a difference in country music and deserves his upcoming induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame later this year (2024). His passing in February made all of us realize once again how good his songs were and how much joy and humor they brought to us over the years.\n\nToby is holding two AMA Awards in 2004.\n\nVince Bucci/Getty Images\n\nTop 7\n\nBelow are my top seven all-time Kings Of Country Music. One thing is for sure: each of these seven country superstars has made an impact on country music and beyond.\n\nRELATED: Tim McGraw: The Stage Fixture That Keeps Him Steady\n\nAll-Time Kings of Country Music"
