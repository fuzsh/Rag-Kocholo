        "text": "Their Job Is to Help You Grieve Your Pet\n\nThough still rare, social workers in animal hospitals are growing in their ranks.\n\nBy Katie Thomas and\n\nThe Pet ‘Superheroes’ Who Donate Their Blood\n\nTransfusions have become an important part of veterinary medicine, but cat and dog blood is not always easy to come by.\n\nBy\n\nWhy You’re Paying Your Veterinarian So Much\n\nPeople have grown more attached to their pets — and more willing to spend money on them — turning animal medicine into a high-tech industry worth billions.\n\nBy\n\nAre We Loving Our Pets to Death?\n\nPet owners are treating their animal charges ever more like humans. But that isn’t good for pets, or for us, many experts argue.\n\nBy\n\nFish That School Together Save Energy, Study Finds\n\nLike Olympic cyclists, fish expend less effort when swimming in tight groups than when alone. The finding could explain why some species evolved to move in schools.\n\nBy\n\nThis Is What Happens When Tigers Try to Sneak Up on Small Bears\n\nVideos in India show that sloth bears seem unaware of being stalked by the ferocious felines. When the tigers try to strike, the bears often get the better of them.\n\nBy\n\nSecrets Emerge From a Fossil’s Taco Shell-Like Cover\n\nAn examination of an aquatic, shrimplike creature that lived half a billion years ago offers insight into how arthropods with mandibles became so common.\n\nBy\n\nThe Eruption of Mt. Vesuvius Wasn’t Pompeii’s Only Killer\n\nWhile the volcano’s eruption was deadly, research shows that many people in the ancient Roman city died in building collapses from the earthquake associated with the outburst.\n\nBy\n\nHow Did Roses Get Their Thorns?\n\nThe “prickles,” as botanists call them, evolved in roses and other plants thanks to a single gene, a new study found.\n\nBy\n\nA Test for Life Versus Non-Life\n\nIn a new book, physicist Sara Walker argues that assembly theory can explain what life is, and even help scientists create new forms of it.\n\nBy\n\nEarly Humans Left Africa Much Earlier Than Previously Thought\n\nScientists have found evidence of several waves of migration by looking at the genetic signatures of human interbreeding with Neanderthals.\n\nBy\n\nHow the Denisovans Survived the Ice Age\n\nA trove of animal bone fragments from a cave on the Tibetan plateau reveals how Denisovans thrived in a harsh climate for over 100,000 years.\n\nBy"
