        "text": "Guns N’ Roses fans had a heck of a year. A pair of major releases arrived from the band, along with the fourth solo album by Slash.\n\nThe guitarist initially confirmed plans for a new expanded box set celebrating 1991's twin Use Your Illusion albums. Guns N' Roses then issued expanded editions of their digital single “Hard Skool” with bonus tracks on CD, vinyl and cassette. 4, meanwhile, extended Slash's nearly decade-long collaboration with Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators, and follows 2018's Living the Dream.\n\nDavid Bowie's previously unreleased album Toy finally arrived, two decades after its original proposed release. Elsewhere, John Mellencamp's new album Strictly a One-Eyed Jack featured three collaborations with Bruce Springsteen.\n\nJethro Tull returned with The Zealot Gene, after a studio break of nearly two decades. Rock Believer was Scorpions' first LP with former Motorhead drummer Mikkey Dee. Tears for Fears released their first album in 17 years, and longtime Joe Bonamassa collaborator Beth Hart paid tribute to Led Zeppelin.\n\nMore information on these and other rock albums can be found below.
