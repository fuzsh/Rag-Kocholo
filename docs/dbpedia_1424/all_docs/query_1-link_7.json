        "text": "«Bad» stands as one of the enduring classics by the iconic musician and singer, Michael Jackson. Serving as the title track of his seventh studio album, Bad, was released on August 31, 1987, under the Epic Records label. This marked his return after Thriller, from 1982, almost five years later.\n\nThe release date of the music video differs from that of the album, extending until September 7, providing a reason for celebration during this interim period. The song was personally written and composed by Michael Jackson and produced in collaboration with Quincy Jones.\n\nOf course, it became a commercial success, reaching number one in the most prestigious music charts. It also achieved international acclaim and solidified Michael Jackson’s status as the ‘King of Pop.’ The album became one of the best-selling albums of all time. Decades after its release, «Bad» remains an iconic piece in Michael Jackson’s repertoire, even inspiring contemporary artists like Billie Eilish to cover it, a testament to its timeless appeal.\n\nBad Tracklist\n\nBad\n\nThe Way You Make Me Feel\n\nSpeed Demon\n\nLiberian Girl\n\nJust Good Friends (with Stevie Wonder)\n\nAnother Part of Me\n\nMan in the Mirror\n\nI Just Can’t Stop Loving You (with Siedah Garrett)\n\nDirty Diana\n\nSmooth Criminal\n\nLeave Me Alone\n\nMusic Video\n\nThe music video for «Bad» is particularly fascinating. Its dance sequence in a subway station became more than iconic and it is also known for its fashion, which included Jackson’s black leather outfit and signature white glove.\n\n«Bad» Directed by Martin Scorsese\n\nJackson and Martin Scorsese, renowned filmmaker and director, created an epic 18-minute tale of urban and racial challenges in the 1980s inspired by the real life story of Edmund Perry. In 2014 Rolling Stone ranked this short film second on a list of Michael’s 20 greatest short films.\n\nStory Behind «Bad»\n\nOn the night of June 12, 1985, Edmund Perry, a 17-year-old from Harlem, was fatally shot by an undercover police officer. He was a gifted student, awarded a scholarship to attend the prestigious Stanford University. This tragic incident sparked a wave of protests in New York.\n\nThe officer claimed that Perry and his brother had attempted to rob him, justifying the shooting. The New York Times characterized it as ‘police violence against a Black individual.’ Supposedly, Michael Jackson came across this news and drew inspiration from it when he wrote and filmed the «Bad» music video.\n\nIn his autobiography ‘Moonwalk,’ Michael wrote, ‘»Bad» is a song about the street. It’s about this kid from a tough neighborhood who gets to go to a private school. He comes back to his old neighborhood during a break, and the guys start giving him trouble…’\n\nRecognizing the visual aspect’s artistic significance, Michael personally selected Martin Scorsese to direct the music video. Scorsese, the acclaimed American filmmaker known for works like ‘Taxi Driver’ and ‘Raging Bull,’ accepted the offer, marking the first of nine mini-movies produced for the album.\n\nFilming\n\nThe filming commenced on November 28, 1986, in Brooklyn and spanned six weeks.\n\nThe 18-minute short film starts in black and white, following Darryl (played by Michael Jackson), a student at an elite predominantly white private school. During a holiday break, he returns to his marginalized neighborhood, where he faces mockery and harassment from his former friends. They disdain him for not being ‘bad,’ for refusing to engage in criminal activities.\n\nDarryl confronts them in a subway station, and as the music and choreography kick in (around the 8’50» mark), the video transitions from black and white to color.\n\nWesley Snipes, then an unknown actor, portrayed Mini Max, the leader of the rival gang. He was selected from hundreds of auditionees. In an interview on The Tonight Show, Snipes recalled that Michael Jackson was nervous during the Harlem shoot. While many were ecstatic about his presence, some were less welcoming.\n\nJackson asked Snipes if he was afraid, to which Snipes replied, ‘No, Mike, this is Harlem, baby! This is where we grew up.’ He described how he comforted the singer by holding his hand as they walked the streets, marking the beginning of a friendship, with occasional further conversations.\n\nInterestingly, Prince was originally considered for the role of Mini Max. In an interview with Conan O’Brien for TBS, Wesley recounted that Prince auditioned for the same part, but, as Wesley put it, he ‘knocked Prince out.’ However, Prince remembered it differently.\n\nIn a 1997 interview with Chris Rock, he admitted that he had been cast for the role but turned it down after reading the first line of the song: ‘Your butt is mine.’ Prince questioned, ‘Who’s going to sing that to whom? Because I’m sure not going to sing that to you. And I’m sure you’re not going to sing it to me. So we have a problem.’\n\nTo craft the script, Scorsese enlisted Richard Price, with whom he had just completed ‘The Color of Money’ starring Paul Newman and Tom Cruise. Jackson contributed ideas to help shape the video’s narrative, which addressed the racial and urban issues of the late ’80s. Originally, the protagonist was killed in a Harlem shootout, but in the final edit, Darryl survived.\n\nMartin Scorsese spent two and a half weeks on the dance sequence alone, which was shot at the Hoyt-Schermerhorn subway station in Brooklyn. The choreography, inspired by the 1961 film ‘West Side Story’ and modern street dance, was captured in a single take using a moving camera technique.\n\nDressed in bold and provocative black leather adorned with numerous buckles and zippers, Michael presented a daring street image for the first time. Clad in the same outfit featured on the cover of «Bad,» he led his group of dancers, asserting his unwavering stance against violence and ultimately earning the respect of his peers."
