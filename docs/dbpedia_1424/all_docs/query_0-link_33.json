        "text": "Revised 12/02/22\n\nConvened Meetings\n\nThe CHRMS and CHRBSS Committees meet monthly when there are agenda items.\n\nCHRMS II is only convened when it is impracticable to convene a full meeting. This decision will be made by the IRB Regulatory Analysts in consultation with the Committee Chair. CHRMS II will not be used to conduct regular routine business and will follow all policies, procedures, and guidelines of the full committee.\n\nIn-Person or Virtual Convened Meetings\n\nConvened meetings may occur all in-person, all virtually or a mix of both. Offering virtual and hybrid meetings provides easier access to the meeting for many members. Use of an electronic submission and review process readily supports the virtual review process. The regulatory requirements (e.g., quorum, representation, etc.) for both types of meetings are met and documented in the minutes.\n\nThe IRB will either schedule a suitable conference room or utilize Microsoft Teams for the IRB meetings. Meeting proceedings are conducted in the same order/manner in both types of meetings. The agenda items are discussed, a motion is made, and members cast their audible votes.\n\nMembers who are conflicted with a specific agenda item must recuse from discussion and cannot count toward a quorum or vote on that item per Section 6. Conflict of Interest. Members should notify IRB staff of their conflict prior to the meeting, when possible, so IRB staff can determine if quorum can be maintained during the recusal on that specific vote. Both in-person and virtual meetings require the conflicted member to step out (physically or virtually) temporarily during the discussion and vote on the given agenda item. They are admitted back into the meeting once the vote is complete.\n\nMeeting Notices\n\nThe agenda, including the time and location of the meeting, are distributed in advance to all members. All pre-meeting materials for protocols are located within the electronic system.\n\nNon-Member Attendance at a Convened Meeting\n\nGuests are allowed to attend a convened meeting in certain circumstances (e.g., students for educational purposes or consultants for expertise opinion). These individuals are required to complete the IRB Meeting Guest Confidentiality Agreement prior to attending a meeting. Principal investigators are also allowed and sometimes invited to a convened meeting to address/discuss human subject issues with their proposed or ongoing protocol.\n\nConducting Initial Reviews\n\nInitial convened IRB reviews and approvals will occur in compliance with 45 CFR 46, 21 CFR 50 AND 56 when applicable, and provisions of this Assurance for each project not properly found to be exempt (Section 101[b]) by the Research Protections Office.\n\nThe Committees determine all of the requirements outlined in 45 CFR 46.111 are satisfied for each protocol, including all of the requirements for obtaining informed consent and documentation of written informed consent as applicable. Reviewer forms and checklists are utilized as a guide by reviewers and other Committee members to ensure that these criteria have been met.\n\nThe IRB shall apply additional protections as necessary to protect potentially vulnerable research subjects. Not every human being is capable of self-determination. The capacity for self-determination matures during an individual's life, and some individuals lose this capacity wholly or in part because of illness, impaired decision-making capabilities, or circumstances that severely restrict liberty. The extent of additional protection afforded depends upon the risk of harm and the likelihood of benefit. In addition, when IRB reviews research involving a specific vulnerable population, consideration will be given to inclusion of one or more members who are knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these subjects. All specific IRB findings as required by 45 CFR 46 for special protections will be documented.\n\nIRB and federal regulation policy require a prisoner representative to be present and review the protocol at a meeting when a prisoner population is the target of the research.\n\nAll initial reviews conducted at a convened meeting will have assigned a primary and a secondary member reviewer. Exceptions to this will be if the committee reviews a HUD or an Expanded access protocol in which only one primary reviewer is required.\n\nConducting Continuing Reviews\n\nContinuing convened IRB reviews and approvals will occur in compliance with 45 CFR 46, 21 CFR 50 AND 56 when applicable, and provisions of this Assurance for each project not properly found to be exempt (Section 101[b]) by the Research Protections Office. Continuing reviews, as applicable, will be preceded by IRB receipt of appropriate progress reports from the investigator, which incorporate relevant study-wide findings.\n\nThe Committees determine all of the requirements outlined in 45 CFR 46.111 continue to be satisfied for each annual continuing review submission, including all of the requirements for obtaining informed consent and documentation of written informed consent as applicable. Reviewer forms and checklists are utilized as a guide by reviewers and other Committee members to ensure that these criteria have been met.\n\nContinuing reviews may be approved pending requests for minor protocol edits or clarifications but are not released to the researcher until receipt of an acceptable response to the clarifications. In some instances, this process results in a continued approval date that is prior to the response date. All reviews are conducted electronically through the electronic submission and review system.\n\nAll continuing reviews conducted at a convened meeting will have assigned one primary member reviewer.\n\nWritten Review Procedures\n\nThe institution and the designated IRBs have established written procedures for the following, in accordance with the terms stated in the FWA. (Sec. __.108)(3)\n\n· verifying whether proposed activities qualify for exemption from IRB review;\n\n· conducting IRB initial and continuing review, approving research, and reporting IRB findings to the investigator and the institution in writing as required;\n\n· determining which projects require review more often than annually, and which projects need verification from sources other than the investigator that no material changes have occurred;\n\n· ensuring that changes in approved research are reported promptly and are not initiated without IRB approval, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the participant;\n\n· ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB, institutional officials, the relevant Department or Agency Head, any applicable regulatory body, and OHRP of any\n\n(i) unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in any covered research;\n\n(ii) serious or continuing noncompliance with Federal, institutional, or IRB requirements; and\n\n(iii) suspension or termination of IRB approval for Federally supported research;\n\n· official action on protocols involving use of drugs or medical devices is taken in accordance with applicable FDA regulations governing human research review; and\n\n· the IRB has a process for monitoring on-going research to assess congruence with the IRB-approved protocols and compliance with applicable human subject protection guidelines and regulations, which includes monitoring a sample of studies, prioritizing the review of protocols that do not have other formal monitoring processes in place.\n\n· Except when certain exempt or expedited review procedure is used (as described in Sec. __.110), an IRB must review proposed research at convened meetings at which a majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. In order for the research to be approved, it shall receive the approval of a majority of those members present at the meeting.\n\nApproval, Effective, and Expiration Dates\n\nDefinitions:\n\nApproval Date: The date on which the reviewer approved the study, continuing review, or modification as submitted without any conditions, or approved the study or modification conditionally, pending modifications. No unapproved research activities involving human subjects may be initiated until the approval becomes effective.\n\nEffective Date: Whenever the IRB approves a research study, continuing review or modification with one or more conditions at the time of review, the effective date of the approval is the date on which the IRB chair or his/her designee has reviewed and accepted as satisfactory any revised protocol or informed consent documents, or any other responsive materials required by the IRB from the investigator. In these circumstances, no unapproved research activities involving human subjects may be initiated until the conditions have been satisfied in the manner set forth by the IRB and the approval becomes effective.\n\nThe IRB determines the initial approval and effective dates in the following manner:\n\nProtocols reviewed at a Full convened meeting:\n\nWhen a research study is approved without any clarifications or revisions at a convened meeting, the date of the convened meeting is both the approval and effective date:\n\nApproval Date: the date of the committee meeting\n\nEffective Date: the date of the committee meeting\n\nExpiration Date: one year minus one day after the approval date. For logistical reasons, the IRB may set the expiration date less than 12 months.\n\nWhen the research study is approved but requires a response secondary to clarifications or revisions at a convened meeting:\n\nApproval Date: the date of the committee meeting\n\nEffective Date: the date the committee approved the response\n\nExpiration Date: one year minus one day after the approval date. For logistical reasons, the IRB may set the expiration date less than 12 months.\n\nProtocols reviewed through the expedited review process:\n\nWhen a research study is reviewed by the Chair or his/her designee and approves the project without requiring any clarifications or revisions:\n\nApproval Date: the date that the reviewer made their initial determination.\n\nEffective Date: the date that the reviewer made their initial determination (note that in this case, since there are no modifications required, the approval and effective date will be the same.)\n\nExpiration Date: one year minus one day after the approval date.\n\nWhen a research study is reviewed by the Chair or his/her designee and requires clarifications or revisions to the protocol as a condition of approval:\n\nApproval Date: the date that the reviewer made their initial determination.\n\nEffective Date: the date that the Chair or his/her designee approved the response. (Note that in this case, since modifications were required, the effective date will not be the same as the approval date.)\n\nExpiration Date: one year minus one day after the approval date.\n\nModifications reviewed at a Full convened meeting:\n\nWhen a modification is approved without any clarifications or revisions at a convened meeting, the date of the convened meeting is both the approval and effective date:\n\nApproval Date: the date of the committee meeting\n\nEffective Date: the date of the committee meeting\n\nWhen the modification is approved but requires a response secondary to clarifications or revisions at a convened meeting:\n\nApproval Date: the date of the committee meeting\n\nEffective Date: the date the committee approved the response\n\nModifications reviewed through the expedited review process (including study team member updates):\n\nWhen a modification is reviewed by the Chair or his/her designee and approves the project without requiring any clarifications or revisions:\n\nApproval Date: the date that the reviewer made their initial determination.\n\nEffective Date: the date that the reviewer made their initial determination (note that in this case, since there are no modifications required, the approval and effective date will be the same.)\n\nWhen a modification is reviewed by the Chair or his/her designee and requires clarifications or revisions to the protocol as a condition of approval:\n\nApproval Date: the date that the reviewer made their initial determination.\n\nEffective Date: the date that the Chair or his/her designee approved the response. (Note that in this case, since modifications were required, the effective date will not be the same as the approval date.)\n\n*Please note that the overall the effective date of a protocol (i.e. the effective date displayed on the parent study submission) is the effective date of the most current version of the protocol. This date will change each time a continuing review or modification has been approved.\n\nDetermining date for second and all subsequent continuing reviews\n\nContinuing reviews reviewed at a Full convened meeting\n\nFor all subsequent continuing reviews of a research study requiring ongoing approval, the date of the convened meeting at which the IRB conducts continuing review and approves the study (with or without conditions) is the next approval date. The expiration date will be one year minus one day after the approval date. For logistical reasons, the IRB may set the expiration date less than 12 months.\n\nThe overall protocol effective date will be updated to reflect the effective date of the continued approval.\n\nContinuing reviews reviewed through expedited review process:\n\nFor all subsequent continuing reviews of a research study requiring ongoing approval, the date that the Chair or his/her designee conducts continuing review and approves the study (with or without conditions) is the next approval date.\n\nThe expiration date will be one year minus one day after the approval date. The overall protocol effective date will be updated to reflect the effective date of the continued approval.\n\nVoting Requirements\n\n1. A majority of the total number of regular voting members will constitute a quorum. The number in attendance must be one more than half the total number of regular voting members. If less than a majority of the total number of regular voting members is present, one or more alternate members may be included to constitute a quorum if they have been specifically designated to alternate for a specific absent member and meet all other membership criteria.\n\n2. At least one nonscientific member must be present to constitute a quorum.\n\n3. For review of FDA regulated articles, at least one physician must be present to constitute a quorum.\n\n4. Official Committee action on protocols involving human subjects will be by formal vote of a simple majority at convened meetings of a quorum of Committee members.\n\n5. All meetings will be conducted using Robert’s Rules of Order as guidance, with deviations made as deemed appropriate by the Chair.\n\n6. Official action on a protocol involving use of drugs or medical devices will be in accordance with FDA regulations governing human research review.\n\n7. IRB members may participate in a convened meeting of the IRB via telephone or video conferencing. Those members have access to the research protocol materials in advance of the meeting within UVMClick-IRB.\n\nReport Findings\n\nThe Committees on Human Research are responsible for reporting findings, actions as well as requesting clarifications to the investigators in writing, and to the appropriate offices within the institutions’ administration through reports and meeting minutes to institutional officials through their representatives on the Committee, and to sponsors of research, if so required.\n\nProcess for Appeal\n\nThere is no process delineated for appeal of Committee decisions. However, there is no prohibition for resubmission of specific requests or protocols for additional review by the Committee.\n\nProtocols Requiring More Frequent Review\n\nDetermination of which studies require review more often than annually is done at the time of initial protocol review, continuing review, on a case-by-case basis, depending upon protocol specific factors, including, but not limited to, the level of risk.\n\nProtocols Requiring Verification from Other Sources\n\nDetermination of which studies need verification from sources other than the investigators that no material changes have occurred since previous IRB review is done on a case by case basis either by the primary reviewer at initial review, continuing review, or through information received (e.g., adverse event or unanticipated problems to subjects or others reports or complaints) and would depend upon protocol specific factors. Information is also collected through the Committee’s monitoring program and through reports from both internal sources (i.e., Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee at the Vermont Cancer Center or the Clinical Research Center’s Scientific Advisory Committee or the Research Subject Advocate) and external entities (i.e., DSMBs or sponsor monitoring visit reports).\n\nModification to Protocol\n\nThe Committees on Human Research require changes in approved research to be reviewed and approved prior to initiation except where it is necessary to eliminate immediate hazard. Changes implemented to the protocol prior to Committee approval is considered noncompliance.\n\nUnanticipated Problems/Serious or Continuing Noncompliance\n\nThe Committees on Human Research promptly report all unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others, serious or continuing noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements of the IRB, and suspension or termination of IRB approval to appropriate institutional officials (the UVM Vice President for Research and the UVM Medical Center CMO when applicable) and federal agencies (i.e., OHRP, FDA and/or other agencies as appropriate). All such matters are appropriately reviewed, and any necessary actions are taken to ensure continued protection of human subjects.\n\nDetermination of Significant vs Non-significant Risk Devices\n\nFor research involving investigational devices, it is the responsibility of the convened Committee on Human Research in the Medical Sciences to determine which device studies pose significant or non-significant risk when the studies do not have an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). Studies which are determined to be significant risk must obtain an IDE from the FDA. Studies which have already obtained an IDE are assumed to be significant risk studies and this determination is not necessarily discussed or documented.\n\nIRB Record Requirements (Sec. __.115)\n\nThe IRB keeps all records in accordance with all pertinent regulations. This record keeping includes the following.\n\nMembership rosters Sec. __.108(a)(2)The institution is required to maintain a current list of IRB members identified by name; earned degrees; representative capacity; indications of experience such as board certifications or licenses sufficient to describe each member's chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment or other relationship between each member and the institution, for example, full-time employee, part-time employee, member of governing panel or board, stockholder, paid or unpaid consultant. UVM rosters indicate regular voting versus alternate members, specific OHRP designation, if applicable, as well as alternate replacement assignments. Rosters are updated each time there is a change in the Committee membership. Copies of curriculum vitae are obtained and kept on file for all primary and alternate members.\n\nWritten procedures and guidelines including, but not limited to, the IRB Policy and Procedure Research Manual, the FWA, and all website content.\n\nIRB Minutes – see section 1.3.5\n\nConvened CHRMS II and convened safety meeting minutes will be uploaded along with the agenda for the next full committee meeting for members to review online. Subsequent protocol reviews, just as amendments and continuing reviews will be reviewed through the CHRMS system of operations.\n\nA report of business conducted by the expedited review process is available in the UVMClick-IRB system.\n\nProtocol files as of 2017 are electronic. Any protocol materials received prior to that are in paper format. Both the paper and the electronic files include protocols, continuing reviews, modification, safety reports, adverse events, and consent documents. Once closed, any paper files are stored off-site and can be retrieved within 24-48 hours. Protocol files, whether paper or electronic will be destroyed after the protocol has been completed for at least six years.\n\nStatements of significant new findings provided to subjects are kept in the protocol file.\n\nCommunications to and from the IRB are maintained in the protocol file.\n\nEmergency use reports are kept in an electronic file.\n\nBudget and accounting records when relevant.\n\nInitial and Continuing Review (Sec. _115(a)(3) IRB will document decisions to require continuing review or full board review even in circumstances when such review is not required.\n\nSingle IRB (Sec._115(a)(9) IRB will maintain adequate documentation of the responsibilities that each entity will undertake to ensure compliance with the cooperative research policy.\n\nDocumentation for Full Committee Review For each protocol reviewed by the convened IRB, the following will be available in UVMClick:\n\no IRB Actions/determinations\n\no Review type\n\no Action\n\no The vote on IRB actions, including the number of members voting for, against, abstaining, and recusal\n\no A written summary of the discussion and resolution of controversial issues\n\no Minor or substantive revisions required to secure approval and the basis for the revisions\n\no The basis for disapproving research\n\no The effective date, the initial approval date and expiration date\n\nDocumentation of Actions Completed Outside of Convened Meetings For protocols approved with specific minor conditions, the minutes of the first IRB meeting that takes place after approval was finalized will provide the date the conditions were met.\n\no IRB minutes include sufficient information to notify IRB members of the following:\n\no Expedited reviews of new projects, including Expedited Review Category\n\no Expedited reviews of minor amendments to full board protocols, including a list of the amendments and confirmation the amendments met the criteria for Expedited Review (i.e., the amendments pose minimal risk)\n\no Expedited reviews of amendments to research initially approved by expedited procedures, including a list of the amendments and Expedited Review Category\n\no Expedited continuing reviews, including Expedited Review Category\n\no NOTE: For research reviewed under expedited procedures, regulatory requirements for discussions, decisions and findings (including protocol-specific justifications) will be documented UVMClick. This includes findings related to level of risk and waivers or alterations of informed consent.\n\nAuthority to Review/Sign IRB Documents\n\nThe IRB Chair and his/her designee(s) are authorized to sign any and all documents on behalf of the IRB in connection with the review and approval (or determination of exemption) of research project involving human subjects. Implementation shall be the responsibility of the RPO Director. All Member signatures are electronic and in compliance with FDA 21 CFR Part 11.\n\na. Results of Reviews, Actions and Decisions from a Full or Expedited Review\n\nDepending upon the nature of the required conditions, the IRB designates any of the following individuals or groups of individuals to determine that the conditions of approval have been satisfied:\n\n· The IRB chair or Associate Chair\n\n· Another IRB member\n\n· An IRB Regulatory Analyst or\n\nReview of response materials from investigators requiring medical, scientific, or other technical expertise will be assigned to scientific members as applicable.\n\nResponse materials that do not require medical, scientific, or other technical expertise may be assigned to non-scientific members as applicable.\n\nb. Specific authority granted to IRB Regulatory Analyst members using expedited review procedures\n\n· Review and approval of exemption determinations\n\n· Waiver and/or Alteration of HIPAA determinations\n\n· Amendments that are administrative in nature such as\n\no New recruitment materials\n\no Change in sponsor\n\no Closure to accrual\n\no Change in collaborating sites\n\no Change in study title\n\no Continuing review of projects that are in data analysis, long term follow-up with no more than minimal risk procedures, protocols where work has not yet begun or grant proposals lacking definite plan for involvement of human subjects\n\no Change to previously approved recruitment material\n\no Correction of typographical and spelling errors in consent or protocol\n\no Correction of omission of sponsor\n\no IDB Updates, DSMB reports, Annual IDE Reports\n\no Updates to Data Management and Security Plans\n\no Changes to Key Personnel\n\no Retention materials (sponsor newsletters, calendars, water bottles etc.)\n\no Sponsors close out documents (thank you letters to patients and/or physicians, certificate of site completion.\n\nc. Routine Internal Correspondence\n\nAny action, letter, memo or e-mail between the Committee or IRB Regulatory analyst and the faculty or staff of the University that provides information concerning the review of research protocols by the Committee or IRB Regulatory analyst and which do not imply or appear to imply approval of this activity may be signed by an IRB Regulatory analyst.\n\nAny letters, memos or email sent representing the decision or opinions of the Chairs of the IRBs or their respective designees, as long as such correspondence does not imply review and approval by the designee, may be signed by IRB Regulatory Analysts. (e.g., RNI, compliance memos)\n\nElectronic Reviews\n\nAll reviews, initial, continuing reviews and modifications are completed electronically by the IRB members as assigned. Members receive an email notice that a review is pending. Members are required to authenticate into the electronic system using their UVM NetID and password prior to completing their review. The system validates the member’s authentication credentials based upon the member’s role in the system and determines available actions for each person. The electronic review is stamped within the system with the name of the individual carrying out the review activity (electronic signature), and the time and date that the electronic signature was applied to the review.\n\nMembers should only access records they have been assigned to review.\n\nBack to Top\n\nBackground\n\nThis guidance is intended to assist researchers in developing data management and security plans for human research data. The guidance presents relevant definitions and key concepts concerning human research data, describes the roles and responsibilities for data management, outlines the elements of a research data management and security plan, and describes requirements for maintaining and using human research information once protocols are completed.\n\nThe protection of privacy and the confidentiality of information about research participants is a special concern for IRBs in their review of research data management. Research participants must have a reasonable expectation that personal information will be disclosed only with their permission or in ways consistent with the consent process, and in compliance with laws and regulations. Breeches of confidentiality could have serious consequences for research participants, including potential discrimination, misuse of genetic information, loss of insurance, or loss of privacy. Even with all the appropriate state and federal laws, University and hospital policies, and requirements of IRBs all aimed at protecting the confidentiality of a research participant’s individually identifiable private information, breeches of privacy can and do occur. Such deviations may be inadvertent (accidental) or due to carelessness, deliberate or compelled by regulation or law.\n\nClearly defined procedures to protect the confidentiality of human participants that are adhered to can significantly reduce the possibility of violations to the confidentiality of human research data and should be part of every study design.\n\nTechnical Support and Institutional Policies\n\nUVM\n\nUVM Information Security Operations Team\n\niso@uvm.edu\n\nCOM IT Information Security\n\ninfosecurity@med.uvm.edu\n\nUniversity of Vermont (UVM) policies:\n\nUVM IS Policy & UVM IS Procedures Intellectual Property\n\nUVM Privacy Policy\n\nUVM File Transfer Service\n\nUVM Health Network Resources, Policies & Procedures\n\nFile sharing:\n\nNote that these platforms must be accessed through the UVMHN Intranet\n\nUVMHN Add Guest to Microsoft Teams/Sharepoint/OneDrive (Add guest user from outside UVMHN)\n\nUVMHN GoAnywhere File Transfer (Perform a file transfer from one location to another location)\n\nUVMHN policies: Note that these policies can be accessed through UVM Commons or via the UVMHN Intranet\n\nUVMHN_INFO4 Policy\n\nUVMHN_INFO5 Policy\n\nUVMHN Privacy32 Policy\n\nUVMMC Research1 Policy\n\nDefinitions and Key Concepts\n\nAnonymization\n\nThis process removes information from data that allows recognition of particular individuals. Common strategies for anonymizing data are deleting or masking personal identifiers, such as name and social security number, and suppressing or generalizing quasi-identifiers, such as date of birth and zip code. Typically, anonymized data is not coded; it ordinarily contains no link to individually identifying information that may be available to the researcher. Information that was previously recorded or collected without any of the 18 identifiers as defined by HIPAA would also be considered anonymized (again there can be no code associated with the data.)\n\nCoding\n\nCoding is a process in which identifying information, that would enable the investigator to readily ascertain the identity of the individual to whom the private information or specimens pertains, is replaced with a number, letter, symbol, or combination thereof and a key linking the code to identifiers is created. The key must be maintained separately from the coded data. Coding is one means to protect the confidentiality of research data. Coded data sets are not considered “anonymized” nor “de-identified”.\n\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164.501) establishes the conditions under which protected health information may be used or disclosed by covered entities for research purposes. The Rule requires that a code for the re-identification of health information is not derived from or be related to identifiers specific to an individual and not be capable of translation to identify that individual.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nConfidentiality means restricting access to information that an individual has disclosed in circumstances that the individual can reasonably expect the information will not be made public. The relationship between a researcher and a study participant is ordinarily one of trust. This relationship often includes an expectation that personal information collected for research that is ordinarily regarded as private will not be divulged outside the research team without explicit permission or in ways that are inconsistent with consent to research participation.\n\nCovered Entity\n\nThose entities to which HIPAA Privacy Rule standards apply are called “covered entities”. They are defined as (1) health insurance plans, (2) health care clearinghouses, and (3) health care providers that electronically transmit health information in connection with medical service transactions.\n\nData\n\nFactual information (as measurements or statistics) is used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation. There are many ways to categorize data; for the purpose of this guidance, the terms as used in this document are described below.\n\nResearch data refers to collected and recorded factual information commonly accepted in scientific and scholarly communities as necessary to validate research findings. Research data can be classified as:\n\n• Anonymous research data: Research data that lacks information that would allow the recognition of particular individuals by the researcher.\n\n• Health data: Health information created or received by health care providers, insurance plans, and clearinghouses that is individually identifiable is protected by federal and state laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA; see the definition below).\n\n• Identifiable biospecimen/identifiable private information. An identifiable biospecimen is a biospecimen for which the identity of the participant is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the biospecimen.\n\n• Identifiable research data: Research data containing information that allows recognition of particular individuals from the data by the researcher.\n\n• Indirectly identifiable research data: Research data that are coded with a key linking the data to individually identifying information. The key may or may not be available to the researcher.\n\n• Limited data set: See the definition below.\n\n• Processed research data: Analyses, descriptions, and conclusions prepared as reports, manuscripts, theses, or papers.\n\n• Published research data: Written information distributed to people beyond those involved in research data acquisition.\n\n• Raw or primary research data: Information recorded as notes, images, video recordings, paper surveys, computer files, etc., pertaining to a specific research protocol. Examples of such data are: survey responses, observations of behaviors, observations of medical symptoms, temperature readings, behavioral or medical test results, biological samples, and radiographic images.\n\nDe-Identification\n\nAs required by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, this process involves the removal of the following 18 informational elements from health information, related to the patient and the patient’s relatives, employers, and household members, as defined by the HIPAA Act of 1996.\n\n1. Names.\n\n2. All geographic subdivisions smaller than a state, including street address, city, county, precinct, ZIP Code, and their equivalent geocodes, except for the initial three digits of a ZIP Code if, according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census:\n\na. The geographic unit formed by combining all ZIP Codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people, and\n\nb. The initial three digits of a ZIP Code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people are changed to 000.\n\n3. All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death; and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older. The population of a zip code can be identified on the web site of the U.S. Census Bureau at the following url: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sis/resources/data-tools/pop-finder.html\n\n4. Telephone numbers.\n\n5. Facsimile numbers.\n\n6. Electronic mail addresses.\n\n7. Social security numbers.\n\n8. Medical record numbers.\n\n9. Health insurance plan beneficiary numbers.\n\n10. Account numbers.\n\n11. Certificate/license numbers.\n\n12. Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers.\n\n13. Device identifiers and serial numbers.\n\n14. Web universal resource locators (URLs).\n\n15. Internet protocol (IP) address numbers.\n\n16. Biometric identifiers, including fingerprints and voiceprints.\n\n17. Full-face photographic images and any comparable images.\n\n18. Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code\n\nDe-identified health information is not protected by HIPAA, and therefore is not participant to its regulations. However, UVM/UVMHN may still require appropriate data sharing agreements.\n\nHIPAA Privacy Rule standard for re-identification.\n\nIn addition, health information can be de-identified if (a) a person with appropriate knowledge of and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods determines that the risk is very small that the health information could be used to identify an individual and documents the methods and results of this analysis, or (b) the covered entity from which health information is being obtained does not have actual knowledge that the information could be used to identify an individual.\n\nEncryption\n\nEncryption is the process of comprehensively encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can read it. Encryption limits access to data by controlling the distribution of the decoding algorithm to authorized individuals. Encryption is one means of protecting the confidentiality of research data. Under HIPAA, if protected health information is encrypted, this action provides a “safe harbor” from violating HIPAA.\n\nHealth Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)\n\nHIPAA is federal legislation that, along with its implementing regulations, produced legal protections for health information. This legislation has had an impact on the conduct of research involving health information. A critical part of HIPAA for research activities is the so-called privacy regulations, often referred to as the Privacy Rule. The intent of the HIPAA Privacy Rule is to protect the confidentiality of health care information and define the rights of patients regarding their health information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule created the concept of “protected health information” or “PHI”, which is individually identifiable health information created or received by a covered entity (See the definition of covered entity above.)\n\nUnder the HIPAA Privacy Rule, specific permission from patients for research use of health information may be obtained using an Authorization in addition to the consent process. The HIPAA Privacy Rule specifies the kinds of information included in the Authorization language. Provided certain regulatory criteria are satisfied, an IRB may waive or alter the information included in the Authorization language. Refer to HHS.gov for additional information regarding the conduct of research.\n\nHonest Broker\n\nAn honest broker obtains legally protected data from their source and typically codes and then de-identifies the data or creates a limited data set for research use. The honest broker retains the key linking the code to identifiers for individual contributors of the data. If questions arise about the validity or accuracy of the data, the honest broker can typically resolve them without revealing the identity of individuals to the researcher. As a result of the activities of the honest broker, the research conducted with processed data may not involve human participants, because the data lacks identifiable private information.\n\nAn investigator actively involved in the research in which the data are used cannot be an honest broker, nor can any person under the investigator’s supervision.\n\nIdentifiers\n\nIdentifiers are specific informational elements that permit the recognition of a particular person.\n\nLimited Data Set\n\nUnder the HIPAA Privacy Rule, a limited data set is defined as protected health information that excludes direct identifiers of an individual or of relatives, employers, or household members of that individual. A limited data set may only be used for the purposes of research, public health, or health care operations.\n\nDirect Identifiers that Must be Removed from Limited Data Sets\n\n1. Names\n\n2. Postal address information, other than town, or city, state, and zip code\n\n3. Telephone numbers\n\n4. Fax numbers\n\n5. Electronic mail addresses\n\n6. Social Security numbers\n\n7. Medical record numbers\n\n8. Health plan beneficiary numbers\n\n9. Account numbers\n\n10. Certificate/license numbers\n\n11. Vehicle identifiers & serial numbers, license plate numbers\n\n12. Device identifiers and serial numbers\n\n13. Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs)\n\n14. Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers\n\n15. Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints\n\n16. Full face photographic images and any comparable images\n\nData Use Agreement (DUA)\n\nThe agreement between the source of the protected health information and the recipient is needed for use of a limited data set. This agreement restricts the uses and disclosures of the limited data set, requires the recipient to establish appropriate safeguards to limit further uses and disclosures, applies the HIPAA Privacy Rule to the use of the limited data set, and prohibits identifying or contact with the individuals who contributed the data.\n\nRepository\n\nA repository compiles data, specimens, or both for future research purposes. The repository receives, processes, stores, and distributes data with or without specimens to researchers. The repository may or may not be an honest broker.\n\nSensitive Data\n\nIdentifiable data that if disclosed, lost, misused, or accessed without authorization, could have adverse consequences for participants or could damage their financial standing, employability, insurability, or reputation are considered highly sensitive. Examples include:\n\n1. Research on HIV and other STDs;\n\n2. Studies that collect information on sexual attitudes, preferences, or practices;\n\n3. Studies on the use of alcohol, drugs or other addictive products;\n\n4. Studies that collect information on illegal conduct;\n\n5. Studies that gather information that if released could be damaging to a participant’s financial standing, employability, or reputation within the community;\n\n6. Research involving information that might lead to social stigmatization or discrimination if it were disclosed;\n\n7. Research on participant’s psychological well-being or mental health;\n\n8. Genetic studies, including those that collect and store biological samples for future use;\n\n9. Research on behavioral interventions and epidemiologic studies.\n\nThe IRB may recommend that a Certificate of Confidentiality be applied in these cases to allow researchers to refuse to disclose names or other identifying characteristics of research participants in response to legal demands. Very stringent security precautions need to be in place to protect research data while in storage or being transferred.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities for Human Participant Data Management\n\nPrincipal Investigators (PIs) and Faculty Sponsors (FS)\n\nPIs and FS (if applicable) are responsible for developing an appropriate data management plan as well as ensuring that research staff members are thoroughly trained to maintain the integrity of the research data that is collected. These responsibilities include determining how to best collect, store, protect, analyze, and disseminate research data.\n\nResearch Team Members\n\nThe primary research data management responsibilities of research coordinators, research assistants, and those in similar positions are usually involved with research data collection, ensuring the reliable and accurate collection of the research data and protecting the confidentiality of research data that are collected. Statisticians are primarily responsible for ensuring comprehensive and appropriate research data analysis.\n\nThe Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)\n\nThe IRBs are responsible for reviewing and approval of proposed data management and security plans, so the rights and welfare of research participants are protected.\n\nThe Research Data Management Plan\n\nA summary of four basic types of research data sets appears in the table below.\n\nDATA SET CONTAINS DIRECT IDENTIFIERSDATA SET IS CODEDLIMITED DATA SETDATA SET IS DE-IDENTIFIEDData contains direct identifiers that allow the data to be associated with a living unique individual. This may include protected health information (PHI) or protected personally identifiable information (PII).A coding scheme is applied that can be used to directly link the information to an individual. Direct identifiers among the data are replaced by a code and a key to the code links it to individual identities. Re-identification of the data is possible.Can include indirect identifiers, e.g., dates more specific than the year and some components of address.All direct and indirect identifiers and any codes that could be used to link the information to specific individuals are never recorded or are removed from the data set.\n\nBefore beginning a new scientific research protocol, the PI and research team should address the following activities related to research data management.\n\nData Collection\n\nThe information below is intended as general advice to researchers about devising a data and security management plan (DMSP).\n\nThe DMSP should reflect whether the protocol requires the use of:\n\n• Direct identifiers,\n\n• Coded data,\n\n• Indirect identifiers (limited data set),\n\n• De-identified data,\n\nThe use of identifiers should have a clear justification because it will increase risks to the confidentiality of participant data. If the research data is coded, the plan should describe the coding methodology, and the security arrangements for storage of the “key” linking the code to identifiers. The key should be stored separately from the data.\n\nData Storage\n\nResearchers should decide how they are going to store research data, in what format, and for how long. Considerations should include the data retention requirements of UVM and UVMMC, sponsors, and publishers, plus intellectual property protection, and potential data sharing.\n\nEnough research data should be retained so that the findings of a protocol can be reconstructed with ease. While this does not mean that a protocol needs to retain all the raw research data that was collected, relevant statistics and analyses from this research data should be saved, along with any notes or observations.\n\nSome key issues for electronic research data storage are: (1) thorough documentation to allow research data to be appropriately used in the future and (2) using storage formats that are adaptable to evolving computer hardware and software. There are also some additional considerations that are unique to electronic research data storage, including rapid access to the data, fast read/write rates, ability to archive and remove the data, low cost, and a backup system.\n\nData Sharing\n\nPertains to the sharing of research data and/or biospecimens with the study sponsor or funder and/or individuals other than UVM/UVMHN key personnel. A data use or data sharing agreement may be required to specify what type of identifiers will be shared, with whom and reasons why the data is to be shared. Researchers sharing data outside of UVM or UVMHN are required to contact UVM Sponsored Project Administration (SPA) or UVM Medical Center’s Office of Clinical Trials Research (OCTR) to determine what type of agreement is required.\n\nData Retention and Disposal\n\nResearch sponsor requirements, clinical trial contracts, federal grant terms and conditions, data sharing plans, intellectual property protection, publishers’ policies, and the potential future value of the research data often require long retention periods. In addition, UVMMC’s policies apply to clinical care and other health services delivery data. In general, the UVM records retention policy applies. It can be found here.\n\nThe IRB strongly recommends that researchers remove direct identifiers, such as those listed in the HIPAA Privacy Rule standard for de-identification, so that the identity of individual research participants cannot be readily ascertained from the data. Additionally, researchers should arrange to securely archive signed consent forms. Such procedures for stored research data serve to minimize risks to participants. The IRB review process includes asking researchers to describe their plans and procedures for long-term maintenance of research data involving human participants when study protocols are closed.\n\nDestruction of Research Data\n\nWhen researchers decide that research data should no longer be maintained, the data should be thoroughly and completely destroyed. Effective destruction ensures that research data cannot be extracted or reconstructed. Many document storage companies now offer onsite shredding and secure destruction of written and electronic media.\n\nFor electronic research data, the IRB advises researchers to contact either the College of Medicine Technology Services COMTS or Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) to assist with development of an adequate data destruction plan, as simply deleting the data files is insufficient.\n\nData Security\n\nResearch data management and security plans should ensure that hard copy and electronic research data are securely stored to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or loss. Hard copy records should be stored in a manner that limits access to authorized individuals. For example, filing cabinets/areas should be locked and placed in rooms that are routinely locked when not in use.\n\nElectronic research data should be stored on a device that has appropriate security safeguards, such as unique identification of authorized users, password protection, encryption, automated operating system patch (bug fix) management, anti-virus controls, firewall configuration, and scheduled and automatic backups to protect against research data loss or theft. If a researcher chooses to store directly identifiable private research data locally on the computer’s hard drive, that computer, whether a laptop or desktop, must be encrypted. The use of the network and servers maintained by the University is preferable to saving data on a local hard drive.\n\nLaptops, Smart Phones, Tablets, removable hard drives, “jump” or “thumb” or “flash” drives, CDs, DVDs, and other portable devices and removable media are convenient to ensure your research data are always at your fingertips. External hard drives are a cost effective and convenient way to back up your research data. These devices, however, require encryption solutions if they are used to store or transfer directly identifiable private information. This requirement may be waived depending upon the sensitivity of the data being collected. The IRB will make that determination.\n\nBecause email is not secure, directly identifiable private research data that will be transferred via email requires that the data file be encrypted prior to sending.\n\nThe IRB advises researchers to refer to the University Information Security Procedures Policy or to contact the appropriate technical support from either the College of Medicine Technology Services (COMTS) or Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) for assistance with development of an adequate research data protection protocol.\n\nData Analysis and IRB Approval\n\nPrimary Analysis\n\nPrimary analysis refers to how raw research data are chosen, evaluated, and interpreted into meaningful and significant conclusions. Once the primary research data analysis for a protocol is complete, the protocol should be closed with the IRB. Any subsequent analysis of the same research data, however, is usually considered secondary research data analysis.\n\nDuring analysis, when participants are typically no longer being enrolled, a researcher may apply for IRB approval to anonymize the research data by completing a continuing review application describing how identifiers will be removed. When the IRB approves a proposal to remove identifiers from remaining research data, IRB oversight of the study stops, and the researcher may continue to analyze the now anonymized research data.\n\nSecondary Analysis\n\nAny new, subsequent secondary analysis of existing human participant research data either requires: 1) IRB review and approval prior to access to or access to the research data; or 2) an IRB determination that its review is not necessary.\n\nThe IRB is responsible for determining whether 1) secondary analysis of research data increases risks to participants, and 2) participants were adequately informed during the original consent process about the possibility of secondary research use, maintenance of confidentiality, and destruction of identifiers. Based on these determinations the IRB may require the investigator to obtain informed consent from the participants for secondary analysis.\n\nUnless a dataset is deidentified, contains no direct identifiers and no code linked to identifiers, investigators who obtain research data from other researchers for secondary analysis should obtain IRB review and approval, or the IRB’s determination that the research does not require further IRB review, prior to obtaining the research data. The researcher providing the data may need to consult with his or her institution before sharing research data with local investigators.\n\nBack to Top\n\nRevised 10/5/2023\n\no Absent. Absent for discussion and voting for reasons other than a conflict of interest.\n\no Abstain. Present for the vote, but not voting “for” or “against”.\n\no Accrual. The number of subjects who have completed or are actively in the process of completing a study. This does not include screen failures. It does include withdrawals. Example: You enroll 100 to accrue 25.\n\no Administrative hold. A voluntary action initiated by the principal investigator whenever specific research activities, including subject enrollment, are placed temporarily on hold.\n\no Adverse event. An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product, such as a drug, device, or biologic, in a patient or research subject.\n\no Advocate. An individual who has the background and experience to act in, and agrees to act in, the best interest of the child for the duration of the child's participation in the clinical investigation.\n\no Agent. For purposes of this document, an institution's employees or agents refers to individuals who: (1) act on behalf of the institution; (2) exercise institutional authority or responsibility; or (3) perform institutionally designated activities. \"Employees and agents\" can include staff, students, contractors, and volunteers, among others, regardless of whether the individual is receiving compensation. A student's affiliation with an academic institution makes him or her an agent of that institution; and thus, the academic institution is engaged in the research regardless of where the research takes place.\n\no Allegation of noncompliance. An unproven assertion of noncompliance.\n\no Alternate member. Alternate Institutional Review Board (IRB) committee members may be designated, as needed, for regular voting members. The appointment of alternate members should be based on expertise similar to that of the regular voting member. An alternate member may vote only when the regular voting member is absent.\n\no Anonymous data. Information that was previously recorded or collected without any of the 18 identifiers as defined by HIPAA, and no code is assigned that would allow data to be traced to an individual.\n\no Assent. A child's affirmative agreement to participate in research. Mere failure to object should not, absent affirmative agreement, be construed as assent.\n\no Assured institution. An institution with a federal wide assurance (FWA) that has filed with the federal Office for Human Research Protections. Employees and agents of the institution holding an approved FWA are covered whenever they are involved in the conduct of the research covered by the FWA. Employees and agents are individuals performing institutionally designated activities and acting on behalf of the institution or exercising institutional authority or responsibility.\n\no Belmont Report. Report by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research identifying the basic ethical principles underlying the conduct of research involving human subjects, that is, respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.\n\no Beneficence. Persons are treated in an ethical manner not only by respecting their decisions and protecting them from harm, but also by making efforts to secure their well-being. Such treatment falls under the principle of beneficence. Two general rules have been formulated as expressions of beneficent actions (Belmont Report, 1978):\n\n1. Do no harm, and\n\n2. Maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms.\n\no Benign behavioral interventions. Interventions brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Examples:\n\no Requesting subjects play an online game\n\no Solve puzzles under various noise conditions\n\no Decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.\n\no Biologic product. A biological product (biologic) is a medical product. Many biologics are made from a variety of natural sources, such as humans, animals, or microorganisms. Like drugs, some biologics are intended to treat diseases and medical conditions. Other biologics are used to prevent or diagnose diseases. Examples of biological products include:\n\n1. Vaccines\n\n2. Blood and blood products for transfusion and or manufacturing into other products\n\n3. Allergenic extracts, which are used for both diagnosis and treatment, such as allergy shots\n\n4. Human cells and tissues used for transplantation, such as tendons, ligaments, and bone\n\n5. Gene therapies\n\n6. Cellular therapies\n\n7. Tests to screen potential blood donors for infectious agents, such as HIV\n\n8. In general, the term \"drugs\" includes therapeutic biological products\n\no Broad Consent. Broad consent is an option for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information and identifiable biospecimens. Not in use at UVM.\n\no Certification. Official notification by the institution to the supporting Federal department or agency component, that a research project or activity involving human subjects has been reviewed and approved by an IRB in accordance with an approved assurance.\n\no Children. People who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be conducted.\n\no Clinical investigation. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has defined clinical investigation to be synonymous with research. The FDA defines clinical investigation as any experiment that involves a test article and one or more human subjects, and that either must meet the requirements for prior submission to the FDA or the results of which are intended to be later submitted to, or held for inspection by, the FDA as part of an application for a research or marketing permit.\n\no Clinical Trial. Clinical trial means a research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes.\n\no Coded Data Set. Identifying information that would enable the investigator to readily ascertain the identity of the individual to whom the private information or specimens pertain has been replaced with a number, letter, symbol, or combination thereof and a key to decipher the code exists that would enable linkage of the identifying information to the data or biospecimens. Coded data sets are not considered “de-identified” when the “code” is the study subject number.\n\no Conflict of interest. Any interest that could reasonably be expected to affect the objectivity of an IRB member or consultant in relation to an application or other matter under IRB review. An IRB member or consultant has a conflict of interest if the individual:\n\n1. Is or will be an investigator or member of the research team (that is, listed on the IRB application)\n\n2. Has an immediate family member (that is, spouse, dependent children) or personal relationship with an individual who is one of the investigators\n\n3. Has a financial or managerial interest in a sponsoring entity or product being evaluated or provided by a commercial entity in the research, as defined by UVM/UVMMC policies\n\n4. Has received or will receive compensation with value (as defined by UVM/UVMMC policies) that may be affected by the outcome of the research project\n\n5. Has a proprietary interest in the research, such as a nonprovisional patent application, patent, trademark, copyright, or licensing agreement as defined by UVM/UVMMC policies\n\n6. Has a nonfinancial interest (personal circumstance, ethical belief, or other factor) that may be conflicting, for example, the IRB member has an interest that he or she believes conflicts with his or her ability to review a project objectively\n\n7. Has responsibility for institutional business development, such as raising funds or garnering support for research or as an officer within the Department of Development\n\no Consent capacity. An individual's ability to understand and process information relevant to making an informed, voluntary decision to participate in research. Several kinds of information are crucial to such decisions, including an understanding of the purpose of the study, its experimental nature, risks and anticipated benefits, the right to withdraw, alternatives to participation, confidentiality protections, and the safeguards used to minimize risks. A wide variety of diseases, disorders, conditions, situations, and injuries can affect a person's ability to understand such information, to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of participation in research, and to reach an informed decision regarding study participation.\n\no Consent document. A structured, written description in understandable terms of relevant research project information. The consent document is not consent itself; it is the record of what has been communicated to a potential participant. It is the document that ensures all regulatory elements are present and communicated to a potential participant. When signed by the potential participant, the consent document is a record of the receipt of research-related information by the participant. It also serves as reference material for the participant as the research project progresses. It is not a contract and is not legally binding, and the participant may choose to withdraw consent at any time.\n\no Consultant. A scientist or nonscientist from within or external to UVM/UVMMC who has special expertise to act — at the request of the IRB — as an ad hoc reviewer of a research project application. These individuals have access to all documents relevant to the specific project under review, may participate in the deliberations and make recommendations on the project, but may not vote and are not counted toward quorum.\n\no Continuing noncompliance. A pattern of noncompliance (recurring or ongoing) that in the judgement of the IRB, may indicate any of the following:\n\no an underlying deficiency in knowledge of the regulations or IRB requirements\n\no an unwillingness or inability to comply with the regulations that protect the rights and welfare of participants and others\n\no compromises the scientific integrity of a study such that important conclusions can no longer be reached\n\no suggests a likelihood that non-compliance will continue without intervention\n\no involves frequent instances of minor noncompliance\n\no failure to respond to inquiries from the IRB to resolve an open case of non-compliance or pattern of minor non-compliance.\n\no Continuing review. Periodic review of research activities at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once per year. The criteria for approval are defined by federal regulations. Unless the IRB determines otherwise, continuing review will no longer be required for: projects under expedited categories, projects requiring limited IRB review, or projects that have progressed to data analysis (including analysis of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens).\n\no Cooperative research project. Research projects that involve more than one institution as defined by federal regulations.\n\no Coordinating center. An institution, department or center that agrees to be responsible for the conduct and administrative or coordinating functions of a multicenter research project.\n\no Co-principal investigator (co-PI). UVM/UVMMC investigator who plays a key role in scientific development and conduct of the study. The co-PI collaborates with the principal investigator who has overall responsibility for study conduct. Conditions of eligibility for the role of co-PI are the same as for a PI.\n\no Covered entity. HIPAA regulations apply to health plans, health care clearinghouses and health care providers who transmit health information. Any individual creating or accessing protected health information (PHI) for the delivery of health care at UVM/UVMMC is within the covered entity.\n\no Custom device. Custom device means a device that:\n\n1. Necessarily deviates from devices generally available or from an applicable performance standard or premarket approval requirement in order to comply with the order of an individual physician or dentist.\n\n2. Is not generally available to, or generally used by, other physicians or dentists.\n\n3. Is not generally available in finished form for purchase or for dispensing upon prescription.\n\n4. Is not offered for commercial distribution through labeling or advertising; and\n\n5. Is intended for use by an individual patient named in the order of a physician or dentist and is to be made in a specific form for that patient or is intended to meet the special needs of the physician or dentist in the course of professional practice (such as a particular operating tool).\n\no Data Custodian. Individuals who will have actual possession of the data files or biospecimens, and who will be responsible for observance of all conditions of use, including the establishment and maintenance of security arrangements to prevent unauthorized use.\n\no Data Set. A dataset is a structured collection of data generally associated with a unique body of work.\n\no Data safety monitoring board (DSMB). A data safety monitoring board is an independent committee set up specifically to monitor data throughout the duration of a study to determine if continuation of the study is appropriate scientifically and ethically. Factors that suggest a DSMB is needed:\n\n1. A large study population and\n\n2. Multiple study sites. It is more difficult to recognize a pattern of increased or unusual problems or events when investigators treat small fractions of the population separately.\n\n3. Highly toxic therapies or dangerous procedures.\n\n4. High expected rates of morbidity or mortality in the study population.\n\n5. High chance of early termination of the study. DSMB membership is usually comprised of experts in the fields of medicine and science that are applicable to the study — statistical experts, lay representatives and others who can offer an unbiased assessment of the study progress.\n\no Data safety monitoring plan (DSMP). A DSMP is a quality-assurance plan for a research study. A data and safety monitoring plan (DSMP) is meant to ensure that each clinical investigation has a system for appropriate oversight and monitoring of the conduct of the clinical investigation. The purpose of a DSMP is to ensure the safety of the participants, the validity of the data and the integrity of the study, and the appropriate termination of studies for which significant benefits or risk has been uncovered or when it appears that the investigation cannot be concluded successfully. A DSMP is commensurate with the risks involved with the research study. The DSMP may include a data and safety monitoring board (DSMB).\n\no Data use agreement. An agreement into which UVM/UVMMC and the investigator enter with the intended recipient of a limited data set that establishes the ways in which the information in the limited data set may be used and how it will be protected.\n\no Dead fetus. A fetus that exhibits neither heartbeat, spontaneous respiratory activity, spontaneous movement of voluntary muscles nor pulsation of the umbilical cord.\n\no Deception. The action of intentionally misleading or providing incomplete disclosure to a research participant for research purposes. Providing that the research is otherwise minimal harm or harmless, the IRB will approve deception research as long as it has a sound debriefing process for the participant.\n\no De-identified health information. Health information that has been stripped of all 18 identifiers, related to the patient and the patient’s relatives, employers, and household members), as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (HIPAA), the releasing entity has no actual knowledge that the information could be used alone or in combination with other information to identify an individual who is a subject of the information. Importantly, in small populations (including small states such as Vermont), characters Data sets may also be de-identified within the meaning of HIPAA using an “expert determination,” however this method is unusual in the context of research.\n\no De-identified health information is not protected by HIPAA, and therefore is not subject to its regulations. However, UVM/UVMHN policy may still require appropriate data sharing agreements.\n\nThe 18 HIPAA identifiers\n\n1. Names\n\n2. All geographic subdivisions smaller than a state*\n\n3. Telephone numbers\n\n4. Fax numbers\n\n5. Email Addresses\n\n6. Social Security numbers\n\n7. Medical record numbers\n\n8. Health plan beneficiary numbers\n\n9. Account numbers\n\n10. Certificate/license numbers\n\n11. Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers\n\n12. Device identifiers and serial numbers\n\n13.

Full face photographic images and any comparable images\n\n17. All elements of dates (except year)**\n\n18. Any other unique identifying number, characteristic or code\n\n*including street address, city, county, precinct, zip code, and their equivalent geocodes, except for the initial three digits of a zip code, if according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: (1) The geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and (2) The initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000.\n\n**for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death; and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older.\n\no Delivery. Complete separation of the fetus from the woman by expulsion or extraction or any other means.\n\no Direct identifiers - An identifier that links to one specific person, can be used by itself to identify the person (e.g., name, social security number, medical record number, medical device number, email address, etc.).\n\no Disclosure of PHI. The release, transfer, or provision of access to, or divulging in any manner of, information outside the covered entity.\n\no Documentation. The act or an instance of furnishing or authenticating with documents.\n\no Emergency research. Planned research involving human subjects who have a life-threatening medical condition that necessitates urgent intervention (for which available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory), and who, because of their condition (such as traumatic brain injury) cannot provide informed consent.\n\no Emergency treatment IDE. A mechanism through the FDA for providing eligible participants with investigational devices for the treatment of an immediate serious or life-threatening illness for which there are no satisfactory alternatives.\n\no Emergency treatment IND. A mechanism through the FDA for providing eligible participants with investigational drugs, agents, or biologics for the treatment of an immediate serious or life-threatening illness for which there are no satisfactory alternatives.\n\no Emergency use. Use of a test article on a human subject in a life-threatening situation in which no standard acceptable treatment is available, and in which there is not sufficient time to obtain IRB approval [21 CFR 56.102(d)].\n\n1. Life-threatening includes both life-threatening and severely debilitating diseases or conditions where likelihood of death is high unless the course of the disease is interrupted, and diseases or conditions with potentially fatal outcomes, where the endpoint of clinical trial analysis is survival.\n\n2. The criteria for life-threatening do not require the condition to be immediately life-threatening or to immediately result in death. Rather, the subjects must be in a life-threatening situation requiring intervention before review at a convened IRB meeting is feasible.\n\n3. Severely debilitating: Diseases or conditions that cause major irreversible morbidity, such as blindness, loss of arm, leg, hand or foot, loss of hearing, paralysis, or stroke.\n\no Engagement of institutions in human subject research. An organization is considered engaged in human research when its employees or agents, for the purposes of the nonexempt research project, obtain:\n\n1. Data about the subjects of the research through intervention or interaction with them.\n\n2. Identifiable private information about the subjects of the research.\n\n3. The informed consent of human subjects for the research; or\n\n4. When the institution receives a direct federal award to conduct human subject research, even when all activities involving human subjects are carried out by a subcontractor (that is, employees or agents of another institution).\n\no Enrollment.

They may also be asked to sign the consent form. This definition contains four parts, all of which must be met. Here they are presented separately for emphasis and analysis:\n\n1. “Who is independent of the trial:” This could be a person who is a family member. It would not be a member of the site staff involved with the study.\n\n2. “Who cannot be unfairly influenced by people involved with the trial:” This would be a person free from potential coercion or undue influence or conflicted interest.\n\n3. “Who attends the informed consent process if the subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative cannot read:” This emphasizes the participation of the witness throughout the consent process, not just when the subject signs. A robust informed consent process will likely result, on the part of the person obtaining consent.\n\n4. “Who reads the informed consent form and any other written information that was supplied to the subject:” This responsibility has the witness confirming the subject was presented sufficient information to assure truly informed consent of the subject.\n\no Indirect identifiers.
