The Nuremberg Code, which came about as a result of the Nazi War Crimes Tribunal, was the first internationally recognized code of research ethics and provided the foundation for regulations to protect human research subjects in the United States. In recognition of the importance of informed consent, \"The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential\", was listed as the primary tenet of the Nuremberg Code.\n\nOn July 12, 1974, the National Research Act (Pub. L. 93-348) was signed into law, thereby creating the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. One of the charges to the Commission was to identify the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and to develop guidelines that should be followed to ensure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles. The Belmont Report attempts to summarize the basic ethical principles identified by the Commission in the course of its deliberations. It is a statement of basic ethical principles and guidelines that should assist in resolving the ethical problems that surround the conduct of research with human subjects.\n\nThree principles, or general prescriptive judgments, that are relevant to research involving human subjects are identified in this statement: respect of persons, beneficence and justice. Other principles may also be relevant. These three are comprehensive, however, and are stated at a level of generalization that should assist scientists, subjects, IRB reviewers and interested citizens in understanding the ethical issues inherent in research involving human subjects. These principles cannot always be applied so as to resolve beyond dispute particular ethical problems. The objective is to provide an analytical framework that will guide the resolution of ethical problems arising from research involving human subjects.\n\nInformed consent is one of the primary ethical requirements underpinning research with human subjects; it reflects the basic principle of respect for persons. It is too often forgotten that informed consent is an ongoing process, not a piece of paper or a discrete moment in time. Informed consent assures that prospective human subjects will understand the nature of the research and can knowledgeably and voluntarily decide whether or not to participate. This assurance protects all parties: both the subject, whose autonomy is respected, and the investigator, who otherwise faces legal hazards.\n\nDefinition\n\nInformed consent is a process that includes the presentation of information to the prospective subject, adequate opportunity for the subject to ask questions and have them answered, and documentation of the voluntary decision to participate. It is a fundamental mechanism to ensure respect for persons through provision of thoughtful consent for a voluntary act. The procedures used in obtaining informed consent should be designed to educate the subject population in terms that they can understand. Therefore, informed consent language and its documentation (especially explanation of the study's purpose, duration, experimental procedures, alternatives, risks, and benefits) must be written in \"lay language\", (i.e. understandable to the people being asked to participate). The written presentation of information is used to document the basis for consent and for the subjects' future reference. The consent document should be revised when deficiencies are noted or when additional information will improve the consent process.\n\nRequirements for informed consent are contained within Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46 (45 CFR 46), which is the primary federal statute pertaining to the protection of human subjects in research that is conducted using federal funds. Rutgers University maintains a Federalwide Assurance (FWA00003913) with the federal Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), which extends the federal regulations to all research conducted by individuals who are affiliated with the University, regardless of the source or lack of funding. The complete text of 45 CFR 46 [1] may be found online.\n\nDocumentation\n\nInformed consent shall be documented by the use of a written consent form that is approved by the IRB, and signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A copy shall be given to the person signing the form. The consent form has two purposes: (1) to provide adequate information to potential research subjects to allow them to make an informed choice as to their participation in a study, and (2) to document their decision to participate. Under certain very specific circumstances, (described later in this document), the IRB is authorized to waive the requirement for written documentation of informed consent, or approve a consent procedure that alters or waives some or all of the elements of informed consent.\n\nThe consent form may be either of the following:\n\n1. A written consent document that embodies the elements of informed consent required by 45 CFR 46.116.\n\nThis form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, but in any event, the investigator should give either the subject or the representative adequate opportunity to read it before it is signed.\n\n2. A short form written consent document, stating that the elements of informed consent required by 45 CFR 46.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.\n\nWhen this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Also, the IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the representative.\n\nOnly the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the representative.\n\nHowever, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary.\n\nA copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.\n\nPlease note that the Short Form Written Consent is rarely used. Instead, it is recommended that investigators wishing to present informed consent to subjects orally, request from the IRB a Waiver of the Documentation of Informed Consent --as explained later on below.\n\nGuidelines for Preparation of Consent Form or Oral Script\n\nIn order to make an informed choice, potential subjects must understand the study, how they are involved in the study, what kind of risks it poses to them, and who they can contact if a problem arises. This information must be presented to the subject by the principal investigator, and re-stated in the consent document.\n\nThe language used to describe these factors must be understandable to all potential subjects. To this end, the consent form should be written at a sixth-grade reading level, and all technical terms should be explained in lay language. Use of scientific jargon and legalese is not appropriate. Think of the document primarily as a teaching tool, not as a legal document.\n\nIt is recommended that the second person perspective (e.g., you, your child) be used. Use of the first person (e.g., \"I understand that ...\") can be interpreted as suggestive, may be relied upon as a substitute for sufficient factual information, and can constitute coercive influence over a subject. To this end, please do not use \"I\" or terms such as \"I understand\" in the consent form.\n\nFor consent forms containing more than one page: it is recommended that a notation with the title of the study and the name of the investigator be added to the top of each page (except the first).\n\nIf non-English speaking subjects will be involved, a consent form that has been translated into the relevant language is required. Provide a description of the credentials of the person responsible for the translation. This person can be a native speaker and does not need to be a certified translator, so long as they are clearly proficient in the native language of the subjects.\n\nIf the protocol involves videotaping, audiotaping, or photographing of subjects, the consent form must include either a separate statement of agreement for these procedures within the consent document, with signature line, or an addendum to the consent form describing the recording procedure with a statement of agreement and signature line. The purpose of the distinct signature for these procedures is to ensure that the subject is aware of their inclusion, and if the study design permits, to allow the subject to participate in the study without being recorded.\n\nExculpatory language (i.e., that which waives or appears to waive any legal rights of subjects) is prohibited. Subjects should not be given the impression that they have agreed to or are without recourse to seek satisfaction beyond the institution's voluntarily chosen limits.\n\nThe consent form is to be read and signed by each subject who participates in the study before they begin participation in the study. Signature lines for the Principal Investigator and the subject, with corresponding lines for the date of each signature, are required. Signature lines for a legally authorized representative or minor subject may also be necessary, depending upon the type of subject population that is involved. A witness signature is not required in most cases; exceptions are oral consent verification (below) and situations in which a legally authorized representative signs for the subject.\n\nRequired Basic Elements of Informed Consent (8)\n\nUnless specifically waived by the IRB, each of the following elements must be included in each consent form:\n\nA statement that the study involves research. For example, \"You are invited to participate in a research study\" or \"I will be conducting a research study.\"\n\nAn explanation of the purposes of the research. For example, \"The purpose of this research project is (state the purpose)\" or \"We invite you to participate in a clinical research study that is designed to help us understand (describe the theory, disease, or condition).\"\n\nThe expected duration of the subject's participation. State the number of sessions in which the subject will be involved, the amount of time required of the subject per session, and the time period over which the session will be held. For example, \"Your participation in this study will last for about 6 months, and include two 15-minute sessions per month\" or \"You will take part in two interviews that will be scheduled two weeks apart, and each will last about 30 minutes.\"\n\nA description of the procedures to be followed. List all procedures, preferably in chronological order, which will be employed in the study. For example, \"Participation in this study will involve the following:\" or \"Your child will be asked four questions about the months of the year. This activity will take place during regular classroom time, when the other children are doing work at their desks. Positive feedback will be given to each child regardless of the complexity of their answers.\" If the procedures are extensive, numbered items may be helpful.\n\nIdentification of any procedures which are experimental. For example, a new drug, extra tests, separate research records, or nonstandard means of management, such as flipping a coin for random assignment to a treatment regimen. In treatment protocols, routine medical care which is not part of the research should not be included.\n\nA description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject. Inform the subject of potential harms, discomforts, inconveniences and risks that are associated with the research activity, and any measures which will be used to minimize them. For example, \"Use of Drug X has been known to cause the following side effects:\" or \"The primary risks are possible embarrassment from answering personal questions, and breach of confidentiality\". When there is a lengthy list of potential side effects, they should be subdivided into groups such as \"more likely to occur\" or \"not likely to occur.\"\n\nAn description of who to contact for both information about the research and rights that a subject has a research participant. The subject needs to be provided with the contact information of the principal investigator if they have any questions regarding the research, as well as the telephone number for the IRB and e-mail.\n\nA statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, and the subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled.\n\nAdditional Elements of Informed Consent\n\nWhen determined to be appropriate by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), subjects must be provided with one or more of the following additional elements of information during the informed consent process (see 45 CFR 46.116(b) [3]):\n\na statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involve risks to the subject (or to the embryo or fetus, if the subject is or may become pregnant) which are currently unforeseeable;\n\nanticipated circumstances under which the subject’s participation may be terminated by the investigator without regard to the subject’s consent;\n\nany additional costs to the subject that may result from participation in the research;\n\nthe consequences of a subject’s decision to withdraw from the research and procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject;\n\na statement that significant new findings developed during the course of the research which may relate to the subject’s willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject; and\n\nthe approximate number of subjects involved in the study.\n\nIt is up to the IRB to determine in a particular instance whether some or all of the above additional elements must be included as part of the informed consent process for a particular study. The IRB should make this determination based on the nature of the research and its knowledge of the local research context. If the IRB determines that additional elements are appropriate to the research study, this additional information should be considered just as essential as the eight basic elements of informed consent described in the HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.116(a) [3].\n\nFurthermore, an IRB may require that additional information beyond the basic [4] and additional elements be given to subjects during the informed consent process, when in the IRB’s judgment the additional information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and welfare of the subjects 45 CFR 46.109(b) [5]).\n\nSubject Risk\n\nStudies that involve only surveys, interviews, or focus groups may not pose physical risks to subjects, but often present other types of risk, and these must be listed. Plans for referral for counseling, if needed, should be included.\n\nFor example, \"If you require counseling after your participation in this study, you will be referred to (facility name). This service (is free) or (will be billed to your health insurance carrier). The counseling center can be reached at: telephone of counseling service.\"\n\nIf additional risks are identified during the course of the research, the consent process and documentation will require revisions to inform subjects as they are re-contacted or newly contacted.\n\nRisks may be:\n\nPhysical - pain, physical discomfort, injury, illness or disease brought about by the methods and procedures of the research;\n\nPsychological - anxiety, fear, stress, confusion, embarrassment, depression, guilt, shock, loss of self-esteem, and/or altered behavior, occurring during the research situation or later, as a result of participation;\n\nSocial - alterations in relationships with others that are to the disadvantage of the subject, including embarrassment, loss of respect of others, labeling with negative consequences, or diminishing the subject's opportunities and status in relation to others;\n\nEconomic - cost to subjects for procedures, loss of wages or income, damage to employability;\n\nLegal - risk of criminal prosecution or civil lawsuit when research methods reveal that the subject has or will engage in conduct for which the subject or others may be criminally liable;\n\nLoss of confidentiality - confidentiality is presumed and must be maintained unless the investigator obtains the express permission of the subject to do otherwise. Risks include invasion of privacy, as well as the social, economic, and legal risks outlined above.\n\nThese other elements of informed consent may also be required by the IRB, and investigators are encouraged to include them during the informed consent process and document:\n\nA description of any benefits to the subject or to others which may reasonably be expected from the research. Describe direct benefits to the subject that may reasonably be expected. Do not promise any benefits which do not exist or are speculative. If the subject will not benefit directly, indicate how society or medical science may benefit. For example, \"Participation in this study may not benefit you directly. However, the knowledge that we obtain from your participation, and the participation of other volunteers, may help us to better understand.....\" or \"You may benefit from participation by gaining insight into your students' learning styles.\"\n\nA disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. If there are no alternative treatments, then this should be stated. All alternatives to participation should be listed, including standard therapy, if applicable. For example, \"You may choose not to participate in this study and instead receive routine treatment and care, as there are no other treatment options available at this time\" or \"An alternative to participation in this research project may be to participate in other research studies for which you may receive the same research credit. Consult your instructor for options.\"\n\nA statement describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained. Some studies require disclosure of information to other parties. Others inherently are in need of a Certificate of Confidentiality which protects the investigator from involuntary release (e.g.,subpoena) of the names or other identifying characteristics of research subjects. If a Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained by the investigator to provide protection from involuntary release of the subject names or other identifying information, this should be indicated. Information regarding the procedure to obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality may be obtained from the IRB office or NIH via the web at: <http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/policy/coc [6]>.\n\nIf the data collected contain no identifying information that could link the data to the subject, then \"confidential\" should be replaced by \"anonymous\" in this section.\n\nDefinition of Anonymous: Data are recorded such that no identifier whatsoever exists to link a subject's identity to that subject's response. Examples: (1) subject fills out and mails back to the investigator a questionnaire that does not provide subject's name, social security number, phone number, or any other identifier; (2) investigator interviews subject by phone and notes responses, but does not have any record connecting any response to any phone number.\n\nDefinition of Confidential: There exists a documented linkage between a subject's identity and his/her response in the research, and the investigator provides assurance in the protocol and in the informed consent form that the identity of any individual subject will not be revealed in any report of the study. Example: a subject's data record is assigned a code, and a \"master list\" that links the code to the subject's identity is maintained in a secure location.\n\nSample text: \"The information in the study records will be kept strictly confidential. Data will be stored securely in a locked cabinet and/or restricted-access computer and will be made available only to persons conducting the study unless you specifically give permission in writing to do otherwise. No reference will be made in oral or written reports which could link you to the study.\"\n\nThe IRB will determine the level of adequate requirements for confidentiality in light of its mandate to ensure minimization of risk.\n\nFor research involving more than minimal risk, an explanation as to whether any compensation is available, and an explanation as to whether any medical treatments are available if injury occurs and, if so, what they consist of, or where further information may be obtained. State precise amounts of financial compensation, if applicable, and explain the pro-rating scheme of payment that will apply if the subject withdraws before completing the study. For example, \"For participating in this study you will receive (describe compensation). Other ways to earn the same amount of credit are (describe options here). If you withdraw from the study prior to its completion, you will receive (describe partial compensation system)\" or \"If you are harmed by being in this study, we will provide or arrange care as needed. Payment will be your responsibility, or that of your health insurance carrier (or Medicaid, etc.).\"\n\nAn explanation of whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions about the research and research subjects' rights, and whom to contact in the event of a research-related injury to the subject. Two statements are required: contact information for the investigator, and contact information for the IRB. For example, \"Any questions about this study should be directed to the principal investigator at (phone number) (Note: email address is optional)\" and \"If you have any questions about your rights as a research subject, you may contact the IRB at Rutgers by phone (732) 235-9806, Email us or write us at 335 George Street, Liberty Plaza Suite 3200, New Brunswick, NJ 08901.\"\n\nA statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, and the subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits, to which the subject is otherwise entitled. For example, \"Your child's participation in this study is completely voluntary and you may withdraw your child at any time without prejudicing your child's present or future care\" or \"Your participation in this research is voluntary. You may refuse to answer any questions with which you are not comfortable, and you may withdraw from the study at any time without penalty.\"\n\nSpecial Requirements of 45 CFR 46 Subpart D - Additional DHHS Protections for Children Involved as Subjects in Research\n\nAssent of Children\n\nAssent is defined as, \" A child's affirmative agreement to participate in research. Mere failure to object should not be construed as assent [45 CFR 46.402(b [7])]\". While children may be legally incapable of giving informed consent, they nevertheless may possess the ability to assent to or dissent from participation. Out of respect for children as developing persons, children should be asked whether or not they wish to participate in the research, particularly if the research: (1) does not involve interventions likely to be of benefit to the subjects; and (2) the children can comprehend and appreciate what it means to be a volunteer for the benefit of others. The IRB must determine for each protocol - depending on such factors as the nature of the research and the age, status, and condition of the proposed subjects - whether all or some of the children are capable of assenting to participation. Where appropriate, IRB’s may choose to review on a case-by-case basis whether assent should be sought from given individual subjects.\n\nThere is no required format for assent, the text of which must be submitted to the IRB with the protocol for review. It must, however, be age appropriate, offer an explanation of the study, and provide the child with the opportunity to agree to participate or refuse participation. Written documents, as well as oral scripts, are acceptable. The child may be asked to sign a document or agree verbally; in cases where verbal assent is obtained, the investigator must document the assent. (I.e., the format and content of an assent statement is highly variable, but must be tailored to the particular child or children involved.)\n\nEven where the IRB determines that the subjects are capable of assenting, the IRB may still waive the assent requirement under circumstances, in which consent may be waived in accord with 45 CFR 46.116 of Subpart A (waiver requirements described earlier in this document). Note: See the Consent Form Waivers [8] Section for more information.\n\nIf the IRB determines that the capability of some or all of the children is so limited that they cannot reasonably be consulted, or that the intervention or procedure involved in the research holds out a prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health or well-being of the children, and is available only in the context of the research, the assent of the children is not a necessary condition for proceeding with the research (i.e., assent may be waived if the children are not cognitively able to understand the concept of participating in a particular study, or if participation is likely to benefit the child, and the benefit can only be obtained by participation).\n\nIn determining whether children are capable of assenting, the IRB must take into account the ages, maturity, and psychological state of the children involved. This judgement may be made for all children to be involved in research under a particular protocol, or for each child, as the IRB deems appropriate (i.e., in some cases, all children who participate in a particular study may be capable of providing assent, and in other cases, only some of the children may be capable; the IRB may leave this judgement up to the investigator and is not obligated to require that ALL of the children in a study must or must not agree to participate).\n\nThe IRB must determine that adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent (agreement) of the children, when in the judgment of the IRB the children are capable of providing assent. Assent is usually required in addition to parental permission; in rare cases, the requirement for parental permission may be waived (see Section 2, item d. in the Parental Permission section below).\n\nChildren are defined as persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be conducted (usually state law, which may vary according to the child's situation, e.g., emancipated minor).\n\nParental Permission\n\nPermission from one or more parents is required when a minor is involved in research. Assent (agreement) from the child may or may not be required, depending upon the study and characteristics of the child (see Assent of Children section above). Under very specific circumstances, the requirement for parental permission may be waived by the IRB (see below). Otherwise, the information below describes the circumstances under which the permission of either one or both parents is required. If you cannot make a determination after reading each section, please contact an IRB Administrator for guidance.\n\nThe permission of one parent is sufficient for research in which: no greater than minimal risk to children is presented;\n\nIf more than minimal risk to children is presented by an intervention or procedure that holds out the prospect of direct benefit for the individual subject, or by a monitoring procedure that is likely to contribute to the subject's well-being. The following conditions apply:\n\n(a) the risk must be justified by the anticipated benefit to the subjects;\n\n(b) the relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk must be at least as favorable to the subjects as that presented by available alternative approaches; and\n\n(c) adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children and permission of their parents or guardians.\n\nBoth parents must give their permission, unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child, for research in which:\n\nmore than minimal risk to children is presented by an intervention or procedure that does not hold out the prospect of direct benefit for the individual subject, or by a monitoring procedure which is not likely to contribute to the well-being of the subject. ALL of the following conditions apply:\n\n(a) the risk represents a minor increase over minimal risk;\n\n(b) the intervention or procedure presents experiences to subjects that are reasonably commensurate with those inherent in their actual or expected medical, dental, psychological, social, or educational situations;\n\n(c) the intervention or procedure is likely to yield generalizable knowledge about the subjects' disorder or condition which is of vital importance for the understanding or amelioration of the subjects' disorder or condition; and\n\n(d) adequate provisions are made for soliciting assent of the children and permission of their parents or guardians.\n\nBoth parents must give their permission, unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child, for research that is:\n\nNot otherwise approvable (i.e., not included in categories a. or b. described above) which presents an opportunity to understand, prevent, or alleviate a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children. The following conditions apply:\n\n(a) the research must present a reasonable opportunity to further the understanding, prevention, or alleviation of a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children; and\n\n(b) if the project is funded by DHHS, the DHHS Secretary, after consultation with a panel of experts in pertinent disciplines (for example: science, medicine, education, ethics, law) and following opportunity for public review and comment, must determine either:\n\n(1) that the research in fact satisfies the conditions of categories a. or b. previously described; or\n\n(2) the following:\n\n(i) the research presents a reasonable opportunity to further the understanding, prevention, or alleviation of a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children;\n\n(ii) the research will be conducted in accordance with sound ethical principles;\n\n(iii) adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of children and the permission of their parents or guardians, as set forth in 45 CFR 46.408.\n\nIf the project is not funded by DHHS, the IRB must determine that the conditions set forth in (2) are satisfied.\n\nIf the IRB determines that a research protocol is designed for conditions or for a subject population for which parental or guardian permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the subjects (for example, neglected or abused children), it may waive the consent requirements as previously described, provided an appropriate mechanism for protecting the children who will participate as subjects in the research is substituted, and provided further that the waiver is not inconsistent with Federal, state or local law.\n\nAdditional Vunerabilities Which Affect the Informed Consent Process\n\nIf your project includes one or more of the following additional vunerabilities, then the following information may apply:\n\nWards of the State (i.e. Foster Children)\n\nChildren who are wards of the State or any other agency, institution, or entity can be included in research described in categories b. and c. under \"Parental Permission\" only if such research is:\n\n(1) related to their status as wards; or\n\n(2) conducted in schools, camps, hospitals, institutions, or similar settings in which the majority of children involved as subjects are not wards.\n\nIf the research is approved under paragraph (a) of this section, the IRB shall require appointment of an advocate for each child who is a ward, in addition to any other individual acting on behalf of the child as guardian or in loco parentis. One individual may serve as advocate for more than one child. The advocate shall be an individual who has the background and experience to act in, and agrees to act in, the best interests of the child for the duration of the child's participation in the research and who is not associated in any way (except in the role as advocate or member of the IRB) with the research, the investigator(s), or the guardian organization.\n\nCognitively Impaired Individuals\n\nConsent to research involving cognitively impaired subjects through any of the intramural programs of the National Institutes of Health (e.g., the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism) is guided by NIH policy on consent to research with impaired human subjects. This policy sets out, in matrix form, conditions under which cognitively impaired subjects may participate in research of varying risk.\n\nAs a general rule, all adults, regardless of their diagnosis or condition, should be presumed competent to consent unless there is evidence of serious mental disability that would impair reasoning or judgment. Even those who do have a diagnosed mental disorder may be perfectly able to understand the matter of being a research volunteer, and quite capable of consenting to or refusing participation. Mental disability alone should not disqualify a person from consenting to participate in research; rather, there should be specific evidence of individuals' incapacity to understand and to make a choice before they are deemed unable to consent.\n\nPersons formally adjudged incompetent have a court-appointed guardian who must be consulted and consent on their behalf. Officials of the institution in which incompetent patients reside (even if they are the patient's legal guardians) are not generally considered appropriate, since their supervisory duties may give rise to conflicting interests and loyalties. Family members or others financially responsible for the patient may also be subject to conflicting interests because of financial pressures, emotional distancing, or other ambivalent feelings common in such circumstances. IRBs (and investigators)should bear this in mind when determining appropriate consent procedures for cognitively impaired subjects.\n\nProcedures can sometimes be developed to enhance the possibility that subjects can consent for themselves. Criteria for determining competence might vary according to the degree of risk or discomfort presented by the research procedures and the extent to which therapeutic gains can be anticipated. The setting in which consent is sought and the person seeking it can also influence a potential subject's ability to comprehend or appreciate what is being asked. An uncomfortable chair, a room that is either too noisy or lacking in privacy, or a physician the patient dislikes may all create anxiety or resistance that would not exist if the information were presented by another person, at another time, or in another place. The National Commission recommended that, in certain cases, a consent auditor be appointed by the IRB to determine whether proposed subjects consent, assent, or object to their participation in research, especially if the research involves more than minimal risk and no foreseeable direct benefit.\n\nConsent documents for individuals who are determined to be incompetent to consent must contain a signature line for a legally authorized representative, in addition to the elements of informed consent described earlier in this document. The subject may also be asked to provide assent, if it is determined that they are capable of doing so. A sample certification statement that may be included in consent forms intended for legally authorized representatives of subjects who are cognitively impaired follows: \"As the legally authorized representative, your signature authorizes the participation of (name of subject) in this research study, which has been explained to you. The investigator has offered you the opportunity to ask questions, and they have been satisfactorily answered.\"\n\nPregnant Women, Human Fetuses and Neonates\n\nUnder the terms of 45 CFR 46, Subpart B, Pregnant Women, Human Fetuses and Neonates are considered to be members of a vulnerable population and therefore entitled to special protections if they participate in research activities. Subpart B defines both the types of permissible research with Pregnant Women, Human Fetuses and Neonates, and the safeguards that must be followed.\n\nFor additional information, review the regulations at: Subpart B: Additional Protections for Pregnant Women, Human Fetuses and Neonates Involved in Research [10].\n\nPrisoners\n\nUnder the terms of 45 CFR 46, Subpart C, prisoners are considered to be members of a vulnerable population and therefore entitled to special protections if they participate in research activities. Subpart C defines both the types of permissible research with prisoners, and the safeguards that must be followed.\n\nFor additional information, review the regulations at: Subpart C: Additional Protections Pertaining to Biomedical and Behavioral Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects. [11]\n\nInformed Consent in Studies that Include Deception\n\nSome behavioral research is designed to deceive the subjects about the true purpose of the study because the subjects' behavior would be altered if they knew the real objectives, and the data would then be inaccurate. Whenever possible, deception should be avoided to minimize the potential negative effects that may result as a consequence: guilt, embarrassment, psychological stress. However, when the research will not have scientific validity without the use of deception, the investigator and the IRB must carefully consider whether the human subjects that will be involved are adequately protected.\n\nThe proposed subject population must be suitable for the purposes of the study (i.e., an IRB may find that individuals with diminished mental capacity or those with paranoid tendencies may not be suitable subjects for a protocol that involves deception, whereas the same study may be approved if a subject population that has normal mental capacity and no history of mental illness is used).\n\nIf a study involves deception, than it may be proposed that the subject not be fully informed when they agree to participate in the study. They may be told that the actual objectives of the study will not be known to them until after their participation has ended, or they may be intentionally mislead about the intent of the research. The IRB must decide whether the study is so designed that the subjects will be adequately protected without having given informed consent, and if a waiver of some or all of the elements of informed consent can be approved. According to the regulations, research should not be permitted at all if the risk to subjects is more than minimal and the subjects are not being informed of things they would consider material to a decision to participate. In deciding whether to waive or alter consent requirements, IRBs must consider the risks to which subjects will be exposed. To receive a waiver of consent requirements, the study must present no more than minimal risk. Further, the waiver must not adversely affect the rights and welfare of subjects, and must be essential to the ability to carry out the research. A final condition for waiving some or all of the elements of informed consent is that, whenever appropriate, subjects will be given additional pertinent information after they have participated in such a study. The IRB must decide if subjects should be debriefed either after participating in research unwittingly or after knowingly participating in research that involved some form of deception.\n\nA debriefing statement that informs the subjects of the true nature of the study is required for most studies that involve deception. However, there are some instances in which debriefing may cause more harm than good, and is therefore not recommended (e.g., if the study results would provide subjects with information that is disturbing about themselves). Debriefing is appropriate if it contributes to the subject's welfare, e.g., by reducing stress or correcting misconceptions about themselves that resulted from participation in the study. After debriefing, the subject must be given the opportunity to confirm or rescind their consent. In essence, this is the actual informed consent for the subject's participation in the study, and should be prepared, presented and documented in accordance with the guidelines for informed consent.\n\nWaiver of Informed Consent Documentation\n\nAn IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects.\n\nIMPORTANT: A Waiver of Consent Documentation is not a waiver to skip the whole consent process!!!\n\nPlease visit the Waiver of Informed Consent Guidance Topic [12] for more information.\n\nOral History Projects and Informed Consent\n\nIf the archived data will be made publicly available then the research must be prospectively reviewed and approved by the Rutgers IRB before the research project begins. The IRB requires that the researcher make provisions for obtaining informed consent from all participants and document the process. Participants in oral history projects should be allowed to review the material prior to public archive and decide if they wish any or all of the oral history archived.\n\nInformed Consent Form Stamps\n\nIRB Stamps on Consent Forms\n\nIRB policy requires that approved consent forms, advertisements, recruitment notices, etc. provided to subjects display one of the following:\n\nThe IRB Approval stamp, indicating the date of approval and expiration for the protocol, OR;\n\nThe following statement: \"This informed consent form [substitute advertisement or applicable term] and research protocol was approved by the Rutgers Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects on [Date of approval], and expires on [date of expiry].\"\n\nSample Templates are provided by the IRB via the Human Subjects Protection Program Toolkit.\n\nOHRP Informed Consent Checklist: https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/checklists/index.html [14]\n\nOHRP Informed Consent Tips: https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/informed-consent-tips/index.html [15]\n\nOHRP Informed Consent FAQs: https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/faq/informed-consent/index.html [16]\n\nReferences\n\nOPRR IRB Guidebook, 1993, Robin Levin Penslar, J.D., principal author and editor: http://ohrp.osophs.dhhs.gov/irb/irb_guidebook.htm [17]\n\nFor FDA Regulated Research\n\nObtaining the informed consent of individuals before involving them in research is a central protection afforded by federal regulation and a key ethical expression of respect for persons. Among other things, the consent process should ensure that investigators provide adequate information about the research, communicate it in a way that is easy for the individual to understand, and discuss the research in a context that ensures a subject's decision to participate is voluntary.\n\nFederal regulations require certain informational elements to be present in consent documents to facilitate ‘informed consent’ in various circumstances (i.e., adult consent, assent of a minor, surrogate consent for the decisionally-impaired, consent of non-English speaking persons, etc.). You may adopt the template language or use it to guide the development of a custom consent that best suits your research needs and effectively communicates to the potential population you ask to participate in your research.\n\nPlease note that other HRPP Guidance we list may also link to sample consent templates for use. For example, the Research Tissue/Data Banks, we offer a main consent template for the development of a registry or repository and an addendum consent template for a secondary study.\n\nElements of Informed Consent\n\nWritten informed consent for research must have these elements.\n\nA statement that the study involves research, an explanation of the purposes of the research and the expected duration of subject's participation, a description of what procedures will be followed, and which ones are experimental;\n\nA description of any foreseeable risks or discomforts;\n\nA description of benefits to the subject or others who may benefit;\n\nDisclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or treatments that may be advantageous to the subject;\n\nA statement describing the extent of confidentiality of records identifying the subject;\n\nResearch involving more than minimal risk must include explanations regarding\n\nWhether any compensation is available for participation\n\nWhether medical treatments are available for injuries, and if so, a description of them or where more information is available;\n\nWhom to contact for answers to questions about the research; answers to questions about subject's rights; if a research-related injury occurs;\n\nA statement that participation is voluntary, that refusal to participate will not penalize the subject, and consent to participate can be withdrawn at any time.\n\nAdditional Elements of Informed Consent - When Appropriate:\n\nA statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involve risks to the subject (or to the embryo or fetus, if the subject is or may become pregnant) which are current unforeseeable;\n\nAnticipated circumstances under which the subject's participation may be terminated by the investigator without regard to the subject's consent;\n\nAny additional costs to the subject that may result from participation in the research;\n\nThe consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the research and procedures for orderly termination of participation by the subject;\n\nA statement that significant new findings developed during the course of the research which may relate to the subject's willingness to continue participation will be provided to the subject; and\n\nThe approximate number of subjects involved in the study.\n\nSTEM CELL RESEARCH\n\nGUIDELINES FOR RESEARCH USING HUMAN PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS\n\nInformed Consent for the use of Pluripotent Stem Cells should include:\n\nA statement that the embryos will be used to derive human pluripotent stem cells for research that may include human transplantation research;\n\nA statement that the donation is made without any restriction or direction regarding the individual(s) who may be the recipient(s) of transplantation of the cells derived from the embryo;\n\nA statement as to whether or not information that could identify the donors of the embryos, directly or through identifiers linked to the donors, will be removed prior to the derivation or the use of human pluripotent stem cells;\n\nA statement that derived cells and/or cell lines may be kept for many years;\n\nDisclosure of the possibility that the results of research on the human pluripotent stem cells may have commercial potential, and a statement that the donor will not receive financial or any other benefits from any such future commercial development.\n\nA statement that the research is not intended to provide direct medical benefit to the donor; and\n\nA statement that embryos donated will not be transferred to a woman’s uterus and will not survive the human pluripotent stem cell derivation process.\n\nRegulations\n\nU.S. FDA Regulations CFR Title 21 Part 50: Protection of Human Subjects, Informed Consent\n\nHelp\n\nIf you have additional questions about how to create consent documents based on our templates, please contact your local IRB Office.\n\nResearch Involving International Sites\n\nIRB review of international research raises additional considerations related to obtaining local knowledge of applicable laws, institutional commitments and regulations, standards of professional conduct and practice, cultural norms, and local community attitudes. Physical, social, and psychological risks may vary from those in the local community surrounding Rutgers University. Assessing the risks and benefits of research conducted internationally may raise challenges if there is not adequate knowledge of the local setting or population to be included. Care must be taken to ensure that the cultural norms of the host country are respected and that the participants will not suffer adverse consequences from participation, such as being subjected to retaliation from local authorities or the local community.\n\nResearch projects that take place outside the United States require compliance with RU policies and the relevant laws of the host country. International research must also comply with 45 CFR 46 or equivalent standards, such as the 2016 Council of International Organization of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related Research Involving Human Subjects, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) standards, the 2018 Medical Research Council of Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (Canadian Institutes of Health Research), and/or the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), when applicable. [See Toolkit item HRP-103a – SOP: Investigator Manual – All Appendices]\n\nIt is important for researchers to provide information to address these considerations and for the IRB to gain sufficient knowledge of the research locale to accurately assess the risks and benefits of participation and to provide appropriate protections to subjects. In addition to the protocol, sample consent(s), and related study materials, submit also to the IRB with your application completed form HRP-285 – International Research for Expedited/Full Board Studies or HRP-286 – International Research for Exempt Studies, as applicable. In addition to the protocol, this form offers the investigator a place to provide additional information that is required to be submitted by the IRB about the international setting, qualifications of the research team to conduct research in the proposed international setting, and much more. The IRB will consider the following bulleted items, in addition to, the regular review requirements as described in HRPP SOPs.\n\nIRB Review of International Research\n\nAddressing the Needs, Issues, or Benefits of the Local Community\n\nThe research protocol should generally be designed to address issues characteristic of the local setting, or conditions that affect the local setting, particularly in developing countries. If the research is greater than minimal risk, then the research should be designed to provide a potential benefit to the subjects and/or to the local community. If a research study is not designed accordingly, the investigator should provide satisfactory justification as to why the study is proposed to be conducted in the given setting(s).\n\nb. Local Context - In an effort to gain knowledge of the local setting, the IRB will consider the most appropriate means of obtaining this information. The type of research, level of risk, study population, location of the research and whether collaborative efforts are involved are all factors that will affect the means of obtaining the knowledge of the local setting.\n\nFor all international research studies that are greater than minimal risk, researchers must provide details of the local context within the protocol to provide a basis for the IRB review.\n\nThe IRB may obtain local knowledge from literature, documentation, or available written information, or by the inclusion of a consultant knowledgeable of the local setting. For a review of minimal risk studies, obtaining knowledge of the local setting by these means may be adequate.\n\nFor greater than minimal risk studies, consideration should be given to enhance the local knowledge by obtaining review and approval from an ethical review committee that is local to the study site or has particular knowledge of the local setting. One source for the identification of potential international ethical review committees or IRBs is the list of IRBs registered with ORHP at International Compilation of Human Research Standards | HHS.gov.\n\nInvestigators should recognize that international ethical review committees which are affiliated with an institution may not be willing to review research conducted by investigators outside their institution. Access to local ethical review committees may be facilitated when researchers collaborate with researchers at the local institution.\n\nThe local ethical review committee or IRB should comply with the IRB composition requirements of 45 CFR 46.107 or 21 CFR 56.107, as applicable. In order to increase efficiency, review and approval by the local ethics committee or IRB should usually be obtained after review by the RU IRB or designated IRB on the FWA.\n\nIf a review by a local human research ethics committee cannot be obtained for greater than minimal risk research, the IRB review will include consultation by an expert who is independent of the research team and is familiar with the local site’s culture and norms. The research team may refer such an individual to participate in the review by the convened RU IRB.\n\nc. Informed Consent - Obtaining informed consent in accordance with 45 CFR 46 and 21 CFR 50 in certain international settings may raise challenges due to a difference in the norms of the host country. The process for obtaining and documenting informed consent must comply with U.S. regulations and with RU policy.\n\nIf the legal age of an adult differs in another country from state law (e.g., 18 years of age), the IRB should accept the local age of majority when considering who may provide their own consent.\n\nd. Translation - When consent and recruitment documents have already been translated into a language other than English, the researcher should provide a copy of the document in English, a copy in the language to be used in the foreign location, and certification from an appropriate individual that the translated version of the document is complete and does not contain information that is not presented within the context of the approved English version of the document.\n\nWhen the RU IRB-approved informed consent document in the local language is reviewed by an international IRB or ethics committee, the local approved consent document should be back-translated into English by an appropriate individual who will certify that the resulting English version and the local consent document are consistent in content, style, and level of readability. [See GUIDANCE: Non-English Speaking Subjects for further information about enrolling subjects who speak a language other than English.]\n\ne. Approval by the Institution Where the Research Will be Conducted\n\nWhen the research will be conducted in an institution or organization such as a school, business, or hospital that is not otherwise involved in the research, a letter(s) of the agreement should be submitted from the appropriate official(s) (e.g., government officials, school officials, community officials, chief executive officers, etc.) indicating that the research protocol, and any and all instruments to be used, have been reviewed and that the study is acceptable to be conducted in the institution or organization. The letter of agreement must be on letterhead stationery and carry an original signature, or otherwise meet acceptable professional standards for a signed document.\n\nf. Plan for Oversight of the Research\n\nThe research study should provide a plan for oversight of the research that will be conducted in an international setting, particularly when the RU research staff will not be present at the foreign site.\n\ng. Plan for the Collection and Transmission/Transport of Research Data or Biological Samples - The research study should provide a plan for data collection, protecting the confidentiality of the data, and transport of the data back to RU, or elsewhere in the U.S. or another region.\n\n1. If data will be collected by an individual(s) other than those on the RU research team, that (those) individual(s) must be identified, and letters of agreement to protect confidentiality should be presented to the IRB. If the non-RU researcher(s) will have access to the data for research purposes, the extent of the access should be specified.\n\n2. Methods for assuring anonymity and/or confidentiality of all data must be specified, particularly if the analysis will occur away from RU.\n\n3. Processes for transporting data from the international location to RU, with particular reference to protecting the confidentiality of the data while in transit, must be addressed.\n\n4. If personal health information with identifiers will be transmitted to the U.S., HIPAA requirements must be addressed.\n\n5. If the research study will collect tissues or any other biological samples, the study should provide a plan for the storage and use of the samples, and a plan to protect the confidentiality of the samples. If the samples will be transported back to RU or the U.S., the protocol must provide a plan for shipment of the samples that are in accordance with both the local country and U.S. regulations and policies.\n\nUnsterilized specimens of human and animal tissues (such as blood, body discharges, fluids, excretions, or similar material) containing an infectious or etiologic agent require a permit in order to be imported (USPHS 42 CFR 71) to the U.S. Details on the regulatory requirements, the process for obtaining a permit, and shipping and handling of such issues can be found on the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/od/eaipp/.\n\nIf the material being imported has been rendered sterile (e.g., radiation or chemical treatment) and is known not to contain infectious agents for humans, a permit is not required for importation.\n\nBe sure to consult with other relevant RU Departments regarding work in international settings and/or use and transport of specimens, such as Export Control, Office of Information Technology, and BioSafety Committee, to name a few.\n\nThe IRB recognizes that there are instances for which parts of the guidance cited above for international studies would be inappropriate, such as with ethnographic research, both domestic and international, where researchers observe, interact, and may live with subjects in their native environment, often for long periods of time. Research that presents concerns that are unique to a population and its culture would, by necessity, require careful consideration by the IRB and the researcher as to how best to protect the rights and welfare of the subjects.\n\nFor Further Information, Toolkit Documents, and Guidance\n\nVisit HRPP Toolkit to obtain referenced Toolkit Forms & Templates\n\nVisit HRPP Guidance Topics to obtain referenced Guidance documents.\n\nContact your IRB Office at https://go.rutgers.edu/ContactUs if you need further assistance.\n\nOverview\n\nThe inability to understand spoken English or read and comprehend documents written in English creates a practical barrier for non-English speaking persons to make an informed decision to or actually participate in research. Consistent with its mission to reflect the diversity of its communities in its services and research endeavors, Rutgers’ guides investigators to provide research study information in a language potential subjects can understand to:\n\nFacilitate persons’ autonomy to consent to participate in research and;\n\nEnsure equitable and fair procedures for the inclusion of diverse populations in research.\n\nThe steps outlined below are intended to provide guidance to investigators on appropriate methods to ensure that non-English speaking persons (or their legally authorized representative or surrogate) are provided with sufficient information in order to exercise informed consent to participate in research and how to document that process in the research record.\n\nProcedures For Long Form Method\n\nThis Method includes written translation of an IRB-approved English language consent document and any accompanying study materials.\n\nWhen must I use the Long Form Method?\n\nRutgers requires investigators to use the Long Form Method, a written translation of the entire English language consent document approved by the IRB, assent document and any accompanying study materials (i.e., brochures, questionnaires, etc., unless the documents have not been validated for use in non-English speaking populations) into a language understandable by potential participants in research when:\n\nThe research targets a specific population that is non-English speaking;\n\nA significant proportion of participants are anticipated to be non-English speaking; or\n\nHowever unanticipated, when five or more persons enrolled in the research do not speak English, but share another language in common.\n\nNOTE: Investigators who request a waiver of necessity for translated consents when conducting pilot studies in environments where non-English speaking participants are anticipated must demonstrate how exclusion of non-English speaking participants in the pilot study will not later negatively impact equitable access, participant comprehensibility or research tool applicability to diverse populations that may be solicited for participation in the full research.\n\nWhat steps should I follow to ensure an accurate translation?\n\nAfter obtaining IRB-approval of the English language consent document to be used in your research study, have a qualified translator translate the IRB-approved document in its entirety. The translation from English to another language may be completed by a person who is a member of the research team, providing they possess the necessary qualifying language competency. If the study is deemed greater than minimal risk, or is otherwise required by the IRB, a back translation must be completed by a qualified person who is independent of the research. Back translations are not required if the original translation is provided by a certified translator. [Note: To conserve resources, first obtain IRB approval for the English version of the consent document before translating it.]\n\nIf paragraphs within a proposed consent document were translated by different sources (e.g., some paragraphs were translated by NIH, NSF or NCI, while other paragraphs were provided by department personnel within Rutgers), a back translation of the consent document must be conducted to ensure the pieced together consent maintains the integrity and meaning of the original sources.\n\nHow do I obtain IRB approval?\n\nTranslations of the consent documents must be reviewed and approved by the IRB before their use. It is recommended that investigators first obtain approval for the English version of the consent document, and then submit translation(s) of other language(s) and back translations, if applicable, as a modification to the approved protocol. The following items should be submitted for IRB review and approval of the foreign language translation of the full consent document:\n\nIRB-approved English language consent document;\n\nConsent document translated into the desired language;\n\nA letter or other written documentation confirming that the translation (and back translation, as applicable) is accurate and consistent in content, style, and level of readability with the IRB-approved document and, for non-certified translators, an explanation of the translator(s)’ qualifications. (See Translator Qualifications and Assurances Instruction and Certificate of Translation Form at HRPP Toolkit.) The letter or other written documentation should reference the study title and IRB approval number, as well as document identifier(s) (i.e., title and IRB-approved version date) that is unique to each IRB-approved item being translated (and back-translated, as applicable); and\n\nA plan to ensure an adequate consent process and an outline of how communication between the non-English-speaking person (or their legally authorized representative or surrogate) will be facilitated throughout the course of the research.\n\nThe accuracy of documents translated must be confirmed by a qualified translator whose credentials are acceptable to the IRB. The IRB will use its discretion in determining whether the credentials of the translator are acceptable, based on the nature and level of risk involved in the proposed research study:\n\nConsent and supporting documents must be translated by a qualified translator for minimal risk studies;\n\nConsent and supporting documents must be translated by a qualified translator and then back- translated by another qualified translator for greater than minimal risk studies. However, if the research is a minor increment over minimal risk, the IRB may waive the requirement of the back translation into English;\n\nCertified translated consent and supporting documents do not require back-translation, regardless of risk determination; and\n\nThe IRB may require a certified translation depending on the complexities of the proposed research.\n\nWhat consent process must I follow when using the Long Form Method?\n\nThe following consent process should be followed when using the Long Form Method to ensure that non-English speaking participants can provide meaningful informed consent:\n\nIf a member of the study staff obtaining consent is not fluent in the potential participant’s language, a qualified interpreter fluent in English and the participant’s language must orally interpret the consent conversation, ask if the participant has any questions and then be available to answer their questions. Interactive 3-way communication is essential to ensure informed consent; and\n\nThe person, if agreeing to participate, and a member of the research team obtaining consent must sign and date the IRB-approved non-English language version of the consent document. If a qualified interpreter is present, they should also sign the consent. If a qualified telephone interpreter is used, their participation should be appropriately documented on the consent document and the research record by the research staff (document the date, time, language, interpreter ID#, and interpreting company used) (See Form Witness and Interpreter Consent Documentation Instructions at HRPP Toolkit Section Non-English-Speaking Subjects for recommended documenting format.)\n\nProcedures For Short Form Method\n\nThis method includes Oral Presentation of the IRB-Approved Consent Document and a Written Translation of an Abbreviated, or Short Form, Consent Document.\n\nWhen may I use the Short Form Method?\n\nThe short form method—the use of an oral presentation of the IRB-approved consent document and a written translation of an abbreviated, or short form, consent document stating that the elements have been presented orally to the potential participant (or their legally authorized representative) in a language understandable to the participant—may be used when all of the following apply:\n\nThe research does not target a non-English speaking population;\n\nThe research is classified as minimal risk or greater than minimal risk but with prospect for direct benefit;\n\nThe participant (or legally authorized representative) speaks only a language(s) that was not anticipated in the potential study population. Note: The Short Form Method may not be used when the potential participant is represented by a surrogate—only use the Long Form Method in these instances;\n\nAn appropriately translated consent document in the participant’s language has not been approved by the IRB; and\n\nFewer than 5 participants enrolled in the research do not speak English but do share another language in common.\n\nWhat steps should I follow to ensure an adequate oral presentation and short-form written translation?\n\nTemplates for the short form consent in English and a number of other languages are available at the HRPP Forms and Templates webpage HRPP Toolkit. Choose the short form consent written in the language the subject is fluent. Have a qualified translator translate the study title and insert it at the top of the short form. If the study is greater than minimal risk, a back-translation of the title by a second qualified translator is recommended. If the translator is certified, a back translation is not necessary.\n\nHow do I obtain IRB approval?\n\nWhen you wish to enroll a non-English speaking person in IRB-approved research but do not have a written translation of the entire English language consent document approved by the IRB, you must notify the IRB and request use of a non-English language abbreviated short form consent. Investigators should contact and then submit to the IRB (1) a modification request; (2) the translated short form consent; and (3) documentation of translator(s) qualifications. (See Certificate of Translation Form at HRPP Toolkit.) The IRB will respond to the request within 48-72 hours. NOTE: IRB approval of the non-English language short form consent document and process is required prior to their use, even when using the HRPP downloadable templates.\n\nWhen five or more persons enrolled in the research do not speak English, but share another language in common, the investigator must obtain an IRB-approved translation of the IRB-approved consent document and follow the long form method outlined above.\n\nWhat consent process must I follow when using the Short Form Method?\n\nThe following consent process should be followed when using the Short Form Method to ensure that non-English speaking persons can provide meaningful informed consent:\n\nA qualified interpreter fluent in English and the potential participant’s language must orally present the entire English language IRB-approved consent form in a language understandable to the participant (or his/her legally authorized representative). The interpreter must also ask if the participant (or his/her legally authorized representative) has any questions and then be available to answer their questions. Interactive 3-way communication is essential to ensure informed consent. The interpreter may be a member of the research team. If a bilingual investigator serves as the qualified interpreter, there must also be a witness to the presentation who is fluent in English and the language understood by the potential participant (or his/her legally authorized representative). The witness may not be the person obtaining consent.\n\nThe potential participant (or his/her legally authorized representative) is provided a copy of the abbreviated short form consent written in the language they are fluent in to review;\n\nA witness to the oral presentation fluent in English and the participant’s (or their legally authorized representative) language is required to attest to the adequacy of the consent process and to the participant’s (or their legally authorized representative’s) voluntary consent. An interpreter may serve in the dual role as interpreter and witness, if s/he is not the study member obtaining consent.\n\nRequirements for documenting the consent process when using the short form:\n\nThe participant (or their authorized representative) must sign and date the short form consent written in the appropriate language, if agreeing to participate;\n\nThe principal investigator or research team member obtaining consent must sign and date a written copy of the orally presented IRB-approved English language consent long form;\n\nThe witness, who may not be the person obtaining consent, must sign and date the foreign language short form and the orally presented IRB-approved English language long form consent;\n\nA copy of the signed short form in the participant’s language and the orally presented IRB-approved English language consent form must be given to the participant (or their authorized representative); and\n\nThe consent process, including the language used and presence of interpreters and witnesses, should be appropriately documented on the consent form and in the research record (by study staff (document the date, time, language, interpreter ID#, and interpreting company used). (See Form Witness/Interpreter Consent Documentation Instructions at HRPP Toolkit.)\n\nInformed consent is a process that requires investigators to continuously reassess the participant’s understanding of the nature of the research, its risks of harm and potential for benefit. Adequate communication between the research staff and participant must occur throughout the research to ensure the participant’s willingness to continue participation in the research, the safety and welfare of the participant and the integrity of the research data. To avoid delay in participant recruitment and enrollment, investigators are urged to anticipate the presentation and language requirements of potential non-English speaking persons.\n\nRWJ Hospital\n\nRobert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) is committed to providing the best communication process for all of our patients.

In this area, you can use Procurement's \"Find a Universityide Contracted Supplier\" to search by keyword.\n\nDefinitions\n\nBack Translation: When a document translated from English to another language is translated back into English to confirm the accuracy of the original translation.\n\nCertified Interpreter/Translator and/or Services: While no national licensing or certification program for medical research translator/interpreters exists in the United States, some universities, independent companies, and professional associations provide training and testing in translation and interpretation services. [Two notable professional associations that offer testing of trained translators/interpreters are The National Board of Certification for Medical Interpreters, and the American Translators Association]. For purposes of this policy, a certified interpreter or translator is a person with professional interpreter or translator training and English and foreign language competency demonstrated successfully passing a test offered by a university, company or association.\n\nLong-Form Consent Translation: A written translation of the entire English consent document approved by the IRB into a language understandable by non-English speaking persons (or their authorized representative or surrogate) being recruited for research.\n\nNon-English-Speaking Participant: An individual (or their legally authorized representative or surrogate) who is unable to verbally comprehend spoken English or read and comprehend documents written in English.\n\nQualified Interpreter: A qualified interpreter, fluent in both English and the language understood by the subject/representative, must orally present the entire English language IRB-approved consent form. The interpreter must also ask if the subject/representative have any questions and then be available to answer their questions. A qualified interpreter may be a certified interpreter, native speaker, or someone who possesses dual language fluency by education or training, and is able to orally communicate complex ideas and procedures, as applicable, about the research. Family members may not serve as interpreters for the consent process except in emergency, life- threatening situations. Skill and impartiality are key qualities of an interpreter. NOTE: The IRB or research site where the consent process will take place may require that the interpreter be certified by a national organization or employed by the site or through a contracted interpreting agency.\n\nQualified Translator: A translator is someone who converts a written text from one language to another. A qualified translator is someone who possesses competency in English and a foreign language, such as a certified translator, native speaker, or provides other evidence of dual language fluency, and possesses an appropriate scientific or medical background. A qualified translator may also be an external sponsor which provides a certifiable translation, such as NIH, NSF, NCI, or private industry which provides a certified translation.\n\nShort-Form Consent Translation: The short-form is an abbreviated consent document written in language understandable to the prospective participant recruited for research stating that the elements of informed consent, which are outlined on the long-form consent in general terms, have been presented orally and are understood by the participant (or their authorized representative or surrogate).\n\nWitness: An adult who is fluent in both English and the language understandable to the prospective participant who witnesses the entire consent process between an English-speaking study staff member, a qualified interpreter, and the non-English speaking participant when a “short-form” translated consent is used. The witness is required to verify the adequacy of the consent process and the participant’s voluntary consent. The witness must be independent of the study and must be present for the consent discussion. An interpreter may serve as a witness if s/he is not also the person obtaining consent.\n\nOverview\n\nDatabases, registries (data banks), and repositories (tissue banks) all involve the collection and storage of information and/or biological specimens over time. Some registry/repositories serve diagnostic or clinical purposes, while others are solely for research. Many serve more than one purpose.\n\nResearch use data/biospecimens that are stored in registry/repositories is governed by the federal human subject protection regulations known as the common rule (45 CFR 46 (link is external)) and the HIPAA privacy rule (link is external) (45 CFR 160 & 164) and by Rutgers University IRB policies and procedures. Specific requirements depend upon how and why the information or specimens in the resource are collected, stored, used, and shared.\n\nThe requirements for and extent of IRB oversight depends on the whether or not the data/biospecimens include or are linked to individually identifiable health information and the terms of the informed consent under which the data/biospecimens were originally collected.\n\nData and tissue banks registries, data banks, and tissue banks are all considered synonymous with the term repositories for regulatory purposes. For the purposes of this webpage they will be referred to as repositories or registry/repositories and the contents as data, biospecimens or data/biospecimens.\n\nNon-Research Databases And Repositories\n\nDatabases and repositories are frequently created and maintained for purposes totally unrelated to research. For example, Rutgers University maintains a variety of electronic health records and data warehouse intended for diagnosis, treatment, billing, marketing, and quality improvement/control purposes. Individual departments and divisions use their own databases that have been established for clinical and quality improvement purposes. Examples include the following:\n\nAnesthesia electronic record system used in the operating room to record preoperative history and physical examination data, store the vital signs and anesthetic medication administration and create anesthetic records for every procedure.\n\nPathology department biospecimens and records for all of the materials received for diagnostic or treatment purposes.\n\nOperating room management database\n\nEPIC\n\nQuality assurance/quality improvement initiatives\n\nThese databases and repositories serve predominantly non-research purposes. However, the information they contain can be used to address important scientific questions. IRB approval is not required for creation or use of a non-research database or Biospecimen collection but is required to use these resources for research purposes. See what must be reviewed by the IRB for more details.\n\nResearch Databases\n\nResearch databases may be maintained after the completion of a study. Additional questions may arise in the future that can be addressed using the same dataset. If there is an intent to set up a registry, then the informed consent document should include language for subjects to opt-in or opt-out of storage of their data for future research purposes. The subject's decision as indicated on the consent/authorization must be respected and tracked. IRB oversight is required for each new research protocol that uses identifiable or re-identifiable information contained in the database.\n\nA research database may also be created specifically as a resource for future research. IRB oversight is required to set up and maintain a research database.\n\nExamples of research databases include:\n\nData compiled from a clinical trial\n\nA list of names, diagnosis, and contact information developed and maintained to identify prospective research subjects\n\nA collection of medical information intended for use in future research studies\n\nSome databases created and maintained to serve multiple purposes. Examples include:\n\nA collection of patients' diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up information intended for and used to conduct (i.) Internal quality assurance programs and (ii) generalizable studies on the effectiveness of particular treatment interventions.\n\nA compilation of patient information that was originally created and used for billing purposes but is now also routinely used to identify prospective research subjects.\n\nResearch Repositories\n\nBiospecimens may be collected to achieve one or more of the objectives of a single study with disposal of the leftover materials at the end of the study. A repository is created if the leftover materials are stored for future use. If there is an intent to set up a repository, then the informed consent document should include language for subjects to opt-in or opt-out of storage of their data for future research purposes. The subject's decision as indicated on the consent/authorization must be respected and tracked.\n\nSpecimens may also be collected specifically for the purposes of future research. IRB oversight is required for each new research protocol that creates a reposit\n\nKey Human Subjects Concerns For Managing A Repository\n\nThe IRB will pay particular attention to the following issues and how they are addressed in the protocol and application:\n\nThe language in the informed consent/authorization agreement specifying the nature and purposes of the future research\n\nThe registry/repository sops for storage, use, back-up, and sharing the data/biospecimens;\n\nThe security measures and sops detailing the methods of coding data & specimens, encrypting or anonymizing data/biospecimens to protect the privacy of subjects and the confidentiality of the data/biospecimens\n\nThe methods of sharing data/biospecimens (with or without identifiers) to recipient investigators\n\nDeveloping & Maintaining A Research Registry/Repository\n\nFor the purposes of the remainder of this page, both registries and repositories will be referred to as repositories. The advantage to investigators of creating, maintaining, and/or using a research repository lies in the prospective collection, the safe storage and back-up, controlled access to and use of data/biospecimens. The information and specimens can be accessed by multiple investigators for multiple research projects. Some of the potential research uses may be anticipated at the time of collection but most cannot be specified at the time the repository is created.\n\nA repository protocol may be submitted to the IRB either to:\n\nDefine the operating parameters for establishing and maintaining a research repository; or\n\nConvert an existing research database, non-research database, or non-research repository into a research repository.\n\nThe IRB can approve relatively broad parameters for collecting, storing, sharing, and using the repository's information and/or specimens in research, provided the protocol incorporates a series of research protections that permit multiple uses of repository information and/or specimens by multiple investigators and/or for multiple research projects with minimal additional review by the IRB. To maximize the utility of the data/biospecimens retained in the repository requires careful planning and clear operating policies and procedures (SOP). The mechanisms put in place will determine the requirements for IRB oversight of future uses of the materials in the repository.\n\nResponsibilities Of The Repository\n\nResearchers who wish to develop or maintain a repository that is being developed for the purposes of current or future research, need to submit an application for IRB review and approval. IRB approval is required before initiating any repository-related activity. Operators of the repository must implement physical and procedural mechanisms for the secure receipt, storage, and transmission of information and specimens. These procedures must be reviewed and approved by the repository IRB and must be sufficient to ensure the protection of subjects' privacy and the confidentiality of subjects' information.\n\nIn addition to the usual information contained in a human research protocol and an IRB application, the IRB expects that will include at least the following specific information:\n\nThe specific conditions under which data/biospecimens may be accepted into the repository, including requirement for the FWA number for each site IRB and a copy of the IRB approval letter;\n\nA detailed description of the physical and procedural mechanisms for the secure receipt, storage, and transmission of information and specimens to ensure the protection of subjects' privacy and the confidentiality of subjects' data/specimens,\n\nThe specific conditions under which data and/or specimens may be shared with or released to research investigators including policies pertaining prohibiting or permitting the sharing of phi associated with the data/biospecimens,\n\nProtocol for the collectors of data/specimens\n\nTemplate consent and written authorization or combined consent/authorization for the collection sites that includes a clear description of each of the following:\n\nThe general concept and purpose of repository;\n\nThe name and location of the repository(ies);\n\nThe nature and types of future research in as much specific detail as possible;\n\nA summary of the physical and procedural mechanisms for protecting subjects' privacy and the confidentiality of data/biospecimens;\n\nThe conditions (if any) under which subject's may withdraw their consent/authorization to use of specimens;\n\nThe conditions and requirements under which data/biospecimens and materials derived from biospecimens may be shared with recipient-investigators;\n\nThe elements of phi (if any) to be shared with recipient investigators;\n\nItemization of the risks related to a breach of confidentiality including impact on privacy, insurability, stigmatization, etc.;\n\nWhere human genetic research is anticipated, information about the consequences of dna typing (e.g., regarding possible paternity determinations, impact on insurability, etc.) And related confidentiality risks.\n\nDeveloping A Repository Protocol\n\nThe IRB has created a registry-repository protocol template. It is available on our protocol template page, and it includes guidance on developing a protocol for a repository. This template will need to be modified, with sections added or deleted depending on the specifics of the data and specimens collected, the potential future uses for the data/specimens, the potential for returning results, the intent to include other sites, the intent to share the data/specimens and research results with other investigators, the structure of the oversight of the repository and other issues.\n\nDeveloping A Consent Form For A Repository\n\nThe IRB has created an example biorepository consent form for studies where the sole procedure is collection of data and specimens for a repository. This form is an example only and might need to be modified substantially depending on the nature of the data and specimens that will be collected, the types of tests routinely performed on the specimens and the potential future uses for the materials collected. (See Rutgers Consent Template at bottom of webpage)\n\nResponsibilities Of The Collector\n\nInvestigators who collect the data/biospecimens (the collector) that will be stored in a repository must agree in writing to specific conditions stipulated by the repository IRB (the IRB exercising oversight of the repository. Collectors other responsibilities include:\n\nObtaining appropriate IRB approval from their local IRB\n\nObtaining and documenting informed consent/authorization as required by their IRB;\n\nFollowing the protocol procedures including:\n\nObtaining the required data/biospecimens in the appropriate form and storage medium and at the specified time points;\n\nCoding and labeling the samples before shipping or uploading the data/biospecimens to the registry/repository;\n\nRemoving all unnecessary phi from the data/biospecimens;\n\nMethods for maintaining and securing phi associated with the data/biospecimens sent to the registry/repository and any links (key) between the donor and the data/biospecimens as specified in the protocol.\n\nResponsibilities Of The Recipient\n\nInvestigators receiving data/biospecimens from the repository (the recipient) must also agree in writing to specific conditions required by the repository IRB and must adhere to local IRB oversight requirements. The nature of the local IRB oversight requirements depends upon whether or not the received data/biospecimens are potentially identifiable.\n\nSharing And Using Data/Biospecimens From Research Repositories\n\nEnsuring that comprehensive subject protection mechanism are in place at the time the registry/repository is created, permits new collecting investigators, new research projects, and new recipient investigators to be added to the repository's activities without protracted IRB review. Many new activities may require only expedited review by the IRB. Under some circumstances, they may simply require timely notification of the IRB or may not require IRB review and approval at all. The use and disclosure of information/specimens from a research repository are determined by the following:\n\nThe requirements of the repository IRB who is responsible for the review, approval, and oversight of the repository; and\n\nThe requirements of the local IRB who is responsible for research at the site where the information/specimens will be used.\n\nRepositories Located Within Rutgers University\n\nThe IRB is responsible for any research repository maintained at Rutgers University or its affiliates, including their employees or agents (e.g., Rutgers university faculty). Data/biospecimens from these repositories may be accessed, used, shared, or disclosed in accordance with the IRB-approved repository protocol and consent/authorization and any additional approval conditions stipulated by the IRB. Once provided to recipient-investigators outside Rutgers University and its affiliates, use and disclosure of the data/specimens must also comply with any additional requirements of the recipient institution and its IRB.\n\nRepositories Outside Of Rutgers University\n\nWhen data/biospecimens are received by Rutgers university investigators, their use and disclosure must comply with any conditions stipulated by the sending institution's IRB. Rutgers University policies and procedures for the protection of human subjects and the use and disclosure of protected health information must also be observed.\n\nReceipt of de-identified data/biospecimens does not engage Rutgers University or its investigators in human subjects research.\n\nReceipt of a limited dataset requires a duly executed data use agreement between the Rutgers university investigator and the provider of the data/biospecimens.\n\nWhen data/biospecimens contain phi, it is up to the IRB, not the investigator, to determine the human subject protection and privacy rule protections required for any research activities. Investigators should consult the IRB before initiating any research involving data/biospecimens obtained from outside repositories (including outside data banks, tissue banks, and registries) if the materials will include phi.\n\nRutgers University Repository Documents\n\nData/Tissue Repository SOP Template Protocol\n\nAddendum Consent Template For Tissue Collection For Future Study-Secondary to Main Study [WORD]\n\nConsent Template For Research Tissue Bank or Research Bank [WORD]\n\nNCI's Glossary of Terms\n\nAdditional Guidance\n\nSACHRP FAQs, Terms and Recommendations on Informed Consent and Research Use of Biospecimens (PDF)\n\nA Multidisciplinary Approach to Honest Broker Services for Tissue Banks and Clinical Data (link is external)\n\nAn 'Honest Broker' mechanism to maintain privacy for patient care and academic medical research (link is external)\n\nRelated Government Guidance\n\nOHRP's Guidance on Coded Private Information or Biological Specimens (link is external)\n\nOHRP: Issues to Consider in the Research Use of Stored Data or Tissues (link is external)\n\nNCI: Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research (link is external)\n\nNCI: Best Practices for Biospecimen Resources (revised 2010) (link is external)\n\nNIDDK data repository: a central collection of clinical trial data (link is external)\n\nOverview\n\nDatabases, registries (data banks), and repositories (tissue banks) all involve the collection and storage of information and/or biological specimens over time.
