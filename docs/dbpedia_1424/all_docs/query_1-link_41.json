        "text": "Jennifer Lopez is killing it this year. She’s the hottest ticket in Las Vegas with her residency show All I Have, and her new TV drama Shades Of Blue is a ratings winner.\n\nSo what’s the latest come-up for the diva? She’s headed back to Epic Records.\n\nSigning a new long-term contract with the Sony Music-owned label Epic Records and reuniting with longtime mentor and chairman L.A. Reid, the CEO announced, “I’m thrilled to welcome Jennifer back home with me to Epic Records. Jennifer is a true global icon with a magnetism that sears across music, film, and TV and I’m excited to be working together again.”\n\nThe businesswoman and American Idol judge previously released six albums with Epic over the years of 1999 to 2007, including her 2001 biggest seller J. Lo. After teasing a new song called “Breaking Me Down” last year and hinting at a collaboration with Missy Elliott on Twitter, it shouldn’t be long before Jenny blesses us with new tunes."
