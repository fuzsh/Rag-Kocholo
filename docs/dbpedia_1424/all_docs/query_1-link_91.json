        "text": "Giveon just released his first EP on a major label and sings the hook on Drake’s new song, but it was a steady singing gig his mom procured that the Long Beach crooner credits for developing his smooth baritone voice.\n\nIn order to develop his talent as a kid, she made him sing at every family birthday party, although he didn’t have a say when it came to the set list.\n\n“I thought it would be more than that, but I was literally just singing the ‘Happy Birthday’ song. So after years of just singing that it just honed my craft. I didn’t know that would happen, so I call my mom Mr. Miyagi,” said the 25-year-old singer who released his debut EP “Take Time,” on March 27.\n\nThe eight-song EP on Epic Records mixes R&B and soul with some hip-hop elements in songs inspired by past romantic relationships and the painful breakups he experienced in his hometown.\n\n“Whenever someone hears my music and they want to know where the soul and songs come from, it’s just from me growing up in Long Beach and that being embedded in me. It comes out in my songs,” Giveon said.\n\nThe Long Beach Poly High School graduate developed his love of music from listening to his mother play songs by Mary J. Blige, Sade and Anita Baker as she cleaned the house.\n\n“She played those songs all day so I had no choice but to sing along and then she just noticed I was able to stay in key and keep a note,” he said.\n\nGiveon did eventually move on from his early days of only singing the birthday song.\n\nHe started writing his own songs as a teen while looking up to R&B artists such as San Pedro native Miguel and Frank Ocean before gaining inspiration from a legendary artist.\n\nDuring those teenage years, Giveon attended a Grammy Museum music camp through a Long Beach program for low-income families. At the camp, an instructor took notice of his vocal abilities and advised him to check out Frank Sinatra.\n\n“That was my first experience with a baritone singer. From there I found confidence in my voice,” he said.\n\nFast rise\n\nWhile his new EP is called “Take Time,” a lot has happened for Giveon in a short time. About a year ago, he met producer Sevn Thomas, who has worked with artists like Rihanna, Drake and Travis Scott.\n\nThat led to the release of two songs, “Heartbreak Anniversary” and “Like I Want You,” plus a spot opening for L.A.-based Swedish singer Snoh Aalegra on tour.\n\nAnd on his new EP his hometown finds its way into the songs immediately with the first track called “The Beach.”\n\n“All my songs are based on true stories…the first song is essentially me reflecting on the idea of bringing a girl to the hood and not knowing how she would react to that,” he said.\n\nIn addition to his own music, Giveon’s gained some steam thanks to his guest spot on Drake’s new song “Chicago Freestyle.” Giveon opens the track in an emotive voice, singing “Two-thirty, baby, won’t you meet me by The Bean? Too early, maybe later you can show me things,” before Drake launches into the song.\n\nSince he’s a newcomer on the scene, some Drake fans may have thought the guest voice on the song belonged to frequent collaborator Sampha. But Giveon made sure there was no more confusion about who’s voice that is or where it comes from.\n\n“That’s not Sampha!! That’s me!! Spread the word!!,” the 25-year-old singer posted on Twitter shortly after Drake’s song came out in late February.\n\nAnd while working with Drake has earned him a lot of new attention and new fans, he hopes it will also bring positive attention to his city.\n\n“It just felt great (working with Drake), especially coming from where I come from in Long Beach you don’t really see stuff like that. So I’m just taking it day by day and just really being appreciative of the opportunity and I just want to make sure other kids from Long Beach see it,” he said."
