        "text": "Power words are like a “cheat code” for writing.\n\nSprinkle in a few, and you can transform dull, lifeless words into copy that crackles with with power.\n\nThey will instantly make you more captivating, charismatic, and persuasive.\n\nHow do I know?\n\nBecause I’m a world-class writer, and I use them all the time.\n\nFrom getting noticed and shared by influencers like Tim Ferriss…\n\nTo writing posts like this that get millions of visitors…\n\nTo making millions of dollars (despite being in a wheelchair) and living like a king.\n\nWords are my superpower. My addiction. My secret weapon.\n\nAnd I’m about to give you a master class in how to use them, right here, right now, for free.\n\nBuckle up. We about to go wild.\n\nClear as mud?\n\nLet’s deconstruct an example from the great Winston Churchill. All the power words are underlined:\n\nInspiring, right?\n\nHere’s why:\n\nPower Words = Emotional Words Packed with Persuasion\n\nSmart speakers, as well as their speechwriters, sprinkle their speeches with carefully-chosen power words drenched in sensory details, drawing the target audience from one emotion to another as skillfully as any novelist or screenwriter.\n\nAnd it goes beyond speakers and storytellers.\n\nEmail marketing messages, copywriting, infographics, step-by-step tutorials, sales pages, inspirational quotes, content marketing, case studies, calls to action, testimonials, tweets, and other social media posts are all designed to influence the reader (and prospective customers) in some way. You want to pass along information, yes, but you also want the reader to feel a certain way about that information.\n\nMaybe you want to impress them, get them excited, make them cautious, get them angry, encourage them to keep going, trigger curiosity, create urgency, build trust with them, or any number of emotions. The better a job you do at making them feel, the more influential you are, and the better your chances of getting what you want.\n\nNow, let’s go over all the different places you can use them:\n\n1. Using Power Words in Headlines\n\nAny writer or blogger who’s been in the game for a while knows the headline is the most important part of writing your blog post.\n\nIts purpose, after all, is to entice the reader to read the rest of your content. If your headline fails to get attention, potential readers will ignore it when it shows up in their tweets and social media feeds.\n\nAnd just one or two power words in your headline is usually enough to make it stand out.\n\nJust look at this headline from BuzzFeed:\n\nBeyoncé Just Unveiled Her Twins To The World In The Most Breathtaking Photo\n\nThe word choice of “Unveiled” makes it feel like a secret is being exposed, and the word “Breathtaking” makes you curious to see what the photo looks like.\n\nHere’s another example from BoredPanda:\n\n50+ Adorable Snake Pics That Will Help You Conquer Your Fear\n\nPeople generally love anything adorable, so this headline will easily catch attention. (The fact that it refers to snakes will only make people more curious.)\n\nThe headline then drives it home by using the power verb “Conquer.”\n\nHere’s one from BrightSide:\n\n24 Proofs That Perfect Social Network Photos Are a Shameless Lie\n\nWhile one or two power words are often enough, this headline proves you can use more when it fits.\n\nThis headline has four powerful words, but they feel natural in the headline, which keeps it from feeling like over-the-top clickbait.\n\nHere’s one from Smart Blogger:\n\n10+ Super SMART Goal Examples (& A Handy Template)\n\n“Super”, “Smart”, and “Handy” pack some punch (and some alliteration) into our recent article on SMART goal setting.\n\nLast one:\n\nHow to Make Money Writing: 5 Ways to Get Paid to Write\n\nThis headline from our guide on making money as a writer incorporates two greed words: “money” and “get paid.”\n\nIt’s one of our most popular posts, and its headline’s use of power words is a big reason why.\n\nMy personal process for writing headlines:\n\nI pick an emotion I want the reader to feel\n\nI ask myself what words create that emotion inside people\n\nI pack those power words into my headline to give it an emotional punch\n\nThe result? More traffic to everything I write.\n\n2. Using Power Words in Subheads\n\nToo many writers overlook the value of subheads, which is a mistake. Once people click on your headline, most will scan the post first to see if it looks worthy of their attention.\n\nAdding some power words to your subheads is a good way to make your post look like an interesting read.\n\nFor example, here are three subheads from our post on E-book mistakes:\n\nThree Rock-Solid Reasons to Write Your First E-book\n\nWhy Most E-books Are Embarrassingly Bad\n\nPlanning Mistakes: How to Doom Your E-book Before You Even Start Writing\n\nSee how the power words in these subheads grab your attention and make you want to read the text that follows?\n\nPower words can help with SEO too. Adding an SEO power word to your subheads will compel readers to stick around longer, which will increase your dwell time — a big deal in Google’s eyes.\n\n3. Using Power Words in Email Subject Lines\n\nHaving an email list is of little use if only a handful of readers bother to open your emails.\n\nAnd these days, most people’s inboxes are flooded, so they’re selective in which emails they open.\n\nYou can stand out in their inbox and raise your open rates by including power words in your subject lines.\n\nJust look at this one from Ramit Sethi:\n\nThe “unspoken rules” of learning\n\nIf this subject line would’ve read “The rules of learning,” do you think it would be as appealing? The powerful word “unspoken” is what makes it interesting.\n\nHere’s another one from Cal Fussman:\n\nManchester: A Lesson in Triumph over Tragedy\n\nBoth “Triumph” and “Tragedy” are powerful words full of emotion.\n\nAnd finally, here’s a good example from AppSumo:\n\nUnleash the power of video chat\n\nThe power phrase “Unleash the power” makes you feel this email is hiding something incredibly powerful inside.\n\nSee how that works?\n\nWhen you send out emails to your list, try to add a strong word to your subject line so it stands out in a prospect’s inbox.\n\n4. Using Power Words in Opt-In Boxes\n\nIf you’re running a business, one of your main goals is to grow a large and engaged readership, and the best way to do it is by converting readers into subscribers.\n\nThat means — unless you’re using a blogging platform like Medium which doesn’t allow them — you should have opt-in forms scattered across your website.\n\nYou can place them on your homepage, at the end of your posts, in your sidebar, in a popup, or anywhere else.\n\nBut no matter where you place them, your opt-in boxes must catch people’s eye and make them want to share their email address with you. Because they won’t give it away to just anyone.\n\n(Remember, their inboxes are already flooded, so they’re not necessarily eager to get even more emails.)\n\nFortunately, you can use power words to make your offer more enticing.\n\nAs an example, here’s an old popup from Cosmopolitan:\n\nThis popup had power words everywhere, but it avoided feeling like overkill. I bet it converted like crazy.\n\nHere’s a slightly more subtle example from Betty Means Business:\n\nIt’s understated, but still quite effective.\n\nAgain, you don’t have to overdo it with the power words on these. A little can go a long way.\n\nHere’s one final example from Renegade Planner:\n\nIn short:\n\nIf you’re not using power words in your opt-in boxes, you’re missing out.\n\nBig time.\n\n5. Using Power Words on Your Homepage\n\nYour homepage is the face of your website and it’s usually one of the most visited pages. Many people who visit your website will see this page first, so you want it to make a good first impression.\n\nSome people use their homepage to promote their email list, others use it to promote one of their products, and others use it as a red carpet — welcoming new visitors and explaining what their site is all about.\n\nIn any case, your homepage is a good spot to add a few power words, as it can determine whether people stay (and take the action you want them to take) or leave (never to return).\n\nLook at this value proposition on the homepage for Nerd Fitness:\n\n“Nerds,” “Misfits,” and “Mutants” are unusual power words that work well for Nerd Fitness’ target audience. These words immediately separate it from all the other fitness blogs out there.\n\nBut they push it even further with “Strong,” “Healthy,” and “Permanently.”\n\nHere’s another value proposition from MainStreetHost’s homepage:\n\nIt’s quite minimal, isn’t it? They just wrote down three power words and follow it up with a service they provide.\n\nOf course, you don’t have to limit your use of power words to the top of your homepage.\n\nYou can use it in other parts of the homepage too, as Ramit Sethi does here in his list of what you’ll get when you sign up for his email list:\n\nGo look at your homepage now and see if you can find any areas you can spruce up with some power words.\n\n6. Using Power Words in Business Names/Blog Names\n\nHaving a forgettable name is poison to your website’s growth. So when you start a blog, you want to make sure you have a name people can easily recall.\n\nIf you haven’t chosen your blog name yet (or if you’re thinking about rebranding), you should use a SEO power word to give it some punch. The right word will make you stand out from all the boring, forgettable brands out there.\n\nJust take a look at the collection of blog names below and see how well they’ve incorporated power words:\n\n7. Using Power Words in Product Names\n\nJust like you can use power words to spruce up your blog name, you can also use them to make your product names pack more of a punch.\n\nIt can make the difference between your potential customers thinking, “Ooh, this product sounds cool!” and them thinking, “Meh.”\n\nJust check out this subscription product from Nerd Fitness:\n\nIt has such a powerful name that you’d almost want to sign up without learning anything else about it. Who wouldn’t want to be part of a community of rising heroes?\n\nHere’s another good example from Pat Flynn:\n\nIt’s a powerful name for his podcasting course that instantly informs you of the benefit.\n\nSo if you’re about to launch a product (or if you’ve launched a product with a tepid name), consider giving it a power word to make it pack a punch.\n\n8. Using Power Words on Sales Pages\n\nYou can also use power words to spruce up the copywriting on your sales pages and make them more effective at selling your e-commerce products or services.\n\nThey will grab people’s attention when they arrive on the page, they will keep their attention as they scroll down, and they’ll help seduce readers before they reach your “buy” button.\n\nJust look at this headline on Ramit Sethi’s sales page for his product 50 Proven Email Scripts (which also has a power word in its name):\n\nAnd as you scroll down, you see he keeps using power words throughout his sales page.\n\nHis headline is followed by emotion-packed subheads:\n\nAnd he even uses power words in his guarantee:\n\n9. Using Power Words in Testimonials\n\nPower words are also tremendously effective in testimonials.\n\nOf course, I’m not suggesting you change people’s testimonials to include power words. But you can certainly select the ones that already use them to great effect.\n\nJust look at this example from Betty Means Business:\n\nOr look at this one from Farideh’s blog:\n\nAnd here’s another example from Renegade Planner:\n\nAll these testimonials will lend extra credibility and excitement due to their power words and phrases.\n\n10. Using Power Words in Bullet Lists\n\nMany sales pages include a list of benefits of the product they’re selling. Many opt-in forms include a huge list of reasons you should sign up to their email list. And many case studies use bullet lists to quickly summarize information.\n\nYou can use power words in these lists to inspire more excitement in your reader as they read through them.\n\nHere’s one example from Ramit Sethi’s sales page for his How to Talk to Anyone course:\n\nAnd here’s another example from an opt-in form on Restart Your Style:\n\nWithout these power words, these lists wouldn’t convince nearly as many prospects to buy or subscribe.\n\n11. Using Power Words in Button Copy and CTA (Call to Action Words)\n\nYep, you can use power words in your CTA button copy too — even if you only have a few words you can fit in there.\n\nOne of the most common power words used in buttons is “Free” (as in the example below):\n\nBut you can be more creative with buttons than you might think.\n\nTakes this button from the sales page for the book The Renegade Diet:\n\n“Immediate,” “Money Back,” and “Guarantee” are all incredibly powerful words, and the author manages to squeeze them all into one button.\n\nHere’s an example from Tim Ferris:\n\nHe could’ve used “Send Me the List” as most people would do, but the specific word “Unlock” makes it sound a lot more intriguing — like you’re getting access to something that’s been kept hidden away.\n\nNow take a look at the buttons on your site.\n\nDo you see any opportunities to spruce them up with a power word?\n\n12. Using Power Words in Author Bios\n\nYour author bio is another extremely important part of your marketing strategy.\n\nWhen you guest post for another blog (or write a paid article as a freelancer), your author bio has the difficult job of making readers want to know more about you so they click through to your site.\n\nThat means your author bio needs to spark attention and interest. And you usually only get three sentences, so you need to carefully consider the words you use.\n\nAs an example, here’s the author bio from Henneke Duistermaat in her ultimate guide on overcoming writer’s block:\n\nHenneke’s author bio is full of power words. It shows her uniqueness and makes her stand out from other copywriters.\n\nYou can tell she has carefully picked each perfect word for maximum impact.\n\nHere’s another example from Sarah Peterson’s post on blog ads:\n\nShe opens strong immediately by mentioning her guides are insanely useful. And just the name of her report alone is full of power words: “Free,” “Reveal,” and “Begging.”\n\nMakes you want to get your hands on that report, doesn’t it?\n\n13. Using Power Words on YouTube Videos\n\nIf you’re publishing videos on YouTube and you want to get more views, you should use power words in your titles.\n\nAll the biggest YouTube channels do this.\n\nThey understand most of their views will come from their subscribers finding them in their feeds, and from people finding them in the sidebar of other videos.\n\nIn both cases, you’re competing with many other videos for their attention.
