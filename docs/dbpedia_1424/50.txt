In 1985, Lionel Richie approached Jones with the idea of an all-star concert tour to benefit African famine relief. Jones had another thought. "I said, 'Why aren't we doing records instead? A tour can be a nightmare.' So we decided to do a record," Jones told CNBC.

Combining common sense with creativity, Jones knew exactly when all the stars would be available. "I said, 'Okay, the practical time to do it would be after the American Music Awards. Everybody will be in town.'"

And they certainly were. Everyone from Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen. With Jones producing, "We Are The World" went on to become one of the biggest selling singles of all time, and raised $63 million.

Label: Epic

Certification: Platinum

Release Date: Feb. 14, 1983

Weeks at No. 1: Three

Grammy Recognition: Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male; Record of the Year

"Bung! Bung! Bong. Bong. Bung! Bung! Boooooooong." The opening strains of Jackson's "Beat It" are among the most recognizable of the early 1980s, not to mention the wailing guitar solo by the legendary Eddie Van Halen (whose contract did not allow him to appear in Jackson's famous video).

The song not only was a huge success for Jackson — it spent more time on Billboard's Hot 100 chart than any other single in Jackson's long career — but also became a coup for musical satirist "Weird Al" Yankovic. His Beat It parody "Eat It" went gold, his only certified gold hit of the 1980s according to RIAA.
