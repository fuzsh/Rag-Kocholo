        "text": "Actors Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara have been a couple since 2016.\n\nThe Joker star and Girl With the Dragon Tattoo actress first met while filming Her back in 2012.\n\nThe pair confirmed their engagement in 2019.\n\nJoaquin and Rooney welcomed their first child, a son named River (in honor of Joaquin's late brother), this fall.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, 45, and Rooney Mara, 35, may keep their relationship pretty private, but there are some details we know about them as a couple.\n\nMost recently, the pair welcomed their first child together, a son named River. Per People, the name was chosen in honor of Joaquin's late brother, River Phoenix, who died in 1993. It was Russian filmmaker Victor Kossakovsky who shared the wonderful news and revealed the child's name at the 2020 Zurich Film Festival.\n\nIn May 2020, Page Six reported that Rooney and Joaquin were expecting a baby (though, neither Rooney nor Phoenix confirmed the news at the time).\n\nThe two famously met on the set of in 2012, and Joaquin was smitten with Rooney from the very beginning, (although he thought she \"despised\" him). “She’s the only girl I ever looked up on the internet,” he told Vanity Fair. “We were just friends, email friends. I’d never done that. Never looked up a girl online.”\n\nJoaquin and Rooney at the ’Her’ photo call for the Rome Film Festival in 2013.\n\nTheir relationship stood strictly platonic for years after that. In fact, in 2014, Joaquin told David Letterman that he was engaged to his yoga instructor. This, however, turned out to be a lie.\n\n“I think like my life’s so boring, and it seemed like something exciting to talk about, and I wanted the audience to like me,\" he told George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America. \"They really like people getting married. I thought, I can say I’m getting married. I can get engaged again, if you like?”\n\nLittle did he know, he would be engaged again for real, soon after he reunited with Rooney for the movie in 2016.\n\nJoaquin and Rooney starring in ’Mary Magdalene.’\n\n\"I was looking for something meaningful,\" Joaquin told about his decision to play Jesus in the film. \"I was looking for an experience. I was friends with Rooney.’\"\n\nAccording to W Magazine, Joaquin and Rooney began dating right after the film wrapped and made their official debut at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival closing ceremony. That year, the also reported that the couple was living together in Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles.\n\nJoaquin and Rooney at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival closing ceremony.\n\nIn 2018, the pair continued to step out together from time to time, like when star showed her support for Joaquin at a screening of Amazon Studios's in April 2018. Even still, Us Weekly reported that despite being \"so in love\" they had no plans to get married.\n\n\"They think marriage is too mainstream,\" a \"source\" told the publication, while later adding, \"They don’t really like to go out. They mainly just like to be with each other as the two of them. They’re in their own bubble.”\n\nJoaquin and Rooney at the 2020 Golden Globes."
