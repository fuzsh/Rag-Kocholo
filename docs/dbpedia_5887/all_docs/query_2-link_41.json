The British academy responded with a seven-month review. Also nominated are Lee Isaac Chung for the family drama “Minari” and Thomas Vinterberg for the Danish dark comedy “Another Round.”More films were nominated, too. ___AP's Hilary Fox contributed to this report from London___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nShe’s only the second woman in the history of the Globes to win, and the first since Barbra Streisand won for “Yentl” in 1984.

Truth is, people turned to culture of all kinds in 2020 — highbrow and lowbrow — to satisfy varied and sometimes conflicting needs: Distraction, inspiration, consolation, escapism, hope. A Broadway star serenaded health workers from his apartment window, and ballet dancers performed “Swan Lake” from their bathtubs. The world mourns an actor of immense talent who, like many of his characters, radiated a regal sense of dignity.\n\nLONDON – Britain’s film academy is shaking up its membership and its awards voting rules in a review prompted by the glaring lack of diversity in the nominations. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts promised to change after contenders for the 2020 awards were announced last January. The measures include recruiting 1,000 new members from under-represented groups to join the current 6,700-strong voting academy of film-industry professionals. The academy has also changed the rules for the British Academy Film Awards, introducing a new “longlist” round in the voting before the selection of the final nominees. For the best film prize, academy members will choose a 15-film longlist that all members must watch before voting for the winner.\n\n(CNN) - \"Joker,\" the gritty comic book film about the origins of the crazed Batman villain, has become the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. \"R-Rated box office congratulatory posts aren't like the ones you're used to,\" Reynolds tweeted with a photo of Phoenix's Joker dancing above names of characters from other successful R-rated films like \"It\" and \"Ted.\" The film may be the highest-grossing R-rated film globally, but it still has a long way to before beating the highest-grossing R-rated film domestically. \"Joker\" shattered box office records when it opened earlier this month to $96 million in North America. The film won the Venice Film Festival's top prize and critics have raved about Phoenix's performance, which has led to Oscar talk.\n\nCNNNEW YORK (CNN) - Are the \"Joker\" stairs the new \"Rocky\" stairs? Fans of the \"Joker,\" which hit theaters earlier this month, are taking photos in front of those stairs. Joker, portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, dances down the stairs as Gary Glitter's \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" plays in the background. \"Always put a happy face...\" wrote Arnaldo Silva in the caption of his \"Joker\" dance impression. Shout out to James May, who went for the basic tourist photo standing in front of the stairs.\n\nSome viewers are outraged because the song he dances to was made by a convicted pedophile. Warner Brothers has been slammed because critics have been concerned that Glitter would get paid for the movie's use of his song. But apparently, Glitter no longer owns the rights to the song and won't get a penny. We've had no contact with him, according to a statement from Snapper Music, which now owns the song.

In the film that shattered box office records over the weekend, Phoenixs sinister character explains he has a condition that causes him to laugh uncontrollably. It's called pseudobulbar affect, also known as PBA, and it's a neurological condition characterized by uncontrollable laughing and/or crying outbursts.

Amy Sussman/WireImageIn an interview with Vanity Fair, Phoenix admitted that he thought Mara despised him while they were working together. While Mara took the starring role, Phoenix played Jesus.

The Wayne family is established early on in the story, with Arthur's mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), writing to businessman-turned-politico Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) asking for financial assistance. That's right: Batman and Joker are half-brothers, at least according to Penny. Movie-goers are now twisting the Batman canon with their own theories, one of which says that Phoenix's Joker is not actually the Joker but a predecessor who inspires another Joker to emerge, a Joker who will become Batman's longtime foe. RELATED CONTENT:How Joaquin Phoenix Perfected His 'Joker' Laugh (Exclusive)Will There Be a 'Joker' Sequel?\n\nJoker only just arrived in theaters, but it's already the most controversial movie of the year. Director Todd Phillips' origin story -- about a disturbed wannabe comedian, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), who will become DC's Clown Prince of Crime -- is either the best film of the year or dangerously reckless, with few opinions falling in the middle. At the Venice Film Festival, where it had its premiere, Joker received an eight-minute standing ovation. Joker was announced as a standalone film outside WB's ongoing DC Extended Universe, but is a sequel something Phillips is interested in?

The result is like one of the Joker's \"HA HAHA HA HA\" speech bubbles from the comics brought to life, though the process to find it weighed on Phoenix. \"I asked Todd to come over to my house to audition the laugh, and he said that wasn't necessary. \"But a lot of it wasn't choreographed,\" Phoenix added. Instead, he found inspiration in vaudeville star Ray Bolger's performance of \"The Old Soft Shoe\" and found himself channeling Bolger's movements.\n\nIn the clip, an irritated Phoenix is seemingly trying to concentrate and cursing while complaining about a man named Larry. \"I'm trying to, like, find something real.\" I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry you guys had to see that.\" \"So it was wrong of me, I'm sorry, but he shouldn't have done it.\"\n\nJoaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara didn't hit it off right away. Amy Sussman/WireImageIn addition to his relationship with Rooney, Joaquin also opens up about his unusual upbringing in a cult before his family moved to Florida, then Hollywood, then back to the Sunshine State. \"We were in Florida, we were in the kitchen, and he said, 'Youre going to be an actor and youre going to be more well known than I am,'\" Joaquin recalls. Despite the controversial nature of making a movie that's seemingly sympathetic to its villain, Joaquin finds \"value\" in the role. Rooney, Joaquin adds, also celebrated his role in the movie.\n\nOn Saturday, Joaquin Phoenix was joined by longtime girlfriend Rooney Mara at the lavish premiere of his new film, Joker. He also sported a mustache and beard at the rollout for the film, which earned him the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and is already attracting awards season buzz.

The acclaimed leading man sat down with ET's Ash Crossan to discuss losing over 50 pounds in order to take on the titular character in DC's upcoming origin film, Joker, and how the transformation informed his performance. It was bit of a conversation and then he just started losing the weight and he lost, I think, 52 pounds. You hear Joker and I think anybody has their idea of what they think the film will be.

Blood-curdling screams echoed through a California neighborhood when a real estate agent came under attack while showing a house. For more Inside Edition stories tune in to today's show.\n\nTitled \"Joker,\" Phoenix stars as failed comedian Arthur Fleck, who ultimately becomes the comic book villain. Several victims of the 2012 mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, are expressing their concerns in particular. The film feels like a \"slap in the face,\" Sandy Phillips, whose daughter was killed in Aurora, told The Hollywood Reporter. \"I don't think it's the responsibility of a filmmaker to teach the audience morality or the difference between right or wrong,\" Phoenix told IGN. Relatives of those killed in the Aurora shooting are asking Warner Brothers, the studio behind the film, to donate to anti-gun violence causes.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures via CNN(CNN) - A group of people whose loved ones witnessed or were killed in 2012's Aurora theater shooting are calling on Warner Bros. to help combat gun violence as the studio prepares to release its rated-R comic book film \"Joker.\" (Warner Bros., like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.) \"Over the last several weeks, large American employers from Walmart to CVS have announced that they are going to lean into gun safety. Shooter James Holmes is currently serving multiple life sentences for the shooting, which killed 12 and injured 70. Warner Bros. has not responded to CNN's e-mailed request for comment.\n\nThe Joker premiere at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival on Monday got an extra dose of star power! Bradley Cooper graced the red carpet of the DC film, posing with the film's cast, including Joaquin Phoenix, who plays the Clown Prince of Crime. Although his appearance was a surprise to fans, the 44-year-old leading man wasn't merely there to show his support -- he's a producer on the project. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August, where it earned the Golden Lion jury award and sweeping acclaim for Phoenix's portrayal of villainous titular character.
