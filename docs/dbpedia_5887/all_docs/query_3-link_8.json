        "text": "Rain Phoenix is the second child and first daughter born to Arlyn and John Bottom. At a young age, she and her brother River Phoenix were singing on the streets of South America for money for their growing family. As the years carried on, Rain became a big sister to brother, Joaquin, and sister, Liberty. When Arlyn was pregnant with Rain's youngest sister, Summer, the Bottom family were moving back to the United States and changed their name to 'Phoenix', to commemorate their new beginning. With a love of nature and animals, the Phoenixes decided to become vegans. A short while later, all five talented Phoenix children were signed to agent Iris Burton.\n\nOver the years, Rain has starred along celebrities like Julia Stiles, Josh Hartnett and Uma Thurman. Her love of music has lead her to appear in such bands as Aleka's Attic, whom her brother River was also in, The Causey Way with her sister Summer and her band, The Paper Cranes with her husband, Michael Tubbs. She also toured with the Red Hot Chilli Peppers as a backup singer during their 'One Hot Minute' tour in 1996. A good friend of Michael Stipe, they have collaborated together on many projects (including the soundtrack to Happiness, and several REM songs)."
