        "text": "Let’s say you and your buddy had two Oscars and six nominations between you, and you wanted to go in on a place in Manhattan together. Money is no object. What kind of place would you choose? A West Village charmer? A discreet Upper East Side co-op? A shiny glass condo overlooking Central Park? Well, actors Joaquin Phoenix and Casey Affleck chose…Canal Street.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix & Casey Affleck’s NYC Crash Pad\n\nIt’s no surprise that these two A-listers known for their quirky roles and out-there personas are also a little left of center when it comes to real-estate choices. According to the New York Post, the pair bought this rather industrial loft at 533 Canal Street back when Affleck, brother of fellow Oscar winner Ben, was married to one of Phoenix’s sisters, Summer. (I know. Hollywood is confusing.) So they were brothers-in-law at the time, a true family affair.\n\nThe cavernous space was originally listed in 2017 for $3,895,000, then reappeared on the market in 2019 for $3,750,000. In October it underwent a 7% price drop to $3.495 million. The sale closed in mid-April for a reported $3.13 million, so it looks like the home took a third trim in price somewhere along the way.\n\nIn any case, the duplex loft has 11.5-foot ceilings and fantastic Hudson River views from the massive living room. It’s got a master suite upstairs, which includes an office space and a full bath (with a skylight directly over the toilet, because where else would you want one?). Downstairs on the main level is another bedroom with an ensuite bath but no windows, curiously. There’s also a “media” area that seems to be counted as a third (also windowless — and doorless) bedroom, a third full bath, and not one but two kitchens.\n\nA unique layout to say the least! I can’t help but wonder who got to crash in the bedroom with the window, Joaquin Phoenix or Casey Affleck & Summer Phoenix? But the views are certainly undeniable — and hey, check out that cool hanging chair!\n\nAbout Hudson Square\n\nNot to be confused with the similarly named Hudson Yards farther uptown, Hudson Square is a relatively new Manhattan neighborhood nestled between SoHo, the West Village, and Tribeca. For a long time this area was considered a no man’s land at the mouth of the Holland Tunnel. But these days Hudson Square is hopping, with a construction boom and a nascent tech district boasting offices for companies like Google and Disney."
