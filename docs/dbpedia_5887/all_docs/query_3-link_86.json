        "text": "Joaquin Phoenix recently spoke with Jamie Graham at The Times about his son River and Veganism.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix has been vegan since he was four years old, after a family cargo ship trip. It left the Phoenix family in distress after witnessing the brutal treatment and murder of fish whilst onboard. Since then Joaquin has continued his Veganism and has campaigned for Animal Rights and Welfare through media and events with Animal Rights Groups such as The Save Movement and Animal Equality.\n\nIn 2020, Joaquin and Rooney Mara welcomed their Son, River to the world. In the brand new interview with The Times, Joaquin shared his thoughts on his Son’s future and independent decisions regarding what food lifestyle he may want to lead:\n\n“Well, certainly I would hope that [he is vegan], but I’m not going to impose my belief on my child,” he says. “I don’t think that’s right. I’m going to educate him about the reality. I’m not going to indoctrinate him with the idea that McDonald’s have a Happy Meal because there’s nothing f***ing happy about that meal. And I’m not going to tell him that it’s OK to read books about all the wonderful little farm animals, and they say ‘oink oink oink’ and ‘moo moo moo’, and not tell him that that’s what a hamburger is. So I’m not going to perpetuate the lie, but I’m also not going to force him to be vegan. I’ll support him. That’s my plan.”"
