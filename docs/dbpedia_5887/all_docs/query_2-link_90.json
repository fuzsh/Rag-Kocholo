        "text": "‘WE OWN THE NIGHT” is a tug-of-war tale about a son being pulled in different directions by his cop-heavy family and his Russian mob-connected employers, his “second family.”\n\nIt would be nothing more than sturdy entertainment were it not for the presence of Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg, playing brothers and reunited with their director from “The Yards,” James Gray.\n\nWahlberg is Joe, “the good son,” the cop — a New York police captain in charge of a unit looking into the power-grabs by Russian expats, new to America’s drug wars.\n\nPhoenix is Bobby, the “bad seed” and the focus of the film. He’s the guy who ran away from his family’s ethnic surname, the one who turned his back on the force and became a bartender who is now manager of El Caribe, a converted church that is one of the city’s hottest nightspots.\n\nBobby works hard, parties hard and loves hard (Eva Mendes is his lady). He uses a little coke, drinks a little booze, keeps the peace in the club and steers clear of the shadier relatives of the kindly old Russian fur merchant who owns the joint.\n\nBut The Family wants the son to take sides.\n\n“Either you’re gonna be with us, or you’re gonna be with the drug dealers,” his police chief dad (Robert Duvall, flawless in a conventional role) lectures him.\n\nBobby wants to know, “Why is this my problem?” And then a bust at the club, a mob-leader is crossed, reprisals start and guilt and responsibility pull Bobby into the fray, even though the Russians who think of him as their family don’t know his real family is NYPD blue.\n\nWriter-director James Gray returns to his Little Odessa roots for this period piece about the rise of the Russian mob in New York’s Brighton Beach and the efforts of New York’s finest to fight this new and ruthless threat. He ratchets up the suspense and stages a masterful car chase in the rain with the water-muted sounds of tires and gunfire and the tunnel-vision of death seen through the wiper-blades.\n\nBut this is strictly “The Departed Lite,” a police procedural that’s heavy on tone, supporting players and mood. The film is terrific at taking us inside how police decisions about whom to go after and when are made, which is realistically more inept, gut-reaction-driven than we’d like to think.\n\nGray does a weak job of throwing Bobby into a tug-of-war between families even as he surprises us with the places he takes us in the third act. Though he fills the police ranks with veteran actors who look the part (a grizzled Tony Musante turns up) and even got’80s New York mayor Ed Koch to pretend he was still the mayor, Gray didn’t cast a villain (Alex Veadov) with enough weight to balance the story.\n\nWahlberg’s role is a shell of the one he got to play in “The Departed,” but Phoenix is firing on all cylinders as a man overwhelmed by the situation he finds himself and his girlfriend in. Phoenix strips away the pose and makes Bobby a guy whose nerves are right on the surface of the performance. He holds his own with the great Duvall, creates a real heat and warmth in his scenes with Mendes, and he and Wahlberg play as if their real history was not unlike the fictional one played out here.\n\nPhoenix classes up “We Own the Night” to the point where that title isn’t a joke. Yeah, he owns it. The rest of this movie is merely leasing it until the next cop film comes along."
