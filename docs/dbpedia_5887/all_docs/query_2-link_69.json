The Super Mario Bros Movie has had an astounding second weekend and if you have not seen it and are a fan of Nintendo’s best, go see it, it runs very fast and there are so many in jokes, you’ll be buying the Blu and freezing it a million times.\n\nBut you know my other love? Leaf Phoenix. Joaquin Phoenix. I was a lover of his brother’s films and now the family has another big star. From Parenthood to Joker, I have been on board this train. Now, Phoenix has had an incredible weekend for Beau Is Afraid. Now, I know we look at billion gains in the recent times, but this is all relative when you are talking about the indie films. Beau Is Afraid has made more than eighty thousand dollars on each screen and it was only open on four screens, so this looks like it might open big when it goes nationwide on Friday for American fans."
