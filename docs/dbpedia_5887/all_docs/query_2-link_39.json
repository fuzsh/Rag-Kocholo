        "text": "Chimps share 98% of our DNA. They are similar to humans emotionally, physically—even creatively. Some of our residents enjoy abstract painting as an enrichment activity. To spotlight the artistry of apes and to raise funds for the sanctuary, we are partnering with Redwood Art Group to present a collection of paintings by chimps curated by human artists.\n\nFor Art Expo New York, Hollywood titans Joaquin Phoenix and his wife Rooney Mara collaborated with ape artists to curate the Joaquin Phoenix & Rooney Mara Save the Chimps Collection. Many of the 16 pieces are based on the vivid color schemes of Joaquin’s Oscar-winning Joker character. Joaquin and Rooney painted the base coats and then chose color combos for the chimps to use. FedEx Cares donated the shipment of the paintings from LA to the Florida sanctuary then onto Manhattan, where they will debut at Art Expo New York, April 4-7. All sales benefit Save the Chimps.\n\n“We hope these paintings will raise much-needed funds for Save the Chimps’ sanctuary and deepen people’s appreciation of these intelligent apes. Chimps are our closest relatives in the animal world. They share 98% of our DNA, so it’s no surprise that some chimps find it therapeutic to paint, much like some humans do.”"
