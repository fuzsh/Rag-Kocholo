        "text": "American actress Rooney Mara is expecting her second child with her longtime partner, Joaquin Phoenix. Mara shared the big news as she flaunted her baby bump at the Berlin Film Festival in Germany on Friday night.\n\nMara, 38, stepped out to attend the premiere of her movie La Cocina (The Kitchen) at the ongoing film festival. The Side Effects actress put her baby bump on display in the black-strapless voluminous gown by Givenchy.\n\nThe actress was captured cradling her baby bump as she posed for shutterbugs at the festival. This will be Mara's second child with the Joker star.\n\nThe couple has not made any official statement yet.\n\nOscar-winning actor Phoenix and his fiancee, actress Rooney, welcomed their first child together, a baby boy named River, in August 2020. At the time of their first child, the couple maintained a low profile. Phoenix named his son after his late brother and actor, River Phoenix.\n\nJoaquin and Rooney got engaged in May 2019 after dating for years. They first met on the set of the movie Her. The couple has kept their personal life relatively away from the spotlight and refrained from sharing any details about their family and kid.\n\nManoj Bajpayee attends Berlin Film Festival 2024 for the premiere of his film The Fable\n\nYears after giving birth to her first child, Mara spoke candidly about her son, River, on the LaunchLeft podcast.\n\n\"It feels like a creative household, we're constantly talking about creative things,\" she said. \"It doesn't feel like a two-actor house because I didn't work for the first three and a half years we were together. Basically, since we've been together, I only worked one or two times and one was really small and short.\""
