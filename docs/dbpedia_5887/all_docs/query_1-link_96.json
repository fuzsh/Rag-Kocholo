        "text": "River Phoenix has been remembered by his younger brother Joaquin in a touching tribute as the actor named his newborn baby after the late actor.\n\nGladiator star Joaquin, 45, has welcomed a baby boy with his partner Rooney Mara and the couple honoured his late brother by calling the tot River.\n\nThe birth comes 27 years after River's tragic death aged 23, which sent a shockwave through Hollywood and left his family devastated.\n\nThe tragic actor grew up as River Bottom - his real last name - along with brother Leaf - who later changed his name to Joaquin - and sisters Rain, Liberty and Summer.\n\nThe kids didn't attend formal school, but River showed a flair for the creative arts, learning guitar.\n\nThe family joined a Christian cult called Children of God, but left in the late 1970s and moved to Florida where they ditched their last name of Bottom and rebranded themselves the Phoenix family to signify their fresh start.\n\nAfter relocating to Los Angeles, a talent scout spotted the siblings singing for change on the street and signed them up.\n\nRiver started his showbiz career appearing in adverts before moving into acting roles as a child star.\n\nHe landed a series of small parts before landing his breakout role in 1986 movie classic Stand By Me.\n\nAt just 15 years old, River had a starring role in the coming-of-age drama which hit cinemas in 1986.\n\nHis movie career took off and just two years later, he landed an Oscar nomination for his role in 1988's Running on Empty.\n\nRiver didn't win, but the Academy Award honour propelled his career to new heights.\n\nHe continued working, landing a role as the young Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and winning acclaim for his turn in Gus Van Sant's My Own Private Idaho.\n\nAs well as movies, River kept his love of music into adulthood and played with a number of bands including P - with his pal Johnny Depp and Red Hot Chili Peppers star Flea.\n\nIn October 1993, the actor flew back to Los Angeles from a movie shoot in New Mexico and organised to play with P at The Viper Room - the club co-owned by Depp on the Sunset Strip.\n\nDuring the night out, the young actor ingested a cocktail of drugs and fell ill in the club.\n\nHe was helped outside by his sister Rain and brother Joaquin, but River began having seizures on the pavement.\n\nJoaquin called emergency services and was heard pleading for help for his brother in a frantic 911 call.\n\nParamedics rushed to the scene and attempted to resuscitate River.\n\nThe actor was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nA coroner's report later revealed River died of \"acute multiple drug intoxication\" with both morphine and cocaine found in his system along with marijuana, Valium and an over-the-counter cold medicine.\n\nThe tragedy haunted Joaquin, and he rarely spoke about it in the following years.\n\nHe later opened up about River in an emotional interview on US TV show 60 Minutes.\n\nThe Oscar winner said: \"I feel like in virtually every movie that I made, there was a connection to River in some way.\n\n\"And I think that weâ€™ve all felt his presence and guidance in our [the family's] lives in numerous ways.\""
