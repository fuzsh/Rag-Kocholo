        "text": "More than 18 years after his death in Hollywood at age 23, actor River Phoenix's family has turned a nonprofit organization he started nine months before he died into a Gainesville center to promote peace in his name.\n\nWhile family members had valued their privacy about River, his mother, Heart Phoenix, said they wanted to \"create the continuing story of who River really was, not how he died.\" River died on Oct. 31, 1993, in Los Angeles in what an autopsy concluded was an accidental drug-related death.\n\n\"We wanted to do something in his honor, and we weren't quite sure what it would be,\" Heart Phoenix, a Gainesville-area resident for the past few decades, said in a recent interview.\n\nThen, it clicked.\n\nAlready lobbying the federal government to add a Cabinet-level secretary of peace, Phoenix said she decided to start at the local level.\n\nThe River Phoenix Center for Peacebuilding opened last year, and while there isn't yet a walk-in office, it is up and running, providing mediation and communication programs through local schools, teaming up with University of Florida law students and working on partnerships with the State Attorney's Office to curb the cycles of violence — schoolyard, criminal, domestic or otherwise.\n\nPhoenix and the executive director of the center, Dorothy \"Dot\" Maver, said there already are a number of organizations and individuals working in this area locally, like homeless advocates, the United Way, the Early Learning Coalition and a host of others. Their idea, though, is to provide coordination to the efforts in hopes of penetrating the community that much deeper.\n\nThe goal is to start in Gainesville before opening centers around the country, then the world, Maver said.\n\nRiver Phoenix was a boy when he hit the big screen in films like \"Stand by Me,\" ultimately earning an Academy Award nomination for his part in \"Running on Empty\" in 1989 and being hoisted onto a pedestal that allowed him to draw attention to issues he cared about like environmental protection and animal rights.\n\nHeart Phoenix said her son had a way to reach young people that many other celebrities couldn't. He was a teen idol with a message. He signed his name with a peace symbol.\n\n\"That was a great way to get the attention of the world,\" she said. \"He recognized at such a young age that everyone has a contribution to offer.\"\n\nMaver and Phoenix said Gainesville was a natural place to set up the center.\n\nFirst, the nonprofit organization that River established in 1993, Eco-Rica Preservation Inc., was already established in Florida. It even had a little seed money left over, so for Heart, it's like she is continuing River's work.\n\nThen, there's the city itself: The family is comfortable in Gainesville.\n\n\"It's so open and progressive in so many ways,\" said Heart Phoenix, who lives here with her husband, Jeffrey Weisberg, a Gainesville mediator who serves as the director of programs and outreach.\n\nWhile River's younger brother, Joaquin Phoenix, has carried the acting torch, his sister Liberty Phoenix Lord owns a green-building business here.\n\nBoth have roles in the center, with Joaquin on the board of directors and Liberty its office manager.\n\nHeart Phoenix worked with Maver at the Peace Alliance in Washington, where the latter was the executive director before leaving for the River Phoenix Center.\n\nMaver said the organization can be a catalyst for change in the community, building upon programs already in place.\n\n\"We're not reinventing the wheel,\" she said.\n\nWhile most people think of peace on a national or global scale, Maver said it is very much a local thing.\n\n\"Peace is living in health relative with self, others and the world around us,\" she said, noting that even environmental sustainability measures are crucial to a harmonious community.\n\nWeisberg said the center is dedicated to stopping cycles of violence, many of which stem from children raised in violent or fatherless homes.\n\nBut, he said, when those youth are guided, they can overcome their upbringings and become nonviolent, productive people.\n\n\"What we see is they really rise to the occasion,\" Weisberg said.\n\nThe problem has been the lack of funding for the kinds of programs that can intervene in violent situations and prevent future bloodshed, Heart Phoenix said.\n\nShe said she hopes the center can help fill in those gaps.\n\nSpeaking about the dearth of money for anti-violence programs, she said: \"That is not practical. Peace is practical.\""
