        "text": "A batter seemingly born for the modern game, Tristan Stubbs is known for his fearless approach to batting. But there is more to him than just big-hitting. Stubbs also takes an energetic approach to longer-formats, and within four years of making his first-class debut, averaged over 50 in it.\n\nSchooled at Grey High School in Gqeberha, Stubbs was the captain of the first team. He was also the leading run-scorer at the 2018 Khaya Majola Cricket week, an Under-19 tournament in South Africa, and was selected for the SA Schools side. Stubbs did not make the South Africa Under-19 squad, but was instead selected to make his provincial debut for Eastern Province in January 2020.\n\nOn reputation, Stubbs was signed by Mumbai Indians (MI) for IPL 2022, before he had made his T20I debut, which eventually came in June 2022. He only played four matches for MI over two seasons, before moving to Delhi Capitals in 2024, where he was their second-highest run-scorer that year. Stubbs was also part of South Africa's T20 World Cup squad in 2024.\n\nIn the longer formats, he was the second-highest run-getter in the 2022-23 domestic one-day competition, and the second-highest in the 2023-24 domestic first-class competition, thanks largely to his 302* against Kwa-Zulu Natal Inland, scored off 372 balls. Stubbs made his Test debut against India in January 2024, and was earmarked to take over the No. 3 position later that year."
