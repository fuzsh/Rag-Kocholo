We were greeted with true traditional OBH hospitality, so many familiar faces. Justin welcomed us,such a gentleman. Check-in started with a glass of bubbly, and our glorious weekend began. We were welcomed to our beautiful sea facing room with a Bouchard Finlayson Chardonnay on ice and a mini cheese board( was a wine of choice on our wedding day). We enjoyed long breakfasts soaking up OBH( thank-you Sebastian for your impeccable service and banter‚ò∫Ô∏è). Justin popped by our table to wish us a happy anniversary. Thank you. We attended the Dinner Dance in the evening ,oh my goodness,new additions to the menu absolutely sublime,well done chef. We enjoyed a complimentary bottle of Bouchard Finlayson Hannibal,divine wine. George Sekulias was a wonderful sommelier & Maitre d' in The Grill Room. Morren Dlamini,we shared a few laughs. What a gentleman. So many people to thank for making our stay really beautiful. Thank you all. We met Skabenga after so long. What a handsome chap,so glad we had the opportunity to see him( stay well boy). Good to see you Rashid,Muzi & Sunshine up at the Light House Bar. If you're thinking of getting married at OBH, do it,it's a once in a lifetime experience ,Ginny Eslick is the best wedding planner ever. Thank you from Graeme & Charmaine Williams. See you soon.\n\n- 928charmainep\n\nWe recently visited the OBH to celebrate my mother‚Äôs 80th birthday. I knew it would be special but the Oyster Box went above and beyond to make this a truly magical and spectacular experience! From delectable in-room chocolate cakes, champagne & wine we were spoiled with more treats than we could consume! Every little detail was attended to and made extra special. The breakfast offering is truly world-class and the High Tea the best in the country as far as I am concerned. The attentiveness shown by the staff is exceptional and nothing is too much trouble. A special thank you to Michelle, Ryan at breakfast and Richard in the foyer for amazing service. You are part of a team of professionals that the OBH can be proud of. Even the celebrity cat, Skabenga, allowed us to pat him and he even purred! We travelled extensively abroad and in SA and I can honestly say that the OBH is proudly flying the South African flag high in terms of value for money, overall quality & service excellence. I am SO glad I chose the Oyster Box for this occasion and our family decided that the OBH will be the one and only place to celebrate landmark occasions in the future!\n\n- BianceJohannesburg\n\n4.2/5Very Good21 Reviews\n\nAmanzimtoti|2.49km from city center\n\nA good place to be with a beautiful view.... ‚ÄùThe View‚Äù as its name . Closer to a shopping complex , gas station, 5min drive to the beach, closer to the beach there also restaurantswhere you can dine whole having the beach view, Toti Beach. its also closer to galleria Mall. The place is too steep so be ready for that... Their food is delicious, we had dinner there at their restaurant called Giorgios but its expensive I must say. Not sure about their breakfast and lunch though. Staff and reception is just ok. I had requested them to add a crib bed for a child and upon arrival they told us that the storeroom is closed because we arrived at 6pm so it's too late. We then asked them to give us atleast a bedsheets or any linen so we can make a plan for our son, they said ok but never pitched , nothin, not even getting back to us to say what could be the matter. We asked again the following day, they took four hours to bring a bedsheets. Bottom line is if you have a child do not, I repeat DO NOT book that place because they will lie straight to your face saying they could not reach you since you booked via an APP. I'm not sure whetherI want to talk about their kitchen in the rooms. You will have to call them now and again to bring things and they take 3 to 4hours just for a simple thing like a spoon. One thing I can say is they don't listen and listening means you respect your business and your clients I flew from overseas to rest and have a good time and have treat ourselves since they have a spar but I ended up canceling my plans for a spa because I didn't want additional dissapointments. The rest I don't even want to mention...and that is my experience after paying so much Money and looking forward to a good vacation üòå BUT...\n\nFrom$47\n\n4.7/5Outstanding69 Reviews\n\nUmhlanga|0.37km from city center\n\nA special return for our 11th wedding anniversary.

This has to be one of the best service I've experienced (local and international included). Wouldn't hesitate to highly recommend this Establishment. Check in was awesome. Brendan and team were extremely Welcoming, Friendly and Efficient. We were settled into the room in no time as well as informed of all the amenities. We traveled as a group and the team helped us to get rooms close to each other which was so convenient. Breakfast was scrumptious and the service exceeded our expectations. Trisha and the team take their work and service to customers so seriously - like it's their own company. My son wanted Chocolate muffins and they baked it specially for him - how amazing is that! We were leaving early to the airport and Trisha offered to have breakfast ready from 5am - was so impressed and grateful. This has to be one of the best hotels across the world. Kudos to the team and leadership. Highly recommend anyone to not hesitate to book here. Thanks so much guys\n\nFrom$63\n\n4.3/5Excellent58 Reviews\n\nDurban Beachfront Durban|1.93km from city center\n\nBooked 2 rooms for my wife and i and my dad over the christmas weekend. We stayed here 3 nights. Loved every moment of it. Breakfast was so awesome i didnt want to leave...spent an hour each day there.. my room was spotless and everything worked perfectly. The view from my room of the indian ocean is so good... i have stayed at this hotel many times over the years and i love that i am staying with someone i know, knowing what to expect , knowing, i will be greeted with a smile, knowing the awesome scent one gets when you enter the hotel lobby. Id like to thank 2 of my friends there natasha and bonga who are OUTSTANDING at what they do. I will be back end of april 2022.\n\nFrom$53\n\n3.9/546 Reviews\n\nDurban Beachfront Durban|1.16km from city center\n\nAt check-in we were welcomed warmly by Mr. Mhize :) Our room was nicely done but deep cleaning is highly needed I mean even bathroom walls have stains which goes to show that training at housekeeping is highly needed. It was not my first time staying at the hotel. Previously we enjoyed breakfast especially when there was an Indian girl working there. This time around their service was just so disgusting!!!! In the first morning I informed the chef in charge that I'm vegetarian and asked if she could prepare anything for me and rudely told me that ‚ÄùI don't know of you except of one guest that I prepared for, reception didn't inform me about you! So I'll give you something little from what I prepared for the vegetarian guest that I know of.‚Äù And indeed she gave me unappetizing less than a fist of fried chips. So much talk for fried potatoes! I am a paying guest and you don't talk to guests like that. When I went to go get something else on the buffet another chef asked me ‚Äùwhere is the plate you were using before?‚Äù REALLY????? I'm so disgusted and disappointed by their service. The chef in charge also kept shouting at a newly employed lady ordering her around with no respect! If you have no respect for your staff do that back of house not in front of guests it's belittling us and lowering your standards. On the second day we hoped for better but it was worse! We dished up our first rounds and I was made mushrooms only, even after I informed them I'd be returning. I believe there's so much more that could've being prepared if the love and passion was there. I went to go dishup again for my fiance and the chef first served the guest behind me and ignored me as if I was not standing in front of her, I saw her leaving one egg and I asked for two and she said ‚Äùsecond rounds are not allowed for eggs, that is why I'm making you one.‚Äù In my whole history of working and staying in hotels never in my entire life have I ever heard of such!!! Breakfast was decreased by an hour. Is it so much work to give good service in ONE HOUR?!\n\nFrom$30"
