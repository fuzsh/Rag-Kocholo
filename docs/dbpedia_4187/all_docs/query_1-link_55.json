        "text": "Justin Snaith will return to Greyville looking for his sixth victory in the Durban July this weekend.\n\nSnaith saddled his first winner in 2008, when Dancers Daughter dead-heated with Pocket Power in a thrilling finish. Since then, Snaith has scored with Legislate, Belgarion and twice with Do It Again - who'll bid for a famous third July on his final start on Saturday.\n\nWith five runners currently in the field, here are Justin Snaith's thoughts on his squad for the 2023 Durban July.\n\n*All quotes taken from Justin Snaith Racing on YouTube*\n\nWithout Question\n\nHe's in a very good space. The big thing for me was coming up to Natal and running a strong race in the Daily News 2000, which I thought he did, he ran a great third. He was third behind Charles Dickens in the Cape Guinneas too and there wasn't much difference between him and the favourite for the Durban July (See It Again).\n\nRichard Fourie has chosen him, which to punters I think is quite a big thing. He's certainly a horse that I think will run a big race.\n\nPacaya\n\nHis first run out in Durban, the Greyville 1900, and after a break, and he won convincingly. He has nailed the weight, coming in at 53kg.\n\nHe's possibly the best-weighted horse in South Africa. Even at level weights, he could take on all of these horses. He runs in a rubber bit, which is unheard of, but that just shows you the type of horse he is and how easy he is to manage.\n\nDo It Again\n\nIt'll be funny when he's not running in the July, one day, because you're just so used to seeing his name in it.\n\nThis will be his sixth run in the Durban July. This will be his swansong, it is his last race and it's the perfect way to end what's been an amazing career.\n\nSilver Darling\n\nShe deserves her opportunity. She needed to come in at the right weight and I think we've nailed it.\n\nIf you look at her form she's got to be, hands down, one of the most consistent horses in the race. There's no pressure on her. It's all systems go.\n\nPomp And Power\n\nThis is certainly the dark horse of the race. He's proven in his entire career that there are moments where he just pops up."
