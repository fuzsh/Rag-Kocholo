        "text": "The 20 horses that will compete in the special event have already been chosen, and the final wagers have been placed on which stallions will compete. This year's Durban July Final field looks to be one for the record books.\n\nLeading as the race favorite is See It Again, weighing 56.5, and ridden by Pierre Strydom. With 33/10 odds, See It Again won the most recent Daily News 2000 race and has been trained by Michael Roberts to win again.\n\nHowever, it will have to outdo some strong competition, including two-time Hollywood Durban July winner Do It Again, who has had 34 runs (including 5 Hollywoodbets Durban July races) and 9 wins and also intends to make 2023 a winning year. Below is a table of the horses, trainers, and jockeys competing in this widely anticipated event:\n\n1.1\n\nHollywoodbets Durban July Final Field Table\n\nDrawHorseJockeyTrainerWeight1Bless My StarsAthandiwe MgudlwaSean Tarry522Without QuestionRichard FourieJustin Snaith54.53Time FliesLuyolo MxothwaBrett Crawford554Winchester MansionKabelo MatsunyaneBrett Crawford535Billy BowlegsSean VealeAlec Laird53.56Do It AgainGavin LerenaJustin Snaith577See It Again (Favorite)Piere StrydomMichael Roberts56.58Silver DarlingJuan Paul v'd MerweJustin Snaith559Son Of RajMuzi YeniWeiho Marwing5310Dave The KingCraig ZackeyMike de Kock55.511Puerto Manzano (ARG)Keagan de MeloJ A Janse van Vuuren5812PacayaGrant van NiekerkJustin Snaith5313Second BaseChase MaujeanRobyn Klaasen56.514Safe PassageChristophe SoumillonMike de Kock5815RascallionCorne OrfferVaughan Marshall57.516Trip Of FortuneAldo DomeyerCandice Bass-Robinson6017Rain In HollandS'manga KhumaloSean Tarry56.518Pomp And PowerBernard Fayd'HerbeJustin Snaith58RESNebraasReserve 1Sean Tarry55RESJimmy DonReserve 2Erico Verdonese53\n\n18 horses will be part of the race, with two being reserves. The Reserves are to be scratched by 8:15, Friday 30th of June. Should a horse in the top 18 not be able to race, it will simply be replaced by the reserve horses.\n\nBet with Hollywoodbets\n\nHollywoodbets Durban July this year is a renewal event, as it's the first Hollywood Durban July to happen unrestricted in 3 years. The event will be at Hollywoodbets Greyville Racecourse in Durban and is expected to have 50, 000 participants.\n\nGrade 1, the race of races with the grand prize of R5 million, is the event everyone will ultimately be anticipating. The Grade 1 special is the 7th race of the day and starts at 1600 p.m. The winner of the race will perform a victory canter, which is when a horse moves faster than a trot but slower than a gallop, which of course represents overcoming other racing opponents, something like a victory lap.\n\nThe Hollywoodbets Durban July winner will enter the Gold Horseshoe Winner’s Box in front of the grandstand, and after that, there’ll be a presentation of silver salvers and sashes.\n\n3.1\n\nHollywoodbets Durban's July 15% Deposit Bonus\n\nThis year's Durban July plans to be out of this world, and with that comes a 15% deposit bonus on all deposits up to R20 000, with the maximum bonus being R3 000. The following conditions apply to this appealing bonus:\n\nThe Durban July 15% bonus promotion will run on all deposits made between June 23, 2023, 00:00 and July 2, 2023, 23:59 which is 10 days;\n\nThe Bonus is only valid for Hollywoodbets account holders;\n\nThe 15% bonus only applies to deposits up to R20,000, so once the maximum bonus of R3 000 is credited to the player's account, no further deposits above R20 000 from the player will qualify for any bonus;\n\nBonuses will be credited to the account only once Hollywoodbets has received the deposit and confirmation of the deposit from the relevant payment provider;\n\nThe HollywoodBets bonus is a great incentive, providing players with more entertainment and winning possibilities.\n\n3.2\n\nHollywoodbets Punters' Challenge\n\nThe Hollywoodbets Punters Challenge, which only applies to Durban's July 1 Hollywoodbets Greyville race day, is available to anyone who is an account holder at Hollywoodbets and wants to stand a chance to win a share of R20 million. The winner will receive R200 000, while the runners-up and 3rd place will receive R80 000 and R40 000, respectively. Players can enter the Punters Challenge at any point, up to 5 minutes before the first race at the respective venue.\n\n3.3\n\nFull Steam Ahead\n\nThe Theme of this year's Hollywood Durban July event is “out of this world,” inviting attendees to be taken to the stars and beyond. The celestial theme intends to make this year's Durban July Spectacular, and with the event having been restricted for the last 3 years due to COVID, this year's event is set to be truly memorable.
