        "text": "SPORT NEWS - There were a few surprises when weights for the 2022 Hollywoodbets Durban July were published on Tuesday – and not due the handicappers.\n\nThe biggest shock was jockey Piere Strydom being declared to ride former July winner Belgarion for trainer Justin Snaith. Strydom has been out of action with injury issues for many a long month and was not considered likely to be fit for the R5-million race at Greyville on Saturday 2 July.\n\nAlso raising eyebrows was the declaration of another former champion, S’Manga Khumalo, to ride two horses – Jet Dark for Snaith and Sparkling Water for keen rival Mike de Kock. Will they arm-wrestle for the services of “Bling”?\n\nAnother surprise was the name of Callan Murray, who has been riding successfully in Hong Kong in recent months. He is down to ride De Kock’s Gold Challenge winner of Saturday, Al Muthana.\n\nMuzi Yeni has been named by De Kock to partner ruling July ante-post betting favourite Safe Passage, recent winner of the Daily News 2000.\n\nFreelance ace Richard Fourie gets the booking on joint-second favourite Pomp And Power for Snaith, while Craig Zackey is engaged for another Snaith hopeful, Hoedspruit.\n\nAldo Domeyer was declared by Snaith aboard his two-time July winner Do It Again. But not any surprises.\n\nDefending champion Kommetdieding and dual Queen’s Plate winner Jet Dark have been allocated joint top impost of 60kg for the Grade 1 contest over 2200m.\n\nThe current 7-2 favourite Safe Passage is set to carry 54.5kg, while joint-second favourites Pomp And Power and Sparkling Water have 53kg and 53.5kg respectively.\n\nThere was one supplementary entry – Andre Nel-trained Airways Law, who won the Saturday’ Grade 3 Cup Trial at Greyville, a “preferential” race for the July selection panel.\n\nOwner Sabine Plattner paid a non-refundable fee of R30,190 for the privilege of being considered for the final line-up, though, strictly on merit rating, he is unlikely to crack the nod.\n\nA total of 35 horses remain in contention for the 18 July running slots, plus two reserves. The final declarations deadline is Monday 20 June at 11am, and the next day final line-up will be announced and the barrier draw made live on television.\n\nThe official, televised July gallops will be held at Greyville on the morning of Thursday 23 June.\n\nDurban July entries, 14 June 2022 (weight, name, MR, equipment, jockey, trainer):\n\n60 Jet Dark 129 A (S’manga Khumalo) Justin Snaith\n\n60 Kommetdieding 129 A (……………) HWJ Crawford/M Rix\n\n59.5 Belgarion 128 A (Piere Strydom) Justin Snaith\n\n58.5 Do It Again 126 A (Aldo Domeyer) Justin Snaith\n\n58.5 Linebacker 126 A (……………) Vaughan Marshall\n\n58 Al Muthana (AUS) 125 A (Callan Murray) Mike de Kock\n\n56.5 Astrix 122 BA (……………) Paul Peter\n\n55.5 Puerto Manzano (ARG) 120 BA (……………) Johan Janse van Vuuren\n\n55.5 Russian Rock 120 A (……………) Dean Kannemeyer\n\n55 Bingwa 119 BA (……………) Johan Janse van Vuuren\n\n54.5 Marina 118 BA (……………) Candice Bass-Robinson\n\n54.5 Nebraas 118 BA (……………) Sean Tarry\n\n54.5 Safe Passage 122 A (Muzi Yeni) Mike de Kock\n\n54.5 Second Base 118 BAM (……………) Johan Janse van Vuuren\n\n54 Zillzaal 117 TA (……………) Sean Tarry\n\n53.5 Crown Towers (AUS) 116 AM (……………) Justin Snaith\n\n53.5 Flying Carpet 116 TBA (……………) Sean Tarry\n\n53.5 Hoedspruit 116 A (Craig Zackey) Justin Snaith\n\n53.5 Sovereign Spirit 116 BA (……………) Ashley Fortune\n\n53.5 Sparkling Water 116 A (S’manga Khumalo) Mike de Kock\n\n53 Airways Law 108 A (…………..)
