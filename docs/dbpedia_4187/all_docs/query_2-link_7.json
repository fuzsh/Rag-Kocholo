If you were shooting here you know I'd be down like last time. Did you get my e-mail?\n\nGreg,\n\nYup! We are shooting here in Austin on the 14th/15th of aug.\n\nIf I were still in LA, you'd definitely be the first person I got in touch with. Yup! I got your email and check your inbox.\n\ngot the final draft of the script and still building props, sets, and digitally painting all the matte stuff for the vfx.\n\nIf anyone is here in Austin, TX and wants to join the shoot, pm me.\n\n/j"
