        "text": "David Thiselton\n\nSouth African graduates of the South African Jockey Academy often make the news overseas but the man currently making waves in the U. K. is former Summerveld trainer Dylan Cunha.\n\nOn the jockey front noteworthy overseas news in the return to the winner’s enclosure of Australia-based Donovan Dillon.\n\nLast week Cunha had a good third in a big handicap at York his Brocklesby-winning two-year-old Sensorium and the horse earned a cheque of £61,000.\n\nOn Monday Cunha scored an exacta in a seven furlong maiden for two-year-olds at Chepstow with two cheap buys, one of whom was making his debut.\n\nThe Make Believe colt Louie The Legend was bought at the Tattersalls September Sale for £8,000 and went off at 7/2 today in a 16 horse field on the turf, having finished fourth and second respectively in two previous seven furlong events on the Newcastle and Chelmsford All Weather tracks.\n\nThe Ardad colt Dapper Gee Gee was bought at the Tattersalls December foal Sale for £15,000 in 2022 and then for £16,000 at the Tattersalls December Yearling Sale last year. However, he was unsold at the Tattersalls Guineas Breeze Up Sale this year, before apparently being purchased into the Cunha yard for a mere £3,000.\n\nLouie The Legend was backed in from an opening call of 5/1.\n\nHe was prominent early and led narrowly three furlongs out. He was then pushed along and hung left under pressure two furlongs out. However, he kept on well to win by three-qarters of a length under Ray Dawson.\n\nDapper Gee Gee opened at 28/1 before touching 20/1 and starting at 22/1.\n\nHe was midfield in the running before making headway over two furlongs out. He pressed the leaders a furlong out and went second in the final 110 yards and then ran on under George Wood. He should be in the winner’s enclosure soon.Cunha has now had 39 wins in all in the U.K., having started out with just two horses about two years ago, so he has made a meteoric rise in the toughest of environments.\n\nDonovan Dillon has made a welcome return to the winner’s enclosure in Australia after being out for a long time due to a serious injury.\n\nHe said in February this year that his absence from race-riding since October 2023 had been due to a horse kicking him in the thing and tearing the muscle off the bone.\n\nHe added at the time, “It has been a crazy ride since we’ve been here. I’m not racing as much as I used to, small yard but massive name that we are behind (Arrowfield Stud). We have a couple of months left before we can apply for permanent residency and once that happens I think things open up a lot more and we will have a lot more freedom. I will obviously still work for Arrowfield in the mornings, but I will be looking to ride in races seven times a week. I’m trying to get my weight right down to a natural 54 to 55kg so I can freelance and race all day everyday. I have put it in my sights that I want to go for the title in 2024/2025. I do think I can accomplish that with the racing I’ve had here already.”\n\nHe made his comeback on July 29.\n\nHowever, he is still awaiting his permanent reisdency and has only had five rides in all this year, including winning on the Paul Messara & Leah Gavranich-trained Mikki Isle filly Brok Cafe in a 1300m event at Scone last week on Monday.Donovan extracted a strong finish from Brok Cafe from last place in a small five horse field to get up in the final couple of strides. He is now three from three on Brok Cafe.\n\nIn Donovan’s first season in Australia (2022/2023) he had 9 wins at a strike rate of 33.3% and he had a place strike rate of 70.4%.\n\nThe talented former KZN Champion Apprentice and South African Jockey Academy headboy will be a rider to follow once he gets that long awaited permanent residency.\n\nHis wife Tayla has been doing very well working for a neighbouring stud farm to Arrowfield called Ridgmont, which is not related in anyway to the South African Ridgemont.\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/sa-expats-making-the-news-overseas/\n\nDavid TIhiselton\n\nThe Asian Racing Conference commences today (Tuesday) in Japan and runs until Sunday and four South Africans are scheduled to speak, NHA CEO Vee Moodley, MD of SOUTH African Equine Health and Protocols (SAEHP) Adrian Todd, Executive Chairman Of Cape Racing Greg Bortz and CEO of 4Racing Fundi Sithebe.\n\nMoodley, Todd and Bortz are all talking in the session Developments: Big Changes Across The Asian Racing Federation (ARF) Footprint.\n\nThe NHA’s biggest change recently has been the attempt to tackle the abuse of TCO2. This was generally welcomed by trainers but soon led to controversy with some race favourites scratched, leading to unhappiness among punters to the extent that on one occasion it caused the abandonment of a big race meeting. It has also led to confusion as horses who have definitely not been “milkshaked” were often shown to be over the limit. However, recently the number of scratchings due to elevated TCO2 levels has dropped dramatically, with not a single case happening last week. This suggests the NHA are winning the battle against those trying to seek an advantage, while trainers are also playing ball by researching possible reasons for isolated elevated level cases. Moodley will certainly have a lot to speak about on the subject.\n\nAdrian Todd will welcome the opportunity to at last speak about what has happened rather than what he hopes will happen. Direct flights for Equine exports from South Africa to Europe are now a reality with the first one in 14 Years, carrying 32 horses including three racehorses, having landed last weekend in Belgium. Another one is set to follow in September. This has opened great opportunities for SA racehorses to be tested against the best around the world. It is also a great boon for SA breeders, as there will likely be increased support from overseas buyers at our sales, and with owners now also having the potential for lucrative overseas prize money the prices at sales could continue to increase too. It is also good news for overseas breeders as SA buyers will return to some of their sales. Todd will have a lot to divulge on this topic, particularly as the announcement of direct flights led to a wave of optimism across the board in the SA racing industry.\n\nGreg Bortz gets a first opportunity to speak at the Asian Racing Conference since forming a partnership with Hollywoodbets and reviving Cape Racing from down and out to thriving in the space of a few months in 2022. This was the single biggest injection of positivity into SA racing in recent times and the industry has been on an upward trend ever since. Bortz and Hollywoodbets are now close to being in control of KZN racing which includes a rescue package that saves it from pending bankruptcy. Bortz’s input is not just about endless money keeping a failing entity going. It incorporates a plan towards self sustainment. In the Cape this includes developing a 365-day-a-year, 24/7 lifestyle and entertainment complex at Kenilworth racecourse, where the sport and stakeholders will benefit, as well as the local community. This development was already well under way last year. The innovative ideas and energy of the partnership, whose unofficial motto is to do rather than talk about doing, should continue in similar vein in KZN. Bortz will no doubt reveal the latest progress and plans in a session that will be much looked forward to at the Asian Racing Conference.\n\n4Racing is also on an innovative streak, including the Betway Summer Cup becoming the richest race in the land with a recently announced R6 million stake. 4Racing’s CEO Fundi Sithebe will be talking in a session entitled “Achieving Wellbeing & Inclusivity From The Track To The Boardroom.”\n\nThe feedback the SA speakers bring back from the conference is also looked forward to by industrymen and the racing public.\n\nSource: https://www.goldcircle.co.za/sa-speakers-at-the-asian-racing-conference/"
