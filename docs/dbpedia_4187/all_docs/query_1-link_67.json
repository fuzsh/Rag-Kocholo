        "text": "All-boys private school in Botha's Hill, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa\n\nKearsney College is a private boarding, English medium high school for boys in Botha's Hill, a small town between the provincial capital of Pietermaritzburg and Durban, in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nKearsney College was founded by Sir Liege Hulett in 1921. Hulett founded what would become Tongaat Hulett Sugar. Sir Liege Hulett cherished the idea of establishing a boys' school for Methodist ministers and their sons and those of the families of the free churches. Kearsney took its name from Kearsney, Kent where Sir Liege Hulett had moved to where his father established St Martin's Academy.[1]\n\nHe considered Kearsney House, the house he originally built for his family to be ideally suited for this purpose. On 29 November 1920, a contract was signed with the Wesleyan Church for the use of Kearsney House as a school. This was the birth of Kearsney College and remains a living memorial to Sir Liege. The school opened with 11 boys. Kearsney College remained at the Kearsney Estate until June 1939 when it moved to its present site at Botha's Hill between Pietermaritzburg and Durban. The decision to move the school was based on the reluctance of parents to send their sons to a school on the north coast that suffered many cases of malaria in the 1930s, although none were reported at Kearsney.[2] On hearing of this, Clement Stott of Botha’s Hill donated 25 acres (10 ha) of land. At the same time, J.J. Crookes offered to build a boarding house. The move was completed a month before the beginning of World War II. The new Kearsney College opened with 196 boys.\n\nKearsney's badge was designed by the then-headmaster, R.H. Matterson, and the chaplain, the Rev. W.H. Irving, in about 1923.[citation needed][3] The greyhound is taken from the arms of the founder, Sir James Liege Hulett[3] The scallop shells and the dividing chevron are from the arms of the founder of Methodism, John Wesley.[citation needed] The pheon, or arrowhead, is taken from the badge of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where Matterson studied.[3] The motto Carpe Diem, traditionally at Kearsney translated \"Seize the Day,\" comes from the Roman poet Horace.[4]\n\nHeadmasters\n\n[edit]\n\nD. Pyne Mercier (1921–1922)\n\nR.H. Matterson (1923–1946)\n\nS.G. Osler (1947–1964)\n\nJ.H. Hopkins (1965–1974)\n\nE.W. Silcock (1975–1990)\n\nO.J.

They are Finningley (blue), Gillingham (red), Pembroke (green), Sheffield (yellow) and Haley (house for student's first year of boarding). Finningley is named after the town of Finningley in South Yorkshire, England. Gillingham is named after Gillingham, Kent, England Where Sir Liege Hulett lived as a young man[1] Pembroke is named after the town of Pembroke, Pembrokeshire, Wales. Sheffield is named after Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England where Sir Liege Hulett moved to following his time in Gillingham.\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe School offers the following subject choices for Grades 10,11,12 : English; Afrikaans or isiZulu; Mathematics or Mathematical Literacy; Life Orientation; Accounting, Business Studies, Dramatic Art; Engineering Graphics and Design; Geography; History; Information Technology; Life Sciences (Biology); Music; Science; Mandarin and Visual Arts.[5]\n\nIn 2020, Kearsney had a 100% pass rate and a 100% Bachelor Degree pass rate.[6][7]\n\nClubs and Cultural Activities\n\n[edit]\n\nClubs offered range from academic extension (12 Club; History Club) to personal enrichment (SCA; Dale Carnegie Course; Chess) to creative (Photographic Club; Video Editing Club; Enviro Club) to the physical (Surfing; Survival Club; Mountain Bike Club) and to the just plain fun (Board Games Club).
