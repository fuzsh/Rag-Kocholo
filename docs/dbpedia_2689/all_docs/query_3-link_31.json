        "text": "Description\n\nMarcus Salvius Otho: Emperor of Rome, 69 C.E. A dissolute man who had apparently pimped his wife Poppaea to Nero, he contracted huge debts in the latter part of that Emperor's reign. When Nero was overthrown and Galba acclaimed Emperor, Otho hoped to be chosen Galba's heir. But Galba, who was generally an upright man, chose Licinianus Piso as his heir, Otho had Galba assassinated and assumed the Principate. But there were revolts all over the Empire. The first to invade Italy was Aulus Vitellius. Otho's troops were defeated at the first battle of Cremona, and although Otho's situation was far from hopeless, he promptly committed suicide.\n\nThis is a general description. It is not a review."
