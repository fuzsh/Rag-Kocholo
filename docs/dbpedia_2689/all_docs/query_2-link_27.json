        "text": "Julius Agricola, a Roman commander from the 1st century CE, significantly contributed to Roman expansion in Britain and broke the strength of the Caledonian tribes for a generation. After the victorious battle of Mons Graupius Agricola gave the prefect of the fleet an order to sail along the coasts to the north, which made it clear that Britain was an island.\n\nThere is a widespread belief that Roman legionaries were short and compensated for their poor physical conditions, e.g. in clashes with Gauls or Germans, with great discipline, organization and equipment. How was it really?\n\nHunting was staged in the amphitheater arenas, where a tunic warrior stood in front of a wild animal, armed only with a sword or spear. Sometimes he was accompanied by a venator equipped with a bow, whip or spear, which he often fought for money or glory.\n\nIt is widely believed that fast food bars are a modern invention. However, ancient Rome does not quite agree with this statement.\n\nArena and the audience of the Colosseum were covered up with a giant sail (velarium), which was supposed to protect viewers from the sun and rain. It was attached to large columns on the Coliseum Mountain and anchored to the ground with large ropes.\n\nGladiators received cash prizes for their win. In the event of a decisive and effective victory, the warrior additionally received a laurel wreath. The greatest reward was the release from fighting in the arena, which was shown by handing over a wooden sword. In contrast, convicts and criminals, forced by the authorities to fight, were given freedom if they survived more than three years of fighting.\n\nPliny the Elder said that scorpions are a terrible plague. They are almost as venomous as vipers, but their venom causes much more torture to the victim who dies in painful agony lasting up to three days. In turn, the Roman writer Claudius Aelianus clearly emphasized that scorpions are hated, and that they hide in the desert under every stone and clod of sand.\n\nIn the 1st century BCE Roman poet Gaius Valerius Catullus (c. 84 – c. 54 BCE) wrote a poem that was addressed to two critics of his work: another poet Marcus Furius Bibaculus and senator Marcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus. The text was so vulgar and obscene that it was not translated from Latin until the 20th century.\n\nRomans were not racists at all and not rated by skin colour. Seneca the Younger claimed that people with black complexion were not a surprise in Rome.\n\nIn 215 BCE Roman Republic was experiencing a powerful political and economic crisis. The defeats suffered by Hannibal in the Second Punic War cost Rome a great deal of lives and money. Therefore, the Senate began to look for different ways to save the state."
