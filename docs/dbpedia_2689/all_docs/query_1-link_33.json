        "text": "In the beginning there was Aristotle,\n\nAnd objects at rest tended to remain at rest,\n\nAnd objects in motion tended to come to rest,\n\nAnd soon everything was at rest,\n\nAnd God saw that it was boring.\n\nThen God created Newton,\n\nAnd objects at rest tended to remain at rest,\n\nBut objects in motion tended to remain in motion,\n\nAnd energy was conserved and momentum was conserved and matter was conserved,\n\nAnd God saw that it was conservative.\n\nThen God created Einstein,\n\nAnd everything was relative,\n\nAnd fast things became short,\n\nAnd straight things became curved,\n\nAnd the universe was filled with inertial frames,\n\nAnd God saw that it was relatively general, but some of it was especially relative.\n\nThen God created Bohr,\n\nAnd there was the principle,\n\nAnd the principle was quantum,\n\nAnd all things were quantified,\n\nBut some things were still relative,\n\nAnd God saw that it was confusing.\n\nThen God was going to create Furgeson,\n\nAnd Furgeson would have unified,\n\nAnd he would have fielded a theory,\n\nAnd all would have been one,\n\nBut it was the seventh day,\n\nAnd God rested,\n\nAnd objects at rest tend to remain at rest.\n\n— Tim Joseph\n\nFrom reader Dave King:\n\nA certain young lady of Prinknash\n\nWas looking decidedly thinknash.\n\nHer diet restriction\n\nHad proved an addiction\n\nAnd caused her to swiftly diminknash.\n\nA hungry young student of Norwich\n\nWent into his larder to forwich.\n\nFor breakfast he usually\n\nHad bacon or muesli\n\nBut today he would have to have porwich.\n\nAn ethical diner at Alnwick\n\nWas suddenly put in a palnwick\n\n“This coffee you’ve made\n\nAre you sure it’s Fair Trade?\n\nAnd I must insist that it’s orgalnwick!”\n\nA Science don, Gonville and Caius,\n\nKept body parts in his deep fraius.\n\nHe didn’t remember\n\nAnd one dark November\n\nHe ate them with cabbage and paius.\n\nA Frenchman now living at Barnoldswick\n\nWas terribly partial to garnoldswick.\n\nThe smell of his breath\n\nDrove one lady to death;\n\nShe fell from the ramparts at Harnoldswick.\n\nA forceful young prisoner from Brougham\n\nWas confined to a windowless rougham,\n\nSo, venting his feelings,\n\nHe bashed through the ceiling,\n\nDispelling the gathering glougham.\n\n(Thanks, Dave.)\n\nOne night in 1939, Wolcott Gibbs’ 4-year-old son Tony began chanting a song in the bathtub. It was sung “entirely on one note except that the voice drops on the last word in every line”:\n\nHe will just do nothing at all.\n\nHe will just sit there in the noonday sun.\n\nAnd when they speak to him, he will not answer them,\n\nBecause he does not care to.\n\nHe will stick them with spears and throw them in the garbage.\n\nWhen they tell him to eat his dinner, he will just laugh at them.\n\nAnd he will not take his nap, because he does not care to.\n\nHe will not talk to them, he will not say nothing.\n\nHe will just sit there in the noonday sun.\n\nHe will go away and play with the Panda.\n\nHe will not speak to nobody because he doesn’t have to.\n\nAnd when they come to look for him they will not find him.\n\nBecause he will not be there.\n\nHe will put spikes in their eyes and put them in the garbage.\n\nAnd put the cover on.\n\nHe will not go out in the fresh air or eat his vegetables.\n\nOr make wee-wee for them, and he will get thin as a marble.\n\nHe will do nothing at all.\n\nHe will just sit there in the noonday sun.\n\nPete Seeger liked this so much that he made a song of it — he called it “Declaration of Independence”:\n\nWhen quacks with pills political would dope us,\n\nWhen politics absorbs the livelong day,\n\nI like to think about that star Canopus,\n\nSo far, so far away.\n\nGreatest of visioned suns, they say who list ’em;\n\nTo weigh it science always must despair.\n\nIts shell would hold our whole dinged solar system,\n\nNor even know ’twas there.\n\nWhen temporary chairmen utter speeches,\n\nAnd frenzied henchmen howl their battle hymns,\n\nMy thoughts float out across the cosmic reaches\n\nTo where Canopus swims.\n\nWhen men are calling names and making faces,\n\nAnd all the world’s ajangle and ajar,\n\nI meditate on interstellar spaces\n\nAnd smoke a mild seegar.\n\nFor after one has had about a week of\n\nThe argument of friends as well as foes,\n\nA star that has no parallax to speak of\n\nConduces to repose.\n\n— Bert Leston Taylor\n\nThe poem known as Catullus 16, by the Roman poet Gaius Valerius Catullus, is so explicit sexually that a full English translation was not published until the late 20th century:\n\nI will sodomize you and face-fuck you,\n\nbottom Aurelius and catamite Furius,\n\nyou who think, because my poems\n\nare sensitive, that I have no shame.\n\nFor it’s proper for a devoted poet to be moral\n\nhimself, [but] in no way is it necessary for his poems.\n\nIn point of fact, these have wit and charm,\n\nif they are sensitive and a little shameless,\n\nand can arouse an itch,\n\nand I don’t mean in boys, but in those hairy old men\n\nwho can’t get it up.\n\nBecause you’ve read my countless kisses,\n\nyou think less of me as a man?\n\nI will sodomize you and face-fuck you.\n\nDuke classics professor Micaela Wakil Janan renders this in modern English prose:\n\nFuck you, boys, up the butt and in the mouth, you queer Aurelius and you fag Furius! You size me up, on the basis of my poems, because they’re a little sexy, as not really decent. A poet has to live clean — but not his poems. They only have spice and charm, if somewhat sexy and really not for children — if, in fact, they cause body talk (I’m not talking in teenagers, but in hairy old men who can barely move their stiff bums). But you, because you happen to read about ‘many thousands of kisses,’ you think I’m not a man? Fuck you, boys, up the butt and in the mouth!\n\nMarcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus and Marcus Furius Bibaculus had criticized Catullus’ earlier work as effeminate. Writing in the Telegraph in 2009, author Harry Mount called the poet’s response “one of the filthiest expressions ever written in Latin — or in any other language, for that matter.”\n\nThe Fireside Book of Humorous Poetry contains this resonant scrap of anonymous verse:\n\nJohn Wesley Gaines!\n\nJohn Wesley Gaines!\n\nThou monumental mass of brains!\n\nCome in, John Wesley\n\nFor it rains.\n\nIn The American Treasury, Clifton Fadiman writes, “Mr. Gaines is believed to have been a Congressman.” And lo, a John Wesley Gaines did indeed serve in the House, representing Tennessee’s 6th district from 1897 to 1909. A Washington journalist wrote in 1907, “Down in Tennessee they started a song about Gaines which found its way to Washington, and every now and then you’ll hear some one giving him a line of it just to liven things up a bit.”\n\nGaines is largely forgotten today, but I find that gimlet little rhyme in 18 different treasuries. I wonder who wrote it."
