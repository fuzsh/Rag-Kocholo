        "text": "This study concerns itself with several aspects of citizen training systems in Greek cities during the Roman imperial period, a largely neglected area of study. Problems of interpretation such as the noticeable decline in epigraphical evidence are confronted and possible solutions proposed. The scope and significance of athletic and military training are surveyed and the likelihood of a connection with the Roman army assessed. Finally, the fates of ephebic systems and the physical plants associated with them under the Christian Empire are briefly sketched.\n\nAcross the eastern Mediterranean, only a limited number of inscriptions, coins and papyri attest the term ἐπιν(ε)ίκια bestowed on local festivities. My paper studies for the first time the genesis and evolution of a particular title that could be presented as a sign of loyalty and friendship towards Roman rule. Through an analysis of mostly direct evidence, I aim to provide the perspective of certain local communities which, while subjected to Rome, remarkably strove to celebrate its victories. This bottom-up approach also seeks to show the importance of reciprocity in the constant diplomatic exchange between emperors, administrators and eastern provincials.\n\nAphrodisias in Caria has a group of marble sarcophagi whose production peaked in the early Severan period and declined at the end of the 3rd century A.D. By examining the sarcophagi in the local social context, this article offers possible reasons for this chronological accumulation of the sarcophagus production.\n\nThis article presents an inscribed statue base discovered at Oinoanda by Professor Martin Ferguson Smith in 2002. The new inscription is placed in its historical context, and the commentary traces the implications for our under- standing of Roman army recruitment, the role of the civic élite in responding to the demands of the imperial government and the practice of heroisation in the competition for honour among the notables who were also the city’s victorious athletes.\n\nA long-unpublished statue base for the emperor Constantius II was rediscovered at Oinoanda in 2010. It contains information that Oinoanda was a neokoros city, that is, having a special status in the imperial cult. The article attempts to trace the significance of neokoria and of images in the imperial cult in the fourth century AD, an era of rapid religious change when the Christianity of the emperors and many ordinary people co-existed with deep and widespread pagan traditions that flowed throughout Roman society."
