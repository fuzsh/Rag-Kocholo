        "text": "13. Wrath of the Furies\n\n(USA: Minotaur, 2015, hardcover; London: Minotaur, 2015, hardcover).\n\nStill in 88 BC, Mithridates takes advantage of the Social War raging in Italy to conquer the Roman provinces in Asia Minor. Gordianus receives a mysterious message that carries him to his ex-teacher, Antipater of Sidon, in Ephesus and leads to his playing the role of a spy. Antipater, Mithridates VI, Queen Monime, Publius Rutilius Rufus (great uncle of Julius Caesear), and Manius Aquillius appear. This is an often mysterious tale, but not a traditional mystery, rather a thriller or spy tale. It is also too frequently a story of people in deep misery, perhaps chosen to echo the Syrian refugee crisis of the mid-twenty-teens. There are many stories one can tell and perhaps some do read fiction as a political essay, but many of us get enough of this in the daily news whereas we read novels to escape. Other oddities:\n\nWhile in the novel on the seven wonders there was nothing about the very long journey to Babylon, here relatively short journeys receive quite detailed treatments. More apparent padding appears whenever characters travel in a town and up and down stairs and so on.\n\nA dubious historical explanation of the Mithridatic War seems to ignore Mithridates' initiation of the conflict.\n\nMotivations – the reasons for taking the journey, the explanation of its trigger, etc. – seem rather doubtful.\n\nA Zoroastrian magus inexplicably participates in a sacrifice in the Greek religion.\n\nGaius Cassius, presumably the father of the more famous murderer of Caesar of the same name, appears. Whereas Shakespeare describes the son as \"lean, hungry\", here the father is deliberately called \"stout\". Probably no one today knows the reality – an inside joke?\n\nThirteenth in the series chronologically, but third in terms of the Finder's storyline. [★★+]\n\n14. The Throne of Caesar\n\n(USA: Minotaur, 2018, hardcover; London: Minotaur, 2018, hardcover).\n\nIn 44 BC, just before the famous Ides of March, harkening back to the very first novel in the series, Cicero's secretary, Tiro, comes to Gordianus requesting help on the same day that he gets a summons from Julius Caesar. The events around the death of Caesar have been recounted in many mystery novels as well as the works of Shakespeare, Colleen McCullough, Robert Harris and many movies. When it comes to these events we are looking at \"familiar\" in the rear view mirror. This novel takes us through them, but unlike many versions, we are not in the meetings of the plotters and do not really establish their points of view.\n\nAlthough there is a detective case of sorts apart from Caesar's murder, once again there is also little to no actual \"detection\", a disappointment to the mystery reader, if not the history one.\n\nSo let's talk history. The book spends quite a bit of time with Caesar, here a good guy, intelligent, urbane, thoughtful, humble. Ambitious, sure, but very accomplished. Very generous and clement to his Roman enemies, but that's not a bad strategy as he was hoping they would let him be king. In reality Caesar must have been a cold-blooded killer using state resources to conduct wars of aggression against fawaray peoples for no reason apart from his lust for glory, killing thousands upon thousands and selling his captives into slavery so he could earn millions. Although a paragraph near the very end mentions this, it is but a small brick in a wall of positive Caesarian propaganda. The characterization of the assassins as being only motivated by personal ambition and the dismissal of his other enemy, the humanist philosopher Cicero, only provide the capstone. Ostensibly these histories are supposed to be Rome under the covers; it's unfortunate there was no character such as a Gaul sold into Roman slavery to provide a more accurate perspective.\n\nThere is also a great deal about poetry in this book, including a lost work recounting a tale of incest, Zmyrna. Once again the author has been fortunate that current events seem to echo the book. In our own time line one president has said that he would date his daughter if she were not related and in China a president has been elected, like Caesar, to a life term.\n\nThe ending perhaps strains credulity, but let's not say any more about that.\n\nThe author's style is as enjoyable as ever, the writing clear and easilly accessible, even when recounting very long poems. Gordianus, who never takes himself too seriously, is a pleasant narrator, and his family and friends are fun to be around. If this is the end of the series, as is hinted, it will be a sad turn of events.\n\nGaius Helvius Cinna, Servilia, Marcus Junius Brutus, Porcia, Gaius Cassius, Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Servilius Casca, Tillius Cimber, Gaius Trebonius, Lucius Cornelius Cinna, and Cleopatra also appear. 392 pp., including a short author's note.\n\nFourteenth in the series. [★★+]\n\nNotes on first American hardcover edition:\n\np. 49: \"you've reach\" should be \"you've reached\"\n\np. 61: A character casually mentions a tiger and his listeners apparently easily understand what he means, but tigers were unknown in Rome before 11 BC, thirty-three years later.\n\np. 93: A character displays in his home the type of artwork that Etruscans famously used in tombs to remember the dead. Is it really likely that they would have used such deathly sculptures in their homes?\n\np. 102: Mention that Servilia was sister to Cato. Actually she was only a half sister.\n\np. 121: \"feeing\" should be \"feeling\"\n\np. 180: \"you fathers\" should be \"your fathers\"\n\np. 285: Dionysus was a Greek god. Bacchus was the Roman name of a similar god. The most famous story about him, The Bacchae by the Greek playwright Euripides, is in Greek and uses \"Dionysus\", which is the more popular usage in English today. But as this is a Roman story, \"Bacchus\" is used many, many times, except, oddly on p. 285 it suddenly, and confusingly, reverts to Dionysus.\n\np. 332: A character anachronistically uses the term \"sense memory\". This term only began with modern psychology.\n\np. 345: A male character comprehends a woman's breasts in a sexual sense. It isn't actually known whether ancient Romans had this modern concept.\n\np. 368: An odd repetition of the use of \"Dionysus\" rather than \"Bacchus\".\n\nThe Liberalia, being about males coming of age was rather different than described. The identification of Father Liber with Bacchus and then with Dionysus is a bit of a stretch.\n\nThe character Fulvia, who has appeared in this series before, seems to be two characters. Sometimes she is an ambitious schemer who will stop at nothing. At other times she is a righteous crusader. There doesn't seem any way for the two to meet."
