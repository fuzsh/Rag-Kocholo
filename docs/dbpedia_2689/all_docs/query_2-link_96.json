Drinkwater\n\nAncient Rome remains ﬁrmly anchored in the public imagination. Few in the Western world are totally ignorant of her existence and achievements. In history and politics ‘the rise’ of the Roman Empire continues to be cited as an example of greatness, and its ‘fall’ as a measure of catastrophe. More popularly, Rome is a rich source of material for the entertainment industry in the shape of innumerable plays, ﬁlms, novels and, most recently, computer games.1 Rome is not forgotten, but she is remembered very obscurely. Most would be hard put to give dates for Caesar, Cleopatra and Constantine the Great, or explain their place in Roman history. Dramas offer little help. HBO/BBC’s Rome (2005) was a commendable attempt to explain the rise of Caesar and Octavian, and the latter’s destruction of Mark Antony; and, even more ambitiously, the BBC’s Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire (2006) tackled the complexities of the long period from the Gracchi to Honorius (second century BC – ﬁfth century AD). Both, however, left many loose ends and created confusions. Far worse was Ridley Scott’s Gladiator (2000) which, in addition to a myriad particular inaccuracies, minor and major, grotesquely misrepresented the course of Roman history by suggesting that the killing of the tyrannical emperor Commodus in\n\nAD\n\n192 led to the restoration of the old Republic. Nothing could\n\nbe further from the truth: by then the Republic had been dead for centuries, and soon after Commodus came the even more autocratic Severan emperors and the open display of ‘military monarchy’.2 A detailed and solidly source-based timeline, such as this presented by Timothy Venning, is an indispensable handbook for all those wishing to gain a proper understanding of what occurred. In many ﬁelds of history the division of narrative by distinct periods is frowned upon:\n\n2\n\nA CHRONOLOGY OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\n\nemphasis is on ‘continuity’. However, in the case of Roman history periodicization is well established, as much as anything because it was devised by the Romans themselves. The great Latin historian Tacitus opens his Annals with a deft summary of the evolution of the Roman state, beginning with the words ‘The city of Rome was, from the start, ruled by kings’.3 As his words suggest, Roman periodicization of Roman history was based on forms of government, basically: immediately after Rome’s foundation (traditionally, in 753 by kings (the ‘regal’ period); next (traditionally, from 509\n\nBC),\n\nBC)\n\nrule\n\nrule by\n\na Republic (aristocratic, not democratic, but nonetheless obedient to regularly elected ofﬁcials: ‘magistrates’); and ﬁnally (from 27\n\nBC)\n\nrule\n\n4\n\nby emperors (principes). Modern historians follow suit, and subdivide both Republican and imperial history into ‘early’, ‘middle’ and ‘late’ periods, thus referring to the ‘Early’ Republic, the ‘High’ Republic and the ‘Late’ Republic, and to the ‘Early’, ‘High’ and ‘Late’ Empire. The distinction between ‘Republic’ and ‘Empire’ can be a little confusing to newcomers, because Rome’s empire was for the most part a Republican creation. However, it works well enough, and is here to stay. A further complication is that there is lively debate as to the speciﬁc dates of some of these periods: when did the Early Republic end, or the Late Empire begin? Here, Timothy Venning combines the regal period with the Early Republic, which he takes down to 265\n\nBC,\n\nby which\n\ntime Rome was supreme in peninsular Italy, having defeated Pyrrhus of Epirus, and ready to face Phoenician (Punicus) Carthage in Sicily, Spain and North Africa (Part One). His High Republic runs from 264 to 146 BC. This was when Rome, in a series of ‘Punic’ and Macedonian wars, destroyed Carthage and Macedon, and so became undisputed mistress of the western Mediterranean, while beginning to interfere decisively in the affairs of Greece, Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt (Part Two). He dates the Late Republic from 145 to 30 BC, the period in which Rome effectively took control of the eastern Mediterranean, but which saw Republican replaced by autocratic rule, and which ended with the suicides of Antony and Cleopatra (Part Three). He has the Early Empire running from 30 BC to AD 68, when the ﬁrst, ‘Julio-Claudian’, dynasty\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nof emperors came to an end with the fall of Nero (Part Four). His High Empire lasts from 69 until 235, and the destruction of the Severan dynasty (Part Five). He deals with the Late Empire in two parts. The ﬁrst of these (Part Six) takes the story from 235 to 330, the date of the formal inauguration of Constantinople, the ‘New’, Christian Rome by Constantine the Great. This is where, in his view, ‘Roman’ history ends and ‘Byzantine’ history begins.5 For a full Byzantine timeline, readers should consult his companion volume, A Chronology of the Byzantine Empire (2006). However, in the event Constantinople failed to hold on to the West, and in Part Seven he offers a chronology of the last years of the old united Roman Empire, from\n\nAD\n\n331 down to the fall of the\n\nlast Western emperor, Romulus Augustulus, in 476. Without chronology there can be no history. The correct ordering of events (‘relative chronology’) and their dating (‘absolute chronology’) allow the reconstruction of the precise relationship between these events, and the deduction of their causes and effects. However, in considering the chronology of history as distant as that of the Romans we have to distinguish carefully between what they knew and what we know. A culture with little or no chronological awareness is unlikely to have left dependable records, which is bad for the historian. But equally bad is culture with acute chronological awareness which has left no records at all. With regard to Roman chronological awareness, we have little reason for concern. The Romans had unusually long memories. They were immensely proud of their history, and took great care to keep it alive – through myth and ceremonial and formal recording of events. Perhaps the most bizarre example of this is their treatment of the wax deathmasks (imagines) of the great men of Rome. These, normally on public display in the homes of the aristocratic descendants of their models, were weird enough in themselves. However, even more weirdly, at the funeral of an important relative they were worn by living members of the family wearing appropriate dress.6 Beyond this, every educated Roman was expected to identify and appreciate the force of the host of historical references to be found in every form of Latin literature, and\n\n4\n\nA CHRONOLOGY OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\n\nin the architecture and decoration of all but the meanest settlements. Romans were helped in their remembering by their compilation of written calendars. On these they noted not just the days and months of the year but also – crucial for the survival of a subsistence farming community – the run of annual religious festivals that marked the progress of the agricultural year and, more broadly, which dates were propitious (fasti) for conducting important public business. This habit of notation was extended to recording the election of state ofﬁcials, and extraordinary events such as wars, natural disasters, portents etc. Such recording spawned new types of chronological documentation. There were general running ‘chronicles’ (annales) of the events of each year. The best known are the Annales Maximi, kept by the chief priest (Pontifex Maximus) on whitened boards and maintained down to the end of the second century BC. When these were collected and published they amounted to 80 books.7 More signiﬁcant in the long term was a series of lists also, by extension, called fasti. The most important were those of the chief magistrates of the Roman state, the consuls, usually two each year (fasti consulares), and of men who had been accorded the supreme honour of the Roman state, that of holding a triumph (fasti triumphales). The consular fasti are crucial because these were the bedrock of Roman chronological reckoning: events were recalled as having happened ‘in the consulships of m and n’. Though this may seem strange to modern eyes, this form of dating was common in the Ancient World with, for example, dating by archons at Athens and by ephors in Sparta.8 Consular dating was, however, of course, only relative. The ﬁrst attempts at the absolute dating of Roman history, i.e. at synchronising it with events elsewhere, were made by Greeks, increasingly conscious of the rise of Roman power. A crucial link was the synchronization of the Gallic sack of Rome with the Peace of Antalcidas between Sparta and Persia and with the siege of Rhegium by Dionysius I of Syracuse, putting the sack in 387/6\n\nBC.\n\nThe association\n\nwas made in the second century BC by Polybius in his ‘Histories’ (who also put the Gallic sack 19 years after the battle of Aegospotami and 16 before that of Leuctra). However, the link may have been calculated\n\n5\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nmuch earlier by Philistus of Syracuse (c. 430–356 Tauromenium (c. 350–260\n\n9\n\nBC).\n\nBC)\n\nor Timaeus of\n\nThis correlation, and others, allowed\n\nevents in Roman history to be given ‘international’ Greek dates, based on Olympiads. For a long time, however, the process was piecemeal, leading to contradiction and confusion. It was not until the ﬁrst century BC that Roman chronology was dealt with in a comprehensive and scientiﬁc manner, allowing not only the synchronization of Roman and Greek chronologies, but also eventually the synchronization of Roman and modern time systems. A number of scholars were involved, but the one given most credit is M. Terentius Varro (116–27 BC). In his lost ‘Chronicles’ (Annales) Varro laid out the course of Roman history down to his day, dated both by consulships and a new, Roman absolute dating, in years ‘from the foundation of the City’ (ab urbe condita, abbreviated AVC). This put the foundation of Rome, in our terms, in 753 BC, the foundation of the Republic in 509 BC, and the Gallic sack in 390 BC.10 The ‘Varronian’ chronology quickly became the norm, being adopted for Augustus’ new monumental publication of the consular (to AD 13) and triumphal (to 19 BC) fasti on an arch in the Forum, the so-called Fasti Capitolini (the term is modern).11 Roman dating spread throughout the Roman Empire, extending its synchronization with Greek Olympiads to all local systems and gradually replacing these.12 With this, of course, the Roman calendar, as reformed by Julius Caesar in 46\n\nBC\n\nand introduced on 1 January 45\n\nBC,\n\nrevised by Augustus\n\n(who accepted the renaming of the month of Sextilis as ‘August’ in his honour),13 and readjusted by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, took its ﬁrst step to today’s world dominance. This, with its year of 12 familiar months beginning on 1 January (moved from 1 March, the beginning of the campaigning season, in 153 BC), is a living fossil, and an everyday reminder of the might of Rome. In the imperial period, Roman chronological consciousness remained as strong as ever. Consular dates continued to be published on inscriptions in Rome, and the consular fasti were made available in all the provinces.14 Likewise, traditional calendars continued to be compiled and published. As can be seen in Ovid’s Fasti, as well as transmitting the traditional agricultural and\n\n6\n\nA CHRONOLOGY OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\n\nreligious information, these now made much of the emperor and the ruling house. Alongside the calendars were more specialized almanacs of public festivals (feriae) and farming. A famous instance of the former is a military version, the so-called Feriale Duranum, issued to a regiment of native infantry, the Cohors XX Palmyrenorum, stationed at Dura-Europus on the Euphrates in the early third century, which lists religious festivals and imperial birthdays and anniversaries.15 With regard to the latter, Columella’s (ﬂ. c. AD 65) ‘On Agriculture’ is notable for the attention it pays to astronomical phenomena – for example, the rising and setting of constellations – as key indicators of when to begin vital tasks around the farm. Roman imperial consciousness of the past is seen in the great celebrations for the 1000th birthday of the city under the emperor Philip the Arab in AD 247–8.16 The existence of monarchical rulers, principes, generated other reliable dating systems. Constitutionally just the ‘ﬁrst men’ of the state, these were not ‘emperors’ in the modern sense, and certainly not kings. However, Romans soon fell into thinking of their periods of office as reigns, and dating events accordingly. This was most evident in the writing of biographies of emperors in chronological order – most famously those of Suetonius – and, later, of condensed histories (breviaria) by reign, e.g. those of Aurelius Victor and Eutropius (both ﬂ. mid-fourth century AD). Furthermore, though emperors were not kings, there was even a sort of ofﬁcial counting by ‘regnal’ years, providing a date such as ‘in the second year of the emperor Claudius’. This was made possible by the fact that imperial power was, in essence, a permanent amalgamation of the powers of Republican magistrates. One of the most important civil powers was that of a ‘tribune of the people’, which comprised, among other privileges, the right to initiate and veto legislation, and exemption from arrest. Under the Republic aspiring tribunes had to stand for election, and held ofﬁce for just one year. Emperors simply assumed ‘the power of a tribune’ (tribunicia potestas) each year. These periods of ‘tribunician power’ ran from 10 to 9 December of succeeding years. They were marked on inscriptions and coins as TRIB POT (or just TP) I, II, III etc. A similar system existed\n\n7\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nin Egypt, where the emperor was regarded as a pharaoh, and where there was a strong tradition of dating by regnal years, in this case by the Egyptian calendar year. As reformed by Augustus, this began on 29 August, with a leap year, ending on 30 August, every four years.17 Also, with the emergence of an imperial family there was more interest in their activities. So the ‘Arval Brotherhood’ (Fratres Arvales), priests of an ancient state cult for the Dea Dia, came to take a particular interest in the well-being of the imperial family and recorded their comings and goings in their records, the ‘Arval Acta’. Used with care, the Acta provide much valuable chronological data for the period 21 BC to AD 241.18 Fresh interest in chronology came from growing numbers of Christians. These felt a need to connect Christianity to its Old Testament roots and to synchronize these with Greek and Roman dating, thereby demonstrating that the new religion had a pedigree as good as the old. The production of such universal histories (‘chronicles’) began early in the third century. The most important was that of bishop Eusebius of Caesarea (c. AD 260–339), as translated into Latin and expanded by Jerome (c.\n\nAD\n\n347–420) and then by Hydatius (c.\n\nAD\n\n400–c. 470) and\n\nothers. Also important is the world-history, in Greek, of John Malalas (c.\n\nAD\n\n480–570) and the ‘Easter Chronicle’ (Chronicon Paschale) of the\n\nearly seventh century, which recorded events from the Creation (dated to 21 March, 5509 BC).19 Christians also took up and Christianized the traditional Roman calendar with, for example, that of Polemius Silvius (mid-ﬁfth century\n\nAD).\n\nAnd Christians of the early Christian Roman\n\nEmpire wrote valuable church histories. The genre of the Historia Ecclesiastica was invented by Eusebius of Caesarea and continued by Socrates Scholasticus and Sozomen (both ﬂ. mid-ﬁfth century AD), and Theodoret (c. AD 393–466). It focused on ecclesiastical matters, but gave close attention to related secular events, and made good use of archival material. The genre died out as Church and State become one under the Byzantine emperors. Christianity was also, of course, responsible for the invention of ‘AD’ dating: Anno Domini, ‘in the year of our Lord’, i.e. ‘in the nth year following the birth of Christ’. This was the work of a Scythian monk, Dionysius Exiguus, early in the sixth century. His\n\n8\n\nA CHRONOLOGY OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\n\naim was to displace an established eastern Christian system of dating by the ‘era of Diocletian’, which counted years from the accession of this emperor in 284 and so, ironically, perpetuated the name of one of Christianity’s most notorious persecutors. Dating by years ‘BC’, ‘before the birth of Christ’, is found in the medieval period but was popularized in the Renaissance by Denis Pétau (Dionysius Petavius: 1583–1652).20 With regard to what we know of Roman chronology, the situation appears equally promising. Romans began to write their own history towards the end of the third century\n\nBC,\n\nwith the works of Gnaeus\n\nNaevius (c. 270–c. 199 BC), Q. Fabius Pictor (born c. 254 BC: writing in Greek), Quintus Ennius (239–169 BC) and M. Porcius Cato (234–149 BC: his ‘Origins’ were the ﬁrst true Latin history). Sadly, very little survives of these and their imitators of the following century or so. However, down to the later second century\n\nBC\n\nthis gap can be ﬁlled to some\n\ndegree by Polybius’ ‘Histories’ – a detailed account of developments in the Mediterranean world from 220 to 146 BC. Polybius (c. 200–120 BC) was a conscientious and methodical scholar, careful with his chronology, which he based on Greek Olympiads.21 Furthermore, for the later ﬁrst century BC, apart from Varro, we have historical information available from the memoirs, speeches, tracts and letters of active politicians. Important here are Julius Caesar’s (100–44 BC) subtle ‘commentaries’ on the war in Gaul (Bellum Gallicum) and on his defeat of Pompey and his supporters (Bella Civilia). Also signiﬁcant are the historical monographs of Caesar’s younger supporter, Sallust (86–35 BC): ‘The Histories’, ‘The War against Jugurtha’ and ‘The War against Catiline’, which deal with important political events of the late-second and mid-ﬁrst centuries BC. However, the richest source of historical and chronological information is, without doubt, the great lawyer and politician Cicero (106–43\n\nBC),\n\nwhose writings, above all his speeches and letters (especially the collections published as ‘To Atticus’ and ‘To His Friends’), at times detail the course of political events virtually day by day.22 Then, from the reign of Augustus, we have the great historians of Rome, writing within established dating systems, and dating carefully themselves. Thus Livy (59 BC – AD 17), writing describing the regal period\n\n9\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nand the Republic down to 9 BC in his ‘From the Foundation of the City’ (Ab urbe condita), sets events into a regular framework of consular and absolute dates. In this he was followed by Tacitus (c. AD 59–c. 118), in his ‘Agricola’, ‘Histories’ and ‘Annals’, Cassius Dio (c.\n\nAD\n\n164–c. 230),\n\nwriting in Greek, in his ‘Roman History’, and Ammianus Marcellinus (c.\n\nAD\n\n330–c. 395), in his ‘History’. These writers also knew the value\n\nof original documents, had access to them, and used them: least so in the case of Livy, but famously so in that of Suetonius (c. AD 70–c. 130). Since Suetonius was a biographer, not a historian, he does not appear in the above list. However, as an administrator of the highest rank under Trajan and Hadrian he could read important records and, in writing his ‘Caesars’, the lives of the rulers from Julius Caesar to Domitian, he drew on these extensively until interrupted by sudden dismissal from ofﬁce. The ‘Caesars’ certainly illuminates how much was available in the imperial archives. But here we have to acknowledge the existence of important problems. Even if the great historians had survived in their entirety, there would still be pitfalls for the unwary. First, in general terms, Greek and Latin historians did not, like modern historians, write to provide a full and balanced picture of events, but to dazzle their readers with their wide knowledge and literary skills, and to win them over to particular moral and political interpretations of what had occurred: in modern terms, they ‘spun’ the past. So, for example, their accounts of wars and battles can be vague and fanciful; and, as in the case of Ammianus Marcellinus on Christianity, they were quite capable of ignoring topics that, for various reasons, did not interest them. Furthermore, even conscientious annalistic history can confuse, since events do not always fall neatly into years. A classic example of this is Tacitus’ account of the opening of the Armenian war under Nero, which makes it difﬁcult to decide when precisely what is being described happened in the period 57–60. Next, with regard to ‘BC/AD’ dating, it always has to be borne in mind that there is no ‘year zero’: 1\n\nBC\n\nis followed by\n\nAD\n\n1. One result of this is that all centuries\n\nand millennia AD are one year short: the ‘ﬁrst century’ is only 99 years\n\n10\n\nA CHRONOLOGY OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\n\nlong, and the ‘ﬁrst millennium’ only 999. It was for this reason that purists wanted to celebrate the beginning of the second millennium on 1 January 2001, not 2000. Finally, despite their interest in the calendar, the Romans were to begin with not good at handling some of its ﬁner aspects. The constant problem of the Roman calendar, down to Pope Gregory, was how to devise a system able to cope with a solar year that very awkwardly averages 365.242 days.23 Instead of a 365-day year with leap years, the original ‘Calendar of Numa’ (named after the legendary second king of Rome) had a basic 355-day year, to which were added 22 or 23 days to February every other year.24 This system worked if used methodically. However, it was subject to periodic neglect and abuse, and could get signiﬁcantly out of step with the ‘real’ year. By the middle of the ﬁrst century\n\nBC\n\nthere was considerable slippage.\n\nSo, for example, though Julius Caesar ofﬁcially crossed the Rubicon on 10 January 49 BC, the calendar had crept so far ahead of the solar year that he did so not in the middle of winter but in mid-autumn. To bring the calendar year back into line with the solar year, and the months back in line with seasons, Caesar had to add 90 days to the year 46 BC. Differences between calendrical and solar dating need always to be taken into account in writing Republican history.25 The chronology of the Early Republican and Regal periods has particular problems. There are clear signs that even the earliest Roman historians had difficulty in dealing with them because of lack of evidence.26 Available records were, for various reasons, deﬁcient and unreliable. We know that the original bronze plaques promulgating the ﬁrst Roman law code, the ‘Twelve Tables’, were destroyed in the Gallic sack of 390\n\nBC;\n\nand it is likely that history was manipulated\n\nto promote personal and family interests.27 Some regularization of the consular lists may have resulted from reforms of 367/66\n\nBC,\n\nbut\n\ncurrent thinking is that these lists are unreliable down to c. 300.28 Different attempts by ancient scholars to rectify faults and ﬁll in gaps, and to bring the Rome system into line with Greek chronologies, caused further confusion. Gap-ﬁlling had to be done from myths and tendentious aristocratic family legends. One result of this was the\n\n11\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ncomplex and often conﬂicting accounts of the foundation of Rome, which also betray patriotic ignorance and denial of early Etruscan inﬂuence and domination.29 The ‘orthodox’ (Aeneas/Romulus/seven kings) version was in fact not ﬁxed until the end of the ﬁrst century BC, under Augustus. Synchronization was difﬁcult. Varro’s dating-system is inaccurate in places, and others were also in use. So Livy dates the foundation to 751/50 to 386\n\nBC,\n\nBC,\n\nthe ﬁrst consuls to 507/6\n\nBC\n\nand the Gallic sack\n\nin line with earlier Greek synchronizations. Probably most\n\naccurate is that of Dionysius of Halicarnassus (c. 60–c. 6 BC) who, in his ‘Roman Antiquities’, put the foundation in 752/1 BC, the ﬁrst consuls in 508/7\n\nBC\n\nand the Gallic sack in 388/7\n\nBC.\n\n30\n\nBy convention modern\n\nscholars keep to the Varronian system. The differences of a few years are usually not critical, and synchronization can be achieved by crosschecking consular dates.31 However, this expedient is awkward, and all the more so because Livy’s consular dating is not always consistent with that of the extant lists.32 And the great historians have not survived in their entirety. None of their works has come down to us unscathed. Large sections of their text survive only in necessarily suspect summaries, or in stray references in other writers, or are simply missing. Only the ﬁrst ﬁve of the 40 books of Polybius’ ‘Histories’ are intact. We have just 35 complete books of Livy’s ‘From the Foundation’ from a total of 142. Of Tacitus’ ‘Histories’ are left just 4.25 books of 14, of his ‘Annals’ just 10 books of 18. Dio’s ‘Histories’ have lost 55 of their original 80 volumes, Ammianus’ ‘Histories’ 13 of their 31. Furthermore, to make the best sense of these authors’ annalistic dating we should refer to the original ofﬁcial consular lists, but none of these has survived intact. How can we deal with these problems? The answer is to ﬁll in the gaps and attempt to solve the historical and chronological problems by referring to other sources. The most important in this respect are other writers providing historical details and information useful for establishing relative and absolute chronologies. These include lesser Latin historians such as Velleius Paterculus (c. 19\n\nBC\n\n– c.\n\nAD\n\n30) and\n\nthe biographer Suetonius, and writers of abbreviated histories such as Aurelius Victor and Eutropius noticed above. Also important are Greek\n\n12\n\nA CHRONOLOGY OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\n\nworks touching on Roman history, such as the Dionysius Halicarnassus’ ‘Roman Antiquities’, the ‘Parallel Lives’ of Plutarch (c. AD 46–126), and the ‘Roman History’ of Appian (c. AD 95–c. 165). In a category of their own in this respect are the ‘Jewish Antiquities’ and ‘Jewish War’ of Flavius Josephus (AD 37–c. 100). Though both, as their titles suggest, are focused on Jewish history, they are full of references to Rome. Josephus’ long account of the assassination of the emperor Gaius (Caligula), the following brief interregnum, and the accession of Claudius, all in January AD 41, is unique in the extant literature for its close timetabling of imperial regime change.33 Valuable chronological material is also available from essentially non-historical writings, such as the ‘Natural History’ of Pliny the Elder (AD 23–79), and the ‘Letters’ of his nephew and adopted son, Pliny the Younger (c. AD 61–c. 114), the most famous of which are the two describing the eruption of Vesuvius and the resulting pyroclastic ﬂows that destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum in\n\nAD\n\n79.34 In the later Empire, when emperors were peripatetic, their\n\nactivities may be reconstructed from speeches made in their honour in various cities, the ‘Latin Panegyrics’,35 and, especially, geographical and chronological information embedded in their legislation, collected in the ‘Theodosian Code’ of\n\nAD\n\n438.36 Crucial are literary works preserv-\n\ning the consular fasti. The most important of these are the ‘Calendar of Philocalus’, which gives consular dates from 44\n\nBC\n\nto\n\nAD\n\n354, and\n\nHydatius’ version of a consul list from Constantinople (his Consularia Constantinopolitana) which runs from 509 BC to AD 468.37 Considerable late-imperial material is available from, of course, the Church historians, and from later Greek historians such as Zosimus (late-ﬁfth/early sixth century AD) and Zonaras (twelfth century AD). In addition to these are other important late Christian authors, such as Bishops Ambrose of Milan (c. AD 338–97) and Sidonius Apollinaris of Clermont Ferrand (c. AD 430–c. 485). It should be said that not all literary works are to be trusted. The ‘History’ of Herodian (AD 165–c. 255) is far from reliable; and much of the biographical ‘Augustan History’, especially its lives of co-rulers, usurpers and later-third century emperors, is pure ﬁction. Beside the literary sources, we can call on material remains, principally\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\ninscriptions, papyri, coins and objects from general archaeological research. Many of these give precise dates; others may be dated from their context, style or composition. Often of little signiﬁcance individually, together they form patterns that can add considerably to the history and chronology of the age. Inscriptions are records, public and private, on stone, metal, ceramics, and even on plaster, wood and glass. Their study is known as ‘epigraphy’. Inscriptions were produced in ever greater numbers from the second century\n\nBC\n\n– reﬂecting the developing prosperity of\n\nthe Roman Empire. They decline in number from the third century. At the top of the range is what has been called ‘the queen of Latin inscriptions’: Augustus’ boastful account of his stewardship of the Roman state, known as the Res Gestae (‘Accomplishments’). This was originally published on a great inscription set up before his tomb in Rome. However, it has come down to us mainly from an ofﬁcial copy discovered in Ankara, Turkey, which explains its other name, the Monumentum Ancyranum (‘Ankara Monument’). Not far behind is a Republican inscription, preserving a precious date for the climax of the great ‘Bacchanalian scandal’ of 186\n\n38\n\nBC.\n\nAt the bottom of the range\n\nof inscriptions are the furtive – folded, nailed through and hidden – leaden ‘cursing tablets’ of bitter men and women expressing grudges against their fellows. In the middle is a great mass of documents of every kind, touching on the lives and careers of communities and individuals great and small, from decrees of the Roman Senate at the height of its power in the second century BC,39 through epitaphs of prosperous Romanized Gallic tradesmen on the Moselle in the third century AD,40 to a building-inscription honouring one Masuna, who, styling himself ‘king of the Moorish and Roman peoples’, may have ruled a RomanoMoorish enclave in post-Roman (ﬁfth century) North Africa.41 With regard to chronology, inscriptions include very useful fragments of documents already mentioned. Literary copies of the consular fasti may be checked against what survives of the ‘Fasti Capitolini’. The best evidence we have for the nature of the pre-Julianic calendar comes from an inscription found at Anzio in 1915. And the ‘Acts’ of\n\n14\n\nA CHRONOLOGY OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\n\nthe Arval Brotherhood survive only in epigraphic form. In addition, career inscriptions of leading men of the Roman state – emperors, senators and equestrians – found on monuments and on tombstones, provide invaluable information as to the sequence of political developments and military campaigns, and the date before (terminus ante quem) or after (terminus post quem) which a particular event must have occurred. Though most of these come from the Imperial period, there are interesting Republican examples. One of the earliest celebrates the victory of Gaius Duilius over Carthage in 260 BC; and another, in Greek, preserved at Delphi, is a formal record of Roman diplomatic representations against Macedon in 172\n\nBC.\n\n42\n\nA particularly interesting class\n\nof inscriptions is that of military diplomata – two-leafed certiﬁcates of honourable discharge, carefully dated, in bronze, of retiring members of the armed forces, which provide information about the composition and movements of their units. Like the Monumentum Ancyranum, these were in fact of master-inscriptions in Rome. Inscriptions are still coming to light that recount and date events of which we were previously totally ignorant. Thus, for example, an inscription on an altar found in Augsburg, Bavaria, in 1992, tells, in remarkably few words, of a barbarian incursion into Italy, the withdrawal of the raiders with their booty, including many prisoners, their destruction at the hands of the local provincial governor, the revolt of this governor from the ruling emperor, Gallienus, and his declaration for a usurping rival, in the period AD 260–2.43 After inscriptions, the second most important non-literary source for chronological data are documents written on the crude paper of the period, papyrus, and so referred to as ‘papyri’. Their study is called ‘papyrology’. Papyrus paper was an invention of ancient Egypt, where the heat and dryness of the climate helped conserve the very fragile writing medium that was just one of many items made from the native papyrus reed. Thus papyrus documents are found mainly in the eastern Mediterranean region: in ancient Syria and, of course, in Egypt. Here, for millennia, they enabled and encouraged the development of a highly sophisticated bureaucratic administration – Egyptian, then Greek,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nthen Roman. Like inscriptions, papyri were used for all sorts of documents, from the grandest public to the humblest private. And, again like inscriptions, some papyrus documents are intrinsically important for the historian and the chronologer of Rome. The Feriale Duranum, for example, has come down to us on papyrus. However, the papyrus archive as a whole possesses a characteristic that is of immense use for establishing a general chronology. The Egyptians were scrupulous in dating their documents – by the day of the month and the regnal year of the current ruler. A nice example of this is a papyrus reﬂecting the excitement caused by a visiting Roman dignitary a century before Egypt, still under the Ptolemaic royal family, became a Roman possession. It is dated ‘Year 5’ (the regnal year of king Ptolemy IX); Xandicus 17 (the Greek month and day); ‘Mecheir 17’ (the Egyptian month and day): in our terms, 5 March 112 BC. Under the Empire the regnal years were, of course, those of the reigning Roman emperor or emperors. Thus, almost 400 years later, an arrest warrant for a Christian is dated ‘during the third year of Valerian and Gallienus, Phamenoth 3’: 28 February AD 256.44 When an emperor changed, the regnal year had to change, and the authorities took pains to register this as soon as they could. However, it took time for the news of a change of ruler to reach the capital, Alexandria, and to percolate up-country along the Nile and into desert oases. Helped by the number of papyri available for study, scholars have been able to calculate the different lengths of time this process took, from region to region.45 For well known historical periods this exercise tells us more about communications in Egypt than about imperial chronology. For lesser known periods, in particular that of the third-century ‘Crisis’ (c. AD 250–84), dated papyri are a major means of determining the sequence of emperors and the approximate dates of their accession and death. In this same desperate period, such papyri also indicate periods when Egypt was under the control of usurping emperors or invaders. The evidence has been made easily accessible by Michael Peachin.46 The many material and chronological voids of third-century history can also be ﬁlled from information available from coins, and the\n\n16\n\nA CHRONOLOGY OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\n\nscience of ‘numismatics’. The Romans adopted the idea of issuing coins from the Greeks in the late fourth century BC. The Greeks had already hit upon the idea of using coins as a means of state-advertisement and communication, but, beginning in the late Republic, the Romans took coin-propaganda to its limits. The emperors established the standard coin design (still with us on British coins, so another living fossil) of a main (‘obverse’/‘heads’) side bearing the ruler’s portrait and titles, and a subsidiary (‘reverse’/‘tails’) side with a design proclaiming, in words and pictures, his general or particular aims, activities and achievements. For periods when our historical and chronological knowledge is good the coins, like the papyri, are a complementary source, giving depth to what we already know rather than providing new knowledge. On the other hand, again like the papyri, the coins help shed light on the murky years of the third century. Produced in huge quantities due to high war-related price-inﬂation, they can be sorted by emperor and, within each reign, by explicit dates and by changes in the techniques of their production. This reveals the sequence – year by year and sometimes month by month – in which they were produced in various mints scattered through the Empire. On this basis, numismatists are able to identify the emperors of the period, the order in which they ruled, and for how long. They can also indicate who challenged them, and where and when such challenges were made. It is mainly from the coins, for example, that we can be sure of the names and dates of a series of rebel rulers who controlled the west at the height of the crisis, the so-called ‘Gallic’ emperors: Postumus, Marius, Victorinus and Tetricus (AD 260–74).47 These usurpers faced their own challengers: the coins also corroborate accounts in the scanty literary sources that Postumus was challenged by one Laelianus; and a very rare coin, found only recently (2003) in Britain appears to conﬁrm the existence of another, even more ephemeral challenger to Victorinus or Tetricus, one Domitianus.48 But coin evidence may work the other way. Though the historian Ammianus Marcellinus declares ﬁrmly that Silvanus rebelled against Constantius II in Cologne in 355, the absence of coins minted in his name hints that this may be incorrect.49\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\nInscriptions, papyri and coins may generally be classed as the products of archaeological investigation, but archaeology proper, the broad investigation of a structure or site, also adds to the historical and chronological picture. In recent years, for example, tree-ring dating – ‘dendrochronology’, the science of establishing termini post quem for the construction of buildings by the dating of their constituent timbers – has greatly reﬁned its techniques. It has been used, for example, closely to date the speedy growth of the town of Xanten, on the Rhine, and the building of boats on the Danube.50 However, older – in some cases very old – archaeology remains important. Great excitement was caused by the discovery of three primitive eighth-century dwellings on the Palatine in 1948, because this raised the possibility that one was ‘Romulus’ hut’ (tugurium Romuli), known to have been venerated in situ throughout Roman antiquity, and now, apparently, conﬁrming the traditional foundation-date. Sadly, this has been disputed, with scholars pointing out that other archaeological evidence shows that there were scattered settlements on the Palatine and Forum well before ‘753\n\nBC’\n\n– in fact from no later than the tenth century.\n\nHowever, modern interpretation still leaves open the possibility that some such settlements may have coalesced in the area during the eighth century.51 Even earlier was the ﬁnding, in 1857, of fourth/third century\n\nBC\n\nwall-frescoes in the ‘François’ tomb at the now-vanished\n\nEtruscan town of Vulci, Tuscany, Italy. These depict a number of warriors in violent conﬂict. One is labelled ‘Macstrna’. He may represent ‘Mastarna’, conﬁrming the historical authenticity of a leading ﬁgure of the regal period. In the Roman tradition, Mastarna (which may be a title: ‘leader’) is identiﬁed with Servius Tullius, the sixth (out of seven) canonical king of Rome. However, his graphic depiction in the François tomb has been used to argue that he may have been a ‘non-canonical’ Etruscan ruler in his own right, air-brushed out of history to suit Roman patriotic sentiments.52 Finally, one should not forget the importance of astronomical phenomena mentioned in the sources, from which we can deduce precise dates. Thus, for example, Tacitus’ reference to a major eclipse of the sun\n\n18\n\nA CHRONOLOGY OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\n\nconclusively conﬁrms that the year dated by the consulships of Gaius Vipstanus and Gaius Fonteius is, in our terms, AD 59.53 Overall, the task of establishing a comprehensive chronology of Roman history is massive and difﬁcult, but it also worthwhile and fruitful. What we have is incomplete and patchy – there is a palpable falling-off of circumstantial detail in the late-ﬁrst century as we lose the accounts of Josephus and Tacitus – and has great weaknesses. But it is growing wider and becoming stronger. Chronology makes real progress because, like all good science, it is self-correcting. Hypotheses advanced from the study of one type of evidence may be refuted or conﬁrmed from the study of others. The whole is far greater than the sum of its parts, and such synthesis can open up whole new areas of understanding of Roman history. A prime example of this is Halfmann’s classic Itinera Principum, which draws upon all the material outlined above to reconstruct in remarkable detail – in space and time – the travels of emperors of the Early and High Empire, and all that these involved.54\n\nNotes 1 For a recent survey of these see D.

Similarly, the reality of a reign by Romulus, alleged founder of Rome and the ﬁrst king, from c. 753 to c. 721 BC is now largely discounted by historians as a typical artiﬁcial ‘creation myth’ explaining the name of the city using an eponymous hero. The stories surrounding him, such as his foundation of the Senate and the original tribes and his descent into tyranny, bear all the hallmarks of later tradition rationalizing a haphazard process of evolution into a precise account, and he is confused with the mysterious ancestral god ‘Quirinus’. Nor was there one coherent, reasonably immutable ‘creation legend’ for Rome, emerging early and remaining the same throughout its early history, which might suggest a kernel of truth at the back of it. The name of Rome’s founder was not agreed upon by early historians, and we possess a detailed account of their confusion in the (probably fourth century AD) Roman work Origo Gentis Romanae, now\n\n26\n\nE I G H T H C E N T U RY B C\n\nregarded as less likely to be a Renaissance forgery. It was earliest cited as ‘Romus’, evidently derived from the name, or even as the refugee Trojan prince Aeneas (until it became apparent that the fall of Troy c. 1200 BC was several hundred years too early to be matched with the founding of Rome). This was probably linked to the other early Italian creation-legends for ancient cities that credit Trojans with their foundation, e.g. stories linking Antenor and the head of the Adriatic. Rome, as the emerging leader of the Italian cities, had to have an appropriately prestigious pedigree. Aeneas was recorded as being the only major Trojan hero to escape the sack of the city in the Iliad, though the story of his ﬂight to Italy is less clearly ancient. He certainly had local Latin connections independent of Roman stories, being regarded as the founder of the nearby city of Lavinium; his escape carrying his father Anchises at the fall of Troy is celebrated on sixth century\n\nBC\n\nEtruscan\n\npottery. The ‘Penates’ or household gods of Troy, sacred relics rescued by Aeneas, were supposed to be at Lavinium by c. 300\n\nBC,\n\nand their\n\nshrine may be the ‘Sanctuary of the Thirteen Altars’ in the town which is far older and has Greek architectural inﬂuences. The Roman priesthood, whose rituals went far back into the times of the monarchy, were still attending ceremonies there in the Late Republican era, citing the town as the ancient home of their cults. Aeneas, regarded in the Greek ‘Trojan War’ legends that early Italians would have known as a virtuous and honourable Trojan prince who was a suitable object of veneration for the Romans, was believed to have founded a new Trojan dynasty in the west by the Greeks in Thucydides’ time (end of the ﬁfth century\n\nBC).\n\nHe is ﬁrst declared to\n\nhave been the founder of Rome by the Greek historian Hellanicus, writing as early as the late ﬁfth century BC. An alternative Greek legend connected the city to Odysseus on his Italian voyagings – events in the Odyssey like the encounter with the enchantress Circe could be placed on the Latin coast – or else his ‘Italian’ son Latinus. The legend of Odysseus’ son Latinus ruling a realm in ‘Tyrennia’, i.e. Italy, was already extant in the sixth century BC when it is referred to in the appendix to Hesiod’s Theogony.\n\nE I G H T H C E N T U RY B C\n\n27\n\nIt was unclear to what extent Rome was a ‘planned’ foundation or a gradual development. The Augustan-era Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus, in Book II of his Roman Antiquities, went the furthest in positing a ‘creation’ of a model city and constitution by Romulus. But he used his work throughout to stress Rome’s model, balanced constitution as a superior contrast to its Greek contemporaries, and thus had a political motive for his deductions rather than seeking out the evidence. The alternative scenarios for Rome’s civic origins by the ﬁrst century BC were basically ‘creation’ at one stroke, as in Dionysius’ story, versus gradual ‘evolution’. The former was the normal Greek literary approach to the establishment of a new town, i.e. ctisis with one eponymous founder establishing every aspect of the constitution; the latter was the preferred indigenous Roman historians’ approach, as in Cato’s Origines. (He argued that it was precisely the accumulated wisdom of generations which made Rome’s evolving constitution preferable to Greek city-states’ experiences.) Indeed, Livy in the reign of Augustus also presented the physical creation of the city on ‘seven hills’ (actually four distinct hills and three ‘spurs’) as the accumulated work of the kings, each of them adding on a new area to the original settlement. In archaeological terms, there is probably some truth in the theory – though it is too neat to assign the development to precise foundations of new areas of the city by ‘kings’ in a coherent plan. There were early (eighth to sixth century?) farming villages on most of the city’s hills, but the earliest and largest would appear to be on the two ‘original’ hills allegedly settled by Romulus, the Capitol and the Palatine. The theory that the Caelian owed its name to its ﬁrst settler, an expatriate Etruscan, may also be correct. It is noticeable that the seven names mentioned in Festus’ account of the archaic festival of the Septimontium are not the later seven hills of tradition – the Capitoline, Palatine, Aventine, Caelian, Quirinal, Viminal and Esquiline – but include the two divisions of the Palatine and the three of the Esquiline. This discrepancy may accurately name the ‘original’ seven, from a time of several distinct villages on the Palatine and Esquiline which later merged. The Quirinal is known from\n\n28\n\nE I G H T H C E N T U RY B C\n\narchaeology to have been settled early but is not in the list, so perhaps it and the also-excluded Viminal were not in the original ‘city’. Archaic survivals in Roman religious ritual seem to suggest this, as the ancient priesthood of the Salii were divided into two divisions for the Palatine and the Esquiline; the latter also had a distinct identity in the priesthood of the Luperci who carried out the fertility rituals of the Lupercalia. The special status of Rome’s constitution to Classical historians reﬂected its importance as a world-conqueror. But the nature of Rome’s early society was also unusual, with the established version of events having its founder bring in ‘outcasts’ from all over Latium not the usual body of disciplined settlers from one geographical location. It is unlikely that this story of Romulus’ creation of a ‘sanctuary’ for refugees, outlaws and other social undesirables of low birth at Rome – or the legend of their rape of the Sabine women to acquire wives – was merely slander by disgruntled Greek-Italian victims of Roman expansion in the later fourth century\n\nBC,\n\nas the Romans made no attempt\n\nto ‘tidy up’ or excuse it in their days of glory. In contrast, it seems that Roman historians extolled the moral advantages of their humble, rough and unorthodox origin and contrasted the city’s primitive roots to later ‘decadent’ luxury. Evidently, there was some disagreement over whether Rome should be linked in origin to the other ‘Greek’-founded cities of Italy or to the Greeks’ Trojan rivals. Some form of connection to the early Hellenic world was considered plausible enough for justiﬁcatory legends of a suitable ‘heroic’ founder to be constructed. The ‘Trojan’ link was taken seriously across the region by 263\n\nBC,\n\nwhen the Sicilian city of\n\nSegesta allied itself to Rome, citing their common Trojan origin. But the modern contention that this was invented for political reasons, perhaps at the time when Rome was ﬁghting Pyrrhus of Epirus in the 270s, is unrealistic. The notion of a link to the Early Greek world, if not precisely to the royal house of Troy, was already in local Etruscan culture by the sixth century\n\nBC.\n\nOne theory indeed had the Etruscans\n\nthemselves emigrating to Italy from Lydia, in Asia Minor, to the south of Troy. It was known to Herodotus in the ﬁfth century\n\nBC,\n\nthough\n\nE I G H T H C E N T U RY B C\n\nby the ﬁrst century\n\nBC\n\n29\n\nDionysius preferred to regard the Etruscans as\n\nItalian natives. (The unusual status of the Etruscan language, lacking local or indeed Greek/Asia Minor connections, has deepened the still insoluble mystery.) There was also an anomalous story about a settlement of Arcadians from Greece, led by Evander, on the site centuries before ‘Romulus’ that was persistent enough to be incorporated into Roman tradition. In the time of Augustus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus argued for a whole series of Greek settlements in the region, especially by two waves of Arcadians (the second led by Evander); he had the ‘Latin’ race which existed before Rome’s founding emerge from a racial mix of natives, Arcadians and Trojans. A very early cult of the Greek hero Heracles/Hercules on the site of the city, possibly introduced by early Greek traders, also had to be accommodated, and it would appear from ﬁndings of pottery that there were Greek residents in the area by the eighth century. Dionysius made Heracles/Hercules the father of Latinus, king of the Latins at the time when Aeneas the Trojan landed. Rationalizing historians suggested that Heracles/Hercules had led a military expedition to the far west on the occasion of his search for the cattle of Geryon, one of the ‘Twelve Labours’, and had left a garrison on the site of Rome. By the time of Vergil, who incorporated the story in the Aeneid, it was a commonplace story that the hero had had some of the cattle stolen by the local brigand/giant Cacus, who lived in a cave on the Palatine; the alleged cave was a ﬁrst century BC tourist site. The legend that Romulus was the son of a princess of Alba Longa can also be discounted, not least as the ‘city’ of Alba did not exist in the eighth century. It was rather a sanctuary sacred to the local Latin peoples who gathered there for the annual festival of the Feriae Latinae. A similar cult-centre rather than town existed at Lavinium, the other local centre later associated with Romulus’ ancestors (in this case Aeneas). The notion of the founder as the unusually sired son of a princess also appears with such founding heroes as Perseus of Mycenae and Sargon of Akkad; his casting-out on the orders of a tyrannical relative fearing overthrow is common with the stories of Perseus, Cypselus of\n\n30\n\nE I G H T H C E N T U RY B C\n\nCorinth and the Persian founder Cyrus. Perseus and the Jewish lawgiver Moses were placed in a container in the sea/a river like Romulus and Remus. Cyrus, cast out on the mountainside, was rescued by a shepherd and brought up as a herdsman as the twins were by the herdsman Faustulus; like them his identity was discovered once he was adult and he overthrew his wicked grandfather. In the post-Homeric legends of Troy, Paris was cast out and brought up by a shepherd before being recognized and fulﬁlling the prophecy that he would ruin his family. The ﬁrst veriﬁable references to Romulus having a twin called Remus and to their suckling by a wolf are fourth-century, and the latter legend may have been invented to account for early Rome’s possession of a venerated statue of a wolf (to which the famous ‘twins’ appear to have been added, possibly in the 290s BC). The statue of the wolf itself, now in the Capitoline Museum, may be as early as the sixth century BC and so reﬂect an ancient story told about the ‘founder’. But even in Roman times it was believed by some historians that the ‘wolf’ story arose out of a mistranslation of the slang word lupa, i.e. prostitute, for Romulus’ foster-mother. The myth that the latter, Rhea Silvia, was impregnated by the god Mars was on a par with other stories of divinely sired founders, not only Greek ones (e.g. the Babylonians Sargon and Semiramis.) It used a suitable divinity for a people who were to be so successful in war. Alternatively, one story had it that Rhea Silvia was impregnated by a spark from the sacred ﬁre that she tended as a priestess. It has parallels with other Italian myths, though also with the Greek legend of the similarly imprisoned and magically impregnated Danae – mother of Perseus, ‘founder’ of the archaic Peloponnesian military power Mycenae. It is notable that not all the early Roman historians were agreed that Remus was killed by his twin in a dispute over where to site the city, as was stated in the later version of the legend. But the notion of situating Romulus’ proposed town on the Palatine and Remus’ on the Aventine, with the former as the victor in the contest, probably reﬂects memories of the Palatine being the more important site in the new ‘city’. The steeper and more defensible Capitol may have been the citadel for times of refuge from attack, as in the legend of the war with\n\nE I G H T H C E N T U RY B C\n\n31\n\nthe Sabines. The idea that the commander’s daughter Tarpeia betrayed it to the attackers and was then thrown off the ‘Tarpeian Rock’ as her punishment would have arisen from a legend about that site’s naming. There does now appear to have been a very early wall on the Palatine Hill, site of Romulus’ supposed ﬁrst settlement, so there may be some truth behind the legend of an eighth-century ‘foundation’. But there were buildings on several other hills at the time, some of them dateable to earlier centuries, and the existing story of an orderly foundation of a state by one leader probably ‘tidies up’ a far more haphazard and complex process. It is more likely that there was a ‘union’ of several existing villages, probably for defence and involving the creation of a joint urban centre in the Forum Romanum (whose earliest buildings can be dated to the late seventh century). The traditional conﬂict and then union with the Sabines following Romulus’ seizure of their womenfolk and the resultant dual kingship of Romulus and the Sabine leader Titus Tatius may also reﬂect some real events, particularly given that it is so confused a story. It is likely that some physical record of Tatius’ existence required later Roman historians to have to write him into the legend of Romulus. There are certainly traces of Sabine inﬂuence in Roman Latin terminology, and there was some sort of tradition in early Roman times of Sabine connections with the Quirinal Hill. Traditionally, Romulus, the founder of the Senate as well as the city, turned into a tyrant and after acquiring an oppressive bodyguard was secretly murdered by the senators on the Campus Martius after a reign of around 30 years, c. 721\n\nBC.\n\nHis disappearance was thus due\n\nto the murderers cutting up his body ‘in situ’ and smuggling the bits away, not his apotheosis in a cloud to the heavens to become the god Quirinus. But this story bears too many hallmarks of later interpolation and retrospection to be considered reliable. It is possible that the names and very early dating of the ﬁrst three ‘tribes’ of the Roman citizenry are genuine. The local Ramnes (allegedly called after Romulus), Sabine Tities, and Etruscan Luceres were supposed to represent the three distinct peoples who had settled early Rome, living respectively on the Palatine, Quirinal and Caelian Hills.\n\n32\n\nE A R LY S E V E N T H C E N T U RY B C – C . ? 6 7 0 – ? 6 4 0 B C\n\nThe foundation of the 30 curiae, a form of organization by family for religious/ceremonial purposes probably based on ten subdivisions of each tribe – was also ascribed to Romulus. The system was of unclear purpose and origin even to the writers of the Late Republic, when an archaic Comitia Centuriata, an assembly organized by curiae, met to confer commands but many citizens did not know their curia. It was virtually unique to Rome and had no obvious Republican political purpose, so it probably did originate in some obscure tribal arrangement of monarchic times that became ‘fossilized’ as tradition.\n\nThe monarchy Early seventh century\n\nBC\n\nIf there is any truth behind early Roman\n\ntradition, the most probable time for the reign of Numa Pompilius, a Sabine and founder of the basic Roman religious observances and their calendar. Numa’s reign, if it occurred, was too early for there to be truth behind the story that his philosophy was inﬂuenced by Pythagoras. The Pythagoras story may be dated from the late fourth century\n\nBC,\n\nwhen Aristoxenus of Tarentum wrote that he had Roman pupils. The precise dates of 716–678 given for Numa’s reign by the ﬁrst century BC\n\nare unveriﬁable, and the length of several royal reigns are perhaps\n\nunfeasibly long. But it is probable that sceptical modern historians (e.g. the Swedish archaeologist E. Gjerstad, who dates the Forum to c. 575) who have sought to compress the reigns of all seven kings into the sixth century to complement physical evidence of urban building in Rome are also inaccurate. That would give the successive kings far shorter reigns than the oral traditions about them agreed. c. ?670–?640\n\nBC\n\nReign of Tullus Hostilius, a warlike leader and erro-\n\nneously claimed to be the conqueror and annexer of the state of Alba Longa. By the time of Livy, it was believed that the conﬂict was settled by an archaic, Homeric-style ‘duel of champions’ between the three Roman Horatii brothers and the three Alban Curatii. In fact, Alba was not even a city at the time.\n\nC. 635–610 –?578 BC\n\n33\n\nIt is, however, possible that this story reﬂects Rome’s militarily based assumption of the leadership of the local league of Latin settlements which used Alba as a common cult-centre. Tullus was also supposed to have settled the Caelian, according to Cicero; this is at odds with Dionysius (who named Ancus Marcius as the founder) and Emperor Claudius (who placed the eponymous settler Caeles Vibenna as a patron of Servius Tullius). c. 635–610 (Tr. 641–617)\n\nBC\n\nReign of Ancus Marcius, alleged grand-\n\nson of Numa; supposed annexation of land as far as the coast and foundation of port of Ostia. Ancus was remembered as ‘the Good’ in the Late Republican time of Lucretius, and was supposed to have built the ﬁrst bridge over the Tiber (the Pons Sublicius). c. 610–?578 (Tr. 616–578)\n\nBC\n\nReign of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus\n\n(Lucumo), an immigrant from Tarquinii in Etruria and son of exiled Greek Demaratus of Corinth, assisted by his wife Tanaquil. Around 600 the ﬁrst substantial stone buildings in Rome appear, including the Regia palace in the Forum and the ﬁrst Senate House (Curia Hostilia). Traditionally, successful campaigns were fought against the Latins, Sabines and Etruscans. In reality there was political conﬂict in Corinth in the 650s which led to the overthrow of the rule of the ‘Bacchiad’ aristocratic oligarchy by the new ‘tyranny’ of Cypselus. Accordingly, the exile of Lucumo’s father around this time is regarded as historically plausible. It has been suggested by modern historians that the civic institutions and buildings ascribed to the dynasty of the Tarquins and Servius Tullius, i.e. from the time of c. 600, reﬂect a vague historical memory of the transformation of a loose alliance of villages on the Roman hills into a proper ‘city’ designed on the pattern of the Greek foundations in Southern Italy, logically by the Greek emigrant Tarquinius Priscus. ?578 BC Assassination of Tarquinius by the sons of Ancus Marcius who want the throne, but Tanaquil conceals his death from the people until\n\n34\n\n?578?–?534 BC\n\nshe has secured the succession of Servius Tullius who she pretends her husband nominated. ?578?–?534\n\nBC\n\nReign of Servius Tullius, probably son- in-law of\n\nTarquinius Priscus and agreed by Roman historians to be a freed slave and son of a prisoner-of-war. There is a possibility of identiﬁcation with a former mercenary captain, the Etruscan ‘Mastarna’ who brought the force of his late commander Caelius Vibenna to Rome to settle the ‘Caelian’ Hill, according to Emperor Claudius’ researches in ancient records. The reigns of the sixth-century kings are more likely to have been accurately remembered than those in the seventh century, though with literary embellishments. We cannot know how much of the existing tradition was transcribed rather than embellished by Livy at the end of the ﬁrst century BC, given the non-survival of his sources. Supposed building of ‘Servian Walls’ around all seven hills. No early wall of this extent has been traced, and it is evident that the Gauls in 390/86 were able to penetrate the city fairly easily. Accordingly, it is more likely that there was a shorter defensive rampart from the Esquiline to the Quirinal, protecting the city from attack from the east. Division of Rome into seven urban districts, coupled with reorganization of the citizen body to replace the three original ‘tribes’ with 21 (?) new ones based on locality of residence not family. It is more likely that Servius created the four urban tribes and not all of the 17 rural ones; some of the latter (e.g. the Claudii) are traceable to the early years of the Republic. Fabius Pictor confusingly claimed that there were 30 tribes from the time of Servius; this and the statement in Varro that Servius divided up the city’s rural land into two sections have led to claims that Servius’ Rome possessed some land and peoples lost after c. 509. But the subdivisions of the rural land, the pagi (ﬁelds), may not have been done to give one area to each tribe. For the record, the four urban tribes were: Palatina, Collatina, Esquilina, Suburana. The 17 rural tribes were: Aemilia\n\n?578?–?534 BC\n\n35\n\nCamilia Claudia Clustumina Cornelia Fabia Galeria Horatia Lemonia Menenia Papiria Pollia Pupinia Romilia Sergia Voltinia Voturia (The only one not connected to a family ‘clan’ name was ‘Clustumina’, which probably has a geographical origin linked to the town of Crustumerium. Rome conquered this in c. 499 according to Livy, and he has this tribe being formed in 495 to make the total thenceforward 21.) Supposedly, the ‘classes’ of citizens, based on wealth, were also created and divided into ‘centuries’; each class was to bear a particular form of weaponry for military service. The details of the divisions and the weaponry required of them are virtually identical in Livy and Dionysius, except regarding the lowest classes; their lists probably came from ancient records which did not specify all the details about the latter’s weaponry. But it is anachronistic to assign the organization back into the sixth century\n\nBC,\n\nand it probably represents the ‘deﬁnitive’\n\nrequirements for soldiers’ equipment of a later date. What is more likely is that the ‘Servian origin’ of the centuries is genuine. It was arranged for military purposes, and had a logical political role for an ambitious monarch in replacing the earlier arrangement of the soldiery on a\n\n36\n\n?534–?509 BC\n\ntribal/family basis by one under State patronage. In 1930 Plinio Fraccaro pointed out that the Roman legion – a word originally meaning ‘levy’ (legio), i.e. the whole army of citizen-soldiers – was designed to consist of 6,000 men, divided into 60 centuries (of mainly heavy infantry). Thus it could have been set up contemporaneously with the creation of the centuries. The usual Roman Republican legion from the ﬁfth century had only 3,000 heavy infantry, supplemented by other lightly armed troops to bring the total up to 4,200. The original Roman army of one legion could thus have been of 3,000 men based on 30 divisions of men each of which was originally supplied by one curia before the centuries were created. But by the ﬁfth and fourth centuries Rome had two legions in service. The expansion of Rome in the sixth century would have led to the doubling in size to two armies, totalling 6,000 men in all. This then became the accepted ‘ofﬁcial’ size for a later legion. The resulting army may have adapted the Greek institution of the phalanx of hoplites, which was based on a similar levy of citizens with their military functions and required equipment divided according to their ﬁnancial capacities. As in Greece, the creation of a ‘citizen army’ could have had a political motive in decreasing the power of the wealthy aristocrats. ?534–?509\n\nBC\n\nReign of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, traditionally\n\nson but more logically grandson of Tarquinius Priscus (as suggested by L. Calpurnius Piso in the second century\n\nBC,\n\nat variance with the\n\nearlier version related by Fabius Pictor). His wife is supposed to have organized her father Servius’ overthrow and then driven over him in her chariot – but this may be a mythical explanation of the name of the street where the incident supposedly occurred. Conquest of Gabii and Pometia; traditionally Tarquinius carried out the former by a ruse, with his son pretending to ﬂee Tarquinius’ tyranny and being taken in by Gabii which he then betrayed to his father. (The story bears suspicious similarities to a Greek legend about Corinth). Colonization of Signia and Circeii; alliance with Tusculum\n\n?509/8 BC\n\n37\n\nwhose ruler Octavius Mamilius marries Tarquinius’ daughter; construction of grand monumental stone complex of Temples of Jupiter ‘Optimus Maximus’, Juno, and Minerva on Capitoline Hill. The Temple of Jupiter is supposed to have involved the employment of mastersculptors from Veii; the start of work was variously ascribed to both of the two Tarquins but the construction of one building is unlikely to have taken the decades from Priscus’ reign to c. 509.\n\nRoman Republic From expulsion of the kings to the sack of Rome ?509/8\n\nBC\n\nAlternatively, Dionysius of Halicarnassus dates it to 508/7\n\nand Polybius to 508; an inscription in Rome dated to Flavius’ aedileship in 303 dated that year as being 204 since the expulsion of the king. Tarquinius and family are expelled, probably by a group of the leading noble ‘patrician’ clans and supposedly after the rape of Lucretia by Tarquinius’ son Sextus; revolt led by the king’s nephew Lucius Iunius Brutus and his ally Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus. The ofﬁcial story has the new Republic exiling all royals and banning the names of Tarquinius and King – which is at odds with the leadership of the new state by one consul with that name and the other related to the exiled ruler. A dual supreme magistracy, the consulship, is created with its duration limited to one year. Power is now in the overall hands of the Senate, the former advisory body of noblemen supposedly created by Romulus. This is dominated by the ‘patrician’ families, a closed hereditary elite of senior dynasties who dominate the early consulship. However, there were other families represented in the Senate of nonpatrician rank, who some historians have assumed to be the conscripti in the traditional formula for addressing the Senate, ‘patres et conscripti’. Indeed, there were a number of non-patrician consuls in the ﬁrst years of the Republic – among them the ‘liberator’ Marcus Junius Brutus. It is not certain if the non-patricians were brought in individually on\n\n38\n\n509/8 OR 508/7 BC\n\nan individual basis by vote of the others – a ‘life peerage’ element on the British parallel. What is clear is that, as in Greece, tension between the social classes (and between the patrician and non-patrician rich) stoked a ‘Conﬂict of Orders’ in the following century and a third, reaching peaks in the 490s and 360s. Arguably, the increase in the percentage of senior ofﬁces held by patricians (79 per cent in the years 509–483, 99 per cent by the years 427–401) suggests a move by the latter to exclude those of plebeian origin from power and a reason for those excluded to ally with the lower orders against them. 509/8 or 508/7 BC Consuls: Lucius Iunius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus; latter replaced by Publius Valerius. Brutus executes his sons for treasonous contacts with the Tarquins’ envoys who are in Rome to request return of the family property; Brutus killed in battle with forces of Veii invading on Tarquinius’s behalf. Popular suspicion of intentions of the sole consul Valerius are reassured, supposedly by his public-spirited demolition of his ostentatiously grand new house, and he wins the title of ‘Publicola’ (‘People’s Friend’); Spurius Lucretius, replacement second consul, dies and is succeeded by Marcus Horatius. The dedication of the ﬁrst Temple of Jupiter ‘Optimus Maximus’ on the Capitoline Hill, centre of Roman religious ceremonial, is supposed to have taken place in this year, the ﬁrst of the Republic, and may well have been reckoned accurately if some sort of record (traditionally, the annual driving in of a nail by the year’s consuls) was kept; traditionally, the ceremony was carried out by Marcus Horatius. The annual ceremony of the nail occurred on the Ides of September, which thus may have been the date of dedication. The king’s religious functions seem to have passed not to the chief priest (pontifex maximus) but to a separately chosen rex sacrorum. He was barred from the Senate and other political roles unlike the pontifex maximus and the members of the priestly colleges (ﬂamines), a presumed move to neutralize the former royal joint political/religious role. One modern theory has it that the royal role had already been reduced\n\n507/6 BC\n\n39\n\nto that of a powerless rex sacrorum before the fall of the Tarquinii, and that the latter were not traditional, ‘sacral’ kings in the manner of Numa and Ancus but popularly supported ‘life magistrates’ in the manner of the contemporary Greek ‘tyrannies’. Their magisterial role was thus the target of the 509/8 ‘revolution’, and the supreme magistracy was thereafter limited to one year and divided between two men. It is also debatable if the home of the pontifex maximus in the Forum, the Regia (i.e. ‘Palace’), where he carried out religious ceremonies and the tutelary cults of the ‘Lares and Penates’ were based, was the original residence of the Tarquinii or of the rex sacrorum. Later legend has some kings living elsewhere, e.g. Tullus on the Velia, Ancus on the Sacra Via, and Priscus on the Nova Via. The ﬁrst treaty with Carthage may also have taken place in this year as was later reckoned, and is certainly historically plausible given Carthage’s current interest in the Tyrrhenian coast and rivalry with the Greek city-states further south. Polybius dates it at this consulship, though in the year 507/6 not 508/7, and reproduces its terms from an inscription; Livy says that the Romano-Carthaginian treaty of 306\n\nBC\n\nwas the third but only mentions that of 348 (the second?) explicitly. 507/6 BC Consuls: P. Valerius and Titus Lucretius. Attack on Rome by Lars Porsena of Clusium, overlord of most of the Etruscan city-states and ally of the Tarquins; Marcus Horatius ‘Cocles’ defends the wooden Tiber bridge alone until it can be demolished. Porsena fortiﬁes the Janiculum and besieges Rome; Caius Mucius attempts to assassinate him and on his capture allegedly thrusts his hand into a brazier to show his scorn for death or torture, winning the name of ‘Scaevola’ (‘Left-Handed’). The Senate makes a treaty with Porsena, admitting him as overlord, but are not required to accept Tarquinius back; Porsena goes on to Latium to attack Aricia, but is defeated and Tarquinius’ son Arruns is killed. The legendary account of these events rationalized by Livy 500 years later may reﬂect a true story in that Roman tradition was clearly awkward at having to admit to some sort of submission to Porsena, an\n\n40\n\n506/5 BC–499/8 BC\n\nembarrassing episode which the Romans would never have invented voluntarily. Horatius’ exploit was probably remembered due to the statue erected to him which Livy records, but Mucius more likely reﬂects an attempt by his family to explain their traditional cognomen ‘Scaevola’. Cicero and Pliny both believed that Porsena had occupied Rome, but in that case he certainly did not restore Tarquinius as his client. 506/5 BC Consuls: Spurius Lartius and Titus Herminius. 505/4\n\nBC\n\nConsuls: Publius Lucretius and Publius Valerius Publicola.\n\nPorsena’s ﬁnal request to Rome on Tarquinius’s behalf is refused, and he agrees a new treaty with the Senate returning land he took three years earlier; Tarquinius ﬂees to his son-in-law Mamilius of Tusculum. 504/3 BC Consuls: Marcus Valerius and Publius Postumius. Successful war with Sabines; consuls celebrate triumph. Attius Clausus leads the clan of the Claudii to Roman territory, where they are later made an additional rural ‘tribe’. 503/2\n\nBC\n\nConsuls: Menenius Agrippa and Publius Postumius. Death\n\nof Publius Valerius Publicola. Roman ‘colonies’ of Pometia and Cora unsuccessfully revolt with aid of the Aurunci who are invaded; triumph held. 502/1\n\nBC\n\nConsuls: Opiter Verginius and Spurius Cassius. Pometia\n\nstormed and inhabitants enslaved. 501/00\n\nBC\n\nConsuls: Postumus Cominius and Titus Lartius. Lartius or\n\nMarcus Valerius appointed ﬁrst ‘dictator’ due to threat of invasion from Mamilius and the ‘Latin League’ on Tarquinius’ behalf. 500/499 BC Consuls: Servius Sulpicius and Manlius Tullius. 499/8 BC Consuls: Titus Aebusius and Gaius Vetusius. Siege of Fidenae;\n\n498/7 BC–495/4 BC\n\n41\n\ncapture of Crustumera; Praeneste leaves ‘Latin League’ to join Rome. Aulus Postumius dictator, with Titus Aebutius as deputy, ‘Master of the Horse’; Tarquinius inspires Mamilius and the ‘Latin League’ to attack Rome, but they are defeated at battle of Lake Regillus near Tusculum where Marcus Valerius, Mamilius and Tarquinius’ surviving son Sextus are among the casualties; triumph celebrated. The foundation of the Forum Temple of the Divine Twins, Castor and Pollux, is ascribed in Roman legend to their helping the Roman forces at the battle and announcing the news to Rome. Dionysius of Halicarnassus has the dictator Postumius found the Temple of Ceres, the nature-goddess (thus connected to the populist issue of adequate supplies of grain), on the Aventine after the battle and endow it with loot. The temple and its sanctuary became a cult-centre for the plebeians, while the worship of the Divine Twins in the Forum was run by patricians; a Greek cultural inspiration is possible. 498/7 BC Consuls: Quintus Cloelius and Titus Lartius. Traditional date for fall of Crustumerium to Rome; their inhabitants formed the ﬁnal one of the early rural ‘tribes’, the ‘Clustumina’. 497/6\n\nBC\n\nConsuls: Aulus Sempronius and Marcus Minucius. Temple\n\nof Saturn dedicated and the December holiday of Saturnalia first celebrated. 496/5 BC Consuls: Aulus Postumius and Titus Verginius. 495/4\n\nBC\n\nConsuls: Appius Claudius and Publius Servilius. Death of\n\nTarquinius Superbus at court of Aristodemus of Cumae. Number of ‘tribes’ traditionally raised to 21. Colony of Signia consolidated; Temple of Mercury dedicated. Threat of war with the Volscian hill-tribes East of Latium, who gain support of their neighbours the Hernici but fail to interest the Latins to whom the grateful Romans return prisoners-of-war. Discontent in Rome over the plight of debtors at the mercy of\n\n42\n\n494/3 BC–491/0\n\npatrician landholders, with leader of the Claudii later held to have led the uncompromising party in Senate, though this may be because of later reputation of the family; Volscian attack defeated. 494/3\n\nBC\n\nConsuls: Aulus Verginius and Titus Vetusius. Continuing\n\ndiscontent over plight of debtors leads to appointment of dictator Manlius Valerius; Valerius ﬁghts the Sabines while Vetusius drives off an Aequian attack on dependent Latin territory. The Senate still refuses any legislation to relieve debtors and threatens to use troops against mutinous meetings of the rest of populace, the ‘plebs’; ‘Aventine Secession’ of the ‘plebs’ who withdraw from the city en masse, probably to the ‘Sacred Mount’ near the River Anio; Menenius Agrippa leads mission to the Mount to negotiate and measures of relief are conceded and two special ofﬁcials, ‘tribunes’ immune from arrest, created to represent the people’s interests. Caius Licinius and Lucius Albinus are the ﬁrst tribunes. 493/2 BC Consuls: Spurius Cassius Vicellinus and Postumus Cominius Auruncus. Treaty with the Latins (known as the ‘Foedus Cassianum’ after its negotiator, consul Cassius); Volsci are defeated at Antium, and Longula and Polusca are captured; the heroism of Caius Marcius in the capture of Corioli leads to his nickname of ‘Coriolanus’. 492/1\n\nBC\n\nConsuls: Titus Geganius and Publius Minucius Augurinus.\n\nShortage of grain leads to its importing from Sicily; epidemic prevents Volscian attack. 491/0 Consuls: Marcus Minucius Augurinus and Aulus Sempronius. Caius Marcius ‘Coriolanus’ opposes the proposed sale of cheap corn and wins popular hatred; after conﬂict with the tribunate he is exiled and joins the Volsci; Attius Tullius, their leading opponent of Rome, joins a Volscian party visiting Rome for celebration of ‘Great Games’ and warns the Senate that his countrymen are planning to seize city so they are expelled, and then works on their resentment to have war declared.\n\n487/6 BC–483/2 BC\n\n43\n\nHe and Marcius lead the invasion and Rome is besieged; traditionally the Senate sends out Marcius’ mother Veturia and wife Volumnia to persuade him to withdraw after ofﬁcial negotiators are rejected. Marcius withdraws the Volscian army and goes into exile, but Volsci later invade again with the Aequi; the two end up ﬁghting each other. (The dating by Livy for the period from the Coriolanus episode, placed at 491/0 using his reckoning from the time of the ‘Aventine Secession’ in 494, to the consulship of Cassius in 486 is imprecise.) 487/6\n\nBC\n\nConsuls: Titus Siccius Sabinus and Caius Aquillius Tuscus.\n\nHernici defeated. 486/5\n\nBC\n\nConsuls: Spurius Cassius Vicellinus and Proculus Verginius.\n\nPeace with Hernici, who surrender half their territory (Livy; the Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus says they did not.) It is divided between Rome and the Latins by a proposal from Cassius; he attempts to include allegedly illegally held private land in Rome in this annexation, thus creating a body of land for popular distribution in Rome’s ﬁrst agrarian law. He also proposes to repay the money made from a sale of grain to Sicily to the public. His fellow-consul Verginius organizes defeat of this legislation, on the grounds that its populism implies a political threat to the constitution from Cassius. 485/4\n\nBC\n\nConsuls: Servius Cornelius and Quintus Fabius. Ex-consul\n\nCassius tried and executed and house demolished, supposedly for fear of his populist measures which might imply intention to seize power. 484/3 BC Consuls: Fabius Caeso and Lucius Aemilius. Defeat of a revolt by the Volsci and Aequi. 15 July: Dedication of Temple of Castor (and Pollux) in Forum, built following battle of Lake Regillus. 483/2\n\nBC\n\nConsuls: Caeso Fabius and Lucius Valer"
