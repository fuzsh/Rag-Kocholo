        "text": "There is a widespread belief that Roman legionaries were short and compensated for their poor physical conditions, e.g. in clashes with Gauls or Germans, with great discipline, organization and equipment. How was it really?\n\nThe Dacian king – Decebalus, after the defeat of the Dacians in the Second Roman-Dacian War (at the turn of the first and second centuries CE), decided to commit suicide rather than subject Roman rule. This ruler is worshiped to this day. His cult was revived in Romania, whose lands were once within the Dacian state. In his memory, it was decided to carve a huge image into the rock wall.\n\nThe graphics show legionaries from the reign of Octavian Augustus. In mass culture, an erroneous image of Roman legions as a formation composed of equally equipped soldiers has formed.\n\nThe only bust of Julius Caesar that has survived to our time and was made during his lifetime. To this day, this image of Caesar is considered the most reliable. This is evidenced by irregular dictator head shape.\n\nHunting was staged in the amphitheater arenas, where a tunic warrior stood in front of a wild animal, armed only with a sword or spear. Sometimes he was accompanied by a venator equipped with a bow, whip or spear, which he often fought for money or glory.\n\nArena and the audience of the Colosseum were covered up with a giant sail (velarium), which was supposed to protect viewers from the sun and rain. It was attached to large columns on the Coliseum Mountain and anchored to the ground with large ropes.\n\nRoman marble sculpture showing the sleeping Silenus. The object dates to the 1st century CE. Silenus was one of Bacchus’ companions (Greek Dionysus) and his teacher. He was a god of nature.\n\nGladiators received cash prizes for their win. In the event of a decisive and effective victory, the warrior additionally received a laurel wreath. The greatest reward was the release from fighting in the arena, which was shown by handing over a wooden sword. In contrast, convicts and criminals, forced by the authorities to fight, were given freedom if they survived more than three years of fighting.\n\nRoman fresco depicting a pygmy soldier with a large raised cleaver, hung above the child outstretched on the table. One woman holds the child, another imploringly kneels before a three-person tribunal, as if asking for mercy."
