        "text": "Any student of Latin lyric poetry will tell you that Catullus’ poems get pretty raunchy, obsessed with genitalia, semen, and sex in general. But one of his poems is so vulgar that an uncensored modern English translation wasn’t published until the 20th century.\n\nThe text below includes a translation of the poem which is NSFW and includes sexually violent language.\n\nCatullus’ Carmen 16, sometimes referred to by its first line, “Paedicabo ego vos et irrumabo,” is only of several poems addressed to two men: Marcus Furius Bibaculus (who had an affair with Catullus’ young male lover Juventius) and Marcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus. In most of his poems addressed to Furius and Aurelius, Catullus heaps abuse onto his cohorts, and in this particular one, he threatens them with explicit rape:\n\nPaedicabo ego vos et irrumabo,\n\nAureli pathice et cinaede Furi,\n\nqui me ex versiculis meis putastis,\n\nquod sunt molliculi, parum pudicum.\n\nNam castum esse decet pium poetam\n\nipsum, versiculos nihil necesse est,\n\nqui tum denique habent salem ac leporem,\n\nsi sunt molliculi ac parum pudici\n\net quod pruriat\n\nincitare possunt,\n\nnon dico pueris, sed his pilosis,\n\nqui duros nequeunt movere lumbos.\n\nVos quod milia multa basiorum\n\nlegistis, male me marem putatis?\n\nPaedicabo ego vos et irrumabo.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, here’s a rather NSFW translation:\n\nI will sodomize you and face-fuck you,\n\nbottom Aurelius and catamite Furius,\n\nyou who think, because my poems\n\nare sensitive, that I have no shame.\n\nFor it’s proper for a devoted poet to be moral\n\nhimself, [but] in no way is it necessary for his poems.\n\nIn point of fact, these have wit and charm,\n\nif they are sensitive and a little shameless,\n\nand can arouse an itch,\n\nand I don’t mean in boys, but in those hairy old men\n\nwho can’t get it up.\n\nBecause you’ve read my countless kisses,\n\nyou think less of me as a man?\n\nI will sodomize you and face-fuck you.\n\nAnd here’s a more playful version published by Carl Sesar in 1974:\n\nUp your ass and in your mouth\n\nAurelius, you too, Furius, you cocksuckers,\n\ncalling me dirt because my poems\n\nhave naughty naughty words in them.\n\nJust the poet’s got to be a boy scout\n\nfellas, not his goddamn poems.\n\nAnyway look, they’ve got wit, sass,\n\nand sure they’re lewd and lascivious,\n\nand can get somebody pretty hard-up too,\n\nI mean not just young kids, but you hairy guys\n\nwho can barely get your stiff asses going,\n\nso just because you read about a lot of kisses\n\nyou want to put something nasty on me as a man?\n\nFuck you, up your ass and in your mouth.\n\nNow certainly English-speaking people who could read Latin knew what was going on in the poem, and people would certainly translate it privately. (And it was translated into other languages.) But when the poem was translated—or perhaps more accurately adapted—into English for publication, the translators avoided literally translating certain parts of the poem. In his 1973 essay on the poem, University of Nebraska-Lincoln classics professor Thomas Nelson Winter notes, “Until recently, English as forthright as the Latin could never be printed.”\n\nOften the lines that were considered the most offensive—the first two lines and the repeated final line—were left out of English translation or replaced with the original Latin. Even many mid-20th century translations of the poem were extraordinarily coy with the first two lines; F. A. Wright’s translation began, “I’ll show you I’m a man,” while Jack Lindsay’s started with “Aurelius down, you’ll knuckle under!/ Furius up! Admit your blunder!”\n\nSo why is this particular poem so filthy? Well, in the grand scheme of Latin poetry (or even Catullus), it’s not that bad. But the reason that Catullus used this particular language, language of sexual penetration, seems to be due to some challenge to Catullus’ masculinity. But Winter suggests that at the time it was written, Catullus’ language wouldn’t have been nearly as shocking as it was to later, English-speaking readers:\n\nIn the sense that this is the normal language of those to whom he directs the poem, it is not obscene. Obscenity, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder.\n\nThe implication is that it’s not the writer, but the readers, who made the poem so vulgar."
