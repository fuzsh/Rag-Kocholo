        "text": "Roman Senator and consul who was a friend of the Roman emperors Augustus and Tiberius\n\nMarcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus (flourished second half of 1st century BC and first half of 1st century AD) was a Roman Senator who was a friend of the first two Roman emperors Augustus and Tiberius.[1]\n\nFamily background\n\n[edit]\n\nMaximus was born and raised in Rome. His birth date is unknown; however, it is not earlier than 24 BC, and possibly in 14 BC.[2] His father was the literary patron Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, suffect consul in 31 BC.[3] Maximus was the son born to Corvinus’ second marriage to his unknown wife.[4] The last poem of the poet Ovid (Ex Ponto IV.16) reveals that his mother was a Roman noblewoman called Aurelia Cotta. Further evidence that Aurelia Cotta was his mother was that, although he was born into the gens Valeria, he was later adopted into the Aurelii Cottae.[5]\n\nHis birth name is unknown, and so he is only known by his adopted name. From his father's previous marriage, Maximus had an older paternal half-sibling: Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus, who served as a consul in 3 BC.[3] He also had a full sister, Valeria Messalina, who married Titus Statilius Taurus, consul in AD 11, and Maximus was the great-uncle of Lollia Paulina[6] who was the third wife of Caligula and a relation to Statilia Messalina, the third wife of Nero. Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, consul in 58, may have been his son.\n\nOvid\n\n[edit]\n\nMaximus was a friend[7] and patron of the poet Ovid.[2] He was one of the people to whom Ovid had addressed various letters which have survived to the present.[8] Maximus was with Ovid in the year 8, when news arrived of Ovid's banishment.[9] Maximus afterwards provided material, psychological, and possibly financial support to his friend.[9] Although his friendship with Augustus didn't affect Ovid's banishment, Ovid believed as late as 11 that Maximus could successfully intercede with the Princeps.[1]\n\nPolitical career\n\n[edit]\n\nMaximus was a leading public figure throughout the reign of Tiberius[7] and until at least 32, remained close to the emperor.[1] After the trial and execution of Marcus Scribonius Libo Drusus in 16, Maximus in the Roman Senate proposed that the bust of Drusus should be barred from his descendants' funeral-parades.[10] This proposal was politically significant, as the history of this particular punishment shows that Maximus held Drusus to be an enemy of the Roman people - hostis populi Romani.[1] Maximus probably anticipated Tiberius’ approval. A prominent noble allied to the government would not knowingly exasperate the Princeps.[1]\n\nHe became consul in 20.[11] During his consulship, Maximus would ask the Roman Senate to speak first, for, when the emperor presided, it was custom to include officials among those called upon for their views.[12]\n\nAccording to a Greek inscription found at Ephesus, sometime after his consulship, Maximus became the Proconsul of Asia.[5] The inscription, which honours Maximus, is dedicated to him by Alexander son of Memnon, to whom Maximus was both friend and benefactor. The inscription is dated from 25/26.[13] The Greek inscription reads:\n\nΜάρκον Αὐρήλιον\n\nΚότταν Μάξιμον\n\nΜεσσαλεῖνον τον\n\nγενόμενον ἀνθύ-\n\nπατον Ἀλέξαν-\n\nδρος Μέμνονος τὸν\n\nἑαυτοῦ φίλον καὶ εὐ-\n\nεργέτην\n\nIn 32, Tiberius successfully defended Maximus when prosecuted for accusing Caligula of homosexuality, ridiculing a banquet held to Tiberius’ late mother as a funeral feast, and boasting of Tiberius’ protection when he went to law.[2]\n\nReputation\n\n[edit]\n\nMaximus was a poet and orator whom Tacitus condemns for his extravagant life-style, his shameful behavior and servility.[14] Pliny the Elder describes him as an extravagant gourmet.[15] Juvenal represents him as a patron of the arts.[16]\n\nOne of Maximus' freedmen, Marcus Aurelius Zosimus, was buried on the Appian Way outside of Rome with his wife, Aurelia Saturnia.[17] His epitaph is one of the few Roman funeral inscriptions that expresses patron-freedman relations in poetic terms.[7] Below is a copy of the Latin inscription and an English translation:\n\nM. Aurelius Cottae Maximi\n\nZosimus, accensus patroni.\n\nLibertinus eram, fateor: sed facta legetur\n\npatrono Cotta nobilis umbra mea.\n\nQui mihi saepe libens census donavit equestris\n\nqui iussit natos tollere quos aleret\n\nquique suas commisit opes mihi semper, et idem\n\ndotavit natas ut pater ipse meas,\n\nCottanumque meum produxit honore tribuni\n\nquem fortis castris Caesaris emeruit.\n\nQuid non Cotta dedit? qui nune et carmina tristis\n\nhaec dedit in tumulo conspicienda meo.\n\nAurelia Saturnia, Zosimi.\n\nI admit that I was a freedman; but now my shadow has been ennobled by my patron Cotta. Several times he was willing to grant me an equestrian fortune, he ordered me to let my children live so that he could provide for their upkeep. He was always ready to grant me his own wealth. He also gave my daughters the dowries a father provides. He promoted my son Cottanus to the rank of tribune in which he bravely served in Caesar’s army. What did Cotta not give us? Now, sadly, he provided these verses which can be read on my tomb.\n\nAurelia Saturnia, Zosimus’s [wife].\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcus Scribonius Libo Drusus\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nTacitus, Annales\n\nC.
