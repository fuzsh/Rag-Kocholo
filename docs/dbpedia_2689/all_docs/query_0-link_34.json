(See Metamorphoses IV:563)\n\nAthene (Minerva)\n\nThe patron goddess of Athens, born fully grown and armed from the head of Zeus. Associated with virginity, olive-cultivation, domestic arts (spinning, weaving, and pottery etc) wisdom, learning, technology and the mind.\n\nBook EIV.I:1-36 Her statues by Phidias on the Acropolis. The chryselephantine statue on the Parthenon, and the bronze Athena Promachos (‘The Champion’) presented to Athens by the allies after Marathon, which supposedly stood in the great square at Constantinople until 1203 when it was destroyed. Both were more than lifesize.\n\nAthens\n\nThe chief city of Attica in Greece, sacred to Minerva ( Pallas Athene).\n\nBook TI.II:75-110 Ovid visited the city, as a student, and parts of Asian Minor.\n\nBook TV.IV:1-50 The honey of Mount Hymettos in Attica, near Athens, was famous in ancient times, and sweeter than the honey of Taygetos near Sparta.\n\nBook EI.III:49-94 Diogenes the Cynic was exiled, and lived in Attica.\n\nBook EIV.I:1-36 The Athenian citadel the Acropolis, guarded by Athena.\n\nAthos\n\nA high promontory of the Macedonian Chalcidice, on a peninsula in the northern Aegean.\n\nBook EI.V:1-42 Ovid suggests he is being asked to perform the impossible, equivalent to Mount Athos appearing in the distant Alps.\n\nIbis:163-208 Snow covered in winter.\n\nAtia (Minor)\n\nAugustus’s maternal aunt, and the wife of Lucius Marcius Philippus.\n\nBook EI.II:101-150 Mother of Marcia, Maximus Paullus’s wife, to whom Ovid’s third wife was a companion.\n\nAtlantis\n\nAtlantian is an epithet for the Great Bear, since Callisto represented by the constellation was descended from Atlas.\n\nAtreus\n\nKing of Mycenae, the son of Pelops and Hippodameia, and brother of Thyestes. The father of Agamemnon and Menelaüs. His wife was Aerope.\n\nBook EI.II:101-150 An example of cruelty. The feud between the brothers over the kingship of Mycenae was long and complex, and gave rise to a network of myths. Thyestes committed adultery with Aerope, and Atreus in revenge killed Thyestes’ children, cooked the flesh, and served it to him at a banquet. Later Thyestes’ son Aegisthus killed Atreus, and subsequently Agamemnon.\n\nBook EI.VII:1-70 His sons Agamemnon and Menelaus.\n\nAtticus\n\nA friend to whom Ovid addresses two of the poems.\n\nBook EII.IV:1-34 Addressed to him explicitly.\n\nBook EII.VII:1-46 The second letter addressed explicitly to him.\n\nAttis\n\nIbis:413-464 A Phrygian shepherd, loved by Cybele. An incarnation of the vegetation god, the consort of the Great Goddess. He castrated himself and became a sexless follower of hers. See Catullus:63.\n\nAugustus\n\nThe Emperor Augustus Caesar (63BC –14AD). (The title was also granted to Tiberius). Augustus was Julius Caesar’s grand-nephew, whom Julius adopted and declared as his heir, Octavius Caesar (Octavian). (The honorary title Augustus was bestowed by the Senate 16th Jan 27BC). He married Scribonia and then Livia. He exiled Ovid to the Black Sea region in 8AD for ‘a poem and a mistake’ (carmen et error). The poem probably the Ars Amatoria, the mistake probably something to do with the notorious Julias’ set (the younger Julia, Augustus’s grandaughter, was banished as was the Elder Julia his daughter), that Ovid knew of and repeated. He may possibly have witnessed ‘an illegal’, that is politically unacceptable, marriage between Julia the Younger and her lover. (She subsequently had an illegitimate child while in exile).\n\nBook TI.I:1-68 Ovid hopes for greater leniency, despite the sparing of his life. A subtle doubtle-entendre as to which Caesar might grant it.\n\nBook TI.I:70-128 He fears further attention from Augustus. Once bitten, twice shy.\n\nBook TI.II:1-74 Augustus’s anger. Augustus did not judge Ovid’s fault (culpa) to be deserving of the death sentence.\n\nBook TI.IV:1-28 Book TIV.III:49-84 Augustus identified with Jupiter (Jove).\n\nBook TI.V:1-44 Book TI. IX:1-66 Augustus noted for his admiration of loyalty even amongst enemies.\n\nBook TII.I:1 His banning of Ars Amatoria (the text is uncertain here).\n\nPerhaps also a reference to Augustus’s re-dedication of the temple of Cybele (Ops) on the Palatine, after it burnt down in AD3. Augustus was granted the title pater patriae: Father of the Country on 2nd February 2BC.\n\nBook TII:361-420 Augustus attached a library to the temple of Apollo on the Palatine, and built one in the Portico of Octavia in memory of her son Marcellus.\n\nBook TII:421-470 Augustus’s accession was 26BC.\n\nBook TII:547-578 See the close of the Metamorphoses Book XV:745-870 where Ovid celebrates Julius Caesar and Augustus.\n\nBook TIII.I:1-46 The doorposts of his house on the Palatine were hung with wreaths of laurel and oak, triumphal insignia. The wreath of oak, the civic crown (civica corona) was awarded to Romans who saved others’ lives in battle, and Augustus was treated as the saviour of the country. The oak was sacred to Jupiter of Dodona, and Ovid continually identifies Augustus with Jupiter in the convential way.\n\nBook TIII.VI:1-38 ‘The man’ is Augustus.\n\nBook EI.I:1-36 Augustus was said to be (spuriously) descended from Aeneas.\n\nBook EI.I:37-80 Ovid celebrates the Julian succession, with its divine characteristics. The problem of Ovid’s past double-entendres in his works concerning Augustus is that one is inevitably tempted to read them into the later works too, but Ovid may in fact be ‘playing it straight’ here.\n\nBook EII.I:68 Book EIII.VI:1-60 Augustus’s Justice was personified as a goddess, Justitia Augusta and awarded a marble temple on the 8th January AD13.\n\nBook EII.II:39-74 Augustus is also Jupiter Capitolinus, the Tarpeian Thunderer.\n\nBook EII.II:39-74 Augustus was embarrassed by the fragility of the succession, and his own lack of direct heirs through Livia. Here the younger women of the house, and granddaughters include Livilla wife of Drusus the Younger: Agrippina the Elder wife of Germanicus: Antonia the widow of the Elder Drusus: and the Younger Julia.The great-grandsons\n\nare Germanicus’s three sons by Agrippina (Caligula, Drusus Caesar and Nero Caesar, the latter not the Emperor Nero.)\n\nBook EII.V:1-40 The pax Augusta, the tranquillity of the Empire within established borders.\n\nBook EII.VIII:1-36 Cotta Maximus sent Ovid portraits of Augustus, Tiberius and Livia. The Livia-Augustus relationship is mocked in The Metamorphoses by potraying them as Juno and Jupiter. Here Ovid lightly and ironically highlights the relationships, Tiberius being only his son by adoption, and Germanicus in turn an adopted son of Tiberius.\n\nBook EII.VIII:37-76 The implication is that gladiators were not allowed to fight to the death in Augustus’s presence. (Suetonius Divus Augustus:45)\n\nBook EIII.III:1-108 His (mythical) descent from Aeneas stressed.\n\nIbis:1-40 He allowed Ovid to retain his possessions.\n\nBook EIV.V:1-46 Book EIV.XV:1-42 The Forum of Augustus was north-east of the Capitol at the foot of the Quirinal Hill. Augustus dedicated it in May 2BC. The Julian Temple was the Curia Julia begun by Caesar in 45BC flanking the Forum Romanum and dedicated by Augustus in 29BC.\n\nBook EIV.VI:1-50 Book EIV.VIII:49-90 Book EIV.IX:89-134 Book EIV.XII:1-50 Book EIV.XIII:1-50 Augustus had died on 19th August AD14, and was deified on 17th September.\n\nBook EIV.IX:55-88 The consuls receive extra authority from the deified Augustus.\n\nAurelia\n\nBook EII.III:49-100 The wife of Marcus Valerius Corvinus Messalla.\n\nAurora\n\nThe goddess of the dawn (Greek Eos) the daughter of Hyperion, spouse of Tithonus, and mother of Memnon.\n\nBook EI.IV:1-58 The Dawn, mother of Memnon.\n\nAusonia\n\nA Greek name for the land of the Aurunci, later a poetic term for Latium and Italy.\n\nBook TI.II:75-110 Book TII.I:1 Book EIII.II:1-110\n\nBook EIV.XIV:1-62 Ovid’s Italy.\n\nBook TIV.X:41-92 The Italian lyre.\n\nBook TV.II:45-79 The Roman people.\n\nBook EI.II:53-100 The Roman military machine.\n\nBook EIV.VIII:49-90 Rome, the Ausonian city.\n\nAuster\n\nThe South Wind.

The son of Jupiter-Zeus and Semele. His worship was celebrated with orgiastic rites borrowed from Phrygia. His female followers are the Maenades. He carries the thyrsus, a wand tipped with a pine-cone, the Maenads and Satyrs following him carrying ivy-twined fir branches as thyrsi. (See Caravaggio’s painting – Bacchus – Uffizi, Florence) He was equated by the Romans with Liber the fertility god. See Euripides’ Bacchae. Also called Lenaeus, ‘of the winepress’.\n\nBook TI.VII:1-40 The ivy-crowned god.\n\nBook TI.X:1-50 Dionysopolis named for him.\n\nBook TII:361-420 Son of Semele.\n\nBook TIV.I:1-48 His thyrsus wand. A god of inspiration.\n\nBook TV.III:1-58 His feast of the Liberalia on March 17th is the occasion for this poem. He was born prematurely, and then a second time after being nourished sewn into Jupiter-Zeus’s thigh. The evergreen ivy was sacred to Bacchus-Dionysus. Ovid mentions elements of his myth, his mother Semele, the antipathetic Lycurgus and Pentheus punished for denying his worship, his rescue of Ariadne, and his identification with Liber.\n\nBook EII.V:41-76 The thyrsus as a symbol of inspiration from the god. Here apparently poetic inspiration.\n\nBook EII.IX:1-38 Book EIV.II:1-50 God of the grape, and the vine.

Originally it was open pasture outside the city boundary (pomerium) in the bend of the Tiber south of the Pincian Hill and east of the Janiculum, used for army musters and political assemblies. It took its name from the altar of Mars located there. It was encroached on by public buildings later including the Portico of Octavia and the Theatre of Pompey, but still retained its function as a park and exercise ground.\n\nBook TV.I:1-48 Book EI.VIII:1-70 An extensive grassy plain.

Possibly also a pseudonym for another of his friends.\n\nBook TI.V:1-44 Carus is possibly the addressee of this poem based on the carissime in line 3, and the statement of tokens instead of a name in line 7.\n\nBook TIII.IV:1-46 Again possibly addressed to Carus based on the care in line 1.\n\nBook TIII.V:1-56 A third poem addressed to Carus based on this strong hint. The point may well be that Carus, the true name, is itself merely a pseudonym, which is likely considering the caution Ovid displayed in dragging his friends into his misfortunes.\n\nBook TIII.VI:1-38 Carissime here refers as we shall see to an old friend not the recent friend of TIII.V, so clearly every reference of this kind is not to the same pseudonymous Carus. Possibly here the influential Cotta, close supporter of the Emperors, is meant.\n\nBook TV.IV:1-50 The use of carior and the remembrance of the tears shed over his disgrace is reminiscent of TIII.IV, see above, and suggests that TV:IV is addressed to the same friend.\n\nBook TV.VII:1-68 The use of carissime may again be significant, but note the comments above.\n\nBook EIV.XIII:1-50 Carus again addressed and his tutelage of Germanicus’s sons mentioned.\n\nBook EIV.XVI:1-52 A poet in Ovid’s list of his lesser contemporaries.\n\nCaspios Aegisos\n\nThe founder of Aegisos.\n\nCassandra\n\nThe daughter of Priam and Hecuba, gifted with prophecy by Apollo, but cursed to tell the truth and not be believed.

His erotic verse was addressed to Lesbia, probably Clodia Metella, the sister of Publius Clodius Pulcher, and wife of Quintus Metellus Celer. Catullus also wrote epithalamia, epigrams and at least one epyllion, the Marriage of Peleus and Thetis.\n\nBook TII:421-470 His erotic and explicit verse.\n\nCayster\n\nThe major river of Lydia in Asia Minor, with its mouth near Ephesus and its sources in the Tmolus mountains.\n\nBook TV.I:1-48 Noted for its swans, which Homer and many others mention (Iliad II:449). They were said (falsely) to sing their own death song. See Ovid’s Metamorphoses XIV:429.\n\nCelsus\n\nOne of Ovid’s closest friends. Possibly Albinovanus Celsus addressed by Horace (Epistle I.8) as Tiberius’s companion and secretary in 20BC and whom he accuses of plagiarism (Epistle I.13).\n\nBook EI.IX:1-56 Cotta writes to Ovid concerning Celsus’ death.\n\nCenchreae\n\nThe eastern port of Corinth on the Saronic Gulf, and the main Asian trade harbour.

He was served in the same way by Theseus, to Ceres great delight.\n\nCeres\n\nThe Corn Goddess. The daughter of Saturn and Rhea, and Jupiter’s sister. As Demeter she is represented in the sky by the constellation and zodiacal sign of Virgo, holding an ear of wheat, the star Spica. It contains the brightest quasar, 3C 273. (The constellation alternatively depicts Astraea.) The worship of her and her daughter Persephone, as the Mother and the Maiden, was central to the Eleusinian mysteries, where the ritual of the rebirth of the world from winter was enacted. Ceres was there a representation of the Great Goddess of Neolithic times, and her daughter her incarnation, in the underworld and on earth.

See Ovid’s Metamorphoses Book I.\n\nBook EIV.VIII:49-90 Known of through the poets.\n\nCharybdis\n\nThe whirlpool between Italy and Sicily in the Messenian straits. Charybdis was the voracious daughter of Mother Earth and Neptune, hurled into the sea, and thrice, daily, drawing in and spewing out a huge volume of water.\n\nSee Homer’s Odyssey Book XII.\n\nBook TV.II:45-79 Ovid calls the whirlpool Zanclean, from Zancle the ancient name for the city of Messina.\n\nBook EIV.X:1-34 Not as bad as the threat from Thracian tribes.\n\nBook EIV.XIV:1-62 Preferable to Pontus.\n\nIbis:365-412 Ulysses’ men caught in the whirlpool.\n\nChimaera\n\nA fire-breathing monster with a lion’s head, she-goat’s body and serpent’s tail.

Ovid calls the region of Tomis ‘Cimmerian’. Also a fabled people who were said to live in caves in perpetual darkness, ‘beyond the north Wind.’ See Ovid’s Metamorphoses Book XI:573-649 where their country is the home of Somnus, Sleep.\n\nCinna\n\nGaius Helvius Cinna, the neoteric poet and friend of Catullus and a student of Valerius Cato. His epyllion Zmyrna described the incest between Myrrha and her father Cinyras. He also wrote light verse. Mistaken for one of the conspirators, the praetor Lucius Cornelius Cinna, after Julius Caesar’s assassination, he was killed by the mob. See Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar.\n\nBook TII:421-470 His dubious light verse.\n\nCinyphus\n\nThe river Cinyps of North Africa flowing into the sea near the Syrtes.

(Kirke or Circe means a small falcon) She was famed for her beauty and magic arts and lived on the ‘island’ of Aeaea, which is the promontory of Circeii. (Cape Circeo between Anzio and Gaeta, on the west coast of Italy, now part of the magnificent Parco Nazionale del Circeo extending to Capo Portiere in the north, and providing a reminder of the ancient Pontine Marshes before they were drained: rich in wildfowl and varied tree species.) Cicero mentions that Circe was worshipped religiously by the colonists at Circei. (‘On the Nature of the Gods’, Bk III 47)\n\n(See John Melhuish Strudwick’s painting – Circe and Scylla – Walker Art Gallery, Sudley, Merseyside, England: See Dosso Dossi’s painting - Circe and her Lovers in a Landscape- National gallery of Art, Washington)\n\nShe transformed Ulysses’s men into beasts. Mercury gave him the plant moly to enable him to approach her. He married her and freed his men, staying for a year on her island. (Moly has been variously identified as ‘wild rue’, wild cyclamen, and a sort of garlic, allium moly. John Gerard’s Herbal of 1633 Ch.100 gives seven plants under this heading, of which the third, Moly Homericum, is he suggests the Moly of Theophrastus, Pliny and Homer – Odyssey XX – and he describes it as a wild garlic). Circe was the mother by Ulysses of Telegonus.\n\nBook TII:361-420 Driven by passion for Ulysses. (Odyssey X:133).\n\nBook EIII.1:105-166 Ibis:365-412 A witch able to transform men into beasts.\n\nCircus Maximus\n\nThe huge circus in Rome between the Palatine and Aventine Hills used for pageants races etc.\n\nBook TIV.IX:1-32 Ovid refers to a Circus, not necessarily this one, and describes the preparations for a bullfight.\n\nBook EI.IV:1-58 A horse-racing venue.\n\nCiziges\n\nA tribe living near the Danube.\n\nBook TII:155-206 A tribe of the Danube region.\n\nClaudia\n\nThe Roman woman, Claudia Quinta, a Vestal Virgin, who was accused of unchastity, but fulfilled the oracle and showed herself a pure woman by freeing the stranded ship containing the image of Cybele that had stuck on the mud when arriving at Ostia in 204BC.\n\nBook EI.II:101-150 She was superior to her reputation.\n\nClodia (Via)\n\nA major Road in Rome.\n\nBook EI.VIII:1-70 Mentioned.

Sister or half-sister of Helen, and of the Dioscuri. Mother of Orestes, Electra (Laodice), and Iphigenia. She conspired with her lover Aegisthus to murder Agamemnon. She was in turn killed by her son Orestes.\n\nBook TII:361-420 Tragedy caused by her adultery and the consequent events.\n\nBook EIII.1:105-166 Conspired to murder her husband.\n\nColchi\n\nA tribe living near the Danube.\n\nBook TII:155-206 A tribe of the Danube region.\n\nColchis\n\nThe region at the eastern end of the Black Sea, south of the Caucasus. Its King was Aeetes, and it was the home of Medea. Its main river the Phasis, was a trade route to central Asia. Medea is called ‘the Phasian’. Colchis was noted for timber, linen, hemp, pitch and gold-dust.\n\nBook TIII. IX:1-34 Home of Aeetes and Medea.\n\nBook EI.III:49-94 Its waters sailed by the Argonauts.\n\nCoralli\n\nA Moesian tribe living near the Danube.\n\nBook EIV.II:1-50 Book EIV.VIII:49-90 A blonde-haired tribe of the area.\n\nCorinna\n\nThe unknown heroine of Ovid’s Amores.\n\nBook TIV.X:41-92 Ovid claims here that Corinna was sung throughout\n\nthe City, and that he did not use her real name, suggesting that she was in fact a real and well-known person. The name Corinna refers back to the ancient Greece poetess (fourth century BC?) who claimed to have rivalled Pindar. This suggests a girl learned in verse. From this and a possible later identification of Julia the Younger and the Muse, I would suggest the speculation, without any evidence, that Corinna was Julia. I don’t suggest any direct affair between Ovid and Julia, merely that she was at least his literary pretext.\n\nCorinth\n\nThe city north of Mycenae, on the Isthmus between Attica and the Argolis. Built on the hill of Acrocorinth, it and Ithome were ‘the horns of the Greek bull’, whoever held them held the Peloponnese. It controlled both land and sea trade between Northern Greece and the Peloponnese and, by means of the famous slipway or diolkos, between the Saronic and Corinthian Gulfs. It sided with Sparta against Athens during the Peloponnesian War. It was destroyed by the Roman general Mummius in 146BC and rebuilt by Julius Caesar in 44BC as a Roman colony.\n\nBook TI.X:1-50 The harbour of Corinth on the Saronic Gulf was Cenchreae.\n\nBook TIII.VIII:1-42 Medea fled from there.\n\nCornificius\n\nA Roman erotic poet, possibly Quintus Cornificius friend of Catullus and Cicero, proscribed by the second Triumvirate, and killed defending his province of Africa Nova in 42BC.\n\nBook TII:421-470 His light verse.\n\nCoroebus\n\nIbis:541-596 He destroyed the Harpy, Poene, visited on Argos by Apollo after Crotopus’s crime of killing Linus and Psamathe. A plague then descended on the Argolis, which was ended by Corobeus confessing to his act at Delphi, and being sent out to build a temple to Apollo wherever the sacred tripod he was carrying fell to earth.\n\nCotta Maximus\n\nMarcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus (called Maximus or Cotta Maximus, and born not earlier than 24BC, possibly in 14BC) consul 20AD, the younger son of Messalla, brother of Messalinus, and patron and ‘friend’ of Ovid. A poet and orator, condemned by Tacitus (Annals:6.5-6.7) for his extravagant life-style, his shameful behaviour, and his servility, he was a supporter of Tiberius, and was successfully defended by him when prosecuted in 32AD, for accusing Gaius Caligula of homosexuality, ridiculing a banquet to the late Julia Augusta as a funeral feast, and boasting of Tiberius’s protection when he went to law. Pliny (Historia Naturalis:10.52) describes him as an extravagant gourmet. Juvenal (5.109, 7.94) makes him a patron of the arts. (Tacitus apart, he probably behaved no differently than any member of the Caesars’ inner group of supporters, and appears to have been a continuing supporter of Ovid. Those who think he didn’t do enough for the poet probably overestimate his power, and underestimate the distaste for Ovid’s error at court.)\n\nBook TIV.V:1-34 This poem probably addressed to Cotta, given its consistency with other poems to Cotta (Ex Ponto I:V,IX and II:III,VIII and III:II,V), the mention of the blood brother, and the content of the preceding poem, probably addressed to Messalinus.\n\nBook TV.IX:1-38 The imagery of shipwreck again and the perceived high rank of the recipient, who wishes to be strictly anonymous, suggests that as above this poem may be to Cotta.\n\nBook EI.V:1-42 Explicitly addressed to Cotta.\n\nBook EI.VII:1-70 Brother to Messalinus. Ovid stresses the relationship with him.\n\nBook EI.IX:1-56 Explicitly addressed to Cotta. He may have acted as a patron to Celsus in his literary efforts.\n\nBook EII.III:1-48 Explicitly addressed to Cotta. Ovid claims that Cotta accepted he had only made a mistake and not committed a crime.\n\nBook EII.VIII:1-36 Explicitly addressed to Cotta thanking him for sending likenesses of the Imperial family.\n\nBook EIII.II:1-110 Explicitly addressed to Cotta. Iphigenia in Tauris.\n\nBook EIII.V:1-58 Explicitly addressed to Cotta. Compliments on his eloquence.\n\nBook EIV.XVI:1-52 A poet and patron of poets in Ovid’s list of his lesser contemporaries.\n\nCotys\n\nSeveral so-named Kings of Thrace.

He was deposed and killed by his uncle in 19AD after Ovid’s death. (Rhoemetalces had been supported by Augustus, Marcus Lollius providing military help, and Rome later had helped drive the Sarmatians back across the Danube).\n\nBook EII.IX:1-38 This poem addressed to him explicitly.\n\nCroesus\n\nKing of Lydia (c560-546BC), famed for his wealth.

She was loved by Anapis and wedded him. She obstructed Dis in his abduction of Proserpine and Dis opened up a way to Tartarus from the depths of her pool.\n\nBook EII.X:1-52 Visited by Ovid and Macer.\n\nCyaneae Insulae, Symphlegades\n\nThe Greek Symplegades, the ‘clashing rocks’. Two rocky islands at the entrance to the Euxine Sea in the Bosporus channel, clashing rocks according to the fable, crushing what attempted to pass between them. The Argo had to avoid them. With Athena’s help the Argonauts passed through after which the rocks ceased to clash.\n\nBook TI.X:1-50 On the route of the Minerva.\n\nCybele, Rhea\n\nThe Phrygian great goddess, Magna Mater, the Great Mother, personifying the earth in its savage state, worshipped in caves and on mountaintops. Merged with Rhea, the mother of the gods. Her consort was Attis, slain by a wild boar like Adonis. His festival was celebrated by the followers of Cybele, the Galli, or Corybantes, who were noted for convulsive dances to the music of flutes, drums and cymbals, and self-mutilation in an orgiastic fury. Her worship was introduced at Rome in 204BC. She wore a many-turretted crown, and is often represented with many breasts.\n\nBook TII.I:1 Identified with Ops the Roman goddess of plenty.\n\nBook EI.I:37-80 Worshipped to the sound of flutes, pipes and horns.\n\nIbis:413-464 Worshipped with ecstatic self-mutilation.\n\nCychreus\n\nIbis:251-310 The first king of Salamis, in some versions of myth the grandfather of Telamon. He killed, bred, or was killed by a serpent in various mythological variants. He is said to have appeared to the Greek fleet at the Battle of Salamis as a snake.\n\nCyclades\n\nThe ‘Encircling Isles’ The chain of islands centred on Delos in the Aegean Sea, Naxos, Paros and Andros being the largest.\n\nBook TI.XI:1-44 Ovid passed them on his journey into exile.\n\nCyclopes\n\nA race of giants living on the coast of Sicily of whom Polyphemus, blinded by Ulysses, was one. They had a single eye in the centre of their foreheads.
