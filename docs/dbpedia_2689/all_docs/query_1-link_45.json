        "text": "Marcus Aurelius, Roman emperor in the years 161-180 CE, was one of the most eminent and best educated Roman emperors. Because of his unusual interest in philosophy, he was called a “philosopher on the throne”. Many of his thoughts have survived to our times, which we can find in his “Meditations”. One of the most beautiful is the following.\n\nAncient Romans, unlike modern Americans, did not think that citizenship automatically entitled them to possess sharp weapons. It was recognized that such freedom could lead to many dangers.\n\nGladiators were extremely popular and therefore popular with women. There was even a situation when sweat of Roman gladiators were mixed with dirt and olive oil scraped from the skin with a special tool strigil and then sold in vials as aphrodisiac.\n\nHibernia is the Latin name of Ireland (also known as Britannia Hibernia), given to it by the Romans. The Roman name was transformed into Hibernia because of its similarity to the word hibernus – “winter”.\n\nBrushing teeth in Roman times was an inseparable element of personal hygiene. However, modern people would not use the substances used by the Romans. They believed, for example, that hard ingredients allowed teeth to maintain strength – for this purpose, crushed bones and oyster shells from which the mixture was made.\n\nTrajan’s Column (COLVMNA·TRAIANI) is a monument to the victory of Emperor Trajan over the Dakis in the wars in 101-102 and 105-106 CE Financed from enormous spoils of war since the year 113 CE, it is now a landmark on the map capital of Rome.\n\nRoman plate showing the head of an African. The object is dated from 2nd – 3rd century CE and is made of ivory. The item is 2.8 cm high.\n\nRoman sculpture showing a Satyr and a nymph (headless). The object was found in Trastevere, around Piazza Mastai and the Basilica of San Crisogono. The property is located in the Centrale Montemartini museum in Rome.\n\nSuetonius mentions that one of the most powerful people in the ancient world – Octavian Augustus (63 BCE – 14 CE) did not impress with height and had crooked teeth. He was prone to hypochondria. He was afraid of the storm, avoided the sun and rarely bathed because he thought it was healthier. He also had a problem getting up in the morning."
