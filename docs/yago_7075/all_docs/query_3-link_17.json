        "text": "It's 10:30 AM on Monday August 18, 2003 and the Marriott Hotel in Fisherman's Wharf is bathed in a warm glow of sunny weather. Inside, guests are finishing up breakfast, checking out, or preparing to bask in the kitschy environs of San Francisco's most touristy neighborhood. Outside, on the Western section of the hotel, it's an entirely different scenario. That's where the Jeepers Creepers 2 tour bus is strategically parked. Taking up a good quarter of the block, the massive vehicle causes more than one passerby's head to turn in confused awe at the spectacle, which is emblazoned with images of terrified kids and the gangly, demonic Creeper.\n\nBack inside the hotel, on the fifth floor in an undisclosed suite, four of those \"terrified kids\" – in this case actors Kasan Butcher (who plays Kimball \"Big K\" Ward), Al Santos (Dante Belasco), Travis Schiffner (Izzy Bohen), and Lena Cardwell (Chelsea Farmer) – are seated around a large table happily scarfing down grilled chicken salads, fajitas, and an array of other brunch-styled items. It's rather apropos that these young actors, who spent the bulk of the shoot for JC2 in a school bus, have been crisscrossing the States to promote the film in what else, a bus.\n\nThe biggest difference between the sequel and the original is that this film is much more of an ensemble piece as well as a more of a restricted set oriented piece. The first film was ostensibly a road-cum-chase picture, yet this time around the bulk of the action takes place on a broken down school bus stranded on an ominously deserted backwoods road. In fact, one could easily argue that the traditional yellow school bus itself is one of the primary characters of the film.\n\nDespite having logged serious time on the school bus set and now being confined to the small spaces of a tour bus, the four actors are bouncy and energetic, often talking over one another in enthusiastic bursts, especially when hit with questions that ask how much time they logged on the bus during production. \"Good question,\" says Al between mouthfuls of food. \"I think out of the, what was it 3 months?\" begins Travis before Al finishes his sentence for him, \"Two to three months and it was 12 to 16 hours a day on the bus, five days a week.\" The rest of the group nods their heads in agreement and then Travis continues, \"A lot of time on the bus,\" he concedes. \"But it allowed us to get close. It was a good thing. It allowed us to build really good chemistry between everybody because we were on there so much, you know what I mean?\"\n\nGiven the amount of time they were required to film within the tight confines of the school bus, one can't help but wonder if anybody suffered from claustrophobia. \"Someone was,\" chimes in Al. \"Who was? Somebody was.\"\n\n\"Yeah, who was that?\" asks Lena.\n\n\"Was it Nicki [Lynn Aycox, who plays Minxie Hayes in the film]?\" asks Travis.\n\n\"It probably would have been Julie or somebody,\" offers Kasan.\n\n\"No, I think it was Julie,\" confirms Lena.\n\nOf course the most confusing thing about this thread of conversation is that there are only four women characters in the film and there is no \"Julie\" listed in the cast credits, causing me to believe that her scenes got cut. Ah, the mysteries of Hollywood.\n\nMissing actresses aside, were the cast members told that they would have to endure long hours of filming crammed into the sweltering interior of an ancient yellow school bus? \"Nope!\" shouts Lena.\n\n\"They didn't tell us anything,\" confirms Al.\n\n\"Yeah, they didn't want to scare us off,\" chuckles Travis.\n\n\"They auditioned 2000 kids,\" continues Al, who has, over the short course of the interview, has quickly asserted himself as the more talkative \"alpha\" male of the group. Granted, of the four assembled, he's the one with the most acting experience. \"Basically all of 'Young Hollywood' auditioned for this movie. Everyone I know, anyway. The auditioning processes went on for 6 months and then they narrowed it down to us, for which we were very grateful. Because, like I said, everybody in Hollywood auditioned for this.\"\n\nSpeaking of auditions, what was it that drew each of these young actors to the script?\n\n\"For me, the thought of doing a horror film...\" beings Lena, \"I know my family and we love horror films. My mother can watch like seven in a row, by herself, in a dark room, when no one's in the house. She freaks me out. And my brothers, they've always taken me to horror films, so it's part of our culture within the Cardwell family, to love horror films. So to get the chance to do one? Oh yeah, I would have done it for free!\"\n\n\"She's lying,\" jokes Kasan.\n\n\"I would have!\" she counters.\n\nWhile Cardwell is a huge horror fan, Al is not. \"I've never been a fan of horror movies. I've never like horror movies and I've never been scared from a horror movie,\" he admits. \"I saw Poltergeist and The Exorcist when I was six and I thought they were retarded and so irrational, so ridiculous, and so absurd. But I actually bought a copy of the first movie at Blockbuster for $9.99, watched it and I thought he [writer/director Victor Salva] did such a great job with it that I read the script for this one.\"\n\nWhile the bulk of the film takes place on the aforementioned bus, there's also a fair share of action that happens outside of the narrow mold of Detroit Steel. There are a few chase sequences that required some of the actors to sit behind the wheel of other vehicles. And since the film doesn't rely too heavily on CGI, a lot of these stunts were done the old fashioned way. There's one particular sequence that involves Travis' character Izzy having to drive a truck. He ends up smashing into a tree. \"We did all of our own stunts,\" says Travis. \"But the driving, in the beginning when I run to the truck and throw it into reverse, well it was supposed to go into reverse and back up. But it was an accident; I accidentally threw it into 'Drive' and smacked the tree. So that was like one of those pleasant surprise type things,\" he laughs. \"But after we finally pulled out and on to the road, there was actually a car that drives next to the car, so I wasn't actually driving the truck. So, other than that pulling in and out sequence – and I screwed that up – no, I didn't do much of the driving.\"\n\nWhile the young actors are candid about the stunts and \"happy accidents\" they participated in, when it comes to discussing who died and who survived, well they're all tightlipped. \"We're not allowed to talk about that,\" says Al with a sly grin. \"But I'll be honest with you, I haven't even seen the film. I've only seen about the first five minutes of the film. I wanted to wait until the premiere date, August 29, and go out with the rest of the world and be shocked and see how it turned out.\"\n\nDid any of them go into the audition really craving to land a part in which their character dies? I mean let's face it, there's the horror movie rite of passage that every young actor goes through. Once they've satisfied that, then there's the grisly death sequence rite of passage. \"I wanted to die,\" admits Lena rather straightforwardly. \"But I can't tell you if I did or didn't. I can neither confirm or deny.\"\n\n\"You obviously can't kill everybody,\" augments Travis. \"But, yeah, I think every actor would love to have a really grisly, gruesome death scene, you know what I mean? It's like your dream gig, 'Oh yeah, kill me by making my head explode!' You can't do it for everybody, but yeah, definitely.\"\n\nAs if on cue, the hotel's fire alarm is set off, the high-pitched glare cutting through the cast's laughter. I grab my tape recorder as the rest of the folks in the room jump up from the table. \"We need to get the f@#k out of here,\" Travis says calmly. Just then the alarm stops. \"He [pointing at me] grabbed all of his equipment,\" laughs Lena. \"I was thinking about my clothes,\" confesses Al. \"All my clothes are upstairs. I was going to get them.\" In fact the safety of clothes is on more than Al's mind. \"That's what I was thinking, too!\" adds Lena. As we all began to laugh at the situation, the alarm went off again. This time everybody moved toward the door, until it ceased again. \"Can I go pack my bags just in case?\" asks Lena. \"Your bags should already be packed,\" says the formerly silent Kasan matter-of-factly. After a few phone calls to the concierge, it's revealed as a glitch/malfunction with the alarm and nothing to be worried about.\n\nWith the piercing siren interruption behind us, the conversation turns to what it's like to star in the sequel to a successful sleeper hit as well as being a part of what could easily become a franchise film series. \"I'll tell you what, Victor actually didn't even want to do the second one,\" explains Al. \"And he damn sure doesn't want to do a third one,\" adds Kasan. \"He didn't want to fall into that franchise [trap], as you put it,\" continues Al. \"He didn't want it to be like Jason 3784. He wanted to do one and they toyed with two and they even toyed with three. But I think it came down to more of like some ideas were bumped around and they saw the potential behind it and they went ahead and they did it. And there were some storylines thrown around for Jeepers Creepers 3, which I thought were better than 1 and 2.\"\n\n\"I usually think that after you finish a movie everyone says 'We're not going to do another one.\" But after time passes and you see the reaction [to the first film], you start hankering for that again,\" hypothesizes Lena. \"There very well might be a third one.\"\n\n\"You know, when you're broke...\" laughs Travis. \"Never say never, right?\"\n\nWhile the fate of a third Creeper film will undoubtedly lie in the public's acceptance of this sequel, one thing is for certain: there will be some serious bonus goodies on the inevitable Jeepers Creepers 2 DVD. \"The movie was about 40 minutes over, so they pulled a lot of dialogue and a lot of scenes are cut,\" reveals Al. \"On the DVD the movie is pieced together as a whole and there's actually one scene that goes back and it kind of shows more of the origins of The Creeper. And that's where the third storyline comes into play. You can go so far with that, it's so amazing. But you'll have to get the DVD to see that.\""
