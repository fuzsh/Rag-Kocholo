        "text": "After years spent in quite appalling death throes, the horror movie is back. The past few months have seen four of its number (Jeepers Creepers 2, Freddy Vs Jason, Underworld and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre at or near the top slot in the US.\n\nAnd the genre's current renaissance is more than just quantitative. Recent films such as My Little Eye, 28 Days Later and Blade II not only did brisk business, they also stretched the slasher, zombie and vampire flick in inspired new directions, impressing critics as much as the public. This is no mean feat for a genre whose practitioners have often, to quote the once-great director John Carpenter, been looked at \"like we are pornographers\".\n\nThe last golden age of the horror movie ran from the late 1960s to the early '80s. It was then that it finally reached maturity, mutating into two infinitely flexible and overlapping sub-genres: the supernatural (George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, 1968; William Friedkin's The Exorcist, 1973; Brian De Palma's 1976 Sissy Spacek shocker Carrie) and the yet more controversial phenomenon of the slasher.\n\nBack in 1960, Hitchcock's Psycho had laid many of the slasher ground rules, which offer a field day for disciples of Freud: the killer should be a sexual mess, the weapon pre-technological and tactile, the victim usually a frisky young woman, and so on.\n\nSuch powerful and original pictures as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Tobe Hooper, 1974) and Halloween (Carpenter, 1978) cemented the slasher conventions, inadvertently spawning endless inferior tales of masked killers with sharp instruments stalking gormless teenagers.\n\nTherein lay the problem. The 1980s began promisingly for the horror movie - with 1980 yielding Carpenter's The Fog, Kubrick's The Shining and Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th - yet, by the close of the decade, the genre was in dismal decline.\n\n\"The slasher films of that period killed it,\" says Eli Roth, who directed Cabin Fever. \"They were made from the starting question, 'What weapon can we kill the kids with this time?' Nobody was thinking, what's scary about the idea itself?\"\n\nSo, despite the odd distinguished blip (the original Dutch version of The Vanishing in 1988, The Silence of the Lambs in 1991), by the mid-1990s the horror movie was displaying all the vitality of a sun-dried vampire, with Halloween on its fifth sequel, A Nightmare on Elm Street on its sixth and Friday the 13th on its eighth.\n\nBut then, in 1996, came a film that seemed to give the genre the kiss of life while simultaneously knifing it through the heart. Written by Kevin Williamson and directed by veteran horrormeister Wes Craven, Scream laid bare the slasher movie conventions while also slickly exploiting them. You found yourself watching it through parted fingers and you couldn't imagine non-ironic horror working ever again.\n\nThen along came Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez's The Blair Witch Project and M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (both 1999), which rekindled audiences' desire for \"straight\" horror and made the knowing postmodernism of the Scream series look paradoxically old hat.\n\nTogether, these helped lead to the present climate, with cinemagoers baying for old-fashioned scares and directors often delivering them with considerable flair.\n\nThe 1970s horror boom can be seen as America's unwitting response to a presidential scandal, a lost war, a fuel crisis, spiralling inflation and the constant spectre of nuclear annihilation. Many have also seen the 1970s slasher film as a male retaliation against the then-burgeoning feminist movement, but this reading of the genre doesn't stand up in the face of the fact that the survivor in such films is nearly always a resourceful woman.\n\nAs Carol Clover points out, in an essay from 1987, \"policemen, fathers, and sheriffs appear only long enough to demonstrate risible incomprehension and incompetence\".\n\nIt is similarly tempting to attribute the West's current appetite for horror to September 11, 2001 and its lingering consequences.\n\n\"I think global unease will always fuel our need to be scared in a safe environment like a movie theatre,\" says Victor Salva, director of Jeepers Creepers and its sequel.\n\n\"No matter how bad things are,\" agrees Cabin Fever's Eli Roth, with unimpeachable logic, \"at least we're not getting hacked up by a chainsaw.\"\n\nRoth also points out that the modern horror film has had to redefine and even rename itself. \"People are tired of the same old crap,\" he says. \"And horror films had become so bad over the past 20 years that filmmakers who now make brilliant ones can't call them horror films. For example, Fox won't let [director] Danny Boyle call 28 Days Later a horror film, but that's what it is, one of several examples of how far the art form has developed.\"\n\nMany horror movies of the past were vivid dramatisations of such weighty topics as nuclear testing (Inoshiro Honda's 1956 Godzilla), McCarthyist paranoia (Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers, 1956), America's blood-soaked history (The Shining) and the misery of cancer (David Cronenberg's The Fly, 1986).\n\nApart from 28 Days Later, which could be seen as a grotesque metaphor for British parochialism, the horror film as serious allegory seems pretty much dead and buried.\n\n\"I think, sadly, that movies in general have largely given up on allegory,\" says Salva. \"The serious exploration of the world and people around us should be the first contribution of all art. But I think all these things have been abandoned in the pursuit of commerce.\""
