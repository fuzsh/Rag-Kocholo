        "text": "When Jeepers Creepers hit theaters in 2001, it was a minor hit at the box office and won acclaim for doing something different with the chronically formulaic horror genre. It was, no pun intended, creepy, less focused on body count and more driven by fright.\n\nWriter/director Victor Salva created a unique beast that fed for 23 days every 23 years, so he figured this would help him avoid sequelitis. Well, now, if they could kill Ripley and bring her back for Alien Resurrection, then you know his solution will be easily to get around.\n\nThe solution was simple. The first movie never made it clear what day it was during the 23-day feeding cycle. Could have been day one, for all we knew. A bit of a monkey wrench was thrown when Gina Philips, who starred in the first film and was quite a revelation for her fearless performance, declined to do the sequel. Again, no problem. Just create a new batch of victims. This time, it was a basketball team.\n\nThe Movie\n\nSalva should have taken his own advice and not done a sequel. What was a unique, scary film has become a generic teen chop-em-up. Gone is the feisty Patricia Jenner, who fearlessly stood up to the monster that was hell-bent to make a meal of her brother. In her place is Taggart (Ray Wise), the morose father of a young victim of the Creeper, who doesn't enter the scene until almost the end.\n\nIt's the last day of the Creeper's 23-day feast, and it's about to gorge itself on a school bus full of teenagers just back from winning a state basketball championship. However, all is not harmonious. We've got a homophobe and a racist among the batch, trouble between black and white players and tension between one player and his girlfriend.\n\nIt starts to boil over when their bus blows a tire on a country road so completely empty of traffic you'd think it was in Kansas somewhere. However, the first one was set in central Florida and there is a reference to a building from the first movie, so you have to figure this is also set in the Sunshine State. The blown tire was hit with a shuriken-like weapon made of human bone, much to the shock of the driver and coaches.\n\nThey soldier on until another tire is blown, stranding the team in the night. At that point, it becomes feeding time, with the Creeper picking off his meals like he was at the buffet at the Bellagio Hotel.\n\nPart of what made the first Jeepers Creepers movie work was the chase. You pretty much lose that with all of the kids stuck inside the bus. The Creeper makes his ugly face highly visible, a classic problem with horror sequels. You never see them in the first movie, after that, they are everywhere. He picks his victims out like dim sum and slowly picks them off.\n\nAdding a peculiar element is cheerleader Minxie (Nicki Lynn Aycox), who goes into trances where she learns everything about the Creeper. There's a cameo by Justin Long, the hapless victim from the first movie, in her dream sequence.\n\nThe characters are paper thin, as is the dialogue. None of them are particularly likeable, so when they die off, I didn't really care. In the first one, you had the Creeper determined to get at Darry and Gina determined to fight him off. Here, the kids practically feed each other to the Creeper. By the end, the fates of several kids are unaccounted for.\n\nSalva also seems to have let his bad habits out with this film. Every time he releases a film, the self-appointed moral guardians make a stink over his 1988 conviction for child molestation. My thought on the matter is he did his time and hasn't misbehaved since. So I'm willing to give him a second chance.\n\nBut I tell you, he pushed his luck with this one. These boys can't seem to keep their shirts on and the camera likes to hold on them. And whoever heard of five guys standing in a line in the middle of a field to take a leak?\n\nThat's a minor thing, really, just an observation. My main objection is that this unusual if not revolutionary film has been reduced to standard horror fare.\n\nScore: 5 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nJeepers Creepers 2 is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen video and looks very, very nice. Because much of the film takes place at night, and in the dark, edge enhancement is not noticeable, although it is there.\n\nBlack levels are excellent, rock solid and free of grain. The nighttime scenes are extremely well-shot, so there is no murkiness that often plagues these scenes. Everyone and everything can be made out cleanly, including the Creeper. Some of the distance shots are fuzzy, but that's because of the heavy use of forced perspective. It was shot on a sound stage but made to look like the outdoors.\n\nThe print is free of any dust or scratches, there are no visible compression problems or noise. All in all, an above-average effort, but short of outstanding.\n\nScore: 8 out of 10\n\nLanguages and Audio\n\nThe movie is available in English Dolby Digital 5.1 plus French and Spanish Dolby Digital 2.0 and English, French and Spanish subtitles.\n\nThe soundtrack was a bit of a letdown. The whole thing is front-loaded, and if ever there was a genre that demanded use of the surround track, it's horror. But that wasn't the case here. When the Creeper chases Taggart's kid through the cornfield, it's all from the front. When the Creeper is crawling around on the roof of the bus, it's all from the front. When he flies and flaps around, it's all from the front with no positional audio. I wanted to hear whooshing from speaker to speaker and didn't get it.\n\nThe mix is very good, with voices clean and clear and the sound effects and very nice score all ringing through cleanly. The soundtrack, which is quite powerful, never overpowers the dialogue.\n\nScore: 7 out of 10\n\nPackaging and Extras\n\nJeepers Creepers 2 comes in an Amaray case with an insert listing the cast and chapters. It has animated menus with some rather goofy menulistings like \"Body Parts\" and \"Appetizers.\"\n\nWe start off with two commentary tracks, the first featuring Salva and his young cast. He calls them out individually to ask their memories on particular scenes. The presence of an adult helps hold it together. Without him, it could have degenerated into madness like the Holes commentary track, but he keeps good order and there's a lot of joking and reminiscing from this cast of largely unknowns.\n\nThe second features Jonathan Breck (the Creeper), storyboard artist Brad Parker and makeup artist Brian Penikas. They are a lot calmer than the kids but still lend a lot of insight on the making of the film, some of the tricks used to get certain shots and how they were able to do things in live action, as opposed to CG.\n\nThen we get into the documentaries.Lights, Action, Creeper: The Making of Jeepers Creepers 2 is a 40-minute series broken down into four segments: \"Lights, Camera, Creeper,\" \"Creeper Creation,\" \"Creeper Composer\" and \"Digital Effects.\" Salva takes you through the whole thing, from the original concept for the sequel, which would involve Gina Philips with the bus of basketball players as a side plot.\n\n\"Creeper Creation\" looks at designing the monster and make-up, not to mention all the green screen shooting. \"Creeper Composer\" profiles composer Bennett Salvay and \"Digital Effects\" is just what the title implies, only there's no Salva or anyone else to guide us, it's just before, during and after shots of the effects to the movie soundtrack.\n\nThe 26-minute featurette A Day in Hell is focused on one particular day of shooting and how much has to be done. One lighting change can mean an hour lost. It shows the work, the detail and the boredom involved in shooting a movie.\n\nThe Deleted Scenes and Moments montage runs 19 minutes, and all of the shots are widescreen and anamorphic, but they just run together with nothing separating them, not even a momentary pause, and no explanation as to what the scene was about or why it was cut.\n\nThe Creeper's Lair is storyboard illustrations of a deleted sequence, as is Ventriloquist Creeper, which was pulled because they didn't want the Creeper to talk. Finally, there are still galleries and the film's theatrical trailer. There are no DVD-ROM features.\n\nScore: 9 out of 10"
