        "text": "Jeepers Creepers is a 2001 American horror film written and directed by Victor Salva.\n\nOne of the few masterpieces of the genre as I see it.... which I'm pretty certain I should clarify. I don't like horror per se' and I just don't understand the thought process behind the \"horror porn\" fest that was Hostel or the film about the kids in the cabin who died (one by peeling her own skin off in the bath shaving her legs) in a variety of gore, blood & guts inducing ways. I thought everything after #1 Saw was exploitation schlock and really don't want to even hear about Friday the 13th anymore.\n\nGive me: The House on Haunted Hill (preferably the original thanks)\n\nThe Birds (or any number of Hitchcock's films)\n\nPenny Dreadful (season 1 and/or 2 only)\n\nRebecca\n\nEvent Horizon\n\nOr any number of \"Horror\" films that don't need to show someone being flayed alive (in it's entirety) to be thrilling, scary as hell and still (after all these years) keep me hiding behind my fingers or peeking out from behind a pillow. For movies like these, the value is not in: how many gallons of fake blood was used or was there enough projectile vomiting? They are content to show you just enough of what's happening that your imagination takes you all the way home (therein lying the suspense and genuine fear) and build-up slowly to those moments by telling a finely crafted story that sucks you inside of it. The characters matter, you want them to make it, you're genuinely afraid for them and want to get them out of there yourself right now!!!!!\n\nVictor Salvo took an idea and with about $100,000.00 turned it into a 4* \"little engine that could\". From the first moment we see that truck go roaring by with BEEATINGYOU on the license plate, to Eileen Brennan with her cats and her shotgun it was both captivating and compelling. \"The Monster\" was a miracle of fear inducing hysteria and between his hat and the Duster he wore you never really got that good a look at him, until the moment on the road just before Trish ran him over and then back again! And he, Salvo, did it with almost no money at all. I saw a version that had some of his commentary on it and he said he had to make certain shots, in the Police station for instance, the way that he did because \"there was actually no wall there\"! They didn't have the money to make a fully built building so he worked around the missing walls. So it was pretty ironic that some of the scariest moments are the ones between Trish, Derry and the Monster when she's fighting for a trade with all she's got and the reason we're only looking at the moon outside the window is because there isn't any south wall to pan over to!\n\nAnd I liked the sequel just as much! I liked that it was once again pretty much about a group of kids pitted against this monster (even given that they're in HS and there's almost 30 of them) and that Derry, poor god-awful, tragic Derry had a small part of his own to play in this movie as well. I thought \"the count off\" inside the bus was genius as well as watching which of those kids was going to end up falling like a house of cards while the others rose to the occasion.\n\nI've been waiting forever for Trish to finally return and go get her justice the hard way and I'm about as excited as a person can be bout a movie that probably won't get any advanced press, or a \"Box Office Opening Big Week-end\" because I'm fine with all of that crap being absent anyway. I'm just happy that this little movie that I couldn't watch after dark for years is finally getting it's close. Most likely once again with no or a \"Low Budget\" (a great Kinks song by the way) and most likely once again underrated and poo-pooed by the general public. For me, Victor Salvo will always be the magic man who proved that it's not the budget, it's the guy who's making the film!\n\nAnd for VS's fabulous achievement:\n\nWhoopie! it's party time for us weirdo \"Suspense/Horror Goons whom no one else will ever be able to understand!!!!!!\n\nIt is something I struggle with, as far as one should be able to separate the two\n\nI have no question at all about it in this case. The man is an artist who used his medium to create something hurtful, painful and illegal on top of it all. He abused a child that he obtained access to on his set and then filmed what he did to that child (again by misusing his own medium to create \"works of art\") thereby creating a permanent record of one of the most damaging experiences a child can go through. He is a sick and dangerous monster who should never have access to either film or children again.\n\nIn this case, for me at least, there is no gray area and there will never be anything he creates that I personally will watch. If for no other reason than because he crossed a line that, again, is something I view without questions of any kind insofar as this incident is concerned.\n\nI agree that I won't say anything about anyone else's choices regarding their personal responses. But to me he is a monster and a criminal and if someone wants to help me build a Wooden Man in his image you can bet I will bloody well light the match and watch it go up in flames. Hell, I'd go so far as to take everything he's ever filmed (every canister, master copy, DVD video, VHS, 8mm and whatever other form it may be in) pile it up on his front lawn and burn them all down to ash.... or take a pound of C-4 and blow a hole so big the Earth underneath it would be blown into dust right along with the rest of it, just to keep anyone from being to watch any of it ever again!\n\nThis is not a question for me. This is not something I'm \"on the fence\" in regard to. He should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, labeled a child molester, serve his time and if he comes out of prison alive, should be required to register in every neighborhood he ever lives in so people will be warned they have a predator in their midst. It is no wonder to me that his \"Jeepers Creepers\" monster is so terrifying.... it's because that is what he looks like on the inside!\n\nSo thanks for the update guys. If I sound like a Norwegian woman gone mad it's because that's what situations like this do to me. I worked in the teaching profession for years and spent 2 of them working with a little girl whose father had been molesting her since she was four. Because she had to wait until she was older to be a \"credible witness\" on the stand, she didn't get to court until she was in 5th grade and by that time the emotional and psychological damage that had been done to her was virtually ingrained in her psyche. I'm not sure how or if she will ever recover. I just know that she struggled every day in class trying to get along with her fellow students and trying to behave \"normally\" in a world that would probably never be normal for her ever again. She and I worked out a couple of strategies that helped take the pressure off in the classroom and I think we had some small successes because when she saw me again, years later, in middle school she launched herself across the office like a rocket to throw herself into my arms like I was the only safe harbor in the room. When I look back on it, she was one of my greatest loves and working with her cemented in me the fact that I was needed in the classroom and that my view on teaching being a \"calling\" for me was more true than almost any other \"truth\" I have know in my life. But for what happened to her and for what happens to every child who is molested, I will never back down or question my stance for as long as I live. I've seen the aftermath, lived with the consequences and find there is no penalty too strong or too severe to make up for what these kids have suffered through.\n\nSo no more VS for me.... ever. Close the book. Notarize the contract and file it under \"done\".\n\nAnd for every child who has been hurt like this..... and a line of puppies and kitties to hug and play with when it gets dark & hard..... and also, \"teddy bears with attitude\" to protect them from the monsters......"
