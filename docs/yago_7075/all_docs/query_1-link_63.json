        "text": "Uncanny Movies: Shades of scary!\n\nby Suzette Chan\n\nWhat makes a movie scary? Creepy crawly things, blood and guts, appearances by Christopher Walken, sure.\n\nBut what about movies that don't feature those elements? What about a movie like Stephen Frears' Dirty Pretty Things? It's got body parts  or more precisely, talk about body parts  but that wasn't what left me uneasy.\n\nAnd what about horror movies that go away from the formula, as Jeepers Creepers 2 does, by giving us a monster whose killing hierarchy that has nothing to do with Sunday school morality? And what if the monster isn't the scariest thing about the movie?\n\nIn 1919, Sigmund Freud identified \"a particular shade of what is frightening\" as \"the uncanny.\" He described the uncanny as an effect comprised of two basic phenomena, the first being something repressed that recurs in another form. This effect hinges on the sublimation of a specific fear into another form. For example, over the years, the fears of death and dissolution of the body and sexuality have been displaced into that most convenient of horror icons, the vampire.\n\nFreud's second type of uncanny arises from something old and familiar that becomes alienated through continued repression. In this case, fears are externalized into an agent that is foreign or alien. Enemy space aliens in countless science fiction movies are the prototypical \"other,\" from The Day the Earth Stood Still to Independence Day.\n\nFreud also cited a definition of the uncanny by psychiatrist Ernst Jentsch, whose 1906 essay \"The Psychology of the Uncanny\" elicited Freud's responding paper. Jentsch wrote about uncanny effects in terms of a feeling of intellectual uncertainty as to whether something was dead or alive. In other words, tension is torqued up when a you can't tell if an entity is animate or not, or if it's sentient or not. The difference is crucial: alive/not alive determines whether an entity is us or them, native or alien.\n\nDirty Pretty Things: Something old and familiar that becomes alienated\n\nDirty Pretty Things, directed by Stephen Frears, looks to be the third picture in a triptych on the displaced in England (My Beautiful Launderette and Sammy and Rosie Get Laid being the other pictures).\n\nBut very early on, an element of horror injects itself into this seemingly straightforward \"social commentary\" film: Okwe, an illegal immigrant working as a hotel night desk clerk, discovers that a toilet in one of the guest rooms is blocked by a severed human heart.\n\nIt turns out that the hotel is the site of an enterprising black market trade in human organs. The sellers are desperate migrants  some legal, many not, some awaiting refugee status, most prohibited by law from working. The buyers, we are led to believe, are the unscrupulously wealthy denizens of the nation.\n\nOkwe wants his boss to call the police, but his boss doesn't want that kind of attention at the hotel: bad for business. Okwe can't call the cops himself; they would surely deport him. This is the first of Okwe's dilemmas, dilemmas that are, literally, foreign to the citizens he serves. Okwe, who also drives a gypsy cab, is the alien among us  except that the film is firmly rooted in the perspective of Okwe and his friends. We in the audience are not merely observing events happening to the characters, we are invited to relate to the events from the characters' perspective. In this way, we are alienated from our usual perspective as consumers of hotels and hospitals; we're taken to the off-hours, off-places and off-the-record zones of London.\n\nOkwe's friends represent different aspects of the service underclass that keeps the city running. He secretly shares a flat with a Turkish migrant (she gets the flat at night, he gets it for a few hours between his cab and hotel shifts during the day) who works illegally as a chambermaid at the hotel. He also becomes the reluctant friend of a brash, black prostitute who works out of the hotel. She's a native of London, but because of her profession, is also denied by mainstream society. As Okwe tells a crisp, business-like British buyer of black market organs: \"We are the invisible people. We drive your cabs, we clean your rooms, we suck your dicks.\"\n\nWhile the events of the movie surround the sometimes dangerous and demeaning lives of Okwe and his friends, Dirty Pretty Things is also about a society that is in denial of all its functions. Western economies have long repressed acknowledgement of their reliance on illegal labour to supply their desires. In the case of Britain, colonization has been relocated from \"over there\" to right here. Whereas Britain exploited its subjects in their native lands in the past (from the West Indies to British North America and the Thirteen Colonies to India to West Africa to East Asia), it now relies on migrant workers of varying degrees of legality to come to Britain to do the dirty work.\n\nThe only Anglo-Saxon British characters of any note in the film are a pair of vindictive immigration officials. They are the faces of homeland authority whose main role is to push the migrants further underground. They pay a menacing visit to Senay, Okwe's Turkish friend, on the strength of a tip that she might be harbouring an illegal; eventually, she gives up her flat. The authorities figure out she's been working at the hotel, so she stops reporting to work and and ends up in a sweatshop run by a sexually exploitative legal immigrant. Senay is forced to run from that situation as well. As the film progresses, we see Senay being pressed deeper and deeper underground, until she is desperate enough to consider an offer to buy one of her kidneys. It would be her pound of flesh.\n\nThe dependency on one set of humans to sacrifice dignities for the comfort of another is the thing that is old and familiar which has become alienated after years repression. This is the post-colonial age of Britain, in which exploitation of the \"other\" is brought to the homeland, yet kept out of sight.\n\nJeepers Creepers 2: Something repressed recurs in another form\n\nWhile Dirty Pretty Things is an uncanny movie with horrific elements, Jeepers Creepers 2 is a horror movie that's most scary when you examine its uncanny effects.\n\nDirector Victor Salva takes us to an almost mythical rural American Midwest, resplendent with fecund golden cornfields and endless blue sky. But a sense of dread hangs over the fields and stretches of highway. People have disappeared here. They might have run away or got lost, they might have been kidnapped or killed. But their names, the particulars of their lives and theories of what might have happened to them have been forgotten.\n\nAll the better for the monster that stalks this country. Every 23 years for 23 days, he emerges to isolate, terrorize and feed on humans and their fear. He consumes people and uses their remains  bones, skin, teeth  to make a macabre panoply of weapons that he deploys to trap more humans. Even scarier, he has the ability to graft body parts to himself by subsuming the victims: the monster is literally made up of the people he terrorizes.\n\nThis cycle of terror is underlined by the monster's ability to create the conditions of fear. People disappear during the monster's feeding frenzies. Faded generational memories omit the particulars, leaving only a vague feeling of dread in isolated parts of the country. A school bus, containing a champion high school football team, its coaches, cheerleaders and a sports writer, gets stranded on a cursed stretch of road. The road is scary because of what has preceded, but the kids weren't born yet: the cultural memory of previous disappearances has blurred over the span of a generation.\n\nThe monster methodically isolates the bus, killing any passing motorists who might be able to get help, and leaving their destroyed vehicles cryptically empty. After night falls, the monster literally swoops in and removes the adult coaches and driver from the scene. He then traps his prey on the bus and, as if leering into the lobster tank in a seafood restaurant, begins to select the ones he wants to eat. The selection process is unmistakably sexual. The monster, who never utters a sound, goads the kids into presenting themselves. He shakes his head at the ones that don't interest him, and winks at the ones he wants.\n\nHe chooses four boys: the star All-American, WASP quarterback; the African-American back-up quarterback with a chip on his shoulder; the cockiest, best-looking kid on the team; and the geeky team manager. What they have in common are confidence, imagination, skill, strength, and a bit of the outsider or maverick in them: they are the generation's Young Turks. And like an all-consuming corporate master, the monster in Jeepers Creepers 2 picks them off, co-opts their strength and sucks the life out of them. As he does so, the others are left to decide whether to sell out their cohorts or stay together in the face of almost certain doom.\n\nWhile there is an overt sexuality to the monster's motives, he does not choose the closeted gay sports reporter. Eric, the star quarterback, had accused the writer of being \"the biggest threat to every swinging dick on this bus.\" Eric was wrong. The monster, an aggregate of people's fear, is the biggest threat, and the monster chooses Eric with a lascivious lick on the bus window. To recall Freud's comment about the uncanny: what is repressed recurs in another form.\n\nLater, the teens manage to impale the monster's head through a rent in the bus. The monster's answer to this injury is to rip off his own head. Falling apparently lifeless on the roof of the bus, his wing droops down and captures one of the teens. The monster then consumes (through an unseen orifice) the head of the prettiest looking boy. He regurgitates it up through his body cavity, reaches inside himself and pulls the boy's head up to replace his old head. Their fallen teammate is has been co-opted; the boy's eyes now belong to the monster. The teens' disgust is magnified by the horrible intellectual uncertainty they have over the nature of the monster and the fate of their friend. With the realization that the monster is physically made up of the bodies of his victims, he can no longer be considered entirely alien, and their friend is no longer one of them.\n\nIn his silence, precision and sheer relentlessness, the monster in Jeepers Creepers 2 is a kind of organic cyborg, an auto-Frankenstein's monster, putting himself together in man's image using men's parts as he goes along. He is sophisticated, unspeakably old, human-seeming, but not seemingly human at all. His ability to \"pass\" for human perverts the notion that Jesus was a God who \"passed\" for man. The point is underlined at the beginning of the movie, when the monster poses as a scarecrow, a crucified straw man (a rich visual joke), and at the end of the movie, when we see that his captors have crucified his body to the wall of a barn with his arms splayed to reveal wings, in a crude parody of an angel.\n\nJeepers Creepers 2, like Dirty Pretty Things, is about repressing the alien(s) among us. In Dirty Pretty Things, colonization has been relocated from foreign countries to the homeland, though official Britania does not acknowledge it. In Jeepers Creepers 2, repressed fears create an unfamiliar monster that doubles back to victimize the fearful.\n\nBoth films offer original spins on the cinematic trope of the convergence of the corporate machine, the cyborg, the alien and the \"other.\" Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times, for example, is an early criticism of the increasing tendency of America to fold human relations and history into an all-encompassing machine metaphor. While Chaplin used humour to get his point across, dead-serious movies have also contributed to the discourse. But that's a column for next time. Ridley Scott's Alien is being released in a new version this Halloween; I'll take a retrospective look at the Alien/s series in the November issue of Sequential Tart."
