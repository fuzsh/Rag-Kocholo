        "text": "PRINTER FRIENDLY VIEW\n\n(inverts site colors)\n\nBuy it... if you've never been able to find the original, out-of-print album for Jeepers Creepers and want something similar, but expanded in scope and depth.\n\nAvoid it... if you have little patience for a stereotypical horror score with dissonant orchestral blasts galore.\n\nEDITORIAL REVIEW\n\nFILMTRACKS TRAFFIC RANK: #857 WRITTEN 9/10/03, REVISED 3/9/09\n\nJeepers Creepers 2: (Bennett Salvay) In the genre of cheap, teenage slasher flicks with limited intelligence and an abundance of fallacies of logic, this series at least sports a premise that is a little more unusual than those of its competitors. The first Jeepers Creepers film accumulated a cult audience in 2001, raising the idea that a flying, flesh-eating \"Creeper\" monster arises in a pastoral setting once every 23 years to kill and maim as part of his senselessly voracious feast. Despite continuously poor critical results (and even a backlash against the series from devoted slasher genre fans), the same production team resurrected the creature in 2003 and set its story just a few days after the previous one, with the target now being a stranded group of varsity basketball players, cheerleaders (how unoriginal but tasty!), and coaches traveling on a bus in the same rural area. The concept obviously requires a conveyor belt of attractive meat products to survive. Director Victor Salva once again leads the film, strangely causing continued protests over his conviction for child molestation a dozen years prior (the victim was a child actor in one of his films, well before concerns were raised about his filming of teens in Powder and the Jeepers Creepers films). Salva had worked with composer Bennett Salvay for the first film in the series (the similarity of their names is just a coincidence), and Jeepers Creepers 2 would be their fourth collaboration. Salvay already had a long, but sparse career as a television composer, occasionally venturing into a feature film project. The original Jeepers Creepers production had remained his first major assignment in several years, and he once again was inactive in between that project and Jeepers Creepers 2. Salva has stated that he was comfortable working with Salvay's style of atmospheric scoring, but wanted something more meaty for Jeepers Creepers 2. Just as the \"Creeper\" flies through the skies in pursuit of its victims, an \"airborne\" score is what Salva wanted in the music's pacing and instrumentation. Several textural aspects of the work define its character, digging at the primordial nature of the villain without making much attempt to address the hunted protagonists with any clear identity of their own. That alone says volumes about the level of character development in the story.\n\nWhereas the original Jeepers Creepers score by Salvay was mostly atmospheric, with a thematic presence and occasional burst of energy, Jeepers Creepers 2 mostly pulls the plug on that approach and injects the series with bombastic, nonstop action music. Even the moments of ambient environment in the sequel score exhibit a heightened sense of tension, with the entire work tearing at a considerable pace and throwing substantial blasts of orchestral mayhem into the mix. Salvay makes references to his Jeepers Creepers theme in the opening and at the climax, expanding upon the idea in several of the frenetic action cues. Absent, however, is any significantly powerful and clear performance of that theme, potentially leaving listeners of only the second score wondering exactly where that theme exactly is. The score groans and pounds with orchestral despair, sometimes utilizing African drums or electronic strings to accentuate the fright level. The electronic violin for the monster's weaponry is the only truly interesting textural application in the work. Salvay accomplishes his goal of bombast by throwing cliches from the horror genre at you with excessive force, hoping that aggression can suffice where creativity is lacking. Such is the failure of this score, unfortunately, for the stereotypical strikes, rhythms, and instrumentation are all too recognizable to be accepted as a worthy, stand-alone entry in the horror genre. Don't let the constant pace of the action fool you; Jeepers Creepers 2 is one, bland stock action cue after another, pulling famous horror techniques from several other soundtracks and doubling their power through mixing or orchestration. The massive confrontation in the latter half of the score, \"The Big Battle,\" begins to form a unique personality for the film, offering steady action rhythms and interesting low brass motifs over a longer period of development. In the end, though, Salvay's effort dissolves once again into a mess of stereotypical orchestral hits, even going so far as to push five more minutes of the same jumbled material at the listener in the end credits recording. This score was released by the same label concurrently to Graeme Revell's Freddy vs. Jason, which much more creatively twists tested genre sounds into an arguably more refreshing package. The original Jeepers Creepers score album is completely out of print, leaving this louder, but less inspired alternative for fans of the series to digest. ** @Amazon.com: CD or Download\n\nVIEWER RATINGS\n\n347 TOTAL VOTES\n\nAverage: 2.04 Stars ***** 18 **** 26 *** 53 ** 106 * 144 (View results for all titles)\n\nCOMMENTS\n\n8 TOTAL COMMENTS\n\nWay better than \"Freddy vs. Jason.\"\n\nhewhomustnotbenamed - October 15, 2012, at 1:57 p.m. 1 comment (825 views)\n\nBrass Section (Hollywood Studio Symphony)\n\nN.R.Q. - June 4, 2007, at 7:26 a.m. 1 comment (1689 views)\n\nJeepers Creepers rock song\n\nAngie LaPlante - October 4, 2005, at 9:02 p.m. 1 comment (6871 views)\n\nJeepers Creepers\n\nevangelist666 - February 25, 2005, at 4:48 a.m. 1 comment (2165 views)\n\nPlease produce a prequeal of Creepers Expand >>\n\nCharles - October 20, 2004, at 4:56 p.m. 1 comment (2744 views)\n\nScary ass hell!!\n\napril - May 11, 2004, at 11:22 a.m. 1 comment (2691 views)\n\nTRACK LISTINGS AND AUDIO\n\nTotal Time: 46:28\n\n 1.
