        "text": "Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to our review of Jeepers Creepers (2001). I’m Ryan and I’ll be hosting the review this evening after re-watching the film with my colleague Kris; although we’ve watched it together plenty times before, it’s a film that seems to work its way into our regular rotation. Jeepers Creepers was released in August of 2001, starring Gina Philips and Justin Long as Trish and Darry Jenner, brother and sister taking the back roads home for spring break (because nothing bad has ever happened whilst doing this exact thing). It was directed by Victor Salva, a convicted sex offender, something of a protégé for Francis Ford Coppola, and former employee of Disney; not that the three are related in any way. It was followed by Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003), and a third sequel has been in development hell since then (now scheduled for a 2017 release, if you’re reading this in the future please let us know how much further it has been delayed). As ever, our review contains major spoilers for the film, so read on at your own peril if you’ve not seen it.\n\nThe film is an odd structure of various set pieces, each of which seems like it could have been taken from a different work entirely. I like to compare this plot construction as imagining that someone has chosen to adapt four or five different short stories as the one narrative. Our first set piece is the film’s most effective, as Darry drives whilst playfully questioning his sister’s choice in men we see an old rusty truck approach from the horizon until it is honking its ragged horn and trying to run them off the road. Self-admittedly ripped off from Steven Spielberg’s 1971 TV movie Duel; this sequence manages somehow to have a jump scare without a jump, we see the truck approaching them for all of thirty seconds, it’s in our line of sight for the entire time, we think nothing of it until the trucks headlights are right outside Trish and Darry’s rear window and we hear the horn blaring for the first time.\n\nThe second set piece comes after some tension breaking banter between the siblings in the car (they had previously been playing a game trying to understand personalised licence plates, and Darry reads the trucks as BEATNGU “beating you”; he’s not 100% right) they notice the truck parked outside an abandoned the church, the dishevelled looking driver in his long coat and wide hat dumping what appears to be bodies down a tube. All very creepy, but when the truck driver notices them, you feel shivers down your own spine. Not being able to make out his face but seeing the shine of his eyes glaring into the camera makes for a very creepy moment.\n\nAfter Darry and Trish were chased again by the Creeper and run off the road (used to never understand why he wouldn’t attempt to kill them then and there when I first watched the film, on repeat viewings it makes sense he wants to scare them a bit more first) they resolve to go back in case whoever was thrown down that hole is still alive and in need of help. We get our third set piece when Darry falls down the hole (there were rats and Trish had to compromise her brothers safety in order to scream and wave her hands); not so much built on fright so much as general creepiness, Darry finds the person the Creeper had thrown down the hole halfway through their death rattle, with… something removed from them and then stitched back up. After that attempting to make his way up through the church he finds what he later describes to the police as “some psycho version of the Sistine Chapel”.\n\nOnce they are reunited and have driven to a diner to report what they have found there seems to be a change in the film, it’s difficult to describe. You might be able to look at everything up to this point as your standard backwoods slasher movie, after Trish and Darry arrives at the diner it turns into a proper monster movie. We see the changes in the next set piece, as Trish and Darry listen to the title song in the car we see the Creeper standing atop the police car following them. Just to be clear, we mean standing bolt upright on a moving police car not huddled clutching for dear life. A few beheadings, the sight of the Creeper removing someone’s tongue with their teeth (an effective image, Darry’s transfixed, horried reaction matching our own), Darry and Trish have had enough and just drive off. Already we can see this change, gone is the creepiness of the early sequences in exchange for pure monster movie mayhem.\n\nThe next two set pieces increasingly move the film into the territory of a monster movie abandoning any of the subtleties the film earlier showed. An encounter with Eileen Brennan’s Cat Lady loses some of its effect from the Tom & Jerry-esque sound effects we hear from the Creeper’s brawl through her trailer. Later still the Creeper’s attack on the police station to get Trisha and Darry is something more akin to a poor Alien knock off than the film we were watching earlier. Still, both sequences have their moments, the Cat Lady’s calm revelation that ‘that’s not my scarecrow’ and the final showdown with the Creeper in the interrogation room are two that spring to mind.\n\nThere is no denying that the various set pieces decrease with effectiveness each time we are subject to a new one. A common criticism of this film is that the second half does not live up to the promise of the first, whilst there is certainly an argument to be made that this is the case how many other movies are there that are movies of two half’s without people using it as a major criticism point? It’s not as though there is a huge dip in quality between the first half and the second half, it’s not as if we didn’t go from The Exorcist (1973) to Sinister 2 (2015) as we moved from one part of this film to another.\n\nThe differences between the first and second half’s of the film, for some a game-breaker as to this film’s quality but for everyone a notable tonal shift, can be put done to the fact that Jeepers Creepers is really a composite of various different types of horror movie, a real horror casserole. It starts out as what appears to be your typical post-Scream trying to be self aware slasher movie in the backwoods, but by the ends it has revealed itself as an old-fashioned monster movie owing more to the Creature from the Black Lagoon than Ghostface. This sums up nicely the difficulty to place this film in any one sub-genre, because it doesn’t really fit in nicely with the horror movies they were putting out in either the 90s or the 00s. It still has some degree of a glass half full outlook, in stark contrast to the nihilism that would come to be present in the genre later on in the 00s. The smug self-awareness we get from characters in the beginning also smacks so much of the 90s. It does however slot in very nicely with the odd strand of road movie horrors we got in the early 00s, all in a such a short space of time that surely it must have been coincidence. In addition to this film and its sequel, other films that are of the era and have horror on the open road are our previously reviewed Roadkill (2001), as well as Black Cadillac (2003), Dead End (2003), and Wrong Turn (2003).\n\nThe film holds up well throughout its run time in spite of the change in tone and the second half of the film not being as good as the first, but the creation of a new movie monster (not a human, but an honest to God teeth and claws monster!) is something to be enjoyed, even if created by someone who in all honesty could be called a monster themselves. Even so, both myself and Kris would give this an A rating; it has a lot of good ideas, some nice set pieces and a cool creature. It also occupies a personal space for having an effect on us both when we saw it at too young an age shortly after it first was released. If you want to watch it as part of a little marathon why not check out the road movies listed above, it goes great as a double feature with its sequel as well. Something myself and Kris have done on occasion is to just pick 5 random horror movies from the 00s and watch them in sequence, when doing this sometimes we’re led to the inescapable conclusion that Jeepers Creepers may be a dark horse choice for best horror movie of the 00s, it always seems like we forget one or two that really deserve the title; but certainly Jeepers Creepers should be in the Top 5 horror movies of that decade. Have your own Top 5 from the decade that brought us the iPod, One Night in Paris and George W. Bush? Let us know and we’ll see how ours compares."
