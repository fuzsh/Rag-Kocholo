        "text": "JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 is not a classic horror movie, but it is a superior one with some very exciting action sequences. It has the usual foul-mouthed American teenager characters, however, though it doesnâ€™t have any graphic sex scenes or explicit nudity like FREDDY VERSUS JASON and other horror movies released this year. Also unlike the Freddy Krueger and Jason movies, the violence, which, despite some very strong moments, is more in the line of human beings versus an actual monster. Thus, when the teenagers and adults finally get the upper hand on the winged, demonic creature, the movie manages to generate some positive visceral feelings of excitement.\n\nThe story opens with a suspenseful scene on a farm where the monster poses as a scarecrow and snatches away a young boy, despite the boyâ€™s anxious father, Mr. Taggart, chasing after them with his shotgun. Taggart and his other son decide to track the monster and kill it.\n\nCut to a group of high school basketball players coming home from a championship game. The white-skinned star of the team, Scott, is upset that the black coach let the star black players play more than he played.\n\nThe winged monster, known as the Creeper, disables the bus by flattening two of its tires with a weapon crafted from human flesh and bone. After taking the three adults, he starts attacking the teenagers on the bus one by one. One of the female cheerleaders on the bus has visions of two of the Creeperâ€™s dead victims, including the farmboy. The information she learns helps them all survive, but only for a little while. The Creeperâ€™s feasting soon begins in earnest.\n\nAs the teenagers try to fight back, Mr. Taggart comes to the rescue. He and his other son have crafted a large harpoon on their flatbed truck, and the battle to stop the monster begins in earnest.\n\nAfter an excellent beginning, JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 lets the audience down with its depiction of stupid American teenagers. One of the reasons why the first HALLOWEEN movie was such a trend-setting movie was the fact that the lead teenage heroine, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, was a bright, compassionate person, someone the audience could root for without feeling guilty. By focusing on her and Donald Pleasanceâ€™s intelligent, heroic psychiatrist, the first HALLOWEEN movie rose above the other negative aspects of its violently depicted mayhem. Since then, the number of intelligent characters, especially smart teenagers, has been few in most horror movies.\n\nWhen the teenagers start fighting back, however, this movie recovers nicely. Things really get going when Mr. Taggert shows up with his makeshift harpoon.\n\nIn addition to the excessive foul language and violent situations, JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 contains occult elements where the characters get information about the monster from the cheerleaderâ€™s visions of the two dead victims. Also, one of the teenagers is clearly a racist who mocks another boy for allegedly being homosexual (the other boy denies it). The movieâ€™s worldview seems mixed, therefore, with negative elements diluting its more redemptive, positive aspects. The movie demands extreme caution.\n\nPlease address your comments to:\n\nAlex Yemenidjian, CEO\n\nMGM/UA\n\n2500 Broadway Street\n\nSanta Monica, CA 90404-3061\n\nPhone: (310) 449-3000\n\nFax: (310) 449-3024\n\nSUMMARY: In JEEPERS CREEPERS 2, a farmer and some teenagers fight back against a winged, demonic creature trying to eat them. JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 has some very exciting action sequences, but its positive moral qualities are marred by excessive foul language, violence, gruesome moments, and an occult situation."
