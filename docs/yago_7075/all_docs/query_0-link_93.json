        "text": "Caught it Friday night. You know, when it comes to these types of movies, I'm not hard to please. These things are meant to be mindless fun etc. I don't get why some people really hated the first one, and others really liked it. Oh well.\n\nJC2 was pretty good. Not enough gore for my liking, but there were a lot of jump moments and such. The make-up and suit for Johnathan Breck's Creeper was pretty good too. I just love those teeth they have on him. The sniffing thing is still creepy. Even with the new sound effect and the close up shots of slits opening up in his nose.\n\nKind of nod to continuity, but in the first one, the Creeper had these kind of milked out colored eyes almost. When he takes Darry's eyes, well of course, they look human. The Creeper had those human eyes again for this one. And of course when the Creeper obtained a new head, the eye color became different.\n\nRay Wise is always good and I liked him in this. Justin Long's cameo has Darry was great to see. The psychic visions the girl was having came out pretty good.\n\nThe one thing I missed was seeing Darry's sister. This movie takes place a few days after the events of the first film, so like Ray Wise's character hell bent on revenge, Victor Salva easily good have had her character return for the same reason. Alas, it was not meant to be.\n\nThe scene with the Creeper picking out one by one all the kids he wanted on the bus was great!\n\nThe CG flying Creeper turned out pretty good too. It helped that they kept those effects at night time. That way it didn't look quite so obvious.\n\nAnd boy did the Creeper take a beating. The head thing was pretty cool to watch.\n\nAgain, I'm not hard to please with these types of films. This did not disapoint me. I had a great time and so did the other people in the audience. They all felt it and reacted accordingly to scenes of horror and humor.\n\nI like a sense of closure with my movies, and the ending of this film definatley has a sense of closure. After Ray Wise just lays waste to the Creeper and it goes into it's hybernation state, maybe it died (?), they skip ahead 23 years later. With an old Ray Wise sitting in a chair with his harpoon aimed at a dried up Creeper mounted on his barn wall. We don't know if the Creeper is dead. We're to believe that it's not and Ray Wise is making sure when it comes time for the Creeper to possibly wake up, he just wants to lay waste to it again, and again.\n\nI don't quite like the ending. I feel there is at least one more story to tell. Like maybe finally finding out the origin of the Creeper. He has a long history as we found out in this movie. If they go ahead with a third film, I don't know where they're gonna go with it if it's now 23 years in the future. Unless they go back and tell a story in the past or who the heck knows what. Also with this ending, it rules out seeing any of the characters we saw in the JC1 and JC2. I just don't see where they can take it.\n\nAll in all, a good movie. Very fun. You have to just let yourselves have fun at these kinds of movies and don't take them seriously.\n\nThe Clown Prince\n\nHmm... Well that sucks for you cause this is a great flick.\n\nYou guys who refuse to watch it should rethink that strategy. This movie is one of the great horror flicks, with a good plot. It has NO loveable characters and everyone you want to die dies. Except for the black guy in the truck. Why did they keep making it seem like he was gonna die only to survive being whipped straight into the ground by a forty-mile-an-hour-fast truck. That was the only thing that I really didn't like about the movie. The ending lost all knd of continuity. Okay so the kids on the bus made it to safety and serve no further purpose, but what about the ones that were in the truck? The one that was driving clearly crawled out before it exploded and what happened to the girl that was thrown out? She couldn't have died. I still don't know how th black guy survived that. Thats impossible. And in the end when you see the creeper crucified he's whole. When he was killed there was barely anything left of him.Just an arm a torso and a head. Yet there he is, wings and all.\n\nReally thats the only thing that bugged me about the movie. The best part was when the racist kid dies. God I hated that guy. HE'S supposed to be the protagonist? Good thing he was eaten alive. Other wise the movie would've sucked.\n\nSlash Tompson said:\n\nI still don't know how th black guy survived that. Thats impossible. And in the end when you see the creeper crucified he's whole. When he was killed there was barely anything left of him.Just an arm a torso and a head. Yet there he is, wings and all.\n\nIf you notice when the Creeper is hanging on the barn wall, there is a close up of either his arm or his leg. It shows that his missing limbs were sown back on. Kind of ironic as he did the same thing to his victims.\n\nAnd I agree that the guy surviving the truck crash seemed a little far fetched, but they tried to make it a little more believeable by him losing a leg in the accident.\n\nThe one thing that I hated the most in this movie was after the Creeper wraped that guy up in his wing and then decapitated him. His body falls back down into the bus, and with head missing, the body is like punching into the air and stumbling around for a few seconds before collapsing. That was a little ridiculous even for a horror film.\n\nThe Clown Prince\n\nThe Clown Prince said:\n\nThe one thing that I hated the most in this movie was after the Creeper wraped that guy up in his wing and then decapitated him.

That was a little ridiculous even for a horror film.\n\nThe Clown Prince\n\nActually that would actually happen should he be decapitated in such a traumatic way. Have you ever seen a chicken decapitade? Its crazy, man. You'd be convinced it was still alive. There was actually a case in the early twentieth century were a decapitated chicken did and could have stayed alive, if it weren't for this lady that forgot to clean out his esophagus and he suffocated; they fed him with a syringe.\n\nIts a very tricky thing, though. The conditions have to be just right. The guy has to have the crap scared out of him so that all the muscles and the organs start reacting by themselves. The nerves are tricked to believe there's still a brain, but it will only last for a while. Just like it did in the movie. Though i don't think he'll be able to stand with out a head since the head is what balances the body."
