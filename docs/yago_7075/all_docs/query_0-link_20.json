        "text": "Victor Salva’s Jeepers Creepers 2 takes place only a few days after the events depicted in the original sleeper hit, and with one day left in the Creeper’s 23-day feeding frenzy, the winged terror descends upon a group of teenagers riding home from a championship football game on East 9 Highway in Poho County. The film’s opener doesn’t quite match the minimalist high-note of the original’s creepy-crawly highway chase, but it gets the job done nonetheless. The Creeper incurs the wrath of a local farmer (Ray Wise, playing a variant of Lance Henriksen’s Pumpkinhead dad) when he snatches the man’s young son from a crow-infested cornfield. Given the time constraint the Creeper has to work with, there’s no logical explanation for just how particular the flesh-eating fiend gets when it comes to picking out his prey.\n\nJeepers Creepers 2 isn’t quite as amusing as the original, but it easily bests the first film’s prickly lasciviousness. The tongue-smacking Creeper has a wicked sense of humor, but what’s to be made of his fondness for male flesh? Once again, it’s impossible to separate Salva the director from Salva the convicted child molester. (There are enough boys in the film to make up an entire football team but it’s anyone’s guess as to how many schools send three-girl cheerleading squads to the state championships.) Once the three adult chaperones in the film are disposed of, it’s not long before Salva, err, Creeper descends on the Abercrombie & Fitch models huddled nervously inside their school bus. Even when the boys in the film do manage to put their clothes back on, it’s only a matter of time before the Creeper takes one kid’s shirt off (among other things) via an impromptu surgical switcheroo.\n\nInspired by Hitchcock’s The Birds and Lifeboat, Salva both evokes the panic of being trapped in close quarters and the hang-ups that resurface when the film’s interracial teens aren’t fending off the Creeper. Though the film’s straight boys repeatedly question one teen’s sexuality with a play on his name, they have no problem shaking their dicks around in front of the kid during a group pissing session. It’s your call whether Salva is calling attention to latent straight male fantasies or if he’s simply getting his rocks off by taking everyone’s clothes off any chance he gets. Of course, Salva is only half-interested in the little personal melodramas that cripple his “cock-of-the-walk” teens.\n\nThe lecherousness of Salva’s gaze has a way of spilling over onto the entire production, which probably makes the film a whole lot scarier than it should be. If not for the elegiac, sun-drenched allure of many of the film’s images, it’d be much harder to take its many absurdities, namely the fact that one girl is offered the particulars of Creeper’s feeding frenzy via her dreams. A horror film first, Jeepers Creepers 2 is in many ways a throwback to the cheesy ’70s disaster flicks like The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno. Only a seriously disturbed mind could move from one punchy, heart-pounding set piece to the next with this much lunatic abandon.\n\nImage/Sound\n\nBecause much of Jeepers Creepers 2 was shot at night, it’s a small wonder that this transfer is as good as it is: blacks are deep, highlights are excellent and there’s very little in the way of grain. Still, the film’s sun-burnt day scenes suffer less than the night scenes when it comes to edge enhancement and noise, something which could have been fixed if the features were placed on a second disc. The Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track is top-of-the-line. In many ways, it’s the scariest thing about the film.\n\nExtras\n\nListen to Wacko Salvo and the young cast of Jeepers Creepers 2 share their thoughts on the first of two commentary tracks. The teens giggle. Salvo talks about his Steadicam. Predictably, Salvo brilliantly downplays the lasciviousness of the film’s creepiest sequences. The second track is by Jonathan Breck, storyboard artist Brad Parker and make-up honcho Brian Penikas. Not as frightening as the first, but nonetheless in-depth. The impressive, 40-minute documentary “Lights, Action, Creeper: The Making of Jeepers Creepers 2” is divided into four parts: “Lights, Camera, Creeper” makes sweet love to the green screen process; “Creeper Creation” celebrates the film’s excellent storyboards; “Creeper Composer” shows us how Bennett Salvay tried to creep us out with his music; and “Digital Effects” is a lively montage of computer effects. Even better, “A Day in Hell” observes a typical day on the set of the film. Rounding out the disc is a funny collection of “deleted scenes, moments and lines” from the film, two storyboard reconstructions, two stills galleries, and trailers for Jeepers Creepers 2, Out of Time, and the complete first season of “Jeremiah.”\n\nOverall\n\nThe image and sound presentation on this disc is sufficient—or, at least, more comfortable than Victor Salva’s commentary alongside his young cast."
