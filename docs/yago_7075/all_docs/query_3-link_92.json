        "text": "Back in 2012, \"Jeepers Creepers\" made its long-awaited Blu-ray debut. Now, Shout Factory has released a brand-new Collector's Edition of the 2001 shocker and also of its 2003 follow-up \"Jeepers Creepers 2.\" Both are a welcome addition to horror collections and are the definitive editions that should be purchased.\n\nThe film that spawned a successful sequel and a forthcoming third movie, \"Jeepers Creepers\" harkens back to 50s sci-fi films such as \"Creature from the Black Lagoon.\" The first suspenseful 45 minutes resembles a stalker \"knife\" movie, as a young brother and sister witness a seemingly hulking man dumping a body down a sewer pipe on a country road.\n\nIn a turn of events, man becomes beast (Jonathan Breck) and an inane yet simple explanation from a random character, along with a campy appearance from Eileen Brennan as a cat hoarder, make \"Jeepers Creepers\" a rarity: a modern horror film without much gore.\n\nScream Factory includes the same Blu-ray special features released by MGM in 2012. These include \"Behind the Peepers,\" an exhausting documentary that interviews stars Justin Long and Gina Philips, along with director Victor Salva. The screen tests for both actors are included too and it's obvious why they were picked to play brother and sister.\n\nBrand new to Shout's \"Jeepers Creepers\" release are a new audio commentary with Salva and actors Long and Philips. Also on board is \"A Look Back at Jeepers Creepers,\" mostly an interview segment with the director. There are also two career retrospectives shown for producer Barry Opper and actress Patricia Belcher.\n\n\"Jeepers Creepers 2\" picks up a mere two days after the events of part one, where a school bus full of a disparate array of students become victim to the beast. With many of the male students shirtless often, \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" appears to be slightly homo-erotic. It's not as enjoyable as part one, yet it does have its creep-out moments. Ray Wise (\"Twin Peaks\") has a lead role as a vengeful farmer.\n\nAll of \"JC2's\" DVD special features are carried over, including several audio commentaries and a slew of small featurettes. Shout outdoes itself on this collector's edition Blu-ray by also giving fans three brand-new extras:\n\n\"Jeepers Creepers 2: Then and Now\" talks to Salva again and various crew members, and the long-discussed \"Jeepers Creepers 3\" gets mentioned often.\n\n\"A Father's Revenge\" is Ray Wise's insightful interview segment, who was hired based on his work in \"Twin Peaks.\"\n\n\"Don't Get Off the Bus\" interviews three actors from the film, none of whom are the kids that were on the bus. Rather, it's the adults from the film who appear in this featurette."
