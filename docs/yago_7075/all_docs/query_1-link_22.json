        "text": "Jeepers Creepers: Reborn is a 2022 horror film directed by Timo Vuorensola from a screenplay by Sean Michael Argo. It is a reboot of the Victor Salva series, the third and final which was Jeepers Creepers 3, and it intended to set up a new trilogy in the Jeepers Creepers franchise.\n\nIt is a stand alone movie as far as the events of the other three films go.\n\nPlot[]\n\nJeepers Creepers: Reborn takes place in a more modern setting, and unfolds as the Horror Hound festival holds its first-ever event in Louisiana, where it attracts hundreds of geeks, freaks, and die-hard horror fans. Among them is fanboy Chase and his girlfriend Laine, who begins to experience unexplained premonitions and disturbing visions associated with the town's past and The Creeper. As the festival arrives and the blood-soaked entertainment builds to a frenzy, Laine believes that something unearthly has been summoned.\n\nCast[]\n\nSydney Craven as Laine\n\nImran Adams as Chase\n\nJarreau Benjamin as The Creeper\n\nGabriel Freilich as Sam\n\nPete Brooke as Stu\n\nAl Derado as Executioner\n\nKarina Kinga Kiss as Cut Throat Girl\n\nCharlie Bentley as Infulencer\n\nLolly Watkins as Fire Performer\n\nHelen Lauren as Medic\n\nProduction[]\n\nPre-production[]\n\nThe first film in the new reboot of the Jeepers Creepers film series, Reborn was written by Sean Michael Argo as part of a new trilogy that would separate it from the original three films written and directed by Victor Salva.\n\nFilming[]\n\nThe project began production in December 2020 and was scheduled to conclude quickly by Christmas. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, filming was split into two parts, the second of which began in early January 2021.\n\nThe original trilogy is noted for taking place almost entirely in real moving cars or outdoors with minimal sequences taking place indoors or on soundstages. Reborn is the first in the series to be shot almost entirely on soundstages and heavily utilize virtual sets, a process of having actors in an empty room surrounded by green screen.\n\nThe production crew and cast stayed at Froyle Park Country Estate, Ryebridge lane, Alton, Hampshire, England, a 16th Century Jacobean manor house, during filming\n\nPost-Production[]\n\nPrincipal photography for Reborn took place in the United Kingdom at Black Hangar Studios, and in the United States on location and at Orwo Studios, in the city of Jackson, Louisiana.\n\nMarketing[]\n\nAt the 2021 European Film Market, Foresight Unlimited showed a promotional reel of footage for international sales.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nA new version of the musical theme \"Jeepers Creepers\" had to be made because Screen Media Films did not have the license or permission to use the song \"Jeepers Creepers\" by Jack Teagarden, this because royalties had to be paid to the owner of the song rights. The song has not been heard in the Jeepers Creepers movies since the first movie. This is because previously they did not want to pay royalties on Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003) and Jeepers Creepers III (2017). The new version of the song is more focused on classic New Orleans jazz.\n\nThe fact of offering victims to the creeper as an offering or tribute is a nod to the Jeepers Creepers comic where, since the time of the Aztecs, they offered human prey to the creature as a tribute to pacify it and not attack them.\n\nThe opening scene of the film with Dee Wallace and Gary Graham playing Marie and Ronald. It is a reference to the story of killer Dennis DePue, a Michigan resident who was caught throwing his wife's corpse and chased after witnesses. This was one of the bases that inspired Victor Salva in the original film, in addition to the fact that the appearance of the characters played by Wallace and Graham tries to resemble the couple made up of the murderer Dennis DePue and his unfortunate wife: Marilynn DePue. Even Chase sees the fictional portrayal in a show that spoofs Unsolved Mysteries (1987), the investigative series that exposed the case in the 1990s.\n\nLongtime fans are not pleased with this film being announced; feeling that this outright ends Victor Salva's work and gives no conclusion/death to the Creeper of the original movies as was planned for the true fourth film. Though it is hoped a genuine fourth film may be released in 2024 to match when the events of the Creeper waking up will happen, but that would have to include the original director if it happened.\n\nIt is billed as a reboot, and the script doesn't have any direct connection to the events on the previous movies. The movie may simply be intended to be seen as a branched timeline as Victor Salva didn't write it.\n\nIn March 16, 2021, Myriad Pictures, the production company behind Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3, filed a property fraud lawsuit against Infinity Films Holdings, one of the film's production companies, for producing the film without Myriad's \"knowledge or involvement\" and selling the distribution rights to Screen Media Films.\n\nMuch of the film's technical and production team have cameos at the horror convention. In turn, there are people with certain costumes that refer to Beetlejuice (1988), It (2017), and The Shining (1980) amongst others.\n\n[]"
