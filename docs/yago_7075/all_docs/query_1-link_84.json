        "text": "Chase (Imran Adams) and his girlfriend Laine (Sydney Craven) have come to Louisiana especially for the legendary Horror Hound Festival. So of course they don't miss the chance to take part in an exclusive tour of a real horror house. Laine, who has been haunted by mysterious and disturbing visions since her arrival, is not really comfortable with this excursion, but lets herself be infected by Chase's enthusiasm. What the two of them and the rest of their little tour group don't suspect: The dreaded Creeper, who kills people for 23 days every 23 years, is back to quench his thirst for blood. And in the process, he's also targeting Laine and Chase...\n\n\"Jeepers Creepers: Reborn\" is the fourth installment in the franchise and a loose sequel to \"Jeepers Creepers 2\". It was directed this time not by Victor Salva, but by Finn Timo Vuorensola, who had previously directed the two \"Iron Sky\" films. The film starts promisingly, as the prologue, which features genre icon Dee Wallace (\"Cujo\", \"The Beast\", \"Critters\"), is a successful reminiscence of the really good first film. The fact that after this good start an attempt is made to steer the whole thing in a slightly different direction is in principle not bad either. Unfortunately, the production can never even come close to exploiting the potential that is initially quite present.\n\nThe film has problems on various levels. Acting, for example, nothing award-worthy is offered here - apart from a possible nomination for the \"Golden Raspberry\" perhaps. But in the horror genre, great acting is not necessarily important if there is enough suspense and gore. But Timo Vuorensola fails miserably on this level as well, unfortunately. This is also due to the meager special effects, which repeatedly prevent a real scary atmosphere from arising. Especially in some \"Exterior shots\" the look is extremely trashy, which is more amusing than scary.\n\nThe story itself seems as if different ideas were simply slapped together here, no matter whether the whole thing makes any sense in the end. It was completely lost sight of the fact that such a film should be fun for its target audience and in the best case also give them goosebumps. Unfortunately, this doesn't work at all. Too bad! Still: The Rebirth of the Creeper is better than the unspeakably boring part 3. No great achievement, but still... All in all, my rating can not go beyond a \"nur sehr bedingt sehenswert\". Too bad!"
