        "text": "It has been well over a decade since the Jeepers Creepers franchise last graced the silver screen, and that is too long if you ask us. The horror franchise has become one of the most utterly terrifying series in the genre, and fans have demanded a sequel ever since the credits rolled on Jeepers Creepers 2 in 2003. We have received some conflicting reports about where and when Jeepers Creepers 3 will take place, but now it seems that the third entry in the beloved franchise will fall between the events of the first two films.\n\nRumors associated with the Jeepers Creepers franchise have been a dime a dozen in recent months, but the latest reports finally provide a decent timeline placement for Jeepers Creepers 3. Instead of taking place after the second film, Jeepers Creepers 3 will apparently take place between the events of the first and second movies in the series -- not unlike how Alien: Covenant bridges Prometheus with Ridley Scott's original 1979 Alien film. Based on this rumor, it seems that the next film in the series will take place shortly after the first film's conclusion, and center on a group of hunters on a mission to stop the Creeper's reign of terror. Because the Creeper is still very much around to cause mayhem during the events of the second film in the series, it seems highly unlikely that this group of hunters will succeed in their mission to kill this iconic monster.\n\nNews related to Jeepers Creepers 3 has also suggested that it will set up a fourth film that will bring the continuity of the franchise full circle. Bringing the focus back to Gina Philips' Trish Jenner in the present day, the rumored fourth film will follow her as she teams up with the Taggarts from Jeepers Creepers 2 in order to take down the Creeper once and for all.\n\nIf we are to believe these rumors from Bloody Disgusting about the future of the Jeepers Creepers franchise, then there's quite a bit to get excited about here. The concept behind the third film is already enticing, but the prospect of a planned fourth film that will directly tie back into the story of Trish Jenner is incredibly exciting. This shows a degree of forethought and adherence to continuity that's not often seen in modern horror franchises, so our hope remains high that we may actually see a proper arc play out over the next two films."
