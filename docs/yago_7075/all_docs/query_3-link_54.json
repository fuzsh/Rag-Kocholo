        "text": "I'm not a big fan of spoilers - information that gives away key plot points - but at the conclusion of this review I'm going to reveal the ending of \"Jeepers Creepers 2.\" I do this because it was my favorite part of the movie and also because it featured something I've been waiting years to see in a horror movie.\n\nTherefore, do not read the last paragraph if you want to experience the film as a total surprise.\n\nThat said, \"Creepers 2\" is better than its predecessor, which was shot in and around Marion County. After it became a surprise hit in 2001, writer/director Victor Salva vowed not to make the sequel in that county because, during the shoot, the Star-Banner newspaper revealed he is a convicted child molester. Many in the community - particularly the School Board - were less than thrilled, especially because some shots were to be filmed near an elementary school.\n\nI hate to tell Salva this, but that conviction is going to follow him to the end of his days. Anyway, the sequel was shot on the outskirts of Los Angeles, a city, it seems, more open-minded about sex offenders (it recently gave another one, Roman Polanski, the Oscar for Best Director).\n\nThe first movie introduced the Creeper (Jonathan Breck), an ancient creature of indeterminate origins who slumbers for 23 years at a time, awaking to feed on humans for 23 days because, apparently, this boogum has a sense of symmetry. The Creeper is vaguely man-shaped but has slimy, reptilian skin. He also has huge bat-like wings, and his favored method of attack is snatching people and carrying them off like the flying monkeys in \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\n\nThe Creeper essentially is the ultimate Unkillable Killer of slasher films because he replaces his damaged body parts with corresponding pieces from his victims. At one point he gets speared right through the head with a javelin - an eyeball spittooned on the tip, natch - and he then hunts for a new skull.\n\nAs a filmmaker, Salva is less an imaginative creator and more a man good at distilling ideas from other sources. The biggest influence here is \"Lifeboat,\" where people are trapped in a tiny space with their lives threatened.\n\nHere, a basketball team is riding the bus home after winning the state championship. A blown tire strands them in the middle of nowhere, and the three adults are quickly picked off by the Creeper, leaving the teens stranded on the bus to ponder their plight. Meanwhile, a taciturn farmer named Taggart (Ray Wise), whose younger son was an early victim in the film, is riding to the rescue with his older son and a makeshift harpoon he's concocted from stuff in his barn.\n\nThe bus group contains the usual array of stereotypes. Scott (Eric Nenninger), the star of the team, would seem to be the hero, but we learn he bears a grudge because as one of the few white players on the team, he fears reverse racism threatens his success. Deaundre (Garikayi Mutambirwa), the black star who's eclipsed him, refuses to accept Scott's guff. There's also a cheerleader (Nicki Aycox) who receives dream warnings about the Creeper from his victim from the first movie (Justin Long); a nebbish equipment manager (Billy Aaron Brown, channeling Rick Moranis); and a level-headed reporter for the school newspaper (Travis Schiffner) the other boys suspect is gay (playing on the character's name, they call him \"Izzy, or Isn't He?\").\n\nThe action sequences are more pumped up than the original, though the CGI effects of the flying Creeper are a bit chintzy. Salva has a good eye for shadow and light, and layers the gloom adroitly. His story structure skills are less developed, and the lack of a single protagonist makes it hard to invest emotionally in any one of the characters.\n\nBut horror film buffs should savor \"Jeepers Creepers 2,\" as it is one of the better additions to the genre in recent memory.\n\nSPOILER WARNING: An unpleasant hallmark of horror films is the stupidity of the characters to presume the Unkillable Killer is actually dead once he's finally down. The ending of \"Jeepers 2\" shows Taggart 23 years later, now an old man, sitting in his barn with the Creeper's body tacked to the wall. He's got the harpoon trained on it, and the expectant twinkle in Taggart's eye gives you the impression he hasn't moved much in the intervening years. Pretty smart; although it would have been smarter to use his tinkerer's skills to chop the Creeper up into sushi.\n\nBut, hey, they have to leave the door open for \"Jeepers Creepers 3.\"\n\nChristopher Lloyd is entertainment editor at the Star-Banner in Ocala."
