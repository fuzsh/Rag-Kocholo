        "text": "A third film in the ‘Jeepers Creepers’ series has long been on the cards - but an actor’s union has raised concerns due to the director’s past.\n\nDeadline report that a casting notice had been posted seeking an 18-year old actress for a role in his horror sequel, set to shoot this spring in British Colombia.\n\nHowever, the Union of British Columbia Performers have put out an alert to casting agencies warning of director Victor Salva’s 1989 conviction as a sex offender.\n\nOn the set of his first film ‘Clownhouse’ in 1988, Salva molested a 12-year old actor multiple times, as well as videotaping one of the incidents. (Further details on the case here.)\n\nAfter pleading guilty to charges of lewd and lascivious conduct, oral copulation with a minor, and procuring a child for pornography, Salva was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nHe served 15 months of his sentence, completed his parole by 1992, and was soon thereafter directing again. His subsequent films include 1995 fantasy drama ‘Powder,’ and the first two ‘Jeepers Creepers’ films in 2001 and 2003.\n\nThe Union’s alert reads, “It has recently come to our attention that a casting breakdown has gone out for a feature film entitled Jeepers Creepers III, and that the director of the film, Victor Salva, was convicted of sexual misconduct in 1988. The conviction allegedly resulted from misconduct involving a minor whom Mr. Salva was directing at the time.\n\n“At this time we would like to remind our members and their agents that, under Article A2702 (Safety & Welfare of a Minor) of the BC Master Production Agreement, a performer has the right to refuse work if they believe that the nature of the work is unsafe.”\n\nCasting website Breakdown Services, which had previously hosted the casting notice, have subsequently removed it and have distanced themselves from the production, stating, “All submissions made by any agent on this project are no longer available to the casting director nor any member of the production staff.”\n\nPicture Credit: MGM-UA, WENN"
