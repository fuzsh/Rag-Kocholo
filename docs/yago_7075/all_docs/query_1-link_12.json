        "text": "Personally? No thank you. While the original creator no longer receives any sort of money from this licence (as far as I am aware) I personally wouldn't want this game tainted by something he created. I can get separating the artist from art, but from a convicted child molester? That's stretching it, in my opinion.\n\nBHVR has already also said they will never make a Jeepers Creepers chapter, and I doubt they would change their mind with this particular issue.\n\nI didn't know that the devs even weighed in on the issue. I guess I should have searched longer. It's an understandable viewpoint. I myself saw the film before knowing ANYTHING about it, other than the film's setup: A creature comes around every 23 months to feed for 23 days (or something to that effect). I was looking to catch a film for my 23rd birthday, which happens to take place on September 23. I thought \"there is no way NOT to see this movie\".\n\nI walked away thinking that it was a lot of fun. It wasn't until afterward that I learned who Victor Salva was. For that reason I can separate the art from the artist but yes, it is a stretch. Generally speaking I don't believe that convicted child molesters should be allowed to have careers, at least not those that are what they were up to when they committed their crimes in the first place.\n\nShame that the situation is what it is, but I understand the position 100 percent. Again, I hadn't seen the character mentioned anywhere in my travels through the fog so I thought that maybe he simply hadn't been addressed. Guess I'm a little late on that one. :)\n\nI believe it was brought up a decent amount of time ago, in which they responded they had no interest in making a Jeepers Creepers chapter because of the director's crimes. And I'm in the same boat as you- I saw the film way before I knew of what he had done, and I liked the film decently enough. I thought the Creeper was scary, I liked the Premise (even though it was very Pennywise) I do like the Creeper, but it's just... Tough, you know? At the end of the day, even though it has its issues, I'd rather keep DbD far away from it.\n\nAnd you don't really have to apologize for bringing up old topics. It happens all the time- Hell, I've done it a few times. Mostly on accident, but it still happens. If you haven't discussed it before, it's perfectly fine to make a topic about (imo).\n\nThanks, I appreciate that. I just used to moderate a forum and know how irritating it was when some buffoon would bring up a subject that had already been discussed prior, especially if that subject was pretty firmly established as \"NO\", lol.\n\nIt's a shame what that guy did. He made a tight little horror movie. Good atmosphere, good monster design. But what he did behind the scenes on one of his previous films was, in my opinion, completely unforgivable. I don't blame BHVR for taking the stance that they did. The company I moderated for was THQ, who did the yearly WWE wrestling games, and when Chris Benoit slaughtered his family the topic of his possible inclusion in future games was a topic of contention for years, even though the answer seemed, to most of us, painfully obvious. Still, I enjoyed hearing both sides. Was he one of the greatest wrestlers in the history of the sport? Absolutely. Did he also kill his wife and child? Yep.\n\nThanks for the topics guys. But don't feel obligated to respond, I understand now that this is previously covered territory and don't mean to rehash any controversial topics.\n\nThe Springtrap thing is interesting. Not being anywhere NEAR a superfan of Five Nights at Freddy's (only played the first game, and never beat it at that), I followed the lore and it actually gets pretty dark. Springtrap is the decaying bunny-shaped animatronic that houses an equally rotted corpse of a child murderer who fled into the trap to hide from the souls of the children he killed, and which sprung (hence the name) closed like an iron maiden, killing him. It's a really unique idea and some of the subsequent games show the character essentially being consumed by hell for what he'd done.\n\nYet, like I said about the anime discussion, FNAF is so distinctly already its own thing that, to me, it doesn't feel like it would fit properly in a game like this one.\n\nYou guys do know that you don't have to respond anymore because I was already told that this question was asked a while back when I wasn't here, right? :)\n\nIt's cool, I got the answers I wanted. The majority of people (most importantly the devs) don't want him in the game because of the connection to a child molester (many people don't know that Wes Craven directed porn, and was even in at least one of his films (NOT as a sexual performer) but being in porn is NOTHING similar to what Victor Salva did. I'm just saying that with some digging there's usually some embarrassing stuff about a lot of people out there.\n\nBut let me reiterate: While I wish there were a way for the Creeper to be in the game without any kind of involvement or payment or thoughts of Salva (I know that's not seemingly possible but I stand by the quality of the original film all the same), I am wholly satisfied with the negative reaction people would have with his inclusion. I'm fine with it. Asked and answered. I'm not trying to change anyone's minds, I just wanted to hear the consensus. You're all welcome to keep posting in this thread, but for whatever it's worth I myself am fine with it disappearing or being deleted since I wasn't aware that it's been asked before.\n\nBut for the record, while they're not mutually exclusive, I too would be happy to see Pumpkinhead, Candyman, Pinhead, a Cenobite, any number of other famous killers as well. This was never a plea to get the Creeper in, only a question about how everyone feels about him. Now I know, so there's nothing more to be said. :)"
