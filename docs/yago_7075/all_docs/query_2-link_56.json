        "text": "Official Synopsis:\n\n“When their bus is crippled on the side of a deserted road, a team of high school athletes discover an opponent they cannot defeat – and may not survive. Staring hungrily at them through the school bus windows, the “Creeper” returns again and again. But when the teammates discover that it’s selective about whom it attacks, it will test their ability to stick together – as the insatiable menace tries to tear them apart!”\n\nJeepers Creepers 2 returns with a story even bigger than the first. Picking up only days after the original left off, the opening alone lets the viewer know they are in store for a wild ride that that will thrill and entertain.\n\nWhatever problems I may have had in the first film are erased in the sequel. Rarely can one say that a sequel is more entertaining than an original film, and although it is a matter of opinion for sure, I was highly entertained by Jeepers Creepers 2. The mixture of horror and comedy is brilliantly balanced, as the small hints of comedic effect in the first one are preserved in the second with several hilarious scenes between the Creeper and his prey. Jeepers Creepers 2 isn’t about good and evil, or about taking sides in this struggle with life and death. What the first one was able to do so well was give us an entertaining story without having to root for one or the other. The same can be said for the second as well. You aren’t left wanting more scares, or anyone in particular to meet their untimely end; you just want more.\n\nAlthough the budget for the second is increased very little, it makes you think it was two or three times the amount of the original. The effects are amazing, both make-up and special effect wise, especially for the time. The contrast of the bigger story but making it so much more isolated than the first gives the sequel a very interesting feel. This is a Monster in the House type story, but of course with a bus. That isolation and fear of what lies beyond the doors of the bus makes for a great horror film.\n\nAlthough the story focuses heavily on the teens on the bus, one aspect of the film that really shines is Ray Wise who plays Jack Taggart Sr. After his son is taken by the Creeper, he embarks on a quest of vengeance that is sure to satisfy those with a special place in their heart for revenge flicks. Wise delivers a powerful performance that one would expect to see in something with perhaps a higher profile than Jeepers Creepers 2. Regardless, it is one of the best parts of the film and makes for some great conflict between him and the Creeper.\n\nVideo\n\nJeepers Creepers 2 is presented in High Definition 1080p 2.35:1. The transfer looks really good, and no defects or blemishes were noticed. A large majority of the scenes take place at night, and although there is a little grain noticeable, it never overtakes any of the scenes. Color levels seem consistent, with a yellowish hue that plays into the rural feel of the film.\n\nAudio\n\nThe audio is presented in DTS Master Audio 5.1. The score is fantastic, going above and beyond the first film in terms of a theatrical feel. Levels are good throughout the film, with some great use of the surrounds.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nScream Factory has put together a phenomenal set of extras, all well worth taking a look at. With rumors abound of the third installment, there is some good information here to get you excited. On this set you’re going to see:\n\nDisc 1:\n\nAudio Commentary By Writer/Director Victor Salva And Cast Members\n\nAudio Commentary By Jonathan Breck (The Creeper), Brad Parker (Production Illustrator) And Brian Penikas (Special Effects Makeup)\n\nDisc 2:\n\nNEW Jeepers Creepers 2: Then And Now Featuring New Interviews With Writer/Director Victor Salva, Director Of Photography Don FauntLeRoy, Editor Ed Marx And Actor Tom Tarantini\n\nNEW A Father’s Revenge – An Interview With Actor Ray Wise\n\nNEW Don’t Get Off The Bus – Interviews With Actors Tom Tarantini, Thom Gossom Jr. And Diane Delano\n\nA Day In Hell – A Look At The Filming Of Jeepers Creepers 2\n\nLights, Camera, Creeper: The Making Of Jeepers Creepers 2 Featuring Writer/Director Victor Salva, Actors Travis Schiffner, Josh Hammond, Billy Aaron Brown, Eric Nenninger, Nicki Aycox, Director Of Photography Don FauntLeRoy And More…\n\nCreeper Creation Featuring Interviews With Production Illustrator Brad Parker, Special Make-up Effects Artist Brian Penikas And Jonathan Breck\n\nThe Orphanage Visual Effects Reel\n\nCreeper Composer – An Interview With Composer Bennett Salvay And Writer/Director Victor Salva\n\nStoryboard Renditions Of Scenes Not Filmed – “The Creeper’s Lair” And “Ventriloquist Creeper”\n\nDeleted Scenes\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\nJeepers Creepers 2 is a fantastic addition to an already cult favorite, and in my opinion is much more entertaining than the first. This set that Scream Factory has released is well worth picking up, and is highly recommended."
