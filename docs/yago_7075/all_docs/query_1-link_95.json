        "text": "Searching for politically useful representations of homosexuality in gangster films might at first glance appear a pointless task. A genre that celebrates archetypal heterosexual masculinity in its most crude and base forms, it is not the most obvious choice for developing queer readings, or for seeking to historicise queerness. This is a genre that uses racism, homophobia and misogyny in an almost casual manner, that rewards parasitic opportunism and glorifies violence to a degree verging on the pornographic. A brief look at the International Movie Database top 250 films illustrates the continuing popularity of the gangster genre, though I would argue that this has less to do with cinematic genius and more to do with upholding ideals of hegemonic masculinity in a world in which (at least according to British men's magazines such as Loaded and Nuts) masculinity is supposedly under attack. This celebration of \" real men \" (i.e. white heterosexual masculine supremacy) can be understood as a defence against the supposed encroachment of feminism and lesbian and gay rights, of political correctness and of equal opportunities legislation. Claire Monk has commented on the 1990s fashion within film culture for older British crime films, stating that a reverence for films such as Get Carter and The Long Good Friday demonstrates an \" uncritical, backward-looking self-referentiality and unacknowledged nostalgia \" (172). Given the fact that part of this nostalgic appeal must surely lie in the forceful reassertion of hegemonic masculinity, the gangster film would appear an odd place to start discussing queer representation and histories. Despite this initial reading of the genre, however, I contend that such texts can operate as sites of sexual subversion, providing a counterpoint to the (over)represented metropolitan gay male lifestyle found in contemporary popular culture. I also believe that alternative queer narratives can be mined from such texts, providing a glimpse of historical configurations of\n\nI intend to reflect on the construction of masculinity and the homo-erotic drive in the film Sideways (2004) by Alexander Payne. The film illustrates with due complexity the dialogue between normative dispositions and libidinal motilities, taking the meaning of relating to other levels of textuality. These al- luded new levels push what is most often understood by mas- culine heterosexual friendship. To better articulate the reading of this text, it will also be important to read the intertextual di- mension to the film, since nowadays the bromantic comedy paradigm has become hegemonic, with widely-viewed films such as I Love You Man to support the case. However, few of them take the construction of masculinity and sexuality to the “sideway” places as it so happens with Payne’s film, where rigid and hetero-normative classifications fall short to account for the density and textual economy of this friendship. In order to address the subject, a bromantic comedy genealogy will be proposed, that takes into consideration both cinema and other media; this will in turn shed some light on the film’s dialogic complexity. Lastly, psychoanalysis and gender studies will help read the “not so straight story” to the story. Me propongo leer la construcción de la masculinidad y la pul- sión homoerótica en el filme Sideways (Entre copas, 2004) de Alexander Payne. El filme demuestra el complejo diálogo que existe entre disposiciones normativas y motilidades libidina- les. Lleva pues el sentido del “relacionamiento” –del vínculo– a otros niveles de textualidad, poniendo en entredicho lo que generalmente se entiende como amistad masculina hetero- sexual. Para exponer dicha lectura, se tendrá en cuenta la in- tertextualidad del film, con el paradigma hegemónico del “bromance comedy” en cabeza, paradigma harto divulgado por medio de filmes taquilleros como I Love You Man. Sin em- bargo, pocos filmes de dicho paradigma sondean en las con- strucciones de masculinidad y sexualidad justamente en sus lugares “aparte” o “marginales” –\"sideways\"– como en el filme de Payne, donde categorías rígidas heteronormativas no pueden dar entera cuenta de la densidad y economía tex- tual de esta amistad. Abonarán a dicha lectura acercamientos desde la teoría queer y psicoanalítica, además de una genea- logía de la “bromance comedy”, para mejor descuadrar esta en absoluto cuadrada amistad.\n\n‘The summer I was eight years old…’ Two boys are introduced near the start of Mysterious Skin (2004) – Brian Lackey (George Webster) and Neil McCormack (Chase Ellison) – narrated by their teenage selves (Brady Corbet and Joseph Gordon-Levitt). ‘The summer I was eight years old’, Brian recalls, ‘five hours disappeared from my life’. Young Brian wakes up in a closet with a bloody nose. The last thing he remembers is sitting on the Little League bench as it starts to rain. From that moment, Brian experiences frequent nosebleeds, bed-wetting and passing out as he tries to make sense of his lost time. He later comes to believe that he was abducted by aliens who experimented on him. The juxtaposition of Brian’s story with Neil’s suggests a more disturbing explanation that is much closer to home... The film navigates the politics and poetics of representation to present a film that reveals and exposes our assumptions about normative and non-normative sexuality, a recurring theme across the essays in this collection.\n\nThe physicality of an ageing body is inescapable, and for this reason the processes of ageing and the signs that mark ageing identities often appear as something beyond one’s social and cultural self, something innate. While it has become commonplace—at least in a post-structural context—to argue that one performatively assembles selfhood, age appears bound to the temporal norms that intersect with the corporeal signs of passing time. However, because ageing is a process embedded in the social and cultural, discourses of ageing construct normative and healthy modalities of ageing while rendering the nonnormative unhealthy, undesirable or deviant. Much like the physicality of the human body, which through a cultural reading is sexed—in turn ‘determining’ a normative and thus socially appropriate performance of gender (Butler 1993)—the physical signs of an aged body are also interpreted through a cultural lens. Age, like sex, corresponds to a set of social and cultural norms that sketch out desirable, culturally intelligible and thus successful performances of how one should age. Just as a female body becomes normalized through its reiteration of femininity, an ageing body similarly becomes normalized through the reiteration of prescriptive age-appropriate behaviours. Queer scenes can offer one such example of ‘nonnormative’ ageing, where typically youthful and less coherent social activities such as attending gigs and dance parties, nonmonogamous sexual play and recreational drug-taking may continue to remain prevalent and more central to one’s lifestyle choices than marriage, reproduction and child rearing (Halberstam 2005; Taylor 2010). Of course, not all queers resist the reiteration of prescriptive age-appropriate behaviours, but some do, choosing to depart from the normative temporal frames of marriage and kinship family, and create alternative modalities of post-youth scenic identifi cation. It is at the intersections of ageing, sexual identity and scenic participation that I take up my argument of queer ageing."
