The film takes its name from the 1938 song, featured in the film under a version by Paul Whiteman.[6] Patricia Belcher and Eileen Brennan also appear in supporting roles, with Salva making a cameo appearance.\n\nThe film was a co-production between the United States and Germany, with United Artists co-financing the American Zoetrope title. It filmed in various towns in Florida starting in August 2000 after Salva convinced the studios to cast Phillips and Long with the help of executive producer Francis Ford Coppola, who had previously financed his 1989 directorial debut. Due to unforeseen budget cuts, Salva had to rewrite the third act during production."
