        "text": "The Temple of Olympian Zeus and the Arch of Hadrian are both names that you’ve probably come across while planning your next trip to Athens. Now, you might think that the location of these sites – a few minutes away from Acropolis, Syntagma, and Zappeion Hall – might be the sole reason for their inclusion in top-notch travel guides and publications.\n\nBut you’d be surprised to find that there is much more to these significant monuments than serving as a unique backdrop for tourist photographs; and that their reputation is completely justified.\n\nOf course, the iconic attractions of Athens like the Parthenon and the Acropolis museum will always end up on the top spots of your bucket list.\n\nYet, we urge you to save some time for visiting the Temple of Olympian Zeus and the Arch of Hadrian, especially if you’re interested in experiencing the rich cultural heritage and history of Athens.\n\nAll you have to do now is follow this guide and make the most of your time there.\n\nWhat Is the Temple of Olympian Zeus?\n\nThe Temple of Olympian Zeus, more commonly known as the Columns of Olympian Zeus or simply the Olympieion among the locals, refers to the remnants of an ancient colossal temple that was dedicated to Zeus, the patriarch figure of all Olympian Gods and the ruler of Mount Olympus.\n\nThe famous temple is located in the city center of Athens, just a short walk away from the Acropolis and Syntagma Square.\n\nThe History of the Temple of Olympian Zeus\n\nThe construction of the Temple of Olympian Zeus began in the 6th century BC, a time when Athens was still ruled by the notorious Athenian tyrants who commissioned its erection with the vision of it ultimately being the largest and most impressive monument in the world.\n\nA few years later, its construction was halted due to a radical change in the city’s regime marked by the banishment of tyrant Hippias to exile.\n\nFor no less than 338 years, the temple remained incomplete, in danger of being forgotten in the sands of time.\n\nIt wasn’t until 174 BC when King Antiochus IV ordered the continuation of the construction while also decreeing that the monument be built with Pentelic marble rather than limestone and instructing that the architectural style change from Doric to Corinthian.\n\nKing Antiochus met his end before seeing the manifestation of his ideas; however, once again, the vision of the Temple of Olympian Zeus was coming close to being devoured by Lethe.\n\nJust as the dreams of grandeur were beginning to fade, and approximately six centuries since the last stone was set into place, the Roman emperor Hadrian commanded the resumption of the construction, and this time, the Temple of Olympian Zeus came to completion.\n\nThe result was no less than stunning, complete with 104 columns, a large collection of religious statues, and the famous gargantuan Chryselephantine statue of Zeus.\n\nDuring the Roman period of Athens, the Temple of Olympian Zeus was widely regarded as one of the most impressive architectural feats of the time, finally getting the glory it was destined to from centuries ago.\n\nUnfortunately, a long series of wars, invasions, and environmental catastrophes -with the most notable among them the barbarian invasion of 267 AD- left the temple in ruins.\n\nToday, only sixteen of the original columns survive, though they are more than enough for it to be considered one of the most significant archaeological monuments in Greece and one of the top attractions of Athens.\n\nOpening Hours of the Temple of Olympian Zeus\n\nThe Temple of Olympian Zeus remains open daily, both in summer and winter, allowing visitors to witness its grandeur any day they wish to.\n\nIts opening times do differ from season to season, however.\n\nThe temple is open from 8 am to 3.30 pm from November through March. The temple is open from 8 am to 7 pm from April through October.\n\nAdmission Fee for the Temple of Olympian Zeus\n\nEntrance to the Temple of Olympian Zeus is free for EU citizens up to 25 years old.\n\nFor non-EU citizens, the entrance fee is free for children up to 5 years old.\n\nThe rest of the visitors must pay a fee to enter the temple’s premises. The ticket costs €6, but there is also the option for a reduced fee of €3 for students.\n\nVisit all the must-see attractions in Athens with a skip-the-line ticket!\n\nWhat Is the Arch of Hadrian?\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian is an imposing triumphal arch constructed to celebrate Roman Emperor Hadrian’s accession and commemorate his benevolence and generosity to the city of Athens.\n\nIt remains unclear who commissioned and was responsible for designing and building the monument, yet its value as one of Athens’s most prominent archeological landmarks is undeniable.\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian has a symbolic location; it was built right between the ancient city of Athens and where Hadrian’s new city was beginning to take form.\n\nToday, Hadrian’s Arch still stands halfway between the Acropolis and the Temple of Olympian Zeus enjoying its fame as one of the top 10 attractions in Athens.\n\nThe History of the Arch of Hadrian\n\nThe construction of Hadrian’s Arch is estimated to have begun in 131 AD.\n\nThe impressive monument features large masses of Pentelic marble sculpted symmetrical to form the arch standing on top of columns with Corinthian-rhythm pilasters.\n\nThe whole design is not much different than the typical Roman arches that were common at the time.\n\nA long time after its construction, in the 18th century, Hadrian’s Arch was used as one of the seven main gates that formed a defensive wall around the city built by Turks to protect the city from raiders and pillagers.\n\nToday, the Arch of Hadrian still stands tall amidst the hustle and bustle of modern-day Athens, inviting visitors to immerse themselves in the city’s fascinating history.\n\nHow to Get to the Temple of Olympian Zeus and the Arch of Hadrian\n\nBoth the Temple of Olympian Zeus and Hadrian’s Arch boasts a very central location in the heart of Athens and are situated very close to each other.\n\nThe best way to get there is by taking the metro and getting off at Acropolis station (red line), Syntagma station (red and blue lines), or Syggroy-Fix station (red line).\n\nHowever, if you’re already downtown, you can also easily walk to the monuments from the Plaka neighborhood, Syntagma, Thission, Petralona, and the iconic Monastiraki.\n\nAddress: Temple of Olympian Zeus, Archaeological Area.
