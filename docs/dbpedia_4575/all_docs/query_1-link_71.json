        "text": "Top Things to do in Athens Greece that are Absolutely Unforgettable\n\nAthens Greece is a unique destination with a plethora of incredible things to do! Recognized as the oldest capital in Europe, Athens dates back to over 3,400 years ago and you can see that through the city’s popular landmarks.\n\nOverall, a trip to Greece is not complete without visiting Athens. From the Parthenon to the original Olympic stadium, you will be transported back to ancient Greece while enjoying modern-day luxury hotels, bars and markets during a trip to Athens.\n\nI had the opportunity to visit Greece in July 2016 with friends and cousins. Our Greece trip started in the capital city, where we enjoyed all the top things to do in Athens Greece. We then made our way to the magical islands of Santorini, Paros and Mykonos.\n\nGreece was one of my favorite destinations, and this Athens Greece travel guide will have you planning your trip in no time. Whether you take a day trip to Athens or stay for a longer time, here are the things you need to know before you visit.\n\nIn this article, discover the top things to do in Athens Greece.\n\n**Please note that this blog post uses affiliate links meaning that if you make a purchase via my affiliate link, I receive a small commission at no additional cost to you. I only promote and talk about products and services that I have used and like.\n\nPin the Below Image to Keep Handy\n\nWhen to Travel to Athens Greece:\n\nI traveled to Athens Greece at the beginning of July, which is considered to be the prime time for tourism.\n\nEven though Greece makes for the perfect year round trip, the best time to visit Athens is during the shoulder seasons. The weather is a perfect temperature then. Plus, you won’t be stuck dealing with crazy crowds in extreme heat like I did.\n\nIf you can visit Athens during April and May or September and October, you’ll find less tourists and better temperatures to explore the best things to do in Athens.\n\nI traveled to Greece by taking a flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New Jersey to Athens International Airport. The best way to get around the Greek Islands are by taking ferries. If you are traveling from Athens to Santorini, I recommend taking a short flight, since it is one of the further islands from the mainland. You can find affordable flights through Skyscanner!\n\nOverall, it isn’t necessary to rent a car during a Greece trip, unless you are planning to road trip around the mainland and other Balkan countries.\n\nWhere to Stay in Athens Greece:\n\nAthens is a beautiful metropolitan city with mountain views from every corner. When it comes to where to stay in Athens, there are plenty of options to choose from such as rental properties to high-end hotels .\n\nEven though you could find a plethora of quaint Vrbos in Athens, I highly recommend staying at a hotel with a rooftop pool so that you can relax after a day of touring and enjoy some amazing views.\n\nThere are also a plethora of budget hostels to choose from as well if you are looking for budget places to stay in Athens!\n\nThe hotel I stayed at during my time in Athens was the President Hotel. It is the perfect mid-budget hotel for your trip to Athens!\n\nHere are other great hotels to stay at in Athens based on budget:\n\nLuxury Accommodation: Four Seasons Astir Palace Hotel Athens\n\nBoutique Accommodation: Academias Hotel\n\nMid-Budget Accommodation: Ava Hotel and Suites\n\nBudget Accommodation: City Circus Athens\n\nWhat to Eat in Athens:\n\nGreek food is fresh, healthy and delicious! Throughout Athens, you’ll find amazing cafés, restaurants and bars to enjoy some traditional Greek food.\n\nBelow are my recommendations on some of the best places to eat in Athens where you can savor gyros (traditional Greek sandwiches), souvlaki (skewers), moussaka (Greek version of lasagna), dolmades (stuffed grape leaves), spanakopita (spinach pie with feta cheese) and so much more!\n\nThere are also several great restaurants in Athens’ Pláka, which is the beautiful downtown area.\n\nA for Athens Café and Cocktail Bar: Located in downtown Athens’ main square called Monastiraki, A for Athens is the perfect place to hang out with friends and savor a fresh souvlaki platter filled with pieces of meat such as chicken, lamb and beef with warm pita bread and the best olive oil.\n\nIt is also a wonderful place to grab a drink and enjoy the stunning views of the famous Greek Acropolis, Pláka neighborhood and Monastiraki Square. Don’t miss out on the Monastiraki flea market while you are there.\n\nIn addition to being a café and cocktail bar, A for Athens is also a hotel and apartment complex!\n\nKitro – Café Restaurant and Bar: Situated in the Pláka is an authentic Greek restaurant called Kitro.\n\nThis is where I had some of the best wine in Athens and also enjoyed some delicious stuffed peppers and grape leaves. I absolutely loved the ambiance at this restaurant and the owners made us feel welcomed.\n\nThe Plàka : Throughout the Pláka are several restaurants, cafés, bakeries and stands where you could grab gyros and baklava. These two foodie items are my absolute FAVORITE!\n\nDuring my time in Athens, I had to eat a delicious chicken gyro with Greece’s famous tzatziki sauce that is made with Greek yogurt and mixed with cucumbers, garlic, salt, olive oil and other freshly grown herbs. It is delicious, and you cannot go wrong with a gyro for lunch.\n\nIn addition to gyros, the baklava was out of this world! Even though baklava originated in Turkey, it is a major staple in Greek cuisine. It consists of layers of filo dough, chopped nuts as well as sugar, cinnamon and ground cloves.\n\nTop Things to Do in Athens Greece\n\nAthens Greece offers many amazing things to do from taking a step back in history to enjoying some of the more modern parts of town. Don’t miss out on the best things to do in Athens Greece when you visit.\n\nSee the Stadium of Olympia\n\nThe Stadium of Olympia is also known as the original Olympic Stadium starting from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD, the Stadium of Olympia is a site you cannot miss.\n\nIn 2004, the Summer Olympic games were held in Athens after many years. It was awesome to actually be standing in the stadium where these games have been held for centuries.\n\nThe Panathenaic Stadium became the home of the first modern Olympic games in 1896, and it is still the only stadium made completely of marble.\n\nTour the Acropolis\n\nVisiting the Acropolis is o ne of the best things to do in Athens Greece. No visit to Athens is complete without this stop, a top destination on everyone’s Athens bucket list.\n\nAfter spending some time in Olympia, we headed to the Acropolis to see the Parthenon. The Acropolis is one historical site you cannot miss when visiting Athens!\n\nSince Greece barely gets rain throughout the year, the atmosphere is very desert-like. Make sure that if you are visiting during the summer, like I did, that you wear light clothing and keep yourself hydrated, as it is very hot and dry at the top.\n\nLuckily, the day we went, the weather was very windy, so we were comfortable and able to enjoy the archeological sites without suffering in the heat.\n\nWhen you walk up the steps, you enter the Propylaea, which is the entrance that was completed in 432 BC, just before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian wars.\n\nDon’t miss out on the view of the Odeon of Herodes Atticus on your way up. This ancient Greek open-air theater is at the base of the Acropolis, but you can enjoy a view of it as you make your way to the top.\n\nOnce you enter, you can see the Pinacotheca (picture gallery) and a Hellenistic pedestal. On the right, is the tiny temple of Nike Athena, which commemorates the Athenians’ victory over the Persians.\n\nThe main archeological site to see while you are at the Acropolis is the famous Parthenon that was built by Pericles in the 5th century BC as a monument to recognize Athens’ political and cultural achievements.\n\nBeing in front of the Parthenon was surreal for me. It felt like my middle and high school history books came to life! If you are visiting the Acropolis with kids, discover what you cannot miss!\n\nAnother great site to see when visiting the Acropolis is the Erectheion. It sits on the most sacred site there – where Poseidon and Athena had their contest over who would be the Patron of the City.\n\nIt is also a MUST to go over by the Greek flag in the northeast corner of the Acropolis. This is where you can catch the best views of Athens and take great pictures.\n\nAcropolis means the upper city. Many of the city-states from Ancient Greece were built around the Acropolis. It was a place where people were able to escape to in times of invasion.\n\nThe most sacred and important buildings were built usually on or around the Acropolis during ancient times. The Acropolis is a must see if you are looking for historical places to visit in Athens.\n\nYou can also visit the new Acropolis Museum to see what all has been found over the years on this famous landmark.\n\nDiscover the Ancient Agora and Temple of Hephaestus\n\nWhen you finish up at the Acropolis, take time to walk through the ancient agora. Stop to visit the best preserved of the temples, the Temple of Hephaestus. You’ll be walking in the footsteps of Sophocles and Socrates when you take a stroll here.\n\nHephaestus was the God of fire and blacksmiths. His temple still stands tall among the ruble of other ancient buildings, making it worth a visit.\n\nThe restored Stoa of Attalos is also located here. While the original was destroyed back in AD 267, it was restored in the 1950s. Now it houses a museum and artifacts discovered there.\n\nWalk Through the Pláka\n\nAnother one of the top things to do in Athens Greece is explore the hidden gems in the downtown area of the city.\n\nThe Pláka in Athens offers a wonderful European ambiance. The locals are very friendly and accommodating. All of the tiled buildings feature warm colors and beautiful flowers hanging from their stucco walls. The shops have items you cannot find anywhere else and the restaurants are authentic and comforting.\n\nSome specialties that you could find in the Pláka are handcrafted jewelry with rich stones found in the surrounding Mediterranean and Aegean Seas. I bought a ring with an orange stone from the Mediterranean that I wear almost every day.\n\nAnother specialty in Greece is olive oil. Not only could you buy bottles of olive oil for cooking purposes; you could also purchase different soaps that make your skin nice and soft. I purchased a bar of soap that I used to take a bath with. It made my skin feel great!\n\nAdmire the Temple of Olympian Zeus and Arch of Hadrian\n\nMake time to visit the Olympieion. This is where you’ll find the Temple of Olympian Zeus and the Arch of Hadrian among the modern buildings and busy streets of Athens.\n\nThese ruins are within walking distance of the Acropolis and Syntagma Square. Seeing the columns standing tall make it worth a trip.\n\nWatch the Sunset at Mars Hill\n\nOut of all of the places I have been to, Greece has the best sunsets! Not only did I experience some epic sunsets on the islands, but I also got to see a great one during my time in Athens.\n\nBefore dinner one night, we stopped at Areopagus, which is also known as Mars Hill. This area is famous for a few reasons: in the Bible, the Apostle Paul delivered his famous speech there about the identity of “the unknown God” (according to the Biblical account in Acts 17.)\n\nDuring pre-classical times, it was the council of elders of the city and in classical times, it functioned as the chief homicide court of Athens.\n\nAccording to Greek mythology, Ares (the god of war, known to the Romans as Mars) was tried here (by the gods) for the murder of Poseidon’s son.\n\nThe Areopagus is located across from the Acropolis. We climbed up the marble hill where we watched the sun setting over the gorgeous ancient city.\n\nPlease make note that when visiting Mars Hill to wear comfortable shoes. I was wearing flat sandals and had a tough time climbing up and down the hill. It is extremely slippery from so many people climbing it over the years.\n\nWhen you are at the top, please watch your step, as it is easy to fall on the marble. Overall though, this is one of the most famous Biblical places in Athens, but it is also worth a visit just for the sunset views.\n\nVisit the National Archeological Museum\n\nThe National Archeological Museum in Athens is the biggest archeological museum in Greece. If you need something to do on a rainy day in Athens or just want to escape the heat in mid-summer, you can escape to a history-lovers dream.\n\nYou can easily spend a full day wandering the museum and looking at the historical art and artifacts collected there.\n\nDon’t miss out on seeing the Mask of Agamemnon, the bronze statue of Zeus (or Poseidon depending on which side of the debate you take), the marble statue of Poseidon (no debate on this one), the portrait head of Roman Emporer Hadrian, and the Horse and Jockey.\n\nEnjoy the Nightlife\n\nIn addition to food, historical sites and culture of Athens, the city also offers a fun nightlife! Here are two of my favorite places to party in the ancient city:\n\n360 Cocktail Bar: This fancy bar and restaurant offers a gorgeous rooftop view of Athens. You will seriously feel like you are on top of the world at this place!\n\nTo top it off, 360 Cocktail Bar provides some of the best drink options in the city.

It is absolutely adorable.\n\nLooking for even more of the best things to do in Athens?\n\nThe Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center – Take a tour, enjoy the park, or watch the Dancing Fountains at the Canal. The Greek National Opera is also located here.\n\nAthens Central Market or The Dimotiki Agora – Located on Athinas Street, this spot is an easy walk from most of downtown Athens. Wear shoes you don’t mind getting dirty as you walk around and enjoy the local food. The market is mostly closed down on Sundays.\n\nAthens Food Tour – If you are a foodie, consider taking an Athens food tour. This will let you really get a taste of the local food.\n\nSyntagma Square – Located in the heart of Athens, Syntagma Square or Constitution Square is where you’ll also find the Hellenic Parliament Building including the Tome of the Unknown Soldier. The National Garden is also here if you want to enjoy a beautiful walk. There is also lots of shopping nearby and the famous Hotel Grand Bretagne, a favorite of celebrities.\n\nLycabettus Hill – The highest point in Athens offers a challenging climb, especially in the heat of summer. You can also take a funicular to the top for a spectacular sunset view. On the top of the hill is the church of Agios Georgios, a cafe that serves breakfast and lunch, and a restaurant called Orizontes that serves dinner (reservations required).\n\nNow that You Know of the Best Things to do in Athens Greece:\n\nNow that you have the best things to do in Athens Greece, don’t miss these other Greek tips:\n\nThe Complete Guide to Paros Greece\n\nSantorini Bucket List Experiences\n\nBest Things to Do in Mykonos for Party-Lovers\n\nClick here to book a cooking class in Athens.\n\nPlanning an epic European vacation?

Recognized as the oldest capital in Europe, Athens dates back to over 3,400 years ago and you can see that through the city’s popular landmarks.\n\nOverall, a trip to Greece is not complete without visiting Athens. From the Parthenon to the original Olympic stadium, you will be transported back to ancient Greece while enjoying modern-day luxury hotels, bars and markets during a trip to Athens.\n\nI had the opportunity to visit Greece in July 2016 with friends and cousins. Our Greece trip started in the capital city, where we enjoyed all the top things to do in Athens Greece. We then made our way to the magical islands of Santorini, Paros and Mykonos.\n\nGreece was one of my favorite destinations, and this Athens Greece travel guide will have you planning your trip in no time.

The weather is a perfect temperature then. Plus, you won’t be stuck dealing with crazy crowds in extreme heat like I did.\n\nIf you can visit Athens during April and May or September and October, you’ll find less tourists and better temperatures to explore the best things to do in Athens.\n\nI traveled to Greece by taking a flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New Jersey to Athens International Airport. The best way to get around the Greek Islands are by taking ferries. If you are traveling from Athens to Santorini, I recommend taking a short flight, since it is one of the further islands from the mainland. You can find affordable flights through Skyscanner!\n\nOverall, it isn’t necessary to rent a car during a Greece trip, unless you are planning to road trip around the mainland and other Balkan countries.\n\nWhere to Stay in Athens Greece:\n\nAthens is a beautiful metropolitan city with mountain views from every corner. When it comes to where to stay in Athens, there are plenty of options to choose from such as rental properties to high-end hotels .\n\nEven though you could find a plethora of quaint Vrbos in Athens, I highly recommend staying at a hotel with a rooftop pool so that you can relax after a day of touring and enjoy some amazing views.\n\nThere are also a plethora of budget hostels to choose from as well if you are looking for budget places to stay in Athens!\n\nThe hotel I stayed at during my time in Athens was the President Hotel. It is the perfect mid-budget hotel for your trip to Athens!\n\nHere are other great hotels to stay at in Athens based on budget:\n\nLuxury Accommodation: Four Seasons Astir Palace Hotel Athens\n\nBoutique Accommodation: Academias Hotel\n\nMid-Budget Accommodation: Ava Hotel and Suites\n\nBudget Accommodation: City Circus Athens\n\nWhat to Eat in Athens:\n\nGreek food is fresh, healthy and delicious! Throughout Athens, you’ll find amazing cafés, restaurants and bars to enjoy some traditional Greek food.\n\nBelow are my recommendations on some of the best places to eat in Athens where you can savor gyros (traditional Greek sandwiches), souvlaki (skewers), moussaka (Greek version of lasagna), dolmades (stuffed grape leaves), spanakopita (spinach pie with feta cheese) and so much more!\n\nThere are also several great restaurants in Athens’ Pláka, which is the beautiful downtown area.\n\nA for Athens Café and Cocktail Bar: Located in downtown Athens’ main square called Monastiraki, A for Athens is the perfect place to hang out with friends and savor a fresh souvlaki platter filled with pieces of meat such as chicken, lamb and beef with warm pita bread and the best olive oil.\n\nIt is also a wonderful place to grab a drink and enjoy the stunning views of the famous Greek Acropolis, Pláka neighborhood and Monastiraki Square. Don’t miss out on the Monastiraki flea market while you are there.\n\nIn addition to being a café and cocktail bar, A for Athens is also a hotel and apartment complex!\n\nKitro – Café Restaurant and Bar: Situated in the Pláka is an authentic Greek restaurant called Kitro.\n\nThis is where I had some of the best wine in Athens and also enjoyed some delicious stuffed peppers and grape leaves. I absolutely loved the ambiance at this restaurant and the owners made us feel welcomed.\n\nThe Plàka : Throughout the Pláka are several restaurants, cafés, bakeries and stands where you could grab gyros and baklava. These two foodie items are my absolute FAVORITE!\n\nDuring my time in Athens, I had to eat a delicious chicken gyro with Greece’s famous tzatziki sauce that is made with Greek yogurt and mixed with cucumbers, garlic, salt, olive oil and other freshly grown herbs. It is delicious, and you cannot go wrong with a gyro for lunch.\n\nIn addition to gyros, the baklava was out of this world! Even though baklava originated in Turkey, it is a major staple in Greek cuisine. It consists of layers of filo dough, chopped nuts as well as sugar, cinnamon and ground cloves.\n\nTop Things to Do in Athens Greece\n\nAthens Greece offers many amazing things to do from taking a step back in history to enjoying some of the more modern parts of town. Don’t miss out on the best things to do in Athens Greece when you visit.\n\nSee the Stadium of Olympia\n\nThe Stadium of Olympia is also known as the original Olympic Stadium starting from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD, the Stadium of Olympia is a site you cannot miss.\n\nIn 2004, the Summer Olympic games were held in Athens after many years. It was awesome to actually be standing in the stadium where these games have been held for centuries.\n\nThe Panathenaic Stadium became the home of the first modern Olympic games in 1896, and it is still the only stadium made completely of marble.\n\nTour the Acropolis\n\nVisiting the Acropolis is o ne of the best things to do in Athens Greece. No visit to Athens is complete without this stop, a top destination on everyone’s Athens bucket list.\n\nAfter spending some time in Olympia, we headed to the Acropolis to see the Parthenon. The Acropolis is one historical site you cannot miss when visiting Athens!\n\nSince Greece barely gets rain throughout the year, the atmosphere is very desert-like. Make sure that if you are visiting during the summer, like I did, that you wear light clothing and keep yourself hydrated, as it is very hot and dry at the top.\n\nLuckily, the day we went, the weather was very windy, so we were comfortable and able to enjoy the archeological sites without suffering in the heat.\n\nWhen you walk up the steps, you enter the Propylaea, which is the entrance that was completed in 432 BC, just before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian wars.\n\nDon’t miss out on the view of the Odeon of Herodes Atticus on your way up. This ancient Greek open-air theater is at the base of the Acropolis, but you can enjoy a view of it as you make your way to the top.\n\nOnce you enter, you can see the Pinacotheca (picture gallery) and a Hellenistic pedestal. On the right, is the tiny temple of Nike Athena, which commemorates the Athenians’ victory over the Persians.\n\nThe main archeological site to see while you are at the Acropolis is the famous Parthenon that was built by Pericles in the 5th century BC as a monument to recognize Athens’ political and cultural achievements.\n\nBeing in front of the Parthenon was surreal for me. It felt like my middle and high school history books came to life! If you are visiting the Acropolis with kids, discover what you cannot miss!\n\nAnother great site to see when visiting the Acropolis is the Erectheion. It sits on the most sacred site there – where Poseidon and Athena had their contest over who would be the Patron of the City.\n\nIt is also a MUST to go over by the Greek flag in the northeast corner of the Acropolis. This is where you can catch the best views of Athens and take great pictures.\n\nAcropolis means the upper city. Many of the city-states from Ancient Greece were built around the Acropolis. It was a place where people were able to escape to in times of invasion.\n\nThe most sacred and important buildings were built usually on or around the Acropolis during ancient times. The Acropolis is a must see if you are looking for historical places to visit in Athens.\n\nYou can also visit the new Acropolis Museum to see what all has been found over the years on this famous landmark.\n\nDiscover the Ancient Agora and Temple of Hephaestus\n\nWhen you finish up at the Acropolis, take time to walk through the ancient agora. Stop to visit the best preserved of the temples, the Temple of Hephaestus. You’ll be walking in the footsteps of Sophocles and Socrates when you take a stroll here.\n\nHephaestus was the God of fire and blacksmiths. His temple still stands tall among the ruble of other ancient buildings, making it worth a visit.\n\nThe restored Stoa of Attalos is also located here. While the original was destroyed back in AD 267, it was restored in the 1950s. Now it houses a museum and artifacts discovered there.\n\nWalk Through the Pláka\n\nAnother one of the top things to do in Athens Greece is explore the hidden gems in the downtown area of the city.\n\nThe Pláka in Athens offers a wonderful European ambiance. The locals are very friendly and accommodating. All of the tiled buildings feature warm colors and beautiful flowers hanging from their stucco walls.
