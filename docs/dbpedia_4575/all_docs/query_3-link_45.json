        "text": "5-Day Percy Jackson Mythology Trip\n\nDon’t miss spending some time getting lost in the Plaka and Psirri district's small pedestrian alleyways, lined with lovely bougainvillea-draped buildings, mezedopoleia, and pleasant local taverns.\n\nLet’s now see the major landmarks, historical temples, and cool monuments of Athens!\n\nThe Acropolis and the Parthenon\n\nVisiting the Acropolis' rock is like going back in time. The site is home to the most important mythical legends and is the ideal location for a mythology tour in order to learn about the thinking of the people who built this one-of-a-kind monument.\n\nThe magnificent Parthenon, one of the most visited attractions in the world, is in the centre of Athens. The Parthenon is a symbol of Greece, Democracy, and all of the principles that the Ancient Greek civilization embodied.\n\nHowever, the temple of Athena and the Parthenon are not the only important landmarks on the Acropolis. The Erechtheion with the famous Caryatids, the Temple of Athena Nike, and the majestic Propylaea are just a few of the many impressive structures on the site.\n\nThe Porch of the Caryatids, with six sculptures of maidens in place of Doric columns, is the most famous element of the Erechtheion complex.\n\nThe Temple of Athena Nike near the entrance and the Erechtheion, a complex of ancient sanctuaries built between 421 and 395 BC, are two more remains on the Acropolis.\n\nThe view from the top of Acropolis Hill is equally impressive. The entire city of Athens lies at your feet, but you feel as if you're in another world, traveling back in ancient times. The pedestrian street of Apostolou Pavlou is lined with restaurants that look out to the Acropolis.\n\nCombining your visit to the Acropolis site with a tour of the renovated Museum at the base of the Hill will provide you with a more comprehensive experience. The museum houses all of the objects discovered during the excavations on Acropolis, and it will help you better comprehend the importance of the Acropolis in the lives of the ancient Greeks.\n\nKeep in mind that on hot days, it's better to visit the Acropolis in the morning and then spend the afternoon at the air-conditioned Acropolis Museum. Alternatively, you can go to the Acropolis to see the sunset!\n\nAcropolis, Athens - credits:sborisov/depositphotos\n\nThe Areopagus (Hill of Ares)\n\nLet’s explore a bit of mythology about the famous Hill of Ares. In the past, the gods are claimed to have tried Ares here for the murder of Alirrothios, one of Poseidon's sons. The trial of Orestes, who was accused of murdering his mother Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus, is also claimed to have taken place here.\n\nThe Areopagus was the meeting place for the city's elder council in preclassical times. The members of the council were those who had positions of power in the government. Note that during the Persian siege of the Acropolis in 480 BC, the hill was utilized as an encampment by the Persians.\n\nToday, there are no temple ruins on this hill for visitors to see. There are a few foundation incisions in the rock, but nothing else. The hill, on the other hand, provides a spectacular view of the city, particularly the Ancient Agora, which is right underneath it.\n\nOnce you've reached the top, be cautious when strolling around, especially near the sides, as they’re steep, and there are no barriers or protection around the edges to prevent you from entirely going over. If you have small children, it is usually best not to take them up with you.\n\nPnyx, Athens - credits:26101962costas/depositphotos\n\nTheatre of Herodes Atticus\n\nThe ancient amphitheater of Herodion, also known as the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, was built at the base of the Acropolis and is now one of the best sites to see a live classical theatre performance.\n\nHerodes Atticus, a Roman philosopher, teacher, and statesman, constructed this antique theater around 161 A.D. It was constructed in honor of his wife Aspasia Regilla, who died in the year 160 AD.\n\nThe magnificent Odeon of Herodes Atticus was the final monumental edifice completed in the Acropolis area throughout antiquity. When you visit this monument, you will notice niches on the walls that were once used to contain statues but are now empty. It's on Dionysiou Areopagitou Street, and it's impossible to miss if you're visiting the Acropolis.\n\nIf you're in Athens during the summer when the Odeon is hosting a live performance, don't miss it! Seeing a play in this old odeon while standing beneath the illuminated Acropolis is simply stunning.\n\nTheatre of Herodus Atticus - credits:bloodua/depositphotos\n\nFilopappou Hill\n\nFilopappou Hill, to the southwest of the Acropolis, is Athenians' favorite promenade, with spectacular views of the Acropolis, the entire city of Athens, and the Aegean Sea that surrounds Attica!\n\nThe marble for Philopappos' funerary monument came from Mount Pentelikon and Mount Ymittos, which are located southeast of Athens. A stone structure with iron gates is close to the monument but hidden from view. Also, in the Filopappou area is the prison where the great Greek philosopher Socrates was imprisoned and killed.\n\nFrom Philopappou, a paved walkway leads to Pnyx Hill, where the finest orators of Greek antiquity gathered to discuss political matters. The Dora Stratou theatre, on the other side of the hill, features folklore dancing events. Lastly, the National Observatory, a scientific facility for the study of astronomy and seismology, as well as the church of Agia Marina, are both located near Philopappou.\n\nFipopappou Hill, Athens - credits:karnizz/depositphotos\n\nThe Ancient Agora and the Stoa of Attalos\n\nIn ancient Athens, the Agora was the marketplace and the heart of daily life. The Greek word \"Agora\" means \"to gather and orate,\" implying that this was a public speaking area. There were also athletic activities and theater performances held there.\n\nThe north gate off Adrianou Street is the finest place to enter the Agora, near the Church of Apostle Philip. And, in order to get a glimpse into the lives of ancient Athens' diverse inhabitants, stroll around the Agora and visit the Stoa of Attalos, a 2nd century BC \"shopping mall,\" which displays signs of the Athenians everyday activities.\n\nThe Stoa of Attalos, established by King Attalos II and restored in the 1950s, is one of the most outstanding elements of the Ancient Agora. In 399 BC, the stoa may have been the site of Socrates' trial.\n\nConsider visiting the Stoa of Attalos Archaeological Museum which houses artifacts discovered at the Ancient Agora's archaeological site. Marble statues, portions of columns, coins, ceramic vases, everyday goods, and other artifacts dating from the Neolithic period to the 6th century AD are among the discoveries.\n\nLastly, don’t miss heading to the north wall of the Acropolis or the roadways from the Areopagus for a spectacular view of the Agora from afar.\n\nStoa of Attalos, Ancient Agora, Athens - credits:davidzfr/depositphotos\n\nThe Temple of Hephaestus\n\nThe awe-inspiring Temple of Hephaestus is another important landmark of Athens. The temple, which is a classic example of Dorian architecture, was built approximately 450 B.C. on the western side of the city, on top of Agoreos Koronos hill, according to archeologists.\n\nThe temple was designed by Ictinus, a skilled architect who previously worked on the Parthenon, but many other craftsmen contributed to this magnificent structure. It is made of Pentelic marble, and the statues are made of Parian marble. A cella, pronaos, and the opisthodomos are all present and the temple is surrounded by columns, which encircle the enclosed cella. Friezes can be found on both of them.\n\nThe temple stands in Thissio, directly above the Ancient Agora and the Stoa of Attalos, and is close to the Acropolis and Monastiraki.\n\nNote that the conversion of this fifth-century BC Doric temple into a Christian church protected it from destruction, making it one of the best-preserved ancient Greek temples.\n\nTemple of Hephaeustus, Ancient Agora, Athens - credits:pajche/depositphotos\n\nTemple of Olympian Zeus\n\nIn Greek antiquity, this enormous temple was a shrine to Zeus, a structure that housed his worshipped statue rather than a place of worship for believers, as it is in the Christian world.\n\nFor sacrifice and worship, the devotees used to congregate in the surrounding area outside the temple, where there was also an altar. Only 16 of the original 104 gigantic columns remain today, yet they are enough to dominate the space and make you feel small if you stand next to them."
