        "text": "The Temple\n\nThe Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens was once a large temple in Athens with impressive columns. The temple is named after the God Zeus who was the ruler of the Olympian Gods. We visited here in October of 2019.\n\nToday, only 16 of the 104 massive columns remain yet the remains are still impressive and with a little imagination you can envision how the grand temple may have looked. Construction of the temple of Zeus began in the 6th century BC and was finished in the 2nd century AD. The Temple of Zeus is the largest Greek temple, larger than the Parthenon. Inside the temple, at one time, was a gold and ivory statue of Zeus.\n\nThe marble columns are indeed impressive, standing at 55 ft 9 in (17m) tall and 6 ft 7 in (2m) wide. On the top of the columns you can see beautiful carvings.\n\nLocation of The Temple of Olympian Zeus\n\nLocated in downtown Athens, the Temple of Olympian Zeus is easy to find. It is located close to many of the other ancient sites, including the Acropolis, Hadrian’s Arch, and some Roman baths. The entrance cost is nominal and and you get good views of the Acropolis and Hadrian’s Arch, although you can see one side of Hadrian’s Arch from the street. I felt it was well worth the money as there were a lot of good views and angles that you can’t see from behind the fence.\n\nHadrian’s Arch\n\nHadrian’s Arch is a magnificent monument that looks like a gateway with window’s on top. This Arch is in Honor of the Roman Emperor, Hadrian and constructed around 131-132 AD. My research shows the arch separated two cities, Hadrian, and Thesseus, or possibly separated new Athens from old Athens. I have read that on the one side of the arch it states, “This is Athens the old city of Thesseus“ on the opposite side it states, “This is the city of Hadrian and not Thesseus“. Although this may be true, I wasn’t able to find where it was written. The arch is a favorite landmark of mine because each time we became lost we seemed to end up here!\n\nRoman Baths\n\nThe Roman Date from 124-131 AD and are located within the fenced area of The Olympian Temple of Zeus. These are one of many Roman Bath’s areas around Greece.\n\nEven More Beautiful at Night\n\nPlanning\n\nLast year when we were in Athens we used the Rick Steves Pocket Athens guidebook w and found a lot of useful information in it. There is also a pocket map.\n\nThis year we added Top 10 Athens (DK Eyewitness Travel Guide) to help us plan and found it extremely helpful and organized. It includes top 10 places for restaurants, things to see, shopping, etc. It also divides into top 10 of each area. This is my favorite guide book. It does come with a pocket map.\n\nWe also bought an Athens Street Map which was more in-depth and very useful as we explored more areas on this trip.\n\nFollow me on Instagram!!!!\n\nYou can check out my other Athens posts by following these links!\n\nFive Great Places to Eat in Plaka, Athens, Sept/Oct 2019\n\nAnafiotika in Plaka, Athens, October 2019\n\nThe Temple of Hephaestus and Ancient Agora, October 2019\n\nSunrise from Lycabettus Hill, October 2019\n\nSunrise From Philopappos Hill, September 2019\n\nArriving in Athens on our Anniversary, September 2019\n\nThe Acropolis and Parthenon, October 2018\n\nA Rainy Day in Athens, September 2018\n\nDiary of a Gen-X Traveler contains affiliate links, including Amazon.
