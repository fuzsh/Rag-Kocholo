        "text": "Boasting a history of 2,500 years with monuments incorporated into the modern city, coupled with world class museums and a vibrant contemporary cultural life, Athens is a very attractive destination. The establishment of Athens as a city date back to mythological times. Despite the length of the city’s history, it is still evident throughout Athens in the form of many ancient, Roman, Byzantine and Modern monuments.\n\nA center for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato’s Academy and Aristotle’s Lyceum, Athens was also the birthplace of Socrates, Pericles, Sophocles and its many other prominent philosophers, writers and politicians of the ancient world. It is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely due to the impact of its cultural and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. on the rest of the, then known, European continent.\n\nThe heritage of the classical era is still evident in the city, represented by a number of ancient monuments and works of art, the most famous of all being the Parthenon on the Acropolis, widely considered a key landmark of early Western civilization. The city also retains a vast variety of Roman and Byzantine monuments, as well as a smaller number of remaining Ottoman monuments projecting the city’s long history across the centuries.\n\nLandmarks of the modern era are also present, dating back to 1830 (the establishment of the independent Greek state), and taking in the Greek Parliament (19th century) and the Athens Trilogy (Library, University, and Academy).\n\nAthens was the host city of the first modern-day Olympic Games in 1896. Having hosted the 2004 Olympic Games, Athens can evidently meet the requirements of the most demanding of events, always delivering an impeccable result.\n\nToday’s capital is a result of integration of ancient and medieval history into the contemporary era.\n\nHadrian’s Arch and the Temple of Olympian Zeus\n\nBefore starting the climb to reach the Parthenon, it is impossible to miss a monument as impressive as Hadrian’s Arch. Located in the city center of Athens, just away from the Acropolis and Syntagma square, has been a distinctive Athenian landmark since time immemorial. Refers to the remnants of an ancient colossal temple that was dedicated to Zeus, the patriarch figure of all Olympian Gods and the ruler of Mount Olympus.\n\nConstructed in 131 A.D. by the Roman Emperor, it was created to form an entrance for the new city and separate it from the old one. On the side of the monument facing the Acropolis one can see the inscription “This is Athens, the former city of Theseus” while on the other side the inscription “This is the city of Hadrian and not of Theseus.\n\nBehind Hadrian’s Arch, stands the captivating temple of Olympian Zeus. Τhe construction of the building began in the 6th century by Peisistratus to finally be completed 100 years later, in 131 BC., by the emperor Hadrian.\n\nOriginally it consisted of 104 Corinthian columns of which only 15 remain standing today. Inside the temple, Hadrian built an enormous gold and ivory statue of Zeus and an equal one of himself. To this day we do not know when the temple was destroyed but like many other large buildings in Greece, it is possible that it was brought down by an earthquake during the mediaeval period and the ruins sold for other building materials.\n\nHerodes Atticus Theater\n\nOne of the legendary sites seated beneath the slopes of the Acropolis, on the southwest side. A stunning open-air theatre be described as “the finest building of its type”.\n\nThe ancient amphitheater of Herodeion, also known as the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, is one of the best places to experience a live classical theater performance. This ancient theater was built in the Roman times, in about 161 A.D. by the Roman philosopher, teacher and politician Herodes Atticus. It was built in the memory of his wife Aspasia Regilla who died in 160 A.D.\n\nIn 1950’s the city decided to fully reconstruct the venue before its grand opening in 1955 as the prime location for the Athens and Epidaurus Festival. Today remains one of the festival’s main venues. From the majestic ballets and arias, to ancient Greek tragedies, witnessing a performance here is one you’re unlikely to forget.\n\nThe Acropolis Museum\n\nThe Acropolis Museum was founded in 2003 and completed in 2007 after decades of being born as an idea, as a place that would accommodate the missing Parthenon sculptures. Today it is focused on the findings of the archaeological site of the Acropolis of Athens. The museum was built to host every artifact found on the rock and on the surrounding slopes, from the Greek Bronze Age to Roman and Byzantine Greece. It also lies over the ruins of a part of Roman and early Byzantine Athens.\n\nClick here for the Acropolis Museum website.\n\nShopping\n\nThe best place for high end shopping in the city with all the big fashion names is Kolonaki. However, the most well-known shopping street in Athens is Ermou Street. It is a pedestrian road full of famous brands and shops leading to the ultimate street shopping place of Monastiraki. It is situated around the Acropolis and offers a unique environment, where you may walk on the old cobblestone roads and visit the traditional flea market and bazaar. One can find all kinds of products there from clothes, shoes, cosmetics, jewelry, and bags to even decorating items. There are multiple coffee shops around the area offering a full evening experience.\n\nGreek Gastronomy\n\nGreek gastronomy has recorded a history of around 4,000 years, with especial characteristics based on pure and unique quality goods produced on Greek soil. In fact, it was Archestratos who wrote the first cookbook in history (330 B.C.). In truth Greek cuisine has four secrets: good quality fresh ingredients, correct use of flavorings (herbs) and spices, the famous Greek olive oil and simplicity. Olive oil, honey, salt and cheese may be the signature tastes one remembers after having a meal here but there are many more ways to impress your palette and satisfy your cravings. Due to the ever-generous Mediterranean Sea, a Greek table is almost never complete without various delicious fresh fish.\n\nFinally, when it comes to drinking, wine has been imbedded in the Greek culture since the ancient times and is still taken and drunk very seriously by Greeks today as there are hundreds of wineries around the country and countless wine bars in all cities and islands. Other famous Greek drinks include Ouzo, Raki and the mysterious Mastic that can only be produced in one island in Greece as the plants of its origin are unable to grow successfully anywhere else in the entire world for reasons still unknown to this day."
