During the summer months the Roman Agora is open every day between 8 am and 8 pm (last admission at 7:30 pm). On the following days it is completely closed: January 1st, March 25th, May 1st, Easter Sunday, December 25th and December 26th\n\nCost of admission: 6 euros in peak season (April 1st to October 31st), 3 euros in off-peak season (November 1st to March 31st)\n\nFree Admission Days: March 6, April 18, May 18, Last Weekend of September, October 28, Every First Sunday from November 1st to March 31st\n\nDirections: Closest subway station is Monastiraki\n\nThe Roman Agora, also known as the Roman Forum, was built between 19 and 11 B.C. by donations from Julius Caesar and Augustus. The Roman Agora is a large courtyard that the town was built and surrounded by. It consisted of stores and commercial buildings. One of the highlights of the ruins is the Tower of the Winds which is an octagonal tower that is surprisingly still very intact and has some great carvings.\n\nOne of the other monuments that’s still standing and is great is the Gate of Athena Archegetis. It’s the entrance way with the four large columns (pictured below).\n\nHadrian’s Library\n\nHours: During the winter months Hadrian’s Library is open every day between 8 am and 5 pm (last admission is 4:30 pm). During the summer months Hadrian’s Library is open every day between 8 am and 8 pm (last admission at 7:30 pm). On the following days it is completely closed: January 1st, March 25th, May 1st, Easter Sunday, December 25th and December 26th\n\nCost of admission: 4 euros in peak season (April 1st to October 31st), 2 euros in off-peak season (November 1st to March 31st). Part of the combination ticket (see above)\n\nDirections: The closest subway station is Monastiraki\n\nHadrian’s Library was built in AD 132 by, you guessed it, emperor Hadrian. It was destroyed in AD 267 but was then repaired in AD 412. The site contains a number of different buildings that are surprisingly intact. The most important of these are the Quatrefoil Building, the Megale Panaghia Church and the ruins of another church. The Quatrefoil Building is the building with the four columns you can see below.\n\nKerameikos\n\nHours: During the winter months (Jan 1, 2019 to April 12, 2019) Kerameikos is open every day between 8:30 am and 4 pm (last admission is 3:45 pm). During the summer months (April 13, 2019 to October 31, 2019) Kerameikos is open every day between 8 am and 8 pm (last admission at 7:45 pm). On the following days it is completely closed: January 1st, March 25th, May 1st, Easter Sunday, December 25th and December 26th\n\nCost of admission: 8 euros in peak season (April 1st to October 31st), 4 euros in off-peak season (November 1st to March 31st). Part of the combination ticket (see above)\n\nDirections: The closest subway station is Thissio or Kerameikos\n\nKerameikos is an ancient part of one of the largest political divisions in Athens. It was where a lot of potters and vase painters settled and eventually became the main center of production of vases which you most likely have seen in museums across the world.\n\nDue to overflowing of the nearby river, the area was converted into a cemetery and ultimately became one of the most important cemeteries in the ancient times. The earliest tombs at the cemetery date back to the early Bronze age!\n\nThe Kerameikos site also includes admission to the Kerameikos Museum which is a nice break from walking around in the heat since it’s air conditioned! It’s a one story museum but there are multiple rooms where the items are displayed chronologically but they’re also sorted by their subject. The museum has been around since 1937\n\nAncient Agora\n\nHours: During the winter months the Ancient Agora is open every day between 8 am and 5 pm (last admission is 4:30 pm). During the summer months the Ancient Agora is open every day between 8 am and 8 pm (last admission at 7:30 pm). On the following days it is completely closed: January 1st, March 25th, May 1st, Easter Sunday, December 25th and December 26th\n\nCost of admission: 8 euros in peak season (April 1st to October 31st), 4 euros in off-peak season (November 1st to March 31st). Part of the combination ticket (see above)\n\nDirections: The closest subway stations are Thiseio or Monastiraki\n\nThe Ancient Agora was essentially the hub of old Athens. It was a market place selling food and household goods but it was also the center of the city for politics and law. It also had the main road of the town going through it which lead directly to the Acropolis.\n\nThe Ancient Agora has a number of buildings to explore and next to the Acropolis this is probably one of the biggest sites so you’d want to dedicate at least a couple of hours here. On top of the hill you’ll find the Temple of Hephaestus which is incredibly well preserved because it used to function as a church.\n\nIn the reconstructed Stoa of Attalos, the building with the white smaller columns, you’ll find the museum of the Ancient Agora. There are a number of artifacts, statues and mini buildings of what the area used to look like.\n\nThe Ancient Agora does spread out a bit so there is some walking here but if you walk up to the hill with the Temple of Hephaestus you’re in for an excellent viewpoint of the Acropolis!\n\nOlympieon\n\nHours: During the winter months the Olympieio is open every day between 8 am and 5 pm (last admission is 4:30 pm). During the summer months the Olympieio is open every day between 8 am and 8 pm (last admission at 7:30 pm). On the following days it is completely closed: January 1st, March 25th, May 1st, Easter Sunday, December 25th and December 26th\n\nCost of admission: 6 euros in peak season (April 1st to October 31st), 3 euros in off-peak season (November 1st to March 31st). Part of the combination ticket (see above)\n\nDirections: The closest subway station is the Acropolis subway station\n\nThe Olympieon is often confused with the Temple of Olympian Zeus because it’s one of the biggest attractions to see at the Olympieon but in addition to the Temple of Olympian Zeus there are also other remains of Roman baths, classical residences, a basilica, part of the old fortification wall and other temples of smaller scale!\n\nThe Temple of Olympian Zeus is incredibly big and the obvious highlight here. It’s hard to comprehend how big it is through pictures alone but you can look at the picture below for scale to kind of see what I’m talking about. The columns are super impressive in size but also in the details on them. There were originally 3 rows of 8 columns (for a total of 24 columns) but only 16 remain. The temple used to house gold and ivory statue of Zeus in addition a statue of the emperor.\n\nWhile not an official ruins in the sense that it requires a ticket, the Arch of Hadrian is a great left over architectural feat and one 100% worth checking out while you’re in the area to see the Temple of Olympius Zeus. It’s located just outside of the ruins and right on the street!\n\nThe Archaeological Site of Lykeion\n\nHours: During the winter months the Archaeological Site of Lykeion is open every day between 8 am and 5 pm (last admission is 4:30 pm). During the summer months the Archaeological Site of Lykeion is open every day between 8 am and 8 pm (last admission at 7:30 pm). On the following days it is completely closed: January 1st, March 25th, May 1st, Easter Sunday, December 25th and December 26th\n\nCost of admission: 4 euros in peak season (April 1st to October 31st), 2 euros in off-peak season (November 1st to March 31st). Part of the combination ticket (see above)\n\nDirections: Closest subway station is Evangelismos station but you can access it using bus and tram lines as well (check with your hotel for exact lines)\n\nThe Archaeological Site of Lykeion is the site of an ancient gymnasium that was the site of Aristotle’s School of Philosophy. It was originally built in the 4th Century BC and was used for the next 700 years before it was abandoned in the early 4th Century AD.\n\nWhile the gymnasium was used for training for boxing, wrestling and pankration (a combination of wrestling and boxing) they’re actually much more than what we consider gyms in our modern time. Gymnasiums were more similar to universities/colleges in the fact they also provided education and training for the mind. The Archaeological Site of Lykeion is of such importance because it’s where Aristotle founded his own philosophical school in 335 BC. He taught at the school for 12 years and it’s said that it was the most productive period of his life. So if you’ve ever read anything famous by Aristotle you may be walking in the same steps that he walked in while coming up with them!\n\nThis site is probably the one that is the least standing in comparison to the other ones but there are signs with drawings and information that really help you picture what the place would have looked like when it was in use. The walk around the area is not strenuous at all and luckily part of it is shaded which really helps against the strong Athens sun!"
