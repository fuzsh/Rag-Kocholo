This ultimate bucket list features the must-see Athens landmarks that will undoubtedly take your breath away. Let’s go!\n\nUnmissable Landmarks in Athens Greece\n\nBest Way to See These Monuments in Athens, Greece\n\nWhen it comes to checking out Athens’ famous landmarks you’ve got plenty of ways to get around:\n\nBy Metro: The Metro system is a top pick for exploring Athens.

Athens is like an open-air museum, there’s so much to see.\n\nHere we have it, my list of 24 famous sights in Athens that I 100% recommend visiting.\n\n1. The Acropolis\n\nThe Acropolis, also known as Acropolis Hill, is an absolute gem among historical sites in Athens, Greece. It dates back more than 3000 years ago.\n\nPerched high above the city, it is home to a plethora of fascinating ancient Athens attractions. As you explore this ancient wonder, prepare to be captivated by its magnificent columns and intricate architectural details.\n\nThe crown jewel of the Acropolis is undoubtedly the iconic Parthenon, a breathtaking temple dedicated to the goddess Athena. The Acropolis also houses other notable structures, including the Temple of Erechtheion with its iconic Caryatids, the Propylaea entrance gateway, and the Odeon of Herodes Atticus Amphitheater.\n\nFrom the Acropolis, you’ll be treated to panoramic views of Athens that will leave you in awe. Visiting the Acropolis is like stepping back in time and immersing yourself in the rich history of ancient Athens.\n\nI visited the Acropolis twice during my time in Greece – I’m obsessed with temples ruins, so I wanted to visit once by myself so I could take my time and peruse over every detail, and then I visited as part of a tour to get more insight into the history.\n\nThe Acropolis gets insanely busy. I arrived on both occasions as soon as the gates opened. There was next to no one there at the time, and I could get gorgeous photos without anyone in there. By about 10 am the place was rammed which is when I went to explore the lesser visited parts of the complex.\n\nInsider Tip: There are two entrances to the Acropolis, these are connected by the pedestrian-friendly Dionysiou Areopagitou Street. The main entrance is closer to the Parthenon, BUT this is always the busiest of the two entrances. I suggest entering via the entrance in Plaka and walking up through the grounds surrounding Acropolis Hill.\n\n2. The Parthenon\n\nOne of the integral parts of the Acropolis is The Parthenon, which stands as one of the most iconic Athens historical sites in the world.\n\nThis ancient masterpiece is a testament to the ingenuity and architectural prowess of the ancient Greeks. Dedicated to the goddess Athena, the Parthenon’s majestic columns and intricate sculptures showcase the artistic brilliance of the era.\n\nDespite the ravages of time and history, the Parthenon continues to captivate visitors with its enduring beauty and historical significance. Its iconic presence has made it one of the most famous Greek landmarks, drawing in tourists from far and wide.\n\nAs you stand in awe before this ancient marvel, you can’t help but feel a profound connection to the rich cultural heritage of Athens. The Parthenon is not just a historical site; it is a symbol of Greece’s glorious past and a testament to human achievement.\n\n3. The Erechtheion\n\nAnother building situated within the magnificent Acropolis is the Erechtheion. This remarkable structure, nestled alongside other notable buildings, is a true highlight of the ancient Athenian world.\n\nWith its graceful Ionic columns and the iconic Caryatids standing tall, the Erechtheion exudes an aura of elegance and mystique.\n\nThe Erechtheion’s unique design, with multiple levels and distinct architectural features, showcases the ingenuity of the ancient Greeks. Make sure you walk around the back of the building to see the ancient olive tree and get a better idea of the terraced layout of the building.\n\nThe statues that you can see are reconstructions. If like me, you want to see the originals, you’ll find them inside the Acropolis Museum on the second floor.\n\n4. Temple of Athena Nike\n\nAs you traverse the majestic entrance to the Acropolis, you’ll encounter the awe-inspiring Temple of Athena Nike. This temple, dedicated to the goddess of victory, is a testament to the artistic and architectural brilliance of the ancient Athenians and stands overlooking the gateway into the Acropolis.\n\nIt still features graceful columns and intricate friezes. You can see them as you approach the impressive Propylaea entrance. The temple’s strategic location offers outstanding views of the city below, and out to the sea.\n\n5. Odeon of Herodes Atticus\n\nOne standout gem within the Acropolis complex is the Odeon of Herodes Atticus.\n\nThe Odeon of Herodes Atticus is built into Acropolis Hill. Built in honour of Herodes Atticus’ wife, this stunning structure was built to host theatrical performances and musical concerts. It’s also one of the historical places in Athens, Greece that’s still in use today!\n\nBy day it continues to enchant visitors – it’s a gorgeous structure – with the backdrop of the green hills. The Odeon’s semicircular design, adorned with marble and stone, reflects the architectural brilliance of its time and although parts have been repaired over the centuries, much of it is still thousands of years old!\n\n6. Theatre of Dionysus\n\nThe theatre of Dionysus stands as a testament to the city’s rich theatrical heritage.\n\nThis ancient amphitheatre is dedicated to the Greek god of wine and theatre. It’s steeped in history and it was here that ancient Athenians gathered to see performances of legendary playwrights like Sophocles, Euripides, and Aeschylus.\n\nAlthough both the Odeon of Herodes Atticus and the Theatre of Dionysus feature a semi-circular tiered structure and were used for performance, unlike the Odeon, this Theatre isn’t in use today. However, it’s still incredible to see a glimpse of the past, where drama and storytelling flourished.\n\n7. Acropolis Museum\n\nThe Acropolis Museum is located at the bottom of Acropolis Hill. It’s not officially part of the Acropolis complex. Opening in 2009, this is one of the more modern famous landmarks in Athens, Greece.\n\nHousing an extensive collection of archaeological treasures, the museum showcases artefacts unearthed from the Acropolis site itself.\n\nSome of the highlights and things I recommend you visit here are the stunning Parthenon friezes and the Caryatid statues.\n\nThe friezes would once have been around the top of the Parthenon. There is so much detail in these sculptures, I spent ages looking at all the carefully carved details. They’re outstanding!\n\nParts of the friezes are originals, and others are casts – the originals being in other museums around the world – British Museum, London has a large part of the frieze called the ‘Elgin Marbles’ which I hope one day will be returned to their rightful place.\n\nThe state-of-the-art museum also has digital and physical reconstructions helping to show what the Acropolis would have looked like in its heyday. The museum also has expansive windows that give fabulous panoramic views of the Acropolis Hill.\n\nI recommend spending at least a couple of hours here taking everything in. The museum’s galleries really help tell the story of ancient Greek civilization, from its mythical origins to its golden age of democracy. With informative displays and interactive exhibits, the Acropolis Museum brings history to life, offering a truly immersive experience for visitors of all ages.\n\nInsider Tip: If you’re wanting to see another building that seamlessly combines old and new, then I recommend the National Library of Greece. It consists of two libraries that were joined together creating the biggest library in the country. It’s home to over one million books!\n\n8. Temple of Olympian Zeus\n\nThis monument, dedicated to the king of the gods, Zeus, is a testament to the city’s architectural prowess and rich history.\n\nSeveral of Athens’ monuments are undergoing substantial repair – after all, they are thousands of years old – this is one of them. Despite it being supported by scaffolding right now, you can still appreciate its importance.\n\nThe remains of the temple’s colossal Corinthian columns* once reached a height of 17 metres. Originally consisting of 104 columns, it was one of the largest temples in the ancient world!\n\nToday, 15 columns still stand as well as a couple of ancient gateways – adjacent to the temple, you’ll see the impressive Arch of Hadrian, a Roman triumphal arch that served as a symbolic gateway between the old and new parts of the city.\n\n*Currently the Odeon of Zeus is undergoing major renovations, so there’s a lot of scaffolding over the site\n\n9. Ancient Agora\n\nThis was another one of my absolute highlights in Athens, and I spend hours in here.\n\nThis archaeological site, once the bustling marketplace and civic centre of ancient Athens, offers a fascinating glimpse into daily life.\n\nThis site also features the remarkably well-preserved Temple of Hephaestus – this seems fitting as it’s dedicated to the god of craftsmanship. It features intricate Doric columns and friezes.\n\nBe sure to wander through the Stoa of Attalos, a reconstructed ancient covered walkway that housed shops and provided shelter for gatherings – don’t forget to go upstairs for some stunning views overlooking the entire archaeological site.\n\nThe grounds of Ancient Agora really help showcase how life was back in ancient times. I suggest spending a couple of hours here to fully explore the statues, altars, and monuments that dot the site.\n\n10. Temple of Hephaestus\n\nThe Temple of Hephaestus is one of the most stunning ancient buildings in Athens.\n\nThis incredibly preserved building dates back to the 5th century BC. Unlike the Parthenon, this temple is intact and adorned with intricate friezes depicting mythological tales.\n\nThe Temple of Hephaestus, also known as the Hephaisteion sits on a strategic location on top of a hill within the Ancient Agora site. Looking down provides a panoramic view of the ancient city, allowing you to appreciate the grandeur from a unique vantage point.\n\n11. Roman Agora / Roman Forum of Athens\n\nTravel back in time as you explore the captivating Roman Agora, also known as the Roman Forum.\n\nThis archaeological site, located near the Ancient Agora, offers a fascinating glimpse into the city’s Roman period. Stroll through the remains of this once-bustling marketplace and administrative centre, where Roman citizens gathered for commerce and civic affairs.\n\nOne of the most striking buildings here is the impressive Tower of the Winds.\n\nThis ancient clocktower is adorned with intricate reliefs depicting the eight wind deities. It was used to estimate time by the position of the sun and the shadows it cast, the tower also served as a weather station and was used for forecasting.\n\nThe Roman Agora combines Roman and Greek influences, with architectural elements from both civilizations coexisting in harmony.\n\n12. Hadrian’s Library\n\nOne of the most important historical landmarks in Athens, Greece can be found at Hadrian’s Library. Built by the Roman Emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century AD, this grand structure served as a public library and cultural centre.\n\nThis building would once have housed the treasures of ancient knowledge. The library once contained countless scrolls and books, offering a wealth of knowledge at the time.\n\nAlthough a lot of the structure is gone, there’s still a very evident layout, with some features still remaining. It’s a huge library, and enough to rival any modern-day equivalent. You can imagine the bustling atmosphere of scholars, intellectuals, and curious minds that once filled its halls.\n\nHadrian’s Library stands as a testament to the importance of education and the pursuit of wisdom in ancient Athens.\n\nInsider Tip: If you’re visiting Hadrians Library, then take a short walk to Panagia Kapnikarea Church. This Greek Orthodox is one of the oldest churches in Athens. Although, for most, it’s probably not worth a trip in itself, it’s close to Hadrians Library so I recommend tagging it on when you visit as a bit of a detour.\n\n13. The Lyceum of Aristotle or Aristotle’s School\n\nStep into the footsteps of one of history’s greatest minds as you explore the remarkable Lyceum of Aristotle in Greece.\n\nOn this site was once the renowned school founded by the legendary philosopher Aristotle. This is where Aristotle began his teachings and engaged in profound discussions with his students.\n\nFrom an educational stance, this is one of the most important historical places in Greece. The Lyceum is a significant place in the history of education, where critical thinking and the pursuit of knowledge were fostered.\n\nThere are no impressive buildings at this site, just the footprints of what would have been training grounds and meeting places. There are lots of explanation boards dotted around pointing out the various features.\n\nDespite the lack of buildings, you can’t deny the importance of this place and wander through the ruins where Aristotle’s teachings started. Even after thousands of years, they still play their part in Western philosophy, science, and politics today!\n\n14. National Archaeological Museum\n\nThe National Archaeological Museum is one of the most famous buildings in Athens. It has a significant collection of ancient Greek art and artefacts.\n\nInside, you’ll find stunning sculptures, intricate pottery, and exquisite jewellery on display. From the iconic Mask of Agamemnon to the captivating Antikythera Mechanism, the museum’s vast collection showcases the ingenuity and craftsmanship of the ancient Greeks.\n\nTo see the highlights, I recommend a couple of hours – if you’re a fan of history, then you could spend at least half a day here walking through the museum’s halls and immersing yourself in the stories of mythical gods, heroes, and everyday life in ancient Greece.\n\n15. Plaka Neighbourhood\n\nThe Plaka neighbourhood is located at the foot of Acropolis Hill. It’s a gorgeous little district with a charming mix of history and cuteness.\n\nI spend ages wandering around the narrow cobblestone streets, where neoclassical buildings, quaint houses, and traditional tavernas adorned with colourful flowers create a picturesque setting.\n\nYou’ll find an abundance of shops filled with unique souvenirs, handmade crafts, and traditional Greek products, intertwined with restaurants and cafes. As you wander through the streets, you’ll stumble across numerous ancient sites, including the Tower of the Winds and the Roman Agora, offering a glimpse into Athens’ rich history.\n\nIn Plaka, the past seamlessly blends with the present, it’s clear to see why this is such a popular neighbourhood to explore.\n\nInsider Tip – If you’re interested in markets, then I recommend heading to neighbouring Monastiraki. Stalls line the streets here every day of the week, but the best day to experience the Monastiraki flea market is on Sunday. You’ll find everything from souvenirs, jewellery, vintage clothing and nick-nack.\n\n16. Panathenaic Stadium\n\nThis iconic stadium is one of the most famous places in Greece, Athens. Also known as the Kallimarmaro Stadium, it holds a significant place in Olympic history as it hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896.\n\nTake a walk through the enormous marble structure, which was reconstructed on the site of an ancient stadium from the 4th century BC.\n\nClimb to the top of the horseshoe-shaped arena and along the distinctive rows of white marble seats. From here you’ll get a panoramic view of the stadium. To hear the roar of the crowd during the Panathenaic Games must have been quite something!\n\nToday, the Panathenaic Stadium stands as a timeless symbol of the Olympic spirit. There’s an onsite museum, which showcases memorabilia from past Olympic Games and provides fascinating insights into the history of sports and athletic competitions.\n\n17. Hadrian’s Arch\n\nThis monumental gateway, located near the Temple of Olympian Zeus, was erected in honour of the Roman Emperor Hadrian during the 2nd century AD.\n\nAs you approach the arch, you’ll be able to see the intricate architectural details. Its Corinthian columns and elaborate friezes adorn its facade and show scenes from Greek mythology.\n\nHadrian’s Arch served as a symbolic entrance to the city, marking the boundary between the old and the new. It’s also one of the free ancient Athens landmarks you can get up close to.\n\n18. Mount Lycabettus\n\nThis beacon that looms over Athens stands at 277 metres tall. It offers incredible views and is the best vantage point to look at the sprawling cityscape below.\n\nYou can get up there in two ways: if you’re feeling energetic then hike up or opt for a convenient funicular ride to reach the top. Whichever way you go, you’ll be rewarded with a magnificent vista that stretches from the Acropolis to the Saronic Gulf.\n\nThe top of Mount Lycabettus also boasts a charming chapel dedicated to St. George, as well as a restaurant.\n\nAs the sun sets, you’ll get to see the city lights flicker to life. This is a great opportunity to capture the perfect Instagram-worthy shot or simply relish in the serene beauty of the surrounding landscape.\n\n19. Philopappos Hill\n\nThe Philopappos Hill always gets overlooked as the best city view in Athens, but in my opinion, it gave a much better view of the Acropolis than Mount Lycabettus did. I climbed up at sunset, which is a great time to go as the sun makes the Acropolis glow orange!\n\nAs you ascend the hill, stop off at the Prison of Socrates. This is where the renowned philosopher was said to have been held. There’s a little information board outside that explains it.\n\nContinuing your ascent, you’ll reach the pinnacle of the hill. Here you’ll find a ruin called the Philopappos Monument. These ancient ruins pay tribute to Gaius Julius Antiochus Epiphanes Philopappos (what a name!). He was a prince and benefactor of Athens during the Roman era.\n\nThere are quite a few vantage points at the top. Find a rock to perch on and sit and watch the sunset making everything glow a vibrant colour.\n\n20. Kerameikos Cemetery\n\nThis archaeological site holds a deep significance as the final resting place of Athenian citizens throughout the centuries.\n\nWander around the remnants of this sacred burial ground. It’s a sprawling site that shows the footprints of various buildings and plazas. Explore the intricate gravestones, stelae, and burial monuments that line the pathways, each telling a unique story of the individuals who once walked these streets thousands of years ago.\n\nBeyond its role as a cemetery, Kerameikos also served as a gathering place for civic activities. Look out for the ancient ceremonial gates; the imposing Dipylon Gate, and the enigmatic Sacred Gate, which guarded the entrance to the sacred city.\n\nThere’s an onsite museum that shows a collection of artefacts found here, including a pair of impressive lions that would have once been on the gates. The museum gives details about the rituals and traditions surrounding death in ancient Athens.\n\n21. Plato’s Academy\n\nThis revered institution was founded by the renowned philosopher Plato. It served as a centre of intellectual inquiry and philosophical discourse during ancient times. Here you can walk in the footsteps of some of the greatest minds from history.\n\nVery little remains of the original structures, but today’s building is a testament to Plato’s Academy. It serves as a place to reflect on the enduring influence of Plato and his disciples, whose ideas continue to shape philosophical thought to this day.\n\nAlthough the physical remnants may be sparse, the spirit of intellectual curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge still feels alive here.\n\n22. Syntagma Square\n\nSyntagma Square, located in the heart of Athens, stands as a vibrant hub and a symbolic centre of the modern city.\n\nThis bustling square is not only a meeting point for locals and tourists but also it’s one of the most important places in Athens. Its name, “Syntagma,” meaning “Constitution” in Greek, reflects its historical role as a gathering place for demonstrations and political rallies.\n\nHere, you’ll find the Greek Parliament building, the imposing Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and the iconic Evzones, the Presidential Guard, with their distinctive uniforms and synchronised changing of the guard ceremony. The square’s grandeur is enhanced by its elegant neoclassical buildings, lively cafes, and high-end boutiques.\n\nSyntagma Square also serves as a transportation hub, connecting various parts of the city through its metro station and bus stops.\n\n23. The Greek Parliament\n\nThe Greek Parliament is a majestic building located in Syntagma Square. As one of the more famous monuments in Athens, it’s a testament to Greece’s history and solidarity. The building formerly known as the Old Royal Palace, now serves as the seat of the Hellenic Parliament.\n\nOutside the building, you’ll feel dwarfed by its impressive columns and the sheer size of the place.\n\nOne of the highlights of a visit to the Greek Parliament is witnessing the Changing of the Guard ceremony, performed by the Evzones. This happens throughout the day, but if you can I recommend trying to watch the main procession at 11 am on Sunday.\n\nThe Presidential Guards are dressed in their traditional uniforms and showcase their disciplined movements. To watch the guards is a captivating spectacle that has become an iconic symbol of Athens tradition.\n\n24. Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\n\nThe Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, situated in front of the Greek Parliament in Syntagma Square, stands as a solemn tribute to the fallen heroes who sacrificed their lives in service to Greece.\n\nThis is one of the most symbolic monuments in Athens. It serves as a constant reminder of the price of freedom. The tomb is guarded by the distinguished Evzones, the Presidential Guards.\n\nThe Evzones stand motionless, dressed in their traditional uniforms, as a symbol of honour and respect. This is the place where you’ll witness the Changing of the Guard ceremony.\n\nTips for Visiting These Athens, Greece Historical Landmarks\n\nWhen visiting the historical landmarks in Athens keep these travel tips in mind:\n\nWear comfortable shoes: Exploring the ancient landmarks often involves walking on uneven surfaces and climbing stairs.
