        "text": "Hadrian's arch was built to honor the Emperor Hadrian and likely to celebrate the consecration of the Temple of Olympian Zeus abutting.\n\nThis is well worth the the visit.\n\nIts unique as still defining, a thousand odd years later, an ancient stretch of road allowed this tiny bit of ancient Athens' remaining open land.\n\nThe busy 9 springs of Kaliroi was also a few meters further on. Courtesy of Tyrant Piesistratos who set the stage for so much of todays western civilization.\n\nBoth residents and visitiors need to exercise care crossing the busy 3 way interchange. Those unable to scramble are better off getting on the proper side of the road from Constitution square with its cross walks and lights. The side with the National Gardens on it.\n\nEtched in stone it states the arch separated the original classical section of Athens from the new construction inaugurated by the Roman Emperor Hadrian, of the newly conceived Roman quarter, although these boundaries are hard to define.\n\nThere is an inscription to this effect on the arch itself comparing Hadrian's Athens to the Athens of Theseus, the cities legendary founder.\n\nHadrian was Grecophile."
