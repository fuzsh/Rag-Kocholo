        "text": "athens, greece\n\nFrom ancient architecture to tasty street food, Europe’s hottest city has much to offer curious travelers. Here are some of the best activities and things to do in Athens, Greece!\n\nAthens is the capital of Greece and dedicated to the goddess Athena. It’s often called the ‘birthplace of democracy’ and the ‘Cradle of Civilization’ because it was also home to the Platonic Academy and the Lyceum of Aristotle.\n\nWith a recorded history dating back 3400 years, Athens (also called Athenai) has many archaeological wonders worth visiting.\n\nReplete with temples, ancient ruins, and statues of deities, Athens is now a mix of modern buildings along with older architectural marvels.\n\nAside from the history and architecture the city is known for, there are many other fun things to do in Athens that most people miss…\n\nIf you’re planning to spend some time in Athens, I wanted to recommend some of my favorite fun and unusual things to do, no matter what time of year you visit.\n\nAthens Highlights Map\n\nHOW TO USE THIS MAP: Above you’ll find a map of highlights in Athens, Greece. Click on the top left of the map to find separate layers marking the route and points of interest. You can hide and show different layers, or click icons on the map to see the names of places I mention in this travel guide. “Star” the map to save it to your own Google Maps, or open the map in a new window for a larger version. Enjoy!\n\nBest Things To Do In Athens Guide\n\n1: The Acropolis\n\nYou can’t start a visit to Greece without hiking up to visit the Acropolis. As one of the most important Athens locations, as well as a World Heritage Site, this fortified citadel perched on a hill above the city stands out as a testament to Greek wisdom and culture.\n\nThe Acropolis holds many different ancient ruins, like the world-famous Parthenon temple, dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena.\n\nThe best way to visit the Acropolis (and save some money) is to purchase the Acropolis Combo Ticket which gives you access to multiple Greek ruins across the city over the course of 5-days.\n\nPlan to spend at least a few hours exploring the Acropolis hill itself, maybe even a half-day. There is a lot to see, plenty of stair climbing, and worn-smooth slippery rocks. You’ll definitely get a workout!\n\n2: The Parthenon\n\nWhile part of the Acropolis complex, the Parthenon deserves a specific mention. Built in 447 BCE on the hill of the Acropolis, with Doric marble columns that thinned towards to top — showcasing the architectural marvels of ancient Greece.\n\nDedicated to goddess Athena, the Parthenon ruins are a must-visit attraction in Athens during the day; and seen from across the city the magnificent columns look spectacular lit up at night at night.\n\nIt can get crowded up there, so I recommend going first thing in the morning — right when the Acropolis opens, or during the last few hours before they close!\n\nIf you don’t want to hire a dedicated tour guide, but enjoy learning details about historic locations like this, there are also self-guided smartphone tours too.\n\n3: Odeon Of Herodes Atticus\n\nThe Odeon of Herodes Atticus is an ancient theater perched on the South Western slope of the Acropolis in Athens. Frank Sinatra, Nana Mouskouri, Pavarotti, and Andrea Bocelli have all performed here!\n\nBuilt by Herodes Atticus in 161 AD, in memory of his dead wife, the steep-sloped Odeon had a cedar roof and seated 5000 for music concerts till it was destroyed in 267 AD.\n\nIt has been used as a venue for many popular concerts since it was restored in the 1950s. If you happen to be visiting Athens when a concert is going on here, I highly recommend you go!\n\n4: Acropolis Museum\n\nBuilt to house ancient artifacts from the Acropolis ruins, the Acropolis Museum on the Southern slopes of the Acropolis opened in 2009. Just a short 400 meter walk from the Parthenon, a visit to the museum can be combined with a visit to the Acropolis.\n\nThe museum is home to over 4250 objects and replaces the older museum that was housed atop the Acropolis from 1874 to the 1950s. Walk under the museum to see the excavation site of an ancient Athens neighborhood with streets, houses, and shops dating back to 3000 B.C.\n\nYou can pre-book tickets to the Museum here.\n\n5: Ancient Agora & Temple Of Hephaestus\n\nThe Central Square in ancient Greek cities, the Agora was a gathering place for citizens to discuss affairs of state, marriages, and partake in religious rituals. Over the course of time the Agora also came to be used a marketplace selling goods, food, pottery, and religious artifacts.\n\nNext to the Athenian Agora, you’ll also find the Temple of Hephaestus which was very well-preserved compared to other Greek temples. This Doric temple was built by The Hephaisteion Master under the aegis of Pericles between 449 to 415 BC to honor Hephaestus, the god of craftsmanship, fire and metal work.\n\nThe Stoa, another good site nearby, houses the Museum of Ancient Agora, that is home to Athenian, Byzantine and Turkish artifacts.\n\n6: The Roman Agora\n\nLocated to the East of the Ancient Agora, the Roman Agora was built much later and encroached on the site of the older one. The entrance to it was through the still standing Gate of Athena Archegetis. The 17th century Fethiye Mosque is located in the Northern end of the agora.\n\nThe agora is also home to the 12-meter tall Horologion of Andronikos Kyrrhestes, also known as the Tower of the Winds, which was probably the first meteorological station in the world. Also called Areides, the tower features a water clock, different sundials, and once also included a Triton weather-vane.\n\n7: Varvakios Central Market\n\nThe Varvakios Central Market in Athens (not to be confused with Central market where food trucks gather) is also called the Varvakios Agora or Dimotiki Agora. If you love public markets, this is where you’ll find fish, meat, produce, street food, souvenirs, and whole stores dedicated to olives or spices.\n\nBecause of the variety of goods, low prices, and freshness, this is where many local restaurants get their ingredients. The fish market alone serves up to 5,000 customers every day and employs more than 400 people!\n\nHOURS: Varvakios market is open between 7am and 6pm every day but Sundays.\n\n8: Run Around The Panathenaic Stadium\n\nThe Panathenaic Stadium was built to host the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, on the same site as an even older ancient stadium where nude male athletes competed in track events.\n\nWhile the older stadium built in 335 BC could hold 60,000 spectators, the modern Olympic Stadium you see today can hold 45,000 spectators on 47 tiers.\n\nWe ran around the track with our son Dylan, pretending we were at the Olympics. You can climb to the top of the stadium for an even better view of how massive it is, and of course there is a tri-level medal podium where you can pose for photos.\n\nYou can also go inside the stadium to visit a little museum of Olympic history, complete with the torches used in past games.\n\n9: Explore The Plaka Neighborhood\n\nLined with colorfully painted old houses, the Plaka quarter of Athens is home to small taverns where you can taste some authentic Greek food. Walk through the winding alleys and visit the Library of Hadrian, Kapnikaréa Church, Metamórfosis Church, or spend time shopping at popular stores on Ermou Street.\n\nVisit the nearby Anafiotika quarter to take pictures, or enjoy a drink while soaking in the vibes at the famous Restaurant Staircase on Mnisikleous Street.\n\n10: National Archaeological Museum\n\nGreece’s largest archaeological museum, the National Archaeological Museum of Athens was set up in the 19th century. Housed in a Neo-classical building designed by L. Lange, it houses over 11,000 artifacts and 5 permanent collections.\n\nPrehistoric antiquities from the Mycenaean, Neolithic, and Cycladic areas, Greek ceramics from 11th century BC, Egyptian antiquues dating back to 5000 BC, marble Cycladic figurines, gold artifacts from the Mycenaean period, there’s a lot to see here!\n\n11: Hike Mount Lycabettus\n\nA cretaceous limestone hill towering over Athens, Lykavittos or Mount Lycabettus rises 300 m above sea level. Covered with pine trees, the hill is perfect for a hike to the top, and rewards the visitor with picture perfect views of Athens.\n\nIf you’re too lazy to hike, ride the Lycabettus Funicular to the top, and spend time at the restaurant after visiting the Chapel of St. George.\n\nFor a more in-depth experience, check out this guided tour.\n\n12: Athens Stray Cat Spotting\n\nMuch like Istanbul in Turkey — Athens is full of stray cats. Local shop owners and other residents kind of “adopt” them by putting out food & water, but the cats are wild & free to roam the city.\n\nAs huge cat fans, this was a pleasant surprise! We were always keeping our eyes out for strays, and even bought some dry cat food to give them as we wandered around the city.\n\nOne of the best places to find stray cats is around the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in the Plaka neighborhood.\n\n13: Hadrian’s Arch\n\nHadrian’s Arch is a beautiful structure located along one of Athens’ main roadways. It was constructed in 131 BC to celebrate the arrival of the Roman Emperor Hadrian and to thank him for his benefactions to the city.\n\nIts architecture resembles Roman style arches, and is within walking distance from Syntagma Square — between the rock of the Acropolis and the temple of Olympian Zeus.\n\n14: Hike Up Philopappou Hill\n\nDeclared an archaeological park in 1955-56, the 173 acre Philopappou Hill (or Filopappou Hill) is home to the Athenian owl, peregrine falcon and other indigenous birds. It also gives you great views of Athens from above! Probably why the birds like it so much.\n\nThe park includes the Hill of the Nymphs, the Pnyx, and the Mouseion Hill or Hill of the Muses where the Philopappou Mausoleum or Monument is located.\n\nThe Philopappou Mausoleum is dedicated to Gaius Julius Antiochus Epiphanes Philopappos, a prince of the Kingdom of Commagene who lived from 65 to 116 AD. His death caused grief to the citizens of Athens and the imperial family.\n\nThe 12th century Church of Demetrius Loumbardiaris hidden in wooded area of the park is perfect for a serene quiet visit.\n\n15: Temple Of Olympian Zeus\n\nThe half-ruined Temple of Olympian Zeus is within walking distance from the city center of Athens. At its peak, the temple was composed of the temple had 104 columns, each 17 meters high.\n\nBut in 267 AD, the temple was damaged during an attack on Athens. Later the Byzantine emperor Theodosius II prohibited the “cult” of ancient Greek and Roman gods in the temple. Citizens slowly took apart the temple’s fine marble for construction of churches, homes, and other buildings.\n\n16: Panagia Kapnikarea Church\n\nAmong the oldest churches in the capital city of Athens, the Panagia Kapnikarea Church is a Byzantine treasure. Built in the 11th century on the ruins of a Greek temple, the church on Ermou Street near Monastiraki is dedicated to the assumption of the Virgin.\n\nIlluminated by lamps instead of chandeliers, the walls feature mosaics and religious works of art.\n\n17: Stuff Yourself With Greek Food\n\nIf you asked a local to point you to the best restaurants in Athens, everyone would point you towards a different one. There are just so many good tavernas and places to eat in Athens.\n\nMake sure to check out some of the places on the Mnisikleous Restaurant Staircase, or the many tavernas in Plaka or Psiri Quarter. Old Ithaki is a good lunch spot we visited a few times, next to the Athens Cathedral.\n\nBut if you want to eat somewhere luxurious with a view of the city, try the the rooftop bar at the Grand Bretagne Hotel. Enjoy a cocktail here while watching the sun go down over Athens!\n\n18: Museum Of Cycladic Art\n\nEstablished in 1986 by ship owner Nikolas Goulandris and his wife Dolly Goulandris, the Museum of Cycladic Art is located in the Kolonaki Quarter.\n\nIt houses over 3000 objects of art from the Cyclades, as well as Ancient Greek and Cypriot art. Most of these pieces are from Nikolas’ own collection and date back to the 4th to 6thcentury BC.\n\n19: Monastiraki Square & Flea Market\n\nThis 19th-century neighborhood on the Northern side of the Acropolis is a vibrant shopping area. Street vendors and shops sell trinkets and souvenirs, clothes, and specialty items to tourists. When you need a break, grab a bite at one of the many casual restaurants.\n\nSituated close to many popular sites, the Monastiraki Flea Market in Monastiraki Square is the perfect place to buy souvenirs, handmade footwear, and artisanal products.\n\nFor a cool overhead view of the square and the city, make sure to visit the rooftop bar A For Athens and grab a cocktail!\n\n20: Explore Athens’ Psiri Quarter\n\nThe Psiri Quarter (also spelled Psyrri or Psirri) is a hip and creative little neighborhood in Athens where all the happening nightlife is. You’ll find restaurants, bars, cafes, tavernas, and colorful street-art. One of the oldest neighborhoods in the city, it used to have a reputation for crime, but the area has since been gentrified.\n\nOne place you need to stop here is called Little Kook Magic Cafe. This quirky coffee & cake place is decorated like a children’s fairy tale book, featuring all manner of animals, storybook characters, colorful flowers, dragons, fairies, and an umbrella covered side-street. The perfect Instagram photo location!\n\n21: Sunset On Areopagus Hill\n\nAreopagus Hill, also known as “Mars Hill”, is a large rock outcrop located close to the entrance of the Acropolis. Take the stairs up to the top of the rock for some awesome views of the Acropolis from a different perspective, as well as Athens itself.\n\nThe hill was an ancient meeting place where philosophy and law were discussed, as well as the location of a famous speech by St. Paul the Apostle. Sunset is a popular time to hang out up here!\n\n22: The Prison Of Socrates\n\nA cave-like structure cut into the Hill of Muses has long thought to have been the jail used to hold the ancient philosopher Socrates before he was executed. No one knows for sure.\n\nThe teachings of Socrates were thought of as dangerous in Athens, leading to the decline of morality in the population of Greece. A new Athenian democracy was afraid that citizens would stop obeying the established laws and rules or fulfilling their civic duty, which would lead to overthrowing of the new political system.\n\nSo Socrates was imprisoned, and eventually executed in 399 BC by poison hemlock. This structure was also used as a place to hide antiquities from the Acropolis and the National Archaeological Museum during World War II.\n\n23: Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens\n\nThe Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens is kind of the “official” church of the city. It was constructed with materials from over 70 abandoned or ruined churches, and the interior includes notable frescoes and icons plus a 24-metre-high dome.\n\nRight next to the big church is a smaller one, the Church of St. Eleftherios also called the “Little Mitropoli.” Dedicated to Agios Eleftherios, this 12th-century church is decorated with 90 relief scenes.\n\n24: Changing Of The Guard\n\nDedicated to all lost Greek soldiers in past wars, Greece’s Tomb of the Unknown Solider sits in front of the Greek Parliament Building. Every hour, on the hour, you can watch the changing of the presidential honor guard.\n\nThis is a free thing to do in Athens, so it’s pretty popular and there’s often a large crowd watching. The Tomb, called a cenotaph, is empty and was made according to Ancient Greek custom.\n\nA much more impressive ceremony takes place at 11am on Sundays, where a large group of Evzones (presidential guards) gather in front of the Parliament.\n\n25: Hadrian’s Library\n\nHadrian’s Library isn’t just a library, but a building that housed music and lecture rooms too. It was organized as a typical Roman forum with a pool in the center of a courtyard and bordered by 100 columns.\n\nIt essentially functioned as Athens’ civic center in Roman times, while the nearby Roman Agora was the central market. Hadrian was Roman emperor from 117 to 138, however he had a particular fondness for the city of Athens and constructed all manner of big projects here — like the library.\n\nTransportation Around Athens\n\nRental Car\n\nThe best site to book your car is with Discover Cars.
