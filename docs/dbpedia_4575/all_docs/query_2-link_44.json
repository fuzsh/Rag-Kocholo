The building is designed by Swiss architect Bernard Tschumi and covers ancient ruins, much of which has glass panels to give constant views of the Parthenon. The museum is divided into three levels, with a chronological trip through the centuries beginning on the ground floor with findings from the hills archaic period.\n\nFantastic museum, i guess it is among the top sights in Athens! I attached lots of photos as the exhibition is just so amazing! So bright inside, loveable atmosphere, loads of history and arts! Ticket costs only €5 in the winter time. They have a cafe inside with the most amazing view over the Acropolis hill. People are very kind here! Mesmerizing spot ♥️\n\nA beautiful modern museum, full of history and with a great atmosphere. The exhibits are priceless, of course, and the way they are presented is fabulous, giving immediately the feel of how/why/where they were situated in antiquity. The number one feature of this museum is the location and the 360º view around it. It is located under the Acropolis and the big windows are giving a nice view of the surrounding centre of Athens city. The restaurant on the balcony is of very high culinary standards and the view is superb. A \"must go\" place if you visit Athens.\n\nWonderful museum. All the ancient treasure but with a modern architecture design. Love the underground ruins. Bookstore is great! Recommend to come early (morning - before lunch time) or later in the afternoon to avoid large groups. Strongly recommend to book tickets online prior to visit.\n\n2\n\nFirst Cemetery of Athens\n\n4.5 · 328 reviews 4.5 · 59 reviews\n\nThe Cemetery of Athens is a beautiful and serene burial ground with sculptures and elegant mausoleums that is popular among Greeks for its impressive monuments. It's a must-see if you're in Athens, but be aware that once you go past the beautiful sculptures and monuments, the cemetery becomes a regular one with newer graves, which ruins the experience.\n\nLeave the madness of the 8 lane highway outside the gate and step into an oasis of calm and peace. The traffic is still audible in the background but once inside you are lost in a vast marble sculpture park of funerary monuments with cypress trees towering overhead providing welcome shade. It is always sobering to walk in these places but here it is genuinely uplifting to see the wonderful architecture of all types that has been erected to venerate long gone ancestors. From the enormous entrance canopy, past the pastel-coloured chapel, along the orange-tree lined concourse surrounded by the most extravagant monuments, and into the long avenues of more simple graves, this place rivals the Acropolis as the most astonishing attraction of Athens. A delightful and refreshing way to spend a couple of hours of your holiday.\n\nIt's a must see but I recommend you stick to the area with the beautiful sculptures and monuments only. Once you go past it, the cemetery becomes a \"regular\" one with newer graves, with colour pictures of the deceased and not so clean of a place and this ruins the experience. So go see the sculptures and monuments but nothing more, it's better this way.\n\nHow is this not on the Must-See list if Athens? The monuments are simply fantastic. No rush and bustle here. You can take in the beauty to the sound of wind through trees and birds singing\n\n3\n\nHadrian's Arch\n\n4.5 · 7288 reviews 4.0 · 794 reviews\n\nHadrian's Arch is a monumental gateway in the city of Jerash in Jordan that was built to honor the visiting emperor Hadrian. Made from marble derived from Mount Penteli, the arch is 13m tall and has Corinthian columns on each side. The two inscriptions carved on the bottom of the arch provide an interesting insight into Roman architecture and pomp and circumstance.\n\nThis is a very nice gate. The entrance is free. Kids have fun around here. On a rainy day it even gives shelter! But you should come to Aachen - we have even nicer gates! Like the authentic Pontgate or the traditional Kármán-Tor!\n\nGreat architecture. Amazing to think this structure is still surviving after thousands of years. Situated right next to Zeus temple with a great view of the acropolis in the distance. A must see if you are into ancient Greece. This site requires no purchases of tickets.\n\nIts a nice spot to take some photos with greek art for free, you can also make it interesting as there is many angles from which u can try. You can also come to it by accident when u go from Plaka district and the interesting fact is the writings on both sides. Good to see all in all, personally gave me happiness.\n\n4\n\nROLL IN ATHENS Bike & Walking Tours\n\n5.0 · 29 reviews\n\nROLL IN ATHENS Bike & Walking Tours is a great choice for a city tour in Athens. Kostas is an excellent guide who takes care to make sure everyone on the tour is safe and has a great time. The ride around the city is enjoyable, and the sights and sounds of Athens are amazing with the fresh sea air blowing through the open windows. This tour offers a unique perspective on Athens that you won't find anywhere else.\n\nI have also thought seeing a city by bike was a great way to explore it. I came across Roll in Athens as it's close to the central station. Booked and appointment for the following day and was shown all round central Athens with Dimos, very friendly and knowledgeable guide. The groups are small (mine was private) allowing for a very memorable experience as Dimos really knows the city and very accommodating to a answer questions and show sites.\n\nThank you for a different view of Athens in our cycle to the sea. It was lovely to see the Greek opera House and the blue sea. Maria our guide was very easy company and our host was so kind with his interesting conversation and a beer and snacks at the end. Thank you\n\nA great day out in Athens! I can't recommend Roll in Athens highly enough! Kostas was such an accommodating and flexible tour guide who led our inexperienced little group with ease, providing informative and insightful commentary along the way to the coast. Kostas knows his crowd and gave us an easy route for the return home by taking us on a sneaky tram! And at the end of the journey, a very pleasant surprise...Dimos (and supercute Ziggy the cat) hosted us to delightful refreshments on his beautiful rooftop with a view to the acropolis. Get out there and do it!\n\n5\n\nHadrian's Library\n\n4.4 · 5436 reviews 3.5 · 399 reviews\n\nThe Hadrian's Library is a large, beautiful public library in Athens that was built in the 2nd century AD. It is a great place for researching ancient history and was used by many notable scholars throughout its long history. The library also features an atrium in the center, reading rooms and small lecture halls attached.\n\nMake sure to check out Hadrian’s Library in the evening hours! The lights make the ancient ruins look amazing at night. During the day walk the grounds and take in all the beauty of the ruins. Grab a ticket online for no wait times! I was here in December 2021 and had the whole place to myself.\n\nThis is probably one of the more \"structurally intact\" sites out of the other sites you can visit (outside of the Acropolis). Went here as part of the package deal you can purchase. Since it's near most of the touristy spot/area. It's a nice little walk about to learn more about the history of Athens. You are still able to see the ruins/structure from the outside behind the fences, but if you brought the full pass and have the time; it's still a nice little place to visit and see.\n\nLike many other visitors to Athens, I bought the combined ticket. It allows you to visit several archeological sites in the historical area that's in the center of the city, including the Acropolis. To avoid queues in front of the ticket office of the Acropolis, buy your ticket at one of the smaller attractions, like Hadrian's Library. It took me seconds. I then entered and visited the site. Take your time, even if it doesn't look like much once you pass the main colonnade. Go early in the morning because there's hardly any shade anywhere.\n\n6\n\nHoly Church of Saint Nicholas Rangavas\n\n4.8 · 466 reviews 4.5 · 120 reviews\n\nThe Holy Church of Saint Nicholas Rangavas is a significant Byzantine monument located in the Anafiotika district close to the Lysicrates Monument and considered one of the oldest churches in Athens. The chapel of Agia Paraskevi was added in 1838. The Ragavases were a family that had been living in this area since c. 1400 AD and the church survives as an important part of their legacy.\n\nVery nice church, oldest of plaka, the priest is very nice. Dont forget to respect the place by observing classical clothing rules\n\nAn incredible masterpiece of architecture, combing elements of different periods of Athens’ history. Don’t miss it. I ‘ll be back for more photos.\n\nJust under Anafiotika. Old family Church (Ragavas family) that survives since c. 1400 AD. An amazing monument.\n\n7\n\nPlato's Academy Park\n\n4.5 · 845 reviews\n\nThe Plato's Academy Park is a large and beautiful park that features several attractions, including an ancient stone blocks workout area, basketball and football courts, and cafes and bars. The park is located in Athens, Greece, and is definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.\n\nThe park has both basketball and football courts, ancient stone blocks, one guy was doing a workout at night with one of these stones, and amazing cafes and bars right next to one of the entrances.\n\nthis park is a landmark both for this area and for Athens if one thinks about its historical significance. his image is not abandoned but shows that he is left to time with minimal interventions. at first glance this sounds right, but the overall picture probably leaves you with some questions regarding the reasons why something like this happens and also the planning for the future. One thing is clear: it could be one of the most beautiful places of culture and recreation in Athens. similarly, food and coffee shops located in the perimeter are also being carried away. They probably belong to a more lazy era and find it difficult to adapt to the demands of the most modern and developed city. it seems like a virgin place that many could rather than highlight, rather level it, and that could rise as a new disaster even though it could and it should be, a new city paradise\n\nIt's hard to have a museum that makes philosophy come alive, but Plato's Academy Digital Museum does just that. I recommend going to the museum first and then strolling the grounds of the Academy. It puts you in the right head space.\n\n8\n\nAreopagus Hill\n\n4.8 · 3148 reviews\n\nAncient court of appeal in Athens, perched atop Mars Hill with breath-taking views of the Acropolis; site of many famous speeches by Paul and other notable figures.\n\nStopped here after my second trip to the Acropolis. It’s a great lookout spot for panoramic views of Athens. Be careful as the rocks are slippery as you climb to the top. Stop here at golden hour of the day for great pictures!\n\nSuper amazing views. Go early in the morning to get a great shot and with no tourists if you want the peace of mind. It’s super pretty to watch the sunset. The buildings start to light up and makes everything look surreal. It’s like a fairytale. Highly recommend going here if you’re in Athens. Great photo opp!\n\nWhat a beautiful piece of history. Lovely monument. Only When you see the Monument and construction that’s when we realize the importance and hard work and grandness of this time relic\n\n9\n\nTours Meteora\n\n4.6 · 23 reviews\n\nTours Meteora is a tour operator that specializes in tours to the Meteora monasteries in Greece. They offer a variety of different tours, including day and overnight tours, and have extensive information about the monasteries and their history. Tours Meteora are highly rated by travelers, with many citing their great customer service as a top reason for choosing them.\n\nvery friendly and professional. they gave excellent information and advice instead of trying to sell you their products. there was no pressure at all to seek information from them and for them to offer us suggestions.\n\nGood\n\n10\n\nPanathenaic Stadium\n\n4.7 · 28512 reviews 4.5 · 5831 reviews\n\nThe Panathenaic Stadium, also known as Kallimarmaro, is an ancient stadium in Athens that hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896. It is now used for some ceremonial events and tours. The stadium is made entirely of marble and can accommodate up to 50,000 spectators. It was rebuilt to host the 1896 Olympic Games, the first international one held in modern history.\n\nLovely experience. Getting to see history always an amazing adventure. Greece has many site to see. This being the world's only white marvel stadium makes it that much better. You won't believe it till you see it. It's 10 euro to get in and worth it\n\nGreat historical place. Only 10 euros for adult admission, which came with an audio explanation for 12 locations. Each audio location was only about 3 minutes, so it was exact, concise, not overwhelming. It took about an hour to see it all. We thoroughly enjoyed learning about the history of the Olympics, past and present.\n\nAstonishing and wonderful place! This is truly a raw and rugged landmark of ancient times and worth an engaged visit. It boasts incredibly panoramic views of the entire stadium and the history of it is very palpable. To stand where the Olympics of countless years past were held, is truly both thrilling and wondrous. The stadium is great for pictures as well, and you get bountiful views of other classical Athens landmarks on all sides of your view. Truly recommended to visit and enjoy! This is beautiful Greece and Athens at its wonderful best!\n\n11\n\nTemple of Olympian Zeus\n\n4.5 · 22614 reviews 4.0 · 3924 reviews\n\nThe Temple of Olympian Zeus was a large and impressive building that was completed in the 6th century BCE. It was pillaged during a barbarian invasion less than a century after it was completed, but enough remains to show just how vast it once was.\n\nWe went here as recommended by our tour guide at the Acropolis as it is part of the entry ticket we bought. It is under renovation, which is amazing in the long run, but was a bummer for us as we couldn’t see much. You can see just a few columns but most are covered in scaffolding. It is a large area with some grass you can walk around.\n\nWhile it's the largest temple in Athens, the remains are scattered and with no clear historical tidbits. While we were there, half of the columns were under maintenance and cannot be seen. The place bears huge significance and there is great potential for it to be one of the top tourist destinations but requires some work which is still ongoing.\n\nThis is one of 7 archaeological sites which can be visited with a EUR 30 ticket over 5 days, and I recommend visiting all of them if you have time. However this site has less to see than the others - although this was the largest temple in Ancient Greece only a few of the original 106 columns are still there, and most of those that are are covered by scaffolding. Hadrian's Arch, built to honour the Roman Emperor who finished the temple after 700 years, is actually just outside the site and from there you can also see the remains inside.\n\n12\n\nErechtheion\n\n4.8 · 1616 reviews\n\nThe Erechtheion is an ancient Greek temple on the Acropolis of Athens, dedicated to Athena and Poseidon.\n\nWhat a beautiful place atop the Acropolis and just across from the Parthenon. Not as majestic but more intact, we found ourselves lingering longer at this less crowded site. The impressive statues of the ladies were a sight to behold. Was our favorite part at the Acropolis.\n\nWhat a beautiful building on top of the Acropolis. Sure, it may not be as majestic or well known as the Parthenon, but it’s certainly more intact. My wife and I took more time here since it’s less crowded. A truly stunning site with the ladies at the center.\n\nWe had an one day tour and came by morning which it’s a mistake because all group tours come in the morning before 13.00. Its really better to come in the afternoon. But, the tour itself its good because the tour guide is very good. We book the trip via Headout but the tour was organized by KEYTOUR.\n\n13\n\nMonastiraki Flea Market\n\n4.4 · 11611 reviews\n\nThe Monastiraki Flea Market is a sprawling market with dozens of small shops selling everything from clothes to souvenirs, food to furniture. It's open every day but on Sundays it's even more interesting, as there are open air improvised stalls selling even more objects.\n\nLoads of shops. They offer lots of souvenirs to buy, and food to eat. I would recommend walking one round first to compare the prices and quality before actually purchasing anything. Prices and quality varies from shop to shop.\n\nNice place for shopping. Prices, service & selection was good. Most vendors speak English. Prices can vary from one vendor to the next but otherwise fair. At then end of the flea market is a popular Instagram photo opportunity if that's your type of thing. A short walk to Plaka, tourist items were better priced.\n\nAwesome place, looking like \"souks\" in Athens. You will find everything you may need as a gift from Athens. Strongly appreciated ! Will definitely be back. Only drawback : sometimes shops holder are trying to push you to enter and buy their own products...\n\n14\n\nRoman Forum of Athens (Roman Agora)\n\n4.5 · 11480 reviews 4.0 · 693 reviews\n\nThe ruins of the Roman Forum of Athens are a historical landmark that can be found in the city center. The forum was built by the Romans in the 1st century BC and it served as an open-air marketplace featuring shops. Along the centuries, it was destroyed and its ruins were covered by houses, workshops, and mosques.\n\nIf you're looking to explore some amazing architecture, the Roman Forum of Athens is a great place to start. Arrive early to buy your tickets, and then take your time wandering around the ruins. It's truly a fascinating place, and you'll be able to learn a lot about the history of the city.\n\nOnly saw from the outside and hills as whole site closed due to snow! Utterly amazing site though and you can still imagine the hussle and bustle of this being the centre of trade and social gatherings. Beautiful. Only downside is the modern railway line going straight through the middle of it!\n\nDefinitely visit this place if doublet the Ticket for all the sites. It’s not the most impressive of all sites in Athens, but it does have its charm. The tower of the Winds for example is considered to be the worlds first meteorological station. So considering that, definitely worth a visit.\n\n15\n\nPhilopappos Hill\n\n4.7 · 16290 reviews\n\nThe park Philopappos Hill is located in the heart of Athens, and offers stunning views of the Acropolis and the Aegean Sea. The hill is a popular meeting place among locals for evening picnics and al fresco drinks, and there are several walking trails that criss-cross over it. The best spot to take photos of the monument of Filoppapos is standing in front of it.\n\nThis is a great place to walk when you need some fresh air and exercise. It's also a great place to snap some good photos of the city, and most importantly, the Acropolis. Also, keep an eye out for local wildlife. The turtles are especially fun to find if you're walking with your kids.\n\nNot so tall hill but really worth the walk up. From here you can see really good 360° views of Athens including the Acropolis, the city, sea and surrounding mountains. Amazing sunset views here too! See attached pictures.\n\nThis was right behind our hotel and it is a great walking spot...so many things to see and views are stunning. Go to the loo before you set off as there are no working loos on either side 😉 And yes, that is snow you can see...heaviest snow they'd had on seven years on the week we were there! 😂\n\n16\n\nAncient Cemetery\n\n3.7 · 9 reviews\n\nThe Ancient Cemetery in Athens is a popular tourist attraction that features some of the most iconic tombs and memorials from ancient Greece. The site is well-known for its impressive collection of vases and other pottery, as well as its historical significance. It's best to visit the site in the afternoon after 3pm when it's less crowded.\n\n(Translated by Google) Better to visit it in the afternoon after 3pm. (Original) Καλύτερα να το επισκεφθείτε απόγευμα μετά τις 3μμ.\n\nNothing left of it\n\nLugar incrível\n\n17\n\nAthens Luxury Homes\n\n5.0 · 4 reviews\n\nAthens Luxury Homes is a 100% Greek company that deals with the market of property management. The company provides stylish and luxurious apartments in the trendy district of Kolonaki, close to some of Athens' most famous art galleries and antique shops. The apartments are perfect for tourists who want to experience all the highlights of this beautiful city. The team at Athens Luxury Homes is highly experienced and passionate about their work, ensuring that each apartment is impeccably clean and well maintained.\n\nWe had a wonderful stay in the most beautifully decorated flat. All the details and furnishings were exquisite and we had all the amenities and small touches you would expect from a five star hotel. Nikitas made us feel very welcome by showing us around and told us the fascinating history of the building. The neighbourhood of Kolonaki was enchanting and we were able to walk to the Acropolis in 15 minutes. Our only regret is that we couldn’t spend more time in Athens to explore all the art galleries and antique shops surrounding the flat.\n\nBest property in Kolonaki. Amazing vibes brilliantly designed.\n\n18\n\nMuseum of Cycladic Art\n\n4.7 · 3178 reviews 4.5 · 1069 reviews\n\nThe Cycladic Museum preserves beautiful art from the 3rd millennium BC. The wide variety of exhibits covers both ancient objects and contemporary sculptures. Activities for children are available, and there is a library too.\n\nWe went on a Saturday visit, my husband, our daughter and I. The way the artefacts are showcased and explained makes the experience going through the 3 floors rather enjoyable in addition the curators had been mindful of the children too. So our visit was an equal delight for us the adults and our young child. Having travelled to few Cycladic islands, this cultural education visit made it even more special and fascinating. We ended our visit with a stop at the airy and pleasant cafeteria. There is a souvenirs area with great gifting ideas. PS: You will need proof of the Covid19 vaccination to be allowed in.\n\nOne of the most beautiful museums in the center of Athens. A unique collection of Cycladic artifacts, a comprehensive collection of the ancient Hellenic arts. Great cafe and gift shop.\n\nOne of Athens's unavoidable and essential museums. You should try to visit the top-floor first. The totally new display and the video are just flabbergasting. Don't forget to take a rest at the ground floor cafeteria. Their homemade pastries are excellent. Great sandwiches too.\n\n19\n\nStoa of Attalos\n\n4.7 · 1798 reviews 4.5 · 660 reviews\n\nThis stunning archaeological site on the east side of the Athenian Agora houses a museum that preserves some of the finest excavations from the Ancient Agora, dating back to sculptures, coins, and inscriptions that go back to 5th century BC. The museum is small but contains some amazing artifacts, including ostraca and pottery from the Byzantine period as well as pottery from the Turkish conquest.\n\nWOW! Another place full of greatness and history that you should not miss to see. It has been renovated in a great way that preserves the authentic feel. I recommend buying the combination ticket for almost all the attractions - the so called multi pass.\n\nSurprising visit to this museum where this was planned and rebuilt in the 1950s. It gives a feeling of how such ancient buildings were utilized. The numerous columns are beautifully done. The pottery and images of paintings done of the Acropolis in the 1800s allows one to imagine how it was 200 years ago and how people lived beside the ruins. Quite informative indeed. I enjoyed it. It is less crowded than the Acropolis.\n\nOne of the most well preserved places of the ancient Athens that everyone must visit to see, in order to understand how Athens was. Located in the ancient Agora, full of marbles and statues in two floors. On the second floor you can admire the whole area. It was constructed by local marbles and stones with architectural design and details that declares not only that Athenians were pioneers in Architecture but also capable and that they adored beauty and nice lifestyle.\n\n20\n\nTemple of Athena Nike\n\n4.7 · 711 reviews 4.5 · 1131 reviews\n\nThis imposing Ionic temple on the southeast slope of the Acropolis was dedicated to Athena Nike, the goddess of victory. The temple is famous for its beautiful friezes depicting Nike fixing her sandal.\n\nA must see in Athens. I recommend buying tickets in advance as you can get a fantastic deal for €30 to see all the most important monuments. We visited during the last week of April so there was no cues or waiting time to enter however, I can imagine this being a case if you're visiting over the summer holidays as we still encountered a lot of tourists. 100% recommend to seeing this place with your own eyes - it is impressive and humbling to see places built by such an iconic, ancient civilization.\n\nLove visiting here! We went in the summer and it was super hot! Bring an umbrella, wear a hat and drink plenty of water. It's a nice hike up and down the Acropolis. I would definitely do it again! It's so magnificent being able to see ancient structures in the middle of an urban city.\n\nIt's one of the earliest temples greeting you on the way to the Parthenon. Please give it more love! I wish we can enter and have a look tho...\n\n21\n\nZappeion Hall\n\n4.6 · 6701 reviews 4.0 · 215 reviews\n\nThe Zappeion Hall, located in the National Gardens of Athens, is mainly used as a conference and exhibition center. The neoclassical mansion was built in the 1880s for the first modern Olympic games and has played an important role in modern Greek history.\n\nZappeion Hall is an exhibition place that is situated in a beautiful nineteenth century building that was built in the neoclassical style. The gracious lines and perfect symmetry of the structure sets it far above similar buildings that try too hard to impress. Visit to take a look and then walk around to go to the National Garden, one of the more pleasant green spaces in Athens.\n\nI went to see this monument at night, in the early evening. I had the monument to myself, I was alone here. It was very nice not to see anyone, no tourists. The pictures speak for themselves, it was incredible. I think there are a lot of people during the day, but in the evening: you will be alone. So I recommend!\n\nVery beautiful place, full of charm, light and space to walk and relax. In Athens, even when you stop to rest between the thousands of sights, you still find yourself in front of a landmark.\n\n22\n\nAncient Agora of Athens\n\n4.7 · 27893 reviews 4.5 · 3813 reviews\n\nThe Ancient Agora of Athens, a historical landmark and archaeological museum, features the ruins of an ancient Greek gathering place as well as artifacts. Visitors can explore the site and see some of the most important ruins from antiquity, including the Royal Stoa. The site is a lush respite with beautiful greenery and hosts a good museum with artifacts from throughout ancient Greece. It is worth allowing about two hours to visit everything.\n\nIn Agora Park there is a very large selection of very ancient buildings and ruins, the largest and most impressive of which is the Temple of Hephaestus. There is also a small museum inside. Up the park there is a hill with an amazing panoramic view of the city and the Acropolis. In my opinion, if you have visited the Acropolis before then there is no point in going up for an observation there, because the view is the same and the Acropolis is higher. I recommend incorporating the Agora as you descend from the Acropolis, there are trails that connect them. This way you will save unnecessary ups and your way will be down.\n\nNo wait when going early in the morning. The Temple of Hephaestus is spectacular. The rest of the area is not as preserved, but being able to walk the same paths as Socrates, Paul, Alexander, Aristotle and many others. Google maps works well for finding the main entrance. The site is fenced off and has only one entrance and exit. Good museum with artifacts recovered at this site. Tickets were €10 in September 2022.\n\nIt’s not as exciting as some spots like Acropolis, given that the structures are mostly gone. However, if you walk up the hill to the Temple of Haphaestus, you get a real view and sense of what ancient Athens may have been like. Nice to walk around and wonder about days of Ancient Greece.\n\n23\n\nChoragic Monument of Lysicrates\n\n4.5 · 1834 reviews 3.5 · 135 reviews\n\nThe Choragic Monument of Lysicrates is a famous marble monument in Athens, Greece. It commemorates the winner of a play competition that it had sponsored. The monument is located on Tripidon Street close to the Acropolis. It is made out of Corinthian-style columns and has replicas all over the world.\n\nNice monument that you can see on your way to the Acropolis. Lots of shopping and restaurants as well.\n\nVery quiet & romantic place full of \"history\", ideal for a coffee break or lunch at nearby \"Diogenes\" bistro & restaurant.\n\nIt's a nice piece of history tucked right into the markets. Don't be alarmed by the insane amount of cats in the area. Also don't be lame and take pictures standing in the street. This is an active road and no one wants to see a tourist get ran over taking a selfie. Be kind and move to the right if you are a slow walker."
