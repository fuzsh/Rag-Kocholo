        "text": "This is the only 2 day Athens itinerary you will ever need! We spent a lot of time in Athens and had a lot of time to create this awesome itinerary for you! All from our first-hand experience. The itinerary includes some main tourist attractions and historical sites while still mixing in a lot of local spots and restaurants to help break up the exhausting touring days.\n\nThis Athens itinerary is just 2 days because that is the average time most people spend in Athens as they await their ferry to the Greek islands. Also, because we are digital nomads and work while we travel so most of our ‘touring’ is done over 2 day weekends.\n\nHowever, if you are in Athens for 3 or 4 days the below schedule can be stretched out and slowed down for a few extra days. If you have the time, you can also add in a visit to the Ancient Agora, mentioned as a bonus below.\n\nThe below 2 days in Athens, Greece itinerary is pretty jam-packed but allows you to see a lot of the top sites in Athens city center without feeling too rushed or breaking the bank. There is a lot of walking in this 2 day Athens itinerary so be sure to bring some comfortable footwear!\n\nSee here for the cost breakdown for this 2-days in Athens travel schedule and here for different ticket package options for all the main historical sites and landmarks in downtown Athens.\n\nDAY 1:\n\nSee Acropolis & grab Lunch\n\nHit up Acropolis right when it opens at 8 AM to avoid the crowds and tours that come in from the cruise ships. We spent about 2.5 hours exploring Acropolis. But if you are going to the Acropolis Museum afterward plan on at least 3 hours. Next, go to To Kati Allo for lunch. To Kati Allo has delicious traditional Greek food served buffet style. It is family-owned and runs and the cook is a lovely Greek woman who speaks no English but makes the best Moussaka! We found out about this restaurant because it was recommended by none other than the famous Rick Steves.\n\nHike up Filopappou Hill\n\nAfter a proper and filling Greek meal and a morning full of tourism, it is time to get a more local feel by hiking up Filopappou Hill. Filopappou Hill is also known as the hill of the muses and it is about a 10-minute walk from To Kati Allo. At Filopappou Hill be sure to check out Phynx hill, the birthplace of western democracy, and the Filopappou Monument at the top. Rest at the top for a bit and enjoy the stunning views of Acropolis as well as the sea on the other side of the hill.\n\nStroll through Plaka & Monastiraki\n\nNext, take a walk around the famous Plaka neighborhood. Check out the cobblestone streets, small alleyways, and tourist shops. Right next to Plaka is the Monastiraki neighborhood so be sure to stop by and admire Monastiraki Square and peruse through Monastiraki Market for some handmade souvenirs.\n\nMonastiraki is also home to many famous and ancient sites such as the Roman Forum (sometimes referred to as the Roman Agora), Hadrian’s Library, and the Ancient Greek Agora (also referred to as the Ancient Agora). The tower of Four Winds (The Clock Tower) is also located inside the Roman Agora.\n\nSaver Tip –\n\nTo access the Roman Forum and Hadrian’s LIbrary you will need to purchase tickets and if you have not purchased A group ticket package these fees can add up. Site entrance fees can range from $10 USD – $25 USD depending on the site. So here is the tip, unless you are a huge history buff, archeologist or big fan of ancient architecture don’t purchase tickets for these two sites. The city is elevated over the sites and they are pretty easy to see from the public walkway. instead just walk around the perimeter of the site and enjoy the ancient beauty from the outside. You get most of the benefits without the entrance fee price.\n\nSunset, a show, & dinner\n\nBy this time the sun should be about to set and the sunsets in Athens are incredible! There are many rooftop bars that are perfect for catching a sunset that overlooking Athens and Acropolis. You could make reservations at A for Athens which also serves as a hotel in the heart of Monastiraki. Another option is 360 Cocktail Bar.\n\nThese options are a bit overdone for us and we opted for a less traditional route. Instead, we enjoyed the sunset from a theater rooftop! The show is called Madea & Other Friends I Made in Athens by Kolion. This was a super fun, live local, low-budget theater production. The tickets cost about $15 and they offered free wine with stunning sunset views. Check to see if they are performing during your stay!\n\nThen head to a late dinner around the corner at Taverne Platanos or Anafiotika Cafe for some live music, greek cuisine, and cocktails.\n\nIf you want to keep the night going stop by Brettos in Plaka for some traditional Greek Ouzo! They have tastings too.\n\nDAY 2:\n\nBe sure to put your walking shoes on, again!\n\nGrab a traditional Greek breakfast of Greek yogurt or a pastry with a cappuccino freddo at a local cafe near your accommodations to start your day.\n\nTemple of Zeus and National Garden\n\nStart by walking through Hadrian’s Arch and the temple of Zeus (can see everything from outside and in my opinion no need to buy a ticket unless you already have some kind of attraction bundle pass). Continue your walk to see Panathenaic Stadium. The stadium was built in 566 BC and was refurbished in 1896 and was the first site for the modern-day Olympics. It is a slight detour, but a cool site to see.\n\nDo an about-face and walk back through the National Garden towards Lycabettus Hill. The National Garden is beautiful and has a lot of shaded trees, exotic animals, and botanical gardens. If you have the time a little stroll through the garden is nice.\n\nIf you are a fast walker and want to take a small detour you can try to catch the changing of the guards at The Hellenic Parliament. At the end of the National Garden once you hit the Benaki Museum, head East for about 10 minutes and you should walk right by The Parliament. The changing of the guards takes place right around here at the tomb of the unknown soldier. The Evzone, or Greek soldiers, change guards every Sunday morning at 11 AM in an official ceremony.\n\nLycabettus Hill & Lunch\n\nOnce you are done watching the changing of the guards get back on track to Lycabettus Hil. This infamous hill is the highest peak in all of Athens. There is a small cafe and the Chapel of St. George at the top. Not to mention a fantastic view of the Athenian basin! There is also a theater that hosts concerts on summer nights.\n\nAfter you snap some pics, enjoy the view it is time to descend from the hill and grab a bite. I recommend stopping at Cheese Kostarelos – Kolonaki for some of the best cheese you have ever had in your life! They also have several great local wines and artisan deli sandwiches. We had the oven-baked feta cheese and it was delicious!\n\nOn your way back, if you are up for it, pop over to Athens Central Municipal Market. It is a huge market that takes up two sides of the street. It is full of fresh meat, fish, nuts, spices, fruits, veggies and so much more all brought in by the locals every morning! If you are planning to stay in Athens longer than 2 days and want to cook some meals at home this is the best place to find local produce at competitive prices.\n\nHead back to your hotel for a nap or find a nice quiet place to relax for a bit after all of that walking and get ready for a fun night out in the Pyssiri or Psiri neighborhood!\n\nDinner & Drinks in Psiri\n\nPsiri is a cool neighborhood to go out in and has a young, local, and bohemian vibe. There are a lot of concepts, thrift, and vintage shops as well as trendy cafe bars and restaurants. If you are into the beer scene there is not much of it in Athens, but Beer Time is great and has some delicious craft beers. We recommend checking this brewery out before dinner.\n\nAfter pre-dinner drinks head to Avli Restaurant Psiri. This restaurant is kind of hard to find as it is located in a small alleyway. Either get there early or make reservations as it fills up quickly and there is not much space. Most plates are smaller and served family-style. You have to try the fried meatballs! If you are up for it after dinner, check out some live music and have a pint at James Joyce Irish Pub.\n\nBONUS\n\nIf you are looking for more historical sites to see another one we recommend besides Acropolis is the Ancient Greek Agora of Athens or the Ancient Agora. There are grounds to walk around, a small church, a museum, the Stoa of Attalos, and the Temple of Hephaestus. This one is worth paying the entrance fee as everything can not be seen from the outside and the free museum has a great historical timeline of the history of Greece. We recommend about 1.5 hours here.\n\nCost Breakdown:\n\nAverage Small Breakfast – $10\n\nAverage Lunch & Dinner (no alcohol) – $15\n\nAthens Ticket Package – $33 (indivudal purchase price below)\n\nAcropolis & Slopes Entrance Fee – $23 (does not include entrance to the Museum)\n\nHadrian’s Library Entrance Fee – $7\n\nRoman Agora Entrance Fee- $7\n\nTemple of Zeus Entrance Fee – $10\n\nAncient Greek Agora – $12 (includes museum and archeological site)\n\nMadea and Other Friends I Made in Athens Ticket – $20\n\nHadrian’s Arch – FREE\n\nLycabettus Hill – FREE\n\nFilopappou Hill – FREE\n\nMarkets – FREE\n\nHistorical Site Ticket Package Options\n\nThere are a lot of different options, but I broke down two main ones below. These are both self-guided and do not include a tour guide. There are some great guided tour options as well. For example, this option to bike and tour the city for about $45 USD is great! The tour is about 3 hours.\n\nOption 1\n\nAthens Ticket Package (~$33 USD) – This ticket package includes an entrance and self-guided tour to 7 historical sites and landmarks. The sites are; Acropolis and slopes (museum not included), Ancient Agora and museum, Roman Agora, Hadrian’s Library, Olympieion (Temple of Zeus), Kerameikos, and Aristotle’s Lykeion This inclusive ticket package can be purchased at any of the above-mentioned sites and is valid for up to 5 days.\n\nOption 2\n\nAthens City Pass – For about $60 USD for one day which includes access to Acropolis and the Acropolis museums, all the top sites you’ll want to see, Hop-On-Hop-Off bus ticket (for 48 hours), and up to 50% guided tours, food, and shopping. They do have other options that are more than one day, but the price increases as the available days increase. This is a good option if you don’t want to walk a lot and really want to try to cram it all in.\n\nMy recommendation would be to go with option one and pick a few paid sites you really want to see and then enjoy the free sites, culture, nature, and food! As for the paid historical sites, I would recommend seeing Acropolis and the Ancient Agora.\n\n*This information is from Summer 2021."
