As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.\n\nMy family recently had a chance to visit Athens, Greece, and it was absolutely amazing! There are so many incredible historical sites in Athens, Greece.\n\nThis famous European city is filled with some of the most iconic historical sites on Earth. The city is brimming with unearthed ruins, lost temples, and relics spanning from prehistoric times to today. As the ancient capital of the immensely influential Greek civilization, Athens played a pivotal role in developing democracy, philosophy, literature, art, theatre, and mathematics.\n\nHistorical Sites in Athens, Greece\n\nIt’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the options of places to see when you visit Athens. So, I created this list of some of the more famous historical sites in Athens, Greece, so you can see what they look like and what they offer.\n\nMany of these locations are perfect half-day excursions for a family. You can organize these destinations as pairs and spend a whole day seeing two sights. Be sure to check websites for cost and hours of operation. Also, many places are outside, so watch the weather and dress accordingly. And if you love cats, make sure to keep your eyes open. There are a lot of stray cats in Athens!\n\nList of Iconic Historical Sites in Athens, Greece\n\nHere is my list of top Athens historical sites. All of these are located in Athens, except for #15, Temple of Poseidon, located in Cape Sounion on the coast about 1 hour and 15 minutes south of Athens. However, I just couldn’t leave it out. As we flew over it on the way home, I was sad we couldn’t fit it in!\n\nThe first five items are all part of the Acropolis, so one Acropolis entry ticket gets you into all of them!\n\nYou can check many of these off your list with the fav favorite Acropolis and 6 Archaeological Sites Combo Ticket!\n\n1. Parthenon Atop The Acropolis\n\nThe Parthenon, crowning the Acropolis, is the quintessential symbol of ancient Greek architecture. Dedicated to the goddess Athena, this massive ancient temple showcases the pinnacle of classical design. The Parthenon sits atop a large hill called the Acropolis. It’s located near the heart of the tourist district in downtown Athens called the Plaka District, which is where we stayed during our trip.\n\nREAD: Choosing Where to Stay in the Plaka District\n\nAround and atop the Acropolis are numerous famous ruins, some of which we have highlighted here. Generally, the Parthenon is usually crowded with visitors, but the sheer scale of the structure and its significant place in ancient studies make it essential to view.\n\n2. Theater of Dionysus\n\nBuilt on the southern slope of the Acropolis, the Theater of Dionysus is the birthplace of Greek tragedy. This ancient amphitheater, carved into the natural landscape, witnessed the premieres of renowned plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Its stone seats and stage resonate with the echoes of performances that captivated ancient audiences.\n\n3. Temple of Nike\n\nThe Temple of Athena Nike, perched on the southwestern side of the Acropolis, is a small yet elegant structure dedicated to the goddess of victory. Its graceful Ionic columns and friezes are gorgeous and perfect for a picture. Likewise, the temple played a crucial role in commemorating Athenian triumphs in battle.\n\n4. Erechtheion\n\nThe Erechtheion is a temple dedicated to Athena and Poseidon and located on the northern side of the Acropolis. Its distinguishing feature is the Caryatid Porch, supported by beautiful ornately carved female statues. The Erechtheion’s unique design highlighted its spiritual significance in the lives of ancient Greeks.\n\n5. Propylaia\n\nAt the end of the path leading up to the top of the Acropolis, visitors pass through the Propylaia. This massive structure served as the monumental entrance to the Acropolis. The Propylaia is a masterful blend of Doric and Ionic architecture, and its striking architectural design creates a dramatic introduction to the sacred religious site.\n\n6. Temple of Olympian Zeus\n\nThe colossal Temple of Olympian Zeus, dedicated to the king of the gods, Zeus, features towering Corinthian columns that once made it the largest temple in ancient Greece. Its construction spanned centuries, reflecting the grand aspirations of ancient Greek architecture.\n\nYou can easily walk to the Temple of Olympian Zeus and the Arch of Hadrian from the Plaka District. Pairing these two sites together is a perfect 2-3 hour trip.\n\n7. Panathenaic Stadium\n\nConstructed entirely in marble, the Panathenaic Stadium hosted the Panathenaic Games and later the first modern Olympic Games in 1896. Its impressive structure, with seating for tens of thousands, is a testament to ancient athletic traditions and the enduring spirit of the Olympic movement.\n\nWe really enjoyed this historical site in Athens. Our entire family had a great time climbing the stadium stairs, exploring the tunnels the athletes used to use, and standing on the Olympic podiums. It was very inspiring! We even ran time trials on the track! The Stadium is open and accessible to explore, so it’s a great place to exercise and pretend to be an Olympic athlete.\n\nYou can even book an Olympic Games Workout during your visit to the Panathenaic Stadium!\n\n8. Agora of Ancient Athens\n\nThis was one of our favorite sites to visit. The heart of ancient Athens, theAncient Agora, was a bustling center for political, commercial, and cultural affairs. This open-air park of ancient ruins provides a glimpse into the daily life in ancient Greece. It is perfect for walking, exploring, and seeing many archeological sites.\n\nYou can find two of the more popular Athens attractions at the Agora, the Stoa of Attalos and the Temple of Hephaestus, which I discuss below.\n\nREAD: Visiting the Ancient Agora of Athens\n\n9. Temple of Hephaestus\n\nNestled within the Ancient Agora, the Temple of Hephaestus is a well-preserved Doric temple dedicated to the god of craftsmanship. Its harmonious proportions and intricate friezes are a testament to ancient Greek artistry and devotion. We loved this place because it’s one of the few large, well-preserved temples you can walk right up to and photograph up close.\n\n10. Stoa of Attalos\n\nThe Stoa of Attalos, a reconstructed covered walkway in the Ancient Agora, now houses a museum displaying artifacts from the area. Its two levels of columns and open interior create a harmonious space that once served as a vibrant hub for social and commercial activities.\n\nThe Stoa Museum is fantastic, and it was one highlight of our trip. It’s filled with artifacts ranging from vases, figurines, statues, and busts.\n\n11. Ancient Cemetery of Kerameikos\n\nThe Ancient Cemetery of Kerameikos served as the burial ground for ancient Athens, featuring tombs and monuments that offer a poignant glimpse into ancient Greek burial practices. It’s one of the more fascinating ruins in Athens, but it receives relatively few visitors.\n\nHere, archaeologists have discovered columns of temples, marble statues, remains of public buildings, funeral offerings, and thousands of tombs. It was the primary cemetery of ancient Athens from the 9th century BCE until the Roman times.\n\n12. National Archaeological Museum\n\nThe National Archaeological Museum stands as a treasure trove, housing an extensive collection of artifacts from various periods of Greek history. From exquisite sculptures to ancient pottery, the museum provides a comprehensive journey through the country’s archaeological heritage.\n\nThis is a fantastic half-day trip to one of the most respected archeological museums in the world. The legendary Antikythera Mechanism and other notable works like the golden Mask Of Agamemnon are here. Maybe it’s because it’s indoor and a bit removed from the popular tourist area, but this is one of the most overlooked historical sites in Athens, Greece\n\nREAD: Visiting the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, Greece\n\n13. Arch of Hadrian\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian, erected in honor of Roman Emperor Hadrian, marks the transition from ancient Athens to the new city. Its intricate reliefs and imposing structure are a tangible link between two epochs of history. You can stand right next to the Arch, so this is another excellent place to get that perfect selfie.\n\nThis is located right off a busy street and does not require any sort of entry ticket!\n\n14. Roman Agora\n\nThe Roman Agora served as a marketplace during the Roman period. The Tower of the Winds, a clocktower and weather vane, is a notable structure within this archaeological site, providing insights into ancient timekeeping.\n\nThe Roman Agora sits between the Greek Agora and the Parthenon, near the gorgeous Monastiraki District, making it easily tourable as you explore the area north of the Parthenon. Seeing all three of these locations is a perfect day-long excursion. Don’t miss Hadrian’s Library while you are there!\n\n15. Temple of Poseidon\n\nPerched on the sea cliffs of Cape Sounion, the Temple of Poseidon commands breathtaking views of the Aegean Sea. Dedicated to the god of the sea, Poseidon, this well-preserved temple offers a perfect vantage point for enjoying the stunning sunset over the water. It’s one of the most photographed ancient temples, and its location atop the cliffs overlooking the Aegean makes the 45-mile drive from Athens worth the trip.\n\nThere are quite a few Athens day trips offered from Athens to the Temple of Poseidon!\n\nDon’t Miss These Inconic Historical Sites in Athens, Greece\n\nFew places on Earth have more historical and archeological significance than Athens. Each ruin brings to life the immense influence of the ancient Greek civilization. Every stone whispers its own story, and each relic tells a tale.\n\nIt’s a magical place that transports visitors back thousands of years to the banks of the Aegean, where ancient master artisans hew white marble and proud people build high temples to their mighty gods. When you make your travel itinerary, be sure to schedule time to see some of these historical sites in Athens, Greece.\n\nYou may not be able to visit them all, but hopefully, this list will give you some idea of what to focus on in this beautiful city.
