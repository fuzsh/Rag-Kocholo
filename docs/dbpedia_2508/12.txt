1801 1875 Collector Curious Eccentric Facts Journalist

EDITORS COMMENTS

John Timbs, (1801-1875), an English journalist, writer, and avid collector of curious and eccentric facts, is depicted in this photograph. Timbs, born on February 2, 1801, in London, England, was a prolific author and journalist who made a name for himself by unearthing and sharing intriguing historical anecdotes and obscure trivia. Timbs' fascination with the unusual began at an early age, and he spent much of his life amassing a vast collection of rare books, manuscripts, and artifacts. He was particularly drawn to the strange, the bizarre, and the forgotten, and his writings often reflected his keen interest in the quirks and oddities of history. Timbs' first major work, "City of London," published in 1831, was a comprehensive guide to the history and folklore of London. It was followed by numerous other books, including "Strange Stories from English History," "The Antiquities of London and its Environs," and "Curiosities of London." Despite his success as a writer, Timbs' true passion was for collecting. He amassed a vast library of rare and obscure books, many of which were acquired from the sales of dissolved monasteries and other sources. Timbs' collection was so extensive that it was said to be one of the largest private collections in England. Timbs' legacy as a collector and writer continues to inspire and intrigue scholars and history buffs to this day. His work has been reprinted and translated into numerous languages, and his influence can be seen in the many modern-day publications that explore the strange and unusual corners of history. This photograph of John Timbs, taken in the mid-19th century, captures the essence of a man who dedicated his life to uncovering and sharing the hidden stories and secrets of the past. With a twinkle in his eye and a quill in his hand, Timbs remains a symbol of curiosity, wonder, and the enduring power of the written word.
