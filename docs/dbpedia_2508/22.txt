Born and raised in Seven Kings and having spent my entire working life in East and North East London I am delighted to be a part of the Care City Community Board in its endeavours to bring health and social care system partners together to introduce new ways of working for the benefit of our communities. I am passionate about identifying and addressing inequalities, an aim I know is shared by my colleagues on the Board who offer a rich and diverse range of life and work experiences.
