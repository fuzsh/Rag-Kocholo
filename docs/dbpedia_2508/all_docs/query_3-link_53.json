A. R. BAYLEY. DINWIDDIE FAMILY (12 S. vii. 7). The Dinwiddies were an old Scottish family possessing lands of the same name in Dumfriesshire, at which there is now a railway station. Of the Border Mosstroopers they seem to have been more or less a turbulent lot, and often at feud with their neighbours. Thomas Dunweedy was slain at his own place of Dunweedy in 1504. Eight 7/ears later his successor, Thomas, was slain in Edinburgh, and Thomas his son in 1512 got a gift of the lands for good and thankful service done to the King. Robert Dinwidy, son of a laird, was allowed to compound for the forcible theft of four horses, two candle-sticks, &c., and Nicholas D. for resetting Adam Corry, who is styled a common thief, was hanged. In 1543, Alexander Dinwooclie of that ilk suffered forfeiture for joining with the English, pro- bably at the battle of Haddenrig, or at the Rout of Solway Moss both in the year before. JEn 1564 John Dinwedy, ' uncle of Jane Dinwedy, the unmarried heiress, bound him- self to protect her. Jane was subsequently married to a John Maxwell, after which the lands of Dinwoodie seem to pass to the Maxwells, and the Dimtoodies disappear as landowners. But the name is not un- common in Scotland at this day. I should add that Robert Dinwiddie of North America in 1751 registered his arms with the Lyon King as follows : \" Parted per fess two landscapes, the first holding a wild Indian at full draught (sic), his bow bent marking at a stag standing at full gaze regardant proper ; the second holding the emblem of the earth, and in base the emblem of water with a ship under sail, within sight of and making towards a distant land representing America.\" This Robert was contemporary with the James Dinwiddie, mentioned by your corre- spondent, and the two may have been relatives. The arms are peculiar and seem to point to some occurrences in Robert's history of which there is probably now no record. As to the meaning of the name, Johnston, in his ' Place -Names of Scotland,' says it is perhaps from the Gaelic Dun bheadaig, hill of the gossip or wanton. Perhaps, my own idea is simpler. J. L. ANDERSON. ' The Scottish Nation, ' by James Macveigh (1888), vol. ii. p. 39, has the following paragraph : Dinwoodie or Dunwithie, a surname derived from lands of that name in the parish of Apple- garth, Dumfriesshire, formerly possessed by a family that continued there a long time. In the Bagman Boll appears the name of Alleyn Din- withie, supposed by Nisbet to be of the family of that ilk in that county. At beginning of sixteenth century, the lairds of Dinwoodie seem to have been at feud with the Jar-dines, and to have suffered much from the violence of their neighbours in those unsettled times. At the Justice- Ayre held at Dumfries in August 1504, John Jardine in Sibbald-beside, and Bobert Brig, living with Alexander Jardine, produced a remission from the King for art and part of the cruel slaughter of Thomas Dunwedy of that ilk, at his place of Dunwedy. About 1512 \" the Laird Dinwiddie was slayne in Edinburgh by two persones, who eschaped by taking the sanctuarie of Holyrood house, a saufgaird much respected in those days.\" (Anderson's MS. Hist. Adv. Lib.). Sir James Balfour calls him the laird of Drumweiche, and says he was killed \" by the Jardans.\" See \" Pit- cairn's Criminal Trials,\" under the first named date, which contains also the following entries : Bobert Dunwedy, son of the laird of Dunwedy, and Gavin Johnstone were admitted to the King's composition to satisfy parties for art and part of the stout grief of 4 horses, 2 candlesticks, and sundry other goods from Bartholomew Grlendun- wyne, in company with the laird of Johnstone and his accomplices ; and Nicholas Dunwedy, in"
