        "text": "This is the *Haplotype of Thomas Thames born ca. 1705/10, the patriarch of this family. We consider this to be \"The Thomas Thames Family Modal Haplotype\".\n\n(393=13)(390=25)(19=15)(391=10)(385a=11)(385b=14) (426=12)(388=12)(439=11)(389-1=14)(392=11)(389-2=31)(458=15)(459a=9)(459b=10)(455=11)(454=11) (447=23)(437=14)(448=20)(449=30)(464a=12)(464b=15)(464c=15)(464d=16)(460=10)(GATA H4=11)(YCA II a=19)(YCA II b=21)(456=16)(607=16)(576=18)(570=18)(CDY a=35)(CDY b=39)(442=12)(438=11)\n\n\"Thomas Thames Family Modal Haplotype*\"\n\nWilliam Glenn Thames*\n\nJames Robert Thames* (cousin of Charlotte T. Van Hoozier)\n\nLee Hamilton Thames* (cousin of Julie T. Howell)\n\nTerry Carlton Thames* (cousin of Paul & bros.)\n\nJoseph Amos Thames* (second cousin of James Robert Thames)\n\nRichard Blake Thames*\n\nRobert Wayne Thames* (brother of Paul Thames)\n\nHarold Ray Thames* (brother of Paul Thames)\n\nJimmie Delonia Thames* (brother of Paul Thames)\n\nAllen F. Thames* (cousin of Sybil Dixon)\n\nWilburne E. Thames* (cousin of Annette T. Adler)\n\nMartin Thames*\n\nALL TWELVE OF THE ABOVE CARRY THE THAMES FAMILY MODAL HAPLOTYPE!\n\nThe surprising thing about the Thames test results up to this point, is that twelve of those participating have the “Thomas Thames Family Modal Haplotype”.\n\nThe DNA program test results show us that John Thames and Joseph Thames the sons of “Ole Thomas born circa 1705/10” both had his Haplotype.\n\nJohn Thames Jr. the son of John Thames carried the family modal Haplotype.\n\nJesse Thames, William Thames, Thomas Thames and Samuel Thames the sons of Joseph Thames carried the family modal Haplotype.\n\nThe project results to date are that no individual with the surname Timms, Tims or Timbs has results consistant with the tested members of the Thames family.\n\nBased on the results of this testing, we have arrived at the conclusion that Amos Tims b. circa 1684, of VA and an immigrant from Northhamptonshire, England is very probably the progenitor of a branch of the SC Tims family, as some of them have claimed. The testing results conclusively prove he had no biological connection to the Thames family.\n\nNo Thames tested has documentation beyond Thomas Thames of Bladen Co. NC nor do they claim Amos Timms/Tims of VA as an ancestor.\n\nWe now do have enough Timms/Tims/Timbs participants to determine a \"Tims Family Modal Haplotype\" for the six Tims participants in Haplogroup R1b. This is no longer speculative. We have accomplished this with today's test results of Bob Tims. It is very difficult to determine Tims family lines, we have too few participants.\n\nWe do now know, through the test results, that within the Timms/Tims/Timbs group we are indicating four very different families. We are finding that they belong to four Haplogroups R1b, G, G2, and I.\n\nWe are now able to draw some conclusions about a few things. We have six participants with the surname Tims that appear to belong to the same biological family. Our participant with the surname Timms belongs to a different biological family than the Tims. Our participant with the surname Timbs also belongs to a different biological family than the Tims. We have one participant with the surname Tims that does not belong to the same biological family as do the first six mentioned above.\n\nThe members of R1b are believed to be the descendants of the first modern humans who entered Europe about 35,000-40,000 years ago. R1b is the most common Y haplogroup in Europe, more than half of men of European descent belong to R1b. It is thought that they spent the last \"Last Glacial Maximum\" on the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe testing of our Thames participants are bearing fruit. We now know that one is a biological Thames through his gr gr gr grandmother but was adopted from another family. His Y-Chromosome testing shows that biologically his gr gr gr grandfather had the surname Frierson. He is also in Haplogroup R1b.\n\nWe have twenty-two biological Thames participants results that are complete. The \"The Most Recent Common Ancestor\" of all twenty-two is proved by the DNA testing and paper documentation to be Thomas Thames born ca. 1705/10.\n\nSeventeen of the participants have their \"Most Recent Common Ancestor\" as Joseph Thames b. ca. 1732. Two of these participants are fifth cousins and have an exact 37/37 Allele match. That means we have found the Haplotype of Joseph Thames b. ca. 1732, possibly in NC.\n\nThree of our participants with SC ties are documented as being descendants of John Thames b. ca. 1747 in NC the son of Thomas Thames b. ca. 1705/10. Their test results are reported and that documentation has been verified. John is the brother of Joseph Thames b. ca. 1732. The father of John and Joseph Thames is Thomas Thames b. ca. 1705/10. With the results of their DNA tests we discovered the Haplotype of Thomas, thereby pushing the \"Thames Family Modal Haplotype\" back one more generation. A third participant whose roots can be traced to SC has the \"Thomas Thames Family Modal Haplotype\". He is a descendant of Friendly Thames who went to GA from SC. We don't know which of the three brothers that went to SC was his ancestor John, Thomas or Amos.\n\nWe have four participants with a SC heritage that are the descendants of Thomas Thames Jr. born circa 1740/42 through his son Samuel and Samuel's son Esquire. These four show a common mutation at CDYb.\n\nThe Thames Haplogroup is R1a. The Thames came from southwest Norway to England as Vikings. The Vikings started raiding in Great Britain shortly after the Romans left.\n\nIn our opinion we have confirmed the Norse/Viking connection. What is now coming to light is that the Thames Haplotype may indicate they were Danish/Vikings. The Danes settled along the English Channel in about 840 BC in what then was called Danelaw. The other Vikings were called Norwegan/Vikings and settled across central England in what was called York.\n\nWe have contacted a very nice man, Dr. David Faux, who is running an extensive \"Shetland Island\" family DNA program. That is where the Norse/Vikings first settled on their way to raid and pillage in Great Britain. We are very pleased with the email we received from him in answer to our query.\n\n\"Indeed Walt, it does appear that the R1a in your study are Norse of the variety I have called Asian (due to the resemblance to the modal values of Central Asia). The 19,21 for YCAIIa,b is classic Norse and likely Asian. It is not been observed in Eastern Europe (e.g., Poland) for example. The signatures are almost identical to most of my R1a Shetlanders who have \"son\" surnames.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nDavid.\" (Faux)\n\nResearch papers by geneticists conclude that very probably the forefather of all R1a's was born in the Ukraine during the \"Last Glacial Maximum\" about 15,000 years ago. The theory has also been put forward that the subsequent spread of haplogroup R1a across Eurasia may have been connected to the domestication of the horse about 5000 years ago. This theory was put forth by Spencer Wells in his book \"THE JOURNEY OF MAN a genetic odyssey\". If Wells' theory is correct, the R1a Haplogroup may have ridden on horseback from one end of Eurasia to the other.\n\nSpencer Wells is presently working in conjunction with National Geographic Magazine, Family Tree DNA, IBM and a charitable foundation to further study the migration of man through DNA Y Chromosome testing. Any of our family program participants that wish to join this endeavor may go to their personal web page where they will find a feature that, for a fee, will allow them to upload their results to the \"Genographic Project\"."
