Michael Lahiff was charged by Kate Lahiff, his wife, with having left her without any means of support since the 14th of June last. Mr. Russell for complainant, and Mr. Lysaght for defendant. Mr. Lysaght said defendant had paid towards the support of complainant as long as he was able to do so ; he was not at present able to contribute towards her support, but he was willing to take her back, and provide her with the best home be could. Mr. Russell said from what had previously transpired it was impossible for complainant to live with defendant. Complainant deposed that defendant was her husband; she was not willing to live with him again; he had agreed to give her 10s per week, and she had received that, amount up to the 14th June, since which date she had received no money. To. M. Lysaght: I could not again live with defendant from the way he previously treated me and the way he lived; I do not know whether he has been in work since he left Mount Pleasant Company's employ; a deed of separation was drawn up between us, and defendant fulfilled its contents for some time; I do not know whether or not he is able to carry them out now. Charles C. Russell produced, the deed of separation between the parties, and William Richardson deposed to having received money at different times from defendant, which he paid over to complainant. Defendant deposed that he had been employed as clerk at the Mount Pleasant colliery until November last, but had lost the situation owing to the action taken by complainant at a previous court; he had signed a deed of separation, agreeing to pay complainant 10s per week he had paid altogether about £15 himself, and others had paid money for him ; he had means when he lost his employment, but now had none ; he had not earned a penny since he left it, although he had tried as hard as any man to obtain work ; he was now living upon what was earned by his children and what he obtained from friends ; if he had the means he would either take his wife back or contribute towards her support. To Mr. Russell: I am a plaintiff in a lawsuit with two others, but do not expect anything out of it ; I have given a solicitor my interest to carry on the suit ; Carrie Shannon is still living in my house; she is the woman who caused the separation between my wife and myself ; if my wife came back, Miss Shannon would leave ; my children are aged 17, 16, and 14 years, the two eldest being girls. To Mr. Lysaght : The lawsuit is an equity suit touching the validity of my late father's will, by which he left everything to his wife ; his three children dispute the will; my interest is an imaginary one. Defendant was ordered to pay 10s weekly into the hands of Senior-sergeant Grieve for a period of twelve months. Illawarra Mercury (Wollongong, NSW : 1856 - 1950) Saturday 17 July 1897 p 2\n\nDEATH OF MRS LAHIFF.\n\nDEATH has claimed another to pass over to the great majority, on this occasion in the person of Mrs Katherine Lahiff, which occurred at the residence of her sisters (Mrs O'Connell and Mrs O'Mara), “Acacia” Cottage, Tumut, on Friday morning, at 7.20 o'clock, at the age of 69 years. The deceased, who was also sister of Ald J. E. Madigan, of Tumut, and Mr. John Madigan, of Red Hill, was born at Yass, and in 1887 married the late Michael Lahiff, at Tumut, and went to Wollongong to live, where she remained until, four years ago, her health began to fail and on medical advice returned to the sub-alpine regions. Here she improved greatly, and only occasionally required to consult Dr. Mason, her medical adviser, for minor ailments. About a month ago she again became ill, and Dr. Browne, and subsequently Dr. Weedon, attended her ; but despite all they did to restore her to health, aided by the nursing of her sisters and the kindnesses from many friends, the vital spark gradually flickered out. She received spiritual consolation from Frs. Keating and McDonnell, and also the Nuns of the Convent, of Mercy, Father Keating administering the rites at the bedside. One sister, Mrs. P. Kiley of Red Hill, predeceased her. The funeral took place on Saturday afternoon, the remains being interred in the Roman Catholic portion of the Old cemetery. Rev. Father Keating officiated at the grave and Mr. Jas Elphick directed the funeral. Ald. J. E. Madigan and Mr. J. Madigan (brothers), Mr. P. Kiley (brother-in-law) and Messrs Maurice, Percy, Norman and Vincent Madigan and Mr. J. R. Kiley of Darah Station, Cootamundra (nephews) were the bearers.\n\nA Requiem Mass was celecrated in the Roman Catholic Church, Tumut, yesterday morning, Fr. Keating officiating. We tender the bereaved our deepest sympathy. The Tumut Advocate and Farmers and Settlers' Adviser (NSW : 1903 - 1925) Tuesday 20 May 1913 p 2\n\nLahiff Mary\n\nd. 12/8/1885 Wollongong\n\nm. Lahiff\n\n(m) John Lahiff\n\nSudden Death. Yesterday morning, Mrs. Lahiff, mother of Mr. John Lahiff, fruiterer, of Crown-street, was found dead in her bed. On Tuesday' night she complained to her son of feeling unwell, and before retiring to bed asked him for a bottle of lemonade. This he gave her, and she then went to her room. Mrs. Lahiff was heard moving about late at night, and about breakfast time, as she had not made her appearance, Mr. Lahiff went into her room to call her, and found her dead, but not then cold. He immediately sent for Dr. Lee, who had previously been attending her. The deceased lady was subject to fits, and it was only a week or so ago that she was taken suddenly ill with a fit on the cliffs overlooking the basin, at which time she was taken to Mr. James Keirnan's, where she was attended to for several days until sufficiently recovered to be removed to her son's residence. We understand Dr. Lee then expressed the belief that the deceased would very likely be carried off by a similar attack, a belief which she herself shared. The matter having been reported to the authorities, and Dr. Lee giving a certificate, an inquest was dispensed with.

On that day Miss Usher, who was a guest at the hotel, had gone up the river for an outing with Miss Farey. Mr. Farey was left at home, and he fell asleep. Whilst he was asleep the accused was upstairs attending to the bed rooms, and was in Miss Usher's bedroom. At the head of the bed, in a wall-pocket, were Miss Usher's gold watch and two gold guards, which she had had there for the day. After a time smoke was seen issuing out of Miss Usher's bedroom, and on Mr. Farey and his man rushing upstairs they found Miss Farey's bed on fire. Some of the woodwork near the bed was also burnt. Questioned by Mr. Farey, accused said she did not cause the fire and she did not know how it originated. When Miss Usher returned in the evening she missed her gold watch and guards. Accused said she had not seen them, and know nothing about them. When arrested, accused said to police: 'I am a widow, and I come from near Wollongong. I am a respectable woman, but, unfortunately, now 1 have to work for my living.' In reply to questions by Plain-clothes Senior sergeant Bradley, who conducted the prosecution, the accused said she had been in a number of places about Sydney as general servant since she came from Wollongong. In most of those places fires had occurred whilst she was there, and it had been alleged that jewellery had been stolen in those places at the time of the fires She was now out under the First Offenders' Act, having been sentenced to six months' imprisonment for stealing jewellery at one of the houses where she was general servant. She stole brooches. Different men had visited her at the houses where she had been in service, and had been in her bedroom. A man had visited her at Mr. Farey's, and was in her bedroom late at night. She wrote a letter to him, in which she called herself his wife, and told him about the fire, and in which she said only herself, ' the boss,' and his man were in the house at the time of the fire. She did not remember being in a place at Wollongong where there was a fire. Mr. Wilshire told Mr. Dillon that it would not make any difference if he made a statement, for this was clearly a prima facie case. He committed accused to take her trial at the Quarter Sessions at Darlinghurst, commencing on April 2. Bail would be allowed — accused in £80, and two sureties in £40 each, or one in £80. Accused was then further charged with stealing a gold watch and two gold guards, valued £25, the property of Elizabeth Lily Usher, from the latter's bedroom on the day of the fire. On this charge accused was also committed to take her trial at the Quarter Sessions at Darlinghurst, bail being allowed as in the last case. The accused was subsequently removed by the police to Darlinghurst gaol. Illawarra Mercury (Wollongong, NSW: 1856 - 1950) Saturday 31 March 1900 p 2\n\nAcquitted.\n\nAt the Quarter Sessions, Sydney, on Wednesday, Mary Ellen Lahiff (formerly of Wollongong), pleaded not guilty to a charge that on March 18 at Leichhardt she did steal one watch and two watch chains, the property of Elizabeth Usher. Mr. J. J. Dillon appeared for accused, and succeeded in establishing such contradictions amongst certain witnesses for the Grown that at the conclusion of the case for the prosecution his Honor asked the jury without calling upon the defence, if they had agreed upon a verdict. The jury, without leaving the box, returned a verdict of not guilty, and accused was discharged.

LANCE.\n\nCruelty and adultery with some persons unknown to the petitioner were the grounds upon which Elizabeth Ada Lance (formerly Guy) sued, before Mr. Justice Walker, for a dissolution of her marriage with Alexander Lance, which ceremony was performed at Newtown, on November 16, 1933, according to the rites of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. The petitioner stated that she was under age when they were married, and her parents being dead, a written consent was given to the ceremony taking place by her guardian. In October last they were living at Paddington, and on the 11th of that month her husband came home to dinner, and said he was going to the theatre. At first he said he was going with a friend, and a little later that he was going with a lady. He never came home that night (Friday). On the Saturday night he went to kiss her good-night, and she refused to let him do so. He remained away from home on the Saturday night, and returned to his dinner on the Sunday. He remained at home that night, and during the early part of it he asked for the £14 he had given her on the Friday. She asked him for £2 to purchase something for the children, and he told her to 'Go to ? and get it; he would not give it to her.' When she asked him not to be going on as he had, for the sake of the children, he said he intended to 'keep that woman,' and if she mentioned the matter to his people he would sell up the home. On the Sunday night (October 13) he went upstairs, and tried to kick her down. He went out on the Monday morning, and did not return home till Tuesday night. He remained at home that evening. With the exception of the Sunday and Tuesday nights in October, he had not slept at home since. He used to come to dinner every day, and leave immediately after. She saw him with a certain woman in William-street, about Christmas time, and again with the same person in Ox ford-street about the beginning of the present year. When she saw him with the woman in Oxford-street he raised his hat to her, and when she asked him why he dared raise his hat to her when he was in that woman's company, he replied, 'She is as good as you are, and better.' Sometime later, from something she had been told, she asked him why he had dared to take the woman to Newcastle as his wife, where she (petitioner) was so well known. When he asked her if she intended suing for a divorce, she told him she had placed the matter in the hands of a solicitor. When the petition was served on him, he admitted that every word in it was true. On one occasion she saw him on the balcony of a house in Darlinghurst-road with the same woman, and the following morning she saw him leave the house between 8 and 9 o'clock. She went to the landlady, and asked who the gentle man was who had just left her house, and she replied it was 'Mr. — — , who occupies the balcony room. Prior to October last, she had not lived with her husband as man and wife for over twelve months. The cause was not hers. From documents she had seen, her husband's earnings averaged £10 a week. His Honour granted a decree nisi, returnable in three months, the petitioner to have the custody of the children (3). The respondent was ordered to pay the costs of the suit, and to give the petitioner 30s a week permanent alimony.

JOHN HARBAND.\n\nThis was a summons for assault. Mr. Montague appeared for complainant, who pleaded not guilty.\n\nEva Rosina Harband, the complainant, deposed that she was the wife of defendant, and lived with him at Junee. On last Saturday morning at breakfast time defendant said, “You had five or six new dresses a few days ago” Complainant said, “I don't know where they are.” Defendant then hit her across the face with a wet towel. The defendant said, “You must have given the dresses away to the neighbours, as you feed the neighbours.” Complainant told defendant he would do it once too often. Defendant then knocked her over a stool, and broke the stool. He then caught her by the throat, and said if she did not clear out he would murder her. He dragged her along the floor by her hair.\n\nBy Mr. Montague: Complainant lived in George-street, Junee. The neighbors saw defendant treat her in the manner stated.\n\nThey had been married three years, and had two children. Mrs. Simms and Mrs. Monkham saw this assault. Complainant did not take a knife to defendant. Defendant did drink, but was not drunk when bhe assaulted her. She had been staying in Mrs. Simm's house since the assault. She had not a bad temper. Her husband was at home on Sunday.\n\nFor the defence: John Harband, the defendant, deposed that on Saturday morning he got up to his breakfast, Complainant had cooked part of it in a dirty saucepan.\n\nHe told complainant it would not do, and asked her to pour him out a cup of tea. He did not catch the complainant by the throat, or by the hair, but by the right wrist to take a knife from her hand. They were close together. He then let complainant go. Complainant threatened to do for defendant on the first opportunity. When he asked complainant to pour him out a cup of tea she refused.\n\nThe bench dismissed the information.

On the papers his mother states that all 5 of her children had been admitted to the Benevolent Soc. Asylum, and that the father gave nothing for the support of his children. She is listed as ‘keeping a brothel, independently’.\n\nThere are entries on Ancestry Family Trees that state John Harband died in NSW and was buried in Canterbury N.Z. this is incorrect.

Particularly was this so in regard to music and at concerts and Eisteddfods she was always an interested and enthusiastic attendant, and it is certain she derived pronounced pleasure from accompanying on her rounds, her talented daughter, Miss Hilma, so well-known as a teacher of pianoforte. However, death surely came as a happy release, after deceased had bravely contended against the inevitable. A native of the district, she was a daughter of the late Joseph and Mrs. Fowler, latter being a much respected resident of Chenhall Street, Woonona, and there are many other family relatives, including the well-known Southall family. There is much sympathy for the widower, and for the two daughters — Hilma and Myrtle (Mrs. W.
