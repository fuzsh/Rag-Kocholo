        "text": "HITCHCOCK, SHELDON, BENZING, BRECKENRIDGE, STEARNS\n\nI've been researching the HITCHCOCK line and have found that Henry Hobart HITCHCOCK, b. 1843 Medina County, married Eleanor BRECKENRIDGE and settled in Lorain County, on her father's farm near Grafton. I've done everything but cross a few tee's to get ancestry back to original immigrant, Luke HITCHCOCK of New Haven, CT. Maternal lines trace back to Mayflower. I'd like to find Hobart's descendants to add to my GEDCOM + share information. Old family letters indicate that the bible of Hobart's father, Daniel Bristol HITCHCOCK, was owned by either Clarence or Willis. Hobart's children: Clarence Pohlman HITCHCOCK b. 30 Aug. 1868 in Grafton, m. Christine (Unknown); children Marie, Ralph, and Dorothy, maybe others. Willis NelsonSON, maybe others but unlikely. I have a letter describing their home in 1912. I believe I met Eleanor at her home in Grafton in 1957 - her married name could perhaps be SHELDON or SHELTON (memory fades). Howard Hobart HITCHCOCK, b. 18 June, 1874 in Grafton, m. Della STEARNS, moved to Brunswick, buried in Medina County, died 1933. I have no knowledge of children. Dwight Bristol HITCHCOCK, b. 19 April 1880, m. Carrie (Unknown). No knowledge of children. I am a descendant of Henry Hobart HITCHCOCK's sister, Mary Amelia HITCHCOCK ROSENBERRY.\n\nErva Hitchcox Barton 31 Dec 1998\n\nEINIG\n\nPaul and Maria EINIG arrived in the United States, on the Albany, from Prussia in 1841. They were accompanied by Bartholomaus age 15 (who married Madgalena SCHNEIDER) , John age 14 (who married Mary Kremer), Emeline age 30 (can't read her married name) and Margaret age 28 (who may have married a Baker). Thanks to this wonderful Lorain Co. site, a descendant of John EINIG has shared wonderful information as has a descendant of Bartholomaus' wife. Bartholomaus EINIG was a recipient of land in Florida through the Homestead Act and so for many years my dear 81 year old mother-in-law thought of the Einigs as Floridians. She is wondering if there are other Einig descendants who are checking Lorain County for this name. She is waiting patiently for a determination of the town in Germany from whence the Einigs emigrated.\n\nPat Platz 31 Dec 1998\n\nWEBER, KOEPKE, SHORT\n\nHi there, I'm resubmitting my query about my family; I'm looking for more information about William WEBER, born 1876 in Vincennes, Indiana; moved to Amherst, Lorain Co. OHIO about 1896 where he was music teacher of the Lutheran school. He married Katherine (Catherine) KOEPKE, (b. 1876, d. 1919 of appendicitis); and had two daughters, Mathilde (Matilda) and Anna. Katherine's father was Karl KOEPKE, but I don't know of siblings. Matilda married a Harland MARTIN; Anna married Herman SHORT; son of Henry SHORT and Augusta WARDESKA. Anna and Herman had two sons, James B. (living) and Ted R (b. 1932, d. 8/1998). Ted married Mary E. GINSBURG and had six children. I would like any information about siblings, parents etc. of the WEBERS, KOEPKES, and SHORTS. Thanks!\n\nAnna (Short) Hanson 31 Dec 1998\n\nREA, EMMONDS, SNYDER\n\nLucinda, her daughter and two sons, Johnston and Joseph REA, came to America from Ireland, through Canada, and Pennsylvania. In 1820 the brothers settled in Black River Township, Lorain County, Ohio. Johnston REA then moved westward to Florence Township in what is now Erie County and then to Wakeman, Huron County, Ohio. Joseph REA remained in Black River possibly moving to Elyria or at least having purchased property there until his death. I am seeking information on any of the following ancestors: Johnston REA b. 1790 Co Killybane, Fermanagh, Ireland, d. Jan. 3, 1881 Wakeman, Ohio m. (last wife) Lovina (?) from Rochester, PA. who was b. in 1802 (according to census information, d. April 4, 1884 Wakeman, Ohio. I am also looking for a Mary E. EMMONDS listed on Johnston's daughter's death certificate as being her mother. It also shows on another census a Mal___ as Johnston's wife (prior to Lovina). Children of Johnston: Olive Jane b. January 9, 1843 d. December 20, 1915 Wakeman, Ohio, m. William John TIMBS. Children: George m. Bertha CRAWFORD, Mary m.Henry METCALF, Ella m. John William ROCK, Alice b. 1880 d. 1881, Charles m.

Mary Cornelia Have no idea as to the name of the sister of Johnston and Joseph REA. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nMary McGinnis 30 Dec 1998\n\nGEDERT, RONAU\n\nMy g-grandfather, John Joseph GEDERT, emigrated between 1844-1848 and settled in Avon, Lorain Co., OH. On 28 Apr 1863 he married Magdalena RONAU in Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Avon. She had emigrated between 1856-1862. Their first 7 children were born there (on a farm, probably), then they moved to Monclova Twp., Lucas Co., near Maumee, OH, where their last 5 children were born. I have received information from Holy Trinity Church as to their marriage and the children's births/baptisms, but have had no luck in finding out exactly when either emigrated, what port from and where they landed here. Also, I don't know Magdalena's parents names; she was only 12 years old when she emigrated. John's (Jr.) was only 6 to 10 years old at the time he emigrated. The name may have been spelled GAEDERT. According to my aunt, his father was born in Russia, but I have scant other information that would necessarily help here. However, I'll enter what I do know: John Joseph GEDERT (Sr.), b 25 Jul 1792 (Danzig, W. Prussia? or Russia) d 08 May 1871 Avon, OH. Anna Katherina SCHMIDT b 25 Jul 1801 Kafenheim, Prausen d 28 May 1869 Avon, OH They were married about 1825 in Kafenheim, Prussia. If all 6 of their children were born there, and I think they were, they would have emigrated after June 1845. If anyone can help find answers to my questions, I'd sure appreciate it. The emigration part has been a dead end for us. Please email me at with your reply.\n\nVirginia Wysong 28 Nov 1998\n\nMCGEE, HARRINGTON, HERNDON, HALL\n\nI would appreciate any assistance in tracing my grandparents (both paternal and maternal). The names are: Alexander and Mary MCGEE and James and Rebecca HARRINGTON (also known as HERNDON). Both grandfathers were former slaves. James HARRINGTON served in the US Colored Troops where he was known as James HERNDON. He married Rebecca HALL in Oberlin. Alexander and Mary MCGEE came to Oberlin from Cleveland. They were among the founders of the Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Oberlin. James HARRINGTON (HERNDON) was a slave in North Carolina. I do not know the original place of birth of my other grandparents. James HARRINGTON came to Oberlin between 1865 and 1880. The MCGEE family came to Oberlin in the 1880'a. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCarolyn Proctor 23 Nov 1998\n\nALLEN, BURNS, STEPHENS\n\nSearching for the ALLEN, BURNS, STEPHENS families. Catherine Baldridge ALLEN, a widow, came to Lorain Co. with her three sons, Ethan P. ALLEN, b. 1834; William Wallace ALLEN (my great grandfather), b. Feb. 28, 1837; and Henry N. ALLEN, b. Dec. 31, 1839. They settled in Eaton Twp. Catherine died March 20, 1862. Ethan and William joined Co. G of the 12th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry on Oct. 1, 1863. Ethan died in a hospital in Lexington, KY, July 21, 1864. Does anyone know if he married and had children? William married Mary BURNS, July 3, 1861, and had 3 children, all born in Eaton Twp.: Bertran Ethan ALLEN, b. Sept. 1862; Charles H. ALLEN, b. 1867; and Mabel Maude ALLEN, b. 1872. Henry ALLEN also married and had a son, Albert, b. 1872. Mary BURNS was the daughter of Sarah Fleming STEPHENS, and step-daughter of David STEPHENS. Mary's brother was Benjamin Franklin BURNS. Are there any descendents of these families still in Lorain Co.? Does anyone know where Catherine ALLEN is buried?\n\nMary Stevenson 19 Nov 1998\n\nEAMES, ONSTEIN, ONSTINE\n\nI am researching Theodore EAMES b. 1825 NY (He usually went by T.J.) He married 1850 Lorain Co. OH, Emmaline/Emmeline ONSTEIN or ONSTINE b. 1832 in Lorain Co., OH. Their children were Havilah Henry, Olivia, Friend Marshall, Glen Dennis, Frank Gaylord, Percival Floyd, and Eugene Jackson Willis. T. J. was listed in the 1860 Fillmore Co, MN census as a farmer. A letter I possess from his grandaughter, Jessie Eugenia Eames, states that he served in the first legislature of the state of MN. He died of stomach cancer at the age of 44 while living in TX. His wife and children moved from MN>TX>NE>MN where they had a strawberry farm in Canton. If This sounds familiar to you, please contact me: Leanne Wiese, 3534 Butcher Dr., Santa Clara, CA 95051\n\nLeanne Wiese, 27 Oct 1998\n\nROWE, WELLMAN\n\nI am seeking information on Joseph ROWE and his wife Rebecca WELLMAN who were married in Henrietta Lorain OH 8-22-1841.

The WELLMAN family lived in the Lorain area as well as Shelby (Russia is the city?) and also Heartland, Huron OH.

His daughter was Marcella KIENZIK born Jun 18 1907. I heard she was raised with a family by the last name of LUCZYNSKI. I think she came to America with this family. She married Walter DURKIEWICZ when she was in Chicago She died April 18 1962 at Little Company Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park IL. If anyone can help me in anyway, I really thank them.\n\nLynn Kulhanek, 10 Oct 1998\n\nSCHEELE, SCHMAUCH\n\nI am looking for any SCHEELE or SCHMAUCH that would have been living in the Amherst area in the mid 1800's. I know of a Friedrick Scheele who was married to a Catharine Schmauch in 1855. I have information on this family that dates back to the early 1800's. I believe that there were several brothers and a sister that came from Germany. Please let me know if you have any information on this family.\n\nRick Tucker, 26 Sep 1998\n\nLAWSON\n\nHi, my name is Larry Lawson. My grandfather Frank LAWSON died in the 1920's, I had thought in the Kenmore, Ohio area (Akron suburb) He was a law enforcement officer in Elyria and Lorain county I believe. He died 40 years before I was born. My father is also passed away and I'm attempting to find out more about my grandfather as I am also a law enforcement officer in Florida. The information I have is very sketchy but I believe he was an Elyria Police Officer and a Lorain Co. Deputy Sheriff. He supposedly died from wounds in the line of duty. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for any help.\n\nLawrence Lawson, 4 Sep 1998\n\nBROWN, MAPLE\n\nHi--I have an Alfred T BROWN who was born in Rochester, NY, 1835 but married Sarah MAPLE in Elyria 2/15/1862. He later fought in the war and returned to Elyria. He and Sarah moved to Cleveland and remained there until their deaths in 1908. They had two living daughters, Minnie and Ida, though she stated that she had born 8 children in the 1900 census. I have never been able to locate Alfred's parents. Perhaps they moved to Ohio as a family early on? Also would be interested in any of the other 6 children Sarah had. I know some information about Sarah's family, but would love any more. Her parents, Thomas and Sarah MAPLE, emigrated from England about 1841 and had 9 children. Thank you for any assistance! Debbie in California\n\nDebbie, 26 Aug 1998\n\nRICE\n\nI am trying to locate descendents of Frederick William RICE, who came to the USA from Germany with his parents an a brother named Barnhart RICE (my ancestor). We have information that one of Frederick's great grandchildren lived in Oberlin, Ohio in Lorain County about 1920. This descendent's name is shown in my Rice Family History booklet as a Mr. T. J. RICE. We know very little about Frederick William RICE and his descendents and I am trying to find currently living descendents and build the lineage into our RICE line, the descendents of Barnhart RICE, Frederick's brother.\n\nGary Rice, 23 Aug 1998\n\nSPAULDING\n\nI am looking for the Mrs. Spaulding referred to in the following diary entry: \"Aug. 20, 1930: (We attended) the Wright reunion held at the home of O. D. Smythe at Homer. Mrs. Smythe is Emory Wright's daughter. She has a sister, MRS. SPAULDING of Oberlin, who says she has information to secure D.A.R. membership through Simeon Wright, Sr.\" This Mrs. Spaulding would probably be a descendant of Simeon Wright and Susannah Abbott who emigrated to Licking County, Ohio in 1816. They had nine children who survived to adulthood: Seth born January 22, 1792; Hiram born July 25, 1802; Sallie Wright born July 05, 1805; Wait born July 20, 1807; Robert P. born August 26, 1809; Polly born April 05, 1813; Martha born May 03, 1815; James N. born February 20, 1818; Anna M. born March 11, 1821 and died 1901, married Joseph Ludlow Denman.\n\nMargaret Bowman, 23 Aug 1998\n\nKORDELESKI, KORDELSKI, BLANK\n\nI am researching the KORDELESKI's that lived in Lorain County. Andrew Kordeleski was the first to immigrate to the area. He stopped off in Pennsylvania before heading to Pennfield Township. He was living in Lorain (was called Sheffield Township at that time) by the 1910 census. He had 7 children, Casimir, Ben, Mike, Jane, Florence, Andy and Walter. He was married to Martha BLANK who's parents resided in Lorain County too. Martha BLANK's parents were Mike and Frances BLANK. (The name was originally spelled BLAZEJCZEK) In the 1920 census, there were two children living with Mike and Frances BLANK, Anna and Jennie. I would like to find out what happened to these two girls. Also, Frances BLANK's obit states she is survived by 7 children. The only ones I know of are Martha, Anna and Jennie. Next came Andrew's brother Ignatius (Ignatz) in 1903. In 1912 came a third brother, Walter and a nephew, Mike. I have been told there was a sister who immigrated also, but I am unable to find any proof of her at this time. I would like to find out more about the sister if at all possible. I want to find the names of all of Mike's children, and anything about his first wife, Bertha Plato. Also, I would like to find out what happened to Ignatz daughters, Frances, Helen and Anna. I have them in the 1920 census, but nothing after that.\n\nMichele Kordeleski, 8 Aug 1998\n\nPADLEY\n\nI am interested in locating information on any of the PADLEY family members, especially if any are living or lived in Lorain County or surrounding counties. John and Letitia HILL PADLEY came to America in 1852 from Lincolnshire, England and moved to Sheffield in 1856. I know they had at least one child, Ettie Letitia (PADLEY) JONES (born June 26, 1852 in Lincolnshire, died May 21, 1930, buried in Elyria Ridgelawn Cemetery). Ettie married Charles Augustus JONES on Dec. 27, 1873 in Sandusky. (Charles - born on Sept 23, 1849 in East Cleveland, moved to Elyria in 1872, contractor and builder in Lorain County and Sandusky). The above information was also listed in my 1916 editions of, \"A Standard History of Lorain County Ohio\". I believe Hilla E. (PADLEY) VINCENT (born June 27, 1857, died 1933, buried at Elyria Ridgelawn Cemetery) may be a sister of Ettie Letitia (PADLEY) JONES, my GG grandmother. Hilla married Karl W. VINCENT (born April 25, 1852, died Nov. 9, 1958, buried at Elyria Ridgelawn Cemetery). I have a birthday book from Hilla (Padley) Vincent's unmarried daughter, Hattie VINCENT, who was known to be a cousin of my grandmother, Letitia (Tish) Mayhe JONES PFAFF. My book lists births and some deaths of 25 Padley's. I have not verified the connections of many of these. I especially would like to find out if any of these Padleys are other children of Letetia and John PADLEY. Thank you. Sandy (Letitia Stone) Strong, 136 Meadow Drive, Elyria, Ohio 44035.\n\nSandy Strong, 3 Aug 1998\n\nCASE\n\nSeeking information on the following CASE families: Homer CASE who married on June 06,1855 to Mary SHERWOOD, John A.

The elder William Wallhead was in business on East River Street as early as 1896, and possibly earlier. The younger Mr Wallhead operated on West River Street, at the intersection of Infirmary Road, in the early 1900's, including at least 1910 through 1920. In exchange for information on these two Brick-Making Establishments [not including the Elyria City Directories], I will do U.S. Census lookups at the Western Reserve Historical Society Library, which I visit at least once a week. The kind of details I hope to garner are: when each factory opened and went out of business, number of employees [and their names, if possible], and hiring practices. Thank you.\n\nRandall Cooper 16 May 1998\n\nHAVENS, SIMONDS\n\nDescendants of Abram A. Havens Generation No. 1 1. ABRAM A.1 HAVENS was born in New York. He married LAURA J. SIMONDS.

Their names are John MUNSINGER and Julina (FULLER) Munsinger. My family's legend is that a Col. Munsinger (John's father) was a prominent pioneer involved in cutting a military road through the wilderness to Oberlin (or maybe it was Elyria) during the War of 1812. It is said there was a plaque monument near Oberlin regarding this accomplishment.I know that John and Julina Munsinger moved to Iowa in the late 1850's, and took my great-grandfather James Monroe Munsinger with them as a small child. They are buried in Linn Co., Iowa. James was the father of my grandmother Leona Ardys (Munsinger) Boyd. I'd like to find out more about Col. Munsinger and his descendants, as well as anything that exists about his parentage. Through on-line research, I found that Christian Munsinger, who I believe was a brother to John, reported his birthplace as Muhlburg, Germany.

Eliel SPENCER, born New York, 1811. Married Angeline ROCKWOOD, August 5, 1833, Lorain County, Ohio. I believe that Roswell and Eliel were brothers but I can't prove it. They were both born in New York, but I don't know who their parents were, or what area of New York they came from. I believe that they came with their family from Jefferson County , New York with the group from the Champion area. Roswell and his wife named their daughter Pamelia which is the name of a town in Jefferson County. My Great Grandfather was Festus Eliel Spencer. He was born in Lagrange in 1842. He was the fourth son of Roswell and Samantha Morgan Spencer. If anyone has any information at all about these people, my family and I would love to hear from them. This has turned into a family quest.\n\nBill Orr 9 Feb 1998\n\nBOLSTER\n\nI am looking for anybody researching the surname BOLSTER. In or around Lorain Co., Ohio.
