        "meta_description": "Hi everyone.  My great grandfather was John Timms, born according to the census in either Leamington or Shipton in Warwickshire in about 1841.  In the 1861 census his parents were James and Caroline Timms of 4 Pages Buildings, Kenilworth Street, Leamington Priors.  James was born in Radford and Caroline in Newton. \n \nI'm unable to find the birth of ggrandfather John.  I've searched all the surrounding parishes and only come up with one possibility, an unnamed male Timms born Shipston on Stour",
