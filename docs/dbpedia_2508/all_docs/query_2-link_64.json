        "text": "SYDNEY, Australia — Dozens of Justine Damond’s closest friends and relatives gathered at sunrise on Freshwater Beach in Sydney on Wednesday, with candles and flowers in hand, to commemorate the life of a woman they described as a ray of light.\n\nHorrified and sad, they said they could hardly believe that a woman so calm — a spiritual healer and meditation coach — had been fatally shot on Saturday night by a police officer in Minneapolis, where she was soon to be married.\n\n“None of it makes sense,” said Michael Timbs, who lives in a coastal suburb near where Ms. Damond grew up. “To try and picture the scene and understand how he did that, I can’t get a sense of it.”\n\nHe swept his arm at the expanse of beach and glittering ocean. “You stand and look at this peaceful place,” he said, “and you think — it would have never happened here.”\n\nAll across Australia this week, similar sentiments were bursting into public view as the struggles over American policing — well known to so many in the United States — suddenly hit home for a country half a world away.\n\nLaw enforcement experts here have shaken their heads and criticized both police training in the United States and the American embrace of guns. One local newspaper put the death of Ms. Damond, 40, who also went by the name Justine Ruszczyk, on its front page with the headline: “American Nightmare.” And on Wednesday morning, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, appearing on television, asked a simple, if damning, question on the minds of many: “How can a woman out in the street in her pajamas seeking assistance from police be shot like that? It is a shocking killing.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
