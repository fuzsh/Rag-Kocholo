        "text": "Above: Looking west from the eastern end of the Paddington Basin.\n\nThe trouble with developers is that they develop the land. Well, they would, that’s their job. Their problem is that, sometimes, they just do not know when to stop. In the case of Paddington Basin, they got their hands on all that land and developed every last square inch with the densest and tallest office blocks that they could obtain planning permission for. The result was that they made a fortune from their labours but had no interest in providing any open space for the workers or visitors to relax in.\n\nHaving taken up all the available space on either side of Paddington Basin, it was suddenly realised that there was a need for some open space where flowers could be seen, trees could be enjoyed and small expanses of green grass could provide a mini oasis amid the jungle of awful office blocks. So, what could be done? The obvious solution was to start laying out a ‘pocket park’ on large rafts that floated on the Paddington Basin itself. But wouldn’t that defeat the concept of having water in the first place? That question has never been answered.\n\nThe concept of London’s first floating public ‘pocket park’ was given the green light by Westminster planners early in 2017. The 45m-long green floating oasis was then created at the most easterly end of the Paddington Basin, providing a recreational area that is open all year round until dusk. Parks and water have been a sore point for several years now – remember the Garden Bridge?\n\nThe Vauxhall-based landscaper and former Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) Young Garden Designer of the Year – Tony Woods – was asked to come up with a solution. As well as the detail of the design, his greatest challenge was to ensure that the floating structure was stable when weighed down by the soil and up to 150 people on an area of 730 square metres. It was claimed that, even on a windy day, the park is stable enough not to be rocked by any waves on the basin’s surface.\n\nThe garden has been created from a series of interlocking pontoons made from recycled materials which have been made to look like reclaimed wood. They were assembled in Cumbria and transported to Uxbridge by road before being transported on the canal network to Paddington Basin in time for a planned May 2017 opening – as part of the Chelsea Fringe.\n\nThere are three areas which include an events and installations venue with a pergola and a ‘no humans’ tiny floating reserve for wildfowl. It features open lawns, raised borders, and seating areas. The pocket park forms part of Merchant Square, which also features kinetic bridges by designers including Thomas Heatherwick, who also created nearby Rolling Bridge.\n\n-ENDS-\n\nAbove: View of the footbridge when fully extended across the small dock.\n\nThe Rolling Bridge was designed by the award-winning Heatherwick Studio and installed at Paddington in 2004. The twelve-metre bridge is made from eight triangular segments, which fold towards each other, forming an octagonal sculpture that stands on one side of the canal towpath. Constructed at Littlehampton Welding in Sussex, the Rolling Bridge arrived at Paddington by canal. Since its official opening in September 2004 it has won a Structural Steel Award and an Emerging Architecture Award.\n\nThe Rolling Bridge was conceived by Thomas Heatherwick. It consists of eight triangular sections hinged at the walkway level and connected above by two-part links that can be collapsed towards the deck by hydraulic cylinders mounted vertically between the sections. When extended, it resembles a conventional steel and timber footbridge which is 12 metres long. To allow the passage of boats, the hydraulic pistons are activated and the bridge rolls up until its two ends join, to form an octagonal shape measuring one-half of the waterway’s width at that point.\n\nAbove: View as the footbridge starts to roll up towards the right.\n\nOn the day the pictures were taken, the bridge was undergoing testing to see that it was working properly. It is believed that, at the time of writing, the bridge is out of action.\n\nAbove: View showing the bridge rolled up into an octagonal shape.\n\nThe pedestrian bridge spans a small dock, designed to accommodate a narrow boat. A narrowboat can only gain access to the dock when the bridge is rolled up beside the dock.\n\n-ENDS-\n\nAbove: Looking west a short distance from Little Venice.\n\nThe Grand Junction Canal formed a link between the Grand Union Canal and Paddington. It ran east from the Grand Union, ending at Little Venice, with the Paddington Arm being constructed at the same time. These days, with the Paddington Arm being so accessible, travelling to Paddington Station (or the underground station or the Elizabeth Line station both by the same name) it is easy to walk out onto the footpaths beside the Paddington Arm and walk up to Little Venice. From there, it is a short walk to reach the Grand Junction Canal. Since the 1930s, it has been known as the Grand Union Canal.\n\nAbove: Looking west at the canal from under the overhang of Westway. The Trellick Tower is reflected in the still water of the canal.\n\nThe walk is, in the main a pleasant one, as you walk west beside the Grand Junction Canal which is only four feet (about 1.2 m) deep. The first part of the walk leads past grand houses and a never-ending collection of houseboats adding a touch of elegance to the scene. Further west, the curving canal passes almost under the large concrete form of Westway as it snakes its elevated route out of London.\n\nThe canal continues west, passing the large housing estate which includes the Trellick Tower. This tall, slender tower block is Grade II* listed, standing on the Cheltenham Estate in North Kensington which is close to the canal. The estate opened in 1972 and was commissioned by the Greater London Council (GLC) and designed in the Brutalist style by architect Ernő Goldfinger. The Trellick Tower has a height of 322 feet (98 m), or 394 feet (120 m) including the communications mast on top.\n\nThe canal in Paddington (which is now part of the City of Westminster) continues further west until it reaches Great Western Road beside which is Westbourne Park underground Station. The canal then passes through the northern parts of the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.\n\n-ENDS-\n\nAbove: Looking east in the basin. What looks like a blue vessel is actually small offices built to look like a boat. On the far right is part of the canal side wall of St Mary’s Hospital.\n\nThe Paddington Basin is a short stretch of water that extends from Little Venice to Edgware Road, in the form rather like the letter ‘L’. It is the eastern part of the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal that connects Paddington to the main branch of the Grand Union Canal near Hayes, in Middlesex. The arm slices through West London providing a green corridor frequented by both people and wildlife. The entire Paddington Arm is 13.6 miles (21.76 km), with the Paddington Basin forming the very last part – at the eastern end.\n\nUntil the turn of the millennium the Paddington Basin was lined with mainly derelict warehouses and the waterway was almost never used. A new development known as Paddington Waterside brought new life to the area as well as a large collection of high-rise offices. The eastern end of the basin on the south side is dominated by the old and newer parts of St Mary’s Hospital. It was proposed to rebuild the hospital and expand the site but those plans were scrapped. From the canal, the view of the hospital is rather uninteresting. At the Edgware Road end of the basin is a modern development of offices, shops, and apartments called West End Quay.\n\nA temporary Floating Pocket Park has been designed to breathe new life into the water space at the far end of Paddington Basin and connect local communities. The space, which has been unused and originally reserved for business barges, hosts 730 square metres of open lawn areas, dense planting, and communal seating, as well as a spot for trade boats. The floating park has been created by European Land and Property Limited which lease the water space from the Canal Water Trust. Space at the basin is also provided for visiting canal boats to moor.\n\nFurther west, at Paddington Basin, the waterway provides the unusual feature of being beside Paddington Station. The pedestrian open space provides a direct connection with the nearby Sheldon Square which has a large open space surrounded by large offices.\n\nWhat was once a derelict and very neglected part of the canal up to the millennium has now sprung into life. It is a pleasant area to stroll around for visitors with excellent passenger connections for those working in and around the basin – in the form of Paddington Station, the nearby underground station and also the new Elizabeth Line station.\n\n-ENDS-\n\nAbove: A map of the Regent’s Canal which is shown beside Regent’s Park and leading up to Edgware Road. That part of the map lies in the old Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone. At Edgware Road, the canal passed under the road and its final straight length lies inside the old Metropolitan Borough of Paddington. Its extent is indicated by PURPLE arrows. The Grand Junction Canal within Paddington is indicated by GREEN arrows and the Paddington Basin is indicated by YELLOW arrows.\n\nWhen the Regent’s Canal was built, London was a much smaller place than it is today. Nevertheless, the built-up area was crowded and there was a need to supply it with many commodities, mainly coal, and timber. Both materials were used by commercial companies and domestic houses. Gas was originally obtained by converting coal to coke and then using it at gas works. They were built strategically beside the Regent’s Canal for ease of delivering coal. Most of the timber yards beside the canal have closed down now but there were quite a few that were laid out to have canal-side access.\n\nWith a length of 8.6 miles (14.8 km), the canal was constructed to bring commodities to and from the Thames – at Regent’s Canal Dock (now renamed Limehouse Basin). The route was worked out to run around the outside of the built-up areas, at places like Hackney, Islington, and Regent’s Park. The terrain was hilly and it required 12 locks to be constructed as well as the long Islington Tunnel. The western extent was at Paddington which by 1812 already had factories requiring materials like coal and timber.\n\nThe western end of the Regent’s Canal ended at a large basin that had been constructed so that the many narrow boats had plenty of space to turn around. That basin is now better known today as Little Venice. Unlike today’s motorways and London’s endless railway viaducts, the canal was regarded as picturesque and a desirable place to live. Many of Paddington’s larger residences are to be found around this part of the canal and form an elegant backdrop to the canal and also Little Venice.\n\nHaving completed the Regent’s Canal in 1812, it was possible to join onto the Grand Union Canal at Little Venice. The Grand Union Canal was built between 1793 and 1805, to improve the route from the Midlands to London, by-passing the upper reaches of the River Thames near Oxford, thus shortening the journey. The Grand Junction Canal links with Grand Union Canal and also the Thames much further upstream. Further west, the canal passes through the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and then the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham before reaching Outer London.\n\nWhen the Grand Junction Canal was constructed, it ran east towards Paddington with an ‘extra’ length of canal known as the Paddington Arm, serving the many factories beside and near that stretch of water. All of the canals in Paddington still have their old towpaths, some of them upgraded to more modern standards. For this reason, pedestrians can take leisurely strolls along these towpaths, with the added advantage that the walks are all on level ground. Having mentioned the locks of the Regent’s Canal, it should be pointed out that there are no locks in the Paddington area.\n\n-ENDS-\n\nAbove: Some elegant houses standing beside the Regent’s Canal\n\nPaddington was not mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086) since the manor had been given to Westminster Abbey before the conquest and was therefore included in the survey under the Manor of Westminster. The name Paddington means ‘ton of Padda’s people’. The word ‘ton’ is found at the start or end of many early place names and it means ‘farmstead, fenced area or enclosure’ – such as a group of houses. The original village was beside what has become the A40. Its location is where Paddington Green still exists. Paddington lay within the densely wooded Middlesex Forest that covered a large part of today’s North London. It would appear that the district where Paddington developed had been cleared soon after the Norman Conquest from the Middlesex Forest.\n\nMuch of the land which became the old Metropolitan Borough of Paddington consists chiefly of two hills – Maida Hill and Craven Hill. Much of the old Metropolitan Borough is almost flat land. The eastern boundary of the Metropolitan Borough was Edgware Road and the southern boundary was Bayswater Road, the western continuation of Oxford Street. The other boundaries were formed as a result of local parish boundaries.\n\nIts early history was that of open countryside, mainly formed of farms whose land was able to be cultivated due to a large part of Middlesex Forest being cut down. The road we know as the A40 was an important route from the West Country and from North Wales. The whole route was from Fishguard, in Pembrokeshire, via Cheltenham and the City of Gloucester, thence to Abingdon and the City of Oxford before reading London, at Paddington. In case you are wondering, a large part of the old A40 has now been superseded by motorways and other roads. It was that route that was taken by drovers from the West Country and Wales, driving their animals from local farms all the way to the London markets, principally Smithfield, in the City of London. Many of the Welsh settled in Paddington and it is no coincidence that there is still a Welsh Church in the locality today.\n\nAbove: Outline map showing the boundary of the old Metropolitan Borough of Paddington. Paddington Green is indicated by the YELLOW arrow. The GREEN points to Little Venice. The PINK rectangle shows the location of Paddington Station (main line).\n\nOver time, the land at Paddington became filled with houses and factories. By the 18th century, London was expanding rapidly and the New Road – now called City Road, Pentonville Road, Euston Road, and Marylebone Road – was cut across open countryside to act as a sort of ring road around most of the northern suburbs of London. The New Road was opened from 1756 onwards, as parts of it were completed, ending at Paddington.\n\nA similar scenario happened with the Regent’s Canal, completed in 1812, which provided a link for water traffic. Its route ran from the Thames at Limehouse, via Hackney and Islington, before finally ending with a large basin at Paddington. That basin is now called Little Venice. Once all that work had been completed, the Grand Junction Canal was constructed, running west from Little Venice. The canal was connected to the Grand Union Canal in 1805 and the Grand Junction, which ran to Uxbridge, was completed in 1810.\n\nThe transport story continued in 1854, when I K Brunel built the Great Western Railway from Bristol, ending beside the Regent’s Canal, at Paddington Station. Today, Paddington Green retains a certain amount of ‘old world’ standing beside the noisy A40, built on a viaduct, called Westway.\n\nSince about the turn of the millennium, there has been a very large development centred around Paddington Station and the old Paddington Arm of the Regent’s Canal. Much of the land on either side had become very run down and the old Paddington Arm was derelict and deserted. The new development, called Paddington Central includes Paddington Waterside and Sheldon Square. An example of its importance is the fact that the Elizabeth Line (constructed to run from Reading, under most of Central London and ending at Shenfield and Abbey Wood) has its own new Paddington Station, transporting commuters to the extensive offices centred on the new development.\n\nPaddington is today a busy place but, in spite of all that, it has been said that it is quite a low-key location in terms of history and important buildings to be visited within the old Metropolitan Borough. In 1965, the Metropolitan Boroughs of Paddington and St Marylebone became part of the City of Westminster.\n\n-ENDS-\n\nAbove: A plaque at No2 Upper Wimpole Street, where Arthur Conan Doyle wrote some of his famous detective works.\n\nArthur Ignatius Conan Doyle was born on 22 May 1859, in Edinburgh, Scotland. From the age of nine, Arthur was sent for seven years to a Jesuit boarding school in Lancashire. From there he graduated in 1876, aged 17. Although his father’s surname was Doyle, as an adult Arthur adopted ‘Conan Doyle’ as his surname. Family tradition would have dictated the pursuit of an artistic career, after his father, but Conan Doyle decided to follow a medical one. He was influenced by Dr Bryan Charles Waller, a young lodger his mother had taken in to make ends meet. Dr Waller had trained at the University of Edinburgh and that is where Conan Doyle went to carry out his medical studies.\n\nWhile studying medicine, he was very impressed by one of his lecturers – Dr Joseph Bell who Conan Doyle observed to be a master at observation, logic, deduction, and diagnosis. Those qualities of brilliance in deduction became absorbed into the character of Sherlock Holmes. In 1881, Conan Doyle obtained his “Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery” degree. He went on two voyages as a ship’s doctor but realised that would not be a permanent job and later he set up a doctor’s practice in Portsmouth where, by the end of the third year, it started to earn him a comfortable income. During the next years, the young man divided his time between trying to be a good doctor and struggling to become a recognised author. In August 1885, he married a young woman called Louisa Hawkins, the sister of one of his patients. In 1887, Conan Doyle was able to have published “A Study in Scarlet” which introduced the famous characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.\n\nIn spite of his flourishing practice in Portsmouth, Conan Doyle decided to open a practice in London. It was in the elegant Upper Wimpole Street where, according to his autobiography, not a single patient ever crossed his doorstep. With time on his hands, he made the decision that he could not run a medical practice and try to be a writer. He chose to be a writer. His stories of Sherlock Holmes appeared in the Strand Magazine. Not only was he becoming well-known in England, his stories were also published in the United States.\n\nThe plaque on a house in Upper Wimpole Street records Conan Doyle living at the house and writing there in 1891. The fact that he was able to afford to have rooms at Upper Wimpole Street indicates that Conan Doyle was financially well off. Knowing that he lived there also probably explains why he devised the address of 221b Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes to have rooms. It is only a very short walk away from Upper Wimpole Street.\n\n-ENDS-\n\nThe Diorama, in Regent’s Park, was a specialised theatre built in 1823 to show large, dramatised tableaux paintings as entertainment. At the time, it enjoyed great popularity but it closed in 1852. It was built towards the east of Regents Park – at 18 Park Square East which is on the north side of Marylebone Road, immediately north of Park Crescent (which lies on the south side). It is just inside the borough boundary of Westminster.\n\nThe Diorama, on the eastern side of Park-square, Regent’s-park, was exhibited in Paris long before it was brought to London, by its originators, MM Bouton and Daguerre. Daguerre was the inventor of Daguerréotype and died in 1851. The exhibition house, with the theatre in the rear, was designed by Morgan and Pugin. The ‘spectatory had a circular ceiling, with transparent medallion portraits. The whole structure was built in four months and cost £10,000.\n\nTo help us understand the construction, we will turn to John Timbs, in his ‘Curiosities of London’, published in 1867 – “The Diorama consisted of two pictures, eighty feet in length and forty feet in height, painted in solid and in transparency, arranged so as to exhibit changes of light and shade, and a variety of natural phenomena; the spectators being kept in comparative darkness, while the picture received a concentrated light from a ground-glass roof. The contrivance was partly optical, partly mechanical; and consisted in placing the pictures within the building so constructed, that the saloon containing the spectators revolved at intervals, and brought in succession the two distinct scenes into the field of view, without the necessity of the spectators removing from their seats; while the scenery itself remained stationary, and the light was distributed by transparent and movable blinds-some placed behind the picture, for intercepting and changing the colour of the rays of light, which passed through the semi-transparent parts. Similar blinds, above and in front of the picture were movable by cords, so as to distribute or direct the rays of light. The revolving motion given to the saloon was an arc of about 73º; and while the spectators were thus passing round, no person was permitted to go in or out. The revolution of the saloon was effected by means of a sector, or portion of a wheel, with teeth which worked in a series of wheels and pinions; one man, by turning a winch, moved the whole.”\n\nAccording to Timbs – “The interior of Canterbury Cathedral, the first picture exhibited, in 1823, was a triumph of this class; and the companion picture, the Valley of Samoa, equally admirable in atmospheric effects. In one day (Easter Monday, 1824), the receipts exceeded 200l.”\n\nTimbs explains further – “Although the Regent’s-park Diorama was artistically successful, it was not commercially so. In September 1848, the building and ground in the rear, with the machinery and pictures, was sold for £6,750; again, in June 1849, for £4,800; and the property, with sixteen pictures, rolled on large cylinders, was next sold for 3,000l. The building has since been converted into a Chapel for the Baptist denomination at the expense of Sir Morton Pete, Bart.”\n\nThe layout of the unusual building is shown in the print at the top. There were two display areas where the paintings were hung and changed during a performance. They are shown towards the top of the print with the walls on which the paintings were hung at almost 90 degrees to each other. The circular area was where about 200 people could be seated and the floor could be rotated so that the audience was aligned to sit facing either one painting or the other. In this way, the painting that the audience was not looking at could be changed, concealed from view.\n\n-ENDS-"
