JOHN TIMBS—66 YEARS.\n\nThere passed away on Tuesday last a very worthy citizen of Albion Park in the person of Mr. John Timbs, whose loss will be greatly mourned in the agiricultural community. He had been in ill health for the last three years with asthma and bronchitis, and the end came from heart failure. Born at Tara, Mount Terry, within a very short distance of where he lived all his life, the late Mr. Timbs was the second son of the late Gabriel and Ellen Timbs and brother of Mr. Gabriel Timbs, Town Clerk of Shellharbour, with whom and the family, district sympathy is expressed. The late Mr. Timbs was a man of retiring nature, his chief interest apart from his house and farm, being the Albion Park Agricultural Society for which during very many years he was a great worker, serving on the committee and as a steward at the shows and also in connection with the Society's social functions. When failing health compelled his retirement some few years ago, the decision was received with universal regret, and his presence in the horse ring very much missed. He married Miss Mary Agnes Condon, daughter of the late J. J. Condon, of Stony Creek, who survives, together with five sons and a daughter. One son, Mr. John Timbs, jnr, resides at the Tara homestead, and another, Mr. Albert Timbs, at Stony Range. The funeral took place at the Catholic cemetery, Albion Park, on Wednesay, the Rev Fr. O'Farrell officiating and a large gathering present to pay their last respects to one who had been a fine practical farmer and a very kindly and loveable man.\n\nThe Kiama Independent, and Shoalhaven Advertiser, 9 May 1936, page 2\n\n‡ General\n\nWorldConnect: db: bristol3, id: I1519\n\nWorldConnect: db: coskerie, id: I37533\n\nWorldConnect: db: grumpoldman, id: I34593\n\nWorldConnect: db: oke-harrison, id: I34593"
