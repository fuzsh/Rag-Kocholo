Have traced John and Emma in censuses to Bilston. On censuses sometimes Penkridge, sometimes Bilston as birthplace. 1851 they were living with John's sister Eliza Bake, a widow. His father was also John but I cannot trace him, he was listed as a carpenter on John and Emma's marriage certificate. If anyone can help it would be much appreciated as I am really stuck.\n\n2008\n\nCotterill\n\nThomas Cotterill (b1706) married Mary Johnson (b1701) on 17 Oct. 1736 in Penkridge.
