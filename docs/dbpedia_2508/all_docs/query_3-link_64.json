        "text": "I also have our coat of arms!\n\nThe English surname Timms is of patronymic origin, belonging to that category of surnames derived from the first name of the father of the original bearer.In this instance, the surname Timms cannot, as Harrison and Bardsley believe, be derived from the personal name Timothy, which did not appear in England until Tudor times, and is therefore not a likely source for this surname.The noted scholar Reaney states that the surname Timms is derived from the old English personal name Timma, cognate with the attested Continental Germanic form Timmo or Thiemmo.Thus the surname signifies “the son of Tima”.\n\nThe earliest written reference to the surname Timms and its variants Tims, Timm, Tymms, Tymm and Timme dates back to the thirteenth century.\n\nWilliam Filius (son of) Tymme was recorded in the Assize rolls of Cheshire in 1285 and Alicia Timme appears in the Subsidy Rolls of Worcestershire in 1327.William Tymmes is listed in the Subsidy rolls of Warwickshire in 1332 and Roger Tyms is recorded in the Register of Oxford University in 1564-5.Philip Timms is recorded in the Judicial Court Proceedings of Essex in 1698 and John Timms appears in the same records for Gloucestershire in 1750.Dennis Timms married Mary Edwards in St. George’s Church, Hanover Square in 1764.A noted bearer of the name and its variants include the writer Henry William Marett Tims (OBE) who was born in Calcutta in 1863.\n\nBlazon of Arms: Per chevron nebulee or and azure three fleurs-de-lis conterchanged.\n\nTranslation : Or (gold) denotes generosity and elevation of mind.Azure (blue) signifies truth and loyalty.The fleur-de-lis is highly regarded as an attribute of royalty.\n\nCrest: A goat’s head issuant.\n\nOrigin: England."
