        "text": "After Eight Years And Three Reviews Of The Case, Indiana Supreme Court Rules Police Must Return Seized Car To Its Owner\n\nfrom the thousands-of-dollars-spent-fighting-against-the-public's-interests dept\n\nIt’s now been eight years since Indiana law enforcement seized Tyson Timbs’ Land Rover following his arrest for distributing drugs. In eight years, this case has made multiple visits to the state trial court, the state court of appeals, the state’s Supreme Court, and the nation’s Supreme Court.\n\nThis isn’t just due to Timbs’ tenacity and his desire to have his car returned. His only car — worth $35,000 when it was seized — has been sitting in an impound lot for most of decade, all because of criminal charges that netted Timbs $1,200 in fines and one year of home detention.\n\nNo, these multiple trips are due to the state of Indiana attempting to prevent precedent from being set that would prevent it from seizing whatever it wants whenever it wants. Previous rulings found excessive fines — in this case taking the form of a $35,000 vehicle seizure over $400 of heroin sold to undercover officers — violate the Eighth Amendment. And these rulings also reminded the state that it had incorporated that part of the US Constitution years ago and couldn’t try to ignore it now just because it still wants to avail itself of Benjamins when ringing up people on nickel-and-dime charges.\n\nSo, for the third time, the Indiana state Supreme Court is forced to handle the Timbs case because the state has refused to accept every previous ruling that has gone against it, including the one handed down by the US Supreme Court. The opening of the ruling [PDF] expresses some of the court’s exasperation with the state’s stubbornness.\n\nWe chronicle and confront, for the third time, the State’s quest to forfeit Tyson Timbs’s now-famous white Land Rover. And, again, the same overarching question looms: would the forfeiture be constitutional?\n\nReminiscent of Captain Ahab’s chase of the white whale Moby Dick, this case has wound its way from the trial court all the way to the United States Supreme Court and back again. During the voyage, several points have come to light. First, the vehicle’s forfeiture, due to its punitive nature, is subject to the Eighth Amendment’s protection against excessive fines. Next, to stay within the limits of the Excessive Fines Clause, the forfeiture of Timbs’s vehicle must meet two requirements: instrumentality and proportionality. And, finally, the forfeiture falls within the instrumentality limit because the vehicle was the actual means by which Timbs committed the underlying drug offense.\n\nAll of these questions have been capably handled at each step of this long, laborious process. The problem is the state doesn’t like the answers it’s been getting. And the state Supreme Court doesn’t appear to like the state’s refusal to listen. There are some facts to consider, but as far as the state’s top court is concerned, they were answered amply by the lower court.\n\n[U]ntil now, the proportionality inquiry remained unresolved—that is, was the harshness of the Land Rover’s forfeiture grossly disproportionate to the gravity of Timbs’s dealing crime and his culpability for the vehicle’s misuse? The State not only urges us to answer that question in the negative, but it also requests that we wholly abandon the proportionality framework from State v. Timbs, 134 N.E.3d 12, 35–39 (Ind. 2019). Today, we reject the State’s request to overturn precedent, as there is no compelling reason to deviate from stare decisis and the law of the case; and we conclude that Timbs met his burden to show gross disproportionality, rendering the Land Rover’s forfeiture unconstitutional.\n\nThe key is the excessive fines part of the Eighth Amendment. The courts must decide whether the seizure was proportionate. The lower court — after hearing from witnesses on Timbs’ behalf (the state decided not to call any of its own) — made the right call by weighing the cost against the crime. The seizure of Timbs’ only vehicle didn’t serve any greater public interest. All it did was enrich the state at Timbs’ expense.\n\n[C]ontrary to the State’s position, we conclude that the $35,000 market value of the vehicle and the other sanctions imposed on Timbs point to the punitive, rather than remedial, nature of the forfeiture. As Timbs II explained, it’s appropriate to evaluate the market value of the forfeiture relative to the owner’s economic means—because “taking away the same piece of property from a billionaire and from someone who owns nothing” do not reflect equal punishments. 134 N.E.3d at 36. And, here, taking away a $35,000 asset from someone who owned nothing else was significantly punitive. Likewise, imposing the forfeiture on top of other sanctions—sanctions that included six years of restricted liberty as well as $1,200 in fees and costs — shows that the vehicle’s seizure was not for remedial purposes.\n\nFinally this comes to an end, years after it should have been obvious seizing Timbs’ car violated the Eighth Amendment right to be free from excessive fines.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial court; and the seven-plus-year pursuit for the white Land Rover comes to an end.\n\nThe state and its law enforcement agencies are now subject to a proportionality test that weighs the severity of the crime against the value of the items seized. If this test stands during criminal asset forfeiture — the seizures accompanying actual criminal charges — it needs to be applied to cases where law enforcement can’t even be bothered to affect an arrest, much less pursue criminal charges when seizing property. This is good news for Indiana residents. And it has the potential to disrupt forfeiture efforts nationwide.\n\nFiled Under: 8th amendment, asset forfeiture, civil asset forfeiture, due process, illinois, tyson timbs\n\nFBI's Recovery Of Colonial Pipeline Bitcoin Ransom Highlights How The 'Ban Crypto To Stop Ransomware' Cries Were Wrong Again\n\nfrom the that's-not-how-it-works dept\n\nLast month we highlighted what seemed like a fairly silly Wall Street Journal op-ed arguing that banning cryptocurrency was the best way to stop ransomware, in response (mainly) to the well publicized ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, which resulted in the company shutting down the flow of oil while it sorted things out. As we pointed out, not only was the idea of banning cryptocurrency unworkable, it was unlikely to do much to stop ransomware. Unfortunately, it appears that a number of other cryptocurrency haters jumped on this moment to push the idea even further, claiming that “society has a Bitcoin problem.”\n\nOf course, part of the key narrative in all of these pieces is that cryptocurrency and Bitcoin in particular, somehow make it easier for criminals to “get away” with these kinds of ransom demands, highlighting that it is somewhat easier to move around large values of Bitcoin than cash. However, as we noted in our original piece, the idea that cryptocurrency allows criminals to “get away” seemed extremely overblown, as we’ve seen plenty of cases where criminals using cryptocurrency were caught. And, as if to put an exclamation point on all of this, soon after the huge moral panic, the FBI announced that it had recovered over half of the money Colonial Pipeline had paid.\n\nAnd, as the FBI special agent’s affidavit showed, this was done in part by tracking how the money flowed across the public ledger. The NY Times ran an article noting that the FBI’s recovery of the money here “upends the idea that Bitcoin is untraceable.” A bunch of long time Bitcoin/cryptocurrency followers scoffed at the NY Times article, because they’ve long known that Bitcoin’s public ledger has always made it so that transactions are traceable. But it’s actually important for people not deeply in the Bitcoin space to understand this as well. And the problem with so many of the “ransomware is really a cryptocurrency problem” articles, was that they implied otherwise — that cryptocurrency was somehow totally and completely untraceable.\n\nAs the NY Times article explains, what’s important here is that it demonstrates that for all the hand wringing about cryptocurrencies and ransomware, the reality is that law enforcement is evolving with the times, and using the same kind of law enforcement detective work it’s supposed to use to solve crimes.\n\nYet for the growing community of cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, the fact that federal investigators had tracked the ransom as it moved through at least 23 different electronic accounts belonging to DarkSide, the hacking collective, before accessing one account showed that law enforcement was growing along with the industry.\n\nThat?s because the same properties that make cryptocurrencies attractive to cybercriminals ? the ability to transfer money instantaneously without a bank?s permission ? can be leveraged by law enforcement to track and seize criminals? funds at the speed of the internet.\n\nThat’s an important point and one that often gets lost in the FUD surrounding new technologies (such as encryption) that might make law enforcement’s job slightly more complex in the short run. But, at the same time, law enforcement needs to learn to adapt, not by undermining these technologies, but understanding how they work, and understanding how to do the actual legwork to trace those abusing the technology for criminal purposes.\n\nSo rather than jumping to the conclusion that we need to ban this or that technology because it makes it slightly more challenging for law enforcement, this is actually an example showing how if law enforcement does their job properly, the technology is not the problem.\n\nFiled Under: bitcoin, cryptocurrency, detective work, fbi, law enforcement, ransomeware, recovery\n\nCompanies: colonial pipeline\n\nThink Tech Companies Are Too Monopolistic? Then Stop Giving Them Patent Monopolies\n\nfrom the no-one-to-blame-but-yourself dept\n\nThere is a lot of sturm and drang in the halls of government these days about corporate mergers ? or, at least, tech company mergers (oddly, this ire doesn’t seem to necessarily extend to all mergers). But despite all the gnashing and wailing there’s not a lot of understanding of why they happen. Which is strange, because if you think there’s a problem, it would help to understand WHY there is a problem, because that understanding will give clues on how to fix it.\n\nSo let’s think about why a company “merges” with another. I put “merges” in quotes, because usually it boils down to one company buying another ? how much of a “merger” it is depends on how similarly positioned the respective companies are and the details of the deal, but regulators today seem most upset about the A part of M&A (acquisition) so let’s focus on that aspect. Why would a company want to acquire another?\n\nOne big reason relates to patent law. Let’s say you’re a company with a product, and you want to make that product do something more, or better, or have some new feature that it doesn’t already have. You could develop it on your own but (a) that will take time you may not have (ex: the market opening may close before you can get it out the door), (b) money you may not have (ex: you may not have the liquidity needed), or other resources you may not have (ex: you may not have the expertise needed or be able to easily hire it), and (c) even if you had what was needed you may still not be able to develop it on your own because it turns out that someone has already developed the best method, gotten a patent on it, and now they can block anyone else from implementing it with at least the threat of litigation if not also actual litigation.\n\nSo the shortest distance between two points for many companies, especially larger tech companies, is often to simply buy the other company that has the missing piece of the technology puzzle they want. This acquisition then does a few things. For one, it gives the purchasing company access to that technology, which means it could potentially produce a better product. Of course, it also gives the company exclusive access to the technology and lets them block anyone else from using it, including their competitors.\n\nIn other words, through patent law (and also copyright law, but we’ll set that aside for now) we intentionally give companies the power to act like monopolies, even when it’s not actually in our interest. So of course we’re upset that companies use that power, but the problem is that it’s a power we gave them. Splitting them up is not the cure for the problem we created; the only solution is to stop giving them so much monopoly power in the first place.\n\nThere are at least two things we should do differently. First, we need to stop giving out so many patents full stop (and we need to stop condemning the people calling for fewer to be issued). Too often these patents are not for actually significant innovations (or innovations at all), and all too often they are on subject matter that should be unpatentable. Every few decades or so the US Supreme Court wakes from its slumber to remind the world that, at least under US law, software is not patentable subject matter. But these decisions haven’t stopped people from pursuing, and getting, these sorts of patents. So it’s very strange that people wonder why there are so many tech companies with software-driven products that have so much market clout, when it’s a power our own USPTO has been purposefully giving them.\n\nBut even where patents are issued appropriately, there are still things we can do to mitigate their anti-competitive effects. One of the problems with patents today is how they give patent holders the ability to shut out other users of the technology. That’s why patents can have this harmful effect on the marketplace, and it’s also what has put modern patent law out-of-step with the authority granted Congress by the Constitution to pass a patent law at all. Congress gets to legislate in this area for the purpose of “promot[ing] the progress” of science and the useful arts, but the reality of today’s patent law is that instead of promoting progress it ends up creating huge obstacles to it.\n\nThis injunctive power that comes with a patent is also unnecessary to achieve anything that patent law was intended to vindicate. Even accepting as true the idea that innovators need some sort of reward for being the first to innovate something the world would benefit from ? beyond, of course, the inherent market advantage that comes from being first ? all that means is that if there’s some profit to be had from the innovation that the patentholder should get to realize at least some of it. But you don’t need the power to shut out all other uses to glean that profit; all you need to do is license it.\n\nOf course, backed with the power to enjoin other uses, license fees today are less about reasonable market rates that provide benefit to everyone: the innovator, the implementer, and the public, which now gets to have more innovation in the marketplace at prices the market can bear. Instead, patent revenue today is more about extortive windfalls. The policy change we need is to switch up that balance. And one way to do that is by replacing the current (and often disproportionate) ability of patentholders to enjoin any uses of their technology with some sort of compulsory license system. A compulsory license system means that patent holders cannot say no to competitors and other innovators who want to use or build on their technologies, either directly, by refusing permission, or indirectly, through excessive license fees. Instead the reward for their patent is the reasonable income returned by the license they must offer.\n\nThere are several upsides to changing patent law this way. For one, even if it somehow diminishes the perceived luster of having a patent that would not be a bad thing: as explained before, the landgrab that has been trying to turn every technological improvement, no matter how small, into a powerfully enforceable monopoly has been at the root of much of the anticompetitive behavior regulators now lament, and discouraging it would, on its own, help mitigate those problems. (Constraining the Patent Office so that it also grants fewer patents, especially specious and/or software ones would help as well.)\n\nSecondly, it also means that more people can use the technology, or even build on it. And that’s good for society in general. The point of patents is to stimulate that innovation, and this change would do so by clearing the way to it. Furthermore, it would also have the effect of diminishing the monopolistic effects we don’t like. Not only would patents now provide less monopoly power, but they would also lessen the incentive companies currently have to acquire other companies in order to horde more of it.\n\nWhich would also lead to less market consolidation. For instance, smaller companies with a sought after-innovation, instead of being bought out by one company that could now exclusively benefit from it, could stay going concerns and continue to put products in the market. If the innovations were legitimately patentable they could also use those licensing profits to subsidize their own further innovation and product development, and to the extent that fewer innovations may be patentable, the good news is that this reduction in patentability would mean that there would be more technologies available for them to help themselves to in order to compete, even against the companies we currently worry are too big.\n\nOf course, there is a catch: compulsory license systems are great in theory but often cumbersome in practice, and, as we see in the copyright space, they can introduce new, unwelcome, and debilitating costs and regulatory impediments. (We’d also want to keep an eye on where non-practicing entities owning patents should be in this ecosystem, if anywhere.) So this isn’t a case of “just add water” where tacking any old compulsory license system onto patent law will automatically make everything sunshine and roses. It will take some extremely careful thinking in how to implement.\n\nIn the meantime, however, we are seeing some other industry adaptations, like patent pools, emerge to help mitigate the extortive power of patents. And, in general, the idea of minimizing the exclusionary control of a patent, including through compulsory licenses, is a good one we would be better served to be thinking seriously about, rather than the zealous appetite to break up companies that has currently seized all of our attention. Especially when these proposed break-ups are so arbitrary, unprincipled, and ultimately costly in ways regulators do not seem to be contemplating.\n\nIn any case it just doesn’t make any sense for the government to on one hand tell companies to go be monopolies and then immediately complain they are being monopolies. The solution to the problem of companies acting monopolistic is to not deliberately give them so much power to be.\n\nFiled Under: big tech, consolidation, monopolies, patents\n\nFBI Ignored Its Own Warrant And Search Policies To Seize Millions From People's Safety Deposit Boxes\n\nfrom the [hangs-GONE-FISHIN'-sign-in-FBI-office-window] dept\n\nThis brief clip from an FBI training film helps explain the actions undertaken by agents during a raid on a secure storage facility earlier this year:\n\nIn March of this year, the US Attorney in Los Angeles, California secured an indictment against a secure vault company, alleging the company was engaged in money laundering, drug trafficking, and hiding taxable assets. None of the company’s employees or owners were indicted.\n\nFBI agents spent five days turning US Private Vaults upside down. Agents apparently emptied every safety deposit box housed by the business. They did this in complete contradiction of the limits imposed on them by the FBI’s own warrant affidavit. Here’s Eric Boehm of Reason with some background:\n\n[T]he unsealed warrant authorizing the raid of U.S. Private Vaults granted the FBI permission to seize only the business’s computers, money counters, security cameras, and large steel frames that effectively act as bookshelves for the boxes themselves. Per FBI rules, however, the boxes could not be left unsecured in the vault after the raid had been completed, so agents had to take them into custody too.\n\nThe FBI could have taken custody of the boxes without opening them and sought warrants for those implicated by the investigation. Instead, the FBI agents emptied the boxes while still on the premises, engaging in dozens of searches not authorized by any warrant.\n\nHere’s what the FBI said it would do in its warrant request:\n\nIf you can’t see the picture, the relevant part of the sworn statement says:\n\nThis warrant does not authorize a criminal search or seizure of the safety deposit boxes. In seizing the nests of safety deposit boxes, agents shall follow their written inventory policies to protect their agencies and the contents of the boxes. Also in accordance with their written policies, agents shall inspect the contents of the boxes in an effort to identify their owners in order to notify them so that they can claim their property.\n\nAnd the agents weren’t supposed to empty the boxes and catalog the contents. This is spelled out explicitly in the FBI written policies.\n\nThe inspection should extend no further than necessary to determine ownership.\n\nSo, permission was given to look in the boxes for anything that might identify the owners so they could come get their stuff from the FBI. But instead of doing that, agents took everything from the boxes and started forfeiture proceedings — all without determining who owned what or providing any evidence at all that the items found in the nearly 1,000 boxes were obtained illicitly. Indeed, no customers of US Private Vaults have been accused of any criminal activity.\n\nHere’s what’s happening now, in apparent direct contradiction of the search warrant’s limits and the FBI’s own policies.\n\n[T]he FBI is now trying to confiscate $86 million in cash and millions of dollars more in jewelry and other valuables that agents found in 369 of the boxes.\n\nProsecutors claim the forfeiture is justified because the unnamed box holders were engaged in criminal activity. They have disclosed no evidence to support the allegation.\n\n[…]\n\nBeyond the $86 million in cash, the FBI is seeking to confiscate thousands of gold and silver bars, Patek Philippe and Rolex watches, and gem-studded earrings, bracelets and necklaces, many of them in felt or velvet pouches. The FBI also wants to take a box holder’s $1.3 million in poker chips from the Aria casino in Las Vegas.\n\nThe items the government claims — without facts in evidence — are the result of criminal activity includes unemployed food service worker’s life savings: $57,000 he obtained from lawsuit settlements stemming from a car accident in which he suffered a spinal injury and a successful claim against a landlord for chronic housing code violations.\n\nAnother US Private Vault’s customer (being represented, like the man above, by the Institute for Justice) lost her life savings to the FBI’s actions, a total of $80,000 that is obviously important to the 80-year-old woman who presumably wasn’t participating in drug dealing and money laundering. Contrary to the warrant and FBI guidelines, agents took everything in her safety deposit box even though they found identifying information as soon as they opened the box. Recordings of the raid show an agent holding her ID up to the camera before proceeding to go through the box, opening sealed envelopes and emptying their contents into another container.\n\nIt wasn’t just cash, coins, and other valuables being seized by agents. The take also included personal items belonging to Paul and Jennifer Snitko. This is what the FBI — until goaded into being a little less assholish by negative press and a handful of lawsuits — considered to be evidence of criminal activity.\n\nIn the Snitkos’ box, along with the baptismal certificate: a pilot’s log, heirloom jewelry, collectible coins, a marriage certificate, a birth certificate.\n\nThe FBI recently returned these items to the Snitkos, making them one of the lucky few to have their property returned. But those with larger quantities of valuable items or cash are probably going to have to sue to get their items returned. The FBI says it’s only willing to return items from about a quarter of the boxes its agents searched and seized without a warrant.\n\nThe FBI has returned the contents of about 75 boxes and plans to give back the items found in at least 175 more, because there was no evidence of criminality, Mrozek said. Federal agents have not determined who owns what was stored in many other boxes.\n\nThat’s the latest from Thomas Mrozek, the spokesperson for the Los Angeles US Attorney’s office. The FBI and federal prosecutors are hoping to take ownership of as much as possible from the remaining boxes, all of which is detailed in the very long inventory list compiled by the agents who performed the raid.\n\nThis is extremely ugly. Unfortunately, the use of civil forfeiture shifts some of the burden to those whose assets were seized. The government doesn’t really have to do anything. If claimants don’t come forward before June 24, those unclaimed assets will become government property, whether or not they had anything to do with criminal activity.\n\nThose that do file a claim will have to deal with a convoluted and expensive process that helps ensure the government will still get to keep most of what it seized under the guise of performing an inventory. The burden of proof for the government is extremely low. And it’s apparently telling judges a dog gave agents permission to engage in a bunch of warrantless seizures.\n\nDrug-sniffing dogs at the store during the raid alerted to traces of drugs on most of the money found in boxes, FBI agent Justin Palmerton claimed in a court statement. The boxes containing that cash are subject to criminal investigation, he said.\n\nThis claim is stupid as fuck and hopefully won’t be given any respect from judges that are subjected to it. Most currency contains trace amounts of drugs. That’s common knowledge. But the FBI isn’t raiding banks just because a dog alerted near the ATM. This is a completely disingenuous claim and, by itself, isn’t evidence of anything more than the FBI’s willingness to use literally anything to justify its warrantless acquisition of other people’s property.\n\nFiled Under: 4th amendment, asset forfeiture, asset seizure, civil asset forfeiture, doj, fbi\n\nCompanies: us private vaults\n\nFBI Director Ignores More Than 500 Ongoing Capitol Raid Prosecutions To Complain That Encryption Is Keeping Criminals From Being Caught\n\nfrom the why-are-all-these-trees-blocking-my-view-of-the-forest? dept\n\nFBI Director Chris Wray needs to shut the fuck up about encryption.\n\nIt has been 1,112 days since the FBI promised to perform a recount of encrypted devices in its possession, after overstating it by thousands for months in service of former director Jim Comey’s “going dark” haymaking.\n\nAs of November 2016, the number in the FBI’s possession was only around 880 devices. It suddenly jumped to 3,000 six months later. Then it doubled to 6,000 in less than five months. By the end of that fiscal year, four months later, the FBI had added another 1,775 uncrackable devices to its total.\n\nThat brought the alleged total to nearly 8,000 devices. The actual number — should the FBI ever get around to releasing it — is expected to be under 2,000.\n\nAdd to this the fact that the FBI doesn’t seem to be having much trouble hunting down criminals and terrorists. The FBI ran its own backdoored encrypted chat software for months, leading to dozens of arrests around the world. It ran seized child porn servers in order to deliver malware that coughed up identifying info about visitors to illicit dark web sites. Its crack team of undercover agents and informants have put a large number of terrorists behind bars, even though these successes are tainted by the agency’s willingness to radicalize people just so it can bust them. And it has obtained all sorts of evidence to use against more than 500 defendants in the January 6th Capitol raid cases.\n\nDespite all of this, Chris Wray is still complaining about encryption’s supposed ability to render the FBI (and other law enforcement agencies) blind and useless. His recent testimony before the House Judiciary Committee takes time to highlight all the FBI’s successes. But it also allows Wray to show off the latest in dead horse-beating rhetorical devices.\n\nThe proliferation of end-to-end and user-only-access encryption is a serious issue that increasingly limits law enforcement’s ability, even after obtaining a lawful warrant or court order, to access critical evidence and information needed to disrupt threats, protect the public, and bring perpetrators to justice.\n\nIf this were true, the FBI wouldn’t have nearly as many success stories to entertain its Congressional oversight with. The FBI appears to be doing just fine, despite Wray’s protestations otherwise.\n\nAnd he’s preaching to a choir that remains unconverted. The FBI has been complaining for the better part of a half-decade and it’s no closer to obtaining favorable legal precedent or encryption-breaking legislation than it was back then. The FBI’s directors have only one record. And it’s broken. Enjoy this supremely shitty tune you’ve all heard too many times before.\n\nThe FBI remains a strong advocate for the wide and consistent use of responsibly-managed encryption—encryption that providers can decrypt and provide to law enforcement when served with a legal order.\n\nAh, yes. “Responsibly-managed encryption.” Apparently allowing the government on-demand access through built-in flaws or storage of encryption keys where anyone — even criminals — can access them is more “responsible” than what’s being offered to the public now. The only acceptable encryption is broken encryption, according to the FBI. Backdoors, keys under the doormat, keys behind the counter at the front desk that can be obtained by request… all of these euphemisms fit the FBI’s encryption ideal, which is obviously far from ideal and anything but a net gain for public safety.\n\nChris Wray refuses to move past the “denial” stage of his self-inflicted grief.\n\nWhat we mean when we talk about lawful access is putting providers who manage encrypted data in a position to decrypt it and provide it to us in response to the legal process. We are not asking for, and do not want, any “backdoor,” that is, for encryption to be weakened or compromised so that it can be defeated from the outside by law enforcement or anyone else.\n\nIt’s a backdoor. Providers holding keys presents an opening for others… you know, “law enforcement or anyone else.” It may present itself as a front door with a doorman willing to oblige visiting cops, but it’s still an entrance that isn’t there presently, when providers allow users to hold their own encryption keys. To meet Wray halfway, it’s a door. But it’s a door whose presence exists solely because law enforcement desires it and which will present an enticing target for enterprising cybercriminals and state-sponsored hackers.\n\nAs I was saying, Chris Wray can fuck right off.\n\nUnfortunately, too much of the debate over lawful access has revolved around discussions of this “backdoor” straw man instead of what we really want and need.\n\nHey, it’s your straw man, dude. While other people present the facts — that encryption cannot be “safely” broken — Wray and his DOJ/FBI ilk continue to insist this common sense response is nothing more than a straw man offered up by people arguing in bad faith.\n\nBut it’s the FBI that’s been arguing in bad faith for years. It also insists encryption is zero sum: either law enforcement has access or the criminals win. This willfully ignores the FBI’s numerous options for obtaining communications and data that do not require forcing its way through the front of someone’s seized phone. And since the FBI won’t be honest about the extent of the problem it claims it faces — i.e., not updating the number of locked devices in its possession for more than THREE YEARS — no one should feel obliged to meet it halfway, much less engage in an “adult conversation” with a bunch of children who have misrepresented the facts for years.\n\nFiled Under: backdoors, chris wray, encryption, fbi, going dark"
