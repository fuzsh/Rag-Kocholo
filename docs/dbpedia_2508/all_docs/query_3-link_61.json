        "text": "Clerkenwell pub history index\n\nThe Curiosities of London - John Timbs 1868 states thus - \"The public-house facing the iron gates leading to the Sadler's Wells Theatre, with the sign of The Clown, in honour of Grimaldi, who frequented the house, was, in his day, known as the King of Prussia, prior to which its Sign had been that of the Queen of Hungary. It is to this tavern, or rather to an older one upon the same site, that Goldsmith alludes in his Essay on the Vertatility of Popular Favour. \"An alehouse-keeper,\" says he, \"near Islington, who had long lived at the sign of The French King, upon the commencement of the late war with France, pulled down his own sign, and put up that of the Queen of Hungary. Under the influence of her red face and golden sceptre, he continued to sell ale till she was no longer the favourite of his customers; he changed her, therefore, some time ago for the King of Prussia, which may probably be changed in turn for the man that shall be set up for vulgar admiration.\" The oldest sign by which this house was distinguished was that of The Turk's Head.\".\n\nThe Clown has been at 62 St John Street Road (e.g. in 1861) and 136 St John Street Road, and now stands at 370 St John Street. In its latter days it was called the New Clown - but it has been closed for a long time, serving now as a restaurant (2006). ** The address was at 62 St John Street Road in 1861 and earlier, and in 56 St John Street Road in 1842 and earlier, prior to street renumbering. It became 370 St John Street by 1910 following street renaming. *\n\nHistorical London public houses, Taverns, Inns, Beer Houses and Hotels.\n\nClown, 370 St John Street - in December 2006\n\nKindly provided by Stephen Harris\n\n[an error occurred while processing this directive]\n\nResidents at this address.\n\n1823/George Dell / Victualler /../../../Sun Fire Office records, held by Guildhall Library **\n\n1833-34/John Baker, Clown, 56 St John Street road/../../Pigots Directory\n\n1839/James Williamson/../../../Pigotâs Directory **\n\n1841/James Williamson/../../../Post Office Directory *\n\nMorning Advertiser 24 August 1846\n\nTransfer of Licences\n\nNew Clown, St John street road, Alfred Sims to William Tyler\n\n1848/William Tyler/../../../Post Office Directory\n\n1851/William Tyler/../../../Kellys Directory\n\n1856/William Tyler/../../../Post Office Directory\n\n1861/Susannah Agg/Licensed Victuallers Wife/34/Kennington, Surrey/Census\n\n1861/Jane Groom/Mother in Law, Widow/71/Chippenham, Wiltshire/Census\n\n1861/George Baker/Nephew/13/Hendon, Middlesex/Census\n\n1861/John Henderson/Waiter/39/Islington, Middlesex/Census\n\n1861/Mary Ann Verney/House Servant/20/Islington, Middlesex/Census\n\nPhilip Jagels is at the London Hospital Tavern, Whitechapel in 1861\n\n1862/Philip Jagels/../../../Post Office Directory **\n\nMarch 1866/Philip Jagels/License renewal/../Clerkenwell News\n\n1869/Philip Jagels/../../../Post Office Directory **\n\n1879/Mrs Mary Ann Jagels/../../../Post Office Directory **\n\n1881/Mary Ann Jagels/Licenced Victualler, Widow/63/Mile End/Census\n\n1881/Phillip John Jagels/Son/29/St Lukes/Census\n\n1881/Kate Jagels/Daughter/24/Whitechapel/Census\n\n1881/Eujune Mary Gee/Niece, Barmaid/20/Aldersgate/Census\n\n1881/Esther Ada Tucker/General Servant/22/Rotherhithe/Census\n\n1881/George Cork/Potman/28/St Johns Margate, Kent/Census\n\n1882/Mrs Mary Ann Jagels/../../../Post Office Directory\n\n1884/Mary A Jagels/../../../Business Directory of London **\n\n1891/William Thomas Richardson/../../../Post Office Directory\n\n1895/Robert Dove/../../../Post Office Directory\n\n1899/Wallace Gardiner Lewis/../../../Post Office Directory\n\n1900/Alfred Bear/../../../Post Office Directory **\n\nShoreditch Observer. 16 May 1908- License transfer\n\nNew Clown, 370 St Johns Street, Henry Edwin William Poole to William Edwin Hall\n\n1910/Henry Skinner/../../../Post Office Directory *\n\nHolborn and Finsbury Guardian. 31 October 1913 - License transfer\n\nNew Clown, 370 St John Street, Charles Batchelor to Herbert George Hancock\n\n1915/Herbert Hancock/../../../Post Office Directory *\n\n1919/Mrs Mary Hancock/../../../Post Office Directory **\n\n1921/Mary Hancock/../../../Hughes Directory\n\nIn 1921 at 370 St John Street, Finsbury, London is the Clown\n\nHerbert George Hancock, Licensed Victualler Assistant to Mary Hancock aged 42 years 8 months and born in Bath, Somerset\n\nMary Hancock, Wife, Licensed Victualler aged 37 years and born in London\n\nPhyllis Maud Hancock, Daughter aged 4 years 4 months and born in London\n\nJoan Mary Hancock, Daughter aged 1 year 10 months and born in London\n\nCatherine Jane Hancock, Cook aged 69 years 2 months and born in London\n\nLilian Fielder, Nursemaid aged 24 years 5 months and born in London\n\nHolloway Press 09 October 1926 - License transfer\n\nNew Clown, 370 St John Street, from William Percy Cook to Bessie Emily Smith (widow)\n\n1938/William Martin Peters, New Clown, 370 St John street EC1/../../Post Office Directory *\n\nIn 1939 at 370 St John Street, Finsbury\n\nErnest J Morrick, Publican, born 15 Sep 1902\n\nMargaret E P Morrick, Domestic Duties, born 10 Jun 1900\n\nAbe Bloomfield, Book Makers Clerk, born 03 Dec 1896\n\nEthel Bloomfield, Domestic Duties, born 22 Oct 1897\n\n1940, Ernest J Morrick, New Clown, 370 St John street EC1\n\nThe street directory of 1942 does not list a property at 370 St John street.
