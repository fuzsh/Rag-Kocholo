        "text": "Monetary sanctions, also known as legal financial obligations (LFOs), are a highly consequential yet underexplored element of the criminal legal system. LFOs consist of fines, fees, costs, restitution, surcharges, and other financial penalties that are imposed on individuals when they encounter the criminal legal system. This contact can occur via traffic citation, or misdemeanor, juvenile, and felony conviction. Although indistinguishable for the people who are required to pay them, monetary sanctions are variably understood as punishments prescribed by state statutes and local codes, restitution for victims of crime, user fees to recoup system expenses or pay for services rendered, and additional charges for failure to pay. Most monetary sanctions are sentenced on conviction or citation, but some pretrial costs—such as jail booking fees, electronic monitoring, or public defender services in the absence of a conviction—can be passed on to defendants as well.1 These fines and fees are experienced as bills and debts for those on whom they are imposed and as revenue sources for the courts, agencies, jurisdictions, and states that collect them. Although the practice of imposing fines and fees on convicted persons has existed in law since the Magna Carta in 1215, research shows that the prevalence and amounts of monetary sanctions have grown over the last five decades across federal, state, and local governments (Bannon, Nagrecha, and Diller 2010; Fergus 2018; Greenberg, Meredith, and Morse 2016; Harris, Evans, and Beckett 2010; Harris 2016; Shapiro 2014; U.S. Commission on Civil Rights 2017).2\n\nThe policy, legal, and social science literatures on monetary sanctions document critical features of this punishment schema (for an extensive review, see Martin et al. 2018; Martin 2020). Research shows that individuals struggle to pay their court debts, making it even more difficult to pay for essential expenses such as food, housing, health care, medicine, transportation, and childcare, thereby increasing stress (Harris, Evans, and Beckett 2010; Harris 2016; Pleggenkuhle 2018). This burden is not borne solely by those convicted of crimes but also by their family members and communities (deVuono-powell et al. 2015; Katzenstein and Waller 2015). Further, because people are not released from criminal legal supervision until their accounts are fully paid, monetary sanctions prolong supervision, make probation violations more likely, escalate sanctions for new criminal convictions, and result in incarceration for nonpayment (ACLU 2010; T. Atkinson 2016; Kohler-Hausmann 2018; Middlemass 2017; Western 2018). The racially disparate impact of monetary sanctions intensifies the aggressive policing of Black and Latinx neighborhoods because these groups typically find it more difficult to pay (Harris, Evans, and Beckett 2011; Henrichson et al. 2017; Henricks and Harvey 2017; Piquero and Jennings 2017; Sances and You 2017; U.S. Commission on Civil Rights 2017). The criminal legal monitoring and collection of fines, fees, and other costs extends and deepens the punishment of nonpayers and individuals reentering society, and warps the very legal institutions that legislate and implement these practices (Harris, Evans, and Beckett 2010, 2011; Harris 2016; Pattillo and Kirk 2021).\n\nYet, despite increasing attention to LFOs in criminal legal research and policy, the nascent literature on monetary sanctions has been limited in several ways. First, much of the research is limited to a few states or localities, potentially obscuring the full spectrum of knowledge regarding monetary sanctions across jurisdictions, and curtailing the possible insights from comparative analysis. Second, most studies focus on one component of LFOs, be it law, policy, practice, or people. Because the system of monetary sanctions includes all of these elements, such focused research can miss how law is experienced by those subjected to it, and how policies are transformed when put into practice. Third, data limitations have hampered inquiries into the distinct categories of LFOs and the demographic characteristics of those sentenced to them (Martin et al. 2018), complicating a full specification of the effects of LFOs. Last, few studies go deep into the institutions where monetary sanctions are legislated, imposed, managed, and collected, and hence obscure how legislatures, courts, and other agencies are embedded in the production and maintenance of the inequalities that build from criminal legal debt.\n\nDrawing on data from a multimethod study of eight U.S. states, our project addresses these gaps in the literature and advances knowledge of monetary sanctions across a number of sociological, criminological, legal, and policy domains. The articles included in this volume represent a culmination of five years of work in California, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Texas, and Washington State.3 Since 2015, we have examined each of these state’s statutory codes; interviewed and surveyed individuals living under the weight of criminal legal debt; observed court practices and legal logics during pretrial, sentencing, and review hearings; collected administrative court data on the imposition of monetary sanctions over time; and interviewed and surveyed decision-makers and practitioners (judges, attorneys, probation officers, and clerks) about monetary sanctions. Our research team of more than eighty members included faculty and post docs, as well as graduate, undergraduate, and high school student research assistants (RAs). Faculty collaborators included Alexes Harris (University of Washington, the principal investigator, or PI), Beth Huebner (University of Missouri–St. Louis), Karin Martin (University of Washington), Mary Pattillo (Northwestern University), Becky Pettit (The University of Texas at Austin), Sarah K.S. Shannon (University of Georgia), Bryan L. Sykes (University of California, Irvine), and Christopher Uggen (University of Minnesota). To date, this is the only multistate, mixed-methods analysis indicating how states and local jurisdictions legislatively structure and legally impose and collect financial penalties in criminal and lower courts.\n\nThis volume investigates multiple facets of monetary sanctions. The articles present both within- and between-state analyses of racial disparities, geographic differences, homelessness, public assistance, emotional health and family experiences, parenthood, gender differences, economic inequality and disparate impacts, municipal courts, changes in law and practice, notions of accountability, and rural patterns of LFO revenue. Our research is both intensely local (such as Huebner and Giuffre’s focus on Ferguson, Missouri) and broadly comparative (such as Harris’s and Smith’s examination of emotional health consequences across all eight states). Covering the spectrum from local to comparative is an important aspect of our research design because it facilitates discoveries about both deep institutional practices and systematic differences and commonalities across places.\n\nOverall, our work has three main takeaways. First, we emphasize the importance of variation for both individual experiences and policy interventions. Second, monetary sanctions alone (aside from incarceration or a criminal conviction) generate a plethora of collateral consequences, which we conceptualize as “tentacles” that reach into the domains of immigration, housing, health, family, the labor market, public assistance, and more. Third, these tentacles inextricably link monetary sanctions to broader patterns of racial and economic subjugation and social control.4\n\nRESEARCH ON MONETARY SANCTIONS\n\nWhereas other reviews of LFO research are organized along disciplinary lines or substantive foci (Martin et al. 2018; Martin 2020), we focus here on three periods of scholarship that have emerged in the study of the system of monetary sanctions, running roughly from 1980 to 2005, 2005 to 2013, and 2014 to the present. The early set of studies began in the 1980s, and included a detailed report by Fahy Mullaney (1988) that described monetary sanctions across the country and emphasized their proliferation despite a notable absence from policy debates. In addition to fines, court costs, restitution (for property) and reparations (for harm), Mullaney enumerated twenty-three additional “service fees” (such as domestic offense education fee, urinalysis fee), five types of “special assessments” (such as late payment interest), and five “residual economic sanctions” (such as increased insurance rates after a driving under the influence conviction). Mullaney noted a fervent enthusiasm for economic sanctions among policymakers and practitioners, yet warned that monetary sanctions could produce and exacerbate inequalities.\n\nSally Hillsman and her colleagues similarly identified a growing attraction to the use of criminal fines in state courts as an “intermediate punishment” (1988, 16), between incarceration and impunity (Hillsman 1988; Hillsman and Greene 1992; Hillsman and Mahoney 1988; see also Gordon and Glaser 1991). In this early work, researchers focused on how courts could improve the efficiency of sentencing and collecting fines and fees. For example, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a series of pilot projects assessed the viability of using day fines—financial sentences calibrated to the severity of an offense and a person’s daily wage (Hillsman 1990; Hillsman and Greene 1992; McDonald, Greene, and Worzella 1992; Tonry and Lynch 1996). These interventions showed that means-tested sentencing schema were feasible and generated similar collection dollars as indiscriminate financial sentencing guidelines while offering relief to low-income defendants.\n\nBarry Ruback and colleagues conducted some of the first multivariate analyses of monetary sanctions, studying both the context of sentencing LFOs and the experience of those being sentenced. In an analysis of case- and county-level characteristics associated with sentencing for restitution in Pennsylvania (Ruback, Shaffer, and Louge 2004), the authors find that property offenses and offenses against businesses were more likely to be charged restitution than other types of offenses, and that restitution was more likely to be charged and collected in counties with smaller populations. In a separate study using surveys with people owing penal debt (Ruback and Bergstrom 2006), Ruback and his colleagues found that many people could not make payments and did not know how much they owed or where their money went on payment.\n\nWhereas the first period of relevant research called attention to monetary sanctions, the second period (2005–2013) explored a fuller range of financial penalties across a larger number of jurisdictions and began to examine consequences for affected individuals. For example, a 2008 report to the Washington State Minority and Justice Commission examined the case characteristics of individuals sentenced with fines and fees in Washington State and analyzed the consequences of monetary sanctions for people carrying criminal legal debt (Beckett, Harris, and Evans 2008). Other reports prepared by advocacy and practitioner organizations focused primarily on single states and documented the increased use of fines and fees, the large numbers of individuals incarcerated for nonpayment, and the counterproductive nature of revenue generation (ACLU 2010; Bannon, Nagrecha, and Diller 2010; Reynolds and Hall 2012; Rhode Island Family Life Center 2008; Rosenthal and Weissman 2007; Tran-Leung 2010). These policy reports were accompanied by growing social science interest in and theorizing about the relationship between monetary sanctions and inequality (Harris, Evans, and Beckett 2010, 2011).\n\nA pivotal moment in raising national awareness of the system of monetary sanctions occurred in the aftermath of the August 2014 police killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed African American man from Ferguson, Missouri. The ArchCity Public Defenders released a report about municipal fines and fees in St. Louis County and the resulting criminal debt for residents (ArchCity Defenders 2014). The report prompted a more in-depth investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (2015), and then a 238-page national study issued by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (2017). Together, these studies uncovered the increasing and excessive use of fines and fees in criminal courts, and the disproportionate burden on poor people and people of color.\n\nElaborating on the unequal racial and class contours of LFOs, A Pound of Flesh (Harris 2016) was the first book-length study to highlight the pernicious and permanent consequences for those who are saddled with criminal legal debt. It ushered in the third and current period of monetary sanctions research (2014–2021). A Pound of Flesh describes a punishment continuum, whereby counties across Washington State unevenly interpreted and applied laws regarding LFOs. Infused by decision-makers’ personal values of personal responsibility, accountability, and redemption, and depending on the county where one was sentenced and monitored, individuals carrying legal debt faced punishments of varying intensity and duration.\n\nStudies of monetary sanctions have grown significantly since 2015 to the present. Legal scholars, sociologists, political scientists, economists, and criminologists have produced a burgeoning body of scholarship. This work can be placed broadly into four categories: statutory and institutional contexts of monetary sanctions, additional costs and revenue generation for courts and locales, consequences of LFOs for individuals and institutions, and theoretical and legal analyses of monetary sanctions.\n\nStudies of the statutory and institutional contexts of monetary sanctions illustrate that it is a system of legal statutes, administrative policies, and court procedures that facilitates the imposition, collection, and distribution of financial resources assessed to criminal defendants at the time of sentencing. In interviews with judges in North Carolina, Gene Nichol finds that judges complain about limited discretion because the legislature has “bullied” them into imposing monetary sanctions by mandating that they justify any decisions to waive fees (2020, 228). Brittany Friedman and Mary Pattillo (2019) describe the system in Illinois as “statutory inequality,” whereby penal indebtedness for poor people is inscribed in law on the books. In the juvenile realm, Leslie Paik and her colleague (Paik and Packard 2019; Paik 2020) map the types and amounts of LFOs juvenile courts impose on the guardians of minors, and challenge the primary tropes of restitution as a means by which youth can repair harm and show responsibility. In misdemeanor and traffic courts, scholars explicate the role that LFOs play in expanding state control of an ever-larger number of people (Natapoff 2018; Kohler-Hausmann 2018; Martin et al. 2018; Needham, Mackall, and Pettit 2020; Slavinski and Pettit 2021).\n\nA second body of contemporary scholarship moves outside the legislatures and courtrooms and looks at the additional financial costs associated with other types of sentences, such as community service, offenses related to substance use disorders, and other unfunded mandates imposed on defendants at the time of sentencing (Herrera et al. 2019; O’Neil and Strellman 2020; Harris, Smith, and Obara 2019). Scholars frame these extra costs—and the revenues officials generate from contracts with third-party entities—as “prison retailing” and “kickbacks” (Raher 2020, 5; Katzenstein, Bennett, and Swanson 2020, 259). A recent report relying on data from just twenty-five states approximates that in total $27.6 billion is owed in monetary sanctions (Hammons 2021). Given the mandatory nature of these fines, fees, and costs, Mary Katzenstein and Maureen Waller (2015, 639) describe the “seizure” of resources from system-involved individuals and their families, a process that is more intense in municipalities with higher proportions of Black residents (Sances and You 2017). Considerable research has documented the revenue-generating intentions of LFOs (Mai and Rafael 2020), often with little to show in the way of actual collections, improved policing, or increased municipal services (Crowley, Menendez, and Eisen 2020; Edwards 2020; Goldstein, Sances, and You 2020; Henricks and Harvey 2017; Kirk, Fernandes, and Friedman 2020; Fernandes et al. 2019; Pacewicz and Robinson 2020).\n\nA third body of contemporary scholarship examines the consequences associated with imposing monetary sanctions at both the individual and institutional levels. At the individual level, some studies broadly characterize who is sentenced to pay LFOs (Link 2019), and others focus on specific consequences of LFOs, such as recidivism, the loss of driver’s licenses, and voting restrictions (Bender et al. 2015; Colgan 2019; Garrett, Modjadidi, and Crozier 2020; Sebastian 2020; Piquero and Jennings 2017; Uggen et al. 2020). The LFOs that accrue from criminal traffic cases can be especially sticky, leading to new cases of driving on a suspended license, and even incarceration, especially for Black drivers (Edwards and Harris 2020). This body of work also moves beyond identifying the individual-level consequences of debt to show how insurmountable debt and its aggressive collection can lead to the delegitimization of the U.S. criminal legal system and its representatives (Brett 2020; Cadigan and Kirk 2020; Link et al. 2021; Pattillo and Kirk 2020; Ruhland, Holmes, and Petkus 2020; Shannon et al. 2020). Emergent scholarship examines the neighborhood-level consequences for communities of color characterized by high rates of criminal legal debt and poverty (O’Neill, Kennedy, and Harris forthcoming).\n\nA fourth and final line of inquiry in the contemporary literature covers theoretical and legal perspectives on the system of monetary sanctions. Some notable examples include Beth Colgan’s (2017, 2018, 2019) examination of the extent to which the long-term debt to which people are sentenced could be viewed as violating the excessive fines and fees clause of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Torie Atkinson (2016) uses both legal reasoning and empirical analysis to examine the nonsensical practice of municipal fines, which are claimed to be an alternative to incarceration, but in reality the fines coupled with additional fees, payment charges, and other costs, lead poor people to jail. In a similar way, Abbye Atkinson (2017) uses legal reasoning to show the arbitrariness of states’ failure to provide relief from penal debt that is disproportionately borne by people of color and the poor. Atkinson’s analysis raises interesting questions about who “deserves” debt relief and who does not. Scholars have also theorized about the system of monetary sanctions as predatory (Harris 2020; Page and Soss 2017; Page, Piehowski, and Soss 2019), unjust (Shannon 2020), and coercive (Pattillo and Kirk 2021).\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS VOLUME\n\nBased on the studies presented in this volume and our ongoing collective research, we make three primary arguments about the variation in and reach of monetary sanctions. First, laws and policies vary not only across states, but within them as well, and monetary sentencing practices diverge even within the same courthouse. The articles presented here show clearly that the system of monetary sanctions is fragmented, sprawling, disjointed, and often opaque, without much oversight or regulation despite being rooted in law and regulation (Verma and Sykes 2022; Fernandes, Friedman, and Kirk 2022, this volume). The power to set monetary sanctions lies at the federal, state, and local levels, but who actually governs LFOs in practice can move between judge, clerk, probation officer, prosecutor, collections agent, or even an online payment interface. Discretion, discrimination, carelessness, confusion, and idiosyncrasies can creep in at any one of those levels, making a highly consequential sentence subject to considerable unpredictability. Even though LFOs are routinely and widely imposed for traffic, misdemeanor, and felony cases, many people in the court system did not know how much they owed. None of the states we studied had a central state repository where information on the total amount owed could be found. Even the nomenclature for LFOs—fees, surcharges, costs, assessments, and so on—varied across states.\n\nThis primary finding of intense variation helps explain how and why individuals who are processed in this system feel disempowered and perpetually punished and in debt, as the articles in this volume illustrate. Variation also sheds light on the fiscal and legal inefficiencies at the institutional level, such as the slippage between policy reform and policy enactment within courtrooms (Smith, Thompson, and Cadigan 2022, this volume), or the redirection of public dollars from welfare state expenditures to criminal legal revenues (Sykes et al. 2022, this volume). Ultimately, such lack of uniformity and standardization highlights the challenges of instituting meaningful and effective change. Our findings show that operating within the current system allows for only piecemeal efforts—a law change in one city or a legal ruling in one state. On other hand, sweeping transformation of the system would require action at the Supreme Court or federal level, or a substantial chain reaction of state actions. Brittany Friedman and her colleagues (2022, this volume) take up this issue further.\n\nSecond, our work demonstrates the importance of examining the system of monetary sanctions in its entirety. Figure 1 illustrates the tentacles of this system and how penal debt and related precarious financial statuses, coupled with legal and social control, negatively affect one’s relationships with a variety of institutions, people, and situations. Our scholarship reveals how monetary sanctions can disrupt reintegrative practices for the formerly incarcerated through disruptions to employment, housing, mobility (transportation), and health. The financial burdens and the related legal consequences may disrupt family formation and stability, limiting parents’ capacity to be healthy and present in their children’s lives. Hence, research on families and children should investigate the potential intergenerational effects of both poverty and the oppressively constant criminal legal control that penal debt triggers. Although not explored in the articles in this volume, monetary sanctions’ tentacles may also reach into the realms of education, credit profiles, voting rights (Uggen et al. 2020), community organization and stability (O’Neill, Kennedy, and Harris forthcoming), and wealth accumulation (Maroto and Sykes 2020; Sykes and Maroto 2016).\n\nOur conceptualization of the tentacles of monetary sanctions must be situated within an understanding of the hegemony of neoliberal ideologies generally and in the criminal legal system in particular. We see how shifts in governmental policies that center notions of personal accountability and merit become mechanisms for controlling and subjugating populations (Martin, Spencer-Suarez, and Kirk 2022, this volume). The criminal legal system has evolved into a service-based institution that charges costs and fees per person processed. Individuals are now expected to pay for the “services” rendered by police, judges, attorneys, juries, and clerks. For many, these costs are immediately transformed into penal debt, potentially exposing them to a variety of garnishment mechanisms (Heubner and Shannon 2022) and the redistribution of means-tested public support (Sykes et al. 2022, this volume). From a neoliberal perspective, this debt becomes a social provision (A. Atkinson 2017, 2019), replacing what was formerly a public service supported by taxpayer monies. It is this market-based relationship that puts people in debt to the court and to the state and occasions the multiple collateral impacts that the articles in this volume elucidate. What is proffered as a less restrictive or less harmful intermediate punishment in reality carries a wealth of long-term negative consequences.\n\nFinally, the system of monetary sanctions structures racial and class subjugation and social control. It is plain that poor people are most affected by monetary sanctions. The inability to pay is what triggers repeated court appearances, probation violations, prolonged system involvement, and even incarceration. Affluent people, on the other hand, pay and move on. As a money-based punishment, the class inequalities that monetary sanctions create are perhaps self-evident. Nonetheless, the articles in this volume offer definitive empirical evidence in support of this claim. We also study seriously the racial contours of monetary sanctions. Several articles in this volume show that Black, Latinx, and Native Americans are disproportionately processed within the criminal legal system and, as a result, carry a disproportionate burden of criminal legal debt (Sanchez et al. 2022; Bing et al. 2022; Stewart et al. 2022; O’Neill et al. 2022).\n\nWe argue that the contemporary system of monetary sanctions embodies the same hallmarks and historical vestiges of past peculiar institutions (Wacquant 2001). The indebtedness that LFOs beget constitutes an extensive mechanism of social control, requiring unending amounts of people’s time and money, and imposing the constant threat of their bodies’ being taken into custody. However, the system of monetary sanctions now operates within a putatively colorblind era. According to Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, “contemporary racial inequality is reproduced through ‘new racism’ practices that are subtle, institutional, and apparently nonracial” (2018, 3). Supposed race-neutral political ideologies operate “without naming those who it subjects and those who it rewards” (3–4). Although policymakers and practitioners view policies governing monetary sanctions as largely race neutral, we uncover racialized disparities in outcomes. Moreover, even the research in this volume that does not investigate racial disparities head-on is informed by the fact that Black, Latinx, and Native American people are disproportionately surveilled, detained, and punished in the U.S. criminal legal system, including immigration law. Therefore, every finding presented here—from the negative emotional health effects of monetary sanctions to the predation of private probation agencies to the impacts on innocent family members—should be read as falling most heavily on Black and Brown people.\n\nFUTURE RESEARCH\n\nAfter five years of data collection, coding, and analysis, we have learned much about the system of monetary sanctions in the states under study, yet the questions and observations presented in our research raise new questions and open deeper lines of inquiry as we plot the future direction of this work. As examples, we did not endeavor to compare the system of monetary sanctions in sentencing with other sentencing modes. We have yet to conduct statistical analyses that measure recidivism rates for those with legal debt and those without. Our interview data illustrate that the difficulties of carrying penal debt spill over into the ability to secure housing, maintain employment, and remain healthy. We have not, however, illustrated these relationships statistically.\n\nMoreover, we did not conduct a cost-benefit analysis of court costs imposed and the expenditures necessary to monitor and collect outstanding debt. Although nonacademic reports suggest that in some jurisdictions courts spend more to collect debts than the value of the debts themselves, recouping only pennies on the dollar (Financial Justice Project 2018), important questions remain about how much money is outstanding and collected by local and state jurisdictions, and how the monies are allocated and to whom. For example, to what extent do the jurisdictions we examine rely on fines and fees to generate revenue? And how much are these jurisdictions paying to recoup outstanding fines and fees?\n\nFinally, because our scope of work focused on traffic, misdemeanor, and criminal courts, we did not explore monetary sanctions for people with civil, juvenile, or federal sentences; nor did we examine the practice and consequences of civil asset forfeiture. These topics merit sociolegal and policy analysis.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\nOpen Access Policy: RSF: The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences is an open access journal.
