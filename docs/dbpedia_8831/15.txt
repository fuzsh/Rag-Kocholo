UltraStar Play is a free and open source singing game. The game plays an audio file, displays lyrics, notes, and optionally a background video or image, while the players sing along to earn points.

UltraStar Play is built with the Unity game engine and mostly C# as programming language. Builds are available for desktop and mobile. Even more platforms (e.g. tvOS, PlayStation, XBox) might be added in the future.
