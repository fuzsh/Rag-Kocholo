UltraStar is a clone of SingStar, a music video game. UltraStar lets one or several players score points by singing along to a song or music video and match the pitch of the original song as well. UltraStar displays lyrics as well as the correct notes similar to a piano roll. On top of the correct notes UltraStar displays the pitch recorded from the players. UltraStar allows several people to play simultaneously by connecting several microphones possibly to several sound cards. To add a song to UltraStar, a file with notes and lyrics is required, together with an audio file. Optionally a cover image, a backdrop image and a video may be added to each song. UltraStar comes preloaded with a short sample from Nine Inch Nails hit Discipline from The Slip album.

UltraStar Deluxe is a free open source karaoke game for your PC. The gameplay experience is similar to that of the commercial product SingStar™ by Sony Computer Entertainment, which is exclusively available for the Playstation®. Unlike SingStar™, however, UltraStar Deluxe allows users to create their own songs and sing them on their PC2. By publishing the sourcecode, we’ve enabled you to customize the game completly to your heart’s content, desires and particular needs.Especially you are allowed to modify the product as you wish. Create your own themes or download content from the community, such as plugins, free songs or code patches for extended features. In party mode it allows up to twelve players to sing along to your favorite music in order to score points, depending on the pitch of the voice and the rhythm of singing. For UltraStar Deluxe to work you do not even have to buy expensive DVDs with not so many songs you really like, instead just buy DRM free audio files or use your album/cd music you already own and are stored on your personal computer.

UltraStar Deluxe was started as a modification of UltraStar. Whiteshark initially offered to collaborate with Corvus5, but this offer was declined. Instead Whiteshark started to add some features on his own with the help of Mota. The first release is known as X-Mas mod, due to a release date around Christmas time. This attracted the attention of other developers that were willing to help. The team grew and the source code departed more and more from the original. Smaller features are often implemented in both projects allowing them to benefit from one another. Though the projects’ implementations of such features often differ. UltraStar Deluxe is different in three key ways from UltraStar. Significant effort has been put into improving reliability by repairing bugs. The second difference is the visual appearance. Sparkling stars and various other effects have been added in addition to skin support. Many effects are also based on the Singstar on PS3. Many new features have been implemented:

More video formats are supported, such as DivX, XviD, FLV, Avi and WMV.

Singing screen with golden notes, line bonus and popups

Lua scriptable Party mode with various game types. This includes support for lua plugins that allow further extension of such game types.

Improved song management and selection with the ability to search for songs and use playlists
