        "text": "The Ak-Chin Indian Community UltraStar multitainment center scheduled to open Nov. 15 will offer more than just a place to grab dinner and movie or a place to play laser tag or bowl.\n\nFirst it will offer a job fair Oct. 3 and Oct. 4 for all levels of experience and interest. Positions include: shift managers, vault cashiers, a sous chef, bartenders, janitorial porters, line cooks, cast members, servers, bus persons and hosts.\n\nThe fair will be 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. both days at the Ak-Chin Environmental Protection Department at 46200 W. Ralph Street. To get there, turn right on Farrell Road and follow the signs.\n\nDamon Rubio, vice president of operations for UltraStar Cinemas, said there are about 200 positions.\n\n“A lot of those are entry-level, but a many are management and middle-management,” he said. “We hope lots of locals will show up.”\n\nWith staff in place, the entertainment center will run a bowling alley, laser tag, casual dining and an outdoor amphitheater in a 162,000-square-foot building.\n\nTen Pins Down — the bowling alley — will have on-lane dining and multiple bowling themes geared to different age groups. There will be VIP lanes available for parties or group events.\n\nThe Urban Arena Laser Tag Battlefield will be two stories offering playing options ranging from Capture the Flag type of games to more intricate battle scenarios.\n\nThe Play 'N Win arcade is an upgrade from the days of long ribbons of tickets, instead using personal player’s card with credits and virtual tickets already loaded.\n\nThe 12-screen UltraStar Cinemas will have stadium seating, screen 3D movies and feature D-box motion chairs that rumble in coordination with screen action."
