        "text": "I was interested in purchasing an Ultrastar He10 8TB 3.5-inch Helium Platform Enterprise Hard Drive for my desktop PC running Windows 7 and wanted to know if this drive was compatible? I see it’s rated as an Enterprise Drive so wasn’t sure of the drawbacks of that kind of setup since I wouldn’t be in an enterprise environment. The spec sheet didn’t mention it was rated to be used with Windows 7 so I wanted to check. I’ll be using this primarily for storage and light file work.\n\nI was particularly interested in the HGST HUH728080ALE600 3.5\" 8TB SATA 6Gb/s 7.2K RPM 128M 512E ISE HDD. I will be going directly through SATA III on the internal board without a RAID configuration. Just standard plug 'n play setup.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nDP\n\nIf I am to understand, the question was “will the HGST 8tb. drive work in a desktop PC” and just like 99% of these sites no one ever just gives a straight answer. Everyone has to beat around the bush and chase rabbits. I wish someone at HGST which is now Western Digital would get off of their back side and give a straight answer.\n\nI too would like some answers and when I call tech support I get some ■■■■■ that calls himself a tech and reads from a screen what to tell you. It’s ■■■■.\n\nI just purchased 2 WD DC HC510 also known as the Ultrastar He10 10Tb. dirves and they don’t read correctly. Trying to get the problem solved has been impossible. They are 10Tb. drives that in the system BIOS read as 1250.1 Gb. drives and in any other software they read as 4.65 Tb. drives but nothing will touch them. Windows File Explorer does not see the drives. Disk Manager sees them but won’t do anything with them. I have tried several different kinds of partition software and they won’t do anything but see the drives as 4.65Tb. drives and won’t format, partition or even erase them. My understanding is these 2 drives came out of a RAID Box. Is it possible that they have a Digital RAID Security Signature or format on them that is preventing me from doing anything with them? I just want to get them going.\n\nThe drives are (( HGST Ultrastar He10 HUH721010ALN600 0F27502 10TB 7200 RPM 256MB Cache SATA 6Gb/s with “Advanced 4Kn Format” )) . Please, if you know how to fix my problem help. But if you just want to give your 2 cents worth and give me your life story, save it for another day. If I seem rude I am sorry but I’ll bet I’m not the only one that feels that way. Also, you might help the first guy in this string. \"Is an Ultrastar He10 8TB 3.5-inch Helium Platform Enterprise Hard Drive plug and play compatible with his Windows 7 Desktop system? \" No one cares if they are the same drive as the WD as that was not the question. Thank you for your time.\n\nYes, I was actually! Nobody replied here a year ago, so I took my chances and bought the Ultrastar He10 8TB 3.5-inch Helium Platform Enterprise Hard Drive anyway off Amazon and mounted it in my desktop system and it works perfectly. I’m close to maxing it out with media, so will purchase a NAS with two of the same drives here soon and will leave the original 8TB in my desktop system. Never experienced any data loss or any other issues so far (knock on wood). It was a little “clicky” at first but don’t really notice it anymore.\n\nI have an older HP desktop from 2012 so not sure why your system isn’t seeing the drives? I can’t say I ever had issue with BIOS detecting the drive. Perhaps make sure the BIOS is up-to-date? Did you try different SATA cables? Different ports on the motherboard? Try disconnecting any SATA optical drives and use that port temporarily to see if it sees the drive. Not sure if SATA ports can be disabled in BIOS, so also check for that? Perhaps check your power supply to see if there aren’t any issues there. Exceeding voltage quota, etc.\n\nWhen I installed my drive, I did do a complete hard drive overhaul. Swapped out the original primary drive for a Samsung 250GB Solid State Drive, set the Ultrastar He10 8TB as a backup internal data drive, moved the original Hitachi 2TB HDD that came with the system as internal scratch drive and then did a clean reinstall of Window7. I experienced really slow boot times at first, but things seemed to resolve after I reformatted the original 2TB drive inside Win7 after boot. Go figure. Not sure what that was all about but it did have me scratching my head for a while. Guess it didn’t like the partition table. I was really surprised that Win7 SP1 saw the entire 8TB drive by default because I had read that it would only detect 2TB at first and you had to tweak something.\n\nInterested to see how things turn out for you!\n\nDJ"
