It supports .mp3 among other music file formats.\n\nI've been playing around with the software, and made two 'playable' Touhou-themed vocal remix song sets within 24 hours with a separate creator software for it (also freeware), but had some problems with lyrics timing and the like. The in-game song editor.. didnt know how to work it, but alas, wiki and english forums for it was 404.\n\nSo i look around, and find the development project for this software in comatose, on the English side.\n\nI had a chat with one of the devs on IRC and found that they needed support for the Windows side of things - compilers, programmers, site maintainers and the like.\n\n(While you can edit the lyric timings manually in the song .txt file, it's a massive amount of guesswork, trial and error.)\n\nSo, yeah, this is sort of a recruitment ad for anyone interested in lending a hand to them. This has good potential, just that no one seems to be spreading any word about it.\n\nMy apologies if this is offtopic or similar, feel free to move this thread to the appropriate subforum."
