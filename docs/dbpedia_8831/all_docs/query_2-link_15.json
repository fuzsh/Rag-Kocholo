        "text": "Most of you should know what UltraStar is. It's just like an open source SingStar for PC (mainly) allowing the community to provide setting files for MP3s and that's it.\n\nIn other words: I look for a proper MP3 of Penny Lane by The Beatles, get the config text file for it and start singing it just like I would on SingStar.\n\nUltraStar Deluxe is somehow a better version of (the old) UltraStar so it would make more sense to port Deluxe directly:\n\nhttps://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/USDX\n\nSince Let's Sing 2018 is working very well with my old Wii USB microphones I thought this might work as well. Dunno if that's a libnx issue in the first place or should already work.\n\nMost of the songs in Let's Sing are horrible while everyone's free to pick which songs he want in UltraStar.\n\nThis would make my girlfriend so happy and while I'm pretty sure not to be the only male member with a girlfriend here I think many other would like to have this as well.*\n\nOh, here's a picture of Liam:\n\n* (in rare cases there are some men enjoying singing games as well)\n\nActually I just looked at the FreePascal homepage and it apparently already supports GBA, DS and Wii, so perhaps it's not out of the question that someone would add Switch support to it at some point. Whether that would be enough to get USD running I don't know.\n\nGBA? What the f*ck?\n\nDidn't know about a Wii port though. That'll do the job in my living room until a Switch port appears if ever.\n\nI still wonder how they ported a Pascal project to those platforms. Didn't know that was possible.\n\nEdit: This seems to be the Wii repo -> https://sourceforge.net/p/ultrastarwii/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/\n\nI still wonder how they ported a Pascal project to those platforms. Didn't know that was possible.\n\nYeah that's what I was saying is that they made FreePascal, which is the compiler used to build USD, support those consoles. Someone would have to adapt the compiler to Switch, before anyone could port USD. I'm glad ultrastar got a wii port for you too.\n\nI found this while browsing around and looking for other UltraStar-like stuff:\n\nhttps://github.com/performous/performous\n\nIt's written in C++. Not sure how hard it would be to port to Switch, but maybe someone picks it up\n\nEdit: Looked at it a bit more indepth. It uses sdl2, has been ported to various desktop systems, is actively being developed on. This looks really decent. It has way more features too it seems (instruments and dance stuff, ie. GuitarHero and StepMania clone too!).\n\nI'm actually hoping somebody picks this up now haha\n\nI found this while browsing around and looking for other UltraStar-like stuff:\n\nhttps://github.com/performous/performous\n\nIt's written in C++.

But videos on YouTube are many years old lol:\n\nWell here we have a UltraStar-like game which is fully compatible to USDX songs:\n\nhttps://github.com/Vocaluxe/Vocaluxe\n\nGive it a try if youre not already using it. I made much better experience with it than with the original USDX.\n\nAlso its written in C# rather than Pascal.\n\nPromising. Last commit only 22 days ago and with C# we're at least step closer lol. Thx for pointing that out. I wish we could make homebrews with C# in general. It's the only language I'm pretty good with.\n\nSongs can be downloaded here (txt files):\n\nhttp://usdb.animux.de/\n\nI'm going to play around with it on Windows to get into it.\n\nI believe Performous is still our best bet just because it's written with C++ and SDL (it also takes file formats from UltraStart it seems and various others). Makes porting definitley easier, since sadly there's no C# compiler for the Switch. Vocalux does seem to rely on the .NET Framework too, so no real chance on porting that.\n\nI just saw that the last commit to Performous was 6 days ago and they do have a Discord. Imma try looking around if they maybe have thought about porting it to consoles\n\nI believe Performous is still our best bet just because it's written with C++ and SDL (it also takes file formats from UltraStart it seems and various others).
