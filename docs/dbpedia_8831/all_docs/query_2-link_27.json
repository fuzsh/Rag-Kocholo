        "text": "Encoding & TXT\n\nEncoding has to be UTF-8 (without BOM).\n\nWhy? UTF-8 (without BOM) is a great encoding that can represent a vast number of symbols from all kinds of languages. Other encodings, like Windows code pages, are far more limited and are only suitable for a small family of languages.\n\nFile-Container has to be TXT.\n\nWhy? The TXT files are quite simple and easy to understand for non-coders. You can read them and edit them with a simple txt-editor. That's what made the format so popular in the first place. So even if there are many good mark up languages like xml we keep on using TXT-Files for this decade unless there are good reasons to change that.\n\nMandatory Attributes\n\nVERSION (new)\n\nThe version attribute helps the game and apps to understand how uptodate a song file is and how it should be treated. Ideally all txt files will be upgraded to the latest version. The value are version numbers according to semantic versioning. Song Editors, Managing tools or txt-hostings should set this automatically.\n\nApp Support\n\nApp Version Supported Comment UltraStar deluxe will be supported in 2024 ✔️ UltraStar World Party declined ❌ Vocaluxe will be supported in 2024 ✔️ Performous will be supported in 2024 ✔️ UltraStar Play will be supported in 2024 ✔️ Yass will be supported in 2024 ✔️ Karedi will be supported in 2024 ✔️\n\nTITLE\n\nThe title of the song.

Right now there is no definition for what this attribute should be used excactly. It's not displayed in the games.\n\nDeprecated\n\nHere are all the #-attributes that you shouldn't use anymore. Why? They are technical not necessesary today or just duplicates in the history of UltraStar games.\n\nRESOLUTION\n\nChanges the grid resolution of the UltraStar Deluxe editor. Only for the editor and nothing for singing.\n\nApp Support\n\nApp Version Supported Comment UltraStar deluxe > 2020.4.0 (2020-04-30) ✔️ UltraStar World Party 21.02 (2021-02-07) ❌ Vocaluxe 0.41 (2020-03-10) ❌ Performous 1.2.0 (2022-03-27) ❔ UltraStar Play 0.9.0 (2023-02-01) ❌ Yass 2.4.3 (2023-03-18) ❌\n\nNOTESGAP\n\nNobody knows what this was meant for but it was found in the some older codes of games. Don't use it.\n\nApp Support\n\nApp Version Supported Comment UltraStar deluxe > 2020.4.0 (2020-04-30) ✔️ UltraStar World Party 21.02 (2021-02-07) ❌ Vocaluxe 0.41 (2020-03-10) ❌ Performous 1.2.0 (2022-03-27) ❔ UltraStar Play 0.9.0 (2023-02-01) ❌ Yass 2.4.3 (2023-03-18) ❌\n\nRELATIVE\n\nSpecifies whether the note timings in the file are relative to the previous note or absolute. If this attribute is set to yes, the note timings are relative to the previous note. If it is set to no or not present, the note timings are absolute. If this line is missing, then the timestamps are absolute.\n\nRelative timestamps make working on a TXT file much easier, because if you want to insert a pause, you don't have to adjust all following timestamps, but only the ones until the end of the line.\n\nSwitching from absolute to relative and back is easy using either UltraStar Manager (two tasks) or USDX editor (S vs. SHIFT-S in the editor).\n\nApp Support\n\nApp Version Supported Comment UltraStar deluxe > 2020.4.0 (2020-04-30) ✔️ UltraStar World Party 21.02 (2021-02-07) ❔ Vocaluxe 0.41 (2020-03-10) ✔️ Performous 1.2.0 (2022-03-27) ❔ UltraStar Play 0.9.0 (2023-02-01) ✔️ Yass 2.4.3 (2023-03-18) ✔️\n\nDUETSINGERP1 / DUETSINGERP2\n\nSpecify the names of the singers for a duet song.
