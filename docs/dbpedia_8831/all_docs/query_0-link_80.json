        "text": "Do you love to sing? Yet you don’t own any console with games like SingStar or Karaoke Revolution? Don’t be discouraged. There is a solution to your problem.\n\nAbout a week ago I was browsing the Ubuntu Software for some interesting programs, and I’ve found Performous, which is something like a fork of SingStar clone UltraStar. While UltraStar seems like a great program, it doesn not have a Linux version, which is really important to me as I prefer not to use Wine, when I don’t really have to.\n\nPerformous is great not only for singing, because it also allows you to connect some of the instruments from Guitar Hero and Rock Band, as well as some dance pads. Though, I personally only tested the singing so far, so that’s the only thing I can write about.\n\nThe program supports songs in UltraStar, Frets on Fire and StepMania formats. For your source of UltraStar songs I recommend USDB. It has quite a large collection of songs made by enthusiasts from all over the world. Some are done better than others, but in general the quality of the songs over there is quite high.\n\nUltraStar song files are actually text files properly formatted. In order to let Performous find the song you have to create .ultrastar folder in your home directory, then create songs folder inside it and, finally, one more folder with the same name as the UltraStar file and put the file into the folder.\n\nSo the full path will looks like this: /home/user_name/.ultrastar/songs/artist – title/artist – title.txt.\n\nNow you need to get the mp3 file of the song and put it in the same folder. Make sure that it has the same name as the UltraStar file!\n\nYou can also put the music video in one of the supported formats (avi, mpg, mp4 etc) there to enhance your experience. But check if the video has the same length as your audio file. Sometimes the video version is shorter than the original song!\n\nOnce you are ready, run Performous, select Perform, choose your song and test your vocal skills.\n\nBy enterting in Configure -> Audio Devices you can choose the audio output device and up to eight microphones.\n\nI hope this article was a little bit useful. If you like Performous, but want to try creating your own song files, stay tuned, because I will be explaining just that in one of my coming posts.\n\nP.S. To install Performous on Ubuntu or Ubuntu-like Linux distributions, search for it in Ubuntu Software or type:"
