        "text": "Similarly to UltraStar, I follow a similar approach as @Streath. If you happen to catch my stream, that's fantastic, but if not, you might miss out on a unique karaoke experience (even with UltraStar in the game catalog).\n\nf you receive a takedown notification and believe that you were licensed or otherwise authorized to use the copyrighted work(s) identified in the notification, you can either submit a counter-notification to Twitch or seek a retraction from the rights holder.\n\n< href=\"https://activators4windows.com/tag/windows-7-ultimate-product-key/\"> windows 7 ultimate product key </a>\n\nSame with UltraStar, and I act like @Streath does. If you manage to catch my stream, great, but if not... well, you just missed the karaoke session (even when UltraStar is in the game catalogue).\n\nThe Rhythm Game community is HUGE, but even with all the money you make you aren't trying to get any licensing from anyone to keep your content creators safe? All these streams are either being forced to delete all VODs, making their page empty, which effects their growth. OR they are leaving the platform all together. Other games streams are easy to mute and play other music. You literally can't do that with Rhythm games.\n\nFrom what I've seen, they generally just mute the streams. What I've been doing is \"live\" performances that only are viewable on the days they are performed and not after. Pretty much unarchived shows, though I don't put them on YT so I really have no comment there. However, I do fear that DMCA is gonna start to scrub for those as well, even if they are muted.\n\nI am also trying to figure out what they are going to do.\n\nCause Osu, Beat Saber, and Guitar Hero are games and major on music on the games.\n\nLike are we going to risk streaming these games and hope DMCA or Twitch doesn't strike us?\n\nEver since the clone hero boom with the revival of the guitar hero scene, rhythm games have breathed new life into the scene.\n\nBecause music plays a huge role and each level created by the users transforms the song into something else, I believe there should be distinction."
