        "text": "Have you always dreamed of participating in a program like Operación Triunfo, but you have not succeeded yet? You have to know then that in the meantime, you can entertain yourself with some of the many programs available to install on your computer and have a fun time, as is the case of UltraStar, in which we are going to stop, especially for karaoke lovers.\n\nUltraStar Deluxe is a singing platform that offers a lot of game modes available related to karaoke so that we can spend an entertaining afternoon with our friends or family. All you need to be able to take advantage of this type of application is a microphone connected to your computer, nothing more than that.\n\nBeing an open-source program, UltraStar also ensures that users with sufficient knowledge about modifying programs from this point can make the changes they deem appropriate. This is no small matter, especially if you intend to enjoy great entertainment sessions with your friends or family and are looking for an application that suits your needs.\n\nUnlike other karaoke-oriented services, UltraStar Deluxe stands out because it already has several songs added to this utility from the beginning, so you won't have to download them yourself to start with. Of course, you can add the songs you want, either from those stored on your computer or from the files you have found on the web.\n\nWhen you already have so many songs in UltraStar that you find it difficult to access them, you have to know that you can find the ones you prefer from its Searcher integrated, which works well. This will allow you to filter the contents of the application, the songs according to their name, the artist who performs them, and even the album to which they belong, so do not hesitate for a moment to look for the ones you like the most.\n\nAnother feature of UltraStar that we also liked a lot is the possibility of adding all kinds of wallpapers to make the experience more entertaining while singing with our friends. You can add video files in today's most common formats, such as AVI, MPEG, FLV, or DivX, to play in the background while you are having fun.\n\nAt the same time, we are in the presence of a karaoke platform with many exciting game modes, such as dueling, blind singing, keeping in tune, etc. However, if we have to be honest, we have to say that the mode we liked the most is the one called Party , one that those who have also been users of SingStar will know since it is the same entertainment proposal.\n\nIndeed, if in the past you have tried your luck with SingStar and it hasn't convinced you, you should know that there is an excellent alternative that includes many of its main options, even adding others, so that you can have a great time.\n\nThe user interface of UltraStar is excellent. Although its sister UltraStar Deluxe is indeed somewhat superior, in any case, in both cases, it is easy to move between the different menus and available songs. Even we recommend that if you do not like the design, check the skins or skins that we have at hand, as several of them allow us to modify their appearance completely.\n\nOn the other hand, when analyzing the main strengths of UltraStar, we have to start without any doubt because it contains integrated songs from the moment we download it, something that, as we said, does not always happen. To that, we must add the possibility of adding more songs and videos to work as wallpapers and even the modification of its source code.\n\nWhat we liked least about UltraStar Deluxe is not related to weaknesses that we have found in this service, but because it may lose out in a direct comparison with its closest rivals, both SingStar and UltraStar Deluxe itself. Our recommendation, therefore, is that you install UltraStar when you feel that those options have not convinced you."
