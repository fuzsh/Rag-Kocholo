Ultrastar lets one or several players score points by singing along to a song or music video and match the pitch of the original song well. Ultrastar displays lyrics as well as the correct notes similar to a piano roll. On top of the correct notes Ultrastar displays the pitch recorded from the players.\"\n\nFor the full description, click here.\n\nTo download the Mac (intel) version, click here.\n\nFor songs to download, click here."
