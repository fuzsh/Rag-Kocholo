The reason is that our 2TB hard drive is physically dead (the data on it cannot be recovered with a normal recovery), and everything about our website is stored on it (the source code of website and software projects, especially all released and reserved versions of software – many of them are out of print, and you can’t find and download them anywhere except AppNee on the entire Internet).\n\nIn an effort to make up as much of the loss as possible, until recently we were able to revert updates to some smaller apps. Later, we will try to restore all software updates if possible, but we still can’t fix any older versions of software – because this data disaster is the worst in the past 10 years, there is any backup.\n\nIf some download link is missing, and you do need it, just please send an email (along with post link and missing link) to remind us to reupload the missing file for you.
