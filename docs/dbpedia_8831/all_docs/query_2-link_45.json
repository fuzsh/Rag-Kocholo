        "text": "I have found information from the Performous project in which they found the following information about the Singstar disks.\n\n1. \"Concerning the PKD, we found out that the encryption is vulnerable to watermark attack and thus were able to identify that it is actually a .pkf file with substitution cipher applied. The substitution table depends on byte offset but no other factors. This means that the algorithm is sufficiently weak to allow for known plain text attacks but so far we haven't been able to figure out exactly what kind of substitution is used or to extract the key.\"\n\n2. \"These seem to be encrypted in AES128-CTR mode but we haven't been able to extract the keys. Known plain text attacks have been successful but they don't get us very far because different SingStar releases use different keys.\"\n\n3. They apparently had success and created a program to convert Singstar disks to Performous files. This means that they broke the encryption. There is conflicting information about whether they broke encryption on both PS2 and PS3 disks. The program they created is called Singstar Ripper found here manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/ss_extract.1.html . There is also a wiki on how to use it here github.com/performous/performous/wiki/SingStar-ripper .\n\nI do not have Ubuntu on my computers so I will have to install Ubuntu sometime in the near future and try this out. I have about 300 Singstar songs on PS2 disks, another 300 on PS3 disks and 130 download files. If we can find a way to make all of these digital and add them to the Singstar app life would be grand ;-)\n\nI read the same threads, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to only decrypt the PS2 files from DVD, Performous. I do not own this game but I found it interesting so I read some info last night and everything you mentioned is what I also read. And also this:\n\nhttps://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=4170\n\nIt seems to be a bit harder to tackle. Unless this actually works:\n\nhttps://github.com/performous/performous/wiki/SingStar-ripper\n\nThat's all I could gather from the minimal time I spent researching this. As I said I don't own this game so all my efforts were for educational purposes to help you guys out lol.\n\nGDMorry thank you for all the work you have posted. When I get some time I will try to replicate your work. I have been very busy and not able to work on this quest but I am wondering if it will maybe be easier to find a way to decrypt the pak file from all the Singstar PS2 disks and then merge all of them into a giant pak file and then add the encryption back. I have seen other games that have pak decrypter tools that enable modification of the contents and then it re-encrypts the file using the original encryption code. In theory you take Singstar Pop PS2 disc and find the encryption code and crack open PAK files. Then insert every other decrypted Singstar PAK file into this Singstar Pop PAK file. Then use webMAN MOD mount_ps2 feature tutorial found here [TUT]Mounting PS2 SingStar on PS3 using webMAN MOD mount_ps2 feature | Page 2 | PSX-Place (psx-place.com) . Then I would have all of my downloaded songs and my PS2 Singstar discs available on Singstar digital.\n\nGoing to need some help trying to get my DLC songs working again.\n\nHave a slim CEX. Have had to format HD and transfered \"BCES00011SINGSTARFAMILY\" back over to the PS3 and I'm getting the \"This song cannot be played because its owner has been deleted. To play the song, first delete it via Delete Songs in Settings, and then download it again from the SingStar™.\" message.\n\nLooking at the save data in Apollo Save Tool it seems that the User ID: is 00000002 and account ID:xxxxxxxxxx(owner)\n\nDue to having to format the drive I am now User 00000001.\n\nThe account ID from the save file is the same as my current user.\n\nLast created user in the xRegistry.sys 5.\n\nIs there a way to change user 00000001 to 0000002? I've tried editing the Param.sfo of the save file with Apollo but when I copy it over data is corrupted.\n\nCould I use the xSystem.sys backup and change the lasted create to 1, create a new user oooooo2? I've been banned from the PSN due to CFW so I cant re-download the songs from the store if they are still there(banned for putting the CFW to try to backup the Songs). I'm assuming just creating a 00000002 with the same details wouldn't generate the same Account ID so I'd have to delete the 0000001 and change the account ID in the registry.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nfirstly read this entire thread to get the gist of it all and how it played out\n\nNOW as I pretty much summed up\n\nHere's what I did\n\n1. CFW (CFW 4.87.2 Evilnat Cobra [CEX]) on my Dodgy PS3 so I could ftp into it and get all the \"dev_hdd0\"files!\n\nEspecially the \"dev_hdd0\\game\\BCES00011SINGSTARFAMILY\" folder!\n\nOnly one file (/dev_hdd0/game/BCES00011SINGSTARFAMILY/USRDIR/DownloadSong/Pack0_100HR5.pkg.drm) refused to copy over and it seemed to have some sort of cyclic redundancy protection (it wouldn't ftp or copyto usb drive.... or even WebMan download? it kept restarting to the point of a 65Mb file being 1.5Gb?)\n\n2. CFW on donor PS3 and a larger HDD installed.\n\n3. WebMan (webMAN_MOD_1.47.33_Installer.pkg.706.v1.47.33_brewology_com.pkg) installed and used on both PS3's to copy and change IDPS & PSIDs.\n\n4. FTP'd all of /dev_hdd0 onto Donor PS3\n\n5. Created new User account and Deleted my original account (Donor PS3 made it user/00000009)\n\n6. Deleted ALL files in donor PS3 \"\\dev_flash2\" then FTP'd ALL original PS3's \"\\dev_flash2\\\" files over! I wanted to use the xRegistry.sys and it worked and changed my User ID and user/00000001 etc.\n\n7. Rechecked and changed the Console ID/DPS & PSID's again to the original PS3's\n\n​\n\nNow the only problem you have to consider is user number ... you NEED to delete the original user AND create one (even better two or more FAKE users) AFTER you have created fake users and deleted the original user you need to log in with a fake user and the UPLOAD or FTP the backup that you have of the “xRegistry.sys” (SEE parts 5 & 6) over to your PS.... then restart you now should be all good\n\nDeleted ALL files in donor (NEW) PS3 from \"\\dev_flash2\" then FTP'd ALL original PS3's (Backup) \"\\dev_flash2\\\" files over to donor (NEW) PS3 \"\\dev_flash2” !!\n\nCan you confirm that if i use xRegistryEditor075 to change the xRegistry.sys and change Last created user to 1 and ftp it over its not going to brick the ps3? I'm not copying anything to another ps3 so my situation is kind of different. Just need to create user 0000002 on the same console and don't want to have to format the HD and FTP everything over again. In the xRegistry.sys backup I'm still the wrong user number and the counter number is up to 6.\n\nI'm only proficient enough to put CFW on the console and not much more so apologies. Is there a way with I could change /setting/user/00000001/ to 00000002? With xRegistryEditor075 I can only change the VALUE of the setting not the /user/00000001 setting itself. If I could do that and it works that would be the shortest possible way to solve my problem.\n\nYeah, thanks heaps ... I managed to do this when you first suggested this And I was successful!\n\nAttempted to use xRegistry with no success at all.\n\nIF you do not have a back up of your /dev_hdd0 then FTP it over to a PC after this completes then I would format the PS3 HDD in a PC then reinstall it into your PS3 and let it set it up! (You will have lost EVERYTHING!)\n\nCreate a dud account = should now be user 1\n\nNow recreate your original account it should now be user 2 - FTP your dev_hdd0 backup back to your PS3\n\nFound a better solution.\n\nDid not need to reformat and copy everything back.\n\nChanged the last created user with xRegistry editor to 1 in the xRegistry.sys and Backup/xregistry.sys and that did the trick.\n\nFor the DRM downloaded content to work again didn't need to copy user ID and everything else to the newly created user 2 just needed to create user 2. Name didn't even have to be the same either."
