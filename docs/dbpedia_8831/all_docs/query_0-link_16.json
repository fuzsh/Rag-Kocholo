        "text": "UltraStar Deluxe is a karaoke game inspired by the SingStar game played on PlayStation. The point of the game is to match the pitch of the music. One or several players score points by singing along with a song or a music video. The game judges the pitch and rhythm of your voice and matches it with presets; if you sing too fast, too slow or go off-key you will lose points. You can see the lyrics and correct notes on a piano roll type display; the visuals are very attractive with sparkling stars and other effects.\n\nUltraStar can be played solo or, in Party Mode, with up to twelve people. There are two game modes, the first called Sing. Sing lets you select and sing a specific song; you can sing with friends to get a higher score. Up to six people can participate in this mode. In Party Mode you can make teams if you like and up to twelve people can play, battling for the highest score of at least two rounds and up to seven rounds.\n\nIf you prefer to hear songs other than those included in the software, you can add songs by uploading audio files with notes and lyrics. You can check the internet for txt-files or go to the UltraStar forum to get different songs. You can choose a background picture or even a video and also add your own original songs.\n\nWork is in progress to bring UltraStar to both Linux and MacOS."
