        "text": "UltraStar Deluxe\n\nOfficial Project Website: https://usdx.eu/\n\n1. About\n\nUltraStar Deluxe (USDX) is a free and open source karaoke game. It allows up to six players to sing along with music using microphones in order to score points, depending on the pitch of the voice and the rhythm of singing. UltraStar Deluxe is a fork of the original UltraStar (developed by corvus5). Many features have been added like party mode, theme support and support for more audio and video formats. The improved stability and code quality of USDX enabled ports to Linux and Mac OS X.\n\n2. Installation\n\nCurrently, the following installation channels are offered:\n\ninstaller (or portable version) for the latest release\n\nflatpak from flathub\n\nArch Linux AUR\n\n3. Configuration\n\nTo set additional song directories change your config.ini like this:\n\n[Directories] SongDir1=C:\\Users\\My\\Music\\MyUSDXSongs SongDir2=F:\\EvenMoreUSDXSongs SongDir...=... (some more directories)\n\nTo enable joypad support change config.ini Joypad=Off to Joypad=On\n\nTo enable 2 or 3 player each on 2 screens, disable the full screen mode, extend your desktop horizontally and set the resolution to fill one screen. Then, in the config.ini set Screens=2 and restart the game.\n\nThe primary folder for songs on OS X is $HOME/Music/UltraStar Deluxe, which is created when UltraStar Deluxe is run for the first time.\n\nOn OS X, by default the config.ini file is created in $HOME/Library/Application Support/UltraStarDeluxe when UltraStar Deluxe is run for the first time.\n\nWhen running in borderless fullscreen mode, the monitor it runs on can be configured by setting Graphics.PositionX/Y to an offset in pixels.\n\nIf installed via the flatpak package, the primary song folder is ~/.var/app/eu.usdx.UltraStarDeluxe/.ultrastardx/songs/ and the config.ini is located in ~/.var/app/eu.usdx.UltraStarDeluxe/.ultrastardx/ by default. To configure additional song directories, they first need to be made accessible to the flatpak app using the command: flatpak override eu.usdx.UltraStarDeluxe --filesystem=/your/new/songfolder - Afterwards, the directory can be added to the config.ini file as usual.\n\n4. Further documentation\n\nThe wiki contains more information on:\n\nCommand-line parameters\n\nControls\n\nCustomization\n\n5. Compiling\n\nThere are two main ways to compile the game:\n\nLazarus IDE\n\n./autogen.sh && ./configure [--enable-debug] && make\n\nThe executable will be game/ultrastardx[.exe].\n\nFor extended information, dependencies, OS-specific notes and configure flags, see COMPILING.md.\n\n6. Making a release\n\nSee RELEASING.md"
