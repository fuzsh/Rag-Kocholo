Version 0.4.0 introduced guitar, bass and drum features and 0.5.0 saw the addition of dance game component.\n\nThe game is written in the C++ programming language and from version 0.3.0 onwards uses OpenGL for graphics.\n\nThe main game package does not include any songs, like a player does not include any music, but there are various liberally licensed songs available from the homepage.\n\nGameplay[edit]\n\nThe game scores you based on how well you hit the notes. The game helps you by showing what pitch you are singing so that you can correct your voice.\n\nDevelopers[edit]\n\nList of developers can be found at Openhub.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nSee releases at SourceForge. Version 0.3.0 on 2008-11-03 renamed from UltraStar-NG into Performous.\n\nAvailability[edit]\n\nPerformous is cross-platform but each release usually doesn't include binary packages for every platform.[2]\n\nPerformous is also packaged in e.g. Debian, Ubuntu and Gentoo.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
