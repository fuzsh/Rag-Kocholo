        "text": "Please note: my UltraStar guides now have their own dedicated website on UltraGuide.net. An updated version of this article can be found here\n\nWow, it’s been a while since I got around to doing more UltraStar guides. There are only a few things left to cover: acquiring cover art for songs quickly and easily, song creation, and creating a song list. As you can see from the title, I am going with the latter today; in my experience, it can be an incredibly useful to have a printed list of songs when playing UltraStar with your friends. What’s more, there is one invaluable tool that makes it very easy for you: UltraStar Manager, which I mentioned briefly in an earlier post, is good for many things, such as Playlist creation and .txt file organisation. It is available to download on the link below:\n\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/uman/files/uman/1.8.x/uman-1.8.0-win32-setup.exe/download\n\nTo get started, download and install this tool if you haven’t already. You should then specify the various directories that it requests on its first start up: the main UltraStar folder (usually C:\\Program Files\\UltraStar Deluxe by default), the playlist directory (usually C:\\Program Files\\UltraStar Deluxe\\Playlists by default), and the song directory (usually C:\\Program Files\\UltraStar Deluxe\\Songs by default). Depending on how many songs you have, it may then take a while to load up.\n\nOnce this is done, you will see a list of your songs arranged by folder. The best thing to do with this program is to play around with it, though be warned: there are a few options that will edit all of your songs automatically, such as correcting the capitalisation of the song titles.\n\nTo get started on the Song List, click on the ‘Extras’ tab and then the far left option, ‘Create Report.’\n\nYou should then select all of the fields that you want included in your Song List: ‘Artist’ and ‘Title’ are a given and pretty much the only ones you’ll need, but it’s up to you if you want to include something extra, such as ‘Edition’ (to help identify songs that have been taken from SingStar) or ‘Video file exists?’ (if having a background video might be important to you or other players). Do remember, though, that this list will most likely be printed off on a portrait orientation, and it therefore might not be viable to have too many fields.\n\nOnce you’re happy with the selection of fields, there are two options to click on. For those that want to get the job done quickly, click on ‘HTML Report.’ For those that are more perfectionist, and have Microsoft Access installed on their PC, go with ‘Text Report.’\n\nFor those that went with HTML Report, choose a place you want to save it, and the file will open, listing all of your songs. There you go. Just need to print that off now. The main disadvantage here, though, is that there’s no ‘fine tuning’ what’s been produced – you can’t add or remove songs from that list manually, nor can you apply the tricks that you will see with the other option below. But, as I say, it’s cheap and cheerful, and it serves its purpose.\n\nThe other option, then, is to click on ‘Text Report’ instead. Choose a place to save it, then click ‘save.’ In its current form, it may seem pretty useless, but rest assured that file contains everything it needs for the likes of Excel and Access to understand it. Some of you may be familiar with fixed width .txt files; in which case, you can skip some of the next few steps.\n\nFirst of all, close UltraStar Manager and open Microsoft Access. My screen shots are from Office 2010, though hopefully they will help with an older version even if the two methods vary slightly.\n\nOnce you’ve opened Microsoft Access, create a new database and then click on the tab ‘External Data.’ After this, click on the ‘Text file’ option as demonstrated below:\n\nIn the pop up box, specify the text file that you want to import (the one that you saved using UltraStar Manager), leave the first option selected, and then click ‘next.’\n\nOn the next screen, leave ‘fixed width’ selected, and then click ‘next’ again.\n\nThe next part is a little bit fiddly, but it’s not too hard to get your head around. Access is now giving you the option of selecting where each column stops and starts (you can simply click where you want the columns to separate). There’s a lot of stuff there that you don’t need, though – the best thing is to isolate those bits into separate columns and make sure that ‘Artist’ and ‘Title’ only have the relevant text in them. This can be achieved by clicking just before the text for ‘Artist’ starts, and right before the ‘|’ part starts, as demonstrated below. Do the same for ‘title’, and remember to scroll right the way along to the side to cut off the ‘|’ part on the far right, as demonstrated in the second image.\n\nYou also have some dud rows here, but that can be sorted out at a later point. When you’re happy that you’ve successfully separated the columns (though if you do it wrong, you can go back and try again), click ‘next.’\n\nThe next screen gives you the option of naming the columns. As only two of these interest us, make sure that Field2 is named ‘Artist’ and Field4 is named ‘Title.’ This can be achieved by physically clicking on the respective columns and labelling them in the ‘Field Name’ box.\n\nOn the next screen, select ‘No primary key’ and then click ‘next.’\n\nChange the name of your report if you wish, and then click ‘Finish’ followed by ‘Close.’\n\nAs you will see when you go to open the newly created table (found on the left hand side of the screen), the format is a little bit of a mess, but it’s starting to look more like a proper list:\n\nThe next step is to open the table’s design view, by right clicking on the table as below:\n\nYou then just need to click on the irrelevant fields (i.e. those not titled) by right clicking on the appropriate rows and selecting ‘delete.’ You should just be left with the following:\n\nDouble click on the table on the left hand side to view the table normally (save changes when prompted), and it should look something like this:\n\nMuch better now! Just need to sort out those bothersome rows at the top. Easily done – simply select them both, right click, and select ‘Delete Record.’\n\nWe’re done with Microsoft Access now. You just need to select all the records in the table by clicking on the square in the top left hand side (to the left of the ‘Artist’ tile), and then right click on any record and select ‘copy.’ You should then open Microsoft Excel and paste the records into the new spreadsheet. Rearrange the columns in a manner that fits across a sheet of A4 paper with a portrait orientation.\n\nAs it’s your songbook, there are several different ways in which you might want to order your song list. I’ve noticed when I’ve been to karaoke nights that song books are traditionally printed arranged by the title of the song, rather than the artist. To arrange this, select column B, go to the ‘data’ tab, and click on the A-Z icon. Make sure you select ‘expand the selection’ on the next screen.\n\nFor the rest of this example, however, I will be showing screenshots sorted ascending by artist (the default setting), as that’s my preferred way of doing it. When sorting it this way, however, there is a little trick for counteracting the “The” problem, i.e. band names that start with the word “The,” such as The Beatles or The Cardigans. I for one am used to my iPod automatically disregarding this word, making finding the artist I want much simpler. We can have it this way, too – it requires sticking a formula in column C. Select cell C2 and paste the following mumbo-jumbo into it:\n\n=IF(LEFT(A2,3)=”The”,MID(A2,5,20),A2)\n\nThen copy this formula down to the bottom (hovering over the bottom right hand side of the icon until a little ‘+’ appears, and then double clicking, is the fastest way to do this).\n\nThis will return the same value as that in column A, except if the first word is “The,” in which case, it will simply return the remainder of the Artist name, e.g. “Beatles” or “Cardigans.” We can then order the list by column C in a similar way as described above. Once you’ve done this, you can delete the details in this column as they’re no longer required.\n\nThe next step is to make sure that the column headings are reprinted on each page for easy viewing. To do this, click on the page layout tab, and then click ‘Print Titles.’\n\nIn the ‘rows to repeat at top’ box, enter $1:$1, or select row 1 manually.\n\nThe next step is optional, depending on whether you would like to have file dividers in your song book or not, as in the picture below:\n\nYou will need to set realistic page breaks wherever you want the text to separate, e.g. between A and B, C and D, S and T-Z, etc. This can be achieved by clicking on the ‘View’ tab, and then selecting ‘Page break preview.’ You then just need to drag the markers until it separates the rows appropriately.\n\nYou may now want to double check through the print preview that everything fits nicely across a portrait page of A4.\n\nI think that’s just about everything – make sure you get permission from whoever pays the printer ink bills before printing this beast off!\n\nHere’s one I made earlier:\n\nPlease note: my UltraStar guides now have their own dedicated website on UltraGuide.net. An updated version of this article can be found here\n\nBy now I think I’ve covered the main ins and outs of UltraStar, so guides from hereon are more likely to be bonus materials.\n\nWhilst I’ve talked about the primary aspects of .txt files, it may be of interest to some people to understand exactly what the finer details of the files mean. They’re actually very straightforward files and aren’t difficult to get your head round. This is one of the many things that make the game work; I guess it encourages people to create songs for the game. Sadly, I won’t be able to produce an extensive guide on how to do this. I’ve made a handful of .txt files using the MIDI conversion tool within UltraStar itself, and I will talk about this at some point. However, this method does have its flaws and I think it is falling out of popularity with the more ‘professional’ song makers out there.\n\nSo, as I’ve mentioned before, each song file starts with a series of #tags. Those highlighted in red are necessary for gameplay. Those highlighted in green are not necessary.\n\n#TITLE: Title of the song\n\n#ARTIST: Artist behind the song\n\n#MP3: The name of the MP3 being used for this song. Must have a .mp3 extension included here\n\n#GAP: The amount of time, in milliseconds, before the lyrics start. This allows for any instrumental (or other type of) introduction to the song. It is important to note the number of the first note below. If it is not 0 (which is rare) then the #GAP will be less straightforward. If the lyrics aren’t set to start until 8 beats into the song, but the singing starts straight away, then the #GAP may need to be set to a negative number, to force the lyrics to start early.\n\n#BPM: Beats per minute. This signifies the rate at which the text should display. Put simply, fast songs have a higher BPM, slow songs have a lower BPM. To complicate it slightly, the BPM can be upped for slower songs as long as more beats are added in the main body of the song below. If the BPM of a song is high then it generally means a good, smooth .txt file with more attention to subtle changes in tone. But if that means nothing to you, then you don’t need to worry about this tag. If it is a good .txt file, then it won’t need changing.\n\n#GENRE: The genre of the song. As UltraStar has a ‘sort by genre’ option, it’s a useful tag to use. That, and the search option uses the word(s) in the #GENRE tag when you’re on the song selection screen, so you can automatically find all ‘rock’ songs, for example, if you use this tag.\n\n#EDITION: Typically refers to the SingStar edition, if applicable, that the .txt file is taken from. For organisational purposes, it’s good to leave this tag in.\n\n#COVER: Typically the single/album art appropriate for the song, to be displayed on the song selection screen. This is not necessary but it does brighten up the look of the game (and makes certain songs identifiable when not selected). This must be in .jpg format and the .jpg extension must be displayed here.\n\n#VIDEO: The name of the video file used for this song. Must have the file extension included out of the many types of video file that UltraStar accepts.\n\n#BACKGROUND: If you don’t have a video file, then you may prefer to have a background image displayed instead of a plain background or visualization. This must be in .jpg format and should have the .jpg extension attached. If the song is set to have a #VIDEO file and is linked in properly, then this tag is disregarded. If the .txt is set to have a #VIDEO but the video is not linked in properly for whatever reason, then the game will automatically display the background image.\n\n#RELATIVE: This is an unusual tag that I will talk about later. It is simply set to YES or NO. If it is set to YES, then it specifies a particular format of .txt file that functions in a different way to a typical .txt file. If the tag is absent, or is set to NO, then the .txt file functions as the others do. It is essential for this tag to be applied on a relative .txt file (these are rare. If you find one on USDB then the tag will be readily applied anyway).\n\nWhen the tags finish, then the main data for displaying the lyrics and notes, at the appropriate times and for the appropriate lengths of time, begins. That is, unless the song is a duet song, which I touched on briefly in my last entry. If it is a duet, then the file should start with P1, with P2 appearing somewhere in the middle.\n\nAs you will see, the .txt is sort of divided into 5 columns from hereon, with spaces separating each one. Take the first line of the .txt below, for example. The first column is :, the second is 0, the third is 2, the fourth is 12, and the fifth is Tee. Each row of .txt applies to a different syllable or note. Multiple syllables should not be included on the same line; in the example below, “Teenage” takes up two separate lines. The exception to the rule is when the note is a freestyle one, because no points are available then anyway.\n\nSometimes people do add more than one syllable to a line, but it technically shouldn’t be done and means that the .txt is imperfect. It’s not really possible to sing two syllables without breaking up the note. There are some exceptions, though, as you’ll see below: where it reads ‘family’ below, it is set to 2 syllables, rather than 3. This is because Mika sings ‘fam-lee,’ rather than ‘fam-il-ee.’\n\n: 0 2 12 Tee\n\n: 2 2 12 nage\n\n: 6 6 12 dreams\n\n– 12\n\n: 12 2 9 in\n\n: 14 2 7 a\n\n: 16 3 12 tee\n\n: 20 3 12 nage\n\n: 24 4 16 cir\n\n: 28 3 14 cus\n\n– 32\n\n: 32 2 16 Run\n\n: 34 1 16 ning\n\n: 36 2 16 a\n\n: 38 4 17 round\n\n– 42\n\n: 42 2 16 like\n\n: 44 2 14 ~\n\n: 46 2 12 a\n\n: 48 2 12 clown\n\n: 50 2 14 ~\n\n: 52 4 16 on\n\n: 56 3 11 pur\n\n: 60 3 12 pose\n\n– 64\n\n: 64 1 12 Who\n\n: 66 2 12 gives\n\n: 68 2 9 a\n\n: 70 4 12 damn\n\n– 74\n\n: 74 2 9 a\n\n: 76 2 12 bout\n\n: 78 2 9 the\n\n: 80 1 12 fa\n\n: 82 1 12 mily\n\n: 84 4 12 you\n\n: 88 4 16 come\n\n: 92 3 14 from?\n\n– 96\n\n: 96 1 16 No\n\n: 98 2 16 gi\n\n: 100 2 16 ving\n\n: 102 4 17 up\n\n– 106\n\n: 106 2 16 when\n\n: 108 2 14 you’re\n\n: 110 1 12 ~\n\n: 112 2 12 young\n\n: 114 2 14 and\n\n: 116 4 16 you\n\n: 120 4 11 want\n\n: 124 3 12 some\n\nThe first column\n\nThis can be one of 4 things: :, *, F, or -. Here’s a rundown of what they mean…\n\n: Regular note\n\n* Golden note\n\nF Freestyle syllable\n\n– Line break (separates lyrics into suitable lines).\n\nLine breaks are different to other types of row, in that they consist of a hyphen ( – ) and either one or two numbers. If it contains one number, it determines the beat at which the previous line will disappear. For example, in the first line of the song above, the ‘Teenage dreams’ line disappears as soon as it’s been sung, on beat 12. If the line break contains 2 numbers, the first number determines when the first line disappears, and the second determines when the next line will appear. There is no example of this type of line above, as it’s a fast moving song with no proper breaks from singing – line breaks containing two numbers are generally for songs with a large instrumental break in them. Two numbers aren’t at all necessary, however, as the game automatically puts the next line up when it is approaching – it’s only if you want to control when it happens that you need to worry about the ‘second’ number.\n\nSo, effectively, the first column states the nature of the note, or if it’s a line break. It’s pretty straightforward.\n\nThe second column\n\nThis specifies the number of beats into the song at which point this syllable appears. The higher the BPM, the sooner the beat will appear. This isn’t something you can really adjust without an image representation of the notes, but it’s the way that the game understands it.\n\nThe third column\n\nThis states the number of beats that the note goes on for. The longer the note, the larger the number. Technically, the length of the note in question should finish before the next beat starts. ‘Tee,’ for example, in the first line of the example, goes on for exactly 2 beats, and the ‘nage’ syllable picks up on beat 2, immediately after ‘Tee’ finishes. If they overlap, then scoring full points for the song is rendered impossible, as you can’t sing 2 notes at the same time, even if they only overlap fleetingly.\n\nThe fourth column\n\nThis contains a number code for the pitch of the syllable. Unfortunately, I don’t have a list of which numbers correspond to which notes, though I believe that ‘0’ is C1, so I guess you work either up or down from there (negative numbers are accepted).\n\nThe fifth column\n\nContains the text to be sung at that very syllable. As I’ve touched on, this should specifically refer to one portion of text for any words that are over 1 syllable long. In many cases, singers extend the syllable that they sing to show off their vocal range, and as you may have noticed, the standard format to represent this is to use ‘~’ to show that you are extending the syllable to a different pitch. In the example above, ‘you’re’ would normally be a single syllable, but Mika sings that first part and drops his voice slightly towards the end, so it will read as ‘you’re~’ on the game itself.\n\nOne of the most important things to bear in mind with this column is that UltraStar will automatically join the words together. You therefore need to include spaces at the end of each word, but do not include spaces for syllables in the beginning or middle of a word.\n\nSo, in the first example, if no spaces were included after each word, the song would read like this in-game:\n\nTeenagedreams\n\nInateenagecircus\n\nRunningaround\n\nLike~aclown~onpurpose\n\nIf you copy and paste the text in the first example, you will see that spaces appear at the appropriate points to stop this from happening, such as after ‘age,’ and ‘ing.’ Spaces are not necessary just before line breaks, but you can still use them.\n\nConversely, if you put a space after every syllable, it would read like this:\n\nTee nage dreams\n\nIn a tee nage cir cus\n\nRun ning a round\n\nLike ~ a clown ~ on pur pose\n\nPerhaps this error isn’t quite as bad as the first one, but it should still be avoided as it looks… stupid. Remember only to include spaces at the end of a word, not at the end of a syllable.\n\nFinally, it is very important to include ‘E’ at the end of the song, to tell the game when it finishes, or it will not work:\n\n: 1602 2 12 We\n\n: 1605 2 12 are\n\n: 1608 2 12 not\n\n– 1611\n\n: 1611 2 12 what\n\n: 1614 3 12 you\n\n: 1618 2 12 think\n\n: 1621 2 12 we\n\n: 1624 3 12 are\n\n– 1628\n\n: 1628 1 12 We\n\n: 1630 2 12 are\n\n* 1632 5 12 gol\n\n* 1638 3 12 den\n\n– 1642\n\n: 1642 2 12 We\n\n: 1645 2 12 are\n\n* 1648 5 12 gol\n\n* 1654 9 12 den\n\nE\n\nDo not include anything after the E, such as an extra line break, or the song may crash the game. Also, avoid putting a line break just before the E – this can confuse the game, too.\n\nRelative .txt Files\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, .txt files with a #RELATIVE:YES tag included are of a different nature to normal .txt files. To be perfectly honest, I hate them. If they contain errors, they’re difficult to track down and fix. However, given how different they are to normal ones, it wouldn’t be as extensive a guide if I overlooked them.\n\n#ARTIST:Beyonce\n\n#TITLE:Crazy In Love\n\n#MP3:Beyonce – Crazy In Love.mp3\n\n#BPM:198,4\n\n#GAP:15500\n\n#VIDEO:Beyonce feat. Jay-Z – Crazy In Love [VD#0,0].mpg\n\n#RELATIVE:YES\n\n: 0 2 62 Uh\n\n: 4 4 57 oh\n\n: 8 2 62 uh\n\n: 12 3 57 oh\n\n– 15 16\n\n: 0 2 62 Uh\n\n: 2 2 57 oh\n\n: 6 2 57 oh\n\n: 8 2 58 no\n\n: 10 2 57 no\n\n– 14 16\n\n: 0 2 62 Uh\n\n: 4 4 57 oh\n\n: 8 2 62 uh\n\n: 12 3 57 oh\n\n– 15 16\n\n: 0 2 62 Uh\n\n: 2 2 57 oh\n\n: 6 2 57 oh\n\n: 8 2 58 no\n\n: 10 2 57 no\n\nAs you’ll see, each line in the song counts from 0, rather from the very start of the song. These types of files are fewer and far between now, but there are still odds ones that you may come across.\n\nI think I’ve covered the various aspects of .txt files now – most of it, of course, you’ll never have to understand, though it may be useful to know a little more about them for troubleshooting purposes, and if you fancy making your own songs, this will serve as a good starting point. Like I said, I can’t help much there, but I will do an entry soon sharing what I do know about song creation that may help to get you going.\n\nPlease note: my UltraStar guides now have their own dedicated website on UltraGuide.net. An updated version of this article can be found here\n\nAs I briefly outlined in my introduction to UltraStar, there are a few different ways to play the game. This can depend on the version of UltraStar that you’re playing; I’ll go over the normal version first, but there is also another version called the ‘ChallengeMod.’ This isn’t quite as stable as the former, nor is it as smooth, but it still runs very well and has a lot of features that aren’t available on the normal version, which I will explain later in this article.\n\nUltraStar Deluxe\n\n‘Normal’ Play\n\nOn the current, ‘regular’ version of UltraStar Deluxe, you can select ‘Play’ on the initial menu; when it produces the players, you can rename them to you and your friends’ names, using the left and right keys to highlight a given player, backspace to remove the existing ‘Player 1’/’Player 2’ etc, and simply type in your real names instead.\n\nBy doing this, you’ll be able to identify players on the high scores menu. Remember, to change the number of players, you can go into ‘Options’ and then ‘Game.’\n\nUltraStar also gives you the option of selecting a difficulty. You may notice that on the ‘Hard’ level, the notes displayed are much thinner than those in the ‘Easy’ level:\n\nEasy\n\nHard\n\nThis is because the game tolerates less difference between the notes you’re singing and the actual notes you’re supposed to sing (a difference of two semitones is tolerated in Easy, 1 semitone in Medium, and no difference is tolerated in Hard). Given that I can’t sing very well, I usually go with Easy, and I think your fellow players might find it a bit more fun if they’re under the impression they’re doing well…! Each to their own, though. If you’re playing this with the Operatic Society, the players may want more of a challenge…\n\nOnce you’ve set up the game options, you can scroll through the songs and select one to sing. To search for a particular song, press ‘J’: a search box will appear, and you can type in the artist or song title (it will also bring up a particular folder that the songs are saved in, if you so wish). The number of songs on the screen will then be limited to those that meet your search critera. Select the song you want, and play it as per normal. Another keyboard shortcut that you may wish to use on the song selection screen is ‘R’: this will bring up a song at random. You can press this multiple times until something comes up that you want to sing.\n\nRegarding the general gameplay (the following applies to nearly all modes), beyond, of course, the idea to sing the lyrics at the point in which they’re highlighted, there are a number of quirks: Firstly, if you hadn’t noticed/didn’t know already, the notes take the form of a sort of piano scroll. It’s a bit hard to read it as sheet music, but you can judge, at the very least, whether the note should be higher or lower than the last one! The aim is to fill the colour of the notes by hitting them correctly. The more you do this, the higher your score. Not all of the lyrics, however, count towards your score. If they appear in Italics, no notes will appear on the screen – this is usually because they are not sung, but instead, rapped or simply spoken. These are called ‘free’ notes, and you’re welcome to talk/rap along if you wish, though it’s not necessary. There are also ‘golden’ notes, which are distinguishable (see the screenshot above for ‘Easy’ mode) by their shining appearance. Hitting these notes will be worth double the usual amount of points.\n\nParty Mode\n\nIn my personal experience, unless you and your friends are dying to do a particular song and therefore have one in mind, the process of choosing a song can be faffy (“Let’s do that one!”/”I don’t really know that one…”/”OK, how about this one?”/”Mmmm…”/”What do you want to sing?”/”What’ve you got?”/”A lot of songs, what do you like?”/”Have you got anything by Anonymous Socks?”/”No, how about The Beatles?”/”No, I don’t really like The Beatles…”/*Drops microphone* “Screw you guys, I’m going home”). It is much more fun, in my opinion at least, to play ‘Party Mode.’ This mode takes place over several rounds, with different modes of play. Players form up to 3 teams (this depends on how many microphones you have set up: 3 microphones=3 teams), and each team can have a number of players. For each round, the game ‘calls up’ certain players to sing (for this reason, it’s advisable to actually name each of the players here, so you don’t lose track of who’s who), one from each team grabs a mic, and UltraStar will choose a song (either from the entire pool of songs, a playlist, or a chosen folder in the song directory) at random. This narrows down the faff considerably – if one of the players really protests, then each team is allowed 5 ‘passes’ (or ‘jokers’) that will force the game to pick a new song; however, only 5 passes are available across all of the rounds, so they need to be used sparingly! At any rate, trying to sing a song you don’t know is just… well, hilarious.\n\nParty mode, then, wipes away your inhibitions and gets people going! Before going into more detail with Party Mode, it is worth mentioning ‘playlists’ at this stage. Whilst it can be amusing to try and sing a song you don’t know, it is more preferable to try one you can at least recall the chorus of. It may be a good idea to tailor the pool of songs used to that particular group of people. Playlists can be created by going to the normal song selection screen, finding the songs you want, pressing ‘P’ on each one, and adding it to a given playlist. It is easier, however, to download a program called UltraStar Manager. This is a great tool for many reasons that I daresay I will come back to in later entries. Using this software, you can drag and drop multiple songs at a time into a playlist. UltraStar Deluxe will recognise it when you next load the program. Failing this method, you can organise your song directory into folders, and you can choose one folder to use in the party mode. In each of the rounds in Party Mode, (2-7), there is the added element of the differing styles of play. The game will assign these modes to each round at random.\n\nDuel mode: Quite simply, the player/team with the highest score at the end of the song wins the round\n\nTeam duel (AKA “pass the mic”): Everyone gets involved, not just the players who are called up for that round. As the players are singing, the game will inform each team whom they must pass the mic onto at given points. The team with the most points at the end of the song wins the round\n\nBlind mode: The notes are not displayed onscreen; again, the person with the highest score at the end of the song wins\n\nUntil 5000: A race to 5000 points – the first player to achieve this wins, and the song finishes\n\nHold the line: There is a bar onscreen with a mark halfway across it. You basically need to keep your singing standard above this mark – if you falter, and it drops behind, then you automatically lose. The team who manages to keep their line above the mark will win. The song will end when there is only one player left standing.\n\nFor each win, a given team is assigned 1 point. The team with the most points at the end of all of the rounds wins the game.\n\nChallengeMod\n\nIf the types of gameplay described above float your boat, then the regular version of UltraStar will be just fine. What I particularly like about the newer versions of the normal UltraStar game is the fact that you can set visualizations to play when there is no video available – it’s also faster and more stable. The ChallengeMod version, however, is certainly improving with every release. I’m hoping that, at some stage, the two versions will be combined, but it may be a while before that happens. At any rate, I have both versions on my computer: the normal version for Party Mode or normal play, and the ChallengeMod for medley mode and duet mode.\n\nMedley Mode\n\nMedley Mode, available in the ChallengeMod version, is a very interesting addition to UltraStar. On the normal song selection screen, press shift + D. The game will then pick 5 songs at random, and play, in a row, the choruses from those 5 particular songs. The players build up a score across the medley, and the winner is the one with the most points at the end. For each song, the game eases you in, by initially playing the lyrics in italics (no points are available) so that the players can familiarise themselves with the song. It counts down to when the chorus begins, and then the players can start to sing if they haven’t already. It’s definitely a fun one – in this case, if someone doesn’t know the song, it doesn’t matter too much!\n\nDuet Mode\n\nI was very pleased when this aspect was added – it’s one of the main things that SingStar had over UltraStar in the past. This mode requires a certain type of .txt file that divides a song into two parts: one for Player 1, and one for Player 2. When this is successfully in place, lyrics that are for Player 1 to sing are displayed at top of the screen, Player 2 at the bottom. For songs that are duets themselves (usually with a male and a female part, though it may also be divided into ‘lead’ and ‘backing’), this mode works very well – the lyrics can ‘overlap’ each other, so that Players 1 & 2 can sing different things at the same time. Many of the SingStar games contain duet songs, and most of these are available for UltraStar. USDB contains a number of duet songs, and the admins have nicely classed these songs under a specific edition: ‘[DUET] Songs.’\n\nThere is one particular thing you need to do when you download these files, however. All of Player 1’s part is listed at the top of these files, and Player 2’s underneath it. All you need to do is place ‘P1’ just before the notes start, but after the #tags, as demonstrated below:\n\n#TITLE:A Whole New World (Duet)\n\n#ARTIST:Aladdin\n\n#LANGUAGE:\n\n#EDITION:SS Disney\n\nMP3:Aladdin – A Whole New World.mp3\n\n#COVER:Aladdin – A Whole New World [CO].jpg\n\n#VIDEO:Aladdin – A Whole New World [VD#0].avi\n\n#BPM:240\n\n#GAP:8125\n\nP1\n\n: 0 7 66 I\n\n: 8 3 64 can\n\n: 12 8 67 show\n\n: 20 3 66 you\n\n: 25 5 62 the\n\n: 31 17 57 world\n\nYou also need to tell the game where Player 2’s part begins. This is easy to find… scroll down the .txt file, and you’ll notice that the numbers on the left are ever increasing (these are the beats into the song… I’ll get around to explaining .txt files properly at some point!). At some point, these numbers should suddenly revert to something lower. If you know the song well, you should be able to identify player 2’s lines, too. In between the high number and the low number, you should add ‘P2,’ as demonstrated below:\n\n– 1897 1920\n\n: 1940 13 60 You\n\n: 1953 6 58 and\n\n: 1959 12 57 ~\n\n* 1972 109 57 me\n\nP2\n\n: 693 2 66 A\n\n: 697 6 67 whole\n\n: 704 6 71 new\n\n* 711 33 69 world\n\nI hope this makes sense. At some point, maybe this won’t be necessary, it’s just that USDB automatically removes these when a .txt is uploaded.\n\nWhen this is done, and you’ve loaded up UltraStar ChallengeMod, you can edit these songs in the usual way. Whatever you set the #GAP to indicates when the first player will start, usually Player 1. You can press shift + tab to switch to player 2 and ensure that their part fits, too – though the #GAP will still refer to Player 1.\n\nBecause of the nature of duet songs, I’ve got two copies of ChallengeMod on my computer (as well as 1 copy of normal UltraStar) – one that links to the normal song directory (for Medley Mode), and one that links purely to a folder of duet songs. That way, if someone fancies doing a duet, I can just boot up that version. Duet songs won’t appear in Party mode, anyway, but it makes things a bit more organised. If you’ve already got some .txt files that you would like to turn into duets, this is easily done. Open the .txt file for the song, and for each of player 1’s lines, add P1 above it. For each of player 2’s lines, add P2. If you come across a line that both parts sing, add P3 in front of it.\n\nPlease note: my UltraStar guides now have their own dedicated website on UltraGuide.net. An updated version of this article can be found here\n\nSorry it’s been so long since my last UltraStar updates, but I’ve been very busy with the program itself, getting it ready for Christmas!\n\nNote: I have no idea if these guides are proving useful – looking at my site stats, I notice that I’m getting a handful of hits a day from people trying to find out how to set up their microphones etc. It would be great to hear from you either way… tell me it’s been useful, totally unhelpful, or perhaps some elements need further clarity. That, and whilst I’m no expert on the game, if you want to fire a question or two at me then I’ll be happy to help if I can.\n\nNow that we’re done with the bare necessities of the game, we can move on to the bonus tutorials. This section will look at how to add video files to the songs. Video files are not necessary, but many people prefer to use them as they definitely enhance the experience of the game. As a result, and this is something that you’ll probably want to note, many people make .txt files that match the video version of the song, rather than the album version or the radio edit. Quite often, this doesn’t make a difference (music videos normally use the same version of the song in question), but on a number of occasions, it can. For example, I was adding ‘Rock the Casbah’ by The Clash the other day, and the text didn’t match the lyrics towards the end of the song. I added the video version instead, and the problem was rectified.\n\nMany users on USDB won’t specify what version of the song their .txt file refers to, so this trial-and-error process can be quite common. It’s worth looking at the comments at the bottom of the song – these can quite often be in another language, primarily German. If you don’t speak the language, paste the comment into Google Translate, and you can normally get the jist of things. It is often stated which version of the song you’re supposed to use.\n\nAs well as making the game more fun, adding video files can make obtaining the songs you want much easier. For example, I actually really hate Cheryl Cole’s ‘Fight For This Love,’ the song that I used in my adding songs tutorial, but I decided to put it on there, because some people like it (failing that, a lot of people at least know it), and I want to widen the appeal of my collection as much as possible. I don’t want to buy the MP3, because I won’t be adding it to my iPod. The sound quality generally isn’t as good, but when you and your friends are screeching your hearts out over it, you probably won’t notice!\n\nYour first stop for music videos, of course, is YouTube (though DailyMotion is a good place, too). Using the download helper add-on for Mozilla Firefox, it’s possible to download videos in .flv format to your computer. Once you’ve downloaded and installed this feature, visit the video of the song you want, and eventually the (new) icon next to the address bar will begin to move. This means that Firefox has detected the video on the page, and it is possible to download it.\n\nClick on the arrow next to the icon, and select any of the options referring to the video (it doesn’t matter which one, I don’t think, but correct me if I’m wrong). The video will begin downloading, though you should navigate away from the video on the browser first, or you’ll be waiting there all day.\n\nNow that you have the video file, you’ll also need an mp3 containing the same audio used in the video file (you could try adding the normal mp3 if you like, but getting it to synchronise with the video can be tricky – if you want to have a go, the #VIDEOGAP tag in the .txt file specifies when the video should start playing, and this is independent of the normal #GAP tag, which specifies when the audio should start). There are a number of tools that will create an mp3 based on your video file. Those downloaded from YouTube are usually .flv files, but you can get .mp4 files from DailyMotion, and these are much easier to contend with!\n\nFor .mp4 files, I’d recommend downloading DBpoweramp. Once this is installed, you can simply right-click on the video file, select ‘convert to,’ and create an mp3 file in the same directory. This will also work for a number of other file types, both audio and video (not .flv, sadly).\n\nFor .flv files, you can use a number of .flv convertor programs, plus some online facilities that link directly to the YouTube video itself, such as www.flv2mp3.com.\n\nOnce you have a video and an audio file, place them both in the same directory as your .txt file, and link the two files in the .txt file using the appropriate tabs, for example:\n\n#ARTIST: Cheryl Cole\n\n#TITLE: Fight For This Love\n\n#MP3: Cheryl Cole – Fight For This Love.mp3\n\n#VIDEO: Cheryl Cole – Fight For This Love.flv\n\nThe next step is to open UltraStar Deluxe and test the song – does the video file load? If not, make sure you’ve spelled the filename correctly and used the right file extension. To get the text to synchronise with the lyrics, use the same method with the built-in editor function that I described in the adding songs section. Enjoy, and please let me know if this was useful or not!\n\nPlease note: my UltraStar guides now have their own dedicated website on UltraGuide.net. An updated version of this article can be found here\n\nProbably about time this game was actually playable, right?!\n\nThere are a couple of options when it comes to microphones for UltraStar. You can simply plug one into the microphone slot on your computer (this can be any working type that fits that slot), or the best option is to simply buy some SingStar microphones, complete with a USB connector, like the ones below:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001J6N8BM/ref=s9_simh_gw_p63_d1_i1?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0JE19CC93DQD8STWVY7A&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=467128533&pf_rd_i=468294\n\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001TK3GVU/ref=s9_simh_gw_p63_d1_i2?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0JE19CC93DQD8STWVY7A&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=467128533&pf_rd_i=468294\n\nI haven’t tried the second option yet (wireless mics), but I’m hoping to get some soon and I believe that they’re very good. Obviously, it means a lack of wires, which is always a bonus. The only way to have over 3 people singing at once is to fix it up so that there is a ‘dual display’ (that is, having both the computer screen and another TV/computer screen connected). I’ve never tried this, but if you know your stuff, setting this up won’t be too hard. For everyone else, this means that you need 1-3 microphones (probably best to buy 2 lots of 2 mics, that way you have a spare if one of them breaks!). I currently have only 1 USB connector, as one went missing. I therefore have it set up so that 2 SingStar mics are plugged into their USB connector, and 1 is plugged into the microphone slot in my laptop. As these are what I have at my disposal, I will demonstrate how to set up the microphones in this manner. However, I’m fairly sure the microphone input on the laptop is not quite as sensitive as the USB connector (poor player 3 is at a disadvantage!) – I would recommend using 2 USB connectors, with only 1 microphone plugged into 1 of them (into the blue slot), and 2 plugged into the other.\n\nLeft: Red microphone plugged into default computer soundcard (player 3)\n\nMiddle: Blue microphone plugged into USB connector (player 1)\n\nRight: Red microphone plugged into USB connector (player 2)\n\nSo, you’ve got your microphones, and you’ve set them up as demonstrated (if you only have 1 or 2 microphones, this guide still applies). Before you go into UltraStar, you’ll need to edit the settings on Windows (sorry Apple fanboys, you’ll have to find instructions elsewhere). If you go to the Control Panel -> Hardware and Sound -> Manage audio devices, and click on the ‘Recording’ tab (or something to that effect if you’re not on Windows 7), you can test the microphones to see if they’re working. You’ll notice that the USB adaptor is listed, and its settings need to be configured separately to the default soundcard.\n\nFor the USB connector with 2 microphones, you’ll need to tell the computer that the adaptor has a dual input, or else it’ll only recognise 1 microphone. Right click on the 2 USBMIC option, and click ‘properties,’ then select the ‘advanced’ tab.\n\nAs shown above, select any one of the ‘2 channel’ options (preferably the highest quality setting if possible). Apply the other settings above, too, if they’re not in place already.\n\nFor a USB connector with 1 microphone, you can leave the settings as they are. Nothing needs doing to the default soundcard (i.e. the microphone plugged into your laptop’s ‘normal’ input), though you might want to adjust the settings to make it as sensitive as possible. This way, player 3 will be at less of a disadvantage. You don’t want to go making the microphones plugged into the USB connector too sensitive, or they’ll pick up too much background noise.\n\nOnce the microphones are set up in Windows, load UltraStar Deluxe. Once loaded, go into tools -> settings -> ‘record.’ At the top of this section, you’ll see one of the inputs listed at the top. This just means that you are altering the settings for one of the inputs (USB adaptor or default soundcard) – it does not mean that you can only use one input at a time. It does not matter what is left there when you exit the settings configuration. Use the left and right keys to select USB adaptor. If you have more than one USB adaptor, you can determine which is which by talking into the microphones (the program will respond to your voice).\n\nThe numbers alongside the ‘Channel1’ and ‘Channel2’ channel indicate which player will be assigned to which microphone. For the USB adaptors, the left channel is the blue mic, and the right channel is the red mic. Make the left channel player 1 and the right channel player 2 (as demonstrated above). Then select the other input (either the other USB adaptor or the default microphone slot). Again, test to make sure that you have the correct microphone selected. Make this microphone player 3 on the left channel, and leave the right channel at ‘Off.’\n\nI hope this makes sense! If you want to sing with multiple players now (or just test it), you’ll need to configure the game settings to say you’re playing with more than 1 person. Press escape to exit the microphone settings, and go into ‘game’ (also under the settings menu). At this point, simply change the number of players to 3. Press escape twice to come out of settings, go to ‘sing,’ and test the microphones. Players 1 and 2 should correspond to the microphone colour. Player 3 will obviously be a blue or red microphone, though its colour onscreen is green. To avoid confusion, I dressed that mic with a green ribbon!\n\nThis article isn’t finalised… I can imagine it’s extremely un-user friendly right now. In the meantime, have a play!\n\nPlease note: my UltraStar guides now have their own dedicated website on UltraGuide.net. An updated version of this article can be found here\n\nStart off by downloading the program from the official website: http://ultrastardx.sourceforge.net/usdx-downloads/usdx/\n\nThere are a number of options on the above link. Though the current version of UltraStar isn’t actually final, it’s pretty damn awesome and much better than the older versions. It’s very stable and runs well. To obtain this version, click on the installation appropriate for your operating system, and download the installation file.\n\nThe ChallengeMod is fantastic as well, but that’s for another time.\n\nOnce it’s downloaded and installed, run UltraStar Deluxe. The start screen will look something like this:\n\n1) Sing – what it says on the tin. It will take you to your collection of songs, and you can browse through them using the left and right keys, pressing enter to make your selection.\n\n2) Party – As I mentioned in my last entry, this takes the game to a whole new level when you’ve got a group of people playing, with various different modes including blind (the notes do not show), first to 5000 (the song ends when 1 player has achieved this), and ‘pass the mic’ (where the whole group gets involved). The game chooses which players from each team are going to sing on each round. It is typically played across 7 rounds; the team with the most points across the rounds is the overall winner.\n\n3) Tools – this contains a MIDI file converter (more on this at another stage) and setup options. These will be necessary when you set up your microphones, and like most programs it offers options for changing the appearance and turning on/off certain features.\n\n4) Quit – self-explanatory.\n\nI would recommend going into the ‘Sing’ option and selecting one of the sample songs as a starting point. There should be a couple of freebies in there. Even though your microphones won’t be set up yet, it gives you an idea of the gameplay. Use ‘escape’ to exit the song.\n\nAdding songs\n\nThe necessary files for the songs are stored in a folder in the UltraStar directory. To add them, you should create a new folder for each song you add in C:\\UltraStar Deluxe\\Songs (unless you specified a different directory on installation). Give the folder a name that will make it easy to identify, such as ‘Cheryl Cole – Fight For This Love.’ Within each song folder, as the bare minimum, you will require:\n\n1) A .txt file tailored for the song in question (more on this in a second)\n\n2) An mp3 of the song\n\nOptionally, the following types of file can also be added to the folder. These are not essential but do enhance the gameplay experience:\n\n3) The song’s music video (most standard video formats are compatible with UltraStar, such as .avi, .flv, .wmv, .mp4).\n\n4) An image to display in the background of the song while it is being played (this is an alternative option to having a video. If a video file is set to play, then the image will not be displayed).\n\n5) A CD cover image of the song (or the album that it’s from). This will then be displayed when you flick through the songs on the selection screen.\n\nI won’t go into the latter 3 options at this stage (they’re not hard to add, but I’m trying to keep this as simple as possible). Instead, I will concentrate on the 2 files that you really need: a txt file and an mp3.\n\nFirst of all, to really get started, you can easily obtain all the files you need for all songs that are on the existing SingStar games. In certain places. On these places, just search for UltraStar, and you’ll have a number of things to choose, including homemade packs and the aforementioned SingStar games. If that method’s not your cup of tea, but you already own some of the SingStar games, there are programs that will rip your games onto the computer for you, which you can find on the old UltraStar Deluxe Wiki.\n\nI’ve never tried these programs myself, and don’t know how up-to-date those links are, but presumably they’re straightforward enough.\n\nThe following method of adding songs applies to anyone reading this. If the options above aren’t applicable to you, or you want to add some non-SingStar songs, follow the steps below.\n\n1) In order to obtain a .txt file of a song, there are a number of websites you can use. By far the best one I’ve found is http://usdb.animux.de. You’ll need to sign up with an account first, but this is easy enough. Once you are able to login, you will have access to thousands of .txt files (NOTE: the mp3s are not available here, more on this in a second). Remember, .txt files only contain information about how to display the correct notes and lyrics at the correct time.\n\n2) Select “browse songs” on the left hand side, and you can surf this site by artist, genre, or SingStar editions (these files are direct rips from SingStar using a program like the ones I’ve linked above).\n\n3) Find and click on a song you like. To make this easier, though, try and find one that’s rated 5 stars. That’s not to say that anything less (or none at all) is a bad file, but it’ll make things easier to begin with. In bad text files, notes can be wrong and the lyrics may be out of time.\n\n4) It’s also advisable to make this a song that you already own in mp3 format. Unfortunately, this is the only compatible audio format with UltraStar, so if you’ve downloaded it from iTunes, for example, you may need to download a program to convert it into mp3 format.\n\n5) Click on ‘download text.’ This will then take around 30 seconds to load, unfortunately. As the site says, you can reduce this time by adding your own song files to the database.\n\n6) When it’s loaded, save the .txt onto your computer (preferably in the folder in the UltraStar songs directory that you’ve already created, e.g. C:\\UltraStar Deluxe\\Songs\\Cheryl Cole – Fight For This Love).\n\n7) Find/obtain an mp3 of the song, and put this in the same folder.\n\n8) Open the .txt file. The document should look something like this:\n\n9) The information at the top of the file is known as ‘tags.’ Each aspect, e.g. #ARTIST, #SONG, #EDITION, #MP3, #GENRE etc, is known as a ‘tag.’ The one that we are interested in at this point is #MP3. The filename next to the tag should be identical to the filename of your mp3. If it’s not already, then either change the tag to the filename of your mp3, or change the name of the mp3 to that listed in the tag. When you have done this, you have effectively ‘synchronised’ the .txt with the mp3.\n\n10) Save the .txt, and load UltraStar Deluxe. If all goes to plan, when you go into the ‘Sing’ option, your new song will appear. If it doesn’t, retrace your steps and check the .txt file again. Does it have .mp3 on the end? This is essential. Is there a rogue space somewhere? It needs to match the filename exactly.\n\n11) You may want to try playing the song now. Do the lyrics start at the right time and enlarge at exactly the right points? If so, then you’re very lucky. If not, then it’s to be expected. This is because not all mp3s are the same – some contain a significant amount of silence before the song starts (and others don’t), though you may not realise it. The person who made the .txt file will have been working with a different mp3 to the one that you own (or possibly the video version of the song, which tend to have longer introductions).\n\n12) If you’re one of the lucky ones, and the lyrics of the song effectively pop up as Cheryl Cole is singing, then you don’t need to do any more at this stage. However, you’ll probably need the next bit of information, because the next song might not be as simple!\n\n13) Press escape to exit the song, and again until you’re back at the song menu (where it’s showing a preview of the song, just before you select it to start singing). Instead of pressing enter, hit the letter ‘E’ on the keyboard. This brings up the built in song editor.\n\n14) What you need to do, now, is adjust the #GAP tag on the song’s .txt file so that it allows the exact amount of time you need before the lyrics start, no more and no less. This can be achieved using this built-in song editor, on screen now.\n\n15) The #GAP is a given amount of time in milliseconds before the very first note/syllable starts. For Cheryl Cole’s Fight For This Love, this allows for a brief instrumental introduction at the beginning (and for most songs, this is the case).\n\n16) You’ll notice that the first line of the song is displayed, and the first syllable highlighted. Press the space bar. It will play a very brief snippet of the audio that is currently set to appear at that point. Is it before the syllable you want, or is it after? A general giveaway for this is whether it sounds instrumental (the song starts too early) or whether it is the singer’s voice (it starts too late).\n\n17) If it is too early, you need to INCREASE the gap by pressing the ‘0’ (zero) key. If it is too late, then you need to DECREASE the gap by pressing the ‘9’ key.\n\n18) You’ll see the #GAP tag on the above section starting to change. This may require some trial and error. As you alter the #GAP, press space every so often, and see what difference it’s made.\n\n19) Remember that you are decreasing/increasing the #GAP a millisecond (1000th of a second) at a time, so you’ll need to press it a few times. If the song is drastically out of synch, then press ‘shift’ + either 9 or 0. This will change the #GAP a second at a time, but this may be too much of a jump if the song is only slightly out of synch.\n\n20) In short, what you are looking for is for the first note to play the syllable at the start of the song, nothing more and nothing less. In this case, I want Cheryl Cole saying ‘Too,’ not a slight bit of music and ‘T-‘. It’s tedious, but once you get the hang of it, it’s straightforward.\n\n21) If this note doesn’t give you much to go on and you’re finding it a struggle, you can try playing around with a different one. Navigate between notes using the left and right keys, and to different lines using the up and down keys. If the audio synchronises with the new syllable, it will synchronise with the rest.\n\n22) Hopefully you’ll achieve this without too much hassle, and remember that once you get the hang of it, the process will be much quicker (I usually jump straight to this editor before I even play the song, after adding a new one).\n\n23) BEFORE YOU EXIT THE EDITOR…\n\na. Have you managed to make the song synchronise with the text? If so, press ‘S’ to save the changes. It will not prompt you to do this, so it’s very important to remember!\n\nb. Have you made a complete mess of it and want to start over? Just press escape and exit without saving… no harm done!\n\n24) Exit the editor by pressing escape. It will take you back to the song selection screen. Select the song you were working on, and hopefully it’ll display perfectly!\n\n25) Either repeat these steps for the other 1,999 songs you want to add, or add them automatically by other means ;)\n\n26) OTHER THINGS TO BEAR IN MIND…\n\na. A small number of .txt files have a set starting point as well as a #GAP. It’s difficult to explain this, but if you come across one of these .txts, you can put the #GAP in negative figures if necessary! You don’t need to worry about this for now, just remember that it’s a possibility.\n\nb. Don’t despair if you don’t have an mp3 of the song. In my forthcoming guide to adding video files, you won’t need to have the mp3s already, because you use the audio that is on the video file.\n\nNext up: how to set up the microphones!\n\nIf you already know what UltraStar is, then there’s no real need to read the rest of this entry, which will serve as a general introduction.\n\nIf you know what SingStar is, and hate the Playstation game to its very core, then this article may not be for you.\n\nIf you don’t know what SingStar is, but hate karaoke, then go home and await a visit from the ghost of Christmas past. Or, perhaps, simply keep an open mind.\n\nKaraoke isn’t about singing. That’s a bi-product, as is the fact that the songs are invariably butchered. Primarily, it’s about having a good time with friends. The SingStar games for the Playstation 2 & 3, if you didn’t already know, take this aspect and turn it into a computer game, enhancing the experience with music videos, different modes of play, and scoring the players depending on how well they sing. It’s brilliant fun, but has its drawbacks. First of all, not everyone owns a PlayStation. This may sound presumptuous, but I’d say that love of karaoke tends to negatively correlate with love of the more serious ‘curtains drawn on a beautiful sunny day’ computer games. Granted, PlayStation 2s don’t cost much these days (and games like Buzz also make for great party antics), but the PlayStation 3 (now being marketed for its party gaming aspects) costs… well, a lot, to some people. That’s not to mention money for equipment and the games themselves.\n\nThis brings me to my next point. The PlayStation 2 SingStar titles are somewhat limited. Only one game may be played at a time, and within that game, you have but a pool of 30 songs. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had some great fun in the past, but it’s rapidly exhausted, and you’ll soon be wanting to buy another one to add some variety. Plus, within a given group of people, you’ll be lucky to pick up a game containing a songpool that caters for everyone. Switching between different games can work, but then the brilliant ‘party mode,’ in which the game is played in teams and carries on over several rounds, is not possible to play.\n\nSingStar for the PlayStation 3 works differently. Songs may be downloaded (at a price) and can all be used in the same songpool. This overcomes some major drawbacks with the PlayStation 2 experience: the limited number of songs, the limited variety of songs, and the inability to play with a massive selection of songs for party mode. I also understand that it has many new amazing features all round. However, that’s still a fair amount of money, plus more and more expense every time you want to add some songs. You also may be left waiting on that particular song you really want, which may not even be possible given disputes between Sony and the record label, or something. You’re limited to what they tell you is possible, and that’s that.\n\nFinally, to the point. UltraStar is a piece of open-source PC software that simulates the format of SingStar. It’s not like the cheap imitations for the X-Box or the Wii, and it’s completely free. I discovered it about a year ago when I was going to buy a PlayStation 2 and a couple of the SingStar games to give my family something to do at Christmas. I stumbled across its Wikipedia article, and did a bit more research. Initially, it was a German game, and so many fansites are in Deutsch. As a result, I think it manages to stay under the radar somewhat.\n\nWhen I say it’s a German game, don’t let that put you off. It’s been translated into English, and the vast majority of the songs available are in English, as well as many of the websites (including the official one). The best part about this game is the sheer number of songs you can have in the songpool (I currently have about 1,500, and it could be so much more!), so it matches the PS3 experience in that respect. What’s more, all songs available on the PS2 SingStar titles can be downloaded for it, in exactly the same format. Christmas with my family in 2009 was a blast.\n\nBut that’s just the surface. Anyone can create songs for UltraStar. When I say make songs, I mean they can create the necessary files to go with songs that already exist and display the correct notes and lyrics at the correct times. And when I say anyone, I mean that lots of people do make an incredible number of songs available to download for the game, free of charge. These songs range from very recent chart hits to the most obscure songs known only to the geekiest of nerds:\n\nThere is definitely something available for everyone. There are some drawbacks to this, however. First of all, not all the song files (written in .txt format… Notepad, that is) are perfect, and some are far from it (you can avoid such dud jobs, though, which I’ll explain at another time). Amateur versions of songs also need to be added carefully, and tied with an mp3 of that song and/or a video file. Using UltraStar therefore requires some patience, and lacks the ‘plug and play’ aspects of SingStar. However, once you get the hang of it, this part is very straightforward – I’m planning on doing extensive guides for this aspect, too, which might help. Adding the songs ripped directly from SingStar games is easy enough, too, so it’s still a great option – it depends on how far you want to go with it. For me, it’s become a hobby, but I really enjoy that sort of thing. I intend to use this blog to publicise updates for the UltraStar software and anything else noteworthy to report. I also plan to make various guides for more advanced users (such as how to create songs, though I’m definitely no expert in that respect). Firstly, however, I’d recommend downloading the software from the official site to get yourself started. Go on, have a play. It comes with songs already on it, so you may see how it works. I’m going to update with beginner guides on how to get started with the game over the next week."
