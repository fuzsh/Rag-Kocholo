        "text": "This site is currently being updated. We currently recommend to use the UltraStar Deluxe mod which includes line bonus, golden notes, a party mode and much more. Although the table below is old and needs some updating, we have decided to keep it so that you have an overview over the features of the different versions.\n\nWith the help of some volunteers from our partner forum we developed an overview over the different features of the newest UltraStar versions. It includes stability, games, experiences, etc. Now you are able to choose the version which is best for you.\n\nThe winner of this test is version 0.5.0 with a grade of B because it already has a variety of features and is rather stable. Unfortunately, it does neither support a file structure nor the use of a mouse.\n\nWe newly included version 0.5 but you have to take into consideration that it was tested by one person only. All other versions were tested by several people and their results were summed up. Therefore the results for version 0.5 are not that reliable like the others. Please keep in mind that with different computers and with more testers the results might have varied for version 0.5 Â– so the following still applies:\n\nTesters wanted! To improve the results for version 0.5.0 we need more data. People interested in testing the new version can download a German questionnaire here, fill it our (you can write in English) and send it back to us. We are sorry that there is no English questionnaire yet.\n\nThanks to our testers and have fun while singing!\n\nThe Spanish mod was not included in the overview because it could not be tested properly due to the \"singing by itself\" bug. The mods can be found in our partner forum.\n\nOn a few computers versions 0.4.0, 0.4.1 and 0.4.2 crashed very often. The problem has not been found yet and we were not able to reproduce it. This is why we did not include it in our list but want to let you know about it here. Please note that NO version worked on the computers which is why we think that it is a problem with the computer or a setting and not a problem with the program itself.\n\nQuestions and Comments"
