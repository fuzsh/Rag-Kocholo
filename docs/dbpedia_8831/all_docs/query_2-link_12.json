        "text": "Post by joze84 on\n\nWell, Ultrastar is a free Singstar game that can be played on a computer.\n\nIt works on windows and linux.\n\nNowadays the game is pretty stable.\n\nUltrastar game can be downloaded from sourceforge.net/projects/ultrastar/\n\nUltrastar DX and CMD from ultrastardx.sourceforge.net/usdx-downloads/usdx/#stable\n\nUltrastar World Party from ultrastar-es.org/descargas.php?id=45\n\nSongs can be found from ultrastar-es.org/canciones.php and www.ultrastar-base.com\n\nDifferences in other versions in that Ultrastar is the basic game, DX is newer version, CMD includes duet and some other game types and world party is made by ultrastar-es and it can load high scores from and to websites.\n\nJust plug in normal microphone or PS or Xbox singstar mics to yout PC and start singing.\n\nFoFiX is rock band type of game to PC.\n\nFoFiX is newer version of Frets on Fire that is Guitar hero for PC and it's finnish open source game.\n\nFoFiX game can be from code.google.com/p/fofix/ and fretsonfire.wikidot.com/fofix/\n\nHomemade songs can be downloaded from www.fretsonfiresongs.com/ and from fretsonfire.wikidot.com/custom-songs\n\ngreat site to download full rock band song packs was www.fofitalia.altervista.org/, but unfortunatly songs can't be downloaded any more.\n\nGuitar hero and rock band songs are mostly rock songs, but as a dance fan, I recommend to try Band hero and lego rock band.\n\nThere is other sites where to download songs and google is a good way to find those.\n\nFoFiX can use PS and Xbox rock band guitars, drums and mics.\n\nAnd then there is Performous, whitch includes all of those music games in one game.\n\nIt's also a finnish game, but it's a little bit different to play.\n\nWith performous you can play ultrastar, FoFiX and Stepmania songs.\n\nYou can download Performous from performous.org/download\n\nPost by ChaoticRage on\n\nYou can get some pretty good Stepmania Sim files here:\n\nzenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/index.php\n\nThey have a really nice selection.\n\nIt's a shame there are not many decent hard DDR pads made/sold anymore like the cobalt flux. Most credible companies like Red Octane and BG-Mania have folded over the years so getting a decent hard pad is difficult. The most common hard pads I see these days are the DDR-Energy or Ion-Master pads and both of these will get torn up and break within months if you play skill levels above Another/Trick/Standard/Difficult routinely.\n\nThese days if you want a good hard pad you pretty much have to either build your own or shell out 900+ US for a commercial level Hard Pad. The materials for building your own will usually run around 200ish US nowadays and take anywhere from 10 to 40 hours to build depending on your tools, hands-on skills, and what level of refinement you want in your pads. For those interested in building their own pad, here is a good thread on it:\n\nzenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/viewthread.php?threadid=3350\n\nI actually built one off of similiar instructions back in 2004 and it's been holding up well, but it requires a lot of maintenance to keep working and when something breaks I have to make the replacement parts myself which can take hours. When probably maintained it does works better than Arcade Pads though!\n\nThe nice thing about building your own is that you can put a connector on the edge of the wires(leading to the arrow contacts) and put the opposite style connector on any controller you want to use. I've put one connector into a PS1 controller for PSX/PS2 DDR games. I also put one on an XBOX360 Controller so that I can play X360 DDR mixes and also use it for Stepmania. I can switch between controllers in seconds! I am also working on a Gamecube controller so I can also use it on Wii mixes, but that is low on my priority list!\n\nFor those willing to spend a lot on commercial pad, Positive Gaming has a pad they call the Impact Arcade Platform:\n\nwww.positivegaming.com/active-gaming-and-machine-dance-products/impact-dance-platform\n\nI've had one of them for a year now and have played on it for about a few hours every week. I have not had any functional problems, though the arrows are about 3 millimeters lower than the rest of the pad surface. Here is a 1/4 inch Stereo Jack adapter ontop one of the arrows from the side;\n\nFor some people this wont make any difference but for those who drag their feet it will cause problems! The arrow sensitivity is extremely high so you don't need to step very hard."
