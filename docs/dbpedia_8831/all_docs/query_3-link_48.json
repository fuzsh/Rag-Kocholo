Available with an impressive 256 MB of DRAM cache on higher capacity models, the WD_BLACK HDD is performance-optimized so you can spend more time gaming and less time loading. Combine a WD_BLACK HDD with a WD_BLACK SSD for a dual-drive configuration that maximizes your gaming experience while letting you keep more of your favorite games. The WD_BLACK HDD gives you fast hard drive speeds, high capacity, and an industry-leading 5-year limited warranty for an inspiring game storage solution.\n\nIncreased Reliability\n\nThe WD_BLACK Gaming Hard Drive is equipped with StableTrac Technology (2TB1 and larger models). This secures the motor shaft inside of the hard drive to increase reliability and help reduce impact due to system-induced vibrations from other components such as additional gaming hardware. Stabilizing the platters inside the WD_BLACK drive results in more accurate tracking in a particular sector during read and write operations, optimizing performance and reliability.\n\nDrive Your Game\n\nThe WD_BLACK HDD is the perfect storage solution for your gaming rig, offering large cache sizes plus large capacities to store your favorite titles and their downloadable content (DLC). Paired with an SSD, the powerful drive delivers exceptional system performance and capacity.\n\nStore More, Play More\n\nWith capacities up to 10TB1, WD_BLACK Gaming Hard Drives let you download the latest AAA titles while also keeping your ever-growing catalog of classics and favorites ready to play. Don't compromise on your game collection. Store more and game more with WD_BLACK.\n\nCommanding Performance\n\nThe WD_BLACK drive delivers high-speed read rates and transfers of your games with impressive cache sizes of up to 256 MB of DRAM on our high-capacity models. Western Digital’s Dynamic Cache Technology improves caching algorithms in real time to allocate and optimize cache between reads and writes. Spend less time loading and more time winning.\n\nBattle-Tested Dual Processor\n\nWhen it comes to processing power, more is better for loading today's larger games. The WD_BLACK Gaming Hard Drive features a dual-core processor that offers twice the processing capability as a single-core processor to maximize drive performance for geting into the game faster.\n\nAn Industry-Leading 5-Year Limited Warranty\n\nCompared to standard hard drives, our WD_BLACK Gaming Hard Drives pass more strenuous and aggressive internal testing over a longer period of time which is why the WD_BLACK drive is backed by an industry-leading 5-year limited warranty.\n\n1 As used for storage capacity, 1GB = 1 billion bytes and 1TB = one trillion bytes.
