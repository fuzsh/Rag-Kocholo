        "text": "The Rules and Regulations applies to this forum. Please give these a read before posting. When Posting a Project in Games in Development While \"Completed Games\" is for completed games, and \"Released Games\" is for games with releases (like demos), this section is all for works in progress. If your project is still in development and can fulfill the requirements below, then you can post here! Once you have a playable release, you can message a staff member to move your thread up to \"Released Games\" or \"Completed Games.\" Threads must be approved by a staff member before they're public. If we do not approve your thread within 48 hours, you will receive a message from us with what is missing from the rules as listed below. If we do not hear from you after that, your thread will be deleted and not make it to public view. If you believe it did meet the requirements, or the requirements do not adequately apply to your projects, please get in touch with a staff member. The following are the requirements for your thread to be approved. Each thread must have a clear project description, and must state what engine and/or kit, if any, is being used. For instance, \"RPG Maker XP,\" \"Godot,\" or \"Pokémon Essentials.\" Each thread must have a plot outline. Include a small write up or summary of your plot and or backstory. Try for a paragraph at least. It doesn't have to include spoilers or in-depth plot details, but try to capture people's interest. This may not always be applicable, as not all projects have a plot. Each thread must have a list of unique features. Include any features in your game that you believe will make it stand out from other projects, preferably in a list instead of a block of text. They don't have to be ground-breaking. Commonly used resources are not unique features, and generic statements like \"new characters\" do not count. Each thread must have at least four screenshots that are unique to your project and tell us something about what your project entails. As such, generic screenshots, such as an unmodified Pokémon Essentials screenshot, do not count towards this threshold. Make sure they're fairly different from one another. We don't want four screenshots of one area of your game or just of your interfaces. Each thread must credit the creators of all assets they did not create themselves. This includes credits for your engine/kit. All individuals in a kit or resource's credits must be included. Be absolutely positive that you're giving the full and correct credit when using public resources, and make sure to list any team members you might have working on the game. We take credits very seriously. Not crediting someone for something they created is considered content theft and is a very serious offense. No thread may use URL shorteners to share images, patch notes, game files or other miscellaneous file, or host any files directly on the Eevee Expo forums. Considering file-sharing websites for this, such as Mediafire or MEGA. You may not use URL shorteners for this. Some important things to note regarding credits... If you aren't sure the proper credits for something you're using, do some searching to find out who made it. If you for some reason can't find out who made it, you shouldn't be using that resource. If you're using Pokémon Essentials, Luka's Elite Battle System, or some other widely used resource: be sure to credit them as well. Just because they're well known doesn't mean you don't have to credit them. If we find that you are using (private) resources without the author's permission and or without credit, there will be repercussions. This is considered content theft, and your project will be taken down. We will then require proof that you have permission, or to talk to the author ourselves. If you notice your content is being used against your wishes or you're not being credited for your work, please contact a staff member. We'll work with you and the offending project to make sure proper credit is given or the project will be removed from the forums. Posting in General The following things should be kept in mind when posting in a project thread: Project feedback is highly encouraged; if you see something in a project that you feel needs improvement, point that out, but be respectful about it. Keep in mind that it's ultimately the developer's project and it's their vision for the project. Not all posts have to be feedback; you can talk about how much you like the game (make sure to say what you like about it), ask questions about it, or talk about it in general! A project developer (usually) loves nothing more than people discussing what's going on in the game. Spam The following types of posts are considered spam and will be deleted. If you notice a post breaking this rule, please report it and move on. Posts asking for a release date. Posts asking for a download link. Posts asking if the game is finished. Posts asking if they can be a game tester, unless stated by the project author that they're looking for testers. Posts with little to no substance: (eg. \"I like your game, it's cool!\") Tell us why you like the game! Double posting. Please edit your post instead of double posting. If you're the thread author, you may double post if you have some new content to share.\n\nThe project is being developed using the Pokémon Essentials v21.1 and RPGXP Join the new Pokémon Inritum community in discord to have first access to news regarding the server! Overview God, omnipotent and omniscient, had reached a state of boredom that would only be overcome if he committed suicide. For him, non-existence is superior to existence. However, since suicide could only happen in time and space (an action only takes place within these conditions), God splits himself creating Dialga and Palkia. With the external conditions ensured for the decomposition process, there is now a missing entity that manifests God's will to cease: Arceus. Arceus represents will-to-die and will exert its influence on the fact that everything is a finite process. However, in the initial fragmentation of God, another entity was created in addition to these 3: Giratina. Giratina appears as a creation because God had a secondary objective to non-existence: to temporarily experience existence in an \"imperfect\" way. In separate wills, each one would be a part of God, forgetting that they are part of God. In these manifestations where Pokémon and human beings meet, Giratina is the force of life (or selfishness) that God created to fuel this temporary existence. Without a will-to-live there would be no motivation to continue living. The fragments of God over time only worried about death (which eventually always comes because the main and primordial purpose is non-existence). Observing closely from the Distortion World, Giratina will oppose the acceleration of cosmic death, as he does not believe that the original God already wanted the total cessation of existence. Plot Description In the land of Hessia, where some rare Pokémon wield unimaginable strength, players are drawn into a gripping narrative that delves into the depths of existential philosophy. As you journey through this richly crafted world, you'll uncover the mysteries of the region's troubled past and confront the dark machinations of a nefarious religious cult. With the guidance of a renowned professor studying the genetic potential of Pokémon, players must navigate a web of deception and betrayal, all while testing their skills in intense Pokémon battles against formidable opponents. Along the way, you'll encounter a cast of intriguing characters, each with their own motivations and agendas, as you unravel the secrets hidden within the Zeta Pokémon. But beware, for the cult's sinister leader, guided by the Philosophy of Redemption, seeks to harness the power of Arceus to bring about the end of existence itself. Will you stand against the tide of darkness? Or will you succumb to the allure of power and darkness, shaping the fate of the region and its inhabitants? Features Full custom OST - Our song tracks were carefully designed to match the maps and feeling we want the players to feel! Generation 9 - Every Pokémon will be available to catch with lots of events to explore!

Screnshots Progress The idea for this project came around march 2024, my close friend Ajax Lasnamae is the main writter and he is reading a lot of resources to create awesome and complex characters, and a plot full of realistic elements that are merged into the wonderful world of Pokémon. I have mostly a developer background, but I'm trying to learn a bit of everything to be able to bring this project to life! Luckily we have found awesome team members, that love this project as much as I do and out team consists now of 2 spriters, one awesome song artist, one mapper, Ajax and me. Unfortunately, since this is a relatively recent project and our own lack of experience with both RPGXP, ruby and mostly art our learning curve is being a lot steeper but we are overcoming the challenges as we go. We are trying our best to come up with a demo that goes up to a certain event until December! In case you want to be part of this project, feel free to message me here or in discord: bloodyneonz You can also apply by filling this form: https://forms.gle/FdDPe5VSjoVF9dri6 Audio & Art This is an appreciation section to show some love to my amazing team! The first one to join the project besides me and Ajax was Gothmonkey, also known as Danger! Ghosts!, and he is very skilled at making songs for the game. You can check here some of the best work he as done so far: Pokémon Inritum Soundtracks Talking About Dreaming - Title BGM Stuot City - Stuot City BGM Rigor of Discovery - Stuot Lab BGM Swallowed By Earth - Important encounter BGM Be sure to check his other songs as they are really good. Also if you like his work and need custom songs for your game he also takes comissions so be sure to send him a message: Gothmonkey's comissions The second person to join was RoBoNox! He is the main spriter for the game and he joined mostly to learn and improve his skills and we can already see major differences from his delivery speed and quality! Art is the area where I lack the most so his help has been of major importance! Recently he finished the main character male sprites, and I just have to leave it here to share his amazing work.

Perhaps its intent for the region was only the first? Behind the scenes, a conglomerate of people, simply known as Team Space have been spotted around the region, planning to take a hold of something primal in nature, something made to never be understood by human hands. So much in the region appears to be changing: new friends, dangers around every corner, and the mystery behind it all. What's exactly at stake here? The region? The world? Perhaps even something beyond that scope that not even you can understand. You as the player are not only going to be experiencing the new wonders of the Zyroh region, but are going to delve deep into the mysteries behind the scenes and what could this dastardly team want with such a being as strong as 'Arceus'. Discover something new in Pokémon Comet! Currently: A whole new, fresh region to explore New \"Fallen\" Pokémon New and reoccurring Mega Pokémon Custom, hand-picked Region Dex containing 500 Pokémon Side quests located in Pokémon Centers and in certain areas New custom abilities To be added later: The Type Safari: A place you can encounter certain types of Pokémon, just like the Friend Safari in X & Y The \"Open Area\": Similar to the Wild Area of SwSh, but on a remote island! Post game content such as: Battle Facilities, DLC, and more Credits: Discord: Download (v0.1.4): Feedback: If you find any issues with the game (once it's released) feel free to let me know, or to simply tell me your thoughts on the game!

Introduction In the Pokemon RPGMaker XP and ROMhacking community, there is a long-standing tradition of modding Pokemon games into Digimon games. Whether it be a modded dex like \"Digimon: Emerald Version\" or a complete overhaul like in \"Digimon: Your Digital Dream\", whenever a new Digimon fangame comes out, nine times out of ten it is a Digimon x Pokemon game. Carrying on that tradition is \"Digimon Story: Fate Gold\", a Digimon-esque re-envisioning of the Johto games and its main region. The game uses a modified version of the story script of Pokemon Gold / Silver, but with most of the official characters swapped out with new ones and a second rival added to keep things interesting! Story Blurb You, the ever-silent and heroic protagonist, are invited to the \"Johto Server\" to test this replica of Johto in the Digital World. Along your adventure you will encounter many Digimon who make their home in this server, a hacker named \"Silver\", your assistant and rival \"Miku\", as well as the malicious and enigmatic tamers of \"Rocket.EXE\". Will you be able to stop them? Will you help save this digital Johto?! Only time will tell. Screenshots Features 700 Digimon to discover, battle and obtain! Unique evolution lines with some familiar faces and some unexpected ones! Player customization with sets of 3 diffferent genders, skin tones and outfit colors!

Demo Progress Mapping 100% Complete Sprites 95% Complete Art Assets 60% Complete Programming 20% Complete The current plan it to have an alpha demo covering the first gym and include Baby to Rookie stages, to test out the early stages of balancing. I'll make some tweaks afterword, then make a second demo, including Champion stages, including Azalea gym. Hopefully that should be enough testing, then off to the first official version.

I've always been into creating stuff when I was small. My main thing was drawing ,a hobby I still have to this day, and one day, I decided to put that talents to use and tried to use that and try to put together this game. I'd say I did more than I thought I would do for this! I just knew that I had to get this out there, so here it is! NOTE: The game is in a Demo phase but has several versions that were done on an older version of the kit used, which is why this Demo is considered to be the 6th version. The STORY You are a 16 year old child that lives on an outer Island called Bikana Island which is famous for their large beach, but there are no Pokémon's on the island itself. You have a friend named Kira who has been your best friend for as long as you have known them. One day, you happened to find out that your mother use to be a Pokémon Trainer. You being a teenager that attends school always imagined what life would be if you were able to have Pokémon, praying you would get the opportunity to do so. Both you and Kira was supposed to get the experience of a Pokemon trainer from a mysterious call that came from a Professor in a Region where Pokemon exist; however, fate decided that your time was now. You learn about the Secret that your mother has been keeping, and as fate would have it, you quickly find yourself having your first battle experience with a Pokémon! An evil Organization sets out to destroy you and your entire family. Will you, with the help of your friend Kira learn the mysteries of Pokemon? ? Or will you succumb to the allure of power and darkness,join the evil ones and bring this world to ruin? FEATURES -Beast Pokemon - Pokemon that are modified by the Team of Evil which feeds off of it's frustrations. -Mega evolution Stages - Mega stages will be in! (Initial, Advanced,True bond). These are unique feature to the game where Pokemons who have Mega evolution will go through stages of them starting from the beginning. When there is a True bond with Pokemon and Trainer, that will be when their power is at their maximum. -New Mega Pokemon - There will be new Mega's made. We plan to cover a good range. - Gym Badges - The Game will feature 9 Gym Badges for both stories making it a Grand total of 18 badges. There will also Be a Pokemon League, where you will face off against the best trainers in the region(s). There will be a cap on your level based on the number of badges you have obtained. -Mystery Quest system - You want to set out on an adventure to places you've never seen before? Well you've come to the right place! Accept quests to go out to places you might have never even heard of before existing on regions you have explored, go through tougher explorations and missions in order to gain Great Rewards. The missions will get harder as you Rank up. (You will start at the Rank of Bronze and after completing enough missions and earning enough points you will Rank up. The Ranks are as follows : Rookie --> Normal--> Advanced---> Star -->Diamond--> Cool-->Ace ---> Intense-->Legendary). You will be able to put these Ranks onto your Trainer . Eg. You can be 'Ace trainer (Your name here)' when you go into both regular and online battle's. -Ev Cap changed- The Ev Cap for this game is 1200. You can put 300 Ev's into one stat as a maximum amount. To be added: Pokemon Contests - Pokemon Contests will be added to the game as a story of its own. It will feature the judgement round, and then the contest battle round which I am planning to have a unique theme to it in comparison to how it is normally done. (I cannot explain more than this here). Online Battles - Online battling will be added to the game sometime in the future. Event Islands: These are islands where you participate in an event and gain event points. Gain enough for some unique prizes!

I hope they are very well. Well I wanted to announce my 1st Pokémon project; Pokémon Eterna Emoción, to test experience and enter the world of creating a Pokémon game. I started developing it in 2020, in Pokémon Emerald together with Abeshoken. The truth is that at first, we started looking for a little information when Pokémon Sword/Shield came out and then we decided to try to do it by creating animation for the Pokémon sprites, etc.; Until one day, I wanted to add something but it didn't work out. So we decided to continue advancing in Pokémon Fire Red to test and improve the experience further to see how it progressed. And I would like to share you 2 news that I have made public so you can see; The 1 detail (if you click on the text) you will see the Ciudad Lonas gym event and the 2 detail (if you click on the text) you will see the official trailer of this project. In October 2021 I decided to try Essentials, why? In my head there was something that I couldn't imagine since I don't know how it was going to turn out, so I made a decision and wanted to try the experience of trying to develop my Pokémon project in RPG MAKER and the truth is, I'm liking it and it's surprising me a lot! , what I'm progressing! Having said that, from here, the good things begin... Synopsis The protagonist turns 18, sees a pink thing through the window of his house and enters the room, it is Mew and warns him of devastation and that when he reaches the required age to go on a trip, he will have to prove his worth before the dangers of the region. He will have to go in search of Mew in order to save the world, without him falling into the wrong hands and for everything to return to normal.

I will try to update this post as I progress so that you can enjoy this project💪🏼. Greetings⚡!\n\nFollow the project on Twitter/X : Twitter/X Join the Discord ! Lethalmon's Discord TikTok account (in french) : TikTok Presentation Lethalmon is a Pokémon fangame that take inspiration from Lethal Company and Pokémon Emerald Rogue with a little sprinkle of the \"Safari Zone\". The project started in march 2024, but i started to ponder about it's base principles after discovering Lethal Company in november 2023. My main goal with this fangame is to make sure that no playthrough is the same. Inspired (as its name suggest) by Rogue-like games, your main goal as a player will be to explore dungeons to capture Pokémon. Limited by a certain number of steps, you will have to show creativity in optimizing your explorations of the dungeons. The further you will go, the rarer and more powerful the Pokémon will become ! Your task is to become as powerful as possible! Explore the dungeons and collect the 8 badges that will grant you access to the Pokémon League. Plot Outline W.I.P. As it is not the most important aspect of Lethalmon, is it still under revision. This part of the thread will get updated as time goes on. Despite this, here is the sprite of the main character while exploring the dungeons! Credits : @Dracoyan2 Screenshots Here's some screenshots of the game. I will add some more in future updates! Features The Hub It's from here that you will start each of your explorations in the dungeons. Most of the features i will present will be available in here, making it essential in your future ventures in the dungeons! Selling your Pokémon The main way to gain money is by selling the Pokémon captured in the dungeons, the rarer the Pokémon, the more money you will get. And if it's shiny? It will multiply its value by five! You will likely face a dilemma, you have a super powerful Pokémon that could be even more powerful, but selling it would grant you a hefty sum of money which could be used to upgrade your other Pokémons... So? What will it be? That's for you to decide! Upgrading your Pokémon In a game where we sell our pokemons, everything has a cost! Changing its nature, upgrading your IVs, redistribute its EVs and others! Make the local economy flourish! Improving your Competence Increasing your number of steps, unique items to Lethalmon to ease your explorations... You will find a ton of objects to improve your character! Huge Replayability The arenas and dungeons will change everytime you start a new exploration and the Pokémon you encounters will depend on the number of badges you have acquired so far. The dungeons will be very varried in terms of themes and fauna, so i hope you're ready for it! Future Features And of course, even more features will be added in the future like a whole new fishing system which will be more fun and where you can improve your rod!

And I hope you look forward to Lethalmon. My friends and I are hard at work to provide you with the best experience possible ! And if you ever join the Discord, feel free to let me know that you're coming from Eevee Expo!\n\nMy first project, (over 3 years off and on in the making...) Pokemon ReDX! made with the Pokémon Essentials GS base Like how Link’s Awakening DX was a Gameboy Color upgraded port, Pokémon ReDX (Red Deluxe) is a Gameboy Color “styled” upgrade to base Pokémon Red. Explore the stories of Pokémon Red with a new coat of paint. Meet new characters, tackle new plot elements, encounter new Pokémon! Become the very best, like no one ever was in Pokémon ReDX. While the basic plot follows Pokémon Red, there’s quite a lot of new events happening. You have a new rival along for the ride. Jade, if you play as a boy, or Jasper, if you play as a girl. Blue is your aggressive cocky rival who focuses on besting you battle while Jade/Jasper will be a more friendly face who is more focused on the Dex. Prof Oak has charged you three to beta test his life’s work, the Pokédex! Help take down the Team Rocket criminal organization. The Admins from HGSS now make appearances in their Kanto games. Looker has come to Kanto to try and uncover Team Rocket’s motives, he will meet up with you on occasion to lend a hand. Take on the Gym Challenge! Kanto's Champion's throne is currently vacant, the league has issued a challenge to all trainers to try and claim the throne for themselves! ReDX features an expanded dex to the original 151 (coming in at around 300 species!). The Kanto region has received some minor upgrades to accommodate the new Pokémon. For example Routes 9 and 10 are now canyons and there’s a path split in Rock Tunnel that leads to a snowy mountaintop. New Mega Evolutions are being discovered too! There are side quests to pick up for extra rewards as you play through the game. Apex Pokémon are here to challenge you! A twist on Totem Pokémon, Apex Pokémon cannot be captured, but will drop loot when defeated. You will not find Apex Pokémon out in the wild, they each have a den they reside in. A Switch Battle style has been changed, now “Switch” style no longer tells you what the incoming Pokémon is. Hidden Grottos will allow you to find rare Pokemon and items. Wonder Trade unlocks during the story and allows you to find even more Pokemon! The Cable Club in Pokemon Centers is now the Trainer's Nook, where various services are provided for trainers. As you earn badges more services are unlocked! No longer do you need the move FLY! In nearly every major location you will find the Pidgeot Express, who will fly you to a place you've been to before (for a fee). The Game is 95% complete as is. What’s left to finish? Grammar I need to go back through and work on re-writing a lot of text (I started this project 2-3 years ago and some of the older stuff is poorly written) there is also a lot of inconsistency on if Pokémon and people are written out as BULBASUR or Bulbasaur. Many instances of Pokemon or Pokedex instead of Pokémon and Pokédex that needs to be fixed. Music Currently most all the music is MP3, I need to get all my music converted to looping tracks, low priority, but something I want to do to help with file size. Balance I need a handful of “beta” testers to run through the game and test how well the difficulty curve is (I know what to expect so “surprises” won’t work on me as well). Quests More quests to be added, existing quests to be polished up some more, that sort of thing. Post Game There’s currently 3 Post Game story beats I have planned that are still in the works. First is the dealing with the remnants of Team Rocket, this one is in 2 parts with Part 1 nearly complete. The Battle Fortress is a mini post game facility that will have the player challenge the Battle King and his minions. The Origin of all Pokémon will have the player explore the secret of Mew. Currently there is a Mew event that unlocks a Mew Battle in the Post Game, but that’s a placeholder until I can fully write the scenario for this event.\n\nEmbark on a Journey of Myth and Mastery in the Pantheus Region!

Will you uncover the secrets of the Honnis Region? Will you beat 8 gyms and the Pokémon League in the process? ...Probably. The Honnis Region The Honnis region is a sprawling and diverse land filled with countless different Pokémon and cities filled with all kinds of interesting people and places. Though it contains countless secrets of its own, its most interesting feature is undoubtedly the Honnis Underground, a vast network of cave systems containing hundreds of Pokémon that cannot be found anywhere else in the region. Pokémon within it are more active than their surface counterparts, and there are some individuals that have demonstrated unusual amounts of strength and aggression. It is said that the Pokémon within have the mysterious property of 'scaling' to the strength of your party! Features Treat Traits Special abilities granted upon consuming specific items, Traits come in a wide variety of effects that can be granted to any Pokémon! Grants varying stat boosts depending on a species' strength, allowing even weaker Pokémon to keep up with their evolved counterparts While a Pokémon possesses a Trait, it loses the ability to evolve via level-up, requiring it to be evolved through the party menu.

New Forms and Evolutions The Honnis region contains an utterly massive amount of Pokémon, and depending on what part of the region you are in, some species will even take on entirely new forms. It appears that some Pokémon even possess entirely new evolutions. Yet what are the mysteries surrounding this mysterious 'Flux Stone'? New Moves and Abilities, and Rebalances Freeze has been changed to Frostbite, as seen in Legends Arceus Certain 'weaker' moves and abilities have had their effects strengthened in some form Many Pokémon have had their learnsets expanded, and certain species that lacked secondary or hidden abilities have now gained them There are also a variety of brand new moves, items, and abilities!
