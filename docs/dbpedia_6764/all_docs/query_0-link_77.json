        "text": "I came across a poem on a forum, attributed to Rudyard Kipling called \"THE WRATH OF THE AWAKENED SAXON\" (the title seems to be often posted in caps).\n\nA Google search indicates that where posted, this is always attributed to Kipling. My skepticism comes from the fact that it's almost exclusively posted (and attributed to Kipling) by... very politically motivated individuals. Searching through several lists that claim to be comprehensive collections of his work, none of them seem to include this poem. Is this poem deliberately omitted due to possibly objectionable content (unlikely due to him being controversial anyway), or was this written by somebody else and attributed to Kipling?\n\nThis website resists my attempts at formatting, so here is the top result for the poem (on startpage anyway), with a website name that makes me doubt its neutrality: europeanamericansunited.org.\n\nAnd here is a copy of the poem:\n\nIt was not part of their blood,\n\nIt came to them very late,\n\nWith long arrears to make good,\n\nWhen the Saxon began to hate.\n\nThey were not easily moved,\n\nThey were icy -- willing to wait.\n\nTill every count should be proved,\n\nEre the Saxon began to hate.\n\nTheir voices were even and low.\n\nTheir eyes were level and straight.\n\nThere was neither sign nor show.\n\nWhen the Saxon began to hate.\n\nIt was not preached to the crowd.\n\nIt was not taught by the state.\n\nNo man spoke it aloud.\n\nWhen the Saxon began to hate.\n\nIt was not suddently bred.\n\nIt will not swiftly abate.\n\nThrough the chilled years ahead,\n\nWhen Time shall count from the date.\n\nThat the Saxon began to hate.\n\nI really don't care about the politics of the posters, but if anybody has actual information on this poem's authorship it would be appreciated. I already heavily doubt that he wrote this poem."
