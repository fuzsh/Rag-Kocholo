        "text": "> Peter Bellamy > Songs > Cells\n\nCells\n\n[words Rudyard Kipling, music Peter Bellamy; notes on Cells at the Kipling Society]\n\nCells is a poem from Rudyard Kiplingâs book Barrack-Room Ballads. Peter Bellamy sang it in 1976 on his third album of songs set to Kiplingâs poems, Peter Bellamy Sings the Barrack-Room Ballads of Rudyard Kipling. This track was included in 2002 on the Free Reed anthology This Label Is Not Removable. Bellamy noted on the original album:\n\nThat Monday Morning Feeling is vividly described by an inhabitant of the guard-house whose remorse is tempered by the triumph of his treatment of the arresting officers. C.B.: Confined to barracks. Pack-drill: a rigorous but standard punishment. Button-stick: a device on which metal buttons were supported during polishing. The traditional song Boston City lent something of itself to the melody.\n\nPeter Bellamy and Cockerdaleâs Keith Marsden sang Cells in 1990 on his privately issued cassette Soldiers Three.\n\nTundra sang Cells in 1980 on their Greenwich Village album The Kentish Songster. They noted:\n\nThanks to Martin Winsor for the tune and to Paddy Harris from whom we first head this crackling song. Itâs from Rudyard Kiplingâs Barrack-Room Ballads and is the sorry tale of a poor squaddie led astray by the evils of drink. Every performance of the song evokes those halcyon days when we did a Saturday night pub residency in darkest Chatham.\n\nDave Webber sang Cells on the 1995 album of Barrack Room Ballads and other soldierâs poems of Rudyard Kipling as set to traditional tunes by Peter Bellamy, The Widowâs Uniform. He noted:\n\nIt has been said (not always as a compliment) that Kipling would have made a superb composer of music-hall songs. Perhaps, on this evidence, he was and no-one realised it at the time. A lighter side of Army discipline in poignant contrast to Danny Deever.\n\nJon Boden sang Cells as the 8 December 2010 entry of his project A Folk Song a Day.\n\nLyrics\n\nCells\n\nIâve a head like a concertina: Iâve a tongue like a button-stick:\n\nIâve a mouth like an old potato, and Iâm more than a little sick,\n\nBut Iâve had my fun oâ the Corpâralâs Guard: Iâve made the cinders fly,\n\nAnd Iâm here in the Clink for a thundering drink and blacking the Corporalâs eye.\n\nChorus (repeated after each verse):\n\nWith a second-hand overcoat under my head,\n\nAnd a beautiful view of the yard,\n\nO itâs pack-drill for me and a fortnightâs C.B.\n\nFor “drunk and resisting the Guard!”\n\nI started oâ canteen porter, I finished oâ canteen beer,\n\nBut a dose oâ gin that a mate slipped in, it was that that brought me here.\n\nâTwas that and an extry double Guard that rubbed my nose in the dirt;\n\nBut I fell away with the Corpâralâs stock and the best of the Corpâralâs shirt.\n\nI left my cap in a public-house, my boots in the public road,\n\nAnd Lord knows where, and I donât care, my belt and my tunic goed;\n\nTheyâll stop my pay, theyâll cut away the stripes I used to wear,\n\nBut I left my mark on the Corpâralâs face, and I think heâll keep it there!\n\nMy wife she cries on the barrack-gate, my kid in the barrack-yard,\n\nIt ainât that I mind the Ordâly room—itâs that that cuts so hard.\n\nIâll take my oath before them both that I will sure abstain,\n\nBut as soon as Iâm in with a mate and gin, I know Iâll do it again!"
