        "text": "BOSTON -- Last year, Mac Jones was coming off a very successful rookie season that ended in rather brutal fashion.\n\nThis year, Jones is coming off a rather poor second season, one filled with frustration, injury, and on-field struggles.\n\nThe two years couldn't have been any different, but Jones' mindset and motivation as he approaches the offseason remains the same.\n\nThe quarterback took to Instagram to make a rare post on Wednesday, sharing six photos from the 2022 season and writing a brief one-word caption: \"If--\"\n\nPrior to posting about his My Cause My Cleats partner last week, Jones hadn't posted on Instagram since September. His social media emergence brought about comments of support from teammates like Kendrick Bourne, Trent Brown, Christian Barmore, DeVante Parker, Tyquan Thornton, Damien Harris, Deatrich Wise, Kevin Harris, and the Patriots' official account.\n\nThe caption is a reference to the poem \"If--\" by Rudyard Kipling. It's a poem that Jones referenced last August, along with \"The Man In The Arena\" speech delivered by Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n\"I do love the two poems a lot, so that's a big shout out to my dad because he kind of gave me those when I was probably like 6 years old,\" Jones said last summer. \"He kind of explained everything to me. And as I grew, I continue to just enjoy that. Actually, the 'If--' poem is in Wimbledon. So that's where he learned about it, in the locker room in Wimbledon. So that's pretty cool.\"\n\nHere's the full text of the poem, from the Poetry Foundation :\n\nIf you can keep your head when all about you\n\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you,\n\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n\nBut make allowance for their doubting too;\n\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n\nOr being lied about, don't deal in lies,\n\nOr being hated, don't give way to hating,\n\nAnd yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:\n\nIf you can dream-and not make dreams your master;\n\nIf you can think-and not make thoughts your aim;\n\nIf you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\n\nAnd treat those two impostors just the same;\n\nIf you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken\n\nTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\n\nOr watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\n\nAnd stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:\n\nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings\n\nAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\n\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings\n\nAnd never breathe a word about your loss;\n\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\n\nTo serve your turn long after they are gone,\n\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you\n\nExcept the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'\n\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\n\nOr walk with Kings-nor lose the common touch,\n\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\n\nIf all men count with you, but none too much;\n\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\n\nWith sixty seconds' worth of distance run,\n\nYours is the Earth and everything that's in it,\n\nAnd-which is more-you'll be a Man, my son!\n\nThe portion of the poem that can be found in Wimbledon involves the meeting of triumph and disaster and treating \"those two impostors just the same.\"\n\nClearly, Jones connects with the message in the poem, and it figures to be an aid for him in keeping his focus this offseason, as he tries to work toward a bounce-back season in New England -- a year that could be a bit of a make-or-break season in terms of the long-term outlook and scope of his NFL career."
