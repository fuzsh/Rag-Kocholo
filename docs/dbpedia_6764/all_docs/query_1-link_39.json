It is presently showing added text,changed text,deleted text,[start]/[end] markers,and Issue Numbers.\n\nHide All Edits | Toggle Deletions | Toggle Issue Numbers | Toggle [start]/[end] Markers | Show All Edits\n\nChanges are displayed as follows:\n\n[begin add] new, added text [end add]\n\n[begin change] changed text [end change],\n\n[begin delete] deleted text [end delete]\n\nThe objective of this technique is to associate a description (such as a prompt or question) with a related group of radio buttons or checkboxes using the fieldset and legend elements. Generally, a set of radio buttons or checkboxes is related when they share the same value for the name attribute. Using fieldset and legend to associate a description with a group of form controls creates a programmatic association between the description and the group of form controls. This makes it possible for people using screen readers to hear the description as well as the available responses.\n\nWhen a small group of related radio buttons includes clear instructions and distinct selections it may not be necessary to use fieldsets and legends; H44: Using label elements to associate text labels with form controls, may also be sufficient."
