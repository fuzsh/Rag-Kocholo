        "text": "Synopsis\n\nLiving in the many worlds of India may never have given Kipling a sense of belonging, but it gave him the experiences to help him on the journey there.\n\nIt isn’t unusual for works of fiction to finish off with a scene or sequel with the characters shown in later life. JK Rowling did it in the last chapter of the last Harry Potter book, showing the characters grown up and with kids of their own. Sometimes, fans write their own what-happened-afterwards endings.\n\nIt is one of the oddities of Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Book stories, first published 120 years back, in 1894, that they started with the sequel. This is a little known story called In The Rukh first published in 1893 in Kipling’s short story collection Many Inventions. It concerns Gisborne a British officer in the Indian Forestry Service who encounters a strange young man in the jungle “naked except for the loin-cloth, but crowned with a wreath of the tasselled blossoms of the white convolvulus creeper”.\n\nThis is Mowgli who seems to have an uncanny knowledge of the jungle. He helps Gisborne kill a man-eating tiger and demonstrates his power over animals by herding nilgai past his bungalow.\n\nGisborne’s boss, a German named Muller — probably based on Dietrich Brandis, the Prussian botanist who, improbably, founded the Indian Forestry Service — solves the mystery by recognising Mowgli as a child raised by wolves: “Sometimes you hear of dem in der census reports, but dey all die. Dis man haf lived, and he is an anachronism, for he is before der Iron Age, and der Stone Age.”\n\nAn anachronism can be useful, Muller realises, since Mowgli’s skills will make an outstanding forest ranger. Mowgli accepts the offer of regular pay and pension for a simple reason — he has fallen for the daughter of Gisborne’s Muslim cook. Over her father’s furious objections, Mowgli marries her, nominally converting to Islam, and settles down to a ranger’s life in a jungle hut, along with his wolf brothers — they were the ones who herded the nilgai — who by the end of the story are baby-sitting his infant son. It is a rather banal ending, though Kipling’s writing does give the story some charm.\n\nBut it isn’t hard to see why the character of Mowgli didn’t leave Kipling, despite his future being so neatly settled. The idea of a child raised by animals has always been compelling. Such stories have been told across the world, in many times, like the Roman story of Romulus and Remus. Charles Allen, in his book Kipling Sahib: India and the Making of Rudyard Kipling, points to one likely inspiration for Kipling — Nada the Lily, a book by Rider Haggard (author of King Solomon’s Mines) which was published a year before, in 1892 and features a Zulu child raised by wild dogs.\n\nThe Mumbai Link\n\nThere was also a more direct source. At Kipling’s urging, his father John Lockwood Kipling, who had been principal of the JJ School of Art in Bombay, had written and illustrated Beast and Man in India, a book about the relations Indians had with their animals. The Times of India (ToI), on January 4, 1892, called it “interesting and amusing, quaint and epigrammatic” and noted with pride the Kipling link with Mumbai. His father’s accounts of Indian animals must have inspired Kipling to develop them as the Jungle Book stories.\n\nApart from the Mowgli ones, these include the mongoose tale of ‘Rikki-Tikki-Tav i ’ , ‘Toomai of the Elephants’ and several others.\n\nBut it was Mowgli that Kipling couldn’t stop thinking about, and as he wondered about the origins of the young man of his story “the pen took charge, and as I watched it began to write stories about Mowgli and the animals, which later grew into the Jungle Books,” he recalled. He was far from India at that time, in the Vermont town of Brattleboro where his wife came from, but his father was visiting and this seems to have stimulated him to write about India again. His other outstanding work about India, Kim, was also started during the few years he spent in the US. The Jungle Book (and The Second Jungle Book the next year) was an immediate hit.\n\nToI’s reviewer, in June 1894, seems to have been a bit unsure what to make of the talking animals, but wrote that “even when the author takes liberties with nature, criticism is tongue-tied by the magic of his art”. Just a year after its publication, ToI reported, a special edition with raised letters was published for the blind, and versions in other European languages came out swiftly. In 1899, ToI noted that the German emperor had given the book to his sons the previous Christmas (which wouldn’t have cut much ice with Kipling, who, despite the sympathetic character of Muller, disliked the Germans and their ambitious Kaiser).\n\nAn Introduction to India\n\nKipling’s reputation would slip in time. He received the Nobel Prize in 1907, but just two years later, in a piece entitled ‘Rudyard Kipling, Imperialist’, ToI, hardly a very nationalist paper, wrote: “Fashions change… so that Rudyard Kipling is not quite the prominent figure in English literature that he once was.” Yet the popularity of the Jungle Books never faltered. Because they were seen as children’s books and also because the young Mowgli stories didn’t have British characters in them, they didn’t suffer from anti-imperial sentiments. Keeping In the Rukh out of the collections had been a good idea.\n\nFor many people across the world, the Jungle Book stories, in all their translations, were their first introduction to India. “An impressive case can be made for Kipling as a writer who invented the idea of India as a land of childhood, a place of innocence and wonder,” writes Sam Miller in A Strange Kind of Paradise, his wonderful account of India seen through foreign eyes. And he gives the experience of his own family, where the first film that entranced his young son was a video of The Jungle Book, Disney’s animated film from 1967 — just as the first film his mother saw and loved was the 1942 live action Jungle Book, featuring a young Indian actor called Sabu, who was first discovered to play the lead role in a Hollywood film based on ‘Toomai of the Elephants’.\n\nHollywood, in fact, has been hugely important in the life of the Jungle Book stories, which is perhaps appropriate given their American genesis. Kipling’s strong storytelling skills transferred well to the screen — Captains Courageous (1937), which won a Best Actor Oscar for Spencer Tracy, Gunga Din (1939) and The Man Who Would be King (1975) were all popular films based on his works. But nothing has been as successful as all the versions of the Jungle Book.\n\nFrom Jungle to Graveyard\n\nApart from the 1942 and 1967 versions, there has been a second live action film produced by Disney in 1994 and less well regarded versions in 1997 and 1996 and a second animated version in 2003. Disney does not seem able to leave the subject, and a new live action CGI version is being made for release in 2015, when Kipling’s 150th anniversary falls (on December 30). And yet another version is being planned by Warner Brothers for 2016.\n\nBeyond Hollywood, there are more versions still. In the 1980s, Japan made a 52-episode anime version called Janguru Bukku Shonen Mowgli that ran on TV stations across the world, including Doordarshan. In the 1960s, the USSR made its own animated version, Maugli, which featured a distinctly more adult looking Mowgli. Both Marvel and DC have done Jungle Book inspired comics, the latter a startling Superman crossover where the Man of Steel is raised by wolves.\n\nBut the one masterpiece that has come from Kipling’s masterpiece is Neil Gaiman’s The Graveyard Book (2009). It relocates the story from a jungle to a graveyard where ghosts rather than animals bring up an abandoned boy, Nobody Owens. It is not an exact recreation, though some themes are repeated — for example, the monkeys who kidnap Mowgli become ghouls. Yet Gaiman has explicitly acknowledged his source, saying how he admired “Kipling’s refusal to sugarcoat, because you’re in a world where things die to feed other things. You’re in the jungle. It’s about the cycle of life.”\n\nThe strongest connection between the two books is the idea of a child who lives in two worlds and struggles to find where he belongs. And this came most directly from Kipling’s life in India, where he never knew where he really belonged — in the native world of India, which he knew as a child and loved, or the British world of the Raj, where he returned to work in as a young man and which he admired, yet never really fitted in with either, which is why he left India and never came back.\n\nIn his work, Kipling tried to give the solutions he could not find for himself. Kim becomes a spy, using his knowledge of the native world for the benefit of the British world. Mowgli becomes a ranger, using his knowledge of the native jungle to manage the forests that the British created. Kipling argued that this ordered British world of India was the best one, but perhaps he knew it was best not to stick around to see the contradictions, and after Kim came out in 1901, he essentially stopped writing on India.\n\nGaiman wisely ends with Nobody Owens leaving the graveyard to discover whatever lies in the world beyond and where he might fit in it, equipped with whatever he learned in his life between worlds. That is where Kipling also leaves Mowgli in the main Jungle Book stories and for all the interest of reading In the Rukh it is the best ending. Living in the many worlds of India may never have given Kipling his clear place of belonging, but as with so many other people, it equipped him with the experiences to help him on the journey there, and to convey through the Jungle Books why that journey mattered.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n15 Atmanirbhar stocks to include in your portfolio this Independence Day\n\nFive reasons why India’s Economic Survey mentioned Apple five times\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nYour EV is 40% Chinese, and will remain so if this jigsaw is not solved\n\nWhy success of Blackstone’s repeat IT bet depends on these ifs and buts\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
