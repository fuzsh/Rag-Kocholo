        "text": "Labels must be programmatically connected to their input\n\nThis means a label's for=\"\" attribute must match the related input's ID value exactly.\n\n<label for=\"name\"> Name (4 to 8 characters): </label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" required size=\"10\">\n\nNote: even if the input ID was spelled uppercase (\"Name\"), the label won't be appropriately tied since the label is looking for an input with an ID of \"name\" in lowercase.\n\nLabels need to be clear and concise\n\nIf labels are tied appropriately to their corresponding input, the label will be announced to screen readers again as they enter the input. A visitor that uses speech recognition may also need to speak the entire label in order to choose the intended input.\n\nThe label should have just enough information for users to understand how to fill out the field.\n\nLabels should be close to the input\n\nSome users may have to use zoom controls or increase their browser font size to use web content. If the screen doesn't reflow properly and a user zooms in, the label may disappear from the screen, leaving the user to wonder what goes in the field.\n\nIf the label is near the input, the instructions will still be clear.\n\nInputs that need <label>\n\nText entry (input type=\"text\", textarea, input type=\"date\", etc.)\n\nRadio buttons (input type=\"radio\")\n\nCheckboxes (input type=\"checkbox\")\n\nSelects (select)\n\nControls that don't need <label>:\n\nButtons or links—these controls are self-naming through their tag value\n\ninput type=\"submit\"—the value attribute provides the accessible name (i.e. input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\")\n\nHidden inputs (input type=\"hidden\")\n\nNote: the following fields are not submittable.\n\n<label for=\"example-input\" class=\"example-label\">Name (required)</label>\n\n<input id=\"example-input\" type=\"text\" />\n\nName (required)\n\n<input checked=\"checked\" id=\"shakesp\" name=\"hamlet\" type=\"radio\" value=\"a\" /> <label for=\"shakesp\">William Shakespeare</label> <input id=\"kipling\" name=\"hamlet\" type=\"radio\" value=\"a\" /> <label for=\"kipling\">Rudyard Kipling</label>\n\nThe play \"Hamlet\" was written by: William Shakespeare Rudyard Kipling\n\nGuidance on placeholders\n\nYou may see examples of form inputs that have placeholder text, like in the example below:\n\nHaving only placeholders as the input's name creates a number of accessibility issues:\n\nThey typically don't meet color contrast requirements.\n\nThey disappear once you type in the input, which is problematic for users with memory-related disabilities.\n\nAssistive technologies don't treat placeholders as true HTML labels.\n\nA more accessible approach is to keep the label visible for all users. If form inputs are simple, a label element should be enough to explain the purpose of the field without needing a placeholder. If needed, helper text can be associated through code so it is announced when entering a field:\n\nFull Name First and last"
