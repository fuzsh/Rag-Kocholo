        "text": "This weekend I was going through some notes and came across one of my favorite poems \"If\" by Rudyard Kipling. Written in 1895, I absolutely love this one as it speaks to the deepest truths of being a man and I wanted to share it with you today. It can be a little wordy as it was written 127 years ago, but the meaning behind the words have never been more true.\n\nIF\n\nIf you can keep your head when all about you,\n\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you,\n\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n\nBut make allowance for their doubting too.\n\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n\nOr being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\n\nOr being hated, don’t give way to hating,\n\nAnd yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise.\n\nIf you can dream—and not make dreams your master,\n\nIf you can think—and not make thoughts your aim,\n\nIf you can meet with Triumph and Disaster,\n\nAnd treat those two impostors just the same.\n\nIf you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken,\n\nTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\n\nOr watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\n\nAnd stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools.\n\nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings,\n\nAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\n\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings,\n\nAnd never breathe a word about your loss.\n\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew,\n\nTo serve your turn long after they are gone,\n\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you,\n\nExcept the will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’\n\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\n\nOr walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,\n\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\n\nIf all men count with you, but none too much.\n\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute,\n\nWith sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,\n\nYours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,\n\nAnd—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!\n\nEvery time I read this, I feel inspired. Inspired to be a better leader, to have more discipline, and too ultimately be a better man. Kipling's words cut through the modern day noise and speak to the soul of being a man and I feel like we could spend an hour unpacking the wisdom in his words, but for the sake of time, I’ll just share my favorite themes.\n\nIn the first section, I love how he talks about keeping your head, when everyone around you is losing there’s, and trusting yourself when everyone doubts you, and making allowance for their doubting to.\n\nThere is so much power here, Kipling is talking bout being a strong, grounded dude who has faith in himself and has the grace and compassion to support those who have a difference in opinion. As men, we must be the calm in the storm, and have faith in ourselves regardless what others think or say.\n\nHe also talks a lot about being humble, staying focused and never allowing outside circumstances hold us back, or keep us down. I love the part about dreams. “If you can dream, but not make dreams your master,” is such a powerful thought followed up by the idea that triumph and disaster are both imposters and we must treat them just the same.\n\nAfter all, what is triumph, and disaster? It’s nothing more than how we choose to view each situation. Success and failure are both 100% subjective and therefore, we must treat them the same.\n\nMy favorite part is when he talks about loosing it all, and building it back with worn out tools, and then never breathing a word about the loss.\n\nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings,\n\nAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\n\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings,\n\nAnd never breathe a word about your loss.\n\nAnd this part, definitely this part:\n\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you,\n\nExcept the will which says to them: ‘Hold on!'"
