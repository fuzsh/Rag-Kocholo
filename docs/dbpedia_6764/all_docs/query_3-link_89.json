        "text": "Rudyard Kipling’s poem ‘If—’ has been highly popular and achieved cultural-artefact status in Britain. It was written around 1895 and addressed to his son, advising him on how to become a man of character and integrity. Ever since its publication in 1910, ‘If—’ has inspired many parodies or imitations. Several of these have transformed the paternal advice into poems speaking to daughters about womanhood. Some of these adaptations have more helpful messages than others.\n\nBelow I have shared the original poem and three versions addressed to girls. The first is by J P McEvoy, an American writer, who published his ‘“If” for Girls’ in 1924. The second is Elizabeth Lincoln Otis’ poem ‘An “If” for Girls’ from 1931. Finally is Irish poet Alice Kinsella’s poem ‘When’, which she wrote for International Women’s Day in 2017, and which was then performed by a group of 16 different female poets. Whilst Rudyard Kipling’s ‘If—’ is addressed to his son, the advice can perhaps equally apply to girls. Each of these writers has a different interpretation of advice for daughters, and it is interesting to note the differences.\n\n‘If—’ by Rudyard Kipling (1895)\n\nIn writing ‘If—’ Rudyard Kipling was inspired by Scottish colonial politician Leander James Starr, who was made the scapegoat of the failed Jameson Raid that brought about the Boer War a few years later from 1899-1902. The poem is an example of Victorian-era stoicism, self-discipline, and the British cultural virtue of a stiff upper lip. It celebrates heroism, dignity, stoicism, fortitude, self-discipline, resolution, integrity, inner strength, and courage in the face of disaster.\n\n‘If you can keep your head when all about you\n\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you,\n\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n\nBut make allowance for their doubting too;\n\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n\nOr being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\n\nOr being hated, don’t give way to hating,\n\nAnd yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:\n\nIf you can dream—and not make dreams your master;\n\nIf you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;\n\nIf you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\n\nAnd treat those two impostors just the same;\n\nIf you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken\n\nTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\n\nOr watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\n\nAnd stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:\n\nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings\n\nAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\n\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings\n\nAnd never breathe a word about your loss;\n\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\n\nTo serve your turn long after they are gone,\n\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you\n\nExcept the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’\n\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\n\nOr walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,\n\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\n\nIf all men count with you, but none too much;\n\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\n\nWith sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,\n\nYours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,\n\nAnd—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!’\n\n‘If—’ by Rudyard Kipling (1895)\n\n‘”If” for Girls’ by J P McEvoy (1924)\n\nJ P McEvoy’s ‘”If” for Girls’ seems to me to be the most similar in tone to Rudyard Kipling’s original poem, however the adaptation has messages of its own. ‘”If” for Girls’ has a more domestic and relational approach. It encourages hopefulness in all circumstances, humility, gentleness, moderation, appropriate boundaries, and a strong faith that empowers girls to assert themselves and stand up for what they believe to be right. Notably, it has a more overtly Christian perspective that points girls to seek God in all circumstances of life.\n\n‘If you can hear the whispering about you,\n\nAnd never yield to deal in whispers, too;\n\nIf you can bravely smile when loved ones doubt you,\n\nAnd never doubt, in turn, what loved ones do;\n\nIf you can keep a sweet and gentle spirit\n\nIn spite of fame or fortune, rank or place,\n\nAnd though you win your goal or only near it,\n\nCan win with poise and lose with equal grace;\n\nIf you can meet with Unbelief, believing,\n\nAnd hallow in your heart a simple Creed,\n\nIf you can meet Deception, undeceiving,\n\nAnd learn to look to God for all you need;\n\nIf you can be what girls should be to mothers:\n\nChums in joy and comrades in distress,\n\nAnd be unto others as you’d have the others\n\nBe unto you – No more, and yet no less;\n\nIf you can keep within your heart the power\n\nTo say that firm, unconquerable “No”;\n\nIf you can brave a present shadowed hour,\n\nRather than yield to build a future woe;\n\nIf you can love, yet not let loving master,\n\nBut keep yourself within your own self’s clasp,\n\nAnd not let dreaming lead you to disaster,\n\nNor pity’s fascination loose your grasp;\n\nIf you can lock your heart on confidences,\n\nNor ever needlessly in turn confide;\n\nIf you can put behind you all pretenses\n\nOf mock humility or foolish pride:\n\nIf you can keep the simple, homely virtue\n\nOf walking right with God – then have no fear\n\nThat anything in all the world can hurt you-\n\nAnd – which is more – you’ll be a Woman, dear.’\n\n‘”If” for Girls’ by J P McEvoy (1924)\n\n‘An “If” for Girls’ by Elizabeth Lincoln Otis (1931)\n\nLittle is known about Elizabeth Lincoln Otis. Her poem ‘An “If” for Girls’ contains some good advice, yet it also comes across as rather patronising and sexist by today’s standards. The poem is focused on external accomplishments over inner character, promoting high requirements for some ideal of perfection. The skills it recommends are good things to learn and some of them were likely considered progressive in her own time. However, the poem’s focus remains limited to becoming a pleasing wife and good mother, prepared to accommodate the wishes of men. For example, the poem’s ideal woman should be able to dance but must not have ‘a craze for dancing’, because to have her own passionate hobbies or interests would be an inconvenience to the men in her life. Being a good wife, mother, and homemaker are admirable goals, but girls should be encouraged to explore their own interests rather than try to fit into some mould.\n\n‘If you can dress to make yourself attractive,\n\nYet not make puffs and curls your chief delight;\n\nIf you can swim and row, be strong and active,\n\nBut of the gentler graces lose not sight;\n\nIf you can dance without a craze for dancing,\n\nPlay without giving play too strong a hold,\n\nEnjoy the love of friends without romancing,\n\nCare for the weak, the friendless and the old;\n\nIf you can master French and Greek and Latin,\n\nAnd not acquire, as well, a priggish mien,\n\nIf you can feel the touch of silk and satin\n\nWithout despising calico and jean;\n\nIf you can ply a saw and use a hammer,\n\nCan do a man’s work when the need occurs,\n\nCan sing when asked, without excuse or stammer,\n\nCan rise above unfriendly snubs and slurs;\n\nIf you can make good bread as well as fudges,\n\nCan sew with skill and have an eye for dust,\n\nIf you can be a friend and hold no grudges,\n\nA girl whom all will love because they must;\n\nIf sometime you should meet and love another\n\nAnd make a home with faith and peace enshrined,\n\nAnd you its soul—a loyal wife and mother—\n\nYou’ll work out pretty nearly to my mind\n\nThe plan that’s been developed through the ages,\n\nAnd win the best that life can have in store,\n\nYou’ll be, my girl, the model for the sages—\n\nA woman whom the world will bow before.’\n\n‘An “If” for Girls’ by Elizabeth Lincoln Otis (1931)\n\n‘When’ by Alice Kinsella (2017)\n\nAlice Kinsella’s poem ‘When’ immediately strikes a more confident, assured tone just from the title. It is no longer a case of ‘If’ but ‘When’. Her feminist poem feels the injustices of life and recognises that daughters will be hurt, yet promotes an inner strength and fire of a fighting spirit that will never give up on what is right regardless. In her poem, women know their vulnerability as well as their power, and are supportive as a sisterhood to every other woman. Becoming a worthy woman is a process that comes more from experiencing life as a woman and refusing to give up, rather than from the specific accomplishments of other poems. Being a woman is a lived experience rather than ‘some myth of virtue’. The world unfortunately will try to break women down, but they must learn to get up again and still laugh at the days to come.\n\n‘When you can say the words that are not listened to\n\nBut keep on saying them because you know they’re true;\n\nWhen you can trust each other when all men doubt you\n\nAnd from support of other women make old words new;\n\nWhen you can wait, and know you’ll keep on waiting\n\nThat you’ll be lied to, but not sink to telling lies;\n\nWhen you know you may hate, but not be consumed by hating\n\nAnd know that beauty doesn’t contradict the wise;\n\nWhen you can dream – and know you have no master;\n\nWhen you can think – let those thoughts drive your aim;\n\nWhen you receive desire and abuse from some Bastard\n\nAnd treat both manipulations just the same;\n\nWhen you hear every trembling word you’ve spoken\n\nRetold as lies, from a dishonest heart;\n\nWhen you have had your life, your body, broken\n\nBut stop, breathe, and rebuild yourself right from the start;\n\nWhen you can move on but not forget your beginnings\n\nAnd do what’s right no matter what the cost;\n\nLose all you’ve worked for, forget the aim of winning\n\nAnd learn to find the victory in your loss;\n\nWhen you can see every woman struggle – to\n\ncreate a legacy, for after they are gone\n\nAnd work with them, when nothing else connects you\n\nExcept the fight in you which says: ‘Hold on!’\n\nWhen you can feel the weight of life within you\n\nBut know that you alone are just enough;\n\nWhen you know not to judge on some myth of virtue\n\nTo be discerning, but not too tough;\n\nWhen you know that you have to fight for every daughter\n\nEven though you are all equal to any son;\n\nWhen you know this, but still fill your days with laughter\n\nYou’ll have the earth, because you are a woman!’\n\n‘When’ by Alice Kinsella (2017)"
