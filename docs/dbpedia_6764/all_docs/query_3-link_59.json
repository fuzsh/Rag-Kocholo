While we are often caught up in what we perceive as modern day problems, we tend to forget that men have dealt with the same obstacles all along and great wisdom can be found in classic literature. One such example is  If  by the great late Victorian era poet Rudyard",

        "text": "If is really an incredible poem, so full of timeless wisdom on the characteristics that make a man a man. It captures the idea that the passage into manhood isn’t a singular event but is ongoing and over years. Kipling wrote the poem in the late 19th century (1895) but it wasn’t published until 1910 as paternal advice to Kipling’s son John. Kipling found inspiration in the military actions of Leander Starr Jameson, who led the failed Jameson Raid against the Transvaal Republic in an effort to overthrow the Boer Government in South Africa. These late British Empire actions eventually led to the Second Boer War. What makes the poem even more poignant is that Kipling’s son John was tragically killed at the Battle of Loos while serving with the British Army during the first World War. He was only eighteen years old.\n\nHere are some of my favorite passages and with my interpretation of the timeless wisdom:\n\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too\n\nYou have to have absolute faith in yourself, but with that faith in yourself must also come humility. When I read this passage I think of the idea of “quiet confidence”, someone who carries themselves in a confident but humble way. The second part of the stanza touches on how there will always be times in your life when not everyone believes in your mission or what you are trying to accomplish. You should never take offense or challenge the doubters. Move forward, work hard and prove them wrong.\n\nIf you can dream—and not make dreams your master; If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;\n\nThis is my favorite passage in the entire poem, defining the idea of the man of action. It’s ok to be a dreamer, but those dreams and aspirations have to be accompanied by action taken on a daily basis. It drives home a similar point to the Man in the Arena speech by Theodore Roosevelt, i.e. the man of action versus the timid souls who neither know victory or defeat. The similarity between the speech of Roosevelt and the poems and prose of Kipling is very much indicative of era they lived in, a time much less cynical when it comes to concepts like manhood and the passage into manhood.\n\nThe second part of the passage, if you can think— and not make thoughts your aim further drives home the idea of taking action in your life. My interpretation of the passage is a subtle dig at the critics or even the philosophers and thinkers of the time. You must put great thought into how you carry yourself and your actions, but don’t let those thoughts dominate you and get into the way of taking action. Be both an intellectual but also a doer.\n\nIf you can meet with Triumph and Disaster, And treat those two impostors just the same;\n\nThis is all about not letting success or failure define you. A man of action will often face both in his lifetime and it’s critical to recognize that both are fleeting. Just like you must move on from a great disaster, you also need to move on from a great triumph, because the next challenge and obstacle is always right around the corner.\n\nIf you can make a heap of all your winnings, And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings, And never breathe a word about your loss;\n\nYou have take risks in your life but if things don’t work don’t wallow in your misery and complain. Get right back up and start again, whether it’s a business venture or a relationship there are going to be times when things don’t go your way and you don’t succeed. When this happens you need to get up, dust yourself off, and keep moving forward. Finally, no one likes a complainer, even if you were wronged in some way— “woe is me” is never a good look. The latter part of the passage makes me think of our current victim culture where weakness and fragility are accepted and in many cases celebrated.\n\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch\n\nBe true to yourself and what you stand for. This passage is best understood in the context of the era that Kipling wrote it. Kipling was very much a product of the upper class, but also a writer that effectively captured and connected with the middle and lower classes of British Society. The timeless wisdom in the passage is to have a core set of beliefs that you stand for that govern how you carry yourself that doesn’t change due to the company your are with."
