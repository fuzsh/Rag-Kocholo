        "text": "The rolling hills, lush-velvet green and shrouded in mist, provided inspiration for a young author who came to America to marry his best friend’s sister and build his dream home in Dummerston, Vt. By the time the rambling three-story home featuring custom woodwork and indoor plumbing was completed in 1893, 27-year-old Rudyard Kipling was already so famous that he had to board up his first-floor windows to keep the curious from peeking inside.\n\nIt was in his cozy, bookshelf-lined study that Kipling, who was born in British India, wrote his classic children’s tale, “The Jungle Book.” He wrote in many genres – poetry, novels, children’s books and short stories, and was often referred to as the “soldiers’ poet” for the verses he wrote during wartime.\n\nDuring a recent visit to New England, I was fortunate enough to get a tour of Kipling’s Vermont home, called Naulakha, which has been preserved by the Landmark Trust USA there. A Trust representative, Jeremy Ebersole, was kind enough to show me the house, which is not open for tours but instead is a short-term rental and is available for small events and retreats. It is a beautiful home in gorgeous surroundings.\n\nInterestingly, while researching the home, I learned Kipling has a connection to Alabama. Another famous author, the late Winston Groom of “Forrest Gump” fame, once speculated that a line in Kipling’s poem “Tommy” was responsible for an early nickname for the University of Alabama football team. Before it was called the Crimson Tide, the team was often referred to by sports writers as “The Thin Red Line,” as Groom wrote in his book, “The Crimson Tide: The Official Illustrated History of Alabama Football.”\n\nThe lines in “Tommy” say:\n\nBut it’s thin red line of ‘eroes when the drums begin to roll,\n\nThe drums begin to roll, my boys, the drums begin to roll,\n\nO it’s thin red line of ‘eroes, when the drums begin to roll.\n\nAllen Barra explained in his book “The Last Coach: A Life of Paul Bear Bryant:” “The red was for the team jerseys (their socks were red and white stripes), the thin because Alabama, like the Princeton team of 1869, was usually smaller than their opponents and proud of it.”\n\nThe house\n\nNaulakha does not look fancy from the outside. It is, after all, a rural home. But it included plenty of amenities neighboring farmers would not have had including a room for a servant, indoor bathrooms and a billiard room. The home also has numerous porches to take advantage of the stunning views.\n\nThe interior includes original woodwork and some original furnishings from the time Rudyard and his young wife Caroline “Carrie” Balestier lived in the home, although many antiques are in storage because the home is rented to the public. The Landmark Trust does showcase the desk where they believe “The Jungle Book” was written inside the home, as well as some photos and memorabilia.\n\nAnother fun feature is Rudyard’s bathtub, where guests can bathe and which was quite a luxury when the home was built.\n\nWhile living there, Kipling also wrote “Captains Courageous,” “The Days Work” and “The Seven Seas.” Guests can also see the room where Kipling’s guest Sir Arthur Conan Coyle slept.\n\nThe house was named in honor of Rudyard’s best friend and Carrie’s brother, Wolcott Balestier, with whom Rudyard co-authored the novel, “The Naulahka.” He and Carrie had three children and were happy for a few years."
