Title is found in trade journals from 1899 to 1905, this is number 21 of the Altemus' Love and Friendship Series, which lists to #33 on t he front panel of jacket. A scarce and early Kipling title to be found in original dustjacket. Original green cloth, paper label, original printed dustjacket. 'The Judgment of Dungara' has a vivid description of the loneliness of a mission station in the interior. 'Isolation that weighs upon the waking eyelids and drives you by force headlong into the labors of the day.' The missionary, besides giving his flock the Bread of Life, had taught them to weave white cloth from the glossy fibres of a plant that grew near by. The Civil Service official was due, and the converts, usually naked, were to appear for the first time clothed in their new garments, made, alas, from this terrible nettle. It was woven fire that ran through their limbs and gnawed into their bones. Needless to say, they broke ranks and rushed to the river, 'writhing, stamping, twisting and shedding garments, pursued by the thunder of the trumpet of the God Dungara. Near Fine in Very Good dustjacket."
