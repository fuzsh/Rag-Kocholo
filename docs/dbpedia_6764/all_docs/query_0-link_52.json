He spent the first years of his life in India, remembering it in later years as almost a paradise and as inspiration for his treasured Just So Stories. Join us under our glorious golden ceiling to hear a recording of these charming tales.\n\nThis is an event to mark the anniversary of the death of Rudyard Kipling. He died in the former Middlesex Hospital on 18 January 1936 and his body was laid out in the chapel until he was buried at Westminster Abbey in Poetsâ€™ Corner."
