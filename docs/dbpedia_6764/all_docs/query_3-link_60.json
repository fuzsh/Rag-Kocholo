'\n\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\n\nOr walk with Kings- -nor lose the common touch,\n\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\n\nIf all men count with you, but none too much:\n\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\n\nWith sixty seconds' worth of distance run,\n\nYours is the Earth and everything that's in it,\n\nAnd- -which is more- -you'll be a Man, my son!"
