        "text": "Why Rudyard Kipling’s “If” hangs in my office and what it can teach us about facing adversity.\n\nSometimes individuals with whom we think we have the least in common become our greatest teachers and dearest friends.\n\nMy last year in college, the gentleman who maintained my apartment building was an imposing man named Harold Stewart. Tall, strong and quick to share his opinion. Broken outlets, jammed doors, and leaking sinks were quickly resolved with one call to Harold.\n\nThe following year when I started a construction company, the first contractor I hired to help was a man I knew could do everything. Harold grew within the organization and eventually was responsible for not only his work, but ensuring the work of all other contractors was done well.\n\nAs much as he taught me about electricity or plumbing or hanging crown molding, Harold taught me far more about life. He taught me to give and not count the cost; to keep showing up and giving when others were in need; to not take friends for granted and to stay connected with them. Harold taught me to forgive those who offend, to see another person’s perspective and even to be open to liking rap and R&B music!\n\nRecently Harold came out to my office to hang a poem he purchased for me. It was authored more than a century ago by the great English author, Rudyard Kipling.\n\nAfter amassing profound wealth only to lose it, raising a daughter only to have her pass away of pneumonia, and receiving innumerable other blessings and significant challenges, it was Kipling’s encouragement for his son on what resilience, leadership and ultimately living well required.\n\nMy friend Harold shared it with me. I now pass it along to you. Please read it slowly and heed the advice.\n\nIF\n\nIf you can keep your head when all about you\n\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you;\n\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n\nBut make allowance for their doubting too;\n\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n\nOr, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\n\nOr, being hated, don’t give way to hating,\n\nAnd yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;\n\nIf you can dream—and not make dreams your master;\n\nIf you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;\n\nIf you can meet with triumph and disaster\n\nAnd treat those two impostors just the same;\n\nIf you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken\n\nTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\n\nOr watch the things you gave your life to broken,\n\nAnd stoop and build ’em up with wornout tools;\n\nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings\n\nAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\n\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings\n\nAnd never breathe a word about your loss;\n\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\n\nTo serve your turn long after they are gone,\n\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you\n\nExcept the Will which says to them: “Hold on”;\n\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\n\nOr walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;\n\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;\n\nIf all men count with you, but none too much;\n\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\n\nWith sixty seconds’ worth of distance run—\n\nYours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,\n\nAnd—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!\n\n— Rudyard Kipling\n\nMy friends, hold on. Because the best this is yet to come.\n\nThis is your day. Live Inspired."
