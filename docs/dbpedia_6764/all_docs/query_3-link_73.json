He and his wife returned to England. There he published another novel drawing on his knowledge of New England life; “Captains Courageous.”\n\nIn England he began to write more actively and published his two poems “Recessional” (1897) and “The White Man’s Burden” (1890) which gave rise to huge controversies.\n\nAfter death of his eldest daughter, Kipling published his novel “Kim”, the story of an orphan Irish boy, which was his finest work. In 1902 he completed is collection of stories called “Just So Stories” which would become one of his most acclaimed works. In the first decade of the20th century Kipling was at the height of his popularity. He wrote two science fiction “With the Night Mail” (1905) and “As Easy as A.B.C.” (1912), both set in the 21st century. After this came two great poetry and story collection “Puck of Pook’shill” (1906) and “Rewards and Fairies”(1910). Kipling wrote many other works and children’s classics. He was actively involved in the Boer War in South Africa and in 1917 he was assigned the post of “Honorary literary Advisor” to the Imperial war Graves Commission. After his son’s death, he wrote a poem “My Boy Jack” in which he deeply mourns for his son cursing and blaming himself.\n\nKipling kept writing until the early 1930s but at a slower pace. He died of a hemorrhage on 18 Jan 1936 and was cremated at golden green crematorium.\n\nIndia\n\nOne of the important aspects of Kipling’s writing is his observance of India. He gave a voice to the Indian people during his time. Description of India in the poem of Kipling is quite natural. Many older editions of his books have a swastika printed on their covers associated with a picture of an elephant carrying a lotus flower, reflecting the influence of Indian culture on him. His attachment with India, his birth country is not amazing. He compares Indian culture with British and found India more appealing. He compares the climate, the animals, and the ease of life in India with cold, rainy and coarse world of London. He believed in Indian culture as it is an exotic thing which provides men an exciting counterpart to their dreary London existence. Here people are always enigmatic and shows their true personality.\n\nMasculinity\n\nKipling’s poems deal with sentiments and behaviours of male. Kipling’s believed in the true characteristic of males‟ i.e. honesty, courage, humanity, stoicism. In his poems, male are willing to struggle against terrible odds. They are strong but silent, having feeling and emotions. His men do not believe in violence, pride or anger. They also rule over their inferiors but with a kind heart. His men face odd situation but they possess great courage even though they are helpless. They have faith in themselves with nobility of spirit.\n\nSoldiers\n\nKipling believes that it is an honor to serve in the country’s army. Through he was unable to serve due to his weak eyesight he encouraged them through his poems. In his poem he describes the poor treatment of soldiers by the government. He gives voice to these poor soldiers and tries to improve their condition. He has a very deep sympathy with them.\n\n14:03 Kipling’s IF\n\nSummary\n\nRudyard Kipling‟s “If” is a didactic poem by which the poet wants to give instructions in several specific traits of a good leader. It is about becoming mature and becoming an adult. Almost every line in each stanza begins with “if”. The speaker says that if you can keep your head when all people around you blaming it on you and losing their temper. The poem advises to be self confident and ignore all doubt. In first stanza, poet tells about patience, honest and fortitude of character. Kipling gives suggestion in the maintenance of righteous behaviour, a person must avoid proud and act in an ideal way during times of crisis. It also teaches a person the importance of waiting and advices him to not let lies, “If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, don’t deal in lies.” It the end of the stanza, the speaker warns against the arrogance.\n\nIn the second stanza, the poet asks to pursue one’s goal in life in the correct way. He praises dreams and thoughts but warns that those dreams and thought should not come their waking moment. He says that they should treat “Triumph and Disasters” in some manner and learn one another lesson from life. In the last two lines, he says that the journey towards success in never an easy one and most of the people want to bring them down but the idea of hard work in adversity remains positive.\n\nIn the third stanza, the poet wants to say that if people want success in life then they must take risks in life and they must be hopeful even if all things do not work out in desired way. While aiming towards bigger goals, he must not cry over smaller loss and always start again with a determined heart “Never breathe a word about your loss” shows the element of self-dignity.\n\nIn the last stanza, the poem takes a turn and gives message that once they have gained their aim, they should show ultimate modesty. In this stanza, “Kings” is contracted with “common” in order to cover all sections of society. The poet wants that a successful person should become a man who can fit well with all class of the society. He possesses the quality to mix up with the common crowd without losing his individuality. In the next line he argues to treat a foe with the same humbleness as a friend and not allowing them to hurt, develops his self confident and virtues. He also warns against the bad effect of money.\n\nAt the end he says that if readers, pays attention to his advices them no one can stop them from achieving success in life and being a man in the real sense.\n\nIn the last line readers realize that the poem is addressed not to them but to a younger son in the form of passing down of knowledge and wisdom from a father to his son.\n\nCentral Idea\n\nThe central idea of the poem is to become a human being having all virtue for betterment of our society after attaining the success in life. This awakens a variety of feeling such as inspiration and happiness. This success comes from self control. A person must not lose heart and self confidence because of opposition. He must not be impatient. He must treat every defeat as a challenge. He must respect common people. His attitude should never be giving up. Throughout the poem Kipling says that humanity affects our daily life and also our path of success. If a person has quality of honesty, firmness and patience, he will own the world and attain the full stature of man hood.\n\nCritical Analysis\n\nRudyard Kipling‟s “If” seems to have entered into the people’s general consciousness because of its sincerity, humility and warmth. It has four stanzas and each one has rhyming scheme a, b, ab, cd, cd. Each stanza has a little repetition.Language of the poem is figurative and as clean as water.\n\nThe titled word “If” is repeated several times to emphasize the need of hard work to gain success in life.\n\nFigures of speech used in poem are personification and metaphor. Dream is personified as a master who controls our lives. Triumph and Disaster are personified as importers who can lead us to the wrong path. Will is personified as a person who encourages us not to give up.\n\nIn the poem “Unforgiving minutes”, means time that waits for none. “Walk with kings” means to live important and rich people, “talk with crowds” means to mix with common people.\n\nThere are various symbols used in the poems like “Knaves” represent lions, Crowds symbolize the common people, Kings represents the important end rich people.\n\n14:04 Kipling’s Recessional\n\nIntroduction\n\nRudyard Kipling‟s poem “Recessional” published in 1897 on the occasion of Queen Victoria‟s diamond Jubilee. Kipling used his poem as a Christian prayer for mercy. Webster defines “Recessional” as “a hymn sung while the clergy and choir process out of church at the end of service. It describe that the most powerful person must befall. He begged God to spare England from misfortune “lest we forget” the sacrifice of Christ. He throughout the poem, the poet wrote about the majesty of god. He said that god is the still the centre of the universe. He is almighty. The growing industries of Victorian era could not overpower god.\n\nIn the next stanza, he compares alcohol and worldly power. Both can refrain to make correct judgment. A person desires to gain power and this become obsessed, he might develop a “wild tongue”. This tongue is used to fulfill one‟s desire. The poet compares wild tongue with the Gentile that is the non Jews, those without the special civilization and status of the biblical Jews. They were uncivilized in their values and do not please the Lord.\n\nIn the closing lines, the poet warns the English people of boasting and foolishness and asks God for mercy; “For frantic boast and foolish word, Thy mercy on Thy people Lord\n\n14:05 Kipling’s “The White Man’s Burden”\n\nIn the first stanza “harness” is used as a metaphor for service, “to wait in heavy harness, on fluttered folk wild”. He uses “light” as a metaphor for civilization and “night” for savagery. The title of the poem “the white man„s burden is taken as a metaphor for cultural imperialism.\n\nSource http://www.enotes.com/topic/whiteman‟s burden\n\n14:06 Kipling’s The Ballad of East and West\n\nTEXT\n\nOH, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet, Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God’s great Judgment Seat; But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,\n\nWhen two strong men stand face to face, tho’ they come from the ends of the earth!\n\nKamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border side, 5\n\nAnd he has lifted the Colonel’s mare that is the Colonel’s pride:\n\nHe has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day,\n\nAnd turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away.\n\nThen up and spoke the Colonel’s son that led a troop of the Guides:\n\n―Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides?‖ 10\n\nThen up and spoke Mahommed Khan, the son of the Ressaldar,\n\n―If ye know the track of the morning-mist, ye know where his pickets are.\n\nAt dusk he harries the Abazai—at dawn he is into Bonair,\n\nBut he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare,\n\nSo if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly, 15\n\nBy the favor of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tongue of Jagai,\n\nBut if he be passed the Tongue of Jagai, right swiftly turn ye then,\n\nFor the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamal’s men.\n\nThere is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,\n\nAnd ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen.‖20\n\nThe Colonel’s son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he,\n\nWith the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell, and the head of the gallows-tree.\n\nThe Colonel’s son to the Fort has won, they bid him stay to eat—\n\nWho rides at the tail of a Border thief, he sits not long at his meat.\n\nHe ’s up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly,25\n\nTill he was aware of his father’s mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai,\n\nTill he was aware of his father’s mare with Kamal upon her back,\n\nAnd when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack.\n\nHe has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide.\n\n―Ye shoot like a soldier,‖ Kamal said. ―Show now if ye can ride.‖30\n\nIt ’s up and over the Tongue of Jagai, as blown dust-devils go,\n\nThe dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe.\n\nThe dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above,\n\nBut the red mare played with the snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a glove.\n\nThere was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between, 35\n\nAnd thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho’ never a man was seen.\n\nThey have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn,\n\nThe dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn.\n\nThe dun he fell at a water-course—in a woful heap fell he,\n\nAnd Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free.40\n\nHe has knocked the pistol out of his hand—small room was there to strive, ―’T was only by favor of mine,‖ quoth he, ―ye rode so long alive:\n\nThere was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree, But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee.\n\nIf I had raised my bridle-hand, as I have held it low,45\n\nThe little jackals that flee so fast, were feasting all in a row:\n\nIf I had bowed my head on my breast, as I have held it high,\n\nThe kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly.‖\n\nLightly answered the Colonel’s son:—―Do good to bird and beast,\n\nBut count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast. 50\n\nIf there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away,\n\nBelike the price of a jackal’s meal were more than a thief could pay.\n\nThey will feed their horse on the standing crop, their men on the garnered grain,\n\nThe thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain.\n\nBut if thou thinkest the price be fair,—thy brethren wait to sup, 55\n\nThe hound is kin to the jackal-spawn,—howl, dog, and call them up!\n\nAnd if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack,\n\nGive me my father’s mare again, and I ’ll fight my own way back!‖\n\nKamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet.\n\n―No talk shall be of dogs,‖ said he, ―when wolf and gray wolf meet. 60\n\nMay I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath;\n\nWhat dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death?‖\n\nLightly answered the Colonel’s son: ―I hold by the blood of my clan:\n\nTake up the mare for my father’s gift—by God, she has carried a man!‖\n\nThe red mare ran to the Colonel’s son, and nuzzled against his breast, 65\n\n―We be two strong men,‖ said Kamal then, ―but she loveth the younger best.\n\nSo she shall go with a lifter’s dower, my turquoise-studded rein,\n\nMy broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain.‖\n\nThe Colonel’s son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end,\n\n―Ye have taken the one from a foe,‖ said he; ―will ye take the mate from a friend?‖ 70\n\n―A gift for a gift,‖ said Kamal straight; ―a limb for the risk of a limb.\n\nThy father has sent his son to me, I ’ll send my son to him!‖\n\nWith that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain-crest—\n\nHe trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance in rest.\n\n―Now here is thy master,‖ Kamal said, ―who leads a troop of the Guides, 75\n\nAnd thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides.\n\nTill Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed,\n\nThy life is his—thy fate it is to guard him with thy head.\n\nSo thou must eat the White Queen’s meat, and all her foes are thine,\n\nAnd thou must harry thy father’s hold for the peace of the border-line. 80\n\nAnd thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power—\n\nBelike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur.‖\n\nThey have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no fault,\n\nThey have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and salt:\n\nThey have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut sod, 85\n\nOn the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the Wondrous Names of God.\n\nThe Colonel’s son he rides the mare and Kamal’s boy the dun,\n\nAnd two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one.\n\nAnd when they drew to the Quarter-Guard, full twenty swords flew clear—\n\nThere was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer. 90\n\n―Ha’ done! ha’ done!‖ said the Colonel’s son. ―Put up the steel at your sides!\n\nLast night ye had struck at a Border thief—to-night ’t is a man of the Guides!‖\n\nOh, East is East, and West is West, and never the two shall meet, Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God’s great Judgment Seat;\n\nBut there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth, 95\n\nWhen two strong men stand face to face, tho’ they come from the ends of the earth.\n\nImmediately the colonels‟ son mounts his dun horse and goes to find Kamal. He arrives at fort Bukloh and stays there for a short time. He rides until he finds Kamal at the Tongue of Jagai, riding the stolen mare of his father. The colonel‟s son fires twice but both go wide.\n\nThe two men ride and ride and finally the colonel‟s son‟s horse falls at a water course. Kamal pulls him free. He says it is he who allows him to run so far. The colonel‟s son challenges Kamal to shoot him but also warns him of the consequences,” ‘But if thou thinkest the price be fair, thy brethren\n\nwait to sup, The hound is kin to the jackal-spawn, howl, dog, and call them up!\n\nAnd if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack, Give me my father’s mare again, and I’ll fight my own way back!’\n\nCritical Analysis\n\nThe poem is written in the style of border ballad, an Anglo-Scottish poetic form which has motifs but lacked a chorus. The vocabulary, phrases and rhythms are parts of the old ballads and the culture is different. It begins and ends with the quatrain. It is printed as rhyming heptameters.\n\nThe first line is the actual story, the second line contains a term for stolen and the fourth “calkin” means a trick of horse-mounted brigades. The second quatrain has the house stock phrase. There is a couplet that is repeated with slight variations several times; “There is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between, And ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen.”\n\nyou can view video on Rudyard Kipling\n\nReference\n\nWebsites\n\nhttp://www.kipling.org.uk/rg_wouldbeking_notes.htm\n\nThe Ballad of East and West About.com\n\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org\n\nwww.biography.com\n\nwww.kiplingsociety.co.uk\n\nwww.britannica.com\n\nArticles"
