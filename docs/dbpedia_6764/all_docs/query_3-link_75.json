Christmas was a theme that Kipling came back to throughout his career, beginning with the poem Christmas in India which he wrote when he was twenty. Eddi’s Service first appeared in Kipling’s book Rewards and Fairies in 1910 and features a most unusual Christmas midnight mass:\n\nEddi’s Service\n\n(A.D. 687)\n\nEDDI, priest of St. Wilfrid\n\nIn his chapel at Manhood End,\n\nOrdered a midnight service\n\nFor such as cared to attend.\n\nBut the Saxons were keeping Christmas,\n\nAnd the night was stormy as well.\n\nNobody came to service,\n\nThough Eddi rang the bell.\n\n‘Wicked weather for walking,’\n\nSaid Eddi of Manhood End.\n\n‘But I must go on with the service\n\nFor such as care to attend.\n\nThe altar-lamps were lighted, –\n\nAn old marsh-donkey came,\n\nBold as a guest invited,\n\nAnd stared at the guttering flame.\n\nThe storm beat on at the windows,\n\nThe water splashed on the floor,\n\nAnd a wet, yoke-weary bullock\n\nPushed in through the open door.\n\n‘How do I know what is greatest,\n\nHow do I know what is least?\n\nThat is My Father’s business,’\n\nSaid Eddi, Wilfrid’s priest.\n\n‘But – three are gathered together –\n\nListen to me and attend.\n\nI bring good news, my brethren!’\n\nSaid Eddi of Manhood End.\n\nAnd he told the Ox of a Manger\n\nAnd a Stall in Bethlehem,\n\nAnd he spoke to the Ass of a Rider,\n\nThat rode to Jerusalem.\n\nThey steamed and dripped in the chancel,\n\nThey listened and never stirred,\n\nWhile, just as though they were Bishops,\n\nEddi preached them The Word,\n\nTill the gale blew off on the marshes\n\nAnd the windows showed the day,\n\nAnd the Ox and the Ass together\n\nWheeled and clattered away.\n\nAnd when the Saxons mocked him,\n\nSaid Eddi of Manhood End,\n\n‘I dare not shut His chapel\n\nOn such as care to attend.’\n\nThe thirty-first in my ongoing series examining the poetry of Rudyard Kipling.

To most of her British subjects she became a mother figure, as her reign went on, particularly in the 1880s and 1890s. After the death of her beloved husband Prince Albert in 1861, shortly after his efforts in toning down a British message to the Lincoln administration during the Trent affair helped avert war between the United States and Great Britain, she put on black mourning which she wore for the remainder of her life. Her relative isolation after that perhaps added to her air of majesty as she became a symbol of her far flung domains encompassing a quarter of the population of the Earth.\n\nKipling had a fairly ambivalent attitude to the British monarchy, liking them well enough as human beings, but also recognizing the struggle that had been waged throughout English history to gain liberties. The role of British monarchs during Kipling’s life time suited Kipling: they were now out of politics and reigned but did not rule. Kipling had boundless contempt for almost all politicians, calling them little tin gods on wheels, an expression not original to him but which he dearly loved. In his Barrack Room Ballads (1892) Kipling inserted a tribute by a common soldier to the Widow of Windsor:\n\n‘Ave you ‘eard o’ the Widow at Windsor\n\nWith a hairy gold crown on ‘er ‘ead?\n\nShe ‘as ships on the foam — she ‘as millions at ‘ome,\n\nAn’ she pays us poor beggars in red.\n\n(Ow, poor beggars in red!)\n\nThere’s ‘er nick on the cavalry ‘orses,\n\nThere’s ‘er mark on the medical stores —\n\nAn’ ‘er troopers you’ll find with a fair wind be’ind\n\nThat takes us to various wars.\n\n(Poor beggars! — barbarious wars!)\n\nThen ‘ere’s to the Widow at Windsor,\n\nAn’ ‘ere’s to the stores an’ the guns,\n\nThe men an’ the ‘orses what makes up the forces\n\nO’ Missis Victorier’s sons.\n\n(Poor beggars! Victorier’s sons!)\n\nWalk wide o’ the Widow at Windsor,\n\nFor ‘alf o’ Creation she owns:\n\nWe ‘ave bought ‘er the same with the sword an’ the flame,\n\nAn’ we’ve salted it down with our bones.\n\n(Poor beggars! — it’s blue with our bones!)\n\nHands off o’ the sons o’ the Widow,\n\nHands off o’ the goods in ‘er shop,\n\nFor the Kings must come down an’ the Emperors frown\n\nWhen the Widow at Windsor says “Stop”!\n\n(Poor beggars! — we’re sent to say “Stop”!)\n\nThen ‘ere’s to the Lodge o’ the Widow,\n\nFrom the Pole to the Tropics it runs —\n\nTo the Lodge that we tile with the rank an’ the file,\n\nAn’ open in form with the guns.\n\n(Poor beggars! — it’s always they guns!)\n\nWe ‘ave ‘eard o’ the Widow at Windsor,\n\nIt’s safest to let ‘er alone:\n\nFor ‘er sentries we stand by the sea an’ the land\n\nWherever the bugles are blown.\n\n(Poor beggars! — an’ don’t we get blown!)\n\nTake ‘old o’ the Wings o’ the Mornin’,\n\nAn’ flop round the earth till you’re dead;\n\nBut you won’t get away from the tune that they play\n\nTo the bloomin’ old rag over’ead.\n\n(Poor beggars! — it’s ‘ot over’ead!)\n\nThen ‘ere’s to the sons o’ the Widow,\n\nWherever, ‘owever they roam.\n\n‘Ere’s all they desire, an’ if they require\n\nA speedy return to their ‘ome.\n\n(Poor beggars! — they’ll never see ‘ome!)

One of the many reasons to read Kipling is due to how much of his writing stands the test of time. A good example of this is Dane-geld written in 1911. Danegeld was a tax levied by the Kings of Wessex to buy peace with the various invading warbands of Danes in the ninth through the eleventh century. The Danegeld of course convinced the various Danes in Denmark that it was a good idea to invade England, be bought off in gold by a Saxon king and then to settle in England and repeat the process whenever money ran short. One would think that the bad consequences of giving way to such extortion should be obvious, but it is amazing how often this simple lesson has been repeated down the centuries. The Obama administration has paid Danegeld of a sort to various enemies, or would be enemies, of the US, including Iran, Russia, North Korea, thus having the US pay for trouble down the road.\n\nKipling is not merely to be read for amusement during an idle hour. Read carefully he often has wisdom useful for today. Here is the text of Dane-geld: (more…)\n\nThe cheapest and most childish of all the taunts of the Pacifists is, I think, the sneer at belligerents for appealing to the God of Battles.
