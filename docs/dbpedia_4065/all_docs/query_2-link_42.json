        "text": "Salt Lake City Food Truck Guide\n\nDeveloping a Plan for Success\n\nIn Salt Lake City, our goal is to help every food truck owner—from the seasoned veterans to the new startups like you— we are here to help you take your business to the next level.\n\nWe have created this guide to help you avoid any of the pitfalls that may come in the process. And, as always, we’re here to help. If you have any questions or comments please reach out to the contacts listed below.\n\nThis guide covers the key factors that determine your success in Salt Lake City – including local laws and licensing requirements, parking opportunities, commissaries, and health code standards.\n\nWe recommend that you start BOTH Salt Lake City and County requirements concurrently, to save time. We want to help get you up and running as quickly as possible.\n\nLocal Laws and Licensing Requirements\n\nFirst, it is a good idea to get familiar with the state-level standards set forth by the State of Utah Laws for Food Truck Operators and also the latest bills impacting food trucks.\n\nNext, think about where you plan on operating your food truck and which local commissary you will be using.\n\nSalt Lake City has adopted ordinances that address mobile food vending on both public and private property /special events. Standards for vending on public rights-of-way are addressed in Salt Lake City’s business licensing division.\n\nWhether you choose to operate a food truck in a public or private setting within City limits:\n\nA current Salt Lake City Business License is required for all mobile food businesses operating within Salt Lake City and separate fees are required for each vehicle.\n\nA background check is required on owner/driver(s).\n\nA certificate of insurance as set forth in section 63-30-34 of Utah Code.\n\nAll vehicles must meet all Salt Lake Valley Health Department requirements.\n\nNo professional or personal services shall be provided from the mobile business.\n\nAll materials generated from the business must be disposed of properly. Trash and recycling containers shall be provided for use of their patrons.\n\nThe area around the business must be maintained in a clean and attractive condition.\n\nAll signs must be physically attached to the vehicle unless authorized by ordinance.\n\nMobile food truck vehicles are not allowed to operate everywhere in Salt Lake City. And the laws vary slightly on whether you are in a public or private property/special event.\n\nFor public right-of-way locations:\n\nMobile food truck vehicles and trailers are allowed to operate in the public right-of-way only within the, M-1, M-2, D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4, G-MU, in accordance with 5.69. See Salt Lake City’s zoning map to get an idea of where these zones are located within City limits.\n\nOnly one vehicle operating in the public right of way is allowed within the same block face at one time.\n\nWhen operating in the public right of way the vending window must face the sidewalk unless special permission is received from the Transportation Division.\n\nNo vehicle shall operate within one hundred feet (100’) on the same liner block face to the door of a restaurant or other food vendor without a waiver.\n\nAll enclosures or canopy extensions must not project into the public right of way unless authorized by the Transportation Division.\n\nBusiness activity is to be temporary and the mobile food truck may not park at one location in the public right of way for more than two (2) hours unless a permit is received from the Transportation Division and cannot exceed more than 12 hours during any 24 hour period.\n\nSpecial considerations for private and/or special event locations:\n\nFood trucks are allowed to operate on private property only in certain zones with written permission of the property owner and cannot exceed more than 12 hours during any 24 hour period.\n\nSpecial event food truck vendors shall be governed by other ordinance, city policy, or executive order where applicable.\n\nAs you begin the process of applying for a Salt Lake City business license, it is important to know that all mobile food units are required to use a local commissary– a residential kitchen is not allowed.\n\nIf this is your first time operating a food truck in Salt Lake City, the business license is usually with the city where the commissary is located. These are the things you will need to bring with the application:\n\nSalt Lake City Food Truck Checklist\n\nCopy of all necessary licenses or permits required by state or local health and transportation authorities\n\nCertificate of Insurance\n\nWhere applicable, written permission for use of private property from property owner\n\nProof of State Tax Identification for Salt Lake City\n\nCopy of a valid driver’s license for each driver\n\nIf you are already licensed in another city in Utah, (also known as a reciprocal based mobile food truck) these are the things you will need to bring:\n\nSalt Lake City Food Truck Checklist – Reciprocal Based\n\nWhere applicable, written permission for use of private property from property owner\n\nCopy of all necessary licenses or permits required by state or local health.\n\nCurrent City Business License within the State of Utah\n\nCurrent Health Department Food Truck/Trailer Permit from local Health Department within the State of Utah\n\nCurrent approval of a City within the State, that shows the Food Truck/Trailer passed a Fire safety inspection in accordance to Subsection 11-55-104(4)(a).\n\nAll required steps with the Salt Lake County can be done concurrently with Salt Lake City’s requirements.\n\nThe Salt Lake County Food Truck Booklet is a great place to research health code standards, expected costs, food permits, safety requirements and more.\n\nVisit Salt Lake County’s mobile food service guidelines and follow this recommended checklist:\n\nAttend a certified manager course and/or food handler class.\n\nObtain a signed commissary agreement from the commissary owner.\n\nRegister with the State of Utah Department of Commerce.\n\nApply with City Business Licensing.\n\nFill out Food Cart Mobile Unit Plan Review application.\n\nFill out food flow charts for every menu item to be served.\n\nFill out Permit Application.\n\nObtain a Restroom Agreement signed by property owner (not needed for mobile trucks).\n\nSubmit Commissary Agreement for approval to Salt Lake County Health Department.\n\nAfter Commissary Agreement has been approved submit the following to Salt Lake County Health Department:\n\nTruck/trailer registration if applicable\n\nVending route if applicable\n\nCompleted Food Cart Mobile Unit Plan Review application\n\nCompleted Food Flow Charts\n\nRestroom agreement signed by property owner (not needed for mobile trucks)\n\nCompleted Permit Application\n\nAll applicable fees\n\nTo follow is a list of approved commissaries in our area.
