        "text": "Over the last decade, the nation grew at its slowest rate since the 1930s, a slowdown broadly reflected in local area 2020 Census population counts released today.\n\nLess than half of the nation’s 3,143 counties or equivalents gained population from 2010 to 2020, while the populations of around four-fifths of metro areas grew during the time period.\n\nAmong the decade’s most notable fast-growing areas were counties in western North Dakota, led by McKenzie County which grew by 131%, and Williams County, up 83%.\n\nIn 2020, 86% of the U.S. population lived in metropolitan statistical areas, up from 85% in 2010. Another 8% lived in micropolitan statistical areas, down from 9% in 2010.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2020, the population of U.S. metro areas grew by 9%, while the population of U.S. micro areas grew by 1%. All metro and micro areas in Puerto Rico lost population during that period.\n\nThe nation’s 10 largest incorporated places (cities) all grew this past decade.\n\nThe population of around four-fifths (81%) of U.S. metro areas increased between 2010 and 2020 (Figure 2) but only 48% of U.S. micro areas grew over the decade.\n\nThe 10 largest metro areas all grew between 2010 and 2020, led by two in Texas: Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington and Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land each grew by approximately 20%.\n\nDallas-Fort Worth and Houston were also two of the nation’s three metro areas to gain at least 1.2 million people over the decade. New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA was the third.\n\nFive metro areas crossed the 1.0 million-person threshold between 2010 and 2020: Grand Rapids-Kentwood, MI; Tucson, AZ; Urban Honolulu, HI; Tulsa, OK; and Fresno, CA.\n\nAmong all U.S. metro areas, The Villages in Florida grew the fastest, followed by Austin-Round Rock-Georgetown, TX; St. George, UT; Greeley, CO; and Myrtle Beach-Conway-North Myrtle Beach, SC-NC.\n\nThe two fastest-growing U.S. micro areas were in North Dakota (Williston and Dickinson), followed by one each in Montana (Bozeman), Idaho (Rexburg) and Utah (Heber).\n\nWilliston, Bozeman, Rexburg and Heber were also four of the six micro areas to gain at least 15,000 people between 2010 and 2020; the other two were Hilo, HI, and Jefferson, GA.\n\nThe faster-growing micro areas tended to be located near the faster-growing metro areas, while slower-growing and declining micro areas tended to be located near slower-growing and declining metro areas.\n\nAll metro and micro areas in Puerto Rico lost population between 2010 and 2020.\n\nAs first reported in April (when the 2020 Census apportionment numbers were released), Texas experienced the largest numeric increase between 2010 and 2020, followed by Florida, California, Georgia and Washington (Figure 3, Table 2).\n\nThese five states accounted for nearly half of the total numeric population increase in the United States between 2010 and 2020.\n\nUtah was the fastest-growing state, increasing by 18.4% between 2010 and 2020, followed by Idaho, Texas, North Dakota and Nevada, which each grew by 15.0% or more.\n\nOverall, 13 states and the District of Columbia grew by 10.0% or greater. All are in the West or South regions, with the exception of North Dakota in the Midwest region. Massachusetts was the fastest-growing state in the Northeast at 7.4%.\n\nCalifornia was the most populous state in 2020 (39.5 million), followed by Texas (29.1 million), Florida (21.5 million), New York (20.2 million) and Pennsylvania (13.0 million).\n\nOverall, 10 states had 2020 populations of 10.0 million or greater, which together contain more than half of the U.S. population.\n\nThe populations of three states — West Virginia, Mississippi and Illinois — and Puerto Rico declined over the decade."
