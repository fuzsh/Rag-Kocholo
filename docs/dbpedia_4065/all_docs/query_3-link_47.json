        "text": "The Carrier with the Most Coverage in Heber City, UT\n\nIf you want coverage in the most places in Heber City, UT, what carrier is best?\n\nThe answer is simple: AT&T.\n\nAT&T has the most coverage in Heber City, UT. Its 4GÂ LTE and 5GÂ networks cover 77.2% of the city.Â\n\nYou can further break AT&T's coverage down into areas with good, great, or poor reception.\n\nHere's the full breakdown of AT&T coverage in Heber City, UT:\n\nTotal coverage area: 77.2%\n\nGreat reception: 25.5%\n\nGood reception: 25.1%\n\nPoor reception: 26.6%\n\nNo coverage: 22.8%\n\nGreat (25.5%)\n\nGood (25.1%)\n\nPoor(26.6%)\n\nNone (22.8%)\n\nAT&T Coverage\n\nThe network with the second best coverage in Heber City, UT is T-Mobile.Â\n\nT-Mobile covers 43.8% of the city with its 4GÂ LTE and 5GÂ networks.\n\nBut how good is the quality of the coverage on T-Mobile?\n\nHere are the full details of T-Mobile's coverage in Heber City, UT:\n\nTotal coverage area: 43.8%\n\nGreat reception: 15%\n\nGood reception: 13.6%\n\nPoor reception: 15.2%\n\nNo coverage: 56.2%\n\nGreat (15%)\n\nGood ( 13.6%)\n\nPoor (15.2%)\n\nNone (56.2%)\n\nT-Mobile Coverage\n\nVerizon is the third best option in Heber City, UT.\n\nIts 4GÂ LTE and 5GÂ networks cover 42.2% of the city.\n\nHow good is the quality of coverage?\n\nHere is how the quality of Verizon's coverage is broken down in Heber City, UT:\n\nTotal coverage area: 42.2%\n\nGreat reception: 11.9%\n\nGood reception: 13.3%\n\nPoor reception: 17%\n\nNo coverage: 57.8%\n\nGreat (11.9%)\n\nGood (13.3%)\n\nPoor (17%)\n\nNone (57.8%)\n\nVerizon Coverage\n\nBut how do AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon compare side-by-side in terms of overall coverage and reception quality in Heber City, UT?\n\nUse the comparison below to see how the three carriers stack up:\n\nCell Phone Coverage Comparison in Heber City\n\nAT&T Coverage\n\nT-Mobile Coverage\n\nVerizon Coverage\n\nBest Cell Phone Plans in Heber City\n\nOkay, now that you know the carrier with the best coverage and fastest data speeds in Heber City, UT, what cell phone plan should you sign up for?\n\nThere are a few great options.\n\nAnd some of them can save you a LOT of money.\n\nBut how?\n\nIt turns out that the big carriers, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, are known as MNOs, or mobile network operators. They build and operate their own networks by putting up cell towers, laying fiber optic cable, and purchasing spectrum licenses from the FCC.\n\nThe MNOs will also sell access to their networks to MVNOs.\n\nWhat is an MVNO?\n\nAn MVNO, or mobile virtual network operator, is any carrier that does not own its own wireless network. Instead, these small carriers purchase network access from AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon.\n\nPopular examples of MVNOs include Mint Mobile, Boost Infinite, and Visible.\n\nWhy is this important to you?\n\nUnderstanding MVNOS is important because it means you can sign up for service on an MVNO and get the exact same coverage as one of the major carriers. Whichever major carrier the MVNO has an agreement with is the underlying network you will use for coverage.\n\nMVNOs can also save you a LOT of money, too, because they have more affordable plans.\n\nIn addition to negotiating low wholesale rates for network access from the major carriers, MVNOs also use other cost-saving strategies such as operating online only to pass additional savings on to consumers.\n\nWould you save money by signing up for an MVNO?\n\nSee for yourself by comparing some highlighted plan options on each of the major networks below:\n\nHow are the Coverage Scores calculated?\n\nThe Coverage Scores are calculated for each of the carriers by looking at three key metrics:\n\nCoverage\n\nData Speeds\n\nReliability\n\nCoverage\n\nThe Coverage Score is on a scale from 0 to 10.\n\nTo calculate the coverage score, we look at two key metrics: 1) the total area covered and 2) the tower density.\n\nThe total area covered comes from the signal strength data from the FCC. Any area that has signal is counted toward the total the total coverage area. A higher coverage area means a higher score. A lower coverage area means a lower score.\n\nThe tower density metric is also calculated using the FCC signal strength data. We estimate a carrier's tower density by looking at how many areas have high signal strength compared to low signal strength. Lots of areas with great signal indicate a higher tower density, and thus a higher score.\n\nData Speeds\n\nThe Data Speeds score is on a scale from 0 to 10.\n\nWe calculate the score by looking at a carrier's median download and upload speeds in a given area. Faster speeds means getting a higher score. We weigh the median download speed at 70% of the total score and the median upload speed at 30% of the total score.\n\nTo score a perfect 10/10, a carrier would need to get median speeds of 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload.\n\nReliability\n\nThe Reliability Score is on a scale from 0 to 10. The goal for the Reliability Score is to estimate how likely you'll have a usable connection when you have service.\n\nTo calculate the Reliability score, we look at the bottom 10%, 5% and 1% of data speeds in a given area. The download speeds are weighted at 50% of the score. Upload speeds are weighted at 20% of the score.\n\nWe also look at latency to calculate the Reliability Score.\n\nLatency is a measurement of how long it takes a data packet to travel from the sender to the receiver. You can think of latency as answering the question, \"how much delay is there in the network?\"\n\nIf there is high latency (30ms to 100ms), it takes a long time for data packets to be sent and received by your phone. Your connection may feel slow or \"laggy.\"\n\nIf there is low latencyÂ (under 30ms), your connection will feel fast and responsive.\n\nLatency is weighted at 30% of the Reliability Score.\n\nOverall Score\n\nâThe overall score looks at the Coverage, Data Speeds, and Reliability Scores and weighs them as follows:\n\nCoverage Score: 70%\n\nReliability Score: 23%\n\nData Speeds Score: 7%â\n\nWhere does CoverageMap.com get its coverage and speed data from?\n\nCoverageMap.com gets different data from different sources.\n\nThe overall coverage and signal strength data comes from the FCC's mobile broadband map.\n\nThe information about data speeds and network performance comes from community members contributing speed test results to our crowd-sourced coverage map.
