        "text": "County Council Approves Plans for the Heber Valley Utah Temple\n\nOn Wednesday, November 8, the Wasatch County Council unanimously approved plans for the Heber Valley Utah Temple following a heated public hearing that went late into the night. In response to concerns that have been expressed over protecting the county's dark skies, the Church has made numerous concessions on exterior lighting. \"The Heber Valley Utah Temple will be one of the dimmest temples in the world,\" said Curtis Miner, the principle architect on the project. Church representatives may begin the process of obtaining building permits in 15 days.\n\nWasatch County Lighting Code Amended to Allow Uplighting\n\nThe Wasatch County Council has unanimously approved an amendment to the lighting code to allow uplighting, following a request submitted by the Church in November. The change will permit evening uplighting of the Heber Valley Utah Temple with restrictions. Community members have advocated on both sides of the issue for months, leading Council members to come into agreement on a middle ground that prevents bright lights from blocking views of the stars without overly restricting businesses.\n\nNeighborhood Open House Held for the Heber Valley Utah Temple\n\nHundreds of members and neighbors attended an informational gathering on Tuesday evening at the meetinghouse located across from the Heber Valley Utah Temple site. Interior renderings were on display, and Church representatives were available to answer questions. The Church applied for an update to the county code last year that would allow exterior lighting of the temple. The matter is expected to be addressed at an upcoming planning commission meeting.\n\nPresident Nelson Presides at the Heber Valley Utah Temple Groundbreaking Ceremony\n\nPresident Russell M. Nelson made a surprise appearance at the Heber Valley Utah Temple groundbreaking ceremony on Saturday, October 8, 2022. He presided at the event and addressed the gathered audience. \"Today, we will begin the work by breaking ground for a temple in this unique and wonderful valley,\" he said. \"I love you all and whole-heartedly rejoice with you.\" He said of George Holmes, Sr., the original owner of the temple site, \"For years, he had dreamt of building a forever home with his beloved Clara. In a very real way, his dream will be realized.\" The 88,000-square-foot temple will be built on the 17.9-acre site located on East Center Street in Heber City."
