        "text": "Did you know that it snows on average, one foot every five days during the winter? Seriously.\n\nIf that's not a reason to book your trip, how about the fact that 10 Utah resorts sit within an hour of Salt Lake City International Airport, and there are 98 non-stop flights offered daily?\n\nDo we have your attention yet? Here's your guide to picking the perfect basecamp for the greatest ski trip ever. The subtle differences of each resort and basecamp are detailed below to help you find the perfect area and resort fit for you.\n\nResort Comparison Tool\n\nBefore we introduce you to Utah's resorts, get a lay of the land from our Utah ski resorts map below. In this easy-to-read map of Utah ski resorts, you can see clearly just how many great resorts we have around the central point of SLC airport. Whether you are looking for a big, European-style family resort or a smaller hidden gem just for your inner powderhound (and money-saver), you can find exactly what you're looking for in Utah.\n\nSome prefer to also look at it this way: In this map, paid by famous ski map painter Jim Niehues, north is located at the bottom and south at the top. Neihues intentionally did this to emphasize and showcase Utah's many awesome north-facing slopes.\n\nDownload High Resolution \"Utah Ski Resort State Map\" by Niehues\n\nExplore Utah's Areas\n\nPark City Area | Deer Valley Resort - Park City Mountain - Woodward\n\nThe envy of every other ski town, Park City is a mere 35 minutes from Salt Lake City International Airport. Once there, choose between Park City Mountain, Deer Valley Resort, or Utah's newest resort Woodward Park City. Either way, you can find plenty of après ski opportunities wandering Park City's Main Street with over 100 bars and restaurants.\n\nPark City Area - lodging, activities and food\n\nSalt Lake Area | Alta - Brighton - Solitude - Snowbird\n\nBig city life and deep powder together in one package. That's the beauty of Salt Lake City, aptly dubbed Ski City. Stay downtown and be on top of Solitude, Brighton, Alta or Snowbird before you know it. All of these resorts feature incredible terrain and over 500\" annually of The Greatest Snow on Earth®. So go ahead, have the best of both worlds.\n\nSalt Lake Area - lodging, activities and food\n\nOgden Area | Powder Mountain - Snowbasin - Nordic Valley\n\nFor crazy amounts of untracked powder and nonexistent lift lines, try the Ogden region. Both can be easily found off the beaten path at Powder Mountain, Snowbasin and Nordic Valley. The town of Ogden and its historic 25th Street are just 30 minutes away from all the skiing. Stay, dine and play right here.\n\nOgden Area - lodging, activities and food\n\nHeber Valley | Sundance Resort - Deer Valley Resort\n\nExperience a winter wonderland in an idyllic alpine valley. Just 45 minutes from the Salt Lake International Airport, the Heber Valley offers family fun, scenic mountain views and the awe-inspiring Midway Ice Castle. Just 12 minutes from the Deer Valley Resort gondola or 20 minutes from Sundance Mountain Resort find your perfect ski getaway with Heber Valley.\n\nHeber Valley - lodging, activities and food\n\nSouthern Utah Area | Brian Head - Eagle Point\n\nThe Greatest Snow on Earth® meets red rock at Utah's two most southern resorts: Eagle Point and Brian Head Ski Resort. Around four hours from Salt Lake City International Airport and three hours north of Las Vegas by car. Both laid-back and wonderfully crowd-free.\n\nSouthern Utah - lodging, activities and food\n\nNorthern Utah | Beaver Mountain - Cherry Creek\n\nHome to Utah State University, Logan is an idyllic Northern Utah town cozily nestled within the beautiful Cache Valley. Thirty minutes east from there, just down Highway 89, is Beaver Mountain–the oldest family-owned-and-operated resort in North America. Perfect for families with kids or those looking for a true throwback. Cherry Creek is also family owned and located just north of Logan near the Idaho border, a smaller resort sitting on 400 acres in Cherry Creek Canyon.\n\nNorthern Utah - lodging, activities and food\n\nProvo Area | Sundance\n\nFun to say and as breathtaking as they come, Mt. Timpanogos is home to the famed Sundance Mountain Resort. For a romantic getaway, incredible dining options or fantastic art classes, stay on the mountain or make the short journey 20 minutes to Provo – fast becoming famous in its own right as the Silicon Valley of the Rockies.\n\nProvo Area - lodging, activities and food\n\nFor more area-related information, check out these blog posts:"
