        "text": "Finding Wild Horses and Burros in Arizona\n\n(this page is still in progress)\n\nReturn to Finding Wild Horses & Burroshere for tips on visiting the range and to find herds in other areas\n\nAlamo Herd Management Area - Wild Burros\n\n​Size: 341,000 acres\n\nNumber of wild burros the BLM deems appropriate for the herd area is 128-160\n\nTo get to the wild burros in the Alamo HMA, take Hwy 60 west out of Wickenberg or east out of Salome to the small town of Wenden and turn north on 2nd St which turns into Alamo Rd. This is a paved road all the way up to Alamo Lake State Park. Watch for burros on the hills along the paved road but it sounds like the burros may be found closer to Alamo Lake stretching north, east and west of the lake: along the Bill Williams river which heads west and east out of Alamo Lake, along the Santa Maria River wash east of Alamo Lake, and the Sandy River wash which stretches north out of Alamo Lake.\n\nThere are several roads that go both east and west off Alamo Rd and all around Alamo Lake - if you take the dirt roads then you should probably have a high clearance vehicle suitable for driving on soft dirt/sand roads, or a OHV. The Big Sandy HMA is the north border and the Havasu HMA is the west border. ​\n\nBig Sandy Herd Management Area - Wild Burros\n\n​Size: 341,000 acres\n\nNumber of wild burros the BLM deems appropriate for the herd area is 128-160\n\nBlack Mountain Herd Management Area - Wild Burros\n\n​Size: 1,100,000 acres\n\nNumber of wild burros the BLM deems appropriate for the herd area is 382-478\n\nThe Black Mountain herd area can found by taking Hwy 10 / Oatman Hwy southwest out of Kingman. Its a beautiful drive once you get out there and you may start seeing burros right away along the hillsides. Be sure to slow down as you go around corners on the curvy part of the highway (about a 9 mile stretch) as burros are in the road all the time. There are several turnouts and short dirt roads you can take to look for them.\n\nOnce you pass the mine you can turn right onto Silver Creek Rd which is a well graded gravel road suitable for all vehicles. I spotted a few bands along the hills (see bottom left photo) and a few of the bands approached my truck and tried to open the door with their teeth!\n\nThere are roads that stretch all the way between the Oatman Highway and Highway 68 to the north and I'm sure you'd spot burros everywhere in between since the herd area is over 1 million acres.\n\nCerbat Mountains Management Area\n\n​Size: 341,000 acres\n\nNumber of wild horses the BLM deems appropriate for the herd area is 72-90\n\nThe Cerbat Mountains wild horses are direct descendants of Spanish mustangs and that can easily be seen in their colors, markings, and conformation. It appears that the herd management area has been divided in two by fencing and that the horses are only on the west side. To get to the herd area take Stockton Hill Rd north out of Kingman about 10.5 miles to Vock Canyon Rd and turn west (left). You might also see wild horses along Stockton Hill Rd to the west before reaching Vock Canyon Rd and there are a few dirt roads you can take to possibly get closer to them.\n\nThe first part of the road is suitable for most vehicles; you will pass a corral on the left and notice there are several houses along this stretch of road. You might see horses straight away, if not, keep driving. This is a public road so you have every right to drive on it. Once you pass the larger group of houses keep an eye on the hills for wild horses. There will likely also be cattle in the area. The road quickly becomes quite a bit rougher and I do recommend you don't continue unless you have really good tires and a high clearance vehicle. I only made it about 5 miles up the road before it became too rough for the truck. If you have an OHV you could keep going, just keep in mind that ATVs/OHVs usually scare wild horses away because they are so loud.\n\nVock Canyon Rd keeps going for a few more miles and it also forks to the south and runs into Shadow Canyon Rd which takes you back out to Stockton Hill Rd. I found the Cerbat horses that are near the houses were used to people and didn't run away, but the horses further up the road were very skittish and ran when I approached.\n\nCibola-Trigo Management Area - Wild Horses and Burros\n\n​Size: HMA is 179,000 acres and the Herd Area is 263,700\n\nNumber of wild burros the BLM deems appropriate for the herd area is 165 and the number of wild horses is 150\n\nHavasu Management Area - Wild Burros\n\n​Size: 450,790 acres\n\nNumber of wild burros the BLM deems appropriate for the herd area is 133-166\n\nHeber Wild Horse Territory\n\nNumber of wild burros the Forest Service deems appropriate for the herd area is 50-104\n\nI have not yet visited the Heber wild horses. Click on the map to the right to open a larger PDF of the map which you can print out and refer to for directions. This map is provided by the Forest Service.\n\nThe Heber herd is located southwest of the town of Heber south of Hwy 260. There are a number of forest roads you can turn onto to access the herd area.\n\nClick on the map to see a larger version\n\nLake Pleasant Management Area - Wild Burros\n\n​Size: 103,000 acres\n\nNumber of wild burros the BLM deems appropriate for the herd area is 166 - 208"
