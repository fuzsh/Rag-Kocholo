        "text": "Below is a list of Frequently Asked Questions. If you still cannot find what you’re looking for, feel free to call us for more information: (800)-356-9796.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIf my plane is late, and I miss my shuttle, do I lose my ticket?\n\nNo. If you miss the shuttle due to flight connections, call the office immediately and let them know. They will schedule you on the next available shuttle with no additional charge.\n\nDue to airport security and regulations, as well as the other traveling passengers, we cannot wait longer than 5 minutes past our scheduled departure times. As soon as your flight lands, call the office or go straight to the shuttle to let the driver know you are there. If we know you are at the airport, the driver will wait up to 5 minutes. If you are not ready to go at that time, call the office, and they will schedule you on the next available shuttle.\n\nWhat happens if my plans change and I can’t go on the shuttle I was scheduled to ride?\n\nAs long as you call the office at least one day before your scheduled departure, you can reschedule to another date and/or time. If you don’t know when you will be able to travel, we will mark the reservation as a credit in your file. These reservations will be valid for 6 months from the original date of purchase. If the reservation is rescheduled a second time, there will be a processing fee.\n\nDo you cancel a schedule if you don’t have enough passengers?\n\nNo. We do not cancel schedules once there is a reservation. However, we reserve the right to cancel a schedule 48 hours ahead if there are no reservations on that particular shuttle.\n\nHow much luggage am I allowed to take?\n\nWe allow the same as the airlines: two suitcases and a carry on. If you will have more luggage, odd or extra large size luggage (including skis/snowboards), please contact the office for special handling. (Additional fees may be charged.)\n\nCan I bring a bicycle?\n\nYes. We just need at least 24 hours advance notice and it will be an extra $10.\n\nI see that infants are free. What is the cutoff age?\n\nInfants 24 months and younger are free. Children 25 months through 12 years are eligible for the child rate with a paid adult fare.\n\nI would like to send my minor child on the shuttle alone. Do you allow that?\n\nYes. Please indicate in the notes the age of the minor child. We also need valid contact information in case nobody shows up at the destination to meet the minor child.\n\nI have an infant that needs a car seat. Do you provide any or am I required to bring my own?\n\nDue to insurance requirements, we no longer are able to provide any type of car or booster seats. You must provide your own.\n\nWhat are the office hours?\n\nOur office is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We are closed only on Christmas and Thanksgiving.\n\nCan I pay the driver or do I have to prepay?\n\nSeats are not guaranteed until full payment has been made, however, if there is an empty seat at the departure time, you may pay the driver full fare for that seat.\n\nDo I need a ticket? There is not time for you to mail me one.\n\nNo, we use electronic ticketing. The driver will have a manifest with the name of all passengers. Check with the driver – if there is a problem, the driver will contact the office. It is helpful to print out the confirmation that will be emailed to you after you make your reservation and bring that with you for boarding.\n\nWhat is the policy on children?\n\nCustomers may choose to allow a minor (under age 18) to travel with Salt Lake Express unsupervised. However, the following is required in the reservation before it’s processed: 1. Names & phone numbers of the person dropping them off and picking them up; 2. Cell number of minor, if applicable.\n\nWhat is the policy on pets?\n\nAnimals must be in a hard carrier and remain in the carrier at all times while on the shuttle. Carriers are stowed with luggage (Back of van, in trailer, or cargo area on the bus). There is an additional $10.00 fee. Service dogs can stay with passengers.\n\nPolicies\n\nBelow is a list of all of our policies. If you still cannot find the information you’re looking for, feel free to call us for more information: (800)-356-9796.\n\nChild Policy\n\nCustomers may choose to allow a minor child, under the age of 18, to travel with the Salt Lake Express unsupervised.
