        "text": "A fantastic way to prioritize mental health while looking around and looking within this month is to visit one of the businesses located in Utah focused on mental healing and physical rejuvenation. Although not a substitute for professional help, the following suggestions may provide you with a little more than a temporary escape from daily stress.\n\n**Park City Yoga Adventures** (1743 West Fox Bay Drive, Heber City, UT 84032)\n\nJust a short drive outside Salt Lake City is Homestead Crater, a 10,000-year-old geothermal hot spring located in Heber Valley. The mineral-rich hot spring maintains a year-round temperature of 95 degrees and is an impressive 65 feet deep and 450 feet wide. Homestead Crater is the perfect place to take a therapeutic mineral soak to help loosen tense muscles and decrease stress. If you're looking for an engaging experience, Park City Yoga Adventures offers stand-up paddle board yoga before and after public hours at Homestead Crater.

While floating, there is an absence of light, of sound, and of external pressure from gravity which can help put a troubled mind and weary body at rest. The magnesium sulfate immersion can provide numerous health benefits by relieving tension in strained muscles and help alleviate soft tissue pains, including backaches and stress-induced migraines. Magnesium is highly regarded as an important chemical that the body uses to manage stress, and taking part in a float-therapy session can lower stress response, increase antioxidant production, and facilitate healing.\n\n**Rocksteady** (4689 Holladay Blvd E suite H, Holladay, UT 84117)\n\nLocated in the heart of Holladay, Rocksteady is more than just your average pilates gym, as each trainer has adopted the mission to develop well-being, character, and connection in everyone who walks through the doors.

No matter your goal, the uniquely-integrated movement practices utilized at Rocksteady will help you get there.
