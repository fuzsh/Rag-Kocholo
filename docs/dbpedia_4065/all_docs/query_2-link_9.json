The last piece of the nearly 2,900-mile-long (4,700 km) freeway to be completed was the 4.5-mile-long (7.2 km) section of I-80 between State Route 68 (SR-68, Redwood Road) and Salt Lake City International Airport, which was opened on August 22, 1986.\n\nInterstate 70\n\nInterstate 70 (I-70) is a major east-west route of the Interstate Highway System in the United States, connecting Utah and Maryland. The Utah section of I-70 runs for approximately 232 miles (373 km) across the central part of the state, with Richfield being the largest Utah city served by the freeway.\n\nUnlike most Interstate Highways, much of I-70 in Utah was not constructed parallel to or on top of an existing U.S. Route, and portions of it were built in areas where there were no paved roads. As a result, I-70 has many unique features in the Interstate Highway System. For example, the 110 miles (180 km) between Green River and Salina makes up the longest distance anywhere in the system with no motorist services.\n\nThe construction of the Utah portion of I-70 is listed as one of the engineering marvels of the Interstate Highway System. I-70 from Green River to Grand Junction, Colorado, is part of the Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway, making it one of the few Interstate Highways to be named a National Scenic Byway. The route passes through a number of scenic areas, including Arches National Park, Canyonlands National Park, and Goblin Valley State Park.\n\nInterstate 84\n\nInterstate 84 (I-84) is an important part of the Interstate Highway System that links Portland, Oregon, to I-80 near Echo, Utah. The 117.38-mile-long (188.90 km) segment in Utah is the shortest of any of the three states the western I-84 passes through and contains the eastern terminus of the highway. I-84 enters Box Elder County near Snowville before becoming concurrent with I-15 in Tremonton.\n\nThe concurrent highways travel south through Brigham City and Ogden and separate near Ogden-Hinckley Airport. The highway then turns east along the Davis County border, intersects US Route 89 (US-89), and enters Weber Canyon as well as Morgan County. While in Morgan County, I-84 passes the Devil’s Gate-Weber Hydroelectric Power Plant and Devil’s Slide rock formation.\n\nPast Morgan, the highway crosses into Summit County and reaches its eastern terminus at I-80 near Echo. Construction of the controlled-access highway began in the late 1950s under the designations Interstate 82S (I-82S) and Interstate 80N (I-80N). The highway was renumbered I-84 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in 1977. By 1986, construction of the freeway had been completed across the three states.\n\nHighways\n\nRoute 6\n\nU.S. Route 6 (US-6) is an important east-west United States Numbered Highway that runs through the central part of Utah. Although it is only about 40 miles (64 km) longer than US-50, it serves more populated areas and follows what had been US-50’s routing until it was moved to follow Interstate 70 (I-70) in 1976.\n\nIn 2009, part of the route was named the “Mike Dmitrich Highway” by the Utah State Legislature, after the Utah state senator. However, this generated controversy, as the state of Utah had previously joined with all the other states through which US-6 passes in naming all of US-6 the Grand Army of the Republic Highway.\n\nDespite the controversy, US-6 remains an important route for transportation and commerce in Utah, connecting major population centers and facilitating the movement of goods and people.\n\nRoute 40\n\nU.S. Route 40 (US-40) begins in the state of Utah at Silver Creek Junction in Silver Summit, located about 20.7 miles (33.3 km) east of Salt Lake City, where it intersects with Interstate 80. From there, the highway heads southeast through Heber City before continuing east into Colorado on its way to the Mid-Atlantic.\n\nUS-40 is an important route for transportation and commerce in Utah, connecting major population centers and facilitating the movement of goods and people. The highway passes through a variety of landscapes, from mountainous regions to desert terrain, and provides access to a number of popular recreational areas, including the Uinta Mountains and the Wasatch Mountains.\n\nRoute 50\n\nU.S. Route 50 (US-50) in Utah crosses the center of the state, serving no major population centers along its path except for Delta, which is the largest city. The majority of the route passes through remote, desolate areas. Through the eastern half of the state, the route is concurrent with Interstate 70 (I-70).\n\nUS-50 enters and exits Utah concurrently with US-6, but the two routes are separate through the center of the state. The routing of US-50 between Green River and Ely, Nevada, has changed three times, with newer roads being paved through the largely uninhabited region of both states.\n\nThe earlier routings were a result of a dispute between Utah and Nevada over which auto trails would be paved and converted to U.S. Highways. Despite its remote location and lack of major population centers, US-50 remains an important route for transportation and commerce in Utah, connecting communities and facilitating the movement of goods and people.\n\nRoute 89\n\nU.S. Route 89 (US 89) is the longest road in Utah, spanning more than 502 miles (807.891 km) through the central part of the state as a north-south United States Highway. Between Provo and Brigham City, US-89 serves as a local road, running parallel to (and occasionally concurrent with) Interstate 15. However, the portions from Arizona north to Provo and Brigham City northeast to Wyoming serve separate corridors.\n\nThe former provides access to several national parks and Arizona, while the latter connects I-15 with Logan, the state’s only Metropolitan Statistical Area not on the Interstate. When US-89 was established in Utah in 1926, the road initially extended north to US-91 in Spanish Fork. Following the extension of the former to the Canada–US border, Interstate 15 was constructed roughly paralleling US-89 to the west and replacing US-91 south of Brigham City.\n\nDuring this process, US-89 was rerouted in southern Utah and northern Arizona, with the old roadway becoming US-89A. Despite these changes, US-89 remains an important route for transportation and commerce in Utah, connecting communities and providing access to scenic areas and national parks.\n\nRoute 91\n\nU.S. Route 91 (US 91) begins at Brigham City, where it was originally routed through the city but now runs on a southern bypass. In Brigham City, US 89 becomes concurrent with US 91. The highway climbs the Wellsville Mountains, colloquially called “Sardine Canyon” after the canyon originally used by the first settlers to mark a trail to Cache Valley.\n\nA new route was constructed in the 1950s that uses the same mountain pass, Sardine Summit, as the old road, but follows different canyons down from the summit. Despite the modern route of US 91 no longer using Sardine Canyon, the name continues to be used by locals and news media alike in describing the traffic, weather conditions, or scenery along the entire grade across the Wellsville Mountains.\n\nUS 91 enters the Cache Valley, where it serves as the major thoroughfare, passing through Logan, the largest city in the valley. At Logan, US 89 splits off to the east towards Bear Lake, while US 91 continues north through the valley to the Idaho state line. The Utah section of US 91 is defined by Utah Code Annotated § 72-4-115(1) and the segment south of the SR-142 intersection in Richmond is included in the National Highway System.\n\nRoute 163\n\nU.S. Route 163 (US 163) in Utah begins in Monument Valley, San Juan County, where it junctions with the Monument Valley Visitors Center. After entering Utah, the highway proceeds northeast until the town of Mexican Hat, where it crosses the San Juan River and exits the Navajo Nation. From Mexican Hat, the highway travels east, crossing the Comb Ridge toward its terminus in Bluff.\n\nA significant portion of the Utah section of the route north of the Navajo Nation is inside the boundaries of the Bears Ears National Monument. The former route continued along what is now signed US 191 to I-70, but the portion north of Bluff was not signed after the creation of US 191 and was formally removed in 2008.\n\nThe length of US 163 in Utah has been designated the Bluff to Monument Valley Scenic Byway by the Utah State Legislature and forms part of the Trail of the Ancients National Scenic Byway. US 163 has been featured in numerous western movies, and a specific view area near Utah mile marker 13 has recently been given the nickname Forrest Gump Hill, as a location from the movie Forrest Gump. It has become common for fans of the film to recreate the scene where the title character ends a cross-country jog at this point on US 163.\n\nRoute 189\n\nU.S. Route 189 (US-189) begins in Provo as University Avenue, named after Brigham Young University. The highway winds up Provo Canyon, passing by Deer Creek Reservoir and paralleling the route of the Heber Creeper, which is now known as the Heber Valley Railroad.\n\nThe portion in Provo Canyon is designated the Provo Canyon Scenic Byway by the state legislature. The highway exits Provo Canyon near Heber City, where it meets U.S. Route 40 and is co-signed with Route 40 all the way to its junction with I-80. Prior to the construction of the Jordanelle Reservoir, the highway continued north concurrently with the former alignment of US-40 which is now underwater.\n\nUS-40 and 189 separated at Hailstone, which is also now under the lake. US-189 emerged from the lake shore along the route now signed State Route 32. The Utah section of US-189 is defined in Utah Code Annotated § 72-4-124(2). The highway has played an important role in connecting communities and facilitating the movement of goods and people in Utah.\n\nRoute 191\n\nU.S. Route 191 (US-191) is a major 404.168-mile (650.445 km) north-south U.S. Numbered Highway through eastern Utah, stretching from Mexico to Canada. The current alignment of US-191 through Utah was created in 1981. Previously, the route had entered northern Utah, ending at US-91 in Brigham City, but with the completion of I-15, it was truncated to Yellowstone National Park and re-extended on a completely different alignment.\n\nIn addition to a large portion of US-163, this extension absorbed several state routes, including SR-33, most of SR-44, and SR-260. US-191 plays a key role in connecting communities and providing access to scenic areas and national parks in eastern Utah. The highway passes through several towns, including Moab, Blanding, and Monticello, and provides access to Canyonlands National Park, Arches National Park, and the Needles District of Canyonlands National Park.\n\nRoute 491\n\nU.S. Route 491 (US-491) gradually ascends to the Abajo Mountains once it enters Utah. The highway passes through large farming regions and reaches an elevation of 7,000 feet (2,100 m) before arriving at a weigh station and the town of Monticello.\n\nUS-491 enters Monticello on Central Street and terminates near the city park at an intersection with US-191, which runs along Main Street. The highway has played a vital role in connecting communities and facilitating the movement of goods and people in southeastern Utah. All highways in Utah are codified into law, and US-491 is defined in Utah Code Annotated §72-4-137(11)."
