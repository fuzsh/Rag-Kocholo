        "text": "Water Quality in the State of Utah\n\nWater quality in Utah is governed by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality. Utah gets the majority of its water from the Valley-Fill, Cache Valley, and Cedar Valley Aquifers. Watersheds supplying Utah residents with drinking water are City Creek, Parleys, Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons. Water in Utah is considered to be very hard. People across the state must deal with hard water daily. The state average is right around 298 PPM.\n\nUtah Water Hardness by City\n\nThe largest city and state capital, Salt Lake City, has the lowest water hardness with 158 PPM. The next largest city in Utah is West Valley City which has hard water at a level of 230 PPM. Close to the State average water hardness of 340 PPM is the city of St. George with a water hardness of 342 PPM. The hardest water can be found in cities like Blanding, with 598 PPM, and Riverton with 574 PPM.\n\nFor more information on the water hardness in specific cities, please see the table below.\n\nWhat is the water hardness in my area?\n\nCityWater Hardness Data\n\nAlpine\n\n84004\n\n359 PPM (mg/L) or 21 gpg\n\nAmerican Fork\n\n84003\n\n257 PPM (mg/L) or 15 gpg\n\nBlanding\n\n84511\n\n598 PPM (mg/L) or 35 gpg\n\nBountiful\n\n84010\n\n513 PPM (mg/L) or 38 gpg\n\nBrigham City\n\n84720 | 84721\n\n325 PPM (mg/L) or 9 gpg\n\nCedar City\n\n84720 | 84721\n\n417 PPM (mg/L) or 27 gpg\n\nCoalville\n\n84017\n\n325 PPM (mg/L) or 19 gpg\n\nDraper\n\n84020\n\n357 PPM (mg/L) or 21 gpg\n\nEagle Mountain\n\n84005\n\n323 PPM (mg/L) or 9 gpg\n\nEphraim\n\n84627\n\n517 PPM (mg/L) or 30 gpg\n\nGoshen\n\n84633\n\n462 PPM (mg/L) or 27 gpg\n\nHerriman\n\n84096\n\n359 PPM (mg/L) or 21 gpg\n\nHurricane\n\n84737\n\n393 PPM (mg/L) or 15 gpg\n\nLayton\n\n84040 | 84041\n\n352 PPM (mg/L) or 21 gpg\n\nLehi\n\n84043\n\n200 PPM (mg/L) or 11 gpg\n\nLogan\n\n84321 | 84341\n\n255 PPM (mg/L) or 15 gpg\n\nManti\n\n84642\n\n221 PPM (mg/L) or 13 gpg\n\nMapleton\n\n84664\n\n393 PPM (mg/L) or 23gpg\n\nMeadow\n\n84325\n\n496 PPM (mg/L) or 29 gpg\n\nMorgan\n\n84050\n\n513 PPM (mg/L) or 30 gpg\n\nMidvale\n\n84047\n\n327 PPM (mg/L) or 19 gpg\n\nOgden\n\n84404 | 84401 | 84403 | 84405\n\n170 PPM (mg/L) or 10 gpg\n\nOrem\n\n84057 | 84058 | 84097\n\n301 PPM (mg/L) or 18 gpg\n\nPark City\n\n84060 | 84098\n\n444 PPM (mg/L) or 26 gpg\n\nPayson\n\n84651\n\n428 PPM (mg/L) or 25 gpg\n\nPleasant Grove\n\n84062\n\n359 PPM (mg/L) or 21 gpg\n\nProvo\n\n84604 | 84606 | 84601\n\n164 PPM (mg/L) or 9 gpg\n\nRiverton\n\n84065\n\n574 PPM (mg/L) or 34 gpg\n\nRoy\n\n84067\n\n384 PPM (mg/L) or 22 gpg\n\nSalem\n\n84653\n\n324 PPM (mg/L) or 19 gpg\n\nSalt Lake City\n\n84118 | 84121 | 84123 | 84106 | 84116 | 84107 | 84115 | 84104 | 84117 | 84109 | 84105 | 84108 | 84124 | 84103 | 84102 | 84111 | 84101 | 84112 | 84113 | 84180\n\n210 PPM (mg/L) or 12 gpg\n\nSandy\n\n84070 | 84092 | 84093 | 84094\n\n308 PPM (mg/L) or 18 gpg\n\nSantaquin\n\n84655\n\n428 PPM (mg/L) or 25 gpg\n\nSaratoga Springs\n\n84045\n\n376 PPM (mg/L) or 22 gpg\n\nSouth Jordan\n\n84095\n\n146 PPM (mg/L) or 8 gpg\n\nSpanish Fork\n\n84660\n\n427 PPM (mg/L) or 25 gpg\n\nSpringville\n\n84663\n\n393 PPM (mg/L) or 23 gpg\n\nSt. George\n\n84770 | 84790\n\n342 PPM (mg/L) or 20 gpg\n\nTooele\n\n84074\n\n310 PPM (mg/L) or 18 gpg\n\nVernal\n\n84078\n\n410 PPM (mg/L) or 24 gpg\n\nWashington City\n\n84780\n\n516 PPM (mg/L) or 30 gpg\n\nWest Jordan\n\n84084 | 84088\n\n148 PPM (mg/L) or 8 gpg\n\nWest Valley City\n\n84119 | 84120 | 84128\n\n230 PPM (mg/L) or 13 gpg\n\nWoods Cross\n\n84087\n\n342 PPM (mg/L) or 20 gpg\n\nPPM = Parts Per Million\n\nmg/L = Milligrams Per Liter\n\ngpg = Grains Per Gallon\n\nManufacturing and Water Hardness\n\nUtah has been moving up the ranks as a leading state for manufacturing, bringing in more than 20 billion per year. Utah's top manufacturing industries are computer and electronic products, aerospace technology, and metal manufacturing. Product processing in most manufacturing plants requires water. Cooling towers and HVAC are imperative to keeping operations running smoothly. Water hardness levels can be as high as 1,000 PPM; with water hardness levels this high, manufacturing equipment can deteriorate at a rapid pace and experience efficiency loss. Mining is also a significant contributor to Utah's growing economy. The mining sector in Utah consumes significant amounts of water that can be as hard as 15,000 PPM.\n\nSolutions to your Water Quality Problems\n\nFixing your water quality issues in the state of Utah will depend on your specific water source. It is best to test your potable water supply in order to get a better understanding of your water quality. Testing is relatively cheap. The test results will allow you to understand if your potable water has issues that need to be addressed. Common solutions to water contamination problems may include a water filtration system, a reverse osmosis system, or other whole-home water treatment solutions.\n\nA problem that almost all Utah residents will have to deal with is hard water. Salt Lake City is the most populous city has a water hardness of 158 PPM making finding a solution for the majority of the residents very important. One old-fashioned, inefficient, expensive, and unhealthy method to treat hard water is with a salt-based water softener. Most people don’t realize that if you’re using a water softener, you are basically removing calcium and magnesium from your drinking water and adding salt to your diet. In addition, many states are banning the use of salt-based water softeners."
