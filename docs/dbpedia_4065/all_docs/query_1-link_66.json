        "text": "Want to make dirt bike riding at night as much fun as mid day? Our favorite light is the Thumper Jockey MegaLight. It's small, brighter than most stock headlights and consumes half the power. Thumper Jockey makes some of the best off road LED lights for motorcycles.\n\nFor more information or to buy check out our friends at thumperjockey.com\n\nDifficulty: 4 of 5\n\nMiles: 25+\n\nFrancis is located North East of Heber Utah. This is one of our favorite dirt bike trails. Nobody really knows about this little piece of heaven. Maybe because it's off the beaten trail. It definitely isn't ridden much. The single track trail is marked well and pretty easy to follow for the most part. There are multiple tricky switch backs and slick rocky spots which add some difficulty to the trail.\n\nThe trail works best if you ride it in a counter clockwise direction. There a couple deep stream crossing (depending on the time of year) that make the rocky sections slippery and more difficult. You'll have to ride a couple miles of dirt road to connect the single track but its worth it.\n\nDirections:\n\nFrom Heber City head north on Main Street/ hwy 189 for about 3 miles. Turn right onto hwy 32 for 10 miles to Francis. Continue west on hwy 34 for 10 miles. Turn right onto a dirt road. Follow the dirt road for 3/4 mile.\n\nMap:\n\nwoodland.pdfFile Size: 3324 kbFile Type: pdf\n\nDownload File\n\nGoogle Earth:\n\nwoodland.kmlFile Size: 90 kbFile Type: kml\n\nDownload File\n\nGPX:\n\nwoodland.gpxFile Size: 154 kbFile Type: gpx\n\nDownload File"
