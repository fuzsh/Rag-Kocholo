        "text": "I'm interested in what route to take between Denver, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah, and vice-versa.\n\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?q=Denver,+CO++to++Salt+Lake+City,+UT\n\nIt would seem like there is one northern option and two southern options.\n\nIn the north, I-25 in Colorado to Wyoming, and then I-80 throughout Wyoming and into Utah.\n\nIn the south, I-70 in Colorado, then\n\neither SH 13 and SH 64 in Colorado, and US-40 in Utah,\n\nor, more I-70 / US-50, through Grand Junction, CO, and US-6 in Utah.\n\nWhat's the difference between these ways, and which one is better, or best avoided? I'm driving in the summer (June 2013); interested in a short route; a little scenery wouldn't hurt; too much engine and tyre wear, bad roads and bad fuel economy is best avoided (driving own car), but high highway speeds are welcome; planning to drive in one or two days, possibly stopping along the highway to get some sleep (spots with night temperatures of around 20Â°C are welcome, and so are spots where you can get some shade during the daytime). Also, last, but not least, it wouldn't hurt if the route has some T-Mobile USA UMTS, EDGE or GPRS coverage (without classified as roaming).\n\nAs far as Google Maps go, it seems like all three routes are roughly the same, in both the time and the distance, so, looking for some more feedback. For DEN&lrarr;SLC, I've so far taken I-80 once when eastbound and I-70 w/ US-6 once when westbound (I've only had one SLC&lrarr;DEN trip)."
