LAWRENCE MASS SCHEDULE\n\nHOLYDAY OF OBLIGATION (AUGUST 15)\n\nThu, 8/15 at 9:30 AM - English\n\nThu, 8/15 at 6:00 PM - Spanish\n\nFor Mass times at St. Mary's, please click HERE.\n\ngive now sign up for updates\n\nCHILDREN'S FAITH FORMATION\n\nFaith Formation is a life-long process. St. Lawrence offers formal faith formation for the children of our Church from Kindergarten through 9th grade with curriculum that is grade specific.\n\nThis program is not exclusively a sacrament preparation program; it is only one component of your child's faith formation. Your child is not fully formed in their faith by only attending Sacrament Preparation.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact DRE Andreina Payan at andreina.stlawrence@gmail.com.\n\nAndreina's office hours are:\n\nMON: 10 AM - 1 PM\n\nTUE: 10 AM - 1 PM\n\nFRI: 10 AM - 1 PM\n\nRegistration for the 2024-25 St. Lawrence Religious Ed year is now open! Classes will begin on September 29. Please register your children by filling out the form in the back of the church or found below and placing it in the drop-off box in the church. Religious Ed is free though donations are encouraged to support this important mission. Thank you!\n\nClass dates CONFIRMATION CALENDAR (YEAR 1)\n\nNIGHT AT THE MISSION\n\nNight at the Mission: Join us at St. Lawrence once a month to hear a guest speaker and socialize. Please bring an appetizer, dessert, or drink to share.\n\nThursday, July 25th at 6:30 PM with Devin Halford.\n\n“Encountering and Loving the ‘Least’ Among Us”\n\nWe all know the experience. We see the homeless man or woman on the street, by the store door, or in the same room as us—and we panic, or ignore, or become irritated. But deep down we all know that we would love to help that man or woman. Well, how? There’s no one-size-fit answer to it all. But perhaps there’s an approach we easily overlook or have never thought of. Come and listen to Devin Halford’s story of the past two years, of becoming friends with the homeless in Denver and Philadelphia. Come and see how the apostolate he served for addresses poverty and how you can integrate some of the approach into your everyday life. Note: Due to the church painting, the talk and social gathering will be held at St. Lawrence downstairs in the large classroom.\n\nKNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS\n\nInterested in the Knights of Columbus? Join local knights for their monthly meeting at St. Lawrence. Knights meet at 6:30 PM every third Wednesday of the month.\n\nMUSICIANS, CANTORS, AND LITURGICAL MINISTERS\n\nCan you carry a tune or play an instrument? Then the choir needs you! Both the Saturday evening 5:00 PM Mass and the Sunday 10:00 AM Mass are seeking additional members. Those interested should contact Christina Hemphill at (303)-881-3547. Thank you. St. Lawrence is also recruiting again for Eucharistic Ministers and Lectors. Those interested should contact Rachel LeMelle at rachel.stlawrence@gmail.com."
