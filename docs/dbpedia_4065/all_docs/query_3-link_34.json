Share it with others!\n\nA complete list of all the hot springs in Utah map, information, and camping too.\n\nAfter exploring Southern Idaho for a month and visiting loads of hot springs, we thought our hot spring journey was coming to an end. Low and behold, there are some fantastic hot springs in Utah! We visited five different hot springs in Utah, each unique in their own way.\n\nAfter visiting five of the twelve Utah hot springs, we created a hot springs in Utah map for you to use and enjoy for soaking in Utah. We kept to free, natural hot springs in Utah, though have included all the other hot springs in Utah we’ve researched as well. This post is separated by free hot springs in Utah and paid for hot springs in Utah. And the hot springs in Utah map also is broken down the same way.\n\nHot Spring Etiquette in Utah\n\nCan I bring my dogs to the hot springs?\n\nIn short, there are no rules about bringing dogs to any of the free hot springs in Utah that we visited. And we actually saw people with dogs at each of the five Utah hot springs. With that said, most of the people we saw were EXTREMELY DISRESPECTFUL with their dogs. I’m talking letting their dogs jump in and out of the hot springs splashing other people in them. People were playing fetch with their dogs by throwing stuff into pools other people we soaking in. Dogs were running all over personal belongings. And poop bags left behind.\n\nErg.. it aggravates me just thinking about it all. If you choose to bring your dog to a hot spring be respectful of those around you soaking without a dog. Not everyone is a dog person. In fact, hard to believe I know (joke).. some people have allergies to dogs and others have been bit or attacked by a dog and are afraid of dogs… so put your dog on a freaking leash and keep it to yourself.\n\nAnd NO.. people do not want to share a hot spring with your dog. Just no.. it’s not cute. And it’s not okay.\n\nCan I soak nude at the hot springs?\n\nYou are allowed to soak in the Utah hot springs nude, however, it’s fairly uncommon. There is a heavy mormon population in all of Utah, and most Mormons aren’t comfortable being nude or seeing others nude. So you won’t find many nude bathers, though we did see a few.\n\nIs music okay at the hot springs?\n\nAgain, no real rule about having music or not at the hot springs, but it’s more about respecting others here than anything else. As a general rule of thumb, people go to hot springs to soak and relax in nature, and do so without music. So when you bring your music and everyone can hear, it kind of ruins the mood for other’s soaking.\n\nBe respectful of those around you, if there are people soaking and they’re not listening to music, don’t get there and turn yours on. Wait until you’re by yourself.\n\nWhat kind of food and drink can I bring?\n\nAs is the case at most hot springs around the world, glass is not an acceptable option for drinks at a hot spring. Broken glass does not mix well with bare feet and buns.\n\nAlcohol is also not allowed at most hot springs in Utah, or at least the ones that are more done up than say ones like Baker Hot Spring. You’ll find it illegal to have alcohol, one because of the high mormon population, but two, because alcohol and hot water don’t mix well and multiple people have passed out drunk in hot springs and died.\n\nOther than glass and alcohol, anything is fair game. We recommend a bottle like this to keep your drinks cold while you soak. And we always recommend bringing more water than you think you’ll need. It’s surprising how dehydrated a hot spring will make you!\n\nPack out whatever you pack in with you. That means all snack trash and even composting fruit peels too!\n\nWhere do I use the bathroom?\n\nMost Utah hot springs on this list do not have toilets at them. You’ll have to do your duty in nature or bring a toilet like this with you. If you plan on being at the hot spring for a long time, you can bring a pop-up changing tent and throw this toilet in there. Otherwise, you’ll be using a trowel and digging a hole.\n\nPlease remember, when going the bathroom in nature, do so only when 200 feet away from a water source, and be sure to dig a hole six inches deep. Also remember, do not leave your toilet paper behind. Poop and pee are the only things that go in the hole you dig. Toilet paper and feminine hygiene products get carried back out with you to a proper trash can.\n\nREAD MORE | Looking for van or car camping toilets? Check out this post of toilet ideas for life on the road.\n\nLarge groups and parties at the hot springs?\n\nAgain, back to the respect issue here. If you’re respectful of those around you, why not go with friends? Maybe not the best idea to go with crowds of over ten people to any of these hot springs, but other than that sure. We had to leave Inlet Hot Springs on two different occasions from there being two huge groups, like 20-30 college and high school students throwing glow sticks in the water, blasting music, and literally pushing out others from the hot springs.\n\nDon’t be those people. Keep your group small so everyone can enjoy their time soaking in the hot springs.\n\nHot Springs in Utah\n\nBefore diving into the Utah hot springs, a quick note. Help keep these places open and beautiful! Stay on the paths. Only park in the designated parking areas. And, for the love of nature… pack out all trash! You carried it in.. carry it out!\n\nHere’s a quick list of the individual hot springs.. yes, they really are all hot springs in Utah.\n\nFifth Water Hot Springs (Diamond Fork Hot Springs)\n\nInlet Park Hot Springs (Saratoga Springs)\n\nBaker Hot Springs\n\nRed Hill Hot Springs\n\nMeadow Hot Springs\n\nGandy Warm Springs\n\nOgden River Hot Springs\n\nHorseshoe Springs\n\nOld Indian Hot Spring\n\nMystic Hot Springs\n\nCrystal Hot Springs\n\nHomestead Crater Hot Springs\n\nHot Springs in Utah Map\n\nThis is a complete hot springs in Utah map. It has all 11 of the hot springs in Utah, pinned in the exact coordinates. Below this hot springs in Utah map, I’ll be going into detail of each hot spring, and sharing personal experiences of the hot springs we visited.\n\nFree Hot Springs in Utah\n\nFifth Water Hot Springs (Diamond Fork Hot Springs)\n\nLocation: Near Provo, Utah\n\nTemperature: ranging from hot to cold, depending on pool.\n\nAccess: 2.5 mile hike\n\nTexture: large rocks, small rocks, silt\n\nDepth: all different depths, most are comfortable to sit in up to mid stomach\n\nOur first thought when we got to Fifth Water Hot Springs, also known as Diamond Fork, was how on earth did we not visit this place when we were living in Provo. It’s a rather easy 2.5 mile hike to the hot springs up a creek. At the source of the springs, there are loads of pools to choose from.\n\nWhen we visited Fifth Water, we camped nearby and arrived mid-morning to a rather full parking lot. But that was nothing compared to how full it was when we left! This is a very popular hot spring, and for good reason.\n\nFifth Water Hot Spring is a cascading waterfall hot spring with more than twenty different pools to soak in. Even with a completely full parking lot, we were able to have a few pools to ourselves. We did share the main waterfall pool with a group of kids for a short time. But for the most part, it seems there are plenty of pools for everyone to enjoy.\n\nThe colors, the scenery, and the sheer amount of pools is a sight to see at Fifth Water Hot Springs.\n\nREAD MORE | Everything You Need to Know About Hiking at Soaking at Fifth Water\n\nInlet Park Hot Springs (Saratoga Springs Utah)\n\nLocation: Utah Lake (Saratoga, Utah)\n\nTemperature: ranges from cold to warm (not really hot hot) at the source\n\nAccess: 1/4 mile flat walk from parking lot\n\nTexture: silty\n\nDepth: 1-2 feet\n\nSaratoga Springs Hot Spring (Inlet Hot Spring) is right on the edge of Utah Lake near Saratoga, Utah. The park itself has a playground, soccer fields, walking trails, and seasonal bathrooms. With the easy access to the hot spring and the warm, but not too hot temperatures, you can almost guarantee you’ll be sharing this hot spring with multiple other people.\n\nWe went to Inlet Park Hot Spring, aka, Saratoga Springs, a number of times. The first two times we went at night, and that was a huge mistake. There was huge groups of people there, as in almost too many to get in the hot springs. Early in the evening it was full of families with kids jumping in the water and swimming and splashing everyone else in it. Once the families left, in came the large groups of high school and college students. We’re talking 20-30 students in the groups.\n\nThe last time we went, we visited mid-morning on a weekday, and that was the perfect time. We shared the hot spring with not a single other soul, and it was a truly relaxing and enjoyable soak.\n\nIf planning to visit Inlet Hot Springs, try and plan your visit during the weekday, and not too late in the evening. This way, you’ll likely not have to share the one big hot spring pool with loads of others.\n\nInlet Park Hot Springs is open year-round, however, is closed from 10 pm to 7 am .. and there’s a police station nearby that supposedly checks on the springs often, so do make sure you mind the opening times.\n\nREAD MORE | the dos and don’ts of Inlet Hot Spring + where to camp nearby\n\nBaker Hot Springs Utah\n\nLocation: near Delta, Utah\n\nTemperature: piping hot to freezing cold, each pool’s temperature is regulated by the user\n\nAccess: well maintained dirt road, drive right up to springs\n\nTexture: cement tubs\n\nDepth: 3+ feet deep tubs\n\nOh my lanta. Baker Hot Springs are hot springs I still dream about. We camped at Baker Hot Springs for a week, and loved nearly every minute of it. There are natural hot springs that are fenced in on private property that look really cool, and then there are three different cement pools for people to soak in.\n\nWe talked to a number of people while at Baker Hot Springs, and everyone had a different story as to how the cement pools actually got there. Regardless, they’re epic. The water coming from the hot spring source is burning hot, way too hot to get in by itself. However, there is a cold spring near by too, and that water is piped to each individual hot spring tub.\n\nTo regulate the water temperature, there are old rags that you use to dam up the hot water, or clog the cold water pipe. It’s easy engineering at it’s finest!\n\nThere are no trash services or toilets here, so pack out what you pack in, and if you have to go the bathroom at the springs, be sure to follow these pooping outdoors rules, or bring along a portable car toilet with you to the hot springs.\n\nAnd please, don’t bring large groups to these hot springs. Everyone we saw there was in just groups of two. That’s about as many people as can comfortably fit in each of the hot spring tubs, so to make sure it’s enjoyable for everyone, keep your group small.\n\nREAD MORE | wild camping + soaking at Baker Hot Springs\n\nRed Hills Hot Springs\n\nLocation: Monroe, Utah\n\nTemperature: four pools ranging from burning hot to just above too cold\n\nAccess: drive up dirt road within feet of them\n\nTexture: red clay and dirt\n\nDepth: mid stomach when sitting\n\nRed Hills Hot Springs is tucked in a hill with beautiful red hot springs formations and great views of the town of Monroe and surrounding areas. Accessing these hot springs is done by simply driving up a well maintained dirt road right in the center of Monroe. There’s a pit toilet, trash, and a decent size parking lot for day use.\n\nThis hot spring is maintained by the city of Monroe, and the workers there are very proud of this place. They’re working on creating more pools to soak in, though the newest addition hasn’t been able to stay very hot. The hot springs close at 10 pm, and while there is no camping at the hot springs themselves, the area near the hot springs is BLM land, and you’re free to camp on that.\n\nLife at Red Hills Hot Spring\n\nRed Hill Hot Spring is unlike the other hot springs in Utah, as it has actual hot spring thermophiles and life. With that being the case, please do not walk on the hills of the hot spring. There’s a path up behind the parking lot that leads to a paved lookout at the top, that’s worth seeing, along with a secret super hot pool to sit in called the Lobster Pot. The source of the hot spring is fenced in because people have literally died by falling into the boiling hot water, so don’t try and climb the fence. And, do not walk on or carve things into the active hot spring hill. This damages the hillside, and ruins the hot spring and the life it brings.\n\nREAD MORE | camping and soaking at Red Hill Hot Spring + another hot spring nearby\n\nMeadow Hot Springs Utah\n\nLocation: Meadow, Utah\n\nTemperature: 90s .. not really great for winter\n\nAccess: dirt road to large parking area, then short walk to most popular spring, drive up access available at other springs\n\nTexture: cave walls, ledges, and smooth rocks in some\n\nDepth: unknown, they’re actually caves\n\nThis is easily one of the most popular hot springs in Utah. Instagram has made Meadow Hot Spring really blow up. And upon getting there, it’s easy to see why.\n\nMeadow Hot Spring is a link of three different cave hot springs, all connected underground. There are warm water fish in the hot springs, and you really feel like you’re in a tropical location when in the water. Being outside of the water in the winter is a whole different story, as the water really isn’t hot instead just warm… so it’s truly not a relaxing hot spring get really hot kind of place. You can sit in the hot springs for hours and not get too hot.\n\nBring your goggles to Meadow, as you can swim down into the caves looking for fish and even people’s lost jewelry. A word of caution here though, hold onto the given rope. People have gotten lost diving into the caves and have drowned.\n\nThese are technically privately owned hot springs with a donation box for those who want to give back to the landowners. Be respectful at these hot springs and only park and drive in the designated areas. Don’t ruin it for everyone else by destroying the land surrounding the hot springs. And seriously, don’t be those people trying to 4×4 around the muddy grounds. We heard numerous stories of tow trucks being called out to help people stuck in the bottomless mud pits.\n\nREAD MORE | all the rave of Meadow Hot Springs + where to camp + things to avoid\n\nGandy Warm Spring\n\nLocation: boarder of Nevada and Utah\n\nTemperature: warm, not hot\n\nAccess: dirt road, drive-able to springs\n\nTexture: rock pebbles\n\nDepth: 1-2 feet\n\nWe didn’t visit this spring, so we can’t say much about it other than what we’ve read. Gandy Warm Spring is in fact a warm spring, not a hot spring, meaning the water temperature is right in the 70s. Some pictures of it look awesome and like a true oasis, others look like it’s a simple pool of water.\n\nBut the thing that stands out the most about Gandy Warm Spring is the cave like entry to a covered relaxing area. Again, we haven’t been before, so we can’t vouch for accessing the cave and the safety of it, but the exterior of the cave looks great too!\n\nOgden River Hot Springs\n\nLocation: Ogden, Utah\n\nTemperature: said to be up to 104 and down to cold\n\nAccess: not 100% sure, but a wee hike I believe\n\nTexture: from the pictures, looks like rocky bottoms\n\nDepth: varying with different pools\n\nRumor has it that Ogden River Hot Springs are actually currently closed, but as we didn’t visit these hot springs, we aren’t sure that’s true or not… so we’re including it on this list. There’s so much mixed information about Ogden River Hot Springs, that we are making it a must to get to them when we do return to Utah.\n\nYou may or may not have to cross a river to get to them. They may or may not be destroyed. They might be fenced in on private property.. Honestly, you’ll read all varying ideas of this place both recently published and in the past. So you really truly have to visit it to see what the Ogden River Hot Springs are all about.\n\nAgain, since we didn’t visit, we aren’t sure about them, however, wanted to include them in this list, just in case they are legit. If you do visit the Ogden River Hot Springs, let us know, so we can update this post!\n\nHorseshoe Springs\n\nLocation: west of Salt Lake City\n\nTemperature: warm springs, not hot\n\nAccess: seems difficult and 4 x 4 needed\n\nTexture: unknown\n\nDepth: unkown\n\nWe did not make the trip out to this hot spring while visiting Utah. However, again, wanted to include it in this list for those looking to explore all the hot springs in Utah. Most of the reviews online of Horseshoe Springs talk about walking around the spring and fishing, and only a few mention actually swimming in the water. So, no 100% sure what kind hot/warm spring this actually is.\n\nAs with the other two places above that we didn’t visit, we’d love to hear from you if you visit Horseshoe Springs! Let us know if it’s a place for a good dip, or really just a natural reserve.\n\nOld Indian Hot Springs (Stinky Springs)\n\nLocation: north of Salt Lake\n\nTemperature:\n\nAccess: drive up to tubs\n\nTexture: cement built up tubs\n\nDepth: 2-3 feet cement tubs\n\nWe heard of two people talking about this hot spring. And both said how terrible the smell was, but that they enjoyed the soak. Again, one of the hot springs in Utah on the map we didn’t visit. This hot springs seems a bit more run down and in the middle of nowhere, but it seems like an adventure nonetheless.\n\nWith the smell of these hot springs, there’s no doubt there’s some true mineral water in them!\n\nPaid for Hot Spring Resorts in Utah\n\nWe aren’t very into visiting paid for hot springs, especially when there are so many awesome free hot springs in Utah. So we didn’t visit any of these three commercial hot springs in Utah. However, each of them seems super unique and enjoyable in its own way.\n\nMystic Hot Springs\n\nLocation: Monroe, Utah\n\nTemperature: varies between 99F-110F from tub to tub\n\nAccess: park and stay on site\n\nTexture: actual bathtubs\n\nDepth: bathtub soaking\n\nPrice: $25 for two hours\n\nWebsite: Mystic Hot Springs\n\nMystic Hot Springs is a very earth and art center hot spring. You can camp on-site, rent buses and cabins to stay in, and enjoy a two-hour soak for $25 per person. Their website states that, “Mystic Hot Springs creates an authentic environment which raises self-awareness by direct experience with nature, art, and antiquities.”\n\nWe didn’t find it worthwhile to pay $25 per person to soak in a bathtub when there are free hot springs nearby, I think from the same hot water source. However, to each their own. Loads of people post photo after photo of the place, making it a very famous hot spring in Utah, thanks to its picture-perfect hot spring tubs and formations.\n\nYou must book a time slot to soak at Mystic Hot Springs, which can be done through their website here.\n\nCrystal Hot Springs\n\nLocation: Honeyville, Utah\n\nTemperature: loads of varying temperature pools\n\nAccess: resort style hot spring\n\nTexture: proper built up pool\n\nDepth: Olympic pool, water slides, and more\n\nPrice: $18 per day\n\nWebsite: Crystal Hot Springs\n\nCrystal Hot Springs is really a water park more than just a hot spring. It has multiple different pools, ranging from soaking pools to Olympic sized swimming pools. There are water slides, water features, snack shacks and more. It’s a bit expensive for a hot spring, but it’s a great option for a day out as a family!\n\nThe website is a bit shady, however, we’ve heard many people talk about this place when we were in Utah and in Idaho as well, so we reckon it’s okay! If in doubt, just purchase tickets on site. Do be mindful of the hours, and pay attention to special pricing for families and groups!\n\nHomestead Crater Hot Springs\n\nLocation: Midway, Utah\n\nTemperature: 90F-96F degrees\n\nAccess: Resort style hot spring\n\nTexture: huge crater dome\n\nDepth: 65 feet, can scuba dive here\n\nPrice: $15-$18 for 40 minutes\n\nWebsite: Homestead Resort\n\nOkay, this place seems super cool, but we couldn’t justify the price of visiting this hot spring. However, now that we’re of Utah, we’re kinda wishing we had spent the money just to experience the dome.\n\nHomestead Crater is a hot spring inside a 55 foot tall dome, that you can swim, snorkel, and even learn to scuba dive in. It’s on a farm and has been extremely commercialized, but is extremely unique in the sense of it is an actual dome hot spring! Head to their website for more information on this hot spring and the different ways you can experience the dome.\n\nRead Next…\n\nHow to Capture Killer Photos in Bryce Canyon\n\nOur Time in Bryce Canyon National Park\n\nDriving from Zion National Park to Bryce Canyon\n\nTwo Days in Zion National Park\n\nArches National Park in 24 Hours\n\nCanyonlands National Park\n\nCapitol Reef National Park\n\nOur Favorite Hot Spring in Idaho\n\nFive Hot Springs in Stanley, Idaho\n\nLike it?
