And if you’re looking to get moving by foot, bike, boat, ski, snowmobile, train, or zipline, the Heber Valley is the place to go. Seriously, go do everything without compromising. There’s no need to choose when you can zipline across a lake on one end of the Valley and bike over rugged mountain slopes on the other. Go from adventure to adventure, and then head back for some small-town charm. Cap the day with an award-winning meal and talk about getting back out there tomorrow.\n\nThe place is right. The space is here. Give it a go."
