        "text": "Utahâ€™s population of over 3 million people makes it the 31st most populous state in the U.S. Salt Lake City, the capital of Utah, is the most populated with a count of 192,672 according to 2017 estimates. There are three other cities that have populations of more than 100,000: West Valley City, Provo and West Jordan. There are 54 cities in Utah with populations between 10,000 and 100,000.\n\nIn total, there are 243 incorporated municipalities in this state. These are categorized as cities or towns based on population. Areas with populations under 1,000 people are towns, while those with more than 1,000 are cities. Other than the number of people residing in each town, there are no legal distinctions between cities and towns. All cities and towns must adopt a municipal charter which outlines the authority granted to each. The smallest incorporated municipality, which is classified as a town based on its population, is Scofield in Carbon County, which has a population of just 24 people. The smallest municipality classified as a city is Aurora in Sevier County, which has a population of 1,016 inhabitants."
