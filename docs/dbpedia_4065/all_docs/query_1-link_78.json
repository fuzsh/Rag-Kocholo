        "text": "Summer Youth Camping Sessions\n\nWe have 2 youth sessions per week. First session is a Monday morning check-in, 7-9am and a Thurs check-out 7-9am. It will be available for Stake and Ward YW camps. Second session is a Thursday check-in 11:30 am -1:00 pm and a Saturday check out between 1-3 pm. This session won’t be available for YW stakes but it will be available for Youth Conferences and YW Wards.\n\nAll youth groups will need to get on one of our waiting lists. See the buttons below. A Heber Valley Camp reservation specialist will contact you and discuss options for a reservation within a couple of weeks. They will then guide you through the process of making a reservation.\n\nWard Waiting List Helps\n\nEach cabin has 16 beds (8 bunk beds) and fire regulations allow us to sleep 4 on the floor, if we don’t have cots. You can still have a sleeping pad and sleeping bag if you’re on the floor.\n\nHalf of our camps have 3 cabins with 1 cook station in their campsites. Those campsites have 48 beds and can hold up to 60 people with campers on the floor. (FYI - The girls usually don’t want to sleep with just a couple of girls in a cabin alone if they can sleep on the floor and bond with the other girls in another cabin). If you are a ward that would fill 1 or 2 cabins, it would help if you can find another ward to share with you and fill a campsite (48 beds or 60 people with campers on the floor). Sharing usually works better if you can find another ward, possibly from your stake, that can share with you.\n\nIf you are able to find another ward to share the campsite with you, please note both Ward names in the first answer field. Have each ward fill out their own waiting list form with their own info and numbers.\n\nIf you have questions about serving as a Missionary at Heber Valley Camp call Mission President Lorry Pitcher at 208-709-6052\n\n2024 Fall Open House - Saturday September 14th 1 - 4 pm\n\n2025 Spring Open House - Saturday May 17th 1 - 4 pm\n\nAnyone that is interested is invited to attend the Open Houses\n\nWinter Camping\n\nReservations for 2024-2025 Winter Camping open August 1, 2024. The dates for winter campings are:\n\nDecember 7-14, 2024\n\nJanuary 3 - March 15, 2025\n\nWinter activities are sledding, snowshoeing, cross country skiing or snow boarding ( you will need to bring your own equipment)\n\nSummer Groups and Family Camping\n\nReservations 2025 Summer Camping (other than youth groups) will open January 2nd.
