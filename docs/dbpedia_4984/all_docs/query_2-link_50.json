        "text": "Record: 25-0\n\nKey players: Cade Cunningham, Scottie Barnes, Dariq Whitehead, Moses Moody, Caleb Houstan, Day’Ron Sharpe, Ryan Nembhard, Zeb Jackson, Langston Love\n\nWhen it comes to star power, this Montverde team featured quality and quantity. Cade Cunningham was drafted first overall in 2021 by the Detroit Pistons, and Scottie Barnes was taken a few picks later by the Toronto Raptors. Moses Moody also was a lottery pick that year, and a few others from this squad have joined them in the NBA since then. A few are still playing in college at the Division 1 level. The Eagles ran the table in the 2019-20 season but were unable to claim a GEICO Nationals title due to the pandemic.\n\nRecord: 26-3\n\nKey players: Chet Holmgren, Jalen Suggs\n\nBefore Chet Holmgren and Jalen Suggs led Gonzaga to the 2021 NCAA national championship game and went on to become lottery picks by the Oklahoma City Thunder and Orlando Magic, the two played alongside each other for Minnehaha Academy. Coming off back-to-back state titles together, the star duo and the Redhawks couldn’t defend their title when the 2019-20 season was cut short due to COVID. With the senior Suggs and junior Holmgren both becoming McDonald’s All-American and top five picks in the NBA draft, it’s safe to say they would have earned more hardware and added to their legacy at Minnehaha.\n\nRecord: 29-0\n\nKey players: Michael Porter Jr., Jontay Porter, MarJon Beauchamp\n\nLed by National Player of the Year winner Michael Porter Jr. and coached by former NBA star Brandon Roy, the Raiders put together a perfect season which included a state title and No. 1 ranking nationally by USA Today. In terms of talent, Nathan Hale also featured five-star Jontay Porter, the younger brother of Michael Porter Jr., and then-freshman MarJon Beauchamp, who went on to become a first round pick in the 2022 NBA draft. In addition to dominating in-state competition on their way to winning a state championship, the Raiders defeated national powers Sierra Canyon (California) and Oak Hill Academy (Virginia), both top 10 teams in the country.\n\nRecord: 28-1\n\nKey players: Jordan Poole, Jaren Jackson Jr., Tyger Campbell, Brian Bowen\n\nLa Lumiere opened the season as the No. 1 team in the country, and they finished the season with a championship at GEICO Nationals. The Lakers didn't just have NBA stars Jordan Poole and Jaren Jackson Jr. on this squad, as former five-star recruit Brian Bowen and four-star guard Tyger Campbell, a key player in UCLA’s run to the 2021 Final Four, also played key roles. La Lumiere defeated teams like Findlay Prep (Nevada), Wasatch Academy (Utah) and Montverde Academy (Florida) during their memorable run.\n\nRecord: 35-0\n\nKey players: Lonzo Ball, LaMelo Ball, Liangelo Ball, Onyeka Okongwu\n\nThe Ball brothers — Lonzo, LiAngelo and LaMelo — became international celebrities while thrusting Chino Hills into the spotlight with a dominant 2015-16 campaign. The Huskies went undefeated, taking down Montverde Academy, Sierra Canyon and Bishop Gorman (Nevada) during the season and capturing a CIF Open Division state championship. Joining the Ball brothers in the starting lineup was freshman Onyeka Okongwu, who went on to be drafted sixth overall by the Atlanta Hawks in 2020, giving them three players who went to be top-six picks in the NBA draft.\n\nRecord: 27-0\n\nKey players: Harrison Barnes, Doug McDermott\n\nHome to Iowa State University, the city of Ames also produced one of the most talented and successful high school basketball teams in recent history. Leading the way for the Little Cyclones were a pair of future college and NBA standouts in Harrison Barnes and Doug McDermott. The duo of Barnes and McDermott led Ames to 53 consecutive wins and back-to-back state championships in 2009 and 2010 before heading to North Carolina and Creighton, respectively. Both became lottery picks and have had successful careers in the NBA, with Barnes currently playing for the Sacramento Kings and McDermott playing for the Indiana Pacers.\n\nRecord: 33-0\n\nKey players: Tristan Thompson, Avery Bradley, Cory Joseph\n\nNow defunct, Findlay Prep established itself as a national powerhouse with the help of future NBA standouts Tristan Thompson, Avery Bradley and Cory Joseph. The star-studded trio led the Pilots to a perfect season and national title, including a championship at the first edition of the tournament that went on to become GEICO Nationals. All three played college basketball at Texas, and all three went on to become first-round draft picks, with Thompson going the highest at No. 4 overall in 2011.\n\nRecord: 29-0\n\nKey players: Mike Conley, Greg Oden\n\nWith the superstar duo of Greg Oden and Mike Conley at the helm, Lawrence North went undefeated on the way to winning a state championship and finishing No. 1 in national polls in the 2005-06 season. Oden and Conley stuck together to play college basketball at Ohio State for one year before both were drafted in the top four of the 2007 NBA draft, with Oden going first overall to the Portland Trailblazers and Conley fourth overall to the Memphis Grizzlies. In a state with a rich history of high school basketball, this Lawrence North team is considered by many to be the best ever.\n\nRecord: 38-0\n\nKey players: Rajon Rondo, Josh Smith\n\nWidely regarded as one of the best high school basketball teams ever, this Oak Hill squad boasted a pair of future NBA stars in Rajon Rondo and Josh Smith. The legendary coach Steve Smith-led Warriors were deeper than that, with Division 1 bound players Brian Johnson, Dayshwan Wright, K.C. Rivers and more also in the fold. Compiling a perfect record of 38-0, including multiple tournament titles, this team had plenty of the success and talent required to be remembered as an all-time great.\n\nRecord: 25-1\n\nKey players: LeBron James, Dru Joyce III, Sian Cotton, Romeo Travis, Willie McGee\n\nWith LeBron James front and center, St. Vincent-St. Mary became one of the most followed high school teams ever. Playing a national schedule with multiple televised games, the Fighting Irish went undefeated with a state championship and national title in James’ senior year, just months before he was drafted first overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers right out of high school. Documentaries and movies have been made about LeBron and his teammates at the Akron school, ensuring their legacy will live on forever."
