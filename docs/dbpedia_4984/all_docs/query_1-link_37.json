The Winnipeg, Canada, native has been named a to the 2013 Capital One Academic All-America® College Division Men’s Soccer first team, as chosen by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA).\n\nThe Bulldogs’ prolific goal scorer is a repeat selection having also earned recognition as a Capital One Academic Third Team All-American and Capital One Academic All-District® 6 recipient of the College Division last season after an outstanding junior season.\n\nThe Capital One Academic All-America® College Division soccer teams are comprised of student-athletes from NAIA, Canadian and two-year institutions. Including both men’s and women’s soccer college division All-America first teams, Douglas is the only honoree to come from a GPAC institution as well as the only All-America recipient from a school in the state of Nebraska. Douglas is part of an exclusive list that recognized 11 men’s soccer academic All-Americans.\n\nCoSIDA: “The 2013-14 Capital One Academic All-District® Men’s and Women’s Soccer Teams have been released to recognize the nation’s top student-athletes for their combined performances athletically and in the classroom. Capital One has been the entitlement rights holder to CoSIDA’s Academic All-America teams programs since 2011.”\n\nDouglas, a 2012 Daktronics-NAIA Scholar-Athlete, has consistently put up high marks in the classroom while also excelling on the soccer field. The physics major (math minor) set Concordia’s program record for career goals this season. He completed his career with 43 goals over four years, including a career high 14 in 2013.\n\nThis season Douglas ranked second in the GPAC in both goals and points (35) and fourth in assists (7).
