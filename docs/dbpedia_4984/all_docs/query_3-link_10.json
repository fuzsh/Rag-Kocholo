        "text": "Nathan Douglas is on a mission. A mission in what every athlete in the country is targeting, training for and aiming to doÖ participate in the London 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nBut he hasnít had it all his own way.\n\nLast year Nathan suffered a freak but serious ankle injury while completing a plyometric exercise on a wooden box.\n\nWhilst landing on it, the box gave way and the end result was ruptured ankle ligaments, ruling him out of any appearances for the 2011 season before it even got started.\n\nNine months later and all is well for the British triple jumper, following an intense course of physiotherapy he’s now, slowly but surely, beginning to take the steps forward to return to the runway.\n\nìThings are going well in training,î he said. ìIím back jumping but nothing too heavy, itís been a long time since Iíve been out with it.\n\nìThere are doubts, but itís part of recovery and rehabilitation, you just got to have that belief, ultimately the aim is to get back out there and dust the cob webs out.î\n\nAlthough he may not have competed thus far, it hasnít stopped the Oxford City athlete from watching his event develop.\n\nOver the last two years or so the rise of jumpers such as Teddy Tamgho, Will Claye and Christian Taylor are now starting to set the event alight, much like 100m currently.\n\nAll three athletes named above have won World titles and are favourites to collect a medal come the summer, but Douglas, as heís been watching, knew that these names would start to dominate and predicts itís only a matter of time before the 18 meter barrier is broken.\n\nHe said, ìThe level of triple jump has gone up and I expected it to, itís a surprise that it has taken so long for it to do so, people are getting close to the 18 meter barrier and eventually someone will get there.\n\nìWith Christian Taylor I knew that he would jump big, Iíve watched him before the Worlds and while he was jumping at Crystal Palace last year, so I knew heíd do well in Daegu.î\n\nBut while the world can look forward to such an exciting prospect, a dark cloud is currently covering the world of British Athletics.\n\nItís been a week since the IAAF World Indoor Championships took place and the nationís media are still digging their claws unfairly into the labelled, ëPlastic Britsí, with Shara Proctor and YamilÈ Aldama feeling the full force of it.\n\nìIf people coming in to the squad are eligible to compete for Great Britain then why not?î Douglas asked, ìI donít agree with the label of ëPlastic Britonsí and I have no issues with it what so ever.\n\nìIím sure they know there may be an issue but I donít think there will be a ëno confidenceí issue about it, maybe they will feel the pressure a little, but itís a chance for them to brush up.\n\nìIím so happy for YamilÈ Aldama because whatís sheís done is amazing, to come in and jump that far at 39 years old, Iím just so happy for her.î\n\nBut as the negativity of the national media focusí on that, thereís that large matter of an appearance in the Olympics Games for Douglas.\n\nYet to make an appearance indoors because of his recovery, he is targeting the outdoor competitions to sharpen up, and itís that excitement of the Olympics thatís making this season pivotal yet exciting for him.\n\nHe said, ìThis will be the biggest ever competition in my lifetime, the fact that itís the Olympic Games and itís here, in our home country.\n\nìI have to take it one step at a time, major championships are about going out to try winning a medal and I hope that I can do that.î\n\nYou can follow Nathanís progress to compete at the Olympics via his twitter account; be sure to follow him on @NathanJDouglas"
