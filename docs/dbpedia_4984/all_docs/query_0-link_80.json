        "text": "CITY of Plymouth’s Emily Bee became South West Schools’ heptathlon champion at the weekend.\n\nBee edged out Devon rival Emily Tyrrell to take the senior girls’ title at Exeter with 4,908 points.\n\nAlthough she was hoping for a bigger total, the Plymouth High School pupil, in her first year in the senior girls’ category, did win by 120 points and equalled her high jump PB of 1.68cm, which was her biggest leap of the season by six centimetres.\n\nIn the 100m hurdles she ran 14.60 seconds into a wind. After her high jump, she then threw 9.83m in the shot, ran 26.02 seconds in the 200m, leaped 5.44m in the long jump, threw 32.08m in the javelin and ran 2:31.67 in the 800m.\n\nShe has now qualified for the English Schools’ Combined Events Championships, which will be held at Exeter in September.\n\nThe South West Schools’ event clashed with the England Under-20 and Under-23 Championships in Bedford.\n\nBee opted to compete in the heptathlon at Exeter, but her City of Plymouth team-mate Sammie Harris did go to Bedford for the 100m hurdles. Harris went with high hopes of challenging for a medal as she went into the event ranked fourth at under-20 level in the UK, but unfortunately she suffered a fall in the heats and missed out on a final spot.\n\nFellow City of Plymouth athlete Victoria Weir came fourth in the under-23 3,000m steeplechase final. In a race that went off quick in hot conditions with European Championship spots up for grabs, Weir clocked 10:47.31. It was only her third run over the distance, having clocked 10:32.22 earlier this month and 10:34.05 last month. She is ranked third under-23 in the UK and in the top 10 women overall.\n\nMeanwhile, City of Plymouth international hurdler David King continues to edge down his season’s best time for the 110m hurdles down.\n\nKing clocked 13.55 seconds in the heats at the European Classics Meeting in Kuortane, Finland. He had run 13.56 and 13.58 at other meets in Europe this month.\n\nAlthough he could not quite run quite as fast in the final 80 minutes later, he did take second overall behind home favourite Elmo Lakka.\n\nErme Valley Harriers’ Sam Trigg also competed in Kuortane. He is on his comeback from injury and he came ninth in the triple jump, which was won by fellow Brit Nathan Douglas."
