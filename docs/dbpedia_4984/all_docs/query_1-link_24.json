        "text": "View complete academic all-district soccer teams\n\nSEWARD, Neb. – An exemplary student and star goal scorer on the pitch, Concordia senior Nathan Douglas has earned yet another honor. On Thursday Douglas was named to the Capital One Academic All-District® 3 Men’s Soccer Team of the College Division, as selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA).\n\nThe Winnipeg, Canada, native is a repeat selection having also earned recognition as a Capital One Academic Third Team All-American and Capital One Academic All-District® 6 recipient of the College Division last season after an outstanding junior season.\n\nCoSIDA: “The 2013-14 Capital One Academic All-District® Men’s and Women’s Soccer Teams have been released to recognize the nation’s top student-athletes for their combined performances athletically and in the classroom. Capital One has been the entitlement rights holder to CoSIDA’s Academic All-America teams programs since 2011.”\n\nDouglas, a 2012 Daktronics-NAIA Scholar-Athlete, has consistently put up high marks in the classroom while also excelling on the soccer field. The physics major (math minor) set Concordia’s program record for career goals this season. He now has 42 goals over the last four years, including a career high 13 in 2013.\n\nThis season Douglas ranks second in the GPAC in both goals and points (32) and third in assists (6). He has 11 career multi-goal games with three coming this season.\n\nDistrict 3 of the College Division covers the states of Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\nAs an all-district honoree, Douglas will automatically be placed on the ballot for All-America consideration. All-America voting begins on Tuesday, Nov. 5."
