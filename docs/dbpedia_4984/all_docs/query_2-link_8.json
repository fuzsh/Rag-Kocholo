        "text": "There is something about a great sports story that transcends audiences. Perhaps it’s because we are seemingly hardwired to root for an underdog, or fight to overcome the adversity in our own lives. Whatever the reason, inspiring sports stories — and inspiring sports biographies, in particular — are some of the most successfully sold books on the market. These fifty sports biographies, all of which are ranked by Amazon as the highest rated and bestselling of their kind, represent the very best that sports has to offer. From baseball to horse racing, the books on this list are a showcase of true stories that are bound to move and inspire readers of all ages, backgrounds, and athletic ability.\n\nBaseball\n\nI Never Had It Made\n\nJackie Robinson\n\nIn 1947, Jackie Robinson broke the color line in major league baseball when he was recruited by Branch Rickey to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Originally published in 1972 (the year Robinson died), this book is a full account of Robinson’s commitment to achieving justice for himself and others like him. His years as UCLA’s first four-letter athlete, his draft and subsequent court-martial during WWII, and experiences in the Negro Leagues and with the Dodgers are all in here. Robinson also offers inspiring anecdotes about sports figures he most admired, like Rickey and teammate Pee Wee Reese.\n\nLink to Amazon\n\nThe Kid\n\nBen Bradlee, Jr.\n\nUndoubtedly one of the best baseball players in history, Ted Williams was the last man to hit .400 in a season. He was also insecure, a flawed husband and father, a raging hothead, and aggressive towards the press. But Bradlee’s ambitious biography accounts for both the heroics and the darker side of a man Bradlee admits in the first pages to be his hero. Bradlee spent over ten years investigating the details of Williams’s 83 years, and even includes some disturbing tidbits about Williams’s death in 2002, such as when his head was severed and cryogenically frozen after his death.\n\nLink to Amazon\n\nMoneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game\n\nMichael Lewis\n\nMichael Lewis’s bestseller is a biography of the 2002 and 2003 Oakland Athletics team and management staff. With a much smaller team budget than that of other teams, manager Billy Beane used a series of numbers and statistics to build a winning team. Among his recruits were an overweight college athlete, previously ignored triple A players, a tired catcher-turned-first baseman, and a number of older athletes discarded by bigger teams. Lewis’s account of these fascinating characters is considered one of the best books ever written about baseball, and inspired the film starring Brad Pitt as Beane.\n\nLink to Amazon\n\nBabe: The Legend Comes to Life\n\nRobert Creamer\n\nSportswriter Robert Creamer’s extensive biography of Babe Ruth follows baseball’s most famous figure from his early childhood to his abrupt end. Originally published in 1974, a time when many of Ruth’s contemporaries were still living, Creamer’s book is a fascinating look into both baseball and life in the early twentieth century. The hardcore baseball fan will appreciate the stats and vivid descriptions of some of Ruth’s most important games, while the casual baseball fan will get caught up in the Bambino’s celebrity and sometimes surprising character.\n\nLink to Amazon\n\nJoe DiMaggio: The Hero’s Life\n\nRichard Ben Cramer\n\nIn this book, Richard Ben Cramer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, brings to life one of the twentieth century’s biggest American heroes. Joe DiMaggio was an immigrant kid who achieved the American Dream, a New York Yankee who helped to usher the team into its current dynasty, and the sometime husband of the beautiful Marilyn Monroe. Upon its initial publication, however, Cramer’s book stirred up plenty of controversy. This is perhaps because Cramer does not hesitate to include the darker moments in DiMaggio’s life: his troubled marriage to Marilyn Monroe, his self-inflicted isolation, and living up to the impossible expectations set for him by America.\n\nLink to Amazon\n\nPete Rose: An American Dilemma\n\nKostya Kennedy\n\nMore than twenty-five years after Pete Rose’s banishment from baseball for gambling, the question of whether or not he belongs in the Hall of Fame is still as controversial as ever. Kostya Kennedy, an editor at Sports Illustrated, examines Rose’s life, from his early childhood to the baseball career in which he hit more base hits than any other player in history. Throughout the biography, Kennedy compares Rose’s talents — and mistakes — to others who have been found worthy of Cooperstown.\n\nLink to Amazon\n\nNolan Ryan: The Making of a Pitcher\n\nRob Goldman\n\nDuring his 27 years as a major league pitcher, Nolan Ryan was named an All-Star eight times, pitched seven no-hitters, and threw more than 5,700 strikeouts. Ron Goldman’s comprehensive biography follows Ryan from the start of his professional career in 1965 to his retirement in 1993. Goldman also includes anecdotes and personal recollections from various coaches, stadium workers, fans, trainers, and players in an attempt to fully discover and illustrate what makes Ryan one of history’s most beloved and respected ball players.\n\nLink to Amazon\n\nThey Called Me God: The Best Umpire Who Ever Lived\n\nDoug Harvey\n\nWhile there are hundreds of biographies written about baseball players, there are far fewer about those behind the scenes. Doug Harvey was a California farm boy and minor league umpire before hard work and dedication helped him break into the big leagues in 1962. They Called Me God is Harvey’s account of the things he saw from his spot behind the plate. Some of the book’s more memorable stories include Roberto Clemente’s three-thousandth hit, the contentious 1968 World Series, and laying down the law with legendary managers like Tommy Lasorda and Joe Torre.\n\nLink to Amazon\n\nThe Closer\n\nMariano Rivera\n\nWhen he was recruited by the New York Yankees, Mariano Rivera did not own a glove, had never flown in an airplane, could not speak English, and had never heard of Babe Ruth. Rivera’s bestselling autobiography tells the story of his evolution from the son of a poor fisherman in Panama to one of the greatest relief pitchers of all time. In addition to stories about the Yankees, the discovery of his iconic fastball, and the 2001 World Series, Rivera very honestly describes the challenges that come with being both a latino and a Christian in the world of professional baseball in the United States.\n\nLink to Amazon\n\nThe Catcher Was a Spy: The Mysterious Life of Moe Berg\n\nNicholas Dawidoff\n\nMoe Berg’s baseball card is the only one of its kind on display at CIA headquarters. This is because in addition to his 15-year career as a catcher for the New York Robins and Chicago White Sox, Berg served as a spy for the OSS (the CIA’s predecessor) during World War II. Though there are not many known, definitive facts about Berg’s life, Nicholas Dawidoff follows Berg’s career from pitcher, to law professor at Columbia University, to OSS spy investigating Nazi Germany’s atomic bomb program.\n\nLink to Amazon\n\nThe Captain: The Journey of Derek Jeter\n\nIan O’Connor\n\nIn this bestselling book about one of our most beloved sports figures, author Ian O’Connor investigates Derek Jeter’s early life as a biracial kid in Michigan, to his struggles as a minor leaguer.
