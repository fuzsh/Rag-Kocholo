Both of them appeared ready for the task but one obviously had a better understanding of the goal. The two bottles were kept few meters apart while two buckets filled with water were kept at the opposite far end. A little cup was put in the buckets to enable the contenders fetch some water, then run with it to the other end and pour into their bottles. This was to be repeated until the bottle is filled. At the blow of a whistle, the competition began. The both contenders understood the first instruction -using the cup to fetch from the bucket, run to the other end and pour into the bottle. However, it was glaring that Max didn't understand that whoever fills the bottle first becomes the winner, hence, he poured most of his water away. On the other hand, the girl understood not just the task but the aim and techniques. While Max's bottle was half full, the girl's bottle was full ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ The final whistle made my son realize that a winner had emerged. That not withstanding, I cheered him on (though he already understood that he lost) Sapience: every competition (personal/interpersonal) has rules, timeframe and goals. Understanding these before embarking on competitions will guarantee success.\n\nSummer is almost here and there's no better time to head out for an Ohio adventure.
