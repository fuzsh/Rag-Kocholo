        "text": "Quinsigamond Community College (QCC) offers more than 115 associate degree and certificate study options in the areas of: Business, Financial and Hospitality Management; Computer and Information Technology; Education; Engineering and Engineering Technology; Healthcare; Installation, Maintenance and Repair Technology; Liberal Arts and General Studies; Mathematics & Sciences; and Public and Social Services. The College can prepare students for transfer to a bachelor level program at a four-year college or university, or for immediate entry into a career field after graduation. If one enrolls as a full-time student in the day, he or she can expect to complete an associate degree in two years. Most certificate programs can be completed in two semesters or less of full-time study. Opportunities for part-time study exist in both the day and evening, on weekends, and during the Summer. If one enrolls as a part-time student, the length of time it takes to complete the associate degree or certificate program will depend upon his or her course load each term.\n\nAt QCC, the academic year consists of a Fall and a Spring semester, each of which is approximately 15 weeks long. Fall classes begin in September and continue through mid-December; Spring classes begin in late January and end in early May. There are two short terms in each semester (Fall and Spring) that are seven weeks long: Fall 1 classes begin in September and end in late October, followed by Fall 2 that ends in December; Spring 1 classes begin in late January and end in early March, followed by Spring 2 that ends in early May. The Summer sessions begin in late May and continue through August.\n\nA student must be enrolled for a minimum of 12 credits each semester to be considered a full-time student; if a student enrolls for fewer than 12 credits, he or she is considered a part-time student. QCC has a maximum credit registration policy. If a student wishes to register for more than 19 credits in any semester, he or she must obtain the prior approval of the Vice President of Academic Affairs.\n\nAny student who has completed fewer than 30 credits of coursework is considered a Freshman; a student who has completed at least 30 credits is considered a Sophomore.\n\nDegree Requirements\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Higher Education has statutory authority to confer the associate degree through the individual community colleges. Upon the recommendation of the faculty, qualified candidates are awarded the degree of Associate in Arts (A.A.), Associate in Science (A.S.), or Associate in Applied Science (A.A.S.) at QCC. The College also awards certificates in various fields.\n\nTo qualify for an associate degree or certificate, the student must satisfy the following requirements:\n\nApply for, and be admitted to, an associate degree or certificate, program offered by the College;\n\nComplete the required courses and the specified number of credit hours for the program in which he or she the student is enrolled;\n\nMaintain a Quality Point Average (QPA) of at least 2.0 in the overall and degree being conferred ; or maintain a Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least 2.0 in the certificate being conferred;\n\nEarn a minimum of 25% of credits in residence at QCC in the degree or certificate being conferred;\n\nOnly 25% of credits in certificates with 30 or fewer credits can be from Credit for Prior Learning (CPL);\n\nCPL and articulated credits from QCC non-credit courses are not considered as credits in residence.\n\nSatisfy all financial obligations to the College\n\nStudents completing all requirements for a certificate program while enrolled in an associate degree program may apply for that certificate program and also continue in the associate degree program.\n\nAssociate degrees and certificates are conferred three times a year - after the Fall and Spring semesters, and after the Summer session. Commencement Exercises are held once a year, at the end of the Spring term. All students who complete associate degree or certificate requirements in the Summer, Fall, or Spring will have their names included in the Commencement Program and will be eligible to participate in the Commencement Ceremony.\n\nResidence Requirement\n\nA minimum of 25% of the credit hours in the degree or certificate being conferred is required to fulfill the College residency requirement. The balance of credits may be drawn from regionally accredited postsecondary institutions and/or credit by examination in applicable situations. Only 25% of credits in certificates with 30 or fewer credits can be from Credit for Prior Learning (CPL). CPL and articulated credits from QCC non-credit courses are not considered as credits in residence.\n\nCredit Hour Definition\n\nThe College follows the Carnegie Unit for credit. Students are expected to spend a minimum of 45 hours of work for each credit. The most common breakdown for one credit is one hour of class instruction and two hours of homework for 15 weeks each semester. A three credit course demands nine hours each week.\n\nEarning a Degree in Two Programs\n\nIf the student receives an associate degree from QCC and wishes to qualify for an associate degree in another program, he or she must complete all major course requirements in the second program, as well as meet the residence requirement of the College.\n\nCriminal Offender Record Information and Sex Offender Registry Information Checks (CORI/SORI)\n\nIn order for a student to be eligible to participate in an academic, community or clinical program that involves potential unsupervised contact with children, the disabled, or the elderly, the student may be required to undergo a Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) check and/or a Sex Offender Registry Information (SORI) check. Students found to have certain criminal convictions or pending criminal actions will be presumed ineligible to participate in such activities; therefore, the student may be ineligible for clinical placement, and as a result unable to continue in the program. The College is authorized by the Commonwealth’s Criminal History Systems Board, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 6, Sections 167-178B, to access CORI records. The College shall refer to regulations issued by the Commonwealth’s Executive Office of Health and Human Services, 101 Code of Massachusetts Regulations 15.00-15.16, as guidance when assessing student CORI records. Sex Offender checks shall be performed pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 6, Sections 178C-178P. Students should notify the Dean of Students if a change occurs during College enrollment.\n\nHealth Program Policy\n\nPolicies of QCC health programs are comprehensive, provide for the welfare of faculty and staff, and are consistent with those of the governing organization; however, differences in policies may occur as justified by the goals and outcomes of the specific health program.\n\nCredit for Prior Learning (CPL)\n\nCredit for Prior Learning is a way for students to earn college credit for prior learning acquired through work experience, military experience, industry credentials and by taking national exams. Credit may be earned in a variety of ways; credentialing, portfolio assessment and various competency examinations. For additional information regarding Credit for Prior Learning, contact the Career Services & Credit for Prior Learning Office or visit www.QCC.edu/prior-learning-credit. To start an application for CPL visit https://myexperiencecounts.mass.edu/.\n\nNote: Credentialing, Portfolios and Challenge Exams receive a “P” grade which may not be accepted at other institutions, consult with the institution for their transfer policy.\n\nCredentialing: This is the process of earning credit for structured learning experiences in non-collegiate institutions or through current articulations that QCC has. Accreditation occurs through establishing an equivalency between the non-collegiate course and a QCC course. Some examples include CNA certifications and numerous articulations with the Massachusetts Firefighting Academy. Program restrictions may apply.\n\nPortfolio Assessment: Students can apply to create a portfolio to document their skills and competencies attained through non-collegiate training and/or work experience. This documentation is reviewed and evaluated by a QCC faculty member who measures demonstrated learning outcomes against established academic standards. Program restrictions may apply.\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP): QCC awards credit to students who score three or higher on the Advanced Placement (AP) examinations, administered by the College Board. Official Grade Report must be provided by the College Board and submitted to the Career Services & Credit for Prior Learning Office.\n\nChallenge Examinations: These examinations enable students to earn credit for courses listed in the QCC Catalog by taking a test developed and administered by a QCC faculty member. Generally, a student may not request a Challenge Examination when other proficiency examinations, such as the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) or the DANTES Subject Standardized Test (DSST), are available, or to replace a failed course or to raise a low grade. Program restrictions may apply.\n\nCollege Level Examination Program (CLEP): QCC has standing articulations for most CLEP exams and will award academic credit to students who achieve scores at or above the 50th percentile. CLEP examinations are offered in English, humanities, mathematics, and social science/history. A maximum of 32 credits will be awarded for all of the general exams, if the appropriate score is achieved. Students must provide the official CLEP transcript to Career Services & Credit for Prior Learning. Program restrictions may apply.\n\nDANTES Subject Standardized Test (DSST): QCC has standing articulations in place for most DSST exams and will award academic credit to students who achieve scores at or above the 50th percentile on the DSST exam, administered through Educational Testing Service (ETS), which covers a wide range of technical, business and academic subjects. Students must provide official DSST transcript to Career Services & Credit for Prior Learning. Program restrictions apply.\n\nCollege Credit for Military Coursework, Training and Experience Policy\n\nQCC awards academic credit towards degrees and certificates for a student’s previous military training, coursework and experiences, based upon the institution’s admission standards, the student’s program of study, and consistency with the mission of the Commonwealth’s system of higher education. At QCC, academic credit may be awarded where appropriate through multiple methods of evaluation, including: the American Council on Education (ACE), Joint Transcript Service (JST); DSST and CLEP Subject Standardized Tests; Challenge Exams; Credentialing; and Portfolio Development.\n\nEnrolling in Courses Offered by the Higher Education Consortium of Central Massachusetts (HECCMA)\n\nFull-time day students at QCC may register for one day school course offered by any member of HECCMA. Registration is on a “space-available” basis and is subject to course prerequisites and any other course restrictions. If a similar course is being offered at QCC, the student’s request for permission to cross-register may be denied. Cross-registered students are subject to all of the regulations of the institution providing the course. Although students are limited to one cross-registration each semester, exceptions to this requirement may be made by the Vice President of Academic Affairs, but only in unusual circumstances. Contact the QCC Registrar’s Office at 508.854.4257 for more information about enrolling in a course at a HECCMA college.\n\nAssessment of Student Learning\n\nQCC employs the traditional practice for assessment of student learning wherein the quantity of learning is measured by the number of credits (semester hours) earned, and its quality is recognized by an award of a grade for the learning experience. The design of this College practice shall be, so far as practicable, responsive to the needs of students enrolled in a course or program. The status of the student in a program shall be determined by accumulated course grades earned.\n\nGrading Policy\n\nThe grading policy shall be in conformity with the College mission of access and quality.\n\nGrades shall be awarded only for demonstrated student learning.\n\nProgram goals shall be achieved through successful completion of established learning outcomes of educational experiences in the program.\n\nLearning outcomes of educational experiences shall constitute the basis for assessing student learning.\n\nThe criteria for assessing learning outcomes shall be as objective as possible.\n\nGrading System\n\nThe individual faculty member may determine what numerical equivalent, if any, to assign to the various grade designations. Faculty may use an absolute numerical value or they may grade on the class average. The following table indicates recommended but non-mandatory numerical/letter equivalents for awarding grades. Note: The quality point for each letter grade is College-wide policy, not merely recommended as a guideline:\n\nAcademicGrades QualityPointsA95-100Outstanding4.00A-90-943.70B+87-893.30B83-86High Quality3.00B-80-822.70C+77-792.30C73-76Average2.00C-70-721.70D+67-691.30D63-661.00D-60-620.70FFailed0.00\n\nThe status of the student may also be indicated by the following designations which will not be computed in the QPA.\n\n“I” - The student has satisfied the major requirements of the learning experience, as judged by the instructor, and can complete the assigned work by the end of the 12th week of the following full semester.\n\n“I/R” - The student has agreed to repeat the course within the following year. Not computed in the QPA until converted to an academic grade.\n\n“AU” - The student is registered in the learning experience as an audit student. Not computed in the QPA.\n\n“W” - The student has officially withdrawn on his or her own from the learning experience. Not computed in the QPA.\n\n“WA” - The student has been withdrawn administratively for failure to fulfill financial or immunization obligations or for medical or disciplinary circumstances. Not computed in the QPA.\n\n“X” - The student has not officially withdrawn from the learning experience, and the instructor has judged there is insufficient basis for evaluation. The “X” grade is considered an indication of unsatisfactory academic progress for financial aid purposes.\n\n“P” - The student has satisfactorily completed the learning experience with a “C” grade or higher. Not computed in the QPA but computed in credits attempted.\n\n“Q” - The student has registered for a course with a laboratory or clinical component and the grade is reflected in the overall course grade.\n\nGrading Regulations\n\nThe letter grades “A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, and “F” shall be awarded for learning outcomes for an educational experience achieved through alternate delivery systems only if a QCC faculty member is responsible for the entire experience. The letter grade of “P” shall be awarded for acceptable learning outcomes for a prior learning experience.\n\nThe grade of “I” will be converted to an academic grade by the end of the 12th week of the following full semester. Students who have not completed the course requirements by the end of the 12th week will have the course grade changed to “F”.\n\nWhen a grade of “I” is issued, the instructor will indicate on a specified form the assignments which will remedy the deficiency, or that the course is to be repeated. This form will be filed in the QCC Registrar’s Office. The Registrar will forward a copy of the form to the student.\n\nWhen a grade of “I/R” is issued and the course is not repeated within the following year, the grade of “I/R” will be converted to an academic grade of “F”.\n\nIf an instructor wishes to use “P” instead of “A”, “B”, or “C” as a final grade, he or she must receive written permission from the Vice President of Academic Affairs before the beginning of the semester.\n\nInstructors’ course requirements, expected learning outcomes, methods of evaluation, and attendance policy will be published in writing and will be submitted to students by the end of the first week, or equivalent, of class.\n\nEvaluation of the student learning will be made according to the instructor’s stated learning outcomes.\n\nAuditors do not receive official grades on examinations or other class assignments, although they may be asked to fulfill all course requirements. No change to or from audit status will be permitted after the first 10 weeks of class (or equivalent class hours).\n\nIf a course is repeated, only one grade will be used in computation of the QPA. However, both the original and the second grade earned will remain on the student’s permanent record.\n\nStudents may add or drop courses during the Add/Drop Period, in accordance with the established procedure. The Add/Drop Period is posted on the Academic Calendar.\n\nA student may withdraw without penalty through the 10th week (or equivalent) of class. Thereafter, if a student withdraws from a course, the instructor may award a “W” if work is passing or an “F” if work is not of passing quality. Students withdrawing from the College are included under this regulation.\n\nA student intending to withdraw from a course after the Add/Drop Period must do so prior to the last day of the term as follows:\n\nObtain a withdrawal form from the QCC Registrar’s Office (Room 152, Administration Building or online on The Q) or the QCC Advising Center (Welcome Center in the Harrington Learning Center) at QCC Worcester (Main Campus).\n\nIf a student wishes to withdraw prior to the 10th week (or equivalent) of class, he or she may complete the form, obtain the signature of the instructor or Academic Advisor and return the form to the QCC Registrar’s Office.\n\nAfter the 10th week (or equivalent), the student must obtain the instructor’s signature. The instructor will designate if the student withdrew while passing or withdrew while failing and return the completed withdrawal form to the QCC Registrar’s Office.\n\nAny student in an educational or vocational training institution who is unable because of his or her religious beliefs to attend class or to participate in any examination, study or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any such examination or study or work requirement, and shall be provided with an opportunity to make up such examination, study or work requirement that he or she may have missed because of such absence on any particular day; provided, however, that such a makeup examination or work shall not create an unreasonable burden on such school. The institution, for making available to the said student such opportunity, shall charge no fees of any kind. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to the student because of his or her availing himself or herself of the provisions of this section. (Section 2bn, Chapter 151C, Massachusetts General Law).\n\nAcademic Dismissal and Probation\n\nAll students matriculating in an associate degree or certificate program, other than first semester freshmen (cumulatively enrolled for under 17 credits), must meet the following requirements:\n\nAttempted\n\nCredit Hours Dismissal Probation\n\n17 to 32 QPA under 1.50 QPA 1.50-1.69\n\nover 32 QPA under 1.70 QPA 1.70-1.89\n\nFirst semester freshmen (cumulatively enrolled for under 17 credits) who do not meet a minimum QPA of 1.00 will be put on academic probation. Academic probation and dismissal will occur on the basis of the cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA). Only courses in which “W” grades or audits are received will not count in determining full-time and part-time enrolled status. Students who are on probation for two successive semesters are subject to academic dismissal. Academic probation/dismissal will not apply to Winter/Intersession and Summer sessions. All dismissals are subject to review by the Vice President of Academic Affairs.\n\nStudents who are academically dismissed from the College may qualify for reinstatement by the following methods:\n\nAttending courses as a non-matriculating student, improving their QPA to the minimal acceptable level, and earning a minimum of six credit hours.\n\nRemaining away for one year.\n\nPetitioning the Vice President of Academic Affairs for reinstatement.\n\nAcademic Standing\n\n“Satisfactory Academic Standing” and “Satisfactory Academic Progress” are synonymous with meeting the standards outlined in Item 2 of Academic Dismissal and Probation. Students on academic probation for one semester meet minimum requirements for good academic standing and satisfactory progress, but if they are on a dismissal status, they will be deemed as not meeting the minimum requirements.\n\nA QPA of 2.00 is the minimal level for graduating in any associate degree or certificate program.\n\nAppeal of Academic Dismissal\n\nAny student who is academically dismissed may appeal his or her case to the Vice President of Academic Affairs.\n\nThe student is mailed directions along with the dismissal notice instructing him or her to make an appointment to meet with the High Risk Advisor to discuss strategies to raise his or her cumulative average. The student is required to complete an Appeal Form that states the circumstances involved in the dismissal and the recommendations of the High Risk Advisor. The appeal is then forwarded to the Vice President of Academic Affairs for his or her decision.\n\nThe student is then contacted by the High Risk Advisor who informs him or her of the Vice President’s decision. If the appeal is approved, he or she is then asked to come in to register for courses in accordance with the appeal form recommendations.\n\nStudents reinstated through appeal continue on Academic Probation and are subject to the Dismissal/Probation Policy again at the end of the next semester.\n\nFresh Start Option\n\nQCC has a “fresh start” option for students who are seeking readmission. Once in a lifetime, if a student returns to QCC, after being away for at least two consecutive years, he or she can elect the “fresh start” option. The QPA will be calculated only from the point the student is readmitted for the purposes of the College’s academic standing policy. However, the student’s previous academic work will remain on his or her transcript as a matter of record. The student’s previous coursework can be applied toward another degree under this policy, but will not be calculated in the QPA. The student must complete a minimum of 15 credits in the new program. The student’s official transcript will include a statement explaining this “fresh start” option. For additional information, contact the QCC Registrar’s Office.\n\nPetition Process\n\nIf the student believes there are unusual or extenuating circumstances which justify his or her exemption from an academic regulation (e.g., graduation course requirement), he or she can obtain a Student Petition form from the QCC Registrar’s Office. After completing the form, it must be returned directly to the QCC Registrar’s Office; the form will be forwarded to the Vice President of Academic Affairs for a final decision on the appeal.\n\nRequest to Change Study Option\n\nThe student can request to change from one associate degree or certificate program to another by completing a Study Option Change Request. This form is available in the QCC Admissions Office (Welcome Center, HLC, 2nd Floor) or in the QCC Advising Center (Welcome Center in the Harrington Learning Center) at QCC Worcester (Main Campus). In order to be approved to change from one academic program to another, the student must meet the minimum academic admissions requirements for the program he or she is requesting to enter.\n\nCourse Changes\n\nStudents should have their semester course schedule in final form by the end of the registration period. If the student wishes to make a change in his or her schedule, he or she must contact the QCC Registrar’s Office or the QCC Advising Center during the Add/Drop Period. However, it may not be possible to accommodate every request for a course or section change.\n\nPlease note that under certain circumstances, course modalities may need to be modified to ensure the safety of our campus community and/or the professor’s ability to continue instruction and complete courses and academic semesters.\n\nRepeating a Course\n\nIf the student repeats a course, only one grade will be used in the computation of the QPA. However, both the original and the second grade earned will remain on the student’s permanent record. It is important to note, however, that the College’s standards of satisfactory academic progress for federal financial aid requires that the student complete his or her program within 150% of the credits required for that program. Too many repeat courses will have an impact on this requirement. All courses attempted, including withdrawals, are counted toward the 150% calculation.\n\nProgress Reports\n\nDuring the eighth week of classes each semester, the student’s mid-semester progress grades are available on The Q, the College’s Student and Faculty Portal. Progress grades are intended only as indicators of student progress in specific courses.\n\nRestricted Courses\n\nTo ensure the availability of required courses for students enrolled in specific programs, certain courses may be designated as “restricted”.\n\nRestricted courses will be identified by the Vice President of Academic Affairs or designee.\n\nAdmission will be prioritized according to criteria set by the Vice President of Academic Affairs or designee as follows:\n\nStudents enrolled in the program.\n\nStudents on the related QCC program waiting list; and other students (with the approval of the Vice President of Academic Affairs or designee).\n\nSequential Courses\n\nIn curricula where sequential courses must be arranged in the order of difficulty, the beginning courses will present a basic knowledge of the discipline, including the philosophy, techniques, and terminology as appropriate; and the contents of the succeeding courses will be based upon that knowledge. A course prerequisite will be established when a body of knowledge or skills level is necessary for a sequential course.\n\nAny student registered for a course for which he or she does not have the listed prerequisite will be withdrawn from that course.\n\nThe School Dean or a designee will place the incoming student at the appropriate academic level according to his or her demonstrated performance or achievement.\n\nIn sequential courses, where the first semester course is a prerequisite for the second semester course, a student receiving a 12 week “I” must petition the appropriate School Dean for admittance to the sequential course.\n\nIf a student has achieved Advanced Placement (AP) and wishes credit for previously acquired skills in that subject, he or she must apply to Career Services & Credit for Prior Learning (Room 272, Administration Building) at QCC Worcester (Main Campus) for credit prior to completion of the course.\n\nA matriculating student who has earned credit in a course with a prerequisite may not subsequently enroll in or receive a grade in the prerequisite course.\n\nThe School Dean or designee will annually review course sequencing and prerequisites to assure their continuing validity.\n\nWithdrawal From the College\n\nTo officially withdraw from the College, the student must meet with an Academic Advisor in the QCC Advising Center. The Academic Advisor will assist the student in completing a withdrawal form and discuss possible resources and referrals if appropriate. If the student withdraws after the 10th week and before the final evaluation period, he or she will receive grades from his or her instructors in accordance with the College’s grading policy.\n\nIf the student has to withdraw due to medical reasons, he or she should make a request for information to the Vice President for Enrollment Management, Student Engagement and Community Connections (Room 133, Administration Building) at QCC Worcester (Main Campus). The Vice President will consult with appropriate personnel at the College, as well as the medical services provider of the student. After consultation, he or she will inform the student of the decision. If circumstances warrant, a process for future readmission will also be communicated.\n\nIf the student is receiving financial aid, he or she is advised to consult with the QCC Financial Aid Office (Welcome Center on the 2nd floor of the Harrington Learning Center) at QCC Worcester (Main Campus) prior to withdrawal. Financial aid may be reduced and future eligibility could be impacted as a result of withdrawal from the College, or individual course withdrawal.\n\nStudent Honors\n\nQCC recognizes the academic achievement of its students each semester. Students who meet the following criteria are eligible for recognition:\n\nAll grades must be “C” or higher. (No grades of “I” or “X” are permitted).\n\nSemester QPA must be 3.50 or higher, and cumulative QPA must be 2.00 or higher.\n\nAll courses must be college level.\n\nDean’s List: Students who meet the stated criteria and have earned 12 or more credits in a given semester are named to the Dean’s List.\n\nMerit List: Students who meet the stated criteria and have earned six or more credits in a given semester, but fewer than 12 credits, are named to the Merit List. Individual honors are noted on the student’s transcript each semester.\n\nPhi Theta Kappa (PTK): The mission of PTK is to recognize academic achievement of college students and to provide opportunities for them to grow as scholars and leaders. Its purpose is to recognize and encourage fellowship and scholarship, leadership, and service among two-year college students. Each Spring, a limited number of students who have distinguished themselves at QCC are inducted into membership. QCC’s Chapter, Alpha Zeta Theta, invites twice a year – once in the Fall semester and once in the Spring semester. Students who meet the criteria and have earned 12 college credits at QCC, and also have a cumulative GPA of 3.50, will receive this invitation. The Alpha Zeta Theta Chapter is located in the QCC PTK Office, Room 349, Administration Building and Room 351, Administration Building at QCC Worcester (Main Campus).\n\nWho’s Who Among Students in American Community and Junior Colleges (Who’s Who): This is one of the most highly regarded honors programs in the nation, earning the respect of college faculty and administrators. Recognition as one of the outstanding campus leaders in America is a major achievement. Each year, several QCC students are named to Who’s Who.\n\nGraduation Honors: Each May at graduation, QCC honors students for their outstanding academic achievement. Students with a QPA of at least 3.60 prior to graduation qualify for Highest Honors. Students with a QPA of 3.30 or 3.00 prior to graduation qualify for High Honors, or Honors, respectively.\n\nHuman Services Honor Society: QCC sponsors a local chapter of the National Organization for Human Services Honor Society, a national honor society in human services for community and junior colleges. The purpose of the Human Services Honor Society is to honor academic excellence; to foster lifelong learning, leadership and development; and to promote excellence in service to humanity.\n\nPsi Beta: The QCC Psychology Department sponsors a local Chapter of Psi Beta, a national honor society in psychology for community colleges. Psi Beta’s mission is to encourage professional development and psychological literacy of all students at two-year colleges through promotion and recognition of excellence in scholarship, leadership, research, and community service (Psi Beta, 2019). Our chapter regularly meets along with the Psychology Club and provides a variety of opportunities for engaging with psychology, including conducting original research, presenting at professional conferences, hosting a guest lecture series, community service, and fundraising for various community initiatives.

The Program seeks to awaken and nurture a sense of humane citizenry and community responsibility within its members. The Honors Program at QCC is the ultimate college experience. Honors courses offer the students alternative learning opportunities to enhance critical thinking skills and to better prepare students to continue their studies at colleges and universities throughout Massachusetts and the country.\n\nHonors Program Curriculum of Study\n\nFour honors classes in total (students can take more):\n\nENG 102, honors section (strongly recommended)\n\nIDS 200 Honors Colloquium (required)\n\nOne course from the honors course offerings\n\nOne course - honors section or honors by contract from the student’s program of study.\n\nStudents must obtain a grade of “B” or higher in each honors course taken to satisfy the Honors Program requirements.\n\nStudents who complete the Honors Program requirements (four classes in total, one of which must include IDS 200), and graduate with an overall QPA of 3.30 or higher, will graduate as a Commonwealth Honors Scholar, noted on their transcript.\n\nAdmission to the Commonwealth Honors Program\n\nTo be admitted to QCC’s Commonwealth Honors Program, a student must meet at least one of the following criteria:\n\nCurrent QCC students: Cumulative GPA of 3.50 (progress or final grades).\n\nNew QCC students: High School GPA of 3.7-4.0 and placement into ENG 101, and a recommended placement of MAT 099.\n\nTransfer students: In good standing from another Commonwealth Honors Program.\n\nA student who does not meet one of the above automatic admissions criteria may apply to the Honors Program Coordinator, providing other evidence of academic success, including recommendations from high school or college faculty.\n\nTo remain in good standing, and for QCC’s Honors Program to be recognized as a Commonwealth Honors Program, all students, once accepted into the Honors Program, must maintain a cumulative GPA of no less than 3.30.\n\nThe Honors Program at QCC is proud to be approved by the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education as a Commonwealth Honors Program. We are part of an integrated, collaborative system-wide network of honors programs in Massachusetts public higher education.\n\nAll potential Honors students must meet with the Honors Program Coordinator. For additional information, contact Professor Jean Kennedy-honors@qcc.mass.edu or 508.854.2744.\n\nQuinsigamond Community College (QCC) believes that everyone should have an opportunity to further their education. Whether a student strives to attain an associate degree, certificate, or select courses for personal and professional growth, our Admissions Staff will gladly help the student through every step of the process.\n\nApplicants who do not meet the minimum academic criteria for admission may still enroll at QCC. They can take courses to meet the minimum requirements as a non-degree student, or they will be admitted to the General Studies program. If a student does not wish to be admitted into the General Studies program, they must contact the QCC Admissions Office (Welcome Center, HLC, 2nd Floor) at QCC Worcester (Main Campus) at 508.854.4262 or at admissions@qcc.mass.edu.\n\nQCC has established minimum academic requirements for admission to most programs, which are designed to help assure academic success. Information about minimum requirements can be found in the Areas of Study section of this catalog.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nApply online at www.QCC.edu/enrollment-steps. Applications are also available in the QCC Admissions Office at QCC Worcester (Main Campus) at 670 West Boylston Street, Worcester, or at QCC Southbridge, or through high school guidance departments. Applicants may also contact the QCC (Worcester) Admissions Office at 508.854.4262 to request an application.\n\nSubmit the online application. Return the paper application to the QCC Admissions Office at QCC Worcester (Main Campus), or via mail to “Quinsigamond Community College, Attn: Admissions Office, 670 West Boylston Street, Worcester, MA 01606-2092”. To qualify for the In-State Resident tuition rate, applicants must certify continuous residence in Massachusetts during the six months preceding the application and be a permanent resident or citizen of the United States (U.S.). Applicants can contact the QCC Admissions Office for questions regarding the resident tuition rate.\n\nQCC requires a high school transcript, diploma, or demonstration of high school equivalency, such as the General Equivalency Development or General Equivalency Diploma (GED) test or the High School Equivalency Test (HiSET). Applicants should ask their high school to forward a transcript of their grades (including the first marking period of the senior year) directly to the QCC Admissions Office. Applicants can upload a copy of their transcript on The Q, the Student Portal, under the Admissions tab and click on Admissions Document Center or email their high school document to enrollmentprocessing@qcc.mass.edu.\n\nApplicants who have never obtained a high school diploma or the equivalency must obtain a high school equivalency in order to be accepted to the College. Applicants can contact the QCC Admissions Office for detailed information on how to enroll in the College.\n\nAdmission to Health Programs\n\nStudents who meet the established Admissions Requirements for the Health Programs (Dental Assisting, Dental Hygiene, Medical Assisting, Nurse Education, Occupational Therapy, Perioperative Nursing, Paramedic Technology, Practical Nursing, Radiologic Technology, Respiratory Care, and Surgical Technology) will be accepted on a rolling basis until the class is full. Qualified students will be given a start date for their clinical/core courses and placed on a waiting list if the program is full for the upcoming semester. Students will begin their clinical classes no later than their given start date. If a slot in an earlier semester becomes available, the student will be contacted and given an opportunity to begin sooner. While on the waitlist, if a student wishes to enroll in education courses that apply to the program, the student must contact the QCC Admissions Office.\n\nApplicants who do not meet the Admissions Requirements can still be accepted to the Healthcare program at a later term. Alternatively, they should make an appointment to meet with an Academic Advisor after acceptance who will assist them in meeting the Admissions Requirements of their chosen program.\n\nJanuary (Spring) and May (Summer) Admissions\n\nApplications for admission to the College for the Spring and Summer semesters are accepted on a rolling basis. Some programs only have a Fall start and course offerings vary from year to year. Students should visit the QCC website at www.QCC.edu for program start dates.\n\nUndeclared Students\n\nProspective students who wish to enroll in individual courses and do not wish to pursue an associate degree or certificate can enroll at QCC as an Undeclared Student. All course prerequisites apply to Undeclared Students in the same manner as degree-seeking students. Credits earned in the Undeclared Student status may be applied to an associate degree or certificate curriculum. Undeclared Students are not eligible for financial aid.\n\nTransfer Students\n\nTransfer student applicants are required to submit a high school transcript, diploma or official documentation of high school equivalency (GED or HiSET) and official college transcript. Applicants who have previously completed an undergraduate or graduate degree may provide documentation of their earned degree in lieu of high school completion.\n\nTransferring Credits\n\nApplicants who have previously attended a regionally accredited post-secondary institution and are seeking to transfer credit must submit an official college transcript issued directly to QCC from the institution where the credit was earned. Credit is awarded for courses completed with a grade of “C” or higher, provided the courses are applicable to the student’s QCC major. Credit will transfer as a QCC course equivalent or as an elective within a comparable department if an equivalent does not exist. Courses with “D” grades may also transfer if the student’s Quality Point Average (QPA) is 2.00 or higher at the institution from which they are transferring. However, “D” grades are only accepted in lower sequence courses and only if they have completed the upper sequence of the same course with a grade of “C” or higher at the transfer institution. A formal transfer credit evaluation is prepared for students upon their acceptance to QCC. Submission of course descriptions or syllabi from previously attended institutions may also be required for the purpose of performing a transfer credit evaluation.\n\nFor credits earned at international institutions, the College will follow the guidelines established by National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES). Students must request a “course by course” evaluation of transcripts from institutions outside the U.S. from a credential evaluation service that is a current member of NACES and is subject to approval by the VP of Academic Affairs.\n\nTransferred credits count as earned credit hours only. No quality points or grades are transferred or calculated in the student’s QPA. A minimum of 25% of the credit hours in the degree or certificate being conferred is required to fulfill the College residency requirement.\n\nApproval of transfer credit may be authorized by the Registrar’s Office or academic deans. For more information, contact the QCC Registrar’s Office at registrar@qcc.mass.edu (Room 152, Administration Building).\n\nCampus Tours\n\nBoth individual and group campus tours of QCC Worcester (Main Campus) are available. To schedule a tour, please visit www.QCC.edu/campus-tours, or contact the QCC Admissions Office at admissions@qcc.mass.edu.\n\nState Immunization Requirements\n\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts, General Law105CMR 220.600 requires QCC to collect proof of immunizations from the following students:\n\nAll full-time students (12 or more credits) under 30 years of age and\n\nAll health science students – both full-time and part-time (note that health profession programs will require additional health records and requirements**)\n\nAll students on a student or other visa - both full-time and part-time (including foreign exchange students and those students visiting or attending classes while on academic visitation or exchange program).\n\nAll of the student groups noted must submit proof of immunizations for the following: measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); hepatitis B; varicella (chickenpox); tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap); Meningococcal ACWY is also required for students age 21 or younger.\n\nPlease note that positive titers for measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, and varicella will also meet the state requirement.\n\nHealthcare students will need to provide records for immunizations/titers/and health documents. These are required before attending clinical. Positive titers are required for healthcare students.\n\nFor questions on immunizations please reach out to immunizations@qcc.mass.edu.\n\nPlacement\n\nQCC currently uses multiple measures to help place students into appropriate courses in Mathematics and English. These measures might include:\n\nHigh school transcript or most recent report card, showing overall GPA\n\nCollege transcripts or previous QCC courses and grades\n\nAP test scores, SAT or ACT test scores\n\nHiSET or GED test scores\n\nMathematics Assessment\n\nEnglish Self-Assessment\n\nQCC recommends that students work with an academic advisor to determine their individual need for college placement assessment into Mathematics and English courses.\n\nQCC divides the College Placement Assessment into two parts, one for Mathematics and one for English. Students may need to complete either or both of the placement assessments as determined by program choice and by past educational experience. The Mathematics assessment is a computer-based, multiple-choice test, and it will take students no more than two (2) hours to complete. The English placement assessment is self-guided, and it will take students no more than 30 minutes to complete. Once the desired assessments are complete, students will discuss the results with an advisor before registering for their Mathematics and English courses.\n\nHigh School Equivalency Test\n\nMassachusetts and QCC now offer both GED and HiSET testing. Both tests provide students the opportunity to earn a high school credential. This credential is recognized as a key to employment opportunities, career advancement, and further education.\n\nBoth tests are offered at QCC at the Healthcare and Workforce Development Center, 25 Federal Street, Worcester, Room 114D.\n\nTo learn about the tests, apply for accommodations, or schedule a test appointment, visit the HiSET website at www.hiset.org, or the GED website at www.ged.com. Questions about testing may be directed to the QCC Testing Office, 508.854.2784 or testing@qcc.mass.edu.\n\nTest takers who are under the age of 18 must contact the state office before registering for either test. Please call 781.338.6625.\n\nNot ready to take the test? Looking for a free HiSET/GED preparatory class? Contact the Adult Community Learning Center at 508.751.7926, aclc@qcc.mass.edu, or visit www.QCC.edu/ACLC.\n\nNew England Regional Student Program\n\nQCC participates in the New England Regional Student Program (RSP), which provides tuition savings every year to thousands of New England residents. Students from any of the six New England states can receive the Massachusetts in-state tuition rate plus 50 percent. Contact the QCC Admissions Office for specific details. Information is also available at www.nebhe.org.\n\nHomeschooled Students\n\nAll homeschooled students, without a high school diploma or equivalent, are eligible to apply for admission to an associate degree or certificate program provided they have successfully completed an approved homeschool program in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws or the laws of their home state. If a homeschooled student has not completed an approved homeschool program, the student should contact the QCC Admissions Office.\n\nTo determine whether a student has participated in an approved homeschool program, the student shall submit, with the application for admission, evidence that the homeschool program was approved by the superintendent or school committee of the student’s school district. Additionally, if the homeschooled student is under the age of compulsory attendance, which is 16 years old in Massachusetts, a letter from the student’s school district’s superintendent or school committee is required, stating that the student is not considered truant and would not be required to attend further schooling or continue to be homeschooled, if the student has completed their homeschool program before the age of 16.\n\nThe College reserves the right to limit or deny enrollment of a student under the age of 16 in a course or program based on this case-by-case consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: the student’s maturity, life experience, placement test scores, prior education, course content, instructional methodology, and risks associated with a particular course or program.\n\nInternational Students\n\nInternational Students must use the International Student Application at www.QCC.edu/international-students. Deadlines are July 1 for the Fall semester and November 1 for the Spring semester.\n\nIf transferring from another American institution, International Students must submit the admissions application at least 60 days before the beginning of the semester. Only students who have a secondary school diploma or who have passed an equivalency test - and can speak, read, write and understand English well enough to take a full-time program - will be considered for admission. If a student’s native language is not English, he or she will be asked to demonstrate their ability to understand English. International Students must demonstrate adequate financial support for the time they will be attending QCC. Financial support can be verified by providing a certificate of finances or a certification of sponsorship. International Students who have student visas are required to enroll in a minimum of 12 credits during each semester. Information about International Student regulations, admission, and fees are available from the QCC Admissions Office.\n\nFor additional information about International Student regulations, admission, and fees, please visit www.QCC.edu/international-students, email international@qcc.mass.edu or visit the QCC Admissions Office on the main campus. Financial support can be verified by providing a certificate of finances or a certification of sponsorship, AND a bank statement documenting sufficient available funds.\n\nCareer Vocational Technical Education (CVTE) Linkages/Chapter 74 Articulation Agreements\n\nQCC has established agreements with local comprehensive and vocational/technical high schools to assist students in making the transition to higher education. Some of these agreements come under the state’s Chapter 74 Articulation Agreements or programs. All agreements state the conditions and criteria that must be met by graduating high school students in order to receive advanced placement and college credit.\n\nFor more information contact Nicole Fortin at 508.854.2838 or nfortin@qcc.mass.edu.\n\nEarly College Programs\n\nEarly College Programs are offered to more than 20 high schools in Central Massachusetts. Early College Programs provide students with the opportunity to earn 12 or more college credits along with earning a high school diploma. In addition to earning 12 or more college credits, students can choose career pathway courses that lead them to earn a QCC Certificate or Associate Degree along with a high school diploma. Once the course or courses are completed, a college transcript is created. Most of the courses students take are Massachusetts transferrable, or fit into the “MassTransfer Block,” which satisfies general education/distribution/core requirements across Massachusetts institutions. Taking advantage of QCC’s credit course offerings enable students to get a “jump start” on college access, in addition to saving time and money. Students must meet all course prerequisite or corequisites, if required.\n\nFor more information contact Christina Hebert at 508.854.2853 or chebert@qcc.mass.edu.\n\nAttend College Early\n\nQCC offers the Attend College Early program to local high school districts that wish to allow their current students the opportunity to complete high school graduation requirements through concurrent enrollment at QCC. Participation in this program is available to high school seniors and juniors who have been properly prepared for appropriate college level work. High school guidance counselors are expected to lead in the process of identifying potential applicants and assisting students with the application process. In addition, coursework to be taken at QCC is determined collaboratively by the students and appropriate high school guidance personnel; it is the responsibility of the student and parent to consult with the Guidance Office and Principal to ensure that courses selected will meet the requirements for high school graduation.\n\nCriteria for Acceptance\n\nTo be eligible for acceptance into the Attend College Early Program, a student must meet the following criteria:\n\nBe currently enrolled in high school\n\nHave completed high school English courses with grades of “B” or higher\n\nHave an overall “B” average\n\nDemonstrate satisfactory disciplinary history in his/her student profile\n\nPlace into ENG 101 and MAT 095 on the College Placement Test\n\nComplete the Attend College Early Program application process within the established timelines\n\nFor more information, contact Admissions Office for criteria for acceptance.\n\nFuture Focus Program\n\nThe Future Focus Program is designed specifically for nontraditional students and adult learners. It provides financial assistance with tuition, fees, textbook costs, and other required materials for college. The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (MA DESE) funds the program. The program offers a foundation of services within QCC that enable adult learners to transition into and, ultimately, complete postsecondary education.\n\nFor more information, contact the Future Focus Program at 508.854.2876 or email Futurefocus@qcc.mass.edu.\n\nGateway to College\n\ngtcinfo@qcc.mass.edu\n\nQuinsigamond Community College Gateway to College program connects at risk students or students who have dropped out of high school to an alternative dual enrollment program in which students take their classes on the college campus and earn credits for and towards their high school diploma. It is a rigorous dual enrollment alternative option and students are generally taking a college course load that is not modified. GTC students work with staff, faculty, and supportive family in a cohort type environment.\n\nReadmission to the College\n\nStudents who have previously attended QCC and have not attended the College for two consecutive semesters, either due to withdrawal or academic failure, must apply to be readmitted. Students must submit a new application.\n\nUpon academic failure, or withdrawing from a health or high demand program, students are required to meet with their Program Coordinator to establish guidelines for readmission. Students will be considered only once for readmission to all health programs. Specific steps for readmission can be obtained in the QCC Admissions Office or from the appropriate academic department. Students must submit a new application. Depending on the length of time since their last enrolled semester at QCC, they may also need to submit another document proving high school graduation or equivalency.\n\nProgram Admissions Requirements\n\nA High School Transcript/Diploma, GED/HiSET Scores, or college transcript from a U.S. institution is required for admission to all programs at QCC. If students want to transfer academic credits or degree equivalency evaluation from a university abroad, they will need an evaluation agency (such as WES or CED) to assess their transcript.\n\nAny applicant who does not meet the minimum program admissions requirements should contact the QCC Admissions Office to schedule an interview with an Admissions Counselor. Upon review of one’s academic background and a consultation with the appropriate academic department, the student will be informed if their background is equivalent to the program admissions requirements. For additional information and acceptance criteria, contact the QCC Admissions Office.\n\nTetteh Abbeyquaye, Professor of Chemistry\n\nB.S., The University of Birmingham, Uk; Ph.D., Clark University\n\nBenedicta Aboagye, Financial Aid Counselor\n\nA.A., Quinsigamond Community College\n\nJessica Ahrens, President’s Assistant for Engagement & Initiatives\n\nA.A., Florida Southwestern State College; B.A., Thomas Edison State University; M.A., Sit Graduate Institute\n\nFatin Alkhaledi, Assistant Professor of Engineering Technology\n\nA.A., Quinsigamond Community College; B.A., Worcester Polytechnic Institute; M.S., Northcentral University\n\nMichaela Almeida, Associate Professor of Elementary Education Transfer Option/Coordinator of The General Studies - Elementary Education Transfer Option\n\nM.Ed., Worcester State University\n\nSusan Amos, Dese Instructor & Instructional Designer for Esol\n\nB.A., Indiana University; M.f.a., Rutgers University\n\nThomas anderson, Painter II/Facilities\n\nKarl anderson, Professor of English\n\nB.A., University Massachusetts-Lowell; M.A., Northeastern University\n\nClovis andreu, Systems Analyst/Programmer\n\nB.S., B.S., Fitchburg State University\n\nLisa Antonelli, Professor of Biology/Coordinator of The Healthcare Biology Program\n\nA.B., Smith College; D.m.d., University of Pennsylvania\n\nJen Arner Welsh, Professor of Psychology\n\nB.A., Earlham College; M.A., Clark University; Ph.D., Clark University\n\nJill Arrell, Lead Teacher/Early Childhood Education Lab School\n\nA.S., Quinsigamond Commuity College; B.S., Worcester State University; M.Ed., American International College\n\nBenjamin Ashu, Research Analyst\n\nM.A., Southern University At New Orleans\n\nJoseph Babu, Professor of Mathematics\n\nB.ed., Kenyatta University; B.S., Coppin State College; M.S., University of Massachusetts-Lowell\n\nBrian Bandalewicz, Microsoft Systems Administrator\n\nA.S., Quinsigamond Community College\n\nRichard Banks, Clerk III/Nurse Education\n\nMendrick Banzuela, Program Administrator/office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nB.S., Worcester State University\n\nSamantha Basler, Assistant Comptroller\n\nB.S.
