After years of blood, sweat and tears, participating in the most prestigious athletic event in the world is a once-in-a-lifetime moment. Some athletes compete one time in the Olympic Games and hang up their hats, stepping gracefully into retirement. Some, however, spend their days training to return to the competition. And others, of course, split their time between athletic passion and real-life responsibilities. Alpine skier Ted Ligety, for example, competed in four consecutive Winter Olympic Games. But the athlete does not only dedicate time and energy to the sport; he also has a family. “My wife and I have been together for eight-ish years, give or take now, and she has been traveling with me now for the last bunch of years, so that’s really good,” he told Us Weekly exclusively in February 2018, prior to competing in the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea. “I’m traveling so much that it would be impossible to have a relationship when you’re that far away for that many years and it’s good.” Ligety and his wife, Mia Pascoe, have also learned to balance raising a child on the road. “Having [son Jax is] a new adventure,” he noted. “My life has changed a lot in the last couple years.” [sendtonews type=\"float\" key=\"B0cDhkCxh9-3105220-14453\"] Swimmer Nathan Adrian, for his part, was forced to step away from his sport when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. “After a few tests and visits with a specialist, I unfortunately learned that I have Testicular Cancer,” he announced via Instagram in January 2019. “On the bright side, we caught it early, I have already started treatment and the prognosis is good.” The eight-time Olympic medalist assured fans that he would fight the illness and still had his “sights fully set on Tokyo,” where the 2020 Games were set to be held. Adrian underwent two operations, avoiding chemotherapy amid his recovery. He did not qualify for the 2020 Olympics, which were postponed to 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic. “As long as I have your attention and people are listening, my message is this: find your passion and pursue it with your heart, mind, and soul. No matter the outcome, it is worth it and you will be closer to the person you want to be on the other side,” he wrote via Instagram in June 2021. “Go USA!!!” Keep scrolling to see the progress of more Olympians throughout the years!

Brown/Getty Images\n\nCaitlyn Jenner: Now\n\nAfter being plagued by rumors for more than a year, the former athlete came out as a transgender woman during a 20/20 special with Diane Sawyer in April 2015. Five minutes into the program, Jenner revealed, \"For all intents and purposes, I am a woman.\" Jenner later introduced her new self, Caitlyn Jenner, on the cover of Vanity Fair's July 2015 issue. She later starred on her own E! reality series, I Am Cait, which documented her life following her transition.\n\nIn April 2021, Jenner announced that she was officially entering the race for California Governor, which she lost that September.\n\nCredit: Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images\n\nGabby Douglas: Now\n\nSince winning gold at the 2012 Olympics, the gymnast has continued to dominate in her sport. She won several medals in various competitions in 2015, and two more gold medals in 2016. She competed again at the 2018 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she helped the U.S.A. win its second consecutive gold medal in the team event.\n\nIn November 2017, Douglas bravely came forward about her experience with former U.S.A. Gymnastics national team doctor, Larry Nassar, who has been accused of sexual abuse by more than 200 women. In January 2018, he was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison.\n\nDouglas competed on the first season of Masked Dancer and was declared the winner in 2020.\n\nCredit: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nRyan Lochte: Now\n\nLochte briefly starred on his own E! reality series, What Would Ryan Locate Do?, which followed his journey to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio. The athlete helped teammates Michael Phelps, Conor Dwyer and Townley Haas bring home a gold medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, and came in fifth in 200-meter individual medley.\n\nHe made headlines during the Games after he and teammate Jimmy Feigen falsely stated that they were robbed in Rio during a night out. The former reality star later admitted that he “over-exaggerated that story,” which later became known as Lochtegate. U.S.A. Swimming suspended Lochte from domestic and international competitions for 14 months as a result. The former Dancing With the Stars contestant called the situation “the hardest time” of his life during a February 2019 episode of Celebrity Big Brother.\n\nAlthough Lochte’s professional journey has been filled with struggles, his personal life has flourished. He and model Kayla Reid welcomed a son named Caiden in June 2017, and the coupled tied the knot in a civil ceremony seven months later. In November 2018, they announced they were expecting baby No. 2, a little girl. They welcomed their daughter, Liv Rae, in June 2019.\n\nCredit: Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n\nHope Solo: Now\n\nThe Solo: A Memoir of Hope author married former NFL star Jerramy Stevens in November 2012 after leading her team to a second Olympic gold medal at the London Games. The following year, she helped the U.S. team win the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup and received the Golden Glove trophy for being the best goalie. She considered sitting out the 2016 Summer Games due to concerns about the Zika virus, but ultimately decided to try for a third gold medal. The U.S.A. lost to Sweden in the quarterfinals, however, and Solo’s response made waves.\n\nFollowing the match, the athlete called the Swedish team “a bunch of cowards” for their style of play. She was subsequently suspended by U.S.A. Soccer for six months and her national team contract was terminated.\n\nIn April 2020, Solo welcomed twins, Vittorio and Lozen, with Stevens after previously having a miscarriage.\n\nCredit: Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nShawn Johnson: Now\n\nJohnson announced her retirement from competitive gymnastics in June 2012 after a knee injury that stopped her from competing for a spot at the London Olympics. She was 20 years old. “My body is to the point where I need to rest and retire so I can be healthy for the rest of my life,” she told the Associated Press at the time.\n\nThe gold medalist married football player Andrew East, with whom she shares a successful YouTube channel, in April 2016. The pair suffered a miscarriage in October 2017, but announced in April 2019 that they were expecting again.
