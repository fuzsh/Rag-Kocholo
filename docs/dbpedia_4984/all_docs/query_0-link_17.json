        "text": "Turner claimed his second major bronze of 2006 in Sweden\n\nNathan Douglas and Andy Turner added to Britain's medal tally on day six of the European Championships in Gothenburg.\n\nDouglas leapt to 17.21m to take triple jump silver behind Olympic champion and home favourite Christian Olsson while Andy Turner took 110m hurdle bronze.\n\nBritain's 4x400m and 4x100m relay squads all reached Sunday's finals with the 4x100m men particularly impressive.\n\nGoldie Sayers squeezed into Sunday's javelin finale but Jo Pavey finished fourth in the 5,000m.\n\nDAY SIX ACTION (all times BST)\n\nWOMEN'S MARATHON\n\nGerman Ulrike Maisch ran a well-judged race to win the marathon in a personal best time of two hours 30.02 minutes.\n\nShe kept a steady rhythm to close down longtime Russian leader Irina Permitina after 24 miles.\n\nThe Russian had amassed a 15-second lead over the field with just over six miles to go but struggled to close out the race and did well to hang on for bronze.\n\nSerbian Olivera Jevtic crossed the line 26 seconds behind Maisch, a solider in the German army, to take silver.\n\nMarathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe said: \"Maisch delivered an astounding performance. She stayed focused and ran her own race - it's a big step forward for her.\"\n\nBritain's Tracey Morris endured a difficult race and came home in 16th.\n\nMEN'S TRIPLE JUMP\n\nOlympic champion Christian Olsson leapt to a modest 17.20m in the first round but was the man to beat in front of his adoring home fans.\n\nHe proved it by reaching 17.67m in the second round to bring the crowd to their feet and that mark was good enough for him to win the title in the town of his birth.\n\nBritian's Nathan Douglas reached 17.12m with his third attempt to climb to second but bettered that in the next round, reaching 17.21m to guarantee himself silver.\n\n\"I'm relieved and happy. It's been a long and hard year for me,\" said the Brit.\n\nDouglas initially pushed team-mate Phillips Idowu out of the medals but he fell further back and finished a disappointing fifth.\n\nRomania's Marian Oprea completed the podium spot with a leap of 17.18m.\n\nWOMEN'S 4X400M RELAY\n\nGreat Britain won the second semi-final to confidently move through into Sunday's final with a time of three minutes 27.92 seconds.\n\nEmma Duck ran a hard first lap to hand on to 800m specialist Jenny Meadows. Another 800m specialist Marilyn Okoro ran a solid leg to put anchor Lee McConnell into a strong position.\n\nMcConnell said afterwards: \"We came here looking for a medal and we have every chance.\n\n\"Some teams are stronger than we anticipated but we'll have Nicola Sanders back for the final.\"\n\nRussia remain overwhelming favourites to add the European title to world gold after cruising through their semi-final in dominant fashion.\n\nBelarus qualified in second and the Ukraine third with German and Bulgaria filling those places in the second semi.\n\nMEN'S 4X400M RELAY\n\nGreat Britain are the defending champions and proved their title credentials with a controlled victory to ease into the final.\n\nRob Tobin got the quartet away before handing on to 400m hurdle bronze medallist Rhys Williams, who pulled clear away at the break.\n\nGraham Hedman and Tim Benjamin finished off the work to cross the line in three minutes 02.51 seconds.\n\nBenjamin said after the race: \"We're looking forward to the final and I'm sure this performance will lift us.\n\n\"It was great to cross the line first for a change and we'll try our best tomorrow.\"\n\nRussia followed Britain home ahead of France, who ran without their dangermen 400m gold medallist Marc Raquil and Leslie Djhone.\n\nGermany, Poland and Romania advanced to the final as automatic qualifiers in the first semi-final.\n\nMEN'S 4X100M RELAY\n\nGreat Britain looked in good shape as they won the first semi-final in 38.77 seconds to reach the final.\n\nDwain Chambers got the quartet off to a solid start before handing on safely to Darren Campbell.\n\n200m bronze medallist Marlon Devonish ran a good bend to set Mark Lewis-Francis free, who eased past Italy and Germany.\n\nBritain were stripped of the relay title they won in 2002 after Chambers' positive drugs test and are out to make amends.\n\nFrance, who won the other heat in 38.85, are likely to be the biggest threat.\n\nWOMEN'S 4X100M RELAY\n\nGreat Britain got away with some messy changeovers to reach Sunday's final as one of the fastest losers.\n\nThe quartet of Anyika Onuora, Emily Freeman, Laura Turner and Joice Maduaka crossed the line in 44.00 seconds.\n\n\"We just wanted to get the baton round and lay the foundations,\" said Maduaka. \"It's cool and we'll go for it in the final.\"\n\nFrance were the fastest qualifiers in 43.38 ahead of Germany (43.49) and Russia (43.65).\n\nWOMEN'S 5,000M\n\nSpain's defending champion Marta Dominguez unleashed a burst of speed to win her second straight title in a new championship record of 14 minutes 56.17 seconds.\n\nRussian Liliya Shobukhova overtook Briton Jo Pavey on the top bend but was eclipsed 200m later and had to settle for silver with Turkey's Elvan Abeylesgesse third.\n\nPavey, who had taken Commonwealth silver, agonisingly finished in fourth.\n\nBelarussian Volha Kravtsova set the pace in the early stages of the race, which was fairly pedestrian through the first six laps.\n\nPavey does not run comfortably off a slow pace and it was no surprise when she took up the lead on the very next lap.\n\nThe 32-year-old did not do enough, however, as a trio of athletes loomed on her shoulder and eventually pushed her out of the medals.\n\nMEN'S 110M HURDLES\n\nLatvian Olijar Stanislav finished in first place ahead of German Thomas Blaschek and Britain's Andy Turner to decide the medals.\n\nStanislav clocked 13.24 to better the silver he won four years ago in Munich.\n\nTurner got off to a bad start but bravely pulled himself back into contention to take a deserved third in 13.52.\n\n\"I'm really pleased,\" said Turner. \"To take two medals in one season is a good start.\n\n\"The race was scratchy, but who cares? I'm not bothered.\"\n\nFrench world champion Ladji Doucoure went out in the semi-finals and appeared to aggravate his calf muscle as he limped over the line fifth\n\nA nervous-looking David Hughes of Britain smacked a series of hurdles to come home in last place in the first semi-final.\n\nWOMEN'S 3,000M STEEPLECHASE\n\nBelarussian Alesia Turava captured the inaugural European crown with a competent victory.\n\nShe pushed clear of her rivals at the bell and never looked like being caught as she won in nine minutes 26.05 seconds.\n\nAlesia's gold is the second for the Turava family as her sister Ryta won the 20km walk on Wednesday.\n\nRussian Tatyana Petrova try to run Turava down but had to settle for silver with Poland's world number one Wioletta Janowska taking bronze.\n\nWOMEN'S JAVELIN\n\nCzech Barbara Spotakova and German world bronze medallist Steffi Nerius both advanced to Sunday's final from from the first group of qualifiers.\n\nSpotakova set a national record of 66.12m to qualify while Steffi Nerius advanced with 63.35m.\n\nEuropean number one Christina Obergfoll went through with a mark of 60.06m and there was good news for Britain's Goldie Sayers, who qualified in last place with 58.65m.\n\nMEN'S DISCUS\n\nLithuania's double Olympic champion Virgilijus Alekna lived up to his favourite's tag, scooping the European title with his opening throw of 68.67m.\n\nEstonia's Gerd Kantner, carried his good form through from qualifying to take silver in 68.03m ahead of compatriot Aleksander Tammert, who landed 66.14m.\n\nGerman veteran Lars Riedel, a five-time world champion, finished eighth.\n\nWOMEN'S SHOT PUT\n\nBelarussian Natallia Khoroneko took gold with her fourth-round throw of 19.43m.\n\nCompatriot and world number one Nadzeya Ostapchuk took silver with a throw of 19.42m while German Petra Lammert, who led the early stages of the competition, hung on to bronze with 19.06m.\n\nWOMEN'S POLE VAULT\n\nOlympic and world champion Yelena Isinbayeva may not be in record-breaking form so far this season but she hardly broke a sweat as she took gold.\n\nThe Russian relaxed on the grass as the competition went on around her before emerging from her tracksuit to clear 4.60m with her first attempt.\n\nIsinbayeva was the only athlete to clear 4.70m and went on to go over at 4.80m.\n\nHer training partner Monika Pyrek took silver with 4.65m on countback as Tatyana Polnova finished third at the same height.\n\nMEN'S HAMMER\n\nWorld champion Ivan Tikhon threw a season's best 81.11m to notch up his first victory of the season and take gold.\n\nFinn Olli-Pekka Karjalainen prevented a Belarussian one-two as he grabbed silver, reaching 80.84m to push world number one Vadim Devyatovski into third with 80.76m.\n\nKarjalainen looked like he had produced a last-gasp winning throw but his foot just clipped the barrier as he released the hammer so it did not count."
