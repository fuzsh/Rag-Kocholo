        "text": "Jonathan Edwards seemed to have it made. An Olympic champion and still the triple jump world\n\nrecord holder, he had appeared to move seamlessly from an athletics career which brought him fame and wealth to a new vocation as a broadcaster and respected spokesman for his sport.\n\nBut the dream life is an illusion. The reality is that the man who enthralled the nation when he captured the world record on an August night in Gothenburg in 1995 admits that he is still dealing with the after-shock of retirement four years after ending his illustrious career.\n\nScroll down to read more:\n\nHis confession is a salutary insight into an\n\nathlete’s dilemma when the time arrives to\n\ndepart their train-eat-rest-travel-competesleep\n\nworld to be confronted with the daily\n\ngrind of real life.\n\n\"I was the best in the world at something,\n\nend of story,\" said Edwards. \"Retirement is very\n\ntraumatic. You stop doing what you love,\n\nwhat you’re very good at, the thing that has\n\ngiven you your identity.\n\n\"You have to start again — at a time when\n\nyour contemporaries are nearing the peak of\n\ntheir professional lives, you are over the hill.\n\nHow do you prepare for life after being an\n\nathlete? No one gives you a job and you don’t\n\nnecessarily have the skills needed.\"\n\nEdwards accepts that his experiences have\n\nbeen cushioned by the fact of who he is. \"I was\n\nin a more fortunate position than most,\" he\n\nsaid. \"There are lots of athletes who, perhaps,\n\nwouldn’t have had the success or the profile I\n\nenjoyed. Or made the money I earned. Even\n\nso, it’s such a shock to the system.\n\n\"If you sat down with any psychologist, he’d\n\nsay that you are on a rocky road afterwards.\n\nWhat would happen if someone told a world renowned concert pianist that the music was\n\nno longer going to flow through his fingers at\n\n35?\n\n\"Triple jumping is less artistic than pianoplaying, but you still face a loss of psychological and emotional security. You enter a much greyer world, full of uncertainties.\"\n\nEdwards, 41 and a father of two, is not the\n\nfirst, nor will he be the last, to be perplexed by stepping outside the routine that has governed\n\nhis life from adolescence. He may not\n\nhave been beset by the demons that tortured\n\nthe likes of footballers George Best and Paul\n\nGascoigne, but since his retirement Edwards\n\nhas suffered by losing the faith that was once\n\nthe cornerstone of his existence.\n\nHe is the man who for some time refused to\n\ncompete on a Sunday, who throughout his\n\ncareer claimed his success bore witness\n\nto God, and who once declared: \"It is\n\nmore important to me to be a faithful\n\nfollower of Christ than an all-conquering\n\nsportsman.\"\n\nLast week, as he talked\n\ncandidly about the way he\n\ncame to be seen as the\n\nmost famous Christian in\n\nsport, Edwards said: \"I\n\ndon’t regret or feel embarrassed\n\nby what I said. It was very much\n\nwhere I was at in a very heartfelt way.\"\n\nNonetheless, just over two months\n\nago, Edwards quit his role as a presenter\n\nof BBC’s Songs of Praise, a job that\n\nhad cemented his place in the heart of\n\nmiddle England, because he no longer\n\nfelt comfortable being publicly associated\n\nwith the Christian faith.\n\n\"I don’t claim to fully understand\n\nwhat I’m feeling, other than to\n\nacknowledge that something I never\n\ndoubted — God — I have huge\n\ndoubts about now,\" he revealed.\n\nEdwards grew up in a vicarage in\n\nDevon and he is sensitive not to offend\n\nthose closest to him. His father Andy,\n\nwho retires as a vicar this summer, his\n\nmother, Jill, and his wife, Alison, are all\n\nChristians.On occasions he still accompanies\n\nAlison and their sons, Sam, 13,\n\nand Nathan, 11, to church near their\n\nhome in a plush suburb of Newcastle.\n\n\"This is a hugely complex and deeply\n\npersonal issue,\" he said. \"I think a basic\n\nsense of morality is shared by people of\n\nall faiths and none. It would be stupid\n\nfor me to sit here and say that losing my faith didn’t have anything to do\n\nwith my retirement. Perhaps I had\n\nbeen shielded from doubt because I\n\nhad such a highly focused life as an\n\nathlete. Then, I asked a few questions\n\nthat I hadn’t asked before.\"\n\nHad a change of lifestyle, allowing\n\nhim more freedom to socialise than\n\nwhen he was an athlete,\n\nimpacted on him? \"Not at all,\"\n\nsaid Edwards. \"I’m not a\n\nmassive socialiser.We have\n\na close family and close\n\nfriends. But I cannot help it\n\nif I was stereotyped as a\n\nstrait-laced Christian — that\n\nwas because no one really\n\nknew me.\"\n\nThe pain cuts deep but\n\nEdwards has drawn comfort\n\nfrom those around him. \"My\n\nparents are fine,and this summer\n\nthey will retire to the little\n\nhouse we own in the Lake\n\nDistrict,\" he said. \"Alison has\n\nbeen very supportive.\n\n\"In a way, it’s not a bad thing\n\nthat my position is now public\n\nbecause I felt uncomfortable\n\nwith the expectation\n\naround me. I’m sure there are a\n\nlot of things people think but will\n\nnever say to me. But, then, that’s\n\nalways been the case. I am who I\n\nam, regardless of whether I believe\n\nor not.\"\n\nEdwards is a man for whom his\n\nfamily and the sport of athletics are\n\nparamount. Since he retired, he has\n\nshared skiing holidays with Alison, who\n\ndetests flying, and their sons. \"Alison’s\n\ngot the ski bug like the rest of us and\n\nshe’s been happy to get on a plane to\n\nget to the mountains,\" he\n\nsaid, chuckling.\n\nHis love of athletics\n\nhas led him to gain influence\n\nwithin sport’s corridors\n\nof power. His voice, as\n\nathletes’ representative, is\n\nheard on the board of the\n\nLondon Olympics and last\n\nweek he manned the barricades\n\nin defence of their\n\ncontroversial logo for the\n\n2012 Games.\n\nFrom tomorrow,\n\nhe will\n\ntake his seat\n\nwithin the chamber of the European\n\nAthletics’ Council and he is regarded as\n\nintegral to the BBC’s coverage of track\n\nand field. He is rewarded for his work\n\nwith 2012, for whom he also acts as an\n\nambassador, but stressed: \"I get paid,\n\nbut not at commercial rates, as this is\n\nsomething I’m passionately connected\n\nwith.\"\n\nTo Edwards, who competed at four\n\nOlympics from 1988 until he won gold\n\nin Sydney in 2000, the Games offer\n\nBritain an unprecedented chance for\n\nchange. \"Figures show that young\n\npeople haven’t been engaging with the\n\nGames in a way they did 20-30 years\n\nago,\" he said. \"In this country,the people\n\nwho most love the Olympics have\n\nmemories of Seb Coe, Steve Ovett and\n\nDaley Thompson and Steve Redgrave.\"\n\nThe landscape of British athletics is\n\nlooking barren ahead of the World\n\nChampionships in Osaka, Japan, in\n\nAugust.\n\n\"You can’t deny that it’s a hard\n\ntime for the sport in this country,\"\n\nadmitted Edwards. \"Last year there\n\nwasn’t a British athlete ranked in the\n\ntop five in any event. At the world\n\nchampionships, UK Athletics are projecting\n\nhaving 14 finalists and winning\n\nthree medals. But they don’t exclude\n\nrelays, so there is a reality Britain could\n\nwin just one individual medal at the\n\nworlds.\"\n\nEdwards senses that not even Paula\n\nRadcliffe, the one golden star connecting\n\nBritish athletics to a more glittering\n\nheritage, can be relied on to deliver in\n\nOsaka.\n\n\"We don’t even know for sure\n\nthat Paula will compete at the World Championships,\" said Edwards. Radcliffe,\n\nwho sustained an injury after\n\nreturning to training following the birth\n\nof her first child in January, has yet to\n\nannounce a comeback date and\n\nEdwards warned: \"We don’t know for\n\nsure if Paula will ever be as good as\n\nshe was.\"\n\nTo his mind, medal chances will be\n\nrationed this summer. \"The triple jump\n\nremains probably our strongest event,\"\n\nhe said.\n\n\"Phillips Idowu won Commonwealth\n\ngold and the European indoor championship,\n\nalthough Olympic champion\n\nChristian Olsson wasn’t there. But\n\nPhillips still has a question-mark\n\nagainst him in major championships.\n\n\"Nathan Douglas is pushing him. He\n\nhas a good technique, smooth and flowing, and the potential to jump as\n\nfar as Idowu. Kelly Sotherton and Jessica\n\nEnnis could be competing with one\n\nanother for the bronze at the world\n\nchampionships.\n\n\"Both have problems\n\nwith their throws, Kelly in the javelin\n\nand Jessica with javelin and shot-putt.\n\nJessica has more time on her side and\n\nshe’s working with Daley Thompson,\n\nwho will have a positive influence.\n\n\"Goldie Sayer has shown in the last\n\ntwo javelin competitions that she could\n\nbe close to a medal in Osaka and\n\nNicola Sanders has shown her potential\n\nindoors at the Europeans. Craig\n\nPickering ran really well in Glasgow\n\nlast week but there are some scarily\n\ngood sprinters around the world.\n\n\"All this just reflects the reality that\n\nathletics isn’t the same draw as a sport\n\nas it was 15-20 years ago. When I\n\nstarted in 1987, footballers weren’t\n\nearning exorbitant salaries.\n\n\"I remember\n\nNiall Quinn telling me he was getting\n\n£100 a week as an Arsenal player.\n\nYou’d only see one football match on\n\nTV a week, if you were lucky. Sky and\n\nthe Premiership have changed all that.\n\nEven so, this is the magic of 2012 —\n\nan opportunity to\n\nattract fresh talent to\n\nwhat I believe is the\n\ngreatest Olympic sport.\"\n\nOn Friday Edwards is\n\nguest of honour at the\n\nBislet Games in Oslo, a\n\nmeeting renowned for\n\nthe record-breaking\n\nnights of Coe, Ovett and\n\nCram in the Dream Mile.\n\nEdwards acknowledges\n\nthat perceptions of him\n\nwere often of a less heroic\n\norder.\n\n\"I think people looked at\n\nme and saw a skinny little\n\nwhite guy and thought: 'If\n\nhe can jump 18.29metres,\n\nso can I',\" said Edwards,\n\nwith a chuckle. \"Dwain\n\nChambers said you can’t\n\nwin a gold medal without\n\ntaking drugs, but I know\n\nfrom personal experience that that is\n\npatent nonsense. I hope everyone with\n\nan ounce of sense knows that, too.\n\n\"Dwain is a guy I once had time for, but\n\nhim having a crack at the sport from\n\nthe sidelines of American Footballwas\n\nvery undignified. Drug-testing procedures\n\nare more sophisticated than ever\n\nand the sport is cleaner than it has ever\n\nbeen.\"\n\nIt is a source of undisguised\n\npride to Edwards that the triple\n\njump world record he set\n\nalmost 12 years ago remains\n\nunbroken. \"My Olympic gold\n\nmedal is important,\" he said,\n\n\"but I am proudest of that world record\n\njump. It still connects me to athletics.\n\nTo be honest, on the day that it is\n\nfinally broken, I won’t be doing a jig!\"\n\nSpiritual upheaval has taken a toll on\n\nEdwards but his reputation as an\n\nOlympic champion burns brightly as\n\nhe aspires to help make London 2012\n\nan unforgettable event. The controversy\n\nover the Games logo will be\n\nshort-lived, he says.\n\n\"I’m not going to sit here and lie that\n\nit’s been the best week in the life of the\n\nLondon organisers,\" said Edwards. \"The\n\ngeneral public may think: '£400,000 for\n\na few squiggles, what’s all that about?'\n\n\"But I don’t think there’s any question\n\nthat this logo will survive. It will come\n\nto be loved and recognised as a great\n\nsymbol of 2012 — a date that has the\n\npotential to change the life of this\n\nnation.\"\n\nFACTFILE: JONATHAN DAVID EDWARDS\n\nBorn: May 10, 1966, London\n\nFamily Wife: Alison.\n\nChildren: Sam 13, Nathan 11\n\nGolds: Olympics: 2000\n\nWorld Champs: 1995 (18.29m WR), 2001\n\nCommonwealth Games: 2002\n\nEuropean Champs: 1998\n\nWorld Cup: 1992, 2002\n\nEuropean Cup: 1995, 96, 97, 98, 2001, 02\n\nEuropean Indoor: 1998\n\nAwards: BBC Sports Personality: 95."
