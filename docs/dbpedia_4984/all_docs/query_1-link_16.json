        "text": "The pressure to perform in our fast-paced world can feel overwhelming. During the Olympic men‚Äôs shot put final, Joe Kovacs showed us that sometimes slowing down can make all the difference. Faced with challenging conditions in the rain, Kovacs chose to ease back, allowing his true strength to shine. He didn‚Äôt win gold but earned a well-deserved silver in the last round! As Kovacs said, ‚ÄúThe last throw, I probably slowed down a little bit, which is what I needed to do‚Ä¶ if I slow down, I can kind of use my strength.‚Äù It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the rush, constantly pushing for the next big achievement. Slowing down every now and then can help us harness our strengths more effectively, leading to better outcomes. It‚Äôs not always about being the fastest or the first‚Äîsometimes, it‚Äôs about delivering your best, which can mean taking a moment to breathe and recalibrate.\n\nThat men's 100m final was intense! Eight men under 10 seconds for the first time. You have to hand it to Noah, he delivered when it mattered! For the first time, I felt I could possibly see the performance anxiety in his face, the nervous energy bubbling over as he roared into the stadium and was prowling with intensity on the start line. Noah stated his goals out loud to the whole world! He has consciously and consistently courted the attention for years and built up the pressure. Very few athletes have EVER done that‚Ä¶and performed... Bolt entertained. He was a showman. He handled the pressure. He didn‚Äôt court it. Some call him arrogant. Some say he talks too much. Some want to see him trip up. Yet he performs! How does Noah handle that intensity of pressure?! He doesn‚Äôt fear failure. He leans into and embraces the pressure. If he underperforms, he takes and shakes it off. He knows that‚Äôs part of the journey and then relentlessly goes again with unwavering self-belief. Pressure is a privilege.\n\nThis Friday at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games is the start of the athletics ‚Äî I‚Äôm very much looking forward to cheering on my teammates! This excitement brings back a powerful lesson I learned during my first Olympic Games. This lesson stayed with me throughout my athletic career and everyday life: the importance of rest and patience. I remember the thrill of entering the stadium, supporters waving Union Jacks üá¨üáß, the cheers of well-wishers and being surprised that they knew my name. It was a moment I had dreamt of, the chance to compete at the Olympics and fulfil my dream of becoming an Olympian. Over the first two rounds, I jumped 16.84m, the second-longest jump of my life! With one jump left, I was determined to go further, fiercely psyching myself up to do so. But I didn‚Äôt jump further in that final round. Afterwards, my coach, Ted King, pointed out what had happened. ‚ÄúDo you know what you did before the last round? You paced up and down for 45 minutes in the Athens sun, prowling like a lion. You wasted energy, and that‚Äôs why you didn‚Äôt jump further.‚Äù It was a hard but invaluable lesson. We often burn through our vital energy reserves in our haste, determination, and anxiety to perform. Learning to rest at the right moment, be patient, and preserve energy are crucial skills. We have a limited capacity of energy. Mastering these skills enables you to achieve peak performance and sustain high performance over time. Rest is not a sign of weakness; it‚Äôs a tool for enduring success.\n\nThis is a time of year when dreams are both realised and broken‚ÄîOlympic selection. It's an intensely emotional period for athletes. Many have dedicated their entire lives to this moment, embodying the essence of delayed gratification. The uncertainty of whether their dedication and persistence will pay off can be overwhelming. Success requires not only hard work but also a bit of fortune. Let‚Äôs have a thought for those who missed out and may be feeling a loss of self-worth. I know the feeling. I've been there. It hurts. It‚Äôs grief. Allow yourself to fully experience your emotions and give yourself the mental space needed to heal. It's perfectly okay to do so. Be proud of your efforts and the opportunity you‚Äôve cultivated for yourself. Remember, you are more than just an athlete. Use this experience to fuel your fire for future endeavours üî• Congratulations to all who are realising their dream. It's a magical moment, one that brings back fond memories of my first Olympic qualification‚Äîseeing my dreams as a 7-year-old boy come true‚Äîthe rush of relief and tingle of excitement. You are living a dream! Soak it in! Enjoy the ride and the experience. You are now part of a unique club that money can't buy."
