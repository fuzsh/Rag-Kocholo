        "text": "Williamson (left) is the only sprinter guaranteed a place in the 100m\n\nUK Athletics have named one 100m runner for Beijing as they wait for Thursday's High Court ruling on Dwain Chambers' appeal against his Olympic ban.\n\nSimeon Williamson is guaranteed his place in the team after finishing second behind Chambers at the UK trials at the weekend.\n\nHowever, the remaining two places will not be confirmed until the outcome of Thursday's ruling is known.\n\nThe British Olympic Association has until 20 July to name its final team.\n\nChambers' victory in Birmingham would normally mean he would be guaranteed a place on the plane to Beijing, but a BOA by-law prevents the former drugs cheat competing at the Olympics.\n\nIt is this ruling that the 30-year-old is challenging in the High Court, with Craig Pickering and Tyrone Edgar left waiting to see if they will be included in the squad.\n\nPickering, who finished third in the trials, and fourth-placed Edgar have clocked the required mark of 10.21 this season and are the two most likely to go to Beijing if Chambers is not successful.\n\nIf the High Court grants an injunction against the sprinter's lifetime Olympic ban for drug offences, selectors would be forced to pick the Londoner, meaning Edgar would probably miss out.\n\n\"We've gone with the athlete who is eligible and that's Simeon,\" UK Athletics performance director Dave Collins told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"Craig Pickering has made a strong case for himself. He's 2-0 with Tyrone Edgar. But then there's a chap called Marlon Devonish that might have something to say, while Harry Aikines-Aryeetey has run faster times than Craig.\"\n\nChristine Ohuruogu ran in the 200m at the British trials in Birmingham\n\nTriple jumper Phillips Idowu will go to Beijing as Britain's best medal hope in athletics after the 29-year-old landed the longest jump in the world this year at the trials with an effortless 17.58m on his first attempt.\n\nChristian Malcolm secured his Olympic place with victory in the 200m; Alex Nelson will join the Welsh sprinter in Beijing, while Devonish claims the final spot despite withdrawing from Birmingham because of illness.\n\nPaula Radcliffe had already been named in the team for the women's marathon even though her participation in Beijing is in doubt because of a stress fracture in her left thigh.\n\nAthletes can drop out at any time on medical grounds and can later be replaced, which could mean Radcliffe leaving it as late as the night before the marathon on 17 August to decide whether she is fit enough to run.\n\nSeven weeks ago specialists questioned her chances of being fit and Radcliffe has admitted she faces a race against time to be fit.\n\nAndrew Steele pulled out of the 400m final but is named in the team, along with Martyn Rooney who kept up his unbeaten run over the distance this season by winning the British crown n 45.31 seconds.\n\n606: DEBATE\n\nWorld 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu tuned up for Beijing with second place in the 200m. She will be joined on the women's 400m team by Lee McConnell and Nicola Sanders, who took silver in Osaka.\n\nTasha Danvers gets the nod in the 400m hurdles ahead of Perri Shakes-Drayton, who beat Danvers in Birmingham at the weekend. However, the 19-year-old does not have the Olympic qualifying time.\n\n\"We've got published selection criteria and Tasha Danvers has ticked three of the four boxes,\" Collins told BBC News 24.\n\n\"She was second in the trials, she has multiple A standards and a record of being in top eight in world and Olympic competitions.\n\n\"It would go against our selection criteria not to pick her.\"\n\nGB Athletics squad for Beijing:\n\nMEN\n\n100m: Simeon Williamson\n\n200m: Marlon Devonish, Christian Malcolm, Alex Nelson\n\n400m: Martyn Rooney, Andrew Steele\n\n800m: Michael Rimmer\n\n1500m: Andy Baddeley, Tom Lancashire\n\n5000m: Mo Farah\n\nMarathon: Dan Robinson\n\n110m hurdles: Andy Turner\n\nHigh jump: Germaine Mason, Tom Parsons\n\nPole vault: Steve Lewis\n\nLong jump: Greg Rutherford, Chris Tomlinson\n\nTriple jump: Phillips Idowu, Larry Achike, Nathan Douglas\n\nDecathlon: Daniel Awde\n\n4x100m: Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, Tyrone Edgar, Craig Pickering, Simeon Williamson\n\n4x400m: Michael Bingham, Richard Buck, Martyn Rooney, Andrew Steele, Rob Tobin\n\nWOMEN"
