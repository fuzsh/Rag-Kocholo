        "text": "It’s now estimated more than $55 billion dollars in opioid settlement money will go to states around the country to help battle the opioid epidemic.\n\nSpotlight on America has been tracking the settlement money for the past year and Investigative Correspondent Angie Moreschi has discovered that many grassroots organizations– who've been on the frontlines, battling the drug crisis for the past decade—are having a hard time accessing funds.\n\nIt’s been almost two years since 9-year-old Ava lost her dad to an opioid overdose. Ever since, she’s been raised in Columbus, Ohio by her grandmother Jackie Lewis.\n\n“We’re going through a lot of changes, right now. We’re selling the only home she’s ever really known,” Lewis said about her granddaughter. “Her strength amazes me. She just perseveres. I watch her persevere and power through hard things.”\n\nLewis is now a fierce advocate for families who’ve lost loved ones to substance use. She had high hopes that opioid settlement money could help impacted families with things like paying for funeral expenses or making sure treatment is available on demand. But she says getting funds for families and grassroots groups has been difficult.\n\n“The process for applying is very complicated, in my opinion,” Lewis told Spotlight on America.\n\nFunding process different in every state\n\nThe funding process is different in every state, so it can get very confusing. In Ohio, the state set up a private, not-for-profit called the to distribute 55-percent of the settlement money to the community. The rest of the money is split between local governments (35-percent) and state government (15-percent).\n\nIt's been two-years since the state received its first pay-out, and while some money has been distributed to local governments, OneOhio has yet to distribute any funds.\n\n“It infuriates me, quite honestly,” Lewis said. “Every day it's not out there. That's another day where people are dying or, you know, another family's losing their child or another little child's left without their mommy or daddy.”\n\nNearly 3600 Ohioans died in 2023 due to opioid overdoses.\n\nOneOhio opened an application process for grants this spring, posting on its website that \"grant announcements were expected to begin mid-summer.”\n\nBut in late July, “mid-summer” was removed and replaced with \"announcements expected to begin later this year.\"\n\nSpotlight on America contacted OneOhio to learn more about the delay. The Foundation’s public relations firm did not respond directly to our request for an interview but told us in an email that its initial \"mid-summer\" timeline was just an “estimated timeline and given the “high volume of funding requests received”—1,442 applications from 777 different organizations— the review process “remains underway.”\n\nOneOhio said grant awards will be announced on a rolling basis and will be made available to the public on the . They encouraged us to “check back for updates in the coming weeks and months.”\n\nThe state is slated to get about $2 billion dollars in settlement money over 18 years, which is more than most other states, because it was harder hit by the opioid epidemic.\n\nGrassroots Access Tough Nationwide\n\nAlexis Pleus lost her son Jeff to an overdose 10 years ago and has dedicated her life to fighting the opioid epidemic, ever since.\n\n“It's really hard,” Pleus told Spotlight. “This whole year, I’ve been dreading this 10-year mark because I feel frustrated where we are as a nation. That we haven’t come far enough.”\n\nPleus founded , which is known for its yearly March on Washington, remembering loved ones lost to substance abuse overdoses nationwide. She represents thousands of families across the country and says grassroots groups nationwide are having trouble getting funds.\n\n“It's 100% a problem across the country,” Pleus said.\n\nShe explained that many grassroots groups were founded by friends and loved ones who lost someone to opioid overdose and stressed why it’s so important for organizations to get some of these dollars.\n\n“We are coming in and filling in the gaps and taking care of people that the systems are leaving behind,” Pleus said. “Nobody's going to go the distance like a mom or a dad who's lost their own kid.”\n\nOpioid Grant Tracking Portal\n\nThe recently launched a new resource with the Legal action Center, which keeps track of which states are offering grant opportunities to community groups.\n\nFounder attorney Christine Minhee says, as of the beginning of August, about a dozen states still had yet to announce community grant programs.\n\nShe says it’s imperative that local community groups have access to these funds.\n\n“It is important to defer to community wisdom here, because the impact of this crisis is felt most keenly at the community level,” Minhee told Spotlight on America. “Hundreds of thousands of people had to die for state and local governments to get their billions of dollars from these pharmaceutical companies. So, in order to spend these monies well, I think it's imperative for decision makers to reach out to the folks impacted most.\n\nMinhee says the goal of the new Grant Tracker feature on their website is to level the playing field for those who might need these resources most.\n\n“Community organizations that have tiny, tiny budgets are going up against these extremely well financed applicants, who know how to play the game,\" Minhee said.\n\nGetting Help\n\nBack in Ohio, Jackie Lewis joined forces with eight non-profits and hired a company that specializes in grant writing, , to help them apply for funds.\n\n“We needed somebody that understood the inside track, so to speak. And this group, they know the players, the politicians, how the workings are,” Lewis said.\n\nSo now, they wait. And hope for funding to help their cause.\n\nMeanwhile, Ava is getting ready to go back to school this fall in a new school district, since they are selling the home she used to live in. She says she’s looking forward to making new friends and is thankful for all her grandma does for her.\n\n“She's a good mom,” Ava said, smiling shyly, as her grandma gave her a big hug and kiss.\n\nSPOTLIGHT WEB EXTRA"
