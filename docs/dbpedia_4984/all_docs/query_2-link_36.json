        "text": "Hometown: Kearney, Neb.\n\nAlma Mater: Concordia University, Nebraska\n\nJason Weides completed his 16th season at the helm of the Bulldog men's soccer program in 2023. He spent several years as an assistant for the men's team before becoming head coach. Weides is 163-105-37 overall and 85-59-25 in the GPAC in his career.\n\nThe 2015 season marked a high point in Bulldog Men's Soccer history as Weides led the program to its first-ever GPAC title and first-ever national tournament appearance. Concordia accomplished those feats by knocking off each of the conference's top-three seeds on the road during its GPAC tournament run that culminated with a 1-0 upset of No. 19 Hastings in the championship game. The 2015 squad finished with an overall record of 11-7-3. The Bulldogs of 2022 reached similar highs under Weides' direction in winning the GPAC tournament and qualifying for the national tournament for a second time. The '22 side went 15-3-3 overall in arguably the greatest season in program history. Concordia spent nearly the entire season receiving votes in the NAIA national poll.\n\nThe 2023 Bulldogs aspired to take things a step further and accomplished a feat no other squad had previously in program history: go undefeated in the regular season. Concordia went 13-0-4 in the regular season and climbed as high as No. 18 in the NAIA coaches' poll. Never before had the program cracked the NAIA top 25. Only a loss in the GPAC quarterfinals prevented the Bulldogs from a return to the national tournament.\n\nThe 2015 group initiated a run of three GPAC title game appearances in a row. In 2017, Weides steered the Bulldogs to a program record shattering 16 victories while marching to another conference final meeting with rival Hastings. A third-place finisher in 2016, Concordia moved up a rung into a tie for second in the final 2017 conference regular-season standings. Over the 2015 through 2018 seasons, the Bulldogs went a combined 6-3-2 in GPAC postseason action.\n\nUnder Weides, Concordia won 10 or more games in 10-consecutive seasons from 2011 through 2020 (110-61-22 over that stretch) - a feat only two other GPAC schools accomplished. Weides notched the 114th victory of his head coaching career on Sept. 21, 2019, making him the winningest coach in program history (passing Dr. Jack Kinworthy). Weides reached another milestone in 2022 by collecing career victory No. 150.\n\nThe 2017 team broke another school record while winning seven conference games (later reset in 2022 with eight GPAC wins). In 2014, the Bulldogs defeated Doane, 1-0, in the conference tournament to advance to the semifinals for the first time in more than a decade. In the midst of going 22-13-3 over the 2011-12 seasons, Weides guided the Bulldogs to 10-consecutive home wins, a streak that spanned from Aug. 27, 2011, to Sept. 26, 2012. The '21 team went 7-2-2 in the GPAC while tying a school record for number of conference wins in a single season.\n\nFrom 2010-13, Weides helped develop forward Nathan Douglas into one of the top players in the history of the program. Douglas broke the school's career goals record in 2013, finishing with 43. Douglas earned first team all-conference honors as a junior and senior and was named to the second team as a sophomore. The program placed three players on the All-GPAC first team in 2017: Florian Caraballo, Marcelo Hernandez and Micah Lehenbauer. The '22 and '23 squads also placed three players on the All-GPAC first team.\n\nWeides is a native of Kearney, Neb. and an alumnus of Concordia. While attending school at Concordia, he played soccer and was a four-year letter winner for the Bulldogs. He a two-time all-conference selection.\n\nWeides' coaching resume includes serving as an assistant coach at Concordia under former head coach Bill Schranz in 2002. He also spent time at Kearney High School where he was an assistant coach from 2003-05, helping the team to its first state tournament appearance since 1998. During Weides' time at Kearney, he also was the head coach of the Kearney Sublime club soccer team. He then returned as an assistant at Concordia from 2005-08.\n\nWeides has been involved with Athletes in Action and the Seward County Soccer Club. He earned his bachelorâ€™s degree in Commercial Art from Concordia University in 2002. Jason and his wife Erin reside in Seward with their son Isaiah.\n\nBulldogs Under Coach Weides\n\n2008: 6-10-2 Overall, 4-6-2 GPAC\n\n2009: 4-13-1 Overall, 2-9-1 GPAC\n\n2010: 7-10-2 Overall, 4-7 GPAC\n\n2011: 11-5-3 Overall, 5-3-2 GPAC\n\n2012: 11-8 Overall, 4-6 GPAC\n\n2013: 10-9 Overall, 6-4 GPAC\n\n2014: 10-6-4 Overall, 5-2-3 GPAC\n\n2015: 11-7-3 Overall, 4-4-2 GPAC (GPAC Tournament Champs)\n\n2016: 11-7-2 Overall, 6-3 GPAC\n\n2017: 16-3-1 Overall, 7-2 GPAC\n\n2018: 10-5-4 Overall, 6-2-3 GPAC\n\n2019: 10-6-2 Overall, 5-4-2 GPAC\n\n2020: 10-5-3 Overall, 7-2-2 GPAC\n\n2021: 8-7-3 Overall, 5-4-2 GPAC\n\n2022: 15-3-3 Overall, 8-1-2 GPAC (GPAC Tournament Champs)\n\n2023: 13-1-4 Overall, 7-0-4 GPAC"
