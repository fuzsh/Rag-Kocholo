        "text": "Nathan Douglas, the triple jumper who won a silver medal at the European championships, will miss next month's world championships with a hamstring injury that will keep him out for the rest of the season.\n\nDouglas, who finished second in last summer's Europeans and then took the silver medal indoors behind fellow Briton Phillips Idowu in Birmingham in March, is suffering from a grade three tear to his hamstring. He was considered a strong candidate to challenge for a medal in Osaka when the World Championships get under way on August 25, before he injured his leg last weekend in the IAAF grand prix in Madrid.\n\n\"It's very bad news, particularly for the athlete who in the past has shown through his consistency that he can challenge for major championship medals,\" said Dave Collins, the UK Athletics performance director. \"Nathan was gearing up for Osaka extremely well and I can imagine his disappointment at what has happened. His absence will be a great loss to the team.\"\n\nDouglas is no stranger to serious injuries. Three years ago an inflamed bursa gave him major problems followed by a bone spur operation in October 2005."
