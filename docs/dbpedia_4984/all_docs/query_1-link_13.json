        "text": "On Friday, the athletics started at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and I‚Äôm very much enjoying cheering on my teammates! This excitement brings back a powerful lesson I learned during my first Olympic Games. This lesson stayed with me throughout my athletic career and everyday life: the importance of rest and patience.\n\nI remember the thrill of entering the stadium, supporters waving Union Jacks üá¨üáß, the cheers of well-wishers and being surprised that they knew my name. It was a moment I had dreamt of, the chance to compete at the Olympics and fulfil my dream of becoming an Olympian.\n\nOver the first two rounds, I jumped 16.84m, the second-longest jump of my life! With one jump left, I was determined to go further, fiercely psyching myself up to do so. But I didn‚Äôt jump further in that final round.\n\nAfterwards, my coach, Ted King, pointed out what had happened. ‚ÄúDo you know what you did before the last round? You paced up and down for 45 minutes in the Athens sun, prowling like a lion. You wasted energy, and that‚Äôs why you didn‚Äôt jump further.‚Äù It was a hard but invaluable lesson.\n\nWe often burn through our vital energy reserves in our haste, determination, and anxiety to perform. Learning to rest at the right moment, be patient, and preserve energy are crucial skills. We have a limited capacity of energy. Mastering these skills enables you to achieve peak performance and sustain high performance over time. Rest is not a sign of weakness; it‚Äôs a tool for enduring success."
