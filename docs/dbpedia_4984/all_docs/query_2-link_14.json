        "text": "Gabby Douglas (born December 31, 1995, Virginia Beach, Virginia, U.S.) is a gymnast who, at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, became both the first American to claim gold medals in the team and individual all-around events and the first African American to win the all-around title.\n\nDouglas grew up in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where she practiced gymnastics from the age of six. In 2010—at age 14—she left her family and moved in with a host family in West Des Moines, Iowa, where she started training with prominent coach Liang Chow. Douglas soon began to attract attention at national competitions—she finished fourth in the all-around event at the 2010 Nastia Liukin Supergirl Cup, and at the 2011 Visa Championships she tied for third on the uneven bars and placed seventh all-around. She was named to the senior national team and helped the United States earn the team gold at the 2011 world championships, where she also placed fifth on the uneven bars. Douglas’s skill on the uneven bars—specifically, her ability to gain extraordinary height in the air when releasing from the apparatus—led U.S. team coordinator Martha Karolyi to dub her “the Flying Squirrel,” a nickname that Douglas and her coterie of fans embraced.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThe Olympics Quiz\n\nAt the 2012 Visa Championships, Douglas narrowly lost the all-around gold to Jordyn Wieber, the reigning world and national all-around champion. In addition to taking the all-around silver medal, Douglas claimed gold on the uneven bars and bronze in the floor exercise. Weeks later, at the U.S. Olympic trials, Douglas narrowly edged out Wieber to claim the all-around title. With the victory Douglas secured an automatic berth on the Olympic team. In London Douglas and her teammates—Wieber, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, and Kyla Ross—captured the first U.S. women’s team gold medal since 1996. Douglas then competed in the all-around event, posting strong scores during each rotation to finish with the top overall score. Douglas also competed individually on the balance beam and the uneven bars but did not medal in either event, finishing in seventh and eighth place, respectively. Her memoir Grace, Gold and Glory: My Leap of Faith (cowritten with Michelle Burford) was released in 2012.\n\nDouglas took two years off from competitive gymnastics before returning to the U.S. national team in November 2014. At the 2015 artistic gymnastics world championships, she won a gold medal in the team event and a silver in the all-around. The following year she won a team gold at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games but failed to win an individual medal."
