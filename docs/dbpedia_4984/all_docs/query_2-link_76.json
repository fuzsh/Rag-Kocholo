        "text": "I’m in the lobby of the incredibly beautiful Fairmont Hotel, Monaco, borrowing their WiFi and thinking about the state of the sport. It’s been the source of many, many Twitter discussions over the last year and my view is quite well known. It’s a mess. It’s a giant, ugly mess from the top down. The main four problems as I see them at the moment are:\n\n1. Governance,\n\n2. Doping,\n\n3. CAS ruling on hyperandrogenism, and\n\n4. Nationality hopping.\n\nDiack may be gone…\n\nDiack Jr. may be gone (and in hiding)…\n\nDolle may be gone…\n\nBut the uneasy feeling remains. Could Seb (or Sergey, in their time as VPs) really not have known? Wouldn’t you or I be sacked from our relative jobs for not knowing something as important as how the day to day running of the organisation was conducted? And particularly in Seb’s case, if the guys above him knew, and the guy who reported to him knew (Nick Davies), how on earth could he possibly have been in the dark? Here’s how the governance at the IAAF apparently worked, until recently:\n\nSeb was meant to be ushering in a cleaner era for our sport, but will Rio 2016 be any cleaner? Maybe marginally, as the Russian team won’t be there. But that is mainly down to the excellent work of Hajo Seppelt and the German tv station ARD. IAAF were left chasing their tails on the Russia scandal, despite the fact that rumours about systematic doping in Russia have been around since before I was born. Hopefully Hajo’s exploits in Kenya will expose the huge doping problem that exists there, and then he can turn his attentions closer to home. He has recently set up a website https://www.sportsleaks.com to confidentially report information on possible doping in any sport. UKAD have a similar reporting service, but given their gross negligence and failures recently in the Dr. Bonar case, I’m not sure many people would trust them to act on the information they are receciving.\n\nAnother major issue, which will come to the fore in Rio, if not in the 800m here in Monaco, is the CAS ruling on hyperandrogenism. This season we have seen Caster Semenya look like her old self – faster, unbeatable in quick or slow races, and even capable of breaking the world record in the right conditions (yes, Kratochvilova’s insane 1:53.28!!!) I don’t think anyone is naive enough to think that this sudden improvement is related to anything other than the CAS ruling last year. This is not intended as Semenya bashing, after all there are several other athletes who are rumoured to be benefiting from the same ruling, but more as a lament on what the ruling potentially means for women’s sports. Surely women with (now unregulated) hyperandrogenism will become more and more dominant in women’s sport outside the 800m, in field events such as hammer, shot putt, javelin etc and in short sprints. As several athletes and journalists have commented – is this the end of women’s sport as we know it?\n\nEvery two years the European Athletics Championships remind us of another problem – nationality hopping. The most notable of this years championships was Yasemine Can:\n\nCan, or Jemutai as the Eurosport commentators liked to call her, did herself no favours by talking about being “happy to win medals for Turkey, but also hoping to win medals for Kenya in the future” in her post race interviews. Of all the problems athletics currently has, this one is probably the easiest to fix, in two simple steps:\n\n1. You have to run for a country that you are born in, or a close family member was born in, or where you have acquired refugee status.\n\n2. You can only ever run for one country at senior level.\n\nSimilar rules already exist in many sports including football and rugby, they are easy to police and they will prevent the likes of the “Turkish” team at the European champs – which included athletes from Kenya, Jamaica, Azerbaijan and Cuba – from ever happening again.\n\nDespite athletics’ failings in all of these areas, I know that tomorrow when I’m in the Stade Louis II in Monaco I’ll be able to enjoy the live athletics I see. This is because I’m capable of a form of cognitive dissonance. But while I’ll enjoy the performances for the spectacle that they are, I know not to believe that all of what I’m seeing is legitimate. And I also know not to believe that the IAAF or CAS are doing everything that they can to clean up and make fairer the sport.\n\nThere is a British runner named Jessica Andrews and last Saturday she ran an eighty three second PB to become the surprise winner of the British Olympic 10,000m trials and qualify for Rio later this summer…\n\n…But what if her name was Džéssika Andreyeva?\n\nOr Dzhes Arzamasava?\n\nWould we feel differently about an 83 second improvement over 10,000m if we had heard that it happened in the Luzhniki Stadium?\n\nAt the Russian track and field Olympic trials?\n\nBy an athlete that was not even expected to make the Russian Olympic team?\n\nThere would be a strong level of suspicion attributed to such an improvement if just one aspect of this performance was changed – the athlete’s nationality.\n\nThis is not intended to accuse or offered as proof of doping in a specific athlete, but rather as a way to highlight the nationalistic double-standards that, not for the first time, influence the anti-doping conversation. We know, thanks to the investigative journalists who have exposed it, that Russian sport is rotten with doping, at a state level, and this fits our narrative and preconceptions of doping.\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of the performance on Saturday night, questions were (rightly, given the current climate of mistrust) asked of Andrews, and I encountered a great deal of obfuscation and misinformation, which only served to make me more committed to asking questions. So I’m writing this blog to get to the bottom of the following questions: How big was Andrews’ improvement really, and are some of the justifications and explanations for her improvement valid?\n\nThe point is that when performance is offered as proof or reasons for suspicion of Russians, as it often is, then the very same standard should be applied to any athlete. I want to look at that improvement, according to actual data, not self reported tales of time away.\n\nSo where do I start? Firstly, Jessica Andrews was not expected to feature in the Highgate Harriers Night of the 10,000m PBs, let alone win, and this is evidenced by the fact that she was not even mentioned on the England Athletics website’s list of athletes to watch out for in the race:\n\n“The women’s race will be headlined by European 10,000m champion Jo Pavey (Coach: Gavin Pavey; Club: Exeter) as the 42 year old bids to qualify for her fifth Olympic Games. Pavey will face a strong test however, as Kate Avery (Coach: Tony Simmons, Club: Shildon) and Beth Potter (Coach: Mick Woods, Club: Shaftesbury Barnet) have already achieved the qualifying mark for the Olympic Games with times of 31:41.44 and 32:03.45.\n\nFurther names to look out for will be Rhona Auckland (Coach: Joyce Hogg, Club: Banchory Stonehaven), Jessica Coulson (Mick Woods; Stockport) and Lily Partridge (Coach: self, Club: Aldershot Farnham & District), who are all within sight of 32:15, and Charlotte Arter (Coach: James Thie, Club: Cardiff), who has been in excellent form over the winter.”\n\nYet her improvement in this race was so great that she beat all of the aforementioned athletes, won the race and finished 17 seconds inside the qualifying time for Rio.\n\nI have seen it argued repeatedly on Twitter that this 83 second improvement should not be considered suspicious as the time (31:58.00) is not overly impressive in the grand scheme of things, e.g. at an Olympic final. However I think that looking at Andrews’ time in the context of what other athletes can run is to entirely miss the point, for two reasons. First, because the important point here is the relative personal improvement, and second, because of the recent revelations which have exposed state sponsored doping in Russia and bribes to cover up positive tests in Kenya. These revelations, along with the ever growing list of countries that are non-compliant with WADA code mean that we cannot safely state what a suspicious or non-suspicious time would be. In fact, whether a time should be considered suspicious or not has nothing to do with the time itself and everything to with the ability, genetics, physiology and improvement of the athlete involved.\n\nTherefore we need to look at Jessica Andrews’ time within the context of her own progression. Athletics is mainly an individual pursuit, and so it is much easier to judge an athlete’s improvement than it would be in football/ rugby/ basketball etc. Jessica Andrews’ drop from 33:21.53 in April 2016 to 31:58.00 in May 2016 indicates an improvement of 4.14%. The 10,000m time is significantly stronger, comparatively, than her outdoor 3,000m or 5,000m PBs (9:38.69 and 16:19.66 respectively). Andrews actually ran faster than both her 3,000m and 5,000m PBs during her 10,000m race on May 21st.\n\nShe has raced every year for the past eight years, which is inconsistent with her reported complete break (reported by her best friend to me on twitter as “pretty much taking a year out”) from track running. Power of 10 lists performances from her in late November 2014, April, June and July of 2015 and early January 2016. Therefore it cannot be said that she took a long break, no longer than a bad injury layoff. It is true however that she has only ever run two 10,000m track races so I am also going to look at her time in comparison to her results over other distances on the track, which she has raced more frequently.\n\nIf she had run her 3,000m track PB (set in 2014) for the entire 10,000m race she would have run 32:06, and,\n\nIf she had run her 5,000m (also set in 2014) track PB for the entire 10,000m race she would have run 32:38.\n\nTherefore she ran faster than her 3,000m and 5,000m track PBs on route to a massive 10,000m PB.\n\nRunner’s World prediction calculator (which can be found here: http://www.runnersworld.co.uk/general/rws-race-time-predictor/1681.html) estimates times of 34:30 and 34:01 for 10,000m using Jessica’s respective 3,000m and 5,000m PBs. If we take Jessica’s fastest ever 3,000m time (a 9:22.69 from an indoor competition in February 2016), that equates to roughly a 33:33 10,000m time. The “Running Ahead” website (https://www.runningahead.com/tools/calculators/race) allows users to insert two race times to predict a 10,000m time. Using her lifetime PBs – the indoor 3,000m and outdoor 5,000m – the estimated 10,000m time is 34:39. Clearly these times are not remotely near the 31:58.00 10,000m time she ran on Saturday. This marks the 31:58.00 out as a complete outlier in the context of her other track races.\n\n10km is a distance that Jessica Andrews has raced much more frequently on the road, with her fastest time being 33:33 in Alcaniz in April 2016 (she has also recorded marks of 33:51 in 2015, and 33:55 and 34:17 in 2014). I cannot find any scientific studies comparing road to track times (some athletes never run faster on the track than road, others are faster on the track, I acknowledge this), but the IAAF offers tables (found here: http://www.iaaf.org/about-iaaf/documents/technical) for converting road performances to track performances which are helpful in this context. According to their scoring tables, her best road 10km time of 33:33 (1077 points) is the equivalent of a 33:12 over 10,000m on the track. To look at it from the other perspective, her 31:58.00 is worth 1141 points, equivalent to a 32:20 on the road.\n\nThere are other more generous conversions, including:\n\n15-20 seconds slower on road for 5km and 40-50 seconds slower for 10km\n\n3% slower for all distances on road compared to track\n\n3.3% slower for all distances on road compared to track\n\nUsing these calculations Andrews’ time equates to 32:43 (using method 1), 32:33 (using method 2) and 32:26 (using method 3).\n\nThese road to track conversions bring us closer to the 31:58.00 that Andrews ran, which makes her performance improvement smaller (a converted 33:12 to 31:58 represents a 3.7% improvement, for instance) However it is still a major leap in performance in a very short space of time – especially for someone who has not shown much track pedigree in the past.\n\nWe don’t have to look too far into athletics history to find a similarly impressive performance in London. Russian runners have not been allowed to compete in recent months due to the well publicised revelations about state sponsored doping so instead let’s look at Volha Mazuronak (BLR), who ran 2:23:54 during this year’s London Marathon. This performance sparked debate from many sources, including Mara Yamamuchi who labelled the run “astonishing” and noted that she was “unable to understand her performance.” She pointed out that she “wasn’t accusing her of anything” but asked “If anyone with a good knowledge of women’s marathon running can make sense of this performance please let me know.” Mazuronak improved from 2:25:36 in London 2015 to 2:23:54 in the same marathon in 2016. This equates to a 1.17% improvement (much less than Andrews’ 4.14%, or the 3.7% improvement if you use the IAAF’s road conversion formula for Andrews’ best road 10km performance), yet Mazuronak was greeted with much more suspicion.\n\nAlso, many people were critical of the fact that Mazuronak broke her half marathon PB during the London marathon, pointing out how implausible it is to set a PB for a shorter distance race on route to a PB in the longer race. Which is identical to Andrews, yet similar complaints were not made when she broke her outdoor 3,000m and 5,000m PBs during her 31:58.00 run.\n\nMazuronak is thus guilty by nationality first, performance second. Or is it the other way around? Perhaps, most accurately, her performance is judged differently because of her nationality. That’s called profiling. Might this be fair given the ‘form’ shown by eastern Bloc nations? Perhaps. But it’s certainly not fair to imply that Athlete A’s performance is unbelievable, when Athlete B’s, even more profound an improvement, is simply dismissed because of her nationality and (untrue) explanations about time away from running.\n\nI cannot say Jessica Andrews is doping. Similarly, I cannot say that she is clean. In the same way that I cannot speak with certainty either way about Volha Mazuronak. My point is simply that we cannot give certain athletes a free pass based on the country of their birth. Carl Sagan said that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof” and I feel that the same should be demanded of extraordinary performances, no matter who produces them.\n\nI don’t think an assertion that one is now “in love with running” should be blindly accepted as the reason for between a 3.7% and 4.14% performance increase – the figures garnered from comparisons to her other track performances over a variety of distances and to her adjusted road performances. If we want clean sport we have to open our eyes, use rational and critical thought, engage our mouths and demand it – the time has long passed for believing everything we see without question or giving anyone the benefit of the doubt because of the nationality listed on their passport.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it’s the track and field competition you’ve all been waiting for – Sports Trump of the Year. So just who was the most idiotic, moronic, mean-spirited, most ‘Donald Trump’-esque athlete of 2015. Read the nominations below and cast your vote on https://twitter.com/Swift__Girl :\n\n1.Richard Kilty – For being a total ‘Trump’ to little, lovely CJ Ujah, even though replays concluded that CJ had run off the correct mark at the correct time. And worst of all, for doing it live on TV less than five feet away from CJ!\n\nFor comments like “If Harry had been there we would have got the job done. It’s probably not the order that we wanted as a team” – despite Harry’s PB being 10.08 and CJ’s being 9.96 – and insinuating that they may have even won with Dina Asher Smith on the last leg!\n\n2.Justin Gatlin – Where do I start? What an infuriating little ‘Trump’ of a man! He has been the subject of many a twitter campaign over the past few years (search #CheatsTurnMeOff, #FuckOffGatlin and “limerick Gatlin” for more information) but what gets him onto this list is his complete and utter BOTTLING of the sprints in Beijing. Despite running faster than Bolt all year he just couldn’t face up to the big man in Beijing – losing the 100m, 200m and being on the USA team that was disqualified in the 4x100m relay. It couldn’t have happened to a nicer fella…\n\n3.Richard Kilty – What has he done this time? He has only gone and slagged off athletics fans on twitter. He called me “the original prostitute,” @pahunt1978 was a “shit stirring cockroach” and he even threatened to beat up @davebromage’s three year old son! As Del Boy would say “What a plonker!” Unfortunately for Richard he seems unaware that people are able to screenshot his nasty remarks, and thinks he is completely absolved of all guilt once he deletes the offending tweets a few hours later. Not quite Richard, @Swift__Girl never forgets…\n\nP.S. Work on your grammar please. #your\n\n4. Paula Radcliffe – Mr. Trump is well known for being a hypocrite, and Paula took a leaf out of his book this year with her very hasty turnaround on transparency once her own blood values were under scrutiny. For years she pushed for more blood testing, the introduction of a biological passport and for athlete results to be made public – but she did a complete 180 on those beliefs this year once her three suspicious off scores were made public knowledge.\n\n5. Richard Kilty – The only man as many negative headlines as Trump this year makes another appearance on the list, and this time it is for pushing over an elderly official following his DQ at the London Anniversary Games. He claimed to have apologised to the elderly man straight afterwards, but his son took to twitter to clarify that no such apology had been received.\n\n6. Yelena Isinbayeva – This hypocritical homophobe believes that keeping innocent Russian athletes out of Rio is unfair, yet sees nothing wrong with the hideous treatment of innocent gay men and women in Russia. Wrap your brain around that one…\n\nAt the press conferences before the Meeting Areva the same question was put to a lot of the female athletes – “Why do you think male athletes get so much more attention than you?” It is a loaded question, but a valid one. The posters for the Meeting Areva had originally featured Usain Bolt, Renaud Lavillenie and Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad. Benabbad’s picture was then removed (but not replaced) after it was revealed that he would not be competing. Valerie Adams (unbeaten in 56 competitions before Paris) was there, as was double Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and there was a world record attempt by Ayana and Dibaba – yet the organisers did not see fit to put any of these women on their posters. SAFP said she could not understand it, she said that when the female athletes come out to compete they look great, they perform well and the level of competition is always high. She said she wished they got similar recognition to their male counterparts. She was then asked whether or not she thought times had anything to do with it. She agreed that yes they probably did, as in recent years athletes like Bolt, Rudisha and Kimetto have been chasing times and rewriting the record books, while the vast majority of the women’s records (particularly on the track) seem completely out of reach – see Flo Jo’s 21.34 for 200m or Wang Junxia ‘s 8:06.11 for 3000m for further information.\n\nSince this question was posed I have been thinking a lot about the different levels of interest and attention paid to men’s and women’s athletics. I agree that the record breaking times of men in recent years does have a role to play, however I do not think it could be the only factor. So I decided to conduct a very scientific (NOT!) study of fellow athletics fans on twitter. I asked them to name the first athlete that came into their heads, in each of the following categories:\n\nYou will notice that I didn’t ask specifically for male or female athletes – just the first athlete that each person thought of, in each particular event. In total 40 people replied, and the average response to the six categories was 4 male and 2 female (total response 160 male athletes to 80 female). I think it is a good sign that very few listed male athletes only (3 out of 40 respondents) but no one mentioned a full set of six female athletes. Women who answered on twitter were no more likely to include female athletes than men who answered. I find it strange that in a sport were women and men get almost equal airtime during events, that fans are still twice as likely to name male athletes as female ones. Could it be media driven? Could the media obsession with Bolt (and more recently Rupp and Farah) mean that they are in the forefront of our minds?\n\nI’m not so sure. Athletics is one of very few sports in which the female events get similar coverage as their male counterparts. Compared to women’s football, basketball and rugby, women’s athletics is covered prolifically. Also, the thing that surprised me most me in this data collection exercise was the most commonly named athletes by respondents.\n\nNo not Usain Bolt…\n\nNot Justin Gatlin…\n\nNot Mo Farah either…\n\nThe most frequent name in was VALERIE ADAMS!\n\nWith over 50% of people naming her as the first shot putter that came to mind.\n\nCould this be because of her long winning streak (unbeaten in 56 competitions prior to the Paris Diamond League)? Because of her memorable physique (she is 6ft 4)? Because of her strong anti-doping stance? Because of her friendly and chatty demeanour in interviews? Or because she has been a big name in world athletics for the past ten years? I don’t know for sure – but what I do know is that Queen Val is one of the most recognisable athletes in the world!\n\nThe best explanation I have seen for the why male athletics continues to be seen as ‘more important’ than the female version is not because of the amount of coverage, but the type of coverage. This is summed up in the study Playing Unfair (2002) – “Coverage of women’s sports lags far behind men’s and focuses on female athletes’ femininity and sexuality over their achievements on the court and field. While female athleticism challenges gender norms, women athletes continue to be depicted in traditional roles that reaffirm their femininity – as wives and mothers or sex objects. By comparison, male athletes are framed according to heroic masculine ideals that honour courage, strength, and endurance.” We see this all the time – whether it is Jo Pavey being referred to by her age or as a “mother of two”, or Lolo Jones and Darya Klishina’s looks being mentioned before their athletic performances. This never happens to men.\n\nWe need to change the way women’s athletics is portrayed. Our track and field stars are top class athletes, who have spent their whole lives training to be in peak condition, trying to be the best in the world – so maybe this year we can focus on their performances instead of their looks!"
