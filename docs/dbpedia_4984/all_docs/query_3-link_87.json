They sit down first with NOLA Gold with Head Coach Nate Osborne to go over how the Gold have used this off-season to lay the foundation for future seasons off the pitch. Moni Tongauiha joins the show and discusses how he felt when Coach Osborne asked him to move from the midfield to the back row.\n\nOld Glory joins the show with Coach Andrew Douglas who surveys what his side did well in his first, but abbreviated season at the helm of the expansion club from DC. He also overviews his opponent in NOLA Gold ahead of pre-season. Mungo Mason joins the show fresh after completing Law School and a season with the Warringah Rats. He discusses his experience with MLR first as a member of San Diego Legion in 2017 and then his return with Old Glory this last season."
