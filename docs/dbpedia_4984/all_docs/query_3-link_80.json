No team score was kept but the Hawks put together a strong showing as individuals highlighted by Sam Bielawa (Portsmouth, R.I.), Shirah Strock (Castleton, N.Y.), and the 4x100 meter relay team each claiming ninth-place finishes.\n\nBielawa capped off an impressive first season in Bristol by grabbing ninth in the Triple Jump with a distance of 13.65m. He also took 14th in the long jump with a leap of 6.54m and was a member of both the RWU relay teams that competed in the event. The 4x100 relay squad consisting of Bielawa, Sean Donovan (Glastonbury, Conn.), Jon Gladstone (Fairfield, Conn.), and Brendan Truman (Vernon, Conn.) took ninth place as a group. Meanwhile, the 4x400m team of Gladstone, Jack Bielawa (Portsmouth, R.I.), Nathan Douglas (Attleboro, Mass.), and Liam Engel (Holliston, Mass.) took 11th with a program-record time of 3:27.31. Douglas also competed individually in the 400-meter dash and finished 15th.\n\nOn the women's side, Strock took ninth in the pole vault with a mark of 3.23m to tie the program record for Roger Williams. Meanwhile, Brooke Dutton (Coventry, Conn.) grabbed tenth in discus.\n\nSchool Records\n\n4X400 Meter Relay\n\n11th: Liam Engel, Jon Gladstone, Jack Bielawa, Nathan Douglas, 3:27.31\n\nPole Vault\n\n9th: Shirah Strock, 3.23m (tied)\n\nHawk Highlights\n\n400 Meter Dash\n\n15th: Nathan Douglas, 50.38\n\n4X100 Meter Relay\n\n9th: Sean Donovan, Jon Gladstone, Brendan Truman, Sam Bielawa, 44.46\n\n4X400 Meter Relay\n\n11th: Liam Engel, Jon Gladstone, Jack Bielawa, Nathan Douglas, 3:27.31\n\nPole Vault\n\n9th: Shirah Strock, 3.23m\n\nLong Jump\n\n14th: Sam Bielawa, 6.54m\n\nTriple Jump\n\n9th: Sam Bielawa,\n\nDiscus Throw\n\n9th: Brooke Dutton, 35.44m\n\nCoach's Corner\n\nIt was great to see each athlete and relay finished better than their ranking coming into the meet.\n\nThey all stepped up in a big way. Nine of the athletes are back next year. We have a great foundation to build off of and it was an excellent way to end the season. I am so very proud of this group performing so well at a high-level meet.\n\nSpecial thanks to seniors Shirah and Nate. They led the team throughout the entire season and will be sorely missed next season.\n\nWhat's Next\n\nThis concludes the season for the RWU Track & Field teams.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\nBrooke Dutton\n\nThrows\n\n5' 7\"\n\nJunior\n\nShirah Strock\n\nJumps\n\n5' 8\"\n\nSenior\n\nSean Donovan\n\nHurdles\n\n5' 9\"\n\nSophomore\n\nLiam Engel\n\nDistance\n\n5' 10\"\n\nJunior\n\nBrendan Truman\n\nSprints\n\n5' 6\"\n\nJunior\n\nSam Bielawa\n\nSprints/Jumps\n\n5' 8\"\n\nFreshman\n\nJon Gladstone\n\nSprints\n\n5' 9\"\n\nFreshman\n\nNathan Douglas\n\nSprints\n\n6' 0\"\n\nSenior\n\nJack Bielawa\n\nSprints/Jumps\n\n6' 2\"\n\nFreshman"
