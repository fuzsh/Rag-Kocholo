        "text": "English triple jumper\n\nFor the screenwriter known as Nathan E. Douglas, see Nedrick Young.\n\nNathan James Douglas (born 4 December 1982 in Oxford)[1] is a retired two-time Olympian and British athlete who specialises in the triple jump. He is an eight-time British champion and two-time European silver medalist.\n\nNathan is a leading Executive High Performance and Resilience Coach.\n\nAthletics career\n\n[edit]\n\nDouglas won two consecutive British Outdoor Championships claiming gold in the 2004 AAA Championships and the 2005 AAA Championships.[2] His personal best is 17.64 m ( 57 ft 10+1⁄4 in), set in 2005, the current British Championships record, ranks him third on the Great Britain all-time list. The following year he won a silver medal at the 2006 European Athletics Championships in Gothenburg with a jump of 17.21 metres.[3]\n\nIn 2007 he won a silver medal at the European Indoor Athletics Championships in Birmingham with a jump of 17.47m, the second longest jump in the world at the time.\n\nHe suffered a major injury in 2007 and, although he managed to compete at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, he struggled to find form as the injury had upset his technique.[4] The injury's severity and complications ultimately affected his chances of competing at the 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nDouglas continued to compete taking part in World Championships, European Championships and the Commonwealth Games. Nathan was made team captain in 2016.\n\nHe went on to win a record eight British Championships including the 2016 British Athletics Championships and Olympic trials, and the 2018 British Athletics Championships. He won his last 16 years after his first, winning the triple jump at the 2020 British Athletics Championships.[5]\n\nNathan is the most medalled triple jumper in British Championship history with 22 medals, spanning over an international career of 22 years.\n\nInternational competitions\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Competition Venue Position Event Notes Representing Great Britain and England 2003 European U23 Championships Bydgoszcz, Poland 14th (q) Triple jump 15.68 m (+0.9 m/s) 2004 Olympic Games Athens, Greece 13th (q) Triple jump 16.84 m 2005 European Indoor Championships Madrid, Spain 4th Triple jump 16.89 m European Cup Florence, Italy 5th Triple jump 16.54 m World Championships Helsinki, Finland 15th (q) Triple jump 16.53 m World Athletics Final Monte Carlo, Monaco 6th Triple jump 16.81 m 2006 World Indoor Championships Moscow, Russia 7th Triple jump 17.05 m European Cup Málaga, Spain 4th Triple jump 16.62 m European Championships Göteborg, Sweden 2nd Triple jump 17.21 m 2007 European Indoor Championships Birmingham, United Kingdom 2nd Triple jump 17.47 m 2008 Olympic Games Beijing, China 20th (q) Triple jump 16.72 m 2009 World Championships Berlin, Germany 10th Triple jump 16.79 m 2010 European Championships Barcelona, Spain 10th Triple jump 16.48 m Commonwealth Games Delhi, India 4th Triple jump 16.96 m 2013 European Team Championships Gateshead, United Kingdom 3rd Triple jump 16.45 m 2014 Commonwealth Games Glasgow, United Kingdom 11th Triple jump 14.56 m 2016 European Championships Amsterdam, Netherlands 15th (q) Triple jump 16.33 m 2018 Commonwealth Games Gold Coast, Australia 5th Triple jump 16.35 m World Cup London, United Kingdom 6th Triple jump 16.24 m European Championships Berlin, Germany 6th Triple jump 16.71 m 2019 European Indoor Championships Glasgow, United Kingdom 7th Triple jump 16.33 m\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
