        "text": "The Oxford City AC triple-jumper has built an impressive CV across three decades, becoming British champion eight times and reaching two Olympic Games.\n\nBut Douglas, who turns 40 in December, has decided he will finish his 22-year career at the end of 2022.\n\nThe veteran’s last season begins at this weekend’s British Indoor Championships in Birmingham, where he will compete for triple jump gold on Saturday.\n\nDouglas is based in the city, which will host the Commonwealth Games this summer.\n\nAnd the 39-year-old revealed the thought of competing at the event for the fourth time was one of his final career goals.\n\nHe said: “That would be a great competition to bow out at.\n\n“I’d love to aim for it, so I thought there’s nothing to lose.\n\n“We’ll see how the season goes. I’m excited and I’m just looking to enjoy every competition.\n\n“Knowing each competition could be my last means I’m really looking forward to the occasion.”\n\nDouglas admitted he may have retired earlier had last year’s Tokyo Olympics not been postponed by 12 months due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHe was aiming to reach his third Games, after Athens in 2004 and Beijing four years later, but did not make the qualification distance.\n\nDouglas said: “I’ve always taken each year as it comes.\n\n“The pandemic has added a little bit of longevity to my career.\n\n“If the Olympics had happened in 2020 and I’d qualified I probably would have retired, but I knew I trained well so when it was postponed I couldn’t waste that preparation.”\n\nDouglas won his eighth British Championship title in September 2020, aged 37, but it all began at Oxford City three decades earlier.\n\nHe said: “It’s the place I started at seven years old so I have fond memories.\n\n“My first coach was Steve Hill and I have a lot to thank him for, he was one of the first people to give me that buzz from athletics.\n\n“When the time came to move on he encouraged me to go – I remember not wanting to but he thought he’d taken me as far as he could, which shows the kind of man he is.\n\n“I’ve been asked to change clubs several times but I’ve never felt the need.\n\n“I’ve always been very proud to wear the Oxford City vest.”\n\nThe Olympian’s niece, Limara, is one of the club’s younger members and chairman Richard Hart revealed Douglas remains a role model to the talented crop of youngsters.\n\nHe said: “They can walk into our clubhouse and see a photo on the wall of Nathan and of course it’s an inspiration.\n\n“They train day-in, day-out with that reminder.\n\n“Nathan and Hannah England have carried through a generation of kids, for 15 years they’ve been a really big inspiration.”\n\nHart added: “As an athlete he’s remained at a really high level for many years, even though his event is really brutal.\n\n“He really is a remarkable athlete and I hope that gets recognised.”"
