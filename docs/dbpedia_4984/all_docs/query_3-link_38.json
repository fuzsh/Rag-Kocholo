        "text": "Nathan Douglas admits he felt his last chance to be part of the Great Britain team had gone after two injury-ravaged summers.\n\nThe 30-year-old triple-jumper returns to the sandpit in a British vest for the first time since 2010 tomorrow at Gateshead in the European Team Championships.\n\nHis selection ahead of former world champion Phillips Idowu raised many an eyebrow but for Douglas it represents an opportunity to start his international career all over again.\n\n‘I can say I’ve been in a position where I felt like I’d had my last shot,’ he explained. ‘It has been tough, not only for me, but for family and friends.\n\n‘I had to stay strong mentally but it does make you realise what you can deal with when you have a career-threatening injury.\n\n‘I knew I’d have to be really strong and now I can’t wait to go out there on Saturday and jump.’\n\nDouglas tore ankle ligaments in a freak training accident in Italy two years ago, subsequently missing out on the Olympic Games in London.\n\nDespite that, he knows he can just count himself lucky to be jumping again, as the brief Peter Eriksson era at British Athletics draws to a close.\n\n‘I’m buzzing, I always felt I could come back and give it the best try I could,’ adds Douglas, European Championships silver medallist in 2006.\n\n‘Doubts are part of the process and you have to realise that but when I was out I realised how much I just love jumping.\n\n‘I have to take it step by step although, as ever, the goal is the major championships, which are the worlds in Moscow in August, and I believe I have the qualifying mark of 17.20metres in the tank.’\n\nFollow Nathan on Twitter @NathanJDouglas and visit his website www.nathan-douglas.com\n\nMORE: Lolo Jones apologises to bobsleigh team-mates"
