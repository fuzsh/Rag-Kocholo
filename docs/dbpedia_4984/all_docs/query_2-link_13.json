        "text": "Time flies, doesn't it? It's hard to believe it's already been a year since I retired from elite sport. I always knew I wanted a career ready to jump into when retirement came knocking. For me, the turning point came during the 2012 Olympic Games. But let me take you back a bit.\n\nIn 2007, I faced a career-threatening hamstring injury that took four long years to rehabilitate successfully. Just as I thought I had conquered adversity, a training incident in 2011 shattered my left ankle, rupturing three ligaments. Against all odds and with a mindset of persistence, I made a remarkable comeback for the 2012 season. However, my dreams of an Olympic gold medal on home turf in London were dashed when I ruptured my conjoined tendon in my hamstring during a competition in Hengelo, Netherlands.\n\nAt that point, I realised that my childhood dream of becoming an Olympic gold medallist was slipping away. I was facing my third career-threatening injury in a row, and by the time the 2016 Olympics arrived, I would be 33. It was time to accept that my path was taking a different turn.\n\nBut even though my Olympic dream was fading, I knew I wanted to keep competing and prove to myself that I could return to a world-class level. And I did just that. However, I also knew I had to plan for the eventual transition into retirement.\n\nIt made perfect sense to me. Retirement is an inevitable part of every athlete's journey. Even Olympic gold medallists retire, and very few earn enough not to require another career. So, I began to prepare for the next chapter.\n\nRetiring from elite sport can be both daunting and exciting, especially when it has been your lifelong dream. Now, you have the opportunity to paint the life you desire on a blank canvas. Embrace the thrill of reinventing yourself, setting new goals, and discovering passions beyond the field. It's normal if the path ahead isn't crystal clear; uncertainty is to be expected. Use this as an opportunity for self-discovery and create a future filled with purpose and fulfilment.\n\nAfter almost a year of self-discovery after the 2012 Olympics Games, I pursued an Executive High Performance Coach certification. Throughout my life, I have always strived for world-class performance, aiming high and doing whatever it took to bring out my best. I wanted to share my knowledge and help others achieve excellence in any field.\n\nFeeling uncertain about your path outside of elite sport is natural. Embrace this uncertainty as an opportunity for self-discovery and exploration. Step into uncharted territory by trying new things, enrolling in different courses, and exploring new interests. This journey will help you discover what resonates with you and provide clarity about your next steps. Remember, the exploration process is as important as reaching the destination itself.\n\nA few years after becoming an Executive High Performance coach, I met my future business partner, and we have grown an organisational health, wellbeing and performance company - 7Futures. I had always envisioned myself growing a company, applying the same ambition I had as an athlete.\n\nFast forward to 2022, retirement eventually came, marking the end of my 22-year professional career at a world-class level. I was prepared. However, the first Monday after retiring, when I would usually be preparing for training, I woke up with a strange feeling. \"I don't have to go to training today,\" I thought. It was a moment of realisation that my routine had changed. For 22 years, I had honed an efficient routine geared towards being the best athlete I could be. Now, it was time for a new rhythm.\n\nI sought advice from my old coach and dear friend, Ted King. He knows me well, understands my level of ambition, and offers wise counsel. Ted advised me to take my time transitioning into this new world. He encouraged me to be patient and kind to myself, discover new routines, spend more time with friends and family, take care of my health and wellbeing, and balance it all as I gradually stepped into a new realm rather than jumping straight into my new career.\n\nHaving someone like Ted in my corner, who coached me as an athlete and helped shape me into an elite performer, was invaluable. Even in retirement, he was still looking out for me. I urge you to keep an eye out for people like Ted during your sporting career and hold on to them. They're rare gems!\n\nUnsurprisingly, Ted's advice proved to be golden. It allowed me to explore my new life and settle into a rhythm and pace that suited me and my ambitions, all while taking care of my wellbeing.\n\nSo, give yourself permission to adjust gradually to your new life. Transitioning from the intense routine of elite sport takes time. Be patient and avoid pressuring yourself to find all the answers immediately. It took me around six months to settle into a new rhythm, and that's perfectly okay. Remember, each person's journey is unique.\n\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of retiring from elite sport is the opportunity to spend more quality time with friends and family. Embrace the freedom of attending gatherings and events without the constant need to prioritise training and competition. These moments create lasting memories that truly enrich our lives.\n\nAfter dedicating countless hours to training and competitions, I've indulged in the simple pleasures I missed. Taking a summer holiday (my first in 23 years) and engaging in activities I used to refrain from due to the risk of injury has been truly liberating. It's a small but significant reminder that life holds many new adventures beyond the world of sports.\n\nThe lessons learned through your athletic journey are invaluable beyond the realm of sports. Embrace the challenges you faced, for they have prepared you to overcome obstacles in life. The pursuit of excellence, discipline, and resilience you developed as an athlete will serve you well in any endeavour you choose to pursue.\n\nWhile retiring from elite sport may mean a decrease in training intensity, it's crucial to maintain a fitness routine. Your body has been honed and crafted for your sport, and staying active will contribute to your overall wellbeing. Adapt your training programme to suit your new lifestyle and focus on exercises you enjoy. Not only will it benefit your physical health, but it will also boost your self-esteem and support your mental wellbeing.\n\nAlthough I still have a deep love for athletics and acknowledge all it has given me, I find that I don't long for it in my retired life. In the future, I envision utilising my wealth of experience to contribute to and assist the sport meaningfully. Reflecting on my career, I have no regrets. This stems from the knowledge that I wholeheartedly committed to becoming the best athlete I could be.\n\nRetiring from elite sport has its challenges and marks the beginning of an exciting journey filled with new opportunities and personal growth. Remember that you are more than an athlete. Embrace the uncertainty, explore new paths, and set new goals. Cherish the relationships that matter, indulge in life's simple pleasures, and honour the lessons learned from your athletic journey. Gradually adapt to your new life, prioritise your wellbeing, and enthusiastically approach this new chapter. It's a world full of endless possibilities!"
