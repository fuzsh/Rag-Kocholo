        "text": "Thank you for attending the session on Thursday. We hope you have found it helpful, insightful and enjoyable.\n\nThe subject of resilience and wellbeing is a complex one which is continually evolving with more research and opinion. Our present position is probably best described as \"if it's not broken don't try and fix it\". In other words, if you feel you are responding well to life's stressors, sleeping well and have good levels of enjoyment from life and work then perhaps it's best to not change too much. If, however, some of the stressors overwhelm you from time-to-time, you seem to have no time for regular movement, work/life balance feels out of kilter, or sleep quality is not great then maybe it's worth tweaking something.\n\nOur objective, therefore, is to provide you with a framework, robustly researched and tested, within which you can explore your own self-awareness, habits and personal development. The framework is grounded in the neurophysiology of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) which, when functioning well, provides us with the self-regulating mechanisms to adapt through stress to become more resilient. The chronic accumulation of stress, or traumatic incidents/episodes of stress, can cause the ANS to become dysregulated. In simple terms we lose our capacity to not only manage stress but also to adapt and grow/become more resilient. Ultimately this will hinder and undermine performance at work, home, social life and deplete our energy. It can be experienced in many complex and subtle ways. Today's environmental stressors often cause a relentless sense of being on the go...so even if our stressors are not too bad we can find ourselves unconsciously in the sympathetic branch for too long which results in unnecessarily levels of fatigue. So, even at the mild end of the spectrum we need to be aware of the wellbeing risks of prolonged fatigue and not enjoying sufficient rest, sleep and recovery.\n\nA central message is to reflect on the recovery side of the equation:\n\nstress + recovery = resilience\n\nWe will always experience stress but it can be successfully managed and harnessed for positive growth if we understand how to recover effectively. This is explained in more detail in the links you will find below.\n\nIf anyone wants signposting to more in-depth reading on any aspect of what you have listened to, please don't hesitate to ask. There isn't one book which pulls all our content together but there are great specialists out there on parts of it. We have compiled our own resources to try and help and these are explained further below together with links you can use to access them.\n\nWe would suggest you read the 90 second guide to resilience before the ANS and Social Engagement resource. It is a more complex read but very helpful for managing/leading others and also it has relevance to parenting. Please ask for more clarification if you need it because it is a highly nuanced area. The 'expert' who has developed this over the past 30 years has had a significant influence on the world of therapy/personal development in the USA and globally.\n\nresilience slide presentation\n\na 90 second read on resilience which attempts to fill in some of the commentary that is delivered with the slide deck\n\na short read about an important feature of the nervous system which we talked about - the social engagement system - this is what Nathan had inadvertently neglected when pushing himself hard to overcome the disappointment of failing to win a medal at the World Championships. So despite ticking all the normal wellbeing boxes (sleep, nutrition etc.) he developed chronic fatigue which plagued him for 3 years\n\na link to further reading.\n\nClick the buttons below to view:"
