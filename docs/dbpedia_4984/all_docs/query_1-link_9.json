He spoke to the boys about dealing with injury, resilience, coping with pressure and anecdotes from his illustrious career.\n\nManager Chris Hackett used to train with Douglas and the group were given the chance to ask questions at the end of the talk.\n\nHead of Academy Player Care Eddie Odhiambo said\n\n“Nathan is an incredible athlete but also an incredible person. He’s got to where he is because of his determination and mindset, and we’ve been wanting him to speak to the group for a long time. The boys were great, asked lots of excellent questions and really took the opportunity to pick the brain of someone who has achieved at the highest level.”\n\n\"We want this group to think about their performance in and out of football, both physically and mentally, and this talk opitimised that.\""
