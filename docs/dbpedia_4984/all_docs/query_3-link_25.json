        "text": "1. Know when competition season is\n\nEvery athlete’s schedule is different, depending on their sport. For me as a triple jumper, indoor season is January - March and outdoor season is May - September, with major championships taking place in July and August. During those two months in particular, I’m going to be purely focused on competing. I’ll have very little free time and I won’t want to be trying new products.\n\nOf course competition season is when brands want to work with athletes the most because that’s when a lot of the attention will be on them. However these conversations should be had months in advance ideally. This allows us to test the product in training and therefore not risk affecting competition. After September is a great time for new brands to engage with me personally, as my schedule is more relaxed. Find out when your athlete's core competition season is and try to make sure you’ve approached them way before then. If they like your brand and product, they’ll continue using it/wearing it all year round including competition season.\n\n2. Consider a holistic approach\n\nMany athletes take a very holistic approach to their training regime. So try to consider how your brand and products might fit into their overall lifestyle. Our needs go beyond sportswear and energy drinks! For example, I recently worked with a bedding brand because I have to make sure I look after my recovery and sleep is the best form of recovery. It sounds like an unlikely fit at first but it was ideal for me and the messaging worked for them too.\n\nSome suggestions: Anything that makes food preparation easier or anything that boosts recovery and/or performance will go down a treat. Many athletes travel a lot but sitting down for long periods isn’t good for the body so products that make long journeys more comfortable and less of a strain, will be well received.\n\n3. Limit long distance travelling\n\nI’m based in Birmingham and that’s where my training base is. Depending where I am in the season, I could be training twice a day. Therefore getting to London and back isn’t often feasible in terms of timings but also sitting down for extended periods isn’t great for sportspeople. At the very least be mindful they’ll likely want to keep traveling to a minimum during core training periods. But if you can, try to arrange meetings at the athletes training base. They’ll really appreciate that you’ve made the effort to go to them, which will be great for your relationship.\n\n4. Think of training regimes as set in stone\n\nUnsurprisingly many brands want to get footage or photography of us doing something active and often request this. Be mindful that asking an athlete to do this is similar to us doing an extra training session, which can disrupt our meticulously planned regime. My way around this is to allow brand reps to attend training sessions.\n\nMy agent always stipulates that the session will be as normal with no disruptions, so that my training isn’t affected. To be honest, I’m actually happy to do a few extra things if I’ve got the time and it isn’t too strenuous. However a slight bug bear of mine is when I am asked to do a jump from a full approach. Now this is specific to triple jump, however it’s likely similar situations could occur in other sports. A jump from a full approach (40 meters) is extremely intense on the body and takes so much power and adrenaline that I’d never do this outside of a competition. For example, up to 22 times my bodyweight goes through my leg when I land a phase. It’s always clearly stated beforehand that I won’t do this but some brand reps ask anyway. It’s really cheeky and makes it a bit awkward.\n\nMy advice here is let the athlete choose what type of activities they do. If you really want to make requests, either check with an agent or research it first. It sounds obvious but it might not be as simple as they make it look.\n\n5. Factor in lead times for robust testing\n\nI take my endorsements very seriously and I would never promote something that I haven’t tested myself. It goes without saying that if it’s some kind of food or drink, it must be drugs tested. Being on Instagram and other social channels means that people can ask questions about products instantly and I want to make sure I can give genuine answers. I can’t do that without a rigorous review. For brands it’s important to make sure this is factored into plans. If you’re expecting coverage a week after posting out your samples, you could be disappointed."
