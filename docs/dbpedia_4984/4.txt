BRITISH triple jumper Nathan Douglas has been ruled out for the rest of the season after rupturing ankle ligaments in a freak training accident.

The 28-year-old Oxford athlete, a European silver medallist in 2006, sustained the injury by putting his foot through a plyometric box, a piece of equipment used for jump training.

Douglas will now miss August’s World Championships in Daegu, South Korea.

He wrote on Twitter: “Tweeps, unfortunately my 2011 season is over before it has even begun, due to a freak accident at the end of what had been a successful Aviva warm weather training camp in Italy, where my foot went straight through a plyometrics box while hopping, resulting in two ligament ruptures in my ankle.

“Trust me, I will be doing everything to get fit and healthy as quickly and efficiently as possible while aiming to compete in the 2012 indoor season.”

Douglas joins British team-mate Steph Twell in missing the whole campaign. The Commonwealth 1500 metres bronze medallist fractured her ankle in a cross-country race in Belgium in February.

UK Athletics head coach Charles van Commenee backed Douglas to come back strongly and return to his best in time for the London 2012 Olympics.

He said: “After four years of having to deal with various injury problems, it was looking like this season Nathan was going to be better than ever before.

“It’s a real blow that in literally his last session on his last day of warm weather training he has once again suffered misfortune, and nothing he or his coach could have done could have prevented it.

“The injury will cost him his 2011 season, but I have been impressed by what I saw of Nathan prior to this setback and I am confident he can still achieve something special in 2012.”
