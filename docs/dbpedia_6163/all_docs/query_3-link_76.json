        "text": "Since joining McKinsey, Philip has worked with organisations, agencies, and institutions to guide global transformation programmes that deliver bottom-line results and boost organisational capabilities and health.\n\nTo ensure lasting value, Philip partners with clients on both the technical and cultural aspects of change management. Through coaching, leadership development, and capability building, he directs efforts to build alignment and create large-scale change through an organisation. With his support, clients have implemented multiyear transformations that have engaged the whole organisation, fostered new mind-sets and behaviours, and delivered sustainable benefits.\n\nIn partnership with leaders in aerospace, defence, infrastructure, and other sectors in Europe and the Middle East, Philip helps tackle complex operational and strategic challenges. He brings deep expertise in programme management, operations, logistics, procurement, and supply-chain management to help organisations identify and eliminate costly inefficiencies and develop programmes to meet their core objectives.\n\nExamples of his recent client work include the following:\n\nleading a major private-sector transformationâas interim transformation directorâto instil new capabilities and mind-sets across 11 countries and five businesses, developing a programme to deliver profitable growth and deliver cost savings through highly effective portfolio management\n\nhelping a European defence force build capabilities for lasting change, achieving significant cost efficiencies by designing, scaling, and managing a transformation programme across the organisation\n\npartnering with a public-sector agency on a transformation programme to architect robust pipeline tracking and oversight while managing complex stakeholder needs, also resulting in substantial procurement savings by building new capabilities\n\nleading a strategic delivery partnership for a European governmentâs operational excellence highways programme that changed employee mind-sets and behaviours, reduced costs, improved safety, and created a better customer experience\n\nPrior to joining McKinsey, Philip worked as a senior consultant serving private and public-sector clients. Before that he served in the British Army with a specialisation in operational logistics. In 2006, Philip was made a MBE for his work on redesigning the UK Ministry of Defence operational supply chain. He is a certified MSP programme manager, PRINCE2 practitioner, and a qualified information-systems programme manager."
