        "text": "View from upper management\n\nA crow advises a cat to sit on a tree to do nothing safely. A dog attacks the cat on the ground. Moral: To do nothing, be high up. Two hilsa fish encounter an older, wiser fish asking about water. The young fish later wonder what water is. A pessimist and optimist debate if things can get worse.\n\nThird eye: Drunk BJP MLA accosts Pankaja; sensitivity by Kiwis appreciated & it’s time for consultants\n\nPresident Droupadi Murmu's visit to New Zealand saw Khalistani activists kept away from her event. In Maharashtra, CM Eknath Shinde and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar hired different election strategists. A drunken BJP MLA embarrassed BJP leader Pankaja Munde at an event, with videos of the incident going viral just months before the elections.\n\nStock picks of the week: 5 stocks with consistent score improvement and upside potential of up to 34%\n\nThis week's movement of Nifty and Sensex, once again confirms the underlying sentiment on the Street, which is that for a week or few trading sessions, bears might strike, but it is bulls who are still in power in every corner of the Street. Which is why, one has to be bullish, but given that the valuations are not cheap, it would be better that while being bullish, one is cautious and selective also. These have to be applied at both the levels, on the amount of exposure one is taking and the stocks which one is buying. The stocks should have good fundamentals and the score should have seen some improvement. These selected stocks depict a strong upward trajectory in their overall average score. This implies that there has been a significant improvement in their market outlook in the given time frame.\n\nIf looks could skill, India can get global\n\nIndian companies are investing in retraining their CXO-level leaders to capitalize on the country’s growth potential and reduce management churn, ensuring they can compete globally. This approach not only enhances managerial diversity but also broadens entrepreneurial opportunities. The focus on skilling extends beyond top management, with a growing emphasis on entry-level employees. As India aims to become a global manufacturing hub, companies are urged to collaborate with academic institutions to make the workforce more employable. The key to sustainable employment growth lies in scaling businesses, particularly small enterprises.\n\nStock picks of the week: 4 stocks with consistent score improvement and upside potential of up to 35%\n\nAfter many months or one may even say that after a gap of a year, Indian markets got a reminder that global markets also matter. But there are some good learnings from this week's episode. After all the volatility we are still the best performing market, so bears will have to wait before they can make any serious attempt to control the street. But because valuations are high, it would be better to still be cautious both the amount of exposure one is taking and more importantly the stocks which one is buying should have good fundamentals and the score should have seen some improvement. These selected stocks depict a strong upward trajectory in their overall average score. This implies that there has been a significant improvement in their market outlook in the given time frame."
