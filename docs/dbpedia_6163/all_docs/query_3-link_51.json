        "text": "PRTM Expands Energy Practice with Hiring of Masdar Institute Graduate\n\nOperational strategy firm to leverage Masdar Institute’s talent base to further focus on renewable energy and sustainable development\n\nDubai, UAE—July 3, 2011— Global management consulting firm PRTM announced today the addition of Emily Manuel, a graduate of the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, a preeminent academic and research institution focusing on advanced technologies and sustainability. The move augments PRTM’s Energy & Industrial Practices, particularly in the areas of renewable energy and regional industrial development.\n\nPRTM’s long track record in the UAE and Middle East includes work with governments and commercial organizations to develop and implement plans to reduce energy consumption and overall carbon emissions, and to optimize the use of water, waste and transportation resources and developing eco-cities. For example, PRTM and the Masdar Institute collaborated in 2010 on sustainability initiatives in multiple industries in Abu Dhabi.\n\nManuel is among the first to graduate from Masdar Institute, which has achieved an excellent reputation in only a few years, in part due to its close collaboration with government, industry and academia, especially the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At PRTM, she will focus on renewable energy, sustainable transportation and industrial cluster development.\n\nIn just a few years, Masdar Institute has gained a pre-eminent place as the leading academic and research institution focusing on advanced technologies and sustainability, thanks in part to its collaboration with government, industry and academia, especially the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nDr. Lamya Nawaf Fawwaz, Executive Director – Public Affairs, Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, said: “We are delighted that Emily Manuel, one of our graduates, will be working with a respected operational strategy firm like PRTM. The first batch of graduates from Masdar offer companies a niche talent pool of experts for various renewable energy and clean technology applications. We are confident the recruitment of one of our graduates will encourage more companies to seriously consider this pool of experts for employment in renewable energy. This is indeed a proud moment that will position us among other globally renowned academic institutions.”\n\nBill Lay, director at PRTM, said, “Today, no industry faces greater challenges and opportunities than the energy sector. From world economic realities like dwindling supply and increasing prices, changing regulatory landscape, increased competition and outdated infrastructure, more and more companies recognize that innovative operational management provides new market advantages during these unpredictable times.”\n\nHe continued, “Energy companies realize that sustainable development is the only way forward, requiring new and innovative operational execution. The UAE is both at the heart and the leading edge of this trend, and PRTM continues to strengthen its position in this vital area.”"
