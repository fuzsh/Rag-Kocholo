        "text": "In a nutshell, a consultant is hired to share their knowledge and expertise to help businesses attain their goals. They are there to solve problems – or as a consultant would phrase it – help you meet your challenges.\n\nWhat Types Are There?\n\nWhat type of consultant you need depends on the issues you want to resolve. There are many different types of consultants, but in general, they cover five areas of business.\n\nManagement and Strategy\n\nManagement consultants add value at the highest level. Ideal if you are looking to expand your market, re-organize your company for maximum efficiency, increase the capability of your existing organization, or even buy out a smaller competitor.\n\nOperations\n\nAn operations consultant can help you improve the quality and efficacy of your production process. Other consultants are experts in quality control systems and can help you make changes that will reduce defects.\n\nIT\n\nTechnology is a fast-growing area for consulting, as these demands impact companies every day. An IT consultant can help you to develop a new system or integrate your old systems so that they work together.\n\nHR\n\nPeople are the backbone of your business. If you need to improve the overall recruitment and then maintain the satisfaction of your employees, recruit top talent, and retain your best performers. HR consultants can help with this.\n\nMarketing\n\nBusinesses need always to be one step ahead with their marketing concepts. Whether you need a new logo for your company, a new market position for one of your brands, or a new social media strategy, marketing consultants can help.\n\nHow Do I Choose?\n\nChoosing the right business consultant isn’t easy. There are many factors to consider. So where do you begin?\n\nSearch\n\nUse your local resources, organizations, and the internet to identify candidates.\n\nYou might want to ask colleagues in similar businesses for their recommendations.\n\nInterview\n\nConduct in-depth interviews. Is the candidate a member of a professional consultants’ organization? Check with that organization to see if they are in good standing.\n\nCheck that the candidate has the appropriate business insurance, according to Brokerlink Business Insurance this can be a complicated area, so get advice if you are unsure.\n\nIs the candidate willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement and ask about fees and other costs?\n\nAre They the Right Choice?\n\nHow long will they need before they can propose solutions? Will they help you implement changes in your organization and how?\n\nCan you work efficiently with the candidate? Do they fit with your business culture, your employees, and especially with you. Think about qualities such as a sense of humor, tactfulness, direct communication, and integrity. Check references and insurance documents.\n\nTo Sum Up\n\nA business consultant can add value to any company. Once you’ve decided on which division of the organization and in what capacity they will perform, you can set out to find just the right one.\n\nThey need to come with solid credentials and need to be able to hit-the-ground-running from the moment they join. Hire one now, and watch your business soar!\n\nWith the economy thriving right now, many entrepreneurs are looking around and noting that it’s a wondrous time to start their own business. Few professionals have enjoyed such stellar success in recent years as business consultants, whose valuable expertise steers their clients towards profitable waters while avoiding any financial calamity along the way. Starting your own consulting business is easier said than done, though, and it would be foolish to walk into this endeavor without having researched ahead of time.\n\nHere are some inside tips for how to start a consulting business, and the pitfalls you’ll likely encounter on your way to fame and fortune.\n\nWhat kind of consultant do you want to be?\n\nPerhaps the most important question that any prospective entrepreneur should be asking themselves is what kind of consultant you want to be, as there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to this industry that can guarantee you success. Some business consultants focus on IT matters, for instance, bolstering the digital operations of their clients while offering them useful advice on what technological changes to expect in the near-future. Elsewhere, financial consultants work tirelessly to dig failing business out of the red and get them back on their feet, and a myriad of other consultant styles also exist to pick from.\n\nIf you don’t have a clear image in your mind of what kind of consultant you intend to be, your business will be a failure from the very get-go. Know your skills, experience, and the extent to which you can advise businesses wisely, and you’ll have an easier time determining what kind of consultancy operation you’re looking to start. Regardless of who you are or what you’re an expert in, though, several common pitfalls can cause your business to come crumbling in on itself only just after it’s gotten up and running.\n\nAny entrepreneur eager to start their own consulting business should set some time aside to review the common mistakes that such businesses make far too often in the pursuit of greater profitability. A failure to take the mistakes of others into account when charting out your own business will inevitably lead you to suffer from similar errors. Furthermore, studying up on what not to do often helps you determine what it is that you do best and what it is that you should avoid handling personally. As always, remember that your personal strengths are going to be an instrumental facet of your success when it comes to starting this business.\n\nKnow how to charge your clients\n\nThe next thing to figure out is what you’re going to charge clients, and how you can identify good benchmarks by which to compare yourself to others in your industry. U.S. consulting spending topped an astonishing $58 billion back in 2016, so it’s safe to say there’s plenty of money out there for you to grab with both hands – the only question is how you’ll arrive at an affordable yet competitive rate which separates you from others. You should also be asking yourself how you intend to protect your business, as a consultant can rapidly lose everything in the event of an unexpected disaster which devastates their business infrastructure.\n\nKnowing the benefits of having business insurance is something that aspiring consultants should have accomplished well ahead of the time that they start their business. It’s never too late to learn, though, so don’t think that you can continue to shun insurance and other protective measures for your consultancy just because you’ve avoided calamity thus far.\n\nFinally, you’ll want to consider how you’re going to go about differentiating yourself from your competitors with a savvy marketing campaign and digital presence that enables clients to find you easily.\n\nMaking your consultancy known\n\nYou’ll never make a fortune as a business consultant until you make your consultancy known with a stellar ad campaign or digital presence that inspires clients to flock to your services. The importance of having a robust web presence in this day and age can’t be overstated; you should have social media operations up and running by the time your business opens its doors and should have some means by which you’ll be paying for online advertisements to lure in your first clients.\n\nYou should also understand how important networking is going to be to the success of your company. Consultants who don’t know how to schmooze will never succeed, as this business is heavily dependent upon forging strong personal relationships that enable you to cash in on your extensive expertise. If you read up on how consultants get clients thanks to their networking chops, you’ll appreciate the importance of getting your name out there.\n\nFocus on protecting your business from unexpected disasters while forging a strong web presence for yourself, and your consultancy will take off in no time. Before long, you’ll have climbed to the top of the dog pile thanks to your expertise and the stellar ways by which you’re marketing it to the public.\n\nManagement consultants and accountants provide different services to the organization. However, both their contributions are vital to the regular operations and future decisions of top management.\n\nArea of Concentration\n\nThe main responsibility of consultants is to resolve the business dilemma of their clients. To execute this, they analyze the scenario presented to them, along with the factors affecting it. This connotes going into the details of the market situation, the company’s financial status, competitors’ strategies and capability of human resources. The recommendations of consultants guide top management in making decisions related to their operations. Management consultants have diverse and dynamic role for they can settle any problem of a company, and they are sent to different sectors, too.\n\nAccountants, on the other hand, focus on managing financial information. They maintain accounting records, develop company budget, process payable and receivables, audit financial documents and compute business taxes. Their records are considered crucial because they reveal the status of the company. They can tell whether the company is financially thriving or is doomed to bankruptcy. Many companies have their own accounting departments, but some just outsource accounting services to external providers.\n\nManagement consultants often use accounting documents and consult with accountants as they work on a project. These, among others, become part of the bases of their recommendations.\n\nSignificant Skills and Values\n\nManagement consultants are required to have critical thinking skills. They must view the scenario from different angles to encapsulate all factors. Breaking complex ideas into simple ones and integrating bits of information to get the entire picture help them understand the situation. Apart from these, they need to be determined enough to address their client’s needs. This may mean working overtime just to beat deadlines.\n\nThe most important value accountants must have is accuracy. They need to be meticulous with numbers to generate timely and precise reports for top management. Further, accountants must also hold on to honesty; otherwise, the system will be prone to corruption and fraud. Maintaining objectivity and avoiding conflict of interest are the other requirements.\n\nBoth management consultants and accountants must be very comfortable working with numbers since they’ll deal with figures every day. They must be proficient in using spreadsheets, as well. Possessing excellent communication and organizational skills is another qualification that backs them up in performing their responsibilities.\n\nEducational Attainment\n\nManagement consultants can have different educational background, but it often is business-oriented or covers an MBA.\n\nIn the other field, professionals must have a degree in accounting. Those who take the licensure examination and become Certified Public Accountant get a better pay and more work opportunities. The license indicates they have reached a higher degree of technical expertise and professionalism.\n\nYou Might Also Like...\n\nManagement consultants are known not only for their prestigious role but for their numerous travel engagements. Travel seems to be one of the defining characteristics of consultants regardless of the firm they work for. Working as a consultant generally provides plenty of opportunities to travel, both locally and internationally.\n\nHowever, many people have a lot misinformation about consulting travel. Here’s the truth about what it is like to travel as a consultant.\n\nConsultants DO NOT Always Travel in Business Class Flights to Explore Continents Every Week\n\nWhile yes, business class flights are provided for select projects and distances, it is not all the time. Consultants indeed fly business class but they also fly an equal number of economy flights. Also, international projects wherein you’ll need to traverse five different countries in the course of a week of two would be rather occasional. Most travels as a consultant are for domestic projects.\n\nConsultants DO NOT Spend Months in the Farthest Flung Areas\n\nThis is the extreme opposite of being overly glamorous. Many people also think that consultants are often required to travel to far-flung areas. While yes, it is not impossible for a management consultant to find himself working in a city that has a few redeeming qualities, such would happen probably just once or twice throughout his career. Consultants work most of the time in large cities and developed countries.\n\nYou Will Also Work While Travelling\n\nYes, there would be time that you’ll need to create a PowerPoint presentation on a flight to make it to the crucial meeting, but it does not happen every single time. Consultants tend to spend part of flight time working only for international travel projects. Why? Because such projects have a higher level of pressure to succeed, both from the client and the firm. It is true that you’ll need to beat a few deadlines wherein you may have to rush from the airport to the client. But the key phrase “a few” must be highly considered.\n\nConsultants DO HAVE a Choice about Where They Work\n\nIt is not true that consultants don’t have a choice when it comes to project location and selection. Client choice heavily depends on two things – consultant’s performance on previous projects and seniority. But that doesn’t mean that the mediocre-performing, junior-level consultants would be staffed on lower-interest projects in less-attractive locales. They too can sway staffing decisions in their favor. Staffing is done based on one’s background, interests, preferences and ability to build relationships with the firm’s management\n\nNOT Everything Is Reimbursable\n\nFlights, baggage fees, and travel insurance are reimbursable consulting travel expenses. However, finance charges are usually not reimbursable. Generally, firms will pay for it immediately so you won’t have to carry the cost on your credit card. As far as the airline and hotel upgrade fees, they are seldom reimbursable. Also, incidentals outside the normal meals are typically not covered. In terms of ground transportation, that is generally covered too. However, you should not expect a client to reimburse a limo service. That is just unreasonable, right?\n\nConsultants DO NOT Effortlessly Rack up User Hotel Points/Miles to Enjoy Countless Free Vacations\n\nMany people think that because consultants tend to travel a lot, they easily become Mr. Platinum, Gold, Diamond, Titanium or what have you. Many think that consulting travel means free upgrades on every flight, on every hotel room due to accumulated points of frequent travel. While yes, many consultants do rack up some serious points, it is because they have been in the industry longer than others. Consultants enjoying a certain “status” on every major airline or hotel chain are more likely the senior ones. So it’s really not effortless. And remember, such status won’t last forever. Once you quit consulting, you’ll not be able to enjoy such lifestyle.\n\nA consulting firm’s reputation plays an important part in the company’s standing and success. Because of this, consulting applicants take a firm’s status and background into consideration during the early stages of recruitment.\n\nFor consultants in the Asia-Pacific region, working for a prestigious firm can solidify one’s position in the industry and create new career opportunities. Consulting companies are careful to protect their reputation, as this could also reflect poorly on the clients they work with on a regular basis.\n\nAdditionally, this is another reason why consulting recruiters are highly selective during the interview process, choosing only the charismatic few who can actively represent their firm.\n\nTop 25 Most Prestigious Management Consulting Firms in Asia-Pacific\n\n#1: McKinsey & Company Asia\n\nMcKinsey & Company dominates the global rankings as the best consulting firm in 2014.

Lew can be reached at Lew@Consulting101Book.com.\n\nCivil war general William Tecumseh Sherman is famous for saying “War is hell”. As one who has never engaged in battle, I can only imagine how true that is.\n\nI have to believe that the business world equivalent of hell is terminating someone’s employment.\n\nWhen you relieve an employee of their duties, it usually comes under one of two broad categories. The person is fired for cause: Perhaps they were caught being unethical or, after efforts to improve their performance, they have proven to be incapable of performing their job. While firing someone for unethical activity may not be easy, it is probably the least difficult way of letting someone go.\n\nFiring someone for incompetence is a little more difficult. There may have been an attitude that you had to deal with from the employee, but it may have been someone who tried hard and just couldn’t cut it.\n\nThe second category of letting an employee go is through layoff. Anyone who has been in the marketplace over the past six or seven years has almost certainly had experience with this type of layoff.\n\nLayoffs occur when an organization has over-hired staff in the anticipation of an increased or continued need for productivity. Market situations changed causing the organization to have too much staff, or at least too much skill in a low demand area.\n\nThe economic recovery has been a slow and jagged upward climb. Any manager who was involved in layoffs from the “great recession” is certain to be hesitant to aggressively hire back loads of staff.\n\nAfter experiencing the difficult and life changing face-to-face conversations, the resulting fallout of morale issues and the monetary cost from an HR perspective, a manager will make her next hiring decision with great caution.\n\nMany organizations have turned to consulting as an alternative to manage their staffing needs. A basic core of full-time employees is usually needed in most organizations for knowledge retention. For any additional needs, organizations have found that consulting provides the nimbleness to meet their needs in many ways.\n\nBusiness Advisory Services\n\nBusinesses have found that turning to management consulting firms provides industry insights to anticipate market needs and develop strategies that provide them with readiness to market changes instead of being reactive to them. This allows them to change their staffing practices before they overload with skills that will soon be redundant.\n\nProject Teams\n\nHaving a more proactive strategy allows an organization to define and prioritize the efforts that make the most sense for their long-term sustainability. Rather than staffing full-time employees for these projects, they can contract with consulting firms to provide the knowledge and experience to manage the project, implement the initiative and train up their existing full-time staff successfully. When the project is complete, the team leaves as expected, without career interruptions, morale issues or severance packages. The next project team, with their own specialized skills can come in for the next project.\n\nStaff Augmentation\n\nThere are times when an organization simply needs a surgical strike. They have a temporary need for a consultant/contractor to fill a skills gap for a specific or indefinite period of time. A temporary computer programmer or even a temporary CFO, contracted until a full-time employee can be hired is an excellent opportunity for both the organization and the individual.\n\nWorkers are joining the consulting ranks in record numbers. This phenomenon is largely driven by demand created by organizations who have found consulting to be an excellent approach to reducing the risk of reductions in force. It is also a great opportunity for knowledge workers to join the consulting industry and learn what consulting is all about.\n\nYou Might Also Like..."
