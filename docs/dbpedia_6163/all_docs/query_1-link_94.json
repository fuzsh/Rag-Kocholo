The partnership was created by the merger of two accounting firms, Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand, in 1998. As one of the largest professional services firm in the world, PwC has member firms in over 150 countries and employs 236,000 people. Its member firm in the Philippines is Isla Lipana & Co., which has been an existing member of Price Waterhouse International - predating the formation of PwC in 1973. PwC is organized according to service lines: assurance and audit, advisory, tax, and internal firm services. As a service provider, it strives to build productive, long term relationships with clients based on high ethical standards and innovative solutions.\n\nII.\n\nHistory\n\nFigure 1. PwC Global’s Timeline\n\n4\n\nThe international partnership of PricewaterhouseCoopers is one of the world's top accountancy firms. It was created in 1998 by the merger of two companies - namely Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand, each with their own historical roots. During the 1890s, both companies established their presence in the United States. The American accounting as a profession was then a new undertaking, with limited experience, little or no organized training facilities, and practically no authoritative means of establishing and enforcing professional standards. Early founders of both firms were deeply involved in professional organizations of the time and were instrumental in establishing the standards and terminology of the existing accounting profession. By maintaining a firm stand on matters of professional ethics, and by relying on British practice and precedent, these accountants played an important role in developing American auditing standards.\n\nHistory of Price Waterhouse Price Waterhouse was founded in London in 1849 by Samuel Lowell Price, who wanted to take advantage of England's recent parliamentary laws requiring the examination of a company's financial statements and records. The public accounting profession was growing so rapidly during these years that in 1865, ​he was joined in partnership by William H. Holyland and Edwin Waterhouse​, to help with the expanding business. By 1874, the company name changed to Price, Waterhouse & Co. During the late 1860s and 1870s, while primarily working on arbitrations, bankruptcies, and liquidations, Price and Waterhouse also developed a practice of introducing borrowers to prospective lenders. At that time, many privately owned businesses were converted to public companies and, consequently, reports on earnings signed by reputable accountants soon became an indispensable ingredient in any firm's prospectus. In 1873, the firm conducted their first US project. The growing US practice led to the establishment of a permanent PW presence in the Western hemisphere, which began with the opening of the office on 45 Broadway, New York City in 1890 by company agent Lewis D. Jones. He was soon joined in America by William J. Caesar, who opened an office in Chicago. In 1895, the newly created Jones, Caesar & Co. was designated as an agent of Price Waterhouse.\n\n5 After Jones’ early death, Arthur L. Dickinson replaced retiring Caesar as a senior partner of the American firm. The firm enjoyed solid reputation and high business volume. By the turn of the century, it built up a roster of clients which covered a wide range of industrial and commercial fields in most sections of the country. Branch offices began to open throughout the USA and in other parts of the world. In 1907, Joseph E. Sterett, an American with his own successful practice, joined the company. The American firm's name changed from Jones, Caesar, Dickinson, Wilmot & Co. to Dickinson, Wilmot & Sterret. By the time Dickinson retired as a senior partner in 1911, the firm grew large enough to need the committee structure. In 1913, the name of the American firm was dropped in favor of the English name Price Waterhouse & Co. In 1982, Price Waterhouse World Firm was formed. History of Coopers & Lybrand In 1854, William Cooper established his own practice in London, which seven years later became Cooper Brothers. The firm's history in the United States began in 1898, when Robert H. Montgomery, William M. Lybrand, Adam A. Ross Jr., and his brother T. Edward Ross formed Lybrand, Ross Brothers and Montgomery in Philadelphia. During the early 20th century, their offices spread across the country and in Europe. Their explosive growth ended with Great Depression, which forced the firm to reorganize organizational structure and to shift the focus from expansion towards flexible specialization, such as finding new types of services (tax services, management consulting) for existing clientele. In the 1930s, LRB&M was contracted by the federal government to investigate several banks and trust companies throughout the United States - the work of unprecedented magnitude, ranging from investigations to a detailed audit followed by liquidation proceedings. After the death of Col. Montgomery in 1953, a new generation of leaders came to the fore: Alvin R. Jennings, Walter A. Staub, Philip L. Defliese, Norman E. Auerbach. Under their leadership, the firm experienced a major transformation. From a medium-size company focused on auditing and was primarily national in scope, they transitioned into a multinational player with a growing mix of consulting services. The boldest step they took was a 1957 merger between Cooper Brothers & Co (UK), McDonald, Currie and Co. (Canada), and Lybrand, Ross Bros & Montgomery (US), forming Coopers & Lybrand - a truly international powerhouse, operating through 79 offices in 19 countries. 1950s also saw the addition of an autonomous line of\n\n6 specialization in management consulting services. The company acquired a more formal organizational structure and continued a policy of selective mergers, including an important addition of Scovell, Vellington & Co. in 1962. In 1973, the American firm adopts the name Coopers and Lybrand. The globalization and information boom led to an increased interest in Knowledge Management, adding it to the existing mix of professional services. In 1990, Coopers & Lybrand merged with Deloitte Haskins & Sells in a number of countries around the world. The 1998 Merger Price Waterhouse made yet another attempt at a merger in 1997 and came to an agreement with Coopers & Lybrand. Although the merger was voted on by the 3,250 Price Waterhouse partners and the 5,250 Coopers & Lybrand partners, the merger met some opposition from the companies' clients and financial regulators. Christopher Pearce, finance director of Rentokil and chairman of a group representing ​FTSE 100 companies' finance directors, told the Economist t​ hat the merger will “reduce the choice for auditing services and increase the conflicts of interest”. These concerns, as well as those of financial regulators looking at conflicts of interest between consulting and auditing branches of the companies, did not stand in the way of the merger, which was completed in 1998. The combination of the fourth and sixth largest of the Big Six firms resulted in a new industry leader in terms of size and revenues, with approximately 13,000 employees and revenues estimated at $12 billion. In the area of management consulting, the merger created little overlap because the two founding firms specialized in separate industries. It resulted in a combined revenue of $1.6 billion, making the new PricewaterhouseCoopers second only to Arthur Andersen in consulting income. Nicholas G. Moore, chairman of Coopers & Lybrand International, became the chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and James J. Schiro, chief executive officer of Price Waterhouse, became the CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers. Revenues for the newly formed company reached $15.3 billion in 1998. The company continued to grow, acquiring several European consulting firms in the first half of 1999, including the France-based SV&GM Group, the Italian consulting firm Galgan & Merli, and Belgium-based KPMG Consulting. To support its rapid growth, the PricewaterhouseCoopers launched a brand positioning ad campaign in 1999 designed to attract new employees.\n\n7\n\nPwC: 1998 and Present The Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand merged in 1998 to grow in scale and more effectively compete for large clients. After the merger, the firm had a large professional consulting branch, generating much of its fees. Management Consulting Services (MCS) was the fastest growing and often most profitable area of the practice, though it was cyclical. The major cause for growth in the 1990s was the implementation of complex integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems for multinational companies. PwC came under increasing pressure to avoid conflicts of interests by not providing some consulting services, particularly financial systems design and implementation, to its audit clients. Since it audited a large portion of the world’s largest companies, this was beginning to limit its consulting market. These conflicts increased as additional services such as outsourcing of IT and back office operations were developed. For these reasons, in 2000, Ernst & Young was the first of the Big Four to sell its consulting services to Capgemini. Then came the financial auditing scandals of Enron, Worldcom and others, leading to the passage of the ​Sarbanes-Oxley Act​. Hewlett-Packard was in negotiations to purchase MCS for $17B prior to the scandal’s blast on the industry, but negotiations predictably broke down in 2000. SOX severely limited the interaction between management consulting and financial auditing services even more. In response, the MCS division of PwC re-branded as PwC Consulting. PwC announced in May 2002 that its consulting activities would be spun off as an independent entity and hired an outside CEO to run the global firm. An outside consultancy called Wolff Olins was hired to create a brand image for the new entity, called “Monday”. The firm’s CEO, Greg Brenneman, described the unusual name as “a real word, concise, recognizable, global and the right fit for a company that works hard to deliver results”. These plans were soon revised, however. In October 2002, PwC sold the entire consultancy business to International Business Machines (IBM) for approximately $3.9 billion in cash and stock. PwC’s consultancy business was absorbed into IBM Global Business Services, increasing the size and capabilities of IBM’s growing consulting practice. PwC started to rebuild its consulting practice with acquisitions such as Paragon Consulting Group and the commercial services business of BearingPoint in 2009. The firm\n\n8 continued this process by acquiring Diamond Management & Technology Consultants Inc. in November 2010 and PRTM in August 2011. In August 2012, the firm acquired Ant’s Eye View, a social media strategy development and consulting firm to build upon the its growing Management Consulting customer impact and customer engagement capabilities. In 2013, PwC decided to partner with Pneuron Corporation, an enterprise data integration firm. This was to strengthen data management capabilities and solutions specifically to help large firms manage massive amounts of data. The most recent and intriguing acquisition was announced on October 30, 2013 – PwC made public its intention to acquire Booz & Company. The deal was completed in April 2014, with the renaming of Booz & Co. to Strategy& following shortly afterwards. III.\n\nOrganizational Structure The PwC Network is composed of firms which are separate legal entities. These firms operate under the PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited (PwCIL), working together to provide high quality services on a global scale while retaining the advantages of being a local business. As member firms, they mutually agree to abide by and maintain certain common policies of the PwC Network. The PwC Network is not an international partnership, meaning its member firms are not legal partners to each other.\n\nFigure 2. PwC Global’s Organizational Structure\n\n9 PwC operates and has offices in over 150 countries. Each territory has a senior partner who is also the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. He/She manages the firm in accordance to the power and authority delegated to him by the firm's partners. The senior partner appoints a leadership team or an executive/strategy team who assists in discharging his/her responsibilities. Together, they establish and determine the effectiveness of the firm’s internal control, including the controls regarding the quality of the firm’s audit services such as assurance, tax and legal services, advisory, and internal firm services. PwCIL Governance Bodies The PwC International Limited (PwCIL) does not practice accountancy nor provide accounting services to its clients. It serves only as a coordinating entity for the member firms of the PwC Network. It has no control over the member firms’ exercise of professional judgment. The governance bodies of PwCIL include: 1. Global Board The Global Board is responsible for the governance of PwCIL, oversight of the Network Leadership Team, and approval of Network Standards. It also ensures accountability of the firms and protects PwCIL. The board members are elected by partners from all of the member firms of the PwC Network. 2. Network Leadership Team The Network Leadership team is responsible for setting the overall strategy of PwC Network and the standards which the member firms must follow. 3. Strategy Council The Strategy Council is composed of leaders from the largest PwC firms of the network. They are responsible for the strategic direction and alignment for the execution of the strategies of the PwC Network. 4. Network Executive Team The Network Executive Team is responsible for the coordination of all activities across all areas of the business. They also report to the Network Leadership Team.\n\n10\n\nIV.\n\nNetwork Firm - Isla Lipana\n\nFigure 3.

VI.\n\nPractices on Ethics and Maintaining Independence\n\nFigure 5. Isla Lipana & Co.’s Purpose Living Our Purpose PwC conduct their business within the framework of applicable professional standards, laws, and regulations together with PwC policies and standards. However, they also acknowledge that these standards, laws, regulations and policies do not govern all types of behaviour. As a result, they also have a Code of conduct for all PwC people and firms. The Code also provides a frame of reference for PwC firms to establish more specific supplements to address territorial issues. By choosing to serve as auditors of financial statements and to provide other types of professional services, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) firms and their partners and staff commit themselves to professional standards of objectivity, integrity and independence.\n\n22\n\nPwC’s Values and Behavior\n\nFigure 6.

Supervision over ethical matters in the firm is carried out by the regional Ethics and Business Conduct Leader. Each country has a local Ethics and Business Conduct Team responsible for promoting ethics locally. This includes, but is not limited to, communication and training to local country partners and staff.. Each PwC office has access to the detailed supplementary guidance to our Code of Conduct. This includes guidance on such matters as the receipt of gifts from clients, close personal relationships and how staff should proceed if they become aware of an unethical behaviour by any partner or employee.\n\n24\n\nThe firm has a region-wide tool accessible to all partners and staff to enable the sending of anonymous queries to a selected Ethics & Business Conduct Team. Individuals from outside of PwC, including our clients’ personnel, can submit a query, including in an anonymous manner, by using a global PwC communications tool available from ​http://pwc.com​. In the Philippines it is called the Ethics Hotline. When potential non-compliance with our Code of Conduct is reported or otherwise suspected, steps are taken to investigate, and where appropriate, remedy the situation. Partners and staff are encouraged to report and express their concerns in an fair, honest and respectful manner. PwC is committed to protecting individuals against retaliation. While the Code provides a broad range of guidance about the standards of integrity and business conduct, no code can address every situation that individuals are likely to encounter. The Code is one of the many tools professionals have to guide their behaviour. It is not meant to be a rule book. Another tool is the RADAR. RADAR: A framework for deciding the right thing to do\n\nFigure 8. RADAR The RADAR decision making framework helps an individual to think and to build skills in analysing ethical dilemmas, and, in doing so, make good decisions. In deciding on a course of action, the steps and questions can help guide an individual's approach.\n\n25\n\nRecognizing The Event Are you being asked to do something that you think might be wrong? Are you aware of potentially illegal or unethical conduct on the part of others at PwC or a client? Are you trying to make a decision and are you unsure about the ethical course of action? Assessing the situation Summarise and clarify your issue. Ask yourself, why the dilemma? Consider the options and consequences. Consider who may be affected. Consult others. Deciding what to do Determine your responsibility. Review all relevant facts and information. Refer to applicable PwC policies or professional standards. Assess the risks and how you could reduce them. Contemplate the best course of action. Consult others. Agreeing the way forward Test Your Decision. Review the “Ethics Questions to Consider.” Apply PwC’s values to your decision. Make sure you have considered PwC policies, laws and professional standards. Consult others–enlist their opinion of your planned action. Reporting and communicating Communicate decision and rationale to stakeholders. Reflect upon what was learned. Share your success stories with others\n\nCommon Practices within the Firm 1. Implementation of QWH (Quality Work Hours) Going home by 10PM to ensure a work-life balance amidst the busy season. 2. Give Me Five! Asking for five minutes from each other whenever needed to encourage courageous conversations. 3. Coaching. PwC is coaching. The associates are coached by their seniors and are also assigned a buddy who is a seasoned associate. 4. Implementation of a dress code to always wear business attire (no jeans, no shorts, no open toe sandal, etc.) in the office.\n\n26 5. Everyone is expected to arrive before 9 in the morning and to render at least 8 hours of service. Maintaining Independence All partners and staff have a role to play in ensuring that the firm and its personnel comply with relevant auditor independence requirements. Thus, the firm implemented an independence compliance program monitoring system and controls with the following key elements: a. Strict compliance on the firm's values (Act with Integrity, Work Together, Care, Reimagine the Possible, and Make a Difference) b. Self-assessment/confirmation process that is done by all partners and staff on annual basis c. Written independence policies and procedures d. An automated financial interest tracking system and global restricted entity list e. Ongoing independence training f.\n\nInternal monitoring of our system of independence and the related controls including annual testing of partner and directors independence\n\ng. Responsibility for independence and the system and controls vested in senior management h. An appropriate \"tone at the top\" and culture relating to independence Tone at the Top:\n\nThe firm’s leadership is committed to taking all actions\n\nrequired to ensure that PwC continues to stand for quality, independence, objectivity and ethical behavior. The firm’s leadership regularly sends communications to partners that include an emphasis on the importance of \"standing firm on quality\". i.\n\nPrompt reporting of personnel employment negotiations with clients\n\nj.\n\nReporting by personnel of perceived and real independence violations\n\nk. Disciplinary policies and processes l.\n\nControls over joint business relationships, non-audit relationships with audit clients and fee arrangements.\n\nThe program requires that partners and staff examine and document any concerns over the firm’s independence either in relation to the acceptance of a new client or a particular\n\n27 engagement. Before any non-assurance engagement is accepted for an audit client, an inquiry is made with the respective audit partner as to the permissibility of providing such services to that client. The assignment can only be accepted once the respective audit partner confirms that the proposed engagement is consistent with the applicable independence requirements. An important aspect of PwC’s independence culture is the central support provided to partners and staff in respect of independence relating to personal matters, non-audit services, fee arrangements or other types of relationships. Should a client not accept clear accounting guidance, audit results on material issues or behave in an unethical manner, the firm will support the engagement partner in making the appropriate reporting decision even if that may result in disengaging from or not accepting an assignment. Independence-related tools As a member of the PwC Network, the firm has access to a number of tools which support PwC member firms and their personnel in executing and complying with the independence policies and procedures. These include: ●\n\nCentral Entity Service​​ (“CES”) Contains information about corporate entities, including public interest audit clients and SEC-restricted clients and their related securities. CES assists in determining the independence status of clients of the firm before entering into a new non-audit engagement or business relationship. This system drives the ‘Independence List’ and also feeds Independence Checkpoint;\n\n●\n\nIndependence Checkpoint ​(“Checkpoint”) Facilitates the pre-clearance of publicly traded securities by all partners, directors and practise managers before acquisition and records their subsequent purchases and disposals. Where a member firm wins a new audit client, this system automatically informs those holding securities in that client of the requirement to sell the relevant securities where required;\n\n●\n\nAuthorisation for Services (“AFS”) system A global system that facilitates communication between a non-audit services engagement leader and the audit engagement leader, documenting the potential\n\n28 independence threats of the service and proposed safeguards, and acts as a record of the audit partner’s conclusion on the acceptability of providing the service. ●\n\nGlobal Breaches Reporting System Designed to be used to report any breaches of external auditor independence regulations (e.g. those set by regulation or professional requirements) where the breach has cross- border implications (e.g. where a breach occurs in one territory which affects an audit relationship in another territory).\n\nDisciplinary Policies and Mechanisms The firm has disciplinary policies and mechanisms in place that promote compliance with independence policies and processes, and that require any breaches of independence requirements to be reported and addressed. This would include: a. Discussion with the client’s audit committee regarding the nature of the breach, b. An evaluation of the impact of the breach on the independence of the firm and the need for safeguards to maintain objectivity. Although most breaches are minor and attributable to an oversight, all breaches are taken seriously and investigated as appropriate. The investigations of any identified breaches of independence policies also serve to identify the need for improvements in the firm’s systems and processes and for additional guidance and trainings. VII. Internal Quality Control System The firm’s detailed quality control procedures are set out in the PwC’s Audit Guide and in PwC Risk Management policies and guidance. The following summarizes the key policies, attitudes, behaviours and actions which ensures that they maintain a consistently high level of audit quality. Quality Control Standards The firm’s quality control system is in full compliance with the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (“IAASB”). The quality control system is embedded as part of the day to day activities. International Standard on Quality Control 1, issued by IAASB applies to all audit firms carrying out audits and reviews of historic financial information in accordance with\n\n29 International Standards on Auditing. This standard sets out the required elements of the quality control system which should operate in an audit firm. The requirements cover: ●\n\nLeadership responsibilities for quality within the firm\n\n●\n\nEthical Requirements (including independence)\n\n●\n\nAcceptance and continuance of client relationships and specific engagements\n\n●\n\nHuman Resources\n\n●\n\nEngagement Performance\n\n●\n\nMonitoring\n\nLeadership Responsibilities for Quality within the Firm The firm’s leadership is committed to taking all actions required to ensure that PwC continues to stand for quality, independence, objectivity and ethical behavior. The firm’s leadership regularly sends communications to partners that include an emphasis on the importance of \"standing firm on quality\". The same messages are contained in regular leadership communications to all staff members. Equally important is leadership's regular communications that alert the partners and staff about new standards and related guidance to assist them in providing high-quality service to their clients. Ethical requirements (including independence) PwC adheres to the fundamental principles of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, which are: 1. Integrity – To be straightforward and honest in all professional and business relationships. 2. Objectivity – To not allow bias, conflict of interest or undue influence of others to override professional or business judgments. 3. Professional Competence and Due Care – To maintain professional knowledge and skill at the level required to ensure that a client or employer receives competent professional service based on current developments in practice, legislation and techniques and act diligently and in accordance with applicable technical and professional standards. 4. Confidentiality – To respect the confidentiality of information acquired as a result of professional and business relationships and, therefore, not disclose any such information to third parties without proper and specific authority, unless there is a legal or\n\n30 professional right or duty to disclose, nor use the information for the personal advantage of the professional accountant or third parties. 5. Professional Behavior – To comply with relevant laws and regulations and avoid any action that discredits the profession. In addition, the Network Standards applicable to all Network firms cover a variety of areas including ethics and business conduct, independence, anti-money laundering, antitrust/anti-competition, anti corruption, information protection, firm’s and partner’s taxes, sanctions laws, internal audit and insider trading. PwC complies with these ethical requirements seriously and strive to embrace the spirit and not just the letter of those requirements. All partners and staff undertake regular mandatory training and assessments, as well as submitting annual compliance confirmations, as part of the system to support appropriate understanding of the ethical requirements under which we operate. Partners and staff uphold and comply with the standards developed by the PwC Network and PwC leadership monitors compliance with these obligations. The firm has adopted the PwC Network Standards which include a Code of Conduct, and related policies that describe the behaviors expected of its partners and other professionalsbehaviors that will enable us to earn the trust that we seek. Because of the wide variety of situations that the professionals may face, the standards provide guidance under a broad range of circumstances, but all with a common goal- to do the right thing.\n\nHuman Resources Human capital is critical to the firm’s success. They are committed to create an environment in which they are able to attract, develop, and retain the best and brightest in our profession, and have been recognized by several different organizations for our successes in this area. The people strategies—including how we recruit and deploy talent, develop skills, identify diverse professional experiences, and provide coaching and feedback—are important to achieving the firm’s quality objectives. Engagement Performance PwC believes that performing audits in accordance with professional standards is an important way that will fulfill their purpose to build trust in society and solve important problems.\n\n31 Before PwC issues its opinion, they conduct an audit following applicable auditing standards in order to obtain reasonable assurance regarding whether the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects. Although reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, it is not a guarantee. An audit involves examining the underlying audit evidence, including information and reports provided by the company, on a test basis. At the same time they test, rely and, for many public registrants, opine on a company’s internal control over financial reporting, which due to its inherent limitations may not prevent or detect misstatements.\n\nMonitoring of Assurance Quality ​One of the drivers of quality is the ability to identify opportunities for enhancement and quickly respond. PwC used pre-issuance reviews and\n\ninternal inspections to identify\n\nopportunities to enhance quality. After performing an analysis to identify what may have contributed to inspection comments, the firm develops appropriate actions, such as expanding guidance, developing new or enhanced tools, or implementing additional training. This includes effective monitoring processes aimed at evaluating whether the policies and procedures which constitute the firm’s Quality Management System are designed appropriately and operating effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the audit engagements are performed in compliance with laws, regulations and professional standards.\n\nAcceptance and continuance of client relationships and specific engagements PwC have developed various processes and software to help teams with the process of deciding whether to accept or continue with a client, or a specific engagement. They do not just take on every prospective client, and just because a client has been a client of the firm for many years does not mean that they will continue to remain one. Re-evaluation of client relationships is necessary to make sure that the clients continue to meet the criteria of a party with whom they want to do business. PwC considers resigning from any client where it is appropriate to do so. Acceptance and Continuance (“A&C”), which serves as the PwC Network’s proprietary decision support system for audit client acceptance and retention, involves in the determination by the engagement team, business management, industry experts and risk management professionals of whether the risks related to an existing client or a potential client are manageable, and whether\n\n32 or not the firm should be associated with the particular company, its management and shareholders. Among the issues that the firm considers during the course of the A&C process are: ●\n\nThe reputation of the company and its management\n\n●\n\nThe effectiveness of its Board\n\n●\n\nThe background and experience of the company’s financial reporting personnel\n\n●\n\nAny incentives or inclinations for management to manipulate reported result\n\n●\n\nAny significant transactions structured to achieve revenue recognition\n\n●\n\nAny unusually aggressive or creative accounting\n\n●\n\nAny transactions which are complex, unusual or difficult to evaluate\n\n●\n\nAny estimates that involve uncertainty or subjective judgments\n\n●\n\nAny transactions with related parties that are not part of the consolidated group\n\n●\n\nAny indications that the company might be in financial difficulty\n\n●\n\nThe expertise necessary to carry out a particular engagement\n\nA&C is a powerful enabler, but the real backbone of the firm’s client acceptance and continuance process is the significant time invested by the risk management and other senior partners. The risk management partners are senior partners with stature and independence who provide key input into the decision to accept or continue a client relationship. Upon acceptance or retention of the client, the results of these assessments are incorporated into the audit process, impacting for example the scope of work and assignment of resources. PwC declines to propose, accept, or retain work when the risks are considered not to be manageable, when the company involved will not agree on the scope of the work required or the fee arrangement is otherwise unacceptable. VIII​​. ​Ethics in Engagement Teams In order to provide professional services that do not compromise the organization’s values and the public’s interest, PwC engagement teams abide by their code of conduct. The organization also implements various policies to ensure adherence to ethical standards and addresses threats to the independence of engagement team members. PwC makes sure that employees are well-informed of the organization’s commitment to comply with ethical requirements through:\n\n33\n\n●\n\nBriefing of employees by the Human Capital Department on their first day of work to discuss about the organization’s core values and practices in compliance with ethical standards\n\n●\n\nDistribution of printed copies of policies and guidelines about code of ethics to all employees\n\n●\n\nA confirmation exam conducted annually to test if employees truly understand and comply with the requirements of the code of ethics and independence\n\nIntegrity A positive work environment where trust is present among co-workers is achieved by working with integrity. This involves being honest and truthful even if you stand alone in taking the right moral ground. PwC acknowledges the magnitude of this ethical requirement. Consequently, engagement team members who are caught violating such may receive a warning or face dismissal, depending on the gravity of the case. The Ethics Committee overlooks the implementation of the policies and procedures in relation to these rules. Objectivity Impartiality leads to an output that represents the real answer to an issue or the correct evaluation of a subject matter. A service that does not take sides is fair and just. This contributes to the value of the work being done and promotes the good reputation of the profession. Objectivity and independence are closely associated. Objectivity is jeopardized by factors that also threaten a firm or a team member’s independence, such as conflicts of interest. When conflicts of interest arise, as when engagement team members have close family relationships with employees of a potential or existing client entity, PwC reconsiders the acceptance or continuance of the client. When a member of the engagement team or the firm itself is conflicted, the firm generally does not accept the potential client or discontinue relations with an existing client. Professional competence and due care The performance of any service offered by PwC requires knowledge of the fundamental principles governing the service. Audit engagements demand proficiency and understanding of the GAAP, GAAS, the applicable accounting standards, and the audit process in general. Tax\n\n34 services, on the other hand, necessitate expertise in tax laws and regulations. Ethical requirements emphasizes a standard of competence that a professional should possess in order to provide an output that is of high quality and relevant to the task at hand. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) sees to it that its employees are equipped with appropriate know-how of their work. At entry point, the firm only hires applicants with a CPA license, which is considered as the accounting profession’s highest standard of competence and an assurance of quality, and licensure exam passers who are also graduates with honors, topnotchers, and student leaders. Also, engagement team members undergo rigid training and seminars before the commencement of every engagement. For example, engagement team members assigned to a cooperative client are mandatorily required to join a three-day seminar conducted by the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA). A quality service entails an output that is free from material error. PwC provides quality work by reviewing work done by engagement team members and implementing the practice of coaching. Seniors are assigned as coaches to specific associates and inexperienced team members. Also, the seniors review the output of the associates. Meanwhile, managers review the output of the seniors. Confidentiality Failure to properly secure and protect confidential business information can lead to the loss of business or clients. In the wrong hands, confidential information can be misused to commit illegal activity, which can result in lawsuits for the employer. Confidentiality in the engagement team members of PwC is upheld through e-Learning and written confirmations. Constant reminder of the policies and procedures is another method of confirming that this moral obligation is observed. Professional Behavior Acting like a professional includes doing what it takes to make others think of you as reliable, respectful, and competent. This is especially important in the auditing discipline since behaving unprofessionally could tarnish one’s reputation, which will then take a long time to rebuild. Similar to what has been mentioned, regular training, exams, and reminders ensure that professional behavior is observed within the engagement team level.\n\n35\n\nIndependence The auditor should be independent from the client company so that the audit opinion will not be influenced by any relationship between them. The auditors are expected to give an unbiased and honest professional opinion on the financial statements to the shareholders. Before engaging in any field or client work, an independence questionnaire – usually in the form of an online checklist, is answered by the engagement team members in PwC. Through this, investments, close family relationships, and other possible threats to independence could be addressed. If it is discovered that a member has not answered said questionnaire, an email will be sent to that particular member as a reminder that such questionnaire is mandatory. Rotation is also observed to mitigate threats to independence. IX.​​\n\n​Developed technology PwC continues to invest in audit technology that builds quality into the audit and enhances their ability to provide insights to their clients. The technology is built and implemented globally ensuring consistency across the PwC Network.These new tools that enhance audit quality and efficiency through automation, connectivity and mobility include: ●\n\nAura Now is an online, multi-engagement dashboard tool that allows teams to monitor progress towards completion and other key information across their portfolio of Aura engagement databases. It visualizes the progress of an engagement, which enables our people to prioritize their efforts. It also provides information regarding readiness for file archiving to assist in preparing for and timing of archiving the audit file.\n\n●\n\n​Count ​is an electronic portal that allows teams to create instructions for the teams to execute and document all aspects of an inventory count observation electronically. It was built by PwC in response to feedback from teams that using a mobile device would improve the quality and execution of inventory counts.\n\n●\n\nConnect is the firm’s collaborative workflow tool, providing fast, efficient and secure information sharing at every stage of the audit. It monitors the status of requests and information between our clients and the engagement team on a real time\n\n36 basis. Connect provides visibility for both the clients and the firm to be able check progress on the go, anytime, anywhere. ●\n\nHalo ​is the firm’s new data auditing suite of tools allowing them to identify and assess risks and determine where to focus audit efforts. The analytical and visualization capabilities allow them to analyses patterns and trends, identifying unusual and high-risk transactions, and providing invaluable insight to both the firm and the clients. Halo comprises of three key components – acquisition of client data, transformation of data and applications for automated testing and analysis of data, for example, Halo for Journals allows engagement teams to gather all journal entries and utilize built-in functionality to apply engagement specific criteria designed to focus testing on higher risk entries.\n\n37 References: Interviews Cao, Allan (2018, March 14&16).
