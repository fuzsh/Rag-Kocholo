        "text": "The traditional cost-cutting imperatives of Supply Chain Management (SCM) consulting services have changed, driven by a host of new client demands and market influences. Where SCM consulting engagements were historically driven by expense mitigation and process controls, SCM advisory work is now prefaced on strategic value and competitive advantage, according to consulting market research firm Kennedy Information.\n\n\"The overall complexity of today's supply chain has created myriad issues that, until recently, have not been the purview of traditional Supply Chain consulting practices,\" says Tom Rodenhauser, Vice President of Consulting Research for Kennedy. \"Supply Chain consultants were typically called in to create the most efficient path between suppliers, producers, distributors and customers. Today, a company's supply chain is at the direct intersection of such disparate business imperatives as globalization, risk management and sustainability. So we see SCM firms doing fascinating work in the areas of tax management, risk mitigation, and the 'green' supply chain.\"\n\nKennedy's new research, Supply Chain Consulting Marketplace, finds that as globalizing companies look to support rapid expansion, their relationship management efforts with suppliers can become a point of competitive advantage. Rather than viewing the Supply Chain as a cost that must be optimized, consultants are helping companies exploit SCM though such initiatives as asset virtualization. As a result, consulting engagements along the Supply Chain now integrate a wide spectrum of historically unrelated advisory services.\n\nSupply Chain Consulting Marketplace defines, analyzes, and forecasts the state of these consulting services in demand through 2011. Kennedy's newest research in this expanding service area uncovers the relative positions of leading Supply Chain Management consulting providers, and profiles notable practices with detailed capabilities assessments.\n\nThe Supply Chain Management consulting practices profiled in this research include: Accenture, A.T. Kearney, Bain & Company, BearingPoint, Booz Allen Hamilton, The Boston Consulting Group, Capgemini, Computer Sciences Corporation, Deloitte, IBM, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PA Consulting, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and PRTM.\n\nAbout Kennedy Information\n\nSince 1970, Kennedy Information has been the world's leading source of market analysis on the Management Consulting and IT Consulting industries. Kennedy provides accurate and reliable market sizing and forecasts for consulting services world-wide, needs-analysis and vendor profiling for buyers of consulting services, timely and insightful intelligence on the top consulting firms in their respective markets, and operational benchmarks that measure consulting performance.
