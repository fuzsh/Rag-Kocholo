        "text": "Four years ago it was almost unheard of for a Big 4 firm to engage in M&A with the exception of the post Enron period when each (except Deloitte) sold their consulting business. Not only have each of the Big 4 re-focused efforts on consulting (as opposed to accounting), but they are employing M&A as a critical component of their growth strategy.\n\nMost notable are the larger acquisitions completed by PWC for Diamond Technology Group and more recently PRTM. Not to be outdone, Deloitte has also completed a number of consulting acquisitions over the past couple of years. These firms, who are typically regarded as highly conservative and bureaucratic, have become aggressive and agile in the M&A market. Each of these firms continue to operate as a private partnership, but they have instituted processes and policies to enable them to in many cases pay premium values for consulting assets."
