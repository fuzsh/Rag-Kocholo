        "text": "671\n\nPITTIGLIO RABIN TODD &amp; MCGRATH\n\n(PRTM—A LEADING OPERATIONS\n\nCONSULTING COMPANY\n\nGood business strategy plots changes in where a company is going. A winning opera- tional strategy translates that direction into operational reality, creating strategic com- petitive advantage in the process. PRTM is a leading company specializing in finding ways to structure business operations to create breakout results in top-line growth, earnings, and valuation. Today’s operational CEOs realize that brilliant business strategies and operational strategies are interconnected. Business strategies drive the need for new operational capabilities, and evolving operational capabilities shape the future business strategies. PRTM Consultants focus on the following six essential ingredients of operational strategy:\n\nTransform market forces into operational advantage. This is the kind of insight that Black &amp; Decker used to turn a regulatory requirement for double- insulated power tools into a new modular product platform that redefined cost and performance in category after category. The same type of insight helped Progressive Insurance transform automobile claims from an unproductive part of its cost structure into a far more economical and valued source of competitive advantage.\n\nDo one thing extraordinarily well. Consider the case of Apple iTunes. Its gigantic share of the digital music player market is fueled by Apple’s relentless pursuit of ease of use as a basis of competition. Companies like Walmart are all about cost leadership, attaining the lowest end-to-end operational cost, and the highest productivity.\n\nThink end-to-end, continuous, real time, and horizontally. Every organization has a set of core operational domains that make up its\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nLO 25–1 Explain operations consulting and how money is made in the industry.\n\nLO 25–2 Illustrate the operations analysis tools used in the consulting industry.\n\nLO 25–3 Analyze processes using business process reengineering concepts.\n\nOperations\n\nConsulting 25\n\n672\n\nWHAT IS OPERATIONS CONSULTING?\n\noperational model. For most, these comprise some combination of the product development chain, the supply chain, and the customer chain. Operational strategy configures these operational domains to deliver against business strategy, and create advantage in their own right.\n\nThink and execute globally. Due to global markets for products and the global availability of supply, many companies need to consider strategies that best position the firm to compete in this domain. Global opportunities are often the key driver to changes to both business and operational strategies.\n\nDrive innovation in your operations and business model. Peter Drucker defined innovation as change that creates a new dimension of performance. He also stated that a key accountability of the CEO is innovation. Too often, innovation is perceived to be a technical or product-oriented activity. The reality is that operational innovation is creating the commanding leaders today.\n\nExecute relentlessly. A complete operational strategy requires a commitment to execution. Companies with commanding leads in their markets execute relentlessly, informed by their global marketplace insight, and are aligned to a singular competitive focus, emboldened by a clear innovation intent, and guided by a sound operational model aligned with business strategy and business economics.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, companies that make all aspects of their operations a source of strategic innovation will dominate their markets, delivering unparalleled rev- enue growth, earnings performance, and shareholder return.\n\nOperations consulting has become one of the major areas of employment for business school graduates. The page cited from the PRTM Website nicely summarizes the importance of operations on bottom-line performance. In this chapter, we discuss how one goes about consulting for operations, as well as the nature of the consulting business in general. We also survey the tools and techniques used in operations consulting and provide an overview of busi- ness process reengineering because much OSCM consulting entails this activity.\n\nOperations consulting deals with assisting clients in developing operations strategies and improving production processes. In strategy development, the focus is on analyzing the capabili- ties of operations in light of the firm’s competitive strategy. It has been suggested that market leadership can be attained in one of three ways: through product leadership, through operational excellence, or through customer intimacy. Each of these strategies may well call for different operations capabilities and focus. The operations consultant must be able to assist management in understanding these differences and be able to define the most effective combination of tech- nology and systems to execute the strategy. In process improvement, the focus is on employing analytical tools and methods to help operating managers enhance performance of their depart- ments. Deloitte &amp; Touche Consulting lists the actions to improve processes as follows: refine/\n\nExplain operations consulting and how money is made in the industry.\n\nLO 25–\n\nOperations consulting Assisting clients in developing operations strategies and improving production processes.\n\nSource: Adapted from a statement by Tom Godward and Mark Deck, partners in PRTM’s Worldwide Operational Strategy Practice, prtm.\n\n674 Section 5 Special Topics\n\nnumerical example of how profitability is calculated for a hypothetical consulting firm, Guru Associates.) Because most consulting firms are engaged in multiple projects simul- taneously, the percentage of billable employee hours assigned to all projects (target utiliza- tion) will be less than 100 percent. A practice that specializes in cutting-edge, high-client risk (brain surgery) work must be staffed with a high partner-to-junior ratio because lower- level people will not be able to deliver the quality of services required. In contrast, practices that deal with more procedural, low-risk work will be inefficient if they do not have a lower ratio of partners to juniors because high-priced staff should not be doing low-value tasks. The most common method for improving efficiency is the use of uniform approaches to each aspect of a consulting job. Accenture, the company most famous for this approach, sends its new consultants through a boot camp at its St. Charles, Illinois, training facility. At this boot camp, it provides highly refined, standardized methods for such common operations work as systems design, process reengineering, and continuous improvement, and for the project management and reporting procedures by which such work is carried out. Of course, other large consulting firms have their own training methods and step-by-step procedures for selling, designing, and executing consulting projects.\n\n####### When Operations Consulting Is Needed\n\nThe following are some of the major strategic and tactical areas where companies typically seek operations consulting. Looking first at manufacturing consulting areas (grouped under what could be called the 5 Ps of production), we have\n\n∙ Plant: Adding and locating new plants; expanding, contracting, or refocusing existing facilities. ∙ People: Quality improvement, setting/revising work standards, learning curve analysis. ∙ Parts: Make or buy decisions, vendor selection decisions. ∙ Processes: Technology evaluation, process improvement, reengineering. ∙ Planning and control systems: Supply chain management, ERP, MRP, shop-floor con- trol, warehousing, distribution.\n\nObviously, many of these issues are interrelated, calling for systemwide solutions. Exam- ples of common themes reflecting this are developing manufacturing strategy; designing and implementing JIT systems; implementing MRP or proprietary ERP software such as SAP; and systems integration involving client–server technology. Typical questions addressed are:\n\nLevel No.\n\nTarget Utilization\n\nTarget Billable Hours @ 2, Hours per Person per Year\n\nBilling Rate Fees\n\nSalary per Individual\n\nTotal Salaries Partner (senior) 4 75% 6,000 $400 $2,400,000 (see calculations below) Middle 8 75% 12,000 $200 $2,400,000 $150,000 $1,200, Junior 20 90% 36,000 $100 $3,600,000 $ 64,000 $1,280, Totals $8,400,000 $2,480, Fees $8,400, Salaries (2,480,000) Contributions $5,920, Overhead* $2,560, Partner profits $3,360, Per partner $ 840,\n\n*Assume overhead costs of $80,000 per professional.\n\nexhibit 25 The Economics of Guru Associates\n\nOperations Consulting Chapter 25 675\n\nHow can the client cut lead times? How can inventory be reduced? How can better control be maintained over the shop floor? Among the hot areas of manufacturing strategy consult- ing are sustainability, outsourcing, supply chain management, and global manufacturing net- works. At the tactical level, there is a huge market for consulting in e-operations, product development, ISO 9000 quality certification, and design and implementation of decentralized production control systems. Turning to services, while consulting firms in manufacturing may have broad specialties in process industries on the one hand and assembly or discrete product manufacture on the other, service operations consulting typically has a strong industry or sector focus. A common consulting portfolio of specialties in services (and areas of consulting need) would include the following:\n\nFinancial services (staffing, automation, quality studies) Health care (staffing, billing, office procedures, phone answering, layout) Transportation (route scheduling and shipping logistics for goods haulers, reservation sys- tems, and baggage handling for airlines) Hospitality (reservations, staffing, cost containment, quality programs)\n\nFor both manufacturing and service industries, the current hot area for consultants, as well as in-house teams, is Lean Six Sigma. The reason is companies have reached their limit on how much can be done by downsizing and are thus focusing on rigorously measuring and per- fecting various processes. Pharmaceutical companies, large retailers, and food companies are examples of industries with heavy demand for consultants who specialize in such programs.\n\nWhen Are Operations Consultants Needed? Companies typically seek out operations consultants when they are faced with major investment decisions or when they believe they are not getting maximum effectiveness from their productive capacity. As an example of the first type of situation, consider the following:\n\nA national pie restaurant chain retained consultants to determine if a major addi- tion to its freezer storage capacity was needed at its pie-making plant. Its lease had run out on a nearby freezer warehouse, so the firm had to make a decision rather quickly. The pie plant manager wanted to spend $500,000 for a capacity increase. After analysis of the demand for various types of pies, the distribution system, and the contractual arrangement with the shipper, the consultant con- cluded that management could avoid all but a $30,000 investment in capacity if they did the following: Run a mixed-model production schedule for pies accord- ing to a forecast for each of 10 kinds of pies (for example, 20 percent strawberry, 30 percent cherry, 30 percent apple, and 20 percent other pies each two-day pie production cycle). To do this, more timely information about pie demand at each of the chain restaurants had to be obtained. This in turn required that information links for pie requirements go directly to the factory. Previously the distributor bought the pies and resold them to the restaurants. Finally, the company rene- gotiated pickup times from the pie plant to enable just-in-time delivery at the restaurants. The company was in a much stronger bargaining situation than it had been five years previously, and the distributor was willing to make reasonable adjustments.\n\nThe lesson from this is that few investment decisions in operations are all or nothing, and good solutions can be obtained by simply applying standard OSCM concepts of produc- tion planning, forecasting, and scheduling. The solution recognized that the problem must be viewed at a systemwide level to see how better planning and distribution could substitute for brick-and-mortar capacity.\n\nOperations Consulting Chapter 25 677\n\nProblem Definition\n\nData Analysis and Solution Development\n\nCost Impact and Payoff Analysis\n\nData Gathering\n\nImplementation\n\nProblem analysis (SPC tools) Bottleneck analysis Computer simulation Statistical tools\n\nDecision trees Balanced scorecard Stakeholder analysis\n\nResponsibility charts Project management techniques\n\nPlant tours/audits Work sampling Flowcharts Organization charts\n\nIssue trees Customer surveys Gap analysis Employee surveys Five forces model\n\nexhibit 25 Operations Consulting Tool Kit\n\n∙ Don’t accept “I have no idea.” Clients and their staff always know something, so probe them for some educated guesses. ∙ Engage the client in the process. If the client doesn’t support you, the project will stall. Keep your clients engaged by keeping them involved. ∙ Get buy-in throughout the organization. If your solution is to have lasting impact on your client, you have to get support for it throughout the organization. ∙ Be rigorous about implementation. Making change happen takes a lot of work. Be rigorous and thorough. Make sure someone takes responsibility for getting the job done.\n\n####### Operations Consulting Tool Kit\n\nOperations consulting tools can be categorized as tools for problem definition, data gath- ering, data analysis and solution development, cost impact and payoff analysis, and implementation. These—along with some tools from strategic management, market- ing, and information systems that are commonly used in OSCM consulting—are noted in Exhibit 25 and are described next. Note that several of these tools are used in more than one stage of a project.\n\n####### Problem Definition Tools\n\nIssue Trees Issue trees are used by McKinsey to structure or map the key problems to be investigated and provide a working initial hypothesis as to the likely solution to these problems. As can be seen in Exhibit 25, a tree starts with the general problem (increase\n\n678 Section 5 Special Topics\n\nE. M. Rasiel, The McKinsey Way: Using the Techniques of the World’s Top Strategic Consultants to Help You and Your Business, (New York, McGraw-Hill, 1998), p. 12. Used with permission.\n\nSales force organization\n\nSales force skill base\n\nPromotion strategy\n\nProduct quality\n\nPackaging\n\nConsumer advertising strategy\n\nRaw materials sourcing\n\nProduction process\n\nDistribution system\n\nIncrease widget sales\n\nChange sales strategy\n\nImprove marketing strategy\n\nReduce unit cost\n\nwidget sales) and then goes level by level until potential sources of the problem are identified. Once the tree is laid out, the relationships it proposes and possible solutions are debated, and the project plan is then specified.\n\nCustomer Surveys Frequently, OSCM consultants are called in to address problems identified by customer surveys performed by marketing consultants or marketing staff. Often, however, these are out of date or are in a form that does not separate process issues from advertising or other marketing concerns. Even if the surveys are in good form, calling customers and soliciting their experience with the company is a good way to get a feel for process performance. A key use of customer surveys is customer loyalty analysis, although in reality customers are not so much “loyal” (your dog, Spot, is loyal) as “earned” through effective performance. Nevertheless, the term loyalty captures the flavor of how well an organization is performing according to three critical market measures: customer retention, share of wallet, and price sensitivity relative to competitors. Having such information available helps the OSCM consultant drill down into the organization to find what operational factors are directly linked to customer retention. Although loyalty studies are usually performed by marketing groups, OSCM consultants should be aware of their importance.\n\nGap Analysis Gap analysis is used to assess the client’s performance relative to the expectations of its customers, or relative to the performance of its competitors. An example is shown in Exhibit 25.\n\nexhibit 25 Issue Tree for Acme Widgets\n\n680 Section 5 Special Topics\n\nweeks, utilizing checklists developed explicitly for the client’s industry. Plant tours, on the other hand, are usually much less detailed and can be done in a half day. The purpose of the tour is to get a general understanding of the manufacturing process before focusing on a particular problem area. To collect consistent information, the members of the study team in a tour use the same generic checklist or general questions. The quick plant assessment (QPA) tour is designed to enable a study team to determine the “leanness” of a plant in just 45 minutes. The approach uses a 20-item questionnaire and an 9-category item rating sheet (see “Quick Plant Assessment” Exercise at the end of the chapter). During the tour, team members talk with workers and managers and look for evi- dence of best practices. At the end of the tour, members discuss their impressions and fill out the worksheets. The categories are key to the tour. Their features are summarized in the nearby OSCM at Work box, “Quick Plant Assessment.” Complete service facility audits are also a major undertaking, but they differ from manu- facturing audits in that, when properly done, they focus on the customer’s experience as much as on the utilization of resources. Typical questions in a service audit address time to get ser- vice, the cleanliness of the facility, staff sizing, and customer satisfaction. A service facility tour or walk-through can often be done as a mystery shopper, where the consultant actually partakes of the service and records his or her experiences.\n\nUpstream value activities Downstream value activities\n\nInbound logistics\n\nOutbound logistics\n\nMarketing Operations and sales Service Margin\n\nMargin\n\nFirm infrastructure\n\nHuman resource management\n\nTechnology development\n\nProcurement\n\nSupport activities\n\nexhibit 25 Value Chain\n\n####### Quick Plant Assessment\n\nCustomer focus. A customer-oriented workforce will take pride in satisfying both external and internal cus- tomers. The extent of this orientation should be appar- ent even in a brief plant tour. For example, when asked about the next step in the process, customer-aware employees will respond by giving a person’s name or product, rather than saying that they just put it on the pallet and it’s moved later. Cordiality to the touring group and posted quality and customer satisfaction\n\nOSCM AT WORK\n\nratings are other signs of a customer-oriented work- force. (Questions 1, 2, and 20 on the QPA questionnaire relate to this measure. This questionnaire is included at the end of this chapter.) 2. Safety, cleanliness, and order. The physical environ- ment of a plant is important to operating effective- ness. Cleanliness, low noise levels, good lighting, and air quality are obvious things to look for. Labeling and tracking of all inventory items, not just expensive ones, should be in evidence. (Not having the required nuts\n\nBased on Harvard Business School Press. From M. E. Porter, Competition in Global Industries, (Boston,MA, 1986), p. 24.\n\nOperations Consulting Chapter 25 681\n\nand bolts can be as disruptive to production as lacking a major component.) (Questions 3–5 and 20) 3. Visual management/Scheduling. Production manage- ment tools such as work instructions, kanban sched- ules, and quality and productivity charts should be easily visible. Posted workflow diagrams linking each stage of a process are particularly effective visual cues. In addition, scheduling typically involves some mecha- nism for pacing of the workflow based on demand. (Questions 2, 4, 6–10, 11, and 20) 4. Use of space, movement efficiency, and product line flow. Good indicators of efficient space utilization are minimum material movement over short distances, use of efficient containers; materials stored at the point of use, not in separate inventory storage areas; tooling kept near the machines; and product flow layout rather than process layout. (Questions 7, 12, 13, and 20) 5. Teamwork. Discussions with workers and visible indica- tors of teamwork such as names of teams over a work area and productivity award banners are quick ways of determining how the workforce feels about their jobs, the company, and their co-workers. (Questions 9, 14, 15, and 20) 6. Maintenance of equipment. Purchase dates and equipment costs should be stenciled on the side of machinery, and maintenance records should be posted nearby. Asking people on the factory floor how things are working and whether they are involved in purchas- ing tools and equipment is also indicative of the extent to which workers are encouraged to address these issues. (Questions 16 and 20)\n\nManagement of complexity and variability. This depends greatly on the type of industry. Obviously, industries with narrow product lines have less diffi- culty handling complexity and variability. Indicators to watch for in general are the number of people manually recording data and the number of keyboards available for data entry. (Questions 8, 17, and 20)\n\nSupply chain integration. It is generally desirable to work closely with a relatively small number of dedi- cated and supportive suppliers. A rough estimate of the number of suppliers can be ascertained by looking at container labels to see what supplier names appear on containers. Containers that appear to be designed and labeled specifically for customized parts shipped to a plant indicate the extent to which a strong supplier partnership exists. A sign of poor supply chain integra- tion is lots of paperwork on the receiving dock. This indicates lack of a smooth pull system where plants pull the materials from their suppliers as if it was just another link in the pull system for each product line. (Questions 18 and 20)\n\nQuality commitment. Attention to quality is evidenced in many ways, including posting of quality awards, qual- ity scorecards, and quality goal statements. Quality is reflected in many of the other plant activities such as product development and startups. (Questions 8, 9, 15, 17, 19, and 20)\n\nModified from R. Eugene Goodson, “Read a Plant—Fast,” Harvard Business Review 80, no. 5 (May 2002), pp. 105–13.\n\nMANUFACTURING PROFESSIONALS TAKE A TOUR OF THE LINCOLN ELECTRIC MACHINE DIVISION OF THE CLEVELAND HEADQUARTERS AND FACTORY, WHERE THEY SEE THE LINCOLN MANUFACTURING PLAN IN ACTION ON THE PLANT FLOOR.

The rein- forcing loop (R) indicates that the standard, if left unmodified, would yield an ever-increasing (or decreasing) level of actual quality. In reality, what happens is that the balancing loop (B) comes into play. Effective time required to meet the standard determines time pressure (on the workers), which, in turn, modifies the actual quality achieved and ultimately achievement of the quality standard itself. An obvious use of the system shown here would be to hypothesize the consequences of raising the quality goal, or raising or lowering the values of the other variables in the system. In addition to its use in problem analysis, causal loop analysis simula- tions are often used by consultants to help client companies become more effective learning organizations.\n\nStatistical Tools Correlation analysis and regression analysis are expected skills for consulting in OSCM. The good news is that these types of analyses are easily performed with spreadsheets. Hypothesis testing is mentioned frequently in the consulting firm methodology manuals, and one should certainly be able to perform Chi-square and t-tests in analyzing data. Two other widely used tools that use statistical analysis are queuing theory and forecasting. Consultants frequently use queuing theory to investigate how many service channels are needed to handle customers in person or on the phone. Forecasting problems likewise arise continually in OSCM consulting (such as forecasting the incoming calls to a call center). A newly emerging tool (not shown on our exhibit) is data envelopment analysis. DEA is a linear programming technique used to measure the relative performance of branches of multisite service organizations such as banks, franchise outlets, and public agencies. A DEA model compares each branch with all other branches and computes an efficiency rating based on the ratio of resource inputs to product or service outputs. The key feature of the approach is that it permits using multiple inputs such as materials and labor hours, and multiple outputs such as products sold and repeat customers, to get an efficiency ratio. This feature provides a more comprehensive and reliable measure of efficiency than a set of operating ratios or profit measures.\n\n####### Cost Impact and Payoff Analysis\n\nDecision Trees Decision trees represent a fundamental tool from the broad area of risk analysis. They are widely used in examining plant and equipment investments and R&amp;D projects. Decision trees are built into various software packages such as TreeAge (www. treeage).\n\nStakeholder Analysis Most consulting projects impact in some way each of five types of stakeholders: customers, stockholders, employees, suppliers, and the community. The importance of considering the interest of all stakeholders is reflected in the mission statements of virtually all major corporations and, as such, provides guidance for consultants in formulating their recommendations.\n\nQuality standard\n\nQuality goal\n\nTime pressure\n\nActual quality\n\nEffective time required\n\nB\n\nR\n\nR - Reinforcing loop B - Balancing loop\n\nexhibit 25 Causal Loop Analysis\n\n684 Section 5 Special Topics\n\nBalanced Scorecard In an attempt to reflect the particular needs of each stakeholder group in a performance measurement system, accountants have developed what is termed a balanced scorecard. (Balanced refers to the fact that the scorecard looks at more than just the bottom line or one or two other performance measures.) The Bank of Montreal has used the balanced scorecard notion in setting specific goals and measures for customer service, employee relations, return to owners, and community relations. A key feature of the system is that it is tailored to what senior management and branch-level management can control.\n\nProcess Dashboards In contrast to the balanced scorecard, which focuses on organizationwide performance data, process dashboards are designed to provide summary performance updates for specific processes. Dashboards consist of a selection of performance metrics presented in graphical form with color-coding of trend lines, alarms in the form of exclamation marks, and so forth, to show when key indicators are nearing a problem level. For example, three different dials on a dashboard for suppliers are shown in Exhibit 25.\n\n####### Implementation\n\nResponsibility Charts A responsibility chart is used in planning the task responsibilities for a project. It usually takes the form of a matrix with tasks listed across the top and project team members down the side. The goal is to make sure that a checkmark exists in each cell to assure that a person is assigned to each task.\n\nProject Management Techniques Consulting firms use the project management techniques of CPM/PERT and Gantt charts to plan and monitor the entire portfolio of consulting engagements of the firm, as well as individual consulting projects. Microsoft Project and Primavera Project Planner are examples of commonly used software to automate such tools. Evolve Software has developed a software suite for professional service firms, modeled on ERP for manufacturing, that allows management to integrate opportunity management (the selling process), resource management, and delivery management. It should be emphasized that these planning tools are very much secondary to the people management skills needed to successfully execute a consulting project. This admonition is likewise true for all of the tools we have discussed in this section.\n\nBUSINESS PROCESS REENGINEERING (BPR\n\n0\n\nAccessories\n\nE-Link Source\n\nMotion\n\n10 Sights\n\n20\n\n30 40506070 80 90 100 1100\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n4050 6070 80 90 100 110 1200\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150 200 250 300 350\n\nAccessories\n\nE-Link Source\n\nMotion\n\nSights\n\nAccessories\n\nE-Link\n\nSource\n\nMotion\n\nSights\n\nDelivery Days [SupplierType]\n\nDelivered Qty (×100,000) [SupplierType]\n\nDamaged Qty (×10) [SupplierType]\n\nexhibit 25 Dashboard for Suppliers\n\nBusiness process reengineering is the radically restructuring of business processes to signifi- cantly improve customer service, reduce cost, and become competitive. It uses many of the tools just discussed to achieve these goals. The concept of reengineering has been around for nearly two decades and was imple- mented in a piecemeal fashion in organizations. Production organizations have been in the vanguard without knowing it. They have undertaken reengineering by implementing concur- rent engineering, lean production, cellular manufacturing, group technology, and pull-type production systems. These represent a fundamental rethinking of the manufacturing process.\n\nAnalyze processes using business process reengineering concepts.\n\nLO 25–\n\n686 Section 5 Special Topics\n\nRule 5. Link Parallel Activities Instead of Integrating Their Results The concept of integrating only the outcomes of parallel activities that must eventually come together is the primary cause for rework, high costs, and delays in the final outcome of the overall process. Such parallel activities should be linked continually and coordinated during the process.\n\nRule 6. Put the Decision Point Where the Work Is Performed, and Build Control into the Process Decision making should be made part of the work performed. This is possible today with a more educated and knowledgeable workforce plus decision-aiding technology. Controls are now made part of the process. The vertical compression that results produces flatter, more responsive organizations.\n\nRule 7. Capture Information Once—at the Source Information should be collected and captured in the company’s online information system only once—at the source where it was created. This approach avoids erroneous data entries and costly reentries.\n\n####### Guidelines for Implementation\n\nThe principles of business process reengineering just enumerated are based on a common platform of the innovative use of information technology. But creating a new process and sus- taining the improvement requires more than a creative application of information technology. A detailed study of reengineering applications in 765 hospitals yielded the following three managerial guidelines that apply to almost every organization contemplating reengineering: 1. Codification of reengineering. Organizationwide change programs such as reengi- neering are complex processes whose implementation may be separated by space and time. Middle managers are often left to implement significant portions of reengineer- ing proposals. Codifying provides guidance and direction for consistent, efficient implementation. 2. Clear goals and consistent feedback. Goals and expectations must be clearly estab- lished, preapplication baseline data gathered, and the results monitored and fed back to employees. Without clear feedback, employees often became dissatisfied and their perceptions of reengineering success can be quite different from actual outcomes.\n\nTHE BRITISH RETAILER MARKS &amp; SPENCER HAS GONE THROUGH COMPANY REENGINEERING, PRODUCING PLAN A, A 100-POINT ECO-PLAN. IT IS REDUCING HOW MUCH OF ITS CLOTHING AND PACKAGING ENDS UP AS LANDFILL BY IMPROVING PACKAGING, RECYCLING MORE, AND USING FEWER PLASTIC BAGS. © Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nFor example, the hospital researchers found that, at 10 hospitals they stud- ied in depth, most employees in 4 of them felt that the reengineering pro- gram had done little to change costs, even though their costs had actually dropped 2 to 12 percent relative to their competitors’. On the other hand, 4 hospitals in which most felt that reengineering had lowered costs actually experienced an increase in relative costs and a deterioration of their cost position. 3. High executive involvement in process changes. A high level of involvement by the chief executive officer in major process changes (procedure changes in hospitals, for example) improves reengineer- ing outcomes. Changes that require reductions of managers and employ- ees are certainly less popular and more difficult. It is better that these be done using a more long-term plan.\n\nOperations Consulting Chapter 25 687\n\nConcept Connections\n\n####### LO 25–1 Explain operations consulting and how money is made in the industry.\n\n####### Summary\n\n∙ Consulting firms specializing in operations and sup- ply chain management focus on improving a firm’s competitiveness by improving processes. ∙ These firms can bring expertise that the client firm does not have. The consultant can do specialized anal- ysis, such as simulation and optimization.\n\n∙ A consulting firm makes money by charging for ser- vices, typically based on a set of rates that depend on the relative experience of the consultant. The most experienced consultants run the projects and are billed at the highest rates.
