        "text": "The management consulting industry has been adapting to a rapidly shrinking world, with clients routinely requiring global consulting teams to help solve some of their most challenging operational issues. PRTM has responded to this challenge in part through its implementation of the NetSuite OpenAir solution to manage its global projects. With over 600 professionals serving global organizations from its 19 offices worldwide, PRTM manages and operates its business as a global whole rather than individual country operating units, however, the volume of globally driven projects is at unprecedented levels. Implementing the NetSuite OpenAir solution has enabled PRTM to commit to a greater number of large multi-national clients and efficiently allocate resources on a global basis.\n\nThe Challenge: For over 35 years, PRTM has been serving an expanding slate of customers drawn mainly from the Global 1000 in industry sectors ranging from automotive, industrial and aerospace, life sciences, telecommunications, consumer packaged goods, energy and public sector. By 2007, PRTM recognized that new challenges were coming with the global economy. That meant finding better ways to manage over 600 consultants and deliver consulting services in 36 countries, with one global management team and governance structure and a single view of global resources. When the company relied on a more regionalized project management system and spreadsheets for rolling up a global project view and resource management it was enough to keep bench time at a minimum."
