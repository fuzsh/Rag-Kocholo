Our consultants are incredibly talented individuals, so being a values-based, great-culture firm is critical for us to deliver in the marketplace. Our clients demand the best and the brightest and, as such, being a great firm to work for is critical and core to PRTM's overall business strategy,\" Hefter says. \"So when that's reflected in PRTM's being recognized as a Best Firm to Work For, we all feel a strong sense of pride.\"\n\nOne of the keys to the firm's recent resurgence, Hefter says, is decision made during the downturn. While the economy weakened, PRTM made investments in strengthening its team, not the least of which was hiring top talent, integrating new members into the global team, training and developing at all levels, he says.\n\n\"It would be difficult to say which of these investments have had the greatest impact, but we're confident all played a role in supporting, encouraging, and strengthening the global PRTM team,\" Hefter says. \"The pervasive feeling within our global team is one of excitement and energy, as our client engagements provide the type of opportunity that allows everyone to make a difference.\""
