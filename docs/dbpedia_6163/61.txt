History

The firm was founded in 1976 in Palo Alto, California. When the firm added eastern United States operations in 1977, it was incorporated as Pittiglio, Rabin, Todd & McGrath after its founding partners Theodore Pittiglio, Robert Rabin, Robert Todd, and Michael McGrath. Today, the firm is known as PRTM.

The firm began benchmarking business performance for its clients in 1982. PRTM’s international expansion started in 1985. In 1988, PRTM pioneered its "Product And Cycle-time Excellence" (PACE©) framework to provide companies with a multi-disciplinary approach to innovation. PRTM co-developed the "Supply-Chain Operations Reference-model" (SCOR) with the Supply-Chain Council in 1996. In 1997, the firm launched a subsidiary, The Performance Measurement Group, LLC (PMG). Rabin and McGrath were the last of the original founders to retire, in 2002 and 2004, respectively. The firm's four managing directors are

*Scott Hefter, Global Managing Director
