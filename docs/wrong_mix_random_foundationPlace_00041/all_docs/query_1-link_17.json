        "text": "California’s Anti-Chinese Workingmen’s Party was founded in San Francisco in 1877, resulting in the national Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Bigots did everything they could to make it hard for Chinese to make a living in America. Yet out of their meager wages, Chinese workers often sent back money to help their loved ones in China. Inequality was the status quo until Japan’s Warlord regime began brutally seizing parts of China in the 1930s. Once American sympathy was aroused, people began to understand the humanity of their Chinese neighbors, as well as their fears.\n\nTo eat a pebble\n\nGeorge was born 1919 to an impoverished farm family in the village of Toisan, China. He recalled once being so hungry, he ate some pebbles off the ground. At age 5, George was adopted by the wealthy Lam Pon, whose wife was a California-born Chinese woman, mother of Lam’s Santa Cruz-born daughter, Anna. A mix-up with the adoption paperwork listed the boy as “George Ow” instead of “George Lam.” The family lived in Canton in a three-story brick building constructed by Lam. He brought his family to Santa Cruz in 1925, where in the 20 years before, he had made his fortune via an Aptos apple dryer, a Front Street store, a restaurant, and a Chinese credit bureau. George got to meet Lam Pon’s friends and relatives in Santa Cruz, and make some friends of his own. They returned to China in 1930, settling in an affluent part of Canton, and enrolling George in private school. (Chinese Gold, Sandy Lydon).\n\nOn Sept. 18, 1931, a Japanese-owned railroad suffered an explosion that Japan blamed on Chinese nationals, which became an excuse to seize Manchuria and create the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932. In 1934, Tokyo declared all of China to be a Japanese preserve, requiring Tokyo’s consent for any actions. On July 7, 1937, an incident near Beijing led to a Japanese invasion, sparking the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Republic of China (which at the time was the mainland) was now receiving 80% of supplies from abroad through Canton and Hong Kong, so it was feared a Japanese blockade would be a crippling blow to China.\n\nMrs. Lam Pon gave George $10, and they put him on the Steamship President Hoover to send their 17-year-old son back to the safety of Santa Cruz. But he almost didn’t make it out of port, for as the ship was embarking, it was struck by a Japanese bomb. After an inspection, the bomb was found to have caused only minor damage. The voyage was pleasant enough, with a layover in picturesque Honolulu, where George bought an $8 ukulele. He arrived in San Francisco with only $2 left, then took the train to Santa Cruz, to live with his uncle Lam Sing. Sing ran the Canton Market on Pacific Avenue below Cathcart Street. George enrolled in Santa Cruz High School and worked at the market after school.\n\nShanghai, “The Pearl of the Pacific,” was an international city divided into autonomous districts controlled by a variety of nations: Britain, France, the U.S., Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, etc. It was one of the few places that required no passport, and would become a haven to Europe’s Jews fleeing the Nazis and the Communists. In November 1937, The Japanese army captured Shanghai, then on Dec. 13, seized Nanjing, the capital of the Republic of China. For six weeks, the city was subject to an ongoing “Nanjing Massacre,” of looting and arson, executing 200,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians, and raping around 50,000 women. Many parts of China endured mass starvation.\n\nBowl of Rice Party\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Jr. chaired the “United Council for Civilian Relief in China,” sponsoring a “Bowl of Rice” Party fundraiser in New York’s Chinatown in 1938, attended by 85,000. San Francisco’s Chinatown mounted its own “Bowl of Rice” Party soon after, drawing 275,000, and raising $80,000. Dan and Rose Yee helped organize a “Bowl of Rice” party for Santa Cruz, approaching numerous service organizations to participate, with the Trocadero Night Club in the Casa Del Rey Hotel donated for the occasion. The program consisted of a dinner with music, entertainment and dancing. Dan Yee made an elegant master of ceremonies with his Cantonese accent, and Rose was a most glamorous hostess.\n\nThis was the kind of event Lam Sing and George Ow would have attended. In a time of famine, rationing, and shortages, the grocery store was a symbol of plenty, where all walks of life gathered. George felt keenly the need to giving back, having once known starvation, he appreciated the value of helping others. Dan and Rose Yee had been visiting Chinese clubs throughout California to encourage “Bowl of Rice” fundraisers. Yet Dan Yee, saw something magical in these Chinese-themed cultural events, with food, drink, and music, and drew inspiration from the design of various Chinese nightclubs around the state.\n\nSo in 1941, Dan Yee opened the “Tea Cup” nightclub in downtown Santa Cruz, on Pearl Alley. Once a warehouse for Stikeman & Pierce Grocery, the concrete building was transformed for $10,000 into an atmospheric Chinese palace, with “The Tea Cup” name in Chinese characters on the facade, only translated on the blinking neon sign, which drew patrons from noon to 2 a.m. The club set the tone with a painting of a pagoda covering one wall, an artificial willow tree with hanging vines, and bamboo chairs and banquettes at linen-covered tables. The plush-red carpets and a sky-blue ceiling were adorned with palatial lanterns, tapestries, and Chinese antiques imported from Hong Kong. This included the cook, from the Kwong Chow Restaurant in Hong Kong, cooking on a Chinese stove with craters for iron caldrons.\n\nPianist Bill Leong, once featured at a Chinatown hotel in San Francisco, now performed on the spinet, a relative of Dan’s mother, Yee Leong She. The main room was a restaurant with a small dance floor, and the adjoining cocktail lounge had a horseshoe-shaped bar. They sponsored a “Boston Tea Party — 1942” at the Tea Cup, drawing over 200 attendees to raise money for the Red Cross. George Penniman, Stanford Smith and Mrs. Pat Howell collected the money, while Red Cross women were waitresses dressed in orange and black Chinese costumes.\n\nHong Kong crisis\n\nThe day after Pearl Harbor, Dec. 8, 1941, Japan attacked Hong Kong, defended by British, Indian, and Canadian units. At last China declared war on Germany, Italy and Japan. Stockton-born Dan Yee was especially concerned. He first took a steamship from San Francisco to Hong Kong in 1917 during World War I to attend school. The ship was blacked out every night, then detained 10 days at beautiful Manila, with its Spanish architecture, until they gained passage to Hong Kong. When his father died there in 1922, Dan inherited a four-story building. Yet the day after Pearl Harbor, Dan’s mother, two brothers, relatives, and a host of friends were trapped in the city. After the fall of Canton (in 1938), refugees had fled to Hong Kong, raising the population from 600,000 to over a million. This overcrowding reduced the availability of food, and the price of rice and soybeans skyrocketed 150%. The colony surrendered on Christmas Day 1941, yet by New Year’s, the heaviest fighting was in Hong Kong’s Happy Valley, where Dan’s mother was living.\n\nA letter written by Dan’s mother on Oct. 9, 1942, was smuggled out of Hong Kong by the Chinese Underground, and three months later printed in the Sentinel. His family had all fled Hong Kong for the interior of China and were safe, but his mother felt duty-bound to remain and look after their property. She noted that Hong Kong had become “a City of Death.” Each person was rationed 8 ounces of rice a day as their only food, sold at $1.20 a pound, and firewood at $6 a pound. “The dead are piled in the streets (on every street corner). Other skeletons still move; they are the living dead in Hong Kong.”\n\nDan certainly felt helpless in the face of catastrophic hunger abroad. Yet despite plenty of soldiers on leave in Santa Cruz, wartime regulations made it difficult to keep the Tea Cup open. The Office of Price Administration (OPA) based a restaurant’s yearly food allotment on the number of meals served during the month of December (while peak demand in a tourist town was July). Because meat was in short supply, the OPA mandated Tuesdays and Fridays to be “meatless.” Other days, meat was often stretched, made as meat loaf, stew, stroganoff, or cream chipped beef. At last, on Sept. 4, 1943, Dan Yee closed the Tea Cup, and enlisted in the Army. (Liz Pollock: Lost Restaurants of Santa Cruz Co.).\n\nWith China as an ally, America saw fit to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943. As a trained translator, Dan was sent to military intelligence school in Minnesota for nine months, then to Fort Lewis, Washington. At Camp Howze, Texas, he met the irascible Gen. “Vinegar Joe” Stilwell, so named for his bluntness. Yet on learning Dan was from Santa Cruz, the general from Carmel, who’d served at Fort Ord (1940-1941). felt they had something in common. Joe conducted a conversation in impeccable Chinese with Dan, having been trained in China and Beijing before the war. After VE Day (Victory in Europe) May 8, 1945, Dan Yee was stationed at Camp McQuade in Watsonville, where he did translations and worked with Chinese speakers.\n\nAfter the war, Dan and Rose Yee opened a new Tea Cup restaurant, upstairs in the flat-iron building at the head of Pacific Avenue. That grand room had formerly been the Santa Cruz County Courthouse in 1859. For 44 years the Tea Cup was a local institution, only brought to an end by 1989 earthquake damage.\n\nMeanwhile, George Ow graduated from Santa Cruz High in 1940, married Emily Lee in 1942, who gave birth to George Ow Jr. in 1943. The couple worked in a market on Mission Street, then George entered the U.S. Army in 1944, participating in the liberation of the Philippines. George was discharged in 1945 and opened the New Monterey Market near Cannery Row. Then in 1962, Ow moved to Santa Cruz County to start all over again at age 44. Yet this time, he had such phenomenal success with his supermarkets in Capitola and Scotts Valley, and other real estate ventures, that he became a local institution and beloved philanthropist."
