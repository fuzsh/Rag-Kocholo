        "text": "Hoover Co. and North Canton.\n\nFor almost a century, the city was so intertwined with the international company at the corner of Maple and Main streets that to talk about one meant discussing the other.\n\nEven in industrial Stark County, no city was tied as close to a single business as North Canton was married to Hoover, a company’s whose products were used around the world.\n\nThen it ended.\n\nAlmost a decade after TTI Floor Care North America closed the iconic factory, North Canton is emerging into a new, post-Hoover Co. reality.\n\nThe population has grown. Income tax collections are back to levels last seen before Hoover’s dismantling. Redevelopment continues at the former factory campus.\n\nCOMPANY TOWN\n\nThe eponymous “Hoover” smokestack that towered over North Canton has been removed temporarily for restoration, but the company’s shadow still looms over the city.\n\nWilliam H. “Boss” Hoover moved his family’s tannery to the center of New Berlin in 1873. Thirty years later, the W.H. Hoover Co. had 200 employees, having prospered making horse collars and leather goods.\n\nBut the product that turned the Hoover name into a global brand was the sweeper.\n\nThe Electric Suction Sweeper Co. sold 300 sweepers in 1908, the year “Boss” Hoover bought the patent and reorganized the company. It later became Hoover Co.\n\nA year after “Boss” Hoover’s death in 1932, the company was the largest maker of vacuum cleaners in the world.\n\n“The entire town either worked for the Hoover Co. or had relatives who worked for the Hoover Co. or somehow were impacted,” said Kathleen Fernandez Hillibish, who retired last month as director of the North Canton Heritage Society.\n\n“Boss” Hoover was the first mayor of New Berlin, and had a “benevolent, paternal relationship” with his workers, for whom he felt responsible, Hillibish said.\n\nFor decades, the community and company shared police and fire departments. “Boss” Hoover built homes for employees to buy and covered their mortgages. The company and the Hoover family contributed to schools, a stadium, community buildings, a library and other community projects.\n\nThe company even played a role in naming the community. When anti-German sentiment swept the United States during World War I, Hoover Co. pushed to change New Berlin’s name to North Canton.\n\n“I can’t really think of anything they didn’t have some kind of hand in starting or supporting,” Hillibish said.\n\nMany Hoover Co. employees saw each other as part of a family.\n\n“That company was so good,” said Richard Pike, 75, who joined Hoover Co. as an engineer in the 1960s and retired in 1998. He still collects company memorabilia and regularly gathers with other retirees for dinner.\n\nPike said generations of workers kept Hoover going, so it was there when he needed a good job.\n\n“I can’t pass it on, but at least I was given that opportunity,” he said, his voice tinged with regret.\n\nHOOVER CO.'S END CAME IN BITS AND PIECES\n\nChicago Pacific Corp. bought Hoover in 1985, ending family control. Four years later, Iowa-based Maytag Corp. purchased Chicago Pacific.\n\nHoover employed 2,800 workers in Stark County in 1999, but Maytag cut hundreds of jobs over the next few years. Whirlpool Corp. bought Maytag in April 2006 and put Hoover up for sale two months later.\n\nHoover had more than 800 workers in North Canton at the time. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1985 tried to organize an employee purchase of Hoover Co., but in late 2006 Whirlpool sold Hoover to Hong Kong-based TTI. The factory closed in September 2007.\n\nMOVING ON\n\n“There was a lot of anger,” said Hillibish, who was hired by the Heritage Society in 2006. “In fact, there still is anger. And then there’s nostalgia.”\n\nClosing Hoover was a blow to the community’s self-image and coffers.\n\nCoupled with the country’s economic crisis, the company’s demise cost the city 2,400 jobs, said Mayor David Held. Income tax collections dropped from a high of about $7 million in 2000 to less than $5.4 million in 2010.\n\n“I remember a feeling of doom and gloom for a short period of time and then suddenly everybody remembered that’s not the only thing in town,” said Doug Lane, North Canton Area Chamber of Commerce president and a former city councilman.\n\nMaple Street Commerce bought the former Hoover campus in 2008 and is turning it into shops, offices, apartments and industrial space. More than 1,000 people, including part-time employees, work in the district.\n\nLane said the city is a good location for entrepreneurs because it has a low tax rate, high-quality services, a low crime rate, few traffic problems and a good workforce.\n\n“When (the district) is all done, we’re actually going to be better staged for the next 10 to 20 years than we would be if we were waiting for an industrial giant to wind down like a merry-go-round,” Lane said.\n\nNEXT PHASE\n\nDespite the loss of Hoover, North Canton’s population grew 7 percent between 2000 and 2014 to 17,500. The city’s median household income of $52,530 is higher than that of any other city in the county, although the poverty rate increased from 5.7 percent to 7.5 percent between 2000 and 2014.\n\nLast year, income tax collections reached $7 million for the first time since 2000, the city’s ceiling.\n\nHeld attributed the rise to new jobs in the Hoover District, plus the growth of existing businesses.\n\n“Washington Square and Walsh University — that area is booming for North Canton,” Held said, referring to city’s eastern gateway on E. Maple Street.\n\nThe university is the city’s second largest employer, behind the city schools.\n\nIn the last 15 years the university has built 12 buildings and doubled its enrollment to 2,900. It also acquired Hoover Park, including “Boss” Hoover’s boyhood home that serves as the Hoover Historical Center.\n\nWalsh will soon build a global learning center that will enable students to study alongside peers in locations around the world. The center also will have a digital media lab, computer engineering lab and expanded career services.\n\nDespite the university’s growth, many people in North Canton still don’t realize what Walsh offers in terms of facilities and human talent, said President Richard Jusseaume.\n\nThe university recruits faculty from around the country and has students from 33 countries and 26 states. Its undergraduates performed 42,000 hours of volunteer service.\n\n“I’m still talking to people in North Canton who drive by every day who have never been on campus,” Jusseaume said.\n\nThe Brothers of Christian Instruction opened Walsh College in 1960, two years after buying 50 acres at the corner of Market Avenue N and E. Maple Street.\n\nWalsh enrolled 67 male students when it opened and didn’t build a residence hall until 1965, a year after the first class graduated. Enrollment passed 1,000 students in 1969, two years after Walsh admitted women, but the campus remained small into the 1990s.\n\nIf Walsh were older, it might be more integrated with its community, Jusseaume said. But that can change with time.\n\n“A lot of the older residents, middle-aged and above, they didn’t necessarily grow up with Walsh,” Jusseaume said. “They grew up with the Hoover company. They lived here, they made a living here. ... We’re just hoping that as the younger generations come along, that Walsh becomes a go-to place because while Hoover is wonderful to reminisce about, it’s not coming back.”"
