This was my first experience purchasing a rare book online -- thanks for making it a good one.\n\nC. Funk\n\nThank YOU sir! My Dad really wanted this book! My folks just bought a place in Spain, and I looked all over for this book! I'm so glad that I found it, can't wait to see his face on Christmas! Being that it's so old, he never thought he'd get one. Again, thank you!\n\nJuanita T."
