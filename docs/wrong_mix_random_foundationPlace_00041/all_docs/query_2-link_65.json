The seven before him were all born in the American colonies.\n\nWhich president made Christmas a national holiday?\n\nUlysses S. Grant (1822-1885), 18th President.\n\nOn June 28,1870, Grant signed legislation making Christmas a federal holiday, as well as New Year’s Day, Independence Day, and Thanksgiving Day. Grant hoped Christmas and the other holidays would help bond people in the North and South through shared celebrations.\n\n“Old Whitey” was the beloved horse of which president?\n\nZachary Taylor (1784-1850), 12th President.\n\nOld Whitey was nearly as popular as Taylor was—several times while the steed was grazing on the White House lawn, visitors would approach him and pluck a hair from his tail for a souvenir.\n\nWhich president was a classically trained pianist and played 4 other instruments?\n\nRichard Nixon (1913-1994), 37th President.\n\nNixon’s mother encouraged him to play piano at an early age and he went on to learn violin, clarinet, saxophone, and accordion. In 1963, his musical talent became a political asset when he performed a song he wrote on “The Jack Paar Program,” which helped to repair his image after losing the California gubernatorial election the year prior.\n\nWho was the first and only U.S. president to serve non-consecutive terms?\n\nGrover Cleveland (1837-1908), 22nd and 24th President.\n\nBetween terms, Cleveland moved back to New York City, worked at a law firm, and his wife gave birth to their famous first daughter, Baby Ruth.\n\nWhich president signed the act creating the United States Marine Band?\n\nJohn Adams (1735-1826), 2nd President.\n\nAdams signed a congressional act creating the United States Marine Band in 1798, which is now the oldest active professional musical organization in the United States. Known as “The President’s Own,” they played the first ever New Year’s celebration at the president’s house and later at Thomas Jefferson’s inauguration.\n\nWhich president and his wife attended Napoleon’s coronation at Notre Dame Cathedral?\n\nJames Monroe (1758-1831), 5th President.\n\nIn 1804, Monroe and his wife, Elizabeth, attended Napoleon’s coronation while he was serving as the American ambassador to Britain and France.\n\nWho was the first president to have written a biography of another president?\n\nHerbert Hoover (1874-1964), 31st President.\n\nAfter he left office, Hoover wrote a number of books, including The Ordeal of Woodrow Wilson, the first biography of a president written by another president. Woodrow Wilson had published a biography about George Washington in 1897, but that was before Wilson became president in 1913.\n\nWhich president had turned down offers to play professional football?\n\nGerald Ford (1913-2006), 38th President.\n\nFord attended the University of Michigan, where he was a star football player. The team won national titles in both 1932 and 1933. After graduation, he turned down offers to play with both the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers. Instead, he took a coaching job at Yale University in 1935 because he also wanted to attend law school. He left after six seasons with a law degree in hand.\n\nWho was the first president to attend baseball’s opening day and throw the ceremonial first pitch?\n\nWilliam Howard Taft (1857-1930), 27th President.\n\nIn 1910, Taft became the first president to attend baseball’s opening day and throw the ceremonial first pitch, a tradition that has been honored by nearly every president since.\n\nWhich president and his wife received a Siamese cat as a gift from the American consul of Bangkok?\n\nRutherford B. Hayes (1822-1893), 19th President.\n\nThe first Siamese cat to arrive in America was sent as a gift to Hayes and his wife, Lucy, by the American consul in Bangkok. Siam the cat landed at the White House in 1879 after traveling to Hong Kong then San Francisco, and then by train to Washington, DC.\n\nWhich president was often mocked in the press for his unkempt appearance?\n\nAbraham Lincoln (1809-1865), 16th President.\n\nBefore being known as the Great Emancipator, Lincoln was known for his disheveled appearance. Newspapers often ridiculed him for it; some called him “hatchet-faced” and described him as lean and gangly. One newspaper referred to his “thatch of wild republican hair” with his “irregular flocks of thick hair carelessly brushed” across his face.\n\nWhich president hired Louis C. Tiffany—first design director of Tiffany and Co.—for a massive renovation of the White House and its private chambers?\n\nChester A. Arthur (1829-1886), 21st President.\n\nArthur hired Tiffany to do all of the redesign. To help cover some of the cost, Arthur had 24 wagon-loads of old furniture, drapes, and other household items (some of which dated back to the Adams administration) sold at auction.\n\nThough three presidents (Adams, Jefferson, and Monroe) died on the 4th of July, which president was the only president to have been born on that date?\n\nCalvin Coolidge (1872-1933), 30th President.\n\nCoolidge was born on July 4, 1872 in Plymouth Notch, Vermont and is the only president to be born on Independence Day.\n\nWhich president and his wife met in the fifth grade, were high school sweethearts, but did not marry until their mid-thirties?\n\nHarry S. Truman (1884-1972), 33rd President.\n\nOn June 28, 1919, Truman married Elizabeth Virginia Wallace, known as Bess, in Independence, Missouri, the town they both lived much of their lives.\n\nWhich president hated his painted portrait so much that he eventually burned it?\n\nTheodore Roosevelt (1858-1919), 26th President.\n\nFor his official White House portrait, Theodore Roosevelt chose the famed French portraiture artist Theobald Chartran, who had earlier done portraits of the First Lady Edith Roosevelt and Alice Roosevelt. “It was difficult to get the president to sit still,” newspapers reported Chartran said before the painting was unveiled and displayed in France in 1903. “I never had a more restless or more charming sitter.” Roosevelt, however, hated the painting, and after hiding it in a dark hall of the White House for years, he eventually burned it.\n\nWhich president put up the first Christmas tree in the White House?\n\nBenjamin Harrison (1833-1901), 23rd President.\n\nHarrison had a tight-knit family and loved to amuse and dote on his grandchildren. He put up the first White House Christmas tree in 1889, and was known to put on the Santa suit for entertainment.\n\nWhich president donated all of his presidential salary (and his congressional salary before that) to charity?\n\nJohn F. Kennedy (1917-1963), 35th President.\n\nBorn into wealth and prestige, JFK was one of the richest men to take office. He lived off the Kennedy family’s considerable trusts, so he donated his congressional salary and later his presidential salary to charities like the United Negro College Fund and Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America. President Herbert Hoover had also donated his presidential salary during his term in office (1929-1933).\n\nWhich president and his wife hold the record for longest married first couple?\n\nJimmy Carter (1924-), 39th President.\n\nJimmy Carter married Rosalynn Smith on July 7, 1946, in their hometown of Plains, Georgia. The Carters 74-year marriage makes them the longest married of any first couple. The record was previously held by George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara, who were married for 73 years and died within months of each other in 2018. The third-longest presidential marriage was that of John and Abigail Adams at 54 years.\n\nWho was the first president to ride in a car to his inauguration?\n\nWarren G. Harding (1865-1923), 29th President.\n\nOn March 4, 1921, Harding became the first president to ride to and from his inauguration in an automobile.\n\nDiscover More:\n\nSearch Chronicling America* to find more coverage of U.S. Presidents in historical newspapers and more!\n\nCheck out Chronicling America Topics Pages on related topics such as presidential elections, administrations, and assassinations.\n\nRead related Headlines & Heroes blog posts:\n\nIntriguing Facts About Presidential Inaugurations Past\n\nChristmas With the Presidents\n\n* The Chronicling America historic newspapers online collection is a product of the National Digital Newspaper Program and jointly sponsored by the Library and the National Endowment for the Humanities."
