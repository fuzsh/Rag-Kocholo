        "text": "Propaganda and promotion of favored narratives\n\nKEY NARRATIVES\n\nChinese state media, official representatives, and their proxies sought during the coverage period to promote a variety of narratives, talking points, and in some cases, proven falsehoods. One set of such narratives related to broad perceptions of China, the Chinese government, and US-China relations. These included encouraging bilateral trade and investment, relaying an optimistic economic outlook for China, as well as relatively benign content such as portrayal of Chinese traditional culture or opportunities for tourism. When focused on ethnic minority regions, Xinjiang, or Tibet, these took on a more politicized purpose of downplaying suppression of Indigenous culture and human rights. As in other countries, state media, Chinese officials, and American supporters typically sought to conflate China and the CCP, portray the Chinese government as a responsible international stakeholder, and depict the CCP or Xi Jinping himself as the rightful and “elected” leaders of China. A common refrain by state media and Chinese ambassadors to the United States was to create a false equivalence between governance and human rights challenges in the United States and much more systematic abuses and authoritarian practices in the PRC.\n\nCritical statements by US officials or commentators or policy actions taken by the US government that challenged Chinese trade policies, governance, or technology companies were framed as the US irresponsibly engaging in a “New Cold War,” being “imprudent,” or destabilizing the Asia-Pacific region, while dismissing evidence of legitimate economic and security concerns or violations of international law and agreements by the Chinese government. As US-China relations deteriorated, Chinese officials and narratives sought to portray China as a willing and reliable partner, while conflating criticism of the regime or concern over its influence efforts in the United States with racism. Content also often sought to downplay, whitewash, or outright deny the reality of systematic and severe human rights violations in China or cyberespionage targeting the United States.\n\nFrom this perspective, certain content sought to address specific topics or defame communities, activists, or other critics of the CCP. In 2019, as prodemocracy and antigovernment protests spread in Hong Kong, Chinese state media tried to defend police violence, while spreading falsehoods of protesters using military-grade weapons or the US government providing financial support for the grassroots movement. After adoption of the National Security Law (NSL) in Hong Kong, Chinese official narratives sought to downplay or deny the dangers the legislation posed to civil liberties, asserting that it upholds the “one country, two systems” framework and would make Hong Kong “more stable.”\n\nThe Chinese government’s systematic suppression of Turkic minorities in Xinjiang and the US official designation of the repression campaign as genocide—first by the Trump administration and then by the Biden administration—became another priority topic. The regime’s propaganda accelerated as evidence of mass incarceration, forced sterilization, forced labor, and directives driving the campaign originating with top leaders—including Xi himself—emerged from media investigations, academic research, rights-group reports, and refugee testimonies. Responses from Chinese official sources ranged from outright denial of abuses, claiming existing evidence were “lies” and “fabrications” to distortion of extralegal detention facilities being “vocational centers” meant to counter terrorism, to attempts to discredit documentation through sharing falsehoods on social media.\n\nOther CCP critics or independent voices among exile and diaspora communities in the United States have also been targeted. Examples since 2017 have included the singling out of ethnic Chinese women working for US news outlets, fake Twitter accounts attempting to discredit DC-based Chinese democracy activist Yang Jianli, state media criticism of former US secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and China Daily’s China Watch inserts in major newspapers containing misleading depictions of mass population transfer programs in Tibet or slandering the New York-based Shen Yun Performing Arts group in an attempt to discourage people from attending the show.\n\nWith the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the origins of the virus and the Chinese government’s initial response became another priority theme for Chinese state media and officials, particularly as it related to denying or downplaying the Chinese government’s culpability in covering up the initial signs of a new contagious viral outbreak in Wuhan in late 2019 and early 2020. At the center of this campaign were claims that the virus somehow originated in the United States, including the disproven conspiracy theory that it came from the Fort Detrick military facility and was brought to China in October 2019 by a visiting US delegation. As the virus spread globally, other aspects of this narrative involved asserting the superiority of the Chinese government’s response to a bumbling US government one, such as the alleged efficiency of China’s ability to build field hospitals within days.\n\nBeyond the coverage period, after the Russian regime’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the spreading of Russian propaganda talking points, content from state-run Russian sources, and defense of the Chinese government’s unwillingness to condemn the invasion or participate in international sanctions became another common theme.\n\nWhile media coverage in the United States remains relatively independent and heavily critical of the Chinese government and CCP, some of these narratives have occasionally gained traction among parts of the population or been repeated uncritically by US officials, politicians, or commentators, enhancing their credibility and spread (see Impact and Public Opinion, Vulnerabilities).\n\nKey avenues of content dissemination\n\nChinese state media outlets are available directly to American news consumers on cable, online, and in print, and most have local correspondents at least in New York and Washington DC, but their actual US audience and impact appears limited. CGTN America, the US branch of the international arm of Chinese state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV), employs over 100 people in the United States, and claims to reach 30 million US households (likely due to its availability in common cable packages). Yet a review of the station’s YouTube channels shows most videos receive only a few hundred views, suggesting limited public interest in its content. Similarly, China Daily¸ the CCP’s flagship English-language newspaper, has reported a circulation of 150,000 and is visible at hotels, newsstands, and Congressional offices, but between November 2020 and April 2021, it reported only $30,000 in subscription revenue, indicating that most copies are likely distributed free of charge.\n\nMore notable, and arguably influential, are several ways in which Chinese state-produced content and preferred narratives reach audiences via local, privately owned outlets or social media platforms—in some cases, without clear labeling. These avenues of dissemination include:\n\nChinese diplomats’ media appearances and social media presence: PRC diplomats have emerged since 2019 as active social media personalities, fairly frequent commentators, and interviewees in major news outlets. Arguably the largest US audiences reached were via interviews by the Chinese ambassador on television and radio with prominent hosts like CNN’s Fareed Zakaria and Christiana Amanpour and NPR’s Steve Inskeep, and on NBC’s Face the Nation. Collectively these garnered millions of viewers and listeners. At least 10 high-profile interviews occurred between January 2019 and May 2022 on topics ranging from Hong Kong to COVID-19 to the Russian regime’s invasion of Ukraine. The interviewers often challenged the ambassador to address sensitive topics like abuses in Xinjiang, the initial COVID-19 cover-up in Wuhan, or the CCP’s authoritarian rule, but PRC representatives often dodged such questions and as a result, were effectively granted access to a large, national audience to voice key Beijing talking points (see Key narratives). Former ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai (serving from 2013 to June 2021) was also a prolific author of op-eds in diverse outlets, including the Washington Post, New York Times, Politico, Newsweek, Bloomberg, and USA Today. This format allows for less immediate opportunity to challenge false or distorted claims. His successor Qin Gang (who began work in July 2021) also published multiple articles although not with the same frequency or profile of publication. The reduced number of articles may be related to the sunsetting of an agreement with the US-based public relations firm BLJ to help the Chinese embassy in “crafting, editing, and placing op-eds” that ended in June 2020. Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing Hong Kong official, also published an op-ed in the New York Times on October 1, 2020, titled “Hong Kong is China, Like it or Not.”\n\nBetween June 2019 and October 2021, PRC diplomatic outposts and individual representatives to the United States created accounts on Twitter, including not only the Chinese embassy and ambassadors in Washington DC, but also consulates in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. (This appears to be part of a broader strategy that saw Chinese diplomats around the world engaging more actively on social media.) The following of the Chicago and San Francisco consular accounts were under 5,000, but the accounts of both ambassador Cui and ambassador Qin quickly garnered a large following, with each reaching over 140,000. The tone of many of the posts is relatively mild but adheres closely to CCP talking points on life in Xinjiang or US-China relations; some posts were shared dozens or even hundreds of times, although it is not clear how many of those engaging with the posts were US residents or authentic users. The Chinese embassy account had a following of 108,000 as of May 2022 but had not posted any new messages since January 2021, when Twitter reportedly locked the account over a post stating that Uyghur women were no longer “baby making machines.” The wide access of PRC diplomatic accounts to US audiences in contrast to the heavy restrictions and overt censorship placed on US diplomats’ ability to communicate directly with Chinese news consumers and social media users has been a point of consternation for the US Department of State.\n\nPaid inserts in national and regional news outlets: The English-language Chinese-state-run China Daily has been the most visible and active outlet in paying mainstream US media outlets to publish supplements with its own content in print and online, although CGTN and Xinhua, as well as Chinese company Huawei, also engaged in such efforts in recent years. China Daily has been doing so for many years, although during the coverage period, the appetite for its payments and content appeared to have declined among some major outlets following greater transparency enforced in US government filings (see Resilience). In total, between January 2019 and the end of 2021, China Daily spent slightly over $7 million buying ad space online and in print in eight US media outlets, according to submissions filed with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA); based on past reporting evasion, the actual number maybe be larger.\n\nIn 2019–20, the expenditures and placements were concentrated primarily in the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and Foreign Policy. But as the first three appeared to discontinue the partnerships, spending transitioned to Time ($1.4 million spent from Nov 2020 to October 2021), the Los Angeles Times, the US edition of the Financial Times, and USA Today. Most of the supplements are labeled in some capacity as being from China Daily without local outlets’ editorial input, although most also fail to mention the papers’ ties to the PRC government. China Daily also reported paying tens of thousands of dollars each month to the Los Angeles Times, Seattle Times, Chicago Tribune, Atlantic Journal-Constitution, Houston Chronicle, Boston Globe, and other local newspaper printing companies to borrow their facilities to print physical copies of China Daily.\n\nCGTN and Xinhua content has also appeared in an online supplement on CNN’s website, although fewer details of the arrangement are available, as the Chinese outlets did not disclose the information in their FARA filings. Nevertheless, CGTN was found to have published at least 11 sponsored ad pages on CNN during the coverage period. Their content ranged from commentary about Chinese culture (“8 Chinese New Year Traditions: The Dos and Don’ts”), to narratives more clearly aligning with CCP propaganda priorities like poverty relief campaigns (“Breaking Barriers in Kuijiu), and China’s technological prowess (“China’s Transportation Revolution”). Xinhua also ran an ad with CNN promoting the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\n\nHuawei, Alibaba media influence efforts: PRC-based tech companies are also present in the US information landscape, oftentimes disseminating messages that align with their and the Chinese government’s interests with greater efficacy then official state outlets. Huawei has actively reached out to journalists to try and shape the US narrative about the company, retaining a public relations firm to schedule interviews, set up virtual town halls, organize podcast interviews, and facilitate television appearances for Huawei executives. In the first six months of 2021, Ruder Finn, the public relations firm, reached out on more than 80 occasions to US media outlets, according to the firm’s FARA disclosures. The outreach effort cost Huawei nearly $800,000 in those six months. On one occasion, Huawei ghostwrote an article for MIT scholar Nicholas Negroponte. The May 2019 article, titled “Don’t Ban Huawei,” called on the United States to pursue greater cooperation with Chinese tech firms. The article was published in Negroponte’s name in the publication Fast Company without disclosing the link to Huawei, which was a major donor to the MIT Media Lab that Negroponte founded. The piece was then cited by Huawei in a cyber security position paper and picked up by Chinese state media under titles like “MIT scholar opposes US Huawei ban.”\n\nHuawei has also published numerous advertorials in the pages of US media outlets, appearing on the websites of the Wall Street Journal, Wired, Reuters, and Politico since 2020. The Journal has published 14 such pieces since 2020, many of which portray Huawei as a force for social good that is promoting digital inclusion across the world. Wired has also run sponsored content that criticizes the US pressure campaign against Huawei and warns about the risks of decoupling. While the advertorials all stated that they were sponsored by Huawei, none of them mentioned Huawei’s close ties to the CCP or Chinese government. Huawei has run advertorials on the online website of the Hill, a publication read widely by policymakers and Congressional staff in Washington, DC. The publication’s digital news channel, Hill TV, has also featured Huawei-sponsored content, including a video series titled “Misunderstood: The Huawei Story.”\n\nIn a separate incident, Huawei directly tried to recruit Washington Post journalist Josh Rogin and other reporters to an all-expense-paid travel to Huawei’s Shenzhen headquarters. Paul Rechichi—an associate at the public relations firm Racepoint Global, registered under FARA for representing Huawei—sent an email to Rogin with the title “Huawei invites you to Shenzhen” on March 1, 2019. The trip, which was to take place the week of March 18, 2019, promised exclusive access to Huawei facilities and interviews with senior Huawei officials. Between late March and early April, several US journalists accepted Huawei’s invitation, visited Huawei’s Shenzhen facilities, and interviewed senior Huawei executives. Then, they published news stories about the tech company based on information provided to them during the trip. The Los Angeles Times published the biggest story based on the visit, a six-byline feature about Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei and the company, although it did also discuss US spying allegations against Huawei, and Huawei’s alleged role in installing spyware at the African Union (AU) headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\nAlibaba, another Chinese tech giant, whose founder Jack Ma is a CCP member, has also provided funds for US media content. Alibaba ran an advertorial on Politico in September 2019 that sought to explain how the company is “helping American businesses.” Alibaba has also sponsored nearly two dozen of the Hill’s Morning Report newsletter since 2019, although there is no indication that the company has shaped the coverage of the newsletter, which mostly deals with congressional news. Both the Hill and Politico clearly labeled the sponsorships from Alibaba, but did not disclose the firm’s close ties to the CCP and Chinese government.\n\nTelevision footage, coproductions, and other partnerships: No US television channels regularly broadcast programming coproduced with Chinese entities. However, several partnerships exist that enable CCTV footage to potentially reach US news consumers without labeling and at least one coproduced documentary aired on PBS during the coverage period. CGTN’s FARA disclosures note that the outlet’s US subsidiary has “commercial arrangements with a number of news services, including NBC News, CNN, Reuters, the AP [Associated Press], and Agence France-Presse.” Although no further details are provided, the image licensing collection of AP and Reuters list CCTV+ as one of nine “featured partners” and one of 81 “news partners,” respectively. The partnerships allow subscribers to the AP and Reuters collection to access images and videos produced by CCTV+ as well. The Reuters website reports that at least 6,000 CCTV+ video assets are available and over 250 videos are uploaded per week. AP’s notes that “stories are clean (logo free).” A Freedom House search for the coverage period found only five videos, all related to the CCP’s July 2021 centennial celebration. Neither of the database’s descriptions of CCTV offered any indication of the station being a state-run, CCP-controlled broadcaster.\n\nIn December 2019, CGTN hosted a Global Media Summit to “facilitate global conversations among Chinese and international media organizations where ideas and experiences can be exchanged.” The summit was attended by more than 300 Chinese and foreign guests and lists as “partners” several US media outlets, including Reuters, Bloomberg, and Fox News. Ryan Broderick, at the time a Buzzfeed senior reporter, was one of the event’s speakers. In February 2021, CCTV Video News Agency virtually hosted the 10th Global Video Media Forum, which focused on the theme of “media collaboration, win-win future.” The event featured speeches from John Pullman, Reuters head of videos and pictures, and Paul Shanley, AP global director of video product. Both Pullman and Shanley emphasized the need for cooperation with companies like CCTV+ to ensure that global viewers can access exclusive content from China. Shanley went as far as to title his speech “Collaboration in the News Industry and How It Can Move Us Towards a Win-Win Future.” It remains unclear and difficult to trace how such partnerships and content-sharing affect news content reaching US audiences, but reliance on CCTV footage is likely to increase as restrictions on foreign correspondents and travel throughout China tighten due to the pandemic and political controls (see Censorship).\n\nThere have been isolated instances of US television producers partnering with Chinese state media on coproductions. In one case that received significant attention, PBS SoCal, the southern California branch of the US Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), produced Voices From the Frontline: China’s War on Poverty in association with CGTN. PBS SoCal, its sister station KCET, and PBS affiliates in Idaho and Las Vegas all aired the program. The documentary touted the CCP’s poverty alleviation drive in rural communities, including in Xinjiang, where it stated that the Chinese government is “moving people from remote, rural areas to more suitable locations providing homes and jobs and chance at a better life.” Soon after the program was aired, several news outlets reported critically on the partnership arrangement, prompting PBS’s streaming website to take down the video over concerns that it did not meet PBS’s editorial standards and for PBS SoCal to launch a review of the decision to air the documentary. National Geographic and the Discovery Channel also have extensive relationships with Chinese party-state entities such as CGTN and China Intercontinental Communication Center, as well as the PRC-based private company Tencent. These US channels coproduce nature and history documentaries with their Chinese partners that often include pro-Beijing messages. However, these channels do not distribute the coproduced content in the United States.\n\nRadio programming in Washington DC and New York: A 2015 Reuters investigation found that G&E studios, a California-based company, was leasing airspace on behalf of the Chinese state-owned China Radio International (CRI) in local radio stations across the United States, identifying at least 15 that had aired their content. As of late 2021, the status of the 15 was unclear, but at least some of these stations were continuing to air CRI content, although the audience size could not be determined. WPAT, which serves the NYC metropolitan area, signed a “commercial contract” with China Plus Radio, CRI’s podcasting service. Under the contract, which ran from October 2020 to October 2021, WPAT committed to broadcasting China Plus Radio content for 35 hours every week. Potomac Radio Group, which controls several stations in the Washington DC area, also signed a new contract with the China Media Group, the umbrella organization that hosts CRI and CGTN. According to FARA disclosures, the Potomac Radio Group received more than $3 million from an entity called “CGTN-CRI” for the purpose of “radio broadcasting” between mid-2019 and the end of 2021. In exchange, the Potomac Radio Group broadcast between 300 to 500 hours of the China Media Group’s English-language programs and other programs approved by China Media Group each month.\n\nThe website of WCRW, which serves the Washington, DC area, publishes a portion of its broadcasts online. Most feature relatively uncontroversial topics such as Star Trek, unseasonably rainy weather in Beijing, or the worst US city to drive in. Sometimes, however, the broadcasts transition to more politically sensitive topics related to China such as the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics or Tibet, at which point subtle pro-Beijing messaging is evident. For instance, in an August 30, 2021, program with one American and one Chinese host, the latter describes her travel to Tibet on a work assignment. Much of the commentary is apolitical although she makes no mention of rights violations in the region. At one point she comments that Tibet is “very much a multiethnicity place… I guess harmonious might be the word that comes to mind,” echoing a key CCP talking point. The radio station website’s “about us” section notes that it “broadcasts China Radio International’s English-language broadcasting platform.” However, during audio broadcasts, the radio hosts do not identify themselves as having ties to CRI, instead introducing themselves as a local radio station.\n\nChinese state outlets’ social media presence: In addition to the global-facing accounts of China’s major state media outlets on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram, most have secondary accounts that target news or audiences in the United States including CGTN America and Xinhua North America, as well as US-based correspondents with their own personal accounts. Although the following accrued by some of the accounts is fairly large—CGTN America has 1.5 million Facebook followers and 517,000 YouTube subscribers—user engagement appears to be very low, raising doubts about the authenticity of the followers.\n\nMost posts or tweets garner a handful of shares and likes and YouTube videos only a few hundred views. There are some exceptions. Freedom House counted 16 videos by CGTN America that received over 1 million views during the coverage period. The sample was evenly divided in terms of topics between soft news (embarrassing Zoom moments or a child prodigy piano player); reports on illegal immigration or violence, often related to the US-Mexico border; and COVID-19, including segments touting China’s response and quarantine of Wuhan. Posts by vocal and provocative state media commenters like Chen Weihua of China Daily and Hu Xijin, formerly of Global Times, tend to get greater engagement. But most posts that receive higher levels of engagement, be they from state media accounts or individual correspondents, tend to be in the form of replies and “quote retweets” that are accompanied by criticism or mockery from US journalists, China watchers, or ordinary users.\n\nPayments to YouTube influencers: Reports have emerged recently of efforts by China-linked actors to pay otherwise unaffiliated vloggers to produce or broadcast pro-Beijing content, obscuring the Chinese party-state connection for viewers. This may be in part due to decisions by many social media companies to require that government-affiliated media be labeled as such. Several such examples came to light in 2021. In June, American YouTuber Matthew Galat traveled across Xinjiang and recorded vlogs about his experiences in the region. Galat published nine such videos, many of which pushed pro-Beijing viewpoints. One video is titled “The Wonderful Life of a Minority Family in Xinjiang,” for example. Galat has 122,000 subscribers; the nine videos received a total of 108,000 views. In December 2020, Galat also published a video suggesting that “Maybe it was America first to infect the world with coronavirus,” which alone garnered nearly 120,000 views. In comments to the New York Times, Galat acknowledged that he had received payments from Chinese state media for some of his travels in China and that the trip to Xinjiang had been planned by CGTN.\n\nIn September 2021, an email account associated with Hong Kong Pear Technology sent an email to the business account of Winston Sterzel and Mathew Tye, two YouTubers who had previously lived in China but then left due to nationalist trolls, police harassment, and other pressure that had ramped up since they become highly critical of the CCP. Initially, they (alongside more than 100 other English-speaking YouTubers also included in the email) were offered a fee in exchange for promoting tourism in Hainan. But, eventually, they were instead offered a different promotion campaign by which they would receive $2,000 to publish a client-prepared video clip claiming that the coronavirus originated in the US deer population. Sterzel and Tye did not publish the coronavirus disinformation. Instead, they each published videos exposing the attempted influence operation. In the same videos, the two YouTubers also published an email exchange between a CGTN-affiliated individual and another China-focused YouTuber generally more sympathetic to the Chinese government, Cyrus Janssen. In the March 2021 email exchange, CGTN agreed to pay a fee to Janssen to license clips from one of his recent videos. In the video, titled “Americans Don’t Understand the Truth About China,” Janssen said that “America is always going out saying that ‘China needs to change. China needs to embrace democracy.’ … But that is not true. That theory has been proven wrong and China has proven to the world that there’s another way to do this.” CGTN’s YouTube account published Janssen’s video in two separate clips in March 2021.\n\nIn another example, in November 2021, the Chinese Consulate in New York signed a $300,000 contract with Vippi Media Inc. to promote the Beijing Olympics and Paralympics games. Under the contract, made public via FARA filings, Vippi Media would contract at least eight influencers active on Twitch, Instagram, or Tiktok to promote the games. The influencers in turn would post at least 24 sponsored content segments about the games, 18 of which would be posted between February and March 2022. Seventy percent of the content posted would be related to the Olympics; 20 percent would be about “cooperation and any good things in China-US relations;” and 10 percent would be related to news items about the consulate.\n\nChina-US Exchange Foundation (CUSEF) funding for journalist trips, outreach to HCBUs and Black media: CUSEF is widely viewed as belonging to the CCP’s United Front work targeting the United States, having been founded and chaired by Tung Chee-Hwa, former Hong Kong chief executive and vice-chair of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and which includes various CPPCC members on its board. The foundation is registered under FARA as a foreign principle in connection to various public relations, lobbying, and other firms it has hired. CUSEF has sponsored journalists trips to China since 2009. According to one expert’s count, CUSEF has taken at least 127 US journalists from 40 outlets to China under the program. Several US journalists from Bloomberg, NPR, Quartz and possibly other outlets traveled to China in 2019 under its sponsorship. Subsequent articles published by some of the reporters quoted Huawei executives defending the company and its willingness to reach a security agreement with the US government, questioned the efficacy of US trade policies and cited China’s resilience to withstand their effects, or echoed CCP historical narratives of national humiliation. At least one of the articles was later cited by Chinese domestic state media in Chinese. Notably, none of the journalists known to have attended the 2019 trip were veteran China reporters.\n\nDocumentation in FARA filings points to other outreach CUSEF and its proxies conducted in the media space during the coverage period. For example, a contract with Wilson Global Communications USA for the period of January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 cites public relations services worth over $300,000 to assist CUSEF in “building, enhancing, and retaining positive relationships with key opinion leaders in African American communities, students from underserved communities, and African American media outlets.” The contract explicitly cites the goal being to enable targeted individuals to “formulate personalized perspectives that can be articulated as balanced opinions when presented with Sino-US relationship issues.” The filings do not include examples of news placements, but rather involve details of various delegations of Black university students and presidents of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) sponsored by CUSEF to visit China. The contract was a renewal of a similar agreement covering 2017–18 that focused on “African American leaders” but with the new addition of “African American media outlets” and “students from underserved communities.”\n\nLocal voices promoting CCP talking points: Pro-Beijing narratives have also entered the US media landscape through friendly local commentators, politicians, and former officials, especially at the subnational level. Beijing has invested significant efforts in nurturing ties to governors, state legislators, and local officials—especially as bilateral ties at the federal level worsened during the coverage period. The US Heartland-China Association, for example, has partnered with CUSEF to bring local and state officials to China and cultivate friendly ties with Chinese counterparts, including a 2019 trip for mayors from Indiana, Ohio, and South Dakota. These efforts have in some cases translated into local and state officials deliberately or unknowingly promoting CCP narratives, such as by portraying the benefits of closer trade and other ties as unconditionally positive and “win-win,” while discounting legitimate national security risks. One 2019 study by a Chinese thinktank evaluated US governors as being “Friendly,” “Hardline” or “Ambiguous.” One of the key indicators informing the assessment were public statements officials had made regarding China and their state's ties to the country or Chinese government. Though not an objective assessment, the thinktank concluded that 17 governors were “Friendly” and 6 “Hardliners” with remaining ones having a mixed or “unclear” record.\n\nIn other cases, individual commentators, former officials, or business executives with ties to pro-Beijing entities like CUSEF have made statements or published op-eds in US outlets echoing CCP narratives. One example is the George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations in Texas, founded by Neil Bush. He made comments in 2019 that democracy “would not work for China,” downplayed the threat posed to US national security by Beijing, and claimed that prodemocracy protesters in Hong Kong were motivated by “outside influence.” Bush and other individuals affiliated with the foundation have regularly been interviewed or cited by Chinese state media like CGTN and China Daily, and have published articles in national media outlets like Foreign Affairs and in local newspapers like Missouri’s Springfield News Leader. Such articles during the coverage period called for a renewed “engagement consensus” on China, warned of the dangers of a “new Cold War,” and called for revived trade cooperation. In June 2021, an Axios investigation revealed that the foundation had received a $5 million grant from CUSEF—$1 million a year over five years ending in 2023—which per tax filings would entail a large proportion of the organization’s revenue.\n\nA few organizations and publications on the far left of the US political spectrum downplayed or denied documented human rights violations committed by the Chinese government against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim minorities. In some of these cases, financial ties to Chinese party-state entities were evident. A detailed investigation by New Lines magazine traced a network of far-left entities and found that over the past five years, many had received funds from individuals or charities with current or prior ties to Huawei or other Chinese government-linked entities. In other cases, links to Beijing were unclear and repetition of CCP preferred talking points may have been the result of authentic anti-imperialist, Marxist, nationalist, or other ideological alignment—but nevertheless served to amplify and add credibility to CCP narratives for the organization’s readership. One report by Coda found that denial of CCP abuses in Xinjiang on discredited fringe websites like Grayzone had nevertheless trickled out to a wider range of progressive or left websites and outlets. Reports dismissing evidence of the abusive practices against Uyghurs from pro-Beijing voices like the Qiao Collective have also been published in leftist scholarly publications. In at least one case, this drew a detailed response from a group of other left-leaning scholars, including well-respected experts on Uyghur culture, history, and the human rights crisis, highlighting documentation of such abuses.\n\nEchoing of certain CCP narratives was also evident in right-wing media. In several monologues in 2020–21, prominent Fox News television commentator Tucker Carlson referred approvingly to authoritarian actions of Chinese leaders, including placing restrictions on gaming and discussions of celebrity fandom, to support critiques of the Democratic Party or progressive policies. Prominent authors and publications on the New Right, part of the conservative movement, have also published pieces admiring the Chinese government’s authoritarian practices, such as population transfers used in poverty alleviation, including in Xinjiang, as necessary for the common good.\n\nDisinformation campaigns\n\nMultiple disinformation campaigns from PRC-linked accounts targeting US users were documented during the coverage period by social media platforms, forensic researchers, and academic institutions. For the purposes of this report, disinformation is defined as the purposeful dissemination of false or misleading content, especially through inauthentic activity—via fake accounts, for example—on global social media platforms.\n\nThe level of activity over the past three years from suspected PRC-linked campaigns points to experimentation with new tactics, as well as attempts to refine and improve media influence strategies, not only on topics related to human rights violations in China but also domestic politics in the United States.\n\nDespite a proliferation of apparent disinformation campaigns, most posts appear to have received relatively few views from authentic users and there is no evidence suggesting a significant impact on public opinion. However, few PRC-linked disinformation campaigns targeting the United States appeared prior to 2019, so the scale of recent activity is notable.\n\nChina-specific issues: In one of the first campaigns exposed in mid-2019 and removed by Twitter and Facebook, Chinese-language speakers in the United States, among other countries, were targeted with disinformation about prodemocracy protests in Hong Kong and efforts to smear the reputation of US-based activists or other CCP enemies like billionaire Guo Wengui. In mid-2021, a joint investigation by ProPublica and the New York Times exposed a network of videos on YouTube by Uyghurs in Xinjiang claiming that reports of rights abuses were false. Many of the videos used suspiciously identical language and were reportedly prompted by propaganda authorities. Some of the videos specifically responded to concerns over abuses voiced by former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. The videos were shared on Twitter by a network of accounts seemingly designed to avoid influence operations detection. Another coordinated campaign in 2020 by nationalistic Chinese netizens—whose precise links to the Chinese state remain uncertain—involved a network of 65 Twitter accounts that impersonated Taiwanese citizens and published posts aimed at harming Taiwan’s international reputation or giving the impression that Taiwanese users supported independence for California.\n\nCOVID-19: In addition to global efforts by Chinese state-linked actors to spread conspiracy theories that COVID-19 originated in the United States, several coordinated campaigns sought to influence perceptions of the US government’s response to the pandemic. In March 2020, text and social media messages amplified by China-linked accounts carried false warnings about a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown and troop deployments to prevent looting and rioting. The campaign was an apparent attempt to incite public panic and increase distrust in the US government. Among thousands of YouTube channels taken down by Google in 2021 for engaging in “coordinated influence operations linked to China,” some involved content in Chinese and English with “criticism of the US response to the COVID-19 pandemic” and “the US COVID-19 vaccine rollout,” although no further details were provided in the company’s publicly available quarterly reports.\n\nDomestic divisions, US social issues, and elections: Available evidence points to at least sporadic attempts to influence US users on domestic political issues. Among the above-mentioned set of YouTube channels from coordinated influence operations linked to China that were taken down by Google in 2021 were also ones that touched on “social issues in the US” and “growing US political divisions. ” One campaign exposed in September 2021 by FireEye and Google included posts from fake accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube that encouraged people in the United States to participate in protests, either related to COVID-19 or against anti-Asian racism. While there were no indications that any real-world mobilization occurred as a result, the attempt signifies a new level of brazenness in Beijing’s efforts to influence domestic political activity in the United States. Networks of fake accounts linked to China have also been known to try to influence views on US elections, although not on a wide scale and not necessarily in favor of one candidate or another. A Cardiff University study of a network of inauthentic accounts on Twitter found content critical of both candidates for president in the 2020 elections. Some posts did, however, amplify calls for violence and other social discord both before and after the January 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol. Most messages did not gain much traction, but one subsequently debunked video of someone allegedly burning ballots in Virginia, was ultimately shared in early November 2020 by Eric Trump and garnered over a million views. The clip had come to the attention of the user whose post Trump retweeted via two accounts in a China-linked disinformation network.\n\nTaken together, these examples and other studies indicate that although the impact of these attempts to date has been limited—due partly to rapid detection, poor English, or unappealing messaging in posts’ content—notable resources are being devoted by PRC-linked actors to such campaigns. According to Google’s quarterly reports of takedowns on YouTube, a total of 10,570 channels were removed from January to September 2021 for engaging in “coordinated influence operations linked to China” with between 682 and 2,946 channels removed each month. This was by far the largest set of takedowns during that period. Other studies have found evolving sophistication in the tactics being deployed. A February 2021 report from Graphika, for instance, found that persona accounts in a global disinformation network linked to China were especially effective at facilitating “genuine engagement,” achieving greater success than previously in prompting shares from real social media influencers in multiple countries, including from the account of a television station in Texas.\n\nCensorship and intimidation\n\nVarious Chinese government actors and pro-Beijing individuals deploy an array of actions to suppress disfavored news coverage, silence voices critical of the CCP, or encourage self-censorship among US news outlets and ordinary citizens. The tactics used and the aggressiveness with which they are deployed intensified during the coverage period. Within China, US-based news outlets and journalists were a prime target for intimidation and censorship efforts by Chinese officials even relative to reporters from other democracies. This is due to a combination of worsening bilateral relations, anti-American propaganda in Chinese state media, and US outlets’ consistent record of independent, global agenda-setting, and often critical reporting of the Chinese government.\n\nThe following are among the most significant trends and serious examples:\n\nIncreased Chinese government restrictions on US media and correspondents in China: Authorities in China censor American media outlets and obstruct the work of their correspondents. This limits US and English-speaking global audiences’ access to news about China and cuts Chinese news consumers off from independent coverage about the US and the world. The websites of mainstream US news outlets (including the New York Times and Washington Post) and publicly funded broadcasters (such as Voice of America and Radio Free Asia [RFA]) are blocked in China, and Apple has removed many US outlets’ apps from its app store in China. Since 2019, the websites of US news outlets such as Quartz and the Huffington Post have also been blocked or had apps removed.\n\nObtaining foreign correspondent accreditation for US journalists in China has become increasingly difficult. In March 2020, the Chinese government retaliated against a Wall Street Journal op-ed by expelling the paper’s reporters. After the US government reduced the number of visas for Chinese state media reporters to the United States and shortened the length of each visa to 90 days (with renewal), the Chinese government reciprocated by expelling the correspondents of the New York Times and Washington Post. Multiple mainstream US outlets have moved their bureaus covering China to Seoul or Taiwan, although a small contingent of correspondents working for US outlets remain in mainland China or Hong Kong. In November 2021, US and Chinese officials reached an agreement to reverse some of these restrictions and several US journalists received visas to China, including to cover the Beijing Winter Olympics in February 2022, although challenges remain.\n\nFor US journalists remaining within China, travel inside the country and speaking with Chinese citizens has also become more difficult, with Chinese authorities intensifying surveillance and restricting access to locations such as Xinjiang or other sites of breaking news, including by following, harassing, and detaining reporters. According to the Foreign Correspondents Club of China (FCCC), US reporters from both print and broadcast media encountered such reprisals during the coverage period when they sought to visit Hotan in Xinjiang, photograph caves in Yunnan where Chinese scientists had studied bats infected with coronaviruses, report on demolitions in Shandong, or cover school protests in Inner Mongolia. In a new trend, foreign correspondents from the Los Angeles Times and other outlets reported being threatened with legal action by sources in China who had previously given consent to be interviewed, apparently under pressure from authorities. Strict COVID-19 lockdowns in 2021 and 2022 added to the challenge of covering news outside of Beijing or Shanghai amid increased travel limitations and concerns over being unable to return home from a reporting trip due to rolling citywide lockdowns.\n\nDetention of Chinese nationals working for US outlets or family members of US-based journalists: Chinese nationals working for US news outlets in China face significant surveillance and tight oversight by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which directly hires Chinese citizens working for foreign media organizations, including reporting assistants as well as auxiliary staff like cleaners and temporary hires like drivers or translators who might assist with a reporting trip. The December 2020 detention of Chinese national Haze Fan, who at the time was working for Bloomberg News, on opaque state security charges was especially chilling for her colleagues and others in the industry. Fan was released on bail in June 2022 after more than a year in custody, but her case appeared to still be pending at the time of writing. China-based relatives of journalists in the United States, especially those working for Radio Free Asia’s Uyghur service, have also been detained and in some cases sentenced to prison on vague “national security” charges. According to RFA, Chinese authorities have detained dozens of family members of six Uyghur Service reporters since 2017. These include two brothers of RFA editor Eset Sulaiman and the brother of Mamajan Juma, deputy director of the Uyghur service.\n\nOnline trolls and intimidation: Coordinated online harassment campaigns targeting journalists working for US outlets increased in frequency and aggressiveness during the coverage period. The campaigns tend to target women of East Asian, including of Chinese descent, often catalyzed by Chinese state media reports or other official comments. The trolls not only disparage the journalists’ coverage of China but, according to the FCCC, also “make crude sexual innuendos, including alarming threats of physical violence.” Emily Feng, National Public Radio’s (NPR) China correspondent relayed in the FCCC’s report that “after a state-linked blog published numerous exposés criticizing my reporting from half a year ago as ‘illegal,’ hundreds of Chinese social media accounts began posting my picture along with comments like ‘beat her to death’ and describing sexual acts.” Los Angeles Times correspondent Alice Su was similarly singled out by the nationalist tabloid Global Times in July 2021 for her reporting. New Yorker writer Jiayang Fan detailed examples of harassment she faced in early 2020 when living in New York during the early stages of the pandemic. Chinese internet trolls, fueled by hostile Global Times articles, started to attack Fan as a traitor to China. The trolls also came after Fan’s ailing mother, expressing joy at her prospective passing, and sending messages wishing Fan a gruesome death. Several incidents of Chinese students or other speakers on US university campuses encountering online intimidation, exclusion from WeChat groups, or harassment of relatives in China by Chinese security forces were reported during the coverage period. Examples included a Chinese student at Purdue who was forced to withdraw from speaking at a virtual panel regarding the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, a Uyghur American lawyer disrupted when talking at a Brandeis webinar about her detained brother, and attempts by the Chinese Student and Scholars Association to have a speaking invitation to Hong Kong activist Nathan Law withdrawn.\n\nCyberattacks and hacking: During the coverage period, several American news outlets faced cyberattacks or hacking attempts that appeared to be linked to the Chinese state. In February 2022, news emerged that hackers tied to China broke into the servers of the News Corporation media conglomerate, allowing the intruders to “access reporters’ emails and Google Docs, including drafts of articles,” beginning as early as February 2020. The attack affected the Wall Street Journal and its parent Dow Jones, as well as the New York Post. News reports about the hack relay that the attackers appeared interested in a range of topics, including Taiwan and Xinjiang, US military activity and technology regulation, and articles about President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and White House officials. US-based Chinese diaspora outlets or news aggregators critical of the Chinese government also reported during the coverage period that they were targeted regularly with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or phishing attempts apparently linked to or originating in China.\n\nCorporate pressure on journalists to self-censor: Many US media or technology corporations have diverse business and content portfolios, including entertainment and financial reporting reaching audiences in China. In some cases, this has created pressures from firms or high-level executives on journalists or commentators to restrict content that may endanger such operations, as occurred in a widely publicized incident at Bloomberg in 2012. Two more recent examples were publicly exposed during the coverage period, but more may have occurred behind the scenes. In late 2019, news reports described a leaked memorandum from a senior news director at the sports network ESPN that explicitly discouraged political discussion about China and Hong Kong, after general manager Daryl Morey of the National Basketball Association’s Houston Rockets publicly expressed support for prodemocracy protests in the territory. Some of the station’s coverage appeared at the time to comply with the memo instructions. The network has a digital partnership with the Chinese social media conglomerate Tencent and its popular QQSports platform—renewed in July 2019 for five years and $1.5 billion—and had suffered several reprisals and broadcast disruptions over the tweet. In another incident, in September 2021, LinkedIn blocked the profiles of several US journalists from being visible to users in China, citing “prohibited content.” One of the reporters, Bethany Allen-Ibrahimian of Axios, relayed that the company said they would restore her account’s visibility in China “if you update the summary section of your profile,” implying that she would need to delete references to topics sensitive to the Chinese authorities in the version of her profile visible globally. Shortly after the controversy, LinkedIn announced it would be closing the China-facing portion of its platform due to the “challenging” environment.\n\nControl over content-distribution infrastructure\n\nNo Chinese company is involved in the US digital television market and Chinese state presence in mobile infrastructure has decreased. Prior to 2022, Chinese state-owned enterprise China Unicom had permission to operate in the United States, providing mobile network and ethernet services, but the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revoked this authorization in January 2022 because of increased national security concerns and “a lack of candor, trustworthiness, and reliability” in the firms’ communications to the commission. The decision followed two other similar ones in 2019 (rejecting a bid by Chinese state-owned China Mobile to provide telecommunications services) and in October 2021 (revoking US authorization for Chinese state-owned China Telecom). In 2021–22, one remaining meaningful market share retained by a China-linked company was in the mobile device sector. Motorola, a subsidiary of the China-based private firm Lenovo, held between 9 and 12 percent.\n\nDespite this reduced footprint in telecom infrastructure, PRC-based companies with close ties to the CCP have managed to gain a foothold in the social media space, raising the prospect of current or potential future content manipulation and data collection (surveillance concerns are beyond the scope of this report). During the coverage period, TikTok, a short video-sharing app owned by Beijing-based social media company ByteDance, grew dramatically in popularity in the United States, consistently ranking among the top ten most downloaded apps in 2019 and 2020. By the end of 2021, TikTok was the country’s most downloaded app. Alongside a broader uptick of the app’s usage, major news outlets (including CNN, MSNBC, and the Washington Post) and political leaders (such as former President Barack Obama and Senator Ed Markey) opened accounts on the app to communicate with youth audiences. There have been some documented cases around the world and in the United States in recent years of TikTok removing or downplaying politically sensitive content, including content that violates domestic Chinese censorship guidelines, although the company has subsequently reported having corrected this. Several media reports from 2022, including based on leaked internal meetings and investigations, raised concern that statements made by ByteDance regarding data privacy of US users were false and that employees had monitored US journalists, while more broadly calling into question other statements the company has made regarding its policies.\n\nOne other app with ties to the Chinese tech sector that gained popularity in the United States during the coverage period was Newsbreak, a news aggregator that focuses mostly on local news personalized by an algorithm. It ranked third for downloads in that category in the US Apple Store in 2021. In 2020, the app reportedly had 23.7 million installs. An investigation by the Wire found no evidence of current ties to the Chinese government, but did uncover close relations (including personnel overlap) or early investments from other Chinese tech firms with government connections such as Baidu or Yidian. The Wire found that “while the majority of News Break’s approximately 250 workforce is in the US, it has two China-based subsidiaries in Beijing and Shanghai that employ data engineers and R&D (research and development) personnel.” Experts cited in the article noted that it may be susceptible to pressure from the Chinese authorities, although evidence of such manipulation did not emerge during the coverage period.\n\nBy contrast, clear evidence exists of censorship or monitoring of US-based users of the WeChat app, owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent, which has close ties to the CCP and as of early 2023, a government stake purchased in the company. As more Chinese-speaking users look online for their news consumption, this has increased the influence of WeChat as a gatekeeper. The app is heavily used among Chinese-speaking Americans and others wishing to maintain personal, professional, or business contacts with individual in China. Estimates vary as to the number of users in the United States, but there have reportedly been 22 million downloads of the app in the United States since 2014 and approximately 2 to 3 million monthly active users. According to several reports, there was an increase in downloads in 2020–21, both before and after US government action indicated the app could be banned, with one source finding that the United States was the most important new overseas user source for WeChat in 2021, with 1.7 million app downloads. Given the demographics of Chinese speakers in the United States, many of these users are concentrated in particular geographic areas, such as California, New York and New Jersey, and Texas. This pattern increases the potential impact of any election-related manipulation on WeChat in local races with high concentrations of Chinese-speaking voters, even if the total number of such voters is proportionally small in the overall electorate.\n\nNumerous reports have emerged of WeChat users in the United States experiencing politically motivated censorship after expressing views or sharing content critical of the CCP, Xi Jinping, or the Chinese government, including information related to COVID-19. Penalties include having posts deleted, groups shut down, being shadow banned (meaning messages appear to be posted but other users in a group or private conversation are unable to view them), or having accounts being temporarily or permanently shuttered. Such incidents appear to have increased in recent years amid a tightening of information controls within China and a sensitivity to a broader range of topics, including the pandemic. In January 2020, the prodemocracy group Citizen Power Initiatives for China (CPIFC) filed a lawsuit in California against Tencent on behalf of the organization, its founder, and six plaintiffs. The complaint documents various forms of censorship and their consequences for plaintiffs’ free speech, privacy, mental health, and livelihoods, as well as apparent evidence of surveillance when Chinese security agents interrogated friends or family based on contact made over the app. According to the complaint, “CPIFC’s ongoing investigation has uncovered hundreds of examples of…harms, all flowing from WeChat users in the United States, including in California, making comments perceived as critical of the Party-state.” Those interviewed in the United States by the organization when preparing the complaint also “describe living in fear that they or their loved ones will be punished for their postings critical of the party-state, and who describe having to suppress the human urge to voice their thoughts and feelings to their social networks out of such fear—that is, to engage in extreme self-censorship.” These accounts match those relayed by users in other news reports, as well as revelations of censorship by Dutch hacker Victor Gevers and the Canada-based Citizen Lab, which found evidence of systematic monitoring of content of messages by WeChat users in the United States and screening for politically sensitive keywords, even when these messages were not subject to deletion.\n\nWeChat’s content restrictions also affect the sharing of news by US-based media organizations and journalists. A Freedom House survey of US-based Chinese language reporters and commentators found that respondents from a range of outlets (including US-funded broadcasters, individual commentators, and privately owned Chinese media or news aggregators) reported that either they personally or their news outlet had experienced politically motivated censorship or shadow bans, had a WeChat account shuttered, or was unable to open an account. Similar constraints apply to civil society and human rights groups. In the above complaint, CPIFC notes that it does not have a WeChat account “for fear that the challenged practices would either allow the Party-state to spy on it with impunity, or would result in any account being blocked, or both.” Moreover, the organization’s name is censored on WeChat as is the name of its founder, prominent democracy advocate Yang Jianli, and several CPIFC employees.\n\nWeChat’s policies and content moderation also contribute to self-censorship by Chinese newspapers and journalists who rely on the app to reach readers, out of concerns that overly critical content could result in a ban. In addition, the official account feature that allows broadcast of articles to a large audience (as opposed to circulation in closed groups of contacts) is available only to entities registered in China or with a Chinese national willing to provide their national ID number. This structural limitation further contributes to self-censorship and preemptively prevents news organizations, civil society groups, or journalists focused on human rights or other content critical of the CCP from creating such accounts. Academic research, news reports, and civic activists have expressed concern over the sensationalist nature of news content on the platform, limited fact-checking of false information, and the vulnerability of large chat groups to the spread of political misinformation and conspiracy theories.\n\nDissemination of CCP media norms, tactics, or governance models\n\nNo known CCP trainings, adoption of journalistic norms, filtering technology, or broadcasting equipment were found in the United States during the coverage period.\n\nChinese diaspora media\n\nBeijing’s influence over Chinese-language media in the United States remains significant, particularly in the television sector and via apps like WeChat (see details above). Nevertheless, compared to other countries, Chinese-speaking news consumers in the United States seeking independent news about topics of interest to them have multiple options. Members of the Chinese American community have launched initiatives to share news and analysis independent of the party-state, with some garnering a notable audience.\n\nAvailable surveys place the number of Chinese and Taiwanese Americans at 5.39 million in 2019. While 93 percent of US-born individuals report speaking proficient English, only 44 percent of foreign-born Chinese Americans report speaking English “very well” and only 57 percent of Chinese and Taiwanese American adults overall, US or foreign born, report speaking English “very well.” This leaves a large proportion of the Chinese and Taiwanese American community—particularly older people—consuming news primarily in Chinese.\n\nThe CCP’s influence on diaspora media in the United States is especially strong in the television sector. A review of Chinese-language offerings for major cable providers in the United States (Verizon, Comcast, and Spectrum ) shows that the main packages for both Mandarin and Cantonese are monopolized by stations either owned or heavily influenced by the Chinese government or CCP. These include Chinese state broadcaster CCTV-4, the Hong Kong–based Phoenix television (whose founder sold his stakes in 2021 to two Chinese state-owned entities but the station has long been known to air pro-Beijing propaganda). Two other stations are CTI-TV, part of the China Times group, a Taiwan-based media company known for its pro-Beijing editorial line (see Taiwan case study in this report) and TVB from Hong Kong providing Cantonese programming, which has been accused of pro-Beijing bias. Taiwan-based outlets or US stations known to be more critical of the Chinese government are absent from major cable packages. In one example of problematic Chinese government propaganda reaching US audiences via these stations, the rights group Safeguard Defenders filed a 2019 complaint with the FCC that cited 27 incidents of forced televised confessions of prisoners in China being broadcast on CCTV-4 from 2013 to 2019, with four outlined in detail.\n\nThe United States is also home to a wide range of print publications in Chinese, both national and local, with varying degrees of pro-Beijing alignment. On one end of the spectrum are publications like Xinmin Evening Newspaper, which the US State Department designated as part of the PRC foreign mission in October 2020. Another publication, China Press, based in New York, closely follows the CCP’s editorial line and prints large amounts of Chinese state media content. Singtao, a subsidiary of the Hong Kong newspaper by the same name, was required in 2021 by the Department of Justice to register under FARA after a change in ownership that brought it closer to the Chinese government, although in filings the company claimed that its US subsidiary is editorially independent from the Hong Kong parent company. The World Journal is another leading national paper tied to the Taiwan-based United Daily Newspaper, which within Taiwan is known to be relatively friendly to China in its coverage but that does report occasionally on topics like human rights violations in the PRC.\n\nJoining these are various local newspapers and in some cases small-scale radio stations, many of which maintain ties to the Chinese government and CCP. In a list of participants to the 2019 World Chinese Media Forum hosted in Hebei Province, a total of 64 news outlets from the United States were listed, one of the largest delegations. These included US representatives for Chinese state media but also from local outlets in San Diego, Seattle, Chicago, and Dallas, among others. The summit—jointly organized by the State Council Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, the Hebei Provincial People’s Government, and state news agency China News Service, with opening speeches by top officials in the CCP’s United Front Work Department— aimed to convene Chinese-language press from around the world and encourage them to use their “advantage” of being integrated in foreign countries “to tell China’s story.”\n\nChinese-language sources critical of the Chinese government: Despite this strong footprint, Chinese-speaking Americans have access to independent or critical alternatives. These include Chinese-language versions of mainstream outlets like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, as well as online versions of US-funded Mandarin services like Voice of America and Radio Free Asia (RFA), which regularly publishes original reporting and first-hand accounts of grassroots developments in China, including in Xinjiang and Tibet. Chinese activists, civil society groups, and youth interested in providing a diversity of content and independent reporting to Chinese-speakers in the United States and elsewhere have founded various news aggregators, websites, and newsletters, including China Digital Times, Citizen Power Initiatives for China, Beijing Spring magazine, Outsight China, and Freedom House’s own China Media Bulletin. As more Chinese Americans get their news online, it has also granted a wider audience to Chinese-speaking YouTubers, websites like Mingjing News, and political analysts critical of the Chinese government and Xi Jinping, some of whose shows regularly garner hundreds of thousands of views, but whose speculation about internal CCP politics may also consist of rumors and gossip rather than fact-based investigations. Chinese Americans who practice the Falun Gong spiritual discipline have also founded and expanded several Chinese-language news outlets since 2001, posing rare competition to pro-Beijing media in the television and radio sectors. The outlets include Sound of Hope radio, based out of California, as well as New Tang Dynasty Television (Xintangren) and its sister publication the Epoch Times (Dajiyuan) that are based out of New York.\n\nThe above array of alternative sources offer viewpoints and information to Chinese speakers that are omitted from outlets aligned with Beijing. They include interviews with or writings by CCP critics, rights activists, or victims of persecution, live talk shows and debates on Chinese political and social issues, investigative reporting on rights abuses or other topics heavily censored in China, objective coverage of US government statements regarding China, unfiltered simultaneous translations into Chinese of major speeches by US officials or election debates, and cultural programming independent of CCP influence. Such reporting and programming has garnered persistent harassment, threats, obstruction, and physical intimidation from the Chinese government or suspected proxies. These include cyberattacks, website blocks in China, pressure on advertisers in the United States, harassment of journalists’ family members in China, or detention and even imprisonment of sources and relatives of journalists.\n\nChinese-language media, both with links to the CCP and without, has also not escaped the polarization and partisanship that has gripped the US political system and media more broadly. Academic studies and anecdotal accounts of content on WeChat point to the presence and even wide circulation of misinformation, including with regards to the pandemic and the 2020 elections. Several prominent Chinese-language outlets and dissidents in the United States favored former President Donald Trump and repeated electoral misinformation to their audiences, although some have reverted to a more moderate tone after the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and seeing the Biden administration taking actions like sanctioning Chinese officials for rights violations in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and other parts of China. As US-China relations have become tenser in recent years, some Chinese American journalists have voiced concerns over being caught in the middle, viewed suspiciously by both nationalist Chinese and Americans worried about CCP influence. Taken together, in addition to the challenges posed by pro-Beijing propaganda, there remain gaps in professionalism and fact-checking in many of the sources used to inform Chinese-speaking Americans not only of events in China but also within the United States."
