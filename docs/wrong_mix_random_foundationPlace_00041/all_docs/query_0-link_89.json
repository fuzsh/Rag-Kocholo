During his time in the Senate he was considered a moderate Republican, best remembered for settling a Pennsylvania coal strike and advocating for environmental causes. After his primary defeat in 1926, he was considered by President Hoover to fill the seat of retiring associate justice of the Supreme Court, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., but in a surprising move, Hoover chose a liberal justice to fill the seat. In retirement, Pepper remained active in politics, openly opposing Roosevelt's New Deal policies and arguing cases before the Supreme Court. He died in 1961. - The Challenge To Liberty",
