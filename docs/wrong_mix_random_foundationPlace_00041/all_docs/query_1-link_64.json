The play is our protagonist Stefani’s story and each character takes shape according to her memory and understanding them. From the victims of each car accident to fictional characters from popular animations such as Totoro, Dora the Explorer, and Up, Little Stubby Wings shows the complexity of how trauma and grief can be triggered. The play begins with a car accident in Baltimore, Maryland, involving two elderly Chinese passengers on American Airlines, and immediately slingshots Stefani back to her sister’s death. In trying to rewrite the death of her sister Mei, Stefani takes a pilgrimage through her memories with Mei. From Totoro’s Catbus to George and Martha, the children’s book, Stefani finds herself thrown back and forth between the fantasy of what could have been and the reality of what she has lost.\n\nThe Conservation of Parity by Stefani Kuo\n\nRecommendations: 1\n\n·\n\nCast:\n\n8\n\n·\n\nGenre: biography, docudrama/historic + 6 more\n\n·\n\nKeyword: conservation, parity + 8 more\n\nGenre: biography, docudrama/historic, drama, fantasy, period, political, tragedy, translation\n\nKeyword: conservation, parity, physics, wu, History, chinese, WWII, communists, immigration, home\n\nIn 1936, Wu Chien-Shiung boards ocean liner President Hoover in Shanghai for California.

She is 24-years-old, she is headed to America to study physics, and promises to return to her family in China soon. Over the next four decades, WWII and the Chinese Civil War will take this promise from her. She will become Dr. Wu, the first and only Chinese woman to work on the Manhattan Project and atomic bombs. She will marry and naturalise as an American citizen, and by the time she returns home, all her family will be dead. The Conservation of Parity tells the story of Wu's first decade in America, and how her determination to aid China turned her into one of the most instrumental physicists in American history. It is a story filled with science and history, but at its core, it is the journey of a woman who comes to America and continually tries to find her way back home.\n\nFinal Boarding Call by Stefani Kuo\n\nRecommendations: 6\n\n·\n\nCast:\n\n7\n\n·\n\nGenre: docudrama/historic, drama + 2 more\n\n·\n\nKeyword: Hong Kong, Freedom + 5 more\n\nGenre: docudrama/historic, drama, political, translation\n\nKeyword: Hong Kong, Freedom, democracy, China, CCP, Chinese Communist Party, Voting\n\nFinal Boarding Call tells the stories of the current Hong Kong protests.

The play, written in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English, revolves around seven characters in Hong Kong. From extremist Hong Kong vigilante to Mainland Chinese mother, the play begins with a flight, a brief entrance into the Hong Kong protests and how the violence sensationalised by the news affects the daily lives of Hong Kongers in the city. But it ends in a stalemate, an unpredictable future that we are living in now. This is a play about ordinary Hong Kongers. It is a story of war, of desperation, and the fight for freedom. These people are real, they are still fighting, and their stories deserve to be told.\n\ndelicacy of a puffin heart by Stefani Kuo\n\nRecommendations: 9\n\n·\n\nCast:\n\n5\n\n·\n\nGenre: comedy, dark comedy + 12 more\n\n·\n\nKeyword: female, friendship + 8 more\n\nGenre: comedy, dark comedy, drama, experimental, fable/folktale, fantasy, horror, immersive, movement/physical, musical, mystery/thriller, political, tragedy, translation\n\nKeyword: female, friendship, women, love, loss, death, mother, Lesbian, cancer, bipolar disorder\n\nIn a small San Francisco apartment in the 1990’s, Meryl and Ana Sofia, a lesbian couple, attempt to conceive a child through in-vitro fertilization while navigating Meryl's bipolar disorder II.
