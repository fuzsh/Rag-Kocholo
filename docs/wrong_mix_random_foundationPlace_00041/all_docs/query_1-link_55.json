A member of the University of Chicago Board of Trustees since 1988, Crown led the board as chair from 2003 to 2009, playing a critical role in UChicago’s completion of a $2.4 billion capital campaign—the largest in its history at the time.

He taught for more than a decade at what is today Carnegie Mellon University before returning to UChicago as a professor in 1975. Survivors include his partner, Nancy L.
