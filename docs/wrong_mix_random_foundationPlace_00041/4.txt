The exhibit Enter the Dragon: The History of China in the Twentieth Century will open in the Herbert Hoover Memorial Exhibit Pavilion on Tuesday, August 27, 2002, through March 29, 2003. The exhibit is based on documents, posters, and photographs from the Hoover Institution Library and Archives. In addition, landscapes, jewelry, porcelain, and bronze mirrors—some of the many art objects in the archive’s China collections—will decorate the cases.

Among the rare documents in the exhibition are original letters from Sun Yat-sen, original artwork produced on the Long March, and posters from the cultural revolution, the latter a recent acquisition of the archives. In addition, materials on the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the history of Hong Kong will be included.

The Herbert Hoover Memorial Exhibit is open Tuesday through Saturday, 11 a.m. through 4 p.m.. For additional information or to schedule group tours, please contact the Hoover Institution Archives, 650-723-3563.
