        "text": "Nick Jonas siblings-American actor and singer, Nicholas Jerry Jonas was born on September 16th, 1992 in Dallas, Texas in the United States.\n\nJonas was born to Denise Miller and Paul Kelvin Jonas. He shares the same parents with his three brothers; Frankie Jonas, Kevin Jonas and Joe Jonas.\n\nJonas was brought up in Wyckoff, New Jersey, and his mother taught him at home. Jonasâ career began when, at the age of six, he was identified by a professional show business manager while his mother was having her hair cut in a barbershop.\n\nAt the age of seven, he started playing on Broadway, taking such parts as Gavroche, Tiny Tim, Chip Potts, and Little Jake, among others.\n\nWhile performing in Beauty and the Beast (2002), Jonas co-wrote the song âJoy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)â with his father. The song was included on the compilation album Broadwayâs Greatest Gifts: Carols for a Cure, Vol. 4.\n\nLater, INO Records distributed the song to Christian radio in 2003, serving as Jonasâ lead single.\n\nNick Jonas career\n\nWhen Jonas was seven years old, he started performing on Broadway. In 2002, he recorded his debut single, which drew the attention of Columbia Records.\n\nThe label then signed Jonas and his elder brothers, Joe and Kevin, to the Jonas Brothers band.\n\nItâs About Time, the groupâs debut studio album, was made available by the Columbia label in 2006.\n\nThe trio released their self-titled second studio album in 2007, which became their breakout album, after leaving Columbia Records and joining with Hollywood Records.\n\nDuring this time, the group rose to prominence on the Disney Channel, gaining a sizable fan base through the network.\n\nThey also starred in two of their own series, Jonas (2009â2010) and Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream (2008â2010), as well as the hugely popular musical television movies Camp Rock (2008) and Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010).\n\nThe trio continued to enjoy financial success with their third studio album, A Little Bit Longer (2008); the albumâs lead song, âBurninâ Up,â peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers announced a break after the release of their fourth studio album, Lines, Vines and Trying Times (2009).\n\nIn 2010, Jonas created a new group called Nick Jonas & the Administration, who issued the album Who I Am.\n\nAfter that, Jonas turned his attention to acting and appeared in several Broadway productions as well as recurrent roles on the television program Smash.\n\nAfter the bandâs formal breakup in 2013, Jonas started working on his second solo studio album. He signed with Island Records and issued Nick Jonas through the company in 2014, the year that saw the single âJealousâ become a commercial success.\n\nLater, together with the Island and Hollywood labels, Jonas co-founded the record company Safehouse Records.\n\nJonas received the Hal David Starlight Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2016 after the albumâs release.\n\nIn 2017, Jonas made an appearance in the action comedy Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, which went on to become the yearâs fifth highest-grossing movie.\n\nEarly in 2019, The Jonas Brothers came back together, and in June of that year, Happiness Begins was their first studio album. On March 12, 2021, Jonasâ third solo studio album, titled Spaceman, was made available.\n\nLast Year Was Complicated (2016), his third studio album, reached its top position at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart.\n\nWho are Nick Jonasâ siblings?\n\nNick Jonas shares the same parents with his three brothers; Frankie Jonas, Kevin Jonas and Joe Jonas.\n\nSource: www.Ghgossip.com\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqegnKNdn7yvrdJmqqKanJ67qL%2BMppyerF2bv6K6yqKcZqKfmnqiusNmop6umaN8"
