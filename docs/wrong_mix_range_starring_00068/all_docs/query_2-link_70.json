Have an account? .\n\nThe Jonas Brothers (Nick, Joe, and Kevin Jonas) have been in the limelight since the early 2000s.\n\nAs the siblings have grown up in front of fans, their fashion choices and hairstyles have evolved.\n\nThey went from color-coordinated vests to developing their own styles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's the band at their first Kids' Choice Awards appearance in April 2006.\n\nNick Jonas wore an Ed Hardy shirt and Joe's hoodie sleeves included thumb cutouts.\n\nAt a 2006 appearance on MTV's popular show \"Total Request Live,\" the band chose laid-back clothes and goofed around behind-the-scenes.\n\nWearing T-shirts over long sleeved tops was a popular trend at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe brothers matched with black, grey, and white hues at the 2007 Teen Choice Awards.\n\nJoe's short hair grew out and he started rocking a side part. He also wore his tie under his collar while Kevin accessorized with a scarf-like garment. At nearly 15 years old, Nick channeled his inner businessman for his outfit.\n\nJoe's hair defied gravity at the November 2007 American Music Awards.\n\n\"I have a few hair and facial hair regrets,\" Joe told GQ in 2015. \"I had long hair to my shoulders at one point and I would flat-iron my hair so that it would point out. It was like I was an animated character. Someone taught me how to do it and I sort of got addicted to it. As I got older I realized that was kind of an abnormal thing to do.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn January 2008, Nick's curly locks covered his entire forehead.\n\nKevin's hairstyle remained relatively the same, but Joe was still addicted to straightening his hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' 2008 KCA outfits featured bits of green that perfectly fit with the show's signature slime.\n\n\"I think we hit that age where we didn't want to be kids anymore, and we were trying to be adults,\" Joe recalled during an interview with People in 2017. \"We wore really oversized suits to the Kids' Choice Awards, which is just kinda fun and wild and crazy.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm not saying it was a bad look! It just probably a little bit premature and wasn't right, exactly. I had an ascot underneath. It was really great. I think we were one step away from top hats! Which we ended up doing, as well, for a while.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's Kevin accessorizing with a scarf, Joe wearing a skinny tie, and Nick rocking a striped polo in May 2008.\n\nFor a few summers, Disney Channel rounded up the network's stars to compete in a series of obstacles. It was known as the \"Disney Channel Games.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June 2008, Nick, Joe, and Kevin refined their styles for the premiere of \"Camp Rock.\"\n\nNick also started keeping his curls at a shorter length.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the Teen Choice Awards in 2008, Nick wore a white outfit and a dark blue V-neck shirt underneath.\n\nThey dominated the awards show that year, taking home wins for choice breakout group, choice music single (for \"When You Look Me in the Eyes\"), choice music love song (also for \"When You Look Me in the Eyes\"), choice summer song (for \"Burnin' Up\"), most fanatic fans, choice male hotties, and choice male red carpet icons.\n\nJoe rolled up his sleeves for the September 2008 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nJoe went all-out with blue piping on his blazer, a navy shirt underneath, and a striped tie. Meanwhile, Kevin chose all-black attire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey wore sweaters and ties at a book signing in November 2008.\n\nThe band released a book called \"Burning Up: On Tour With the Jonas Brothers.\" As suggested by the title, it gave fans a glimpse into their touring adventures and featured behind-the-scenes photos and commentary.\n\nThe band looked spiffy in black outfits at the 2009 Golden Globes.\n\nNick chose a Burberry suit, Joe selected a Dior Homme suit, and Kevin wore Emporio Armani for Product Red.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the 2009 Grammys, Nick wore Burberry while his older siblings wore Versace and bow ties.\n\nThat night, the band was nominated for best new artist.\n\nWhite-framed glasses were necessary for the premiere of their 3-D movie, \"Jonas Brothers: 3-D Concert Experience\" in 2009.\n\nThe concert film featured appearances from Demi Lovato and Taylor Swift.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the 2009 KCAs, the guys seemed comfortable not wearing coordinating outfits.\n\nJoe's hair grew out into a curly mop, while Kevin and Nick's styles remained the same.\n\nMonths later at the 2009 MTV European Music Awards, Joe once again changed his hairstyle.\n\nThey were nominated for best group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe wore thick-framed glasses at the 2010 Grammys.\n\nKevin wore a Lanvin suit, Joe picked a Dolce & Gabbana suit, and Nick chose a Gucci suit.\n\nAt the 23rd KCAs in March 2010, Kevin wore a striped outfit and Nick paired a multicolored bow tie with a tan jacket.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe wore a gray jacket and a white V-neck shirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's a photo from Joe's top hat phase.\n\nThis is also the year that \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam\" was released.\n\nThe siblings cleaned up nicely at the 2012 Met Gala with tuxedos and black bow ties.\n\nNick rocked custom Richard Chai, Joe chose Calvin Klein Collection, and Kevin wore Black Fleece by Brooks Brothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans were distraught when Joe shaved off most of his hair in June 2013. It grew back a bit by the time the Teen Choice Awards took place two months later.\n\nJoe showed off the dramatic transformation on Instagram and Vine.\n\nA few months later, in October, the band announced that they were breaking up and not releasing a fifth album that was already in the works. The stars cited frequent arguments as the reason for their split and Nick was the one to initiate the separation.\n\n\"In a nutshell, I said, 'Look, I feel like we've had some complications within the group for a long time without addressing them. I think this train will fall off the tracks without really getting real about some of the concerns and some of the limitations that we may feel as individuals in the group,'\" Nick said on \"Good Morning America.\" \"It was a tough conversation … It was the first time we really had that real conversation.\"\n\nDespite the group's split, they were photographed together a few times. Here they are at New York Fashion Week in September 2013.\n\nNick started styling his hair a bit differently, with the front section neatly combed upwards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNick attended the 2015 Grammys without his siblings, wearing a buttoned up white shirt and a gray striped suit.\n\nThat night, he presented the award for best country album.\n\nFollowing the success of solo tracks \"Chains\" and \"Jealous,\" Nick showed off his biceps while performing in California in May 2015.\n\nFans became aware of Nick's ripped physique after he posted a shirtless photo on Instagram in 2013. He continued working out after landing a role as an MMA fighter named Nate on the series \"Kingdom,\" which lasted from 2014 to 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the Jonas Brothers were on hiatus, Joe formed a band called DNCE. He also dyed part of his hair teal.\n\nThe group consisted of Joe, Jack Lawless, JinJoo Lee, and Cole Whittle. They released the song \"Cake by the Ocean\" in September 2015 and the track became a chart-topper.\n\nNick Jonas stepped out with a buzz cut at the Vanity Fair Oscars Party in February 2016.\n\n\"I shaved it because I was shooting 'Kingdom,' and I wanted to look different,\" he told MTV News. \"And I wanted to have a bit of a harder look, and I felt like — and other people felt like — when I have a shaved head that I do look that way, but more menacing.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one point, Joe completely shaved off the hair on the left and right sides of his head.\n\nHe showed off the look at the Z100 Jingle Ball in December 2016.\n\nAnd then he went back to a buzz cut, as seen at the 2017 Vanity Fair Oscars Party.\n\nJoe wore Ermenegildo Zegna Couture to the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May 2017, Nick attended the Met Gala with future-wife Priyanka Chopra. They both wore outfits designed by Ralph Lauren.\n\n\"We were both wearing Ralph Lauren! And we decided to go together because it was fun,\" Chopra told Jimmy Kimmel after fans began speculating that the two stars were dating.\n\nAt that point, they weren't dating. But the following year, their whirlwind relationship was in full swing.\n\nYou might have forgotten about the time in 2017 when Joe wore a mustache.\n\nThe look was polarizing among fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn December 2017, Joe reunited with Nick at the premiere for his movie, \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.\"\n\nJoe still had facial hair, but he got rid of the full-blown mustache.\n\nThe three brothers rocked leather jackets while sitting in the front row at a New York Fashion Week show in January 2018.\n\nThey were in attendance for John Varvatos' fashion show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2018, Joe and now-ex-wife Sophie Turner made a stylish duo at Paris Fashion Week.\n\nJoe's mop of curls returned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing two elaborate wedding ceremonies in India in December 2018, Nick and Chopra wore elegant outfits to their many receptions.\n\nNick was even crowned GQ's most stylish man of 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Jonas Brothers returned to the music scene as a band in 2019, looking all grown up.\n\nNowadays, they pick looks that reflect their personal styles.\n\nAt the Billboard Music Awards in May, the band coordinated their striped outfits.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers performed at the award show and Joe married Turner at a Las Vegas chapel afterward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the premiere of their Amazon documentary in June, Nick and Kevin wore similar colors while Joe dressed in a mustard shirt.\n\nIn their documentary, titled \"Chasing Happiness,\" the stars revealed that their Disney Channel sitcom \"stunted\" their growth.\n\nThey wear bright, colorful outfits on their Happiness Begins tour.\n\nThe hues range from hot pink to forest green.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the 2019 MTV VMAs, the Jonas Brothers wore black and gray clothing.\n\nThey also performed \"Sucker\" and \"Only Human\" from New Jersey's Asbury Park.\n\nThey wore outfits with similar hues and patterns at the 2020 Grammys.\n\nThat night, they performed \"What a Man Gotta Do\" and played a small portion of a then-unreleased track called \"Five More Minutes.\" Their stage looks all had patterns that incorporated a gold color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey closed out 2021 with a performance at Hot 99.5's Jingle Ball.\n\nThe brothers wore completely different outfits at the event, which took place on December 14, 2021, at the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC.\n\nIn September 2022, the band performed at the Global Citizen Festival in Central Park.\n\nNick wore an all-red outfit, while his older siblings went more casual with their clothing choices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin, Nick, and Joe dressed up to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in January 2023.\n\nThey gave heartfelt speeches and were joined at the ceremony by members of their family.\n\nThey embarked on their latest tour (Five Albums.
