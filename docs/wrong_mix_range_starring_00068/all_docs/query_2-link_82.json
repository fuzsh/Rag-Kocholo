        "text": "Mike Carden\n\nB-day: Dec 3 1984\n\nplays guitar in an alternative rock band The Academy Is..., signed by the Decaydance imprint of the Fueled by Ramen label\n\nBand members\n\nWilliam Beckett – lead vocals (2003–present)\n\nMichael Guy Chislett – lead guitar, backing vocals, piano (2006–present)\n\nMike Carden – rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2003–present)\n\nAdam T.

Beckett and Siska recruited Mike Carden after his former band, Jodie, broke up\n\nHe’s been playing guitar since he was about fifteen\n\nquotes\n\n“..going to shows and being in kinda the rock scene, or the movement that was going down in Chicago ... and basically all my friends were in local bands or doing something… up to no good.”\n\n“As far as school goes… I was on my way to go to college, after high school, but that got cut off just coz of the band and the moderate success at that point.”\n\n\"everyone wants this back up plan, they want to go to school, something to fall back on and I think once you start making excuses for yourself you’ve already kinda failed… you’ve already said if it doesn’t work…I really truly believe that shouldn’t even start it if you thought that, that it might not work.\"\n\nTAI toured with Fall Out Boy, Panic!at the Disco, Something Corporate, Midtown, Matchbook Romance, Motion City Soundtrack and Armor for Sleep; were a main act on the 2006 Warped Tour. The band's third studio album, Fast Times at Barrington High, released in 2008 refers to the high school Beckett & Siska attended.\n\nTAITV is a video podcast series created by the band. Guy Ripley, played by Ryland Blackinton (of Cobra Starship) has his own show on TAITV called \"Guy Ripley's True Things\". TAITV episodes are made by the band's photographer and friend, Jack \"the Camera Guy\" Edinger. Jack recently is touring with Cobra Starship filming their version of TAI TV, CobraCam.Tv. William Beckett has since taken over Jack's position but has yet to post more than one episode. On October 2008, the band embarked on their fall co-headlining tour with good friends We the Kings, named \"Bill & Trav's Bogus Journey Tour\".\n\nThe band has cited influences from blink-182, The Smashing Pumpkins, 504 Plan, Stomp Aberdeen, Hot Water Music, The Promise Ring, Travis, U2, Pink Floyd, Weezer, Death Cab for Cutie, Lifetime, The Audition, Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Eat World, and Cursive\n\nKevin Jonas\n\nPaul Kevin Jonas II (born November 5, 1987), also known as Kevin Jonas and K2, is an American musician and actor. He is a member of the Jonas Brothers, a pop rock band he created with his younger brothers.\n\nJoe Jonas – lead vocals, percussion, guitar, keyboard\n\nKevin Jonas – lead guitar, backing vocals, piano\n\nNick Jonas – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, drums\n\nL to R: Joe, Nick, Kevin\n\nThe Jonas Brothers originally started with a solo singing career for Nick, but when Joe and Kevin sang backup for him, the record producer liked their sound and signed all three of them.\n\nL to R: Kevin, Nick, Joe\n\nThe band was dropped by Columbia Records in 2007. After shortly being without a label, the Jonas Brothers signed with Hollywood Records.\n\nIn 2008, Kevin appeared on a list of the sexiest men alive\n\nHe married former hairstylist Danielle Deleasa (December 19, 2009). Nick and Joe were his best men. Kevin met Danielle during a family trip to the Bahamas (2007)\n\nKevin, along with his brothers, guest starred in an episode of Hannah Montana & filmed a Disney Channel Original Movie called Camp Rock where they play a band called \"Connect Three\".\n\nThe Disney Channel reality short series, Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream, premiered on Disney Channel on May 16, 2008. The show, which ran until September 5, 2008, documented the brothers' lives on the Look Me in the Eyes Tour. He and his brothers are currently starring in their own Disney Channel Original Series named JONAS about a band of three brothers who have to cope with being rockstars while trying to live an ordinary life.\n\nThe Jonas Family\n\nmom: Denise, a former sign language teacher and singer\n\ndad: Paul Kevin Jonas, Sr., a songwriter, musician and former ordained minister at a Pentecostal Assemblies of God church\n\nbros:\n\nJoe\n\nFull name:Joseph Adam Jonas.\n\nNickname: Danger (beacause he’s crazy) .\n\nB-day :Aug.15 1989\n\nSelf description (age 13): !!!!LOUD!!!!\n\nNick Jonas\n\nAge:17\n\nNicknames:Mr.President, Studmuffin\n\nborn September 16, 1992\n\nFranklin Nathaniel \"Frankie\" Jonas\n\n(born September 28, 2000)\n\nNicknames: Bonus Jonas, Frank the Tank\n\nJonas and his brothers are of Cherokee, Irish (from their maternal grandfather), Italian, and German descent.\n\nThe Jonases are known for their wholesome, \"family-friendly\" image, and the brothers are all committed Evangelical Christians. They were homeschooled by their mother. To signify their vow to abstain from premarital sex, on their left-hand ring finger they all wear (now except for Kevin) purity rings.\n\nJoe`s ring is silver and adorned with a cross. Nick got his made at Disney World. Kevin wore a punk-rock purity ring from Tiffany covered with studs. ‘It’s pretty rock and roll,’ Kevin said. ‘It’s getting banged up a little bit because of the guitar.”\n\nThey reportedly started wearing the rings when their parents asked them if they wanted to. They also reportedly abstain from alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs\n\nok, so. if you notice some important facts/details missing, feel free to do something about that. if something is wrong plz tell me. i hope this inspires someone to write long fics with lots of ust or some nice dom-sub dynamics"
