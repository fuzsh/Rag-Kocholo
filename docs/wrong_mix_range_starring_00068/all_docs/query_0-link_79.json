Nida soon landed her breakout role in the Supernatural spin-off series, The Winchester, as Latika \"Lata\" Desai, a young hunter-in-training.\n\nTalking about the diverse role, she said: It's been so special because I remember, growing up, all I wanted was to be able to see myself in some capacity on television and in movies. I think our show is doing a really beautiful job of just that. Not only do we have different types of people, but they're also just normal people existing in society.\n\nNida added to Looper: \"Back in the day, there were a lot of stereotypes in film and television, but now I can be a Pakistani-Indian girl who's a hunter, no questions asked.\"\n\nCatch her in: The Winchesters, For the People, Station 19\n\nAvantika has been hard at work since she was a young girl, with her dance skills earning her second place in Dance India Dance Lil Masters in 2014.

On smashing South Asian stereotypes, Priya told GLAMOUR UK: \"I'm so thankful that I've had such incredible support from my family and those around me, and I can't imagine how difficult it must feel to be misunderstood within your own community, amongst your own people. It's so important for us to encourage diversity in this way within our own community and allow people to feel free. This is what people fought for, right? It was for us to have the choice.\"\n\nCatch her in: Polite Society, Bridgerton\n\nThis Barbie is a South Asian queen!

The Oxford School of Drama-trained actress has also earned praise as Lila Pitts in the second season of Netflix's The Umbrella Academy and starred in Niza Manzoor's excellent breakout comedy, Polite Society. Citing the British comedy sketch show Goodness Gracious Me as a groundbreaking turning point for her while growing up, Ritu told Vogue India: \"For the first time, we saw South Asians, our family homes, stories about them, that allowed us to just poke fun at ourselves. It was brilliant.\"\n\nCatch her in: Polite Society, Barbie, The Umbrella Academy\n\nHalf Indian, half British actress Noami Scott has been in the game for a while now.

Noami previously spoke to Teen Vogue about dealing with the intricacies of her culture, stating: \"Don't get me wrong, there were moments growing up where you're like ', oh I don't really feel Indian enough.' But now I'm at a place where I'm like, you know what, it's OK. It doesn't make me any less Indian or any less half Indian. My two favourite meals ‚Äî one is my mum's curry and one being a roast dinner. And that is me in a nutshell.\"\n\nCatch her in: Lemonade, Aladdin, Charlie's Angels, Anatomy of A Scandal\n\nIf you know anything about Bollywood, you will most certainly have heard about Deepika Padukone. She is a massive star in India, having made her name in flicks such as Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani and Bajirao Mastani. It wasn't long before Hollywood came knocking, and she made her Stateside debut in XXX: Return of Xander Cage opposite Vin Diesel in 2017.

Megan told Teen Vogue about her character: \"I'm so stoked that I got to play a brown character like Aneesa, who is something we don't see‚Äînot just opposite to Devi, but we don't ever see cool Indian girls in the media. That was something that I gravitated towards, and I was honoured that they thought I was the one to do that.\"\n\nNever Have I Ever came after her breakout role in the 2019 independent comedy film The MisEducation of Bindu, which also starred Priyanka Bose and David Arquette. This year alone, she starred in the thriller Missing alongside Storm Reid and the supernatural horror film, It Lives Inside, as well as the acclaimed series Poker Face.

She told us: \"My parents were quite protective over me. They're first generation. They came from India to this country, so they didn't really have a life where they could choose to be whatever they wanted to be.\"\n\nNonetheless, they ended up supporting her move to Los Angeles, where she bagged her first role as a background \"party girl\" in 2015's Straight Outta Compton. From there on out, she featured in Broadchurch, Wolfblood, Sex Education, and the rest is history.\n\nCatch her in: Sex Education, Bridgerton\n\nWhile Simone Ashley made a name for herself in Bridgerton, her co-star Charithra Chandran, who played her younger sister in the Netflix period drama, also became a star. Her turn as Edwina Sharma was so impressive that she actually won Glamour UK's Rising star accolade at the Women of the Year Awards in 2022. She also spoke to us about her journey in accepting her Indian heritage over the years, from unapologetically bringing her Indian food to lunch at school and posting photos wearing traditional clothing. Talking specifically about the diversity of her character in Bridgerton, she added: \"I'm a proud Indian woman, but I'm also more than that.

The half-Indian half British actress is also keeping her options open for future work, stating that she's taking Hindi classes, telling Vogue India: \"I kid you not, I grew up on Bollywood.

After winning critical acclaim with her debut acting project, Iman will reprise Kamala's role in The Marvels, a sequel to the 2019 film Captain Marvel. Iman recently explained that this role brought her closer to her Pakistani roots. She told Esquire Middle East: \"Being Pakistani was a part of my life I was very dismissive about, and I felt disconnected from my culture prior to this show.\"\n\nShe added: \"I was born in Pakistan, but I moved to Canada when I was a year old. I didn't feel like I had a connection to it. I didn't have any Muslim Pakistani friends. And I'm so grateful I got to be on a show with so many Pakistanis and Indians, many of whom I grew up watching with my family,\"\n\nCatch her in: Ms. Marvel, The Marvels"
