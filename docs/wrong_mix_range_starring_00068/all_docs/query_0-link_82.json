        "text": "When Salman Khan confirmed he will star in Sooraj Barjatya's next film, he generated much excitement in the trade. The star and the recordbreaker filmmaker last worked together in Hum Saath Saath Hain in 1999. The film was their third straight blockbuster. A new film would mark their coming together after nearly a decade and half.\n\nThe tiff between Shah Rukh Khan and Farah Khan is a thing of the past. Farah, after her brief dud sojourn with Akshay Kumar, will direct erstwhile lucky mascot SRK in her next film Happy New Year once again.\n\nMeanwhile Rohit Shetty, SRK's director in his next Chennai Express, the filmmaker said to have a Midas touch returns with his favourite Ajay Devgn next year.\n\nReturn of the dream teams: Akshay Kumar and Vipul Shah have confirmed they are returning together with Namastey London 2\n\nThis, even as Akshay Kumar returns with Vipul Shah for the first time since Shah's 2008 production, Singh Is Kinng, in the sequel to their 2007 hit, Namastey London.\n\nRanbir Kapoor and Anurag Basu will reunite for the director's next, Jagga Jasoos, after Barfi!. Jagga Jasoos will also mark the launching a production house jointly floated by the actor and the director.\n\nWhile Ranbir and Anurag have worked together only recently, the other big actor-director pairs are reuniting after a hiatus. Many of them hit the road hard with unsuccessful rendezvous while collaborating with filmmakers outside comfort zones.\n\nA classic example of this would be Ajay Devgn, who beyond Rohit Shetty to put his trust in Sajid Khan. The duo together delivered the most disastrous film of 2013 so far, Himmatwala, landing a blow on Ajay's career. Similarly Shah Rukh Khan faced hard luck with his hyped Ra.One, directed by Anubhav Sinha.\n\nRanbir and Anurag Basu apart, another actor-director duo out to join hand to make films is John Abraham and Shoojit Sircar. After Vicky Donor, the crossover hit John produced and Shoojit directed last year, the two have decided to form a more permanent association.\n\n\"John and I have similar vision when it comes to films and are planning a few more together. We do not interfere in each other's space and enjoy working together,\" said Shoojit.\n\nA star and a director who have delivered hits together in the past obviously share advantages. These are times of fierce competition in Bollywood. Working with people who know your plus points and can positively use the same on screen is the formula stars are banking on. This explains the trend of reunions.\n\nAKSHAY KUMAR & VIPUL SHAH\n\nSO FAR: Waqt, Namastey London & Singh Is King\n\nCOMING UP: Namastey London 2\n\nHalf a decade after Shah last produced Singh Is Kinng for Akshay, the two have confirmed they are returning together with Namastey London 2. Earlier this year Shah had announced his plans to make a bigger sequel to the 2007 hit. It is expected to be a fresh love triangle. The sequel will be shot on locations in France, Germany, Switzerland and London besides India. The heroine is to be decided.\n\nShah Rukh Khan and Farah Khan unite for the first time since their 2007 superhit, Om Shanti Om\n\nWHY WE WANT THEM TOGETHER: With Vipul Shah, Akshay emerged as a different actor. Shah removed him from his larger-thanlife image with a strong dramatic role in Waqt, a romantic one in Namastey London and a comic one in Singh Is Kinng.\n\nSHAH RUKH KHAN & FARAH KHAN\n\nSO FAR: Main Hoon Na & Om Shanti Om\n\nCOMING UP: Happy New Year"
