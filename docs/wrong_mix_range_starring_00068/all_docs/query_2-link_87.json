        "text": "Just call them the property brothers. Sibling trio Nick, Joe, and Kevin Jonas have come a long way since they burst onto the music scene in 2005. Since then, the Jonas Brothers have collectively tackled solo music careers, high-profile romances, and—perhaps lesser known to their fans—real estate. It all started back in 2008 when they purchased a $2.8 million ranch in a suburb of Fort Worth. In the years that followed, they each bought their own homes, declaring their unique styles and tastes with each new acquisition. (Kevin got so into real estate that he even founded his own development and construction company, JonasWerner.)\n\nHere, take a look back at all the places the brothers have called home over the years.\n\n2008\n\nThree years after they first formed the boy band and just days before kicking off their Burnin’ Up tour, Nick, Joe, and Kevin purchased a $2.8 million ranch in the exclusive Vaquero Club community in Westlake, Texas. (Technically speaking, the boys gave their mother power of attorney to sign for the six-bedroom, six-and-a-half-bathroom property.) The Southwest Traditional–style home included a wood-beamed great room, a music room, a home theater, a game room, and a wet bar within its 7,360 square feet. Outdoors, there was a saltwater swimming pool, a fireplace, a gazebo, and a kitchen. The brothers ultimately sold the home in 2015 for an undisclosed amount.\n\n2010\n\nKevin, the oldest of the three, was the first to buy his own place, a $1.2 million mansion in Denville, New Jersey, that he shared with his wife Danielle. The home boasted five bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms, with a partially stone exterior and white marble flooring throughout. The couple shot their E! reality series, Married to Jonas, there and ultimately sold it for $1.68 million in 2014 as they began to expand their family.\n\n2012\n\nIn 2012, youngest brother Nick starred in Broadway’s How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, and began renting NHL player Scott Gomez’s luxury condo in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood. The home was listed on the rental market for $23,000 a month, though it’s unclear how much Nick paid during his stay. (Marc Jacobs was also a previous tenant.) The three-bedroom, three-bathroom condo was a perfect pad for a then 19-year-old star on the rise: It featured six televisions, a lighting and entertainment system controlled by an iPad, and a 120-inch movie screen that dropped from the living room ceiling.\n\n2013\n\nThe next year, Nick set down roots in Los Angeles, snapping up a $3.2 million Mediterranean home on the Sunset Strip. The mansion, originally built in 1938, featured a living room with a wood-burning fireplace and rustic wood floors, with a spot for Nick’s grand piano. The youngest Jonas didn’t stay long, however, selling the home for $3.4 million two years later.\n\nMeanwhile, Kevin set up his company, JonasWerner Homes, and purchased a 2.5-acre property in Boonton, New Jersey, for $835,000. He razed the existing home and built a Hamptons-style mansion in its place, which included a custom 1,500-bottle wine cellar, a cigar lounge, and a putting green out back. Kevin listed the five-bedroom, six-bathroom pad for $2.3 million a few years later and ultimately sold it for $2 million in 2017.\n\n2014\n\nJoe bought his first home for $2.6 million in May 2014. The 2,888-square-foot traditional-style mansion was originally built in 1923, and still retained much of its charm, but with modern upgrades like stainless steel appliances and white subway-tile backsplashes in the kitchen and marble-topped vanities in the bathrooms. Joe changed his tune on the place less than a year later, however, and ultimately sold it for $2.9 million.\n\n2015\n\nFollowing the sale of his West Hollywood home, Joe decided to rent, staying at a $40,000-a-month Airbnb in the Hollywood Hills area. The Jeffrey Allsbrook–designed mansion was super modern, with a reported 270-degree view of the city from its perch atop Runyon Canyon.\n\n2016\n\nIn February 2016, Joe gave up the renter lifestyle and spent $3.7 million on a brand-new modern farmhouse in Sherman Oaks. The 5,600-square-foot home, known as The Sutton House, included four bedrooms and six bathrooms. The singer put the farmhouse back on the market in August 2018, and it sold for $3.7 million in early 2019.\n\nOn the other side of the country, Kevin built another home in New Jersey through his company, this time in Montville. The five-bedroom, six-and-a-half-bathroom quintessential suburban mansion featured a dining room with a floor-to-ceiling, glass-enclosed wine display and a brick-lined man cave with a pool table. He, Danielle, and their two young daughters lived there until he listed it for $2.48 million in 2018 and eventually sold it at a loss, for $2.25 million.\n\n2018\n\nNick’s personal life made headlines in 2018 when he got engaged and married to megastar Priyanka Chopra after a whirlwind romance. He dropped $6.5 million on a mansion in the coveted Beverly Hills Post Office area that year as well, but didn’t hang onto it long. He sold it a little over a year later for $6.91 million. The home featured disappearing walls of glass, a floating guesthouse, and an elevated clerestory roof.\n\nThat same year, Joe and his now-wife, Sophie Turner, bought a stylish condo in New York for $5.6 million. The three-bedroom, three-bathroom unit measured 2,907 square feet and boasted custom-stained white oak floors, European oak doors, and a 1,450-square-foot terrace. The couple ultimately left NYC for the West Coast after they had their daughter, first listing the condo for $6.5 million in July 2020 before lowering the asking price to $5.9 million. It’s unclear if they’ve yet found a buyer.\n\n2019\n\nNewlyweds Nick and Priyanka went all-in on their marital home, shelling out $20 million for a sprawling estate in Encino. The home is grand in every sense of the word, with a double-height entry hall with wood-paneled ceiling, a glass-lined mezzanine that overlooks the entryway, and a living room with a floor-to-ceiling marble fireplace. The couple worked together to join their aesthetics, and Nick told AD at the time that he felt “really lucky” that he had “found someone who was totally understanding and accepting of my preferences.” They still share the home.\n\nJoe and Sophie ended up buying a mansion in Encino just three miles away, for $14.1 million. The 15,000-square-foot property includes 10 bedrooms and 14 bathrooms, with wood and stone materials lending an earthy, homey feel to the space. Apparently this isn’t their forever home, though—they listed the property for $16.75 million earlier this year. Knowing how the Jonas brothers roll, they’ll likely find a new place to call home soon enough."
