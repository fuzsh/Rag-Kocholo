        "text": "When Alia Bhatt had come on Koffee with Karan season 6, and Karan had asked her to give hashtag to the newlywed couples. Alia had given Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Nick Jonas the hashtag, #globaldomination. Undeniably, Priyanka and Nick are dominating the globe like how and together, they have been giving us major #maritalgoals ever since they have gotten married on December 1-2, 2018 at the Umaid Bhawan Palace, Jodhpur. They keep sharing their mushy pictures and videos on social media and we can't help but drool over them.

Who would have thought then that our desi girl and the international American singer and lyricist, would one day, be pronounced husband and wife? And finally, on August 18, 2018, they got rokafied in Mumbai and 4 months later, in December 2018, they took the nuptial plunge in two ceremonies- a Hindu and a Christian wedding.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nPriyanka Chopra Jonas and Nick Jonas are celebrating Easter today (technically dated April 21, 2018, in the US). For the ones who do not know, Easter is a Christian holiday commemorating the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. Priyanka and Nick took to their Instagram to share the Easter celebration pictures. Priyanka Chopra Jonas shared the following picture on Instagram, celebrating Easter along with her hubby, Nick Jonas and in-laws, Kevin Jonas and Denise Jonas. The Quantico star captioned the pic as, \"Happy Easter from ours to yours @papakjonas.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nNick Jonas also wished his fans a very happy Easter by sharing the following adorable picture with wifey, Priyanka and captioning it as, \"Happy Easter to you and yours! From me and mine\" followed by a heart-emoji. Take a look:\n\nadvertisement\n\nJust like the paparazzi culture in Bollywood, even Hollywood is not spared by the gossip mongers and makers. Recently, a US-based magazine had reported that just 4 months into their marital life, Nickyanka (as fans fondly call Priyanka and Nick) were heading for a divorce. The report had claimed, \"Priyanka and Nick have been fighting about everything be it work, partying, spending time together. The bottom line is that Nick and Priyanka rushed into things and now they’re paying the price. Their marriage is hanging by a thread. Nick has seen a controlling side to Priyanka which he clearly wasn’t aware of before tying the knot. Another thing of Priyanka which irks Nick is her temper issues.\" (Don't Miss: Sharad Malhotra's Bride, Ripci Bhatia's Minimalist Red Lehenga Is A Perfect Pick For 2019 Brides)\n\nadvertisement.\n\nSoon the news reached Priyanka and Nick's ears and they decided to sue the magazine. Priyanka's representative told an online tabloid, \"Once she makes up her mind to deal with negative rumour-mongering, nothing can stop her. Priyanka will let loose her legal team on this news-manufacturing tabloid and ensure they get to their knees.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut we all know that eventually love wins and Priyanka and Nick have definitely taught us so indirectly, through the way they are with each other, so supportive and lovey-dovey together. Priyanka and Nick, being the global stars that they are, are always privy and under the radar of media. Recently, Priyanka had made global headlines owing to her fake pregnancy reports after a few pictures from a fashion event had surfaced online. Later, Priyanka had commented on the same and said that she wants it to happen organically. She was quoted as saying, \"We both know that that’s something that needs to happen, but it’s not something I think about very much. We’re both very driven, we love our work, we’re married to our work, and we’re both very supportive of each other’s work. So I’m sure it will happen in an organic way. We definitely want kids, and when the time is right, it will happen.\"\n\nPriyanka Chopra Jonas' mother, Madhu Chopra had also commented on her daughter's pregnancy rumours, and had shared with a media portal, \"When I spoke to Priyanka on the phone, she told me that she was tired and hence, had a slumped posture. I told her what people were saying, and she simply said, 'Mamma, give me a break.\" (You May Like: Chhavi Mittal Pens Down The Feelings Of Every Mom In A Note For Her First-Born Daughter, Areeza)\n\nADVT.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHow did you like Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Nick Jonas' Easter celebrations pictures?
