So here is my Movie Review of the first female superhero within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, 'Captain Marvel'.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n\nWho is Captain Marvel? How does 'Captain Marvel' fit into the MCU? How accessible is 'Captain Marvel' if you haven't seen many MCU movies? I discuss how 'Captain Marvel' made me aware of a superhero trope that I didn't know existed before.
