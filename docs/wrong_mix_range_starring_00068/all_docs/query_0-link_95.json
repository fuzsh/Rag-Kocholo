        "text": "Mumbai, Nov 23: Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali says people thought he’ll never be able to make his ambitious project “Bajirao Mastani” — a film that he planned to make for the past 12 years. “I kept holding it for 12 years and kept thinking about it for 12 years. People thought this will never happen, that it was impossible for the film to be made. ‘Every year he begins it and every year he scraps it’,” said Bhansali.\n\nHe initially wanted to cast his “Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam” actors Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan for the title roles. Bhansali said: “Several people came in and several went out. But it is written in the destiny of our Bajirao, Mastani and Kashibai (actors). Bajirao, Mastani and Kashibai’s souls had a will that these people (actors Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra) do this film and nothing could go against it.”\n\n“It was their blessings. And so, when it had to be made, it got made,” he added. About the experience of completing the film, Bhansali said: “It’s a wonderful state to be in, that’s why we make films to experience this one moment of seeing it on the screen. Economics might matter or not matter, films are obviously made with money but more than money, it’s made with passion and with people.”\n\n“There are several talented people who’ve worked on this film. They’re relieved. There is that sadness, emptiness and the feeling that it’s done, now I’m jobless,” he added. “Bajirao Mastani” will hit the screens on December 18. (IANS)"
