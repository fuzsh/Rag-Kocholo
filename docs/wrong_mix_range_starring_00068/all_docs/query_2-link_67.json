They shut it down at night and you are still in the property staying.\n\n\"You would come out your door and no one's there except you guys.\n\n\"But what it really comes down to is they've let people start to drink now in Disneyland and that has changed everything. \"\n\nMeanwhile, the 'Waffle House' hitmaker - who has daughters Alena, nine and six-year-old Valentina with Danielle - was joined by his brothers Joe, 33, and 30-year-old Nick in the interview and Nick explained that when he tied the knot with 'Love Again' actress Priyanka Chopra in 2018, he had \"no expectations\" for the big day because they had planned it over \"such a long period of time\" and that the whole event turned out to be \"really special\" in the end.\n\nHe said: \"We planned it pretty quickly so we didn't have that stress of expectations over a long period of time of having something planned so everything was just a plus and it was really special. Such a special day.\""
