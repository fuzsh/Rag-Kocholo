        "text": "All the Jonas Brothers and their relationships have been subjects of much interest and speculation, but Kevin Jonas managed to sidestep a lot of drama by finding his person in 2007. He and wife Danielle Jonas have been together for over 15 years and share two children, and it all harkens back to meeting while on their separate family vacations in the Bahamas.\n\nKevin actually shared a photo of the spot they met to celebrate their 11th anniversary, and it was at a wall of pay phones. So yeah, that's a long time ago.\n\n“I'm so happy you had to make that call 11 years ago,” Kevin wrote. “This is the spot we met and I thank God everyday for the gift he gave me. Here's to a 100 more baby. I love you.”\n\nHere is the complete relationship timeline for Kevin and Danielle Jonas.\n\nMay 2007\n\nWhen Kevin met Danielle, then named Danielle Deleasa, she claims she didn't even know who the Jonas Brothers were. That might have been part of her appeal. Kevin pursued a relationship with her pretty quickly. At the time, he was only 19 years old, and she was 20.\n\nNovember 2007\n\nDanielle made an off-camera appearance in the Jonas Brothers' 2019 documentary, Chasing Happiness in footage from November 2007. His brother Nick and Joe are interrupting him while he's on the phone with Danielle, jokingly asking for dating advice. After he's annoyed, they apologize, and Nick jokes, “Sorry, we're just really excited because she's your wife.”\n\nJuly 2009\n\nThey announced their engagement in 2009. Kevin asked for Danielle's hand at her house, kneeling at her family's doorstep with a cushion-cut diamond ring. Kevin told People that he designed the engagement ring with with Jacob & Co. and that Danielle “said yes, yes, yes, like 500 times super fast in a row.”\n\nDecember 2009\n\nThe couple were married on December 19, 2009, on Long Island.\n\nAugust 2012\n\nDanielle and Kevin had a reality TV series, Married to Jonas, that premiered on E! in 2012, running for two seasons. It followed them as they settled into their New Jersey life. On the show they announced they were getting pressure to start having kids.\n\n“People are like, ‘All right guys, what's your plan? When are you going to have those grandkids?’” Kevin said. “I'm starting to feel that pressure a little bit.”\n\nDanielle added, “My mom wants a grandkid bad. It's getting boring now.”\n\nThat same month, they spoke to Young Hollywood in an interview a little bit more about how they knew they were serious about each other.\n\n“I was in the city with him when he came in for a concert. I went ... to pick up my dog from my mom's room,” Danielle said. “I said to [my mom], ‘I've been driving home and all I could think was is I can't wait to say I love you to him.’ Like, I was holding it in because I wanted him to be first!”\n\nShe got her wish.\n\n“I knew [Danielle was the one] around the same time,” he said.\n\nAs Danielle was leaving the hotel, he called out, “Love you, bye!”\n\nHe added, “I turned around and I was like, “Oh no, oh no! Do I have to, like, say something now or just walk away?’ I panicked, and I just walked away.”\n\nJune 2013\n\nThe couple announced their first pregnancy in July 2013.\n\n“It's true—Danielle is pregnant! Can't even imagine how excited we are,” Kevin wrote in a tweet. “I can't wait to share this with my best friend. I love you baby.”\n\nFebruary 2014\n\nTheir daughter Alena Rose was born on February 2, 2014.\n\nIn a statement, the couple said, “We are overjoyed at the birth of Alena Rose Jonas. She is precious! We could not be more excited to start building our family together. We want to thank our family and friends for their love and support, and our fans for all of their well wishes.”\n\nKevin tweeted that he was “so in love” with his daughter.\n\nApril 2016\n\nBy April 2016, they were expecting a second child.\n\n“We are excited to share the news that we are expecting a new addition to our family this winter,” they told People. “Alena is beyond thrilled to be a big sister and we can't wait to meet the newest member of our family.”\n\nOctober 2016\n\nTheir second daughter, Valentina Angelina, was born on October 27, 2016.\n\n“We are so excited to welcome our new baby girl, Valentina Angelina Jonas to the world today,” they announced. “She is healthy and beautiful and we couldn't be happier!”\n\n“Say hello to my newest love Valentina,” Kevin wrote on an Instagram post about his new baby.\n\nMarch 2019\n\nIn March 2019, the Jonas Brothers got together again to release their first single in over six years, titled “Sucker.” By then, Nick and Joe had taken Kevin's dating advice and found wives of their own, and all three of their partners appeared in the music video. Danielle was there alongside Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner.\n\nOctober 2019\n\nKevin debuted a tattoo he got of his wife that was inspired by her look in the “Sucker” music video. He wrote, “So proud of this time in our life and getting to remember this with @daniellejonas forever!”\n\nDecember 2019\n\nKevin wrote a long tribute to Danielle to mark their 10th wedding anniversary, sharing some throwback photos from the big day.\n\nIn his post, he said he remembered all his special dates with Danielle—the date they met, the date they got engaged, and the date they married, because “they are the three most important days of my life.”\n\nHe added, “This is just the beginning, we haven't even started our journey and I can not wait for the next 10 and then the next. I love you to the moon and back.”\n\nJanuary 2020\n\nDanielle came back into the spotlight for the video “What a Man Gotta Do,” again with her sister-in-laws. In their scene, Kevin and Danielle played the romantic characters from the movie Say Anything, with Kevin standing in as John Cusack and holding up a boombox outside of Ione Skye's house. And their Morkie, Riley, was in there too.\n\nMay 2020\n\nLike most people, the couple hunkered down with their family during COVID-19 lockdown, and Kevin told The Morning Mashup it was the only nice part of the situation.\n\n“I feel like this time has been really rewarding, to be able to spend with the family,” Kevin said. “We've actually been getting on very well, so I'm happy with that.”\n\nNovember 2020\n\nDanielle celebrated Kevin's birthday with an old pic, writing, “Every year I try to think of what to write… there's just too much to say after almost 11 years! I still can't get enough of you, the girls and I are so blessed to have you in every way. I hope all your wishes come true this year. We love you more than anything!”\n\nSeptember 2021\n\nThe couple wrote a book together called There's a Rock Concert in My Bedroom, saying it was inspired by their musically-inclined daughters. They announced the book in September 2021, and it was released in March 2022.\n\n“Music has always been a foundational creative outlet in our family,” they said. “Now our daughters, Alena and Valentina, enrich our lives in ways we could have never anticipated. The love and care they show each other on a daily basis inspired this story and we are so proud to share how these girls not only uplift us and each other, but are creative, caring rock stars in their own right.”\n\nOctober 2021\n\nBefore kids, Danielle would often tour with her husband, but Kevin said she still is a big part of his schedule when he's on the road and major support.\n\n“[Danielle] understands my rest schedule along with my ability to do the honey-do list when I am home,” he told People in October 2021. “Luckily she knows how to hold it all down.”\n\nThey do meet up on tour at times, however, and make sure to have quality time as a couple.\n\n“We'll have dinner before the show, either just us or with some friends we haven't seen,” he explained. “It's just a way for us to connect even though I'm away, and then we're back into our regular rhythm.”\n\nHe continued, “We really try to even just sit down on the couch together. Honestly, some of our favorite times are when we sit on the couch and watch a show that we haven't watched in a while together.”\n\nMarch 2022\n\nIn March, Kevin added a bit more about how they talk constantly on the phone while he is on the road.\n\n“We just constantly were able to communicate,” Kevin said. “It was great, but at the same time, there were moments we'd be like, ‘Okay, we've talked for two hours, and you called me back an hour later, there's not much more we can talk about right now.’ But it's still just about being connected.”\n\nHe added, “We really try not to spend that much time apart, no matter what. We've definitely had a two-week rule in the past, but now we try to make that even less. If that means flying home for a single day to be together, we will.”\n\nJune 2022\n\nKevin discussed being in a different place in their marriage as their daughters Alena and Valentina grow up.\n\n“As our daughters start to get older and actually become a little bit more independent, so much has changed,” Kevin said in an interview. “We're doing this new independent phase and starting to do our own thing again.”\n\nJuly 2022\n\nWith the premiere of Kevin's new show, Claim to Fame, with younger brother Frankie Jonas, he was surprised with a watch party by his wife.\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nIn 2023, the Jonas Brothers were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Kevin shouted out his wife and daughters during his acceptance speech, and all three of them were by his side.\n\n“Danielle, my beautiful wife, I love you so much,” he said. “I could not have done this without you. Your support over the last 15 years ... you've seen us through all of it—the beginning, the middle, the end and then back again. Thank you for everything... Alena, Valentina, this is a pretty cool moment, don't you think? This is cool, but you two are my brightest stars.”\n\nMarch 2023\n\nThe Jonas Brothers had a five-night Broadway residency in March, and Danielle was there collecting pics and clips, which she shared on Instagram. She wrote, “Hubby's Big Broadway Debut!! So proud.”\n\nJune 2023\n\nPrior to Joe Jonas’ split from Sophie Turner, Danielle reflected on her struggle being the only Jonas Brothers wife who isn’t a famous actress. As a member of the Jonas family, “I’m also finding like my place in it because the two boys [Nick and Joe] married somebody who, they’re actresses, they’re out there, everyone knows them, and I feel like I’m Danielle, you know?” she told LadyGang podcast on June 27. “It’s hard.”\n\nShe added later to Kevin, who was also being interviewed, “I’m out there celebrity-wise because I married you. And that’s where like, it’s like, I want to have something else to my name, too, so that it feels—I don't know—more than, or like the other girls, because then when I’m with the other girls, I feel just less-than sometimes. It’s weird.”\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nKevin marked Danielle’s birthday with an Instagram tribute: “How did I get this lucky? Happy birthday Danielle. I love you so much!”\n\nDanielle, meanwhile, shared a birthday post featuring a photo of Kevin on stage. “Yesterday was so so special! Thank you for all of the love and sweet birthday wishes 🥰🎂✨” she shared."
