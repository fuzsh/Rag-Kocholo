        "text": "Kevin Jonas was born as Paul Kevin Jonas Jr. on November 5,1987 in New Jersey. His parents are Paul Kevin Jonas Sr. and Denise Jonas. He has 3 brothers Nicholas Jerry Jonas, Joseph Adam Jonas, and Franklin Nathaniel Jonas. He got his start doing commercials. Later he and his brothers wrote a song called please be mine and that is when they realized that that could be something. They formed their band in 2005. They came up with the name J3 but changed it right before their first show. They kept writing songs until 2013 when their band broke up. While Nick and Joe kept making music just on their own/with another group, Kevin decided to start a family with his wife Danielle. They got married back in Dec. 2009 and decided it was time to have kids. Their first daughter Alena Rose Jonas was born on Feb. 2,2014 and their second daughter Valentina Angelina Jonas on Oct. 27,2016. They raised them and had fun. Then the Jonas Brothers decided to reunite as a band while shooting their documentary Chasing Happiness. They went on tour in 2019 and Kevin's family came too. During 2020 Kevin has stayed home with his family but done zoom calls and video recorded singing and playing guitar so we can keep up with him and his brothers during the pandemic."
