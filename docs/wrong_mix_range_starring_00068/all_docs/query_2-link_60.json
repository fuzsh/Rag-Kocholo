        "text": "Six Things You Didn’t Know About The Jonas Brothers – From Their Original Band Name To Who’s The Richest\n\nThe Jonas Brothers are one of the biggest boybands of our time – but there are a few things you might not know about Nick, Joe and Kevin.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers are undoubtedly one of the biggest boybands that graced our TV screens and stages back in the day and Nick, Joe and Kevin have managed to maintain their fanbase to this day!\n\nAfter making their highly-anticipated musical comeback in 2019 after six years apart, it's safe to say they haven't missed a beat.\n\nNick Jonas Net Worth: The Youngest Jonas Brother’s Impressive Fortune Revealed\n\nKevin, 33, Joe, 31, and Nick Jonas, 28, dropped their album ‘Happiness Begins’ as their return, which also went on to be a seriously high-grossing tour.\n\nSo, as we have become obsessed with the Jonas Brothers all over again, take a look at six things you might not already know about the band…\n\nTheir original band name was J3\n\nThe Jonas Brothers were first called J3, but they were never fans of the title, so as they walked on stage of their first-ever concert Joe took it upon himself to change things, by introducing them as the Jonas Brothers.\n\nJoe previously told Vulture: “We hated the name… I remember turning to my brothers before the show and saying, ‘Do you want our name to be J3 for the rest of our lives?’”\n\nTheir Disney show Jonas was originally written as a spy programme\n\nNick and his brothers starred in Disney Channel programme Jonas, but it was originally meant to be centred on the boys playing secret agents.\n\nJonas would have been ‘J.O.N.A.S’ meaning Junior Operatives Networking As Spies. However, following a writers’ strike at Disney it was changed to fit in with the other shows on the channel, such as Hannah Montana.\n\nJoe Jonas is the richest Jonas Brother\n\nYou may or may not be surprised to learn that Joe is the richest Jonas Brother with a net worth of $40 million (£28.3 million).\n\nThe father-of-one embarked on a successful solo career and is frequently posting sponsored pictures on social media, making the most of his huge platform.\n\nKevin Jonas is a successful businessman\n\nKevin is co-CEO of The Blu Market, an influencer marketing company.\n\nHe told Forbes in 2016: “I’ve always had a passion for the tech industry and I like to help build interesting products.”\n\nThey’ve dated fans in the past\n\nJoe told Vulture in 2013: “I can’t say that I’ve never put a foot in that world. There were times when I definitely took advantage of the opportunities I had.”\n\nHe also recalled a hilarious memory of inviting a fan to a movie when he was 16 years old and spending the entire time making out.\n\nTheir split in 2013 caused a fallout\n\nWhen Nick told his brothers he thought it was time for them to go their separate ways, things didn’t go down so well.\n\nIn a Reddit AMA he told a fan who asked about their reason for splitting: “At first, it was really shocking to me because it was kind of all I had known was the Jonas Brothers, forever. So I was pretty mad and confused.”\n\nNick also feared his brothers would never speak to him again after telling them how he felt.\n\nBut fast forward six years and the boys have resolved their issues and are back to making the music they (and we) all love – and they've got the Jonas sisters as their support system now too."
