        "text": "​by Leslie Fobbs\n\n​Today’s celebrity homeschooling heroes involve another set of siblings. They are three brothers - Nick, Joe, and Kevin - who make up the members of the popular boy band from the early 2000s, The Jonas Brothers. I have to admit I didn’t know much about them back then, but I always appreciate learning about famous homeschoolers who chose to be out of the box even before becoming well-known. Read on to learn more about the brothers' humble beginnings.\n\nThe oldest, Kevin, was born in 1989 to parents who were also performing artists. His mother, Denise, was an ASL teacher and singer. Kevin Jonas Sr. was a songwriter/musician who performed with a Christian band. He was also an ordained minister. Later came Joe in 1989, Nick in 1992, and their younger brother Frankie in 2000 (not a member of the music group). The Jonases were a very religious, tight-knit family who traveled everywhere together. That's what made them stand out in the entertainment world.\n\nThe boys were homeschooled from the time that Kevin was in 2nd grade until each one graduated from high school. Several years ago at the height of their success, they were in the spotlight for being homeschoolers, and their mother did an interview (Pt. 1, Pt. 2, Pt. 3) to talk about their life as a homeschooling family. In it, she explains that she took Kevin out of a private Christian school because she was worried about how much time he was spending away from her. She had several friends who homeschooled and who later became a support system for her as she transitioned. Most importantly she talked about the positive effect that the lifestyle has had on her family saying she would do it all over again, regardless of their fame status.\n\nAlso there is a video of the boys revealing a day in the life of the Jonas Brothers. I wish there were a more detailed breakdown of their homeschooling schedule, but I did like that they got to wake up and start the day doing something they were each interested in. One chose to run, one watched music videos, and the youngest wrote a song every morning.\n\nAll three boys are talented and can play multiple musical instruments, but Nick Jonas is the one that was discovered at the young age of six. He sang and acted professionally including starring in Broadway plays and recording albums. He and his brothers recorded the song “Please Be Mine” which got them signed as a group by Columbia Records in 2005. They went on to record four studio albums, collaborated on several other albums, and starred in their own Disney channel show called Jonas. By 2013 they had broken up the group to pursue their separate interest, but it is no surprise that Nick Jonas continued on the entertainment path as a solo act.\n\nCurrently, Kevin is married with two children and has owned several businesses since leaving the group (a food app, a real-estate development, construction company, and a social media communications company). Joe formed a new band called DNCE and released the popular hit “Cake by the Ocean”. He is now engaged to actress Sophie Turner. And of course, Nick has continued his career by releasing a second solo album and starring in several television and film roles.\n\nThe Jonas brothers are just another example of what children can become and accomplish when they are given the freedom to cultivate their interests.\n\n​"
