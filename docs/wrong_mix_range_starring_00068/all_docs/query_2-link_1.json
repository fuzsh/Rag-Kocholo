        "text": "American musician (born 1987)\n\nPaul Kevin Jonas Jr. (born November 5, 1987[1]) is an American musician and actor. He rose to fame as the lead guitarist of the pop rock band Jonas Brothers alongside his younger brothers Joe and Nick. Jonas became a prominent figure on the Disney Channel alongside his brothers in the late 2000s, gaining a large following through the network: he appeared in the widely successful musical television film, Camp Rock (2008) and its sequel, Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010) as well as two other series, Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream (2008–2010) and Jonas (2009–2010).\n\nAfter the group confirmed a hiatus in 2012, Kevin appeared on his own E! reality series that same year, Married to Jonas, with his wife, Danielle. Following the band's initial break-up in 2013, Jonas appeared on the seventh season of The Celebrity Apprentice in 2014, founded the construction company Jonas Werner, and became the co-CEO of The Blu Market, an influencer marketing company. In 2019, he rejoined the Jonas Brothers following their reunion. The group would go on to release their fifth studio album. The reunited Jonas Brothers appeared in two Amazon Prime Video documentaries named Jonas Brothers: Chasing Happiness and Jonas Brothers: Happiness Continues in 2019 and 2020.\n\nJonas appeared on People magazine's list of the Sexiest Men Alive in 2008 at the age of 21, and thus included as part of the 21 Club.[2][3]\n\nFurther information: Jonas Brothers § Personal lives\n\nPaul Kevin Jonas Jr. was born on November 5, 1987, in Teaneck, New Jersey, and grew up in Wyckoff.[4] His mother, Denise Marie (née Miller), is a former sign language teacher and singer, and his father, Paul Kevin Jonas Sr., is a songwriter, musician, and former ordained minister at an Assemblies of God church.[5][6][7][8] He has three younger brothers, Joe (b. 1989), Nick (b. 1992), and Frankie (b. 2000).[4] As a child, Jonas appeared in several TV commercials as well as print ads. Unlike his brothers, he originally did not intend to become a musician but became interested one day after stumbling upon a book on playing guitar and playing his father’s guitar.[9]He attended Eastern Christian High School in North Haledon, New Jersey.[10]\n\nIn early 2005, Columbia Records' new president, Steve Greenberg, listened to Nick's record. While Greenberg did not like the album, he did like Nick's voice.[11] After hearing the song \"Please Be Mine\", written and performed by all the brothers, Daylight/Columbia Records decided to sign the three as a group act.[12] After being signed to Columbia, the brothers considered naming their group \"Sons of Jonas\" before settling on the name \"Jonas Brothers\".[13] It's About Time, the brothers' first album, was released on August 8, 2006.[14] According to the band's manager, it was only a \"limited release\" of a little over 50,000 copies. Because Sony was not interested in further promoting the band, the Jonas Brothers then considered switching labels. The band was ultimately dropped by Columbia Records in early 2007.[15]\n\nAfter shortly being without a label, the Jonas Brothers signed with Hollywood Records in February 2007.[16] Around the same time, the brothers began appearing in Gap Inc. commercials for Baby Bottle Pop, singing the jingle. Their self-titled second album, Jonas Brothers, was released on August 7, 2007.[17] It reached number five on the Billboard Hot 200 chart in its first week.[18] Jonas and his brothers guest-starred in an episode of Hannah Montana, titled \"Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas\", which aired August 17, 2007 on Disney Channel. The episode debuted alongside the television film High School Musical 2 and a sneak peek of Phineas and Ferb.[19] The episode broke basic cable records with a record 10.7 million viewers and became basic cable's most watched series telecast ever.[20]\n\nJonas and his brothers also starred in the Disney Channel Original Movie Camp Rock, where they played a band called \"Connect 3\". Kevin played Jason, a guitarist; Nick played Nate, also a guitarist; and Joe played the lead male role and lead singer, Shane Gray.[21] A soundtrack for the movie was released on June 17, 2008. The film premiered on June 20, 2008, on Disney Channel in the United States, on Disney Channel, and on Family in Canada.[21] They returned in the sequel, Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam, which premiered on September 3, 2010.[22] The Disney Channel reality short series, Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream, premiered on Disney Channel, May 16, 2008.[23] The show, which ran until September 5, 2008, documented the brother's lives during the Look Me in the Eyes Tour. The name was inspired by their hit song When You Look Me in the Eyes. The series was renewed for a second season, which premiered March 21, 2010.[23] The second season followed the band on the European leg of their World Tour 2009. The Jonas Brothers' third studio album, A Little Bit Longer, was released in the United States on August 12, 2008, and peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.[24]\n\nKevin, Joe, Nick, and Frankie starred in their own Disney Channel Original Series, Jonas, which premiered May 2, 2009.[25] The show was renewed for a second season premiering June 20, 2010 as Jonas L.A. It centered on the brothers vacationing at their summer house in Los Angeles with Stella and Macy. On June 16, 2009, the brothers' fourth studio album, and third release under Hollywood Records, titled Lines, Vines, and Trying Times was released. The album peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200 with 247,000 copies sold.[18]\n\nJonas appeared on MTV's fourth episode of When I Was 17, talking about life as a teenager, regarding sports and his hairstyles.[26] He guest hosted Live with Kelly, December 13, 2011, and did so a second time on July 4, 2012.[27] It was announced on May 1, 2012, that the Jonas Brothers parted ways with their record label Hollywood Records, and bought the rights to their music.[28]\n\nKevin appeared in an E! reality series alongside his wife, Danielle, and his brothers, which premiered on August 19, 2012. Produced by Ryan Seacrest, Married to Jonas documented the young couple's domestic life as well as the brothers' recording efforts as they prepared to release their fifth studio album.[29] The final episode of the second season aired on May 26, 2013. On October 29, 2013, The Jonas Brothers officially announced that the band was breaking up because of creative differences.[30]\n\nAfter parting ways with the Jonas Brothers in 2013, he founded the real estate development, construction company called JonasWerner, and is the co-CEO of The Blu Market company, which deals with communications and plans for social media influencers.[31][32][33] Jonas was part of the seventh season of Celebrity Apprentice taping in spring 2014, which was filmed throughout New York City.[34] He was fired in the second episode when his team lost the competition, during which time he'd been acting as the team leader. Kevin also made a cameo in a 2014 episode of The Real Housewives of New Jersey, working in his new role as contractor, leading the construction on Housewife Kathy Wakile's home.[35]\n\nIn 2015, he created a food app Yood.[36] As of 2016, he is also in partnership with the video-sharing app We Heart It.[37] While the band was on hiatus, Nick was on his solo music and acting career, while Joe started the band DNCE in 2015 with Jonas Brothers drummer Jack Lawless, Semi Precious Weapons bassist Cole Whittle, and guitarist JinJoo Lee.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, nearly six years after the Jonas Brothers initial breakup, the brothers announced the band's reunion.[38] They commenced their reunion the next day with releasing their new single, \"Sucker\" on March 1, 2019, and partaking in a week long segment on The Late Late Show with James Corden everyday from March 4 to March 7.[38] Jonas and his brothers appeared in the band's documentary Chasing Happiness, which was released on June 4, 2019. On May 9, 2019, a compilation album titled Music from Chasing Happiness was released. It consists of old Jonas Brothers songs, two Nick songs, one Joe song featuring a guest appearance from Lil Wayne, and a song from Joe's band DNCE, who are currently in hiatus as of January 2019 since Joe and Jonas Brothers and DNCE drummer Jack Lawless have resumed work back with the brothers.[39] Directed by John Lloyd Taylor, the documentary covers the brothers childhood life, how the brothers started as a band, why the band broke up, and how the band got back together.[39]\n\nThey released their fifth studio album, Happiness Begins on June 7, 2019. It is the band's first album released after their reunion.[40] They have released two songs with other artists, which consist of: their feature on \"Runaway\" by Sebastián Yatra, Daddy Yankee, and Natti Natasha, as well as their collaboration on \"Lonely\" with Diplo.
