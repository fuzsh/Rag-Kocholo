Did you know that a Harris put the Harris in Harrisburg? Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was founded by John Harris, Jr. on land owned by his father, John Harris, Sr. It was officially incorporated in 1791 and became the state capital in 1812.

The English Roots of John Harris Sr.

John Harris Sr. (1673-1748) was born in the county of Yorkshire, England, to Welsh parents. He spent his early years in London, making a living as a brewer. Inspired by William Penn, Harris decided to leave for the New World in search of better opportunities.

Struggles and Triumphs in Philadelphia

John began his American journey by clearing tree stumps and grading streets. His fortunes began to change when he befriended Edward Shippen, the first Mayor of Philadelphia under William Penn’s 1701 charter. This friendship blossomed into a family connection when Harris married Shippen’s relative, Esther Say (c. 1696-1757), who also hailed from Yorkshire.

A New Home Along the Susquehanna

In 1705, Harris obtained a trader’s license from the Penn family, allowing him to establish a trading post along the Susquehanna River. Initially a roving trader, Harris soon settled down and built a more permanent trading post. His equitable dealings with local Indigenous communities and wise counsel to incoming settlers earned him a reputation “as honest a man as ever broke bread,” according to local Reverend John Elder.

Harris’s Ferry and the Birth of Harrisburg

By 1733, Harris had secured the rights to operate a ferry across the Susquehanna River. Aptly named “Harris’s Ferry,” it became a vital passage for Scottish, Irish, and German immigrants moving westward. Around the same time, Harris acquired two land tracts adjacent to his ferry, totaling 800 acres. This land would eventually evolve into the bustling downtown area of Harrisburg.

John Harris Jr. Takes the Helm

John Harris Sr. passed away in 1748, leaving behind a burgeoning trading post. His son, John Harris Jr. (1726-1791), took over the family business. Growing up in Paxton Township on the east side of the Susquehanna River, Harris Jr. was well-positioned to continue his father’s work. He not only maintained the trading post and ferry service but also expanded the family’s influence through trade, retail, and real estate ventures. His wealth and influence made him a local leader, especially during the French and Indian War and the American Revolution.

Council Fires and Diplomacy

John Harris Jr. was not just a businessman; he was also a diplomat of sorts. He hosted two significant “council fires” with the Indigenous peoples of the Six Nations and other tribes. These meetings were attended by high-ranking officials, including the Governor of Pennsylvania. Harris Jr. had earned the trust and confidence of the Indigenous communities, a fact highlighted when they specifically requested him as their storekeeper during a conference in 1762.

The Evolution of Harrisburg: From Frontier to State Capital

Utilizing the land he inherited from his father, Harris Jr. laid the foundation for what would eventually become Harrisburg. In the spring of 1785, the town was formally surveyed by William Maclay, who was a son-in-law of John Harris Sr. and a member of Pennsylvania’s first delegation to the United States Senate.

By 1791, Harrisburg was officially incorporated, and in 1812, it was named the Pennsylvania state capital. Its strategic location along the Susquehanna River made it a crucial point for westward expansion, and it became a significant provisioning stop for pioneers transitioning from river to overland travel.

Over the years, Harrisburg evolved into an industrial powerhouse, especially in the steel industry. It was also a vital rail center during the American Civil War and a significant stop along the Underground Railroad.

Harrisburg Today

Harrisburg is the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in Pennsylvania, with a population of 591,712. While the city faced industrial decline and population shifts in the latter half of the 20th century, it has transitioned into a service-oriented base, with industries like healthcare and convention centers playing significant roles.
