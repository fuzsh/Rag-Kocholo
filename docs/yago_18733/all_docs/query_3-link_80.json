        "text": "Availability and how to prepare The abortion pill (also known as a medication abortion) is offered up to 11 weeks after the first day of your last menstrual period. It is a safe and effective way of ending an early pregnancy.\n\nIf your last period was more than 11 weeks ago, we can still help. Call us for a referral list of health care providers in your area that offer other abortion services.\n\nAbortion pill (medication abortion) services are available by appointment only.\n\nWhat to expect during your appointment\n\nPlan to be at the health center for 4 hour(s) for your entire visit.\n\nYour appointment will include the opportunity to ask questions & discuss birth control options.\n\nPost-Appointment Information\n\nIn the unlikely event that you are still pregnant, you may need another dose of medicine or to have an in-clinic abortion to end the pregnancy.\n\nWe’ll also give you after-care instructions and a phone number you can call with any questions or concerns.\n\nAll patients are required by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to attend an information session at least 24hours prior to the abortion. This session can happen no less than 24 hours before the abortion, but may be scheduled more than 24hours ahead of time, depending on the center’s and patient’s availability. The doctor cannot perform a procedure on a patient who has not completed this requirement. Please note: If you are UNDER 18, a parent or guardian MUST also attend the information session to sign for consent. The same parent or guardian must accompany you to your procedure. If this is not possible, judicial bypass is available. If seeking judicial bypass, please call us for more information.\n\nIf you are under the age of 18 and need help talking with your parents/caregivers or seeking judicial bypass we can help.\n\nPrices for our abortion services are listed below:\n\nAbortion pill (medication abortion) - $625\n\nPrices include all tests, labs, consultation, and medications.

Please inform us that you’d like to use your insurance when you schedule your appointment to confirm coverage and expected payment. Payment is due in full on arrival on the day of the appointment. We accept cash, credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or Discover), or a money order. No checks.
