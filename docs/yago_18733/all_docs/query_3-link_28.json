        "text": "Birth centers provide care before, during and after delivery to low risk mothers-to-be. The centers are designed and equipped to provide care for the mother and newborn in a home-like setting and includes accommodations for support persons during the birthing process. Birthing services are provided in a building organized to provide necessary staff and facilities to support the birthing process. These services are limited to mothers-to-be who do not have medical conditions that may complicate the birth. Women with complications must be transferred to a hospital to handle the accompanying risks for the mother and child.\n\nThe Department of Health licenses and surveys birth centers to assure care is provided within health and safety standards established by rule and statute. The department enforces these standards by annually conducting surveys of the centers.\n\nProvider Information\n\nIn order to meet the life safety requirements of the regulations, contact:\n\nMr. Charles Schlegel, Director\n\nDivision of Safety Inspection\n\n2525 N 7th Street\n\nHarrisburg, PA 17110​\n\n​Phone: 717-787-1911 or visit the building safety page.\n\nArchitectural construction plans for your proposed facility must be submitted to the Division of Safety Inspection for review and approval.\n\nApplication for State Licensure"
