        "text": "Caring advocacy when medical malpractice causes your newborn harm\n\nThe dream of every parent is that their child will be born healthy. Parents want their children to live full, productive, and joyful lives. However, those dreams can be shattered in an instant when a mother and father learn that something went wrong during the delivery process. A diagnosis of cerebral palsy, kernicterus, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), or any other birth disorders is devastating.\n\nAt KBG Injury Law, our Harrisburg birth injury lawyers understand what to do when medical malpractice happens during a pregnancy, during the delivery, and after the baby is born. We work with birth injury experts who understand what steps the negligent health providers failed to take and how your child’s injuries could have been prevented. We file claims against the hospitals, obstetricians, medical practices, nurses, midwives, and others who failed to protect your newborn. We fight to ensure you and your child secure full compensation for what he or she needs to thrive for a lifetime.\n\nWhat are common types of birth injuries?\n\nMany birth injuries affect the brain or the nervous system. Brain injuries are often due to a lack of oxygen or bleeding. Brain injuries and nervous system disorders can cause disfigurement, cognitive difficulties, physical pain, immobility, paralysis, and even death. Mothers may suffer preeclampsia, blood loss, a ruptured uterus, infections, and other disorders and complications.\n\nSome of the many types of birth injuries our seasoned Harrisburg medical malpractice lawyers handle include:\n\nCerebral palsy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cerebral palsy (CP) affects a newborn’s movement, balance, and posture. “CP is caused by abnormal brain development or damage to the developing brain that affects a person’s ability to control his or her muscles.” If your child has severe CP, he/she may be unable to walk or may need assistive equipment. Children with CP may have many problems that require a lifetime of care including “intellectual disability; seizures; problems with vision, hearing, or speech; changes in the spine (such as scoliosis); or joint problems (such as contractures).”\n\nBrachial plexus injury. This birth injury occurs when the brachial plexus nerves are damaged. These nerves lie between the newborn’s shoulders and head. The network of nerves manages muscle function of the shoulders, arms, hands, and chest. During delivery, the nerves may be stretched, compressed, or torn. Erb’s palsy is a type of brachial plexus injury that can cause shoulder weakness and a loss of motion. Erb’s palsy injuries often occur if force is required to dislodge the baby. Another type of brachial plexus injury is called Klumpke’s palsy, causing paralysis of the arm. Complications include tearing of the nerves.\n\nHypoxic-ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE). Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a type of newborn brain damage caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is also called birth asphyxia, perinatal asphyxia, and neonatal encephalopathy. The HIE Help Center notes, “Once there is permanent brain damage, there is no cure for HIE. However, there are many treatments and therapies that can improve symptoms and function in children with HIE.”\n\nShoulder dystocia. This birth injury may be due to the baby becoming stuck during delivery, the size of the mother’s pelvis, the baby is late, gestational diabetes, or other reasons. Shoulder dystocia can cause brain damage and other injuries.\n\nOther types of birth injuries include facial paralysis, cortical blindness, cephalohematoma, and intracranial hemorrhage.\n\nSome of the many complications that birth doctors need to recognize include placental abruption – which can happen when the mother’s placenta prematurely detaches from the mother’s uterus – and uterine rupture.\n\nWhat are some reasons why Harrisburg birth injuries occur?\n\nAt KBG Injury Law, our Harrisburg lawyers work with a network of doctors experienced with the steps health professionals should take to anticipate, monitor, and respond to pregnancy difficulties and emergencies during the delivery. Some common reasons why medical malpractice causes birth injuries happen include:\n\nNot anticipating birth delivery complications.\n\nImproper diagnosis of a problem when it does occur.\n\nNot responding to a complication properly.\n\nFailure to continually monitor the mother and baby, especially the baby’s oxygen levels.\n\nFailure to treat infections.\n\nImproper use of forceps, vacuum extractors, and other birth tools.\n\nDelaying or not performing a Cesarean when necessary.\n\nThe HIE Help Center provides a few reasons why medical malpractice may cause HIE.\n\nFailure to properly manage a high-risk pregnancy, such as a mother who has preeclampsia or gestational diabetes.\n\nUmbilical cord complications, like compression of the umbilical cord.\n\nUterine or placental complications. The uterus and placenta provide blood for the baby. Complications include placental abruption, placenta previa, placental insufficiency, and uterine rupture.\n\nAllowing infections to spread from the mother to the baby.\n\nFailure to properly monitor the baby’s heart.\n\nFailure to prevent a premature birth.\n\nAllowing a labor to continue too long.\n\nMedication problems.\n\nFailure to properly manage a newborn’s condition.\n\nWho is liable for my child’s birth injuries?\n\nOur Harrisburg birth injury lawyers file personal injury claims when your newborn suffers a birth injury due to medical malpractice. We also file wrongful death claims if your baby tragically dies during childbirth.\n\nThe defendants who may be liable for hurting your child include:\n\nHospitals\n\nBirth delivery doctors\n\nBirth delivery nurses\n\nMidwives\n\nMedical technicians\n\nAnesthesiologists\n\nOther healthcare providers\n\nWhat damages can you seek in a Harrisburg birth injury case?\n\nDoctors, hospitals, and healthcare providers will fight hard to deny liability. You need lawyers on your side who are skilled, persistent, and persuasive. You need lawyers who aren’t afraid of the big insurance companies and challenging the reputation of Harrisburg physicians.\n\nNo amount of money can truly compensate for any permanent or catastrophic birth injury. At KBG Injury Law, we fight to obtain the strongest, most just settlement or verdict possible. The value of your child’s injury claim is based on many factors, including:\n\nAll medical bills. Newborns with catastrophic or permanent injuries often require daily lifetime care. Liable healthcare professionals should pay for all necessary surgeries, doctor visits, physical therapy, cognitive therapy, psychological therapy, assistive devices, and medications.\n\nPain and suffering. Children born with cerebral palsy, a brachial plexus injury, or any other medical disorder live with a lifetime of pain, aches, loss of bodily function, cognitive impairments, anxiety, and depression. They deserve compensation for their pain.\n\nScarring and disfigurements. Children who have a visible injury need extra help coping with their self-esteem and adjusting to how others see them.\n\nIn some cases of medical malpractice, we demand punitive damages.\n\nNormally, parents file the medical malpractice claim on behalf of their child. The settlements and verdicts are usually paid through a structured agreement to ensure medical and other related bills are paid throughout the child’s lifetime. We also handle birth injury claims on a contingency fee basis, meaning you don’t pay until we win your case.\n\nIs there a Harrisburg birth injury attorney near me?\n\nOur Harrisburg office is conveniently located on the West Shore at 717 Market Street, Lemoyne, PA.
