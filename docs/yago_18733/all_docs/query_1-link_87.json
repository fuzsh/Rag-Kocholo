        "text": "Dan Miller exclusively represents whistleblowers, nationwide, in state and federal False Claim Act cases and in cases under the IRS, SEC, and CFTC whistleblower programs.\n\nPrior to joining WMHW, Dan led one of the largest whistleblower practice groups in the United States for ten years. During this time, he was lead counsel in a series of successful cases across the country which returned hundreds of millions of dollars to various federal and state governments. Through this work, Dan earned a national reputation for successfully litigating cases that were initially declined by the government.\n\nBefore entering private practice in 2010, Dan was a Deputy Attorney General for the Delaware Department of Justice for over 16 years. He is battle-tested, having tried over 125 cases to jury verdict. During his service as a prosecutor, Dan was elected president of the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units (“NAMFCU”). While he worked with NAMFCU, Dan aggressively pursued whistleblower cases and served on numerous national teams comprised of federal and state prosecutors. Collectively, those False Claims Act cases returned more than $2.5 billion to state and federal treasuries.\n\nNow in private practice, Dan utilizes his relationships with government prosecutors, his trial experience, and his deep understanding of the whistleblower process to deliver outstanding results for his clients."
