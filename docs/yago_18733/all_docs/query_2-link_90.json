Christian's father's last name was possibly Mueller or Müller (with umlaut or two dots over the \"u\"). His mother's last name was possibly Rogers.\n\nImmigration\n\nChristian Miller Sr, probably with his wife Elizabetha, came to America from Switzerland, arriving in Philadelphia on board the ship \"Francis and Elizabeth\" which landed 21 Sep 1742 having which sailed from Rotterdam.[1] Also traveling on this voyage were the associated families of the Zugs, Yoders, and Gnaegis. (See disputed research notes below).\n\nLand\n\nChristian Miller warranted land in Penn Twp., Berks Co., PA on 15 Sep 1747 (Warrant #10).[2]\n\nDeath\n\nChristian died July 1, 1785.[3]\n\nBurial\n\nMiller Family Cemetery Lynnville, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, USA[3]\n\nChildren\n\nJohn Hannes Miller 1728–1798\n\nVeronica F.

One suggests that Christian may have come to Philadelphia on 15 Sep 1749 on the ship \"Phoenix\" from Europe, with his wife, Barbara (?nee) and believes him to be buried in Somerset county, Pennsylvania. Both memorials have his date of death as July 1, 1785, however the second memorial says that Christian and his wife, Elizabetha (?nee) came to America from Switzerland, arriving in Philadelphia, November 9, 1738 on the \"Charming Nancy\" which had sailed from Rotterdam and stopped at Cowes on the Isle of Wight. This memorial indicates that he is buried in the Miller Family Cemetery, in Lynnville, Lehigh county, Pennsylvania, and includes a grave stone photo.\n\nThese two memorials have been merged together. Corrected links to the new merged memorial and deleted old memorial ID. November 2, 2021. Sheila Tidwell\n\nIf you believe the inscription on the marker photo, then 1706 is the year of his birth (25 June).\n\nDisputed Research\n\nAlthough there were Miller's/Muellers aboard both the Charming Nancy and the Phoenix, this is a very common surname that was found on many ship lists. Also, the 11 Aug 1750 \"Patience\" voyage that is sometimes mentioned does not contain a Christian Miller, only a Daniel, which is probably the source of people giving Christian the middle name Daniel. Additionally, because his oldest 2 sons (Johannes and Nicholas) would have been over the age of 16 in 1750, they should both be listed on the manifest, but there is no Johannes on that voyage. (Although I doubt that Johannes was really born in 1723 or his father would have been about 15 at the age of his birth.)\n\nThere are 2 Christian Millers on the 1738 Charming Nancy (again, very common name), but one was age 25 and one was 26, which is a bit younger than expected.[4] There was a Christian Miller on the 1749 Phoenix, as well as a John Nicklas and a Hannes. But the Millers on that voyage seem to have been part of 3 separate groups, and each of those names are from a different group.[5]\n\nGiven that the Christian Miller on the 1742 voyage was traveling with other related Amish families (and at a time when most of the early Amish families were arriving), and the fact that he is also likely the same Christian Miller that purchased land in Penn Twp., Berks Co., PA in 1747, (part of the Northkill Amish settlement), the 1742 \"Francis & Elizabeth\" voyage seems most likely.\n\nSources\n\n↑ https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.49015000086612&seq=403\n\n↑ https://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/rg/di/r17-522WarranteeTwpMaps/r017-Map2604-Berks-PennWeb.pdf\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Find a Grave, database and images (accessed 21 February 2022), memorial page for Christian Miller Sr. (25 Jun 1706–1 Jul 1785), Find A Grave: Memorial #68781155, citing Miller Family Cemetery, Lynnville, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, USA ; Maintained by Emily Miller (contributor 47462726).\n\n↑ https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.49015000086612&seq=318\n\n↑ https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.49015000086612&seq=479\n\nAncestry Family Tree http://trees.ancestry.com/pt/AMTCitationRedir.aspx?tid=25352682&pid=1440\n\nhttp://www.themillerwebsite.com/All_Millers/rr01/rr01_002.htm#P36 This is a no longer available domain link and needs to be fixed or removed.\n\n\"Amish and Amish Mennonite Genealogies\" by Hugh F.
