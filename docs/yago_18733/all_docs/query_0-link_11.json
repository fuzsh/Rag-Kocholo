        "text": "Nathaniel Miller, distiller, was born in Washington Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, 19 November 1837. He is a son of Daniel Miller and Catherine [Snyder] Miller. His grandfather, John Miller, was born in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. He came to Dauphin County and owned and cultivated a farm in Jackson Township, where he died in the early sixties. His wife was a Miss Sauler.

He was a blacksmith, and followed that trade in connection with farming. He also conducted a distillery in Washington Township, until the time of his death, which occurred 4 July 1872.

He then spent about four months in learning the business of distilling whiskey. After his marriage he worked for two years in his father’s distillery. Then on account of the high whiskey tax the distillery was closed for four years. At the end of that time Mr. Miller rented his father’s property for three years. His father died about 1872 when he bought the distillery and has ever since conducted the business. Mr. Miller owns a farm in Washington Township, in connection with a partner.
