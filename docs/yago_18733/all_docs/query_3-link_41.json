Our certified, qualified team under the direction of our Director of Kids & Starters, Kyra Gonzalez, has great themes and lessons each month to engage kids at every level. Our Kids Room is for ages K-5 and our Starters Room is for infants to Pre-K. A Kid’s Team Member will be at the Kid’s Wing to help you check-in and get your kid settled in. Check-in starts at 8:50 am and 10:50 am every Sunday.\n\nIf you have a little one but would like to keep them during the service, we welcome all kids and babies in our Worship Center as well. Our Gathering Place is a great place to watch our YouTube live stream as a secondary option for families who might need more room to run around.\n\nWe value that our church attendees come and worship as they can and are able.\n\nWe also value raising up new leaders in our church to support and lead our Sunday morning worship experience! We encourage those who have been with us to consider serving on one of our many Sunday morning teams.\n\nThere is something for everyone’s gifting and abilities."
