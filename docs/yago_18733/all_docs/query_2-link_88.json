In 1983, he and hisparents moved to Montana and settled into a lovely house on FlatheadLake in Polson, Montana. His favorite things to do while living therewere to take the boat out around the lake, fish off the dock and ridehis dirt bike or 4-wheelers with his friends.\n\nAftergraduating high school, he went on to study at the University ofMontana then the University of Wyoming, where he received his degreein Industrial Technology Education.

He loved tocook, most times in front of his giant Traeger grill - he always saidâIf you love someone, you cook for themâ. His favorite holidaywas Halloween and their house was known to have an epic yard full oftombstones, skeletons and a graveyard fence, a lot of which he builton his own. He truly enjoyed handing out candy and ramen noodles toall kids who stopped by, especially his students.
