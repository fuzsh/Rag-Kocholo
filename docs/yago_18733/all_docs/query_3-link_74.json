        "text": "Welcome to Sacred Midwifery. I am a homebirth midwife that believes you have a right to welcome your baby into the world with gentleness and respect. As a Certified Professional Midwife, CPM,\n\nI offer family-centered continuous care during pregnancy, labor, birth, and postpartum. For low-risk women, a planned homebirth with a skilled midwife in attendance provides a supportive and safe environment to welcome your child\n\ninto the world.\n\nYour care under Sacred Midwifery will follow the Midwives Model of Care. I believe that birth is a spiritual experience and also very personal. When a woman is supported to trust her body and the natural birth process, her body instinctually knows what to do. One of the many wonderful things about birthing at home is you have the freedom to move as you need to and choose the position for labor and birth that suits you in the moment.\n\n​\n\nWoman are generally more able to relax and enjoy their birth when they are in the comfort of their own home surrounded by loved ones. You will have the advantage of knowing exactly who will attend you throughout this momentous event. I happily serve women from all walks of life and many different religious beliefs.\n\n​\n\nWith my many years of experience, I can offer advice and techniques throughout the process. We will spend time in every prenatal building a relationship of trust and respect, talking about nutrition, education, and emotional support. It is important to acknowledge the whole family in this special time of life. With my training, I will monitor the mother and baby throughout the childbearing year, and offer nutritional and herbal support.\n\nYou will have caring, hands-on care and skilled support throughout labor and birth. I will also work with the family during the postpartum time and offer any needed breastfeeding support or referral to a specialist. I offer home birth and midwifery services in a one hour radius of Harrisburg Pa. Please contact me so we can explore your needs and options to discover how to create your families ideal and Sacred Birth.\n\n​\n\nZaina Keeley, CPM, LM\n\n304-886-4974\n\nZaina7@yahoo.com​"
