I’m so thankful for the privilege to be a part of your lives. The learning for me is vast, and I’m confident it will continue to have a reverberating effect on my life and those whose lives I touch for many years to come!\n\nThis conference affirmed my path and helped to give me the confidence to walk down it. Thank you!\n\nQuality for my time and energy away from family. Worth money to come.\n\nEach session and speaker added to my understanding and development of personal philosophy.\n\nI rate everything about this conference excellent because I received valuable information, was respectfully treated by staff, etc., and the conference was well run with a loving touch.\n\nI am pleased with the new information I received. Will this be of use to my practice? YES!\n\nIt was stimulating, informative, with new research and new ideas. Really enjoyed the five days. Lots of choices and topics. It motivates all of us: new, old and burnt out midwives."
