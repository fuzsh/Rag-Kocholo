Degree in Special and Elementary Education, and in 1979 with a Master’s Degree from The Johns Hopkins University in Communicative Disorders. She taught for several years in Pennsylvania public schools.\n\nMarilyn’s primary passion in life was caring for her children and grandchildren.

Born in Elmira, New York on December 3, 1964 to Robert and Dolores Beecher, the family moved to the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania area where Jane graduated from Central Dauphin High School in 1983 and started on the path of becoming a true angel and hero in today’s sense by pursuing a career in nursing.\n\nThroughout her career, Jane worked in all areas of the nursing field, including working at the local hospital, in Doctor’s offices, with assisted living facilities, and with home healthcare. Her final job was a thankless job that entailed the review and processing medical claims. And while there were times when she would complain about the work, it would never stop her from furthering her education, which resulted in her obtaining several certifications and a Master’s of Science for Nursing Degree.\n\nThroughout her career as a nurse, Jane touched many lives; however, it was her love for nature and animals that really caught this author’s attention. Jane would scream for me to stop the car because she saw what she thought was a blurry image of a moose walking through the woods in the Green Mountains in Vermont. I could not get the car stopped fast enough and she was out with her camera. When people would pull up beside and ask what was going on, and I would tell them, instant traffic jam for a shadow. She even made me turn around and drive back 10 miles so she could get a picture of the ever-elusive moose while driving between Yellowstone and Rocky Mountains National Parks.\n\nHowever, what really made Jane stand out was her love for water. While she would be the first person to say that she was more like a corgi, with its little short legs and sometime the same length in temperament. If there was a body of water around, Jane had to put her feet into it, or at least touch it. Since our time together, Jane has seen the ponies of Assateague Island and has eaten fresh lobster in Maine, all while playing in the ocean at both locations. She has also dipped her feet into four of the five Great Lakes, finding out just how cold Lake Superior really is, even in the summer, and stood in the great Mississippi River. Our final trip together was out to the Pacific Ocean where Jane got to experience the San Francisco Bay as well as sandy beaches of Carmel by the Sea before heading east into the majestic Yosemite National Park.\n\nAnd while Jane Susan Beecher may be the newest Angel Amongst the Stars, I will never be able to approach a body of water again without hearing her laughing, screaming with delight, and seeing her footsteps running off into the water. Jane, I always have and always will love you. You will always be in my heart and we will be together again. Jane has touched the lives of many throughout her short time with us that if we measured the love from family and friends that she is leaving the same way as we do precious metals, Jane would own the world, animals would roam free and be healthy, and a penguin would be the world’s mascot. To add to the distant relatives and close friends, Jane is survived by her husband, David Taylor; her two sons Joshua and Nathaniel Wilson; two step-step sons Christopher and Phillip Taylor; a daughter-in-law, Kelly Pyott; two siblings, Jay Beecher and Jill Willsey; a bonus daughter Ashley Mader, and the closest thing that she would ever have to grandchildren, a bunch of fur babies.\n\nEtta May Kapp, Class of 1956, passed away on September 2, 2022 at her home in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nMartin G.
