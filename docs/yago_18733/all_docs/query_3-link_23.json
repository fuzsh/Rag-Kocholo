        "text": "Harrisburg’s first baby of 2024, and its last baby of 2023, both arrived safe and healthy – although their timing came as a bit of a shock to both sets of parents.\n\nThe UPMC Magee-Women’s branch at UPMC’s downtown Harrisburg hospital welcomed Kambrie Fowler, daughter of Angel and Andrew Fowler of Enola, at 7:59 p.m. on Dec. 31. Less than ten hours later, Danielle Grace Hritz, daughter of Kari and Michael Hritz of Mechanicsburg, arrived at 5:43 a.m. on Jan. 1.\n\nKari had gone to bed early; Michael had stayed up to see the new year, and both were anticipating Kari’s C-section that was scheduled for Jan. 2. But their daughter had other plans.\n\n“A little after midnight, I started having contractions. He was on the couch and I was like ‘I think we gotta go,’” Kari said.\n\nThe Hritz’s first child, David, had been born by C-section – an event that went exactly as planned, Kari said.\n\n“This one was a trip, because I was not sure what I was feeling,” she said, and thought that the sensation might be Braxton-Hicks contractions, false labor pains.\n\n“We still thought they might even send us back home,” Michael said. “They came in and said ‘the doctor said let’s go ahead,’ then it became real that she might be the first [of the new year].”\n\nThe Fowlers also did not expect to be in the maternity ward at the dawn of a new year.\n\n“I didn’t want a New Year’s [birth],” Angel said, and ultimately ended up with a New Year’s Eve baby – which may come with less renown, but is more advantageous for tax purposes.\n\nKambrie wasn’t supposed to arrive for another two weeks. They came to the hospital after Angel started experiencing contractions, but they weren’t developing further – until suddenly, they did.\n\n“At 2:30 we were expecting to be going back home, and they were saying they were going to keep us for an hour to monitor her – and then her water broke within a half an hour,” Andrew said.\n\nRegardless of the timing, “I’m just happy that she’s here healthy,” he added.\n\nThe new year started out strong on the reproductive front, according to local hospitals. WellSpan York Hospital welcomed Grayson Hayes Zornes, son of mother Casey Zornes, as 12:02 a.m., and saw two more babies born in the first hour of the new year, according to WellSpan.\n\nUPMC’s hospitals in Hanover and Carlisle each welcomed a baby in the early morning hours prior to the Hritz’s birth, according to the health system."
