        "text": "MILLER Family History, Part II\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nJohn Peter MILLER (~1714-1794)\n\n11A. John Peter Miller was born on January 19, 1713-1715, in Kaiserslautern, Rheinland, Preussen (Preußen), Germany. He immigrated to America in 1727 as a teenager. He married Elizabeth Warren in 1752 in Maryland and had at least 11 children as recorded in his will:\n\n11AA. Mary Miller 1753 (1822) (69) 11AB. Daniel Miller (<1758) -- -- 11AC. John Miller (1758) -- -- 11AD. Elizabeth Miller (1758) -- -- 11AE. Catherine Miller (<1759) -- -- 11AF. Susannah Miller 1766 1834 (68) 11AG. David Miller (1773-1778) -- -- 11AH. Ludwick Miller (1774-1778) -- -- 11AI. Michael Miller (<1790) (<1799) --\n\nIn 1745, Peter (and/or his father, Michael) bought a 150-acre parcel of land called \"Ash Swamp,\" then located in Prince George's County, Maryland, (later under Frederick County and now part of Washington County) from John George Arnold.\n\nIn 1752 this land was added to and resurveyed by his younger brother Philip Jacob Miller on the authority of Lodowich Miller, another younger brother.\n\nIn December 1783, and about four years after his father's death, brother Lodowich, who had earlier moved southeast of Hagerstown, conveyed 220 acres of \"Ash Swamp\" to brother Philip Jacob for 5 shillings. Philip Jacob turned around and conveyed 144 acres to Peter, again for 5 shillings \"and brotherly affection.\" This plot is said to have had a small cemetery on it which is no longer in existence.\n\nJohn Peter Miller died in Washington County about December 1794 at about the age of 80. He made his last will and testiment on December 13, 1794 and named eldest son Daniel and his daughter Catherine's husband, John Fisher, as his executors. The will was probated on December 26, 1794. (Washington County Will Records, book A, pages 318-319)\n\nAs no wife (or wives) was named, she is presumed to have died before 1794.\n\nPeter named 11 children in his will. The last three sons, Ludwick, David and Michael, being under the age of 21. On April 6, 1795, the executors of Peter's estate sold the \"Ash Swamp\" land, 143½ acres, to John Schnebly (Deed book I, page 584). On September 25, 1795, John Schnebly, also bought adjoining \"Ash Swamp\" land from Philip Jacob Miller (deed book I, page 360). Philip Jacob Miller, then moved to Kentucky.\n\nOn April 9, 1799, the executors of Peter's estate made distribution of 2,070 pounds in equal parts, to his 10 remaining children (Book I, page 80), all apparently now 21. The order of the named heirs is basically the same as in the will. Michael, the last named in the will, is missing in the distribution list.\n\nHans Jeremiah MILLER (~1717-1781)\n\n11C. Hans Jeremiah Miller was born about 1717, likely in Rheinland, Preussen (Preußen), Germany. He immigrated to America in 1727. He married Magdalena about 1742 in Hagerstown, then in Frederick County, now in Washington County, Maryland. They had at least four children:\n\n11C1. John Miller (1743) -- -- 11C2. Abraham Miller (1745) -- -- 11C3. Susanna Miller (1747) -- -- 11C4. Elizabeth Miller (1749) -- --\n\nHans Jeremiah Miller died in 1781 in Hagerstown, Maryland. He was about 64 years old.\n\nHans Michael MILLER (~1720-1784)\n\n11E. Hans Michael Miller was born about 1720 in Darmstadt, Hesse (Hessen), Germany. He immigrated with his family as a boy in 1727. He married Elizabeth Brumbaugh about 1748 and had as many as eight children:\n\n11E1. John Miller (1749) 1821 (72) 11E2. Christina Susanna Miller 1750 (1820-1825) (73) 11E3. Rebecca Miller (1751) -- -- 11E4. Hannah Miller (1753) -- -- 11E5. Mary Ann Miller (1755) -- -- 11E6. Susannah Miller (1757) -- -- 11E7. Michael Miller (1759) -- -- 11E8. Daniel Miller (1761) -- --\n\nHans Michael owned land in Franklin County, Pennsylvania; Frederick County, Maryland (present-day Washington County); and Hampshire County, Virginia (present-day Mineral County, West Virginia).\n\nAfter Hans Michael's death in 1784, Elizabeth moved to a farm on the Conococheague, near Williamsport, Maryland with her eldest son John.\n\nElizabeth (Brumbaugh) Miller died about 1798 in Washington County at about the age of 71. She willed part of her estate to her \"society\" at the Beaver Creek Church of the Brethren.\n\nGeorge MILLER (Sr.) (~1722-~1798)\n\n11F. George Miller (Sr.) was born in 1722 in Germany. He immigrated to the American colonies in 1727 as a child. He grew up in Pennsylvania and married Catherine about 1747. They had as many as 10 children:\n\n11FA. Abraham Miller (1748) -- -- 11FB. George Miller (Jr.) (1750) -- -- 11FC. Barbara Miller (1752) -- -- 11FD. Eve Miller (1754) -- -- 11FE. Elizabeth Miller (1756) -- -- 11FF. Catherine Miller (1758) -- -- 11FG. Marie Miller (1760) -- -- 11FH. Magdalena Miller (1762) -- -- 11FI. Fannie Miller (1764) -- -- 11FJ. Henry Miller (1766) -- --\n\nElder George was said to be the first preacher at the Big Swatara Church of the Brethren in Swatara Township near Harrisburg, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.\n\nHe died about 1796-1798 in Lancaster, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. He was about about 75 years old.\n\n\"George Miller (1722-1798) was born in Switzerland and immigrated to America in his youth. He settled in Lancaster Co., PA, and joined the Brethren in 1753. He was one of the ministers at Big Swatara, PA. He was the father of ten children: Abraham (Mifflin Co., PA), George (Erie Co., PA), Henry (m. Elizabeth Klein, granddaughter of Elder George Klein), Barbara (m. Jacob Smith), Eve (m. Daniel Keefer), Elizabeth (m Valentine Balsbaugh), Catharine (m. George Minnich), Maria (m. George Fackler), Magdalena (m. Abraham Snyder), and Fanny. All of these families except George Jr.'s remained Brethren.\"\n\nLodowich \"Lewis\" MILLERΔ (~1724-~1792)\n\n11G. Lodowich \"Lewis\" MillerΔ was born about 1724 in Germany. He immigrated to the American colonies in 1727, first settling with his parents in Pennsylvania and later in present-day Washington County, Maryland. He married Anna Barbara Meyer, originally of Lancaster, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, about 1741 in Frederick County, Maryland, (likely the present-day portion of Washington County) and had 11 children:\n\n11GA. Jacob Miller 2 Oct 1748 11 Jul 1815 (66) 11GB. Ludowich Miller (Jr.) 1749 -- -- 11GC. Abraham Miller 1750 1830 (80) 11GD. David MillerΔ (1751) 1828 (77) 11GE.

Frances Miller (1760) 1838 (78)\n\nAfter Lodowich's marriage he likely lived on the family estate known as \"Ash Swamp\" north of Hagerstown. He purchased an adjacent, 150-acre plot to the south and just east of the Salem Reformed Church in 1751 known as \"Tom's Chance.\" In 1752, he and two of his brothers resurveyed (and partitioned) \"Ash Swamp\".\n\nIn 1754 he purchased land from Walter Funderburg near Beaver Creek, east of Hagerstown and sold \"Tom's Chance\" to Peter Tysher the following year in 1755, thus signaling a move away from his parents and siblings.\n\nThere is some evidence that he moved his family from place to place during the perilous days of the French and Indian War (1754-1763). It is recorded that at the time of the birth of Daniel (1752), he was living in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, and land records further state that in 1763 and 1767 he was living in York County, Pennsylvania. Most of the other deeds state that he was living in Frederick County, Maryland, perhaps \"Chestnut Level,\" located near Woodsboro, north of Frederick in Frederick County, or his farm at Beaver Creek in what is today Washington County, Maryland.\n\nOne land record states that he was a weaver.\n\nLodowich sold his remaining 220 acres of \"Ash Swamp\" to younger brother Philip Jacob on December 9, 1783, for 5 shillings. Philip Jacob turned around and conveyed 144 acres of the plot to his eldest brother Peter later that same month for 5 shillings \"and brotherly affection.\"\n\nLodowich appears to have later moved to Taneytown, further north of Frederick and Woodsboro, in Caroll County, during his later years as it is recorded that he died in Taneytown, Maryland, in 1792. He was about 78 years old.\n\nAnna Barbara (Meyer) Miller also died in 1792. She was about 57 years old.\n\n\"Michael Miller's son Lodowich is believed to be the father of Jacob (b. 1748), Abraham (b. 1750), Daniel (b. 1752), Susanna Wine (b. 1754), Nancy Sanger (b. 1756), and David (b. 1760). These children settled in Virginia in 1783 and are believed to be the ancestors of the Brethren Millers in that state. His daughter Barbara is believed to have been the wife of Elder John H. Garber, who moved to Virginia ca. 1775, establishing the Brethren settlement there.\"\n\nAt least half of Lodowich's children moved into the Shenandoah Valley (Shenandoah, Rockingham, and Augusta counties) of Virginia beginning around 1783 at the end of the American Revolutionary War.\n\nPhilip Jacob MILLER3 (1726-1799)\n\n11H. Philip Jacob Miller3 was born in 1726 in Rheinland, Preussen (Preußen), Germany. He immigrated the following year to the American colonies and grew up in Pennsylvania. He married Magdalena Rochette Maucher/Maugans, a native of former Frederick County, Maryland, in Pennsylvania in 1751 and fathered as many as 13 children:\n\n11HA.

Hannah Miller 7 Jun 1774 22 Aug 1840 (66)\n\nThe Millers owned land north of Hagerstown, then in Frederick County, now Washington County, from 1745. He and two elder brothers resurveyed their father's land known as \"Ash Swamp\" in 1752. In December 1783 he acquired his brother Lodowich's 220 acres for 5 shillings and turned around and sold 144 acres to his eldest brother Peter for 5 shillings \"and brotherly affection.\"\n\nIn the 1780s, after the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War, eldest sons Daniel4 and David4 moved northwest into the Appalachian Mountains of western Pennsylvania, to the Brethren congregation at Morrison's Cove, Woodbury Township, Bedford County. Daughter Susannah and the Ulrich/Ulery family moved deeper to Cambria County in the Allegheny Mountains.\n\nOhio River Valley\n\nFollowing eldest brother Peter's death in December 1794, Peter's estate sold off the 143½ acres to John Schnebly in 1795 and Philip turned around and also sold the rest of his \"Ash Swamp\" property to John Schnebly. The Northwest Indian War (1785â1795) in Ohio, Indiana, and southern Michigan, concluded with a decisive American victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers (August 1794) and the Treaty of Greenville (August 1795) and redrew the border with the Western Confederacy of Indian tribes, pushing them north from the Ohio River to open up lands in southern and eastern Ohio for American settlement. It was with this backdrop that the Millers moved to Campbell County, Kentucky, opposite Cincinnati, Ohio, to the northwest, along with several of his grown children.\n\nSons Daniel4 and David4 became charter members of the O'Bannon Creek Church, the first German Baptist Brethren congregation in Ohio, founded in 1795 with Daniel as its first minister. Daniel and David purchased land in Goshen Township in 1801.\n\nPhilip acquired 2,000 acres north of the Ohio River in the late 1790s in lands gained from the Shawnee during the Northwest Indian War. This land lie north of O'Bannon Creek in northern Goshen Township, Clermont County, and Hamilton Township, Warren County.\n\nPhilip Jacob Miller died in Campbell County, Kentucky, in August or September 1799. He was about 73 years old.\n\nAfter Philip\n\nOhio land magnate William Lytle (1770-1813) obtained a patent from the United States government on May 2, 1803, which included the lands that Philip had acquired. Philip's sons, David4 and Abraham, as administrators of his estate, purchased the lands from Lytle later that year. They purchased 1,800 acres and an adjacent lot of 200 acres for a total of $2,200.[Deed 1803] These tracts conform to Virginia Military Reserve Survey tracts 3790 and 3791 in the southeast corner of Hamilton Township, Warren County, and with about 162 acres crossing over into Goshen Township, Clermont County. They are roughly bounded in the north by the community of Comargo, on the east by Cozaddale and Stony Run, and encompassing the communtiy of Dallasburg in the southwest.\n\nPhilip's children made an agreement among themselves to divide this land into ten 200-acre lots of 163-1/3 by 196 poles (~2,695 by 3,234 feet). Daughter Magdalena Cripe decided to take her share in cash. The children designated John Ramsey and Theophilus Simonton to appraise the lots and stipulate compensation between the varying values of the lots,[Agree 1799] whereupon the children drew lots for the parcels and David4 and Abraham, as estate administrators, began deeding each in April 1805 for the nominal sum of $1.Deed 1805 Arbitrarily numbering the lots from the northwest to southeast, we find the following among the ten surviving children and one widower son-in-law:\n\n1 - Northernmost 200 acres adjacent to the 1,800 survey; estate sold to Francis Eltzroth for $200, 22 Sep 1809; quit claim from the heirs of Daniel Miller4 to Benjamin Eltzroth (son of Francis and grandson-in-law to Philip Jacob) for $500, 7 May 1828; the town of Comargo lies in the northeast corner\n\n2 - Northwest 200 acres; estate sold to Gabriel [& Esther] Morgan for $1, 22 Apr 1805; Gabriel had purchased an adjacent 200-acres lot from Richard & Mary Cunningham two months earlier\n\n3 - North-central 200 acres; estate sold to John [& Mary] Creamer for $1, 22 Apr 1805\n\n4 - Northeast 200 acres; estate sold to Henry [& Christina] Snell for $1, 22 Sep 1809; the town of Cozaddale lies along the southeastern boundary\n\n5 - West-central 200 acres; estate sold to Arnold [& Hannah] Snider for $1, 22 Apr 1805\n\n6 - Central 200 acres; estate sold to Daniel [& Susannah] Ullery for $1, 22 Sep 1809\n\n7 - East-central 200 acres; Abraham sold his lot to William Spence for $400, 22 Apr 1805\n\n8 - Southwest 200 acres; estate sold southern half (100 acres) to Jacob Wise for $200, 6 Dec 1806; and northern half (100 acres) to Jacob Creamer, perhaps a brother of John Creamer, for $200, 16 Jan 1807; the western half of the town of Dallasburg lies in this tract\n\n9 - South-central 200 acres; estate sold to Andrew [widower of Sarah] Nifong for $1, 22 Sep 1809; the eastern half of the town of Dallasburg lies in this tract\n\n10 - Southeast 200 acres straddling the Warren-Clermont county line; estate sold to Gabriel [& Esther] Morgan for $1, 22 Apr 1805\n\nLots 8, and either 2 or 10, may have been designated for David or Elizabeth, whose names do not appear among the deeds. On the other hand, Esther and Gabriel Morgan somehow managed to acquire both lots 2 and 10.\n\nOnly the families of four Miller daughters, Christina Snell, Esther Morgan, Mary Creamer, and Hannah (Snider) Shepley, ever lived on their land in Hamilton Township, Warren County. An 1867 map of the area shows Snells, Cramers, and Eltzroths still living in the area.\n\nMagdalena (Rochette) Miller reportedly died in in Campbell County nine years after Philip in 1808.\n\nFollowing Philip Jacob's and Magdalena's deaths, a few Miller children remained in Warren and Clermont counties, while others moved north to more fertile lands in Montgomery and Preble counties. Daughters Susannah (Snider) and Magdalena Cripe migrated into northern Indiana, settling in Elhkart County.\n\nJohannes Michael MILLER (III) (1728-1792)\n\n11I. Johannes Michael Miller (III) was born about 1728, reportedly in either Grötzingen, Karlsruth, Württemberg, Germany, or in southeastern Pennsylvania. He married Elizabeth, a German immigrant, about 1749 and had as many as seven children:\n\n11I1. Johannes Miller (1752) (<1792) (<64) 11I2. Elizabeth Miller (1754-1755) Dec 1838 (84) 11I3.

The family moved to Frederick County, Maryland, by 1757, where Michael's father reportedly gave him \"Blindman's Choice,\" a 50-acre tract that spans the state line between Carroll County, Maryland, and Germany Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania. This general area runs roughly from Alloway Creek to the west for about 5 miles to the Littlestown-Baltimore Pike (Highway 97) to the east.\n\nSons Christian and Adam may have settled in Colerain Township in central Bedford County, Pennsylvania by 1776.[Tax 1776] Sons Henry and Adam ultimately settled in Napier Township, Bedford County; and daughter Margaret (Miller) Bower and son Michael settled in Adams County.\n\nJohannes Michael Miller (III) died before October 1792. He was about 64 years old.\n\nBarbara (MILLER) GARBER (1733-1808)\n\n11K. Barbara Miller was born in 1733, likely in Pennsylvania. She married Johannes \"John\" Hans Garber in 1752 in York County, Pennsylvania. They had 10 children:\n\n11KA. Samuel Garber (1756) 1814 (58) 11KB. John H. Garber 1758 1819 (61) 11KC.

Magdalene Garber 1774 26 Jul 1832 (58)\n\nInterestingly, about a year after their marriage, Barbara's widower father Johann Michael and John's widowed mother Elizabeth wed, technically making Barbara and John stepsister and stepbrother.\n\nJohann Hans worked as a farmer, shoemaker, and minister of the German Reform Brethren.\n\nBased on the childrens' birth places, the Garbers lived in York County, Pennsylvania, into the early-mid-1760s. By about 1768 they moved into Washington County, Maryland (then part of Frederick County), and about 1775 into Shenandoah County, Virginia (then part of Rockingham County).\n\nJohn Garber died in 1787 in Forestville, Shenandoah County, Virginia. He was about 70 years old.\n\nBarbara (Miller) Garber died in 1808 in Flat Rock (perhaps referring to the area of Flat Rock Church near Forestville), Shenandoah County, Virginia. She was about 75 years old.\n\nJacob MILLER (Sr.) (1735-1815)\n\n11M. Jacob Miller (Sr.) was born about 1735, in modern-day Franklin County (then part of Lancaster County), Pennsylvania. He is held by many to be a son of Michael and Susanna (Berchtol) Miller, although he is not specifically mentioned to be in the \"Brethren Encyclopedia.\" He reportedly first married Barbara Brower in 1761 but she died soon thereafter. He married a woman named Mary or Elizabeth of the Franklin County area and as many as 12 children. Elizabeth died in 1801 and Jacob remarried to Barbara Lybrook the same year.\n\n11MA.

David Miller 10 Feb 1788 1849 (61)\n\nMaryland and Pennsylvania\n\nElder Jacob Miller reportedly was ordained by William Stover in 1762 at the Antietam congregation in Washington County, Maryland. He started his family in Peters Township, Washington County, (Maryland ). The Millers then moved north to Stony Creek congregation in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, and at some point to Pipe Creek congregation (perhaps in Carroll County, Maryland).[COBNet]In 1764, Jacob split from the Brethren with Elder George Adam Martin, a Brethren Radical Pietist, and moved to Brothers Valley, Somerset County, Pennsylvania. Jacob returned to the fold in 1766, joining the congregation at Monocacy.[COBNet]\n\nSouthwest Virginia\n\nBy 1773, the Millers moved south \"on the Blue Ridge\" to establish the Blackwater River congregation in Franklin County (then part of Bedford County until 1785), southwest of Roanoke, Virginia.[COBNet] He extended his ministry southwest into Floyd County preaching in Pleasant Valley, Topeco, Beaver Creek, and Burk's Fork congregations, becoming one of the first Brethren ministers in southern Virginia. \"William Smith, an English pacifist baptized by Miller, traveled and preached in English alongside the German-speaking Miller. They were instrumental in building such a following that the 1797 Annual Meeting was held in Franklin County, Virginia.\"\n\nSouthwest Ohio\n\nThe Millers stayed in Franklin County until around 1800 when, reportedly weary of the slavery around them, they struck northwest over the Appalachians and followed the Kanawha Trace across West Virginia to the Ohio River and onward to Bear Creek (Montgomery County), Ohio, near Dayton, where Jacob is recalled as the first Brethren minister of the Miami Valley.\n\nMary Elizabeth Miller died in 1801, presumably in Montgomery County, Ohio. She was about 64 years old.\n\nJacob remarried on February 2, 1802, to Barbara Lybrook, who is believed to be the much elder sister of Philip Lybrook, who in turn was Jacob's son-in-law by marriage to Jacob's daughter Anna.\n\nBy 1804, the Millers were identified as residents of German Township, but also owned land to the northeast in Township 3, Range 5 East (Jefferson Township) that lie along the west bank of the Great Miami River and Bear Creek (Sections 34-36) about a mile north of Miamisburg, and property further north to the south of the town of Drexel (Section 11).[Land 1804-1813]\n\nElder Jacob Miller headed up the Miami Church (later Lower Miami Church) in Montgomery County in 1805 and helped \"organize the Miller-Bowman congregations of southern Ohio: Lower Miami, Lower Stillwater, Bear Creek, and Wolf Creek.

He was about 80 years old.\n\nAfter Jacob's death, Barbara moved in with Philip Lybrook, Sr., at the Four Mile settlement just across the Indiana border in Union County. Philip is believed to be Barbara's much younger brother who married Jacob's daughter Anna.\n\nBarbara (Lybrook) Miller died about 1822 while in her 80s.\n\n1. \"Miller, Jacob, 1735?-1815, minister. Born of unknown Swiss-German parents in what became Franklin Co., PA, Miller may have been ordained by William STOVER in the Antietam congregation in 1762. He is said to have lived in the Stony Creek congregation, Somerset Co., PA, and in the Pipe Creek, MD, congregation. The mother of some of Miller's twelve children may have been named Mary. At his death, Miller was married to a Barbara B. Miller.\"\n\n\"Sometime before 1775, he moved to Bedford (later Franklin Co.) Co., VA, to the Blackwater River German settlement, where he established the Franklin County congregation. Pleasant Valley, Topeco, Beaver Creek, and Burk's Ford congregations in Floyd Co., VA are outgrowths of his preaching and organizing. William Smith, an English pacifist baptized by Miller, traveled and preached in English alongside the German-speaking Miller. They were instrumental in building such a following that the 1797 Annual Meeting was held in Franklin Co., VA. At this meeting, Brethren were forbidden to own slaves.\"\n\n\"Due to the slavery about him or the lure of rich \"Congress lands\" in Ohio, Miller moved his family to the Miami Valley ca. 1800. He left beind in Giles Co., VA, one son, who was the progenitor of the Virginia branch of the family. Jacob Miller settled near Dayton, OH, where he organized the Miller-Bowman congregations of southern Ohio: Lower Miami, Lower Stillwater, Bear Creek, and Wolf Creek. He also founded the Four Mile Run, IN, congregation. Buried near the future site of the Lower Miami meetinghouse, he is remembered as the first Brethren minister in the Miami Valley and Indiana and one of the first in Ohio and in southern Virginia.\"\n\n2. \"Jacob Miller (1735-1815) was born in Franklin Co., PA; he migrated first to Virginia, then on to Ohio. His twelve children were all active Brethren with five of his sons serving as ministers. Anna (b. 176[5]) married Philip Lybrook and moved to Indiana. Mary (b. 1766) married Samuel Darst and moved to Montgomery Co., OH, in 1803. John (b. 1769) married Pheobe McClure and settled in Franklin Co., IN, in 1805. Jacob (m. Sarah Chapman) remained in Virginia. Tobias (b. 1773) married Sarah Henderson, moved to Union Co., IN, in 1810 and on to LaPorte Co., IN, in 1831. Abraham (b. 1775) and his wife, Nancy Huston, settled in Preble Co., OH, in 1805, then moved to Franklin Co., IN. Samuel died young in Virginia. Daniel (m. Elizabeth Shideler) moved first to Montgomery Co., OH, then on to Indiana. Isaac (m. Hannah Webb) migrated to Greene Co., OH, in 1803 and was killed in the War of 1812. Aaron (b. 1785) and David, both ministers, married sisters Elizabeth and Sarah Hardman. They organized the Nettle Creek, IN, congregation and later moved to St. Joseph Co., IN. The descendants of Elder Jacob Miller number in the thousands and their service to the Brethren churches is inestimable.\""
