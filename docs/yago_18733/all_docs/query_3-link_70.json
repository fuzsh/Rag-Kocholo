        "text": "By tradition the coat of arms of a bishop is joined with those of the diocese. On the left, the coat of arms of the Diocese of Harrisburg is based on the arms of the Penn family and the Harris family for whom the city of Harrisburg is named. The shield, divided by a Latin cross a symbol of the Catholic Faith, bears a shamrock to honor Saint Patrick, the principal patron of the diocese.\n\nThe black chief (upper partition) displays two silver roundels derived from the arms of William Penn, the English Quaker and founder of Pennsylvania. William Penn bore as arms a silver shield, thereon a black fess (horizontal band) charged with three silver roundels. The crescent from the arms of one of the branches of the Harris family represents John Harris, who emigrated to America from Yorkshire, England, and in 1712 settled Harris’ Ferry, now known as Harrisburg. The crescent is also the revered lunar symbol of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nFor his personal coat of arms, Bishop Dattilo has chosen symbols rich in religious and historical background and significance. The main charge, the tongues of fire, represents the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life, and the source of every good deed. The gold crosses on the upper part of the shield are taken from the arms of the Diocese of Pittsburgh of which Bishop Dattilo is a native.\n\nRed represents fire and commemorates the coming of the Holy Spirit. Gold is the emblem of the sun, and of divinity.\n\nThe motto, taken from 1 Peter 3:8-11, reflects Bishop Dattilo’s conviction that the Christian message achieves its most powerful expression when people “LOVE LIFE AND DO GOOD.”\n\nThe single-traversed gold processional cross behind the shield is a sign of episcopal rank. It is the one emblem in ecclesiastical heraldry that is reserved to bishops."
