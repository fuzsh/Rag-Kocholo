        "text": "For other people with the same name, see Daniel Miller.\n\nAmerican politician and public servant\n\nDaniel C. Miller (born August 10, 1956) is a politician and public servant from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He is current Harrisburg City Treasurer, and previously was the Harrisburg City Controller and was a member of the Harrisburg City Council. The latter two positions were elected at large.[1] Miller is Harrisburg's first openly gay city councillor.[2]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nMiller is a long-time resident of Harrisburg and is the founding partner of a successful CPA firm in the city. He is a graduate of Central Dauphin High School and Harrisburg Area Community College. He has earned a BA in accounting from Elizabethtown College and an MBA in finance from the Pennsylvania State University.[3] He has served on the community advisory board of WITF public television, as a volunteer with the Central PA Literacy Council, and a member of the Harrisburg City Business Revolving Loan Committee. He is a founder of the GLBT Business Association in Harrisburg, now known as the Central Pennsylvania Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.[3]\n\nIn 1990 Miller made local headlines for LGBT activism after gay bashings. Following this exposure, he was being fired for being gay in October 1990 by Donald DeMuth, who ran a consulting firm. Years later the firing was upheld in court, making Miller a poster child for gay activism in Harrisburg.[4][5] Miller more recently received open hate by former Mayor Linda D. Thompson while working for the City, as she was reported referring to him as \"that homosexual, evil little man,\" causing staffers to resign.[6][7]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nMayor of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania\n\nBurton, William (15 June 2020).
