        "text": "Daniel Loren Miller, 91, of Ashton, IL passed away on July 15, 2024 at Franklin Grove Nursing Home. He was born on February 10, 1933 in the farmhouse owned by his grandfather L.B. Miller in Reynolds Township. Dan married Jean Fisk on September 16, 1954 while still in the Army. After leaving the service, Dan farmed with his father until 1960, at which time he rented farmland. He and Jean continued to farm rented farmland, and the 120 acres that he owned, which was land his great grandfather Daniel C. Miller bought in 1865 and 1872. Throughout his farming years, he collected and worked on antique John Deere tractors, and at one time, he had as many as 24. During those early years he loved to trap shoot, and later on was in a bowling league, and loved to fish, with several trips to Canada. Then there was playing euchre, listening to the Cubs while in the field, and dancing to a Polka when he had the chance. He was an animal lover, and we always had a cat or dog. Post retirement also included going out for Sunday morning breakfast and a daily trip to Casey’s to purchase lottery scratch off tickets. He was always willing to help anyone who needed it, and would give you the shirt off his back. He will be greatly missed by all.\n\nDan is survived by a son, Gary (Kathy) Miller; Daughter, Nancy Miller; A daughter-in-law, Susie (Neil) Miller; Grandchildren, Barry (Amanda) miller and great-grandson, Wyatt; Justin (Jenni McCoy) Miller; Michael (Sarah) Demrow and great-granddaughter, Amelia, and great-grandson, Benjamin; Michelle (Mike) Mottonen and great-grandson, Ethan; Jason (April) Miller and great-granddaughter, Delainey; Daniel Miller; And special friend, Nora.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents Clarence “Shy” and Carmen (Lamb) Miller; His wife, Jean Miller; His son, Neil Miller; His in-laws, Peg and Loy Fisk; Brother and sister-in-law, Warren and Jan Fisk; And his sister, Rose Larsen.\n\nA visitation will be held on Sunday, July 21, 2024 from 4:00 – 7:00 P.M. at Beverage-Lyons Family Funeral Home, 601 Richardson Ave, Ashton, IL 61006. A funeral service will be held next day, Monday, July 22, 2024 at 10:00 A.M. at the funeral home with a graveside service to follow out to Steward Cemetery in Steward, IL.
