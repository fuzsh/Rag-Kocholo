        "text": "Hi, I’m Andrea from Taiwan! I am a senior studying Marketing. I enjoy traveling, meeting new people, experimenting with new recipes, and working out in my free time! A fun fact about me is that instead of having a sweet tooth, I have a sour tooth!\n\nHi! My name is Jonathan. I am from Singapore, and that has contributed to my love for good food.

Can’t wait to meet you!\n\nHello. My name is An Nguyen and I'm currently an undergraduate in Biomedical Engineering at Penn State Harrisburg. My home country is Vietnam. I was raised with a diverse culture and millenniums of heroic history. Moreover, Vietnam has great food and great coffee. I love learning new things, especially stories through books, people, and experiences. I have quite a hectic lifestyle, but enjoy peaceful times when I spend hours patiently baking, making good coffee and enjoying it with a good book or a beautiful landscape..... when life is not always about values or meanings, it is just us living.\n\nHello! I'm Aayushi Shah, from India—where the food is spicy, and the landscapes are as diverse as my Spotify playlists. As a graduate student, I'm currently wrestling with the world of computer science, eyeing that finish line in December 2025. When I'm not speaking in code or dreaming in algorithms, you'll find me trekking, performing in theater, diving into books, and refining my coffee brewing techniques.\n\nHello! My name is Ajayda Williams. I’m from Jamaica and currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Accounting.

One of my dreams was to study abroad and here I am a first-year student studying business, hoping to major in finance. I love to try new experiences and learn more about new things. I love to dance a lot and I used to do ballet when I was young. I love to take walks just to see nature and to clear my head. I love to travel and learn about cultures and places. I love to help others and leave a little nice touch to their day.\n\nHello, I'm Mohamed! I’m currently in my junior year, majoring in pre-med with a deep fascination for neuroscience, a field that just blows my mind with its endless mysteries and intersections with many different fields. When I'm not buried in textbooks or lab reports, you'll catch me out playing soccer or basketball, living for that adrenaline rush and team spirit. Balancing the life of an aspiring medical student with my love for sports, I guess you could say I'm aiming for that perfect blend of work and life balance, making every moment count. Kicking off my college career, I faced quite a few hurdles in chasing this goal, but those challenges taught me valuable lessons. That's exactly why I'm aiming to be a mentor to help guide other students through this journey, sharing insights and strategies to best adapt and thrive in this new environment\n\nHello, my name is Cassie and I'm an undergraduate marketing student. I'm currently a third-year student. I was born and raised in the United States, but I spent the fall of 2023 living in Spain. Outside of school, I enjoy spending time outdoors, reading, and playing tennis. I also love to travel and visit new places.\"\n\nHello! My name is Shruthi. I'm from India and I'm currently a first-year graduate student pursuing Applied behavior analysis. I love pani puri and summer's my favorite time of the year since I enjoy the weather and flowers blooming everywhere. I also enjoy choral music and am a certified dog lover. So, if you have dogs then be assured, I'm going to ask for multiple pictures of them!"
