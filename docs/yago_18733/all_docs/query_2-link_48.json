        "text": "Daniel F. Miller III\n\nBrookfield-Daniel F. Miller III, 44, passed away unexpectedly at his home on Sunday, October 1, 2023.\n\nDaniel, or Danny as his family and friends would call him, was born on May 8, 1979, in Syracuse. He was the son of Daniel F. Miller Jr. and Susan Smith Miller. He was born and raised in Syracuse, New York. Although he had lived in many places throughout Central New York, for the last five years Daniel resided in Brookfield with his wife and children. He and his wife, Crystal Wood, were wed in Clockville, NY the summer of 2009. Daniel's love for mechanics led him to work as an automobile mechanic at Walt's Automotive Repair in Syracuse. Danny was a jack of all trades. Daniel loved the outdoors and was an avid hunter and fisherman. He also enjoyed teaching his children how to safely hunt and fish. Danny enjoyed spending time outside, whether he was in the driveway fixing something or on the grill making and eating food. His memory will live on in his generosity and aptitude to always help anyone in need at the drop of a hat.\n\nHe will be loved, missed and remembered by his loving wife Crystal; his beloved children: Heidi Miller, Kyriese Miller, Bianca Fannin, Diamond Miller, Allysa Miller, and Camille Miller; his father Daniel F. Miller Jr., and his wife Clara of Syracuse, his stepfather Joseph Kemp, his siblings: Kim Alvarado, of Fulton, Brian Miller of Cazenovia, Brad Miller and Nicholas Senke, both of Fulton. Dan is also survived by numerous nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, and cousins.\n\nHe was predeceased by his mother Susan Miller.\n\nDaniel will have a celebration of life at a later date, to honor him and his memory.\n\nDan and his family are being provided with personal and professional care by Jeffrey T. Paul, Director of the Paul Funeral Home of Brookfield. To offer a condolence or share a memory please visit: paulfuneralhome.net"
