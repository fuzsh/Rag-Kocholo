        "text": "For adoptions facilitated by Catholic Charities of Harrisburg, we can help adoptees and birth parents in certain search activities. For a $100 fee, you can request written medical and non-identifying information compiled from the original adoption record. In addition, birth parents and adoptees can keep current contact information on file with our office.\n\nSearch and reunion services may be available if our office was involved in finalizing the adoption. The typical fee for these services is $400 and involves searching for the relative, acting as intermediary for contact if it is desired by all parties and facilitating the reunion if feasible."
