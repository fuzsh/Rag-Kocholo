        "text": "When the Information Services team was assigned the project to research Thomas Morris Chester, I had no idea it would reveal how little I knew about the African-American history of our capital. Frederick Douglass spoke here several times, including 1868. Educators and abolitionists like William Howard Day called the city home. Conductors for the Underground Railroad lived in the Old Eighth Ward. The Grand Review that honored the more than 200,000 African-American men who served in the U.S. Colored Troops during the Civil War was held here. We even had a semi-professional team in Negro League baseball, the Harrisburg Giants..\n\nI was born, raised and educated in the city. How did I not know about all of these people, places and events? When I mentioned the project to others, I discovered I was not alone. So, this Black History Month celebration, I encourage you to add a local touch to your celebration. Explore the legacy of the people, places and events that are Black History in the City of Harrisburg.\n\nHere are some ways that you can do that:\n\nCheck out these books from our Local History collection to learn about some of Harrisburg’s prominent African-American citizens:\n\nOne Hundred Voices: Harrisburg’s Historic African American Community, 1850- 1920\n\nAfrican Americans of Harrisburg\n\nHarrisburg’s Old Eighth Ward.\n\nVisit Digital Harrisburg, a website created by students of Messiah University and Harrisburg University that is devoted to Harrisburg’s history. Be sure to check out the essays and exhibitions like African-American Women’s Organizations in Harrisburg and Race and Place in Harrisburg.\n\nVisit the Gathering at the Crossroads monument located on the Capitol South Lawn in front of the K. Leroy Irvis Building. The base or “Old Pedestal” of the monument features names of 100 families from the Old 8th Ward; a map of the streets in the historic neighborhood sits on top. Surrounding this are the figures of abolitionists T. Morris Chester, William Howard Day, Frances E.W. Harper and Jacob Compton.\n\nDiscover the Historical Markers dedicated to African-Americans placed by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC). There are eight of these markers in Dauphin County and over 200 state wide. You can find them by using the historical marker database.\n\nAttend The Library’s Live and Learn: Animating Democracy series featuring presenters who are advancing cultural and heritage tourism experiences in Central Pennsylvania while animating democracy through public arts and placemaking programs. Past recordings can be found on The Library’s YouTube page.\n\nVisit the T. Morris Chester Welcome Center at the McCormick Riverfront Library. You can explore the Chester Research Collection, see the home of the Pennsylvania Past Players and possibly grab a cup of coffee at the Good Brotha’s Book Café."
