        "text": "Rockwood, Somerset Co., PA Source: The History of Bedford, Somerset and Fulton Counties, Pennsylvania -- 1884 Rockwood\n\nRockwood, situated at the junction of the Baltimore & Ohio and the Somerset & Cambria railroads, is one of the most enterprising, thrifty and fast growing villages in southern Pennsylvania. the place is still young, and its business interests are constantly increasing in extent and importance. Rockwood now contains four general stores, two groceries, four hotels, three blacksmithshops, one tannery, one gristmill, one planing-mill, one tinshop, one shoemakershop, two carpentershops, one tailorshop, three churches and one graded school. Two ministers and two physicians are residents of the place.\n\nThe town was laid out by Philip Wolfersberger, in 1857. Martin Meyers was the principal surveyor. The first house was built in 1856, by P. & D. Wolfersberger. It was a two-story frame building, and was used both as a store and a dwelling. The first hotel was erected by John Poister in 1860, and is now owned by Alexander Rhoads. Solomon Bechtel erected the first blacksmithshop in 1857. The first tannery was built in 1869, by Henry Werner, present owner. The planing-mill of A. Growall & Sons was built in 1872.\n\nThe railroad depot at this place was built in 1871. The postoffice was established in 1868. From that date until 1871, mail was brought from Gebharts, the citizens, by voluntary contributions, paying the mail-carrier. During the first quarter, the receipts of the office amounted to four dollars and fifty cents. The succession of postmasters has been as follows: F. B. Long, William S. Kreger, E. D. Miller.\n\nThe first schoolhouse in the place was erected in 1858, at a cost of three hundred and seventy-five dollars. The first teacher was S. A. Will, now an attorney of Pittsburgh, succeeded by E. D. Miller, George M. Baker, R. H. Dull, and others. The graded school building, two stories, 48x50 feet, was erected in 1875, and to date has cost twenty-five hundred dollars. The present number of pupils in attendance is one hundred and twenty-five.\n\nAmong the recent improvements are the Rockwood house, built in 1882 by D. H. Wolfersberger, and the Merchants Hotel, a very fine building, erected the same year by Samuel Buckman.\n\nThe village was first known as Shaffs Bridge, named after John Shaff, one of the early settlers of the township. The bridge was erected by Samuel Miller, in 1843. Afterwards the name Mineral Point was given, on account of the minerals found in the vicinity. The present name was finally settled upon, after much discussion. At least half a dozen meetings were held by the citizens, at the schoolhouse, without coming to any decision. Finally E. D. Miller, P. S. Wolfersberger and B. S. Harrington gave the town the name which it now bears. Wolfersberger, being ticket agent of the Baltimore & Ohio railroad, prevailed upon the managers of the road to call the station Rockwood, and Miller, who was then postmaster, succeeded in changing the name of the postoffice. Thus, the matter was settled ere the citizens were aware.\n\nThe railroad was, of course, the main agent in building up Rockwood.\n\nDaniel Miller, a wagonmaker, was born in Eastern Pennsylvania, about 1787. He removed to Summit township, in this county, early. he died in 1856.

In 1870, he engaged in the mercantile business at Rockwood, erecting the store now occupied by J. D. & E. D. Miller. J. D. Miller was elected to the legislature in 1865, and served during two sessions. He has since devoted himself entirely to his large and constantly growing business. Ephraim D. Miller, brother of Hon.

From that time, until he was twenty-four, he was engaged in teaching in Allegheny county, Maryland. he then formed a partnership with his brother, and engaged in mercantile business.\n\nHenry W.
