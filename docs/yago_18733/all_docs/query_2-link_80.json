        "text": "Daniel Miller is a Senior Fellow in Air Vehicle Engineering at the Lockheed Martin Skunk Works. He has led pioneering research and made valuable contributions in flight sciences and vehicle systems in embedded propulsion, flow control, directed energy (DE)/laser weapon systems (LWS) integration, aero-optics, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and robust design/design of experiments (DOE). Daniel's air platform experience spans F-35, F-22, F-16, F-117, ISR, UAS, C-130, X-30, and advanced programs.\n\nAs an AIAA Fellow, his professional contributions include an AIAA industry-standard textbook, short courses, technical chair, fluid dynamics technical committee, airborne DE systems integration committee, NATO innovative control effectors for manoeuvring of air vehicles, ASME, SAE, NASA, and NAE. Daniel has 60+ publications, 35+ patents, and has lectured broadly at venues across government, academia, and industry.\n\nHe has been deeply honored to receive recognition and publication of technical achievement from AIAA, ASME, NATO, Lockheed Martin, and academia. Daniel holds M.S. and B.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin, as well as CFD graduate course work from University of Texas."
