        "text": "Daniel Thomas Miller, of Sheridan, WY, passed peacefully at his home on October 7, 2023. He was 54 years old.\n\nHe was born in Torrance, California on August 1, 1969 (“90504”). He loved to tell stories of his childhood growing up there and all the crazy things he and “the crew” would do. In 1983, he and his parents moved to Montana and settled into a lovely house on Flathead Lake in Polson, Montana. His favorite things to do while living there were to take the boat out around the lake, fish off the dock, and ride his dirt bike or 4-wheelers with his friends.\n\nAfter graduating high school, he went on to study at the University of Montana and then the University of Wyoming, where he received his degree in Industrial Technology Education. During his time at UW, he took part in a work-study program with a professor we knew as “Doc Allen”, who would serve as one of Dan’s biggest mentors throughout his educational journey.\n\nIn October of 1992, while attending a friend’s wedding as part of the bridal party, Dan met the love of his life Heather, who coincidentally was also part of the bridal party. The two hit it off and quickly became each other’s best friends. They wed in August of 1994 and were now a family of three as he became a father to Heather’s daughter, Devon. In 1996, Dan officially adopted Devon as his own and devoted his life to “his girls” – they were the most important part of his life.\n\nDan taught for 25 years and made an impact on many of his students’ lives. Prior to moving to Sheridan, he taught a variety of classes at a high school in Sedalia, Missouri ranging from industrial technology, offset printing, photography, and small engines. In 2000, the family moved back to Wyoming and settled in Sheridan and Dan started work as a wood shop teacher at the Sheridan Jr High School. He eventually made his way up to the Sheridan High School where he continued to teach industrial technology classes such as wood shop, construction, and machining. Dan truly cared about his students and their successes, especially their success after high school. He was known to take students under his wing and help them through their journey to reach that finish line. His work with his students has made our community a better place.\n\nIn August of 2016, Dan gained a son when Devon married Brett. Then in May of 2020, he became a grandpa to his grandson Terran – he was always known as “Pop-Pop”. Dan loved spending time with Terran and spoiling him with mini motorcycles and every Lego set he could ever imagine. When he saw Terran put his feet up and balanced during his first ride on his Harley Davidson strider bike, he smiled and said, “That’s my boy.”\n\nDan enjoyed spending time with friends and family, camping, watching horror movies, riding his Harley, having adventures with Heather, and working on their home to make it completely their own. He loved to cook, most times in front of his giant Traeger grill – he always said “If you love someone, you cook for them”. His favorite holiday was Halloween and their house was known to have an epic yard full of tombstones, skeletons, and a graveyard fence, a lot of which he built on his own. He truly enjoyed handing out candy and ramen noodles to all the kids who stopped by, especially his students. And he loved to make people laugh – he always said he would have loved to be a comedian.\n\nDan is survived by his daughter Devon Bursell, son-in-law Brett Bursell, and grandson Terran Bursell, all of Sheridan; Heather’s parents Pat and Sandi Love, as well as her siblings, nieces, and nephews; their two cats Tigger and Freddy; and countless other friends he has made through the years.\n\nDonations can be made in memory of Dan and will be used to continue his love and support for the causes that were most important to him. Please make donations to “Miller’s Memorial Fund, c/o Devon Bursell, 134 Peno Road, Sheridan, WY 82801.\n\nA Celebration Of Life, Open House with Taco Bar, and telling stories about Dan’s life, will be on Saturday October 28, 2023 at Kane Funeral Home Reception room. Wear your Orange and Black."
