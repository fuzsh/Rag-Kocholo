Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum, Old Commercial Road, Portsmouth, Hampshire

The writer Charles Dickens was born on the 7th February 1812 at 1 Mile End Terrace, today 393 Old Commercial Road, Portsmouth. The house is now maintained as a museum and furnished in the Georgian lower middle class style of the early 19th Century.

The Dickens family were often behind with the rent, and left the house for cheaper accommodation a few months after Charles's birth.
