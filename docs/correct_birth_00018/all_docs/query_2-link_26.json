        "text": "Charles Dickens is one of the greatest novelists in the English language, a genius of fiction who has captivated generations of readers with his emotional and realistic stories. Born in 1812 into a modest family, he lived through the poverty and hardships of daily working-class life, experiences that informed his work. He began his career writing articles for newspapers and magazines and quickly emerged as one of the most important Victorian novelists with works such as 'Oliver Twist', 'David Copperfield', 'Bleak House ”, “ Great Expectations ” and “ Our Mutual Friend ”. His sharp pen and ability to accurately describe the social problems of his time, such as poverty, inequality, and injustice, made him an influential social commentator and advocate for the most disadvantaged. Even today, his works continue to captivate readers with their wealth of colourful characters, their sense of humour, and their moving realism.\n\nBut how did Charles Dickens' childhood impact his future works? What were his greatest works and why? And finally, what impact did his works and message have on literature?\n\nArmed with this question, we will ask how Charles Dickens' experiences in working-class life informed his novels and how this influenced his role as a social commentator and defender of the most disadvantaged. In the Victorian era and his contribution to literature?\n\n1) The Childhood of Charles Dickens and its influence on his work\n\nA. Description of Charles Dickens's childhood, marked by poverty and financial difficulties\n\nCharles Dickens was born on February 7, 1812, in Landport, near Portsmouth in England. His family was relatively poor, and he experienced financial difficulties from childhood. His father was a clumsy civil servant who ended up in debt and imprisoned for debt. As a result, Charles was forced to quit school and work to support his family. He worked as an office worker and a labourer in a candle wax factory. These experiences were very difficult for him, but they also fuelled his imagination and inspired many of his characters and stories.\n\nB. Analysis of how these experiences influenced his vision of society and the condition of the working classes\n\nThe experiences of Charles Dickens during his childhood and adolescence considerably influenced his vision of society and the condition of the working classes. He witnessed the poverty and social injustice of his time and this prompted him to describe in his works the difficult living conditions of workers and the poor. He has often featured characters struggling to survive in a world where the rich and powerful are indifferent to their fates. He exposed social inequalities, injustices and abuses in his literature, highlighting the harmful consequences of these systems on individuals and communities. He was also an advocate for education and the emancipation of the working classes, fighting for children to have access to a decent education and opportunities to succeed. He used his writings to challenge readers to the social issues of his time and helped raise public awareness of social inequalities and injustices in Victorian society. It also inspired many future authors and artists to continue exploring these themes in their own work.\n\n2) Contribution of the most important works of Charles Dickens to literature\n\nA. Presentation of the most important works of Charles Dickens, such as \" Oliver Twist \", \" David Copperfield \", \" Bleak House \" and \" Great Expectations “\n\nOliver Twist is a novel serialised from 1837 to 1839.
