        "text": "For my first post, I thought it appropriate to write about arguably Portsmouth‘s most famous son, Charles Dickens, as we share the same birthdate, 7th February. This year is, of course, his bicentennial and here are five things you can do to join in the city’s celebrations:\n\nVisit the Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum * in Old Commercial Road, Portsmouth, opening until 4th November 2012, Tuesday – Sundays (except Bank Holidays). The celebrated author was born in this terrace, then known as 1 Mile End Terrace, Landport, on 7th February 1812 to John and Elizabeth Dickens. John, a clerk in the Navy Pay Office, would have had an easy walk through to the Dockyard. The house is furnished in a recreated Regency style as the Dickens family would have known it.\n\nUp close and personal – on several dates throughout the year, visitors will be able to handle a range of artefacts – check the website for more details.\n\nIf you want to hear Dickens in the Victorian style, readings take place the first Sunday of every month at the museum – April – September inclusive – at 3.00 pm, lasting around 45 minutes. Check the website for more details.\n\nCan’t get enough Dickens? Then walk the walk – free Charles Dickens Guided Walks take place throughout the year starting at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard’s Victory Gate and finishing at the Portsmouth City Museum. To book a walk, contact the Visitor Information Service on 023 92826722 or email vis@portsmouthcc.gov.uk.\n\n2012 Charles Dickens Celebrations in Portsmouth Join in the celebrations of the birth by attending the annual wreath laying ceremony by the Lord Mayor of Portsmouth on 7th February (10.30 for 11.am) after which there will be a service of thanks at St Mary’s church where Dickens was baptised.
