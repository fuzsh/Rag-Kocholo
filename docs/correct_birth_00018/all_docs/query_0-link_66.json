        "text": "Portsmouth Museums has a significant collection of items relating to Charles Dickens.\n\nSome of the earliest items that came into our collection included signed documents, a sculpture of his father and a large portrait of the author by local artist Henry Bryant, which is now on permanent display at the Dickens Birthplace.\n\nFollowing Dickens’ death in 1870, some of his personal effects were donated to Portsmouth Museums by his family. These included hand-written letters, original illustrations, books, manuscripts and a large number of family photographs. Perhaps the most significant item from this donation was the chaise longue sofa on which he died on 9th June 1870 at Gad’s Hill Place in Kent."
