        "text": "Charles Dickens created some of the world's best loved fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era.\n\nHis works are considered classics of English literature.\n\nBorn in Portsmouth in 1812, Dickens was one of six children. His father worked for the Navy but was summoned back to London in 1822. The family fell into debt, and his parents and siblings moved to Marshalsea debtors prison. Dickens stayed with a friend and worked to reduce the debt.\n\nThese experiences inspired many of his novels and his wizened and impoverished characters. Churches often appear in his life and works. Dickens was particularly taken with Unitarianism and attended a chapel on Little Portland Street for many years, including the time he wrote ‘A Christmas Carol’. Unfortunately nothing remains of the chapel now."
