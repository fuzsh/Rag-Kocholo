        "text": "1812-1870\n\nWho Was Charles Dickens?\n\nCharles Dickens was a British author, journalist, editor, illustrator, and social commentator who wrote the beloved classics Oliver Twist, A Christmas Carol, and Great Expectations. His books were first published in monthly serial installments, which became a lucrative source of income following a childhood of abject poverty. Dickens wrote 15 novels in total, including Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield, and A Tale of Two Cities. His writing provided a stark portrait of poor and working class people in the Victorian era that helped to bring about social change. Dickens died in June 1870 at age 58 and is remembered as one of the most important and influential writers of the 19th century.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Charles John Huffam Dickens\n\nBORN: February 7, 1812\n\nDIED: June 9, 1870\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Portsmouth, England\n\nSPOUSE: Catherine Thomson Hogarth (1836-1870)\n\nCHILDREN: Charles Jr., Mary, Kate, Walter, Francis, Alfred, Sydney, Henry, Dora, and Edward\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aquarius\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nCharles John Huffam Dickens was born on February 7, 1812, in Portsmouth on the southern coast of England. He was the second of eight children born to John Dickens, a naval clerk who dreamed of striking it rich, and Elizabeth Barrow, who aspired to be a teacher and school director. Despite his parentsâ best efforts, the family remained poor but nevertheless happy in the early days.\n\nIn 1816, they moved to Chatham, Kent, where young Dickens and his siblings were free to roam the countryside and explore the old castle at Rochester. Dickens was a sickly child and prone to spasms, which prevented him from playing sports. He compensated by reading avidly, including such books as Robinson Crusoe, Tom Jones, Peregrine Pickle, and The Arabian Nights, according to by Fido Martin.\n\nIn 1822, the Dickens family moved to Camden Town, a poor neighborhood in London. By then, the familyâs financial situation had grown dire, as Charlesâ father had a dangerous habit of living beyond the familyâs means. Eventually, John was sent to prison for debt in 1824, when Charles was just 12 years old. He boarded with a sympathetic family friend named Elizabeth Roylance, who later inspired the character Mrs. Pipchin in Dickensâ 1847 novel Dombey and Son, according to by Fred Kaplan.\n\nMore 19th Century Authors\n\nFollowing his fatherâs imprisonment, Dickens was forced to leave school to work at a boot-blacking factory alongside the River Thames. At the run-down, rodent-ridden factory, Dickens earned 6 shillings a week labeling pots of âblacking,â a substance used to clean fireplaces. It was the best he could do to help support his family, and the strenuous working conditions heavily influenced his future writing and his views on treatment of the poor and working class.\n\nMuch to his relief, Dickens was permitted to go back to school when his father received a family inheritance and used it to pay off his debts. He attended the Wellington House Academy in Camden Town, where he encountered what he called âhaphazard, desultory teaching [and] poor discipline,â according to by Angus Wilson. The schoolâs sadistic headmaster was later the inspiration for the character Mr. Creakle in Dickensâ semi-autobiographical novel David Copperfield.\n\nLife as a Journalist, Editor, and Illustrator\n\nGetty Images\n\nCharles Dickens wrote 15 novels in his lifetime.\n\nWhen Dickens was 15, his education was pulled out from under him once again. In 1827, he had to drop out of school and work as an office boy to contribute to his familyâs income. However, as it turned out, the job became a launching point for his writing career. Within a year of being hired, Dickens began freelance reporting at the law courts of London. Just a few years later, he was reporting for two major London newspapers.\n\nIn 1833, he began submitting sketches to various magazines and newspapers under the pseudonym âBoz,â which was a family nickname. His first published story was âA Dinner at Poplar Walk,â which ran in Londonâs Monthly Magazine in 1833. Seeing his writing in print made his eyes âoverflow with joy and pride,â according to Dickens: A Biography. In 1836, his clippings were published in his first book, Sketches by Boz.\n\nDickens later edited magazines including Household Words and All the Year Round, the latter of which he founded. In both, he promoted and originally published some of his own work such as Oliver Twist and A Tale of Two Cities.\n\nPersonal Life: Wife and Children\n\nGetty Images\n\nCharles Dickens pictured with his wife, Catherine Hogarth Dickens, and two of their daughters in a horse-drawn carriage, circa 1850.\n\nDickens married Catherine Hogarth in 1836, soon after the publication of his first book, Sketches by Boz. She was the daughter of George Hogarth, the editor of the Evening Chronicle. Dickens and Hogarth went on to have 10 children between 1837 and 1852, according to biographer Fred Kaplan. Among them were magazine editor Charles Dickens Jr., painter Kate Dickens Perugini, barrister Henry Fielding Dickens, and Edward Dickens, who entered into politics after immigrating to the Australia.\n\nIn 1851, Dickens suffered two devastating losses: the deaths of his infant daughter, Dora, and his father, John. He also separated from his wife in 1858. Dickens slandered Catherine publicly and struck up an intimate relationship with a young actor named Ellen âNellyâ Ternan. Sources differ on whether the two started seeing each other before or after Dickensâ marital separation. It is also believed that he went to great lengths to erase any documentation alluding to Ternanâs presence in his life. These major losses and challenges seeped into Dickensâ writing in his âdark novelâ period.\n\nDive Deeper\n\nCharles Dickensâ Books: 'Oliver Twist,' 'Great Expectations,' and More\n\nGetty Images\n\nA vintage illustration of a scene from Charles Dickensâ Oliver Twist portraying Oliver as he asks for a second helping of porridge at the childrenâs ward of the workhouse.\n\nBest known for his fiction writing, Dickens wrote a total of 15 novels between 1836 and 1870. His first was The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, and his last was The Mystery of Edwin Drood, which went unfinished due to his death.\n\nDickensâ books were originally published in monthly serial installments that sold for 1 shilling each. The affordable price meant everyday citizens could follow along, though wealthier readers, such as Queen Victoria, were also among Dickensâ fans. Once complete, the stories were published again in novel form.\n\nDickensâ books provided a stark portrait of poor and working class people in the Victorian era that helped to bring about social change. In the 1850s, following the death of his father and infant daughter, as well as his separation from his wife, Dickensâ novels began to express a darkened worldview. His so-called dark novels are Bleak House (1853), Hard Times (1854), and Little Dorrit (1857). They feature more complicated, thematically grim plots and more complex characters, though Dickens didnât stray from his typical societal commentary.\n\nRead more about each of Charles Dickensâ novels below:\n\nThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club\n\nSerial Publication: April 1836 to November 1837\n\nNovel Publication: 1837\n\nIn 1836, the same year his first book of illustrations released, Dickens started publishing The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club. His series, originally written as captions for artist Robert Seymourâs humorous sports-themed illustrations, took the form of monthly serial installments. It was wildly popular with readers, and Dickensâ captions proved even more popular than the illustrations they were meant to accompany.\n\nOliver Twist\n\nSerial Publication: February 1837 to March 1839\n\nNovel Publication: November 1838\n\nWhile still working on The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, Dickens began Oliver Twist, or The Parish Boyâs Progress, which would prove to be one of his most popular novels. The book follows the life of an orphan living in the streets of London, where he must get by on his wits and falls in with a gang of juvenile pickpockets led by the dastardly Fagin.\n\nOliver Twist unromantically portrayed the mistreatment of London orphans, and the slums and poverty described in the novel made for biting social satire. Although very different from the humorous tone of the Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist was extremely well-received in both England and America, and dedicated readers eagerly anticipated each next monthly installment, according to the biography Charles Dickens by Harold & Miriam Maltz. Even the young Queen Victoria was an avid reader of Oliver Twist, describing it as âexcessively interesting.â\n\nNicholas Nickleby\n\nSerial Publication: April 1838 to October 1839\n\nNovel Publication: 1839\n\nAs Dickens was still finishing Oliver Twist, he again began writing his follow-up work in The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby. It tells the story of the title character, who must support his mother and sister following the loss of their comfortable lifestyle when his father dies and the family loses all of their money.\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop\n\nSerial Publication: April 1840 to February 1841\n\nNovel Publication: 1841\n\nTaking a few months between projects this time, Dickensâ next serial was The Old Curiosity Shop. Protagonist Nell Trent lives with her grandfather, whose gambling costs them the titular shop. The pair struggles to survive after into hiding to avoid a money lender.\n\nBarnaby Rudge\n\nSerial Publication: February to November 1841\n\nNovel Publication: 1841\n\nRight on the heels of The Old Curiosity Shop came Barnaby Rudge. The historical fiction novel, Dickensâ first, follows Barnaby and depicts the chaos of mob violence. The author originated the idea years prior but is thought to have temporarily abandoned it due to a dispute with his publisher.\n\nMartin Chuzzlewit\n\nSerial Publication: January 1843 to July 1844\n\nNovel Publication: 1844\n\nAfter his first American tour, Dickens wrote The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit. The story is about a manâs struggle to survive on the ruthless American frontier.\n\nDombey and Son\n\nSerial Publication: October 1846 to April 1848\n\nNovel Publication: 1848\n\nAfter an uncharacteristic break, Dickens returned with Dombey and Son, which centers on the theme of how business tactics affect a familyâs personal finances. Published as a novel in 1848, it takes a dark view of England and is considered pivotal to Dickensâ body of work in that it set the tone for his future novels.\n\nDavid Copperfield\n\nSerial Publication: May 1849 to November 1850\n\nNovel Publication: November 1850\n\nDickens wrote his most autobiographical novel to date with David Copperfield by tapping into his own personal experiences in his difficult childhood and his work as a journalist. The book follows the life of its title character from his impoverished childhood to his maturity and success as a novelist. It was the first work of its kind: No one had ever written a novel that simply followed a character through his everyday life.\n\nDavid Copperfield is considered one of Dickensâ masterpieces, and it was his personal favorite of his works; he wrote in the bookâs preface, âLike many fond parents, I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child. And his name is David Copperfield.â It also helped define the publicâs expectations of a Dickensian novel. In The Life of Charles Dickens, biographer John Forster wrote âDickens never stood so high in reputation as at the completion of Copperfield,â and biographer Fred Kaplan called the novel âan exploration of himself through his art more direct, more honest, more resolute than in his earlier fiction.â\n\nBleak House\n\nSerial Publication: 1852 to 1853\n\nNovel Publication: 1853\n\nHis next work, Bleak House, dealt with the hypocrisy of British society. The first of his âdark novels,â it was considered his most complex novel yet. Drawing upon his brief experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, the novel is built around a long-running legal case involving several conflicting wills and was described by biographer Fido Martin as âEnglandâs greatest satire on the lawâs incompetence and delays.â Dickensâ satire was so effective that it helped support a successful movement toward legal reform in the 1870s.\n\nHard Times\n\nSerial Publication: April to August 1854\n\nNovel Publication: 1854\n\nDickens followed Bleak House with Hard Times, which takes place in an industrial town at the peak of economic expansion. Hard Times focuses on the shortcomings of employers as well as those who seek change.\n\nLittle Dorrit\n\nSerial Publication: December 1855 and June 1857\n\nNovel Publication: 1857\n\nAnother novel from Dickensâ darker period is Little Dorrit, a fictional study of how human values conflict with the worldâs brutality.\n\nA Tale of Two Cities\n\nSerial Publication: April to November 1959\n\nNovel Publication: 1859\n\nComing out of his âdark novelâ period, Dickens published A Tale of Two Cities in the periodical he founded, All the Year Round. The historical novel takes place during the French Revolution in Paris and London. Its themes focus on the need for sacrifice, the struggle between the evils inherent in oppression and revolution, and the possibility of resurrection and rebirth.\n\nA Tale of Two Cities was a tremendous success and remains Dickensâ best-known work of historical fiction. Biographer Fido Martin called the novel âpure Dickens, but essentially a Dickens we have never seen before. This is a Dickens who has at last captured in prose fiction the stage heroics he adored.â\n\nGreat Expectations\n\nSerial Publication: December 1860 to August 1861\n\nNovel Publication: October 1861\n\nMany people consider Great Expectations Dickensâ greatest literary accomplishment. The storyâDickensâ second thatâs narrated in the first personâfocuses on the lifelong journey of moral development for the novelâs protagonist, an orphan named Pip. With extreme imagery and colorful characters, the well-received novel touches on wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and good versus evil. The novel was a financial success and received nearly universal acclaim, with readers responding positively to the novelâs themes of love, morality, social mobility, and the eventual triumph of good over evil.\n\nOur Mutual Friend\n\nSerial Publication: May 1864 to November 1865\n\nNovel Publication: 1865\n\nIn June 1865, Dickens was a passenger on a train that plunged off a bridge in Kent, according to biographer Fred Kaplan. He tended to the wounded and even saved the lives of some passengers before assistance arrived, and he was able to retrieve his unfinished manuscript for his next novel, Our Mutual Friend, from the wreckage. That book, a satire about wealth and the Victorian working class, wasnât received as well as Dickensâ other works, with some finding the plot too complex and disorganized.\n\nThe Mystery of Edwin Drood\n\nSerial Publication: April 1870\n\nNovel Publication: 1870\n\nDickinsâ final novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, began its monthly serialized publication in April 1870. However, Dickens died less than two months later, leaving the novel unfinished. Only six of a planned 12 installments of his final work were completed at the time of his death, according to biographer Fido Martin.\n\nTravels to the United States\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe carriage Commodore, once owned by Charles Dickens, in New York City\n\nIn 1842, Dickens and his wife, Catherine, embarked on a five-month lecture tour of the United States. Dickens spoke of his opposition to slavery and expressed his support for additional reform. His lectures, which began in Virginia and ended in Missouri, were so widely attended that ticket scalpers gathered outside his events. Biographer J.B. Priestley wrote that during the tour, Dickens enjoyed âthe greatest welcome that probably any visitor to America has ever had.â\n\nâThey flock around me as if I were an idol,â bragged Dickens, a known show-off. Although he enjoyed the attention at first, he eventually resented the invasion of privacy. He was also annoyed by what he viewed as Americansâ gregariousness and crude habits, as he later expressed in American Notes for General Circulation (1842). The sarcastic travelogue, which Dickensâ penned upon his return to England, criticized American culture and materialism.\n\nAfter his criticism of the American people during his first tour, Dickens later launched a second U.S. tour from 1867 to 1868, where he hoped to set things right with the public and made charismatic speeches promising to praise the United States in reprints of American Notes for General Circulation and Martin Chuzzlewit, his 1844 novel set in the American frontier.\n\n'A Christmas Carol' and Other Works\n\nGetty Images\n\nAn illustrated scene from Charles Dickensâ A Christmas Carol when Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his old business partner, Jacob Marley.\n\nOn December 19, 1843, Dickens published A Christmas Carol, one of his most timeless and beloved works. The book features the famous protagonist Ebenezer Scrooge, a curmudgeonly old miser whoâwith the help of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Comeâfinds the holiday spirit. Dickens penned the book in just six weeks, beginning in October and finishing just in time for Christmas celebrations. Like his earlier works, it was intended as a social criticism, to bring attention to the hardships faced by Englandâs poorer classes.\n\nThe book was a roaring success, selling more than 6,000 copies upon publication. Readers in England and America were touched by the bookâs empathetic emotional depth; one American entrepreneur reportedly gave his employees an extra dayâs holiday after reading it. Despite its incredible success, the high production costs and Dickensâ disagreements with the publisher meant he received relatively few profits for A Christmas Carol, according to Kaplan, which were further reduced when Dickens was forced to take legal action against the publishers for making illegal copies.\n\nKeep Reading\n\nA Christmas Carol was Dickensâ most popular book in the United States, selling more than two million copies in the century after its first publication there, according to by Claire Tomalin. It is also one of Dickensâ most adapted works, and Ebenezer Scrooge has been portrayed by such actors as Michael Caine, Albert Finney, Patrick Stewart, Tim Curry, and Jim Carrey.\n\nDickens published several other Christmas novellas following A Christmas Carol, including The Chimes (1844) The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846), and The Haunted Man and the Ghostâs Bargain (1848). In 1867, he wrote a stage play titled No Thoroughfare.\n\nDeath\n\nOn June 8, 1870, Dickens had a stroke at his home in Kent, England, after a day of writing The Mystery of Edwin Drood. He died the next day at age 58.\n\nAt the time, Edwin Drood had begun its serial publication; it was never finished. Only half of the planned installments of his final novel were completed at the time of Dickensâ death, according to Fido.\n\nDickens was buried in Poetâs Corner at Westminster Abbey, with thousands of mourners gathering at the beloved authorâs gravesite.\n\nWhen 48 Doughty Street in Londonâwhich was Dickensâ home from 1837 to 1839âwas threatened with demolition, it was saved by the Dickens Fellowship and renovated, becoming the Dickens House Museum. Open since 1925, it appears like a middle-class Victorian home exactly as Dickens lived in it, and it houses a significant collection related to Dickens and his works.\n\nPop Culture Adaptations\n\nLarry Ellis//Getty Images\n\nActors Jack Wild and Mark Lester (respectively) portraying the Artful Dodger and Oliver Twist in Carol Reedâs film Oliver! (1968), based upon Charles Dickensâ novel A Christmas Carol (1843).\n\nMany of Dickensâ major works have been adapted for movies and stage plays, with some, like A Christmas Carol, repackaged in various forms over the years. Reginald Owen portrayed Ebenezer Scrooge in one of the earliest Hollywood adaptations of the novella in 1938, while Albert Finney played the character alongside Alec Guinness as Marleyâs ghost in the 1970 film Scrooge.\n\nSome adaptations have taken unique approaches to the source material. Michael Caine portrayed Scrooge in The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992), with members of the Muppets playing other characters from the story, and Gonzo the Great portraying Dickens as a narrator. Bill Murray played a version of Scrooge in a modern-day comedic take on the classic story. Several animated versions of A Christmas Carol have also been adapted, with Jim Carrey playing Scrooge in a 2009 computer-generated film that used motion-capture animation to create the character.\n\nSeveral more of Dickensâ works have been similarly adapted. Famed director David Lean made celebrated adaptations of both Great Expectations (1946) and Oliver Twist (1948). The latter novel was also adapted into a successful 1960 stage musical called Oliver!, and a 1968 movie versionâdirected by Carol Reedâof that same musical won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Director.\n\nMore recently, The Personal History of David Copperfield (2019) put a comedic spin on Dickensâ personal favorite of his own works, with Dev Patel performing the title role. Barbara Kingsolver also adapted the novel in her Pulitzer Prize winner Demon Copperhead (2022).\n\nQuotes\n\nThe English are, as far as I know, the hardest worked people on whom the sun shines.
