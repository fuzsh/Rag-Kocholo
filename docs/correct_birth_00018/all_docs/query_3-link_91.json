        "text": "The Life of Charles Dickens (1812-1870)\n\nThe house in Portsmouth, then known as 387 Mile End Terrace, Landport, where Charles Dickens was born. It is now a Dickens museum. Click on image for more information about the house Charles Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 in Landport, then a suburb of Portsmouth, where his father worked as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office. His grandfather William had been a footman in the household of Lady Blandford, had married her housemaid, and had gone on to become the steward of Lord Crewe at his country seat, Crewe Hall. Two children had been born to the couple, William and John. John Dickens had married Elizabeth Barrow, whose father was employed by the Navy Board.\n\nFor a time the newly-married pair lived quite comfortably on John's modest salary of £300 per year at the Pay Office, where he proved himself capable, hard-working and honest. In due course, however, as the children were born (there were to be eight, of whom Charles was the second), the gap between earnings and cost of living steadily widened and the family situation soon became desperate.\n\nIn 1822, shortly after being transferred to London, John Dickens found himself deeply in debt. The Dickens family were driven first to pawn and then to sell their household belongings. It was with a heavy heart that the young Charles Dickens parted with the books his father had bought him - classics such as Don Quixote, Robinson Crusoe, The Vicar of Wakefield and Tom Jones. But even such measures could not salvage the situation. In 1824 John Dickens was sent to the famous Marshalsea debtors' prison. Here he was joined by his wife and younger children. Only the eldest child, Fanny, then studying at the Royal Academy of Music, and Charles, employed at Warren's Blacking Factory and cared for by the distant relative who owned the establishment, were not allowed to stay at the prison.\n\nThe remains of the Marshalsea Prison in Borough, south London Click on image for more information Life in the Marshalsea was reasonably comfortable and John Dickens quickly became president of the committee controlling the prison's internal affairs.\n\nUnlike his father, however, Charles could not adapt to his new way of life. He found the work hateful and humiliating: 'no words,' he later wrote, 'can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into this companionship, compared these everyday associates with those of my happier childhood; and felt my early hopes of growing up to be a learned and distinguished man, crushed in my breast.'\n\nThe Life of Charles Dickens (1812-1870) Part 2\n\nAfter about six months in the Marshalsea, John Dickens was freed. Although Dickens's mother wanted Charles to go back to work, his father insisted that the boy should go back to school; thus Dickens was sent to Wellington House Academy between 1824 and 1827.\n\nHaving left school at the age of fifteen, Dickens began his career by working in a solicitor's office: and later on became a political reporter, working first for a journal called The Mirror of Parliament and then for the Morning Chronicle (1833-5). This period was of the greatest importance to Dickens's development as an author. His interests widened, he mastered the art of rapid, fluent, popular writing, and he acquired a stock of experience that gave his novels their tremendous 'immediacy' and impact.\n\nDickens's first attempt at writing fiction, as opposed to news reporting, was a short story published anonymously and without payment in 1833, in an obscure periodical called The Monthly Magazine.\n\nThe editor of the magazine was sufficiently impressed, however, to commission from Dickens further articles, or sketches. Charles obliged with two more, adopting as a nom de plume the name of his brother Augustus - 'Boz'. In 1836 several of these sketches were published in two volumes as Sketches by Boz, which earned the author the princely sum of £150.\n\nIn the spring of 1835 Dickens became engaged to Catherine Hogarth, daughter of the editor of the Evening Chronicle. They were married on 2 April 1836, and by the beginning of the following year had moved into a town house at 48 Doughty Street, London, where Dickens was to live during the crucial two years when he was writing Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby. Also living with the couple was Catherine's 16-year-old sister Mary.\n\nDickens's house at 48 Doughty Street. It is now a museum Click on image for more information\n\nTragedy struck in 1837, however, when on the evening of 7 May 1837 - a few months after Catherine had given birth to a son, also named Charles - Mary was unexpectedly taken ill, probably as a result of a heart attack. Within a few hours, she was dead. After Mary's death, for some twenty years, Dickens was almost totally taken up with his work as a writer, giving little time to family life. The real milestones were not so much the birth of his children (he had 10 of them) as the birth of his novels.\n\nFrom 1837 onwards, the flow of novels never stopped. Pickwick Papers was followed by Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby, The Old Curiosity Shop and Barnaby Rudge.\n\nBy the end of 1839 Dickens and his family had moved to 1 Devonshire Terrace, Regents Park, in London (pictured below). Here Dickens set himself up in a thoroughly well-to-do style, with his own carriage and groom.\n\nAfter tremendous exertions, and success to match, Dickens went in search of change to the United States in 1842. At first he was enthusiastically welcomed; but the mood towards him began to change after Dickens publicly rebuked the Americans in speeches for their disregard of international copyright - as yet there was no law governing the matter - by which authors such as himself were being deprived of their rightful income. This resentment also surfaced in Martin Chuzzlewit (1844), which soured his reputation in America for some considerable time.\n\nBy the late 1840s Dickens was earning good money as a novelist. David Copperfield (1849-50) at once became one of the most popular of his works. Dickens himself wrote the novel in a style more directly autobiographical than in any previous works, using his childhood experiences in the blacking factory as a basis for the plot."
