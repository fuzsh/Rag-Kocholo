        "text": "a) Watch the following animation on Charles Dickens’ story and learn about the most relevant biographical facts that influenced his works. Write a collaborative opinion essay about his life using googledocs and embed it to this blog.\n\nCharles Dickens’ biographical information\n\nCOMMENT ON THIS VIDEO\n\nThis video shows us the life of the writer Charles Dickens and his family, from his childhood to his death.\n\nIt explains the life of his father and the death of his mother when he was so young.\n\nWhen his father was sent to jail, he started to write. Then his most popular books appeared, like Christmas Carol, Oliver Twist, A Tale of Two Cities and others.\n\nThe video also explains his love problems, he left his wife and started a romance with a younger actress. They also speak about his travels around the world and finally, his death by a heart attack in his house.\n\n1812 – he was born to John and Elizabeth Dickens.\n\n1824 – John Dickens is arrested and sent to the Marshalsea prison. Charles Dickens worked at the Warren’s Blacking Factory.\n\n1834 – Began using the pseudonym “Boz”. He meets his future wife, Catherine Hogarth.\n\n1836 – The first chapters of The Pickwick Papers are published.\n\n1837 – His first of his 10 children is born.

You can either watch the films based on these novels (original version) or read the original novels online thanks to the Project Gutenberg.\n\nWe have chosen the novel of Oliver Twist.\n\n1)Plot\n\nOliver Twist is the second novel by English author Charles Dickens, published in 1838. The story is about an orphan, Oliver Twist, who endures a miserable existence in a workhouse and then he is placed with an undertaker. He escapes and travels to London where he meets the Artful Dodger, leader of a gang of juvenile pickpockets. Naively unaware of their unlawful activities, Oliver is led to the lair of their elderly criminal trainer Fagin.\n\nThis book is an early example of the social novel. The book calls the public’s attention to various contemporary evils, including child labour, the recruitment of children as criminals, and the presence of street children. Dickens mocks the hypocrisies of his time by surrounding the novel’s serious themes with sarcasm and dark humour.\n\nThe novel may have been inspired by the story of Robert Blincoe, an orphan whose account of hardships as a child labourer in a cotton mill was widely read in the 1830s. It is likely that Dickens’s own early youth as a child labourer contributed to the story’s development.\n\nOliver Twist has been the subject of numerous films and television adaptations, and is the basis for a highly successful musical play and the multiple Academy Award winning 1968 motion picture made from it.\n\n2) Characters\n\nOliver Twist – The novel’s protagonist. Oliver is an orphan born in a workhouse, and Dickens uses his situation to criticize public policy toward the poor in 1830s England. Oliver is between nine and twelve years old when the main action of the novel occurs. Though treated with cruelty and surrounded by coarseness for most of his life, he is a pious, innocent child, and his charms draw the attention of several wealthy benefactors. His true identity is the central mystery of the novel.\n\nFagin – A conniving career criminal. Fagin takes in homeless children and trains them to pick pockets for him. He is also a buyer of other people’s stolen goods. He rarely commits crimes himself, preferring to employ others to commit them—and often suffer legal retribution—in his place. Dickens’s portrait of Fagin displays the influence of anti-Semitic stereotypes.\n\nNancy – A young prostitute and one of Fagin’s former child pickpockets. Nancy is also Bill Sikes’s lover. Her love for Sikes and her sense of moral decency come into conflict when Sikes abuses Oliver. Despite her criminal lifestyle, she is among the noblest characters in the novel. In effect, she gives her life for Oliver when Sikes murders her for revealing Monks’s plots.\n\nRose Maylie – Agnes Fleming’s sister, raised by Mrs. Maylie after the death of Rose’s father. A beautiful, compassionate, and forgiving young woman, Rose is the novel’s model of female virtue. She establishes a loving relationship with Oliver even before it is revealed that the two are related.\n\nMr. Brownlow – A well-off, erudite gentleman who serves as Oliver’s first benefactor. Mr. Brownlow owns a portrait of Agnes Fleming and was engaged to Mr. Leeford’s sister when she died. Throughout the novel, he behaves with compassion and common sense and emerges as a natural leader.\n\nMonks – A sickly, vicious young man, prone to violent fits and teeming with inexplicable hatred. With Fagin, he schemes to give Oliver a bad reputation.\n\n3) Social aspects depicted in Dickens novels\n\nIn his novels, Dickens talked about social aspects in Victorian times. He focused in poverty, child labour and prostitution.\n\nPoverty\n\nIn those times there was a lot of poverty in London. The population increased because there was a lot of work and people wanted to win money but there was a problem, the wages were very low. The people had to live in small flats and sanitary conditions were very bad.\n\nChild labour\n\nThe Victorian era became notorious for the employment of young children in factories and mines and as chimney sweeps.The children did’t go to school, they just worked .\n\nChild labour, often brought about by economic hardship, played an important role in the Industrial Revolution from its outset: Charles Dickens, for example, worked at the age of 12 in a blacking factory, with his family in a debtors’ prison.\n\nProstitution\n\nProstitution started in 1840 major news organisations, clergymen, and single women became increasingly concerned about prostitution, which came to be known as “The Great Social Evil”.\n\nProject Gutenberg: original novels online\n\nc) You will be able to experience London through the eyes of Dickensian characters with the Dickens London Trails:\n\nDickens Trails\n\nDICKENS’ TRAIL IN LONDON\n\nDuring our stay we’ll walk London in the footsteps of Charles Dickens and try to see the city through his eyes.\n\nHere is a list of places related to his life and his books. Places where he used to go, walk, write or drink or places where he located some of the characters and scenes of his most important books.\n\nAdelphi Buildings\n\nIt’s a Hotel called “Osborne’s Hotel” in Pickwick Papers. Pickwick announced his retirement here. David Copperfield also lived in Adelphi. The buildings gave their name to the Adelphi theatre, which played host to adaptations of Dickens’ stories.\n\nDickens Coffee House\n\nThis building in the heart of London’s theatreland once housed Dickens’ offices for “All the year round” , the magazine he founded, owned, published and edited. In the late 1860s he also lodged in rooms above the offices.\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop\n\nThis is the name of one of the novels by Dickens. The plot follows the life of Nell Trent and her grandfather, both residents of the Old Curiosity Shop in London. The shop that inspired Dickens is in 13-14 Portsmouth street. It is one of the oldest shops in London.\n\nCovent Garden\n\nDickens had very connections with the area. For example, the Freemason’s tavern, now part of the new Connaught rooms on great queen st, hosted a lavish farewell banked before his last voyage to America in 1867.\n\nMonmouth Street\n\nIn the Victorian times, Monmouth Street was a favorite shopping destination for less well-off. Dickens begins his short story Meditations in Monmouth-Street thus: “We have always entertained a particular attachment to Monmouth-street as the only true and real emporium for second-wearing apparel”.\n\nSeven Dials\n\nHe was among the worst slums in Dickens’ London. It appears in one work of Dickens called Sketchs by Boz, where he writes:\n\n“The stranger who finds himself in The Dials for the first time, and stands Belzoni like at the entrance of seven obscure passages, uncertain which to take, will see enough around him to keep his curiosity and attention awake for no inconsiderable time.\n\nYe Olde London Pub\n\nThis traditional London pub is built on the site of The London Coffee Hoyse, in Ludgate Hill. It takes part of the Dickens’ work Little Dorritt, where the main character Mr Arthur Clenman appears:\n\nDickens’ birthplace house\n\nThe house where he was born is small but comfortable. It has three floors; in each one there are two or three rooms maximum. On the lower floor there is the kitchen, it’s the only room that hasn´t been replaced. On the first floor there is a room called the parlour and it’s the posh sitting room. In front of it there is the dining room that it has similar wallpaper to the original. There are pictures that are prints of contemporary beauties by Bartolozzi and also in the other paintings there are naval British battles. The dinning suite is composed by the table and the chairs. The dresser (to dress the room, for decoration) is a piece of furniture in the right and it’s from the 18th century (1770). The pottery is for decoration but also for the day use, it’s from the 19th century.\n\nOn the second floor also called the bedroom floor there are two rooms, two bedrooms.\n\nFirst bedroom\n\nA reminder of Dickens’ birth, a portrait and a porcelain bust of him are displayed in this room. The bed is a type of regency style from the 19th century. There is a piece of furniture called chest of drawers, and the tallest style was called “tallboy” (old mid-18th century). There is also a mantelpiece in the fire place. They used to wash the clothes by hand and hang them in the clothes stand by the fire. In the time they didn’t have running water so there was a sink were they washed themselves.\n\nSecond bedroom\n\nThey have put an exhibition with information. There is the couch where Dickens died on 9 June 1870 at his home, Gad’s Hill in Kent. The death certificate gives ‘apoplexy’ as the cause of death; now it would be described as a stroke. In this room is alacters and several belongings of his.so the death certificate. There are paintings of Dickens’ char\n\nOn the third floor, there is the attic.\n\nThe two attic rooms were invented as bedrooms for children and domestic servants.\n\nSeveral of Dickens’ objects on display are:\n\n-Oil sketch of Charles Dicken´s as a young man – painted by J. Hazlett.\n\n-Portrait of Charles Dickens painted in Rochester, 1869.\n\n-One ring and glasses."
