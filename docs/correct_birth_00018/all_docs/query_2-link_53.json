Namely, what exactly was his relationship with Ellen Lawless Ternan?\n\nDickens at the Movies\n\nCharles Dickens' visual style of writing lends itself easily to the stage and screen. The Internet Movie Database lists over 200 films made from Dickens' novels.\n\nIn the Charles Dickens tradition of helping the needy and the sick this site supports\n\nSt. Jude Children's Research Hospital\n\nFinding cures. Saving children.\n\nPlease help!\n\nSir Roger de Coverley\n\nThe fiddler struck up Sir Roger de Coverley. Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them.\n\nThe dance performed by Fezziwig and company was popular in the eighteenth century and was considered old-fashioned by Dickens' time. Named for a ficticious character in The Spectator (1711) the dance resembled the Virginia Reel. It was usually the last dance performed during an evening of entertainment (Hearn, 2004, pp. 70-71, n. 52).\n\nLearn the dance\n\nHear the music\n\nVote for your favorite Charles Dickens novel, character, and film version of A Christmas Carol\n\nCharles Dickens Puzzles\n\nBy Julian Morgan\n\nA fun and challenging romp through the world of Dickens!\n\nRailway Crash!\n\nCharles Dickens, Henry Benge, and the Great Staplehurst Railway Crash\n\nRead the story of how a simple mistake took the lives of ten people, ruined the life of Henry Benge, and shortened the life of Charles Dickens.\n\nCursing in Dickens\n\nAs the stricter morals of the Victorian era replaced the ribaldry of the 18th-century, Dickens felt compelled to clean up his act. Instances of cursing in the novels dropped dramatically in his mid and late career. For example, below is a count of the full-use of the word \"damn\" (as opposed to just a capital D or d--d for damn or damned) in Dickens' works:\n\n7 - Sketches by Boz\n\n29 - Pickwick Papers\n\n12 - Nicholas Nickleby\n\n8 - Barnaby Rudge\n\n1 - David Copperfield\n\n3 - Bleak House\n\n3 - Hard Times\n\n3 - Little Dorrit\n\n1 - Tale of Two Cities\n\n3 - Great Expectations\n\n1 - Our Mutual Friend\n\n2 - Edwin Drood\n\nYe Olde Cheshire Cheese\n\nAfter Charles Darnay is acquitted of treason he accompanies Sydney Carton \"down Ludgate hill to Fleet Street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine\" (A Tale of Two Cities, p. 77).\n\nThis was almost certainly Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, rebuilt after the great fire of 1666 and a favorite of Dickens.\n\nRead about a visit Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese by Joseph Pennell for Harper's Weekly in November 1887."
