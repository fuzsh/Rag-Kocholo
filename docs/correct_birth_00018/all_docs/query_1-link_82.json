        "text": "Charles Dickens was born in Portsmouth on 7th February 1812, the eldest child of a naval pay clerk. The family soon moved away, firstly to Chatham in Kent and then to London, which was to be Charles’s home for most of the rest of his life.\n\nThe family went through some bad times during his childhood, and at one stage he had to work in a shoe-blacking warehouse to help support the rest of the family.\n\nHe started writing stories and sketches while working as a parliamentary reporter, and, once he got a story into print, he simply had to write more. At first he used the name “Boz” as a non de plume, and his “Sketches by Boz” proved to be highly popular.\n\nHis first novel was the somewhat rambling “Pickwick Papers” that was really a set of farcical stories within a loose framework. However, this was so popular with the public that Dickens was set on a full-time career as a writer. In all he wrote 15 novels, including the unfinished “Mystery of Edwin Drood”, as well as shorter stories that included “A Christmas Carol”.\n\nAmong his most popular novels were “Oliver Twist”, “Nicholas Nickleby”, “David Copperfield”, “Great Expectations” and “Bleak House”.\n\nDickens wrote all his novels in serial form, producing weekly or monthly parts which were sometimes part of journals containing other material, both by himself and other writers."
