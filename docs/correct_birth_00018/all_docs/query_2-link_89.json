        "text": "Charles Dickens' Family\n\nand Friends\n\nLearn about Charles Dickens' parents, siblings, children, and more\n\nDickens with daughters Mamie and Katie\n\nScenes of family harmony and cozy firesides in many of Charles Dickens' stories seem in stark contrast to his own family life. Growing up, the family situation was often precarious due to his father's trouble with debt, which landed him in debtors' prison in 1824 when Charles was 12 (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 68-69).\n\nLater Dickens' own family was marked by strife as his relationship with his wife deteriorated and his sons seemed to have inherited their paternal grandfather's trouble handling finances. Dickens once lamented that he had \"brought up the largest family ever known, with the smallest disposition to do anything for themselves\" (Letters, 1999, v. 11, p. 252). Dickens' extended family's constant drain on his finances, along with his built-in anxiety about money caused by his childhood, resulted in Dickens never feeling comfortable enough about his financial situation.\n\nDickens' circle of friends consisted of people prominent in the arts, journalism, publishing, politics and public life. A loyal friend who demanded loyalty in return, lines were drawn during Dickens' very public separation from Catherine. Those not sympathetic to Dickens' side soon felt his wrath, in some cases, forever (Nayder, 2011, p. 265-266).\n\nCharles Dickens' Parents\n\nJohn Dickens after a drawing by Edwin Roffe\n\nJohn Dickens (1785-1851) - Dickens' father, was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office. In 1809 he married Elizabeth Barrow with whom he had eight children. John loved to live the good life but was frequently unable to pay for it. He was imprisoned for debt in 1824 in the Marshalsea Debtor's Prison. After his release from prison he returned to the Navy Pay Office, retired, and later worked as a reporter. His money problems continued and when Charles gained fame as a writer he frequently embarrassed his son by seeking loans from Charles' friends and publishers behind his back. Charles retained a warm affection for his father while deploring his inability to manage money (Schlicke, 1999, p. 169-173). John was the source of Charles' character Wilkins Micawber in the autobiographical novel, David Copperfield, as well as William Dorrit in Little Dorrit (Pugh, 1912, p. 339).\n\nElizabeth Dickens after a drawing by Edwin Roffe\n\nElizabeth (Barrow) Dickens (1789-1863) - Dickens' mother, married John Dickens in 1809. Charles was the second of their eight children. Charles was taken from school to work at Warren's Blacking Factory to help support the family during John's imprisonment for debt. When John was released and a quarrel with Charles' employer resulted in Charles being removed from the blacking factory, his mother tried, unsuccessfully, to patch things up and have Charles return to work. For the rest of his life Charles never forgave her saying \"I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back\" (Johnson, 1952, p. 44). Charles used his mother as the original for Mrs Nickleby in Nicholas Nickleby (Pugh, 1912, p. 185).\n\nBack to Top\n\nCharles Dickens' Siblings\n\nFrances Elizabeth (Fanny) Dickens (August 1810-September 2, 1848) Dickens oldest sister with whom he was very close in childhood. She was a talented woman and studied music at the Royal Academy of Music. Fanny married Henry Burnett and had a crippled son, Henry Jr, whom Dickens used as a model for Paul Dombey and possibly Tiny Tim (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 519-520). Fanny died of consumption at age 38. See sidebar.\n\nRead a letter Dickens wrote to his friend, John Forster, describing a visit to see his terminally ill sister.\n\nAlfred Allen Dickens (March 28, 1814-September 1814) Dickens' younger brother who died in infancy (Slater, 2009, p. 5).\n\nLetitia Mary Dickens (April 1816-1893) Dickens' younger sister, Letitia married architect and artist Henry Austin in 1837. When Henry died in 1862 Charles secured a government pension for Letitia (Davis, 1999, p. 104).\n\nHarriet Dickens (1819-?) Dickens' sister who died in childhood (Davis, 1999, p. 104).\n\nFrederick Dickens (August 1820-October 20, 1868) Dickens' younger brother who lived with Charles when he moved to Furnival's Inn in 1834 (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 161). Fred fell into debt, using Charles' name to obtain credit (Johnson, 1952, p. 452). Fred continued to hound his famous brother for money until finally Charles was forced to cut him off entirely (Johnson, 1952, p. 942-943). When he died at age 48 Charles lamented to John Forster that \"It was a wasted life, but God forbid that one should be hard upon it, or upon anything in this world that is not deliberately and coldly wrong\" (Forster, 1899, v. 2, p. 443)\n\nAlfred Lamert Dickens (March 1822-July 1860) Dickens' younger brother, a civil engineer and sanitary inspector. When Alfred died in 1860 Charles helped support his family (Davis, 1999, p. 98).\n\nAugustus Dickens (1827-October 4, 1866) Dickens' youngest brother. Dickens helped Augustus get a job with a wealthy merchant in London (Johnson, 1952, p. 494-495). Augustus' wife became blind and he left her and went to America with another woman with whom he lived as man and wife. He died at age 39 in Chicago and Charles gave support to both wives (Davis, 1999, p. 98). Augustus is buried in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago IL.\n\nBack to Top\n\nCharles Dickens' Wife Catherine\n\nCatherine Dickens in the 1840s and in 1879\n\nCatherine (Hogarth) Dickens (1815-1879) - Dickens' wife, with whom he fathered 10 children. She was born in Scotland on May 19, 1815 and came to England with her family in 1834. Catherine was the daughter of George Hogarth, editor of the Evening Chronicle where Dickens was a young journalist. They were married on April 2, 1836 in St. Luke's Church, Chelsea and honeymooned in Chalk, near Chatham. With the birth of their last child in 1852 Dickens found Catherine an increasingly incompetent mother and housekeeper (Johnson, 1952, p. 905-909). Catherine, after giving birth to ten children, had grown \"stout and matronly\" (Schlicke, 1999, p. 155) and Dickens grew more and more dissatisfied at her lethargy. Their separation, in 1858, was much publicized and rumors of Dickens unfaithfulness abounded, which he vehemently denied in public. Dickens and Catherine had little correspondence after the break, Catherine moving to a house in London with oldest son, Charley, and Dickens retreating to Gads Hill in Kent with Catherine's sister, Georgina, and all of the children except Charley remaining with him. On her deathbed in 1879 she gave her collection of Dickens' letters to daughter Kate instructing her to \"Give these to the British Museum, that the world may know he loved me once\" (Schlicke, 1999, p. 153-157).\n\nRead a letter from Dickens to John Forster concerning separation from Catherine.\n\nAmazon.com: The Other Dickens: A Life of Catherine Hogarth by Lillian Nayder\n\nBack to Top\n\nCharles Dickens' Children\n\nCharles Culliford (Charley) Dickens (1837-1896) - Dickens' first child, educated at Eton, and studied business in Germany. Charley was the only child who lived with his mother after Dickens' separation with Catherine in 1858. In 1862 he married Bessie Evans, daughter of Dickens' former publisher, Frederick Evans, with whom Dickens had had a falling out. After a failed business venture, Dickens hired Charley as sub-editor of All the Year Round (Davis, 1999, p. 98).\n\nMary (Mamie) Dickens (1838-1896) - Dickens' second child, named for Mary Hogarth. She never married and remained with Dickens until his death. She helped to edit her father's letters and published two books about her father: Charles Dickens By His Eldest Daughter (1885) and My Father as I Recall Him (1896) (Schlicke, 1999, p. 91).\n\nKate Macready (Katie) Dickens (1839-1929) Dickens' third child, named for Dickens' friend actor William Macready. She had a talent for art and attended Bedford college (Hawksley, 2013, p. 77-78). She sided with her mother in the separation of her parents and married artist Charles Collins, brother of Dickens' friend Wilkie Collins. She later admitted that she married to get away from what had become an unhappy home (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 874-877). When Collins, sickly for years, died she married artist Carlo Perugini. She later revealed her father's relationship with Ellen Ternan in Gladys Storey's book Dickens and Daughter (Schlicke, 1999, p. 91). In 1860 Katie posed for artist John Everett Millais' painting The Black Brunswicker. Katie's grave.\n\nAmazon.com: Charles Dickens' Favorite Daughter: The Life, Loves, and Art of Katey Dickens Perugini\n\nWalter Savage Landor Dickens (1841-1863) - Dickens' fourth child named for English poet Walter Savage Landor.

He died of an aortic aneurysm in Calcutta (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 943). Having fallen deeply in debt while in India, his debts were sent home to his father (Davis, 1999, p. 105).\n\nFrancis Jeffrey (Frank) Dickens (1844-1886) - Dickens' fifth child named for Dickens' friend Lord Francis Jeffrey, editor of the Edinburgh Review. He went to India in 1864 where he found his brother Walter had been dead a month. He joined the Bengal Mounted Police, returned to England in 1871, the year after his father's death. He squandered his inheritance and later went to Canada where he joined the Canadian Northwest Mounted Police. He died in Moline, Illinois (Schlicke, 1999, p. 91).\n\nAlfred D'Orsay Tennyson Dickens (1845-1912) - Dickens' sixth child named for French artist Count Alfred D'Orsay and English poet Alfred Lord Tennyson.

He got into debt, asking his father for financial aid which Dickens finally refused. He died at sea aboard the Malta (Schlicke, 1999, p. 91).\n\nHenry Fielding (Harry) Dickens (1849-1933) - Dickens' eighth child named for English author Henry Fielding. Henry, educated at Cambridge, was the most successful of Dickens children (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 1033-1034). He became a lawyer, judge, and was knighted in 1922. Later he performed readings of his father's works and published books on Dickens' life (Schlicke, 1999, p. 91).\n\nDora Annie Dickens (1850-1851) - Dickens' ninth child was born during the writing of David Copperfield and was named for David's wife (Slater, 2009, p. 312). A sickly child, she died at eight months old (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 627-628).\n\nEdward Bulwer Lytton (Plorn) Dickens (1852-1902) - Dickens' 10th child and named for English Novelist and Dickens' friend Edward Bulwer-Lytton. He joined his brother Alfred in Australia at 16 years of age (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 1032-1033). He became a Member of Parliament in New South Wales, never returning to England (Schlicke, 1999, p. 91). Plorn is the subject of a novel by Thomas Keneally, The Dickens Boy.\n\nBack to Top\n\nCatherine Dickens' Sisters\n\nCatherine Hogarth was one of ten children. Two of her sisters figure prominently in Dickens' life:\n\nMary Hogarth (1819-1837) - Catherine's sister moved into the Dickens household in 1836, shortly after the marriage (Johnson, 1952, p. 130). At 17 she took ill after attending the theater and died suddenly in Dickens' arms. Dickens was shattered and took a ring from her finger which he wore the rest of his life (Slater, 2009, p. 100). She was the model for Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop and many others (Pugh, 1912, p. 68). Dickens wrote the epitaph which appears on her gravestone: \"Young, beautiful, and good, God numbered her among his angels at the early age of seventeen\" (Johnson, 1952, p. 197). Mary's grave.\n\nGeorgina Hogarth (1827-1917) - Catherine's sister joined the Dickens home at age 15, helping to run the household and raise the children (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 337). She remained with Dickens after the breakup of his marriage in 1858 prompting scandalous rumors. After Dickens' death in 1870 she remained devoted to his children and worked to retain the integrity of Dickens' reputation (Schlicke, 1999, p. 270-272). Georgina's grave.\n\nBack to Top\n\nCharles Dickens' Friends and Associates\n\nWilliam Harrison Ainsworth (1805-1882) English novelist (Rookwood, Jack Sheppard) and influence on young Dickens. Ainsworth brought Dickens into his literary circle that included Forster, Thackeray, and Carlyle (Schlicke, 1999, p. 6).\n\nHans Christian Andersen (1805-1875) Danish writer and author of Fairy Tales. Dickens and Andersen admired each others work. Andersen visited Dickens at Gads Hill in 1857 and overstayed his welcome (he was there for 5 weeks) after which the friendship waned. Dickens' daughter Kate later wrote that Andersen was \"a bony bore and stayed on and on\" (Slater, 2009, p. 429).\n\nMaria Beadnell (1810-1886) Youngest daughter of a London banker. Dickens fell in love with Maria in 1829 and courted her unsuccessfully for 4 years as Maria's parents objected to the relationship (Slater, 2009, p. 33-39). In 1855 Maria, now Mrs Henry Winter, contacted Dickens and his infatuation with Maria was briefly rekindled...until they met and he saw that the matronly Mrs Winter was not the Maria of his imagination. Indeed, she \"had become very fat! and quite commonplace\" (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 724-729). Dickens based Dora Spenlow (David Copperfield) and Flora Finching (Little Dorrit) on Maria (Pugh, 1912, p. 43).\n\nThomas Beard (1807-1891) Journalist and Dickens' oldest friend. Dickens and Beard were reporters together at the Morning Chronicle and Beard was best man at Dickens wedding. Beard's younger brother Francis was Dickens' personal physician and was with him when he died (Davis, 1999, p. 23).\n\nRichard Bentley (1794-1871) Early Dickens publisher and owner of Bentley's Miscellany where Dickens published Oliver Twist and served as editor. Their stormy relationship ended in 1840 when Dickens bought out of his contract and purchased the rights to Oliver Twist (Schlicke, 1999, p. 35-38).\n\nWilliam Bradbury (1800-1869) Partner in Bradbury and Evans, Dickens' printers when he was published by Chapman and Hall, and then his publisher when he broke with Chapman and Hall in 1844. Dickens then broke with Bradbury and Evans in 1858 when they refused to print his explanation for the separation with Catherine in their magazine, Punch (Davis, 1999, p. 42).\n\nHablot Knight Browne (Phiz) (1815-1882) Dickens' major illustrator through most of his career. Browne took over the illustration of The Pickwick Papers after the suicide of Robert Seymour. Browne and Dickens developed an excellent working relationship and Browne took the nickname Phiz to complement Dickens' Boz. Browne would go on to illustrate Dickens' work for 24 years (Slater, 2009, p. 72). Dickens association with Browne cooled after the somewhat disappointing illustrations for A Tale of Two Cities. He never worked for Dickens again (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 941).\n\nEdward Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873) English novelist and playwright (Paul Clifford-It was a dark and stormy night...(Schlicke, 1999, p. 63)) who, with Dickens, founded the Guild of Literature and Art (Slater, 2009, p. 319-320). It was Bulwer-Lytton who persuaded Dickens to change the ending of Great Expectations from one where Pip and Estella part, to one where they apparently live happily ever after (Johnson, 1952, p. 968-969).\n\nAngela Burdett-Coutts (1814-1906) Wealthy philanthropist for whom Dickens helped to find suitable charitable projects such as Urania Cottage, a home for homeless women (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 494), and support for the Field Lane Ragged School, which provided education to the very poor (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 404-405).\n\nThomas Carlyle (1795-1881) Scottish novelist and historian (History of the French Revolution), and a major influence, and close friend of Dickens. Dickens used Carlyle's work on the French Revolution as background for A Tale of Two Cities (Goldberg, 1972, p. 101).\n\nEdward Chapman (1804-1880) Partner in Dickens publisher Chapman and Hall. Chapman was the more literary of the partners and it was he who originated the idea to issue The Pickwick Papers in monthly parts, a method which Dickens used throughout his career and contributed to his success (Schlicke, 1999, p. 70).\n\nFrederic Chapman (1823-1895) Cousin of Edward Chapman with whom he partnered after the death of William Hall in 1847. He took over the business when Edward retired in 1866. After Dickens' death in 1870 Chapman secured the copyrights to all of Dickens' works (Schlicke, 1999, p. 73-74).\n\nWilkie Collins (1824-1889) English novelist and journalist whom Dickens met in 1851.

Cruikshank also acted in Dickens' amateur theatrical company (Ackroyd, 1990, p. 532). Their friendship cooled when Cruikshank, formerly a heavy drinker, became a fanatical teetotaler in opposition to Dickens' views of moderation (Patten, 1992, p. 228-229).

Dickens enjoyed Eliot's first fiction, Scenes of Clerical Life, recognizing immediately that it was written by a woman (Hughes, 1999, p. 189). Dickens approached Eliot for a piece for his weekly, All the Year Round, in 1859 which Eliot had to decline due to other obligations (Hughes, 1999, p. 211).
