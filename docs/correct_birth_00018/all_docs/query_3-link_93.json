        "text": "Charles Dickens was born in Portsmouth in 1812. He had an unhappy childhood due to his father's imprisonment for debt and his subsequent obligation to work in a factory at the age of 12. However, when his family's finances improved and his father was released, he was sent to a school in London. At the age of 15, he found employment as an office boy at a lawyer's and studied shorthand at night. By 1832, he had become a very successful shorthand reporter of parliamentary debates in the House of Commons, and also worked as a reporter for a newspaper. In 1833, his first story appeared, and in 1836 he adopted the pen name of \"Boz\" and published \"Sketches by Boz,\" a collection of articles and tales describing London's people and scenes for the periodical Monthly Magazine. In the same year, he married Catherine Hogarth and published the second part of Sketches by Boz. After the success of the Pickwick Papers, he started a full-time career as a novelist, producing work of increasing complexity, while also continuing his journalistic and editorial activities. His notable works include Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, and Little Dorrit, which became symbols of the exploitation of children in the face of the bitter realities of slums and factories.\n\nCharles Dickens: Childhood\n\nCharles Dickens had an unhappy childhood, marked by his father's imprisonment and his own obligation to work in a factory at a young age. Despite these challenges, he continued his education and eventually became a successful writer and journalist.\n\nCharles Dickens: Family Life\n\nIn 1836, Dickens married Catherine Hogarth, and they had several children together. Despite his unhappy childhood, Dickens went on to have a successful family life of his own.\n\nCharles Dickens: Novels and Social Commentary\n\nDickens was known for his depictions of Victorian society, particularly within the city of London. He explored social issues such as poverty, exploitation of children, and the conditions of the poor and working-class. His novels aimed to shed light on these issues and prompt the ruling classes to become more aware of social problems without offending his readers.\n\nCharles Dickens: Writing Style\n\nDickens's writing style was rich and original, characterized by long lists of objects and people, the use of adjectives in pairs or groups, and the introduction of sensational events to keep readers engaged. His novels often featured children as central characters, illustrating the harsh realities they faced in Victorian society.\n\nCharles Dickens: Legacy\n\nCharles Dickens died in 1870 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.
