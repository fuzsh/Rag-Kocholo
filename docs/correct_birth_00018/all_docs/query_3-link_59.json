        "text": "Background\n\nPublished in 1859, A Tale of Two Cities is an example of a serial novel, a novel published in installments over a period of time. The novel was first published in weekly installments and again later in monthly installments.\n\nCover of the serial volume of A Tale of Two Cities with artwork by Hablot Knight Browne, known as Phiz, who illustrated many of Dickensâs works.\n\nFears that England might be heading toward a revolution like the French Revolution persisted into the Victorian Era. Literary references to these fears appear in many 19th-century works including Wildeâs The Importance of Being Earnest; Barrett Browningâs âThe Cry of the Children,â Shelleyâs âMen of England,â and Byronâs Don Juan.\n\nThe passage of Reform Bills in 1832, 1867, and 1884 to extend voting rights evidences the discontent of the previously disenfranchised working class and the unease of the upper classes who feared open rebellion.\n\nSetting\n\nâChapter 1 The Periodâ begins with these well-known lines:\n\nIt was the best of times,\n\nit was the worst of times,\n\nit was the age of wisdom,\n\nit was the age of foolishness,\n\nit was the epoch of belief,\n\nit was the epoch of incredulity,\n\nit was the season of Light,\n\nit was the season of Darkness,\n\nit was the spring of hope,\n\nit was the winter of despairâ¦\n\nAlthough these lines do little to depict the actual setting, they provide a hint of the contrasts the novel develops, contrasts of normal life and the Reign of Terror, innocence and guilt, life and death. Dickens makes the lines poetic and memorable with the use of literary devices:\n\nAnaphoraLines which begin with the same word or phrase.. Lines which begin with the same word or phrase (it was, it was, it wasâ¦)\n\nAsyndetonDeletion of conjunctions between sentences or clauses.. Deletion of conjunctions between sentences or clauses\n\nParallelismThe use of the same grammatical structure for ideas of equal importance.. The use of the same grammatical structure for ideas of equal importance\n\nParadoxThe juxtaposition of seemingly contradictory ideas.. The juxtaposition of seemingly contradictory ideas\n\nTo introduce the period in which the novel is set, Chapter 1 moves from these lines to more specific paragraphs which establish the places (Paris and London), the time (1775), and the atmosphere (foreboding). The last lines of Chapter 1 refer to the road of destiny and provide a transition to a literal road: the mail on the road to Dover. And thus the story begins."
