        "text": "My accountant, Chris Stolborg, told me about John Pounds and said his story was inspirational. So, one fine day, I ventured out to the High Street in Old Portsmouth to the Unitarian Chapel named in his honour to find out more. Walking down the side of the church, I caught sight of a memorial to John Pounds…\n\nIn this second post on the National Trust’s beautiful estate of Box Hill let’s take another look at Box Hill and look at what else there is to do, if you can bear to drag yourself away from those amazing views over rolling countryside. If you take the Hill Top Stroll from the summit you will come…\n\nThe Pioneer Statue is located on Broad Street, Old Portsmouth close on the water side to one of the old Sally Ports. It was presented to the City of Portsmouth by The Pioneer Heritage Foundation on 27th August 2001 to act as a “permanent legacy to the commitment of the Europeans who courageously left their…\n\nMy mother grew up on The Hard – her grandmother ran her own pub there – now sadly gone, destroyed in WWII.

It’s wonderful to hear therefore that a statue to this literary master will be unveiled in the city of his birth at Portsmouth’s Guildhall Square…\n\nFor my first post, I thought it appropriate to write about arguably Portsmouth‘s most famous son, Charles Dickens, as we share the same birthdate, 7th February.
