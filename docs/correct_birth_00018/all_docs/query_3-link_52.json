        "text": "Charles Dickens is one of Britain's most famous authors.\n\nHis writing includes books such as Oliver Twist and A Christmas Carol - books that are still very widely read today.\n\nHe wrote about things that many people before him had avoided writing about, like the lives of poorer people.\n\nHe died in 1870, making 2020 the 150th anniversary of his death, so we thought we'd take a look at who Charles Dickens was, and why his books were so influential.\n\nCharles John Huffam Dickens was born in 1812, in Portsmouth on England's south coast, and was one of eight children. His family moved around though, and he grew up in London and Kent.\n\nWhen Charles was 12 his father was sent to prison because of financial problems. This meant Charles had to go to work, and he got a job at a shoe polish factory pasting the labels on to bottles.\n\nBut his most famous work is probably A Christmas Carol. It was first published just before Christmas in 1843, and its first print of 6,000 copies sold out in just 8 days.\n\nThe story of Ebenezer Scrooge learning about the spirit of Christmas is still well known and the BBC made a new television adaptation of it just last year.\n\nOliver Twist was turned into a musical that is still being performed now, and there have been several film versions of Great Expectations.\n\nAway from television adaptations and stage shows, many people still read his books. They have never been 'out-of-print,' which means, even all these years later, book shops are selling enough copies to need new ones printed.\n\nMany of his characters were based on real people and their lives. That made people understand his stories more, and reflect on what Britain was like at that time.\n\nHe was often challenging and spoke out about laws he didn't agree on, especially the 'new poor law,' a law the British Library describes as an attempt to, \"slash expenditure on poverty.\" Dickens thought the law was harsh, and that poor people needed help, not to be forced to work in awful conditions in factories.\n\nCharles Dickens was a journalist when the law was being introduced and worked hard to make sure newspapers told people what was happening in parliament. He went on to use his books to speak out about the system and promoted change - and it worked."
