        "text": "The Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum is the birthplace of the famous scholar. In this house, where his parents moved in 1809, Charles Dickens was born on February 7, 1812, when the British navy was still at war with Napoleonic France. Inside the museum house, the furniture, ceramics, glass, household items and decorations have been faithfully recreated in the Regency style. Unfortunately, their actual assets have long since been lost. There are three furnished rooms: the sitting room, the dining room and the bedroom where Charles was born. The exhibition hall houses an exhibition on Charles Dickens and Portsmouth, as well as a small collection of memorabilia: the sofa he died on at his home in Kent, along with the snuffbox, inkwell and letter opener."
