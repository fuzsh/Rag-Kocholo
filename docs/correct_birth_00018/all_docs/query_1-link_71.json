        "text": "Today I leave you with a colorized photograph of the man who is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. Charles Dickens wrote a number of great books, including \"David Copperfield\" and \"A Tale of Two Cities”. He became famous for his writing and observation of Victorian society, heavily influenced and inspired by the difficulties he faced in his childhood.\n\nThis short biography gives you great insight into the life of one of the giants of British literature.\n\nPlus, at the end of this article, the latest news in the History world.\n\nPrint available\n\n“Dickens was born Charles John Huffam Dickens on February 7, 1812, in Portsmouth, on the southern coast of England. The famed British author was the second of eight children. His father, John Dickens, was a naval clerk who dreamed of striking it rich. Charles' mother, Elizabeth Barrow, aspired to be a teacher and school director.\n\nDespite his parents’ best efforts, the family remained poor. Nevertheless, they were happy in the early days. In 1816, they moved to Chatham, Kent, where young Dickens and his siblings were free to roam the countryside and explore the old castle at Rochester.\n\nIn 1822, the Dickens family moved to Camden Town, a poor neighborhood in London. By then the family’s financial situation had grown dire, as John Dickens had a dangerous habit of living beyond the family’s means. Eventually, John was sent to prison for debt in 1824, when Charles was just 12 years old.”\n\nRead More\n\nWhat is your favorite Dickens’ book, and why?
