The Georgian-style building in Portsmouth, Hampshire exudes heritage and history, with its charming railings and traditional architecture. Painted by landscape artist Alfred Robert Quinton for J. Salmon publishing company, this artwork beautifully depicts the quaint street where Dickens was born. The attention to detail in Quinton's painting brings to life the essence of 19th century England, transporting viewers back in time to when Dickens himself walked these very streets. Published between 1912 and 1919 as a local view postcard, this image has stood the test of time as a timeless piece of art capturing a significant moment in literary history. The original watercolour painting showcases Quinton's talent for capturing the beauty and character of English landscapes. As we gaze upon this historic scene, we are reminded of the enduring legacy left behind by Charles Dickens and his contributions to literature. This print serves as a window into the past, allowing us to glimpse into the world that inspired one of Britain's greatest storytellers.\n\nMADE IN AUSTRALIA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
