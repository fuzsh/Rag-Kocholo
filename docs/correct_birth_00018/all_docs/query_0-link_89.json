The image portrays the house located at 393 Old Commercial Road in Portsmouth, Hampshire, which was the birthplace of Dickens (formerly numbered as 387). Dickens was born on February 7, 1812, in this modest dwelling during the Victorian era. The photograph offers a glimpse into the past, providing us with a sense of connection to the early life of this brilliant writer. The house, with its simple facade and quaint appearance, stands as a testament to the humble beginnings of a man who would go on to create some of the most memorable characters and stories in literature. The photograph, taken over a century ago, invites us to reflect on the rich history of this iconic figure and the enduring impact of his works on the literary world.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
