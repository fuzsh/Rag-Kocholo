        "text": "There is no escaping the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on the arts and heritage sector. In fact a report from the University of Sheffield published in November 2021 found the sector suffered from a 60 per cent decline in output due to social distancing rules and lockdowns.\n\nPortsmouth's rich museum culture was not immune to this, with beloved tourist attractions like the Royal Charles Dickensâ€™ Birthplace Museum, the National Museum of the Royal Navy and Southsea Castle all shutting their doors to the public in 2020. Whilst removal of coronavirus restrictions over the past months has allowed many to reopen, this has been limited as curators tried to limit public interaction.\n\nBut now two of the city's best-loved museums are fully reopening for the spring season. The Royal Charles Dickensâ€™ Birthplace Museum and Southsea Castle, as well as the cafÃ© at Portsmouth Museum and Art Gallery will re-open this month.\n\nREAD MORE: Alan Titchmarsh to host Queen's Platinum Jubilee ITV broadcast alongside Tom Cruise and Bridgerton star\n\nThe Royal Charles Dickensâ€™ Birthplace Museum on Old Commercial Road is where the Victorian author was born on February 7, 1812. Much of the furniture, ceramics, glass, household objects and decorations that he would have used have been recreated in the Regency style of the time.\n\nBut amongst the real treasures are the couch on which Dickens died at his house in Kent, his snuff-box, his inkwell and his paper knife. Since the pandemic, visitors have had to reserve places and only small groups have been allowed to attend.\n\nHowever, from May 21 people will be able to visit without booking in advance when it opens on selected Saturdays or Sundays between 10am and 5pm. Even better, admission is free for all Portsmouth residents and only Â£4.50 for adults from elsewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, the site at Southsea Castle will be fully open, with visitors now able to explore the keep, the ramparts and the courtyard where the popular restaurant will also be open.\n\nThe castle was built in 1544 by Henry VIII, who was in Portsmouth when the flagship Mary Rose sank. The building served as an active military base for over 400 years. The castle is free to visit, and is open Tuesday to Sunday, 10am to 5pm."
