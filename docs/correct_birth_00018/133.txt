EDITORS COMMENTS

This photograph, taken in 1903, captures the humble abode where Charles Dickens, one of the greatest authors in English literature, began his journey into the world. The image portrays the house located at 393 Old Commercial Road in Portsmouth, Hampshire, which was the birthplace of Dickens (formerly numbered as 387). Dickens was born on February 7, 1812, in this modest dwelling during the Victorian era. The photograph offers a glimpse into the past, providing us with a sense of connection to the early life of this brilliant writer. The house, with its simple facade and quaint appearance, stands as a testament to the humble beginnings of a man who would go on to create some of the most memorable characters and stories in literature. The photograph, taken over a century ago, invites us to reflect on the rich history of this iconic figure and the enduring impact of his works on the literary world.
