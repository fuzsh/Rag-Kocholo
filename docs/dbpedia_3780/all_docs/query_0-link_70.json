        "text": "The research of the perception and images of Arabs in Israeli society and in the State of Israel is one of the keys to understanding the Israeli־Arab conflict. One of the discoveries available to the historian researching the historical development of images are literary works, and novels in particular, as a source of prevailing perceptions for addressing this issue through time. The unique sensitivity of the writer as observing the 'Zeitgeist' (\"spirit of the times\"), documenting world views and images of his or her generation, creates moving texts which often provide far more significant perspective than customary historical sources. In recent years, many novels engaged the Israeli־Arab conflict were published. From this great selection, this article focus on three novels written by some of the most famous and important Israeli writers of recent times: Amos Oz's A Tale of Love and Darkness (Keter, 2007); David Grossman's Until the End of the Land (HaKibbutz Ha'Meuchad, 2008); Yoram Kaniuk's 1948 (Yediot Achronot, Sifrei Hemed, 2010). All these books are very popular, sold in great numbers and translated to several other languages. The three books together portray a broad attempt to embrace the Israel־Arab conflict, which is already 130 years old. The books contain biographical material and reflect the author's personal experiences All three aspire, to an extent, to engage in the self־criticism of Israeli society. In the research of the above-mentioned novels, this article uses the fruit of the historiography discourse and rely on three major approaches: New Historicism, Neo Cultural History and History of Sensibility. Three basic concepts - \"Image\", \"enemy\" and \"Threat\" were used in the analysis of the images and for drawing conclusions. Surprisingly, the three novels express very pessimistic mood about the chances of peace between Israel and the Arabs. Despite the fact that the three novelists are devoted supporters of peace, they express deep fears and strangeness towards the Palestinians, the Arabs and the surrounding Muslim world. The Israeli society, according to these novels, is more aware than ever before to the subjective integrity of the Arab and Palestinian narrative, and at the same time lost the feeling of destination and justice that motivated it in the first decades. After Rabin's assassination and the stagnation of the Oslo process, Israel, according to the images in these novels, is in a double deadlock because of the severe internal disagreements and the continuous deep fears of external threats of the Palestinians, the Arab states and the Muslim world.\n\nBefore immigrating to Israel, first-generation Iraqi Jews were deeply attached to their identity as Mizrahi Jews. Their mother tongue was Arabic and they had grown up in an oriental environment. Therefore, it was not easy for them to adopt the Euro-Israeli identity that the dominant Ashkenazi-European stratum in Israel compelled them to accept. Despite strong Westernizing tendencies in Israeli society, the first generation of Iraqi Jewish immigrants maintained strong links to the Iraqi customs and traditions they had acquired in Iraq, particularly with regard to the musical folklore and oriental cuisine. On the other hand, second-generation Iraqi Jews were more familiar with Israeli society than their parents; they grew up in Israel and learned Hebrew in Israeli schools along with Ashkenazi Jews and other ethnic groups. This paper establishes connections between the historical realities of Iraqi Jewish immigrants and the literary representation of their world in the trilogy Tel-Aviv Mizrah (Tel Aviv East) written in 2003 by the Iraqi Jewish author Shimon Ballas, through a comparison of Ballas's literary vision with the historical realities of Iraqi Jewish identity in Israel over the course of two generations.\n\nOver the last ten years, a topic that had been previously skirted in the public sphere of Arab countries has been broached, namely, the expulsion and departure of the Jewish population from these countries.When writers had addressed this phenomenon in the past, they did so only in the context of the Palestinian/ Arab-Israeli conflict. The history of the Jews living in Arab countries (Arab Jews)2 has been dominated by an official nationalistic discourse that has rarely been questioned (Abdulhaq 2016, 7–48). This discourse consists of two parts, one Arab and the other Zionist. Both reject considering Jews as an organic component of the society in which they live. Arab discourse connects Jewish life to Israel and hence to the Palestinian/Arab-Israeli conflict. A new generation of authors and film makers is questioning this discourse, through novels mainly and, to a lesser degree, through non-fiction works, with consequences extending beyond the Palestinian/Arab-Israeli conflict. The ce...\n\nThis dissertation was submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the MA Israeli Studies, SOAS, University of London. This dissertation analyses the relationship between young Jewish intellectuals and activists of Middle Eastern and North African descent (mizraḥim) and broader Israeli society. In particular, it seeks to understand the ways in which younger mizraḥim think about their relationship(s) with Zionism, with Israel’s geographical neighbours and, especially, with what it means to be mizraḥi and Israeli in contemporary Israel. Intertwined with these questions are a number of historical, socio-political and cultural issues; consequently, this dissertation draws upon a theoretical framework integrating both the literature on ‘Arab Jews’ in relation to modern mizrahi identity and older visions of a more inclusive Israeli Levantine polity. It explores the above through an ethnographic exposition of components of a young mizraḥi (or, as the dissertation will argue, Levantine) identity. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with mizraḥi activists young and old, the paper will discuss activism through cultural production, the use of Arabic, the relationship with Zionism and efforts to engage with Israel’s immediate environs.\n\nSocial consciousness forms in allegiance with the moral and political hegemonic power structures. Gramsci's organic ideology defines this condition of hegemonic system where societal leadership is practised by the dominant class. With the emergence of cultural studies the prevailing hegemonic discourses are challenged, but defining liminality in this spectrum is still an ongoing process. In this context, the essay aims to demarcate the problematic aspects of personal and national identities against the hegemonic power structures, specifically with the case of the Arab minority in the State of Israel. Apart from the fundamental facets of hegemony, the aberrant conflict between nationalism and citizenship emerging from Israel's legitimacy as a Jewish democratic State, places the Arab Israeli identity in question. These arguments are validated through the fictional life narrative of Israel's prominent Arab writer Sayed Kashua. His novel Dancing Arabs (2002) recapitulates the reality of being an Arab in Israel. The impeccable representation of identities in question hinges the repercussions of hegemony and social exclusion on both subjective and national levels. Standing on the critical platforms of Gramsci's political theory of \"hegemony\" and Stuart Hall's cultural theory of \"identity\", the text is closely read as an artefact of resistance with emphasis on personal, political and philosophical discourses on the identity of the Arab minority in Israel. The essay traverses through the ethnocentric status of Israel's social structure which disorders the recognition of Arab identity and identifies the conflict as a potential hindrance to peaceful coexistence in Israel's near future.
