        "text": "Israeli Premier League: Switching Places is All About Timing\n\nThe Israeli Premier League‚Äôs most critical player in the next rounds is not a footballer, but the schedule, which can be decisive for the championship battle.\n\nThis week Maccabi Tel Aviv played first, knowing that a win against Hapoel Kfar Saba can give them the lead for at least 48 hours.\n\nHapoel Kfar Saba is lying on the bottom of the table, and it didn't seem that they thought they had any chance to make something against the reigning champions. Kfar Saba made only a single shot to the goal, allowing Maccabi Tel Aviv to take the dominance on the field easily. They didn't convert it to many goals, but they still managed to score one goal to win the match. Aleksandar Pe≈°iƒá continued with his incredible run, scoring the winning goal in the 41st minute. With eight goals this season, the Serbian is one of Maccabi Tel Aviv's key players until now.\n\nMaccabi Tel Aviv can prepare now for their next challenge, a home match against Shakhtar Donetsk in the Europa League round of 32.\n\nBack from The Fight\n\nMaccabi Haifa had to win to retain the first place. They had a busy week, as they had to deal with the consequences of the Haifa derby brawl. As the FA Disciplinary Committee hasn't punished the players yet, none of them was suspended for their match against Beitar Jerusalem.\n\nDolev Haziza, the ‚ÄúIsraeli Hakim Ziyech‚Äù, had another great match, scoring Maccabi Haifa's first goal in the 17th minute. In the second half, Beitar Jerusalem made any possible mistake. It began in the 50th minute with a missing ball that led to a goal by Tjaronn Chery. Three minutes later, Tal Ben Haim tried to play a quick free-kick but accidentally passed it to Neta Lavi, who assisted to Godsway Donyoh, that scored.\n\nThis 3-0 win worth another week on the top for Maccabi Haifa, before the possible suspensions after the derby. Beitar Jerusalem is looked depressed and hopeless, as they are still far from reaching the championship group.\n\n◊ô◊©◊©◊©üíö‚öΩ‚öΩ‚öΩüíö\n\nPosted by ‚Äé◊û◊ï◊¢◊ì◊ï◊ü ◊õ◊ì◊ï◊®◊í◊ú ◊û◊õ◊ë◊ô ◊ó◊ô◊§◊î Maccabi Haifa FC‚Äé on Monday, 15 February 2021\n\nHapoel Be'er Sheva Missed Again\n\nOn the other side of Haifa, Hapoel Haifa also tried to recover from the derby incident. They hosted Hapoel Be'er Sheva for an early Saturday afternoon match.\n\nAfter the harsh defeat against FC Ashdod, Hapoel Be'er Sheva seemed to be much better. In the 23rd minute, Tomer Yosefi scored the first, and five minutes later, Rotem Hatuel scored the second. There was a feeling that they will keep this lead, but the problems in Be'er Sheva's defensive line were so clear, as almost all the players were substitutes. Nisso Kapiloto scored for the home side in the 75th minute, and William Agada tied the score in the 81st minute. Hapoel Haifa almost won the match with a chance in the stoppage time, but they can be totally proud of the draw and comeback they made in the end.\n\nIt's the third time this season that Hapoel Haifa is coming back from a two-goal deficit to a draw or a win. It might be important in the next matches, as they are trying to reach the championship group. Hapoel Be'er Sheva is playing better but still missing chances to win. The club's current main issue might be the absence of a manager, as Elyaniv Barda decided not to continue as a caretaker.\n\nThumbnail photo by Maccabi Haifa FC.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\n\nEmail Address\n\nThank you!"
