        "text": "Who has won major titles since Wimbledon 2003 when Roger Federer won his first grand slam\n\nRoger Federer 19 (8 Wimbledon, 5 Australian Open, 5 US Open, 1 French Open)\n\nRafael Nadal 16 (10 French Open, 3 US Open, 2 Wimbledon, 1 Australian Open)\n\nNovak Djokovic 12 (6 Australian Open, 3 Wimbledon, 2 US Open, 1 French Open)\n\nAndy Murray 3 (2 Wimbledon, 1 US Open)\n\nStan Wawrinka 3 (1 Australian Open, 1 French Open, 1 US Open)\n\nAndy Roddick 1 (1 US Open)\n\nGaston Gaudio 1 (1 French Open)\n\nMarat Safin 1 (1 Australian Open)\n\nJuan Martin del Potro 1 (1 US Open)\n\nMarin Cilic 1 (1 US Open)\n\nThe internal combustion engine is facing a watershed moment – major manufacturer Volvo is to stop producing petroleum-powered vehicles by 2021 and countries in Europe, including the UK, have vowed to ban their sale before 2040. The National takes a look at the story of one of the most successful technologies of the last 100 years and how it has impacted life in the UAE.\n\nRead part four: an affection for classic cars lives on\n\nRead part three: the age of the electric vehicle begins\n\nRead part two: how climate change drove the race for an alternative\n\nReleased: 2017\n\nPeak chart position: No.1 in more than 47 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Lebanon\n\nViews: 5.3 billion on YouTube\n\nSales: With 10 million downloads in the US, Despacito became the first Latin single to receive Diamond sales certification\n\nStreams: 1.3 billion combined audio and video by the end of 2017, making it the biggest digital hit of the year.\n\nAwards: 17, including Record of the Year at last year’s prestigious Latin Grammy Awards, as well as five Billboard Music Awards\n\nDevesh Mamtani from Century Financial believes the cash-hoarding tendency of each generation is influenced by what stage of the employment cycle they are in. He offers the following insights:\n\nBaby boomers (those born before 1964): Owing to market uncertainty and the need to survive amid competition, many in this generation are looking for options to hoard more cash and increase their overall savings/investments towards risk-free assets.\n\nGeneration X (born between 1965 and 1980): Gen X is currently in its prime working years. With their personal and family finances taking a hit, Generation X is looking at multiple options, including taking out short-term loan facilities with competitive interest rates instead of dipping into their savings account.\n\nMillennials (born between 1981 and 1996): This market situation is giving them a valuable lesson about investing early. Many millennials who had previously not saved or invested are looking to start doing so now."
