        "text": "Abu Dhabi-based Arabic newspaper Al-Ittihad, part of Abu Dhabi Media, has partnered with The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to expand its readership across the MENA region. The new partnership will grant Al-Ittihad access to additional news stories, features, opinion pieces, videos and infographics to share in English and Arabic across its digital platforms. The collaboration will also see Al-Ittihad subscribers after January 19, 2018 enjoy a one-year subscription to access the digital edition of WSJ.\n\n“This strategic partnership between Abu Dhabi Media and The Wall Street Journal is in line with our efforts to reach a wider audience and to position us as the leading and most diversified media organisation in the UAE and the wider region,” says Ali Bin Tamim, Director General, Abu Dhabi Media.\n\nJonathan Wright, Global Managing Director, The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones, adds “Al-Ittihad continues to set the standard for Arabic-language news as the first and oldest newspaper in the region. This partnership enables us to deliver The Wall Street Journal’s world-class business, economic and political news and commentary to Al-Ittihad readers, reaching an even wider audience in the UAE. I look forward to seeing our collaboration with Abu Dhabi Media grow and mature as we move forward together.”"
