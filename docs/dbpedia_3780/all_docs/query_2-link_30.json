        "text": "As the summer transfer window kicks off in the coming weeks the prospect of household names moving to Saudi Arabia could become a regular feature.\n\nFollowing Cristiano Ronaldo's January move to Al Nassr, clubs from the Saudi Pro League have indicated their intention to bring more world class stars to the Middle East.\n\nReal Madrid captain Karim Benzema is the latest name linked with a switch to Saudi Arabia with current Saudi champions Al Ittihad leading the race to sign the Frenchman.\n\nWith Real Madrid confirming his exit, the veteran striker could be tempted by a new challenge.\n\nMORE: Saudi Pro League top scorers 2022-2023: Cristiano Ronaldo ranking in Golden Boot race\n\nWho are Al Ittihad?\n\nAl Ittihad are the joint second most successful team in Saudi Pro League history with their 2023 crown, at the expense of Ronaldo's Al Nassr, bringing them up to nine league titles overall.\n\nAl Hilal are unopposed as the dominant force in Saudi Arabian football, with 18 league titles, and four AFC Champions League trophies.\n\nHowever, Al Ittihad are determined to ensure they remain in touch with Al Hilal and Al Nassr in the coming years, with former Premier League boss Nuno Espirito Santo set to remain charge for the 2023/24 season.\n\nBased in the city of Jeddah, on the Red Sea coast, Al Ittihad are representative over the other side of Saudi Arabia, with a 950km stretch across the nation seperating themselves from Al Hilal/Al Nassr, in the capital Riyadh.\n\nWill Karim Benzema join Al Ittihad?\n\nBenzema's deal at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu expired at the end of June, and despite appearing to be close to agreeing a 12-month renewal, Al Ittihad's interest has changed the picture.\n\nReal Madrid were only willing to offer him another 12 months, as per their policy on players aged 30+, but Al Ittihad are willing to offer two years.\n\nOn June 4, Los Blancos announced the forward would be leaving the club.\n\nReports from the UK and Spain claim Al Ittihad are targeting Benzema as a marquee summer signing as Santo looks to ensure his team do not fall behind Al Nassr and Al Hilal.\n\nDespite already having Ronaldo in their ranks, Al Nassr are expected to strengthen in the coming weeks, with Al Hilal working on a free transfer swoop for Lionel Messi.\n\nReports from Diario AS claim Al Ittihad are looking to move quickly in their in interest in Benzema, as part of a Â£85m/$107m annual salary package to join them on a two-year contract. UK outlet The Independent are reporting Al Hilal will rival them with a similar bid, if they fail to land Messi.\n\nThe forward downplayed reports of a move to Saudi Arabai on Thursday when asked to discuss the speculation, saying: \"Speak about what? Why speaking of the future if I'm in Madrid... Who's speaking is internet, and reality is not internet.\"\n\nMORE: Highest-paid soccer players in 2022\n\nAl Ittihad history, trophies, former players\n\nAl Nassr were formed in 1927 and the club boasts the proud record of being the longest active sports club in Saudi Arabia.\n\nNine league titles puts them in front of every club in the country, aside from Al Hilal, and level with Al Nassr in the all time rankings.\n\nThe trio are the established forces in Saudi Arabian football, with 47 top-flight seasons each, followed by 46 for Al Shabab and Al Ahli.\n\nThat pattern of following Al Hilal in historic lists continues in the King Cup and the Saudi Crown Prince Cup, with nine compared to 13 and eight to 13.\n\nAl Ittihad have won two AFC Champions League titles, in 2004 and 2005, as one of just four clubs to defend their title in the competition.\n\nA potential move for Benzema would raise the profile of Al Ittihad on a global level, with former notable players not matching his profile.\n\nEx Premier League names including Wilfried Bony, Sulley Muntari and Titi Camara have enjoyed spells in Jeddah following a brief stints for 1994 World Cup duo Roberto Donadoni and Bebeto."
