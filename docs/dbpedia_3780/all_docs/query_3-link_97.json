        "text": "Arsenal: Leroy Sané\n\nWith David Raya making his loan from Brentford permanent, Riccardo Calafiori joining from Bologna, and Mikel Merino expected to arrive from Real Sociedad before too long, Arsenal should now turn their attention to strengthening the frontline. They have been linked with Pedro Neto and Nico Williams, but they should be targeting Leroy Sané. Mikel Arteta worked with Sané during their time together at Manchester City and the German’s versatility across the attack would appeal to the Arsenal manager. The 28-year-old finished second for assists (11), ninth for key passes (72) and top for dribbles (93) in the Bundesliga last season.\n\nAston Villa: João Félix\n\nAston Villa have been busy in the transfer market this summer but the departure of Moussa Diaby to Al-Ittihad leaves a hole in their frontline. Given the extra workload of playing in the Champions League, Unai Emery will not want Villa to be short of options in the attacking third. The manager needs a player who can play up front or behind Ollie Watkins. Joao Felix’s career is at a crossroads following the culmination of his loan spell with Barcelona. The Portugal international has seemingly burned his bridges with Atlético Madrid, which could open up the door for a summer move. Felix has Premier League experience after his six-month loan spell with Chelsea last year and, with Jhon Durán also linked with a move away, the 24-year-old may consider a move to Villa as the best way to resurrect his career.\n\nBournemouth: Cameron Archer\n\nBournemouth have already made a couple of notable additions this summer, signing Enes Unal on a permanent deal and capturing the promising centre-back Dean Huijsen from Juventus. They have a well balanced squad under Andoni Iraola and usually only dip into the market to replace outgoing players. With question marks over Dominic Solanke’s future – he has been linked to Tottenham – Bournemouth may be in the market for another striker. Cameron Archer could fit the bill. The 22-year-old has only just moved back to Aston Villa after a year on the books at Sheffield United, but they may be open to offers.\n\nBrentford: Arthur Cabral\n\nBack in February, Brentford announced that Igor Thiago would join them this summer from Club Brugge for a club-record £30m. However, disaster struck in pre-season when Thiago suffered a meniscus injury that required surgery and will keep him out of the action for the next few months. With Neal Maupay returning to Everton following his loan spell and Ivan Toney linked with a move away, Brentford may make a short-term move for a new forward this month. The Brazilian forward Arthur Cabral could be a good option. He was Fiorentina’s top scorer in the 2022-23 season before signing for Benfica last summer. The Portuguese club have brought in Vangelis Pavlidis this year, so Cabral may find playing time harder to come by. A move away could benefit both player and club.\n\nBrighton: Ferdi Kadioglu\n\nWith Pervis Estupinan ruled out until later this year with an ankle injury, Brighton may explore the prospect of signing another left-back. Turkish star Ferdi Kadioglu is believed to be on the club’s radar and for good reason. Kadioglu was one of Turkey’s stars of Euro 2024 as he followed up an impressive Super Lig campaign in fine fashion. Fenerbahce will be reluctant to lose the 24-year-old and will demand a hefty fee. Manchester United and Arsenal have previously been linked with a move for the versatile full-back, who would prove a fine addition for Brighton if they are able to convince Fenerbahce to sell.\n\nChelsea: Samu Omorodion\n\nWith Conor Gallagher on his way to Atlético Madrid – a move that is unlikely to sit well with Chelsea supporters – Samu Omorodion may now be heading the other way. The 20-year-old, who is currently representing his country at the Olympics, was linked with a move to Stamford Bridge earlier this summer and Chelsea will hope Atleti are now more keen to sell. The powerhouse striker scored more counterattacking goals (four) than any other player in La Liga last season. For context, Chelsea scored three in the Premier League. Could he be the answer to their long-standing striker conundrum?\n\nCrystal Palace: Maxence Lacroix\n\nCrystal Palace have a number of in-demand players on the books. Michael Olise has already departed for Bayern Munich, while Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi are subject to interest from Premier League sides. If Guehi signs for Newcastle, who are confident of securing him for around £60m, Palace are likely to dip into the market for a new centre-back. The French defender Maxence Lacroix, who only has a year to run on his contract at Wolfsburg, could be a smart signing, especially as the German club will not want to lose him on a free next year. Lacroix is able to glide out from defence and find a teammate from range, so could prove a shrewd replacement for Guehi if he departs.\n\nEverton: Kalvin Phillips\n\nThere is a gaping Amadou Onana-shaped hole in the Everton midfield following his departure to Aston Villa last month. Tim Iroegbunam has already gone the other direction, swapping Villa Park for Goodison Park, but Everton need more experience in the centre of midfield. Kalvin Phillips struggled during his loan spell with West Ham in the second half of last season, but the former Leeds man would prove a handy addition for Everton. He is an effective ball winner who has the requisite skillset to succeed in a Sean Dyche side. Crucially, he needs to rebuild his reputation and try to win back his England spot.\n\nFulham: Andre\n\nJust as Everton lost a key midfielder in Onana, so did Fulham when João Palhinha moved to Bayern Munich. Fulham have since spent big to sign Emile Smith Rowe from Arsenal but they need to add another body in the middle of the park to help move on from Palhinha. The Brazilian player Andre has been on their radar for some time now but a deal for the 23-year-old is yet to come to fruition. The Fluminense midfielder is not a like-for-like replacement for Palhinha but he is not afraid to get stuck in – as shown by his average of 2.2 tackles per 90 minutes in the Brasileirão this season. Andre is also impressive on the ball; he boasts the best pass success rate in the division (94.5%).\n\nIpswich Town: Jack Clarke\n\nIpswich have been active this summer but may not yet be done in the window, especially now that Nathan Broadhead has picked up a hamstring injury that will keep him out for the start of the season. Thankfully the Welsh forward will not need surgery but he will need some time to get up to speed. Broadhead was key in Ipswich’s promotion campaign and his absence is a blow. Jack Clarke stood out for Sunderland last season despite their disappointing campaign – he scored 15 goals and completed more dribbles (148) than any other player in the Championship."
