        "text": "The Saudi Pro League kicks off this weekend and it’s fair to say there has never been wider global interest in football in the Gulf state.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF) first made its mark on the football ecosystem in 2021, when it purchased 80 per cent of Newcastle United following a protracted saga with the Premier League.\n\nBut PIF’s biggest impact on football may yet be from its takeover of four of Saudi Arabia’s biggest clubs in June. The announcement came via the country’s ministry of sport as part of the ‘Saudi Vision 2030’ project and stated that PIF would now control 75 per cent of Al Hilal, Al Nassr, Al Ahli and Al Ittihad — four of the founding sides of the Saudi Pro League — with the other 25 per cent of those teams owned by non-profit organisations.\n\nThat injection of investment, coupled with the desire to become one of “the top 10 best leagues in the world”, has seen a host of big names swap Europe for Saudi Arabia this summer, with more potentially on the way.\n\nWe know that Cristiano Ronaldo is already there, and has been joined by the likes of Sadio Mane and Riyad Mahrez, but which other players have moved, and who is playing together?\n\nHere’s our guide to the 2023-24 Saudi Pro League season, how you can watch it, team profiles and why controversy lingers…\n\nSaudi Pro League — the opening fixtures\n\nNewly promoted First Division champions Al Ahli kick off the season on Friday, August 11, renewing rivalries against Al Hazem — whom they beat to the title by just four points — at the Prince Abdullah Al Faisal Stadium in Jeddah.\n\nBut plenty of eyes will be on Dammam on Monday as Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al Nassr — runners-up last season — start against Steven Gerrard’s new Al Ettifaq side.\n\nFriday, August 11\n\nAl Ahli vs Al Hazem (7pm BST)\n\nSaturday, August 12\n\nAl Tai vs Damac (4pm BST)\n\nAl Fai vs Al Khaleej (7pm BST)\n\nSunday, August 13\n\nAl Fateh vs Al Taawoun (7pm BST)\n\nAl Riyadh vs Al Wehda (7pm BST)\n\nMonday, August 14\n\nAbha vs Al Hilal (4pm BST)\n\nAl Raed vs Al Ittihad (4pm BST)\n\nAl Ettifaq vs Al Nassr (7pm BST)\n\nAl Shabab vs Al Okhdoud (7pm BST)\n\nWho has the rights to the Saudi Pro League?\n\nSubscription streaming channel DAZN will show games to UK audiences and a deal with FOX Sports has been struck for the U.S.\n\nDAZN will also show games in Canada, Germany, Austria and Belgium.\n\nCanal+ will broadcast games in France, with Sport TV providing coverage in Portugal, La 7 in Italy, and Marca.com in Spain.\n\nWhen does the transfer window close?\n\nThe Saudi Pro League transfer window doesn’t close until September 2o, per FIFA — far later than the majority of European countries where the deadline is September 1.\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp expressed concern over that later window in Saudi Arabia earlier this summer, saying: “Pretty much the worst thing I think is that the transfer window in Saudi Arabia is open three weeks longer.\n\n“At least in Europe, that’s not helpful.”\n\nWhy is the league controversial?\n\nThe league and its growth have been controversial for several reasons.\n\nIn terms of human rights, homosexuality is illegal in Saudi Arabia and LGBTQI+ and women’s rights are also limited.\n\nThe murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, at the Saudi embassy in the Turkish city of Istanbul in 2018, has also seen Saudi Arabia attract global criticism.\n\nAccording to a U.S. intelligence report, Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is deemed responsible for approving the operation that killed him. He has described these findings as flawed.\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International also reported last year that Saudi authorities have “targeted individuals for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association”, while “migrant workers continued to be abused and exploited under the sponsorship system and thousands were arbitrarily detained in inhumane conditions, tortured and otherwise ill-treated, and involuntarily returned to their home country as part of a nationwide crackdown on undocumented migrants”.\n\nThe Saudi Pro League – read more on The Athletic…\n\nInside Saudi Arabia’s plan to disrupt global football\n\nSaudi Arabia, football’s disruptors: The money, the motive, the hidden disputes\n\nSaudi Pro League team guide\n\nAl Hilal\n\nAl Hilal are the most successful team in Saudi history, having won the league title 18 times since its inception in 1976. They are based in Riyadh, the country’s capital, and played at the King Fahd International Stadium, the 68,000-seater ground which is also home to the Saudi Arabia men’s national team.\n\nJorge Jesus, the former Benfica and Sporting Lisbon coach, was installed as their new manager earlier this summer, joining compatriot Ruben Neves who had already signed from Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nBefore the PIF investment, Al Hilal’s squad was predominantly made up of domestic players — they had 12 representatives at the 2022 World Cup, all of whom were in the Saudi Arabia side. Fans of Watford and Portuguese football, though, may be familiar with Peruvian winger Andre Carrillo, who has played for Al Hilal since 2018. Former Porto striker Moussa Marega is also on their books and scored against Real Madrid in the Club World Cup final earlier this year, while ex-Manchester United and Watford forward Odion Ighalo left the club this summer.\n\nAs well as Neves, Al Hilal have also brought in Kalidou Koulibaly from Chelsea, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic from Lazio and former Barcelona winger Malcom from Zenit Saint Petersburg.\n\nThey also tabled a potential world-record €300million (£259m; $332m) transfer offer to Paris Saint-Germain for Kylian Mbappe, amid uncertainty surrounding the 24-year-old’s immediate future.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nThe mad thing is, €1billion for one year of Kylian Mbappe makes total sense\n\nAl Nassr\n\nAl Nassr entered the football mainstream last December with their sensational acquisition of Cristiano Ronaldo following his ignominious Manchester United exit. They are also based in Riyadh and have won nine Saudi Pro League titles.\n\nRudi Garcia left his role as head coach in April and has since been replaced by the Portuguese Luis Castro.\n\nFormer Arsenal and Napoli goalkeeper David Ospina has been their No 1 since last year and Brazilian forward Anderson Talisca joined in 2021. Luiz Gustavo, formerly of Bayern Munich, Wolfsburg and Marseille, left Al Nassr at the end of the season after a year at the club.\n\nAfter finishing second in the league last season, they have signed Lens midfielder Seko Fofana, Manchester United defender Alex Telles, Inter Milan midfielder Marcelo Brozovic and Bayern Munich forward Sadio Mane.\n\nAl Ahli\n\nJeddah-based Al Ahli were arguably the most interesting of the clubs PIF took control of in June, given they played in the Saudi second tier last season.\n\nThey suffered a shock relegation in 2022, having never played out of the Saudi Pro League before, and then won the First Division League last term.\n\nAl Ahli were managed by South African Pitso Mosimane last season and have now appointed highly-rated German coach Matthias Jaissle from Red Bull Salzburg to lead the team.\n\nLeeds United fans will recognise Ezgjan Alioski, who joined Al Ahli in 2021 but spent last season on loan at Fenerbahce, while Swansea City and Reading fans may be familiar with Gambian forward Modou Barrow, who signed in January.\n\nThis summer, Al Ahli have recruited heavily from Europe, with Frank Kessie, Allan Saint-Maximin, Edouard Mendy, Riyad Mahrez and Roberto Firmino joining the club.\n\nAl Ittihad\n\nAl Ittihad made the first real statement signing of the summer with the acquisition of Real Madrid captain Karim Benzema. They have since added N’Golo Kante from Chelsea, Jota from Celtic and Fabinho from Liverpool.\n\nFormer West Bromwich Albion defender Ahmed Hegazi captained the side to the league title last season, their ninth such honour and first since 2009.\n\nThey share the 62,000-capacity King Abdullah Sports City stadium with Al Ahli, but their biggest rivalry is perhaps with Al Hilal, which has been dubbed the ‘Saudi Clasico’.\n\nAl Ettifaq\n\nBased in Dammam, the fourth-biggest city in Saudi Arabia, Al Ettifaq were not one of the clubs PIF took control of in June but that has not stopped them from grabbing the headlines.\n\nThey sensationally appointed former Liverpool great Steven Gerrard as their new head coach, following that up by signing the Premier League side’s current captain, Jordan Henderson.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nJordan Henderson's potential Saudi move matters for a lot more reasons than hypocrisy\n\nAl Ettifaq finished seventh in the Saudi Pro League last season and have not won a major honour since the 1980s.\n\nThose with a keen interest in European football may recognise former Fenerbahce defender Marcel Tisserand and Sweden international Robin Quaison, who joined the side in 2022 and 2021 respectively.\n\nAs well as Henderson, Al Ettifaq have signed former Fulham and Lyon striker Moussa Dembele and Scotland international Jack Hendry to supplement their squad.\n\nAbha\n\nAbha have relatively little domestic pedigree but do boast a few names that will be familiar to fans of European football.\n\nFormer Manchester City and Lazio striker Felipe Caicedo joined last summer, while ex-PSG and West Brom midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak signed on a free transfer last month.\n\nAl Fateh\n\nAl Fateh won the Saudi Pro League as recently as the 2012-13 season, becoming the seventh side ever to do so. They have not won a league title since, though, and finished sixth last season.\n\nThey also have some recognisable names, including ex-Lyon and Celtic defender Jason Denayer, former Barcelona winger Cristian Tello and former West Ham and Watford head coach Slaven Bilic.\n\nAl Fayha\n\nAl Fayha were promoted to the Saudi Pro League for the first time in 2017 and finished 11th in the 2022-23 season.\n\nAl Khaleej\n\nAl Khaleej were newly promoted to the Saudi Pro League last season and recorded a 14th-placed finish.\n\nAl Akhdoud\n\nAl Akhdoud were one of the beneficiaries of the Saudi Pro League expansion for this coming season, having won promotion in 2022-23 after finishing third in the First Division League.\n\nAlex Collado, the former Barcelona winger, signed on loan from Real Betis earlier this summer.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nInside Saudi Arabia's plan to disrupt global football\n\nAl Raed\n\nAl Raed have played top-flight football since 2008 and finished 10th in the Saudi Pro League last season.\n\nAl Riyadh\n\nAl Riyadh won promotion to the top flight last season after finishing fourth in the First Division League.\n\nUruguay international goalkeeper Martin Campana was recruited earlier this summer.\n\nAl Shabab\n\nAl Shabab’s squad is headlined by the former Sevilla and Valencia midfielder Ever Banega, who has played there since 2020. South Korea No 1 Kim Seung-gyu joined the club last summer.\n\nThey are six-time Saudi Pro League winners and finished fourth last season.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWhat the Saudi Pro League's rise means for MLS\n\nAl Taawoun\n\nAl Taawoun finished fifth in the Saudi Pro League last season. They are managed by Brazilian Pericles Chamusca.\n\nAl Tai\n\nAl Tai finished ninth in the Saudi Pro League last term and have never won a top-flight title.\n\nAl Wehda\n\nAl Wehda finished 13th last season and are one of the only sides in the Saudi Pro League based in Mecca, the country’s third-largest city.\n\nDamac\n\nDutch football fans may be familiar with Damac’s Adam Maher, the once hotly-rated midfielder formerly of AZ and PSV.\n\nDamac finished eighth in the Saudi Pro League last season.\n\n(Top photos: Getty Images)"
