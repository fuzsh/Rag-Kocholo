They are all too often the unsung heroes of academic research. Thanks in particular go to Marlis Saleh and staff at the Joseph Regenstein Library at the University of Chicago, where this project originated. Thanks, too, go to Atifa Rawan and staff at the University of Arizona’s Main Library, where it was completed. During my research, I was aided by staff members at the Nami Jafet Memorial Library at the American University of Beirut, the Library of the Institute for Palestine Studies (Beirut), the National Library of Israel, the Peace Library at the Givat Haviva Institute, the Widener Library at Harvard University, and the Doe Memorial Library at the University of California, Berkeley. Mary Wilke at the Center for Research Libraries in Chicago facilitated the purchase of microfilm copies of the newspaper al-­Yawm, making it available to US-­based researchers for the first time. Over the last several years I have benefited immensely from the insights and generosity of Palestinian and Arab intellectuals who helped me sharpen my thinking and gave me new insights into the complex and nuanced conditions of the Palestinians inside the Green Line. My late uncle, historian and political thinker Ahmad Sidqi al-­Dajani, first opened my eyes to the intra-­Arab debates regarding this community. The late author Fouzi El-­Asmar generously shared with me his complete collection of al-­Fajr and al-­Ard, while Hanna Ibrahim graciously gave me his personal copy of his out-­of-­print memoir. Hanna Abu Hanna, Salem Jubran, and the other interviewees who shared their time, their memories, and often their books with me likewise made this book much richer in its details and insight. The University of Chicago and the University of Arizona have been my two main intellectual homes for nearly twenty years. At the University of Chicago, I benefited tremendously from the mentorship of Rashid Khalidi and Holly ix\n\nx ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nShissler, both of whom helped guide me through the early stages of this project. Fred Donner, Wadad Kadi, Ariela Finkelstein, and the late Farouk Mustafa sharpened further my analytical and translational skills. I also benefited from the intellectual environment provided by Rana Barakat, Abigail Jacobson, Mezna Qato, Roschanak Shaeri, and Rochdi Younsi. At the University of Arizona, my colleagues in the School of Middle Eastern and North African Studies (MENAS), including Anne Betteridge, Samira Farwaneh, Benjamin Fortna, Adel Gamal, Leila Hudson, Amy Newhall, Yaseen Noorani, Sonia Shiri, Charles Smith, and Kamran Talattof, have strengthened this work with their attentive questions, constructive feedback, and opportunities to share my work. I have also enjoyed enlightening conversations with Arizona colleagues Sama Alshaibi, Carine Bourget, Julia Clancy-­Smith, Faten Ghosn, Sandy Marshall, Brian Silverstein, and Ed Wright. The groundbreaking work of graduate students Britain Eakin, Brooke Lober, and Alex Karaman has furthered my thinking on important aspects of contemporary Palestine. My research has also benefited from institutional funding at the University of Arizona, in particular an SBSRI Research Professorship, a Junior Faculty Research Leave, and a Provost Author Support Fund award. And I will forever be grateful to the late Michael Bonine for his unwavering mentorship. Kate Wahl and Joel Beinin at Stanford University Press have provided wonderful support over the years. Their advice and suggestions, coupled with the incisive and meticulous comments of the two anonymous reviewers, were extraordinarily helpful in strengthening the arguments and fleshing out the details of this book. I have presented my research in a number of venues, including at the annual meetings of the Middle East Studies Association and the American Historical Association. The questions and comments I received there helped me think more deeply about my subject. The feedback I received from Beshara Doumani, Zachary Lockman, Ilan Pappé, and the other participants at the 2015 New Directions in Palestinian Studies symposium at Brown University was particularly valuable in helping me clarify the points I wanted to make. I have also benefited in ways both large and small from the incisive comments, questions, and help in tracking down sources provided by numerous friends and colleagues. They include Orit Bashkin, Amahl Bishara, Aomar Boum, Hamid Dabashi, Leena Dallasheh, Marda Dunsky, Ziad Fahmy, James Gelvin, Adina Hoffman, Ian Lustick, Norma Mendoza-­Denton, Ibrahim Muhawi, Shira Robinson, Sherene Seikaly, Yasir Suleiman, and Farzin Vejdani. I am especially grateful to Aomar\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS xi\n\nBoum, Benjamin Fortna, and Mezna Qato for reading and providing thoughtful feedback on the entire manuscript. Special thanks, too, go to Mezna for more than thirty years of friendship and for always pushing me to think more clearly and compassionately about what matters most. I am blessed to have the inspiration and support of my family. My parents, Tawfik Nassar and Khawla Dajani Nassar, nurtured my early fascination with all things Palestinian, and they encouraged me to pursue my academic studies accordingly. My siblings and their spouses—­Ida Nassar, Rochdi Younsi, Alaa Nassar, Dalia Qubbaj-­Nassar, Salma Nassar, and Basil Salem—­are refreshing sources of humor and sustenance. My cousin Omar Dajani helped facilitate my first trip to my parents’ birthplace, which proved to be invaluable on so many levels. My in-­laws, Ellen and Hank Lucas, and Jon Lucas and Erin Walsh, have provided valuable perspective. My husband, Scott Lucas, has been my steadfast companion during this long journey. Through it all, his love, generosity, and keen insights have helped me in more ways than I can possibly lay out here. Our children, Ali and Salma, recently joined us on this journey, providing incredible joy and much-­needed laughter. I hope they will see the day when everyone in the Holy Land—­and in the world—­lives in peace as equals.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nBrothers Apart\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAs Rashid Husayn (Rashid Hussein) boarded the plane, he was full of nervous excitement. In July 1959 the twenty-­three-­year-­old poet-­journalist embarked on his first overseas trip to attend the Seventh World Festival of Youth and Students in Vienna, where seventeen thousand leftist activists from around the globe were gathering to celebrate “brotherhood and peace.” He was especially eager to meet some of the thirteen hundred delegates from Arab countries since, as a Palestinian citizen of Israel, he had been cut off from the region for more than a decade.1 The ongoing hostilities between Israel and the Arab states meant that Israeli citizens—­Jewish and Palestinian alike—­were, with rare exception, forbidden from traveling to Arab countries. International gatherings in Europe and the Soviet Union provided a rare opportunity for politically connected Palestinians in Israel to meet face-­to-­face with their Arab counterparts. But attending the festival was also fraught with dilemmas. Husayn and his fellow Palestinians were going as part of a formal Jewish-­Arab delegation that Israeli government officials hoped would reinforce their portrayal of Israel as a beacon of progressive democracy, complete with a content Arab minority accorded their full rights. Yet many of those same Palestinians were at the forefront of an ongoing struggle against the state, in particular its harsh military government that controlled their movement, confiscated their land, restricted their political expression, and hindered their economic development. At the same time, it was unclear whether the other Arab delegates would even be interested in meeting Husayn; they were, after all, some of Israel’s most vociferous critics. Four years earlier, at the Sixth Festival in Moscow, Arab delegates passed out pamphlets denouncing Israeli policies and calling for the state’s elimina1\n\n2 Introduction\n\ntion.2 Would Arab delegates condemn the Palestinian minority as traitors to the Arab cause, as they had in Moscow? Husayn also faced tensions within his own delegation. Although he was politically independent, Husayn wrote regularly for the Arabic publications of Mapam (Mifleget Hapoalim Hameuhedet; United Workers’ Party), a leftist-­Zionist political party. But several of the other delegates belonged to the Communist Party of Israel (CPI), a strong critic of Mapam. Three months earlier, Husayn and CPI members debated in their respective journals how to view the recent Arab revolutions. Would Husayn have to fend off attacks from within his own delegation? Most of Husayn’s concerns were allayed on his arrival in Vienna. Members of his delegation put their differences aside during the festival, while the other Arab attendees were receptive to learning about the expressions of anticolonial solidarity taking place in Israel. When Husayn and his fellow delegates eagerly showed their Algerian counterparts photos of a demonstration in Nazareth calling for Algeria’s independence and the release of prisoner Djamila Bouhired, the Algerians thanked them for their support.3 Several of them also discussed eagerly the latest developments in Iraq with some of that country’s six hundred participants who were themselves in attendance for the first time. One Iraqi intellectual hailed the periodicals that Husayn and his colleagues distributed as meeting “the highest standards for Arabic journals.”4 While heartened by the expressions of support from most of his fellow Arabs, Husayn was disappointed by the reaction he received from some members of the Lebanese delegation. They were so incensed at seeing Palestinians walk behind the Israeli flag during the festival’s opening procession that afterward they marched over to Husayn and other Palestinian members of the Israeli delegation, loudly accusing them of being traitors to the Palestinian cause and to the Arab world. Later that evening, Husayn overheard a couple of delegates, with their distinctive Lebanese accents, chatting at the hotel bar where he was having a cup of coffee. He ordered a couple of cups for them, but before taking a sip, they asked where he was from. When Husayn replied that he was an “Arab from Israel,” they cursed him as a traitor and stormed off.5 In reporting the incident to his readers back home, Husayn made it clear that “we would be mistaken to take the Lebanese delegation as representative of the Arabs as a whole.”6 But he was nonetheless troubled by what he had encountered. After returning to his office in Tel Aviv, Husayn published an open letter to “my brothers in Lebanon” in the local Arabic monthly, al-­Fajr (The dawn). In it, he urged the Lebanese to recognize that, despite his Israeli passport, he and\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nhis fellow Palestinian citizens of Israel were Arabs too. “It is shameful,” Husayn wrote, “that we have to swear and give oaths of allegiance in order to prove to you our Arabness. We are the remainder of the Palestinian people, your neighbors in tents.” Husayn also insisted that he and his fellow Palestinians in Israel were still deeply connected to the Arab world. “Your delegation called us ‘traitors,’” he recalled ruefully. “If only you knew how much these ‘traitors’ cheered during the heroism of Port Said, during the Iraqi Revolution, and during your revolution—­ yours, O Lebanon! If only you knew, dear friend, how we danced and gave candy to children after every victory of the Arab people against the enemies of our people.”7 Tellingly, Husayn affirmed his solidarity with the Lebanese and Arab people, not by recalling their common language or heritage but by invoking a set of shared experiences that Arabs throughout the region—­including in Israel—­had hailed as recent triumphs in the Arab struggle against Western hegemony.8 And he did so on the pages of an Arabic literary journal, published in Israel, that he hoped would eventually reach the hands of his fellow Arabs. Husayn’s affirmation of solidarity with the major Arab causes of the day and his plea for understanding from his “brothers” in Lebanon speak to the central questions that drive this study. How did Palestinian citizens of Israel attempt to foster cultural and intellectual connections to the Arab world in the 1950s and 1960s, during a time of profound political and geographic isolation? How did Arab intellectuals and political leaders in the region respond to these attempts, and how did their responses change over time? How did regional and global political developments, particularly during the heady days of decolonization, reverberate back into Palestinian communities in Israel? More broadly, what do these dynamics tell us about the transnational circulations of decolonizing discourses produced and consumed through written texts, and what role do these texts play in creating new political vocabularies and solidarities? In this book, I argue that a critical examination of Palestinian and Arab writings, found in newspapers, journals, poetry, literary collections, and memoirs, sheds light on these important questions. In doing so, I locate the cultural and intellectual history of Palestinian citizens of Israel, including their resistance against state policies and the Zionist logic that underpinned them, within the larger context of Palestinian, Arab, and international struggles for decolonization. ISOLATING THE PALESTINIANS\n\nThe making of the Palestinian minority in Israel was a direct, if unintended, consequence of the tumultuous events of 1947–­1949, a period that has become\n\n4 Introduction\n\nknown in Palestinian collective memory as the Nakba (catastrophe). Over several months of intense fighting, the well-­organized military forces of a relatively small Jewish population (about 650,000) in British Mandate Palestine overwhelmed the forces of an Arab population more than twice its size and subsequently defeated the armies of several Arab states. As a result, the Palestinian Arab community was dramatically altered from one that constituted more than two-­thirds of the population of Palestine to one that was defeated, dispersed, and dispossessed.9 More than half of the nearly 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs were driven or fled from their homes,10 including nearly all of the political, intellectual, and cultural elites; most of the urban population;11 and the rural inhabitants of more than four hundred villages.12 But not everyone left. About 160,000 Palestinians remained within the 1949 Armistice Lines, forming a small minority (about 13 percent) within the newly established state. Often separated from family members during the chaos of the conflict, many of them were internally displaced while others were briefly exiled out of the country before making their way back into the self-­declared Jewish state. Israeli leaders, seeking to minimize the number of non-­Jews in the country, nonetheless recognized that expelling the remaining Palestinian population en masse was untenable given the international pressure they were already facing to repatriate the refugees.13 Therefore, they were eager to create a mechanism that would distinguish those Palestinians who were to remain in Israel from those who had left and therefore would not be allowed to return.14 Initially only some Palestinians residing within the 1949 Armistice Lines (the so-­called Green Line) obtained citizenship. Following passage of the 1952 Citizenship Law, a majority of Palestinians living in Israel received the status of citizen, though it was not of equal standing with that of Jewish Israelis.15 And as the porous borders between Israel and its neighbors grew more impermeable,16 the dislocations, separations, and military rule that Palestinians had thought were temporary wartime measures became entrenched. In describing the dramatically altered circumstances of the Palestinians in Israel, famed novelist and literary critic Anton Shammas wrote, “The state of Israel put us in isolation.”17 This isolation took two forms: First, Palestinians faced physical and cultural isolation within Israel. In contrast to Jewish citizens who could travel freely throughout the country, until 1966 Palestinian citizens of Israel were under the watchful eye of a military-­run bureaucratic regime that limited where they could live, work, and travel.18 On the cultural front, the authorities sought to cultivate “Arab Israeli” subjects who were divided internally\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nalong political and sectarian lines, cut off from their Palestinian Arab heritage, and solely dependent on the state for their cultural nourishment. The second type of isolation they faced was physical and cultural isolation from the Arab world. In the wake of Israel’s establishment, the Arab League enforced a boycott of all Israeli goods and citizens,19 while Israel banned its own citizens from traveling to Arab countries and restricted Palestinian citizens’ access to textual material from the Arab world, citing fears of incitement.20 STRATEGIES OF RESISTANCE\n\nTo blunt the effects of this internal and external isolation, Palestinian intellectuals, party organizers, and cultural producers adopted several distinct, yet overlapping, strategies of resistance that drew on strategies developed during the Mandate period. In the immediate aftermath of the 1948 Arab-­Israeli War the first strategy that CPI members in particular adopted was simply bringing people together, whether for protests or for cultural festivals. But such physical gatherings were difficult to hold given the tight restrictions on movement that Palestinians faced, so the CPI simultaneously adopted a second, more discursively centered strategy: utilizing local Arabic newspapers and journals to challenge Israeli stereotypes, to acquaint readers with Arab civilizational heritage and international literature, and to comment on major events at home and abroad from a decidedly communist viewpoint. In the second half of the 1950s, revolutionary fervor in the Arab world led Palestinian intellectuals inside the Green Line to cast their gaze toward Egypt and Iraq. Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser’s defiant stance during the Suez Crisis and his immensely popular radio broadcasts, coupled with Iraq’s overthrow of the pro-­Western Hashemite monarchy, ushered in a brief period of hope and camaraderie throughout the region. This buoyant spirit reverberated in Israel as Palestinian communist and pan-­Arab nationalist intellectuals put aside their differences and adopted a third strategy: establishing nonpartisan organizations to speak against the state’s isolating policies with a united voice. To accommodate the growing range of political viewpoints emerging at this time, intellectuals also established new Arabic newspapers and journals to comment on the local, regional, and international news of the day. While the subsequent fallout between the communists and nationalists in the Arab world led to sometimes acrimonious exchanges on the pages of their respective publications, their shared political vocabulary stressing cultural emancipation and dignity for all linked them discursively to the region and to the broader decolonizing world.\n\n6 Introduction\n\nThis linkage worried Israeli officials, who feared that allowing Palestinian citizens to acquire regional Arabic print material could incite the “Arab minority.” But those Palestinians also recognized that access to such material was crucial to sustaining their shared discursive formations with the region. Thus, they adopted a fourth strategy: sneaking regional Arabic newspapers, literary journals, books, and poetry collections into the hands of the growing Palestinian intelligentsia. These texts were crucial for exposing a younger generation of Palestinians educated in the Israeli school system to alternative viewpoints that celebrated their cultural heritage and political outlook. As a result, despite the difficulty of establishing direct contact with Arabs in the region, many Palestinian citizens of Israel nonetheless followed intensely wider global debates through the consumption and circulation of Arabic print material. In the mid-­1960s this strategy was reversed, as texts produced in Israel were increasingly smuggled out to neighboring countries, where they played a key role in acquainting Arab intellectuals with the struggles of Palestinians inside the Green Line. A central question being debated throughout this period was the role that literature should play in mobilizing people to the cause of justice at home and abroad. The rise of socialist realism, literary commitment, and platform poetry in the Arab world inspired several Palestinian writers in Israel to turn to a fifth strategy: composing, publishing, and reciting politically themed poems. The CPI publications were central in promoting such poetry because they published local, regional, and global voices that spoke of a shared solidarity. Meanwhile, poetry festivals became occasions for Palestinians in the country to challenge their physical isolation from one another and from the region. Performers and audience members alike often had to defy travel bans and circumvent police cordons just to attend the events. Once there, poets often recited verses that positioned their community within a wider Palestinian, Arab, and global decolonizing milieu. As younger Palestinian poets such as Mahmoud Darwish and Samih al-­Qasim came to dominate the literary scene in the 1960s, their poems not only played an important role in fostering a shared national consciousness among Palestinians in Israel but would later emerge as a central means of alerting Arabs in the region to the conditions—­and to the defiance—­of their community. Darwish and Qasim were part of a younger cohort of Palestinian intellectuals who were eager to reach an audience outside the Israeli state. Some of these intellectuals had previously made contact with their Arab counterparts through a sixth strategy: attending international conferences and festivals. But\n\nIntroduction 7\n\ntheir main interlocutors were other Arab leftists who were themselves often marginalized or persecuted in their home countries, limiting the overall impact of those gatherings. By the 1960s, some of the more nationalist-­oriented Palestinian intellectuals adopted a seventh strategy: sending memoranda to international bodies describing their conditions in Israel. The 1964 Ard memorandum received especially wide attention, thanks in large part to a growing body of Palestinian nationalist organizers in exile who were eager to raise awareness about this beleaguered—­and overlooked—­community. Despite these efforts, until 1967 the Palestinians in Israel went almost entirely unnoticed in the Arab world. Most Arab intellectuals deemed them to be passive victims of Israeli tyranny at best and traitors to the Palestinian cause at worst. But the June 1967 War, with its massive, humiliating defeat of Arab forces and Israel’s occupation of the remainder of historic Palestine, altered that perception. Arab intellectuals now turned to the Palestinians in Israel, especially the image of the poet-­resister, for a glimmer of hope. The 1968 World Youth Festival in Sofia, Bulgaria, where Darwish and Qasim met face-­to-­face for the first time with their Arab contemporaries, proved to be an important turning point in this Arab “discovery” of Palestinians who were actively resisting their oppression inside the Green Line. This discovery came at a time when the Palestinian armed resistance movement was reaching new heights, leading Israeli leaders to worry about the growing connections between Palestinians in Israel and the Arab world. As a result, state security apparatuses stepped up their efforts to prevent contact between Palestinian intellectuals in Israel, in the occupied territories, and abroad. Ultimately this led to some intellectuals and political organizers being banished to neighboring Arab states; it also led to the self-­imposed exile of Darwish, who moved to Cairo in 1971. Thus, an eighth and final strategy (albeit not always a freely chosen one) was to physically leave the country. Yet even after their discovery and celebration in the Arab world, and even after several of them took up residence in Arab capitals, Palestinian citizens of Israel often found that they still had an uneasy relationship with their Arab counterparts. This tension continues to some extent to this day, and it is part of what makes this story so important for comprehending the transnational dynamics of the region. LOOKING BEYOND THE NATION-­STATE\n\nDespite the deep, multilayered engagements that Palestinian intellectuals in Israel had with developments in the Arab world and beyond, scholars have largely\n\n8 Introduction\n\nexamined this group through the analytical lens of the nation-­state. Early studies focused on economic and social transformations among rural Palestinians, often presuming the Israeli state was a modernizing force for good.21 In the late 1970s, a new wave of scholarship began to situate this community more clearly within Israeli matrices of control. Elia Zuriek argued that Palestinians in Israel faced a form of “internal colonialism,” while subsequent studies, grounded largely in social science methodologies, determined the means by which Israeli policies effectively controlled, marginalized, and excluded the Palestinian minority.22 As Palestinian citizens stepped up their oppositional political activities in the 1970s, some social scientists grew concerned with whether this group identified more closely with Israel or with the Palestinians, and the implications of this identification for the Israeli state.23 Even sociological works that take seriously the more nuanced and complex worldviews of Palestinians in Israel have tended nonetheless to gloss over the historical period before and immediately after 1967.24 Yet without a thorough analysis of the intellectual and cultural transformations that I lay out in the following pages, there can be little accounting for how or why these contemporary worldviews emerged. A number of recent historical studies have shed light on forms of Palestinian resistance against Israeli systems of oppression during the early years of statehood, attending more explicitly to Palestinian subjectivity.25 While these works have made important contributions to the historical record, they, too, examine this community largely within the framework of the Israeli state. My study builds on these works, but it also departs from them by focusing on the perspectives of intellectuals and cultural producers in order to understand more fully their relationship not only with the Israeli state but also with each other and with intellectual developments in the Arab region and the decolonizing world. This analytical lens takes heed of what Palestinian American scholar Ibrahim Abu-­Lughod warned regarding the “pitfalls of Palestiniology”: that is, viewing Palestinians’ historical development primarily through the lens of their struggles against the Zionists and the British. While conceding that scholars must take into account the “entanglement” of Palestinian and Zionist societies, Abu-­Lughod cautioned that such an approach not only narrows the range of historical questions deemed worthy of study but also risks occluding Palestinian voices.26 This book ameliorates some of these imbalances in the scholarship by demonstrating how Palestinians in Israel turned to written texts, both to contest the state and its dominant Zionist paradigms at home and to reach out to (and sometimes challenge) their ethno-­national brethren abroad.\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nApplying a transnational analytical framework to the study of Palestinian writings during this period requires a creative approach to procuring sources. This is especially true since Palestinians have no fully functioning national archive of their own;27 their main documentary repositories have been shut down, seized, or destroyed;28 and the postwar files of Arab state archives remain largely inaccessible to researchers.29 Moreover, official Israeli state and party archives have tended to define members of this community within the parameters of the state, often obscuring their agency and worldviews.30 As a result, the newspapers, journals, poetry collections, memoirs, and other documentary sources examined here come from an amalgam of collections held in libraries and by individuals in the United States and the Middle East, reflecting the ongoing Palestinian condition of dislocation and exile. In addition, interviews conducted with several key figures from this period shed light on the political and material conditions that gave rise to the production and consumption of these texts. ON TEXTS AND AUDIENCES\n\nTo analyze these texts in ways that can shed light on larger historical processes, I pay close attention to what Edward Said termed the “worldliness” of texts, keeping in mind that they “are always enmeshed in circumstance, time, place and society.”31 I also heed Raymond Williams’s call to examine the “conditions of practice” that go into producing a piece of art or literature.32 As a result, I devote considerable attention to the material conditions in which these texts were produced, including the political events that gave rise to them. Doing so allows me to undertake an analysis on multiple spatial and temporal scales to highlight their role in the strategies of resistance elucidated previously. Such an analysis also sheds light on the multiple audiences these texts had over time and space. Prior to 1948, members of the Palestinian Arab intelligentsia were deeply integrated into the broader Arab cultural and intellectual milieu. Their engagement with the anticolonial discourses that circulated throughout Beirut, Damascus, Cairo, Baghdad, and beyond resulted in the production and consumption of texts that were part of an imagined pan-­Arab audience. The profound dislocations that resulted from the 1948 Nakba, even among Palestinians who ultimately became citizens of Israel, attenuated to some degree this pan-­ Arab horizon. Intellectuals focused initially on reaching out to their fellow Palestinians in Israel and to government officials to secure their position within the new state while still affirming their Arab heritage and identity.\n\n10 Introduction\n\nDuring the second half of the 1950s, as a buoyant pan-­Arab nationalism took hold in the region, Palestinian intellectuals in Israel embedded within their cultural and political writings a more expansive spatial and temporal horizon that, while still accounting for their isolation, was aimed at possible future audiences beyond the borders of the state. Their cognizance of this futurity can be seen in the eagerness with which Palestinian delegates in Vienna distributed back issues of their publications to Arab delegates and reported to readers back home the positive reception those publications received. Husayn’s open letter to his “brothers in Lebanon”—­knowing full well that they were unlikely to read his plea immediately but might do so sometime later—­is another example of this future-­oriented temporal horizon. With the rise of the Palestinian national movement in the 1960s, Palestinian intellectuals and cultural producers in Israel were more cognizant of their position within a broader Palestinian milieu and thus developed a discourse that was aimed more specifically at their fellow Palestinians. After the 1967 war these multiple audiences came together as Palestinians on both sides of the Green Line were able to physically reconnect with one another and as Arab intellectuals paid greater attention to the Palestinians in Israel than they had before. INTELLECTUALS ACROSS GENERATIONS\n\nIn accounting for the worldliness of these texts, I also attend to the backgrounds of the authors that produced them. Most of the figures I discuss in this book functioned in society as Gramscian “organic intellectuals,”33 who came from working-­ class backgrounds and/or were deeply invested in improving the lives of the working class and peasants (who were the majority of the Palestinians in Israel at this time34). My use of the term “intellectual” to describe these individuals also reflects their own self-­identification as muthaqqafun (intellectuals). Like them, I use this term to refer to high school and college graduates, teachers, writers, journalists, attorneys, and party organizers who wrote poetry and prose aimed at improving the conditions of their society. The close etymological link in Arabic between “intellectual” (muthaqqaf) and “culture” (thaqafa) further underscores the need to examine their intellectual and cultural writings together. To be sure, “traditional intellectuals” could be found among the Palestinians in Israel, mainly in government-­run institutions. But their textual output was much more modest and less influential than that of their more critical counterparts.35 Despite the shared interests of these organic intellectuals, clear distinctions existed between an older generation who came of age during the pre-­1948 pe-\n\nIntroduction 11\n\nriod and a younger generation who came of age in the Israeli state. Members of the older generation hailed largely from Christian (primarily Orthodox) working-­class or middle-­class family backgrounds and grew up in relative material comfort in urban or town settings. They were also among the few Palestinians who were able to obtain a high school degree and, in some cases, went on to college in neighboring countries. These opportunities led them to develop a strong connection with the regional intelligentsia, often resulting in the development of a pan-­Arab nationalist orientation with a leftist bent. The younger generation of intellectuals was more diverse, with members hailing from Muslim, Christian, and Druze families and often from working-­ class or rural peasant backgrounds. They generally came of age under Israeli rule, which, on the one hand, expanded educational opportunities for Palestinian citizens in rural areas but, on the other hand, restricted their access to regional Arab discourses. Because they were unable to travel to neighboring countries, this generation’s engagement with Palestinians and Arabs beyond the Green Line was mediated almost exclusively through texts, whether produced locally or smuggled in from abroad. And as these texts increasingly questioned widely held truisms about internationalism and pan-­Arab nationalism—­while still championing Third World solidarity and Palestinian liberation—­cleavages emerged between the older and younger intellectuals about how best to alleviate the burdens their community faced. In short, members of each generation inhabited what historical anthropologist David Scott terms a distinct “moral-­political location” that informed the conceptual and practical questions they sought to tackle.36 Building on sociologist Karl Mannheim’s conceptualization of generations as social forms, Scott calls on contemporary observers to step outside the “epistemological privilege of the present” and to recognize that earlier generations of intellectuals were proposing specific answers to moral, political, and social challenges that reflected the particular temporal location that they inhabited.37 Not only does this approach help us uncover how shifting political and material circumstances influenced the writings of these specific intellectuals, but it also sheds light on how we may understand the ways in which ideas are shaped and reworked across generations more broadly. Despite these generational shifts, both the older and younger Palestinian intellectuals at this time shared a preference for producing cultural texts in Arabic rather than Hebrew. While many politically engaged intellectuals, particularly in the CPI and Mapam, communicated with their Jewish colleagues in Hebrew\n\n12 Introduction\n\nand composed political tracts for their respective party’s Hebrew press outlets, they used Arabic for the vast majority of their culture work, especially when reaching out to Palestinians and other Arabs.38 Their use of Arabic also signaled their engagement with the Arab modernist project in the 1950s and 1960s, which was in many ways quite distinct from its European counterpart. As intellectual historian and literary scholar Yaseen Noorani notes, Arab modernists excoriated the colonial underpinnings and neocolonial conditions of the mid-­ twentieth century while also critiquing those Arab social values they deemed to be in the service of the status quo. As a result, they developed a literary and artistic aesthetic that stressed visual autonomy and self-­sacrifice, viewing the production of creative work itself within the context of revolutionary nationalism.39 The writings I examine here were certainly influenced by the broader Arab modernist project, but they were not merely derivative of it. Rather, Palestinian intellectuals and cultural producers in Israel made significant contributions to Arab modernism in ways that have not yet been appreciated fully. Darwish and Qasim were but two of a host of writers who contributed to a literary aesthetic that stressed cultural emancipation and pride in their identity and heritage. Understanding the local, regional, and global conditions that gave rise to these texts can therefore shed light on these larger processes of cultural decolonization. DECOLONIZING CITIZENS\n\nSome readers will be surprised by my positioning of these works within the context of decolonization, arguing that Palestinians in Israel are citizens of a postcolonial state and as such are accorded basic rights—­including the right to vote and hold political office—­that colonial subjects are typically denied.40 Some may also object that the individuals I examine here rarely, if ever, referred to themselves explicitly as colonial subjects. Both points are correct. An explicit invocation of colonial subjectivity was beyond the pale of acceptable political discourse in Israel, and not all Palestinian intellectuals were comfortable with the colonial analogy. Some fully accommodated themselves to Zionist narratives, portraying themselves as part of a loyal minority grateful for the benefits bestowed on them by a relatively liberal democratic state. Even those organic intellectuals who saw parallels between their conditions in Israel and those of other colonized populations by and large rejected the prevailing decolonizing logic of the time, which called for armed struggle to achieve national independence in the form of a sovereign state.\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nHowever, by introducing the conceptual framework of the “liberal settler” state, historian Shira Robinson calls on us to broaden our understanding of colonialism to account for the fact that modes of liberal thought can and did coexist with colonial practices, as demonstrated by Israel’s policies toward its Palestinian citizens.41 It then follows that we should also embrace a more expansive conceptual framework of decolonization that accounts for the various ways in which marginalized groups sought to make sense of their political, cultural, and material conditions. As the following pages reveal, Palestinian intellectuals in Israel turned frequently to the struggles of decolonization then taking place in the Arab world and beyond to make legible their own conditions and seek out an effective path for improving their lives and their community, even if they did not call for national independence or secession from the Israeli state.42 In adopting this broader concept of decolonization, I build on a recent body of scholarship that pushes our understanding of decolonization beyond the grip of national liberation. Drawing on the cosmopolitanism and universalism found in the writings of Négritude cofounders Leopold Senghor and Aimé Césaire, historical anthropologist Gary Wilder calls on scholars of decolonization to “inquire into the range of political forms that were imagined and fashioned” in the postwar era.43 While these imaginings often included national independence, this was not always the case. Expanding our understanding of decolonization beyond national liberation also accounts for the varied forms of supranational imaginaries, most notably Third Worldism, in which politically engaged peoples living under a range of colonial, semicolonial, and nominally independent legal statuses still considered themselves to be part of a larger struggle for full decolonization.44 This analytical approach also extends our periodization of the decolonizing era well past the attainment of formal independence to show how the transnational circulation of literary texts from the 1930s through the 1950s impacted the decolonizing discourses of the following decade.45 Moreover, by attending to the writings of this period, I demonstrate that Palestinian intellectuals spoke back to concepts of decolonization long before the recent emergence of scholarship that foregrounds the settler-­colonial paradigm in discussions of Israel-­Palestine.46 Examining these texts within the context of decolonization also helps us comprehend the evolving debates about what term best describes this community. For decades, the terms “Arab Israelis” and “Arabs in Israel” had been the most common appellations, reflecting both the official Israeli designation of\n\n14 Introduction\n\nthis group as a fully integrated minority and the pan-­Arab inclinations of the intellectuals themselves. More recently, growing numbers of Palestinian citizens of Israel have preferred the terms “Palestinians in Israel” and “Palestinian Arabs in Israel,”47 viewing the term “Arab Israeli” as one that denies their Palestinian national affiliation and functions as a form of settler-­colonial erasure.48 Many of the more nationally conscious intellectuals and activists refer to themselves (and are referred to by other Arabs) as “Palestinians Inside/Inside People” (Filastiniyun fi’l-­dakhil/ahl al-­dakhil) or “48 Arabs/48 Palestinians,” both of which refer to those Palestinians living on land inside the Green Line, which became part of the Israeli state in 1948. While the term “Arab Israeli” is still commonly used in Israel, recently scholars have preferred using a combination of these other terms that take into account this group’s own subjectivity and outlook. In short, I argue that despite the double erasure that Palestinians in Israel faced from the Israeli state and the Arab world, intellectuals within this community insisted that they were a part of the global projects of cultural and political decolonization. By shedding light on these overlooked vicissitudes of Palestinian history, I establish the role that the production and circulation of written texts play in developing new political vocabularies that transcend multiple spatial and temporal planes. In doing so, I hope to deprovincialize the Palestinian citizens of Israel and write them back into Palestinian, Arab, and global history.\n\n1\n\nSTRATEGIES OF RESISTANCE\n\nBefore he was a communist party organizer, an Israeli Knesset member, or a world-­renowned novelist, Emile Habibi was a young Palestinian taking in the social, cultural, and political crosscurrents of British Mandate Haifa. Born in 1921 and raised in a Protestant home, Habibi spent his early years in local government schools, where his teachers encouraged the voracious reader to immerse himself in the classics of Arabic poetry and prose, to master the intricacies of Arabic grammar, and to study the Qurʾan to appreciate its linguistic and cultural influences. His older brothers, who labored in Haifa’s rapidly expanding railroad and oil industries, used to invite communist coworkers to meet secretly in their family home, familiarizing Habibi with basic Marxist tenets.1 As a student at Acre’s government high school and later at St. Luke’s missionary high school in Haifa,2 Habibi participated in the nationalist anticolonial protests that were part of the 1936–­1939 Arab Revolt. After completing high school in 1939, Habibi began working with one of his brothers in an oil refinery and, along with a number of other recent high school graduates from Haifa, joined the Palestine Communist Party (PCP). Habibi was attracted to the PCP’s framing of the Arab Revolt as a nationalist, anticolonial struggle that was aimed primarily at the British government, as well as its call for cooperation between Arab and Jewish laborers.3 But the ambitious Habibi soon grew restless with manual labor, seeing himself as an intellectual and literary “knight concealed in workman’s clothes.”4 Through the Arabic periodicals that came to Palestine from Cairo, Beirut, and beyond, Habibi familiarized himself with an array of intellectual currents. He read about the modernizing, pro-­Western Egyptian literary doyens Taha Hu15\n\n16 Strategies of Resistance\n\nsayn and ʿAbbas al-­ʿAqqad,5 as well as Russian authors known for their radical outlooks, such as Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, and Vladimir Mayakovsky, whose works had been available in Arabic translation for decades.6 As his interest in communist thought grew, Habibi was drawn to Lebanese critics Marun ʿAbbud, Raʾ if Khuri (Raif Khoury), and other contributors to the Beirut-­based leftist monthly al-­Tariq (The path).7 In 1942 Habibi had an opportunity to engage in more intellectual pursuits when he was hired as a radio host for the Palestine Broadcasting Service (PBS) in Jerusalem. His two-­year term nourished his deep interest in Arabic literature and culture, as authors and musicians from Iraq to Egypt came to Palestine to appear on the radio and perform in the social clubs that dotted Palestinian cities.8 Habibi’s solidifying leftist views also led him to criticize Husayn and al-­ʿAqqad as espousing outdated views at a time when strong, progressive, anticolonial voices were needed to end European hegemony over Arab lands. When al-­ʿAqqad held literary salons in Palestine, Habibi disrupted them and challenged vociferously the elderly Egyptian’s conservative positions.9 Habibi also took to the pen to express his own evolving leftist views. Habibi’s formative experiences during the interwar period suggest several factors that would become central to the social, cultural, and political development among Palestinians in Israel. In particular Habibi’s keen interest in a wide array of local and regional cultural works reveals the pivotal role that they played in constructing a nationalist, anticolonial pan-­Arab imaginary that called for an end to British rule in Palestine, while simultaneously rejecting the notion that Palestinian Arabs were engaged in an ethno-­religious struggle against Jews.10 After the 1948 war Habibi would continue to insist that colonial domination and “bourgeois nationalism” (by which he meant a deliberate attempt to divide people along ethnic and religious lines to forestall their united, class-­based struggle against the bourgeoisie) were the main obstacles to peace and justice in the region.11 The magnitude of the changes that occurred in 1948 has often led historians to mark this year as a moment of rupture. Yet viewing 1948 solely as a dividing line in the periodization of Palestinian history can obscure important continuities that spanned that auspicious year.12 This is especially true in the realms of cultural and intellectual history, where the discourses and strategies that Arabs in Palestine and in the region developed as far back as the late nineteenth century continued despite the dramatic changes to their political circumstances.13 To make sense of how and why, in the immediate aftermath of the Nakba, Pal-\n\nStrategies of Resistance 17\n\nestinians in Israel with strong leftist and anticolonial orientations were so quick to mobilize within the new state and to reach out to their fellow Arabs beyond it, it is necessary to understand the social, political, cultural, and intellectual milieu in which they were steeped before that fateful year. A central question that galvanized Palestinian Arabs during the interwar period was how to wrest control of their country from British colonial rulers who, along with the French, had carved up the region and prevented the establishment of an independent, unified Arab state. Many Arab nationalists considered British rule in Palestine to be especially pernicious, as it not only hindered Palestinian Arab political and economic development but also paved the way for the establishment of Zionist settlements that displaced thousands of Palestinian Arabs.14 Members of the traditional Palestinian Arab leadership, drawn mainly from the landed notable class, initially petitioned the British for more meaningful political representation and a curb on Jewish immigration. When that approach failed, some of these leaders, most famously the mufti Hajj Amin al-­Husayni, increasingly framed their struggle in terms of ethno-­religious strife between Arabs and Jews who were competing with one another for control over Palestine.15 But a number of politically conscious Palestinian Arabs objected to this analysis, arguing that it ignored the central role that British colonialism played in obstructing their development. Stemming mainly from a professional class that included journalists, educators, civil servants, and lawyers, these intellectuals developed an anticolonial discourse that named British rule as the primary obstacle in their quest for independence. Especially notable was the Istiqlal (Independence) Party, which in the 1930s played a pivotal role in mobilizing Palestinians toward nationalist activities that culminated in the general strike of 1936.16 Although the Istiqlalists were ultimately unable to wrest political power from the grip of the traditional elite, they utilized emergent forms of cultural and political expression to position Palestine and the surrounding Arab countries as being engaged in a collective struggle for independence from British and French colonial rule. This nationalist-­anticolonial formulation was subsequently adopted by several Palestinian Arab communist leaders who placed it more firmly within an internationalist framework that carried over into the post-­1948 period. In this chapter I trace the spatial and temporal horizons that shaped members of the Arab intelligentsia in Palestine prior to 1948. In particular, I highlight how the strategies of resistance that they developed during this period\n\n18 Strategies of Resistance\n\nimpacted the worldviews of three men—­Hanna Naqqara, Emile Habibi, and Hanna Abu Hanna—­who became central figures in the Israeli Communist Party. Born over the span of sixteen years (1912–­1928), they were shaped by the Mandate period in distinct ways. But they were all influenced by several key developments, including (1) the rise of nationalist-­and socialist-­minded teachers who actively subverted British colonial discourses by emphasizing Palestinian Arab connections to the land of Palestine and to a rich Arab civilizational heritage; (2) the emergence of the local press as a means of mass mobilization that linked Palestinian Arabs to one another and to the region; (3) the spread of politically themed poetry that drew on nationalist and socialist themes to denounce the political elite and celebrate the power of the people; (4) the utilization of social clubs and radio programming to expose a wider array of Palestinian Arabs to local and regional cultural developments as well as contemporary ideological, cultural, and political debates; and (5) a rise in leftist-­inflected nationalist discourses that linked Palestinian Arab intellectuals to their counterparts in neighboring countries. A crucial factor that linked all of these developments was the increased production, consumption, and circulation of texts, including newspapers, journals, books, and leaflets, which allowed politically conscious individuals like Naqqara, Habibi, and Abu Hanna to tap into regional and global conversations that had both pedagogical and oppositional purposes. As a result of these transformations, by the early 1940s all three men had developed a strong belief that their calls for Palestinian liberation must be foregrounded in an anticolonial imaginary that positioned their struggle for independence within broader campaigns for freedom and social justice in the Arab world and beyond. They envisioned a region of socialist-­democratic states, including Palestine, in which people of all religions and ethnicities would live in equality. This call, with its overlapping visions of pan-­Arab (qawmi) nationalism, Palestinian (watani) patriotism, and global internationalism, drew on intellectual and cultural leftist formations that had begun to emerge in Egypt and the Levant as early as the late nineteenth century. Although leftist organizations were marginal in Palestinian society overall, their relative strength in Haifa and Nazareth during the 1940s would prove essential to the reconstitution of Palestinian intellectual and cultural life in Israel after 1948.\n\nStrategies of Resistance 19\n\nPALESTINE AND ITS NEIGHBORS\n\nFor centuries, Palestine had been an integral, yet distinct, part of the Arab East.17 Following the Muslim conquests of those areas in the seventh century, successive Umayyad and Abbasid administrations employed the term “Jund Filastin” (District of Palestine18) to denote the geographic area extending roughly from the Jordan River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and from the Sinai Desert in the south up to a line a few miles north of the modern-­day boundaries of the West Bank. Although the administrative use of this term fell out of favor beginning in 1250 CE, its popular usage continued, as seen in historical studies, travelogues, and religious texts from the fifteenth through the twentieth centuries. Not only did these works continue to use the term “Filastin” in ways that corresponded to the old administrative boundaries of Jund Filastin; they also distinguished this land from its neighbors Sham (Damascus/ Syria) and Misr (Cairo/Egypt).19 Part of this distinctiveness stemmed from Palestine’s religious prestige for the three major Abrahamic traditions. Numerous biblical references to Jerusalem, Hebron, Bethlehem, and Nazareth led Jews and Christians to revere the area for centuries, while Qurʾ anic references to Palestine as a “holy land” and to the environs of the Aqsa Mosque as “blessed” led Muslim writers to develop an extensive body of work dedicated to elucidating the “merits of Jerusalem” and of Palestine more broadly.20 At the same time, the idea of Jerusalem as the center of the world integrated Palestine into the region. Sitting astride major trade and pilgrimage routes, Palestine saw wayfarers and visitors from across the region and around the world cross into its lands. In addition, numerous social, economic, educational, and religious networks were established in Palestine, tying its inhabitants to neighbors farther afield. During the nineteenth century, Palestinian Arab society underwent a series of economic, social, and political changes that further integrated it into the surrounding region. As Egypt and the Arab East were incorporated into the European-­dominated world economy, regional trade networks linked merchants in Palestine to those in surrounding trading centers such as Cairo, Beirut, and Damascus.21 Ottoman administrative redistricting in the nineteenth century led the northern areas of Palestine (including Haifa and Nazareth) to be placed under the auspices of the Beirut district (vilayet), which facilitated trade, social, and intellectual exchanges between northern Palestine and the international trading hub of Beirut. Technological developments in the late nineteenth century, including the steamship and railroad, further connected the\n\n20 Strategies of Resistance\n\ninhabitants of Palestine to those in surrounding areas. Merchants from Syria and Egypt could more easily trade in Palestinian markets, while Muslim pilgrims from North Africa and the Levant visited the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Ibrahimi Mosque (Tomb of the Patriarchs) in Hebron on their way to perform the hajj in Mecca.22 By the turn of the twentieth century, residents of Palestine were intimately tied economically and socially to the surrounding regions, giving them increased access to the emergent cultural and intellectual expressions. THE NAHDA, ARABISM, AND THE CIRCULATION OF RADICAL SOCIALIST IDEAS\n\nAs a broad Arab cultural and intellectual project that emphasized Arab literary and cultural modernization, the Nahda (renaissance) ushered in a rise in the reading and writing of texts, especially books, journals, and newspapers, in the late nineteenth century.23 Several strands of thought emerged from this project: One was a reformist, modernist strand that became associated with Arabism (Arab cultural pride) and later Arab nationalism. It combined German-­inspired Romantic nationalism with a positivist outlook and a deep sense of ethnic and linguistic pride to argue that Arabs could regain their former greatness as a world civilization while remaining true to their identity by adopting selectively those aspects of Western civilization, such as scientific and technological advances, from which they could benefit.24 A second strand emerged among a new middle class of Syrian intellectuals residing mainly in Cairo, Alexandria, and Beirut. They tapped into the emergent global leftist radicalism of the fin de siècle era and adapted socialist, anarchist, and anticolonial discourses to their local context to call for “social justice, workers’ rights, mass secular education, and anticlericalism, and more broadly a general challenge to the existing social and political order at home and abroad.”25 Their calls overlapped—­and sometimes competed—­with those of more nationalist-­minded reformers, a split that would continue into the interwar period. Proponents of both strands of thought took to the press to communicate their message: From 1860 on, Arabic periodicals grew steadily in the urban cultural centers of Istanbul, Cairo, Alexandria, and Beirut, where they eventually made their way to Palestine. The prestigious Cairo-­based journals al-­Hilal (The crescent) and al-­Muqtataf (The selected) played an especially pivotal role in introducing readers to both the liberal modernist and the radical socialist ideas that were being debated on their pages.26 By the turn of the twentieth century,\n\nStrategies of Resistance 21\n\nthese journals and others were delivered to Palestine, and its residents wrote back to the journals, asking questions, responding to queries, and submitting their own essays.27 To be sure, the number of literate Arabs in Palestine at this time was small,28 and the number of people who read al-­Hilal and al-­Muqtataf was likely minuscule.29 Nonetheless, the delivery of regional publications to the few libraries in Palestine paved the way for the ideas of both the reform-­minded nationalists and the radical socialists to gain a foothold in the country.30 In addition, local print media were on the rise, further enhancing the cultural landscape in Palestine. Jerusalem-­based publishing houses printed religious texts, translations, and some original works, while publishing houses in Nazareth produced local newspapers and magazines.31 Palestinian writers were often involved in both the composition and publication of literary reviews, translations of European works, and original pieces of fiction and poetry. Arabic translations of Russian literature were especially popular prior to World War I, in part because two prominent Arab writers of the early twentieth century, Mikhail Nuʿayma (Naimy) and Khalil Baydas, were graduates of the Russian Teacher’s College (also known as the Seminary) in Nazareth.32 This rise in the production and consumption of published texts also corresponded to increasing educational opportunities, as the late Ottoman period saw an expansion of government primary schools;33 the establishment of two government high schools;34 the rise of private, Arab-­run secondary schools;35 and a growth in French, Russian, and British missionary schools at the primary and secondary levels.36 Together these schools educated only a minority of children in Palestine,37 though this small cohort would become core figures within the emergent print culture of Palestine. The last decade of the Ottoman Empire was seminal in the rise of Arab nationalist thought in Palestine. The initial euphoria that accompanied the 1908 Ottoman constitutional revolution was soon tempered as Arab supporters grew disenchanted with the centralization policies of the ruling party.38 In response, local notables and intellectuals intensified their calls for greater Arab autonomy, citing Arabs’ shared linguistic and historical ties as justification.39 The proliferation of newspapers and journals in Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq during this period,40 along with the still-­popular press outlets in Egypt,41 circulated these ideas further. The multiplicity of political orientations in local publications allowed for a broad range of views to be heard, and articles deemed especially salient would be reprinted in other papers, facilitating the circulation of nationalist, socialist, anticolonial, and other political vocabularies throughout the region.\n\n22 Strategies of Resistance\n\nWhile print runs and literacy rates in Palestine remained low during this period,42 they do not necessarily tell the whole story. Newspapers often passed through numerous hands and were read aloud in public places such as cafés, allowing the information they contained to reach far beyond the readers themselves.43 Moreover, the expansion of public and private schools in the late Ottoman period—­established mainly in cities and large towns—­meant that literacy rates rose much more rapidly in urban than in rural areas.44 This was particularly true in Haifa, where the high concentration of private and missionary schools would lead the city to become a key site in Palestinian cultural and intellectual activity.45 During the final years of the Ottoman Empire, the advent of greater educational opportunities and the growing proliferation of the press helped facilitate the early stages of an imagined community in Palestine.46 Yet the movement of people and ideas into and out of Palestine also meant that the spatial horizons of this imagined community extended beyond the Ottoman administrative districts of Jerusalem and Beirut. At the same time, as Zionist and British interest in Palestine increased, intellectuals began to pay closer attention to the ways in which the discourses they were hearing from these two groups bore a striking resemblance to colonial discourses heard elsewhere in the region and around the world. RESPONDING TO ZIONIST AND BRITISH COLONIAL DISCOURSES\n\nColonial discourse, what Caribbean scholar Asselin Charles defines as “the verbal expression of the West’s will and right to power,” witnessed a revival in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.47 These discourses manifested themselves in the Arab world through orientalist tropes that characterized Arabs as backward, unfit to rule over themselves, and in need of a Western savior. Such tropes were used to justify French settler-­colonialism in Algeria, the establishment of French protectorates in Morocco and Tunisia, the Italian occupation and colonization of Libya, the British occupation of Egypt and the Sudan, and the establishment of the British Trucial States of the Persian Gulf. In response, Ottoman rulers prior to World War I fought even harder to maintain the empire’s rule over their remaining territories of the Arab East. Zionist leaders and settlers also utilized colonial discourses to justify their project of establishing Jewish settlements in Palestine.48 The popular Zionist slogan that deemed Palestine “a land without a people for a people without a land” led early settlers to look past the abundance of people actually living in\n\nStrategies of Resistance 23\n\nPalestine (the vast majority of whom were Arab Muslims49) and to describe the area as “neglected,” “desolate,” and “ownerless.”50 When Zionists did acknowledge the presence of Arab inhabitants, they often portrayed them as an ephemeral group that could be given “employment in the transit countries” or “transported from the Palestinian hill country to the Transjordanian plateau.”51 These sentiments corresponded to the second wave of Zionist immigration to Palestine between 1905 and 1914, where increased Zionist land purchases from absentee landlords, coupled with the growing assertiveness of Zionist settlers, led to a sharp rise in the expulsions of Palestinian Arab peasants, particularly as stipulations in sale contracts often required the removal of existing tenants.52 As peasants resisted their expulsions more and more vociferously, the local and regional press raised their profiles, seeking to draw in Arab intellectuals and political leaders to champion their cause. The 1910 case of the al-­Fula tenant farmers points to an early example of the ways in which the regional press could transform an ostensibly local dispute to a regional cause célèbre.53 Meanwhile, British policy makers applied colonial discourses that had been developed elsewhere in the empire to the Palestinian context. Colonial administrators, many of whom had served previously in India and/or Egypt, portrayed the native population as being backward, hostile, and unfit to rule themselves.54 In 1915, Anglo-­Zionist activist Herbert Samuel, who would later become Britain’s first high commissioner in Palestine, penned a secret report urging the British to endorse the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine, arguing it was the best way to protect British colonial interests and facilitate the spread of civilization in the region. Missing in Samuel’s report was any acknowledgment of the national aspirations of the Palestinian Arabs, who were not even mentioned by name but were referred to as the “native” or “non-­Jewish” population of Palestine.55 This language made its way into the 1917 Balfour Declaration, in which British foreign secretary Arthur James Balfour formally announced Britain’s intention of facilitating the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine, while according only civil and religious rights to the “non-­Jewish communities.”56 Arab nationalists were dismayed by the declaration’s denial of their aspirations for sovereignty and denounced it immediately. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1918, Arab nationalists called for a united, independent Arab state that would encompass most of Greater Syria, including Palestine.57 Instead, the League of Nations covenant called for communities in the former Ottoman lands to become Class A Mandates, in theory\n\n24 Strategies of Resistance\n\na temporary condition in which they would receive “administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone.”58 But not all Class A Mandates were created equal: The British Mandates of Iraq and Transjordan (which had been separated from the Palestine Mandate in 192259), with their Hashemite rulers Faysal and ʿAbdallah, respectively, enjoyed the most autonomy, followed by the French Mandates of Syria and Lebanon, which faced additional restrictions. Despite important differences between them, the terms of all these Mandates nonetheless called on the British or French authorities to “take into account the rights, interests and wishes of all the population inhabiting the said territory.”60 However, the terms of the Palestine Mandate incorporated the language of the Balfour Declaration nearly verbatim and therefore did not even pay lip service to the “rights, interests and wishes” of the majority population.61 In doing so, the Palestine Mandate placed unique encumbrances on the ability of Palestinian Arabs to build institutions that could lay the groundwork for eventual sovereignty.62 Even as the Palestinian Arabs’ struggle for national independence shared many similarities with those of the surrounding countries, the exceptional terms of their Mandate put them in a remarkably difficult situation. Therefore, they needed to craft a nationalist, anticolonial discourse and a political program that took into account their commonalities with other Arabs while simultaneously facing a rival nationalist group that asserted its own claims over the territory. Over the next two decades, Palestinians developed strategies of resistance that were disseminated through schools, press outlets, poetry, social clubs, and even radio programming, all aimed at countering these colonial discourses. By turning our attention to the impact of these political outlooks on Naqqara, Habibi, and Abu Hanna, we can see how, by the eve of the 1948 war, they each developed a leftist, nationalist, anticolonial stance that was uniquely Palestinian yet intimately tied to the Arab world. We can also gain insight into how they carried these strategies of resistance over into the post-­1948 period since they encountered many of the same challenges to their social, political, and economic development that they faced under British rule. EDUCATING A PALESTINIAN ARAB SUBJECT\n\nWith an uneven expansion of government schools, especially in rural areas,63 the British Mandate period saw the rise of private, “national” secondary schools to compensate for the shortfall and to compete with missionary schools already in place. Consciously seeking to inculcate a sense of national identity within\n\nStrategies of Resistance 25\n\ntheir students, the directors and teachers of these schools played a key role in disseminating an anticolonial discourse that stressed Palestinian patriotism, pan-­Arab nationalism, a love of Arabic literature and civilization, and the need to protect their country from Zionist and British encroachment. A key institution in this project was al-­Najah national school, founded in Nablus in 1921. Its first director, Muhammad ʿIzzat Darwazah, used to gather students every morning before school to sing patriotic songs, and on Tuesdays he gave short lectures on moral, religious, or nationalist themes to middle school students. Older students from al-­Najah often took the lead in organizing political demonstrations and strikes against the British, bringing out students from government and missionary schools to join them on the streets.64 While missionary schools continued to garner a lot of prestige, the growing nationalist sentiment expressed by students in the national schools impacted many of them, occasionally leading to tensions between students and administrators. Such was the case with Hanna Naqqara, who was born in 1912 to a Greek Orthodox family in the northern Galilean village of al-­Rama. Naqqara’s father had moved the family to Haifa in 1918, hoping to find work in one of Britain’s new industrial projects. He was moderately successful, which allowed the young Naqqara to attend private missionary schools in Haifa, then transfer to the prestigious St. George’s School in Jerusalem in 1923. The school was founded by a British Anglican missionary order and seen as a means of cultivating civil servants, and Naqqara’s father believed St. George’s would provide his son with the training he needed for a stable bureaucratic career.65 But it was not to be. In April 1925 students from Jerusalem’s government and national schools called for a strike and poured onto the streets of the city to protest the arrival of Arthur Balfour (author of the eponymous and much-­ reviled declaration) in Palestine to attend the grand opening of Hebrew University. When the protesters reached the gates of St. George’s and urged its students to join them, school administrators blocked the entrance and forbade anyone from participating. Naqqara, who was only thirteen at the time, did not yet grasp who Balfour was or why students were protesting his visit. But the incident left a deep impression on him, and for the first time he paid attention to the older students as they discussed Balfour, British colonialism, and Zionist settlement. He also took note of the older St. George’s students who defied the administrators and snuck out of school to join the protests.66 Dissatisfied with what he felt increasingly was a colonial education, in 1926 Naqqara took the extraordinary step of leaving St. George’s against his father’s\n\n26 Strategies of Resistance\n\nwishes and transferring to the National College in Aley, Lebanon, where its secular, nationalist spirit was more amenable to the young man’s emergent political views. With an explicit embrace of the area’s four main religious groups (Muslim, Christian, Druze, and Jewish) and a motto that declared, “Religion is for God, and the nation is for all,” the National College in Aley attracted budding nationalists from throughout the Arab East. Naqqara’s classmates, who hailed from Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and different parts of Palestine, all followed the anticolonial uprisings in their respective countries and organized solidarity activities to demonstrate support for their fellow Arabs. These activities, coupled with the personal friendships Naqqara formed with students from throughout the region, led him to conclude that they were all united in a larger struggle against imperial powers and that they should not consider religious differences as an obstacle to that unity.67 Moreover, the school’s vice principal and Arabic teacher, leftist writer-­critic Marun ʿAbbud, made sure that students appreciated the richness of the Arabic language and literature. ʿAbbud invited Naqqara to join the school’s literary club, where members discussed the works of famed classical poets such as al-­Mutanabbi and contemporary writers such as al-­ʿAqqad.68 Naqqara took this spirit with him when he graduated on to the nearby American University of Beirut (AUB), itself a center of Arab nationalist activities.69 But without a scholarship, Naqqara was compelled to transfer a year later to the less expensive University of Damascus, where he continued to be involved in nationalist causes and to nurture his love of Arabic literature until he obtained a law degree in 1933.70 Taken together, these glimpses into Naqqara’s experiences at St. George’s, the National College in Aley, AUB, and the University of Damascus not only illustrate the strong overlap between nation-­state patriotism and pan-­Arab nationalism that shaped students’ outlook at this time. They also indicate the pedagogical impulse of educators to instill in students a deep appreciation of the Arabic textual tradition, which they saw as essential to fostering a nationalist spirit. In the 1920s and 1930s, as several graduates from AUB and other regional universities took up teaching posts in Palestine, this spirit would be introduced to growing numbers of Palestinian students, who themselves eventually formed a generational cohort that was more politically mobilized and textually engaged than their predecessors.\n\nStrategies of Resistance 27\n\nCIRCULATING NATIONALIST HISTORIES\n\nThe Palestine Mandate’s preamble recognized “the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine” as “the grounds for reconstituting their national home in that country,” but it offered no such recognition of the historical connection that Palestinian Arabs had to the land.71 As a wave of Zionist archaeological and historical projects emerged in the early twentieth century asserting ancient Jewish claims over the area as a basis for their national project,72 Palestinian Arab educators produced works that were aimed at countering these narratives and promoting their own people’s rootedness in the territory. Reflecting the overlapping pan-­Arab nationalist and Palestinian patriotic spirit prevalent at this time, authors sought to enhance students’ pride in Arab culture and civilization while insisting on their specific, long-­standing ties to Palestinian land.73 A key element of this project was writing and publishing history textbooks. At the outset of the Mandate, most of the textbooks used in Palestine’s government and national schools were imported from Egypt (and to a lesser extent from Syria and Lebanon), but they focused mainly on literary topics and paid little attention to history. To fill this gap, several nationalist-­minded educators in Palestine wrote textbooks on Arab and Palestinian history that sought to foster pan-­Arab nationalist and Palestinian patriotic sentiment. Survey textbooks built on the then-­popular “Semitic wave” theory of American orientalist Henry Breasted, who argued that the migrations from the Arabian Peninsula to the lands of Egypt, Iraq, and Greater Syria thousands of years ago tied Arabs together in primordial ways that predated the advent of Islam. They also carried strong anticolonial themes, denouncing the ancient Persians, Byzantines, Crusaders, and western Europeans as imperial hegemons.74 Textbooks devoted specifically to Palestinian history defined the parameters of the Palestinian state (which corresponded to the borders of Mandate Palestine) and advanced a narrative that insisted on the constant presence of a people who had for centuries called Palestine their home.75 Many of the educators who wrote these textbooks were also actively engaged in nationalist political activities, which sometimes led them to clash with their British supervisors. One example is Darwish al-­Miqdadi, author of the popular textbooks History of the Arab Nation and Our History through Stories. An AUB graduate who began his post at the prestigious government Men’s Teacher Training College in 1922,76 Miqdadi urged his students to participate in the 1925 demonstrations protesting Balfour’s visit to Palestine, whereupon he was temporarily suspended.77 One year later, Miqdadi again clashed with\n\n28 Strategies of Resistance\n\nBritish authorities after he refused to place his Arab Boy Scout troop within the Baden-­Powell scouting network, calling the organization “colonialist in spirit.”78 While Miqdadi was one of the more outspoken educators to confront British administrators, he represented a trend that would continue throughout the Mandate period and into the days of Israeli statehood: teachers in government schools who sought to instill an anticolonial spirit in their students that actively subverted the government’s civilizing mission. As the link between educators, students, and political protest expanded in subsequent years, British authorities concluded that they needed to have firmer control over government school curricula. The Education Ordinance of 1933 placed curricular decisions for government schools in the hands of the director of education, who also kept careful watch over the activities of schoolteachers. Shortly thereafter, a new curriculum was introduced that placed Palestinian history within a larger pan-­Arab context, though it rejected material that would encourage the formulation of a distinct Palestinian patriotism.79 Palestinian educators and students accused the British of promoting a policy of “stultification” (tajhil) that kept students ignorant of their history and culture.80 In their view, textbooks that laid out a generalized Arab history were not enough—­they needed to be accompanied by a pedagogical sense of purpose aimed at enhancing Palestinians’ distinctive identity and ties to the land. In response, several educators penned their own books that highlighted the intimate ties between Palestinian Arabs and specific locales in Palestine.81 At the heart of these efforts was a recognition by all parties that education, access to specific (and sometimes competing) texts, and growing political awareness were all closely intertwined, especially since students were often at the forefront of nationalist demonstrations. Through the increasing number of student-­led protests like the one Naqqara had witnessed, students, graduates, and political organizers pushed to spread their message to an even wider audience. THE PRESS AND MASS POLITICS\n\nAs British rule and Zionist land purchases in Palestine persisted during the 1920s, the traditional Palestinian elites were in a state of paralysis. Their petitions to the British for a meaningful Arab legislative body that would be elected by Palestine’s current inhabitants fell on deaf ears; instead, the elites wrangled among themselves over various political appointments that were made (and often manipulated) by the British rulers. Local Arabic newspapers of the early to mid-­1920s reflected this factionalism: editors from each paper\n\nStrategies of Resistance 29\n\nargued over who was best able to persuade the British of the justness of the Palestinian cause.82 The 1929 riots marked a turning point in this state of affairs. After several months of mounting frustration over the rise in evictions of Palestinian Arabs (coverage of which increasingly made its way into the local Arabic press83), Zionist provocations at the Western Wall in Jerusalem that August led to a series of clashes between Arabs, Jews, and the British police. British authorities and the Hebrew press focused on instances of brutal Arab attacks on unarmed Jews in Hebron and Safed.84 Meanwhile, the Arab press highlighted cases of Jewish and British attacks on unarmed Palestinians;85 they also reported on several local demonstrations that condemned British colonialism and Zionist encroachment but did not end in mob attacks.86 These demonstrations marked the advent of mass political mobilization in Palestine and a shift in the role of the local Arab newspapers. From 1929 onward, they came to function more explicitly as a means of rallying popular support around a national cause, connecting Palestinian Arabs to one another and to the region, and opposing colonial discourses that characterized Palestinians as lacking any legitimate political grievances.87 The Istiqlal Party, formed in 1932, was particularly adept at utilizing the press to mobilize Palestinian Arabs. Seeking to introduce a more explicit anticolonial discourse into the public sphere, the party turned to the press to call for noncooperation with the British, which was modeled closely on Gandhi’s program in India. Istiqlal leaders also worked with Arab Boy Scout troops, athletic clubs, peasants, and the growing number of wage laborers in the industrializing cities of Haifa and Jaffa.88 Together they held a series of demonstrations in 1933 calling for Britain to curtail the spike in Jewish immigration to Palestine, which had led to a sharp rise in Arab unemployment and displacement. The pro-­Istiqlal newspaper al-­ʿArab stressed that protesters had directed their criticisms almost exclusively at British policies, while a British intelligence report noted that “definite orders were given by the leaders that Jews were not to be attacked.”89 The British authorities viewed the rise of Palestinian Arab mass politics—­and the changing tone of the newspapers that accompanied it—­with alarm. In January 1933 a Press Ordinance was issued that controlled both the licensing and content of publications in Palestine. The ordinance gave the high commissioner wide-­ranging discretionary powers to suspend any newspaper for any period of time if he deemed it likely to “endanger the public peace.” The high commissioner\n\n30 Strategies of Resistance\n\nalso had the power to block the importation of any foreign newspaper that he feared was potentially seditious.90 Despite the restrictions imposed on journalists and editors by the ordinance, the pivotal role of the press as a means of solidarity building would continue to evolve over the following years. The press’s role in connecting Palestinian Arabs to one another was especially clear during the 1936–­1939 Arab Revolt.91 Newspaper editors not only advertised the call for a general strike in April 1936, but they also participated in it by suspending their publications for two days in a show of solidarity.92 Two years later, the rebels called for a ban on the red-­felt tarbush (fez) and for the universal adoption of the kufiya (keffiyeh) to make it more difficult for the British to distinguish between tarbush-­wearing urban men and their kufiya-­ wearing rebel brothers. The papers were so effective in conveying the message that within one week the tarbush reportedly disappeared from the streets of Palestinian towns and cities.93 Despite ongoing low literacy rates and difficulty with access,94 newspapers nonetheless made otherwise isolated rural villagers feel like they were part of the larger struggle.95 ʿAli ʿUthman, who in 1936 was a sixteen-­year-­old resident of the central Palestinian village of Beit Safafa, recalled walking long distances to buy a newspaper and bringing it back to read aloud to his neighbors. They beamed with pride when they heard the name of their village in the context of the revolt.96 Thus, newspapers served in part to connect otherwise isolated rural Palestinians to the national cause, providing them with a sense of empowerment and allegiance. The press also played a crucial role in connecting Palestine to other parts of the Arab world. Regional coverage of the revolt, along with reports of solidarity demonstrations in neighboring Arab countries, let politically active Palestinian Arabs know that their actions were being supported by their fellow Arabs, providing a measure of reassurance.97 The British, too, were aware of this dynamic and tried to blunt the newspapers’ impact. On several occasions the government blocked outright the importation of regional papers, citing the 1933 Press Ordinance as justification.98 In an effort to undermine regional support, government agents planted stories in friendly Damascus-­and Beirut-­based papers accusing exiled Palestinian Arab leaders of pocketing donations that were being collected in support of the revolt.99 Throughout the rest of the Mandate period, British authorities used the Press Ordinance (with limited success) to control both content and access in order to undermine support for the revolt. After 1948, Israeli authorities would continue to invoke this ordinance to limit Palestinian access to regional papers.100\n\nStrategies of Resistance 31\n\nDuring the 1930s, the increased stridency of the local and regional press, coupled with its utilization as a means of popular mobilization, helped cultivate a Palestinian public sphere that linked urban and rural populations with their counterparts in surrounding countries.101 Yet low literacy rates, difficulties with access and circulation, and the rapidly changing events on the ground all gave the reports and political commentary found in newspapers a measure of ephemerality. As a result, some nationally conscious Palestinian Arabs used their literary talents to develop the contours of an anticolonial discourse they hoped could achieve greater permanence, even as the press continued to spread their message to a wider audience. ADDRESSING THE PEOPLE: EARLY RESISTANCE POETRY\n\nThe tone and content of Arabic poetry in Palestine underwent significant shifts during the early twentieth century, reflecting the political urgency of the times. In the aftermath of the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, poets moved away from composing ornate verses that praised rulers and patrons, utilizing instead more direct language aimed at drawing in larger audiences. With the rise of mass politics, Arab poets in Palestine and elsewhere increasingly wrote and recited verses that criticized political leaders and urged people to mobilize toward a brighter future.102 These themes formed the basis of what would later come to be known as resistance poetry. Foremost among these early resistance poets in Palestine were Ibrahim Tuqan (1905–­1941), Abu Salma (ʿAbd al-­Karim Karmi, 1909–­1984), and ʿAbd al-­Rahim Mahmud (1913–­1948). Born less than a decade apart, all three poets were deeply affected by the tumultuous political uprisings of the early to mid-­ 1920s and subsequently became active in nationalist literary and cultural circles. By composing and reciting poems that expressed strong anticolonial views and sharp criticism of the traditional elite, these men played a central role in popularizing poetry that embraced more direct political commentary while retaining elements of elevated Arabic verse.103 As Palestinian fears over Zionist settlement increased at the end of the 1920s, Tuqan turned to verse to help his people make sense of the rapidly unfolding events around them. In 1928 he recited a poem at al-­Najah’s commencement ceremony, where family members, local leaders, and political organizers gathered to celebrate the graduation of some of Palestine’s best and brightest Arab students. Tuqan opened his poem with the lines, “Hold back your tears / Cries and wails will not help you. / A nation is being bought and sold.” As he spoke\n\n32 Strategies of Resistance\n\nof the role that the Arab landowning elite was playing in undermining their national clams, Tuqan also expressed confidence that the youth, the “hope of tomorrow,” would join together for the sake of the nation (watan) and to safeguard its future.104 Some of the youth in attendance were so moved by Tuqan’s poem that they repeated it to others, while its publication in a local newspaper facilitated its spread even further.105 Although reciting politically themed poems had been in practice for years, Tuqan’s invocation of mass mobilization as the savior of the nation popularized a theme that would become increasingly prominent in Palestinian Arab poetry. Over the years, this combination of oral and textual transmission would also lead Tuqan’s poem to become a cultural touchstone for Palestinian Arabs around the country. Two years later Tuqan returned to al-­Najah’s commencement ceremony and recited what would become another one of his most famous poems, “Red Tuesday.” Palestinians throughout the country had been shaken by the recent hangings of Muhammad Jamjum, Fuʾad Hijazi, and ʿAta al-­Zayr by the British authorities for their role in the 1929 uprisings, despite pleas from many quarters that their lives be spared.106 With the executions taking place amid an enforced media blackout,107 Tuqan’s poem placed the deaths of the three men within a larger narrative of anticolonial resistance, reassuring his audience that the deaths of the three men had not been in vain.108 Echoes of Tuqan’s verses reverberated immediately throughout al-­Najah’s campus, and nationalist-­minded Palestinian Arabs committed his verses to memory. Tuqan’s poem also inspired Mahmud, then a student al-­Najah, to undertake the writing of political poetry more seriously.109 Mahmud subsequently become famous in the late 1930s for his poems celebrating Palestinian Arabs who took part in the Arab Revolt—­ poems that were often published in the local press.110 In addition to ascribing meaning to local events, some of the poetry during this period became a means of placing the Palestinian Arabs’ collective struggle within a larger spatial and temporal imaginary. In 1937 Abu Salma wrote a scathing attack on the monarchs of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Iraq. They had promised to deliver tangible results to the Palestinian Arabs if the latter suspended their general strike in fall 1936 and allowed the kings to intercede on their behalf with the British. But the monarchs, who relied to varying degrees on the British to secure their thrones, failed to gain any meaningful concessions from the colonial power. Abu Salma began his poem by locating the Palestinians’ struggle within an expansive temporal horizon that linked his people’s condition to that of exploited peoples throughout history:\n\nStrategies of Resistance 33\n\n“Spread across the flame of the poem / the lament of slaves to slaves / a lament that echoes through time / tomorrow until forever. / They said “kings,” but they don’t / rule over even a bitter melon.” Abu Salma then honed in on the present, devoting the next five stanzas to censures of each Arab king’s servility to the British. But he ended with a hopeful nod toward the future, looking to the Arab peoples (shuʿub) to liberate the masses from imperial oppressors and their petty rulers.111 Abu Salma’s populist message, with its linkage of the Palestinian Arabs to other exploited peoples, its condemnation of the ruling elite, and its celebration of popular strength, echoed many of the radical, socialist, and anticolonial themes found in fin de siècle cultural works that had been circulated around the world and in Beirut, Cairo, and Alexandria.112 As a result, the work of Abu Salma in particular served as a bridge that introduced a younger generation of intellectuals to these concepts. They would then elaborate on these themes in the post-­1948 period. Abu Salma did not recite this highly charged poem at a graduation ceremony, or anywhere else. Initially he wrote it anonymously, whereupon it was printed in leaflets and surreptitiously distributed to the rebels and their supporters as a cri de coeur.113 The poem’s anonymity and circulation through leaflets conveyed an aura of universality: Naqqara later recalled (with a bit of rhetorical flourish) that during the revolt, Abu Salma’s poem was uttered on “nearly every lip and tongue.”114 This means of distribution reflects the oral and aural impact that followed the poem’s initial textual appearance, allowing both the literate and illiterate to take part. Abu Salma’s poem also showed other aspiring poets how well-­crafted verses that commented on major events of the day could achieve a measure of durability that press commentaries simply could not. Moreover, popular, politically themed poetry introduced younger Palestinian Arabs to discourses that were missing from their school curriculum. Such was the case with Hanna Abu Hanna, born in 1928 to an Orthodox family in the village of al-­Rayna near Nazareth and an elementary school student during the revolt. He recalled his nationalist-­minded schoolteachers introducing him to Tuqan’s famous poem “Hold Back Your Tears,” which had first appeared a decade earlier.115 But Abu Hanna’s Arabic teachers also stressed that poetry was not just about sloganeering: for poems to have a truly lasting effect, they needed to also have a high aesthetic quality. Echoing Nahda-­era themes that stressed pride in Arabic language and literature, Abu Hanna’s teachers called on students to appreciate classical poetry—­and cultural works more broadly—­as a means of connecting to and learning from their civilizational heritage. As a\n\n34 Strategies of Resistance\n\nstudent in Nazareth’s government high school, Abu Hanna joined the Culture Club, where students and teachers met biweekly to discuss the works of famous Arab cultural figures and to perform original compositions in front of their peers. Abu Hanna won several prizes for his works, nurturing his love for Arabic literature and opening his eyes to its social and political value.116 The late 1920s and 1930s witnessed the development of poetry with nationalist and radical socialist messages that excoriated imperialist powers and the servile Arab elite while celebrating populist resistance. These messages were part of a larger oppositional project aimed at condemning British colonial rule, as well as a pedagogical project that sought to inculcate in younger Palestinian Arabs a sense of anticolonial defiance and a deep appreciation of the masters of Arabic letters. Abu Hanna and others of his generation were deeply affected by these projects, which would be elaborated on in the 1940s and carried over into the post-­1948 period. THE FLOURISHING OF INTELLECTUAL LIFE IN THE 1940S\n\nAt first glance, World War II would seem to be an inauspicious time for Palestinian intellectual life to flourish. Britain’s military planners considered Palestine to be a key strategic base in their war effort, and to that end the colonial government imposed a series of austerity measures that placed disproportionate hardships on the Palestinian social and economic sectors.117 Political activities were restricted, and the delivery of regional newspapers to Palestine, even to libraries, was frequently disrupted.118 Despite (and in some ways because of) British wartime measures, cultural and intellectual outlets expanded significantly during this period. This was especially true in the urban centers of Jerusalem, Jaffa, and Haifa and in the Galilean town of Nazareth, where increased access to schooling and print material for city and town dwellers contributed to an overall rise in Palestinian literacy.119 Examining the growing vibrancy of cultural and intellectual life in these four locales sheds light on how Haifa and Nazareth in particular emerged as bases for Palestinian cultural and intellectual life—­and for leftist politics—­after 1948. Throughout the late Ottoman and Mandate periods, Jerusalem and Jaffa had been two of the most important political and intellectual centers in Palestine. Jerusalem’s wealth of national, missionary, and government high schools drew in high-­achieving students from around the country. Moreover, the Arab Col"
