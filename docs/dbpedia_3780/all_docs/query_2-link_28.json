        "text": "West Ham are facing a battle to keep Mohammed Kudus with Saudi Pro League side Al Ittihad one of the clubs interested in signing the forward this summer, a source has told ESPN.\n\nKudus enjoyed a successful first season at the London Stadium, scoring 14 goals following his move from Ajax a year ago.\n\nWest Ham, who have appointed Julen Lopetegui as their new manager, are desperate to keep hold of the 23-year-old Ghana international.\n\nBut there is significant interest from Al Ittihad -- who also have Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kanté in their squad -- as well as from a number of clubs in the Premier League and across Europe.\n\nThere is also interest from Saudi Arabia in another West Ham player, Brazil international Lucas Paquetá.\n\nAl Nassr are looking to bring in a creative central midfielder this summer and have looked at Paquetá, although any deal will be complicated by the Football Association (FA) charges brought against the 26-year-old for allegedly spot-fixing.\n\nThe FA charges, which Paquetá denies, state that he purposely received bookings \"for the improper purpose of affecting the betting market in order for one or more persons to profit from betting.\"\n\nAl Nassr are also interested in Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes. Newcastle United striker Callum Wilson is another Premier League player of interest to clubs in the Saudi Pro League.\n\nWilson, who scored 10 goals last season, has a year left on his contract at St James' Park. Newcastle manager Eddie Howe is keen to keep the 32-year-old, but he may be allowed to leave if the club receive the right offer."
