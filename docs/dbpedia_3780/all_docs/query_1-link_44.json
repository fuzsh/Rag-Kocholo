        "text": "RIYADH: Al-Taawoun football club’s Argentinian coach Rodolfo Arruabarrena said on Tuesday before taking on Al-Nassr in the Saudi Super Cup’s semifinal that their chances are the lowest among the four contenders.\n\n“Our team is technically the weakest among the participating teams in the tournament, and we aim to achieve a good result through our participation,” he said as he addressed a press conference ahead of Wednesday’s second semifinal.\n\nPro League Champions and Super Cup holders Al-Hilal face Al-Ahli on Tuesday in the first semifinal of the Saudi Super Cup, the competition that is the curtain-raiser of the Saudi Arabian football season of 2024-2025.\n\n“The psychological factors and passion are in our favor. I believe our training camp in Slovenia was good, where we focused on preparing the team physically. We have no injuries, which gives us a moral boost, and our team is physically ready to face Al-Nassr,” added Arruabarrena.\n\nAl-Taawoun coach said the match will be competitive between two big teams.\n\n“Al-Nassr is a strong rival with big names, and we aim to make a distinguished appearance, as the team did last season. We aspire to win the title and start a new season differently,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Dutch player Ashraf El-Mahdioui explained that the preparations for the season’s competitions were good.\n\nAddressing the same conference, El-Mahdioui said: “We expect a good match between the two teams. We began the season with a special training program, and we are ready for the confrontation.\n\n“At the end of last season, we were good. I believe we will present a great match against Al-Nassr, given the great confidence we have.”\n\nAl-Taawoun made it to the Super Cup competitions after finishing fourth in the Roshn Saudi League standings last season.\n\nThe traditional curtain-raiser of domestic football in the Kingdom, the Saudi Super Cup will see Al-Nassr, Al-Ahli, Al-Taawoun and domestic treble winners Al-Hilal competing for the prestigious trophy in Abha between Aug. 13 and 17.\n\nThe four clubs will compete for the honor at the Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Stadium in the picturesque city of Abha for the first time. This year’s tournament continues with the expanded four-team format introduced in 2023.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Al-Nassr’s Portuguese coach Luís Castro said: “The team’s summer camp was difficult, the results were unexpected and negative, which may affect us in the new season, but by the end of the camp, we recovered all our players and prepared well for the semifinal match against Al-Taawoun.”\n\nAl-Nassr’s Spanish defender Emeryk Laporte, added: “In Abha, we represent a big club in Saudi Arabia, and our goal is to return to Riyadh with the championship title, as we have a group of stars through whom we can achieve victories.”\n\nLONDON: After a busy summer of international sport, football fans in Saudi Arabia will once again turn their attention to domestic matters starting on Tuesday.\n\nSo will the players, some of whom played in the European Championships but on Monday were making their final preparations for the Saudi Super Cup, a competition that not only serves as a curtain-raiser to the new league campaign but gives last season’s top-four teams an early chance to claim some silverware.\n\nPro League Champions and Super Cup holders Al-Hilal face Al-Ahli on Tuesday, while Al-Nassr will take on Al-Taawoun the following day. The winners will meet in Saturday’s final, just five days before the league season kicks off.\n\nIn 2023, Al-Hilal got their hands on the trophy with a 4-1 defeat of Al-Ittihad in the final, a victory that foreshadowed a dominant league season. There have not been that many changes in the blue corner of Riyadh since then; last year they were active late into the transfer window but this year it might be a case of “if it is not broken, do not fix it.”\n\nSo far this summer, most of the movement has involved players leaving, with Saudi internationals such as Salman Al-Faraj, Saleh Al-Shehri and Abdulellah Al-Malki moving on. Preseason games in Austria went well, with wins over Al-Arabi of Qatar and Italian clubs Udinese and Como.\n\nAs is often the case in Saudi Arabia and Asia, Al-Hilal are once again the team to beat, and manager Jorge Jesus and his men will be looking in particular to Salem Al-Dawsari and Aleksandar Mitrovic for inspiration in the coming months.\n\nThe Super Cup comes a little soon for Neymar to appear in the line-up for Al-Hilal, as the Brazilian superstar is still recovering from the cruciate ligament injury he picked up in October. There are hopes he might return next month, and encouraging news elsewhere on the injury front as well; his compatriot, winger Malcom, who shone in his debut season and was one of the league’s standouts, looks to be fit.\n\nThere were rumors that two other Brazilians, left-back Renan Lodi, who has yet to impress since arriving from Marseille in January, and forward Michael, could be on their way out but they might get a chance in the Super Cup to show the coach they still have a part to play in the coming campaign.\n\nOpponents Al-Ahli are in a similar position. As yet they have not made any big signings, and Allen Saint-Maximin departed on loan to Fenerbahce in Turkey. Coach Matthias Jaissle had a successful first season in charge, with the German leading the Jeddah giants, who had just returned to the top flight from the second division, to a very respectable third-place finish.\n\nFans will be hoping that can be a platform from which to mount a genuine title challenge this season and Tuesday will offer an early indicator of that. Roberto Firmino could prove crucial; the Brazilian was inconsistent last time around, after signing from Liverpool, but has impressed during the preseason. Should “Bobby” get back to his best, he could seem like a new signing for the famous green army of fans to get behind.\n\nIn the other semi-final there will, as always, be plenty of attention on Cristiano Ronaldo. The 39-year-old returns from the Euros and is desperate to claim a first domestic trophy in Saudi Arabia since signing for Al-Nassr in December 2022. The Super Cup is not the priority for the player, or the team that finished second in the league last season, but it would take a little pressure off early in the campaign.\n\nCoach Luis Castro has come in for criticism from pundits and fans on social media. The preseason has been poor and the Portuguese boss acknowledged this, pointing out that a number of new players arrived late.\n\n“I promise the fans that we will continue to work hard to get the team moving in the right direction,” he said.\n\nThe Super Cup could prove crucial for Al-Nassr. A continuation of the summer’s bad results will only heighten the pressure, while lifting some silverware early on would help to ease it.\n\nBrazilian international goalkeeper Bento has been the side’s major signing so far. Meanwhile there has been plenty of interest from other countries in members of Al-Nassr’s star-studded squad.\n\nAymeric Laporte, the center-back who played a major part in Spain being crowned European champions during the summer, was linked with a move to Real Madrid as the Spanish side looked to replace Nacho, who joined Al-Qadsiah. Attackers Sadio Mane and Anderson Talisca, whose injury during the second half of last season was a big blow to the Yellows, have also been on the shopping lists of European clubs. For the moment, at least, they continue to prepare for the new season in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs for Al-Taawoun, they deserved their fourth-place finish in the league last season, above Al-Ittihad, and cannot be counted out. Under Pericles Chamusca, the team from Buraidah might not quite have the consistency required to challenge for the top spot over the course of a league season but they are capable of beating anyone on their day.\n\nThe Super Cup will not define the season for any of these clubs but all four will nonetheless be desperate to start off in positive fashion with a trophy.\n\n---------\n\nOn Monday, Al-Hilal head coach Jorge Jesus said he had confidence in his team to get the job done.\n\n“We clinched the title last season, and we aspire to achieve this title to kick off a new season, gain confidence, and to strive to continue winning throughout this season,” he said.\n\n“The absence of Brazilian Malcolm Felipe will not affect our team, we also have absences in terms of Kalidou Koulibaly and Ali Al-Bulayhi, but we have 20 available players. I have confidence in my players,” he added.\n\nHis Al-Ahli rival, Matthias Jaissle, said during a pre-match press conference that it was up to the directors to sign new players amid concerns about a lack of new talent coming into the club.\n\n“We have no excuse for not meeting my desires to sign new players, I have informed the management of all the team's needs, and the matter is up to them,” he said.\n\nThe German confirmed the current side had a positive training camp in Austria ahead of the Super Cup showdown.\n\n“We hope to start the season by winning this title, as we face a big team that won championships last season, and we seek to make a notable appearance,” he said.\n\n“Our fans support us everywhere, and I bet on their significant presence in front of Al-Hilal, despite not signing new players, I am confident in the support of our fans.”\n\nRIYADH: FIFA revealed on Wednesday the details of the book of Saudi Arabia’s bid to host the largest-ever edition of a FIFA World Cup to be held in a single country.\n\nThe unveiling came after the Kingdom’s FIFA World Cup 2034 official bid book submission during an official FIFA ceremony that was held in Paris on Monday.\n\nTitled “Growing Together,” the official bid’s slogan has received full support from the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It outlines Saudi Arabia’s extensive plans and infrastructure projects while reflecting the Kingdom’s historic transformation.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal, the minister of sport and president of the Saudi Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said: “Together we are working toward materializing Saudi Arabia’s dream of hosting the FIFA World Cup into a tangible reality — as outlined within our official bid book.”\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the Saudi leadership for its unlimited support of the Kingdom’s sports sector, and the crown prince for his continuous guidance and significant empowerment over Saudi Arabia’s official FIFA World Cup 2034 bid.\n\nThe official bid book provides the Kingdom’s plan to stage one of the world’s largest and most important sporting events, the FIFA World Cup.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz, speaking on the official bid book’s publication, said: “These plans will combine our rich football heritage with our deep passion for the game and will ensure Saudi Arabia’s success as the first nation to host a 48-team tournament in one country.”\n\nYasser Al-Misehal, the president of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation, said: “It is a moment that marks the natural step in the journey of developing Saudi Arabia’s football and sports sectors.”\n\nHe described the bid submission as a pivotal moment for Saudi Arabian football and expressed confidence that the bid would capture the global football community’s attention and inspire future generations.\n\nHe told Arab News: “Fans will have the opportunity to explore Saudi Arabia’s diverse locales, from the coastal cities of Jeddah and Alkhobar to the vibrant heart of the desert in Riyadh. They will experience our culture and hospitality firsthand.”\n\nThe Kingdom’s football scene has evolved significantly, and Al-Misehal said: “We now have a women’s national team, and that contributes to the country’s commitment to inclusivity and diversity in sports.”\n\nHe added that the federation would soon hold a press conference detailing the national team’s preparations and developments.\n\nHe went on to describe the submission of the formal bid book and the unveiling of the Kingdom’s plans as a significant historic moment for Saudi Arabia.\n\nAl-Misehal expressed the hope that the Kingdom’s plans would excite football fans worldwide and inspire them for generations to come.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz led the SAFF delegation which submitted the formal bid book at the ceremony in Paris.\n\nRiyadh, Jeddah, Alkhobar, Abha, and NEOM will be the five cities proposed to host the tournament. The cities will feature 15 stadiums, including 11 currently being planned.\n\nRiyadh would be home to eight stadiums for the World Cup matches, including the King Salman Stadium, scheduled for completion in 2029, which will accommodate over 92,000 spectators and would host the opening and final matches of the tournament. It will become the new home ground for the Saudi national team.\n\nIn addition, the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Stadium in Riyadh is scheduled to be a remarkable architectural marvel with triple-tiered stands and a stunning view of one of the Tuwaiq cliffs.\n\nRiyadh also includes King Fahd Sports City Stadium, which is set to be refurbished to the highest global standards. The arena is expected to accommodate 70,000 spectators.\n\nThe Jeddah Central Development Stadium will feature an architectural design inspired by the area’s local heritage and traditional wooden architecture from the historic Al-Balad, while the coastal King Abdullah Sports City Stadium will feature a natural design inspired by the Red Sea’s coral reefs.\n\nThe Aramco Stadium in Alkhobar will be situated on the Arabian Gulf coast and will feature a dynamic design inspired by the sea while, in Abha, King Khalid University Stadium is set to undergo an expansion to increase its capacity to over 45,000 during the tournament.\n\nMeanwhile, NEOM Stadium is expected to be one of the most distinctive, and iconic, stadiums in the world. The arena will be situated within The Line and will provide an unprecedented experience for fans. The stadium will also run entirely on renewable energy, generated primarily from wind and solar sources.\n\nLeveraging the Kingdom’s diverse and picturesque geography, the hosting plan also includes 10 other host locations scheduled to be the home of some of the training camps for participating teams.\n\nSaudi Arabia would have more than 230,000 rooms available across the five host cities, in line with FIFA requirements. These rooms would cater to VIPs, FIFA delegations, participating teams, media personnel, and fans.\n\nA total of 132 training venues located across 15 cities are proposed as base camps for the 48 teams, including 72 locations designated for Base Camp Training Sites, with referees scheduled to have access to two Referee Base Camp Training Sites.\n\nThe official bid book outlines the 10 proposed FIFA Fan Festival sites in the Kingdom. FIFA will select one site in each host city from a list that includes King Salman Park in Riyadh, which is set to become the world’s largest urban park.\n\nOther sites include the Jeddah Waterfront on the Red Sea; the Al Bihar Square in Abha; the marina within The Line project in NEOM; and King Abdullah Park in Alkhobar.\n\nShould the Kingdom be granted the right to host the FIFA World Cup 2034, it would rank among the most-watched sporting events in history, while providing an unforgettable experience for all."
