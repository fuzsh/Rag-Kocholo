        "text": "JEDDAH: Al-Ittihad FC has unveiled its kit for the 2024/25 season in collaboration with Nike.\n\nAl-Ittihad presented its distinctive new kit in photo sessions in the center of historic Jeddah, among its alleys and ancient buildings, in cooperation with Al-Balad Development Company, the club’s official sponsor.\n\nThe classic striped design in yellow and black is based on the Nike shirt, with its authentic heritage, which fans have loved and celebrated for 97 years.\n\nThe kit’s new design represents the architectural style, “Rawashin,” the prominent traditional wooden panels used to cover windows and external openings at the old houses of Jeddah — considered an icon of the city’s heritage.\n\nDomingos De Oliveira, CEO of Al-Ittihad Club, described the new kit as a symbol of the club’s history: “We worked closely with Nike in order to ensure access to the best that can be presented in the new kit, while preserving the established values of the basic kit, which represents a unique identity, after maintaining it for nearly a century.\n\n“In the new kit, we worked to blend the heritage of Al-Ittihad Club with the history of the region from which it started, with a modern spirit that creates innovation in order to emerge with a product that reflects the club’s vision of starting from the base of its great history toward more glory and development in the current era and the future.\n\n“Attention was paid to all the details in terms of the degree of color and their overlapping in the dividing line between them in the same way that the wooden columns in the Rawashin buildings of Jeddah are intertwined.”\n\nFor the first time, the home kit will be presented in three categories — the official home kit, which the players will wear, the stadium category, and the fans category.\n\nLONDON: After a busy summer of international sport, football fans in Saudi Arabia will one again turn their attention to domestic matters starting on Tuesday.\n\nSo will the players, some of whom played in the European Championships but on Monday were making their final preparations for the Saudi Super Cup, a competition that not only serves as a curtain-raiser to the new league campaign but gives last season’s top-four teams an early chance to claim some silverware.\n\nPro League Champions and Super Cup holders Al-Hilal face Al-Ahli on Tuesday, while Al-Nassr will take on Al-Taawoun the following day. The winners will meet in Saturday’s final, just five days before the league season kicks off.\n\nIn 2023, Al-Hilal got their hands on the trophy with a 4-1 defeat of Al-Ittihad in the final, a victory that foreshadowed a dominant league season. There have not been that many changes in the blue corner of Riyadh since then; last year they were active late into the transfer window but this year it might be a case of “if it is not broken, do not fix it.”\n\nSo far this summer, most of the movement has involved players leaving, with Saudi internationals such as Salman Al-Faraj, Saleh Al-Shehri and Abdulellah Al-Malki moving on. Preseason games in Austria went well, with wins over Al-Arabi of Qatar and Italian clubs Udinese and Como.\n\nAs is often the case in Saudi Arabia and Asia, Al-Hilal are once again the team to beat, and manager Jorge Jesus and his men will be looking in particular to Salem Al-Dawsari and Aleksandar Mitrovic for inspiration in the coming months.\n\nThe Super Cup comes a little soon for Neymar to appear in the line-up for Al-Hilal, as the Brazilian superstar is still recovering from the cruciate ligament injury he picked up in October. There are hopes he might return next month, and encouraging news elsewhere on the injury front as well; his compatriot, winger Malcom, who shone in his debut season and was one of the league’s standouts, looks to be fit.\n\nThere were rumors that two other Brazilians, left-back Renan Lodi, who has yet to impress since arriving from Marseille in January, and forward Michael, could be on their way out but they might get a chance in the Super Cup to show the coach they still have a part to play in the coming campaign.\n\nOpponents Al-Ahli are in a similar position. As yet they have not made any big signings, and Allen Saint-Maximin departed on loan to Fenerbahce in Turkey. Coach Matthias Jaissle had a successful first season in charge, with the German leading the Jeddah giants, who had just returned to the top flight from the second division, to a very respectable third-place finish.\n\nFans will be hoping that can be a platform from which to mount a genuine title challenge this season and Tuesday will offer an early indicator of that. Roberto Firmino could prove crucial; the Brazilian was inconsistent last time around, after signing from Liverpool, but has impressed during the preseason. Should “Bobby” get back to his best, he could seem like a new signing for the famous green army of fans to get behind.\n\nIn the other semi-final there will, as always, be plenty of attention on Cristiano Ronaldo. The 39-year-old returns from the Euros and is desperate to claim a first domestic trophy in Saudi Arabia since signing for Al-Nassr in December 2022. The Super Cup is not the priority for the player, or the team that finished second in the league last season, but it would take a little pressure off early in the campaign.\n\nCoach Luis Castro has come in for criticism from pundits and fans on social media. The preseason has been poor and the Portuguese boss acknowledged this, pointing out that a number of new players arrived late.\n\n“I promise the fans that we will continue to work hard to get the team moving in the right direction,” he said.\n\nThe Super Cup could prove crucial for Al-Nassr. A continuation of the summer’s bad results will only heighten the pressure, while lifting some silverware early on would help to ease it.\n\nBrazilian international goalkeeper Bento has been the side’s major signing so far. Meanwhile there has been plenty of interest from other countries in members of Al-Nassr’s star-studded squad.\n\nAymeric Laporte, the center-back who played a major part in Spain being crowned European champions during the summer, was linked with a move to Real Madrid as the Spanish side looked to replace Nacho, who joined Al-Qadsiah. Attackers Sadio Mane and Anderson Talisca, whose injury during the second half of last season was a big blow to the Yellows, have also been on the shopping lists of European clubs. For the moment, at least, they continue to prepare for the new season in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAs for Al-Taawoun, they deserved their fourth-place finish in the league last season, above Al-Ittihad, and cannot be counted out. Under Pericles Chamusca, the team from Buraidah might not quite have the consistency required to challenge for the top spot over the course of a league season but they are capable of beating anyone on their day.\n\nThe Super Cup will not define the season for any of these clubs but all four will nonetheless be desperate to start off in positive fashion with a trophy.\n\nRIYADH: The Saudi Arabian football season of 2024-2025 kicks off next week when last year’s top four finishers in the Roshn Saudi League compete for the Saudi Super Cup.\n\nThe traditional curtain-raiser of domestic football in the Kingdom, the Saudi Super Cup will see Al-Nassr, Al-Ahli, Al-Taawoun and domestic treble winners Al-Hilal competing for the prestigious trophy in Abha between Aug. 13 and 17.\n\nThe four clubs will compete for the honor at the Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz Stadium in the picturesque city of Abha for the first time.\n\nThis year’s tournament continues with the expanded four-team format introduced in 2023.\n\nThe semifinals will see Al-Hilal face Al-Ahli on Aug. 13, with Al-Nassr taking on Al-Taawoun the following day. The final is to be held at 7:15 p.m. Saudi time on Aug. 17.\n\nAl-Hilal, as treble winners last season, will be aiming to maintain their impressive form from the 2023-24 campaign which saw the Riyadh side, under Portuguese manager Jorge Jesus, secure their record 19th league title.\n\nPortugal’s Ruben Neves, Serbian duo Aleksandar Mitrovic and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, and the returning Neymar are all set to feature in the season-opening competition.\n\nAl-Ahli, who are returning for their second top-flight season, will provide a tough test for last year’s champions as the Jeddah club aim to secure their first Super Cup victory since 2016.\n\nWith a strong pre-season behind them and featuring the return of international stars in Edouard Mendy, Riyad Mahrez and Roberto Firmino, Al-Ahli will be difficult to beat.\n\nAl-Nassr, led by Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, will have their sights set on redemption going into the new season, after a dramatic penalty shoot-out defeat in the King Cup final ended a difficult campaign.\n\nWith new signing Brazilian goalkeeper Bento set to feature, the Riyadh side will be aiming to add to their two previous successes in the Saudi Super Cup.\n\nAl-Taawoun will look to replicate the fine form that saw the Buraydah outfit achieve an impressive fourth-place finish in the top flight. Led for the first time by new manager Rodolfo Arruabarrena, the side will aim to provide an early shock in the new season.\n\nThe Saudi Super Cup represents the start of a historic new season of domestic football in Saudi Arabia and is the first football tournament to take place in the Kingdom since the historic announcement of the country’s official bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup.\n\nFor more information on how to purchase tickets for the Saudi Super Cup, visit: https://webook.com/en/saudi-super-cup-2024\n\nRIYADH: FIFA revealed on Wednesday the details of the book of Saudi Arabia’s bid to host the largest-ever edition of a FIFA World Cup to be held in a single country.\n\nThe unveiling came after the Kingdom’s FIFA World Cup 2034 official bid book submission during an official FIFA ceremony that was held in Paris on Monday.\n\nTitled “Growing Together,” the official bid’s slogan has received full support from the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It outlines Saudi Arabia’s extensive plans and infrastructure projects while reflecting the Kingdom’s historic transformation.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal, the minister of sport and president of the Saudi Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said: “Together we are working toward materializing Saudi Arabia’s dream of hosting the FIFA World Cup into a tangible reality — as outlined within our official bid book.”\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the Saudi leadership for its unlimited support of the Kingdom’s sports sector, and the crown prince for his continuous guidance and significant empowerment over Saudi Arabia’s official FIFA World Cup 2034 bid.\n\nThe official bid book provides the Kingdom’s plan to stage one of the world’s largest and most important sporting events, the FIFA World Cup.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz, speaking on the official bid book’s publication, said: “These plans will combine our rich football heritage with our deep passion for the game and will ensure Saudi Arabia’s success as the first nation to host a 48-team tournament in one country.”\n\nYasser Al-Misehal, the president of the Saudi Arabian Football Federation, said: “It is a moment that marks the natural step in the journey of developing Saudi Arabia’s football and sports sectors.”\n\nHe described the bid submission as a pivotal moment for Saudi Arabian football and expressed confidence that the bid would capture the global football community’s attention and inspire future generations.\n\nHe told Arab News: “Fans will have the opportunity to explore Saudi Arabia’s diverse locales, from the coastal cities of Jeddah and Alkhobar to the vibrant heart of the desert in Riyadh. They will experience our culture and hospitality firsthand.”\n\nThe Kingdom’s football scene has evolved significantly, and Al-Misehal said: “We now have a women’s national team, and that contributes to the country’s commitment to inclusivity and diversity in sports.”\n\nHe added that the federation would soon hold a press conference detailing the national team’s preparations and developments.\n\nHe went on to describe the submission of the formal bid book and the unveiling of the Kingdom’s plans as a significant historic moment for Saudi Arabia.\n\nAl-Misehal expressed the hope that the Kingdom’s plans would excite football fans worldwide and inspire them for generations to come.\n\nPrince Abdulaziz led the SAFF delegation which submitted the formal bid book at the ceremony in Paris.\n\nRiyadh, Jeddah, Alkhobar, Abha, and NEOM will be the five cities proposed to host the tournament. The cities will feature 15 stadiums, including 11 currently being planned.\n\nRiyadh would be home to eight stadiums for the World Cup matches, including the King Salman Stadium, scheduled for completion in 2029, which will accommodate over 92,000 spectators and would host the opening and final matches of the tournament. It will become the new home ground for the Saudi national team.\n\nIn addition, the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Stadium in Riyadh is scheduled to be a remarkable architectural marvel with triple-tiered stands and a stunning view of one of the Tuwaiq cliffs.\n\nRiyadh also includes King Fahd Sports City Stadium, which is set to be refurbished to the highest global standards. The arena is expected to accommodate 70,000 spectators.\n\nThe Jeddah Central Development Stadium will feature an architectural design inspired by the area’s local heritage and traditional wooden architecture from the historic Al-Balad, while the coastal King Abdullah Sports City Stadium will feature a natural design inspired by the Red Sea’s coral reefs.\n\nThe Aramco Stadium in Alkhobar will be situated on the Arabian Gulf coast and will feature a dynamic design inspired by the sea while, in Abha, King Khalid University Stadium is set to undergo an expansion to increase its capacity to over 45,000 during the tournament.\n\nMeanwhile, NEOM Stadium is expected to be one of the most distinctive, and iconic, stadiums in the world. The arena will be situated within The Line and will provide an unprecedented experience for fans. The stadium will also run entirely on renewable energy, generated primarily from wind and solar sources.\n\nLeveraging the Kingdom’s diverse and picturesque geography, the hosting plan also includes 10 other host locations scheduled to be the home of some of the training camps for participating teams.\n\nSaudi Arabia would have more than 230,000 rooms available across the five host cities, in line with FIFA requirements. These rooms would cater to VIPs, FIFA delegations, participating teams, media personnel, and fans.\n\nA total of 132 training venues located across 15 cities are proposed as base camps for the 48 teams, including 72 locations designated for Base Camp Training Sites, with referees scheduled to have access to two Referee Base Camp Training Sites.\n\nThe official bid book outlines the 10 proposed FIFA Fan Festival sites in the Kingdom. FIFA will select one site in each host city from a list that includes King Salman Park in Riyadh, which is set to become the world’s largest urban park.\n\nOther sites include the Jeddah Waterfront on the Red Sea; the Al Bihar Square in Abha; the marina within The Line project in NEOM; and King Abdullah Park in Alkhobar.\n\nShould the Kingdom be granted the right to host the FIFA World Cup 2034, it would rank among the most-watched sporting events in history, while providing an unforgettable experience for all."
