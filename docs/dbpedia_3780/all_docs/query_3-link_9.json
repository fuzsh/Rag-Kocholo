        "text": "Our business rebranded as GRV Media in 2015, prior to which we were named after the launch website, HITC (Here Is The City). The rebrand coincided with a period of growth through launch and acquisition, and the company now comprises 45 owned-and-operated websites, social channels, and an advertising management business called PROP.\n\nGRV Media’s own brands are focused on sport, entertainment and lifestyle. Together, our owned and operated websites reach around 16m visitors monthly and are trusted and followed by more than 6.8m Facebook users.\n\nPROP, GRV Media’s tech arm, works with around 45 publishers worldwide to manage and maximise their advertising revenues.\n\nThe combined reach of the GRV network is over 37m visitors each month.\n\nOur People\n\nGRV Media remains owned and run by its founders – Vic Daniels (Co-Founder & Executive Chairman), Graham Morris (Co-Founder & CEO), and Robi Buckley (Co-Founder and Senior Developer).\n\nThe founders are supported by an experienced management team; find out more about them here.\n\nLocation\n\nGRV Media has proudly pioneered remote working since our inception in 2002. We operated successfully as a fully remote business for two decades prior to the pandemic.\n\nYou can find contact details for key members of the company here.\n\nOur Values\n\nOur visitors\n\nLike all digital publishers, we want to grow our audience, keep them engaged and entertained, and fund our operations effectively through advertising.\n\nWe pride ourselves on the speed, accuracy, and quality of the content we publish, across a wide range of topics. We are also proud to do this in ways that we think are right and decent – we do not, for example, seek clicks by publishing stories about celebrities that are unkind or hurtful.\n\nWe unequivocally do not carry advertising which promotes gambling. During the last 20+ years, GRV Media has been repeatedly approached about running gambling ads, and we have chosen to decline every time, believing this is the right thing to do for our website visitors.\n\nOur team\n\nAt the core of the business is our team of around 90 talented journalists, who are valued and nurtured and whose individual contributions are celebrated. We operate in a fast-paced environment, with ever-changing commercial pressures. We value long-term relationships with our editorial teams, meaning that all of our writers are employees of GRV, with associated rights and benefits. We believe this also maintains a higher standard of accountability and integrity journalistically, which is increasingly unusual in the freelance culture so often prevalent in digital publishing.\n\nOur partners\n\nWe believe in treating all our contractors, clients and partners with respect. Above all, transparency and honesty are at the heart of our processes and communication. Our publisher clients can be sure that we operate in an open manner, without the smoke and mirrors often associated with advertising technology. We are also proud to have been among the first ad platforms to offer a near real-time dashboard and prompt net 30 days payment terms."
