        "text": "1.Oldest newspaper in the UAE unveils new contemporary colour design\n\n2.New-look website goes live simultaneously at www.alittihad.ae\n\nAbu Dhabi Media Company (ADMC) will reveal tonight a new contemporary full-colour redesign of its flagship Arabic daily newspaper Al Ittihad (‘The Union’ in English), coinciding with celebrations for the newspaper’s 40th anniversary.\n\nThe oldest newspaper in the UAE now boasts a fresh editorial style that will be more photographically-led than the previous design and easier to navigate. The five key editorial sections (UAE; Arabs & The World; Business; Sport: Points of View) remain in place and have been redesigned to reflect the new look and feel of the publication.\n\nThe first copy of Al Ittihad rolled off a newly imported printing press in Abu Dhabi 40 years ago today. Launched by the late His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the then Ruler of Abu Dhabi, the first publication of Al Ittihad predated the formation of the United Arab Emirates. Since then, the newspaper has covered the birth of the nation and the unfolding story of the UAE as it grows into an emerging global business centre and tourism destination, watched by the rest of the world.\n\nCommenting on the newspaper’s 40th birthday, H. E. Mohamed Khalaf Al Mazrouei, Chairman of ADMC, said: “As the first newspaper to ever launch in the UAE, thereby kick-starting the development of our media industry, Al Ittihad holds a special place in our national culture. Over 40 years it has chronicled the development of our nation and today’s unveiling of its new world-class design on its 40th anniversary represents both a milestone in its own history and an important step forward in the emergence of Abu Dhabi as a regional media hub.”\n\nAl Ittihad’s website, www.alittihad.ae has also been redesigned in line with the new look for the newspaper. The popular website receives tenths of thousands visits per day from Arab readers in the UAE and beyond keen to catch up on local, regional and international news. Reinforcing its position as a pioneer of the UAE media industry, Al Ittihad was the first UAE newspaper to launch an online edition, back in 1996.\n\nCommenting on the launch of the new design, Al Ittihad Editor-in-Chief Rashed Al Uraimi said: “We have spent a lot of time listening to what our readers want from us and we understand that their needs for information, and how they want to receive it, are changing fast. Our new look has been born out of feedback from readers and our desire to celebrate the newspaper’s milestone anniversary by ensuring its look is fresh and contemporary.”\n\nHe continues: “Our photography is also an area where we’re going to offer something new and different that aims at pleasing our readers. We will be focusing more on featuring images that help to tell the story, meaning the newspaper can be digested faster to suit our busier lives. We’re sure this new style is going to be a big hit with our readers.”\n\nAvailable throughout the UAE, Al Ittihad is published seven days a week.\n\nAbout Abu Dhabi Media Company\n\nADMC, is one of the fastest-growing multi-platform media organizations in the Middle East. It owns and operates a range of television channels (Abu Dhabi Al Oula, Abu Dhabi Al Emarat, Abu Dhabi Al Riyadiya, Abu Dhabi Al Riyadiya 2, Abu Dhabi Al Riyadiya 3, Abu Dhabi +1 and National Geographic Abu Dhabi) and a network of radio stations (Abu Dhabi FM, Emarat FM, Star FM, Holy Quran FM), as well as number of publications (Al Ittihad newspaper, The National Newspaper, Zahrat Al Khaleej magazine and Majid magazine) and a number of other media related businesses, including Imagenation Abu Dhabi (that is developing, financing and producing full length feature films and digital content for Arabic and international markets), LIVE (which owns a fleet of outdoor HD broadcast vans) and a state of the art printing press, United Printing Press.\n\nFor more information, kindly contact:\n\nOmar Abedrabbo\n\nAbu Dhabi Media Company\n\n00971 50 5842741\n\nOmar.abedrabbo@admedia.ae\n\nOr\n\nSawsan Abu Omar\n\nAbu Dhabi Media Company\n\n00971 50 6169707\n\nSawsan.abuomar@admedia.ae"
