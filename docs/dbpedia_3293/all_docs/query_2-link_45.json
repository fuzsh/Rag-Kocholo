Many of Sixtus V's initiatives seem to have been inspired of his predecessor, Pope Paul III. Consequently I became interested in the career and history of Paul III and his family — the Farneses, the way in which they acquired their power and the manner in which they used and kept it. I also found it interesting to try to re-evaluate the Farnese pope and his family, because his and the family's reputation in Protestant Denmark and Northern Europe as a whole was and is the worst possible. Luther and Calvin both called him the Antichrist, even the Devil himself. But also in Catholic Italy and Southern Europe the Farnese family and Paul III were severely criticized from the very beginning. One might ask. if-this heavy and lengthy criticism from a modern point of view is reasonable and if it perhaps is time to reconsider the whole Farnese achievement. As stated in the introduction, the modern literature on the Farneses is so overwhelming that one could ask whether my project really was worthwhile. My answer to this is in the first place that their arcbves are so full of still unused material (I could only dream of having had much more time in the archives in Parma and in Naples) and in the second place and most important: 1 have noticed a lacuna in the literature in which the family history as a whole is taken up. The latest 30 years of in-depth Farnese-publications have concentrated either on the papal, Roman and Lazial part of the story or on the Farnese duchies of Parma-Piacenza. IVly intention with the book has been to try to fill in this gap between the two separate directions of research and to give an all-over description and analysis of the family's achievements — with special regard to their contribution to and use of culture, architecture and art on their way to — and in possession of — power and influence. My thanks go to the Italian archives, libraries and museums and their staffs, where I have always been kindly received and serviced. Among those, special mention should be made of The Vatican Library, the Bibliotheca.and the Fototeca Hertziana in Rome, the Archivio di State ín Parma and the Archivio di Stato in Naples. Also the parallel Danish institutions: the Royal Library, \"Daninarks Kunstbibliotek\" (the Danish National Art Library) and the National Museum (all in Copenhagen) have been of great help and have provided some very important illustrations. Among the many colleagues and friends who have helped me during my research I mention from my own university: Professor Ulf Hedetoft,,Head of the Department for History, International & Social Studies, and his predecessor Soren Dosenrode who both took a great interest in my project, Kirsten Bach Larsen who generously helped me with the illustrations, Eva Hal-\n\nThe writing of the manuscript was initiated in 2001, finished in 2004 in Danish and translated into English in 2005.

INTRODUCTION: OBJECTIVE, CONCEPTS, METHOD AND LITERATURE IN MÉDIAS RES In the beautiful, undulating volcanic landscape to the north of Rome — northern Lazio — there stands a fantastic palace, Caprarola, from the 16th century. It has princely or royal dimensions and stands high above the little town of the same name. Officially, this building is called the Villa Farnese at Caprarola. It was built between 1558 and 1575 by Cardinal Aléssandro Farnese the Younger (1520-1589). The architect was one of the greatest talents of the day, Giacomo Barazzi da Vignola, and most of the magnificent rooms in the interior were decorated by the leading painters of the time, including the brothers Taddeo and Federico Zuccari (Fig. 1). The building of this magnificent edifice can without any exaggeration be called an outstanding visiting card for the Farnese dynasty, which had its roots in northern Lazio. For in the space. of 100 years, the family had had a fabulous social career. As late as the beginning of the 15th century, the family had been unknown beyond the immediate locality,, consisting merely of minor landowners and farmers who especially possessed land in and around the small towns to the west of Lake Bolsena (see map Fig. 13). A GLIMPSE OF THE HISTORY OF THE FARNESS FAMILY\n\nAccording to family records from its zenith in the 16th century, the family could trace its ancestry back to the Lombards — indeed even a Cappodician (Asia Minor) origin was suggested — and by the early Middle Ages it played an important role in central Italy as a military family or even as condottieri and to a certain extent also as local authority officials in larger cities nearby. But a closer examination of the family history soon makes such myths turn pale. In brief, in 1400 the family was quite insignificant and was clearly overshadowed by the old land-owning nobility of upper Lazio. Only when we come to Ranuccio Farnese the Elder (d. 1450), who was a condottiere, is the family a well-established family of local landowners, but now starts a period of marriage into older and more important local families. Several of the family members also made careers as condottieri but still at a modest level. The crucial figure in the family is Alessandro the Elder (b. 1468) who turns away from a military career and takes a humanist and legal education which takes him to the Curia in Rome. Here he makes a rapid career, becoming the favourite of Pope Alexander VI Borgia, and being created cardinal at the age of 25. When, after waiting for forty years, he becomes Pope in 1534 under the name of Paul III (Fig. 2), his family has its historical opportunity and Paul III follows a traditional but effective nepotistic policy of placing children and grandchildren in important posts in and outside the Curia. The duchy of Castro (within the Papal States and close to the old family possessions in upper Lazio) is established in 1537 for his son Pierluigi who also becomes a papal gonfaloniere (commander). His oldest grandson\n\n2\n\nFig. 1. The Villa Farnese a ςCaprārola (photo; Henrik $jerre 1974).\n\nAlessandro becomes a cardinal and the next oldest Ottavio s given the small duchy of Camerino within the territory of the Papal States. 1545 becomes a crucial year in which the son Pierluigi is appointed duke of the northernmost provinces of the Papal States, Parma and Piacenza. In 1547 the Farnese family experiences a catastrophe í ń that Pierluigi is assassinated at Piacenza after disputes with the local nobility and the imperial governor of Milan. The province of Piacenza is lost, and PaulIÍI dies in the middle of the crisis in 1549. Meanwhile, Pierluigi's son Ottavio retains Parma by force and in.1556 Ottavio and his heirs are recognized by the Spanish King Philip II as dukes of both Parma and Piacenza, although on strict conditions. However, this heralds a phase of reco ństruction and consolidation, and It.\n\n3\n\nFig. 2. Medal bearing the 'pörtrait o£ Paul` Ill, 1546. National Museum; Copenhagen. Royal Collection of Coins and Medals (museum photo). .\n\ntavío (d. 1586) determinedly and single=mindedlly.builds up his ducal power; his son Alessandro (d. 1593) marries a Portuguese princess and personally serves as Philip T'Is statholder in the rebellious Spanish Netherlands where he gains military and political fame on a European level (Fig 3). ä On the domestic front his father Ott avio and his son Ranuccio (d. 1622)\" are the builders of the duchy (in terms of law, `adminístration and finances). By 1630 Farnese power both within and outside the boundaries of the duchy is a fact, although disputes with the Pope in.thei1640s lead to the loss of the duchy of Castro. By the time the male line dies out in 1731, the last female member of the family has already carved herself a fine career and is married to the heir to the Spanish throne. So from 173 2 Parma and Piacenzό are governed by the Spanish Bourbons from Naples. During the Napoleonic era the two duchies experience attacks, abolition and integration with other Italian provinces, but are re established after the congress of, ,Vienna in-1814. With the Italian Risorgimento in the 1850s Parma and Piacenza become ordinary provinces in the new Kingdom of Italy, and the remains of the BourbonParma family still exist today though in watered down versions. AIMS AND APPROACHES\n\nThe object of the following account is to analyse this process more fully and to discover how it was possible for such a relatively new, upstart family to experience such a career as this. We shall analyse the objectives and the means they employ in this quite unique example of political ambition and determination in a world that in the sixteenth century was undergoing radical change — from the medieval decentralised feudal system to the emergence of the modern state. We shall consider the family history from about 1450, but naturally first and foremost the age of Paul III (1534-1549) when the crucial breakthroughs became possible. However, the work of the first four dukes of Parma and Piacenza to construct a modern princely state in political, administrative, economic and financial senses (1545-1630) will also be\n\n4\n\nFig. 3. Duke Alessandro Farnese as the adversary of the Netherlandish heretics. Print from 1586 (from L. van der Essen vo1. V 1937).\n\nconsidered in depth. There might be .disagreement as to whether the final date of 1630 is appropriate, but the idea is to examine the emergence of a family dynasty; and, as will be seen, it can be maintained that by 1630 establishment and consolidation has taken place and that it is consequently possible to take stock of developments so far. One of the principle motives for this study ís, however, to analyse and evaluate the family's use of contemporary humanist and Renaissance culture, most especially as it found visual expression in art, architecture and ceremonial in the work of building up and legitimising itself as a ruling dynasty and creating a modern ducal state with a capital city, royal residence and a dignified external and visible court life. Where the other -rulers in northern and central Italy had built up their princely status over many generations, the Farneses were in fact new in 1537, when the small duchy of Castro was established, and in 1545 they had only limited experience when serious moves were made to establish the far more important duchies of Parma and Piacenza. So the Farneses were upstarts and had to achieve what other ducal states and families had attained over many years. So the second part of the problem\n\n5\n\nis to examine and demonstrate how greatan importance this manifestation in the broad sense played for the creation of a dynasty and the construction of a duchy like that of the Farneses. FAMILIA, DYNASTY, STATE\n\nThe following are a few reflections on concepts and methods. With regards to the concept of familia it can be said that an important antecedent to the new ruling families or dynasties as they became, must in reality be found into the medieval concepts of clan, familia or house. Irrespective of whether these families developed into crowned heads or continued as noble families, the background is the same, that is to say agriculture, the amalgamation of estates and warfare except on a higher level and ever more extensively. During the late Middle Ages a trend can be perceived towards splitting up the old clans into narrower and more distinct family groupings. These narrower family groupings consisted of real blood relatives who had widely different positions — political, social and financial — in society, but were held together precisely by the common family name, whether it was called familia, casa or corte. The familia also included a further group of advisers, servants and other employees. A few researchers have a rather playfully christened concept of raison d'état (that is to say the separation of the state as an autonomous political unit which appears in the sixteenth century) as ragion di famiglia.\n\nTo a quite special extent, the families that achieved a true princely status were aware of the new potential in the nascent humanism and Renaissance in so far as there here was a variety of instruments and means that could promote the family in a different and more modern world that centred on the incipient concept of the state both in an organisational form (centralisation, power of the state, taxation, bureaucracy and permanent military forces) and in the manifestation of power (architecture, painting, sculpture, town planning, the building of capital cities and seats for the reigning monarchs). In this connection it was inevitable that the family's quite special backgrounds and policies should be presented and demonstrated in a kind of mythology that could justify and legitimise their political and social rise. THE THEORY OF MAGNIFICENZA\n\nThe construction of a special culture of the ruler and the court in expensive and visible frameworks also forms part of the raising and legitimatisation of the rulers' ever-growing position of power in the state. The theory of conspicuous consumption as formulated more than a hundred years ago by Ch. Weblen, or the exhibition of magnificenza as the phenomenon can more adequately be called using the Italian expression, has been discussed and summarised for instance by Peter Burke, who points out that it is primarily a question of a communication of power, wealth and competition. A more precise definition of magnificenza or conspicuous consumption in-\n\n6 eludes the visual exercise of power: elegant settings (architecture and tòwn plan-` níng), symbols (statues, paintings, illustrations) and actions (ceremonies/rites). We know this (un -)holy trinity from all historical epochs: In ancient Babylon, ín ancient Rome and in Nazi Germany we see this manifestation pow-:> er by means of building, visual art and ceremonial In the Middle Ages it was the Catholic Church that almost ensured a mónopoly of this use of magnnficenza,' represented by (1) the building of chur ches, (2) their sumptuous interiors (altarpieces, -frescoes, costly reliquaries etc.) and (3) the attendant ceremonies, primarily the Catholic Mass The me cheval princes and the feudal nobility had their castles and estates and natu' rally various social mores (including tournaments and feasts), but life was first and foremost characterised by battle and defence (my home is my castle) on account of the decentralised and feudal basic structure of society. More splendid palatial architecture, a widespread tradition for painting and an elaborate ceremonial were amainly alien to these groups prior to the fifteenth century. When the 11th-century Italran cities started prospering, they were the first to demonstrate a connection ° between the power of the leading strata of the population and the architecture, decoration and ceremonial of the city cornmunity. These' initiatives were usually realised in interplay with the local church, but they nevertheless suggested a,first serious alternative to a domi pant Church. The transformation of the small municipalities into increasingly temporal states under the emerging signori \"truly betokened a breach in the monopoly hitherto held by the Church. And precisely in the 15th century, this course of development became especially interesting because the humanists openly discussed magnzficenza and manifestation. In their dissertations; the humanists' formulated points of view of and demands on the manifestations that the temporal powers could and should employ. As it is put ín modern terms by Richard Krautheimer, there was in the case of architecture: \"a vision of the social function and mission of architecture. The aim was to create worthy frameworks for the worthy actions of worthy people\". Architecture was naturally joined by the visual arts painting and sculpture. Among the many elements in the manifestation of modern princely power, we repeatedly find a capital city, a royal residence, a park with a summer residence, a court theatre, a court chapel, statues of the ruling dynasty's leading members in a public space, a family mausoleum, and indoors there would be paintings and sculpture with motifs taken from classical, biblical and dynastic history. To this we can finally add the outward ritualisation of power as expressed in public events, entratas, the reception of distinguished guests and special days or events relating to the old city authority, the state or the ruling dynasty such as jubilees, coronations, births, baptisms, weddings and funerals. A late 16th-century theorist, Arnoldus Clapmarius, gives a good impression of the concepts of the time and a precise formulation of the idea behind the great processions and ceremonial court events by commenting that the mentality and understanding of the population are particularly influenced through the eye, thus emphasising the manifestation of princely power in the truest sense of the word.\n\n7 INSPIRATION ANDLITERATURE\n\nAs for literature on the visual presentation of the state power (magnificenza), let it at first be pointed out that the studies b y Roy Strong and Bonner Mitchell have been an especially important source of inspiration. To this, naturally, must be added the fact that many historians of culture, architecture and art specialising in Italy, Rome and the Farnese family, such as Lauro Martínes, André;Chastel, Charles Stinger, Clare Robertson, Julian Kliemann, Loren Partridge, Bruno Adorni, Giuseppe Bertini, Ingeborg Walter and Roberto Zapperi have dug deep in the material and produced important studies to which this book is profoundly indebted. There is an extensively, indeed disturbingly extensive specialist literature on the Farnese family. On account of the well-developed Italian tradition for written documents in the period of humanism and the Renaissance, the amount of archival material is quite overwhelming. Although the Farnese archives were harshly treated during the family's later history, leading to their being scattered among many different archives, for instance the Roman State Archives, the Vatican Archives and Library, the Naples State Archives and libraries and archives in Parma and Piacenza, an enormous amount of source material has been preserved. A good part of this has been published, but there is nevertheless still a large amount of unpublished material that has never been systematically examined. Among the major works on the family, G. Drei's I Farnese, 1954 despite its age still stands out as a solid presentation of the general and political history of the Farneses, while the more recent E. Nasalli Rocca, 1969 especially is useful in the field of personal biography. The family's most important profiles each have their own biographers: P. Capasso: Paolo III, I-Π, 1924, L. van der Essen: Alexandre Farnèse I-V, 1932-35 and most recently Clare Robertson: Il gran Cardinale (Cardinal Alessandro (d. 1589)), 1992. There are no actual monographs or biographies on Duke Ottavio (d. 1586) and Duke Ranuccio I (d. 1622), but a number of studies of aspects of these two dukes' times make up for that (see notes to Chs. VI and VIII). As always, L. von Pastor: Geschichte der Päpste, vols. IV-VI, 1956-57 is a good classical lexical tool.\n\nII. THE GENERAL ITALIAN HISTORICAL BACKGROUND We first need an account of the political, economic and social background to the emergence of the princely families (i signori) and thus also for the remarkable career of the Farnese family. In producing this, we delve further back into the history of Italy. After the fall of the West Roman Empire (5th6th century AD), this ancient, powerful and culture-bearing area of Europe became the object of numerous foreign invasions and conquests by Germanic kings, chieftains and indeed by entire peoples. Feudalism, characterised by great landowners and decentralisation, became established. During these socalled Dark Ages, the idea of Roman imperial power and the Roman Empire was nevertheless not entirely forgotten and indeed, the East Roman Byzantine Empire continued to exist. The heritage from Rome also survived in Western Europe and it was revived in 800 when the Frankish king, Charlemagne, was crowned Emperor in Rome. In 963 the Frankish Empire was replaced by the Holy Roman Empire. However, the man claiming to be Christ's successor on earth, the Pope in Rome, reacted against this distant power, and during the period 1070-1300, these two \"giants\" fought each other for the control of all Europe — dominance in Italy being the most relevant in the present context. While this determined struggle was taking place, a completely new European phenomenon arose: the 12th-century Italian city and city state represented by municipalities such as Milan, Pavia, Verona, Venice, Bologna, Florence, Siena and Perugia. In formal terms, these new city states, which felt themselves to be revivals of the Roman civitates, were on the side of either the Emperor or the Pope in the long-lasting struggle between regnum and sacerdotium (Ghibellines contra Guelphs). But most of all they signified a breach with the dominant feudal landowner system, and in time these city states increased their political and economic power. It is no exaggeration, to say that these new, economic, commercial and political units in reality became independent, and in this first urbanised area of Europe, the cities became the developmental avant garde of the Continent. Strongest were the new city states in Northern Italy, but their presence was a fact as far down as central Italy. So in Italy, the large feudal landowners who dominated the rest of Europe encountered fierce competition from the newly arisen city states which became most fully developed there. During the Middle Ages, Italy was by far the most urbanised region in Europe. Thus, around 1300, Milan was probably the largest city in Europe with a population of about 200,000 inhabitants, followed by Venice, Genoa and Florence, each with about 100,000 inhabitants; a list of the ten biggest European cities, would include only Paris (with ca. 80,000 inhabitants), Ghent (50,000) and Arras (20,000) outside Italy. In production, commerce and finance, these powerful city states set the financial and economic agendas in Europe and made goods and capital available to the rest of Europe. However, like the rest of the Continent they suf-\n\n10\n\nfered severely from the plague, the Black Death, which devastated the continent for decades from 1348, as a result of which between a third and half of the population died. Partly as a consequence of this, the city states underwent enormous social, political and economic changes. The old municipal authorities and their leaders (consuls, priors) and the representative assemblies were no longer up to the task, and a new kind of leader gradually started taking over as virtual rulers. The new Italian signori families in the individual city states had started in posts as administrators, brokers or judges (for instance as: podestà or capitano del popolo),. whose original functions were limited both with respect to duration (normally one year) and authority, but as time passed, these new officials had ousted the old councils and citizens' assemblies and assumed all power in the city state. These signori such as the Visconti family (from 1450 the Sforza family) in Milan, the Gonzagas in Mantua, the Este family at Ferrara and the Scaligeris in Verona gradually made themselves into hereditary sole rulers and gradually acquired — against suitable payment either to the Pope or the Emperor, who in terms of real power were mere shadow rulers in Italy — titles such as margraves, counts or — best of all — dukes of their territories. In doing so, as signori they moved up into the princely category and thereby sought to create for themselves the legitimacy that kings and other princes in the rest of Europe had had for centuries (Fig. 4). This development was, however, not uniform and did not apply to all the city states, in that states like Florence, Siena and Venice were still formally republics, although under the Medicis from 1435-1493 Florence experienced a political situation reminiscent of that in a state governed by signori. Finally, to the south, there was the Kingdom of Naples, which for centuries had been ruled by foreign (now Aragon) dynasties. A completely different situation obtained with regard to the Papal States, which on account of the popes' residence in Avignon in southern France 1309 -1377 and the great schism 1378-1417 had more or less been faced with dissolution. The position of Rome vis-à-vis the various elements in this remarkable state had already beforehand not been particularly strong, and now it meant that hereditary signori had gradually emerged within the territories of the Papal States. Examples are the Malatesta family at Rimini, the Montefeltros at Urbino and Gubbio, the Bentivoglios at Bologna and the Baglionis at Perugia — and in reality the Estes at Ferrara, although the link only consisted of an almost automatic papal approval of the accession of a new ruler. It can thus be said that the trend was the same as in the non-papal states in northern Italy, all of which had moved towards a stronger central government and princely rule. When the Papal States once more had the Pope back in Rome'as sole Pope from 1420 an increasingly strong papal and curial centralism was established after the middle of the 15th century, which time after time came into conflict with the smaller principalities within the area of the Papal States, for instance the conflict between Pope Pius II and the Malatesta family in the 1460s. During the second half of the 15th century, meanwhile, the Papal States were still a curious hybrid of centralism: and oldfashioned feudalism. But from the time of Pope Alexander VI Borgia and Julius II around 1500, à strong new move towards centralisation took place\n\n11\n\nSTATI\n\nPerugia\n\n®Came Assisi\n\nCorsica GENOV{\n\nD\n\nNapoli\n\nFig. 4. Map of Italy as it was in the 16th and 17th centuries (drawing: Thora Fisker 2006).\n\nin the Papal States — entirely in line with moves towards the powerful princely state in the rest of Europe. Around 1400, the Milan of the Viscontis was undergoing rapid expansion and gradually coming to dominate most of northern Italy and the Po Valley and also threatening to gain control of central Italy (Florence, Siena, Papal territory etc.). This persuaded the lagoon republic of Venice to interfere and for the first time in its history to establish control over an area on the mainland. The consequence was a long series of wars between Milan on the one hand and Venice/Florence on the other. Many of the larger and not least the smaller signori could make great profits by acting as condottieri and in turn entering into alliances with or offering military support (with professional mercenaries) to one or other of the two parties. These internal Italian wars, which marked the first half of the 15th century, also brought in the Papal States and the Kingdom of Naples and gradually came to be felt as an enor-\n\n12\n\nmous burden on the incipient general economical and cultural upturn after the Black Death. In 1454, the five largest Italian states Milan, Venice, Flor' ence, the Papal States and Naples - did in fact agree on a major settlement (the Peace of Lodi), which created a league (an alliance of the participants), froze the boundaries between the individual states and ensured this by the establishment of what evolved into permanent diplomatic representation with ambassadors exchanged between the states. The Lodi system also offered smaller states such as Savoy, Mantua and Ferrara the possibility of participating. In reality, this represented the creation of classical, modern Euro pean diplomacy, which in the following centuries spread throughout the entire continent of Europe. From 1454 and for the followińg 40 years, the league was active, and the age was οn the whole characterised by peace (with a few exceptions such as the Pazzi conspiracy r.gainst Florence in the 1470s and the Ferrara war in the 1480s). All in all, however, the system worked untilil 1494 (Fig. 5a & 5b). The violent, internal Italian conflicts before 1454 turned out to be nothing at all compared with what followed in the way of external attacks in Italy, be ginning with the invasion by the Kíng of France in 1494, based οn a heredi tart' claim on Naples. The large French military force (which among other things included the mobile cannon) totally ova erturned the Italian political and military system. The French marched straight through all intermediate states (Milan, Florence, the Papal States), which either surrendered or declared themselves neutral, and the, King of France actually reached Naples within a very short space of time. The age of dynasties and the era of a more centralised state were also rapidly evolving in the rest of Europe, and the resources that the recently unified France and the new united Spain and other central European states had at their disposal could only have been opposed by a united or unified Italy. The French intervention persuaded Spain aiΙd the Habsburgs of the Holy Roman Empire also to intervene in the situation on the Italian peninsula. The entire period from 1494 to 1559 has by later ages been called the age of the Italian wars, and during this period wave after wave of French or Habsburg invasions descended on Italy. Italian politicians and observers even at that time complained at the political fragmentation that made the peninsula impossible to defend against the foreign great powers. But in terms of realpolitik, the individual Italian states tried to exploit the French-Habsburg rivalry to their own advantage. The first tó' try had been Ludovico Sforza (il Moro in Milan 1493-94, but with a catastrophic result. Shortly afterwards, • the Papal States made an attempt, and at the beginning of the 16th century, by playing on the FrenchHabsburg rivalry, the militarily astute Pope Julius TI (d. 1513) was able considerably to extend the territory of the Papal States towards the north so that large areas of the Po Valley (Bologna: and Parma and Piacenza) came under the control of the Papal States. Officially, thei policy was formulated on the basis of slogans such as \"the freedom of Italy\" and \"out with the barbarjans\"; but the words were directed at the French, who had formerly been allied to Julius II. Despite several apparently papal successes, the other party, the Habsburgs, was growing more powerful — not least after King Charles, who via inheritance and marriage had united the Habsburg territories with\n\n.\n\n13\n\nFig. 5a & 5b. In 1474, the Danish King Christian I made a diplomatic visit to Italy, which took him all the way to Rome. During his journey through the northern Italian states, the Sforzas entrusted him with the task of persuading the Emperor to invest them with a royal title, but without success. On the other hand, because kings were so rare in this area, the visit by the Danish king was celebrated wherever he went, and in Rome, Mantua and Malpaga his visit was commemorated in fresco decorations. Christian I's journey to Italy in the 1470s is examined in a broader context by the Danish historian Stephen T. Christensen, and a publication is under way of the many frescoes with Christian I as the central figure that were made in Italy after his visit, underlining the importance of the Danish royal visit. The paintings show (a) the king's arrival at the castle of the Venetian condottiere Bartolomeo Co ll eoni, Malpaga and (b) a banquet to the king's honour within the castle. Castle of Malpaga (from C. Fumagallí 1893).\n\n14 Burgundy and Spain, had become the Holy Roman Emperor in 1520. During the 1520s, Emperor Charles V came more and more to dominate the Italian peninsula, even though the Papal States u ńcler Clement VII (d. 1534) as a counterweight had sought direct co-operation with France, which at intervals had made incursions into northern Italy. The militarily powerful Emperor completely defeated the French army ín 1526 (indeed the French King Francis I was even taken prisoner), and the unexpected occurred when an army consisting of imperial mercenaries advanced south to end outside the gates of Rome. The city was stormed, conquered and plundered — as a serious lesson to Pope Clement VII from the Emperor. The Emperor had not ordered this sack of Holy Rome (sacco di. Roma) in 1527, but he could have prevented it if he had wished. The total humiliation of the Pope came ín 1530 when Clement VII was obliged to crown the Emperor at Bologna and accept his new order for Italy. This new order consisted of the Kingdom of Naples and the Duchy of Milan coming directly under the Emperor, and the smaller northern Italian states of Mantua, Ferrara, Genoa and Florence, which with imperial military assistance now became a duchy under the Medicis, becoming something in the nature of satellite states under Charles V. The Papal States retained their new territorial acquisitions and, provided the Popes were otherwise sufficiently pro-Habsburg, retained a certain freedom of action. Only Venice retained its independence ire relation to the Habsburgs.\n\nIII. THE MANIFESTATION OF POWER MAGNIFICENZA, RENAISSANCE AND HUMANISM The fact that Italian politicians and leaders of the time complained so bitterly at a politically weak Italy increasingly dominated by the Habsburgs \\vas related to the enormous cultural change that since the 15th century had raised this same Italy to a leading position in Europe, and which can briefly be summed up under the twin concepts of humanism and Renaissance. Humanism and Renaissance have been keenly discussed as concepts and periods in European history. That this discussion has led to an acknowledgement of the fact that in medieval Europe there were crucial spiritual and political, economic and cognitive breakthroughs — think only of the emergence of the Italian cities — is one of the results of this debate. But this can meanwhile in no way hide the fact that in the years around and after 1400 new trends emerged that could clearly vindicate the use of the two concepts of humanism and Renaissance. Humanism was mainly the result of Italian philosophers and poets — with Petrarch (d. 1360) as the great innovator — seeking and rediscovering the great original ancient Roman intellectuals and authors such as Cicero, Seneca, Pliny and Ovid. Cicero as a thinker and statesman became the illustrious model for politics, ethics, learning and philosophy. The new scholars rejected medieval scholasticism and medieval Latin and so to speak revived the literature of the republican and soon also the imperial age. But in time a whole group of philosophers, writers and historians grew up who also offered their services to the emerging new Italian princely courts. I signori were no longer simply to be gifted military commanders and politicians, but they also quickly realised the possibility of exploiting the new humanist sciences in their service. The princes appointed the humanists to their courts, and any prince worth his salt must now have both cultural figures and artists to hand in his court (Fig. 7). There are countless examples, and in principalities such as the Estensis' Ferrara it was obvious that the rediscovered classical culture played an increasingly important role. In histories, poems and other writings, the humanists paid tribute to the new princes by drawing parallels between them and the ancient emperors and statesmen. The new cult of Classical Antiquity also made its mark on architecture and art — again with Florence (under the Medicis) as the first example. The age of the old medieval Romanesque or Gothic buildings was irrevocably past. New churches, palaces, monasteries and façades arose all over the place in an ever. more Antique style (Fig. 6). This early Renaissance architecture was not identical to the ancient manner of building, but people of the time felt, not without reason, that Antiquity had been reborn. We need only look at the Malatesta family mausoleum at Rimini and the Montefeltro family palace at Urbino, where quite new ideals reveal themselves in the building (Fig. 9). The rediscovered writer on architecture Vitruvius from the age of Imperial Rome found a worthy successor in Leon Battista Alberti (d. 1480), who wrote on the ideal, ancient town with its central public square containing a\n\n16\n\nFig. 6. Sigísmondo Malatesta's unfinished °sepulchral monument (tempio) at R.imi4 was started by L . Alberti c. 1460 in a clearly antique temple style (photo:- Bib lioteca Hertzi an a Max Planck Institut für Kunstgeschichte, Rome).\n\ntemple, town hall and óther public buildings decorated with triangular gables and adorned with columns and pilasters etc. and arranged ín regular quarters. Concinnitas (a harmonious whole) and the (re-)discovery of linear perspective also belong in this context Similarly, sculpture and painting moved away from the medieval and schematic towards a new, more índívídual, human manner of representation that also derived its inspiration in rediscovered Roman sculptures originating in Antiquity. The young princely courts ironically enough inspired by the \"first citizen\" Cosimo Medici (d. 1466) in the Republic of Florence - were quick to discover how to make use of the new trends in culture and art, and the new group of innovators found work at the new courts as advisers, painters and architects. Although somewhat later, the Curia and the Pope in Rome were\n\n17\n\nFig. 7. Condottiere and Duke Federigo Montefeltro together with the Florentine humanist C. Landíno. Book illustration (from L. Bek 1998).\n\ninfluenced by the new Ideas from the 1430s. They especially made themselves felt from the papacy of Nicholas V around 1450, and by the end of the 15th century Rome was becoming the centre of humanism and the Renaissance. In general, the emphasis on demonstrating the potential for power and legitimacy in purely visual terms in both architecture, art and elegant courtly life gradually came to be seen as a matter of course, and the idea of displaying magnifice ńza was followed by all Italian heads of state — indeed, one can really talk of a veritable competition to exhibit the most splendid and the most up-to-date. The smaller states also followed the pattern. The courts at Ferrara, Mantua and Urbino were in fact major consumers of the new trends in modern architecture, painting, history writing, music and drama. During the last decades of the 15th century and well into the 16th, the court of Mantua, for instance, under the Duchess Isabella, was famous for its high artistic standards, and painters of the highest quality sought protecting wings of the generous Gonzaga court. Ferrara was also the centre for the most important\n\n18\n\nFig. 8. Sforzinda by Filarete is modern Europe's first capital city project and also the first plan for a radial city in which the geometrical ground plan allows all the streets to converge on the centre, where the ducal palace, the cathedral and other public buildings surround the central square. Filarete companied his plan with an exact description of the entire planning and building process. See H. Bauer 1965 (from H. Gamrath 1990).\n\nFig. 9.

As their framework and background, the new princes had the old medieval city states with their burghers' cities and monuments and they were un-\n\n19\n\nFig. 10. Marble relief from the main entrance to the Castel Nuovo, Naples showing the triumphal entry of King Alfonso in Naples in 1443. Executed in the 1450s, it is one of the earliest examples of an entry in the classical Roman style (photo: Biblioteca Hertziana — Max-Planck- Institut flit Kunstgeschichte, Rome).\n\nable to change this at a stroke, but there are examples of individual enterprising and energetic princes. As early as the 1450s, the young new dynasty at Milan, the Sforzas, wanted to establish a new capital well away from the burgher city of Milan and set the architect F il arete describing and preparing the planning of such a new princely capital, which was naturally to be called Sforzinda after the ruling family (Fig. 8). Sforzinda never progressed beyond the planning stage, but it is nevertheless in reality the oldest project for a capital city in Europe. Duke Federico of Montefeltro rebuilt his medieval castle complex at Urbino to form one of the first Renaissance palace complexes on the peninsula (Fig. 9), and about 1500, a duke such as Ercole d'Este carried out a major expansion of Ferrara by adding a new, regularly planned Renaissance district to the old medieval city. In this new district, the duke's modern residence, the Palazzo dei Diamanti, was placed near the centre, and there, too, the nobles who were dependent on the court built their palaces, so that this district became a kind of ducal zone (Fig. 11). The ceremonial and public festivities (for instance tournaments) and events from the old municipalities were also gradually adapted to the special and different needs of the growing state and princely power. Roy Strong has divided the ceremonies into three categories: the arrival ceremony for the Prince (entrata), tournament and theatre. Both the entrata and the tournament had their roots in the Middle Ages, whereas the theatre was a direct imitation of the ancient tradition. The tournament was also adapted into the\n\n20\n\nFig. 11. Ferrara c. 1500. In the foreground the m díe νa1 part of , the city, and ín the background Duke Ercole's expansion í.e. the new ducal zone of the city (from H. Gamrath 1990 1 .\n\nprincely world as entertainment, ànd dtiring the final decades of the 15th century the entrata assumed an increasingly ancient aspect and gradually turned into a triumphal procession in line with the :arrivals of the consuls or emperors of Antiquity when they returned to Rome victorious in the field of battle (Fig. 10). Around 1450, the humanist Pope Nicholas V laid plans for the Borgo Leonino in Rome, the district surrounding St Peter's, which was to be developed in accordance with Alberti's theories to form a large,. modern centre for Christianity and the Papal States, with elegant straight streets and beautiful, regular rectangular squares. The old monuments were to be rebuilt, and even St Peter's was to be adapted to the modem style. Only a small part of this plan came to fruition, but the, idea of making the Church and the Papacy visible in accordance with the new principles of the Renaissänce was here stated for the first time, and it can be said that Nicholas V's programme for the development and beautification of Rome remained valid for the next 200 years. In extension of it, Pope Julius II in 1506 started a radical rebuilding of St Peter's and the Vatican Palace — both headed by the architect Donato Bramante, who, in a Renaissance style inspired by Antiquity (High Renaissance) laid the foundàtions for the architectonic and monumental renewal of Rome (Fig. 12). As for ceremonies and processions, the Papacy and the Papal States went the same way as the Italian signori states. With the support of the humanists, the triumphal entrance procession ceremony in an ancient setting developed rapidly in Rome after 1500, and linking Christianity and the ancient Roman heritage was an obvious feature of the papacies of Julius II and Leo X. Julius Π was the warrior Pope, who at the same time as being God's apostolic vicar on earth conducted himself like another Julius Caesar and had people pay homage to him in the best ancient style when he returned to Rome in triumphal procession after his military exploits. Here, the triumphal arch was used for the first time since Antiquity — not so much the old ones as arches newly erected for the occasion along the processional route, with decorations paying tribute to\n\n21\n\nFig. 12. The dome of the new St Peter's during construction as depicted in a Spanish print from c. 1520, which in fact is laterally reversed. The picture gives a dear impression of two different styles and their dimensions: the old Christian basilica and the as yet unfinished Renaissance building (from L. Bobé 1939).\n\nthe new Caesar. This new classical tradition was followed both qualitatively and quantitatively by the following Pope, Leo X (1513-21), who through Raphael and other great artists of the age ensured that he was presented in a way that clearly underlined the ancient ancestry of the Renaissance Papacy. Leo X's many costly festivities and processions were given a notably antique character in the form of triumphal arches constructed for the occasion offering both modern pictorial homage to Leo X and ancient pictorial representations in the form of reliefs or paintings. The ancient popular Roman carnival was also taken over by the Pope and the Curia to strengthen the Papal States and the reigning Pope. Floats carrying tableaux vivants mingling ecclesiastical and Christian themes with ancient Roman allegorical scenes met on the Piazza laiona after processions round the city. The Renaissance State festival was created during these years. It was a Roma triumphans, in which the Pope more and more appeared as the heir to the ancient imperial tradition at the same time as being the successor to St Peter and the spiritual leader of Christianity. In humanist circles in Rome, they talked of a new golden age being on the way, and Leo X was greeted as a new Augustus, who, in contrast to his predecessor, the warrior Pope and namesake of Julius Caesar, Julius II, would restore peace, as Augustus had done in Antiquity. It was into this Roman and central Italian environment that the Farnese family made its entrance. In the following chapter, we shall take a closer look at the family's historical background and derivation and outline the first steps on its political career. .\n\nIV. THE HISTORY OF THE FARNESS FAMILY UNTIL 1534 Several medieval figures by the name of Farnese are known from Lazio and Umbria, but it is only from the end of the 14th century we meet members of the family in possession of land in and near three small villages in northern Lazio, Ischia di Castro, Farnese and Canino. Some members of the family found work as professional soldiers in the politically troubled Italy, and especially Ranuccio Farnese drew attention to himself in the re-established papacy after 1421. He worked as a military commander for the popes in the 1420s and 1430s, and as a reward for his contribution he was put in charge of the temporal administration of the small towns of Valentano,,Cellere and Gradoli, so that he was given a partly continuous area to administer in addition to his private lands (Fig. 13). As the head of a family and the first man to enter into a distinguished marriage, with Agnese Monaldeschi, Ranuccio thus consolidated and expanded the family's possessions and dominant local position, but his authority was limited to the immediate locality. Subsequent 16th-century myths to the effect that he became papal gonfaloniere and was awarded the Golden Rose are completely unfounded. His level as a provincial citizen can be seen from the fact that in his efforts to mark the family's progress he had a palace built in the main local city of Viterbo. Rome was simply not within range. Nevertheless, he did carry out one original act when he had a sepulchral monument for the family erected on the Isola Bisentína in Lake Bolsena. Ranuccio, who is the first Farnese to be really known at all, wrote a will in 1450 in which his possessions and entire fortune are listed, and from this it emerges that he had assets of over 11,000 florins deposited in Florence. His lands were to be divided on his death between his brother Bartolomeo, who was given the areas around the small towns of Farnese and Latera, and his eldest son, Pierluigi, who received most of the remaining possessions. Although the family had certainly acquired solid wealth, the Farneses were still not in the same class as the old Lazio families of Gatti, Vico, Savellí, Colonna and Orsini. However, via his marriage to Giovanna Caetani, Ranuccio's eldest son, Pierluigi nevertheless managed to establish a link with another of the distinguished old families, whereby a further important step in the family's career had been taken. Pierluigi and Giovanna had three sons, including Alessandro and Bartolomeo (who was married to Iolanda Monaldeschi and later came into possession of Latera and the Farnese cities) and two daughters, of one of whom, Giulia, we shall hear more later (Fig. 14). It is in this latter generation that the great breakthrough takes place. Alessandro was born in 1468 and was the first in his family to break with agriculture and the military and to go, or be sent to, Rome to take a scholarly, humanist education. There, he was admitted to the famous and at times controversial Accademia that had been founded by Pomponeo Leto, in which classical learning and the history of ancient Rome were important studies. Leto's school was a kind of offshoot of the flourishing humanist life\n\n24\n\nLago di Bolsena 03 MONTEFIASCONE VITERBO TUSCAN IA Lago di Vico ~1 Lago di Bracciano\n\nσ ROMA Ronciglione 8 Valentano 2 Caprarola 9 Ischia di Castro 3 Isola Bisentina io Farnese 4 Marta ii Canino 5 Capodimonte 12 Cellere 13 Montalto 6 Gradoll 7 Latera 14 Orbetello i\n\nFig. 13.

Between 1487 and 1489, Alessandro himself was in Florence, making a few excursions to Lazio and paying a visit to Pisa. Here, he became a fellow-student of none other than Lorenzo il Magnifico's son Giovanni Medici (later Pope Leo X) and made contact with a large number of the scholars of the day in the Medici court. In this circle, Alessandro met the teacher of Giovanni Medici and the later poet Ariosto, Gregorio Spolettino, and a number of philologists and writers. Among them we find the Greek-speaking and Greek-born Demetrio Calcondila, who published Homer in 1490, the Hebrew and Chaldean scholar Monlada, who had been the teacher of the famous philosopher Pico della Mir an dola, and Sulpizio Verulano, who published the ancient Vitruvius and was interested in Seneca. In fact, Sulpizio simply became the young Alessanciro's teacher.\n\n25\n\nGenealogy of the Farnese Family Ranuccio the Older (1390-1450) m.

Alessand_o was very satisfied with the contents of the dialogue. Alessandro 'vas also in contact with the humanist and Dominican monk Annio da Viterbo (Giovanni Nanni), not least because Annio wrote a book on the history of Viterbo and a De Viris Ilium is, in which the Farnese family was discussed (see Annexe I). According to this history, the Farnese family could trace its roots right back to the Cappadocian Farneses, who were descended from Osiris O: Together with Tarquon and Tyrrenus, the Farneses helped to found the 12 Etruscan cities. Annio makes special mention of the city of Farnese near Lake 3olsena and emphasises that during the Middle Ages, the family exerted influence as condottieres for Venice, Florence, Naples and the Papal States. Alessandro's contemporary relatives in northern Lazio had retained the same qualities as their forefathers. These men gave their successors — i.e. the Farneses around 1490 —promises of \"a radiant future\". Irrespective of the idiosyncratic information that Nanní — a controversial figure in his own time — had included in his work, it is interesting that we here for the first time have the start of a family history. A mythology was a sine qua non for a fine career. Many of the Farneses mentioned in Annexe I appeared in the later frescoes in Capodimonte. Rome and Caprarola. It is obvious that the young Alessandro plays a major role in building up the family's history and self-assuredness, in the first instance in written form with information that was later to be translated into images of the family's glorious history. —\n\nThe humanist circles in central Italy around 1500 have here been discussed at length for two reasons. To begin with because they show Alessandro as a participant in the humanist ne_work centred on Florence, and sec-\n\n27\n\nondly because, for some peculiar reason, the main source is to be found in Denmark — in the Royal Library's collection of manuscripts in the form of a letter book containing copies of letters to and from the young Alessandro (Fig. 16α & 16b). The altogether 52 letters are all written in Alessandro's elegant and easily read hand and date from the period 1487-1490. In addition to the well-preserved letter book there are a few original letters from 1504 to people in his casa. Alessandro's humanist schooling emerges in the elaborate Latin letters, and indeed there are even some Greek quotations in the last letters. A few copies of letters to and from Giovanni Medici (Leo X) have also been preserved, and their elegance demonstrates Alessandro's industry and orderliness, which according to evil tongues of the day, was ín contrast to the achievements ófthe indolent Giovanni. In 1510, the young Alessandro — though now as a cardinal — was once more to be referred to in Paolo Cortese's last and most famous work, De Cardinalatu, in which Cardinal Alessandro and his court are several times referred to as being of great importance. ,\n\nWith the sojourn in Rome and subsequently the studies in Florence behind him, it was a particularly well-educated young humanist who went to Rome in 1489 in order — like several of the other humanists referred to above — to seek an appointment as a secretary in the great curial administration. Alessandro arrived with a splendid recommendation from Lorenzo il Magnifico himself, who told Pope Innocent VIII that he recommended Alessandro as much as he would have done if he had been his own son Piero Medici. In the letter, Alessandro is described as a very fine person, who was fully versed in le lettere et buoni costumi, ... doctissimo et uno exemplio de buona et laudabile vita. Nevertheless, he was not given the desired appointment straight way, but had to wait until the following year. On the other hand, he made the acquaintance of the Vice-Chancellor, Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, whose relative Orsíno Orsini married Alessandro's sister Giulia la Bella in 1489. The close association thus made with the Borgia Cardinal started all manner of rumours in the intrigue-infested papal court. One of the best known stories is. that Giulia la Bella so captivated Rodrigo Borgia that she became his mistress. However this may be, Rodrigo Borgia was elected Pope in 1492 under the name of Alexander VI. This provided yet another opportunity for further advancement for Alessandro. By 1492 he was treasurer and the following year, at the age of 25, he became a cardinal deacon, though without being ordained priest. In 1494, Alessandro became Papal Legate to the Patrimony (his native area) and in 1501 to the bishoprics of Corneto (present-day Tarquínia) and Montefiascone as well as to the Papal Legation in Viterbo (also his native area). In 1502 he was given the papal legation in Le Marche. All in all quite a solid and rapid career. Irrespective of Giulia la Bella's possible role, Alessandro actually did well in the Curia, but the story of the beautiful Giulia clung to him, and the Roman Pasquino satire referred to him as 11 Cardinale della gonnetta (The petticoat cardinal). The Borgias' violent struggle against the feudal aristocracy in the Papal States — and not least their attempts to create a Borgia principality in the\n\n28\n\nr ~\n\n~\n\n}-~-~ τµ, ~~\n\n~ Ι\n\nλ\n\n~ 'I\n\n!\n\nr?\n\n, ~ ειτ a,a\n\n,- ή _ F • ,:`ίy Q ~~\n\n! r__\n\n-\n\n4 ëÝ ι*ftÍ° ~ dι ~ vYt~. kλ. ί?τ λ'~ 12ΙΙΛ Ύ „\n\nι u-»:leή e•+.~„~ι raro ~omvr,\n\nQt Lt~ CD\n\n►►~r\n\nt P►~\n\n~3.m τςa~ς σrnpΙ Gb~\n\n~ ~„ u λη9fY,~iΥ vnvL~ ΓΑ- Γι~ Υ ~ τ~ ύ ; 1 ρ ,~' « ~,d i\n\n(3Υι Υ ν1,\n\nίd.ρ Lή-\n\nC~{- T τ τrrτ,,,, ίd„d σι^+t.\n\n;-ι:ιJ t•\n\n1\n\nΥι,ο\n\n~+,ê•τι\n\nr--i-\n\nf 1ι~\n\n}}\n\nο7\n\nrgΤ\n\n/\n\ntmWD ~\n\nqj\n\nn-\n\n\"\n\nC o!~a cz4 !\n\n,~\n\nt~~ lu —\n\n; λ\n\n/\n\n7 ~C~ ~r'ιQ'GΥέί) αξ.m~.~\n\n~\n\nν d ί' y r :~•°rga.vtι4\n\nί\n\n_ηι\n\nl\n\nυ_ n\n\n~~ι~f7 ιι, ~a,,\n\ntτ4 m\n\nf\n\n°°\n\nν, • ï ~, .\n\niawι\n\nS\n\n,\n\n~\n\nq\n\nΓ\n\n•vι σλ\n\n~\n\n(C\n\nuu~ ~Yn\n\n1 ;L» b\n\nΙ4ΑΙ 1rrJ a ,, ,‚J Ο ®~,,é ® ,\n\n~\n\n-° 6a\n\n(\n\n1\n\n&\n\nkιa\n\n&3 ίίίλΑ4 t3\n\n! υ v°•rn 11( t,~~ έbeι ~ ~\n\n1α 4—\n\n1\n\nj\n\n1Γ°Q'CÝt\n\n'4. :-- b+α. νίηή. i ιt.'νm\n\n/LWW\n\n~\n\n2L ~\n\n~\n\ny+~ ~ f ~ , ~u n ε'-'\n\nί\n\n~rn o ι/ι~- ~T~\n\nl,l$— ~ υ ~~ ~ ~~ c-η~ι s~~°8 Ι f,~ ι ~, ~ .~t ~.*~~ ο\n\n~a r„\n\n/`\n\nc\n\n~\n\nm tί ;p\n\nύ\n\n74-\n\ní\n\nbibi\n\n?\n\nt,ηyιηι ;~k10 ι t, ¢ vt~ι ~ Lu τ 1 uε`~J ^ }\n\nΪ»\n\nq ναα ~~ê' ~ ~e „-'\n\nλ\n\nι\n\np-ρ,-ι s.t( !•σ-ι bhτt3υ' ---\n\nώ17ι.'δ\n\nrι ~b~r_i ~P-t' h~vι 1 .` ~t~Lξ°\n\n~\n\n~\n\nFig. 16α.

However, under the following Pope, Julius II, who had been one of the Borgias' mortal enemies and had settled accounts with the entire Borgia faction, our Alessandro's career progressed unhindered (Fig. 17). Alessandro managed to exchange his original cardinal's church for the larger and wealthier St Eustachio and in 1509 he hadthe bishopric of Parma added to his many prebends. During the great council that Julius had summoned in 1512, Alessandro was his right hand, opening proceedings on behalf of the Pope. Moreover, Julius II legitimised the children that Alessandro had had with the Roman noblewoman Silvia Ruffini. These were Constanza, Pierluigi, Paolo and Ranuccio, and these important papal legal documents ensured the family's right of inheritance to the family estates. The great breakthrough came, however, in 1513, with the death of Julius II and the appointment of the new Pope, Giovanni Medici (Pope Leo Χ). For this was none other than the friend of Alessa ńdro's youth and his fellowstudent from the years in Florence, and now there was no limit to the distinctions and prebends. A calculation of Alessandro's income in 1513 to be 3,600 scudi and in 1514 to be 9,300 scudi documents his entirely new situation; later, Alessandro was given Monreale on Sicily - one of the wealthiest bishoprics in Europe, and later again Avignon, which also produced a large income. It was now that the building plans for the great family palace in Rome really began to take shape. Cardinal Alessandro was also on good terms with Pope Clement 111 (1523-1534) and retained his prominent position:\n\n'\n\nThere is no doubt that Cardinal Farnese — in addition tothe fortunate coincidence with the appointment of Leo Χ. - was at the same time in the forefront of the developments taking place precisely at the start of the 16th century. That is to say that the cardinals' various households developed into sub courts under the Curia. Precisely under Leo Χ (1513 21), who himself led a costly and fantastic court life (real magnificenza), the cardinals were encouraged to dwell in as distinguished a manner as possible. This was at the same time as the College of Cardinals was losing ground in relation to an ever more independent papal power. Manifestation and magnificenza, meanwhile became the most important forms of appearance for both the papal court and the individual cardinal. The Pope's dual office — i.e. the spiritual and the temporal aspects spread to the cardinals, and a conscious creation and growth of satellite courts became a characteristic of the age. At the same time, the number of cardinals more than doubled; for instance, in 1450 there were 30 cardinals, while there were no fewer than 76 in 1565. The greatest of them emerged in the period after 1500 almost as minor princely courts. As said above, Alessandro' Farnese was part and parcel of this development. In the. great 1526 census, the Farnese court was the biggest cardinal's court encompassing 306 persons (family members, artists, lawyers, secretaries, servants etc.), a figure with which only three or four other cardinals could compete, though none could outdo the Farneses. The papal Curia was alone in achieving that.\n\n31\n\nFig. 17. Putative portrait of Alessandro Farnese as a young cardinal. Presumably by Raphael (from G. Clausse 1905).\n\nV. THE MANIFESTATION AND INCIPIENT MAGNIFICENZA OF THE FARNESS FAMILY: ISOLA BISENTINA, \"FARNESELAND\" AND THE PALAZZO FARNESS IN ROME (UNTIL 1534) The first major building commissioned by the Farneses was the palace at Viterbo referred to above. It was a fairly large and traditional Gothic palace from the 1440s. Its situation close to the cathedral and the papal palace could be interpreted as a sign of the close relationship to the papacy. But that is fundamentally uncertain, as the other major families' palaces were situated down in the town near main streets and the large piazzas. This building, neglected today, is not distinguished from the other 15th-century buildings in Viterbo, though its design can nevertheless be interpreted as a sign of the family's incipient urbanisation. On the other hand, the building of the family mausoleum with the attached Franciscan monastery on the Isola Bisentina in the middle of Lake Bolsena is remarkable. According to the will of 1450, it was Ranuccio Farnese's wish to be buried there, and the will also required that all future Farneses should finally be put to rest there. The inscription on Ranuccio's still existing Gothic monument runs: \"Hoc sepulcrum fieri fecit magnificus dominus Ranutius de Farnesio pro se et aliorum (sic'.) de domo sua A.D MCCCCXLVIII et die maij completum fuit\" (Fig. 20). The will and the history of the following 150 years clearly show that the family took the island over, made generous gifts to the monastery and church and took good care of the family mausoleum. It soon became a familiar monument, and among those visiting Lake Bolsena in 1462 on his travels around the Papal States was Pope Pius II (Piccolomini), the great humanist on the Papal throne. His Commentarii state that Ranuccio had had both the church and the monastery built on the island, which was very fertile and included both wine and vegetables among its products. On the mountainous part of the little island, several small oratories separated from each other by paths and steps were built from the start — clearly inspired by the topography of the Holy Land (Oratorio dí Monte Tabor, Monte O liveto, Monte Calvario etc.) (Fig. 18). Pius II was so keen on the idea that he recommended that yet another oratory (tempietto) should be constructed on the highest point of the island, and in addition he celebrated Mass on the Feast of St John in the island's church. Gabriele Farnese, one of the sons of Ranuccio the elder, organised a sailing boat race in honour of the Pope from the town of Capodímonte to the island, in which the young men of the various Bolsena towns competed for first place. In the above-mentioned dialogue by Paolo Cortese, De hominibus Doctis, which was set on the island, the young Cardinal Alessandro emphasised the beautiful and peaceful nature of the place (Fig. 19). It was a true setting for contemplation and study, but one of the things that appealed to him most about the place was that there were so many memories of his forefathers there. As he says specifically in the dialogue: \"In fact, my grandfather Ranuccio founded this sacrario (mausoleum), which by virtue of my father's and\n\n34\n\nο t ιατευι\n\nε\n\n%1$%U \"I PKCh .\n\nαηετο\n\nFR4NCESC Ε TABOR rο hι\n\nlago di bolsena ea9na\n\nGREGORIO\n\nIs τín 9ars\n\nLONCOROIA ΝΤΕ ALVARIO\n\nι ι . lnlo\n\n[Λ ί Φ~(ρ ® εΑίααα ~uΠ4 σΝ c\n\noirre\n\nρ οΓ1ο ήαΝ CΟ\n\n~\n\nf ~\n\nara\n\n-\n\nS.

Four of the seven now seriously dilapidated chapels derive from the 15th century and were probably built at the same time as the family.mausoleum. A further two were built, or rebuilt, by Antonio da Sanga ll o in the 1520s at the behest of Cardinal Alessandro. Pope Leo X, who also visited the island to hunt, granted the small shrines a plenary indulgence that pilgrims could achieve by visiting them. It was an indulgence on a par with that which could be achieved by visiting the seven basilicas in Rome (Fig. 21). It was clear that such a privilege would increase the importance of the island, not forgetting that all visitors would pass the principal monument, the mausoleum with the Farneses' tombs and sarcophagi. We do not have precise information on the original building complex. The church, to which was linked a Franciscan monastery in the 15th century, might have derived from the Middle Ages, but it is most likely that it was a new building erected in connection with the building of the mausoleum. It was rebuilt several times later, and the present church is of a much later date. In this church, only the sepulchral monument of Ranuccio the Elder has been preserved, and there is not the slightest sign\n\n36\n\nFig. 21. S. Catarína's chapel on the Isola Bisentina was built by S an g allo ín the 1520s (photo:` author)\n\nof the other Farnese monuments. The best evidence of the design of the mausoleum is to be found in a description from 1578, when Pope Gregory XIII visited the island on the occasion of an official visit to Viterbo. The visit is described in detail by the Pope's secretary. The reference to the sepulchral monuments is that: \"In a chapel inside the church there are the sepulchral monuments, epitaphic and coffins of almost all the deceased members of the House of Farnese...\". From elsewhere we know that in 1548 the first Duke of Parma and Piacenza, Pierluigi Farnese, and in 1569 his widow Girolama were transported and buried there, and when a small group of cardinals during the abovementioned visit in 1578 went to the island again, it is said that the sepulchral chapel contained: \"... the bodies of some of the lords of Farnese, which by being embalmed were preserved and kept so whole and beautiful that it was almost as though they were alive and simply lay asleep\". In particular the group recognised the Cardinal of . Sant' Angelo (Cardinal Ranuccio Farnese 1530-1565) \"On account of the good memory of him, there were some of those present who could not restrain their tears. They said how much they\n\n37\n\nFig. 22. The Palazzo Farnese at Gradui, presumably rebuilt by Sangallo in the 1520s.

The collective family mausoleum had functioned until then (see p. 155f.). As far as it has been possible to ascertain, the beautifully situated island with the family sepulchral church and the seven pilgrim chapels was a completely unique phenomenon and was the first monument of major symbolical value denoting the importance of the family at Lazio. It has been impossible to find other examples of rising families doing anything similar at such an early time.\n\n38\n\nFig. 24. The Palazzo Farnese at Capodimonte seen from the harbour (photo: author).\n\nOut in the old area from which the-Farneses carne and which they gradually came to dominate, Antonio da Sangallo and his assistants built, or rebuilt, the old medieval castles into palaces in the towns that had gradually been acquired or which were already in the possession of thefamily (Fig. 22). These are small towns such as Gradoli, Valentino, Ischia dí Castro, Farnese, Marta, Canino, Cellere, where a splendid centralised church dedicated to S. Egidio was also built, Montalto, Nepi (with the remarkable, unfinished round church of S. Tolomeo) and -Capodimonte. The local historical literature concerning these buildińgs is of very uneven quality, and many dates are uncertain (Fig. 23). However, it seems more or less certain that the Gradoli palace was built in the 1520s by Sang a llo, just as the octagonal palace at Capodimonte from the same time must be his work (Fig. 24). A loggia in the palace at Valentino could well also be Sangallo's work. The now muchdecayed palaces in others of the small towns belong to the same group, but they might have been the work of others after Sangallo's designs and might even be later than 1537, when the region came to be constituted as Pierluigi's duchy (Fig. 25). We are not well informed on the interior furnishing in the palaces, but in the loggia of the Capodimonte palace there still exists an interesting fresco showing the old condottiere Ranuccio (d. 1450) being invested by Pope Eugenio IV in 1434 with the status of papal - military commander. The picture, which must have been part of a larger set of decorations illustrating family history, can be dated to ca. 1528 (Fig. 26). As early as 1514, the family had had tapestries (arazzi) in the Canino palace rappresentanti le glorie di Casa Farnese, as is confirmed in writing in connection with the visit of Pope Leo X, but they have not survived. The family's great and early documented de-\n\n39\n\nFig. 25. The palazzo at Capodimonte in an entirely modern palace style with a bridge leading to the garden (from G.

J. Kliemann, the expert in this area, estimates that the Farneses were unusuallÿ early in using historical paintings and cycles as elements in the construction of the family's position of power. According to Paolo Cortese, to whom reference has been made above, and another humanist, Giovanni Pontano, who wrote the work De Μagnifi-\n\n40\n\nFig. 26.

In addition to reception rooms and the actual dwelling, the palace was also to contain a library. Humanism and magnificenza, as P. Cortese wrote in his 1510 work entitled De Cardinalatu (On the Cardinalate), were not only a delight,\n\n41\n\n1\n\n.t~ IρIpΡI ~\n\nι ~7~. α\n\nΙ\n\n,\n\nί ~\n\nFig. 27.

The impressive and beautifully burl= alace retains the social order and encourages restive, rebellious elements is keep quiet. The great models were the Palazzo Riario (Cancelleria), the new Vatican Palace and the VilLa Madama in Rome, all from about 1500 (Fig. 27). It was in reality Pope iichcaas V's proclamation from 1450 that was extended to the next level — the cardinals — in the Catholic hierarchy. The Church was not to appear in iUer_or attire, but on the contrary was to be honoured and praised with all the magnificence and splendour that were the upper clergy's obligations towards G nd's Church on earth. It was manuals such as the works of Cortese and Pontano that the up and coming young ccrdifals had at their disposal. It can certainly be said that Cardinal Alessandr ο adopted the main points as his own, as can be seen from the following. The young nev cardinal acquired his own mansion in 1495 — a former bishop's palace — in the Arenula district near the Church of St Bridget. We only know the buiHińg's appearance in outline, but it cost the considerable sum of 5,500 sc~di, and it was by ho means modest in size (see Fig. 68). The district was really =uit°d to a young, unknown cardinal, as it was anything but the most distnngúshed in Rome. However, the development of Via Giulia — Pope Julius IPs end Bramante's new straight road between the Borgo and Ponte Sisto — 5 DoE started the development of the district (Fig. 28), and not so very far awa' lay Rome's then economic and cultural \"centre\" in the Piazza Navona arιd the S. Eustachio district. .\n\n-\n\n42\n\nFig. 28. Reconstructed map of the Ponte and Regola districts in Rome with the new Via Giulia and the planned papal administra tion buildings including the law courts and chancellery (nos. 1 & 2), the Palazzo Cance lleria (no. 7) and the unfinished bridge across the Tiber (no. 5) (from Le Palais Farnèse vol. 11981).\n\nAlessandro lived in the palace and in m ani ways improved the old building, but from about 1508 he acquired more and more houses and sites nearby so that by 1515 he possessed an area that corresponded roughly to that of the later, still existing, palace. Between 1517 and 1523 he bought the area now taken up by the square in front of the main façade. In the longer run, the Via Giulia, which the main storey of the palace was presumably originally intended to overlook, only had a slight influence on the grand new building project that started in 1517 (Fig. 29). By now, Antonio da Sanga llo had been appointed the family's chief architect in charge of the construction of an entirely new and imposing palace: In 1517 a start was made on demolishing the old buildings on the site, also includińg parts of the original bishop's palace, and a start was made' on laying the föundations of the new building. Sanga llo must already at this time have been well advanced with his plans, as emerges from a contract for large deliveries of timber and beams the sizes and numbers of which are very precisely noted in the contract.

Frommel has meticulously charted, but it can be said that a large number of drawings and sketches for it in Sangallo's own hand have been preserved. By 1519 building had progressed so far that after a visit to it Pope Leo X spoke of the palace as pulchrum et sumptuosum. Although the palace was by no means finished, it nevertheless acted as the cardinal's residence from 1519. A drawing from 1525 shows how far building had progressed at this time (Fig. 31) . The intention from the beginning was that Sangallo's majestic, fourwinged, three-storey building should be enormous. The dimensions of the façade alone exceed all earlier cardinals' palaces and were only exceeded by the Pope's own Vatican Palace. With its strict observance of axes and the simple ornaments and decorations on the enormous surface of the façade, the building really was the residence of power and prestige. In the courtyard (cortile), where Sangallo only finished the first and part of the second storey, the classical style of the building can be seen with the loggias in the Doric, Ionic and Corinthian orders. The actual main entrance with Doric columns and the splendid barrel-vaulted cassette ceiling (Fig. 32) is entirely the work of Sangallo and a splendid copy of the vaults in the surviving ancient monuments in Rome. We shall return later to the building, which was continued by Michelangelo and Vignola and finally completed by G. della Porta in the 1580s. For the building came to a halt on account_ of the Sack of Rome in 1527. It and its furniture did not, however, suffer any damage under the sacking because Pierluigi Farnese, who had arrived at the same time as the imperial mercenaries, was able to defend the palace against incursions and plundering. It was moreover from that time that the malicious Pasquinade was. erected on the square, in which passers-by were encouraged to provide alms per la Fabbrica dei Farnesi.\n\nVI. THE FARNESS FAMILY IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS. PAUL III, THE PAPAL STATES AND NEPOTISM (1534-58) When Clement VI Ι died on 24 September 1534, Cardinal Alessandro was a serious candidate for the papacy, as emerges from the brief conclave at the beginning of October and his election on 13 October. There were simply no competitors to Alessandro, whom the rest of the Electoral College — in view of his considerable age (67) — presumably saw as a transitional pope. The new Pope took the name of Paul III. The people of Rome felt it as a release that — after over 100 years with a non-Roman pope — they now at last had one of their own on the Chair of St Peter. The event was celebrated in countless public festivities to which we shall return later, but it is questionable whether there was much to celebrate, as the general situation with regard to the Church, religion, and domestic and foreign politics was probably more difficult than ever before. Clement VIII's policy, which had aimed at procuring France as an ally had fundamentally been a catastrophe and led direct to the Sack of Rome in 1527; and at the same time the triumphant progress of the German Lutherans on the one hand and the Turks on the other had put pressure on the Catholic partners, divided as they were. By 1530, the Emperor Charles V had also taken control of most of Italy, with direct rule in Naples and Milan and indirect in Florence, Genoa and Mantua. ,\n\nCHURCH REFORMS AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICS\n\nThe most serious problem facing Paul III (Fig. 33) as the supreme ecclesiastical authority was the fact that the Emperor was insisting on summoning a general European (Church) council. Such a council was to solve the conflicts relating to the governance and organisation of the Church and at the same time it was to decide on its attitude to the vehement Lutheran criticism of the Church's beliefs and teachings. Paul III had himself earlier expressed a willingness to reform, but the very demand for a reform of the governance and structure of the Church brought up the uncomfortable old question of the power of the Pope in relation to the very competence of the council. In addition to the role of the Pope as the Supreme Pastor for the by now somewhat divided faithful, he had also, as the temporal ruler of the Papal States, the problem of being squeezed between France and the ever more dominant Habsburg Empire. In addition to this there was the constantly growing danger of Turkish attacks on the Italian peninsula itself. In the Papal States, with their many divergent constituents, there was dissatisfaction, unrest, even signs of revolt, and finally, as head of his family, Paul III had: an ardent desire to make his nephews great\". The problems concerning the council, the internal and external difficulties of the Papal States and the Pope's private family interests were intermingled for the next 15 years in a process that is extremely complicated and contra...\n\n48\n\nFig. 33.

With regard to the necessary Church reforms, Paul III quickly set up' a committee of reform minded prelates, several of whom, including Reginald Pole, Gianluigi Caraffa, Gasparo Contarini and Tommaso Badía, were either soon to receive or had already received the cardinal's hat. This very competent commission broughtωut an extremely critical report on the present condition of the Church (Concilium de emendanda Ecclesiae, 1537), warmly recommended the calling of a large-scale European council to clarify' relations with the still young Lutheran Protestant movement. Both. the commission and the appointment of the cardinals clearly signalled the new Pope's will íngness to introduce reforms. But he hesitated for a long time ín calling the general European council. The firm Catholic faith of his opponent, Emperor Charles V did.not, however, prevent him from resorting to brutal power politics (e.g. The Sack of Rome). His exertion of pressure to have the council convened was related to his desire, with the help of the council's decisions, to achieve the purely pó= lítical pacification of the now religiously divided Holy. Roman Empire. At the same time, it was not his intention to renounce his own leading position of political power, including Habsburg dominance of Italy. The Emperor's arch rival,. King Francis I of France was a power factor whom Paul III was obliged to take into consideration. On several occasions, Francis I aired the idea of a schism with Rome, i.e. the formation of a national French Church, towards which a move had been made on several earlier , occasions. So Paul III sought to walk a tightrope between these two great powers, declaring his own neutrality regarding their temporal disagreements. On the other hand, when it came to a more distant monarch, Henry VIII of England, he gave him short shrift and excommunicated him in 1538 (see Fig. 138). Paul IΠ told Cardinal\n\n49\n\nSeripando semi-officially that he had three main concerns in his pontificate: the re-establishment of general European peace, the calling of a council, and the struggle against the heretics. This, of course, sounded noble and plausible, but in fact it did not encompass all problems and made no reference at all to his policy regarding his own family. THE PAPAL STATES\n\nDuring his early years, the Pope concentrated on the political problems relating to the Papal States themselves. Here we see Paul III continuing the centralising policies of Julius II and Leo Χ and increasing the influence of the papal Curia on the individual regions of the Papal States with a view to ensuring domestic peace, income from taxation and loyalty to Rome. By 1534 the centralising policies of the previous popes had led to there being only two actual major signore regimes in the Papal States, í.e. the duchies of Urbino and Camerino. In 1535, when a marriage between the two ducal families (de ll a Rovere and Varano) threatened to combine the two into a large duchy, Paul III used military force to ensure that Camerino returned to the direct rule of the Church. There were also problems with Perugia and Parma and also with the Colonna family at Paliano south of Rome. The Papal States' urgent need for finances — as northern Europe gradually broke with Rome — meant that taxes and duties in the Papal States had to be increased (a salt tax, 10% duty on Church benefices, the introduction of a fireplace tax etc.), and these extensive new tax burdens led to violent protests, indeed to actual rebellions. The Colonnas at Paliano were put in their place by military means, and their lands were incorporated under the Church, and Parma's refusal to pay taxes was brought to an end. However, the most dangerous of all, Perugia's open rebellion resulting from the salt tax, was put down by force and the city had a large penalty imposed on it (Fig. 34). All in all, it can be said that the threatening moves towards dissolution in the Papal States were overcome by papal centralism, and that in this field Paul III was actually very successful. NEPOTISM, THE COUNCIL AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICS\n\nHowever, this domestic policy was at the same time intimately related to the Pope's nepotistic family policy. Immediately on becoming Pope, Paul III had followed the nepotistic custom of the time and had his grandson Alessandro (b. 1520, son of Pierluigi) — after this called Alessandro the Younger — and Alessandro's cousin Guido Ascanio Sforza (the son of his daughter Constanza) created cardinals with the positions respectively of ViceChancellor and camerlengo. The Pope's son Pierluigi (Fig. 35) received various sinecures and was in 1537 appointed papal gonfaloniere and that same year the Pope appointed him hereditary duke of the newly established state of Castro in northern Lazio, just where the family had its estates. The little duchy was so to say carved out of the oldest part of the Papal States, the Patrimonium S. Petri. In 1540, the Pope's grandson Ottavio was made duke of\n\n50\n\nFig. 34. Representatives of. rebellious Perugia approaching the Pope in penitence. Note the noose around the necks of the envoys. Detail of fresco from.. e Anticamera del Concílio, Caprarola (photo: Biblioteca Hertzïana — Max -Planck -Institut fur Kunstgeschichte, Rome) :\n\nthe above-mentioned duchy οf Camerino in Umbria. The creation of the new dukes in no way conformed to the otherwise centralist policy and was met by strong protests in the Cóllege of Cardinals (Fig. 36). At the same time, both close and more distant members of the family were richly rewarded with permanent annual payments and incomes in addition to extraordinary gifts. Most important of all, the Curia treasury, the Dataria, was at the disposal especially of the two grandsons Ottavio and Orazio. It has been estimated that between 1534 and 1549 these two received altogether 375,000 scudi for their own use (Annexe II). In international politics, too, care was taken of family interests. As said above, the Pope applied a policy of neutrality towards the opposing Catholic powers, the Emperor and the King of France, and at a meeting in Nice in 1538 he made a great show of mediating between them. What actually happened was that, despite various attempts, Paul III never negotiated with both monarchs at the same time, but that the two finally met quite independently of the papal attempts at mediation. The result was simply that Charles V and Francis I agreed on an unstable truce. Sp there was no question of successful papal mediation, but Paul III nevertheless had himself celebrated as the person who had mediated the great European peace agreement, although in reality his contribution to it and the result it achieved were meagre and fragile. .\n\n,\n\nIn his family policy, Paul III also showed his neutrality or ambiguity in re-\n\n51\n\nFig. 35.

Cardinal Alessandro is seen on the left, and on the right of the Pope can be seen the other nephew, Cardinal Guido Ascanio Sforza, Cardinal C. Madruzzo and the historian and Farnese adviser Paolo Giovio (?). The boy behind Pierluigi is his son Ranuccio Farnese as a Knight of Malta.

At the same time he tried - though at first less successfully — to get his oldest grandchild, Vittoria, married imo the French royal family, then into the Savoyan ducal family and then the Portuguese royal family. The final result was that Vittoria married the Duke of Urbino, Guidobaldo de ll a Róve_e in 1547. As a token of gratitude for his success in settling the refractory Vitoria into a marriage, Paul III made Guidobaldi's 12-year-old brother a cardinal. That same year, meanwhile, he succeeded in getting his grandson Orazio, who had been placed in the French court since 1540, engaged to the illegitimate daughter of the. French king, Diane de Poitiers. Nor was ecclesiastical advancement for the family neglected in that the third grandson Ranuccio was made a cardinal in 1545 at the age of 15. This papal policy was entirely in keeping with the dynastic policies of Italian and general European rulers. The problem for Paul III was that his advanced age and fragility made it necessary to achieve quick results.
