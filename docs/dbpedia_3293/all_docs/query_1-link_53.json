Sacred painting : Museum. Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2010. (I Tatti Renaissance library, 44). Summary: Federico Borromeo, Cardinal-Archbishop of Milan (1564-1631), is well known as a leading Catholic reformer and as the founder of the Ambrosiana library, art collection, and academy in that city. Less known is the fact that the institution's art museum was the culmination of many decades of reflection on the aesthetic qualities and religious roles of art, Borromeo recorded his reflections in two treatises. De pictura sacra (Sacred Painting, 1624) laid out the rules that artists should follow when creating religious art. Borromeo touched on dozens of icono-graphical issues and in so doing drew on his deep knowledge not only of church fathers, councils, and scripture but also of classical art and literature. In Musaeum (1625) Borromeo showed a less doctrinaire and more personal side by walking the reader through the Ambrosiana and commenting on specific works in his collection. He offered some of the earliest and most important critiques to survive on works by artists such as Leonardo, Titian, and Jan Brueghel the Elder. This volume offers, for the first time, translations of the treatises directly into English as well as freshly edited Latin texts, an introduction, extensive notes, and an appendix on the Academy of Design that was established in conjunction with the museum. These treatises will be of great interest to students of the history of art, museums, and religion. The I Tatti Renaissance Library is the only series that makes available to a broad readership the major literary, historical, philosophical, and scientific works of the Italian Renaissance written in Latin, Each volume provides a reliable Latin text together with an accurate, readable English translation of facing pages, accompanied by an editor's introduction, notes on the text, brief bibliography, and index. Presenting current scholarship in an attractive and convenient format, The I Tatti Renaissance Library aims to make this essential literature accessible to students and scholars in a wide variety of disciplines as well as to general readers.--Jacket.\n\nBraaten, Carl E. ; Jenson, Robert W.

Summary: Draws on new archival research to examine Pope Pius XI's effort to reject Nazism, discussing how he enlisted the assistance of John La Farge, a virtually unknown American Jesuit, to craft a papal encyclical (Humani generis unitas, which was never promulgated) condemning Hitler's campaign against the Jews.\n\nGallagher, Charles R. Vatican secret diplomacy : Joseph P. Hurley and Pope Pius XII. New Haven : Yale University Press, ©2008. Summary: In the corridors of the Vatican on the eve of World War II, American Catholic priest Joseph Patrick Hurley found himself in the midst of secret diplomatic dealings and intense debate. Hurley's deeply felt American patriotism and fixed ideas about confronting Nazism directly led to a mighty clash with Pope Pius XII. It was 1939,the earliest days of Pius's papacy, and controversy within the Vatican over policy toward Nazi Germany was already heated. This groundbreaking book is both a biography of Joseph Hurley, the first American to achieve the rank of nuncio, or Vatican ambassador, and an insider's view of the alleged silence of the pope on the Holocaust and Nazism. Drawing on Hurley's unpublished archives, the book documents critical debates in Pope Pius's Vatican, secret U.S. Vatican dealings, the influence of Detroit's flamboyant antisemitic priest Charles E. Coughlin, and the controversial case of Croatia's Cardinal Stepinac. The book also sheds light on the powerful connections between religion and politics in the twentieth century.--Book Jacket.\n\nGrillmeir, S.J., Aloys. Christ In Christian Tradition.

The burning of the vanities : Savonarola and the Borgia Pope. Stroud : Sutton, 2006. Summary: In the 1490s, Girolamo Savonarola, a visionary friar, dominated Renaissance Florence, terrifying the city with his uncannily accurate prophecies. Best remembered for his 'burning of the vanities' - the destruction of 'profane art' in public bonfires - Savonarola has often been caricatured as a hell-fire fanatic. Yet Victorian England saw him as an Italian Martin Luther, while his career inspired George Eliot's novel, Romola. Acclaimed author Desmond Seward casts new light on this controversial and contradictory figure. Savonarola prophesied the French invasion of Italy with alarming precision, and foretold the deaths of Lorenzo the Magnificent and Pope Innocent VIII. Yet there was more to him than prophecies of doom. He restored republican government to Florence and many of its citizens - including Michelangelo and Machiavelli - remained convinced that no better Italian government had ever existed. Savonarola's undoing was his denunciation and attempt to depose of the Borgia Alexander VI, one of the most corrupt popes in history. Had he succeeded, the Reformation might have been avoided. But in the end Alexander turned the Florentines against Savonarola and destroyed him. They stormed his friary and, after a mockery of a trial during which he was tortured by the strappado and condemned as a heretic, he was hanged and burned in chains. In this wide-ranging biography Desmond Seward portrays Savonarola as a surprisingly human figure. Exploring Savonarola's early years in Ferrara, his birthplace, Seward highlights the fact that an outsider had such an impact on Florence. He draws on Philippe de Commine's memoirs to analyse Savonarola's attitude towards the French invaders, examines Savonarola's eerie ability to see into the future, and looks at what really perished in the 'burning of the vanities'. Dramatic, colourful and compelling, The Burning of the Vanities brings to life an extraordinary man whose story is one of the great Renaissance tragedies.--Jacket.\n\nSladen, Douglas Brook Wheelton; Bourne, Francis.

This man Bernardin. Chicago : Loyola Press, ©1996. Summary: This Man Bernardin is the visual diary of one of our nation's foremost religious leaders - Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, the Archbishop of Chicago. The 180 striking black-and-white photos featured in this book capture the essence of the man who is Bernardin. Journey with the Cardinal from his Depression-era childhood in South Carolina to his present position as spiritual leader of the second-largest Catholic diocese in America - serving over 2.3 million parishioners. Given unprecedented access to the Cardinal's daily life, Pulitzer-Prize-winning photojournalist John H. White takes you beyond the normal barriers and into the private life of a very public man. Bernardin's own words - collected from pastoral letters, homilies, personal interviews, and other writings - have been chosen to frame White's stunning duotone photographs. White and Bernardin first met in New York City in 1979, when White was assigned to cover Pope John Paul II's visit to the United States. A special friendship grew between White, an African-American photojournalist and son of a Protestant minister, and Bernardin, then the Archbishop of Cincinnati and son of Italian immigrants. With Bernardin's trust, White has been able to observe and record the life of an American cardinal as no other photographer before him.--Jacket.\n\nWiseman, Nicholas.
