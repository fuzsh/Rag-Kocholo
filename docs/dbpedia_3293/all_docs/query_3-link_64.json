        "text": "Palatine Hill is one of the seven hills of Rome and the most ancient part of the capital. Based on Roman mythology and archaeological evidence, this hill is considered the birthplace of the city – a place where legendary Romulus founded it in 753 BC. Furthermore, the very word “palace” – indicating the emperor’s residence (“Palatium”), much as that of other dignitaries and prominent individuals – has its origin in the name of the Palatine Hill, known in Italian as Palatino.\n\nThe name itself originates from the deity Pales, which was adored in the early Roman civilization, and celebrated during the Feast of Parilia, held on the 21st of April, which is traditionally considered the day of the city’s foundation.\n\nLater on, the known world would witness the rise of a kingdom, then a powerful republic, and, finally, the greatest empire of ancient times. Over the centuries, Palatine Hill became a symbol of power and prestige, with many Roman emperors and aristocrats choosing to settle here.\n\nThe most notable imperial residence on the hill is the Palace of Domitian, also known as the Domus Flavia. Other luxurious properties of yesteryear nearby include the House of Augustus and the House of Livia.\n\nNowadays, visitors can explore the extensive archaeological ruins on the hill providing insights into the grandeur and opulence of ancient Rome. The remains of palaces, gardens, courtyards, and various structures showcase the architectural and artistic skills of the Romans. Sadly, after the empire declined, looting and neglect that lasted up until the Renaissance period left a strong mark on the area.\n\nPalatine Hill is also home to the Farnese Gardens (Orti Farnesiani) created during the Renaissance – one of the earliest botanical gardens in Europe. The panoramic views of the Roman Forum and the Colosseum opening from there, make the gardens a popular spot for visitors.\n\n\"On the Hill of Palatine, where history breathes, whispers of the past caress the stones, and the spirit of Rome forever gleams.\" Visiting the remains of what was once the most monumental residential complex of antiquity allows you to immerse in the space where legends were born and empires rose – \"a cradle of glory and tales untold, forever etched in Rome's golden mold.\" For a closer look at the walls, columns, and sometimes surprisingly well-preserved after more than two thousand years artwork, take this self-guided walk."
