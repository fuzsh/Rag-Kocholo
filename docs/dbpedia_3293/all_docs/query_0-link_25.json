Ca. 1420 , Bere Regis or Milborne St. Andrew, Dorset, England.\n\nEducation. He studied under the Benedictines of Cerne Abbey; and at Balliol College, Oxford University, where he obtained a doctorate in civil law, 1452.\n\nEarly life. In his younger days he was a distinguished ecclesiastical lawyer and practiced in the Court of Archesan. He was an ardent supporter of the Lancasters. Cardinal Thomas Bourchier, archbishop of Canterbury, was his kind patron.\n\nPriesthood. Ordained (no further information found). Pastoral ministry in the dioceses of Salisbury, Huntington and Leicester; prebendary of Salisbury and Lincoln. In 1453, he was appointed principal of Peckswater Inn (now Christ Church), Oxford. He was made a prebendary of Salisbury, and also of Lincoln, in 1455, the year in which the Wars of the Roses started. Named sub-dean of Lincoln on May 9, 1458, but he did not occupy the post. He was archdeacon of Norwich from 1461 to 1462; and 1472 to 1477. King Henry VI named him privy councillor, and chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. He took part in the battle of Towton and fled the consequent massacre; he was one of the two hundred who followed Queen Margaret of Anjou and her son by King Henry VI, Prince Edward, in her passage to Flanders in 1462. There he busied himself in sending such support as he could to the royalists at home. Morton accompanied the expedition of the earl of Warwick to England in 1470. The Yorkists fled and the Lancastrians occupied London, which was never favorable to the king. Their success was brief, for King Edward IV landed, seized London, and Morton had to flee towards the coast. He took the queen to safety at the Abbey of Cerne and later to the Monastery of Beaulieu. King Edward IV had an act of attainder passed against him. When the war ended at the Battle of Tewkesbury, which took place on May 4, 1471; Morton recognized that his future was hopeless and no longer defensible; he submitted to the Yorkists. King Edward IV granted his request for pardon, had the attainder against him reversed, and showed appreciation of his integrity by favoring his interests. The lawyer became a prebend of St. Paul's, in 1472, and a year later was made Master of the Rolls. Archdeacon of Chester from May 1474; of Winchester from March 1475; of Berkshire from November 1476; and of Norfolk from 1477.\n\nIn 1474 he went on an embassy to the king Hungary and the emperor to form a coalition of powers to attack King Louis XI of France; the plan failed and the English king considered a different policy; he had Morton accompany him to Calais, where they, together with Archbishop Thomas Bourchier of Canterbury, negotiated the Treaty of Pecquigny in 1475; by the treaty, the French king agreed to pay King Edward an annual tribute in recognition of him as overlord. Three years later, on August 8, 1478, King Edward asked the cathedral chapter of Ely to postulate the archdeacon of Norfolk bishop.\n\nEpiscopate. Elected bishop of Ely, October 30, 1478. Consecrated, January 31, 1479, Lambeth, by Cardinal Thomas Bourchier, archbishop of Canterbury; he walked barefooted and fasting from his residence at Downham to Ely to be installed on August 29, 1480. During the protectorate of Richard, duke of Gloucester, he was imprisoned by Richard first in the Tower of London and then in Brecknock Castle; the duke received a Petition from Oxford in favor of Bishop Morton but refused to relent his enmity; the bishop escaped to Ely and from there to Flanders and vigorously assisted the Lancastrians; the bishop helped plot the unsuccessful uprising led by Henry Stafford, duke of Buckingham in October 1483. An attainder was passed against the bishop by the duke of Gloucester, who was reigning as King Richard III. The exiled bishop renewed association with the dowager queen, Margaret, and opened communications with friends at King Richard III's court. From them he learnt of the duke of Brittany's plot to seize Henry, earl of Richmond, and hand him over to the English king. By a message from Bishop Morton, the earl of Richmond avoided the danger and found refuge at the court of King Charles VIII of France. When the duke invaded Wales and, as a Tudor, received strong support, Earl Henry moved on into England, and destroyed King Richard III's forces at Bosworth Field, on August 22, 1485. Earl Henry established himself as King Henry VII, reversed the attainder against Bishop Morton and summoned him in 1485 back to the realm; he became one of the most trusted and influential royal advisers as a member of the Privy Council and chancellor of the duchy of Cornwall. Promoted to the metropolitan and primatial see of Canterbury on October 8, 1486; he occupied the see until his death. He gathered a council at St. Paul's church, London, in 1486, to regulate the discipline and customs of the clergy. Young Thomas More was a page in Archbishop Morton's court and later mentioned the prelate in his \"Utopia\". The archbishop's visitations to the Southern dioceses produced a thorough reformation of the secular and religious clergy to the great benefit of the church. Resigned the post of Master of the Rolls. Lord Chancellor of England on March 6, 1487 (2).\n\nCardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of September 20, 1493; received the red hat and the title of S. Anastasia, September 23, 1493. He was in Rome and attended the consistory of May 11, 1495 in which he was named legate to accompany King Charles VIII of France in his travel through the Papal States; later, when Pope Alexander VI sought refuge in Orivieto on May 27th, he was left in Rome as legate in the absence of the pope; in that capacity, he received King Charles VIII on June 1st and placed the Vatican at his disposition but the king preferred to lodge in the Borgo. He returned to England in that same year, 1495, and was named chancellor of Oxford University. In 1496, he participated in the preparation of the commercial treaty \"Intercursus Magnus\" between Flanders and England, which was very important. He was an ardent patron of literature; Thomas More, future chancellor and martyr, was a page in the cardinal's household from 1491; the archbishop sent Thomas to study at Oxford; later, he paid tribute to memory of his patron mentioning him in his Utopia (3). The cardinal was a skilled engineer and architect, constantly repairing or building churches and residences; the twelve-mile drain of Fen country, diocese of Ely, was largely due to his enterprise and planning and thus its name \"Morton's Dyke\". At Glastonbury he helped Prior Goldstone II, O.S.B., with the completion of the cathedral's central tower; in Oxford, he repaired the school of theology and rebuilt the church of St. Mary; he also built a residence for himself at Knole, where he died.\n\nDeath. September 15 (4), 1500, of a quartan ague, Knole, near Sevenoaks, Kent. He bequeathed generous amounts to Cambridge and Oxford. Buried in the crypt of the metropolitan cathedral of Canterbury in the shrine of the Blessed Lady, in the monument he had built; in the middle of the 18th century, his remains were exhumed and dispersed and his tomb mutilated. His skull and skeleton were given by the archbishop of Canterbury to some of his relatives.\n\nBibliography. Baxter, Dudley. England's cardinals.

In brief, he is said to have applied the fiscal policy of the king by saying that people who paid heavy taxes were obviously wealthy and could be asked for more, whereas those who pleaded inability to pay were manifestly concealing their treasure. Like Henry VI's 'madness', it is another example of a plausible invention being copied by writer after writer.\n\nThe fact is that Archbishop Morton took a firmer grip on the King's policy than on its victims. He prevented the King from unconstitutional taxation by a system under which people were asked to pay Benevolences or gifts towards the treasury. These gifts were, of course, enforced but enabled Morton both to prevent the king's uncontrolled taxation and to lessen the severity with which he would have applied it. To the income so raised, Morton added the fines which he imposed on the clergy whom, in his Visitations in southern dioceses, he found as disordered in their clerical lives as were the laity through the aftermath of civil war. A thorough reformation of secular and religious clergy was effected to great benefit to the Church and some assistance to the Exchequer.\"\n\n(3) Heseltine, The English cardinals, p. 83-84, indicates that More's Utopia, it may be read of \"that reverend prelate John Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal, and Chancellor of England; a man (for Mr. More knows well what he was) that was not less venerable for his wisdom and virtues, than for the high character that he bore; he was of a middle stature, not broken with age; his looks begot reverence rather than fear; his conversation was easy, but serious and grave; he took pleasure sometimes to try the force of those that came as suitors to him upon business, by speaking sharply, though decently to them, and by that he discovered their spirk and presence of mind; with which he was much delighted, when it did not grow up to an impudence, as bearing a great resemblance to his own temper; and he looked on such persons as the fittest men for affairs. He spoke both gracefully and weightily; he was eminently skilled in the law, and had a vast understanding and a prodigious memory; and those excellent talents with which nature had furnished him were improved by study and experience. When I was in England, the king depended much on his counsel, and the government seemed to be chiefly supported by him; for from his youth up, he had been all along practised in affairs; and having passed through many traverses of fortune, he had acquired to his great cost a vast stock of wisdom; which is not soon lost, when it is purchased so dear.\" And, according to Quinlan, Our English cardinals, including the English pope, p. 42, \"Morton is one of the few real life people who talk with Hythlodaye in More's Utopia. It is possible that the Latin 'History of Richard III' attributed to More was written by Morton, and that More was responsible for its English translation.\"\n\n(4) This is according to most of the sources consulted, printed and electronic, except his second biography in English, linked above; and Quinlan, Our English cardinals, including the English pope, p. 42, which say that he died on October 12, 1500.\n\n(12) 11.
