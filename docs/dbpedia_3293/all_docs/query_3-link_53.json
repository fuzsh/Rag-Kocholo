        "text": "The Lady of the Unicorn, Giulia Farnese and Bisentina Island by Manfredi Gioacchini is a photographic exhibition set up in the Church of Saints James and Christopher. The Church was originally built and dedicated to Saint John the Baptist by Ranuccio Farnese the Elder, who intended it to be a mausoleum for his family on the island. It was Cardinal Alessandro Farnese the Younger who constructed the imposing monument we see today over this preexisting building: the Church of Saints James and Christopher. The construction began in 1588 based on the design of Giovanno Antonio Garzoni from Viggi√π and was completed during the time of Odoardo Farnese between 1602-1603.\n\nIn agreement with the Superintendency, the church has undergone a non-invasive restoration, working to restore the original structure while allowing the marks of time to remain visible. The only existing tombstone is that of Ranuccio, which has also been restored to enable proper reading. Other family members buried in the church include the young Cardinal Ranuccio Farnese, brother of Alessandro, Pierluigi Farnese, and Gerolama Orsini. There is no certainty about Giulia Farnese. However, it is known that the noblewoman expressed a desire to be buried on the island in a detailed will that is still preserved at the State Archives in Naples. A faithful copy of the will is on display inside the church for the 2024 season."
