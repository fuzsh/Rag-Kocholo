        "text": "Summary\n\nThis bronze statuette represents Hercules resting. He stands, naked, his left foot forwards, leaning on a trunk draped with the lion's skin under his left arm, his left hand touching his club.\n\nImitated from an antique statuette of the type of the Farnese Hercules.\n\nThe antique Farnese Hercules is one of the most famous ancient sculptures which dates from the 3rd century AD. It came into the collection of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1520-1589), the granson of Pope Paul III, who was a great patron of the arts and assembled one of the biggest collections of ancient sculpture. The statue was displayed for generations in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome.\n\nThe Farnese statue was moved to Naples in 1787 and is now displayed in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale.\n\nHercules (Greek name is Heracles) is one of the most important heroes in Greek mythology and represents the characteristics of masculinity, strength, courage and sexual prowess.\n\nHe was the son of Jupiter and Alcmena, a Theban princess. He is regarded as the embodiment of physical strength and courage.\n\nHis two main attributes are the club and the lionâs skin, which he won at his first labour. He had to undertake 12 labours as a penance for slaying his own children in an act of madness."
