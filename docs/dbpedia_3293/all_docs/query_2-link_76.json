        "meta_description": "The Farnese dukes dominated the province of Parma, north Italy, from the period 1548 to 1731. An important characteristic of their rule was their receptiveness to petitions and supplications from their subjects. Petitions from subjects of varying social positions to absolutist rulers provide a wealth of information pertaining to the relationships between dukes or princes and the populations they ruled. This article argues that the subjects of the Farnese duchy of Parma relied on the relationships of channels of communication provided by a well-entrenched system of petitions and appeals as a way to relieve themselves of the obligation to resolve quarrels and social conflicts through violence. Importantly, malefactors also seem to have calculated their crimes in accordance with the likelihood of receiving a ducal pardon, tending to threaten rather than wound, or insult rather than attack. The system of petitioning was operated by the Council of Sentencing (Consiglio della Dettatura), a tribunal that developed as an integral part of the Farnese judiciary system. By the waning of the Farnese dynasty, petitioning allowed a broad swath of Farnese subjects to protect their own interests while submitting to the authority of the ducal regime.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Scene of the Crime: The Judiciary of Parma in the Seventeenth Century\n\n14Regardless of their input into the system, Farnese dukes did not review or involve themselves in the majority of their subjects’ petitions. They were content for most petitions to be treated on a day-to-day basis by their high magistrates. However, they promulgated decrees (gride) that modified the terms and function of the Dettatura, and these decrees are indicative of the attitudes with which they viewed petitioning and its relationship to their authority. The success and failure rates of ordinary petitions, and those petitions that bore ducal scrutiny, show how petitions encouraged subjects to work within the Farnese judiciary. This system allowed Parmans to express their social needs while at the same time constraining their behaviour, or the behaviour of their social adversaries.\n\nPetitions, Violence and Personal Rule\n\nYear\n\nCR\n\nP\n\nF\n\nC\n\nTR\n\nDR\n\nTotal\n\n1631\n\n78\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n76\n\n0\n\n156\n\n1637\n\n198\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n197\n\n0\n\n403\n\n1644\n\n12\n\n13\n\n57\n\n0\n\n2\n\n13\n\n97\n\n1659\n\n3\n\n8\n\n25\n\n4\n\n4\n\n16\n\n60\n\n1687-9\n\n96\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n355\n\n4\n\n456\n\n1727\n\n7\n\n21\n\n136\n\n102\n\n0\n\n10\n\n276\n\nTotal\n\n394\n\n48\n\n222\n\n107\n\n634\n\n43\n\n1448\n\n19As Table 1 demonstrates, the petitions from the early seventeenth century refer primarily to criminal matters, with a scattering of civil misdemeanours and financial issues throughout the bundles. This is partly due to the impact of the Thirty Years War, as well as the lasting trauma of recurrent plague cycles. Thus, in both 1631 and 1637, petitions requesting judicial pardon accounted for close to 50 percent of petitions (78/156 and 198/403 respectively), indicating that subjects, particularly the soldiers who were numerous in the city in this decade, tended to shoot or rob first, and ask for pardon later. Petitions from later in the century were more varied in subject matter, and those which concerned violent criminality are much reduced by 1687-1689, when they accounted for less than 25 percent (96/456) of the serie’s total. Thus, a decline in the proportion of petitions presented to the duke requesting reprieve from the penalties of crime and violence may indicate two things. The first is that interpersonal violence in Parma declined over the period. This article cannot prove this decline statistically ; however, it is in line with much of the evidence for a European decline in violence. The second is that violent resolution of interpersonal conflicts gave way to appeal to judicial forces, and the growing number of petitions requesting ducal protection from enemies supports this notion. These types of petitions accounted for 1.2 percent of petitions in 1631 (2/156), more than 10 percent in 1659 (8/60) and 7 percent in 1727 (21/276).\n\n21The familiarity of subjects with the necessary formulae for successful petitions indicates that appealing to the Dettatura was a regular aspect of the early modern Parmans’ daily encounter with state authority. The broad range of issues they petitioned and the prominence of particular social groups, such as militiamen, show that Parmans strategised their petitions and may have refrained from submitting a supplica until they considered their chances of success to be most favourable. Further, certain petitions provide very suggestive evidence for an active turn by Parman subjects to state authority in avoidance of personal conflict and violence. The ways in which the Farnese dukes, particularly Ranuccio II, treated these exceptional petitions illustrate the conception of princely rule that motivated their interference with the judicial system, and link the pacified behaviour of Parman subjects to the strengthening of the personal ruler through visible and functional communicative mechanisms.\n\n22A sample will make clear the material analysis of petitions below. The following is the petition of Antonia Mussona, who in 1644 was brought in front of the Criminal Judges (Auditori Criminali) for her involvement in a quarrel with unknown enemies. She addressed herself to the Dettatura as below :\n\n45 « L’Antonia Mussona humil.ma serva et oratrice delle ss.ie VVMme gli espone qualmente viene molesta (...)\n\nAntonia Mussona, humble servant and petitioner of your Supreme Illustrious Magistrates, reminds you how she has been molested by the Criminal Office of Parma that wants to punish her for a fight, and make one of her sons pay her fine. But the petitioner being poor, having nothing else from which to live, because her husband consumed all she had and not having any more, it was necessary to go into service to support herself, this way being deprived of two daughters, they having gone to the service of the Serene Prince in Candia. Now the poor petitioner genuflects at the feet of your Supreme Illustrious Magistrates, humbly supplicating that they would consider giving her grace by ordering that the petitioner should no longer be molested for this quarrel, and also that whatever there is about her in the criminal books be overturned, for all this the petitioner hopes to obtain from your Supreme Illustrious Magistrates. Quam Deus .\n\n23The communicative strategies employed by Parmans in their petitions are a good starting point to illustrate the active engagement of Farnese subjects in the program of suppliche e rescritti. Petitions all begin with obsequious praise for the benignity of the duke or his officers. This honorific address, clearly stipulated by notarial prudence, took a variety of forms that stressed those ducal qualities that petitioners wished to invoke. Thus, some petitions stress the “most serene” nature of the duke, while others emphasise his royal highness, and others still focus on his “immense clemency and goodness” (immensa clemenza e benignità). The notary likely chose the most fitting obsequy for the petitioner’s tale, and then copied the story into the petition. This technique served to establish the abject position of the petitioner, kneeling in tears at the duke’s feet for mercy.\n\n25The subjects of the Farnese were familiar with the option of presenting a case to a supreme governmental body, and recognised the benefits they could gain by taking this option. Two series of petitions will demonstrate how this relates to the decline of violence. The first concerns petitions that focus on violent crime, or crime-related violence, committed by the petitioner : simple assaults, robberies, brawls and fights that involve weapons. Significantly, this series shows that over the century Parmans, particularly soldiers, developed a preference for firearms display, rather than ritualistic knife fighting as seen elsewhere in Europe. The second series contains petitions that precluded acts of violence, and requested protection from the petitioner’s rivals or enemies. Parmans now employed the legal system to their advantage. As noted by the Rituale, the fine for a fight in which blood was spilled, for instance by a skilful knife-fighter’s attack on his opponent’s cheek, was significantly higher than unlicensed possession or display of a firearm. Thus, in their daily conflicts, Parmans may have considered the costs and benefits of potential violence, specifically their ability to avoid significant punishment by appealing to the Dettatura, and chosen more symbolic means of displaying and acting out status competitions and other disputes in the early modern city.\n\n34The above petitions all concerned acts of violence committed by the petitioner, one of the two broad categories that concerned violence, and which attracted the personal attention of the duke. Broadly speaking, Farnese dukes, in particular Ranuccio II and his son Francesco (1694-1727), took an active interest in petitions that bore on their authority in relation to other regional princes and in those that potentially threatened the paternal relationship between themselves and their subjects.The latter category is most interesting, for it demonstrates how the Farnese regime provided for Parmans an alternative to violence. Subjects themselves responded to the opportunity for governmental intervention by referring conflicts with violent potential, or those with violent beginnings, to the duke and his ministers. This second category of petitions, concerning acts or threats of violence committed by the petitioner’s rivals, also received the duke’s personal attention.\n\n66 ASPR, Uditore Criminale, Lettere Ducali ad Uditore Criminale, bb33, letter of 24 September 1695.\n\nobserve this attached memorial, from a certain Barbara Preti, who says she is treated barbarously by her husband Basilio Grassi. This woman long served the Most Serene Princess Maria Maddalena […] call this Basilio, and make him understand that if he does not change his ways, we will change them for him, along with other corrections from my hand .\n\n38Barbara herself feared “to lose both her body and soul” at the hands of her husband, and evidently could not count on the moral indignation of the local youth to protect her from her husband’s abuse. She relied on the only recourse she had : direct appeal to the duke, who fortunately bore her a particular good will based on her long connection to his own family.\n\n39This petition, and the Duke’s reply, makes clear that Parmans participated willingly in the system of petition and appeal, effectively integrating their lives with the structures of local and ducal authority, such that even the marital household was subject to the intrusions and behavioural modifications of ducal justice. Further, the petitions served to create or to emphasize the personal connection between ruler and ruled for which the Farnese strove : both Barbara and Francesco referred to the former’s personal service to the Farnese family, Barbara to influence the duke’s decision, and Francesco to indicate the personal importance that he attached to Barbara’s problems.\n\nConclusion\n\n40Alessandro Mariano’s petition becomes clearer in this light. Mariano was aware of the high cost of justice. If he were blamed for this homicide, he faced steep fines, imprisonment or possible death. He therefore undertook to defend his innocence in this matter by offering to return to Parma and cooperate with the criminal judges. However, Mariano was clearly not totally innocent, or perhaps he had enemies within the judicial system. Therefore his participation in the judicial system was qualified : he would give himself up to the authorities, but he requested immunity from the law in all matters other than the homicide in question. This sense of negotiation captures very well the dynamic of petitioning : In order to function, the petitioning system had to offer real solutions to the problems of both government and population. Before they would give up their use of violence, Parmans needed an effective alternative to protect their interests and safety.\n\n41Petitions provided an unrivalled opportunity for the Farnese princes to assume non-violent authority over the widely dispersed, traditionally feudal, villages and hamlets that comprised much of their territory. In Parma, this was surely aided by the relatively small size of the Duchy and its population, and the model presented here likely applies best to small-scale states such as those of northern Italy where such communication could function efficiently. The Farnese dukes did not hesitate to meddle in the business of their magistracies, and they consistently drew the power of the Dettatura closer to their individual purview. In constructing this magistracy, the Farnese dukes ensured that requests for mercy were directed immediately to the top of the hierarchy. This personal identification of mercy with ducal persona was both patriarchal, creating a metaphorical kin network in which subjects could appeal to their padrone to intervene in their disputes, and functional, allowing for a consistent presence of higher authority in the interactions between government and subject. At the same time, subjects’ submission to this authority was not the product of that authority in and of itself ; rather, subjects responded to the opportunity for ducal intervention in their quarrels, making any ‘civilizing process’ in Parma very much a cooperative affair between subjects and ruler.\n\n43The role of petitions across Europe as a tool used both by rulers, to inform themselves of and act upon the affairs of their subjects, and by those subjects, to find avenues for dispute resolution that precluded the necessities of violence and censured certain degrees of social behaviour, deserve further investigation in full-scale. This article has shown that in Farnese Parma, the control of violence cannot be seen as the result of one side or another’s victory in the battle for social control. Rather, as the state attempted to expand its real control over the hearts and purses of subjects, individuals pursued those options which were, or seemed, most useful. Here the two perspectives on the decline of violence can come together. The evolution of legal systems provided the opportunity for the displacement of violence and personal conflict to abstract systems of threat and coercion. This is seen vividly in the preference of Parman soldiers for firearms display rather than gun violence ; in both the interactions that predicated a judicial process and in the judicial process themselves, violence was diverted from physical action to theatrical posturing. People retained the mental structures that encouraged competition and aggression, but the institutional structure in which these emotions were played out promoted the channelling of this competition into non-violent arenas, such as displays of status, and the resolution of conflict in the tribunal system."
