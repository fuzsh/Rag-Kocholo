Ottavio Farnese (* 1524), son of Pier Luigi and grandson of Pope Paul III, married Margarete of Parma, the daughter of Charles V in 1538. Finally, in 1552, the Emperor handed over the duchy to his son-in-law Ottavio Farnese, who regained his possession, but now as an imperial fief. King Philip II of Spain confirmed Ottavio's possession in 1556, but Piacenza remained a Spanish military base until 1585.\n\nOttavios and Margarete's son Alessandro fought at Lepanto in 1571, became governor of the Spanish Netherlands in 1578, and followed his father in Parma and Piacenza in 1586.\n\nTestone 1553, Parma.

Apollon won with a trick: He could play on an upturned lyre, a feat Marsyas with his flute could oppose nothing comparable. Apollo tied the Satyr to a pine tree and pulled him from the skin. The satyr's blood or the tears of his many friends among the forest deities formed the river Marsyas."
