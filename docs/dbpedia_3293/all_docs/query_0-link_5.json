Romae : Typis Vaticanis, 1630), II cols. 741-742 and 746-747, Antipope Benedict XIII created Pseudocardinals Orlando Vulpelli; Roberto Joanis; Pierre de Foix (created by Antipope John XXIII in 1414); Jordan (confused with Pseudocardinal Carlos Jordán de Urriés y Pérez Salanova); Antonio Venerez; Cristóbal or Rodolfo Amerio; Raimundo Cescales; Juan Virinus; Arnaud Laurentius; Bartolomeo Celfor; and Bernard de Rieba.

Moreover, Pius Bonifatius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae catholicae ( 3 v. in 1. Graz : Akademische Druck- u.

He had made his four pseudocardinals promise that they would elect a successor after his death. Three of them met in conclave and elected Gil Sánchez Muñoz, provost of Valencia and archpriest of Teruel, Spain, who took the name Clement VIII. One of the pseudocardinals, Jean Carrier, was in Armagnac, France, and arrived after the election had taken place. Antipope Clement VIII abdicated on July 26, 1429 and died on December 28, 1445.

Pietro in Vincoli, who was absent from the election of Antipope Clement VIII, decided, after consulting theologians and canonists, that the election was invalid because \"it was done by liars, thieves and excommunicated persons\" and declared that he alone had the right to fill the Holy See. Carrier gathered a notary and several witnesses in Armagnac, France, and on November 12, 1425, designated pope Bernard Garnier, a sacristan of Rodez, France, and consecrated him. He took the name Benedict XIV. As antipope, he conducted his office so secretly that even his residence was uncertain, and he thus became known as the \"hidden pope.\" In a letter from the count of Armagnac to St. Joan of Arc, it was revealed that only pseudo Cardinal Carrier knew the antipope's location. Benedict, having few followers, ended his reign in 1430, after having named four pseudocardinals. Benedict XIV is not listed in the official list of popes and antipopes of the Annuario Pontificio published by the Vatican. He appears in a footnote to Benedict XIII in the 2007 edition, p. 17*, n. 30. He is also known as the hidden pope.\n\n-Jean Farald (1).\n\n(1) No information has been found about his life.
