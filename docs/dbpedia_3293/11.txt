Farnese Family

BACKGROUND

Rise to Prominence in 15th Century

By the 15th century, the Farnese family, who owned land in Lazio (region northwest of Rome), had achieved local prominence in as condottieri and civic officials. Early in the century, Ranuccio Farnese (d. c.1450) was appointed a senator by and was made a standard bearer by . Papal land grants enlarged Farnese territory.

Ranuccio's son Pier Luigi married an aristocrat, and their son Alessandro had a highly successful career in the Church that catapulted the Farnese family to a new level of wealth and prominence.

Alessandro's Advancement in the Church

In 1493, Alessandro became a by the appointment of , whose mistresses included Because of his sister's presumed influence in his elevation, Cardinal Farnese was nicknamed the "petticoat cardinal."

Like many cardinals, Alessandro had a mistress and children. He obtained declarations of legitimacy from ruling popes for several of his children. Because of his increasing dedication to Church matters, Alessandro gave up his mistress in 1513

Through ability, dedication, and his good relations with the reigning popes, Alessandro achieved importance and influence as well as great wealth from having been granted many ecclesiastic offices, including 16 bishoprics.

Alessandro was also able to increase the family territory by obtaining papal land grants for his service.

Collections of Antiquities and Paintings

After the Farnese family died out in the 18th century, the Farnese collections of antiquities and paintings passed to Don Carlos of Spain, who moved them to Naples. They are currently in archaeological and fine arts museums there.

POPE PAUL III 1468-1549

Background

Alessandro was elected in 1534. During his 15-year pontificate, the longest in the Renaissance, he did a great deal to secure his family's fortunes by naming his to and titles.

Conferring Cardinalates

Paul immediately conferred the rank of cardinal on his two oldest grandsons, 16-year-old Giudo Ascanio Sforza, the son of his daughter Costanza and Bosio , and Alessandro Farnese (1520-89), the 14-year-old son of his son Pier Luigi.

Later, when his grandson Ranuccio was old enough, he was also made a cardinal. His cardinal grandsons were also benefited with lucrative papal offices.

Conferring Titles of Nobility

Like several papal predecessors, Paul ceded papal territory to his surviving son, Pier Luigi, and after his death by assassination, to his grandsons Ottavio and Orazio, making them the dukes of and Castro (later destroyed).

Paul's claims of territory for his son and grandsons and his conferring the rank of on several family members brought him into conflict with .

Arranging Prestigious Marriages

Paul also arranged prestigious marriages for his grandsons.

●Ottavio marries Margaret of Austria/Parma. while only a boy of 14, was married in 1538 to the 16-year-old widow of Margaret of Austria (1522-86), the illegitimate daughter of . She inherited much property including the whose name refers to her. She is now known as Margaret of Parma in reference to Ottavio being the Duke of Parma.

●Orazio marries Diane of Valois. In 1553 Orazio was married to Diane of Valois, an illegitimate daughter of the French king, Henry II (ruled 1547-59). Â

Private Patronage

The most important of Pope Paul's non-official architectural commissions were two domestic projects that he began for his sons when he was still a cardinal: the Palazzo Farnese and the fortress at Caprarola that would become the Villa Farnese.

♦Palazzo Farnese, Rome, 1517-89. In 1517, Cardinal Farnese commissioned to design the The original scheme provided two separate apartments with individual entrances and staircases for his sons. Construction ceased in 1527 after the and was not begun again until 1541, when he gave it to his surviving son, Pier Luigi. After Pier Luigi's assassination in 1547, the palace passed to the pope's grandson Ranuccio, and after his death, to Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, who finished it. The scope of the palace was enlarged in keeping with the family's new stature as a papal family after Alessandro's election as pope in 1534. The faÃ§ade became the short side, and the only parts that were were the vestibule, three vaults of the courtyard loggia, and two rooms on the right front section of the palace. Antonio da Sangallo determined the the design of the and the of tan brick with on the He completed including the and the ground-story and of the courtyard. Antonio died before the cornice and rear wing had been begun. Antonio's successor changed the design of the to one that was far larger. He also made theÂ more emphatic by enlarging the window over the portal and surmounting the door-and-window ensemble with a whose scale was large enough to crown the entire entrance. Michelangelo changed Antonio's courtyard design as well by and using on the upper stories. After making these design changes, in 1550 Michelangelo left the palace's construction to Â

♦Fortress phase of Villa Farnese, Caprarola, 1515. Early in his career, while he was still a cardinal, Alessandro commissioned Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and Baldassare Peruzzi to design a for his son Pier Luigi at a family property at Caprarola. later turned the fortress into the for Paul's grandson Alessandro. In converting Antonio's fortress, Vignola left the moat dry and used the platform roofs of Antonio's as terraces.

Vatican Patronage

Paul commissioned many important works at the during his papal years.

♦Sala Regia, 1538-1449. The pope commissioned the restructuring and redecoration of the a formal reception hall that is to the Sistine Chapel. Construction took place between 1538 and around 1540. Perino del Vaga executed the coffering of the barrel-vaulted ceiling. The walls were painted after Paul's pontificate, and it is not known what he had planned. Â

♦ Pauline Chapel, 1542-50. Paul commissioned to build the Pauline Chapel, which was decorated by by Perino del Vaga and frescoes by Federico Zuccaro. He commissioned to decorate the side walls with scenes illustrating the and the Saul is better known as the Christian Paul, for whom the chapel is named, although the name is popularly though to refer to its patron Pope Paul.

♦Apartments in Castel Sant'Angelo. Paul III commissioned the decoration of a suite of apartments in the where his predecessor had taken refuge during the . Perino del Vaga painted the walls with fictive architecture and decorated the ceilings with gilded stucco coffering.Â

♦ St. Peter's, 1534-49. Paul commissioned Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and to continue work on according to Antonio'sÂ with an expanded . After Antonio's death in 1546, Paul brought Michelangelo to the project. The building committee would not agree to Michelangelo's changes, which involved much of Antonio's work, until pressured by Paul himself, who paid Michelangelo's salary from papal funds.

♦Michelangelo's Last Judgment, Sistine Chapel, 1536-41. Paul's predecessor, had commissioned Michelangelo to paint the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel. Clement died before the work was begun, and Paul recommissioned it. Although the subject of the work commissioned by Clement was a âResurrection,â it is unclear whether this meant a Resurrection of Christ or a Resurrection of the Dead (i.e. a ). Therefore it also remains an open question as to whether the subject represents a change to the original commission. As it exists today, Michelangelo's forms a thematic conclusion to his earlier ceiling painting of the Creation of the Universe and the early history of mankind.

♦ Titian's Portraits, 1545.Â In 1546, while was staying in Rome as Pope Paul's guest, he was commissioned to paint several portraits of the family including a portrait of that repeated the pose of He also left an unfinished dynastic portrait, Pope Paul III and His Grandsons Alessandro and Ottavio (illustrated on right), which recalls of Leo X with his cousins.

Civic Commissions

Pope Paul repaired much of the destruction incurred during the before the 1536 visit of , emperor of the .

♦ Michelangelo's Piazza del Campidoglio, Rome. In 1538, Paul turned his attention to the the ancient seat of the cityâs civic government. He began the by clearing the area around the two pre-existing structures, the Palazzo del Senatorio and the Palazzo dei Conservatori. The pope commissioned Michelangelo to move the ancient Roman statue of to the site and design a for the Palazzo del Senatorio.

CARDINAL ALESSANDRO FARNESE

Alessandro's Position and Wealth

As the eldest son of Pier Luigi Farnese, would normally have inherited his father's estate, and his brother Runuccio would have entered the Church. But because the pope was 71 when elected, he was apprehensive about how long he would have to advance the careers of his grandsons in the Church.

Consequently, Alessandro was made a cardinal at the age of fourteen and named a vice-chancellor, a lifetime appointment, at the age of fifteen. With the income from these and other positions endowed by his uncle over the 15 years of his pontificate, the younger Alessandro became one of the richest men in Italy. He put much of his wealth into building and decorating palaces, villas, gardens, and a major Roman church.

Painting Commissions

♦Vasari's Sala dei Cento Giorni, Palazzo della Cancelleria, Rome. As vice chancellor, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese lived in the the official residence of that office, and commissioned the redecoration of many of its rooms. The best known of these is the Sala dei Cento Giorni, which was named for the hundred-day span in 1546 that spent painting it. The frescoes depict scenes from the life of Paul III, his papal uncle. One of the scenes commemorates Paul's patronage by illustrating the rebuilding of St. Peter's. Â

♦ Titian's Portrait of Cardinal Farnese, 1545.Â When Titian was in Rome as Paul III's guest, Alessandro commissioned him to paint his

♦ Titian's DanaÃ«, 1545.Â Cardinal Farnese also commissioned Titian to paint a voluptuous reclining nude representing DanaÃ«, the beautiful princess that the Roman god Jupiter visited in the guise of a shower of gold. She was given the facial features of the cardinal's own mistress.

Architectural Commissions and Acquisitions

Cardinal Farnese continued the construction of many Farnese family commissions that had been begun by his grandfather, and he acquired additional property as well.

♦Purchase of Farnesina, Rome. After first renting its Cardinal Farnese purchased the Villa Chigi, renamed the from the family. The villa was located from the Palazzo Farnese, and Michelangelo proposed a bridge linking the two properties.

♦Completion of the Palazzo Farnese, Rome, 1565-79. Cardinal Alessandro Farnese completed the which had been begun by his grandfather for his father and uncle. After their premature deaths, the palace passed to Alessandro's brother Ranuccio, who died in 1565. At that time, Michelangelo's changes to Antonio da Sangallo the Younger's original design had been implemented and construction of the was underway by , who died and was replaced by . For theÂ Michelangelo designed loggias that opened all the way through to the courtyard on all three stories, which would have made it possible to see the gardens from the front wing's courtyard facing. Cardinal Farnese decided to fill in the arches and build a reception room on the second story. (The ceiling of the resulting room was later decorated by Annibale Carracci with paintings illustrating the Loves of the Gods.) The view to the gardens through the rear wing's top story was also blocked by being The Palazzo Farnese represented an ideal arrangement of building and site in being a freestanding structure surrounded by an ample from which the entirety of the building could be appreciated. Its design was one of the major in the course of palace design in sixteenth-century Italy.

♦Villa Farnese, Caprarola, begun 1559. In 1559, Alessandro commissioned to design the which rose from the pentagonal fortress begun for the first Cardinal Farnese. A beside the vestibule leads to the A on the piano nobile of the front wing, contains a at one end. The were added after Vignola's death. The gardens adjacent to the building include a pair of square that parallel the two rear wings. A park-like part of the grounds extends behind them and leads to another formal garden. Known as the Giardino Grande this garden features a series of fountains that lead to a small casino. Giacomo del Duca is usually credited with building its fountains in the 1580s, and Girolamo Rainaldi is thought to have designed the around the casino in the 1620s. Â

♦ Orti Farnesiani, Rome, begun c. 1570. Alessandro commissioned Vignola to design the a terraced garden on the which overlooks the ruins of the

♦Il GesÃ¹, Rome, begun 1568. Alessandro agreed to fund if certain conditions were met: he would be the sole patron, and within the general design that had been agreed upon between the Jesuits and himself, he would have the right to select the architect and specific features of the design. Il GesÃ¹, which was part of a in Rome, was the home church of the . The church's main body, designed by , is like Alberti's in having chapels instead of aisles along the sides and in using a barrel-vaulted ceiling over the nave. Il GesÃ¹ also has short that make its overall shape, in a plan, rectangular.
