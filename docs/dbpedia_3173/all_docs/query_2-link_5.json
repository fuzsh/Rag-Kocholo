        "text": "Thunderbolt and Lightfoot is a 1974 crime film about a bank robber and his irreverent young sidekick who get his old gang back together to organize a daring new heist.\n\nDirected and written by Michael Cimino.\n\nThunderbolt... the man with the reputation. Lightfoot... the kid who's about to make one! (taglines)\n\nThunderbolt\n\n[edit]\n\nI don't wish to be forward, but we'd like to exchange cars with you. So the faster you get out, the better it'll be for your ass.\n\nYou ain't no country preacher, Preacher.\n\n[to a woman riding a motorcycle in shorts] Hey where did you get those pants? [the womans pulls out a hammer, pounds his truck and rides off] You freak! I love you, come back!\n\nRed Leary\n\n[edit]\n\nGo... fuck... a duck.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nMelody: I didn't get your name.\n\nLightfoot: Well, I didn't give it to ya'. My name is Lightfoot.\n\nMelody: \"Lightfoot\"?\n\nLightfoot: That's right.\n\nMelody: That's a dumb name. I mean, what kind of person would name a kid that, ya' know?\n\nLightfoot: What's your name?\n\nMelody: Melody.\n\nLightfoot: \"Melody\"? That's not a dumb name?... Hey, maybe we had the same father?\n\nThunderbolt: What's your name, boy?\n\nLightfoot: Lightfoot.\n\nThunderbolt: You Indian?\n\nLightfoot: Nope. Just American.\n\nRed: Does he know everything?\n\n[at the same time]\n\nThunderbolt: No.\n\nLightfoot: Yes.\n\nLightfoot: Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. That sounds like somethin'.\n\nThunderbolt: You're forgetting I'm a lot older than you.\n\nLightfoot: There are plenty of guys twice my age who don't know their ass from a hole in the ground.\n\nThunderbolt: I won't fault you there.\n\n[a woman runs out of a motel crying rape]\n\nWoman in car: You really want to stay here?\n\nHusband: [smiling] Why not?\n\n[Lightfoot shows up with the van, newly dented by the girl on the motorcycle]\n\nRed Leary: Where'd you get the dents?\n\nLightfoot: Progress. I dreamt about you last night.\n\nRed Leary: What about?\n\nLightfoot: I dreamt you said hello to me.\n\nRed Leary: Don't you get smart with me. I'll break both your arms.\n\nLightfoot: I'll keep that in mind.\n\nRed Leary: Remember what I said. John and me go back a long way. But you don't mean nothin' to me, understand? Nothin'!\n\nLightfoot: What'd you try and kill him for then?\n\nRed Leary: Because we were friends.\n\nLightfoot: [John Doherty, aka Thunderbolt, dressed in preacher's garb, has jumped into Lightfoot's stolen Trans-Am] I thought you were the heat.\n\nJohn: Do I look like heat?\n\nLightfoot: You look like one crazy son-of-a-bitch for a preacher, I'll tell you that.\n\nLightfoot: Howdy. How's business?\n\nStation Attendant: In this business, you're always one step away from bankruptcy. Funny money, credit, speculation... Somewhere in this country's a little old lady with $79.25. The $0.05 is a buffalo nickel... If she crashes in her investment, whole thing'll collapse. General Motors, the Pentagon, the two-party system and the whole and the whole shebang... We're all running downhill. Got to keep running faster or we'll fall down.\n\nThunderbolt: In small-town banks, they leave the telephone off the hook in the vault at night so the local operator can listen in.\n\nLightfoot: People walk into these banks with paper sacks, fill 'em with money and walk out. Anybody can do it.\n\nThunderbolt: Bullshit. The newest bank vaults have walls of reinforced concrete five feet thick, backed by six inches of steel. The vault door is stainless steel-faced. It's an inch and a half of cast steel, another 12 inches of burn-resisting steel, and another inch and a half of open-hearthed steel... A vault door has 20 bolts, each an inch in diameter. Eight on each side, two top and two bottom. This holds the door into a 16-inch steel jamb set in 18 inches of concrete. It's crosshatched by steel bars running both vertical and horizontal. This door is precision-made so you can't pour nitro between the door and the vault. If that isn't enough, there's microphones, electric eyes, pressure-sensitive mats, vibration detectors, tear gas, and even thermostats that detect the slightest rise in temperature. Still interested in banks?\n\nLightfoot: I knew you weren't a preacher!\n\nLightfoot: You know... you know somethin'? I don't think of us as criminals, you know? I feel we accomplished something. A good job. I feel proud of myself, man. I feel like a hero.\n\nThunderbolt: Are you all right, kid? You don't look too well.\n\nLightfoot: I believe you're right.\n\n[Slumps over]\n\nThunderbolt: Lightfoot!\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nThunderbolt... the man with the reputation. Lightfoot... the kid who's about to make one!\n\nHe has exactly seven minutes to get rich quick!\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nClint Eastwood - John \"Thunderbolt\" Doherty\n\nJeff Bridges - Lightfoot\n\nGeorge Kennedy - Red Leary\n\nGeoffrey Lewis - Eddie Goody\n\nGary Busey - Curly\n\nCatherine Bach as Melody\n\nJack Dodson - Bank Manager\n\nGregory Walcott - Car Salesman\n\nVic Tayback - Construction Company Owner\n\nBill McKinney - Crazed Car Driver w/raccoon and rabbits\n\nBurton Gilliam - Welder\n\nBeth Howland - Bank Manager's Wife\n\nDub Taylor - Gas Station Attendant\n\nClaudia Lennear - Secretary\n\nJune Fairchild - Gloria\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nThunderbolt and Lightfoot quotes at the Internet Movie Database\n\nThunderbolt and Lightfoot at Rotten Tomatoes"
