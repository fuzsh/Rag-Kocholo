A complete list of new releases is at nytimes.com/intheaters.\n\nRatings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.\n\n‘BAD MOMS’ (R, 1:41) Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and a wonderful Kathryn Hahn head up a funny, mostly female cast in a giddy, sentimental laugh-in about (not remotely) bad moms from Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who wrote “The Hangover.” (Manohla Dargis)\n\n‘BAZODEE’ (PG-13 1:41) “Bazodee” is Trinidadian slang for being disoriented or dizzy, possibly because of romance. And you might go bazodee over the contagious soca beat set by the singer and heartthrob Machel Montano in this fluffy, candy-colored romance directed by Todd Kessler. (Helen T. Verongos)\n\n★ ‘THE BEATLES: EIGHT DAYS A WEEK’ (No rating, 1:39) Sure, you’ve seen endless clips of the Beatles in the early years, the Fab Four being cheeky, the fans screaming their lungs out. But this documentary by Ron Howard will make you smile at Beatlemania all over again, despite being a bit hagiographic. The focus is on those wild, wonderful years when the band was playing live concerts and riding the fame monster with aplomb. That the group not only survived the hysteria but also went on to make even better music in its studio period is worth savoring all over again. (Neil Genzlinger)\n\n‘BLAIR WITCH’ (R, 1:29) There is really no reason to go back into those woods. (A. O. Scott)\n\n‘BRIDGET JONES’S BABY’ (R, 2:02) Renée Zellweger, crinkly-eyed and adorable at 47, plays a more poised and confident Bridget, still chasing what she calls “happily ever after” in this mildly amusing romantic comedy. But the question nags: What planet does she think she inhabits? The fantasy world shown in the movie, in which she has to choose between two Prince Charmings, either of whom could have impregnated her, might as well be Planet C, as in cute.
