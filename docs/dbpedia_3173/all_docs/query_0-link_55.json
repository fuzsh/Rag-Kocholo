I think not.\n\nLife inspires art, and vice versa.\n\nThese movies are stitched together from the tattered fabric of their time: fallout from the assassinations of RFK and MLK in ’68, the slow crawl out of an unwinnable war, the violent social upheaval of a country unwilling or unable to come to terms with its savage racial history used to build out the American Dream, plus recorded confirmation that the Leader of the Free World might be more insecure and small-minded than the ringleader of a middle-school lunch table.\n\nI could mention how a lot of this should sound familiar, but that level of symbolism might appear as over-the-top as Martin Scorsese’s rat at the end of The Departed, a film which garnered the director his first Oscar, 30+ years into a Hall of Fame career that blasted off during the decade discussed here.\n\nAll of these films came out before I was born.\n\nEach of them, received reasonably well at the time of their release, share similar threads beyond proximity of release date.\n\nI watched all of these films for the first time ever over the past seven days.\n\nDeep in summer’s dog days when you’re sweating as soon as you walk outside, plodding thru the corporate drudgery with an uninspiring list of entertainment lineup filled with five-hour baseball games, summer programming re-runs, poisonous cable-news, and vapid social media tail-wagging-the-dog debates, what better way to spend a few air-condition hours in a fulfilling way than bunker down with some old (but new to you) stuff?\n\nMillennials, or to a lesser degree Gen-Z-ers, proudly proclaiming their ignorance or lack of interest in all things that happened before their arrival, take note.\n\nI’m far from perfect, but even as a hot teenage mess, I’d never confess to my birth certificate being a valid excuse for not knowing Jimi Hendrix.\n\nAnd it’s a lot easier when the chief research tool is in your pocket, rather than needing to cobble together information from disparate sources, such as the cool older kids in the neighborhood, record-store clerks, FM radio, monthly music magazines, MTV, and library micro-fiche.\n\nThose who don’t know history, are doomed to repeat it.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I detest the 2010’s trend of Baby-Boomer-blame-shifting any societal ill onto Millennial Boogeymen.\n\nAs a member of the oddly muted generation between, the last to experience life before and after the Digital Age, greatly out-numbered on both sides and occupying a less defined cultural place, take these words of well-worn wisdom with love, like you would from a cool older cousin turned slightly washed sage.\n\nFor best results, don’t be afraid to do a little digging in order to locate your own Golden Age.\n\nXOXO,\n\nBambino\n\nNow On With The Show…\n\nThe “Soaking In The Seventies” Episode of The Five Spot Categories:\n\nLegendary Lead Performing Antihero Deeds: The seventies was the decade American film studios caught up to the revolutions that had already taken place in other realms of American art (literature and music, especially) or in the film scenes of other countries (50’s-60’s French New Wave, specifically).\n\nThe films were a reflection of the times in which they were created, while the anti-hero was more often the protagonist, or at least the character around whom the film revolves.\n\nSweeping Americana-Soaked Scenery: Roads that seem to go on forever, state trooper cars, gas stations, local crowds, and commercial lots that look like today’s equivalent of highway exit strip malls, as far as the eye can see.\n\nGrand Allusions to the Boulevard of Broken American Dreams: The movie films in a real-life early-release center outside of Sugar Land, Texas. As the chase continues, the co-conspirators and their kidnapped cop realize they have more in common than they thought, with equally little control of their own destiny.\n\nWarnings We Didn’t Heed, Still Seen in 2019: This chase feels like a precursor to the OJ White Bronco slow-roll along The 10 West in Los Angeles, which along with the subsequent trial was arguably the birth of '“reality television”.\n\nThis depiction of two bumbling “kids” risking it all on a widely broadcast stage, becoming heroes and enemies to their fellow citizens who never met them, is the 1969 Texas equivalent of a viral video.\n\nMeanwhile, Lou Jean Poplin’s giving one of her fans a beauty-supply order to fulfill when they stop at a gas station, then posing for Polaroids, while complaining about the photo of herself that the local newspaper chose to run on the front page, all feels prophetically Kardashian-esque.\n\nSymbolic Rat Claptrap: While on the run, Lou Jean and Clovis watch a Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner cartoon movie playing at a nearby drive-in without being able to hear the sound. At first, Clovis has a good time making his wife laugh by providing the cartoon sounds himself. Then, in a rare moment of clarity for a lunkhead led into real trouble by his impulsive wife, it finally seems to register to Clovis that the anvil might soon be falling on his head.\n\nSweepingly Americana-Soaked Scenery: Breathtaking depictions of a part of America most of us rarely see. Granted, this was the early seventies. Do Idaho and Montana still look like this, or did they move all the mountains, streams, trees, valleys, and lush greenery to put up a parking lot more recently?\n\nDuring my Summer 20SickDream cross-country drive from LA to Philly, Utah was the most beautiful state I saw. It was also deeply strange, the only place I got pulled over and ticketed, plus the only place where I was propositioned once let alone multiple times about joining a new religion. But that’s beside the point.\n\nOn a purely aesthetic level, it was more gorgeous than anywhere else I passed through, including Colorado next door, and the California I’d left.\n\nWatching this movie, it seems like the Big Sky country up in Idaho and Montana would have topped it, if I had headed north instead of east.\n\nGrand Allusions to the Boulevard of Broken American Dreams: The movie begins with bullets inside a roadside church, and ends at a one-room schoolhouse.\n\nThere’s also this pearl of wisdom from a gas station attendant while speaking to Lightfoot, not realizing he’s there to steal a car:\n\n”In this business, you're always one step away from bankruptcy. Funny money, credit, speculation... Somewhere in this country's a little ol' lady with $79.25. The five cents is a buffalo nickel... If she cashes in her investment, whole thing'll collapse. General Motors, the Pentagon, the two-party system and the whole shebang... We're all running downhill. Gotta' keep running faster or we'll fall down.”\n\nSymbolic Rat Claptrap: Nothing nearly as egregious as the movie above this one, but the planned community identical houses building up inside some of the most beautiful areas of the country functions as both a filler answer for this category and Warnings We Didn’t Heed, Still Seen in 2019.\n\nIngredients: Easy Rider, Bonnie and Clyde, Magnum Force\n\nAftertaste: Thief, The Deer Hunter\n\nSoundtrack Attack: Paul Williams’ “Where Do I Go From Here?” does this road movie justice.\n\nRandom Fun Facts: Eastwood was the originally planned director for the film, but having developed a trust in Cimino due to their prior collaborations, bequeaths the heavy-lifting to him, which set in motion the man behind the wheel of New Hollywood’s crash-landing at Heaven’s Gate.\n\nSeven Word Summation: Legendary duo goes on a wild ride.\n\nDate of Release: December 9, 1974\n\nLegendary Lead Performing Antihero Deeds: King of Marvin Gardens co-star Ellen Burstyn, fresh off wrapping The Exorcist. To call her an ‘antihero’ here would be a bit misleading, but in the midst of New Old Hollywood misogyny, a widowed housewife doing what she can to get by, taking her act on the road with a child in tow, plus keeping the company of a night owl (Harvey Keitel) with a secret, probably qualifies.\n\nBartles and Jaymes “Thank You For Your Support” Award: Kris Kristofferson’s seemingly effortless charm is perfect here, you root for him to win over Alice. Diane Ladd is also perfect here as Flo, despite viewers nowadays probably picturing the Flo in Mel’s Diner as Polly Holiday. Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore shares the distinction with MASH of being superior movies made by legendary auteurs, that became more well known for their TV sitcom adaptations.\n\nNate Dogg “Hold Up, Waaaaiiiit” Moment of Recognition: 11-year-old Jodie Foster, in her first film role, pre-Taxi Driver, as the bad-influence kid with minimal parental supervision, already appearing fully formed as the Jodie Foster we’d come to know.\n\n70’s Auteur Theory: This was Martin Scorsese’s first major hit movie. It bears little resemblance to the work he was starting to become known for on Mean Streets before, or almost any of the classics he made afterwards.\n\nIs it the best film on his resume? No. Is it his most underrated, and most singular? There’s a strong argument for yes, on both counts.\n\nDoomed Mission: Alice leaves New Mexico in her rear-view mirror shortly after her husband is killed in a work accident, aiming to get back to Monterey, California where she was raised, to resurrect a singing career that never really was, while also needing to support herself and her son.\n\nPotable Quotables:\n\nTommy: Mom, are we in Arizona yet?\n\nAlice: If you ask me that one more time, I'm gonna beat you to death. Just sit back there and relax and enjoy life, huh?\n\nTommy: Life is short.\n\nAlice: So are you.\n\nFlo: Mel, what you doing back there, pulling on your pudding? Or are you giving it a whack with a hammer? I heard the only way you can get it up is to slam it in a door.\n\nMel: I don't want to get too close to you, honey. It will get you all bothered up early in the morning.\n\nFlo: I could lay under you, eat fried chicken... and do a crossword puzzle at the same time. That's how much you bother me.\n\nAlice: Don't look back. You'll turn into a pillar of shit.\n\nTommy: The whole state is shit.\n\nAlice: Don't talk dirty, Tommy. How many times do I have to tell you?\n\nSweeping Americana-Soaked Scenery: We travel thru the Southwest with a Rand McNally atlas, riding shotgun like her son, with Alice. Scorsese’s depiction of the scenery is decidedly less romantic than the poetic beauty of Big Sky country portrayed by Cimino in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, with the notable exception of a flashback sequence at Alice’s childhood home in Monterey that looks like a movie from another time.\n\nGrand Allusions to the Boulevard of Broken American Dreams:\n\nSymbolic Rat Claptrap: The opening scene with Alice as a little girl paints her as a sassier Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz , while crooning like Judy Garland.\n\nWarnings We Didn’t Heed, Still Seen in 2019: Ya got me.\n\nIngredients: The Wizard of Oz, Meet Me In Saint Louis, Mean Streets.\n\nAftertaste: The TV sitcom Alice, Mermaids, The Age of Innocence.\n\nSoundtrack Attack: You can faintly here Dolly Parton’s original version of “I Will Always Love You” playing at the bar.\n\nT.Rex makes the cut with “Jeepster” and Elton John with “Daniel”.\n\nBetween those three songs, that might make it Scorsese’s most ‘new music’, in terms of songs released contemporaneously to its making.\n\nOf course, he also has Kris Kristofferson singing a 1949 Hank Williams classic, “I’m So Lonesome, I Could Cry”, and features Ellen Burstyn performing standards like Rodgers and Hart’s “Where or When” as Alice, which while they’re “not Peggy Lee”, are still affecting.\n\nDate of Release: February 11, 1975\n\nLegendary Lead(s): Warren Beatty, as a Lothario a lot like…Warren Beatty. Or at the very least, his public playboy persona before Annette Bening.\n\nFurther inspiration for the film also came from Jay Sebring, otherwise known as the late-sixties hairdresser-to-the-stars, who was murdered alongside Sharon Tate by members of the Manson Family, who was known to bed his female clients and sell drugs to his male ones. But rather than focus on the murders, this film sets its backdrop against Election Day 1968, an event that by 1975 probably feels foreboding, but in terms of the characters’ mind-state, the election is just something on in the background, an excuse to get together for a cocktail dinner in Beverly Hills while the returns come in, and the drama in the room far eclipses any election concerns for all the main players.\n\nBartles and Jaymes “Thank You For Your Support” Award: This is the ideal version of Goldie Hawn for my money. This or Foul Play. She’s absolutely adorable as Jill, George’s slightly neurotic, too-trusting, somewhat naive, flighty aspiring actress, who is also the film’s only character resembling a good, non-cynical person. Whatever reasoning George is supposed to have for not wanting to be with her, is incomprehensible to me, but maybe that’s the point.\n\nIngredients: Manson, Nixon, The Women’s Lib Movement, Los Angeles, Bonnie and Clyde, Chinatown.\n\nAftertaste: Black Shampoo (the blaxploitation version of the film that came out the next year), Loverboy with Patrick “Extra Anchovies” Dempsey, and the song “Black Shampoo” on Wu-Tang Forever, a U-God solo cut that’s arguably the worst song on the entire double-album, unless you count Poppa Wu’s intro.\n\nSoundtrack Attack: Paul Simon does the score, but it doesn’t really stick to the ribs. The music that truly pops is the late-sixties rock played at the hippie party in the film’s late stages, Jimi Hendrix’s “Manic Depression” becomes a perfect crescendo for George’s exposure.\n\nRandom Fun Facts: Beatty and on-and-off-again girlfriend in real life, Julie Christie, broke up for good during this movie, supposedly due to Beatty’s need to get ‘into character’ with other co-stars, even making a move on the 18-year-old Carrie Fisher, who in a move indicating wisdom-far-beyond-her-years, rebuffed him.\n\nThe movie was originally called “Hair”, but the Broadway show Hair came out before the movie finished production, so to avoid confusion, it was changed.\n\nSeven Word Summation: Everyone’s Chasing Cheap Thrills in Beverly Hills."
