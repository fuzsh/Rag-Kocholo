It is one of the largest and most popular film industries in the world, producing more than 1,000 films per year. Bollywood films are known for their colorful costumes, lavish sets, catchy songs, and melodramatic plots. But how did Bollywood evolve from Indian cinema and musical theatre? In this section, we will explore the history of Bollywood and its influences from various sources. We will also look at some of the key features and genres of Bollywood films, and how they reflect the social and cultural changes in India. Here are some of the main points we will cover:\n\n1. The origins of Indian cinema and the first Bollywood film. Indian cinema began in the late 19th century, when the Lumi√®re brothers introduced the cinematograph in Bombay. The first Indian film was Raja Harishchandra (1913), a silent film based on a Hindu mythological story, directed by Dadasaheb Phalke. He is considered the father of Indian cinema. The first Bollywood film, or the first Hindi talkie, was Alam Ara (1931), directed by Ardeshir Irani. It was a musical drama that featured seven songs and became a huge hit.\n\n2. The influence of Parsi theatre and Hollywood on Bollywood. Parsi theatre was a form of musical theatre that emerged in the 19th century among the Parsi community, who were Zoroastrians from Persia. Parsi theatre combined elements of Indian folk theatre, classical theatre, and Western theatre, and used music, dance, and dialogue to tell stories. Many early Bollywood filmmakers and actors were influenced by Parsi theatre, and adopted its conventions of melodrama, comedy, romance, and social commentary. Hollywood also had a significant impact on Bollywood, especially in terms of technology, genres, and styles. Bollywood films borrowed from Hollywood genres such as musicals, westerns, thrillers, and horror, and incorporated elements such as stunts, special effects, and glamour.\n\n3. The golden age of Bollywood and the rise of the star system. The golden age of Bollywood is generally considered to be from the late 1940s to the 1960s, when some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful films were made. Some of the prominent directors of this era were Raj Kapoor, Guru Dutt, Mehboob Khan, Bimal Roy, and Satyajit Ray. They made films that dealt with realistic and social issues, such as poverty, class, gender, and nationalism, and used techniques such as montage, flashbacks, and symbolism. The golden age also saw the emergence of the star system, where actors became icons and had loyal fan bases. Some of the most popular stars of this era were Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand, Raj Kapoor, Nargis, Madhubala, and Waheeda Rehman. They often played romantic leads and had on-screen chemistry with their co-stars.\n\n4. The masala films and the angry young man. The masala films were a genre of Bollywood films that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, and were characterized by a mix of action, comedy, drama, romance, and music. They were aimed at entertaining the masses and appealing to a wide audience. The masala films often had formulaic plots, stereotypical characters, and escapist themes. Some of the most successful directors of this genre were Manmohan Desai, Prakash Mehra, and Ramesh Sippy. They made films that starred Amitabh Bachchan, who became the epitome of the angry young man, a character who represented the frustration and rebellion of the youth against the corruption and injustice of the society. Some of his iconic films were Zanjeer (1973), Deewaar (1975), and Sholay (1975).\n\n5. The parallel cinema and the new wave. The parallel cinema was a movement of alternative and independent films that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, and challenged the mainstream Bollywood films. The parallel cinema focused on realistic and artistic expression, and addressed issues such as politics, identity, sexuality, and violence. Some of the notable directors of this movement were Shyam Benegal, Govind Nihalani, Mrinal Sen, and Ketan Mehta. They made films that featured actors such as Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi, Om Puri, and Smita Patil, who gave nuanced and powerful performances. The new wave was a term used to describe the films that emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s, and experimented with new forms and themes. Some of the influential directors of this wave were Shekhar Kapur, Ram Gopal Varma, and Vishal Bhardwaj. They made films that explored genres such as sci-fi, gangster, and noir, and used techniques such as nonlinear narrative, handheld camera, and digital editing.\n\n6. The globalization and diversification of Bollywood. The globalization and diversification of Bollywood refers to the changes that occurred in the 1990s and 2000s, when Bollywood films became more popular and accessible to the international audience, and also more varied and innovative in terms of content and style. Some of the factors that contributed to this phenomenon were the liberalization of the Indian economy, the emergence of the multiplexes, the rise of the satellite television and the internet, and the increased collaboration with foreign studios and talent. Some of the directors who led this trend were Aditya Chopra, Karan Johar, Farhan Akhtar, and Ashutosh Gowariker. They made films that catered to the urban and diasporic audience, and incorporated elements such as romance, comedy, family, and patriotism. Some of the actors who became global stars were Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Kajol, and Aishwarya Rai. They often played characters who were modern and cosmopolitan, but also rooted in their culture and values.\n\n2.The genres, themes, styles, and stars of Bollywood films[Original Blog]\n\nBollywood is the name given to the Hindi-language film industry based in Mumbai, India.
