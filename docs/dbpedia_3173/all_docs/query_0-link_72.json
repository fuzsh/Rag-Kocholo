        "text": "THUNDEBROLT AND LIGHTFOOT MOVIE CAST\n\nStill from the 1974 film showing Bridges and Kennedy unpacking a cannon, signed by each in blue felt tip. The film earned Jeff Bridges his second career Oscar nomination\n\nPrinted photograph signed in ink: \"Jeff Bridges\", \"George Kennedy\", B/w 10¼x8. JEFF BRIDGES (b. 1949) is the son of actor Lloyd Bridges and younger brother of Beau. He earned Oscar nominations for his performances in The Last Picture Show (1971), Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974), Starman (1984) and The Contender (2000). His other films include The Fisher King (1991), The Big Lebowski (1993) and Seabiscuit (2003). In addition to his acting achievements, Bridges has also written some 200 songs, a talent that he memorably incorporated in The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989), in which he starred as Jack Baker. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his acting in Crazy Heart at the 82nd Academy Awards in 2010. GEORGE KENNEDY (1925-2016) has acted in over 170 movies and TV shows, including roles in Have Gun, Will Travel, Maverick and Rawhide as well as movies like The Dirty Dozen and an Oscar for his role as Dragline in Cool Hand Luke.
