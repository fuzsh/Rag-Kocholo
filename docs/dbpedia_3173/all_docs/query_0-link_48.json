        "text": "By David\n\nWhen Molly took a film course about the 1970′s she noted that I could probably teach it, and so here it is. It is strange when something I lived through becomes a subject for historical study, but, I guess, it all does. I was the right age and sensibility for the 70′s films, and movies then were as exciting to me as music was in the 60′s. The 70′s was a period when many of the longstanding ideas of the previous fifty years in literature, art and philosophy finally made it to the screen. These directors were schooled in the history of cinema, unafraid of big ideas, big emotions, radical technique, self consciousness and tragic endings.\n\nIn brief, of necessity simplified, here are The Themes:\n\nThe Outsider\n\nRoots and consequences of violence in American Society\n\nCorporate Capitalism destroys the soul of the individual; and its corollary: money and power corrupt\n\nCorruption and darkness in the heart of American society\n\nParanoia is justified\n\nDeath of the American Dream\n\nIndeterminacy of truth and moral relativism\n\nThe loss of Romantic Illusion\n\nConsciousness of the history of world cinema, and the reinvention of genre films: Cinema had achieved an intellectual heft by the 60’s, and was studied in universities both academically and technically and many of these directors were students or critics (akin to the French New Wave directors). These films played homage and just played with, the conventions of the gangster movie, film noir, the rom/com and screwball comedy, the police drama and the horror movie, sometimes twisting them in strange new ways frequently with abrupt tonal juxtapositions.\n\nAntecedents:\n\nThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: “I reckon I got to light out to the territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she’s going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can’t stand it. I been there before.”\n\nTosca: melodrama and murder\n\nHeart of Darkness: the venal, depraved heart at the center of civilization\n\nThe Searchers: John Ford’s Western about the complexities of the obsessive quest\n\nBreathless: the existential criminal\n\nThe Maltese Falcon: the more you learn the less you know\n\n70’s Films in the 60’s:\n\nBonnie and Clyde – sex and violence in the USA\n\nThe Graduate – alienation made funny. “Plastics!”\n\nEasy Rider “You do your own thing in your own time.”\n\nCool Hand Luke - It’s all about the attitude\n\nBlow Up: what is true?\n\nDr. Strangelove: the blackest of comedies: It’s the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine.\n\nFaces: Let’s not forget the artsy, wildly improvisational films of John Cassavetes who maintained an important presence through the 70′s.\n\nFilms to Study:\n\nFive Easy Pieces: 1970 Bob Rafelson’s enormously pleasurable rebel with or without a cause pix kicked off the 70′s and paradigmed Jack Nicholson’s sensitive, bad-ass persona, later codified in the slicker One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. In Rafelson’s film, Jack plays a man dangling between the dumb, raucous blue collar life he adopted and the sterile, moribund upper class world he abandoned. He is at home nowhere. With its confused politics, this film demeans both proletariats and elites. In general, you tended to watch the characters in 70′s films at a distance with a mixture of distaste and pity. These were antiheros, flawed and tragic. But I’m trying to think of a 70′s hero with which I identified more closely. At the time, Five Easy Pieces struck me profoundly and spoke to issues in my own life about where I fit in.\n\nThe French Connection: 1971 William Friedkin’s gritty, slamming, morally ambiguous police drama reinvented the genre. This is the movie that launched a thousand cop movies and tv shows. It was filmed on the filthy NYC streets with available light and film stock pushed to maximum grain. Its murky palate was punctuated by caustic yellows and dark bleeding reds. Gene Hackman’s sadistic protagonist, Popeye Doyle, vibrated with frustration and hatred. Dialogue was limited to two or three lines at a time. Best picture and actor Oscars. Friedkin went on the retool Horror with The Exorcist.\n\nMcCabe and Mrs. Miller: 1971 Robert Altman’s offhandedly poetic Western utilized indelible visuals and a ramshackle narrative which chronicles the creation of a new community in the Pacific Northwest. This creation of community serves as both a metaphor for film making and for the growth of America. The quietly tragic ending reads as both random and inevitable. My favorite movie hit me at just the right time. It enveloped me in the movie theater. Like the Godfather films, it’s the story of how corporate capitalism killed entrepreneurial individualism. Isn’t this the rage expressed in politics right now?\n\nThe Godfather (parts one 1972 and two 1974): Francis Ford Coppola’s towering, operatic, virtuoso work. Part 2 embellished and darkened the first, expanding the historical sweep to encompass the history of America in the 20th Century – those scenes of old New York are gorgeous. After viewing these films in a double feature, Molly noted that in a unique way these films create a visceral and complete world. You experience the sights, textures, smells, sounds, and even tastes. Remember that scene where Clemenza teaches how to make his pasta sauce? Even the minor characters are vibrant. Nobody has made a better film. It’s compulsively watchable, each scenes is spellbinding. Trivia question: what two actors won an Oscar playing the same role?\n\nBadlands: 1973 A stunningly, cold gem by Terrence Mallick about youth culture, violence, and the media prescient in its portrayal of the psychopath as media hero. What do we have now but the exemplar of presidential election as cult of celebrity? It’s based on Charles Starkweather’s mass killing spree through the Heartlands, accompanied by the teenage Caril Ann Fugate in 1950′s America. I can vividly recall two scenes from the movie of strange invention and odd amalgam of tones. After killing Caril Ann’s father, they set fire to his house, and it burns in exquisite miniaturized beauty as stylized electronic music plays. In the second, lit by the auto’s headlights, Charles and Caril slow dance on an empty prairie as Sam Cooke plays on the radio.\n\nChinatown: 1974 Roman Polanski’s nasty neo noir has a devastating emotional impact – I’m not quite sure how it was achieved. Three friends who know their stuff told me that Chinatown is their favorite 70’s movie. My sense of its power is in its depiction of a world falling apart, or, more accurately, a world that has already fallen apart, and, perhaps, has always been that way. As the film progresses, the cocky, cynical (but actually Romantic) hero, Gittes, discovers the Original Sin that pervades society, and his helplessness in its face. When Evelyn asks him what had happened in Chinatown, Jake says “I tried to keep somebody from being hurt; it turned out I made sure she was hurt.” Well acquainted with manifestations of evil, Holocaust survivor Polanski had his home invaded and his pregnant wife murdered by the Manson Family prior to making this film; following it he was convicted of drugging and raping a 13 year old.\n\nDog Day Afternoon: 1975 – A wild, messy movie with abrupt shifts in tempo and mood by that great actors’ director Sidney Lumet, whose emotionally intense films stretch from 1957’s classic 12 Angry Men to the savage, octogenarian work Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead in 2007. This one stars Al Pacino in an inept bank robbery on a hot August day in NYC, motivated by the need to pay for his boyfriend’s sex change operation. At this point Pacino was demonstrating his versatility – The Godfather films, Serpico and this. These four movies are his career legacy.\n\nShampoo 1975 directed by Hal Ashby: In the guise of a fluffy sex farce, Shampoo is a supremely entertaining film about the cost of hedonism and the death of the 60’s. It takes place on the eve of Richard Nixon’s 1968 election win, and the seven years between that event and the film’s release establishes a historical distance which frames the events: it is the past. (In a subtle bit of historical accuracy, Warren Beatty opens a can of beer with a church key.) The film is elevated by the autobiographical echoes of Warren Beatty’s character, the always sublime Julie Christie, and the subtly comic Jack Warden. Goldie Hawn, Lee Grant and a young Carrie Fisher round out the women juggled by Beatty’s character. This is a small, underrated masterpiece.\n\nTaxi Driver: 1976 – a garish violent nightmare about NYC, and, hence, America, directed by Martin Scorsese, that pushes every edge you have.\n\nCarrie: 1976 – Brian De Palma’s baroque high school horror show recycled all sorts of movie trash into pure, self-conscious movie joy, depicting the outsider’s revenge in its gory glory.\n\nAnnie Hall: 1977 Woody Allen’s genius was in autobiographical comic observation rather than in the meta-insights that dominated his work since. He lost the scattershot approach of his wonderful earlier films (Take the Money and Run, Bananas, Sleeper) to make this serious and sad comedy about true love in modern America (of course, for Woody Allen, New York is America) and position himself along with the great mainstream comic artists – Charlie Chaplin, Groucho Marx and Bob Hope. Nobody knew this at the time, but Woody would never surpass Annie Hall, he wouldn’t even come close, and hackneyed/low rent contemporary Clint Eastwood would come to be known as the greater artist. Last month a friend bravely admitted that at the time she had gone all in on the Annie Hall Look, hat and tie included.\n\nAn underappreciated, correlative figure to Allen in the 70′s is Paul Mazursky, another Brooklyn born Jewish director of comedy. Bob, Carol, Ted and Alice (pictured above), Blume in Love, Next Stop Greenwich Village, Harry and Tonto, and, most notably, An Unmarried Woman were witty, sometimes gentle, sometimes lacerating glimpses of contemporary urban upper middle class life. He dissected the dynamic of self-involved characters struggling between an urge for freedom and a need for love. He made his greatest film in 1989: Enemies, a Love Story.\n\nThe Ugly Guys Club:\n\nDreamboat actors of the 50′s and 60′s (William Holden, Gregory Peck, Tony Curtis, Peter O’Toole, Paul Newman) were replaced by average guy types frequently with an ethnic bent. These were the stars:\n\nDustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman, Robert Duval, Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Elliot Gould, George Segal, Roy Scheider, Richard Benjamin, Woody Allen, Richard Dreyfus. Even the handsome Brando of the 50’s became the ugly Brando of the 70’s.\n\nLanky, baby faced, somewhat wooly, wise-ass son of old Hollywood, Jeff Bridges established a new kind of hip in numerous semi-obscure films well worth checking out if you can find them: Last Picture Show, Fat City, Bad Company, The Last American Hero, Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, Rancho Deluxe, Hearts of the West, Winter Kills. He went on to a marvelous, and very successful career – a superbly consistent actor – but in his own way he is the outstanding newcomer of this decade.\n\nWhile there were certainly stunners starring in the 70′s – Faye Dunaway, Julie Christie and Queen of the 70′s, Jane Fonda – less traditional kinds of beauty entered the cinema: Sissy Spacek, Liza Minnelli, Barbra Streisand, Diane Keaton, Louise Fletcher, Marsha Mason, Jill Clayburgh, Ellen Burstyn, Sally Field, Glenda Jackson.\n\nFonda’s 70′s achievement was lost in her politics and subsequent identity shifts (Workout! anyone): but the 1969 They Shoot Horses allowed her to step out of her ingénue roles into the live wire women in Klute, Julia, Coming Home, The China Syndrome, and two Oscars. Most Valuable Actress of the Decade.\n\nFilms that destroyed the 70s:\n\nAmerican Graffiti – Wonderful film which retreated to reactionary nostalgia and inspired crap like Grease and Happy Days. This nostalgia ultimately lead to the election of Ronald Reagan who wanted to take America back to the good old happy days. These films eschew the tragic and the complex.\n\nRocky – Lovable loser triumphs: a simplistic corrective to the righteous despair of most of these films.\n\nJaws – If your film doesn’t gross 100 Million, why even bother.\n\nStar Wars – Make a film that can be reproduced ad infinitum.\n\nOne From the Heart – after four consecutive, undeniable masterpieces – along with The Godfathers, The Conversation, and Apocalypse Now – this film capsized genius Coppola financially and artistically, exposing the downside of this era’s grandiosity. He never recovered."
