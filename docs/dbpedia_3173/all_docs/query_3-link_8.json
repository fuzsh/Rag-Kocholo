        "text": "I guess this would have been 1975 or 76. I was just a dumb kid wanting to learn to play guitar.\n\nMy parents were pretty close friends with a country band in the local music scene (My \"uncle\" Bernie sounded just like Don Williams--smooth as silk), and they had arranged for a pig roast at my family's farm. A bunch of musicians showed up including Craig Fuller and John David Call. For those who don't recognize the names, they were in a little band called \"Pure Prairie League\" and they still get some airplay today.\n\nAnyhoo, I was the kid pestering the adults (11 or 12 yrs. old) and I remember telling Craig Fuller that I wanted to learn to play guitar.\n\nyoung subsailor: I want to play guitar and be a rockstar!\n\nCraig Fuller: Really? What songs do you like?\n\nYss: I really like that song \"Amie\" Do you know it?\n\nAnd that is how I got a private audition of one of my favorite tunes as a pestiferous young punk.\n\nI've never personally met anybody famous but I've seen a few. Every year we have a National Old Time Fiddle Contest here and years ago when it was really fun to see, Buck Owens played in a local bar. Merlon Olsen was a Pro football player if any of you doesn't know who he was, and also was in Little House On The Prairie. He was the Speaker at one of the high school graduations. His sister was Fawn Olsen and for years she owned Fawns Fudge Factory in town. Keep in mind we have two signal lights in town where I live so seeing anybody famous is a rarity.\n\nIf anybody has seen the movie Bronco Billy staring Clint Eastwood with Sondra Locke, Scatman Crothers, and Geoffrey Lewis, and several more, it was filmed here in town and I seen them all. I also seen Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges when they filmed Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. It was filmed down at Brownlee Reservoir and Hells Canyon, that's where I go fishing and camping.\n\nI know, I know, sounds boring as all get out but hey, for excitement we sit around and watch cars rust....\n\nI met Ray Davies 5 or 6 years ago (one of my all-time favorites) in the lobby of a hotel in Marion, Ohio. My wife and I were there to see Ray in concert and he happened to be staying at the same hotel (only decent one in town!). He was super nice ad spoke to me and my lovely wife (I was too flabbergasted to speak!) - I think he was glad to meet a fan who wasn't trying to get him to autograph album covers and other junk they had brought with them. BTW: his show was great too!\n\nI've shook hands with, and patted on the back, several presidential candidates and \"rock stars.\" 'Twas no biggie to me. But actually playing with a true musical genius, that was.\n\nIt was back in the Summer of `67 when I did 20 or 30 minute \"duet\" with Charlie Mingus. Just he and I, sitting on the grass (Well, I was; he was standing), in an East Village NYC park. Me on sitar, he on upright bass.\n\nThat, I admit to this day, was more than a bit of a wowza.\n\n-don\n\nWe get a lot of movie crews up here to film because of Winnipegs plethora of elderly buildings and the chances of seeing the famous and the not so famous are pretty good. Last summer Julia Roberts was here for a short stint of filming and the summer before I found out from my guitar tech that Keanu Reeves had popped into his shop to chat while filming in a private residence nearby. Phillip Seymor Hoffman filmed part of the Capote movie here and the ice pack scenes in the movie \"K19: The Widow Maker\" were film just north of here in Gimli, where Harrison Ford stayed for two days during the production. The only time I ever met anyone though was when my nephew was working security while Patrick Swayze was working on an HBO production in Winnipeg. My nephew snuck me on to the set at one point and introduced me to Swayze, who jumped back in mock suprise and said,\"not THE Uncle Mike?!\". He then reached out to shake my hand and said that my nephew had spoke often of me. He went on further to say that it was an honor to shake hands with a Vet who had served his country, and I must confess that I found that rather pleasing. We talked for about ten minutes or so more and then Swayze was off to do some more filming. Later I thought, what a gracious and thoughtful man. He was taken from us far too soon,...\n\nI get on a plane from Newark to Frankfurt. A guy has a Parker in a soft case. He has a coach seat, like me, and he's trying to talk the flight attendant into storing the guitar in the first class closet. It's Adrian Belew. I offer my seat. \"This gentlemen is one of the world's greatest guitarists.\" \"Thanks man.\" The attendant found a spot for the guitar. It was when I first began proclaiming that I see famous people who nobody knows.\n\nI get on a plane from Newark to Frankfurt. A guy has a Parker in a soft case.
