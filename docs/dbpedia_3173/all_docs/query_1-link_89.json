        "text": "Comedy is one of the most popular film genres, and this page looks at the 100 Aussie comedies that I have picked as our best, and ranked from #1 down to #100.\n\nAbout 20% of all Australian films have been comedies of one sort or another, meaning that over 500 Aussie comedies have rolled off the press so far. Some have been universally loved, some have been universally loathed, and many have appealed to one niche audience or another. Hopefully there is something here for everyone.\n\nIf you’re wondering why your favourite comedy did not make the list, see the Notes and Explanations section at the end.\n\nSo let’s count down, the top 100 Australian comedies, starting with #1:\n\n1. The Castle (1997) (Rob Sitch)\n\nA family of battlers, living under the flight path of the major airport next door, tries to save their beloved humble home from development. This film is a hilarious, affectionate look at Australian working-class life, poking gentle fun at many of our habits and concerns. The film captured the language and obsessions of a very average Aussie family, who try to hold on to their modest house right next to the airport. Many catch-phrases from the film have entered the Australian vernacular, including ‘Tell him he’s dreaming’, ‘This is going straight to the pool room’ and ‘Feel the serenity’. Made by Rob Sitch and the Working Dog team, who were TV comedians from The D-Generation and The Late Show, this film includes some of our great comic actors, particularly Michael Caton, but also Stephen Curry and Eric Bana (before he became a Hollywood action hero). This film was very successful at the box office and is regularly chosen as Australia’s favourite Australian film (for example in polls in 2005, 2008, 2011, 2018, and 2022) though non-Aussie audiences may find it baffling – even long-time resident David Stratton didn’t get the humour. But it is Australia’s best-loved comedy. (See here for more information)\n\n2. Muriel’s Wedding (1994) (P.J. Hogan)\n\nMuriel, an ABBA-obsessed, wedding-obsessed dreamer from a hilariously/tragically dysfunctional family, escapes her dominant father and stultifying small town with the help of a rebel school-friend, and learns a bit about real life. This is a hilarious satire about Australian family life and conformity. Toni Collette (one of my favourite Oz actresses) plays the deluded, but loveable, Muriel, who dreams of a fab wedding but has none of the social skills to achieve it, until rebel Rachel Griffiths and fate help her attain it. There are so many things to love in this film: Muriel’s awful family (consisting of the patriarch, a local politician/businessman ‘big fish in a small pond’ played by Bill Hunter, a downtrodden mother who is no role model, and a weird assortment of no-hoper siblings), Muriel’s awful bitchy friends from school, Rachel Griffith as Rhonda, the switched-on fellow outcast who teaches Muriel about real friendship, the South African swimmer seeking Australian citizenship through marriage despite his shock and distaste at Muriel’s rough edges, and of course the fabulous ABBA number Muriel and Rhonda perform. A wonderful snapshot of some of the funnier things in Australian society. The film was also voted as one of Australia’s six favourite Australian films in a 2008 AFI online poll, and again in 2011, 2018, and 2022). (See here for more information. This film also appears on my top rom-com list)\n\n3. The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994) (Stephan Elliott)\n\nThree drag queens decide to leave Sydney and cross the outback in a silver bus called ‘Priscilla, Queen of the Desert’ performing exuberant drag shows in isolated outback towns. This is a flamboyant, hilarious romp of a road movie with wonderful costumes, great one-liners, and spectacular musical numbers, mixed with occasional sadness and intolerance. The movie is a landmark of Australian gay film-making and represents our most successful gay-themed film. The three leads, Terrence Stamp as the older transsexual and Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce as the fellow drag queens, are perfect, full of bitchy pizzazz and camp fun. The film was also voted as one of Australia’s five favourite Australian films in a 2008 AFI online poll, and again in and 2022. (See here for more information)\n\n4. Crackerjack (2002) (Paul Moloney)\n\nA mid-40s scallywag joins a city lawn bowling club to get the free parking place, but finds himself increasingly entangled in the lives of the retired bowlers and their efforts to save the club from developers. This is a hilarious look at one of Australian society’s old institutions: the largely Anglo-Celtic pensioner-dominated lawn bowling club, with its neat white uniforms, strange polite rituals, cheap beer and daggy food like cheese sandwiches and pies. The film is chiefly a vehicle for Mick Molloy, a scruffy TV comedian from the 1990s ABC comedy The Late Show, but includes many other Australian comedians, such as Judith Lucy, Tony Martin and the great John Clarke as the greedy developer, as well as a host of wonderful older actors, led by the ever-reliable Bill Hunter. This film is full of laughs, as well as gentle affection for the quaint culture of lawn bowls and traditional Melbourne. (See here for more information)\n\n5. The Dish (2001) (Rob Sitch)\n\nA bunch of everyday Aussies, working at the radio telescope in the rural town of Parkes west of Sydney, get to play a vital role in the 1969 Apollo moon landing. This excellent comedy was made by the same team that had such success with The Castle (as well as a string of TV hit comedies such as The D-Generation, The Late Show, Frontline and more recently political satires including The Hollowmen and Utopia). This is another big hearted comedy about simple Aussie blokes, who this time get caught up in an international event. Sam Neill heads the team, but Kevin Harrington and Tom Long, who both played in Seachange, add to the film’s down-to-earth Aussie humour. It’s another triumph for the producers and did very well at the box office. (See here for more information)\n\n6. Chopper (2000) (Andrew Dominik)\n\nThis is an imaginative comedy about a real life criminal, Mark ‘Chopper’ Read. Chopper was a violent criminal, hit-man and gang leader, who spent a lot of time in jail, but was never convicted of murder, and later wrote a best-seller about himself and became a stand-up ‘gangster’ comedian. This imaginatively structured film gives insights into the adventures of the articulate but crazy hitman known as ‘Chopper’ whose grisly exploits fascinated the Australian media and public. Eric Bana creates an amazingly believable Chopper, a man able to disconnect himself from and articulately rationalise his violent deeds. The film blends violence and humour – a strange mix which mirrors Chopper’s personality. The film won Dominik the AFI Best Director award and Bana won the Best Actor award. (See here for more on this film. This film also appears on my top crime-comedies list)\n\n7. Don’s Party (1976) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nThis film version of David Williamson’s famous play was a landmark film in Australia’s mid-70s revival. Like most Williamson plays, the film is full of fast, clever dialogue, jealousies, hypocrisies, insults and turmoil. What’s more, the film was made by one our best directors and a group of the best actors of the era, including John Hargreaves, Ray Barrett, Graeme Blundell and the great TV comedian Graham Kennedy in one of his few film roles. The story concerns a group of middle-class Aussies who hold a party to celebrate the Labor Party’s anticipated victory in the 1969 election, but as the alcohol flows and it becomes clear that Labor has lost, the mood turns ugly and spouses and friends turn on each other. So see this film for its humour, its comments on Australian politics, its insights into human nature, its observations of the sexism and sexual politics of the time, and its depiction of the odd world of 1960s Anglo-Australian middle-class suburbia, before migrants and Whitlam turned things upside-down. (See here for more information)\n\n8. Strictly Ballroom (1992) (Baz Luhrmann)\n\nBaz Luhrmann’s debut film Strictly Ballroom was a rom-com set in the glitzy, pompous world of competitive ballroom dancing. Scott Hastings is on his way to being a champion dancer, but his desire to innovate and try new steps brings him into conflict with the establishment. When his partner rejects him until he dances properly, Fran, a shy wallflower from the beginners group takes his side, and together they begin to practice secretly, and fall in love. The film is full of memorable characters: Paul Mercurio is excellent as the young innovator Scott, Tara Morice blossoms as his shy wallflower dance partner who introduces him to flamenco dancing, Bill Hunter dominates in another of his mini-tyrant roles as the inflexible head of the ballroom dancing association, Barry Otto (a favourite actor of mine) plays Scott’s father, a shy dreamer with a big secret; and many others are excellent. This film is colourful, fast-moving, full of dance and music, and a lot of fun. (See here for more information. This film also appears on my top rom-com list)\n\n9. Kenny (2006) (Clayton Jacobson)\n\nKenny Smyth is the manager of Splashdown, a portable toilet business, and the film takes you on a tour his business activities, during which you also get to see his private life. This film demonstrates the best of toilet humour, as Kenny teaches us a thousand euphemisms for natural human functions and the associated paraphernalia. Kenny is a man who sees it as his life’s mission to ensure everyone, everywhere has a pleasant place to relieve themselves at the thousand temporary celebrations that take place in and around Melbourne. Kenny even goes to a portable-loo conference in Nashville, enabling a bit of cross-cultural fun. Shane Jacobson is perfect as Kenny, and somehow manages to keep the joke going seamlessly for 90 minutes and leave you smiling at the end (if you like a good poo-joke, that is). Jacobson co-wrote the script with his brother Clayton, who directed the film, and the film was a surprise hit in Australia. (See here for more information)\n\n10. Malcolm (1986) (Nadia Tass)\n\nMalcolm is a somewhat odd tram worker and gadget builder, who is at a loss after his mother dies and he loses his job at the tram-sheds for building his own mini-tram. He takes a boarder, Frank who turns out to be a criminal, and when Frank’s girlfriend Judith moves in, Malcolm’s life is turned upside down. It’s an upbeat caper comedy in a downbeat part of Melbourne about a socially-challenged inventor. It’s a heap of fun, an interesting look at less salubrious parts of Melbourne in the 80s and one of Colin Friel’s best and most exuberant roles. This debut feature from Nadia Tass won a swag of AFI awards, including best film, director, and actor (Friels). (See here for more information)\n\n11. The Club (1980) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nThis is the second of Bruce Beresford’s adaptations of a David Williamson play, and it is just as enjoyable as Don’s Party above. Set in the world of sport, the story is about a young AFL (Australian Football) player who joins a big Melbourne club and begins to feel the pressure as intra-club intrigues, rivalries and jealousies play themselves out between the coach, board-members and players. Less claustrophobic than Don’s Party , which involved antagonists trapped in the same house together for several hours, this film uses various locations around Melbourne, and takes place over several weeks of the football season as the pressure builds and tempers fray. This film is full of great actors, including John Hargreaves, Jack Thompson, Graham Kennedy, John Howard (the Seachange one, not the Prime Minister) and Frank Wilson. The Club prickles with Williamson’s acerbic dialogue and fruity language as the characters try to survive the club’s hothouse atmosphere. (See here for more information)\n\n12. Mary and Max (2009) (Adam Elliot)\n\nThis feature, made in Claymation animation by director Adam Elliot, is something of an oddity. It tells of a lonely Australian girl, Mary Dinkle, who becomes the pen-friend of Max Horovitz, an older obese Jewish man with Asperger’s Syndrome in New York, bound together by their love of chocolate and toy figurines. The film is full of humour and poignancy as both man and girl struggle with life in a world where they do not seem to fit in. The film is narrated by Barry Humphries and voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Toni Collette and others, but it is the wonderfully quirky clay world created by writer/director that makes this film a delight. (See here for more information)\n\n13. Babe (1995) (Chris Noonan)\n\nThis is a very well-made and entertaining family film with talking pigs and other animals, having cute adventures down on a farm. The hero of the film is Babe, a baby-pig who wants to be a sheep-dog. Small children will love this film, and there’s enough laughs in it for adults to endure this fairy-tale of ambition and acceptance. The fact that it was written and produced by Dr George “Mad Max” Miller was a surprise to everyone, but George Miller has always been a great entertainer. (See here for more information)\n\n14. The Dressmaker (2015) (Jocelyn Moorhouse)\n\nA woman, the dressmaker Tillie Dunnage, played by Kate Winslet, returns to her tiny home town in rural Victoria to face her childhood demons, as well as her aging half-demented mother, Molly, played by Judy Davis. This new film from Jocelyn Moorhouse has it all: style, panache, humour, mystery, conflict, tragedy, revenge and heart. It is a story in the Australian literary traditions of Patrick White, Peter Carey or Tim Winton, and of films like The Eye of the Storm, Bliss or Cloudstreet. It has the toughness of the Australian rural experience, the sense of history and connections within small towns, with their mixture of kindness and cruelty, weird individuals, resilience, defeats and disappointments. With a wonderful troupe of mainly Australian support actors, including Hugo Weaving, Sacha Horler, Barry Otto, Kerry Fox, as well as handsome newcomer Liam Hemsworth, the town bristles with memorable characters who alternately torment and support Tilly and her mother. The film won Winslet the AACTA best actress award, and best supporting actress and actor awards for Davis and Weaving. The film is a tragi-comedy, walking a fine line between comedy and drama, but with the comedy prevailing in the end. (See here for more information)\n\n15. The Rage in Placid Lake (2003) (Tony McNamara)\n\nThis is a terrific little comedy about a young man, embarrassingly named Placid Lake by his hippie parents, who decides to reject their lifestyle and go straight. The film pokes fun at everything from aging hippies to corporate climbers, while Placid charts his own course somewhere in-between. Singer Ben Lee does a fine job as the cheerful, inventive Placid and Rose Byrne (in one of her last Oz films before she went on to fame in Hollywood) is great as his special friend Gemma. Garry McDonald and Miranda Richardson as Placid’s hippy parents are fantastic as well. This is one of Australia’s best comedies and deserves to be seen more widely. (See here for more information)\n\n16. Love Serenade (1996) (Shirley Barrett)\n\nLove Serenade is a dark satirical rom-com, and concerns two sisters in a tiny country town who end up competing for the affections of their new neighbour. Elder sister Vicki Ann (Rebecca Frith) is bossy and self-centred, and younger sister Dimity (Miranda Otto) is a bit slow, by the looks of things, with a very poor understanding of how human relationships work or how to communicate. Their romantic target, Ken Sherry (George Shevtsov), on the other hand, is a loathsome lothario, newly arrived from Brisbane with bucketloads of new-age philosophy, and whose main purpose is to seduce the gullible. He is a smooth-talking radio DJ at the local station with a fondness for Barry White songs. So this film is hilarious and sad at the same time – these people do bad things to each other, but somehow they had it coming. For anyone who has lived in country Australia, a lot of things will ring true in this film. It also includes a great Barry White-centred seduction soundtrack and Miranda Otto performs one of the most hilarious strip teases I have seen. (See here for more on this film. This film also appears on my top rom-com list)\n\n17. He Died with a Falafel in His Hand (2001) (Richard Lowenstein)\n\nThis is a very funny window into the lives of groups of young Aussie, share-house dwellers, with all their tribal communality, desire for fun and sex, laziness, inventiveness, sloppiness, ideals, unrealism, honesty, dishonesty, inquisitiveness, self-delusion, hopefulness, ambition and self-destructiveness. Danny goes from one house to another, looking to fulfil his desire to become a great writer, as other characters crash and burn around him, and both happy and unhappy houses fall apart, sometimes literally. Noah Taylor is excellent as the laid-back, somewhat melancholy Danny. Englishwoman Emily Hamilton as Sam, and Frenchwoman Romane Bohringer as Anya are intriguing as the female housemates who become most entangled in his life, and there are no end of good performances by Alex Menglet, Brett Stewart, Damian Walshe-Howling, Francis McMahon and others, as Danny’s eccentric mates. The film was based on the John Birmingham’s best-seller, though there have been changes made for the adaptation. This is a worthy companion to Lowenstein’s Dogs In Space as the definitive look at Aussie share-house culture. (See here for more information)\n\n18. Children of the Revolution (1996) (Peter Duncan)\n\nJudy Davis plays a Sydney communist who slept with Stalin just before he died. Her son Joseph, played by Richard Roxburgh, may or may not be Stalin’s love child. Or he may be the son of an ASIO/KGB double agent, played by Sam Neill. The question of Joseph’s parentage persists as he rises to power in Australia. This film is full of wicked fun and ideas and is a marvellous fantasy which pokes fun at political figures and ideas, while warning of their serious dangers. Judy Davis is wonderful as the true believer, a role for which she won the 1996 AFI Best Actress award, but the supporting cast is also top notch and, besides Neill and Roxburgh, it includes Geoffrey Rush and Rachel Griffiths, as well as American actor F. Murray Abraham playing Stalin. The film mixes comedy with drama and satire in a way which some critics found disconcerting, but all elements work well in their own way. (See here for more information)\n\n19. The Big Steal (1990) (Nadia Tass)\n\nThis is an enjoyable suburban teenage comedy, about car-obsessed boys and men and the girls who fancy them. Danny, played by Ben Mendelsohn, is a car-obsessed teenager, dreams of owning a Jaguar and having a date with Joanna (Claudia Karvan). He trades in his parent’s car but gets ripped off and has to come up with another plan with the help of his mates. The boy gets the car and the girl, but it’s by no means a straightforward process, with lots of laughs along the way. It’s well made with a heap of good actors, especially the still young Mendelsohn and Karvan. (See here for more information)\n\n20. Cosi (1996) (Mark Joffe)\n\nA young Sydney amateur theatre director, Lewis, finds a job with a Sydney psychiatric hospital (Rozelle) to provide therapeutic theatre for the inmates. But one particularly manic patient persuades him to try to stage the opera Cosi Fan Tutte with a cast of mentally troubled non-actors. This film is a real hoot, a magnificent ensemble piece with many great performances, particularly from Toni Collette and Barry Otto. Based on a Louis Nowra play, the film mixes pathos with mirth and succeeds through the wonderful combination of some of our best actors. Apart from Collette and Otto, there are Ben Mendelsohn, Rachel Griffiths, Colin Friels, Aden Young, Bruno Lawrence, Pamela Rabe, Paul Chubb, Colin Hay, Jacki Weaver, David Wenham, Kerry Walker, and Tony Llewellyn-Jones, all with their own different levels of madness. (See here for more information)\n\n21. Rams (2020) (Jeremy Sims)\n\nThis is an excellent adaptation of a 2015 Icelandic film of the same name, about two feuding brothers on adjoining farms who are thrown into disarray when a disease strikes their prize sheep herds. This Aussie version maintains many of the dramatic elements of that film, while introducing distinctive Australian elements. Veteran actors Sam Neill and Michael Caton anchor the film as the two cranky old brothers who have not spoken to each other for 40 years, despite living in adjoining farms and carefully watching and silently judging each other’s activities day after day. Sam Neill plays the more social Colin who gets on with his neighbours and attracts the attentions of the local vet Kat, played by Miranda Richardson (in another of her jaunts down-under). Michael Caton plays the grumpier, hermit-inclined Les whose main pleasures are drink, his sheep and beating his brother in the local agricultural show’s ram competition. It’s an engaging story of struggle, setbacks, natural disasters and rough humour, as adversity eventually forces the brothers to cooperate for the good of their beloved sheep. (See here for more information)\n\n22. Bad Boy Bubby (1993) (Rolf de Heer)\n\nPart comedy, part parable about child abuse, part avant-garde dystopian fantasy: Bad Boy Bubby is a film that defies classification while embracing multiple genres. But most commentators agree that this can be considered a black comedy, among other things. The story is about Bubby, a man who grows up confined to his blacked-out house by his batty, protective mum who tells him the world outside is contaminated by nuclear fallout, until finally, as an adult, he is forced to leave home. This film is hilarious and innovative, but also shocking and grimy in parts and not everyone will like it, so be warned. Nicolas Hope does a great job portraying a man who grows up with no social skills, weird habits and a limited vocabulary, due to his extended confinement with a mad woman – his mother. We are alternately horrified and amused by Bubby’s antics, both inside the house, and eventually outside when he meets other people for the first time. This was Rolf de Heer’s breakthrough film, and he has gone on to make a variety of interesting films in different genres. De Heer won the AFI award for Best Director for this film, and Hope won the best actor award. (See here for more information)\n\n23. Bliss (1985) (Ray Lawrence)\n\nFollowing a near-death experience, advertising executive, Harry Joy, starts to see the world and his family from a different point of view, imagining he is now in Hell. This is a highly entertaining, witty and innovative film, with elements of surrealism and layers of satire. The film is adapted from Peter Carey’s award winning 1981 novel Bliss (one of Ozflicks’ favourite Oz novels) and is the first film of Ray Lawrence, who won the AFI awards for Best Film and Best Director for this film (as well as for his second, Lantana, 16 years later). Lawrence was not prolific (with only three films in 20 years), but he did bring a daring imagination to his films. The film has a surreal beauty unmatched in Australian cinema. Barry Otto (a favourite actor of mine from Belvoir theatre in the 80s, but underused in films) is also great in the title role. (See here for more information)\n\n24. Dirty Deeds (2002) (David Caesar)\n\nThis is a fun film about a gang of inner-city criminals set in Sydney in 1969. Director David Caesar has created a colourful yet gritty world of Sydney’s late 60s underbelly: a world of cheerful yet violent standover men; sleazy, noisy, jolly clubs, full of customers trying desperately for a good time in a country waking from its sleepy post-war dream to a Vietnam War nightmare; and a world where 60s Carnaby Street fashion and beehive hairdos barely disguise an unsophisticated society wondering what to do with its rising prosperity. Bryan Brown is the centre of the film as Barry, a Sydney gang boss trying to deal with rival gangs and the arrival of two US mafia figures intent on introducing their new Los Vegas slot machines into Sydney. Toni Collette is cool, tough and sassy in her brightly coloured outfits as Barry’s indispensable wife, as she tries to keep him in line. Sam Worthington is excellent as the young Vietnam draftee, home to help his Uncle Barry in the family business, but distracted by Barry’s sulky, ambitious girlfriend Margaret, well played by Kestie Morassi. Sam Neill is the obligatory corrupt cop, on the take and trying to keep things from boiling over. And American funnyman John Goodman is excellent as usual, as a smooth-talking Chicago mobster-out-of-water on a last-chance mission to prove he’s not past it. It’s fast-moving retro fun. (See here for more on this film. This film also appears on my top crime-comedies list).\n\n25. Crackers (1998) (David Swann)\n\nThis is an out-and-out comedy in the vein of The Castle, and documents a young boy’s Christmas with his nutty extended family at his grandparents’ house. Lots of slapstick, fart jokes, out of control animals, randy relatives and family friction make this a wild ride along the borders of good taste (and not everyone will enjoy it as much as I did). Even David Stratton (he who gave The Castle only 1½ stars) found it funny! Though most of the actors are little-known, apart from England’s Warren Mitchell as the Scottish great-grandfather, the acting is great. (See here for more information)\n\n26. Gettin’ Square (2003) (Jonathan Teplitzky)\n\nThis is a very funny, well-written comedy about minor criminals, bent cops, social misfits, and a hero trying to escape the criminal world. Sam Worthington, in one of his early roles, plays Barry, a man who was sent to jail for a crime he didn’t commit and now wants to ‘get square’. Gary Sweet plays his dodgy ex-accomplice in one of his early bad-guy roles after years of being cast as a TV hero. British actor Timothy Spall seems quite at home in the sunny Gold Coast underworld, and David Wenham steals the show as an accident-prone heroin-addict Spit. The film was nominated for 14 AFI awards, and Wenham won the Best Supporting Actor award for his unforgettable performance. (See here for more on this film) (This film also appears on my top crime-comedies list).\n\n27. Hercules Returns (1993) (David Parker)\n\nThis is a ‘film-within-a-film’, where a group of friends take over an old cinema, run into a problem on their opening night: they find their first film, an 1960s Italian ‘Sword and Sandal’ epic called Hercules, Samson, Machismo and Ursus Are Invincible, is in Italian with no English subtitles. They decide to dub the film live into Aussie English themselves, despite not understanding Italian. Though not to everyone’s taste, some people will find this ‘dub-parody’ hilarious, myself included. Based on a popular live show, the three new cinema operators, Brad (David Argue), McBain (Bruce Spence), and Lisa (Mary Coustas), manage to make up Australian idiomatic dialogue and sound effects for the movie. Woody Allen did a similar thing in the 60s with an old Japanese film in What’s Up, Tiger Lily?, but Parker’s film is just as good as Allen’s, especially to the Australian ear. Not every joke comes off, but they come so thick and fast that there’s not long to wait for another. It’s silly, but fun. (See here for more information)\n\n28. The Adventures of Barry McKenzie (1972) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nThis is a ribald, very-1970s, comedy about Barry McKenzie, a young Australian larrikin in London visiting London for the first time, who drinks a lot of beer, swears a lot, vomits a lot and makes fun of pommies with his Aussie ex-pat mates in England. The film was based on a comic strip by comedian Barry Humphries, who wrote the script, and also played Edna Everage and other characters in the film. The film is notable for its colourful Aussie slang, broad Aussie accents and constant denigration of the English, even if Barry comes to quite like them in the end. Barry Crocker is good as Barry, the good-natured, naïve Ocker tourist, and Barry Humphries is also funny at times. The plot is pretty silly and episodic, and the film’s main interest these days is as a social document as some of the humour seems embarrassingly dated and very un-PC now. This film was one of the early films of the Australian cinema revival, and, by making money at the box office, encouraged other Aussie film-makers to have a go, and so helped revive the moribund Oz film industry in the 1970s. The success of this film encouraged a similar sequel two years later, Barry McKenzie Hold His Own. (See here for more information)\n\n29. Bran Nue Day (2009) (Rachel Perkins)\n\nThis is a musical-comedy-romance about an Aboriginal teenager who is sent away by his religious mother to a Catholic boarding school near Perth but escapes to return to his family and the girl he loves. It is one of Australia’s few ‘real’ musicals (where characters burst into song to express their thoughts and feelings as opposed to films about musicians like The Sapphires), and succeeds on that level. It’s lively, funny and strong musically, starring singers Jessica Mauboy and Missy Higgens, as well as top Oz actors Geoffrey Rush, Magda Szubanski, and Deborah Mailman along with a host of newcomers. The film is joyous celebration of Aboriginal identity and is a real rarity in Australian cinema. (See here for more information)\n\n30. Crocodile Dundee (1986) (Peter Faiman)\n\nCrocodile Dundee, with its rough, tough, bush adventure hero, is many things, an adventure film, a rom-com, and a comedy, in roughly equal parts. Mick ‘Crocodile’ Dundee is tough wisecracking crocodile hunter from Walkabout Creek in the NT outback who meets an American woman journalist and travels to NY for some funny ‘fish-out-of-water’ comedy, as well as a final happy romance between the two opposites. It is the most successful Australian film ever, but not our best comedy, despite some clever one-liners from Paul Hogan, who was a veteran Aussie TV comedian. (See here for more about the film)\n\n31. Bad Eggs (2003) (Tony Martin)\n\nMick Molloy and Bob Franklin play two accident prone cops who find themselves in the middle of a web of corruption that they must try to expose, or at least survive. Molloy and Franklin have a witty, and extremely dry, line of repartee, and the film has an endless line of visual jokes (such as the extended runaway driverless car sequence at the beginning), as the two slacker-cops stumble their way into a vast net of corruption in the state of Victoria. They are joined by Judith Lucy who plays an ex-cop, ex-girlfriend and tabloid journalist on the trail of the corruption story, as well as Alan Brough as a mild-mannered IT nerd, and Robyn Nevin as the wife of a murdered judge. Ranged against them are Nicholas Bell as a sinister bent detective, Bill Hunter as Police Chief Pratt, and fellow comedian Shaun Micallef as the politician at the top of the corruption tree. With such comedic talent, as well as fellow comedian Tony Martin as writer-director, it’s a real treat with lots of explosions, shootings and double-dealing leavened with the driest of dry humour. Much of the same team were behind the comedy classic Crackerjack, and this film is a worthy companion. (See here for more on this film. This film also appears on my top crime-comedies list, but is definitely the funniest and least black of the crime-comedies).\n\n32. The Man Who Sued God (2001) (Mark Joffe)\n\nA man whose boat is destroyed by lightning, and whose insurance claim is denied as the lightning was an ‘act of God’, brings a court case against the major churches as representatives of God on earth. This film is an entertaining comedy about another Aussie battler (this time played by extroverted Scot Billy Connelly) and also stars Judy Davis in an unusual but welcome comic role. The writing by political speechwriter and prolific author on all things Australian, Don Watson and the great Kiwi satirist John Clarke, is top notch and ensures the film has social comment to augment the comedy. The film is attractively shot and enhanced by its sunny NSW South Coast and Sydney settings. (See here for more information)\n\n33. The Merger (2018) (Mark Grentell)\n\nAn eccentric loner agrees to coach an endangered small-town football team, and controversially includes some resettled refugees in his plans. This film, written by its star, comedian Damian Callinan, is an affectionate, very funny look at small-town Australia, with the interplay of individual eccentricities faced with the challenge of change, in this case the arrival of a group of refugees under a government rural resettlement scheme. The film looks at the fears and prejudices of the locals and the newly arrived, and the opportunities for cultural exchange through such institutions as the local school and the love of football. The film succeeds where other comedies fail, through its witty use of language, and Callinan’s understated delivery, as well as a story that progresses towards its, somewhat predictable, happy end, in a reasonably believable manner. (See here for more information)\n\n34. They’re a Weird Mob (1966) (Michael Powell)\n\nThe oldest film in this selection follows the comic adventures of an Italian migrant, Nino Cullotta, who arrives in Sydney in the early-1960s, and has to learn to fit in with the odd locals. Italian star Walter Chiari is perfect in the lead role, full of a cheerful energy that carries him through many challenging situations. The film also features many great Australian actors of the time, including Chips Rafferty, John Meillon, Ed Devereux, Slim deGrey, and even has a cameo from Graham Kennedy, playing himself. The film offers an idealised view of the immigrants’ story, with little of the racism many faced, but at least it tells the story from a migrant’s view, which few other films or TV shows attempted. It was directed by the great British director Michael Powell, and while it’s not one of his best, it is a rare chance to see Australia as it was, more or less, at the time. The film was based on a popular 1957 novel of the same name. (See here for more information)\n\n35. Dating the Enemy (1996) (Megan Simpson Huberman)\n\nThis fantasy rom-com starts with a couple in trouble: Tash (Claudia Karvan) is a serious science journalist and Brett (Guy Pearce) is a presenter for a TV gossip show, and their differences are driving them apart. But, as they are about to split up, the moon works it magic and they wake up in each other’s bodies. The anatomical changes are confusing enough, but coping with the other person’s work, friends and social life is another kettle of fish. This is one of the better body swap fantasies around and, although Karvan is more convincing as a man than Pearce is as a woman, it’s a lot of fun, plus it has a satisfactory ending. (See here for more about the film. This film also appears on my top rom-com list).\n\n36. Death in Brunswick (1991) (John Ruane)\n\nThis is a black comic crime-romance with Sam Neill as a very average cook who gets mixed up with a bunch of low-level hoods and drug-dealers, and ends up with a dead body on his hands and two bunches of rival crooks baying for his blood. Carl has no money and a drinking problem, but a likeable shyness. He admits to being 34, but is more likely closer to, and possibly on the wrong side of, 40, and while it’s clear that the pretty 19-year old Greek waitress Sophie (Zoe Carides), who is engaged Carl’s loud Greek boss, is not really a suitable match for him, Carl falls in love anyway. Add in a Turkish kitchen-hand, who deals in stolen property and drugs on the side, a psychopathic Anglo bouncer and an unfortunate incident with a large pair of prongs, and there’s a gang war in which both sides are out to wreck revenge on Carl. Fortunately, Carl still has one helpful mate, Dave, played by the inimitable John Clarke, who is a gravedigger by day, and sometimes by night, when a mate needs a favour. It’s all a bit of a hoot, if a little messy at times. Yvonne Lawley is also very funny as Carl’s long-suffering mum, who still loves him when only a mother could. (See here for more on this film. This film also appears on my top crime-comedies list).\n\n37. Young Einstein (1989) (Yahoo Serious)\n\nYahoo Serious has reimagined Albert Einstein as the son of a Tasmanian apple grower who discovers the theory of relativity and splits an atom to add bubbles to beer. He heads for Sydney to try to patent the theory, where he meets the beautiful Nobel prizewinner Marie Curie, and also invents both the electric guitar and rock and roll. This film was unbelievably successful in Australia on its release, though it left overseas critics somewhat bemused by its broad humour. Nevertheless it is an imaginative and inventive bit of tomfoolery which casts a likeable and resourceful young Aussie lad as a brilliant inventor. Yahoo Serious wrote, directed and starred in this remarkable debut effort. The production is first class and Serious manages to maintain interest for the full 90 minutes, something that many comedies fail to do. Odile Le Clezio is also very good as Marie Curie who is besmitten with the young Einstein’s ideas, and John Howard plays the blackest of villains who tries to steal the credit from Einstein for his theories. The film is full of quirky humour, such as Sigmund Freud appearing in Paris accompanied by his mother. This film holds up surprisingly well 30 years later. (See here for more information)\n\n38. Girl Asleep (2015) (Rosemary Myers)\n\nA 14 year-old girl in the 1970s fears losing her childhood and fears becoming an adult like the strange ones in her family. On her 15th birthday, it all gets too much for her. This highly inventive coming-of-age story is reminiscent of both Muriel’s Wedding and the films of Wes Anderson. Bethany Whitmore is great as Greta, an awkward almost-15-year-old, dealing with bullies, strange girls who want her to join in their gang at school, her arguing parents, her rebellious older sister, and the fear of losing all her dear childhood attachments. Greta dreams and worries in the privacy of her room, which is full of stuffed toys, plastic horses, origami cranes and the music box she loves. Her only friend is a skinny, garrulous, red-haired geek called Elliott, who is delighted by everything about Greta. The film has fantasy elements and an extensive dream sequence (the ‘girl asleep’ reference) where Greta explores her fears in a dark forest with fantasy creatures and characters. The film also captures 70s suburban Australia with its brown and orange furnishing, colourful clothing and 70s music ranging from disco to the Angels. It’s a lot of fun. (See here for more information)\n\n39. A Few Best Men (2011) (Stephan Elliott)\n\nA young Englishman comes to Australia to marry his Australian fiancé. Unfortunately he brings his three mates as best men. This is an Australian/British hybrid gross-out comedy by the writer of Death at a Funeral and the director of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, and has a British and Aussie cast. The film has some genuinely funny moments and observation, but also has a fair dose of toilet humour and waltzes along the borderline of Brit-lad tastelessness, so be warned. It also contains a particularly lame best man’s speech (why has each British comedy since Four Weddings tried to outdo Hugh Grant’s best man’s speech by becoming ever more tasteless and less witty?) However, it’s great to see Olivia Newton-John trying to shed her 80s nice girl image, and she’s very funny here. For director Stephan Elliot it’s something of a return to form, after the wrong turn of Welcome To Woop Woop, where his humour-radar went a bit wonky. (See here for more information)\n\n40. A Sunburnt Christmas (2020) (Christiaan Van Vuuren)\n\nDaryl is a charming, rather hapless, small-time criminal, on the run from both the police and the thug from whom he stole a lot of money. He escapes from police custody in a Santa Claus costume and ends up in an isolated South Australian farm, where he is adopted by the two little kids who live there along with their smart teenage sister, and their somewhat-addled widowed mother. Daniel Henshall leaves behind his many crazy-man roles to play Daryl, and he’s great in this role. So are all the other, less known actors involved: especially Lena Nankivell as the gun-toting four-year-old Daisy, who totally believes that Daryl is the real Santa Claus; but also Eadan McGuiness as her slightly older brother Tom, who’s been afraid of everything since his father died, but who also comes to believe in Daryl’s Santahood; Tatiana Goode as the tough-minded teenager Hazel, who’s been running the farm since her mother went a bit loopy; and Ling Cooper Tang as the mother Fiona, driven to distraction by her husband’s inexplicable death and unable to cope with the debt-laden farm during the drought. The script is very witty and the plot is full of surprises, along with a few disguised messages about redemption, resilience and recovery. It’s most entertaining all round and a real surprise.

Dad and Dave: On Our Selection (1995) (George Whaley)\n\nThis comic remake of a series of famous Australian comedies from the 1930s (based on Steele Rudd’s 1899 book) still works surprisingly well, due largely to the standout cast, but its appeal might largely be restricted to older Australians who have at least heard of the original films. The film follows the adventures of a poor farming family led by Dad Rudd (played by Rumpole of the Bailey’s Leo McKern) and Mum (played with surprising panache by opera diva Joan Sutherland). They, along with their bumpkin son Dave (Geoffrey Rush), struggle to make a living from their little farm in 19th Century Queensland The rest of the wonderful cast, which includes Ray Barrett, Barry Otto and Noah Taylor, make this film a treat. (See here for more information)\n\n42. H Is For Happiness (2019) (John Sheedy)\n\nA precocious, enthusiastic twelve-year-old girl tries to fix her broken family in this delightful quirky comedy, which can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. Daisy Axon plays Candice Phee, a cheery, red-headed, dictionary-reading, bicycle-riding swot, who wants to restore the happiness of her mum, who can’t get over the cot-death of Candice’s baby brother, and her dad, who is still angry over a business bust-up with his brother, ‘Rich Uncle Brian’, who Candice loves. Adding to the action are other interesting side characters, such as her friend, ‘Douglas Benson from another dimension’ (Wesley Patten), her eccentric teacher with one rolling eye (Miriam Margolyes of course), and Douglas’ full-on mum (Deborah Mailman), as well as various animals. It’s well-written and acted, and set in a beautiful sun-drenched WA coastal town. (See here for more information)\n\n43. Road to Nhill (1997) (Sue Brooks)\n\nWhen four lady bowlers roll their car on the road to Nhill, the good people of Pyramid Hill in Victoria, manage to bungle the rescue. This is an affectionate and witty look at rural Aussies, especially of the older lawn-bowls generation, but also some young ones, each with their own particular concerns, peculiarities, priorities and foibles. As various local blokes try to take charge of the rescue, and various parties set off in different directions in the available emergency vehicles, it soon becomes clear that no-one is coordinating proceedings and no-one knows what the plan is. It’s a lot of fun, although the bumbling turns out to have serious consequences for some of those involved. The women in the overturned car soon find themselves at the mercy of the bumbling fellers, most of whom lack a shred of common sense. The veteran cast, many of whom returned for Crackerjack in 2003, is superb. This is a great slice of Australian country life. (See here for more information)\n\n44. Little Monsters (2019) (Abe Forsythe)\n\nAn out-of-work musician volunteers to help on his nephew’s school farm excursion because of the beautiful teacher, but the two must fight off a zombie outbreak to save the kids. This film of a young man’s redemption through love and zombie splatter is not for everyone, with its foul language, zombie gore and unappealing behaviour. But, like the main character, the film is saved by the sunny goodness of the infants school teacher, Miss Caroline, played by African-American actor Lupita Nyong’o. Dave (Alexander England) is a selfish, useless busker, who never got over the demise of his death-metal band six years earlier, and who is a terrible role model for his 7-year-old nephew Felix, whose mother Tess (Kat Stewart) is letting Dave crash on her couch. Director Abe Forsythe loves pushing the boundaries of tastelessness, and the film starts unpromisingly with plenty of bad behaviour, silly jokes and zombie clichés. But somehow he pulls it back and introduces a sweetness and a few moments of genuine humour into the film by the end. Lupita Nyong’o is the lynchpin of the film as the teacher everyone would want, but the other actors are also good. American comedian Josh Gad has the thankless role of a foul-mouthed children’s entertainer whose callous selfishness overshadows even Dave’s. So if you can stand a bumpy start, a little zombie-makeup and buckets of gore, this film has its pleasures by the end. (See here for more information)\n\n45. Around the World in Eighty Ways (1988) (Stephen MacLean)\n\nTwo brothers take their almost-blind, almost-crippled father on a pretend around the world trip in pursuit of his wife who has run off on a real trip with their loathsome neighbour. This is a very funny madcap farce, with dozens of great jokes as bothers Wally (Philip Quast) and Eddy (Kelly Dingwall) go to extreme lengths to save money by dressing-up as countless foreign characters, and creating foreign worlds in their absent neighbour’s lounge-room, in order to make their aged father Roly (Allan Penney) think he is travelling around the world to catch up with his wife (who is actually having an awful time overseas). Amazingly the joke is successfully maintained until the film’s surprising and satisfying climax. Providing good support are Gosia Dobrowolska as the scrumptious Nurse Ophelia Cox, Diana Davidson as the missing wife and mother, and Rob Steele as the despicable neighbour. This film is the spiritual godfather to Stephan Elliot’s The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and Welcome to Woop Woop. (See here for more information)\n\n46. Siam Sunset (1999) (John Polson)\n\nSiam Sunset starts out as a blackish comedy, and turns into a rom-com during the course of the film, when Perry (Linus Roache) meets Grace (Danielle Cormack). Perry is a British paint scientist, convinced he is jinxed after his beloved wife is killed in a freak accident involving a fridge and gravity. Grace is on the run from her homicidal drug-dealer boyfriend in Adelaide. They meet on the bus tour from hell on the road to Darwin, along with various Aussie oddballs, but fate and freak weather intervene. The two likeable lead actors and the array of weird Aussies on the bus tour make this most enjoyable. (See here for more about the film. This film also appears on my top rom-com list)\n\n47. Mental (2012) (P.J. Hogan)\n\nA non-conformist hitchhiker is hired by a small-town politician as a nanny for his five girls, who all imagine they have mental problems after their mother is sent to an institution. This 2013 follow-up by PJ Hogan to his 1994 Muriel’s Wedding has perhaps too many similarities to his earlier film, but also enough differences to make it enjoyable. Also set in a dysfunctional (‘mental’) family of a domineering Gold Coast politician, this film takes The Sound of Music rather than Abba as its theme. This time Toni Collette plays the outsider who rescues the women of the family from their victimhood, allowing them to revel in their ‘mental-ness’ rather than be disabled by it. This is a real romp, covering familiar territory to Muriel’s Wedding, but in a different way, and with different results. (See here for more information)\n\n48. Soft Fruit (1999) (Christina Andreef)\n\nFour siblings return to their family home to be with their mother who has early stage terminal cancer, reviving past relationships and grievances. Although the issue at the heart of this film – terminal cancer – does not lend itself to comedy, the mother at the centre of the film, played by Jeanie Drynan, is so full of life and happiness at having her children home, that at first the danger does not seem real. The three roly-poly daughters, Josie (Genevieve Lemon), Vera (Alicia Talbot), and Nadia (Sacha Horler), and the petty-criminal son Bo (Russell Dykstra) all arrive home with their various issues, and they argue and play jokes on each other, while trying, in their own flawed ways, to care for their mother. Their mother though is oblivious to their petty problems, and she simply delights in her children’s presence in the family home once again. This film is delightfully bittersweet and brings the joy of an imperfect family to life with a series of great performances. Both Russell Dykstra and Sacha Horler won AFI acting awards and Jeanie Drynan was also nominated. (See here for more information)\n\n49. Dr Plonk (2007) (Rolf De Heer)\n\nAustralia’s maverick Rolf De Heer’s varied career took another turn with this eccentric comic black and white silent film. Made in the style of early silent era comedies, this film tells the story of Dr Plonk, and his family, consisting of his wife, deaf and dumb servant, Paulus, and dog, Tiberius, who live in 1907 Adelaide, but travel to 2007 for familiar time travel jokes. The film is full of chases, hijicks and all manner of slapstick comedy. De Heer captures the era perfectly and his performers are superb – Dr Plonk is played by a former street clown, Nigel Lunghi; his wife is famous TV comedienne Magda Subinski, and Reg the dog does a great job as Tiberius, stealing many scenes. I found this hilarious, though some I know can’t bear the 1920s ragtime piano music, typical of old silent films. (See here for more information)\n\n50. The Brush Off (2004) (Sam Neill)\n\nWhen politician Angelo Agnelli is appointed state Minister of Arts and Water, his political adviser Murray Whelan gets into more trouble, this time with art forgers and dodgy businessmen who dabble in the local art market. In the second adaptation of one of Shane Maloney’s crime novels (after Stiff below), Sam Neill and writer John Clarke came up with another hilarious comedy about venal politicians, pretentious art aficionados and dirty deals in the local art market. David Wenham is again excellent as the hapless Murray Whelan, who is forced to go places that most political advisors would wisely avoid. He is supported by some great performances: Mick Molloy as the craven politician, Deborah Kennedy as Whelan’s supportive offsider, Steve Bisley as a tricky businessman, Justine Clarke as a flighty art journalist, Leah Vandenberg as Wenham’s love interest, Andrew S. Gilbert as another of Whelan’s fellow staffers, Heather Mitchell as a supporter of the arts and a plotter, and Bruce Spence as the exuberant art gallery director. The story is easier to follow than Stiff, and just as entertaining and funny. (See here for more on this film. This film also appears on my top crime-comedies list).\n\n51. Stiff (2004) (John Clarke)\n\nMurray Whelan is a staffer at the office of a conniving suburban politician. When a body is found at the local meatworks, he gets dragged into a web of crime, murder and political corruption from which he barely escapes alive. The real star of this entertaining and fast-moving comedy thriller is writer-director’s John Clarke’s droll and economic screenplay. The film displays all of John Clarke’s dry wit and pithy wordplay, well delivered by David Wenham, as the self-effacing and increasingly embattled Whelan, as well as Julian O’Donnell as his son, and Deborah Kennedy as his long-suffering co-worker. In addition there are a host of hilarious minor characters, all adding to the rich Melbourne social tapestry. The film looks at the lives of all the little people that inhabit an ethnically-mixed area of Melbourne, as well as all the political, business and criminal deals that operate just under the surface of society. Though the plot is a bit too hastily explained at times, the film contains the right mix of comedy and tension. This film sees both John Clarke and David Wenham doing what they do best. After this Wenham began to be cast in villain roles, but his best work was as a quietly spoken and likeable working class bloke. (See here for more on this film. This film also appears on my top crime-comedies list).\n\n52. Ali’s Wedding (2017) (Jeffrey Walker)\n\nIn Australia’s first Muslim rom-com, Ali (Osamah Sami), a young Shia Australian-Iranian boy, is expected to marry a girl from his own community, but meets a Sunni Lebanese girl, Dianne (Helena Sawires) at school and falls in love with her. However while Dianne passes her final exam and is accepted into Medicine at Melbourne University, Ali’s marks are not good enough. Embarrassed and eager not to disappoint his father, he pretends that he also got into medicine, but of course is only postponing the inevitable. As his lies pile up, he tries to figure out how he can marry Dianne and find a solution to his quandary. This is a refreshing ethnic rom-com from writer-actor Osamah Sami, which depicts the life within one of Australia’s many subcultures. The film is a lot of fun, and the main characters have the necessary charm to make you care, despite Ali’s idiotic choices. (See here for more about the film)\n\n53. 48 Shades (2006) (Daniel Lapaine)\n\nWhen 16-year-old schoolboy Dan’s parents move to Geneva for work, Dan stays behind and moves into an old house in Brisbane with his 23-year-old aunt, Jacq, who plays in a rock band, and her pretty uni-student flatmate, Naomi, on whom Dan develops an instant crush.\n\nThis is a comedy doomed crushes, young love, share houses, growing up, and life in Brisbane in the 1990s. The film is full of good performances, particularly from the main three characters: Richard Wilson as the shy, confused Dan, a blonde Emma Lung as the sweet and attractive young woman who chooses the wrong guys, Naomi, and Robin McLeavy as the cool auntie Jacqui who has her own secret. Add in Nicholas Donaldson as Dan’s sex-crazy mate, Michael Booth as the nutty landlord, and Victoria Thaine as a girl who actually fancies Dan, and there are plenty of laughs. The film is an adaptation of Nick Earls’ popular novel 48 Shades of Brown, and pleased most fans of the book, which is always a high bar. (See here for more information)\n\n54. Starstruck (1982) (Gillian Armstrong)\n\nThis is a lively musical comedy about a young woman who lives in a working class pub in Sydney Rocks district with her family, and wants to become a famous singer. Australian musicals are rare indeed, but this is a good one, full of energetic pop-songs and jerky 80s dance numbers, but with an engaging story of a quirky, working-class girl who wants to be a pop star. Jo Kennedy plays the girl, Jackie Mullens, with loads of charm and energy, and she is supported by a host of minor characters playing her pub-owning family. This film has a lot of ardent fans, and is most popular with teenage audiences, or those who saw it first when they were young. The film makes the most of its the location in a famous Rocks pub, and captures the feel of early 80s Australia. (See here for more information)\n\n55. Save Your Legs! (2012) (Boyd Hicklin)\n\nAn amiable comedy about an amateur cricket club which undertakes a tour of India to play amateur teams there. This is a nicely paced amusing comedy which relies on its mix of odd characters: Stephen Curry plays the cricket-mad president, Edward “Teddy” Brown, for whom cricket is the greatest thing in his life; Damon Gameau plays Stavros, the young fast bowler who believes he is the star of the team and irresistible to women; Brendan Cowell plays Rick, the club captain, who likes to party too hard but is about to become a dad; and Darren Gilshenan plays Colin an older stats-mad vice-captain. The tour goes from initial excitement in Calcutta, to disappointment in Varanasi to a climax in Mumbai, when they play a Bollywood team, and each of the players reaches new levels of maturity about their lives. It’s a nice romp, with lots of colour and jokes and a satisfying climax. (See here for more information)\n\n56. Boytown (2006) (Kevin Carlin)\n\nThe members of a popular 90s boy-band try to reform twenty years later, and after failing to win the teeny-bopper crowd, aim to please their ex-fans who are now middle-aged like themselves. This film is full of Mick Molloy’s wry wit, and if you liked Crackerjack, Bad Eggs and The Late Show, you should like this. The story starts slowly and is a bit predictable during the set-up, but once the band decides to aim for the older demographic and the band starts writing songs about helping with the housework, and looking after the kids, the film picks up. In fact, the songs are the best thing about the film, as all the character stories follow a familiar arc. (See here for more information)\n\n57. You Can’t Stop the Murders (2003) (Anthony Mir)\n\nTwo small town cops, used to whiling away their dull days, are suddenly confronted by a grisly series of murders, seemingly related to the camp 80s disco band, The Village People. Though not everyone will like the dead-pan humour, for me this was a dumb cop caper that delivered. Gary Eck and Akmal Saleh are very likeable as the not-too-smart cops who usually spend their days waiting for a passing car to break the speed limit, but suddenly have a series of bizarre crimes to solve. Constable Gary is a line-dancing aficionado, and spends his non-dance time obsessing about Julie, the local TV reporter, while Constable Akmal is constantly thinking up dumb movie ideas. Things spin out of control when an ego-driven, trigger-happy detective, Detective Tony Charles (Anthony Mir), arrives from the city and makes a move on Julie. It’s chaotic fun, incorporating both the eccentricities of small-town Australia, and the bizarre fantasies of Eck, Saleh and Mir. The three leads are assisted by a whole tribe of other comedians from Australia’s stand-up comedy circuit, including Jimeoin, Bob Franklin, The Umbilical Brothers, Kitty Flanagan, Garry Who, Haskel Daniel, Richard Carter, The Dickster, Rash Ryder, Kenny Graham and, most memorably, the Sandman. (See here for more on this film. This film also appears on my top crime-comedies list).\n\n58. Mushrooms (1995) (Alan Madden)\n\nTwo old ladies, a kleptomaniac and an agoraphobic, accidentally rent out their spare rooms to both a criminal on the run and the policeman chasing him, but then find they have a body to dispose of without attracting attention. This is a very well-made and funny black comedy, but is not for the faint-hearted as there are gory scenes as the ladies find novel uses for a dead body. Luckily Julia Blake and Lynette Curran are wonderfully wicked and yet naïve as the two ladies in their house full of possibly stolen goods from their ex-husbands’ pawn shop business. Simon Chilvers is also impressive as the older policeman who is so taken with the romantic advances of the two ladies that he does not notice the evidence of several crimes under his nose. It’s something of a fantasy, but this film is worth seeing to see Blake and Curran at their best. (See here for more information)\n\n59. Hey Hey It’s Esther Blueburger (2008)\n\nEsther is an outsider: she is out of place as a Jewish nerd at her posh Waspy private school, and at home where her parents think that she and her twin brother Jacob are abnormal. Things change when she meets a tough girl from the local public school with a cool mum. This is a funny teen comedy about finding your place. Danielle Catanzariti as Esther and Keisha Castle-Hughes as her new friend Sunni are both full of lively charm. (See here for more information)\n\n60. Spider and Rose (1994)\n\nA young ambulance driver called Spider, on his last day of work, is forced to drive a feisty old woman called Rose from Sydney to Coonabarabran, a trip of six hours. Veteran actress Ruth Cracknell and first-timer Simon Bossell are both impressive in this amiable, and sometimes moving, odd-couple road-movie. Rose is still raw from the death of her husband a year before. She speaks her mind and doesn’t suffer fools. Spider is looking forward to having fun, after two years of seeing human trauma as an ambulance driver, but the long trip will make it difficult for him to get back to Sydney for his farewell bash, so he’s angry, and has no time for old ladies’ issues. (See here for more information)\n\n61. Backyard Ashes (2013)\n\nAfter a series of unfortunate incidents between two neighbours, a group of Australian mates play a rival group of Brits in a backyard cricket match, dubbed the Backyard Ashes. This film is a very funny celebration of the Australian tradition of backyard cricket, where local rules such as ‘six and out’ make it possible to play a game in a confined space. That said, it is a patchy production which starts shakily before finding a better rhythm in the second half. In the beginning it is intermittently funny, but a bit stereotyped in its portrayal of snooty, uptight Brits vs relaxed, hilarious Aussies, with the token Asian who can’t play cricket, and long-suffering wives who support their husbands’ obsession with drinking and cricket. Andrew S. Gilbert is very good in the main role as Dougy Waters, but Felix Williamson is given the thankless role of the humourless English snob who moves in next door. Comedian Damian Callinan manages to inject enough humour into the first half of the film to keep you going until the ‘match’. The match itself is nicely constructed to demonstrate each of the arcane rules of backyard cricket and reference many moments of cricketing history. It’s not a perfectly constructed film, but contains many funny moments. (See here for more information)\n\n62. Razzle Dazzle (2007) (Darren Ashton)\n\nTwo children’s dance troupes compete for the championship, and the egoistic dance teachers try to outdo each other with the most innovative routines. Meanwhile, there are pushy parents and volunteers trying their best to influence the results. There is a lot to love about this comedy, particularly the exuberance of the child dancers and the colourful dance routines. The film captures the clash of egos inherent in the competitive dance world, but also shows that the competition is much more important to some of the adults involved than to most of the children, who in the main just want to enjoy the delight of dancing. The chief characters are the ferociously ambitious dance teachers who compete with each other to win the dance championship. English comedian Ben Miller is very good as the dedicated Mr Jonathon, who tries to make socially relevant dance routines, while always hoping to beat the more conservative Miss Elizabeth whose ruthless discipline has seen her win most of the previous competitions. Then there are the ambitious parents, particularly Justine (Kerry Armstrong), who constantly trains and pushes her daughter to breaking point, and the serial foster-mother, Barbara (Denise Roberts), whose erratic actions endanger Mr Jonathan’s plans. The film is made as a mockumentary, with frequent interviews with each of the main characters, and the camera snooping around. There is a lot of humour, but also awkwardness, sadness, disappointment and ambition on display. The film improves as it goes on, and ends very well in the dance grand final. It’s a lot of fun. (See here for more information)\n\n63. Russian Doll (2001) (Stavros Kazantzidis)\n\nKatia (Natalia Novikova) is young Russian Jewish woman trying to stay in Australia after the death of her fiancé. Harvey (Hugo Weaving) is an ex-private detective who caught his girlfriend cheating and now lives a cynical hermit-like existence while he struggles to write a novel. When they are forced to share a flat, they loathe each other … at first. This is a lively rom-com set in Sydney’s Bondi Beach, which is also, incongruously, home to a large Russian Jewish community, and it is this community who provide much of the culture-clash humour in the film. David Wenham also plays Harvey’s Jewish friend and landlord, and Sacha Horler is delightful as a vampish Russian woman who befriends Katia. Not everyone likes this film, but I love it. (See here for more about the film)\n\n64. The Night We called it a Day (2003) (Paul Goldman)\n\nA young Australian rock promoter, Rod Blue, scores a coup by organising a tour by Frank Sinatra in 1974, but things turn sour when Sinatra clashes with an Australian female reporter, and things spin out of control. There is a whole lot of retro-fun in this fast-moving comedy, which has a couple of US stars, Dennis Hopper and Melanie Griffith, playing Frank Sinatra and his girlfriend Barbara Marx, as well as a couple more Aussie soon-to-be stars, Joel Edgerton and Rose Byrne, as the young Aussie music promoter and his girl. Add to these Portia De Rossi as the spunky young reporter who gets up Sinatra’s nose, and David Field as the still-boozing union boss Bob Hawke, and there’s never a dull moment. Based on the actual events of Sinatra’s troubled 1974 tour, the film brings into contrast American and Australian values at the time, with Sinatra as the Great American Individual versus the collective militancy of the Great Aussie Union Movement, with neither able to comprehend the other. (See here for more information)\n\n65. My Mother Frank (2000) (Mark Lamprell)\n\nA 51-year-old widow Francis “Frank” Kennedy (played by Irish actor Sinead Cusack) is eccentric and has too much time on her hands, so she enrols in Sydney University, much to the horror of her son David who is also enrolled there. This is a quirky comedy-drama with a wonderful array of acting talent, including Cusack, Matthew Newton and Sacha Horler as her student son and married daughter, Sam Neill as her grumpy lecturer, and Rose Byrne as her son’s friend. It’s an engaging story, in a Shirley Valentine sort of way, with an array of minor characters filling out a satisfying story. Frank is seen as something of a problem by her children, but at least she’s having a good time. (See here for more information)\n\n66. The Roly Poly Man (1994) (Bill Young )\n\nDirk Trent is, by his own admission, a ‘no-frills private eye in a bad suit, working the arse-end of the market’, dealing with insurance cases, cheating wives and unfaithful husbands. But when one of his cheating husbands turns into the first of a series of bizarre deaths, Dirk decides to follow the case to its grisly end. This is a low-budget film-noir spoof about a scruffy private detective, and his weird assortment of associates, who investigate some strange deaths in Sydney. Though it is without any famous actors, it works pretty well, with Paul Chubb convincing as the grubby gumshoe, and Les Foxcroft hilarious as his ancient but ingenious offsider, Mickey. Dirk tries to woo the charming morgue director Sandra (Susan Lyons) as he searches for clues to the mystery of the exploding brains. Meanwhile his ex-wife Laurel (Zoe Bertram) uses her sexual allure to twist him around her little finger whenever she needs him to mind their five children. All the while Dirk chain smokes and carries on a witty film noir narration which effectively maintains the mood. Some of the special effects are a bit icky (with lots of brain matter outside of craniums etc), but overall the story hangs together and it’s very funny. (See here for more information)\n\n67. The Return of Captain Invincible (1983) (Philippe Mora)\n\nCaptain Invincible, a popular American superhero who was denounced as a Communist sympathiser during the McCarthy era in the 1950s, ends up as a homeless drunk in Sydney in the 1980s, but when America is again threatened by the evil Mr Midnight, he gets the call to save America and the world. This musical super-hero adventure spoof is a lot of fun. The songs and dodgy special effects are cheesy to the max, there are tons of jokes, and the story keeps driving on through the madcap plot towards the satisfying climax. Somehow maverick director Mora manages to incorporate all the disparate elements into the film and create a very satisfying piece of entertainment. The large cast is used to great effect: Alan Arkin is very impressive as Captain Invincible, Christopher Lee is creepily crazy as Mr Midnight, and Australian actress Kate Fitzpatrick does a great support job as the detective who discovers Captain Invincible in Sydney and supports him in his comeback. I found this surprisingly funny and entertaining, in the manner of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. (See here for more information)\n\n68. Strange Bedfellows (2004) (Dean Murphy)\n\nTwo old mates in a country town, Vince (Paul Hogan) and Ralph (Michael Caton) decide to claim they are a gay couple in order to claim the tax benefits and solve Vince’s financial problems after his costly divorce. When the government sends an inspector, they are forced to pretend for real, with the added problem that people in the small town start to think they really are gay, much to their distress. It’s a pretty good comedy, helped by lots of great support characters. Michael Caton is excellent. The main problem is Paul Hogan, who is much more wooden. Perhaps he can only act as himself, and Crocodile Dundee. Still, this was better than expected with more laughs than groans. (See here for more information)\n\n69. Sweet Talker (1991) (Michael Jenkins)\n\nHarry Reynolds, a conman just out of jail, arrives in the sleepy coastal village of Beachport with ‘proof’ that the wreck of a Portuguese galleon is buried on a nearby beach and a plan to revitalise the town through tourism. Soon everyone wants to invest in his plan, but unwanted guests arrive, and Harry starts to fall for the divorced owner of his guest house. Bryan Brown is wonderful as Harry, the loveable conman who ruthlessly lies his way to a fortune, but finds that sleepy Beachport is where he feels at home, and that American divorcee Julie (Karen Allen) is the woman he would like to be with, if she’ll still have him when she finds out about his background. The film has plenty of energy with lots of colourful locals and some criminal types drawn by the scent of money and development opportunities. Justin Rosniak is also great as Julie’s son, who sees a father figure in Harry. It’s a lot of fun. (See here for more information)\n\n70. The Taverna (2019) (Alkinos Tsilimidos)\n\nKosta is the owner of a popular Greek restaurant in Melbourne, but things get out of hand one night when the belly-dancer’s ex-husband turns up with his lover. This is a highly entertaining farce, based in the real pain of a number of the characters: Kosta (Vangelis Mourikis) works hard to keep his staff and customers happy, but also has problems with his son; belly-dancer Jamilla (Rachel Kamath) has money problems since her husband left, and refuses to dance when he turns up with his lover; Turkish cook Omer (Senol Mat) carries the pain of his dead wife and children, but is also upset about the possums on the roof; and so on with the other characters. Add to this a couple of noisy drunks who arrive late into a sea of jealousy and resentment, and the amiable Kosta has his hands full keeping the peace. Reminiscent of Fatih Akin’s Soul Kitchen (about a Greek restaurant in Germany), much deeper than the Wog Boy films, and totally unlike My Big Fat Greek Wedding, this film takes a different look at people and their complex problems in today’s multicultural Australia. (See here for more information)\n\n71. Swinging Safari (2018) (Stephan Elliott)\n\nThis is Stephan ‘Priscilla Queen of the Desert’ Elliot’s portrayal of Sydney beach life in the 1970s. There are a tribe of kids running wild while their parents drink too much and dabble in garish furnishing, odd food, and wife-swapping with predictable emotional consequences. The film looks great in its recreation of 70s fashion and decoration, and has a lot of laughs, though many good ideas are wasted through lack of characterization and substantial narrative. Envisioned perhaps as a re-visitation to Puberty Blues from a more comic and absurdist angle the film focuses on the children and parents of the 70s beach suburbs rather than the adolescent girls of Puberty Blues. There is still a lot of fun to be had with the barrage of ideas in this film, and it should strike a note with those who grew up in the 70s. (See here for more information)\n\n72. Oz (1976) (Chris Lofven)\n\nDorothy, a young country-girl, wakes up after a car accident and wanders from town to town in country Victoria, meeting a variety of odd characters, before heading for the city to see a concert by the apparently sensational rock performer known as ‘The Wizard’. This 1976 low-budget musical remake of the Wizard of Oz in contemporary Australia is a curiosity. It follows a gormless Australian teenager, Dorothy, and three country dags – the dopey, stoned surfie, the sleazy mechanic and the agro but cowardly little bikie – as Aussie equivalents to Judy Garland’s Scarecrow, Tin Man and cowardly Lion. They set off for the city to see the last concert by ‘The Wizard’, a David Bowiesque gender bender, who the Good Fairy (a flamboyant gay man running a country town frock shop) has told Dot will change her obviously dull life. They are pursued by the Wicked Crim of the West who believes Dot inadvertently killed his equally criminal brother. The trip across country Victoria comes with a soundtrack of 70s Australian pub rock by Ross Wilson and Jo Jo Zep. It’s surprising fun, due in a large part to a good performance by Joy Dunstan as Dorothy, who combines country naivety with determination and energy. It’s quite low budget, and has a few slow moments, but overall it’s quite fun. (See here for more information)\n\n73. Down Under (2016) (Abe Forsythe)\n\nThis is a black comedy about the events behind the 2005 Cronulla race riot. Two groups of youths, one consisting of Anglo-Aussies from Cronulla, and the other made up of Muslim blokes from the Lakemba area, set out to defend their community from each other by beating up their perceived opponents. Both groups consist of a few fanatics as well as some half-hearted friends who are badgered into coming along for solidarity. The film makes fun of both groups and the stupidity of racism, but contains language and violence that might offend many. Closest in tone to the Paul Fenech Fat Pizza TV shows and films, the film plays with racial and social stereotypes and captures the vernacular of modern Australian working-class youths. It’s pretty good on some levels, though it did rely a little too much on F-bombs and mother***er insults. (See here for more information)\n\n74. Stan and George’s New Life (1992) (Brian McKenzie)\n\nStan is a 40-year-old bachelor working in his father’s barbers shop, but decides to try something new and applies for a job in the weather bureau, where he meets George, a similarly quiet woman from the country. They fall in love, and marry, but then the weather bureau starts to fall apart as more and more staff are retrenched. This is a gentle, witty and slightly absurdist comedy about two average people who find love after years of disappointment. It is also a satire on bureaucracy and Australian society in general. Paul Chubb is at his low-key best as the loveable, optimistic Stan, whose parents are constantly feuding and who is glad to escape their modest suburban home for a modest home with only George and himself. Julie Forsyth is his match, and though it seems that two low-key leads might be too much, somehow it works and their relationship ends up charming you. It helps that everyone around the couple are more crazy than they are, from their parents to their co-workers to their paranoid boss. (See here for more information)\n\n75. The Mule (2014) (Tony Mahony, Angus Sampson)\n\nA gullible footballer who becomes a drug mule from Thailand is caught at Customs, but tries to foil the police by refusing to empty his bowels for two weeks. Apparently based on true events, this film has some funny moments, but often veers away from comedy towards a grim crime story of tough, duplicitious crims, tough and possibly corrupt cops, and one poor innocent dupe who is forced to live in a hotel room with two policemen for nearly two weeks and somehow not go to the toilet while hoping that the condoms full of heroin in his intestine do not burst and kill him. Angus Sampson is quite good as the impassive mule; Hugo Weaving and Ewen Leslie are menacing in their ‘Bad Cop, Worse Cop’ routine; and Leigh Whanell and John Noble are effectively threatening as the two organisers of the failed smuggling enterprise. There is some violence and threatened violence, and a lot of poo references, but the story at least has an interesting and satisfying conclusion. Overall some people, but not everyone, will revel in this comedy, with all its ‘Oh No!’ moments. (See here for more information)\n\nLuc, a young Vietnamese-Australian man living the working-class, multicultural suburb of Yagoona, in Sydney’s West, is in trouble: he is unemployed, unskilled, broke and in danger of having his adored little sister taken away as he appears to be an unfit guardian. But he does have his mates that he grew up with in Yagoona, and a love of footy (in this case, rugby league). Luc and his mates form a team to compete in The Holden Cup, a rugby league competition with a first prize of a new Holden Ute, which might turn their luck around. This is a heart-warming story about a bunch of losers who get together to battle against better-known and better-financed teams to try to win a chance at both local glory and a prize that might turn their lives around. Anh Do is best known as a comedian and television painter, but this film is as much a drama as a comedy, as we can relate to Luc’s desire not be have his little sister taken away by the family services department, as well as his mates’ desire to overcome their disappointing adult lives for a little bit of the glory they remembered from their school footy team. Sure, it’s a bit of a fantasy, but it’s nice to see the little guys outsmarting the richer teams. It’s also a nice portrait of multicultural Sydney with the team made up of Vietnamese, Lebanese, Aboriginal, Islander and working-class Aussies all playing together and supporting each other.

Emerald City (1988) (Michael Jenkins)\n\nColin, a writer of plays and screenplays moves with his family from Melbourne to Sydney to try to get more of his scripts made into films. However, he finds that the producers do not want to make films of his serious scripts, and try to encourage him to be more commercially minded. This film is adapted from a play by Australia’s most successful playwright, David Williamson, who himself made the move from Melbourne to Sydney. The film has a strong cast: John Hargreaves plays Colin, the writer hoping to make some serious money in Sydney without compromising his artistic integrity; Robin Nevin plays his wife Kate, who works as a book publisher who consistently denigrates Sydney’s crass commercialism; Chris Haywood plays Mike, the arch-typical Sydney wheeler-dealer producer who tries to get Colin to write something more commercial; Nicole Kidman plays Helen, Mike’s beautiful young girlfriend who wants Mike to be successful, but who might be tempted if someone more successful came along; and Ruth Cracknell plays Elaine, Colin’s agent who tries to make him see sense. The film is funny and full of Williamson’s witty observations about human nature and Australian society. Perhaps the film is too full of Williamson’s dialogue, as sometimes the characters talk at a million miles an hour, seemingly to fit in all that Williamson has to say. The film has got a lot to say, and while it not be up there with Williamson’s best (like Don’s Party or The Club), it’s still very funny and the top-notch cast make it an enjoyable experience.

Dimboola (1979) (John Duigan )\n\nA Protestant boy marries a Catholic girl in the little country town of Dimboola in the 1960s, but their relatives cause havoc at the wedding. This comedy about a wedding in a small country town was adapted from a popular 1969 play by Jack Hibbert. More than many other larrikin/ocker comedies of the era, this film works due to its light touch, good pacing, charming musical interludes, interesting minor characters and the affection it brings to its subject. There’s a drunken bucks party and a stripper, incriminating photos, hints that the couple might be related, and a chaotic reception, all narrated by a British anthropologist studying typical Aussies. Bruce Spence plays the hapless groom, Morrie, and comedian Max Gillies plays the bemused British narrator. It’s a bit old fashioned, but it’s interesting and sometimes even funny.

The Coca-Cola Kid (1985) (Dusan Makavejev )\n\nBecker, a hotshot young American Coca-Cola representative arrives in Australia to try to fix a problem with the company’s Australian operation, but is perplexed by the locals. This film is based on a number of related Frank Moorhouse stories from his popular 70s books The Americans, Baby, and The Electrical Experience. The stories pitted the American way of doing business against the traditional Australian businessmen, as well as the challenge of a beautiful hippy girl to the business ideals of both the young American and her father There’s a lot to like about this film version of a script based on these stories: the film starts well, establishing the energetic character of Becker, as well as several quirky Australian characters, including that of the secretary Terri, played by the young and attractive Greta Scacchi, who injects a little chaos and sex-appeal into the story. The cinematography by Dean Semler is also excellent, capturing both mid-80s Sydney and the beauty of the Blue Mountains from interesting angles. There are a lot of surprising twists and action, though the film perhaps loses its way a bit towards the end. Though it’s not as good as the book (like most adaptations), it’s still an interesting comedy, and one of Greta Scacchi’s best performances in an Australian film. (See here for more information)\n\n80. Muggers (2000) (Dean Murphy)\n\nThis is a comedy about two final year medical students who drift into a niche area of crime through necessity. The two are desperate for money, to pay back a loan shark, to pay their overdue rent, to buy textbooks etc. They hit upon the idea of stealing kidneys for a transplant racket, which they discover is operating at their hospital, but they find that other unscrupulous individuals resent their entry into this shady market. The subject of stealing people’s organs seems very dark, but the boys justify it to themselves by saying that the ‘donors’ can live with one kidney, but the stolen kidney will save another life. Plus all of the ‘donors’ are either dead already or are selfish sh*ts who did the boys wrong. One of the ‘donors’ even recovers to the point that he comes to beat the boys up a few days later. Matt Day and Irish actor Jason Barry are both so likeable as the enterprising students that their crimes seem almost forgivable. And compared to the gangsters who work for their loanshark, or the violent ambulance drivers who resent the boys moving into their turf, the boys seem like angels. It’s funny, fast-moving and most of the victims had it coming really, but it may be a bit bloody for some viewers. (See here for more on this film)\n\n81. Struck by Lightning (1990) (Jerzy Domaradzki)\n\nA volatile young Italian-Australian PE teacher is hired by the alcoholic manager of Saltmarsh, a sheltered workshop for Downs Syndrome young people, and tries to form a football team. This is a film with its heart in the right place and there are both funny and touching moments in this film about misfits – as both the trainees and the workers at the centre are seen as misfits by society and employers respectively. Garry McDonald is excellent as the harried manager of Saltmarsh, who tries to keep the centre going despite funding problems. Brian Vriends is energetic and likeable as PE teacher Pat Cannizzarro, who has a genuine rapour with the trainees, but his performance sometimes becomes too manic. Catherine McClements is as charming as ever, playing the social worker who is attracted to Pat, but has to learn to truly love the trainees. And dozen or so actors with Downs Syndrome do a great job as well. It’s a very charming moving, and mostly a lot of fun, but it also gets a bit silly at times. (See here for more information)\n\n82. A Savage Christmas (2023) (Madeleine Dyer)\n\nA Savage Christmas is another very funny Christmas farce about families and the way past grievances arise at Christmas. It is a bit like Crackers for the 2020s. Brenda and Jim Savage host their traditional Christmas lunch for their three children, Davina (who used to be David), Jimmy Jnr, and Leia, but things do not go as planned. Uncle Dick and Davina’s trans boyfriend, Kane, also attend, and then loan shark Peter turns up to collect a debt, as the family argue about the past. Brenda (Helen Thomson) is at the centre of the film, wanting everyone to get along, even though Jimmy is having trouble with drugs and gambling as well as the associated debts, and Leia’s marriage is in trouble, and neither of them want their parents to know. Only Davina is doing well as a TV cook but resents her parents idealising her miserable childhood when she was a boy. Kane and Uncle Dick are somewhat removed from these family issues, and Dick’s efforts to introduce some traditional Christmas cheer into the lunch with his costume, snow machine and carols are among the film’s funniest moments. It’s a lot of fun overall in fact. (For more information, see here. This film is currently at cinemas and also available on Binge. See Trailer.)\n\n83. Love in Limbo (1993) (David Elfick)\n\nKen, an artistic and sexually inquisitive 16-year-old virgin, gets thrown out of school for selling his drawings of naked women to other students. He starts working at his uncle’s clothing warehouse, where his new workmates help him explore the world of women. This is a well-made teen coming-of-age comedy set in the innocent 1950s in Perth of all places. It has a fine cast, with Rhondda Findleton excelling as Ken’s stylish dress-designing single mum, and Aden Young as Ken’s overbearing mate who gets him into various scrapes, including a trip to Kalgoolie’s famous brothels to try and lose their virginity. Also of interest is a young Russell Crowe playing an uptight Welsh nerd (just prior to his Romper Stomper tour de force). His accent is terrible and he is unrecognizable as the star he would soon become. With the help of lots of American Rock and Roll, and the fab 50s fashions, this is a likeable light comedy, and a look at life in Perth many moons ago. (See here for more information)\n\n84. A Little Bit of Soul (1998) (Peter Duncan)\n\nTwo young scientists, ex-colleagues and ex-lovers, are invited to the country house of a rich woman and her eccentric famous politician husband, to compete for funding for their projects to reverse the aging process. This is a bizarre romp of a film, full of black comedy, satire and slapstick. Of the star-studded cast, Geoffrey Rush is the best as the affable, potty finance minister with a big secret he hides from the public, behind his Boris Johnsonesque joviality and soundbites. Heather Mitchell is also wonderful as the amorous rich hostess, out for a good time, but looking to contribute to a scientific breakthrough that might stop her wrinkles. Frances O’Connor and David Wenham have the straight roles as the young scientists and pale a bit in comparison to the other two, like Brad and Janet at the house of Dr Frank N Furter. Some people found it all a bit too much, but I really liked it. This was Peter Duncan’s second film, after the equally weird Children of the Revolution, and before his television tour de force Rake. (See here for more information)\n\n85. Barry McKenzie Holds His Own (1974) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nThe film is a sequel to The Adventures of Barry McKenzie, which was a surprise hit in Australia and England in 1972, and concerns the return of the young Australian ingénue, Barry McKenzie, to Europe with his Auntie Edna (played by comedian and impersonator Barry Humphreys). Briefly, on a visit to Paris, Auntie Edna is kidnapped by two communist, vampiric agents of Count Plasma (Donald Pleasence) (a Dracula-type Minister of Culture from the People’s Republic of Transylvania), who mistakes her for the Queen of England. Barry and his hated identical twin brother, Reverend Kevin McKenzie, enlist the help of the Australian High Commissioner to London, and a bunch of Aussie drinking mates to storm the Count’s castle in Transylvania and save Edna from the Count’s royal blood-sucking machine, the Auto-Vamp. It’s very 70s humour, like a British carry-on film, relying on continuous action, silly names, funny seventies clothes, mini-skirts and tight blouses, stereotypes for all nationalities, young women dying to get naked and have sex with unattractive men and a few gags thrown in. But the language jokes are original, the several songs that punctuate the film are not too horrible, the story keeps moving at a cracking pace with reasonable internal consistency, and Barry Humphreys is a genuinely funny man, even if many of the jokes are racist or sexist and would now be considered politically correct (See here for more information)\n\n86. As Time Goes By (1988) (Barry Peak)\n\nA surfer heads into the desert looking for his father, but meets an array of other odd characters, the friendliest of whom are a hot young cowgirl and an alien. Though the script is somewhat weird, this quirky outback sci-fi caper comedy is full of interesting ideas and good performances by a variety of Antipodean actors: Nique Needles anchors the film as Mike, the surfer dude out of water, whom all the other characters try to manipulate; Bruno Lawrence plays a taciturn cop trying to reign in local land-grabbers and sheep-killers, but harbouring a tragic secret; Max Gillies plays a talkative alien who channels old Hollywood film dialogue and offers Mike a chance to fix his past with time-travel; Ray Barrett has a sinister charm as an avaricious landowner; Marcelle Schmitz is a rancher who offers Mike her bed; and there are many other oddballs with odd agendas. It’s quite a hoot, even if it is a bit on the silly side. (See here for more information)\n\n87. Let’s Get Skase (2001) (Matthew George)\n\nA group of amateurs hatch a plan to kidnap fugitive disgraced businessman, Christopher Skase, and bring him back to Australia to face justice. This is a fantasy crime-caper comedy, set around real events from the 1990s – that is the 10-year attempt by the Australian authorities and victims of disgraced businessman, Christopher Skase, to bring him back to Australia for justice. The film, about a bunch of nobodies formed into a crack gang of heisters by con-man Peter Dellasandro (Lachy Hulme), moves along at cracking pace from one unlikely situation to another, tossing jokes and satire around like rice at a wedding. The talented cast includes Alex Dimitriades as a hothead offsider, Craig McLachlan as a rival, and Bill Kerr as a mercenary. Whereas most caper movies run out of steam in the second half, this one keeps you with it until the chaotic climax. (See here for more on this film)\n\n88. Griff the Invisible (2010) (Leon Ford)\n\nGriff (Ryan Kwanten) thinks he’s a superhero who protects the neighbourhood from villains. His brother Tim (Patrick Brammall) thinks he’s deluded, but Melody (Maeve Dermody) believes him and is drawn to him as a fellow oddball. This is an enjoyable rom-com about two oddballs who don’t fit into regular society, but are odd enough to appreciate each other. The actors are good, and the film has some good moments, but some may find the two main characters, whose awkwardness and vulnerability help you like them, are a bit too weird and deluded to totally sympathise with. (See here for more information)\n\n89. Kath and Kimderella (2012) (Ted Emery)\n\nKath wins a trip to the Italy, to the Kingdom of Papilloma, and takes Kim and Sharon along. They meet King Javier who tries to seduce Kath, believe she is a rich woman; meanwhile his mask-wearing son tries to marry Kim, whom he believes is a princess. This spin-off film from the popular television show Kath and Kim is likely to please mainly fans of that show. Though this bogan Cinderella story is fairly formulaic, the film is full of the sight gags and satirical malapropisms that characterise the television series. It is particularly pleasing that Jude and Trude, the upper-class ladies (also played by Jane Turner and Gina Riley) happen to be holidaying in Italy at the same time, giving us the benefit of all their rhyming pretensions. Overall, the film is better than might have been expected from a spinoff, and certainly as good as Turner and Riley’s previous effort, The Kath and Kim Code. (See here for more information)\n\n90. Welcome to Woop Woop (1997) (Stephan Elliott )\n\nAn American huckster flees New York after a scam goes wrong and ends up as the kidnapped groom of a sex-crazy girl in a strange outback community populated by weird Ocker throwbacks. It’s a strange world, surrounded by barren desert, and ruled over by his new bride’s father, the demented Daddy-O, who plays Rodgers & Hammerstein tunes continuously.This film was a followup to Elliot’s outrageous hit The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, and tries to shine a spotlight on some of the weirder aspects of Australian life. It’s a very black comedy, highlighting the Ugly Australian aspect of our culture, in a similar way to The Adventures of Barry McKenzie twenty-five years earlier. Elliot’s humour works on the other side of the good-taste line and people will either love or hate this film, but if you like your comedy raw and dirty, this is one for you. (See here for more information)\n\n91. Stork (1971) (Tim Burstall)\n\nGraham ‘Stork’ Wallace is an anarchic young man raging against society in early 1970s Melbourne. He gets sacked from his job and moves in with some mates who share a girlfriend. This is an amusing and often rude look at Melbourne in the early 70s through the character of the rebelliously outspoken Stork, who wants to bring down the system, drop out, and turn on, but really would most love to lose his virginity with one of the many attractive girls in mini-skirts who give him a wide berth. Stork is full of intellectual ideas about Marxism, Marcuese and the corruption of contemporary society, but spends his time drinking beer, embarrassing his friends and haranguing people with jobs. Some of the humour is of its era and Stork, played by the two-metre tall, rake thin Bruce Spence, has a casual sexism (calling Jacki Weaver ‘mole’ throughout the film) that offends even his university-educated housemates. Spence is ably assisted by Jacki Weaver, as Anna his polyamorous housemate, and Graeme Blundell as Westie, his best mate. The film is dated but still interesting. Stork was adapted from a successful 1970 play by David Williamson, and is most notable for being the first film of the 1970 Australian film industry revival to make a big profit, and demonstrate that Australian audiences would come see an Australian film if it was entertaining. This, of course, encouraged Tim Burstall and Bruce Beresford to make similarly entertaining and financially-successful films about Australian non-conformists (Alvin Purple, Barry McKenzie, Petersen etc). (See here for more information)\n\n92. Fat Pizza (2003) (Paul Fenech)\n\nThis is a full-speed politically incorrect comedy, about four broke young pizza delivery blokes (Maltese Pauly, Lebanese Sleek and Habib, and Anglo stoner Davo) who go in search of sex, drugs, money and fun, while occasionally managing to deliver a pizza or two. Meanwhile the tyrannical and homicidal Italian virgin pizza cook Bobo, awaits his Vietnamese mail-order bride to arrive on a small illegal boat. The action is quick, with multiple story lines involving each of the characters misadventures, and includes constant insults and violence, albeit very slapstick, towards almost every ethnic and social group in Australia. The film is a spin-off from a successful SBS TV series and is in a similar vein to the series. It presents a vision of the multicultural working class not seen elsewhere. It’s sexist, homophobic and full of vulgar humour, racial stereotypes and ethnic slurs, so be warned, but both the film and the TV show gained a large audience. Even the critics managed to get past the film’s offensiveness and enjoy the humour. (See here for more information)\n\n93. The Wog Boy (2000) (Aleksi Vellis )\n\nSteve (Nick Giannopoulos) is a first-generation Greek Australian, living in a Greek enclave in Melbourne (‘the largest Greek city outside Greece’ allegedly). He tries to find the meaning of life through his mates, hot cars, Anglo girls and his mum’s moussaka. When he gets labelled as Australia’s worst dole bludger by a TV host, he has to make some changes to restore some pride to Australia’s ‘wogs’. Nick Giannopoulos was one of the originators of the 1980s and 90s ‘wog humour’ movement, where descendants of the post-war southern European migrants tried to reclaim the insulting term ‘wog’ as a term of pride. Through TV shows like the popular Acropolis Now and theatre such as Wogs Out of Work, Greek-Australian and Italian-Australian comedians reflected the Australian ethnic communities’ concerns and peculiarities in a vivid and entertaining manner. This film attempts to capture the humour of this movement, and appealed mainly to fans of the original shows and others familiar with the Greek-Australian subculture, but not everyone is a fan. (See here for more information)\n\n94. Goddess (2013) (Mark Lamprell)\n\nElspeth Dickens has put her singing ambitions on hold to be a stay-at-home mum of two exuberant boys, while husband James is off saving the whales. To overcome the isolation, she uses the webcam her husband installed to sing her funny songs over the internet from her kitchen. In time, she gains an audience and satisfaction. But an approach by an advertising executive to become a figurehead for the “Goddess” campaign, leaving her with big decisions about her future and her marriage. This is an enjoyable Australian fantasy full of fantasy and colour, but with some serious issues beneath. (See here for more on this film)\n\n95. The Craic (1999) (Ted Emery)\n\nTwo young Irishmen, Fergus and Wesley, flee to Australia to escape Colin, a local thug in Belfast, but Colin turns police informer and is sent to Australia under police protection. The boys try to fit into Australia but find the locals puzzling. This is an amiable, though sometimes aimless, road movie by popular Irish comic Jimeoin, who has made his home in Australia. The story moves towards an interesting climax at an outback pub, but Jimeoin has put too few verbal and physical jokes into his film to make it into a classic film. The film ticks all the boxes for the foreign tourist in Australia – surf, kangaroos, pubs, big things, snakes, Aboriginal people etc, but doesn’t add much new. The Australian public nevert"
