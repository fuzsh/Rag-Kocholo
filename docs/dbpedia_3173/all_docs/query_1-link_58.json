        "text": "Movies based around the college theme — sports or academics, comedies or dramas — have always been popular. Here is our ranking of the 25 best college movies of all time.\n\n1 of 25\n\n25. 'National Lampoon's Van Wilder' (2002)\n\nArtisan Entertainment\n\nCoolidge College is such a fun place that \"Van\" Wilder (Ryan Reynolds) has been there for seven years. The goofball has a good heart and offers his fellow undergrad students some useful knowledge. While critics were lukewarm on the movie, it spawned two less popular films in the series — a sequel and a straight-to-video prequel.\n\n2 of 25\n\n24. 'Sydney White' (2007)\n\nUniversal Studios\n\nThis one probably flew under many radars but enjoyed some popularity thanks to cable television. Amanda Bynes stars as Sydney, a tomboyish freshman at the fictitious SAU. She has a run-in with sorority queen bee Rachel (Sara Paxton) and befriends a group of seven geeky classmates, who help her get some revenge and generate her own popularity — for the better.\n\n3 of 25\n\n23. 'The Waterboy' (1998)\n\nTouchstone Pictures\n\nThis is one of Adam Sandler's most memorable characters. He stars as Bobby Boucher, a socially-challenged, slow-witted adult waterboy for the dysfunctionally pathetic University of Louisiana football team. Bobby eventually takes his pent-up rage from being bullied throughout his life out on the team's quarterback with a vicious hit. He enrolls in college, joins the team, and helps turn the program's fortunes around.\n\n4 of 25\n\n22. 'The Program' (1993)\n\nTouchstone Pictures\n\nA favorite with college football fans. This James Caan vehicle explored the dark side of the sport. Steroids, cheating, emotional and mental distress — all the effects of the win-at-all-costs program at powerhouse ESU. The film was not without controversy. A lying-in-the-middle-of-the-road traffic scene was deleted from showings shortly after release.\n\n5 of 25\n\n21. 'Necessary Roughness' (1991)\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nThis is just a fun movie. Scott Bakula stars as a 30-something farmer recruited to fulfill his once-lost college football dreams at former powerhouse Texas State, which must rebuild with a group of misfits lacking talent following severe violations to the program. Stars of the 1980s and '90s like Sinbad and Kathy Ireland deliver solid performances that even football fans can appreciate.\n\n6 of 25\n\n20. 'The Rules of Attraction' (2002)\n\nLions Gate Films; Concorde Filmverleih\n\nBased on another of Bret Easton Ellis' great novels. There's plenty of heat and steamy intrigue at Camden College, especially when it comes to drug-dealing Sean (James van der Beek), virgin Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon), and the bisexual Paul (Ian Somerhalder).\n\n7 of 25\n\n19. 'With Honors' (1994)\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nThe first of several films on this list with Harvard University as its setting. A group of good-looking classmates — Brendan Fraser, Patrick Dempsey, Moira Kelly, and Josh Hamilton — befriend a homeless man (Joe Pesci), who forms a true bond with Monty (Fraser). It's a good-hearted film about friendship, purpose, and regret. The themes are typical of 1990s comedy dramas but not time wasted.\n\n8 of 25\n\n18. 'Higher Learning' (1995)\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\nThe late John Singleton had quite the cast to work with (Omar Epps, Tyra Banks, Michael Rapaport, Ice Cube, Jennifer Connelly, Kristy Swanson, Regina King, Laurence Fishburne) for this college drama. With fictional Columbus University as the setting, the film follows three incoming freshmen: track star Malik (Epps), wholesome and shy Kristen (Swanson), and confused Remy (Rapaport). While not as strong as Singleton's classic Boyz n the Hood, Higher Learning has the right amount of dramatic intensity to satisfy.\n\n9 of 25\n\n17. 'Blue Chips' (1994)\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nPete Bell (Nick Nolte) is one of the best college basketball coaches in the country. However, his Western University Dolphins just endured the worst season of Bell's tenure. How does he improve the program? Well, by doing something he never thought he'd stoop as low to do. Nolte is solid in this Bobby Knight-esque role, while former NBA stars Shaquille O'Neal and \"Penny\" Hardaway also shine.\n\n10 of 25\n\n16. 'School Daze' (1988)\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\nStarring Laurence Fishburne and Tisha Campbell, this is one Spike Lee film that might not get the credit it deserves. This musical comedy and drama follows fraternity and sorority life at the historically Black Mission College. Like every other Lee film, there are plenty of messages regarding social, political, and conformist platforms.\n\n11 of 25\n\n15. 'Everybody Wants Some!!' (2016)\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nAn underrated gem from Richard Linklater. One thing we know of the talented director is that he likes sports and music in his storylines. Set in the fall of 1980, there is plenty of late 1970s and early '80s rock (Cheap Trick), pop (Blondie), and punk (Stiff Little Fingers) to help tell the story of a group of college baseball players navigating their way through the game, school, and love and lust.\n\n12 of 25\n\n14. 'Back to School' (1986)\n\nOrion Pictures\n\nRodney Dangerfield was a mega-star during the 1980s, and Back to School was one of his better films. Though not nearly as hilarious as Caddyshack and Easy Money, there are plenty of laughs when millionaire clothing-store mogul Thornton Melon (Dangerfield) attends college with his son at Grand Lakes University. The movie also influenced kids to attempt a \"Triple Lindy\" at their local public swimming pools.\n\n13 of 25\n\n13. 'Drumline' (2002)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nThe movie that turned Nick Cannon and Zoe Saldana into big-time stars. Being part of the marching band, especially the drumline, at fictional Atlanta A&T is a big deal. Of course, Devon (Cannon) learns the hard way what it takes to stay on the \"line.\" A sequel followed but was no comparison to the movie that takes a well-detailed look into how much marching bands make up the experience at historically Black colleges.\n\n14 of 25\n\n12. 'Glory Road' (2006)\n\nWalt Disney Pictures\n\nJosh Lucas stars as legendary college basketball coach Don Haskins. In 1966, Haskins guided Texas Western University (now known as the University of Texas at El Paso or UTEP) to the national championship with a starting lineup featuring five Black players. That was a rarity at the time. How those players dealt with college life off the court added emotion and intensity to the story.\n\n15 of 25\n\n11. 'Monsters University' (2013)\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures\n\nThis is the prequel to the 2001 hit Monsters, Inc. Monsters University follows the hilariously volatile Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal) to college, where he's majoring in Scare and meets eventual co-worker and best buddy \"Sully\" (John Goodman) to begin their adventurous friendship. The film made more than $740 million and held up just as well as the first film.\n\n16 of 25\n\n10. 'Pitch Perfect' (2012)\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nThere are three films in the Pitch Perfect franchise, but the first installment remains the best. The wonder of a capella greatness at Barden University is fun, thanks in part to stellar performers from versatile stars Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Skylar Astin, and Ben Platt. The rivalry between the Barden Bellas and The Treblemakers is fierce and highly entertaining.\n\n17 of 25\n\n9. 'Real Genius' (1985)\n\nSony Pictures; Columbia Pictures; TriStar Pictures\n\nVal Kilmer stars as a carefree undergrad genius from Pacific Technical University. Along with wunderkind Mitch (Gabriel Jarrett), he's roped into working on a laser project for a greedy professor. There's more to the project, but before getting the final say on the matter, Chris and Mitch have some fun that most smart college kids would envy.\n\n18 of 25\n\n8. 'Legally Blonde' (2001)\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nReese Witherspoon has played some memorable roles during her career and has an Oscar to prove it. However, one of her most memorable roles is Elle Woods, the former undergrad sorority diva who manages to gain acceptance into Harvard's prestigious law school. It's rough at first, but Elle pulls through enough to not only graduate with honors but earn a sequel. Legally Blonde 3 is expected in 2023.\n\n19 of 25\n\n7. 'Good Will Hunting' (1997)\n\nMiramax Films\n\nHarvard (again) and MIT are at the forefront of the movie that made Matt Damon and Ben Affleck household names. A delinquent slacker and mathematical genius (Damon) works as a janitor at the most prestigious technical school in the world. He falls in love with a Harvard beauty (Minnie Driver). He also gets drunk, fights with his Southie buddies, and learns about life from a shrink (Robin Williams). It's one of the most re-watchable movies.\n\n20 of 25\n\n6. 'The Social Network' (2010)\n\nSony Pictures; Columbia Pictures\n\nAaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay, and David Fincher directed this critically acclaimed film about Mark Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook while at Harvard. Jesse Eisenberg earned an Oscar nomination for his starring role, while Armie Hammer, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, and Rooney Mara are all impactful in supporting the cause. It's kind of easy to see why Zuckerberg takes a lot of heat, even today.\n\n21 of 25\n\n5. 'Mona Lisa Smile' (2003)\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\nJulia Roberts reportedly got paid $25 million to play Katherine Ann Watson, a graduate student who shapes the minds and hearts of young women while teaching art history at Wellesley College. Katherine's teaching methods are somewhat unorthodox, but she offers her students a new approach to critical thinking while instilling a sense of empowerment. Julia Stiles, Kirsten Dunst, and Maggie Gyllenhaal also deliver quality performances.\n\n22 of 25\n\n4. 'Old School' (2003)\n\nDreamworks Pictures\n\nTodd Phillips' movies are not for everyone, but Old School delivers. Adults starting their own fraternity that ultimately draws students to a house just off the campus of the fictional Harrison University? That proved to be comedy gold, thanks largely to Will Ferrell's Frank \"The Tank.\" Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson also put forth memorable performances, but Ferrell is the undisputed star of this film.\n\n23 of 25\n\n3. 'Revenge of the Nerds' (1984)\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nIn the 1980s, there was no finer college comedy than the one that unfolded at Adams College. A group of underdog geeks, led by computer nerds Lewis (Robert Carradine) and Gilbert (Anthony Edwards), band together to not form their own fraternity and take down all those jocks and face men. Not to mention that highly entertaining talent show performance.\n\n24 of 25\n\n2.
