        "text": "Ask the average person to list some movie themes, and they might respond with only a confused look.\n\nBut start to name a few movie themes, and they’ll likely be quick to smile or nod in agreement. Why’s that? Because while movie themes are inherent to why people love cinema, few individuals outside the film industry tend to think about them.\n\nMovie themes are typically universal concepts or life experiences that most people can relate to or have gone through themselves1.\n\nAnd as the examples below demonstrate, it’s also why films with strong thematic material often do so well and stand the test of time even decades after they’re made. At the same time, this universal aspect of life often makes movie themes part of the storytelling process that slips under the radar of many movie lovers—kind of like asking a fish to be conscious of the water it lives in.\n\nThe following breaks down some of the most popular movie themes and why so many filmgoers are drawn to them. And for all those filmmakers thinking about their first or next project, an exploration of movie themes is a great place to begin for finding a story that can resonate with millions of others.\n\nComing of Age\n\nAs mentioned, most movie themes encompass universal experiences. And few experiences are more universal than that of growing up with all the awkward, angsty, and otherwise awful events and emotions that go along with it.\n\nNo matter where a person lives, what their obstacles are, or how they deal with them, the coming-of-age story2 is one that many people can relate to. But as with many movie themes, the coming of age story can be told in a variety of ways, such as through humor, drama, flashback, ensemble or a single protagonist’s point of view.\n\nRebel Without a Cause (1955) is one of the earliest on-screen examples of how challenging it can be to go through adolescence.\n\nWriter Shayne Anderson discusses the role that this theme played in his work: “When writing my script, I was aware of a theme. It was apparent early on the story I wanted to tell revolved around a family. Not only a biological one but a family at the school. Friendship as family.”\n\nOther examples: The Outsiders (1983), The Breakfast Club (1985), Stand By Me (1986), Boyz in the Hood (1991), Superbad (2007), Lady Bird (2017).\n\nWhat are examples of themes?\n\nAnna Keizer (CareersInFilm)\n\nMovie themes encompass the whole of the human experience. They tend to reflect universal happenings like falling in love, coming of age, or dying. Other common movie themes include good versus evil, determination, humanity versus artificial intelligence/technology, familial conflict, and sacrifice for the greater good.\n\nWhat are some powerful themes?\n\nAnna Keizer (CareersInFilm)\n\nIf a film is done well, nearly any theme can resonate strongly with audiences. That being said, often it’s the themes with the greatest universal appeal, such as love, parenthood, and death that most profoundly impact viewers.\n\nDangers of Technology\n\nSometimes movie themes can represent not necessarily what we experience in life but what we fear, particularly when it means losing control to someone—or something—else. Hence, films about the dangers of technology.\n\nJurassic Park (1993) offers a memorable look at how catastrophic it can be to use modern-day science to bring back life from millions of years ago.\n\nParticularly over the last 40 years, this type of film has been a constant on the screen. In many cases, they play not only with the idea of technology taken too far but also biological and medical advances gone awry that may potentially mean doom for a country, a continent or even all of humanity.\n\nParticularly over the last 40 years, this type of film has been a constant on the screen. In many cases, they play with biological and medical advances gone awry that may mean doom for a country, a continent, or even all of humanity.\n\nOther examples: The Terminator (1984), Gattaca (1997), The Matrix (1999), Minority Report (2002), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Inception (2010).\n\nWhat is the most popular movie theme?\n\nAnna Keizer (CareersInFilm)\n\nOver the 100-year history of cinema, numerous themes have been showcased and pondered in the stories told on screen. It’s difficult to determine which of those are the most popular, but often many themes – even when they most overtly dive into issues like good versus evil or sacrifice for the greater good – circle back to some dynamic of love."
