        "meta_description": "A list of 13 films compiled on Letterboxd, including Duel (1971), Trafic (1971), Le Mans (1971), The Last Run (1971) and Fear Is the Key (1972). About this list: America’s love affair with the automobile hit a peak in the 1970s, and so did Hollywood’s. While cars had long been synonymous with freedom and escape, they took on a new centrality in the decade’s popular cinema. Whether an expression of character, a tricked-out fetish object, or the literal vehicle on the road to enlightenment, the car was a powerful symbol of an age of individuality and personal liberation. Featuring ambling road trips (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot) and high-octane chases (Gone in 60 Seconds), souped-up Chevys (Dirty Mary Crazy Larry) and customized Cadillacs (Super Fly), these cinematic joyrides capture the “it’s the journey, not the destination” spirit of the times.
