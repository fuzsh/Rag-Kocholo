        "text": "THE PANIC IN NEEDLE PARK\n\nDrama, 1971, USA, R, * * * 1/2\n\nAl Pacino, Kitty Winn, Alan Vint, Richard Bright. Directed by Jerry Schatzberg. 110 min.\n\nThis film probes the needle subculture of New York City -- where love and betrayal, harrowing humor, and tragedy pivot on a pinpoint. Director Jerry Schatzberg and Al Pacino (in his first starring role) have tapped veins of both irony and pathos, but the subplot in which Pacino pulls the upscale Kitty Winn into the sordid depths injects the plot with real tragedy. Scripted by \"New Journalists\" Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne, and scored with scathing street sounds instead of music, Panic has a startling near-documentary buzz.

Directed by James Bridges. 111 min.\n\nAmong college students and uncertain pre-professionals, this engaging comedy-drama tells of a first-year law student in an intellectual wrangle with a brilliant, imperious professor (John Houseman) and a romantic one with his daughter (Lindsay Wagner). Director James Bridges, shooting at Harvard and in Canada, perfectly captures the imposing, scary architectural grandeur of an Ivy League college, and Timothy Bottoms is fine as the scholar unwittingly caught in a war of wills. The script, however, has scenes of pomposity and ineptitude, and the tone of much of the film, especially the ending, is pure 1970s disillusionment-is-so-romantic drivel. But the ecclesiastical atmosphere of a law school is splendidly conveyed, and Houseman, who won an Academy Award for this film, brilliantly distills every student's greatest fears into one unforgettable characterization. The film later became an acclaimed television series that ran, first on network, then on cable, for several years.

Directed by Peter Bogdanovich. 101 min.\n\nA Depression America that is alternately homey and hard-bitten is brilliantly evoked in Peter Bogdanovich's sentimental movie about an odd-couple team of con artists. Tatum O'Neal is very good as the orphan who latches onto the small-time flimflam man played by her father. Their comic backchat is funny, though their relationship doesn't change much over the course of the movie. Madeline Kahn almost steals the show as a has-been floozie, and P.J. Johnson holds her own playing a put-upon maid. The movie is really a series of comic vignettes, and it lacks the focus of its source novel, Addie Pray by Joe David Brown. On the whole, however, the movie's machinery clicks along nicely. The combination of Laszlo Kovack's sharp black-and-white photography and contemporary music like \"Keep Your Sunny Side Up\" and \"Let's Have Another Cup of Coffee\" generates an authentic feel.

Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. 150 min.\n\nPopular, engrossing but overlong film based on the memoirs of Henri Charriere, who escaped from the infamous penal colony of Devil's Island after eight attempts. Much of the film's time is spent detailing the horrors of prison life, and, without becoming overtly sadistic or horrifying, it is a numbing experience. Steve McQueen is very good in a more restrained role than usual; Dustin Hoffman is likewise good as a counterfeiter also sentenced to the prison, a variation on his Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy. The film should have been at least twenty minutes shorter, though. However, it has a screenplay by Lorenzo Semple, Jr., and Dalton Trumbo, who has a bit part at the beginning of the film as the prison commandant.

Pakula. 102 min.\n\nConspiracy buffs will enjoy this Watergate-era thriller about a journalist who becomes the last surviving witness of a political assasination. His investigation leads him to a truth that's far worse than his nightmares. Alan J. Pakula has crafted a generally fine suspense film, blending everything from a fictionalized Warren Commission to a Satanic CIA into a heady brew of perceptive paranoia. It's marred only by a disappointing (although logical) conclusion.

Both Billy and Garrett are tarnished by life, or rather the love-and-death chain that links them. That this kind of romantic and repressive masculine love should be expressed in images redolent of the grave seems entirely accurate. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is a whole necrology of the West. It's brilliant in parts, so allow the rest to slide by...not dificult given Bob Dylan's soundtrack. Buy the DVD/Blu-ray/VHS at Amazon.com.\n\nPATTON\n\nDrama, 1970, USA, GP, * * * *\n\nGeorge C. Scott, Karl Malden, Michael Bates, Karl Michael Volger, Edward Bines, Tim Considine. Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner. 173 min.\n\nSubtitled \"Salute to a Rebel,\" this film about one of World War II's most notorious hawks was a risky venture at a time when America was torn apart over the issue of its involvement in Vietnam; that the film was a major hit testifies to its objective treatment of General George S. Patton, a man who had his own ideas about how wars should be fought regardless of what his superiors thought. George C. Scott gives an astounding performance, both hero and lunatic at the same time. Director Franklin J. Schaffner achieves the equally amazing feat of not letting Scott overwhelm the rest of the film, with brilliantly panoramic re-creations of some of the major battles of the war. Both star and director won Oscars (although Scott declined to accept his); the film also won awards for Best Picture, screenplay (Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North), sound, editing, and set direction. A made-for-TV sequel, The Last Days of Patton aired in 1986.

Directed by Donald Cammell and Nicholas Roeg. 106 min.\n\nIn any objective sense, Performance is not really a very good film, and those who are easily aroused to moral indignation by the decadence of our time would be well-advised to stay away (as would those who are easily bored). But for the more jaded and/or indulgent, this does have a perverse, creepy fascination; even when it's being quite vile, it is more viscerally vile than almost any other film. The bare-bones plot has James Fox as a gangster hiding out from his ex-cronies in a house owned by retired rock star Mick Jagger. The two personalities begin to merge, the macho gangster experimenting with drugs and perversity and the singer discovering violence and cruelty. Jagger is not a very good actor, though he was called on only to pose here, and he sings only one good song, the striking \"Memo from Turner.\" The film is loaded with every arty trick that the two first-time directors could think of, generally to no solid effect. Don't be misled by the X rating; were this to be released nowadays, they'd probably have to spice it up a bit to be insured an R.

Directed by Brian De Palma. 92 min.\n\nAn effective rock version of Phantom of the Opera, with William Finley out for revenge against a producer (Paul Williams, miscast but not bad) who stole his songs. A flop in its time -- it was sold as a spoof -- but now finding a cult; ironically, many of the \"weird\" rock performers (including Gerrit Graham as \"Beef\") seem pretty tame alongside some of today's artists. Williams also composed the score, and Sissy Spacek was the set decorator!

Directed by Blake Edwards. 103 min.\n\nThe fifth Pink Panther is one of the funniest. Sellers' former boss (Lom) goes crazy and threatens to destroy the world with a ray-gun he has commandeered. Sellers' hilarious Inspector Clouseau is backed up by better-than-usual gags -- with the usual number of pain-and-destruction jokes thrown in for good measure. Sequels: Revenge of the Pink Panther, Trail of the Pink Panther (1982), Curse of the Pink Panther (1983) and Son of the Pink Panther (1993). Buy the DVD/Blu-ray/VHS at Amazon.com.\n\nPLAY IT AGAIN, SAM\n\nComedy, 1972, USA, PG, * * * 1/2\n\nWoody Allen, Diane Keaton, Tony Roberts, Jerry Lacy, Susan Anspach, Jennifer Salt, Joy Bang. Directed by Herbert Ross. 87 min.\n\nWoody Allen adapted this film's screenplay from his hit Broadway show and enlisted Herbert Ross to direct. The result is funny, sweet, and touching, if less maniacally original than some of the films Allen himself has directed. Allen stars as a lovably neurotic movie buff with a Humphrey Bogart fixation. Following Bogie's example, he finds himself in love with his best friend's wife, played irresistibly by Diane Keaton, and their romance culminates in his dream come true -- replaying the parting scene from Casablanca. The ghost of Bogart materializes in Allen's fantasies: \"Dames are simple,\" Bogart advises. \"I've never known one that didn't understand a slap in the mouth or a slug from a .45.\" An early exploration by Allen of the relationship between cinema and \"reality,\" issues he would later treat more profoundly in Zelig and The Purple Rose of Cairo.

Directed by Clint Eastwood. 95 min.\n\nClint Eastwood's directoral debut was this searing thriller about a disc jockey who gets involved with a psychotic fan. Eastwood's use of crosscutting and camera movement to create Hitchockian suspense is surprisingly effective, and Jessica Walter's performance as a jealous, obsessive woman is chillingly realistic. Eastwood would later return to themes of sexual paranoia in Richard Tuggle's Tightrope and his own Dirty Harry epic Sudden Impact. He obviously owes much of his success in this first (and so far best) film, however, to old master Don Siegel (Dirty Harry, The Beguiled), who plays a small role as a bartender. The ending is a cop-out and the Eastwood-Donna Mills romance is conventional, but the film has a compulsive pulp quality that makes it hard not to watch.

Directed by Ernest Lehman. 101 min.\n\nOnce again, Hollywood proves that some books just should not be brought to the big screen. Philip Roth's novel was a brilliantly sustained monologue, in the form of a repressed Jewish man's psychotherapy sessions, that gained notoriety for its Rabelaisian sexual candor, and more precisely, for its hilariously true rendition of masturbatory practices of the American male. The film, however, hardly even tries to incorporate the humanity of Roth's writing, turning it instead into a long Jewish sex joke couched in a ridiculously unlikely unromantic setting (never has a Michael LeGrand score been so inappropriate) to make it \"less offensive.\" If you aren't familiar with the novel, or if you can manage not to compare it with the film, you can at least enjoy good performances by Richard Benjamin, and, more especially, Karen Black, although almost the entire remaining cast probably would like to forget their work here.

Directed by Ronald Neame. 117 min.\n\nThis is the first entry in the 1970s' cycle of \"disaster\" films, and the best by miles. When a luxury liner capsizes beneath a tidal wave, an all-star cast led by rugged priest Gene Hackman must undertake a thrillingly perilous journey to the bottom -- now the top -- of the ship. Although much of the initial exposition is inevitably clumsy, once the wall of water hits, it's action all the way. All of the actors give juicy, caricatured performances, but our favorite is Shelley Winters as the corpulent Jewish mama who insists against all reason that she can undertake a dangerous swim -- she won an Oscar nomination. The movie was produced by Irwin Allen, the real auteur of this genre, who directed some of the action sequences here, and who went on to the spectacles, The Towering Inferno (1974), The Swarm (1978), and the terrible sequel Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979).

Directed by Louis Malle. 109 min.\n\nLouis Malle's portrait of a twelve-year-old girl who becomes a prostitute in New Orleans' notorious Storyville is not pornographic -- nor is it particularly engrossing. Though perfectly cast, Brooke Shields remains a very childish twelve-year-old and we never understand why Keith Carradine, pointlessly unappealing as the photographer E.J. Bellocq, falls in love with her. It's a strangely inert movie, though it was photographed by Sven Nykvist and looks absolutely sumptuous.

Directed by Michael Ritchie. 86 min.\n\nA violent gangster story, with some vague touches of satire. The front for the mob's operations here is the cattle industry: Kansas boss Gene Hackman uses his stockyards as a cover for a drug and prostitution ring. Feminists will undoubtedly be appalled at the sight of prostitutes being kept in cattle pens, although director Michael Ritchie seems to intend it as a mordant commentary on a woman's role in capitalist society. (His subsequent film, Smile, is a more incisive satire on another side of the same issue, the Great American Beauty Pageant.) One can't help but worry, though, that the intended audience for this film is probably watching it and considering installing a pen of their own. Some of the gorier murders have been obviously cut in the video version.

Directed by Melvin Frank. 99 min.\n\nNeil Simon at his most clamorous. Adapting his grimly funny play about a high-strung executive driven to the edge of a breakdown by the pressures of New York City life, the playwright has turned the city into a headachy conflagraation of noisy garbage trucks, rude neighbors, bad smells, and thin walls. But what could have become a comic study of the Big Apple as a circle of hell is hampered by Melvin Frank's heavy-handed direction and Simon's overreliance on tired, clichéd situations and a rat-a-tat dialogue. As in all of his movies, the fast pace and sharp lines keep it watchable, but everything else about Prisoner is shrill, overemphatic, and familiar.

Directed by Frank Roddam. 120 min.\n\nFrank Roddam's invigorating punk-rebellion film, loosely based on the 1973 album by The Who, depicts the conflicts between Mods and Rockers circa 1964. The story of an angry-but-sensitive Mod (Phil Daniels) who is led by a series of shocks and betrayals to yearn for more fulfillment than gang life can provide, Quadrophenia becomes a nearly universal rites-of-passage saga. What's hard to fathom is how passionate these kids were about poses and trappings that seem distant to us.

Directed by Jack Starrett. 88 min.\n\nAs further proof there are some things that money just can't buy, this major studio (Twentieth Century-Fox) attempts to make the kind of action-horror film that small studios and the independents do with such cheesy panache, and it falls flat on its face. The plot is prime Wes Craven stuff, with some vacationing suburbanites taking their motor home to rural Texas, where they encounter a band of backwoods Satanists engaged in human sacrifices; like Craven, director Jack Starrett (who was from Texas himself and was alleged to have hired real life Satanists as cultist extras) seems to be drawing parallels between middle-class Americans and their sub-societal counterparts. It doesn't try very hard, or very successfully, and it culminates into a hackneyed near-end chase and shootout. Only Warren Oates and Peter Fonda manage to rise above the material. Starrett cameos as a suspicious gas station attendant, and Wes Bishop appears as a suspicious deputy. Filmed in Bandera, Tex., including Arkey Blue's Silver Dollar Saloon where Arkey himself plays his classics \"Livin' on Credit\" and \"Misty Hours of Daylight\" in the background.

Directed by Albert Brooks. 99 min.\n\nPreviously known for his uniquely funny films for the early years of Saturday Night Live, Albert Brooks brings his original brand of humor to the big screen in a hilarous spoof of television's cinéma vérite portraits of \"typical American families.\" In this surprisingly experimental and professional first feature, Brooks cast himself as a documentary filmmaker who will stop at nothing to capture \"real life\" on film. Charles Grodin and Frances Lee McCain are excellent as the hapless couple whose life he invades. Brooks's whining, manic-depressive style of comedy is an acquired taste but once acquired, it will leave you rolling in the aisles with laughter.

Directed by Blake Edwards. 113 min.\n\nThe fourth Pink Panther film, and the first with Sellers since A Shot in the Dark. Inspector Clauseau is a superb comedy character, but director-writer Edwards thinks big, violent gags are funny. The best part of this diamond-heist farce is the opening title, animated by Richard Williams and Ken Harris. The immediate sequel -- The Pink Panther Strikes Again -- is much better. Buy the DVD/Blu-ray/VHS at Amazon.com.\n\nREVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER\n\nComedy, 1978, USA, PG, * * 1/2\n\nPeter Sellers, Robert Webber, Dyan Cannon, Burt Kwouk, Robert Loggia, Paul Stewart, Andre Maranne, Graham Stark, Ferdy Mayne. Directed by Blake Edwards. 99 min.\n\nPeter Sellers' final go-round as bumbling Inspector Clouseau is one of the dullest, until a bright wrap-up in Hong Kong with some good sight gags and plenty of spark from Cannon. The \"plot\" has Clouseau supposedly murdered, allowing him to find the \"killer\" incognito. Followed by Trail of the Pink Panther in 1982.

Avildsen. 119 min.\n\nOne of the film trivia questions in future years may be: What was the only film for which Sylvester Stallone won a Best Screenplay Oscar nomination? At least as of the 1990s, it's Rocky, the sweet boxing fable about a down-and-out Philly slugger who gets one miraculous shot at the champ. If you've never seen it, separate yourself from the deification of the of the title character that occurred in the sequels. You'll find a well-told tale with an outlook at once inspirational and ironic, beautiful performances (not the least of which is Stallone's), and strong, gritty direction by John G. Avildsen that helped make the Best Picture Oscar winner the sleeper hit of the 1970s. Despite the often execrable work that Stallone has done more recently, Rocky still stands as an uplifting winner, with full credit belonging to its creator-star.

Directed by Sylvester Stallone. 119 min.\n\nSylvester Stallone took over directorial chores from John Avildsen for this follow-up to his 1976 smash, with the predictable result being the first appearance of the halo above the title character's head. About the best one can say for Rocky II is that it's a crowd-pleaser, less a sequel than a slick second round to a boxing saga that apparently will never end. (You don't have to be a genius to figure out early that the film ends with a rematch between Rocky and nemesis Apollo Creed.) The film is best in the early scenes, which pick up right where Rocky left off and bring back most of the vigor of the first film's climax. But the odd, charming details and human scope of Rocky are wholly absent here, and Stallone gives his fellow actors offensively short shrift. In light of what followed, one wishes he had left well enough alone. Buy the DVD/Blu-ray/VHS at Amazon.com.\n\nROCK 'N' ROLL HIGH SCHOOL\n\nComedy, 1979, USA, PG, * * * *\n\nP.J. Soles, Mary Woronov, Vince Van Patten, Paul Bartel, The Ramones. Directed by Allan Arkush. 84 min.\n\nPart camp, pure rock & roll, this low-budget 1979 classic featuring iconic New York City punk band The Ramones was produced by legendary cult flick director Roger Corman. The Ramones compensate for their bad acting with their greatest performances caught on film; the opening scene where the entire student body erupts into frantic dancing when the band's \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\" hits the school PA is as inspired as the film's literally explosive ending.

Directed by Jim Sharman. 100 min.\n\nOutrageously kinky horror movie spoof, spiced with sex, transvestism, and rock music, about a straight couple, Janet and Brad, (Sarandon, Bostwick), stranded in an old dark house full of weirdos from Transylvania. Music and lyrics by O'Brien; songs include \"Time Warp,\" \"Dammit Janet,\" and \"Wild Untamed Thing.\" Followed by Shock Treatment (1981).

Directed by Norman Jewison. 123 min.\n\nIn the near future, an athelete (James Caan) who excels in the brutal, bloody international sport of rollerball causes trouble for the powers that be when he becomes too famous; his efforts to beat the system form the plot of this shakily conceived but entertaining exercise in sci-fi suspense. Although there are scripted mumblings about computers, multinational corporations and dehumanization, the core of Rollerball is the game itself, a combination of roller derby, hockey, and open warfare that's thrillingly filmed. Most of the cast takes it all too seriously, but Ralph Richardson has a brief, sparkling role as a kindly old computer genius assigned to tend the mastery memory bank, Zero.

Directed by James Goldstone. 119 min.\n\nThe script of this very meek suspense film is by the usually estimable team of Richard Levinson and William Link, the creators of TV's Columbo and Murder She Wrote. This time, their plotting skill didn't carry over to the big screen. The plot has a mad-genius extortionist (Timothy Bottoms) threatening to create havoc in a major amusement park unless he's paid handsomely. This is less a disaster film than a suspense procedural, with good guy George Segal trying to track down the loony before all hell breaks loose. Action fans will have to wait until the last half hour to be placated.

Directed by John Flynn. 99 min.\n\nFor a while, it looks as if it is going to be an honest examination of the tribulations faced by homecoming Vietnam veterans: William Devane, as a U.S. major who was tortured for eight years in a Viet Cong POW camp, returns home to a wooden, emotionless shell, caring little that his wife and son have become attached to his best friend. But then psycho killers murder his family, and it's time for the usual Vietnam vet killing-machine stuff.

Directed by Stuart Millar. 107 min.\n\nThis is a sequel to the hit 1969 western True Grit with large measures of The African Queen offered as a starring vehicle for the never-before-teamed Katherine Hepburn and John Wayne. Wayne is amusing, as he always was after he learned to parody himself, but Hepburn is the weak link as yet another fierce old spinster.Buy the DVD/Blu-ray/VHS at Amazon.com.\n\nTHE ROSE\n\nDrama, 1979, USA, R, * * 1/2\n\nBette Midler, Alan Bates, Frederic Forrest, Harry Dean Stanton, David Keith, Barry Primus. Directed by Mark Rydell. 134 min.\n\nThis very loose fictionalized retelling of the life of Janis Joplin embraces every rise-and-fall-of-a-star cliché in screen history. When we first meet the Rose (Bette Midler) battling with her manipulative manager (Alan Bates), she's already on the skids, and it's all downhill from there. The film is elevated from the trash heap by Midler's natural, sizzlingly emotional portrayal of the wrecked superstar, a tour de force performance in a role that desperately calls for one. Her singing, including soaring versions of the bluesy \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" and \"Stay with Me,\" as well as the title ballad, is \"acted\" as well, in a style that's a marked departure from her own. Despite its cheap, oversimplified qualities, the drug-and-booze-soaked odyssey on display is a harrowing one. Midler and Frederic Forrest (as one of the Rose's amiable flings) were both Oscar nominees.

Directed by David Lean. 192 min.\n\nDavid Lean is a filmmaker so skilled at making lengthy, visually grandiose epics for the wide screen (The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago) that he almost persuades us that trying to make an epic out of this fairly small story was the right and proper thing to do. It wasn't, though. Set in Ireland during the country's British occupation in World War I, the story concerns Sarah Miles as the spoiled wife of impotent schoolteacher Robert Mitchum and mistress of British soldier Christopher Jones. Mitchum is badly miscast, although he makes more of his role than one could really have hoped. John Mills won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for his role (also against type) as a hunchbacked village idiot. Freddie Young also picked up an Oscar for the beautiful camerawork, but -- and this could be a fatal problem for home viewing -- much of the 70mm wide-screen presentation will be lost on a small screen.

Directed by Lewis John Carlino. 105 min.\n\nIn adapting Yukio Mishima's circumspect novel of humor and betrayal at a Yokohama seaport, writer-director Lewis John Carlino has transplanted the tale to Devon, England, and come up with a film that is moody, evocative, erotic, and finally nonsensical. Imagine a version of Anna Karenina filmed along Miami Beach, and you may begin to get a sense of the cultural dislocation that occurs here. Mishima's complex, tormented tale of a sexually malnourished widow, the sailor who beds her, and the pubescent son who resents the older man is uniquely Eastern in philosophy and spirit, and deliberately bizzare within that context. Carlino treats it with a straight face but doesn't seem quite to understand it; what emerges is all portent and allegory, with little substance or meaning. There are good performances and torrid love scenes from the two principals, but poor acting from Jonathan Kahn and Earl Rhodes as pompous, cant-spouting brats.\n\nSAME TIME, NEXT YEAR\n\nComedy, 1978, USA, PG, * * 1/2\n\nEllen Burstyn, Alan Alda, Ivan Bonar, Bernie Kuby, Cosmo Sardo, David Northcutt, William Cantrell. Directed by Robert Mulligan. 119 min.\n\nPleasantly old-fashioned, rather literal adaptation of Bernard Slade's hit play about an adulterous couple who meet for one weekend a year over twenty-six years. The passing of time is represented by new hats and different hairstyles for Ellen Burstyn, and some truly tacky montages that reduce everything from hula hoops to the My Lai massacre into tiny video images. Despite the relentlessly schematic style and motormouth dialogue, the notion of \"illicit fidelity\" becomes charming, due more to Burstyn's dignified, funny, and touching performances than to Alan Alda's one-note morosity. Absolutely unoriginal, but quite satisfying in its familiar way. Johnny Mathis and Jane Olivor sing the requisite Marvin Hamlisch theme song, \"The Last Time I Felt Like This.\" Major scenes filmed at the Heritage House in Mendocino, on the northern coast of California.

Directed by John Badham. 108 min. (PG); 119 min. (R).\n\nJohn Travolta shot to stardom playing Tony Manero in this music- and dance-filled drama about a working-class Brooklyn kid who lets loose each weekend at a local disco. It's the grandaddy of just about every pop-music movie released since, and a must for any student of 1970s pop culture in all its tacky greatness. Whether by luck or skill, Travolta gave a performance accurate and incisive enough to earn him an Oscar nomination, and his dancing is still electrifying. Director John Badham is quite sharp in his depiction of teenagers who can only let themselves live it up by dancing or destruction, and the Bee Gees score is the last word in disco. (Watch for the ominous appearance of a Rocky poster on Tony's wall -- it was Sylvester Stallone who directed the execrable 1983 sequel, Staying Alive.) Note: On videocassette, Saturday Night Fever is available in its original R-rated form and in the PG version that was released later to capitalize on a huge teenage audience, most of whom had seen it already anyway. The shorter version is missing one significant scene, and a lot of the grit that makes the movie more than just pop trash. The R version is recommended.

Scott. 114 min.\n\nIt's really a shame that this wasn't a good, or even remotely competent film, because it might have accomplished something. Star George C. Scott produced and directed, then also distributed the film to theaters himself, hoping to buck the system of Hollywood middlemen who gobble up the lion's share of a film's profits and then fudge it in the paperwork at the expense of both filmmakers and exhibitors. Unfortunately, the film is a complete mess, two hours of pseudo-Darwinian babble mixed with generous doses of Freud. Scott and wife Trish Van Devere (his wife in real life as well) are stranded on a tropical island with their infant son. As the boy (played by Johnny Carson's son) grows up, he develops certain, uh, animal attractions toward the only human female on the island -- Mom. Featuring some of the most ludicrous dialogue you've ever heard, along with equally bad acting.

Avildsen. 100 min.\n\nThis early 1970s update of Death of a Salesman and The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit casts Jack Lemmon as a small-time garment manufacturer in crisis. While preoccupied with wartime memories, he considers burning down his factory in order to collect on his insurance. This bitter, depressing look at one man's mid-life crisis has an uncompromising flavor that is both repellent and powerful, and Lemmon's Oscar-winning performance hits all the right notes. The sour, unpleasant characters and perspective will appeal mainly to those who see water pitchers as half empty rather than half full, but the film is impressively done, and still packs a powerful punch. Jack Gilford is excellent as Lemmon's business partner.

Directed by Jerry Schatzberg. 112 min.\n\nOne of the better 1970s \"buddy\" films, a subgenre that goes back at least as far as Of Mice and Men but that really came into its own in the wake of Midnight Cowboy and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. In this version, recent San Quentin parolee Gene Hackman, hitchhiking to Pittsburgh, where he plans to use his savings to open a car wash, meets up with Al Pacino, a sailor on his way to see the five-year-old child whose mother he abandoned before its birth. Hackman is the closed-off one, Pacino the clownish extrovert; of course, each brings out the inner depths of the other. Generally too heavy-handed (in one scene Hackman, who wears innumerable layers of clothing, saves Pacino from a beating in a bar by doing a mock striptease, removing his clothing and his psychic armor in a bit of symbolism right out of Freshman Lit.), but saved by the performances, especially Hackman's and those of the supporting actresses.

Mosley, Lotte Lenya, Richard Masur, Carl Weathers, Brian Dennehy, Mary Jo Caatlett. Directed by Michael Ritchie. 107 min.\n\nIf only Michael Ritchie's adaptation of Dan Jenkins's bestseller were about football, or team relations -- or something that might justify its setting in the midst of a Miami gridiron squad on its way to the Super Bowl. Instead, Semi-Tough is a slick, contemptuous redneck-chic movie that devotes most of its time to a farcical attack on New Age consciousness-raising movements. The film views psychic seekers -- and intellectuals and businessmen and devout Christians -- as ninnies and offers only a sort of juvenile nihilism as an alternative. Burt Reynolds's performance here is good enough to make you wish it were housed in a worthier film. Kris Kristofferson and Jill Clayburgh, though, are miscast and unconvincing.

Directed by Michael Winner. 91 min.\n\nThis is one of the lesser examples of the school of religious horror films (Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist and The Omen.). A model rents an apartment in a Brooklyn Heights building and begins to notice that her neighbors are, well, sort of weird. Turns out they're either demons or priests, all out to secure the entranceway to hell, which just happens to be located in the building. Director Michael Winner has no touch for subtlety, as he demonstrated in the first three Death Wish films -- the devil, for instance, is played by Burgess Meredith as a raging queen, and when the script calls for the minions of hell to arise, Winner uses real sideshow freaks and human monsters. The effect is creepy, but you feel abused. The large cast is used to no great advantage, least of all to distract attention from Cristina Raines, who is quite bad.

Directed by Sidney Lumet. 130 min.\n\nSidney Lumet, working in the realistic crime drama milieu that is his forte, adapts Peter Maas's novel about the New York City maverick cop Frank Serpico. Lumet gets a raw, gutsy performance from Al Pacino as the officer who refuses to take graft, and his depiction of Serpico's dangerous raids is explosively violent. In some ways, Serpico feels like a warm-up for Lumet's similar, superior Prince of the City (1981). It's Pacino you come away remembering.

Directed by Herbert Ross. 113 min.\n\nA delightful, consistently intelligent mystery-adventure, swirling fact, fiction, speculation, and fantasy into a captivating alliance between two great psychological detectives, Sherlock Holmes and Sigmund Freud. The \"solution\" in the title refers to cocaine, and interest which brings the two together, and to the conundrum they must unravel, an entanglement involving a mysterious woman (Vanessa Redgrave) and the sinister Professor Moriarity (Laurence Olivier) that takes the unlikely team across Europe. Writer Nicholas Meyer is the master of this sort of what-if plot (he also united H. G. Wells and Jack the Ripper in Time after Time), and his story, ably directed by Herbert Ross, is full of sharp wit and invention. There isn't a bad performance in the cast, but you'll especially enjoy Olivier, who adds another memorable name to his list of latter-day villians, and Robert Duvall, very fine as the very British Dr. Watson. Sparkly, smart, entertaining fare.

Directed by Philip D'Antoni. 103 min.\n\nThe producer of Bullitt and The French Connection tries to do it again with another fast-moving story of unorthodox cops against a big-city background. Only problem is, this time he hired himself to direct it. There's a ten-minute car chase that rivals anything in the other two productions. But nothing in the rest of the movie, which mixes four undercover NYPD cops and a gangland kidnapping scheme, is particularly memorable. The grimy New York City visuals and Don Ellis's jazz-rock score help mask the other deficiencies. Even more so than in The French Connection, the viewer is expected to condone and applaud the street cops' tactics of breaking the law in the name of the law.

Directed by Ken Hughes. 91 min.\n\nA dull, witless musical comedy? A disastrous end to the career of eighty-five-year-old Mae West? An embarrassment for everyone involved? Yes, Sextette is all this, and a suspense film to boot. The suspense revolves around the dreaded moment when the overweight, arthritic octogenarian will be revealed in close-up. Fortunately, this moment never comes. Director Ken Hughes wisely keeps Mae behind a mask of makeup and shoots her in nothing closer than medium shot through gauzy filters. Any closer, and this film would certainly qualify as a horror classic as the once-talented comedienne sidles up to beefy males one-fourth her age and delivers her famous innuendos. In this film based on her own plays is a movie star whose spicy memoirs get into the wrong hands just before her wedding to British royalty (Timothy Dalton). It is hard to select a low point -- Mae and Tim singing \"Love Will Keep Us Together,\" Mae discoing to a number by Alice Cooper, or a fashion sequence with Mae modeling gold-sequined gowns. No one, with the possible exception of George Raft, emerges unscathed by this abomination that tries to pass as camp. Buy the DVD/Blu-ray/VHS at Amazon.com.\n\nSGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND\n\nMusical, 1978, USA, R, *\n\nPeter Frampton, Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb, Alice Cooper, Billy Preston, Steven Martin, George Burns, Donald Pleasence, Earth, Wind and Fire. Directed by Michael Schultz. 111 min.\n\nThe entrepeneurs behind Saturday Night Fever pulled together this virtual desecration of classic Beatles tunes by inflating them into a stupid, obvious, cartoonish story line, and putting them in the mouths of such 1970s pop icons as Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees. Watching the disco brothers Gibb and arena rocker Frampton cough out the great music on their tissue-thin voices will remind you that 1978 was not a banner year for pop tunes (the year's other big musical was the film Grease). What there is of the script, not surprisingly, stinks. You'd be better off with A Hard Day's Night, Help! or any old Beatles album.

Directed by Gordon Parks. 100 min.\n\nWith liberal doses of sex and violence, this groundbreaking portrayal of an ultracool black private eye paved the way for dozens of black exploitation films, most of which didn't match its skill or style. Though no action masterpiece, Shaft is a furiously exciting comic-book adventure whose hero wipes out truckloads of criminals and beds whichever lassies he pleases during lulls. That this superstud was black wouldn't excite the interest today that it did in '71, but Parks's smooth, no-nonsense direction and Isaac Hayes's driving funk score are still likely to quicken a lot of pulses.

Directed by Robert Stevenson. 91 min.\n\nDisney's belated follow-up to its 1959 hit The Shaggy Dog should satisfy fans of the original without winning any new admirers. Once again, a guileless good guy -- here an aspiring district attorney -- turns into a sheepdog every time a certain magical incantation is uttered. Director Robert Stevenson was the undisputed king of Walt's \"family\" comedies (this was his nineteenth for the studio), and he manages to keep things moving at a reasonable clip. However, if you're not already chortling at the prospect of a talking dog, stay away.

Directed by Hal Ashby. 109 min.\n\nThe episodic style and sexual shenanigans of this bedroom comedy add up to a surprisingly pungent, pointed look at manners and morality circa 1968 (the film takes place on the eve of Richard Nixon's election). Warren Beatty plays a womanizing hairdresser who finds that his customers are demanding more in the way of house calls than even he can provide. Beatty's charming Lothario races from one Beverly Hills mansion to the next, blowdryer at the ready, and, while Shampoo uses his character to incarnate every aspect of 1960s political consciousness that failed, it's the women who will stay in your mind: Goldie Hawn's bubble-headed actress, Julie Christie's bitter, self-protective mistress, Carrie Fisher's randy teenager, and Lee Grant's Oscar-winning turn as a shrewd but desperate wife.

Directed by Robert M. Young. 104 min.\n\nFrom the very beginning, we know this is no mincing, humanitarian prison movie. In Short Eyes, the mostly black and Hispanic prisoners are tough and cocky, proud of their crimes and fiercely unrepenant; they're not only coping with prison life, they've mastered it. Into this bizarre civilization steps Clark Davis, masterfully portrayed by Bruce Davison. He's a \"short eyes,\" a child molester, guilty of the one crime the other prisoners can't forgive -- a milksop whom the prisoners hate not only because his sexuality mirrors their own, but because his self-loathing tests their own tenuous self-respect, which is the one thing that stands between them and abyss. Despite some staginess, this is probably the most convincing prison movie ever filmed; it's no surprise that it makes your skin crawl. Adapted by Miguel Pinero from his Obie and Drama Critics Circle Award-winning play, it boasts extraordinary performances by Pinero, Tito Goya, Kenny Steward, and Joe Carberry.

Directed by Mel Brooks. 88 min.\n\nMel Brooks's send-up of the pretalkie era is audacious in one respect: it really is silent -- except for one word whose uttering makes for one of the funnier jokes in the film. Otherwise, this falls short of the superb genre parodies the director mounted in Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, although it's occasionally quite skilled and funny. The plot has filmmaker Mel Funn trying to get financing for his new picture from Engulf and Devour Studios. Best among the five superstars who have extended appearances is Anne Bancroft, who does a deft takeoff on her own glamorous image using the simple gimmick of crossed eyes.

When the bureaucrats on Earth decide that the environment will never be able to support flora again, Dern kills his crewmates rather than jettison the cargo and takes off for parts unknown. Douglass Trumbull worked on the special effects in 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the effects in this, his directorial debut, certainly seem to interest him more than the premise.

Directed by Arthur Hiller. 113 min.\n\nThis genial comedy-adventure, set on a supertrain from Los Angeles to Chicago, is only moderately engaging. Considering the talents of its cast, it's also surprisingly low on laughs. The story, with Wrong Man-ish intrigue, slick villians, and vanishing corpes, means to be a 1930s-style sophisticated romp, but director Arthur Hiller's slack execution suggests that some genres are better consigned to past films or present masters. The three stars are all quite funny, especially Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, who reteamed later for the somewhat better Stir Crazy. But any move that hires Richard Pryor and then keeps him off the screen for the first hour clearly has its funnybone in the wrong place.

Emmet Walsh. Directed by George Roy Hill. 123 min.\n\nPaul Newman holds together George Roy Hill's confused, foulmouthed comedy about a down-and-out hockey team that resorts to violence to sell tickets. The film falls into the trap of glorifying the violence it pretends to deplore, and Nancy Dowd's script takes a rather naive delight in its own naughtiness. The women (Jennifer Warren as hockey coach Newman's estranged wife and Lindsay Crouse as the well-educated, hard-drinking hockey wife) are intriguing, and the roughhousing is often hilarious. Newman's performance is his best in years, and the striptease Michael Onkean (The Rookies) does on the ice is funny and sexy.

Directed by George Roy Hill. 104 min.\n\nAs he later did with John Irving's The World According to Garp, director George Roy Hill adapts the Kurt Vonnegut novel to the screen with a wonderful concision, creating a work that is faithful to its source and yet distinctively his own. Everyman Billy Pilgrim becomes \"unstuck in time,\" living every moment in his life simultaneously: he moves randomly from the firebombing of Dresden during World War II to his boring contemporary life as an optician in upstate New York to his captivity in an intergalactic zoo on the planet Tralfamadore.

Directed by Michael Ritchie. 113 min.\n\nTeenage beauty pageants are the target of this sharply funny satire, one of Michael Ritchie's most consitently entertaining films. Bruce Dern and Barbara Feldon stand out as the sponsor and coordinator of a Young Miss America runoff in California, but the most memorable moments involve the young women -- shrewd, calculating beauties who fight tooth and nail to see who's the sweetest of them all. Some priceless lines pin the ethos of the Me Decade to the wall like a wriggling insect, and even if the film is too affectionate about its subject to really sting, its more gentle mockery holds up nicely.

Directed by Hal Needham. 97 min.\n\nA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars broke every box-office record in history; that year, this low-road chase comedy was the second most popular film. Burt Reynolds had already refined his good-ol'-boy persona in White Lightning and Gator but hadn't yet become the smug talk-show standby of his later films; as the superskilled speed driver Bandit, he's actually fun to watch here, amiable and easy going. \"Smokey\" is, of course, Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), the blustery redneck who's hot on his trail but never quite catches up. The film has as much complexity and style as a Road Runner cartoon, and that's quite enough; if you've never seen one of these, give it a spin.

Directed by Peter Clifton and Joe Massot. 136 min.\n\nThis concert film made during a Led Zeppelin concert at Madison Square Garden in 1973 is strictly for fans, and only the less discriminating of those. The concert footage is fleshed out with indecipherable fantasy sequences, one per band member, and some interesting scenes of the band's manager handling the whole road show from backstage. But that still leaves two hours of the band onstage, in which they perform thirteen songs -- that's an average length of about nine minutes apiece -- that are pretty much indistinguishable from each other.

Directed by Martin Ritt. 105 min.\n\nMade at a time when films about blacks ranged from Shaft to Blacula, Sounder was such a breath of fresh air that people fell over themselves trying to praise it. The kudos were not undeserved: it is an excellent film dealing with a family struggling to remain intact against pressure from the outside world. Set in the rural South of the 1930s, Sounder is an outstanding family film, one that adults can watch without feeling that they have to look down. It presents rural life and prejudice with verisimilitude but without excess, conveying its emotions and platitudes gently but effectively. Superbly directed by the often underrated Martin Ritt.

Directed by Ettore Scola. 110 min.\n\nIn their eighth film together, Marcello Mastrioanni and Sophia Loren play a homosexual radio announcer and an oppressed housewife drawn together by the ways in which they suffer under Italy's fascist regime. Their uneasy, inarticulate relationship is meant to serve as a global metaphor; the film takes place on the day of Hitler's famous \"house call\" on Mussolini, and the dialogue is occasionally too studied and deliberate. But Ettore Scola's sensitivity as a director of actors has never been more evident -- he draws a beautiful performance from Loren and a very touching, credible one from Mastrioanni (who was nominated for an Academy Award). It's small in scale and more theatrical than it needs to be, but quite effective nonetheless.
