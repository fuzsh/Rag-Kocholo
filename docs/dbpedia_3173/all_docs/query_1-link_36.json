Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee and Employee Resource Groups have assembled a great list of movies, ranging in genre and age-appropriateness, for you to enjoy.\n\nAt first glance, these movies don't have much in common. Looking deeper, you see they each have one thing in common; diversity.\n\nTake a look at the full list of movies, and where you can find them, below.\n\nSpider-Man: Into the Spiderverse\n\nRated: PG\n\nWhere to Watch: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and Google Play\n\nThis animated Marvel adventure centers on Brooklyn teen Miles Morales who becomes a new Spider-Man and ends up meeting other Spider-people from parallel universes. Kids won’t fail to notice the movie’s diverse characters and clear messages about friendship, courage, mentoring, perseverance, teamwork, and (of course!) the nature of power and responsibility.\n\nMoana\n\nRated: PG\n\nWhere to Watch: YouTube, Google Play, iTunes, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+\n\nThe animated film Moana is about the action-filled voyage of Moana, the daughter of a Polynesian chief, as she sails across the ocean. Moana learns powerful lessons along the way as she discovers her own identity. This movie showcases a strong female lead from the Pacific Islands, a diverse setting that isn’t represented in many films.\n\nDora and the Lost City of Gold\n\nRated: PG\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime Video\n\nSince this Dora is a teen rather than a very young girl, the movie is geared toward older viewers than the show. The story is a mix of high school comedy and true Dora adventure with themes of teamwork, communication, compassion, courage, curiosity, and perseverance.\n\nWonder\n\nRated: PG\n\nWhere to Watch: Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and Google Play\n\nAuggie, the main character in Wonder (which is based on a book), was born with facial differences and is entering a mainstream school for the first time. This movie features themes of compassion and acceptance and teaches us that the differences we all have simply add to the richness of our lives, not take away from it.\n\nCoco\n\nRated: PG\n\nWhere to Watch: YouTube, Google Play, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+\n\nThis animated film features an all-Latino cast and shares the story of Miguel, a 12-year-old Mexican boy who is an aspiring musician. Miguel goes into the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather and the movie highlights many details of daily life in Mexico.\n\nHidden Figures\n\nRated: PG\n\nWhere to Watch: YouTube, Google Play, Amazon Prime Video, iTunes, and Hulu\n\nHidden Figures is based on the incredible true story of three female mathematicians who dealt with many challenges around race and gender as they became an important part of NASA and the U.S. space program.\n\nHome\n\nRated: PG\n\nWhere to Watch: Amazon Prime Video, Google Play, YouTube, and iTunes\n\nThis movie creates a world in which aliens known as The Boov, running from their enemies, must find a new planet to inhabit, so they take over Earth.

She teams up with Oh, the most human-friendly of The Boov, and an adventure ensues.\n\nAkeelah and the Bee\n\nRated: PG\n\nWhere to Watch: YouTube, iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu\n\nAkeelah is an 11-year-old that lives in a predominately Black neighborhood and goes to compete at the Scripps National Spelling Bee. The film explores the unique pressure that Akeelah feels, as well as the discrimination she faces from the families of other competitors.\n\nMulan\n\nRated: G\n\nWhere to Watch: Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, iTunes, YouTube, and Google Play\n\nMulan is a decidedly Disneyfied take on a Chinese fairy tale, but its elements of Chinese culture and history ring true. This movie focuses on a strong, female lead (like Moana and Merida) who doesn’t align with the typical Disney princess. While Mulan ultimately becomes a hero and helps her people, she does so by rebelling against authority, which is worth discussing.\n\nA Ballerina’s Tale\n\nRated: N/A\n\nWhere to Watch: YouTube, iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Prime Video, and Sling TV\n\nA Ballerina’s Tale shows the struggles and successes of Misty Copeland, the first Black principal dancer of the American Ballet Theatre.

Part of what makes this film notable is how it breaks the mold of the superhero movie, as the first to feature a black director and black actors in all the leading roles.\n\nRemember the Titans\n\nRated: PG\n\nWhere to Watch: YouTube, iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+\n\nTaking place in Virginia in 1971, Remember the Titans is based on the true story of a newly integrated high school football team and the struggles around racial tensions, both on and off the field.\n\nThe Princess and the Frog\n\nRated: G\n\nWhere to Watch: Netflix, YouTube, Google Play, iTunes, and Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe Princess and the Frog Rated: G Where to Watch: Netflix, YouTube, Google Play, iTunes, and Amazon Prime Video\n\nThis animated film features Disney’s first Black princess, Tiana. The movie doesn’t explicitly discuss race, and that’s a good way to show young children representation and diversity in movies.\n\nThe Boy Who Harnessed The Wind\n\nRated: PG\n\nWhere to Watch: Netflix\n\nThis is another film based on a true story. The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind is about 13-year old William Kamkwamba and how he discovers a way to save his Malawian village from famine.

The movie explores the various religious traditions and laws that many Muslim girls and women have to follow, especially when it comes to dress and submitting to men in authority. It is subtitled, so better suited for older kids and teens.\n\nRuby Bridges\n\nRated: PG\n\nWhere to Watch: YouTube, iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+\n\nYou may have been hearing about Ruby Bridges recently. Ruby was the first African American child to attend an all-white school in the south. While this seems like it should have taken place so long ago, it actually wasn’t that long ago, only taking place in 1960. Ruby Bridges, now age 65, is an American civil rights activist. Ruby Bridges shares Ruby’s real-life experience.\n\nJust Mercy\n\nRated: PG-13\n\nWhere to Watch: YouTube, Vudu, Google Play, and Amazon Prime Video\n\nThis movie, starring Michael B.

Featuring scholars, activists, and politicians, this thought-provoking documentary analyzes the criminalization and mass incarceration of Black Americans over time. The film is so well done, and while some scenes are, frankly, very hard to watch, its messaging is incredibly important and educational—especially now. You can watch it on Netflix, but the film was also recently released in full on YouTube.\n\nThe Hate U Give\n\nRated: PG-13\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu\n\nThis film, directed by George Tillman Jr., is based on a 2017 young adult novel of the same name by author Angie Thomas.
