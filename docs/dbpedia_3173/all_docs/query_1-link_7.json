        "text": "History of the Comedy Genre\n\nThe short L’Arroseur Arrosé (or The Sprinkler Sprinkled) from 1895 is often cited as the earliest surviving comedy film. This one-minute tableau directed by one of the Lumière Brothers sees a gardener that gets pranked by a mischievous boy into spraying water in his own face. The image of the gardener getting hit by the stream is etched into cultural memory and has been copied and parodied countless times.\n\nThere are even older short films that have comedic elements, but this can be seen as the very first pure comedy film. After the establishment of Hollywood, several comedic stars of silent film emerged, including Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Laurel & Hardy.\n\nWhen sound was not available as a tool for filmmaking, these performers used their bodies and faces to get a laugh from their audiences. Charlie Chaplin made his Hollywood debut in 1914, and by 1916 he was a global phenomenon, largely because of his tramp character. This figure with shoddy clothes, a bowl hat, a cane, and a short moustache always seemed to end up in trouble with figures of authority, but through his ingenuity, he got out of many hairy situations.\n\nMore from Film Genres"
