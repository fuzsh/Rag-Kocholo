        "text": "When it comes to period piece movies, there are a few patterns: Jane Austen, old time-y relationship problems, Emma Thompson, Merchant Ivory productions, or Keira Knightley dramatically storming away from someone. As Helena Bonham Carter once said, \"Period movies are my destiny. I should get a few ribs taken out, because I'll be in a corset for the rest of my life.\"\n\nAnd the thing is, some combination of these common tropes is probably why you're a fan of romantic period movies in the first place. But the genre exists outside of those themes (and England), too — whether it takes place in 1960s Wyoming or 19th-century China.\n\nSo, yes, there's plenty of Austen (Pride & Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma) and some repeat actors on this list, but there's also some more history to explore.\n\nCheck out EW's picks for 25 of the best romantic period movies that are sure to make you swoon.\n\n01 of 23\n\nTitanic (1997)\n\nWhy not start with a movie that is huge in every way? Titanic is famous for James Cameron's special effects that sent hundreds of passengers realistically hurtling from the side of a giant ship, but it's mainly remembered for the timeless love story between soulful vagabond Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and repressed socialite Rose (Kate Winslet). After all, it was their whirlwind romance that forever changed how we look at fogged-up windows. And floating doors. And drawing.\n\nWhere to watch Titanic: Paramount+\n\n02 of 23\n\nPride & Prejudice (2005)\n\nBefore any Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle stans get up in arms, remember: This is a movies-only list. So, 2005's Pride & Prejudice is the clear favorite to represent Jane Austen's classic 1813 novel. This adaptation from Joe Wright stars Keira Knightley as the ever-defiant Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew Macfayden as the moody Mr. Darcy. Period drama enthusiasts will be interested to know that Wright set the movie in the late-18th century instead of the early-19th century in part because of his hatred of empire waist dresses.\n\nWhere to watch Pride & Prejudice: Peacock\n\n03 of 23\n\nSense and Sensibility (1995)\n\nIt wouldn't be a period movies list without Emma Thompson, and this won't be the last you see of her here. Thompson wrote and starred in Sense and Sensibility, which was directed by Ang Lee (it won't be the last you see of him, either). The film tells the story of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor (Thompson) and Marianne (Kate Winslet), as they deal with 19th-century-style relationship issues involving Colonel Brandon (Alan Rickman), Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant), and John Willoughby (Greg Wise). Many credit this essential dowry drama for launching Austen adaptations into the mainstream, and we're all forever in debt.\n\nWhere to watch Sense and Sensibility: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n04 of 23\n\nA Room With a View (1986)\n\nHere's another period piece theme: Merchant Ivory movies. The first one on our list directed by James Ivory and produced by Ismail Merchant is A Room With a View. The 1986 film stars Helena Bonham Carter as the young Lucy Honeychurch, who visits Florence with her older cousin (Maggie Smith) and meets an array of fellow guests at their hotel. Of course, this includes an intriguing romantic interest played by Julian Sands, plus plenty of kissing in open fields.\n\nWhere to watch A Room With a View: Max\n\n05 of 23\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)\n\nIn Céline Sciamma's Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Noémie Merlant plays an artist who is sent to paint a wedding portrait for a woman (Adèle Haenel) who does not want to enter an arranged marriage. The eerie, sensual French film was described by EW's critic as \"an 18th-century lesbian love story set almost entirely within the windswept parameters of a remote seaside villa, with reams of meditative dialogue and almost no male roles to speak of.\" Consider us sold.\n\nWhere to watch Portrait of a Lady on Fire: Hulu\n\n06 of 23\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)\n\nPeriod pieces aren't all corsets and European history. Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a wuxia movie and a love story between skilled warriors Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat). Bai entrusts his machete-wielding lover to transport his treasured sword, Green Destiny, but when she's robbed of the precious artifact, their relationship is pushed to the limit in this action-packed adventure. As Lee put it himself, \"Sense and Sensibility, but with kick-ass.\"\n\nWhere to watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n07 of 23\n\nBelle (2014)\n\nAmma Asante's Belle is based on the life of Dido Elizabeth Belle, a multiracial woman who was brought up in the British aristocracy in the 1700s. While not much is known about the real Belle's life, the film (starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw) explores the prejudice she faces in high society, her romance with law student John Davinier (Sam Reid), and her ties to the abolitionist cause. \"Belle is like a Jane Austen novel spiked with an extra shot of social conscience,\" EW's critic writes. \"...[It] subtly skewers the absurd rules and hypocrisies of class.\"\n\nWhere to watch Belle: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n08 of 23\n\nThe Notebook (2004)\n\nMoving things forward a couple of centuries, there's the romance to end all romances: The Notebook. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams (who, by the way, hated each other at first) star as couple Noah and Allie, who begin a tumultuous relationship in the 1940s before the two are separated by World War II, though that's far from the end of their love story. The older versions of their characters are played to a full-on sobbing effect by James Garner and Gena Rowlands.\n\nWhere to watch The Notebook: Max\n\n09 of 23\n\nMy Fair Lady (1964)\n\nBased on the George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion, Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison star in the classic musical My Fair Lady as Eliza Doolittle and Henry Higgins. You know the story: She's a woman living in poverty and selling flowers; he's a wealthy professor who bets he can make her into a high-society lady. Romance ensues, obviously.\n\nWhere to watch My Fair Lady: Paramount+\n\n10 of 23\n\nAtonement (2007)\n\nAnother Keira Knightley–Joe Wright collab, Atonement stars Knightley as a wealthy woman, Cecilia, who falls in love with Robbie (James McAvoy), a worker on her family's property. But their romance is thwarted thanks to the accusations brought forth by her younger sister, Briony (a 13-year-old Saoirse Ronan). Beginning in the 1930s, the movie shows Briony's decades-long attempt to atone for her grievances, with older versions of her character played by Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave.\n\nWhere to watch Atonement: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n11 of 23\n\nLittle Women (1994 or 2019)\n\nGillian Armstrong's 1994 version or Greta Gerwig's 2019 version — your choice. Both adaptations of Louisa May Alcott's novel Little Women feature touching meditations on sisterhood, as well as the complicated 19th-century romance between writer Jo March and boy-next-door Laurie. You just have to decide if you're more of a Winona Ryder and Christian Bale person or a Saoirse Ronan and Timothée Chalamet fan.\n\nWhere to watch Little Women (1994): Paramount+ With Showtime\n\nWhere to watch Little Women (2019): Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n12 of 23\n\nEmma (1996 or 2020)\n\nWhat goes around comes around...even if it first came around in 1815. Jane Austen's novel Emma was adapted in 1996 with Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role, and again in 2020 starring Anya Taylor-Joy. In both cases, the story is about a wealthy young woman who plays matchmaker for the people in her life while facing romantic woes of her own. The book also inspired Clueless, which is more of a time capsule of 1995 than a period piece.\n\nWhere to watch Emma (1996): Paramount+ With Showtime\n\nWhere to watch Emma. (2020): Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n13 of 23\n\nRomeo and Juliet (1968)\n\nIt would simply feel wrong not to include the most famous romantic tale of all time. The Franco Zeffirelli version of Romeo and Juliet is a classic — maybe you watched it in school at some point? — and stars Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey in the title roles. (Honorable mention to 1996's Romeo + Juliet, which doesn't quite qualify as a period piece despite its Shakespearean dialogue.)\n\nWhere to watch Romeo and Juliet: Paramount+ With Showtime\n\n14 of 23\n\nHowards End (1992)\n\nIt all comes together with this one as period piece regulars Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham Carter star in Howards End from Merchant Ivory Productions. The actresses play sisters Margaret and Helen Schlegel, who become involved in the lives of the wealthy Wilcox family as they navigate relationships and the new ownership of a country estate called — you guessed it — Howards End.\n\nWhere to watch Howards End: Tubi\n\n15 of 23\n\nCarol (2015)\n\nRooney Mara and Cate Blanchett star in Carol, which follows Therese (Mara), a young department store worker who begins seeing the titular older woman (Blanchett) in the early-1950s. Their affair is complicated by their other relationships with men, Carol's custody battle for her daughter, and the intolerance of their time period.\n\nWhere to watch Carol: Netflix\n\n16 of 23\n\nThe English Patient (1996)\n\nThough Seinfeld's Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) didn't like it, the WWII epic The English Patient was a huge hit when it came out in 1996. The film by Anthony Minghella tells the story of a man (Ralph Fiennes) who has been badly burned and cannot remember his identity. As his memories trickle in, he recounts details of a past love affair to his nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), through a series of tender flashbacks.\n\nWhere to watch The English Patient: Paramount+ With Showtime\n\n17 of 23\n\nLoving (2016)\n\nLoving tells the story of Mildred and Richard Loving who, following two arrests, won the 1967 landmark Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia, which invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage. While the film does focus on the lawsuit, their defiant love is at the center of the narrative, thanks in part to the stellar performances by Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton.\n\nWhere to watch Loving: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n18 of 23\n\nShakespeare in Love (1998)\n\nSure, there is some controversy surrounding Shakespeare in Love's enthusiastic Oscars campaign, but that doesn't mean it's not an acclaimed romantic period movie. (It just maybe wouldn't have won quite so many awards...) Either way, the film stars Joseph Fiennes as William Shakespeare in a (fictional) affair with a merchant's daughter, Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow). It's set during the time he wrote Romeo and Juliet, and indulges in more than a few literary parallels.\n\nWhere to watch Shakespeare in Love: Max\n\n19 of 23\n\nBrokeback Mountain (2005)\n\nSet between 1963 and 1983, Brokeback Mountain is the most modern period romance listed here, but it certainly still counts. The film stars Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as two Wyoming cowboys who fall in love on a ranching trip before going their separate ways and marrying women (Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway). But their love affair is far from over.\n\nWhere to watch Brokeback Mountain: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n20 of 23\n\nThe Sound of Music (1965)\n\nThere's so much going on in The Sound of Music — catchy songs, rambunctious children, day-saving nuns, and a World War — that the romantic aspect moves down the list of things that come to mind. But the love between a strict naval officer (Christopher Plummer) and his carefree governess (Julie Andrews) is at the center of the story. What more is there to say? It's only been regularly airing on TV for the past several decades...\n\nWhere to watch The Sound of Music: Disney+\n\n21 of 23\n\nIf Beale Street Could Talk (2018)\n\nBarry Jenkins' lyrical adaptation of James Baldwin's novel is a swoon-worthy yet urgent expression of love during trying times. Set in '70s New York, the film follows Tish (KiKi Layne) and Fonny (Stephan James), a couple whose lives are disrupted when Fonny is wrongfully arrested, leading Tish to fight to prove his innocence.\n\nWhere to watch If Beale Street Could Talk: Amazon Prime Video\n\n22 of 23\n\nThe Age of Innocence (1993)\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis stars as a respected lawyer in 1870s New York who falls in love with his fiancée May's (Winona Ryder) cousin Ellen (Michelle Pfeiffer) in this absorbing period drama. While Martin Scorsese may seem an unlikely person to direct this adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel of the same name, the casual cruelty expressed in the ensuing love triangle is such that the director once called The Age of Innocence his most violent movie.\n\nWhere to watch The Age of Innocence: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n23 of 23\n\nMoulin Rouge! (2001)\n\nNo period romance has ever been quite so \"spectacular, spectacular!\" Set in Paris at the turn of the 20th century, Moulin Rouge! follows idealistic writer Christian (Ewan McGregor) and courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman) as they express their doomed romance through modern pop songs against the backdrop of the famed titular windmill-roofed cabaret.\n\nWhere to watch Moulin Rouge!: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)"
