        "text": "From ‘Girls Trip’ to 'The Nice Guys'\n\nTouchstone/Getty Images\n\nAs much as I love a good romantic movie, it's always rewarding to see films that celebrate the beauty (and complexity) of platonic friendships. Whether it's a tight-knit group of BFFs who embark on a wild trip to New Orleans or a pair of rivals who form an unlikely bond, these titles remind me that friendships can be as rewarding as they are complicated.\n\nPerhaps you’re in the mood for an insightful drama that speaks to the challenges of maintaining friendships throughout adulthood (because let’s face it, making adult friends is hard), or maybe you’d prefer a lighthearted comedy that follows the misadventures of close pals. Thankfully, streaming services like Hulu and Netflix have all the best options available to watch at your leisure. Keep reading for 32 of the best movies about friendship.\n\nRELATED\n\n62 Best Friend Quotes to Share with Yours Immediately\n\n1. Joy Ride (2023)\n\nWho's in it: Ashley Park, Sherry Cola, Stephanie Hsu\n\nRun time: 94 minutes\n\nThe Hangover meets Girls Trip in this laugh-out-loud comedy, where four unlikely friends—Audrey, Lolo, Kat and Deadeye—embark on a wild international adventure after Audrey's business trip goes south. Yes, it's incredibly raunchy, but I appreciate the film's authentic portrayal of how complicated friendships can be—especially when different friend groups are mixed.\n\nDirector Adele Lim told ScreenRant, \"This movie came about because Cherry and Teresa, my co-writers and producers on this movie, we've been friends for a long time. We would just hang out together and crack each other out with nasty dating stories or stories from our friends, our completely unhinged, ridiculous friends. And we thought, 'We're professional writers. We can put this movie together.' We set out to make the kind of movie we wish we had growing up.\"\n\n2. You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah\n\nCast: Idina Menzel, Jackie Sandler, Adam Sandler, Sadie Sandler, Sunny Sandler\n\nRun time: 103 minutes\n\nIf you need proof that talent runs un the Sandler family, do yourself a favor and watch this charming comedy, which stars his wife and two daughters. It tells the story of a teenager who enlists the help of her BFF to plan the perfect bat mitzvah (and win over her crush). However, things go south when her bestie starts dating her crush. Operations Director of Branded Content, Rachel Gulmi, said, \"[This movie] made me feel like I was that age again, with all the drama and friendship circles and party invites. It was so cute and hit on all the right notes.\"\n\n3. Bridesmaids (2011)\n\nWho's in it: Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Rose Byrne, Ellie Kemper, Melissa McCarthy\n\nRun time: 124 minutes\n\nAnnie’s life may be in shambles, but it’s not stopping her from stepping up as her best friend’s maid of honor. Although she’s determined to make the most of her BFF’s milestone occasion, another successful friend tries to upstage her, leading to a messy rivalry and a wild adventure that the bride-to-be certainly didn’t sign up for.\n\nReflecting on the film's legacy, director Paul Feig told Observer, \"It just launched this super group of hilarious people to the world and showed the industry that movies starring women can make money. And it doesn’t even matter that it was good; by Hollywood’s definition, something’s only valid if it makes money. And had we done Bridesmaids and got these amazing reviews and it was beloved but it didn’t make any money or lost money, it would not have made any difference.\"\n\n4. Stand By Me (1986)\n\nWho's in it: Wil Wheaton, Jerry O’Connell, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman\n\nRun time: 88 minutes\n\nIn the summer of 1959, four young boys—Gordie, Vern, Chris and Teddy—set out to find the body of a missing local, who was recently discovered in the woods. And during the trek, they learn quite a bit about loyalty and friendship. Kiefer Sutherland, who played Ace, told The Guardian that the film bore some resemblance to his own experiences. He said, \"In many ways, the story that was being told in the movie was actually happening to me in my life. Those are the summers and friends I will never forget.\"\n\n5. Girls Trip (2017)\n\nWho's in it: Regina Hall, Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett Smith, Tiffany Haddis\n\nRun time: 122 minutes\n\nAllow us to introduce the fabulous Flossy Posse, a group of four girlfriends who decide to make the most of their getaway to New Orleans. While it’s overflowing with raunchy scenes and laugh-worthy moments, the ladies’ friendship remains the core focus of this brilliant comedy, and it features the absolute best cast. During her appearance on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Hall said, \"It has a lovely message. It's [about] sisterhood, being true to yourself and being courageous enough to walk in your truth.\"\n\n6. Friend (2001)\n\nWho's in it: Jang Dong-gun, Yu Oh-seong, Kim Bo-kyung\n\nRun time: 117 minutes\n\nFour kids from different backgrounds become the closest of friends, but as they get older, their different paths begin to pull them apart. While two of them pursue their education in college, the other two get involved with drugs and, worse yet, become each other’s rivals. Fun fact: This film is a semi-autobiographical, based on director Kwak Kyung-taek's personal exoeriences with friends in his hometown, Busan.\n\n7. The Wood (1999)\n\nWho's in it: Taye Diggs, Omar Epps, Richard T. Jones\n\nRun time: 106 minutes\n\nIt's not too often that I get to see a film that explores the messiness of male friendships, so I have a special appreciation for this gem. When Roland gets cold feet and suddenly disappears on his wedding day, it’s up to his closest pals, Mike and Slim, to find him before the wedding begins. And along the way, they relive some of their wildest stories from their teenage years.\n\n8. Booksmart (2019)\n\nWho's in it: Kaitlyn Dever, Beanie Feldstein, Jessica Williams\n\nRun time: 102 minutes\n\nAfter spending the entirety of their high school years sticking their noses in books, close friends Amy and Molly decide to make up for lost time and squeeze as much fun as possible into a single night. As expected, mayhem ensues.\n\nRegarding the film's portrayal of Amy and Molly's bond, Dever told Gold Derby, “It was so refreshing to read a story about female friendship that was so true…I think we all have had that friend at one point in time. And the great thing about them is that they aren’t afraid that they’re smart. They’re not self-conscious about it. They are so proud, and they have so much drive.\"\n\n9. Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997)\n\nWho's in it: Mira Sorvino, Lisa Kudrow, Janeane Garofalo, Justin Theroux\n\nRun time: 91 minutes\n\nDesperate to impress their high school peers at their 10-year reunion, best friends Romy and Michele decide to pose as mega-successful women and lie about their careers. However, it’s only a matter of time before their classmates start to expose the cracks in their outlandish stories. The fashion inspo in this film is fantastic, and Kudrow and Sorvino's chemistry is so convincing that I nearly took them for real-life BFFs.\n\n10. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005)\n\nWho's in it: Alexis Bledel, Amber Tamblyn, Blake Lively, America Ferrera\n\nRun time: 118 minutes\n\nBased on the bestselling YA book, this movie follows Lena, Tibby, Bridget and Carmen, four close friends who try to stay connected while spending their first summer apart. The solution? A pair of jeans that magically fits each of them perfectly, despite their different body types.\n\nCurtis said, \"When I was a kid, finding confidence in the shape of my body was a tough thing to do in the early '00s. Magazines and TV shows glorified skinny bodies, but I’ll never forget the moment when America Ferrera, the curviest girl in the friend group, tried on the magic pants and they fit her like a glove. It made me feel seen and beautiful. A great film about friendship, connection and self-acceptance.\"\n\n11. Dumb and Dumber (1994)\n\nWho's in it: Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels\n\nRun time: 106 minutes\n\nWhen two dim-witted friends, Lloyd and Harry, find a suitcase full of money, they embark on a road trip to return it to the rightful owner—not knowing that they are being pursued by authorities and killers determined to get their hands on that suitcase. Is it borderline absurd? Yep. But does it also depict how friendships can overcome even the biggest challenges? Absolutely.\n\n12. Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (2004)\n\nWho's in it: John Cho, Kal Penn, Neil Patrick Harris, Paula Garces\n\nRun time: 87 minutes\n\nThe buddy comedy follows the misadventures of Harold and his best friend, Kumar as they set out to find a White Castle location after smoking marijuana and seeing one of their ads. Somehow, it turns into a bizarre trip that involves a stoned Neil Patrick Harris and an altercation with police—but you’ll be impressed by the smart humor. (Do yourself a favor and watch the entire franchise.)\n\n13. Thelma & Louise (1991)\n\nWho's in it: Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, Harvey Keitel\n\nRun time: 126 minutes\n\nEasily one of the best road trip movies of all time, the film follows Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer, two women who take a road trip to escape their dull lives…but it eventually turns out to be more than they bargained for. With feminist themes and amazing depictions of friendship, it’s easy to see why it won so many accolades.\n\n14. The Brothers (2001)\n\nWho's in it: Morris Chestnut, D.L. Hughley, Bill Bellamy, Shemar Moore\n\nRun time: 102 minutes\n\nThink Waiting to Exhale, except with four Black men, rather than four Black women.

Fox, Kimberly Elise, Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett Smith\n\nRun time: 122 minutes\n\nVivica A. Fox, Kimberly Elise, Queen Latifah and Jada Pinkett Smith star as four Black women, who are desperate for financial security. They all agree to rob a bank together, but when one heist turns into multiple, it puts their friendship to the test—and their futures at risk.\n\nTwo decades later, Fox got emotional while reflecting on the project. She told People, \"We made history together. I am so proud of the director, F. Gary Gray, who over 20 years ago when we made that film, he really was a stickler for making the storyline believable. He was so professional, we were throwing out pages, and rewriting it and making things work.\"\n\n17. Now and Then (1995)\n\nWho's in it: Demi Moore, Rosie O'Donnell, Melanie Griffith, Rita Wilson\n\nRun time: 102 minutes\n\nIf you're down for a thoughtful coming-of-age film about loss, friendship, body image and puberty, then I implore you to watch this classic.

Each of us has advantages and disadvantages in our lives, and to see these unlikely people helping one another through it, with warmth and humor, it strikes a chord.
