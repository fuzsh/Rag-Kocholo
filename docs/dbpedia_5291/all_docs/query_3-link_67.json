        "text": "Answered by Nicolas Pierre Boudreau (Lead & Rhythm Guitar, Bass) - OMNIVIDE\n\nWhat got you into music, and if you had not gotten into music what would you be doing today?\n\n- I’m from a very secluded part of the world in Nova Scotia, Canada so one of the few exciting things to do was play and write music. I had family members who showed me music from a very young age, bands like Liquid Tension Experiment, Stratovarius, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, etc got me hooked on what music felt like when you really love it. Once I picked up a guitar I knew I wanted to study and dedicate my life to playing and writing music, especially progressive metal/death metal.\n\n- If I wasn’t a musician I would find another art form to concentrate on!\n\nWhat do you like to do when you are not playing music and how does that influence your creativity?\n\n- I like to live a normal life outside of playing and listening to music, staying in good health and spending time with friends and family are really important. I think everyone has their own creative process, I use the world outside of music to refuel my spirit in order to practice steadily, I think going out in nature can rejuvenate a lot of creative blocks.\n\nHow long has your band been around?\n\n- We’ve been working on music since 2020 but we only started playing shows in 2023! Half the band used to be an Opeth cover band so that’s how we started playing together until we found the current members and started writing our own Omnivide songs eventually.\n\nWhere are you based out of and how did that influence your music?\n\n- We are based out of Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada which has one of the best metal scenes in the province so that has helped us kickstart things in an organic way, we can perfect our songs and live sound before we hit the road and play in new cities and provinces thanks to how welcoming everyone has been to us\n\nHow did you come up with the name of your band and what does it mean to you?\n\n- Every band practice for a couple of months we would suggest a couple of band names until we landed on Omnivide, the name is about all that is nothing, the existence of nothingness in our universe. Vide is a French word that means empty so it’s a play on words.\n\nTell me about your most memorable shows.\n\n- The most memorable show for me was the first time we played a local bar named Xeroz in Moncton, NB.\n\nSeeing a good turnout for our first show was a nice compliment to the reputation the band had as musicians and moving forward.\n\nWhat is your favorite venue to play at, and do you have any places you want to play that you have not already?\n\n- We don’t have a favorite venue yet because each show has a different vibe or sensation to it. We treat any crowd or any venue as if it were Royal Alber Hall. Playing at Club Soda in Montreal or at a big metal festival like Hellfest or Tuska Open Air would be amazing!\n\nIf you could play any show with any lineup, who would be on the ticket?\n\n- Necrophagist, Obscura, Children of Bodom, Blotted Science, The Black Dahlia Murder, Alkaloid, Death, Symphony X, Wintersun\n\nWhat is some advice that you would give to someone who is just getting into playing in a band and some advice that you would give to your younger self?\n\n- You might not start and end up with the same musicians around you so just keep working on your craft and you’ll eventually find the right group of people to play with. I would tell my younger self to do more improv solo practice sessions.\n\nIf you could go back in time and give yourselves advice, what would it be?\n\n- If I could go back in time I would tell myself not to worry about what people think of your art, or if they can keep up just keep focusing on yourself and you’ll get to where you want to be\n\nOf your songs which one means the most to you and why?\n\nA Tale Of Fire means the most to me simply because it’s the first time in my life where I felt like I had a group of musicians that believed in my writing and wanted to push themselves technique/music wise with me, it made the writing process free of judgment.\n\nWhich songs are your favorite to play and which get requested the most?\n\n- Every member has a favorite song to play, my favorite is Desolate or Opulence\n\nWhat is the creative process for the band, and what inspires you to write your music?\n\n- We tend to write our songs on guitar pro until it sounds like a complete song ready to record, We demo the songs at home and just fine tune them until it sounds the way we envision our music, There’s a wide range of writing and playing techniques that make writing metal the most fulfilling. I like to write songs I’m unable to play and after I’m done writing I will slowly learn it on guitar and show the band. Pushing instrument techniques and being a fan of all sorts of metal makes the writing process for each song different. We believe that a record should be a good representation of where you are musically as musicians.\n\nWhat kinds of messages do you like to get across in your music?\n\n- How complex the meaning of life can be but to always be yourself and believe in the dreams you formulated throughout your life.\n\nDo you ever have disagreements in your band, and how do you get past them?\n\n- Everyone in the band has faith in the songs and whoever writes them, if we like the whole song then we know the song has something special to it, if someone does not like a song we keep working on it or we write a new one until everyone is happy!\n\nWhat are your plans for the future, and do you have anything that you want to spotlight that is coming up?\n\n- We would like to finish writing the second Omnivide album in 2024 so that there isn't a huge time frame between albums. We have a tour coming up in April you can check our socials for more details!\n\nOmnivide.ca | Facebook.com/OmnivideBand | Instagram.com/omnivide_band\n\nLinktr.ee/omnivide | Omnivide.bandcamp.com | Distrokid.com/hyperfollow/omnivide/holy-killer\n\nLyric Video - Holy Killer -"
