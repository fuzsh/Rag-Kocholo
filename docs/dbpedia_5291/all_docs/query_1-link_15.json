        "text": "In 1982 Tuomo Lassila (drums) formed STRATOVARIUS and came up with its name. Timo Tolkki (guitar) and Antti Ikonen (keyboards) joined the band in 1984, that is some 25 years ago and as a result the group recorded such classic albums as Twilight Time, Dreamspace and Fourth Dimension. After the departure of Lassila and Ikonen in 1995, Stratovarius went to more neo-classical sound and style exploring Timo Tolkki's song-writing and producing skills earning the band a Finnish Grammy and sales exceeding over two million records. After Tolkki's departure from Stratovarius in the late 2007 an idea was born to get the classic Dreamspace line up together for an album. As a result the summer 2009 will be spent writing and demoing songs for a late 2009 release tentatively titled as: PROJECT STRATO: Return To Dreamspace. This album will see Timo Tolkki handling the vocals again and the fans of the Twilight Time/Dreamspace era will surely not be disappointed.\n\nFor more info visit www.myspace.com/projectstrato."
