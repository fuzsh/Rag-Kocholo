        "text": "When you’re out of ideas, reunite an original lineup!\n\nIt all began 34 years ago when the Dreamspace lineup of Stratovarius emerged onto the music scene. Now, they have regrouped with a new identity, Timo Tolkki’s Strato. Timo Tolkki (vocals, guitar), Tuomo Lassila (drums), and Antti Ikonen (keyboards) – the original members who recorded the iconic albums Fright Night, Twilight Time, Dreamspace, and Fourth Dimension – have reunited. Dreamspace, released in 1994, marked the final album featuring Timo Tolkki on lead vocals and included beloved tracks like “Chasing Shadows,” “Hold On To Your Dream,” “We Are The Future,” and “Wings Of Tomorrow.” Prior to focusing solely on guitar, Tolkki contributed his vocals to the Fourth Dimension album demos and later recruited Timo Kotipelto as the vocalist. Fourth Dimension boasted standout tracks such as “Against The Wind,” “Distant Skies,” “Galaxies,” and “Twilight Symphony.”\n\nSee the announcement from the man himself below.\n\nDuring the summer of 2022, Timo Tolkki, Tuomo Lassila, and Antti Ikonen met and decided to revive the original lineup, giving birth to Timo Tolkki’s Strato. They have secretly rehearsed in Tuomo’s garage, a return to their roots, since January 2023. This reassembled group has inked a deal with Warner Music Japan and is currently in the process of recording their debut album, titled Return To Dreamspace, scheduled for release on October 27th, 2023. The album will be preceded by the single “(Is This The) Brave New World?”\n\nExciting plans are underway, including a Japanese Tour in spring 2024. Additionally, Timo Tolkki will visit Japan in November 2023 to promote the album, marking his first visit since 2007. Tours of Latin America and Europe are also in the pipeline. During their live performances, the band will showcase songs from Return To Dreamspace, as well as favorites from the Stratovarius albums Fright Night, Twilight Time, and Dreamspace.\n\nEric Cerda, Timo Tolkki’s manager, describes the new music as a blend of the classic Dreamspace era with a contemporary touch for the 2020s. Fans of melodic power metal, a genre that Timo Tolkki’s Strato played a significant role in defining, will be thrilled by the band’s new songs. Especially for fans of early Stratovarius, the experience promises to be particularly satisfying.\n\nBack in 1984, Tuomo Lassila founded Stratovarius in Helsinki and, together with original guitarist Staffan Stråhlman, coined the band’s name. A year later, Timo Tolkki joined the group. The debut album Fright Night, released through CBS Finland, marked the beginning of one of the most successful stories in melodic metal history. Albums like Fright Night (1989), Twilight Time (1993), Dreamspace (1994), and Fourth Dimension (1995) established Stratovarius as pioneers of the power metal genre.\n\nTimo Tolkki’s contribution to the band was immense, having penned over 100 songs before embarking on a successful solo career in 2008. His compositions, including power metal anthems like “Black Diamond,” “Hunting High and Low,” “Speed of Light,” “Paradise,” “Forever,” and “Destiny,” have sold over 4 million copies of the Tolkki-era Stratovarius albums."
