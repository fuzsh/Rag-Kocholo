        "text": "Mentalize Productions announces Timo Tolkki / Neil Turbin Villians & Vagabonds US Tour 2021.\n\nTimo Tolkki and Neil Turbin will be heading out on a North American tour in October and early November 2021. Tour dates will include major US cities.\n\nTimo and Neil are currently writing new songs together and collaborating on new material. They will be performing the hits of their music history collectively: Stratovarius, Revolution Rennaisance, Symphonia, Avalon, DeathRiders, Bleed The Hunger and Anthrax. They will announce the complete tour dates soon and the bandmembers joining them for this tour and recording.\n\nTimo Tapio Tolkki is a Finnish musician best known as the former guitarist, singer, songwriter and producer of the power metal band Stratovarius. With his tenure lasting for more than twenty years, he was the longest standing member of the band before his departure in 2008. After leaving Stratovarius he formed two supergroups named Revolution Renaissance and Symfonia, both of which have since disbanded. In a 2011 article by Guitar World magazine, Tolkki was included in the all-time top 50 list of the world's fastest guitarists\n\nDeathriders featuring Neil Turbin - Vocals, Jonas Hornqvist - Guitar, Richard Svard - Bass, Matt Thompson (King Diamond) - Drums, has released their debut single and video produced by King Diamond's guitarist Andy La Rocque at Sonic Train Studios. The track is taken from the forthcoming Deathriders' debut album 'The Metal Beast'. Video was edited by Jimmy Kay of The Metal Voice and was shot on location at the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas and Sonic Train Studios, VARBERG, Sweden..\n\nWatch Video Here\n\nPurchase song on Bandcamp here\n\nhttps://deathriders.bandcamp.com/releases\n\nNeil Turbin stated, \"The new song 'Never Surrender' combines power, melody, neoclassical and thrash in a way that I didn't have the opportunity to sing like I did on Fistful of Metal and Armed and Dangerous. I can't wait for everyone to hear our new album, the album is so diverse, there are many tracks leaning on the thrash side but there are also many tracks which are melodic and technical as well. DeathRiders packs a punch with a brilliant team of high precision players.\"\n\nNeil Turbin sang on ANTHRAX's debut LP, 1984's \"Fistful Of Metal\" wrote on Armed and Dangerous, Spreading the disease as well as participated on Anthrax's 40 year anniversary celebration Web series providing commentary into the bands history.\n\nNever Surrender was written by Neil Turbin / Jonas Hornqvist Whiskey Sky Music BMI ©️ 2021\n\nPhoto above by Robin Kaplin"
