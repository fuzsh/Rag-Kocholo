He played some slap, some tapping and some gorgeous, slow harmonic work that really focused on dynamics. One hell of a true talent. He played an ESP custom bass that looked very similar to a Fender Jazz 5-string through an Ampeg SVT-CL and an 8x10. Simple, effective rig. His style isn't as wild and insane as the departed Jari Kainulainen, he's much more focused.\n\nThe rest of the band played amazingly as well, seems all the turmoil of the last year has simply been totally forgotten. Intense, powerful show, truly professional.\n\nHoly crap where did this thread come from?? It's almost six years old!\n\nSince then, I've actually been on tour with Stratovarius and spilled beer all over Lauri Porra actually a really cool guy and an even better bassist than I originally thought. A truly versatile and consummate musician.\n\nAnd yeah, I've been busy with my final year of law school, so haven't had much time to come on HCBF... been busy with music stuff as well (currently in Germany recording our third album...) so yeah.\n\nDo miss you guys!\n\nIt's ok, I think I'll stick around for a while got another 2 weeks or so in the studio, which is in the middle of a Bavarian village with not much to do so I'll have time to post some more! What's new on the forum? Any interesting new characters? Any big forumites take off in a blaze of flamewars?\n\nNo real flame wars, but everyone seemed to disperse to several other forums and not come back after the Jive. I checked in every now and then, since this is the forum upgrade they should've done. Now I'm here checking in a bit more often, because Thumper really suckered me into becoming an HCBF mod.\n\nYou mean after the awful new format? I nearly took off as well... but this is a lot better. We all like a good bit of drama so no flame wars is vaguely disappointing Good to hear about Chloe!"
