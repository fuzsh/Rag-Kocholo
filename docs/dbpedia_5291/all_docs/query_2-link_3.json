        "text": "Finnish musician\n\nMusical artist\n\nTimo Antero Kotipelto (born 15 March 1969)[1] is a Finnish musician best known as the lead singer of the power metal band Stratovarius, whom he joined in 1994, as well as fronting his own band Kotipelto.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nHe studied vocals at the pop/jazz conservatory in Helsinki, briefly singing for an amateur cover band named Filthy Asses. In summer of 1994, he applied to Stratovarius, who were looking for a singer at the time, and was accepted. His arrival corresponds closely with the band's rise to international fame. The first album he recorded with the band was Fourth Dimension, in 1995. Stratovarius has then become a top name in the European heavy metal scene, recording seven more albums and performing in numerous notable rock festivals.\n\nIn late 2003, Kotipelto split from Stratovarius after intra-band disagreements, notably with guitarist Timo Tolkki. After much turmoil throughout 2004, he rejoined the band in January 2005, recorded the album Stratovarius, and performed live on tour that covered North America, South America, Europe and Asia. In 2008, Timo Tolkki made public that he and Timo Kotipelto had arguments but Kotipelto never really left the band and the announcement that he left was part of a big publicity stunt.[2]\n\nIn 2002 Kotipelto started his solo project, called Kotipelto. So far he has released three albums: \"Waiting For The Dawn\", \"Coldness\" and the last one, released 20 April 2007, \"Serenity\". Aside from Stratovarius and Kotipelto, Timo Kotipelto has also provided additional vocals to Sonata Arctica's Silence album along with lead vocals with his close friend, ex-Sonata Arctica guitarist Jani Liimatainen and his band Cain's Offering. and lead vocals for the song \"Out of the White Hole\", on Ayreon's 2000 release Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator.\n\nKotipelto also provided vocals for the track \"Eye of the Storm\" on Warmen's 2009 album Japanese Hospitality.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nWith Stratovarius\n\n[edit]\n\nFourth Dimension (1995)\n\nEpisode (1996)\n\nVisions (1997)\n\nThe Past and Now (Compilation, 1997)\n\nVisions of Europe (Live, 1998)\n\nDestiny (1998)\n\n\"Visions Of Destiny\" (DVD, 1999)\n\nThe Chosen Ones (Compilation, 1999)\n\nInfinite (2000)\n\n\"14 Diamonds - Best Of Stratovarius\" (Compilation, 2000)\n\nInfinite Visions (DVD, 2000)\n\nIntermission (2001)\n\nElements, Pt. 1 (2003)\n\nElements, Pt. 2 (2003)\n\nStratovarius (2005)\n\n\"Black Diamond: The Anthology\" (Compilation, 2006)\n\nPolaris (2009)\n\n\"Polaris live\" (2010)\n\nElysium (2011)\n\n\"Under Flaming Winter Skies (Live in Tampere - The Jörg Michael Farewell Tour)\" (DVD, 2012)\n\n\"Under Flaming Winter Skies – Live in Tampere\" (Live, 2012)\n\nNemesis (2013)\n\n\"Nemesis Days\" (DVD, 2014)\n\nEternal (2015)\n\nBest Of (2016)\n\nEnigma: Intermission 2 (2018)\n\nSurvive (2022)\n\nKotipelto\n\n[edit]\n\nWaiting for the Dawn (2002)\n\nColdness (2004)\n\nSerenity (2007)\n\nWith Cain's Offering\n\n[edit]\n\nGather the Faithful (2009)\n\nStormcrow (2015)\n\nKotipelto & Liimatainen\n\n[edit]\n\nBlackoustic (2012)\n\nGuest appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nWith Gamma Ray\n\n[edit]\n\nTime To Break Free Song live (1996)\n\nWith Tarot\n\n[edit]\n\nFor The Glory of Nothing (1998) – Backing vocals on 'Warhead' and 'Beyond Troy'\n\nWith Tunnelvision\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile The World Awaits (2000) - Backing vocals\n\nTimo Kotipelto and Klaus Flaming\n\n[edit]\n\nI Wanna Love You Tender (cover of Danny & Army) (2002)\n\nWith Warmen\n\n[edit]\n\nBeyond Abilities (2002) – Vocals on 'Spark' and 'Singer's Chance'\n\nAccept the Fact (2005) – Vocals on 'Invisible Power' and 'Puppet'\n\nJapanese Hospitality (2009) – Vocals on 'Eye of the Storm'\n\nWith Sonata Arctica\n\n[edit]\n\nSilence (2001) – Backing vocals and last line on 'False News Travel Fast'\n\nStones Grow Her Name (2012) – Backing vocals\n\nWith Klamydia\n\n[edit]\n\nSeokset (2003) – Vocals on 'Metanol Man'\n\nWith Ayreon\n\n[edit]\n\nUniversal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator (2000) – Vocals on 'Out of the White Hole (M31 – Planet Y – The Search Continues)'\n\nMonstervision Freakshow\n\n[edit]\n\nWelcome to Hellsinki (2007)\n\nWith Ella Ja Aleksi\n\n[edit]\n\nTakapihan Tavikset (2009)\n\nWith Leningrad Cowboys\n\n[edit]\n\nI Will Stay (2006)\n\nLet's Have A Party (2006)\n\nWith Amberian Dawn\n\n[edit]\n\nCircus Black (2012) – Vocals on 'Cold Kiss'\n\nWith Hevisaurus\n\n[edit]\n\nRäyhällistä joulua (2011) – Vocals on 'Pieni liekki'\n\nBändikouluun (2019) – Vocals on '100'\n\nWith Soulspell\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Second Big Bang (2017)\n\nThe End You'll Only Know at the End (2017)\n\nAlexandria (Apocalypse version) (2017)\n\nWith La suma de las partes\n\n[edit]\n\nVergel (2020) - Vocal on \"Rain In The Ocean\"\n\nWith Tarja\n\n[edit]\n\nFeliz Navidad (2017) - Vocal on \"Feliz Navidad\"\n\nFrom Spirits and Ghosts (Score for a Dark Christmas) (2020) - Vocal on \"Feliz Navidad (Barbuda Relief and Recovery Charity Version)\"\n\nWith Jani Liimatainen\n\n[edit]\n\nMy Father's Son (2022) - Vocal on \"Who Are We\" & \"Into The Fray\"\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
