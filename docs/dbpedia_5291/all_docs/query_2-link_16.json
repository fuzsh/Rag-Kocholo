        "text": "Former STRATOVARIUS, REVOLUTION RENAISSANCE and SYMFONIA mainman Timo Tolkki recently launched a PledgeMusic.com campaign to support the release of his fourth solo album, \"Classical Variations 2: Credo\". Tentatively due on October 29, 2012, the double album will include over two hours of music and will feature guest appearances by Michael Kiske (, HELLOWEEN),Jens Johansson (STRATOVARIUS),Derek Sherinian (BLACK COUNTRY COMMUNION, DREAM THEATER),Tuomo Lassila (the founder of STRATOVARIUS) on drums, Michael Vescera (OBSESSSION, LOUDNESS, YNGWIE MALMSTEEN) on vocals and Michele Luppi (THAUROROD, ex-VISION DIVINE) on vocals. In addition, Tolkki, Lassila and Antti Ikonen (original STRATOVARIUS keyboardist) will re-record 12 songs from the first three STRATOVARIUS albums for a separate CD called \"Dreaming In Twilight\". A digipack version of the \"Dreaming In Twilight\" album will include a bonus DVD featuring footage of Tolkki, Lassila and Ikonen performing those songs live in the studio recorded with six cameras.\n\nRe-recorded STRATOVARIUS songs to be included on the \"Dreaming In Twilight\" CD:\n\n* Future Shock\n\n* Witch Hunt\n\n* Night Screamer\n\n* The Hands Of Time\n\n* The Hills Have Eyes\n\n* Out Of The Shadows\n\n* 4th Reich\n\n* Abyss\n\n* Dreamspace\n\n* Eyes Of The World\n\n* Wings Of Tomorrow\n\n* Hold On To Your Dream\n\nFor more information, go to this location.\n\nPledgeMusic.com encourages fans to contribute funds to the recording of albums and the artists themselves to donate to charity as a part of their fundraising.\n\nTolkki recently made his \"Loneliness Of A Thousand Years\" book available for free download at this location.\n\nTolkki is most well-known for his music and thought-provoking lyrics. In many of his songs lies just a hint of the pain he has suffered that has shaped him into the artist he has become.\n\nIn the spring of 2004, Timo was overtaken by a nervous breakdown that caused him to be hospitalized. The next few years would completely engulf his life and leave him on the brink of suicide. \"Loneliness Of A Thousand Years\" candidly describes his heart-breaking journey through life and gives his fans just a glimpse into the intricate psyche of Timo Tolkki.\n\nWith a touching honesty, he describes his tumultuous childhood, his battle with a debilitating psychosis, and the philosophies that shape much of his deep thinking and views on the world. His story reveals the other side of the man that most people know only as the mastermind of STRATOVARIUS. It is an intimate portrait of his agony, as well as a probing look at an illness that affects millions, yet is widely misunderstood.\n\nWritten in a clear and compelling prose, \"Loneliness Of A Thousand Years\" is a bold, honest and ultimately uplifting look at the life of a man and his childhood, growing up as Timo Tolkki.\n\n\"Loneliness Of A Thousand Years\" was originally published in October 2010 via Goldenworks."
