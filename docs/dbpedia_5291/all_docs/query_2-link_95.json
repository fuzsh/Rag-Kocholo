        "text": "Rock'n'roll history is full of ego clashes between singers and guitarists. Think of the Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the Who's Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend and - perhaps definitively - Spinal Tap's David St Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel.\n\nOne pair that can be added to the list is Timo Kotipelto and Timo Tolkki of Nordic heavy metal band Stratovarius. The near break-up of the group before the recording of last year's Stratovarius - which they will be promoting tonight at Hitec - might have been modelled on the Spinal Tap movie, although Tap were less extreme.\n\nDuring a notable moment from Stratovarius' concert history, keyboardist Jens Johansson urinated on Tolkki's leg during a guitar solo. Johansson - a Swede who used to play with Yngwie Malmsteen - wasn't the only one with a grudge. 'At the time it was impossible for me to work with Tolkki,' says Kotipelto. 'I just thought he was an asshole.'\n\nIn the course of an epic series of arguments and bizarre incidents, various members of the group left or were sacked and Tolkki was treated for manic depression. 'It was the worst seven months of my life,' he says.\n\nTolkki and Kotipelto eventually sorted out their differences and decided to give the band another go. The former lineup of Tolkki, Kotipelto, Johansson, drummer Jorg Michael and bassist Jari Pedersen-Kainulainen reconvened, and a change in musical direction was agreed.\n\nStratovarius made their reputation playing so-called symphonic heavy metal. The music was grandiose and influenced by classical composers as well as heavy metal heroes such as Deep Purple and Black Sabbath. But the new album is straightforward, riff-driven hard rock, with little of the orchestration and big production of albums such as Elements Parts 1 and 2 and Destiny.\n\nHowever, the upheavals clearly aren't quite over. Since recording the album, Pedersen-Kainulainen has quit for 'personal reasons' and been replaced by Lauri Porra.\n\nManiac Dance, the single from the album, is based on Tolkki's experiences during his illness. 'Last year was a nightmare,' writes the guitarist, who continues to compose much of Stratovarius' music. 'I've dwelled in depths of darkness, swam across the ocean of pain.' Lyrics don't appear to be the band's strong point.\n\nThe response to the new music appears to be mixed. Some who liked the epic quality of Stratovarius' symphonic metal have found the new material disappointingly thin. Others who like their metal without the frills have welcomed it.\n\nStratovarius arrive in Hong Kong fresh from a tour of Japan. Assuming harmony still reigns within the ranks, the onstage fireworks should be confined to the music. But given the band's history, you never know\n\n'Things will never be normal,' says Kotipelto. 'But Stratovarius isn't a normal band, after all. We have this chemistry that fans seem to acknowledge and that's the most important thing.'\n\nStratovarius, today, 8pm, Hitec, Kowloon Bay, $350, $450, Tom Lee, Tsang Fook, Nelson Piano Co, HMV.
