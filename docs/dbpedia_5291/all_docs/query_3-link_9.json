It is the first Stratovarius album to feature bassist Lauri Porra and guitarist Matias Kupiainen, following former bassist Jari Kainulainen's departure from the band in 2005 and former guitarist Timo Tolkki's departure in 2008.\n\nTimo Kotipelto, who at the time of Polaris' release had been a member of Stratovarius the longest (since 1994) among the current members, considered Polaris to be \"the album that saved the band\" and said that \"without it there would not be any Stratovarius.\"[5] More time passed between the release of Stratovarius' eponymous album Stratovarius in 2005 and the release of Polaris than between any other two consecutive albums released by the band. Stratovarius in 2006[6] had recorded a demo album called Revolution Renaissance, performed one Revolution Renaissance song live in August 2007 (\"Last Night on Earth\") and according to Kotipelto had intended to release a completed version of the album in 2008.[7] However, the songs of that album were re-recorded and released in 2008 as New Era, the first album of Tolkki's new band, Revolution Renaissance, which acquired the album's prior name.\n\nPolaris reached No. 2 on the Finnish albums chart, as well as reaching the top 70 in five other countries.[1][8] \"Deep Unknown\" was released as a single, reaching No. 20 on the Finnish singles chart.[9] In its first week of release, the album sold around 800 copies in the U.S.[10]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nStratovarius\n\n[edit]\n\nTimo Kotipelto – lead vocals, background vocals, production\n\nMatias Kupiainen – guitar, background vocals, engineering (vocals, guitar, bass), production\n\nJens Johansson – keyboard, background vocals, engineering, production\n\nJörg Michael – drums, production\n\nLauri Porra – bass, background vocals, production\n\nAdditional credits\n\n[edit]\n\nSeppo Rautasuo – strings (track 11)\n\nHeikki Hämäläinen – strings (track 11)\n\nHeikki Vehmanen – strings (track 11)\n\nKari Lindstedt – strings (track 11)\n\nPerttu Vänskä – strings arrangement (tracks 1, 8), strings programming (tracks 1, 8), engineering (acoustic guitar; track 11), additional Pro Tools editing\n\nPessi Levanto – strings arrangement (track 11)\n\nAlexi Parviainen – background vocals\n\nMarko Waara – background vocals\n\nTipe Johnson – background vocals\n\nTony Kakko – background vocals\n\nTommi Vainikainen – engineering (strings; track 11)\n\nMikko Karmila – mixing\n\nMikko Raita – mixing (track 11)\n\nSvante Forsbäck – mastering\n\nRelease history\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing Polaris' original release, a Digipak edition was reissued on 21 May 2010, containing a bonus disc of live recordings from the 2009–10 Polaris world tour.[11]\n\nRegion Date Label Europe 15 May 2009 Edel[1] Japan Victor[12] United States Armoury[11] Europe (reissue) 21 May 2010 Edel[11]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nChart (2009) Peak\n\nposition Finnish Albums (Suomen virallinen lista)[13] 2 French Albums (SNEP)[14] 62 German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)[15] 55 Hungarian Albums (MAHASZ)[16] 32 Italian Albums (FIMI)[17] 47 Japanese Albums (Oricon)[18] 32 Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade)[19] 57 US Heatseekers Albums (Billboard)[20] 57\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
