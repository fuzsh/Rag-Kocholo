        "text": "Rinaldo Smordini and Franco Interlenghi in ‘Shoeshine’ (1946). Via Janus Films\n\n* * *\n\n“What [Vittorio] De Sica can do, I can’t do …,” Orson Welles averred after watching “Shoeshine” (1946): “the camera disappeared, the screen disappeared; it was just life.” What Welles couldn’t do, in this case, was allow himself the freedom — a kind of trust, really — to allow events to unfold before the camera with a minimum of cinematic derring-do. This was neorealismo and its tenets could not have been further from the Hollywood norm or, for that matter, the prerogatives of Welles’s ego.\n\nWhich isn’t to say that “Shoeshine,” which will be undergoing a two-week revival at Film Forum, is free of calculation. Neorealism was the Italian response to the deprivations of World War II. Cities had been reduced to rubble and the economy was troubled. With its infrastructure compromised, the Italian film industry couldn’t help but respond with a concomitant humility. An influential cadre of filmmakers sought to bring their metier back to basics.\n\nThey did so by shooting on location, working with nonprofessional actors, and telling stories predicated on the hardscrabble lives of ordinary people. Luchino Visconti’s “Ossessione” (1943), a riff on James M. Cain’s novel “The Postman Always Rings Twice,” is often cited as the first neorealist film for its unpicturesque take on the highways, byways, and landscape of Italy. Roberto Rossellini’s “Rome, Open City” (1945) would go on to make a splash internationally, not least because it embodied the post-war realities of the “Italian Spring.”\n\nDe Sica was among the primary adherents of neorealism. He began his career as an actor, working on the stage and establishing his own theater company at age 22. A deft hand at comedy, De Sica proved his mettle as a dramatic actor as well. He earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor in the otherwise forgettable “A Farewell to Arms” (1957), but achieved immortality for a bravura turn as the suave Baron Fabrizio Donati in Max Ophüls’s “The Earrings of Madame de … ” (1953). Actually, De Sica has a lot of immortality chits on his CV, especially as a director.\n\nWhile “Shoeshine” stands in the shadow of “Bicycle Thieves” (1948) and “Umberto D.” (1952), by general consensus the finest of De Sica’s neorealist efforts, it does have its adherents. Pegging it as “one of the greatest and most famous films of all time,” a critic for the New Yorker, Pauline Kael, went on to ask “if people cannot feel Shoeshine, what can they feel?” James Agee, in a contemporaneous review, stated that De Sica created “an awareness of the pitiful complexity of the causes of even simple evil.” The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences bestowed “Shoeshine” with the first award for Best International Feature Film.\n\nThe picture centers on two friends, the adolescent Pasquale (Franco Interlenghi) and the slightly younger Giuseppe (Rinaldo Smordoni). They make a meager living shining shoes — mostly, it seems, of American G.I.’s. Their dream is to purchase a horse, but not just any horse: They have their eyes on the swift and handsome Bersagliere. The asking price is high, as are the costs to keep the horse, but when Giuseppe’s older brother Attilio (a smarmy Annielo Mele) offers the boys a lucrative job fencing contraband, our heroes can’t resist. Bersagliere may be within their grasp.\n\nThe transaction doesn’t go quite as planned — due, largely, to Attilio’s scheming — but Pasquale and Giuseppe manage to bank the funds to buy Bersagliere. Just as their dream is realized, the boys are hauled in by the police, accused of theft, and summarily placed into juvenile detention. Their loyalty, both to family and each other, is put to the test as the adults-in-charge play fast-and-loose with protocol. They extract information from Pasquale through bogus means. Giuseppe, who’s been separated from his friend, attempts a prison break with a new batch of cronies.\n\nThe two friends are ultimately reunited, with each other and Bersagliere, but, remember, this is neorealism: Much as endings in real life don’t come with a guarantee of happiness, so it is with “Shoeshine.” Yet, on the whole, the film is less realistic than — well, “fanciful” isn’t the right word, but fantasy does enter into it. Notwithstanding cinematographer Anchisi Brizzi’s emphasis on grit and dirt, he simultaneously suffuses the proceedings with a fairytale-like aura, a romantic haze that diminishes the story’s realismo. It doesn’t help that the prison warders, gargoyles almost to a man, are cartoonish in appearance and performance.\n\nThere is, in other words, a reason “Shoeshine” doesn’t survive as a primary exemplar of neorealism: The injustices it seeks to underline are too self-evidently moralistic and its characters less flesh-and-blood than points on a graph. De Sica’s way with children, all of whom were non-professional actors, is where the film thrives: Their unaffectedness grounds the movie in exactly the manner in which the neorealists intended. But the couching of their story is — well, it’s something Welles could have done. “Shoeshine” is a fine film, but there are better places to start with De Sica.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the June 11, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nSo, how do you think it is going with the legalization of cannabis? As “exotics” boutiques pop up with all the abundance and ubiquity of corporate chains like Dunkin’ and CVS, the streets of Manhattan have become notorious for the ever-present smell of marijuana. Granted, New York City has never been lacking in pungent odors, but for those of us who have remained unmoved by the pleasures of a random doobie, the dankification of our streets has proved, if not altogether intolerable, then close to it.\n\nHow all this plays out in terms of economics and sociology is outside of my purview, but the release of director Ariel Vida’s “Trim Season” is a marker of how everyday marijuana usage has become. Among the notable aspects of Ms. Vida’s “cannabis infused horror film” is the adoring manner in which Luka Bazeli’s camera pans over fields of marijuana, imbuing them with a golden haze that is somewhere between an idyllic landscape by Claude Lorrain and a Hallmark card. That, and our characters light up their blunts at the drop of a hat — morning, noon, and night.\n\nWe have, in other words, come a long way since the alarmist hyperbole of “Reefer Madness” (1936), a cautionary opus that has long been a camp favorite. Then again, given what goes down in “Trim Season,” maybe not. Although much of the dialogue could’ve been lifted from an advisory pamphlet published by NORML — you remember, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws — the overall gist of Ms. Vida’s picture is less than commendatory. Reefer, we learn, causes madness.\n\nBereft of the cannabis underpinnings, “Trim Season” is a conventional outing, the kind of thing that would’ve earned hoots-and-hollers at the drive-in or local grindhouse back in the day. Emma (Bethlehem Million) is a 20-year-old with not much on her plate: She’s unfocused, recently unemployed and four months behind on the rent. Best friend Julia (Alex Essoe, rangy and appealing) treats her to a night of clubbing, cocktails, and, yes, a dollop of skank.\n\nWhile out on the town, Emma and Julia meet James (Mark Senter), a recruiter for a marijuana farm out in the highlands of California. When he finds out that our heroines are in need of cold hard cash, James suggests that they put in a couple of weeks as trimmers: that is to say, farmhands whose metier is the process of separating the wheat from the chaff, or something like it, anyway. The work is laborious, sticky, and tough on the hands, but the pay is good — particularly if you’re a Gen Zer in desperate straits.\n\nEmma and Julia decide to hitch their fortunes to James, and meet up with a cadre of other young folks out to make a buck: the tough-as-nails Lex (Juliette Kenn De Balinthazy), the gender-indeterminate Dusty (Bex Taylor-Klaus), and Harriet (Ally Ioannides), who is, in equal parts, goofy and goth. James unceremoniously lumps them into the back of his van and brings them to an isolated ranch deep in the forest. Their accommodations are bare bones, the working conditions same, and the hours long. Yet they are catered to by the farm’s owner, the imperious and mysterious Mona (Jane Badler). She’s a shady piece-of-work, our Mona. Ms. Badler bites into the role with palpable relish.\n\nWhat we have, then, is typical horror movie fodder: a bunch of stupid kids trapped in the woods with a crazy adversary. How crazy? When Harriet steals and subsequently smokes Mona’s private stash — well, suffice it to say that taking a toke of weed the color of blood isn’t a positive life decision. Once it becomes obvious that witchery is afoot, the chase is on.\n\nMs. Vida’s thriller is less inventive than it is enthusiastic, and even then, the picture lopes along in a manner that is semi-coherent and overwrought. Anyone who measures life in terms of trending memes will find it relevant and possibly rewarding. Genre fans out for a thrill may forgive the narrative’s convenient lapses in logic.\n\nIf you’re not a member of the target audience, stay away. Still, as a signpost of how the times they are a-changin’, “Trim Season” is its own kind of marker.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the June 7, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nAmong the Sophia Loren films not included in “Sophia Loren: La Signora di Napoli,” a 13-film retrospective mounted by Film at Lincoln Center, is Melville Shavelson’s “Houseboat” (1958). The curatorial team responsible for this series — its members include Florence Almozini and Tyler Wilson from the host institution and their colleagues at Cinecittà, Paola Ruggiero, Camilla Cormanni, and Marco Cicala — have done well in their choices, with pictures culled from a period covering a whopping 66 years. Still, there’s a reason they didn’t pick “Houseboat.”\n\nEven a talent as luminous as Ms. Loren can’t help but have a number of bum steers in an oeuvre adding up to a hundred movies. So, yeah, “Houseboat” isn’t great, being a sappy comedy in which our 24-year-old starlet was romantically paired with a man a good three decades older, Cary Grant. Age inappropriateness is the least of the picture’s problems, but among its virtues is “Bing! Bang! Bong!,” a transcendently inane number that Ms. Loren sings to irresistible effect. “Presto, Presto/Do your very besto.…” Spare yourself “Houseboat” and find the song online.\n\nWas Ms. Loren the first international movie star? Film at Lincoln Center and Cinecittà qualify the claim with a neatly placed “perhaps,” but we know the drill: The actress’s appeal can’t be contained within the purview of anything so mundane as human initiative. Designated Miss Elegance at the 1950 edition of the Miss Italia beauty pageant, 15-year-old Sophia went on to attend the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome and started garnering bit parts as “girl kidnapped” or “Lygia’s slave” in various entertainments.\n\nThe earliest films on the docket at Film at Lincoln Center date from 1954: Mario Matolli’s “Poverty and Nobility” and Alessandro Blassetti’s “Too Bad She’s Bad.” Both are comedies and the latter is the first of 17 movies in which Ms. Loren is paired with Marcello Mastroianni.\n\nThe chemistry between the two stars is as natural as Ms. Loren’s character, Lina Stroppiani, is duplicitous. She’s a thief in a family of thieves — even nonna picks a mean pocket — and proves nettlesome to cabbie Paolo Silvestrelli (Mastroianni). There’s real joy to be had in this screwball romance, not least the silky performance by Vittorio De Sica as Lina’s father, “The Professor.” And, yes, there is a vaguely familiar song that filters through the film: “Bingo, Bango, Bongo.”\n\nMs. Loren won an Oscar for De Sica’s “Two Women” (1961), the first time the honor went to an actress in a foreign-language film. It’s a deceiving and, in the end, excruciating picture. Notwithstanding the context of a war-torn Italy, the story has a comedic bent — what with its colorful array of stock characters and farcical set pieces. Ms. Loren plays it to the hilt as Cesira, the headstrong and brassy mother to Rosetta (Eleanora Brown), a devout and sickly 12-year-old. Yet the story takes a dramatic turn, at which point Ms. Loren puts her star power in the service of human dignity placed under unspeakable strain.\n\nAmong the American features included are Stanley Donen’s “Arabesque” (1966), a Hitchcockian thriller co-starring Gregory Peck, and Robert Altman’s “Prêt-à-Porter” (1994), in which a 60-year-old Ms. Loren, with Mastroianni in tow, replicates the famous striptease scene from “Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow” (1963). She also essayed the title role in Charlie Chaplin’s final film, “A Countess From Hong Kong” (1967), a picture that was roundly decried upon its release, but has been undergoing some critical reappraisal.\n\nWill it be the standout of “La Signora da Napoli?” New Yorkers will have 13 chances to find out. With Ms. Loren, those odds can’t help but pay off handsomely.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the June 6, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nHere’s a prediction: Critics will twist themselves into knots while trying to spin the adjective “Kafkaesque” when writing about a six-episode television series soon to be streaming on ChaiFlicks, “Kafka.”\n\nHow redolent is this Austrian-made venture of the neurasthenic absurdism typifying the writings by the doomed Czech modernist? Literature and film are two very different mediums: Attempts by Orson Welles and Michael Haneke to adapt Kafka’s vision to the silver screen have proven, if not uninteresting, then decidedly lumpy.\n\nIs Kafka at all capable of being transformed into extra-literary media? Comedy mavens may recall Zero Mostel, as the Broadway huckster Max Bialystock in Mel Brooks’s “The Producers” (1967), rifling through a slush pile of bad plays, picking up a portfolio and reading aloud the following sentence: “As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.” Bialystock wrinkles his nose, does a slight shake of the head, and comments: “It’s too good.” Thus, into the trash goes “The Metamorphosis.”\n\n“Kafka” is the work of writer Daniel Kehlman — “Measuring the World” (2005) is likely the best known of his novels — and David Schalko, an Austrian filmmaker with no little chutzpah. His didactically titled “M — A City Hunts a Murderer” (2019), dared to make a TV miniseries out of Fritz Lang’s cinematic masterpiece “M” (1931).\n\nThen again, art is nothing without chutzpah, and the cinematic liberties taken by Messrs. Kehlman and Schalko in “Kafka” are nonetheless bolstered by fact. Their guide post was the author of a multi-volume and, by some lights, definitive biography of Kafka, Reiner Stach. Scholars will undoubtedly have something to say about the veracity of the series. A couple of literary lights have already chimed in: Salman Rushdie and Ian McEwan. “Perfectly cast, stunningly acted,” the former writes; the latter describes the series as “simply brilliant.”\n\nThe first episode of “Kafka” details the author’s dying wish: that the entirety of his corpus be destroyed. The executor of the Kafka estate, Max Brod, his friend and fellow writer, famously refused to follow the directive. Through some clever and surprisingly effective feints of fiction, Messrs. Kehlman and Schalko give us a rough trajectory of Brod’s betrayal, the most dramatic moment being the safe carriage of Kafka’s personal papers on the last train out of Prague before the Nazi occupation.\n\nMessrs. Kehlman and Schalko, likely working in the presumed spirit of Kafka, have shaped the series in a nonlinear fashion. Each segment centers on a person or entity important to Kafka’s life; these include not only Brod, but his family, three paramours, and his workplace — or, as the title of episode four ominously puts it, “The Bureau.” The aim of Messrs. Kehlman and Schalko was to lessen, if not altogether remove, the haze of myth that invariably attends to a significant artist. Kafka was, they suggest, something other than merely a “Jewish Kabbalistic prophet.” He did, after all, make a go of it in the real world.\n\nThe glimpses we get of Kafka’s time as an insurance lawyer in “The Bureau” is that of a productive individual whose idiosyncrasies serve his employers well. Sure, he complains about how the work is taking time away from his writing, but Kafka does have a head — or, as it is said politely nowadays, “special interest” — in the minutiae of the law. The higher-ups are happy with his performance and exhibit no qualms in giving Kafka a raise. Neither do they show restraint in fobbing off their amateur efforts at poetry and literature on the star employee.\n\nA lot of evident care has been invested in “Kafka.” Production design, cinematography, and accompanying music are handsomely contrived and appropriate to both the time-frame of the picture and what can only be called its psychological ambiance. Although Mr. Schalko isn’t beyond postmodernist narrative tics, his focus stays true to the characters and the mise en scene: imagine a David Lynch phantasmagoria leavened with the decorative ambiance of Edouard Vuillard. This is a lush entertainment, lovely to look at and ready to be savored.\n\nThe cast is uniformly solid — especially David Kross, who is given a lot of heavy lifting to do as Brod — though some casting decisions are dubious. Having the lovely Verena Altenberger don a mustache and men’s clothing as the novelist Robert Musil strikes a jarring note. Franz knew better than to upset a carefully tendered fiction with anything so crass as ideological fashion. As it is, Mssrs. Kehlman and Schalko do right more often than not by a “Kafka” that is, if not Kafkaesque, then a marked cut above the standard cinematic biography.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was published in the June 4, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nLet’s cut to the chase: Elmer Bernstein’s score for John Sturges’s “The Magnificent Seven” (1960) is significantly better than the movie in which it was featured. If you think you don’t know Bernstein’s rousing theme song, don’t fool yourself: You do.\n\nThat propulsively stuttering rhythm coupled with that sweeping, ascendant melody: They’ve been embedded in our pop culture DNA. Bernstein’s piece has been the subject of scholarly tracts, poached upon for advertising, and paid homage to and or/satirized by a daunting number of entertainers. Have you heard “Magnificent Ska” by the Skatalites? Bet you didn’t know that cowboys could skank.\n\nAs we’re overstating the obvious, let’s also note that “The Magnificent Seven” isn’t esteemed as highly as its inspiration, Akira Kurosawa’s “Seven Samurai” (1954). Kurosawa was sometimes considered the most Western of Japanese filmmakers — a reason being, one could suppose, that he was profoundly influenced by a director of Westerns, John Ford. So what did Kurosawa make of the American remake? One story has him bestowing a samurai sword on Sturges as a measure of admiration; other reports have Kurosawa slagging off the picture as “a disappointment.”\n\nConflicting accounts don’t necessarily exclude the truth: Kurosawa had his opinions, just as he was possessed of a degree of politesse. What is more certain is that critics at the time didn’t think much of “The Magnificent Seven.” The Times found it “pallid, pretentious and overlong”; Variety, “long and cluttered.” Even the kindest of commendations proved mild. The box office receipts stateside were similarly soft. Internationally, though, Sturges’s oater proved hugely successful, not least in the Soviet Union. Could audiences in the USSR have been pulling for the Vladivostok-born Brynner?\n\nShout! Factory will be releasing a steel-box edition of “The Magnificent Seven,” a package that will include a 4K restoration as well as commentaries by James Coburn, Eli Wallach, and a British culture maven, Sir Christopher Frayling. The critical consensus on the film has improved over the years, largely because of its indomitable cast. Brynner was a known quantity back in the day, what with winning an Oscar as best actor for “The King And I” (1956), but Steve McQueen? Just another television hack at that point. As for Charles Bronson and James Coburn: still minor players both. Retrospect does wonders for star power.\n\nThe plot is simple. Representatives of a Mexican village seek outside help in fending off the villainous Calvera (Eli Wallach, chewing the scenery). Backed by his ruthless gang of banditos, Calvera repeatedly takes advantage of the farmers and their peaceful ways, raiding the community for foodstuffs and supplies. When Calvera up and shoots a citizen in a fit of pique, the villagers decide enough is enough. On the advice of the township’s unnamed éminence grise (Vladimir Sokoloff in oracle mode), three men set out to procure arms.\n\nUpon traveling to the U.S., our emissaries meet Chris Adams (Brynner), a gunslinger of persuasive character and fashion-forward all in black. After convincing them that “men are cheaper than guns,” Chris corrals six roustabouts of various skill sets whose moral compasses, in the end, turn out to be stronger than their avarice.\n\nThe selection process is among the picture’s high points — the scene in which we’re introduced to Coburn’s character will be manna for those who like their mythos lean, mean, and funny — and the Seven’s first encounter with Calvera and company is as satisfying as it’s intended to be. Good guys are good and bad guys are bad: Would that life were that simple.\n\nBut then there’s the third act, in which grit, gumption, and gunplay are compromised by audience-pleasing gimcrackery: a love interest here, cute children there, and a reminder that our heroes are soft and cuddly. That, and the final stand-off is oddly anticlimactic: George Lucas did a better job when he appropriated it for “Star Wars.”\n\n“The Magnificent Seven” is less than magnificent, but should you be pining for some old Hollywood swagger, it will do in a pinch.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the May 31, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nWhile no one should go mistaking “The Chase” (1946) as an exemplar of film noir, anyone interested in the genre will likely find it worthwhile, if also notably cockeyed. Kino Lorber, which is releasing a Blu-ray of the movie, is pitching it as “something truly mind-bending and surreal” — basically a polite acknowledgment that the film is something less than the sum of its parts.\n\nStill, it is “something” that imbues those parts with a distinctive weirdness. How true is “The Chase” to the Cornell Woolrich novel, “The Black Path of Fear,” on which it was based? Fans of classic American cinema will note that Woolrich authored “It Had To Be Murder,” the 1942 short story that inspired Alfred Hitchcock’s “Rear Window” (1954). The pathway to film from literature is rarely straightforward. “The Chase” is its own creature.\n\nThe reasons for that can’t help but be as numerous as a collaborative art form allows. The producer on the movie was Seymour Nebenzal, a German Jew who fled his home country in 1933 and worked with notable filmmakers like G.W. Pabst, Douglar Sirk, and Fritz Lang. The director of “The Chase,” Arthur Ripley, began his career as a writer for a comedy kingpin, Mack Sennett, and at one time had a close working relationship with Frank Capra.\n\nHow Ripley, who had made films with comedians Harry Langdon, Edgar Kennedy, and W.C. Fields, got a name for noir is a good question. “Voice on the Wind” (1944), starring a largely forgotten matinee idol, Frances Lederer, proved he could direct a serious film, and “The Chase” is more inventive than a mid-level production might lead you to believe. Ripley proved adroit in his use of blocking and, especially, the deployment of mirrors. A sharp sense of displacement, both physical and psychological, filters through the movie.\n\nThen there’s Robert Cummings, an actor of affable, if somewhat indeterminate, affect who had a significant career, including on television: a sitcom, “The Bob Cummings Show,” ran for five seasons on, alternately, NBC and CBS. In “The Chase,” Cummings plays Chuck Scott, a World War II vet down on his luck. We first see him standing outside the window of a cafe. He’s eyeing a skillet full of pancakes and bacon, and hasn’t a penny to his name.\n\nFate intervenes when Bob stumbles over a wallet and uses part of its largesse to buy breakfast. Bob is an honest man: After digging out a business card from the wallet, he seeks out its owner. Upon arriving at the address, Bob is greeted warily, having to confront two personages — or, rather, their disassociated eyes — through the peephole in the front door. Movie fans will immediately recognize the voice belonging to the second eye as Peter Lorre. In noir terms, this bodes well.\n\nLorre plays Gino, the right-hand man for a ruthless gangster and, from all appearances, enthusiastic collector of antique statuary, Eddie Roman (Steve Cochran). When Chuck returns the wallet, Roman is bemused; when Chuck admits spending some of the money, Roman is taken aback. Anyone who is that much of a simp should be trustworthy, right? Roman hires Bob as his chauffeur and puts him to the test in a limousine that has been specially outfitted with a hidden gas pedal and brake in the rear of the car. Plot contrivance, anyone?\n\nLess contrived and more important is Roman’s wife, Lorna. As portrayed by French actress Michèle Morgan, Mrs. Roman is the Hollywood ideal of womanly pulchritude — what with those cheekbones, blonde mane, and regal bearing. Maybe she’s too ideal: Lorna is a pro forma femme fatale. It’s hard to know if that was at the script’s insistence or because of Morgan’s facility with English. Whatever the case, Bob is roped into her orbit and the two attempt to escape the clutches of Roman and Gino, with dreams of life in exotic Havana.\n\nWhat happens next is highly disappointing, as the film takes an out that is unwieldy and close to nonsensical. Through convolutions that aren’t worth spoiling, we learn that Bob suffers from “anxiety neurosis” — in contemporary terms, PTSD — and is prone to hallucinations. Except that these hallucinations are indicative less of Bob’s psyche than the desperation of screenwriter Philip Yordan to find something, anything, to tie together a lot of loose ends.\n\nRipley, to his credit, maintains a sense of momentum throughout and Cumming, forever the pro, gives his all to the effort. Lorre snarks around the proceedings in good form and cinematographer Frank F. Planer bestows it all with silky gradations of light. “The Chase” isn’t a must-see, but should you make time for it, the rewards outnumber its liabilities.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the May 29, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nA film critic tasked with writing about the umpteenth remake of “Night of the Living Dead” (1968) can be forgiven for approaching the assignment with trepidation. Does the world need another zombie movie?\n\nThe original film alone launched six sequels helmed by the man who started it all, writer and director George Romero. Then there are the remakes, the reimaginings, and rip-offs, plus the satires, the series, and something called “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.” The latter was a novel, a movie, a video game, and a Broadway musical. Okay, “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies” wasn’t on Broadway, but don’t think it couldn’t happen.\n\nTechnically speaking, “Handling the Undead” is an adaptation of a 2005 novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist. A writer specializing in horror, Mr. Lindqvist adapted his first book, “Let the Right One In” (2004), for a film directed by Tomas Alfredson. The resulting picture went on to win a host of international awards and almost universal acclaim. Critic Roger Ebert dubbed it “the best modern vampire movie.”\n\n“Let the Right One In” was at a distinct remove from the typical genre movie; so, too, is “Handling of the Undead.” Mr. Lindqvist is back on hand adapting his 2009 novel of the same name, this time in collaboration with the film’s director, Thea Hvistendahl. What they’ve crafted is not showy or typical, though it is unsettling. Zombies? Yeah, they’re here — if not in abundance, then certainly to be dealt with. Yet are they to be feared? Mr. Lindqvist and Ms. Hvistendahl hold off on answering the question, and in doing so they end up exploring the lengths to which human beings will go to hold on to the memories of those dear to them.\n\nTales of the supernatural are, to one degree of profundity or another, meditations on mortality. The original “Night of the Living Dead” encompassed salient themes, some of which were expected (zombies are no damned good) and some of which were not (the ramifications of societal tumult). “Handling the Undead” explores terrain that is considerably more intimate. Here is a zombie picture touched by what can only be described as Norwegian reserve.\n\nThe basic setup of “Handling the Undead” is the same as “Night of the Living Dead”: an unknown occurrence — an extraterrestrial phenomenon, it seems — causes the recently deceased to be not so deceased. Unlike the lumbering zombies of yore, the monsters we encounter here are passive. The entire notion of “monstrous” is, at least initially, held at arm’s length. Tenderness is a recurring theme, though extremity ultimately puts it to the test. This is a picture marked by quietude and gentleness.\n\nThe focus is on three families, each of whose stories are intercut and overlapped. Anna (Renate Reinsve, star of “The Worst Person in the World”) lives with her father Mahler (Bjørn Sundquist); both are mourning the loss of Anna’s young son. Tora (Bente Børsum) is acclimating to life after the loss of her partner Elisabet (Olga Damani). As for Eva (Bahar Pars) and David (Anders Danielsen Lie): They’re about to celebrate the birthday of their son Kian (Kian Hansen). As it turns out, Eva ends up dying in an automobile accident. But then she turns out not to be dead….\n\nMs. Hvistendahl’s picture is sparse with words, patient in build-up, and, in its beginning moments, frustratingly diffuse. Those who stick with the film’s pacing will find themselves caught up in the filmmakers’ doleful, transformative logic. There’s a Bergmanesque gravitas to the proceedings, an almost lyrical accumulation of portent and emotion that is only fleetingly spoiled when Ms. Hvistendahl stoops to gratuitous zombie precedent. Overall, though, she keeps her picture on the one, making for an auspicious debut and a horror movie of rare and pensive merit.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the May 27, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nIs it just me, or did Henry Fonda never look quite as handsome, as rugged and virile, as he’s seen in “The Tin Star” (1957)? When we initially encounter Fonda’s character, bounty hunter Morgan Hickman, he’s some combination of sunburnt and grimy, with each crag of his 52-year-old face given emphasis and definition. That he comes equipped with dialogue as pithy as a bumper-sticker and infinitely more pointed increases his magnetism. A limited edition Blu-ray package of director Anthony Mann’s “timeless Western” is now available.\n\nCan one detect within Hickman the seed of Fonda’s turn as Frank, the villain of Sergio Leone’s “Once Upon a Time in the West” (1968)? Hickman rides into town with a corpse in tow, being a firm believer that outlaws are better brought to justice dead than alive. The local townsfolk don’t much cotton to this outsider and his mercenary ways. Hickman makes it plain he’s in it for the money. Once the payout arrives, he’ll be on his way.\n\nA bucolic place, this unnamed outpost of civilization: though the streets are dusty, the citizens take pride in maintaining their homes, businesses, and gardens. Granted, the new sheriff, Ben Owens (Anthony Perkins), is a mite green and eager to prove himself a legitimate lawman. His gal Millie (Mary Webster) isn’t keen on Ben being sheriff, given that her father was the previous holder of that office and met his demise in the line of duty. The town doctor, Joseph J. “Doc” McCord (John McIntire), has hopes for the couple all the same.\n\nThe glitch in this sunny setting is Bart Bogardus (Neville Brand); he’s a bully, a racist, and a dab hand at organizing lynch mobs. Things become glitchier when Ed McGaffey (Lee Van Cleef) and his brother Zeke (Peter Baldwin) are implicated in the robbery of a stagecoach and two attendant murders. Sheriff Owens is adamant that the men be captured and brought to town for a fair trial. Bogardus, ever belligerent, thinks otherwise. Hickman, a former lawman and full-time cynic, takes it all in with a jaundiced eye.\n\nMann, working from a terse script by Dudley Nichols, brings his A-game to the proceedings, endowing it with a fluidity that never shortchanges the telling detail. The thing is, “The Tin Star” isn’t an A-movie — particularly when compared to the spate of pictures Mann made during the same decade. A proponent of the so-called psychological Western, Mann was on a streak during the 1950s. Consider the output: “The Furies” (1950), “Winchester ’73” (1950), “The Naked Spur” (1953), “The Far Country” (1954), “The Man From Laramie” (1955), and the epochal “Man of the West” (1958). A workhorse, our man Anthony; a master, as well.\n\n“The Tin Star” is more conservative in its reach. Once Hickman comes across Kip (Michael Ray) and his mother Nona Mayfield (Betsy Palmer), we intuit that Mann isn’t out to complicate Fonda’s cinematic persona the way he did with Jimmy Stewart. Although Hickman remains gruff throughout, he’s got a soft spot for Kip and Nona, who not only brews a good cup of coffee but is soft on the eyes. Eventually, Hickman signs on to tutor Owens in the ways of handling a gun, negotiating with an adversary, and the most appropriate libation to order from the barkeep before 5 p.m.\n\nIf you guessed that Owens teaches a lesson of one sort or another to Hickman as well, then you know “The Tin Star” is a by-the-book Western. It is also an essay on the rewards of a job well done. While the film isn’t the best forum for the talents involved, each of those talents gives his all.\n\nDid I say “his”? A highlight of this picture is Betsy Palmer, an undersung actress who is likely best known for her stint as a panelist on the early game show “I’ve Got a Secret.” She fills out a fairly generic role with a welcome sense of gravity and a hint of acerbity. Palmer adds a welcome sense of grounding to a modest and expert entertainment.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the May 24, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\nLooking over the list of available titles from “Traditions of World Cinema,” a run of books published by the University of Edinburgh Press, an inveterate reader might begin to wonder what the relationship might be between globalist initiatives and niche pursuits.\n\nSeries editors Linda Badley and R. Barton Palmer are doing the Lord’s work in encouraging scholars the world over to put in their two cents about this-or-that aspect of cinema. Yet sometimes narrow-casting can be indistinguishable from a Monty Python sketch. What are we to make of tomes like “Nordic Film Cultures and Cinemas of Elsewhere” or “Liminal Noir in Classic World Cinema?” Specialists do have a tendency to miss the forest for the trees.\n\nThe trio of scholars who have put together “Greek Film Noir,” Anna Poupou, Nikitas Fessas, and Maria Chalkou, are keenly aware of what the critic and historian Robert Hughes referred to as “cultural cringe” — the perception that one’s own culture is somehow behind the curve of other countries or peoples. “The study of Greek film noir,” the trio write, “is directly linked to how Greeks see themselves as part of an increasingly dystopian landscape.” In so many words: The world’s going to hell and we want in.\n\nAlthough film noir has its roots in European cinema, the genre found its fullest realization in America around the midpoint of the last century. Acknowledging as much, a professor at the University of the West of England, Andrew Spicer, writes that it is now time to forego localism and “accept noir as a mode of attention, a sensibility, a particular approach to understanding the world.” The “weird wave” of contemporary Greek filmmakers, foremost among them icky fabulist Yorgos Lanthimos, is posited as reason enough to poke around the darker corners of older Greek cinema.\n\nThe irony here is that it may well have been a British-American film, “The Angry Hills” (1959), that helped clear the decks for Greek film noir. A historian and author, Yannis Tzioumakis, makes a cogent argument for the picture as both a spur for local talent and a solid entertainment on its own terms. Based on a book by Leon Uris, “The Angry Hills” has long suffered from bad word-of-mouth, not least because its director, Robert Aldrich, maligned it upon completion. Mr. Tziousmakis demurs: “its noir qualities go beyond the aesthetic, and reach all the way into the nation’s psyche. What more can one ask of a film?”\n\nA good question, particularly given that Aldrich had established himself as an adept noirist with the apocalyptic thriller “Kiss Me Deadly” (1955). The scriptwriter on that film, A.I. Bezzerides, was brought in to work on “The Angry Hills,” less for his Greek heritage than the knack he had for tough guys, sultry dames, and shadow-ridden streets. As for the casting of Robert Mitchum in the role of an American journalist with secrets to keep, let the man himself tell it: “Some idiot said, ‘Ask Mitchum to play it. That bum will do anything if he has five minutes free.’ Well I had five minutes free so I did it.”\n\n“The Angry Hills” veers between vistas of blistering sunlight and shadowed backways rife with Nazis, but fumbles along with only sporadic dramatic interest. The same can’t be said about “The Ogre of Athens” (1956), the best-known example of Greek noir and a film that got a literary boost from being mentioned in Jonathan Franzen’s novel “Freedom.” What can it mean, this gritty film about a milquetoast who is mistaken for a criminal mastermind: Is it a satire on political oppression or a parable about masculine initiative?\n\nDirected by Nikos Koundouros and scripted by novelist Iakovos Kambenanellis, “The Ogre of Athens” is less of a noir than a tragicomedy. Granted, it does take place in seedy nightclubs and darkened alleyways and is freighted with a bevy of ugly toughs and alluring women. Yet the story is centered more on the everyday failings and unexpected vanities of Thomas (Dinos Iliopoulos), a bank employee whose life is irrevocably upended during the course of a single night. The vicissitudes of fate prove alternately liberating and inescapable for our mousey hero.\n\n“The Ogre of Athens” isn’t quite as good as its devotees would have it — the film’s grotty, on-the-cheap cinematography is a decided backdraw — but it does pack a hallucinatory punch and, in the end, earns a place alongside honorable noir also-rans like “Phantom Lady” (1944), “Criss Cross” (1949), and “Crime Wave” (1953). That it should be the starting point of “Greek Noir” is as it should be.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the May 22, 2024 edition of The New York Sun.\n\n“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” having been primed by “Top Gun: Maverick,” may have saved Hollywood from financial and cultural oblivion, but they don’t hold a candle to “Hundreds of Beavers” in terms of hardscrabble invention, independence of vision, and cinematic integrity. That, and none of those multimillion-dollar time-wasters have quite as many actors scuttering around in full-size animal suits.\n\nOr, as they are listed in the film’s credits, “mascots.” Imagine the costumed enthusiast who accompanies the cheerleaders of your favorite sports team and you’ll have an idea what to expect from the low-tech raccoons, rabbits, foxes, wolves, and, yes, beavers featured in this, the first full-length film by director Mark Cheslik. The special effects are similarly modest, reflecting the film’s budget — reports have it costing around $150,000. In movie terms, that’s chump change.\n\nWhich isn’t to say that the special effects are lacking. They are spot-on given the nature of the proceedings, being unapologetic in their rough hewn, if not strictly speaking handmade, construction. The cut-and-paste verities of “Hundreds of Beavers” is an integral part of its charm — as is, it should be noted, the grainy black-and-white cinematography. The picture is a throwback not so much to early cinema, but to arthouse fare like “The Seventh Seal” (1957) and “Eraserhead” (1977).\n\nMr. Cheslik and his co-writer Ryland Brickson Cole Tews have thrown not a few things back in this unlikely picture. They’re conversant with silent film comedy and vintage cartoons, particularly those produced by Warner Brothers. The influence of Mad Magazine is also there to glean, most evidently in the way the film’s poster channels the great cartoonist and caricaturist, Jack Davis. Messrs. Cheslik and Tews have a soft spot for Stanley Kramer’s “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World” (1963).\n\n“Hundreds of Beavers” is a silent comedy like the films by Pierre Étaix and Jacques Tati are silent comedies — that is to say, they’re pictures that rely on recording technology not for dialogue but for all manners of noise. Squeaking, grunting, splatting, barking, and a rousing introductory song are there to be heard, as well as a soundtrack that is simultaneously generic in tone and particular in its emphases. What words we do encounter come via title cards. The first of them reads: “Lord grant me chastity … but not yet.” St. Augustine, don’t you know. Our filmmakers would seem to have gone to college.\n\nWorries that Messrs. Cheslik and Tews are sophomoric in their comedy should be waylaid. Their senses of humor haven’t graduated high school. “Hundreds of Beavers” is pure slapstick — done with a nod-and-a-wink, but also blessedly absent of self-aggrandizement. The out-and-out goal of this hyperkinetic film is to prompt laughter. It does so with the circumstances of a bare-bones plot and the associations cultivated by a hundred-plus years of cinema. It’s an intensely clever and richly textured farce.\n\nOh, and the story: It’s the 19th century and an applejack salesman, Jean Kayak (Mr. Tews), is out to take revenge on the titular critters for having laid his orchard to waste. That’s all the set-up needed for a sterling array of gags laid out in quicksilver order. There’s a love interest involved (Olivia Graves) and homages aplenty to Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and Orson Welles, as well as Einsteinian mathematical theorems. A working knowledge of 20th-century collage and video games is, if not necessary, another layer of reference.\n\nShould you be inclined to sit down with your children in front of “Hundreds of Beavers,” be warned that among its many revelations is that pole dancing was an invention of hearty Europeans who pioneered the American northwest. If there’s one thing to bellyache about it’s that at 108 minutes, the picture is more fur-trapping than most of us can withstand, particularly with comedy this manic. Otherwise, this oddball, word-of-mouth entertainment is one of the most heartening finds in recent memory.\n\n(c) 2024 Mario Naves\n\nThis review was originally published in the May 20, 2024 edition of The New York Sun."
