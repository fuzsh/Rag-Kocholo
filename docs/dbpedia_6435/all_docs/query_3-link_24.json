        "text": "At the turn of the twentieth century, cinema was quickly establishing itself as a legitimate form of popular entertainment.\n\nThe essays in American Cinema 1890-1909 explore and define how the making of motion pictures flowered into an industry that would finally become the central entertainment institution of the world. Beginning with all the early types of pictures that moved, this volume tells the story of the invention and consolidation of the various processes that gave rise to what we now call \"cinema.\" By examining the battles over patents, production, exhibition, and the reception of film, readers learn how going to the movies became a social tradition in American society.\n\nIn the course of these two decades, cinema succeeded both in establishing itself among other entertainment and instructional media and in updating various forms of spectacle."
