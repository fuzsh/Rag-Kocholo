About this list: Alternatives to Sight and Sound's Top 250 Films of All Time list named by /r/truefilm's community. With notes. Inspired by Jonathan Rosenbaum's similar list and our original list that found alternatives for the AFI Top 100. After #190, we've simply included the films that weren't provided with an alternative, but which we feel deserve to remain on the list. These (#191-250) are ranked, roughly, in order of obscurity and how much our mods enjoy them. Films that weren't provided with an alternative: Beau Travail, The Travelling Players, Performance, L'Age d'Or, A Canterbury Tale, Amarcord, Spring in a Small Town, Memories of Underdevelopment, Vivre Sa Vie, Marketa Lazarova, Caché, Once Upon a Time in America, The Werckmeister Harmonies, Kind Hearts and Coronets, Kings of the Road, Earth, Listen to Britain, Paisan, Wanda, The Wild Strawberries, L'Argent, Kes, and The Devil, Probably.",

        "text": "An alternative to Citizen Kane (1941, Ford).\n\n\"How about How Green Was My Valley? It won the oscar over Citizen Kane and is told in flashback as well.\"\n\n\"Seconding How Green Was My Valley. One of my very favorite Ford films, which takes a much slower, delicate approach to storytelling (more like story-whispering) than Citizen Kane, which pops and borks with frenzied techniques. How Green is a lyrical ode to growing-up that should resonate with just about anybody whose family has been through hard times. It's gotten a bum-rap just because it beat Citizen Kane; but, really, if you see it, you can see why the choice seemed pretty valid. Hell, I'd vote for it today over Kane, if I had the chance!\"\n\nAn alternative to Tokyo Story (1953, Ozu).\n\n\"Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Twilight. It is one of his least known melodramas. It is the closest Ozu got to a melodrama of Sirkian bombast rather than a melodrama his own, unique, domestic, quiet type (i.e., Tokyo Story, An Autumn Afternoon, etc). The despair of this film derives from its charged plot (two sisters running into their mother, who abandoned them, in a mah-jong parlor), as well as the brutal half-hour, which features a plot point best seen and not spoiled here. This plot point (and those who've seen Tokyo Twilight will know exactly what I'm talking about) gives the film its darkness and emotional catharsis.\"\n\nAn alternative to Breathless (Godard, 1960).\n\n\"Truffaut's Breathless, and one which I derive more pleasure from. To me, this is a near-perfect synthesis of style and content. Each flourish is both a self-contained flourish and a striking visual literalization of the emotional reality of any given character it follows.\n\n\"It is refreshing to see a noir-gangster film made by a film like Truffaut with such a humanist sensitivity towards female characters and shy guys. Yet at the same time, Truffaut is smart enough to see that Charlie's timid romanticization of women as mythological types (following a grave incident in his past, which I won't explain) and the gangsters' misogynistic condescension are both roads to ruin and misunderstanding. These perceptions don't get at the heart of people with complex motives like Charlie's wife. A renunciation of the latter and a complication/extension of the former (to make the assumptions less general) are needed.\n\n\"Of course, this is just Truffaut getting us to consider something which is secondary to him: the theme. What matters most, and what lingers in our minds long after the credits stop rolling, is the final, brutal, stark, devastating shot. Once you know Charlie's pain, you'll won't forget it.\n\nThis whirls and gyrates with the same jittery love of cinema as Godard's Breathless. I don't think Truffaut was this free-form, avant-garde, and fun-loving ever again.\"\n\nAn alternative to Seven Samurai (1954, Kurosawa).\n\n\"Just as innovative of an action movie as Seven Samurai, and with the benefit of being a silent. The only version of Orochi you're gonna see will be with benshi narration, the way Japan showed silent movies. It's one of the rarest, most unique movie watching experiences you'll have, and you'll get the same exhileration watching it as you would a Kurosawa action. The highs are super high, the lows are low, but it's always on overdrive. The final action sequence is as grand and fresh as the massive showdown in Seven Samurai, though about an eighth the length. If you've got to take out a treasure, you've got to replace it something equally as valuable. Thank god it's also just as badass.\"\n\nAn alternative to Singin' in the Rain (Donen/Kelly, 1952).\n\nmontypython22: \"Demy is one of the hottest new discoveries of recent memory for cinephiles, thanks to the immense efforts of his widow Agnés Varda to restore his oeuvre. The Criterion box-set has done a huge service to cinema; it has shone a light on one of cinema's most enchanting, beautiful dreamers. It has given attention to a previously-ignored artist who has remained a sleeper for several years, despite his prominent connection to the French New Wave.\n\nPart of the reason why Demy hasn't been quite canonized into the film musical genre as of yet is due to his bizarre juxtapositions. Demy's world is an unsettling, motley combination of genres, tones, styles, and modes. Different events that occur in his films are not neatly confined to specific emotional categories. (Case-in-point with *Rochefort*: a serial killer is brought up in the film's second half, but everyone reacts to the news with unnerving cheerfulness and humor, cracking insane puns about how \"what a dirty man he is\" but \"how cleanly he cuts his girls up.\") Likewise, this film's ostensibly happy ending—everyone finds the man/woman they've been looking for–is muted by the much more palpable…\n\nAn alternative to Rashomon (1950, Kurosawa).\n\n\"An item appears in the Iranian press about a village boy who averts a train catastrophe by warning the authorities that the track was damaged by setting fire to his coat. A film crew is sent to make an epic film based about this incident. But whilst the railway authorities completely deny the boy's existence, the Govenor-General recognises him as a hero. In the meantime, dozens of heroes come forward, each claiming to have saved the day.\n\n\"This truly is a hidden gem, a real Rashomon revealing much about the Iran of several decades ago and how different interests lead to the hardships of discovering and reporting on the truth as a journalist.\"\n\nAn alternative to In the Mood for Love (Wong Kar Wai, 2000).\n\n\"Christopher Doyle's Away With Words (1999): one of the most beautiful films ever made, and a total emotional experience. Probably one of those movies that you need to be in the right mood to watch, as it is stranger that WKW's work (and in fact odder than most films I would say), but if/when it clicks it reveals its inner masterfulness. Also a film that (I find) is incredibly difficult to write about as it seemingly exists on a separate plane and in watching it, one is conducting a kind of seance, experiencing the film totally on a sensory/emotional level.\"\n\nAn alternative to Shoah (1985, Lanzmann).\n\n\"I feel like nothing can equal the breadth and intensity of Shoah except for something which, in length, is its exact opposite. That film, of course, is Alain Resnais' Night and Fog.\n\nFor as long as there are atrocities being committed by our government and other major Western governments around the world,\n\nFor as long as the human mind allows us to extend our consciences beyond our present moment into the spiritual ether which connects us long after we are dead,\n\nFor as long as scholars and the public, alike, continue to wish to explore and learn about the effects of the Nazi extermination of the Jewish people in Europe,\n\nAnd for as long as there are dissenters in this world who are either a.) ignorant of the atrocities that occurred in Europe to a specific group of innocent people between 1939 and 1945, or (even worse) b.) dismissive of the very existence of the Shoah—\n\nFor all these reasons, and more, movies like Alain Resnais' Night and Fog will have purpose and continue to inform the masses--never allowing us to forget that, for 6 years, humanity failed itself.\n\n(A brief note must be…\n\nAn alternative to Taxi Driver (1976, Scorsese).\n\n\"Same collaboration of actor-director, similar perspective on the state of America, outsider trying to reach his goal in society of becoming a nobility. I honesty prefer this film to TD, though that might have to do with the social content of the film as I find it getting more relevant by the years, while TD is clearly a time capsule of 1970's NYC.\"\n\n\"I second The King of Comedy, which I also prefer to Taxi Driver, although I wouldn't argue against anyone who favours TD. The King of Comedy covers similar subject matter but I find it more effective since it uses comedy to make its point; I've always preferred this Trojan horse method. Part of this is of course just a result of how influential Taxi Driver was, but The King of Comedy feels more refreshing in that it both reinforces and subverts the previous film.\"\n\nAn alternative to The General (1927, Keaton & Cline).\n\n\"We watch Buster for two reasons: he may actually end up dead this time, and the man can put together a gag like no one's business. In The Cameraman, he actually takes it a step further than he did with the train in The General; that was a life-risking feat that required a good deal of coordination. In The Cameraman, Buster simply runs himself ragged for out entertainment. He runs up and down five flights of stairs five times in a single shot. We know he's really doing it all in one set, and then he runs across town! Buster gets a peck on the cheek, and and the cold rain no longer exists. As much as sitting on the train looking at his picture tugs at the heart, sitting on the back of a car freezing to death while his love gets hit on by the stud in the front is gut wrenching. All the best parts of all his best movies are combined into one. This \"starter kit\" Keaton is also his most comprehensive physical statement. For his directorial thesis, see Sherlock, Jr.\"\n\nAn alternative to La Dolce Vita (1960, Fellini).\n\n\"Obvious choice. Parties, Aging, Life, questions of morality and what constitutes a good life. Edit; I think Fellini's film is, ultimately, superior, but the Great Beauty is a much more immediately engrossing film and one that is much less emotionally stunted than Vita.\"\n\n\"I should add this is a great film for an older audience, too. My dad and I both watched it. I thought it was ok, but I think, due to his age, he connected with it a lot more.\"\n\n\"Huh. I think in the DP/30 interview, Sorrentino said he was surprised at how many young people enjoyed it at screenings. I'm 20 and it's one of my favorites.\"\n\nAn alternative to Pather Panchali (1955, S. Ray).\n\n\"a Marathi film about an 11-year old boy who struggles to cope with the death of his father while trying to make new friends in an unfamiliar place, after his mother gets a job transfer.\n\nA film from the same country, involves a child protagonist, is a coming-of-age story and deals with grief and a parent undergoing a job transfer.\n\nPlus I think it is a good place for someone to get introduced to modern Marathi cinema, which is overlooked in India itself, as is most regional cinema beyond the target demographic which is usually limited to the state (s) where the languages are spoken.\n\n\"Two other alternatives which come to mind are VIHIR (THE WELL) and UDAAN (FLIGHT), which are also excellent coming-of-age stories, dealing with slightly darker and more grown-up themes.\"\n\nAn alternative to A Woman under the Influence (1974, the Cass).\n\n*Opening Night*, by Cassavetes. Same lead actress (Gena Rowlands), with a similar level of tortured mystery and pain woven into the film's tapestry.\n\nAs someone once said, \"Fuck you, John Cassavetes. You've ruined the rest of cinema for me forever.\" After seeing his 1977 ode to the theatre *Opening Night*, I know exactly what they mean. Once you see a Cassavetes, all other American movies, all other performances, all other films in general merely pale in comparison.\n\n*Opening Night* is perhaps the best representative example of what it means to be a Cassavetes film. It is his treatise on what it means to be a great movie. It is his passionate, bizarre reflection on cinema and the act of artistic creation. It is a self-reflexive triumph layered with so many meanings and thorny double-meanings that it makes my head hurt just trying to untangle the web of performance Cassavetes, Rowlands, and company spin. We don't know where the performers end and where the charactera begin, and it is this balletic shifting between fact and fiction that makes *Opening Night* an absolutely enchanting film. And it confirms Gena Rowlands as perhaps the greatest single actress to grace the cinema.\n\nAn alternative to Raging Bull (1980, Scorsese).\n\n\"My introduction to Robert Ryan was in Caught, where I thought there was no soul behind his eyes. It made me wonder why he was the only one the critics talked about in regards to that movie. Why he was considered one of Classic Hollywood's greatest actors. Eventually I got to The Set-Up, and realized the man is nothing but soul. If the hellfire that is the occupation of boxing was a hallmark of Raging Bull, and the quiet resignation of a passing era was the thrust of No Country For Old Men, The Set-Up finds the perfect combination of the two. Ryan is just a little too old, his competition is just a little too young. The ring is just a little too small, and his wife is just a little too fed up. The universe is moving on, and Ryan's knees could use some ice. The man can capture an entire character in a grin, but puts his ass on the line anyways. Usually, character studies leave me lacking in visual expression, but that's not the case here. Every department, from costumes to camera to cast, are on the exact same page, and the results are heartbreaking.\"\n\nAn alternative to M (1931, Lang).\n\n\"This is a tricky one! M is part silent, part sound, so which direction do we want to go? Let's go with another violent meditation on crime, criminals, law enforcement, and responsibility. Just as M also serves as Lang's final statement about synched sound (that it's a great supplement; of course, that ended up being a losing battle), Dartmoor does the same, but from the other side. It's a silent movie whose big sequence takes place inside a theater screening a talkie. Both movies left me looking at the floor when they were over, wondering what the hell I had just seen, and why they're so hidden from discussion. If you're forced to remove M to get to that second layer, you will not strike more gold than in A Cottage on Dartmoor, one of the earliest, and best, precursors of noir.\"\n\nAn alternative to The Third Man (1949, Reed).\n\n\"Dassin made this great London noir in his transition phase, and for my money, never outdid this achievement. It's so weird, with its focus on, I kid you not, the seedy London undergound Greco-Roman wrestling subculture. There's no way that was a real thing, but its plausibility is supplanted with the steady plunge Widmark takes into hell. He's always walking down stairs to get somewhere, never up, where the fine restaurants transition into little more than planks of wood resting on brick walls where liquor is served. The driving force of the movie, the inescapable direction toward which it heads, is as dreadful as The Third Man, and even more powerful. This is not an alternative vote: Night and the City should have had The Third Man's spot to begin with.\"\n\nAn alternative to The Magnificent Ambersons (1942, Welles) and Distnat Voices, Still Lives (1988, Davies)\n\n\"Perhaps Davies' most stirring film, it directly references the voice-overs of Welles' masterpiece. It also elaborates on Ambersons's vision of a wishy-washy past built from untrustworthy memories.\"\n\n\"The only other possible alternative to DISTANT VOICES STILL LIVES is Terence Davies' other haunting film released around the same time, **The Long Day Closes (1992)**, which spoke to me more than *DV,SL* (something which I'm sure will change on a re-watch.)\n\nBrutally personal. Hypnotic. Humanist. I was too flustered to seriously discuss this, and I sort of still am. So let me just say: watch this film, and be made aware of cinematic honesty and truth-forging in its most lyrical form. I am a straight Honduran/Latino boy with a positive and supporting family who loves the Beatles (not-practising-Catholic), and yet this story about a gay white Liverpudlian bloke with a hellish family background and who hates the Beatles (Catholic 24-7) spoke to me in unforeseeable ways that I still can't quite explain. When an artwork hits you in the face and flummoxes you, leaves you speechless, it's truly a blessed thing.\n\nAn alternative to The Seventh Seal (1954, Bergman).\n\n\"In my opinion this is Bergman's best film that hasn't been shouted from the rooftops for years by everyone already. Fanny and Alexander, The Seventh Seal, Persona, Winter Light, The Virgin Spring, Wild Strawberries and Through a Glass Darkly already have huge followings among film fans. Shame however, has been, in my opinion, wrongfully ignored. Personally I place it firmly in the top 5 films Ingmar Bergman ever directed because of the way he handles the multitude of topics he takes on, from gender roles and marriage to war and propaganda and so on. If you haven't watched it yet I highly recommend it, and I certainly think it is a worthy fit among the 250 best films of all time in our alternate list.\"\n\nAn alternative to Bringing Up Baby (1938, Hawks).\n\n\"**Silver Linings Playbook** by David O. Russell (2012).\n\nThe saga of O. Russell on /r/TrueFilm is a long and tired one, but I have a feeling the effort will be well-worth it in the end. For a catch-up on the story so far, read this latest update, which tries to summarize why a good number of us on /r/TrueFilm (not the majority, of course, but at least *a good vocal number of us*) believe David O. Russell's movies are much better and essential than they are given credit for.\n\nBut, enough politics for now. Most people can agree that *Silver Linings Playbook* is among his finest achievements. It captures the screw-ballsy spirit of Hawks' *Bringing Up Baby* (as well as his other comedic delights, like *Twentieth Century* and *His Girl Friday*) better than anyone in the days since Hawks. (And this includes Peter Bogdanovich's rather limp, toothless imitation of Hawks in his lightly entertainment send-up to screwball, *What's Up Doc*; sorry, Peter, not your best work.)\n\nI also wouldn't be a good sport if I didn't link to my longer treatise on David O. Russell. If you have the time, give it a gander. See what you think. Reflect on how O. Russell may just be more than meets the eye.\n\nIf you're interested on how my views of O. Russell's *SLP* changed over time (including a rather cute personal anecdote that has become one of my favorite memories), read my Letterboxd reviews here.\n\nAn alternative to Dr Strangelove (1964, Kubrick).\n\n\"It engages with the nuclear warfare milieu of Dr. Strangelove, but through an insane thicket-plot that's equal parts schizo Sam Fuller, McCarthy paranoia, jazz, and baroque melodrama. Like Strangelove, everything in sight is pumped up for maximum madness: Janet Leigh speaking in cryptic code that signifies she may or may not be a Communist spy, nice old black ladies turning into Chinese-Russian-Cuban diplomats who brainwash the protagonists, a karate fight between Frank Sinatra and a Korean manservant, and a scene with John McGiver and a glass of milk that has to be seen to be believed. (And even afterwards, not believed.) Strangelove operates in H.L. Mencken-ish levels of cackling dark humor, delighting in seeing humanity's end due to the incompetence of our foreign leaders. Manchurian Candidate takes an opposite approach—it's a paranoiac thriller where we're unsure what the takeaway is—but arrives at the same conclusion: the government has instilled a sense of fear and paranoia amongst citizens that allowed for the escalation of these unchecked hysterics to fester into madness.\""
