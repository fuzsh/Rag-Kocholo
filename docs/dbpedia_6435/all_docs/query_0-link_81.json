        "text": "Kudos to Kino Video, always an enterprising company, for shining a spotlight on several major works by Robert Altman, always an enterprising director, although not always a successful one, as he himself admitted now and then. The earliest of the films are The Long Goodbye (1973) and Thieves Like Us (1974), while the middle entry is Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull’s History Lesson (1976) and the last-made member of the quartet is Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, until recently the most difficult of the four to see. Each is available with a modest array of extras in Kino’s aptly named Studio Classics line, a welcome newcomer to the home-video marketplace in 2015, when these Blu-rays were released.\n\nThis essay reflects on the pedagogical value of integrating nontheatrical and useful cinemas into a standard film history survey course. It takes as its example my experiences teaching a one-semester survey titled, “International Cinema to 1960,” at a university in the United States. The essay suggests how looking beyond the narrative feature reorients film history in several ways: first, by highlighting alternative film production practices (such as government- and corporate sponsored nonfiction); second, by offering generative context for specific national film movements (such as the Golden Age of Mexican cinema and Italian Neorealism); and third, as a lens to contend with the history of European imperialism and the colonial gaze (i.e., travelogues, colonial film units). It argues that putting nontheatrical and useful cinemas in conversation with classic survey content offers a more dynamic history of cinema and becomes a vehicle for organically sparking important conversations about the Eurocentric, racial, and gendered limitations of the film canon—especially prior to 1960. Integrating nontheatrical cinemas creates a survey that actual surveys the scope of film history.\n\nClint Eastwood embarked on the middle period of his career in the eventful year of 1971, when he showed new sides of his acting talent in Donald Siegel’s The Beguiled, made his feature-directing debut with Play Misty for Me, in which he also starred, and scored a pop-cultural bull’s-eye in Siegel’s Dirty Harry. Firmly established as a star, a celebrity, and a quasi-studio chief running his own production outfit, the Malpaso Company, Eastwood went on to direct a half-dozen more pictures in the 1970s and appear in the same number of films by other directors. Most were very well received, and some—the comic “monkey movies” of 1978 and 1980—were phenomenal hits, but Dirty Harry became a box-office sensation, spawning five sequels between 1973 and 1988 and turning into a cause de scandale that critics and moralists chewed over for years to come.\n\nIt is obvious to any seasoned moviegoer that contemporary popular films are different than those of earlier times. We measured 160 English-language films released from 1935 to 2010 and addressed four changes concerning shots, motion, and luminance. Perhaps the most obvious change is that shot lengths have gotten shorter, and others have also documented this trend. Perhaps also apparent is that contemporary films have more motion and movement than those of the Hollywood studio era. Less apparent, however, is the relation between shot lengths and motion. In contemporary films shorter shots also have proportionately more motion than longer shots in the same film, whereas in older films the shots of different length are not dis tinguished by their relative amount of their motion. And finally films have gotten darker. That is, the mean luminance value of frames across the lengths of a film has decreased over time. We discuss psychological effects associated with these four changes, including harnessing viewer attention through narrative pacing and the enhancement of the viewing experience."
