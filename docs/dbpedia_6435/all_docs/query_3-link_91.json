        "text": "World History Movies/Documentaries\n\nThe movies listed below have some historical value. They are not for extra credit or assignments, but if you are going to to watch a movie in any event, you might as well watch one of these. They are listed somewhat chronologically and alphabetically within time period. For some I have brief descriptions, others were recommended but I haven’t viewed them yet. Not all are great films, but all either cover an event or topic in world history (though some are more European or US history focused than APWH will be) or recreate the era without claiming to be depicting actual events (which sometimes are better than the ones focused on events which often lack historical accuracy or misguide viewers about events). Note that the rating (G, PG, etc.) is not noted on any of these. If it is R, you should get your parents'/guardians' permission.\n\nMost of these movies are available at your local public library or Netflix.
