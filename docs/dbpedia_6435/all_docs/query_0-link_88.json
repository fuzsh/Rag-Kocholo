Follow @NicksFlickPicks\n\nHot Off the Presses!\n\nThe Desiring-Image: Gilles Deleuze and Contemporary Queer Cinema ($30/pbk). By Nick Davis. Oxford University Press, 2013. The book that earned me tenure at Northwestern. Offers a new theoretical model of queer film, born from Gilles Deleuze's rarely-integrated notions of cinema and desire. Chapter-length readings of Dead Ringers, Naked Lunch, Shortbus, The Watermelon Woman, Brother to Brother, Beau travail, and Velvet Goldmine, plus other films along the way! Written for a scholarly audience but hopefully interesting to anyone curious about recent cinema, ideas about desire, or LGBT aesthetics and politics. \"Important and needed work...Deeply original.\" D.N. Rodowick, \"Seductive in its intellect and humbling in its prose.\" Michele Aaron\n\nReading the Bromance: Homosocial Relationships in Film and Television ($32/pbk). Ed. Michael DeAngelis. Wayne State University Press, 2014. Academic pieces that dig into recent portraits in popular media, comic and dramatic, of intimacies between straight(ish) men. Includes the essay \"'I Love You, Hombre': Y tu mamá también as Border-Crossing Bromance\" by Nick Davis, as well as chapters on Superbad, Humpday, Jackass, The Wire, and other texts. Written for a mixed audience of scholars, students, and non-campus readers. Forthcoming in June 2014. \"Remarkably sophisticated essays.\" Janet Staiger, \"Essential reading for anyone interested in contemporary models of gender and sexuality.\" Harry Benshoff\n\nFifty Key American Films ($31/pbk). Ed. Sabine Haenni, John White. Routledge, 2009. Includes my essays on The Wild Party, The Incredibles, and Brokeback Mountain. Intended as both a newcomer's guide to the terrain and a series of short, exploratory essays about such influential works as The Birth of a Nation, His Girl Friday, Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, Taxi Driver, Blade Runner, Daughters of the Dust, and Se7en.\n\nThe Cinema of Todd Haynes: All That Heaven Allows ($25/pbk). Ed. James Morrison. Wallflower Press, via Columbia University Press, 2007. Includes the essay \"'The Invention of a People': Velvet Goldmine and the Unburying of Queer Desire\" by Nick Davis, later expanded and revised in The Desiring-Image. More, too, on Poison, Safe, Far From Heaven, and Haynes's other films by Alexandra Juhasz, Marcia Landy, Todd McGowan, James Morrison, Anat Pick, and other scholars. \"A collection as intellectually and emotionally generous as Haynes' films\" Patricia White, Swarthmore College\n\nFilm Studies: The Basics ($23/pbk). By Amy Villarejo. Routledge, 2006, 2013. Award-winning film scholar and teacher Amy Villarejo finally gives us the quick, smart, reader-friendly guide to film vocabulary that every teacher, student, and movie enthusiast has been waiting for, as well as a one-stop primer in the past, present, and future of film production, exhibition, circulation, and theory. Great glossary, wide-ranging examples, and utterly unpretentious prose that remains rigorous in its analysis; the book commits itself at every turn to the artistry, politics, and accessibility of cinema.\n\nMost recent screenings in each race;\n\nmultiple nominees appear wherever they scored their most prestigious nod... and yes, that means Actress trumps Actor!\n\n* Denotes a recent reappraisal\n\nPicture Noms % Seen:\n\n97%\n\nDead End\n\nA\n\nFriendly Persuasion\n\nC+\n\nGandhi\n\nC+\n\nDirector Noms % Seen:\n\n96%\n\nThe Crowd\n\nA\n\nSabrina\n\nB\n\nI Want to Live!\n\nC\n\nActress Noms % Seen:\n\n100%\n\nA Star Is Born ('54)\n\nA\n\nThe Country Girl\n\nB\n\nThe Letter ('29)\n\nB\n\nActor Noms % Seen:\n\n91%\n\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\n\nA\n\nChampion\n\nB\n\nThe Affairs of Cellini\n\nC\n\nSup Actress Noms % Seen:\n\n100%\n\nBroken Lance\n\nC+\n\nThe Bachelor Party\n\nB\n\nPaper Moon\n\nB+\n\nSup Actor Noms % Seen:\n\n91%\n\nThe Day of the Locust\n\nC\n\nJuarez\n\nC+\n\nThe Paper Chase\n\nD\n\nCinematography Noms % Seen:\n\n69%\n\nKing Kong ('76)\n\nC\n\nShanghai Triad\n\nB\n\nEarthquake\n\nD+\n\nScreenplay Noms % Seen:\n\n76%\n\nThe Strange Love of Martha Ivers\n\nD\n\nThe Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer*\n\nB\n\nBoomerang!\n\nC+\n\nThis Blog Sponsored by...\n\nChicagoans!
