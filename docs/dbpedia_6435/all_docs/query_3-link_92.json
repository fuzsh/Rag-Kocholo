        "text": "The thriller Get Out has the distinction of being one of the highest grossing films of all time by a black writer/director, Jordan Peele. It galvanized moviegoers and sparked conversations about the film on social media. It is also one of the most written about films, with articles appearing in outlets ranging from Esquire to Vanity Fair, and is credited with introducing the term the “sunken place” into our vocabularies.\n\nGet Out centers on a young black male photographer, Chris, who is invited by his white girlfriend to spend the weekend with her and her liberal parents at their secluded suburban estate and uncovers a sinister plot in the process. One of the film’s themes explores African Americans being subjected to violence by vigilantes resonated with audiences. Also, the film tapped into the malaise felt by some about the state of national and international politics.\n\nGet Out was recently released on DVD, so what better time than now to unpack the many layers and images in the film with NYPL’s resources: some of which are available at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and others may be found at NYPL’s research and branch libraries. We’re also sharing some of the films that influenced Get Out, so that you can discover or re-discover them for yourself.\n\nBooks\n\nbell hooks’ Black looks: race and representation, is a must read. She analyzes depictions of African Americans in the media. In particular, the chapter “Madonna: Plantation Mistress or Soul Sister” incisively calls into question Madonna’s relationship with African-American artists in her employ (including vocalists and dancers) and is a lens into understanding the Get Out character Rose Armitage, played by Allison Williams.\n\nIn Robin Means Coleman’s Horror noire: Blacks in American Horror Films From the 1890s to The Present, she writes about African Americans in horror films during each decade of the 20th century. One of the chapters titled, “We Always Die First—Invisibility, Racial Red-Lining and Self-Sacrifice” echoes a common sentiment expressed by African-American film spectators who note that black characters in horror films often don’t survive the killing spree and make it out alive at the end of the movie.\n\nNo discussion about blacks in films, across genres, can be had without referring to Ed Guerrero’s Framing Blackness: the African American Image in Film, which is also a scholarly treatment on significant African-American film productions. Guerro also writes about allegories and metaphors in films by or about African Americans.\n\nMissy Armitage is also one of many in the long line of wicked psychiatrists on film. In Cinema's Sinister Psychiatrists: From Caligari to Hannibal, learn how fact influences fiction regarding representations of headshrinkers on film.\n\nFilms\n\nPrior to the release of his film, Jordan Peele curated a film series at BAM in February 2017 called The Art of the Social Thriller to highlight movies that served as an inspiration for Get Out. If you missed the films, you can borrow them from NYPL. Here are a few of the movies that screened in Peele’s series.\n\nPeele may have been paying homage to Alfred Hitchcock by making Get Out’s Chris a photographer, like the character James Stewart portrayed in Hitchcock’s classic thriller Rear Window. Peele is not the first director to seek inspiration from the master of suspense and you’ll see why after you view one of Hitchcock’s most revered and imitated works.\n\nLibrarian Kai Alexis Smith created a Get Out resource guide for those seeking more resources to explore ideas and themes in the film.\n\nWhat are some other films or books that you think audiences show know about to shed light on Get Out’s reception and how we can frame the success of this film during this moment in time, socially and politically?"
