        "text": "Maison, Maison\n\nCarmen Edna K. Maisonave[1] (Masion, Mason, Masonave, Maysonave, Malsonave) was born on August 17, 1886, (not in 1892 is as so popularly quoted) in San Francisco, California to Peter (Pierre) Maisonave and Mary Ely; Edna’s only sibling, Marie Elise was born 1895. If Edna was not born into a wealthy situation, she at the least was birthed into an industrious household, which would benefit her greatly as an example of work ethic. Her father was a long time Los Angeles grocer, who immigrated to the United States from France, in April of 1872, at the age of nineteen, on his own. Peter Maisonave brought his background of farming to the States and that occupation never really played a part (besides the entrepreneurial spirit that accompanies it) in America for this ambitious young man. His initial work was as a cook but the following year he had risen to clerk at the Miner’s Restaurant at the southwest corner of Dupont and Broadway; while in San Francisco he became a naturalized citizen, this being in 1877. His next residence was in Los Angeles, where he met and married Mary Ely just three days before Thanksgiving, 1884;[2] the young couple moved to San Francisco in 1886 where he picked up the trade of cattle dealer and the Maisonaves welcomed Enda to the world.\n\nThe family moved from the City by the Bay in 1888, back to the Los Angeles area and Peter started the first incarnation of his grocery store, which work he would continue through 1893, and then taking a position with Edward Duggan a local restaurateur. Mary Ann Ely Maisonave took care of their home and their two daughters; that task must have been daunting at times, considering that Peter’s business was often housed in their home. In between the different versions of the Masonave grocery store, Peter owned a wood, coal, hay and grain supply business.\n\nThis birthdate confusion (as stated above) for Edna Maison is of course as always an attempt to make the young actress seem younger still, and may have been added to by her parents. In the 1900 Federal Census she was born in 1886 and for the 1910 Federal Census her date of birth is listed as 1888. None of this age-play information in any way detracts from her early, distinct talents. Ms. Maison was a young woman of “much rich, dark beauty,” easily looking the part of a woman of Spanish bloodline,[3] she with brown hair and brown eyes. The family was Catholic and attended the Sacred Heart church in East Los Angeles; Ms. Masion was involved in singing in Catholic festivities and fund-raising events.[4]\n\nMaison, Preamble to Hollywood\n\nShe began her performances at the age of six with the Fred Cooper Stock Company,[5] which operated at the Burbank Theater; the theater,[6] which was under construction was finally ready for patrons on Monday, November 27, 1893.[7] Her first professional operatic position was at the age of fifteen with the Tivoli Opera House in San Francisco in 1901;[8] it was after she developed her “rich contralto voice” that the renowned contralto Estafanin Callamarini, took up teaching Edna;[9] some thought that Maison gave Callamarini a run for first place as a contralto.[10] After a year with Tivoli, she migrated to Fisher’s Theater, playing in that stock company.\n\nWhatever Edna’s theatrical pursuits were during the following period (the remainder of 1902 through the summer of 1903), they either were not news worthy or have been lost to us. When seventeen, Edna’s parents desired a practical education for her and she was enrolled at Woodbury Business College in 1903, graduating in 1904, where she learned stenography (working in that field for portions of 1904-1905-1906) and was a starter on the women’s basketball team there; hers was the privilege of being part of the first group of women to play hoops at Woodbury.[11] Maison also used some of her spare time while at the Woodbury Business College, acting with fellow students; we can see Edna front and center in the photo that the Los Angeles Herald published along with their story.\n\nMaison was quiet for a while on the stage working as a court-stenographer in the office of the Los Angeles County Clerk, C. G. Keyes, often taking dictation from Mr. Keyes and registering voters;[12] she did this until another opportunity presented itself. That circumstance happened in the early summer of 1906 with baritone Evan Baldwin; Baldwin wrote a sketch (Why Dorothy Went to College) and he and Edna performed the skit at the Orpheum Theater.[13] This (the Baldwin sketch) of a sort re-launched Maison’s singing career and thereby her part in film history.\n\nIn Ms. Maison’s next engagement, that began in the spring of 1907 with the California Opera Company, better known as, The Californians, she was under the direction of Tom Karl. Karl an operatic tenor had won his fame as a member of, The Bostonians, which was formally known as, The Boston Ideals, a touring opera company. During his later career he relied upon recitals in music halls and hotels for his income; he moved to the Los Angeles area in 1905. In 1907 he co-founded, The Californians, with Dollon M. Dewey, who had also been a backer of, The Bostonians. Edna was not among the list of principals of the troupe, who all were east-coast folks, but was definitely a member of the group; her engagement ended with, The Californians, with the ending of the company in late August of 1907.[14] It was her time with, The Californians, that she met Robert Z. Leonard who was a supporting member of the same company;[15] besides this operatic connection they had little (two recorded appearances together on film) in common professionally, except working at Universal with the same people.\n\nFor the 1907-1908 season Ms. Maison performed with the Princess Theatre of San Francisco, which presented a slate of comic operas and musical comedies; many of those (including Robert Leonard) who had appeared with, The Californians, were in this company, sans Tom Karl.[16] Theater critic James Crawford considered her the beauty of the cast, with a voice “not large” but of a “pretty color.”[17] She was a contralto soloist with the Edgar Temple Opera Company of Los Angeles, in 1908; again working alongside “Big Bob” Robert Z. Leonard.[18] In July of 1908 Edna performed with the Manhattan Opera Company, along with Nigel de Brulliere (Brulier, Brouillet),[19] who would appear with her in, The Dumb Girl of Portici, in 1916. The spring of 1909 found Maison with the Florence Stone company for a brief time; she was brought in to bolster the singing. The company went to Minneapolis at the end of May but returned quickly to Los Angeles.[20] At the first of July of 1909 Masion was again signed by the Majestic Musical Company, but, by Independence Day, she was taken ill and lost the position.[21]\n\nMaison at the Movies\n\nMaison was in many respects the picture of a cultured woman, fitting well the description oft written by author Jane Austin of a young lady of society. Her interests included painting, specializing in flowers, working with oils and water colors. Edna loved nature and the open spaces; she was quite fond of animals and enjoyed riding.[22] This last love was instrumental in getting her a job in motion pictures; they wanted a leading lady who not only fit her physical appearance but who could also ride a horse. Ms. Maison said she “had little difficulty in the landing the position,” and that the movies afforded her the advantage of staying home with her mother and father instead of the constant travel with an opera company. Edna was very nervous about the change from the stage to celluloid, not knowing if she “would make good or not,”[23] but that worry was unwarranted for she was quite the popular young star in Hollywood. Maison brought to the stage and to the camera an “apparently tireless vivacity” which when singing left her “vocalizations” composed; she was considered to have a phenomenal voice.[24] It must have taken significant back-bone and self-confidence to move from one field of endeavor where she was highly praised to another where she was an unknown and her most notable talent could not be appreciated.\n\n1913 saw Edna Maison and Margarita Fischer run on the Suffrage ticket in the newly incorporated town of Universal City, with a population of more than one-thousand-three-hundred in the municipality inhabited exclusively by moving-picture people. Ms. Fischer ran for Fire Commissioner and Maison for one of the two Aldermen offices available in Universal City; each of the ladies won their campaigned for seats.[25]\n\nIn 1916, Edna Maison had the opportunity to sit in the chair of assistant director for, Alias Jane Jones, for which she also starred in; she stated that she preferred acting to directing.[26] Cleo Madison is credited as the lead but all surviving evidence points to the contrary. Besides the aforementioned blurb that ascribed assistant-directing duties and the lead by, Motography magazine, Maison is also listed in the leading role in numerous (the majority) newspapers of the day.[27] The confusion of who starred in the film is not confined to today only, but in 1916, many ads accredited Cleo Madison as the leading lady, and one melded the names and reported that it was Edna Madison who starred in the movie.[28]\n\nIn the spring of 1916 Maison left Universal, to consider an offer from vaudeville; in reality, she was quite ill and needed time to recuperate; she took those weeks into the summer of 1916 to weigh her options.[29] She stayed with Carl Laemmle at Universal Film for the following year and finally ended her film acting career with the H. N. Nelson Attractions production of, The Mysterious Mr. Browning, which was released in December of 1918; a year-and-a-half after her last Universal project opened. This marked the end of both the stage and screen career of Edna Maison, yet, although she was off the silver-screen and no longer treading the boards of the theater, she was none the less still remembered in Hollywood; she was one of those “early day associates” of Carl Laemmle, who attended his funeral in 1939.[30]\n\nEdna Poste Griffith Masion was a busy actress during her seven or so years in the moving making community, with no less than one-hundred appearances before the cameras. This number of film roles that we are aware of now, may be short of the actual total. The Story World and Photodramatist magazine reported that Maison worked early with director Charles K. French of the original Bison Company, the western branch of the New York Motion Picture Corporation; Bison Motion Pictures released over one-hundred-seventy-five pictures from November of 1909 through July of 1910 under the direction of French;[31] if this reportage is accurate, then we have no idea how many films Maison was in, but we do know that it is more than what is currently listed.\n\nOddly enough, it was July of 1909 when Maison was taken ill and lost her job with the Majestic Musical Company, with no other reports of stage appearances for her, or any news items, from July of 1909 through autumn of 1912 (where her work with Pathé is mentioned). Could this be the period (summer of 1909 through the summer of 1911) of early film-making for the actress? We will most likely never know for sure. Maison was engaged no later than in the middle of 1911 with the Pathé Western Company,[32] yet, with Bison and the additional six or so months added to her Pathé period, our current knowledge (with documentary evidence) of her first flick was, and still remains, The Girl Sheriff (Pathé), released in April of 1912. Two films, one from 1913, the other form 1914 are missing from Ms. Maison’s catalog of movies, both of which, peculiarly starred Robert Z. Leonard; not that Leonard was peculiar but that two of Maison’s missing credits were with Leonard. The first was The Stolen Idol, 1913[33] and When Fate Disposes, released in 1914.\n\nMaison Married and After:\n\nEdna Maison married Tom Poste in the late spring of 1911 (the couple eloped and the ceremony was in Santa Ana),[34] he a haberdasher, owning the Alexandria Haberdashers of Los Angeles, located first, in the Hotel Alexandria (at Spring Street and 5th Street), then taking a storefront next to the hotel.[35]\n\nPoste was eleven years her senior and their marriage had many problems from the outset. Maison filed for divorce in late spring of 1913, submitting evidence of a tooth which had been knocked out of her head by her husband; while going through tough times Ms. Maison would move back in with her mother and father. And in fact, the couple resided with the Maisonaves for while; it was a crowded household, for Edna’s sister, Elise (she was an actress as well, known as Elsie Maison[36]) was living there as well. Poste countered Maison’s accusations with a report that she had “a superabundance of temperament;” Edna accused him of as she put it, “a razor hunt,” in early 1913, threatening to kill her. In November of 1912 Masonave tipped a quart of ice water over Poste’s head, while he knocked at the door of their home;[37] a violent and tumultuous relationship is putting it lightly. Maybe the most unusual charges presented by Masonave were those that Poste’s “love of fine clothes was satisfied to the extreme, when she had to wear a summer hat in the winter time.”[38] But the divorce was put on hold until in January of 1915, when the Poste residence was raided by the Police in Glendale, California, for vice related activities and Edna announced she would use the evidence of the raid in her divorce suit; which evidently she did not file.[39] Poste then counter-sued Maison for divorce in 1915, but the case was dismissed; in 1916 he would sue again in early autumn.[40] That was the action which dissolved their marriage sometime in the first ten months of 1917.\n\nMs. Masonave’s second husband was Beverly Howard “Speed” Griffith and unlike her first hubby, Griffith was a Hollywood insider. He was a strikingly good looking man, with dark hair, brown eyes and a dark complexion; not overly tall 5, 10½ and at one-hundred-seventy-five-pounds, a moderate statured man. Griffith, like Masonave, enjoyed the outdoors, swimming, boating and auto-racing. The couple was wed on Thanksgiving Weekend, of 1917 in Los Angeles.[41]\n\nGriffith was in the film-industry in the administrative field and was a resident of Universal City. He began working with Keystone as an assistant property-man, following up by earning the position of assistant to Mack Sennett. Next he was the assistant to general-manager F. J. Balshoffer at the newly organized Sterling Motion Picture Company. Then Carl Laemmle hired him as the business manager for five producing companies at Universal; also Griffith managed Animated Weekly and was the chief cameraman for the news branch at Universal. He also was responsible for some scenarios at Kalem, Sterling and Universal,[42] and in 1918 he was with Sunshine Comedies (a subsidiary of Fox), as an assistant manager.[43]\n\nNot long after their marriage, Masonave quit the movies with no explanation whatsoever. When her husband was stationed in Washington for his service in the army she lived with her parents in Los Angeles. After his discharge, Mr. Griffith traveled much during their marriage, with extended time apart, often taking a room at a boarding house rather than at a hotel. Contrary to popular belief, Masonave and Griffith did not remain wed until her death; the couple was divorced in 1938, it being finalized in Dade County, Florida.\n\nEdna Maison became ill either in late 1941 or early 1942, which sickness she fought for four years;[44] she died on January 11, 1946, in Los Angeles, California. She was buried under her married name of Griffith at Calvary Cemetery on Whittier Boulevard where her father was interred in 1924, and followed three years later by her mother and finally her sister Elise in 1984. Each member of this close-knit family had the same style gravestone, with one word of description above their respective name, that of their relation; in order of their passing: Father; Daughter; Mother; Daughter. Although her career ended almost one-hundred years ago, it is important for us to remember and to celebrate that star of so long ago, who shone brightly for albeit, a brief period of time, yet her distinctive mark is forever left upon the annals of Hollywood’s ever growing biography.\n\nBy C.

Butler is located some one-hundred miles south of Atlanta, and is the county seat of Taylor County. The Griffith’s did not remain in Butler long, moving to 82 Spring Street at the corner of Collins (now the intersection of Currier Street NE and Courtland Street NE); after the death of Howdy Griffith (September 12, 1902[1]) the family moved to 488 Peachtree Street.\n\nAs a youngster, Beverly was a singer and a flautist (he, his brother William and sister L’ Ella, often sang as a trio);[2] he was considered quite the gifted lad.[3] Griffith was a multi-talented, multi-tasking person, with a natural ability to coordinate and delegate; and by all accounts a likeable individual. Griffith was a strikingly good looking man, with dark hair, brown eyes and a dark complexion; not overly tall, 5, 10½ and at one-hundred-seventy-five-pounds (although, later he would weigh-in at near three-hundred[4]), and moderate statured. Griffith enjoyed the outdoors, swimming and boating (yet, apparently prone to seasickness[5]) and had a genuine passion for auto-racing. To understand the man Beverly Griffith, it is enlightening to gain a better grasp of his early influences, his inherent familial traits and the environmental impact of his family…\n\nBeverly Background:\n\nGriffith’s mother, Mary Burke, was a music teacher (she began to advertise her lessons in 1899[6]), a true instructor to Atlanta, Georgia luminaries, with references from notables, including the Governor’s office, a local judge, and the president of a college.[7] Mrs. Griffith was the founder and Director of the Griffith School of Music, located for several years in their home at 488 Peachtree Street, in Atlanta;[8] she was the first woman chimes-ringer in America, and played at the 1893, Columbian Exposition in Chicago.[9] Her fame spread abroad, being mentioned by author Victor Hugo when he said: “the twentieth century is woman’s century’ and as a proof that there is nothing the brain of woman cannot grasp, or her skill manage, Mrs. M. B. Griffith of Atlanta is a living witness.”[10]\n\nThis was truly a talented family, William, the eldest, born in 1880 played the mandolin, and served as secretary of the American Guild of Banjoists, Mandolinists and Guitarists.[11] He was a popular young gentleman in Georgia and was on the guest list for Annie Chandler, daughter of the Peach State Governor, Allen D. Chandler;[12] Will and all of the Griffith children rubbed shoulders with the high-society of Atlanta and Georgia.[13]\n\nL’ Ella (Ella, Luella), the first Griffith daughter was welcomed in 1883, she was a pianist, and taught stringed instruments; in addition, she was a fourth-grade teacher at Formwalt Street School in Atlanta.[14] At one point L’ Ella was the Director of the American Guild of Banjoists, Mandolinists and Guitarists.[15]\n\nFinally, Mary followed in 1890, she more gifted in organization and full of energy, almost tireless in her endeavors in encouraging children to learn history and the promotion of the mandolin, banjo and guitar. Ms. Mary Griffith established several fretted-instrument clubs and directed an Atlanta orchestra, which varied in size from twenty to seventy pieces;[16] William, Ella and Mary each taught music, both privately and at the family owned music school.\n\nBenjamin Griffith was a salesman in Atlanta at the Chamberlin, Johnson & Company, dry goods store; this clothing concern was located at 65 Whitehall Street.[17] Benjamin was heavily involved with the local Methodist Episcopal Church in Butler, sitting on a committee in that congregation;[18] his father was a Physician and minister, Dr. James Griffith,[19] as well, his older brother was a minister, the Rev. Ignatious F. Griffith, at one time the pastor of the Second Street Methodist Church of Macon, Georgia and president of the Methodist ministers of Girard and Columbus, Georgia and Phenix City, Alabama (a suburb of Columbus).[20] In retrospect, Benjamin Howdy Griffith seems lost in the commotion that was the abilities and personalities of his wife and children, with great local celebrity and some national recognition. In contemporary terms, Mr. Griffith was not overshadowed by his four children, since he passed away before his offspring became so well known. Still, he was able to bask in the light of his famous wife, Mary, providing a stable income and in a time when many women were restricted by the egos and upbringing of their husbands, Howdy seemed to have relished Mary’s success. With the aforementioned background, fortitude and elbow-grease, Howard, with the help of his wife afforded an environment conducive to learning, and the opportunities to fail or succeed in their children’s explorations of life. That is what each good father hopes and prays to be able to give and be remembered for.\n\nBeverly Before Tinseltown:\n\nUnlike his siblings, Beverly Griffith had no involvement with the Griffith School of Music; instead, following his father’s professional footsteps in sales. Beverly’s first paid position was that of newspaper carrier, with his own route for the Atlanta Constitution.[21] When Beverly was seventeen (1904) he was a clerk in a store located in the Equitable Building on Pryor Street at the corner of Edgewood Avenue, Atlanta, GA. In 1905 Beverly and his brother William went to Los Angeles, whilst there they attended the Barnum and Bailey Circus in late September, then were the quests at a post circus party at the home of Judge Sale; Beverly evidently had a position in San Francisco, in shoe-sales, for a while.[22] He followed that position with another in sales (1907) at a business-building situated at 43 Peachtree in Atlanta. Griffith was a graduate of the Georgia Military College in Milledgeville,[23] which lies about one-hundred-miles southeast of Atlanta. Georgia Military is a junior college and at the time of Mr. Griffith’s matriculation, it was a conduit, enabling graduates to enter higher learning at the University of Georgia.\n\nBeverly or “Speed” as he was known had a fascination with racing, which lead to a school days (or during his racing days, which and when is unclear) relationship with Eddie Rickenbacker,[24] who would prove himself in WWI as the “ace pilot;” this friendship would benefit greatly, Griffith, two decades hence.\n\nWhen Griffith left Atlanta, in 1910, he made a short term stay in Parker, in the territory of Arizona,[25] then moving on to Los Angeles. There he worked at the New Broadway Hotel at 205-207 North Broadway (between West 1st Street and Temple Street), first as a bell-boy, then advancing to steward, by summer he was the engineer for the hotel, next moving ahead to assistant manager and finally acting as general-manager of the hotel.[26]\n\nBeverly in Hollywood:\n\nGriffith worked in the film-industry primarily in the administrative field and was a resident of Universal City. His beginning foray into the movies came in early 1913 when Griffith went to Pinecrest, near San Bernardino, CA,[27] with the Keystone Company; he was working as an assistant to the property-man, and found his way into three films, two of which were directed by Mack Sennett.\n\nBeverly Howard Griffith followed up the property-man job by earning the position of assistant to Mack Sennett; where he was credited as the “original Keystone stunt driver.”[28] Next he was the assistant to general-manager to F. J. Balshoffer at the newly organized Sterling Motion Picture Company; while there he was described as the director of comedian, Ford Sterling.[29] How many untold credits are lost in the director’s chair for Mr. Griffith? We will most likely never know.\n\nGriffith’s preoccupation with car-racing unfortunately extended to high speeds on public highways; he faced a one-year suspended sentence for speeding. Friends were concerned when during his probation he bought a new Packard, and whether or not he and the car could behave.[30]\n\nCarl Laemmle hired Beverly away from Sterling to be the business manager for five producing companies at Universal and the occasional location manager;[31] also Griffith managed Animated Weekly and was the director, correspondent and chief cameraman for the news branch at Universal; it was with Universal that Griffith hit his cinematic stride. The need for speed for Mr. Griffith found its outlet in stunt-driving which director Otis Turner availed him of, in the five-reel flick, A Little Brother of the Rich, based on Joseph Medill Patterson’s novel. Griffith, the location (assistant-director or second-unit-director) drove a seven-passenger Oldsmobile, which cost more than $1,500.00 (more than $34,000 as of 2015). The gag required Griffith to cross the Santa Fe Railroad, with an approaching train coming full speed, he and his passengers survived with nary a scratch, although, at least one of the occupants of the car were afraid that they were going to die.[32] While at Universal, Beverly Griffith worked as an assistant-director on action-pictures under veteran director Henry MacRae;[33] a copse, as it were, of films Griffith was attached to but without credit and has been cut down from our knowledge.\n\nAlso, this was the period when Griffith earned the nickname “Speed,” (one would have assumed the moniker was for his love of car racing) when, as director of Animated Weekly he began to scoop other film-news services in Los Angeles. Particularly, this was true on September 24, 1915, when his camera-crew shot footage of the memorial service where the last honors were paid to the Reverend Thomas J. Conaty (Bishop of the Monterey and Los Angles diocese). Within six hours after the service closed, the news-reel had been developed, printed and dried and then put into the caring hands of Beverly Griffith. He personally delivered the film to Quinn’s Superba Theater at 518 S. Broadway, in downtown Los Angeles.[34]\n\nBeverly also was responsible for some scenarios at Kalem, Sterling and Universal;[35] the two titles that are known are The Bingville Fire Department, 1914 and The Diamonds of Destiny, 1917. With Diamonds of Destiny, real diamonds were supplied by the Los Angeles jewelry concern of the Montgomery Brothers (long time jewelers in the area); the stones valued at $325,000 were personally escorted by Monroe Montgomery.[36] Any other scenario work by Griffith, is lost to time and the vagaries of early cinematic attribution. In 1918 he was with Sunshine Comedies (a subsidiary of Fox), as an assistant manager.[37] Beverly Griffith when not involved with office politics and scheduling productions and overseeing location shooting, saw war first-hand. Universal sent Griffith to Mexico to be imbedded with the United States Army, in pursuit of Francisco (Pancho) Villa. His job was to secure actual photographs of the fighting and subjects that would prove interesting for Animated Weekly, the Universal news-reel. Beverly Griffith acted as correspondent for the eleven-week Mexico excursion into the battle fray with Gilbert Warrenton his cameraman; taking in scenes of both American and Mexican armies and expeditions. No sooner had Griffith returned to Universal City, that he and cameraman Robert Walters went back to the Mexican border and the footage sent home revealed they got the “close up” of the military actions.[38]\n\nWhat is missing from Mr. Griffith’s résumé is that he directed for Universal, What Darwin Missed (AKA: The Missing Link), in 1916.[39] This movie and other credits that belong to Mr. Griffith have incorrectly been attributed to Beverly H. Griffith, an actress; this is a mistake and is cleared up by a press release seen in newspapers and trade-papers in 1916.[40] Mr. Griffith of Universal and it’s Animated Weekly, is directly connected to, The Missing Link or What Darwin Missed.[41] As stated before (I know, by now, ad nauseam) these titles in his work-history are lost by the thoughtless and sometimes capricious lack of onscreen credit.[42]\n\nAs with most in early Hollywood even if the work was behind the scenes or behind the camera, sometimes the opportunity arose to go in front and do a little acting. Griffith was no exception and appeared in, The Sleuths at the Floral Parade, Toplitsky and Company and Cohen Saves the Flag, each released in 1913. Making a Living was the next project for him before the camera in 1914 and finally his turn in Cheating the Public, which opened in 1918.\n\nDuring these years, through the onset of WWI and its conclusion, Eddie Rickenbacker and Griffith kept in close contact, even when separated by thousands of miles and the Atlantic Ocean. Of course Rickenbacker oft decorated, but Griffith acquitted himself well in the war effort, rising to the rank of Sergeant Major, stationed seven months in Seattle, Washington, as a master electrician, air service.[43]\n\nBeverly Private and Eastern:\n\nGriffith married actress Edna Maison, with the ceremony on Thanksgiving Weekend, of 1917 in Los Angeles.[44] Mr. Griffith traveled much during their marriage, with extended time apart, often taking a room at a boarding house rather than at a hotel. His business (various film exchanges) journeys took him to Hawaii, Cuba, England and China.[45] Contrary to popular belief, Maison and Griffith did not remain wed until her death; the couple was divorced in 1938, it being finalized in Dade County, Florida. This was year two for Griffith with Eastern and Miami International Airport was the headquarters for the airline company; which goes a long way explaining the reason for the dissolution of the Maison and Griffith marriage in Florida, since having been wed in California.[46]\n\nSubsequent to Beverly Griffith’s time in Hollywood, it was natural after the movie-industry (especially with his experience in sales and promotion), that he would accept a position in public relations. In a way this was a professional return of sorts for Griffith, having started in publicity prior to 1910. He became the director of public affairs at Eastern Airlines.[47] He was hired in 1936 by close friend and famed WWI Medal of Honor pilot Eddie Rickenbacker, who had recently been appointed as General Manager of Eastern.[48] Griffith’s tireless work and affability with all, garnered him the honor of being listed as one of the “Big Four,” of 1939, amongst airline publicity men.[49] His hard work and ideas were not confined to promotion but thinking outside the box, being on the alert for novel ideas. He championed the proposal of transporting mail from Camden Airport to the Philadelphia 30th Street, Post Office by autogiro (10 minutes in transport) rather than by truck which needed about 45 minutes allowed for the transfer; realizing what faster mail delivery would do for Eastern.[50] On the occasion of his fiftieth anniversary (1957) in public-relations, seventy-eight of the nation’s prominent newspaper, radio, television and newsreel personalities signed a scroll to commemorate and honor Griffith’s long work in the field.[51]\n\nBeverly Griffith died in 1970 on April 17 and was interred at the Butler Memorial Cemetery, in Butler, Georgia. Eastern Air Lines in tribute to Griffith flew a jet over the cemetery.[52] Beverly Griffith lived life as he drove: fast, hard and with the purpose of winning.\n\nBy C. S.
