        "text": "Course Description\n\nAn historical survey of film from the advent of commercial motion pictures in the 1890s, the proliferation of national cinema movements throughout the 20th century, and the influence of each in the formation of a global film culture at the beginning of the twenty-first century.\n\nBecause it is impossible to survey the entire history of film in a single semester that meets once a week, we will be focusing on two broad themes in pre–World War II era and in the post-World War II era.\n\nFollowing the commercialization of motion pictures in the late nineteenth century and the development of narrative techniques in the early years of the twentieth century, national cinemas emerged throughout the world. Filmmakers working these national cinemas emphasized certain stylistic techniques in their filmmaking. For example, American cinema emphasizes storytelling over all other techniques, while filmmakers in the Soviet Union theorized that editing was the most important technique. We will focus our study in the prewar era on these national cinema tendencies. We cover this in modules 1–6.\n\nFollowing World War II, new waves of filmmaking that focused less on the differences between nations in favor of the common bonds between people. There was also an emergence of modernism in film, breaking established conventions of the previous generations. We cover this in modules 7–12.\n\nThe midterm exam divides the modules and our coverage of these broad themes.\n\nRemote Online Course\n\nThis course will be conducted remotely over the Internet.\n\nMost learning activities will be asynchronous, meaning that you will complete these on your own time.

We will begin our first synchronous meeting on Wednesday, January 27.\n\nRead the Welcome Message I sent to enrolled students\n\nGet the required textbook: Film History, 4th ed.\n\nRead Thompson and Bordwell, Chapter 1, “The Invention and Early Years of the Cinema,\" available on Vitalsource\n\nIntroduce yourself and ask a question about the course, if you have one, on the discussion board on Canvas\n\nModule 1: Invention of Cinema, January 27\n\nThe invention of motion pictures in the late 19th century was a combination of breakthroughs in photography, persistence of vision, industrialization, and a commercial fascination with visual entertainment. By the early years of the 20th century, filmmakers developed novel techniques to tell stories that would keep audiences interested in the movies and an entire industry to exhibit these films.\n\nAll films in this module are silent films. Any music or other sounds were added years later. The soundtrack you may hear should not be considered part of the original filmmakers’ work.\n\nRead Thompson and Bordwell, Chapter 2, “The International Expansion of the Cinema, 1905–1912,\" available on Vitalsource\n\nWatch the recorded lectures:\n\nMotion Picture Terminology (5 min.)\n\nInvention of Motion Pictures (7 min.)\n\nEdison and American Film Industry (5 min.)\n\nBeyond the Peepshow (13 min.)\n\nEdison’s Cartel and the Independents (10 min.)\n\nWatch Edison films\n\nDickson Greeting (1891, less than a min.) The video repeats the original film, first in slow motion, then again at full speed.\n\nMen Boxing (1891, less than a min.)\n\nEdison Kinetoscopic Record of a Sneeze (1894, less than a min.)\n\nAthlete with Wand (1894, less than a min.)\n\nThe Boxing Cats (Prof. Welton’s) (1894, less than a min.) Cat videos appeared prior to the Internet and this one was made to film Professor Welton’s cat circus.\n\nFire Rescue Scene (1894, less than a min.) The first of many, many films made at the time involving firemen rescuing people from fires.\n\nJohn C. Rise–Mary Irwin Kiss (1896, less than a min.) An onscreen kiss between two famous stage actors of the time.\n\nFiremen Rescuing Men and Women (1899, less than a min.) Another film of firemen rescuing people from a burning blaze.\n\nA Wringing Good Joke (1899, less than a min.) A prank that would work well on a stage; notice the use of deep space so the woman doesn’t see the kid pulling the prank.\n\nWatch Lumière Brothers films\n\nWorkers Leaving the Factory (1895, less than a min.) Note the amount of motion that is captured, especially the large number of people walking in various outfits.\n\nFeeding the Baby (1895, less than a min.) Note the amount of motion, including the trees reflected in the adjacent window.\n\nArrival of a Train at Ciotat (1895, less than a min.) The myth that people jumped out of their seats when they saw films like this is not true, but it may have been a marketing gimmick about the realism of these motion pictures.\n\nThe Sprinkler Sprinkled (1895, less than a min.) One of my all time favorites because it looks like something prepared for the stage where the actors hit their marks. Note that the kid and the gardener never walk outside of the frame.\n\nSnowball Fight (1896, less than a min.) A quick prank that seems right from a stage. Note how the bicycle never leaves the frame.\n\nDemolition of a Wall (1896, less than a min.) This shows us the possibilities of film in not just demonstrating how it can capture reality but also how it can manipulate time and space.\n\nLeaving Jerusalem by Railway (1896, less than a min.) The legend of the first tracking shot was that it was captured on accident.\n\nWatch Edwin S. Porter films\n\nJack and the Beanstalk (1902, 9 min.) Porter’s interpretation of the famous fable.\n\nLife of an American Fireman (1903, 7 min.) Yes, another fire rescue film. But this one is set across various scenes as film narration develops.\n\nThe Great Train Robbery (1903, 10 min.) This is the most famous film of the early silent era and one that was copied many times. Rescue scenes were—and still remain—a common dramatic trick for most movies. The color tinting was done by hand.\n\nRescued from an Eagle’s Nest (1908, 7 min.) I can imagine that they needed to make another rescue film and, Porter, who is likely exhausted every other story idea for a rescue film, asks, “what if an eagle kidnaps a baby?” The heroic father is played by D.W. Griffith.\n\nWatch George Méliès trick films\n\nA Trip to the Moon (1902, 12 min.) Méliès’s best-known film based on the science fiction of Jules Verne. Note that the moon-dwellers resemble native Africans, which has some resonance for France’s colonial history.\n\nThe Black Imp (1905, 4 min.). One of my favorite films by Méliès for its playfulness of having a mysterious imp (a devil) appear and disappear to haunt a hotel guest.\n\nThe Eclipse: Courtship of the Sun and Moon (1907, 9 min.) There are some great optical tricks here to give the sun and moon some personalities.\n\nWatch An Unseen Enemy (D.W. Griffith, USA, 1912, 15 min.) It’s hard to justify Griffith’s racist views, but I think it’s unwise to dismiss the ingenuity of this film.\n\nWatch The Cheat (Cecil B. deMille, USA, 1915, 60 min.) Content warning: depicts man branding a woman.\n\nAvailable on DVD at Pratt Library\n\nAvailable on Google Drive\n\nFind where to stream on Just Watch\n\nReference my list of relevant films on Letterboxd\n\nComplete Quiz 1 on Canvas, due January 26, 11:59 PM\n\nJoin the Live Discussion Session on Zoom:\n\nSection 1: 10:00 AM\n\nModule 2: Weimar Germany and Mise-en-Scène, February 3\n\nIn the years following its defeat in World War I, German filmmakers borrowed from painting and theater to craft a distinct style that would influence filmmakers throughout the world for many decades.\n\nAll films in this module are silent films.
