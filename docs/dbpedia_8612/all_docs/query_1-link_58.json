        "meta_description": "The essay The Significance of the Individual was one of Carl Schmitt&rsquo;s first publications in 1914. It is by no means an easy read. But for those who do pick it up, this text might seem to reinforce a portrait of Schmitt we had already assumed. For here we find Schmitt the &ldquo;anti-individualist&rdquo;, willing to confer dignity to individuals only on the basis of their functional utility to the constitutional state. This hardly seems the basis for a social contract worthy of the name. In this presentation, however, I wish to take another look at this early text. For rather than brute submission of individuals to the state, leading to social undifferentiation, Schmitt actually claims to be offering a &ldquo;metaphysics of the self&rdquo;, leading to emancipation and flourishing of individuals within a larger aggregate. Thus, he writes: &ldquo;the derivation of the value of the individual from its task [&hellip;] does not destroy the dignity of the individual. Rather, it opens up the possibility of a justified dignity in the first place&rdquo;. By considering this little-known early text, I will try to show how Schmitt envisages humans transitioning from an atomised and antagonistic state of nature to a form of harmonious social existence, and how this sets the scene for his later (and better-known) work in political philosophy.",
