        "text": "This article is about the German jurist and political theorist. For the American artist, see Carl Schmitt (artist). For New Zealand violinist and composer, see Carl Schmitt (composer). For people with a similar name, see Carl Schmidt.\n\nCarl Schmitt[lower-alpha 1] (11 July 1888 – 7 April 1985) was a German jurist, political theorist, and prominent member of the Nazi Party.\n\nQuick Facts Born, Died ...\n\nClose\n\nBorn in Plettenberg in 1888, Schmitt studied law in Berlin, Munich, and Strasbourg. In 1916, he married his first wife, Pavla Dorotić, but divorced her after realizing that she had pretended to be a countess. Schmitt was Catholic but broke with the church in the 1920s. He married Duška Todorović in 1926. During this time, he taught in Greifswald, Bonn, and Munich and published Dictatorship and Political Theology. Schmitt taught in Cologne in 1932, published The Concept of the Political, and supported the Papen government in Prussia v. Reich. After the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor in 1933, Schmitt joined the Nazi Party. He was an active jurist, a member of the Prussian State Council, and a professor in Berlin. In 1936 Schmitt was forced to resign his political role when the SS targeted him, but Hermann Göring protected him. After the Second World War ended, Schmitt spent over a year in an internment camp and returned to Plettenberg. He refused denazification, which barred him from academic positions. However, he continued his studies and frequently received scholarly visitors. In 1963, he published the Theory of the Partisan. Schmitt died on 7 April 1985 at the age of 96."
