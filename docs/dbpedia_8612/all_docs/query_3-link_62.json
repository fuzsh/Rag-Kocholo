        "text": "Shneur Zalman’s Break from Traditional Jewish Legal Philosophy\n\nSchmitt’s insistence that law stems from the will of the sovereign is an idea that shares significant parallels with the thought of Shneur Zalman of Lyady. Schmitt’s understanding of law helps clarify a similar emphasis in this important Hasidic thinker whose contributions to Jewish legal philosophy have largely been overlooked. While Schmitt focuses on normativity in the Western legal tradition, Shneur Zalman is concerned with divine law as it is outlined in a particular religious corpus. Yet, despite their disparate points of focus, they share similar understandings about the nature of law. Viewing Shneur Zalman through a Schmittian lens helps to highlight an arational, decisionistic strand of Jewish legal philosophy that has not been widely appreciated.\n\nThe best place to begin analyzing Shneur Zalman’s legal philosophy is with the principle that underlies much of his theology, including and especially his philosophy of law: the doctrine of dira betachtonim, which can be roughly translated as “a home for God in the physical world.” This doctrine asserts that God, who resides in the highest of heavens, desires to have an abode in the lowest of “worlds”—the physical world.Footnote 27 In Tanya, Shneur Zalman’s manual for religious living and philosophy, in the context of emphasizing the primacy of action over study, Shneur Zalman explains the doctrine of dira betachtonim: “Study is not the essential thing, but rather, as it is written, action is ‘today to do them,’ which is why one interrupts Torah study to fulfill an actionable mitzvah when it cannot be fulfilled by others, because this is the entirety of man and the purpose of his creation and descent into this world, which is for God to have a home in the lowers specifically and transform the darkness to light such that God’s will fills all of the physical earth, specifically.”Footnote 28\n\nEvident in this passage is Shneur Zalman’s prioritization of mitzvot over Torah study, a point to which I will return below. For current purposes, what is important is the fact that when Shneur Zalman states that God desires a home in the lowest of worlds, he intends the paradoxical union of the transcendent with the immanent. What is noteworthy is not so much that this is what God desires, but why God desires it. Shneur Zalman’s explanation can be distilled into two words: God’s will. Why would God desire the lowest of worlds in the Kabbalistic imagination to be God’s “home”—that is, as Shneur Zalman puts it, the exclusive place where God’s essence (in contrast to God’s mere “reflection”) can be revealed? Shneur Zalman teaches that “paradox” lies at the heart of the answer.Footnote 29 The “explanation” Shneur Zalman provides is the antithesis of a reason and thus highlights the nonexplanatory nature of God’s will. God wills the transformation of the lowest world into a home for no other reason than the very paradox of the project itself: “reasonably” it is impossible for God—who is infinite—to merge with the lowly, finite world, let alone be fully expressed in it.Footnote 30\n\nIn this vein, Shneur Zalman’s grandson, Menachem Mendel of Lubavitch (the Tzemach Tzedek)—the third leader of Habad Hasidism—explains in his grandfather’s name the arational nature of God’s will: “the ‘lowers’ means the most concealed, for what is most concealed is called ‘lowest,’ and God desires to have a dwelling in the lowest, meaning that His essence should be revealed below … just like a home of a man is where his essence is revealed … and why God desires this is unknown, only that He desires it (and I have heard that when Shneur Zalman said in his old discourses in Liozna that God desires a home in the lowers, [he said] ‘regarding a desire one cannot ask questions’).”Footnote 31\n\nThe home is the unique place where one exposes one’s full and true self, in Habad terminology, one’s essence, and this is precisely what God desires of the physical world: that it be transformed into God’s home. Such a “desire” is incomprehensible, indeed it is analytically impossible, but all inquiries abruptly dissolve when one accepts, simply and definitively, that with respect to “desire[,] one cannot ask questions.”Footnote 32 One cannot make sense of God’s will, as it is beyond sense. Put differently, its sense lies precisely in its non-sense. What can be inferred from Shneur Zalman’s teaching of dira betachtonim is not only that God’s will to have a home in the world is the raison d’être of Judaism but also that the overarching will that the lowest world should be transformed into God’s home serves as the legal reasoning that underlies all of performative Judaism. Dira betachtonim explains why one should “perform,” which is to say, obey, Judaism’s laws; according to Shneur Zalman, it is exclusively by fulfilling Judaism’s commandments that dira betachtonim is effected.\n\nMitzvot have the unparalleled ability to draw from that which is otherwise inaccessible because mitzvot alone can draw from what is highest: God’s essence.Footnote 33 In Shneur Zalman’s words, the objective of religion is “not to receive a reward, which is the world to come and the supernal gan eden (heaven), but rather only ‘and with You’—God Himself and His essence—‘to Him and not His attributes.’ And how can one draw down God Himself and His essence? This is through the mitzvot.”Footnote 34 What is it about mitzvot specifically that makes them uniquely able to traverse the boundary between the infinite and finite and effectuate the former’s descent into the latter? Once again, it is God’s “will” that provides the answer for Shneur Zalman. Every mitzvah stems from God’s will: “The mitzvot themselves are the will of God, [so that there can be] a drawing down of the or ein sof (infinite light) Blessed Be He below in the six-hundred-thirteen biblical mitzvot and seven rabbinic ones which comprise six-hundred-twenty pillars of light, and similar to a pillar, they unite that which is above with that which is below; for it is God’s will that He should have a home in the lowers.”Footnote 35 Since God’s overarching will is to have a home in the physical world, God extends the mitzvot, each of which is ontologically made up of God’s “will,” such that Jews can fulfill them and thereby draw God into the world. With this explanation, Shneur Zalman communicates that the underlying mystical reason for Judaism’s legal system is God’s “will” in a general sense, but also that God’s multiple particular “wills” for specific mitzvot endow each mitzvah with the ability to draw God into the world. Because each mitzvah originates in God’s will, it is a manifestation of God and effectuates a descent of God into the world.Footnote 36\n\nBased on this understanding, we arrive at a more crystallized framework with which to appreciate Shneur Zalman’s contribution to Jewish legal philosophy. Before continuing, though, it is worth pausing to briefly take account of the enterprise of Jewish legal philosophy that preceded Shneur Zalman, which is marked not by broad deference to God’s will but by the project of ta-amei ha-mitzvot—providing elaborate rationalizations for performing each of Judaism’s commandments."
