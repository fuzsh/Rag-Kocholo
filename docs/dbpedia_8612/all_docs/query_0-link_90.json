        "text": "“Philosophy and Dictatorship”\n\nA Seminar in Political Theory and Comparative Politics: PolS60443\n\nA. James McAdams\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nThis seminar is based upon a puzzle: Why did some of the great philosophers of the 20th century choose to align themselves with totalitarian regimes? In approaching this question, scholars typically begin with the political views of these thinkers. In contrast, I start with their philosophical perspectives. I maintain that the way these thinkers responded to basic philosophical questions (about epistemology, morality, and human agency) can provide us with valuable insight into their political choices.\n\nMy approach to this seminar is shaped by two assumptions. First, I make the assumption that one can distinguish between responsible philosophizing and that which is potentially perverse and pathological. Second, I assume that there is something distinctive about the mindset of those philosophers who embraced totalitarian dictatorships in particular. In my view, the positions they espoused during the first half of the past century signified a fundamental break with conceptions of truth, goodness, and human dignity that had become commonplace since the era of the Enlightenment. Admittedly, both of my assumptions could be wrong, but I consider this a good thing. It means that there is room for argument about matters of great importance to all students of political theory and comparative politics.\n\nTo this end, I begin our seminar with a philosopher who can reasonably be associated with key aspects of Enlightenment thought, Immanuel Kant. Then, I turn to a twentieth-century philosopher, Giovanni Gentile, who rejected crucial elements of this tradition and became an avowed supporter of Italian fascism. After making this stark comparison, I interweave the arguments of three “responsible” respondents to Kantian thinking—G.W.F. Hegel, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Nietzsche—with three of Gentile’s contemporaries, György Lukács, Carl Schmitt, and Martin Heidegger. Alas, these three thinkers, too, achieved notoriety for abandoning their scruples and championing totalitarian causes. But why did they take this path?\n\nRequired readings\n\nI have sought to reduce the cost of your readings as much as possible by choosing either the cheapest editions or giving you alternate sources. For most of the primary sources below, you may use other editions if you already own them. The only exception is Nisbet's translation of Hegel's lectures on world history, which you must use. I have ensured that all but two of the readings in the Reader (Lukács and Heidegger) are covered by Fair Use, and thus free. Finally, you can find many of the required and recommended readings on electronic reserve or in hardcopy at the Hesburgh Reserve Desk. Nota Bene: In order to participate effectively, you must bring a physical copy of each of the required primary readings to class.\n\nImmanuel Kant, On History. Introduction by Lewis White Beck (Bobbs-Merrill, 1963).\n\nGeorg W. F. Hegel, Lectures on the Philosophy of World History. Trans. by Hugh Barr Nisbet (Cambridge University Press, 1975).\n\nCharles Taylor, Hegel and Modern Society (Cambridge University Press, 1979).\n\nKarl Marx, Selected Writings, edited by Lawrence H. Simon (Hacket Publishing, 1994).\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, Introduced and Translated by R. J. Hollingdale (Penguin Classics, 2003).\n\nCarl Schmitt, Political Theology, Preface by Tracy Strong, (University of Chicago Press, 2006).\n\nCourse Reader (available in the O'Shaghnessy Copy Office), with readings from Hannah Arendt, Martin Heidegger, Raymond Aron, Karl Popper, Richard Wolin, Stephen Holmes, and others.\n\nAdditional readings, electronic sources, articles and videos on the World Wide Web, and (eventually) class essays can be found on this page. We will communicate with each other by means of the course listserv: pols60443-01-sp08@listserv.nd.edu and its archives.\n\nCourse Structure\n\nOver the course of this seminar, we will pose three questions about the perspectives of each of the eight philosophers above: 1) What is the argument? 2) What is the argument meant to do? and 3) What are its political implications? In the best of all possible worlds, it would be convenient if we didn't have to worry about the first question since no single seminar can pretend to provide adequate coverage of all of these thinkers. Yet this class will only work if everyone is exposed to at least the rudiments of each philosopher's position. We will put most of our energy into the second question which, for me, is the most important of all for the comparative purposes of this seminar. In my view, we can only understand the significance of each argument if we recognize an essential fact---each figure is writing in a specific historical context and is therefore responding to a particular strain of intellectual inquiry that transcends individual identity. Finally, to demonstrate the potential connection between philosophy and dictatorship, we will consider the political views of all four of our totalitarian enthusiasts.\n\nThe selection of reading assignments for this seminar has been challenging. In the following syllabus, I have sought to identify key sections of our eight philosophers' works that I consider essential for understanding their respective positions. In addition, I have either required or suggested secondary accounts of their scholarship that will, I hope, provide useful shorthands to each of their agendas. This solution won't satisfy the purist, but were I to take any other approach, I would be unable to offer a course that tests the customary boundaries between comparative politics and political theory.\n\nEvaluations\n\nOver the semester, graduate students will write one integrated paper. This will be based on three theorists from the course, at least one of whom will be taken from the pathological philosophies. I will advise you on the deadline for this paper later. At this point, grading for graduate students will be optional. The entire paper will be due before exam week.\n\nUndergraduate students will write two separate papers, each of which will be drawn from one \"responsible\" philosopher and one perverse thinker. I still need to determine the deadline for the first paper. The other paper will be due before final exam week. Both of these papers will be graded.\n\nUpdate (February 15, 2008)\n\nUndergraduate Mid-term Essay\n\nGraduate Student Essay\n\nParticipation will play a significant role in final course grades.\n\n---\n\nSchedule\n\nWeek One: A Puzzle - Philosophy and Dictatorship\n\nA preliminary discussion: What is Enlightenment?\n\nWeek Two: Philosophy and its Enemies\n\nAgenda for Discussion\n\nPolitical Wisdom from Star Wars\n\nRequired:\n\nHannah Arendt, “Karl Marx and the Tradition of Western Political Thought,” Social Research, v. 69, n. 2 (Summer 2002), only 273-287.
