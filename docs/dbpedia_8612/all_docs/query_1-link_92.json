        "text": "There’s something wrong with this contention that the friend-enemy distinction is fundamental to war. It’s necessary, in the same way that arms are, but it’s not a fundamental cause.\n\nI think the problem is with Schmitt’s formulation: To demand seriously of human beings that they kill others and be prepared to die themselves so that trade and industry may flourish for the survivors or that the purchasing power of grandchildren may grow is sinister and crazy.\n\nWhat then does Schmitt think it means to fight for “national greatness”? Yet it is exactly that formulation that has driven plenty of wars. It is not clear to me that Britain or France’s wars of colonial conquest were really driven by any meaningful friend/enemy distinction. “National greatness” was certainly the major motivator for most participants.\n\nNo, no politician is so crass as to say “we’re fighting for oil” or something of the sort. But during the first Gulf War, one of the better defenses I heard for it was that it was really all about oil, because oil is life and death for America. Phrasing it as “protecting America’s interests” rather than defending America’s “national greatness” is not much more than a change of terms. I think a lot of people understand the economic reality those phrases stand for.\n\nThis kind of strict essentialism seems rife in continental thinking, and sometimes analytic philosophy: “Properly speaking, X has nothing whatsoever to do with Y”, which sometimes means only “X and Y are not exactly the same; some Xes are not Y, and some Ys are not X”: whereas there might be a very strong “family resemblance”, statistical overlap, or historical relationship between X and Y .\n\n“Properly” in this phrase seems to mean “speaking appropriately and rightly” but really means “defining these terms as narrowly as possible”.\n\nSo I think that Schmitt’s first mistake, one to which philosophical types are terribly successful, was to look for an essence in the first place. But the particular essence he chose seems to show a bias toward conflict and violence on his part.\n\nI haven’t read Otto, but what Kotsko said seems right. You might even be able to make a collection of definitions of this kind.\n\nThe point I was trying to make was slightly more subtle than the one I actually did make.\n\nInsofar as it makes sense to discuss of the “friend-enemy” distinction as a priori and fundamental, economic motives will be the reason. You are plopped down in some country and for various ahistorical reasons it will make sense to go to invade your neighbors and come back with some nice loot. Thus, certain people/countries will be your enemies merely by virtue of being where they are and having what they have.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily the only reason someone will be your enemy–just that the other enemies will be your enemies for reasons contingent on your specific historical relationship with those people. Most notably, you could be pissed about the last time they came over and took your stuff, regardless of whether it makes economic sense to go try to get your stuff backâ€”Alsace-Lorraine, anyone?\n\nIf you look at wars in the modern era, I believe they mostly support this interpretation. Either they take place in area’s where the modern economic system hasn’t integrated sufficiently yet and the “invade-and-loot” method still makes sense (thinking mostly of Africa/ME here) or the wars have pretty direct lineages to prior wars (thinking mainly of all the wars caused by decolonization etc.) There are a few wars that donâ€™t fit this mold, mainly the proxy wars in the shadow of the Cold War, and I am uncertain as to there classification, although I suspect they are somewhat of a combination of the above.\n\nEssentially I think Schmitt is conflating two different understandings of “enemy”. The first is where people are enemies merely because they are–cue the crime lord telling his victim that it is “only business.” The second is where people are enemies because they truly hate the other person. Only the former is really fundamental in the way Schmitt wants it to be and it is also the type which has mostly had its legs cut out from under it by the modern economic system. The latter can still cause wars, but it is also not a fundamental property, as it depends on all sorts of historical peculiarities as a yet more fundamental cause.\n\nLastly, I am wary about explaining wars in terms of the interests of the “elites,” especially in democracies. This isn’t to say that it isn’t accurate, but rather that it sounds dangerously close to some Marxian conception of â€œfalse consciousness.” This carries with it all the usual problems, not the least of which is that it is very often a self-sealer.\n\nSchmitt reluctantly concluded that he lived in a democratic age. His problem was how to maintain a decent, hierarchical society despite the fact that the population couldn’t just be ignored in a time of mass conscription armies. Since mass conscription armies are an anachronism now, I assume that a resurrected Schmitt would have to change his tune a bit. “Democracy” has been a rather meaningless word for quite a while now.\n\nI agree with John Quiggin that Schmitt is or ought to be considered a pathological character. What bothers me is that his kind of thinking has struck a chord, not only with rightists, but with people who are officially supposed to be liberals. Indeed, most of the themes of early 20th Century fascism and extreme authoritarianism have resurfaced in this last couple of decades, though I’m not sure whether the Neocons and liberal hawks recognize that their integral nationalism, voluntarism, and the cult of the Enemy put ’em in pretty bad company. The point here, however, isn’t to call anybody bad names. Indeed, political correctness has made it impossible to admit that, as a matter of fact, fascism or at any event its ideological matrix is very appealing to intellectuals.\n\nIf you want an elegantly written encapsulation of the â€œsinister and crazyâ€ thinking that gives us wars, Schmitt is your man\n\nWell, I think he’s a bad writer, but the following doesn’t strike me as particularly sinister or crazy (from before and after John Holbo’s second quote):\n\nNo program, no ideal, no norm, no expediency confers a right to dispose of the physical life of other human beings. […] There exists no rational purpose, no norm no matter how true, no program no matter how exemplary, no social ideal no matter how beautiful, no legitimacy nor legality which could justify men in killing each other for this reason. If such physical destruction of human life is not motivated by an existential threat to one’s own way of life, then it cannot be justified. Just as little can war be justified by ethical and juristic norms. If there really are enemies in the existential sense as meant here, then it is justified, but only politically, to repel and fight them physically. (p46)\n\nI can’t find Schmitt to be “placidly untroubled”, in John’s phrase, by war here. Obviously there are arguments to be had about what constitutes an “existential threat”, and Schmitt might have a sinister notion about that somewhere else, which wouldn’t surprise me given his history. But this particular text isn’t very ambivalent about the desirability of war in general.\n\nJQ – I still can’t see where any of John H’s or my quotes necessarily promote irrational hatred: what I just cited appears to say clearly that war, though it often arises through irrational hatred, is only justified in the presence of a real “existential threat” (defined howsoever).\n\nI guess one’s reading hangs on whether one thinks of Schmitt as being descriptive (lamentably, although there are rarely good reasons for war, unjustified wars happen anyway because irrational hatred is stoked up) or normative (irrational hatred is a good reason for war). On the surface, the passages here cited seem to me to be saying the former. I don’t see a good textual reason to read them otherwise. I would hesitate to decide my interpretation on some such basis as “He was a fascist, so he must have meant the latter.” (Not that I am accusing you of doing so.)\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that his prose does not really distinguish clearly between descriptive and normative modes. He may even, of course, be obscuring the difference deliberately, encoding a hidden message for initiates Ã la Strauss.\n\nI must admit, I don’t see the problem with saying â€œHe was a fascist, so he must have meant the latter.â€, at least if you substitute “Nazi” for “fascist”. It’s absurd to postulate an anti-war Nazi, so only the pro-war reading is left.\n\nSo, the “existential threat” language could be read to mean that only purely defensive war is permissible, but if Schmitt had meant that he would have ended up in Buchenwald or exile. Alternatively, it could mean something like a maximal Lebensraum doctrine – the existence of the Aryan race is incompatible with anything less than absolute power in Europe. My money is on this interpretation.\n\nI guess the hidden message interpretation is also possible, but then which is the esoteric and which the exoteric?\n\nThis links to the more general problem of whether a philosopher’s views can/should be linked to their political actions. Heidegger is the obvious problem case – I’ve been thinking about a post on this."
