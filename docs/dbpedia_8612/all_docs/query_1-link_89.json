Covering topics such as the political significance of universalism and jurisprudence, the meaning of the partisan, the world-historical significance of the Cold War, the deterioration of metaphysics into “values,” the relationship between theoretical concepts and concrete historical situations, and his views on thinkers such as Machiavelli, Bodin, and Rousseau, these essays establish a revealing counterpoint to his more formal work.

On the other hand, he also feels free to provide in these pieces the kinds of methodological reflections that help us to better understand the particular epistemological framework that makes his thought so unique.\n\nPraise for Carl Schmitt’s The Tyranny of Values and Other Texts\n\n“Although he didn’t coin the term ‘political correctness,’ Carl Schmitt certainly penned the first critique of the phenomenon in The Tyranny of Values—and what an incendiary critique it was. Sam Zeitlin’s fine translation brings to the fore all the nuance and bile of Schmitt’s broadside against the ethical legacy of the Enlightenment in postwar Germany. The volume also includes wide-ranging essays by Schmitt on authors such as Machiavelli and Hobbes, and on developments such as Maoism and Vatican II. The Tyranny of Values and Other Texts is a crucial contribution to the study of far-right conservatism in the Cold War era—and in our own.”\n\n—John P. McCormick, Professor of Political Science, University of Chicago\n\n“This is a brilliantly curated selection of texts. Many of these essays have been difficult to locate in their original form. More important, they exemplify important transitions and transformations in Schmitt’s thinking about law and politics as he confronted the challenges of the Second World War and its aftermath, in Europe and across the globe.”\n\n—David Bates, Professor, Department of Rhetoric, University of California, Berkeley"
