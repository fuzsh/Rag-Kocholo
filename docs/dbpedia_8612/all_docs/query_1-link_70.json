        "text": "The Berlin Times – At the Centre of Power\n\nSchmitt aspired to the center of power in Berlin and, after protracted negotiations, accepted a call to the Handelshochschule there for the summer semester of 1928. The critic of indirect powers wanted to complement his theoretical work with practical political activity. While in Bonn he had still met politicians with reserve, in Berlin he soon came into contact at the political level of state secretaries and senior ministerial staff, for example in the Ministry of the Interior and especially in the Ministry of Finance with Johannes Popitz, the state secretary there and later Prussian finance minister.\n\nThe latter soon became a close friend and was to persuade Schmitt to become involved in the Nazis in 1933. Among the lawyers, Rudolf Smend was closest to him at this time, joined by colleagues Bilfinger in Halle and Jacobi in Leipzig; at the Handelshochschule he had closer contact with his colleagues Werner Sombart, Moritz Julis Bonn, Götz Briefs and Herbert Dorn; he met the young Leibholz and read his habilitation thesis on the nature of representation in the flags.\n\nOn the northern edge of the Tiergarten, Schmitt found an apartment with the help of his old Munich friend, the writer Alice Berend, whose sister Charlotte and her husband Lovis Corinth were previous tenants. During this time his wife Duschka was in hospital in San Remo, where she was trying to cure her tuberculosis. As her condition worsened in the spring of 1929, Schmitt traveled there, expecting his wife to die. She was then operated on and cured several times that summer in St. Gallen.\n\nAt the Handelshochschule, as in Bonn, Schmitt had great success with his lectures, so that students from the neighboring Friedrich Wilhelm University flocked to him. On January 18, 1930, he gave his widely acclaimed speech on Hugo Preuß, the father of the Weimar Constitution, in the auditorium of the Handelshochschule for the Reich’s founding celebration. During this period he regularly attended lectures at the German School of Politics, gave some there himself, and was called upon to train the next generation of diplomats at the Foreign Office. He was soon in demand as a participant and discussant in the elite political circles of the capital, and this was especially true of the ‘Deutsche Gesellschaft 1914’.\n\nIn the political situation of the late 1920s, which was characterized by growing instability, the question of state authority arose for Schmitt. Now the concept of the ‘pouvoir neutre’ borrowed from Benjamin Constant became central for him. In view of the growing influence of interest groups and anti-democratic parties on both the left and the right, it was necessary to clarify the conditions of the possibility of state action. Schmitt’s response was to write Der Hüter der Verfassung (The Guardian of the Constitution), a continuation of his constitutional theory and a programmatic paper on the introduction of a presidential constitution. The state’s ability to act was to be regained through the plebiscitary strengthening of the position of the Reich president as a ‘pouvoir neutre’. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)\n\nThe End of the Republic\n\nThe old friends Franz Blei, Georg Eisler and Erik Peterson were now joined by Ernst Jünger and his entourage with Ernst Niekisch and Veit Rosskopf. Schmitt had contacts with publicists such as Paul Adams with the magazine Germania, Friedrich Vorwerk with the Ring, Ernst Wilhelm Eschmann and Giselher Wirsing with the Tat, Wilhelm Stapel with the Deutsches Volkstum and Prinz Rohan and Joachim Moras with the Europäische Revue, on the other hand he gave up the cooperation with the Catholic Hochland. It was typical of the atmosphere of the time that Schmitt also attended a meeting of the Arbplan (Working Group for the Study of the Planned Economy in the Soviet Union), in which, in addition to Ernst Jünger and Niekisch, Karl August Wittfogel and Georg Lukacz were present from the left.\n\nThrough Blei’s mediation he was able to read the flags of Musil’s Man Without Qualities, he gave radio lectures, saw silent films, the classic on the trial of Joan of Arc by Carl Theodor Dreyer at least ten times. In August 1931 Schmitt’s daughter Anima was born.\n\nFrom 1930 onwards, Reich Chancellor Brüning ruled without a parliamentary majority with the help of the right of emergency decree according to § 48 of the Weimar Reich Constitution. Attempts by Carl Schmitt to participate in concrete politics through contacts, for example, with Brüning, whom he knew from his time in Bonn, failed. This changed with Papen’s chancellorship. When, after the Prussian strike of July 20, 1932, the deposed government of Prussia filed a suit with the State Court in Leipzig, Schmitt was commissioned by the Reich government as one of its litigants. In the meantime, he had also become acquainted with close associates of Reichswehr Minister Schleicher, such as Erich Marcks and Eugen Ott.\n\nDuring this time of crisis, Schmitt published Legality and Legitimacy, with its core thesis that, according to the prevailing legal positivism, the substance of the constitution could be changed without asking politically about friend or foe, with the consequence that even anti-constitutional parties could not be denied access to power. The liberal legislative state presupposes that parties have a ‘legal mindset’, so that opponents have an equal chance of gaining political power. If an anti-constitutional party succeeded in coming to power legally, it could close the door of legality behind it. This would then be a ‘legal revolution’. For Schmitt, one way out of the inability of Weimar parliamentarism to form stable governments was the establishment of a presidential system with a Reich president elected by the people, who would replace the pluralistic party state, which had become quantitatively total under pressure from interest groups, and create a qualitatively total state that would seize the new technical positions of power and monopolize film and broadcasting – later Schmitt would specify that not states but only parties could be bearers of totality.\n\nAfter Schleicher’s appointment as Reich Chancellor in early December 1932, Schmitt was involved through Ott and Marcks in current state emergency plans to prevent Hitler’s rise to power, which became obsolete after his appointment as Reich Chancellor in late January 1933. In the meantime, Schmitt had accepted a call to the University of Cologne for the summer semester of 1933, thus distancing himself from the Reich capital.\n\nThe NS Period (1933-1936)\n\nSchmitt’s initial reactions to Hitler’s appointment as Reich Chancellor were restrained, saying that it was like being in the jungle, that one did not know whether he was a dove or a snake. This changed with the Enabling Act of March 23, 1933, passed by a Reichstag majority of the NSDAP, the Center, and bourgeois parties, whose revolutionary significance Schmitt immediately recognized and commented on in an article. When, on his Easter trip to Rome, he then received a telegram from his friend Johannes Popitz, the Prussian Minister of Finance, and von Papen in Munich on March 31, asking him to go to the Ministry of State in Berlin the next day to work on the Reichsstatthalter law on the Gleichschaltung of the Länder, he changed his plans and returned to Berlin. While working on the law, he met several of the regime’s greats, and Hermann Göring probably impressed him most of all. At a press reception he also saw Hitler up close for the first and only time.\n\nAt this time Schmitt moved with his family to Cologne and took up his teaching position at the university there. At the end of April he joined the NSDAP and got to know local NS activists. Now he published numerous, often polemical articles in party newspapers such as “Westdeutscher Beobachter” and “Völkischer Beobachter,” which were imbued with the spirit of the ‘new German revolution.’ In July 1933, Schmitt was appointed by Göring to the new Prussian Council of State; his hopes for greater political influence were not fulfilled. Through his close ties to the party jurist Hans Frank, Bavarian Minister of Justice and Reich Justice Commissioner, he was given influential posts in the Academy of German Law and became head of the Reich specialist group of university lecturers in the Bund Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Juristen (BNSDJ). At the Leipzig Lawyers’ Congress in the fall of 1933, Schmitt was one of the keynote speakers on the topic of the new construction of constitutional and administrative law.\n\nIn the meantime he had received calls from Heidelberg and Munich University, but followed one to a newly created chair at Berlin University, which he accepted as early as October 1 and where he gave his first lecture on November 8. Schmitt also moved from his house publishing house, Ludwig Feuchtwanger’s Duncker & Humblot, with its 1848 tradition, to the Hanseatische Verlagsanstalt Wilhelm Stapels and there, in addition to a new edition of Begriff des Politischen (1933) adapted to the times, he published in the series Der deutsche Staat der Gegenwart (1933), which he edited, his writing Staat, Bewegung, Volk (1933), with which he intended a constitutional containment of the revolutionary situation after the Enabling Act. In the one-party state, there was the ‘threefolding of political unity’ in the ‘triad of state, movement and people’, in which the movement was the ‘political-dynamic’ element between the ‘political-static’ part of the state and the ‘non-political: of the people.\n\nA ‘Führerrat’ selected by the Führer, which he saw in the Prussian State Council, ensured that professional and regional necessities were taken into account. The basis for leadership was the equality of species between leader and followers. In reality however, the emphatically proclaimed the Führer principle did not lead to a concentration of decision-making powers, but rather to a power struggle among the Nazi leadership elites, resulting in a “polycracy,” as Schmitt himself later recognized. Also in this year, he published widely circulated Five Guiding Principles for Legal Practice (1933), with which he took up the previous general clauses in order to swear in their unlimited interpretation to the basic tenets of the NS.\n\nWhen the SA leadership called for a ‘second revolution’ and a Nazi People’s Army, tensions between the state and the party increased. Since Hitler needed the military and the functional elites of the state for his plans, he had the leadership of the SA and other opponents of the regime liquidated on June 30, 1934. The law on measures of state self-defense, passed on July 3, declared the assassination action to be lawful. Schmitt commented on it in the next issue of the Deutsche Juristen-Zeitung with the article Der Führer schützt das Recht. Schmitt justified the murders of the SA leaders by presenting Hitler as the highest source of law, who had created immediate law at the moment of danger, but at the same time there was no legalization of special actions to settle old scores, which had to be punished severely, referring to the murders of Schleicher, Edgar Julius Jung and others, with whom Schmitt had collaborated. Abroad, reactions were fierce, and internally, Schmitt’s opponents took advantage to undermine his prominent position. Remarkable was the reaction of Schmitt’s friend Ernst Jünger, who had already warned him against illusions about the influence of Goering’s Staatsrat by referring to Napoleon’s unimportant Staatsrat and now asked the ironic question whether he had installed a machine gun in the basement window of his house. Schmitt began to focus more on programmatic and organizational issues, less on constitutionally constraining ones, which he now considered obsolete. Between his lectures, lecture tours, and the expansion of his position of power in the Academy for German Law and as a scientific advisor in the Institute for International Law of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, he sought recreation in the Sauerland region, as he had done in the 1920s. His lectures and essays now revolved around the concept of the rule of law, which he contrasted with the NS state of justice, which was an ‘immediate just state’, and around topics such as National Socialism and international law.\n\nDuring this period, he became particularly close politically and privately to Reich Justice Commissioner Frank, whose influence in the Nazi hierarchy was, however, limited. Towards the end of 1934, Schmitt suffered his first defeat when, as head of the BNSDJ-Reichsfachgruppe Hochschullehrer (BNSDJ-Reichspecialized Group of University Teachers), he drafted proposals for a study regulation with colleagues at the conference he organized, which the speaker present, Schmitt’s former colleague Karl August Eckhardt, rejected on the part of the Reich Ministry for Science, Education and National Education. The fact that doubts about Schmitt’s loyalty to the Nazi regime were growing was not only due to the so-called Old Fighters, who distrusted the ‘March Fighter’ from the beginning, but increasingly to opponents in the SS. This became apparent in January 1935, when General von Fritsch, chief of the army command, had invited Schmitt to a lecture to officers on the legality of a coup d’état at the Reich Ministry of the Armed Forces. Himmler had then insinuated to Fritsch, who did not know Schmitt personally, that he intended to stage a coup; Goering believed this and Schmitt was disinvited on the day of the lecture; Himmler spoke instead.\n\nOn the occasion of the Nuremberg Party Congress in September 1935, at which the so-called race laws discriminating against Jews were passed, Schmitt wrote the article Die Verfassung der Freiheit (The Constitution of Freedom) in the Deutsche Juristen-Zeitung, in which he justified the government’s racial policy, which he presented as a compromise between the radical demands of the party and the stalling resistance of the ministerial bureaucracy in defining “Jew.” At the meeting of the International Law Association at the end of November, Schmitt spoke on the subject of Nazi legislation and the reservation of public order, in which he used the example of marriage law to discuss consequences for private international law through the application of the racial legislation that had just been passed. At the beginning of the year, the organization of the 1936 Lawyers’ Day led to a confrontation and break with Eckhardt and the SD department head Reinhard Höhn, who had Schmitt spied on by his assistant Herbert Gutjahr.\n\nIn the meantime, the SS had gained considerable influence over the younger faculty as ‘neo-Germanic Führer offspring’ and had labelled Schmitt an unreliable careerist. When Frank travelled to Rome in April, Schmitt also went with him to Italy and gave lectures on basic features of the Nazi state in Milan and Rome. There he was received in a private audience by Benito Mussolini, a symbolic high point in his career near power. Then, in May, the second major Nazi Lawyers Day was held in Leipzig, with some Nazi celebrities such as Goebbels, Gürtner, and Hess; here Schmitt, as organizer, no longer gave a major lecture. His position of power as Reichsfachgruppenleiter was so weakened that he had to fight for his political survival over the next six months. His often brusque demeanor during this time alienated even close confidants. When, on the occasion of the Nuremberg Party Congress in September 1936, the staff of the Fuehrer’s deputy considered replacing Justice Minister Gürtner with Frank, with the possibility that Schmitt could then become State Secretary, the SS began to plan the overthrow of Schmitt, who by now openly described the SS as his ideological opponent.\n\nAs head of the scientific department of the National Socialist Legal Preservation League, successor to the BNSDJ, Schmitt convened the conference Das Judentum in der Rechtswissenschaft (Judaism in Law) on October 4 and 5, 1936. He was even prepared to invite the notorious Gauleiter Julius Streicher, who, however, after a tip-off from the SD, stayed away, as did Schmitt’s patron Frank, and even colleagues and students who were close friends of Schmitt, such as Forsthoff, E. R. Huber, W. Weber, Oberheid, Johannes Heckel and others, cancelled their participation. The official goal of the conference, to examine the influences of Judaism on German jurisprudence and economics, had as a hidden objective to counter the racial anti-Semitism, especially of the SS, with Christian anti-Jewish motives. In order to balance this tendency, Schmitt had enlisted the prominent ‘racial hygienist’ and SS-Hauptsturmführer Falk Ruttke as a lecturer, but in his paper Ruttke clearly distinguished himself from the organizer of the conference, so that Schmitt had to refer to him in the closing remarks. When it became clear to him with what intensity the SS had begun to pursue his downfall, he decided not to retreat but to cooperate with the arch-enemy. In early December, Schmitt, invoking an understanding with Frank, sent to Himmler the just-completed booklets of the series Das Judentum in der Rechtswissenschaft. But the submission came too late. On December 3, an attack on Schmitt appeared in the SS organ “Das Schwarze Korps” under the title “Eine peinliche Ehrenrettung” (An embarrassing vindication of Schmitt’s honour) by the editor-in-chief Gunter d’Alquen; on December 10, a second “It gets even more embarrassing” appeared with a floral reading of captious Schmitt statements, which were based on the “German Letters” of the Swiss émigré and former Schmitt student Waldemar Gurian, on hostile competing colleagues such as the constitutional lawyer Koellreutter, and on SD inmates. Schmitt recognized the dangerous situation created by the articles and contacted Göring and Frank. While the latter dropped Schmitt and stripped him of all offices in the NSRB, the Academy and the editorship of the DJZ for ‘health reasons’, Göring stood up to Himmler and Heydrich and saved ‘his’ Staatsrat from the grasp of the SS. The university rector had also urged Schmitt to cancel his lectures, but this did not happen; on the contrary, an SD informer reported an emphatically enthusiastic welcome on the part of the students at the beginning of Schmitt’s lectures. He retained his chair until 1945.\n\nSchmitt’s career in the Nazi functional elite was over by 1936. His rise had been associated with the loss of close friends such as Georg Eisler, Ludwig Feuchtwanger, Franz Blei, Erwin Jacobi, Erik Peterson and others, and now even closer colleagues such as Ernst Rudolf Huber and Johannes Heckel were distancing themselves.\n\nAfter his disempowerment, Schmitt, a lawyer, focused his work on current developments in international law. For example, Die Wendung zum discriminierenden Kriegsbegriffs (1937), a survey of recent publications in foreign international law literature, was published. In it, Schmitt noted an end to the possibility of neutrality on the part of Anglo-Saxon and French international law jurists. Through the universal expansion of modern ideologies of justice, wars could now be waged in the name of morality and justice. These ‘just’ wars transformed the enemy into a criminal and turned the law of war into criminal law; they did not tolerate neutrality. Another opportunity for Schmitt to reappear in the public eye came from the so-called Anschluss of Austria to the German Reich and the Munich Agreement on the occasion of the Sudeten crisis. With the geopolitical term ‘Großraum’ and the reference to the American Monroe Doctrine, he was able to influence Nazi European policy, to the annoyance of the SD, which continued to observe him.\n\nHe had already presented his ‘concrete order community of nations’ in 1938 in one of his most extensive reviews of the voluminous work Das Reich und die Krankheit der europäischen Kultur (The Reich and the Disease of European Culture) by the recently deceased historian Christoph Steding. In his Kiel lecture Der Reichsbegriff im Völkerrecht (The Concept of Empire in International Law) of April 1939, Schmitt attempted to clarify Steding’s concept of empire from the perspective of international law by defining ’empires’ as leading powers whose political idea radiated into a certain large area and for which interventions by foreign powers were to be excluded. The world could be divided into different areas with mutual respect for a ban on intervention. In this context, the German Reich claimed the Central and Eastern European area as a ‘service area’ for itself. The elaborated lecture appeared in the same year with the title Völkerrechtliche Großraumordnung mit Interventionsverbot für raumfremde Mächte (1939) in the Deutscher Rechtsverlag. The response was considerable; above all, the SS felt challenged again and criticised the lack of a biological and racist foundation; instead of international law, it should be called ‘völkische’ Großraumordnung.\n\nAfter the beginning of the war, Schmitt himself problematized the concept of the Reich he used as a new concept of order under international law in new editions by including additional chapters and referred to the 1939 edition as a document. In the 3rd edition in 1941, he removed the passages incriminated by the SS lawyers Best and Höhn. At the same time, he continued to disseminate his Großraum ideas in numerous lectures, but then, as his distance from the Nazi regime grew, he turned more to the history of jurisprudence, beginning with his concise text on Die Stellung Lorenz von Stein in der Gesetzgebung des 19. Jahrhunderts and the major essay Die Formung des französischen Geistes durch den Legisten. At the Nuremberg Historians Conference in February 1941, he addressed his changed understanding of the state with the lecture Staatliche Souveränität und freies Meer. In it, he described the struggle for the reorganization of overseas discoveries since the 16th century and the related fronts of world Catholicism and world Protestantism, as well as the formation of the concepts of “state” and “sovereignty.” These reflections were continued by him in numerous articles especially on the concept of “space revolution” and finally resulted in his last book in the Third Reich Land and Sea. Eine weltgeschichtliche Betrachtung (1942). From the “spatial basic facts” the “Christian-European international law of the last three centuries, the jus publicum europaeum, would have developed”, whose downfall we were currently experiencing.\n\nSchmitt felt lost and saw himself mirrored in the novella Benito Cereno by Melville. In it, the Spaniard Benito Cereno, captain of a ship off the Chilean coast, unable to maneuver, is visited with a cargo of slaves by Delano, captain of an American sealer. Delano notices the strangeness of the situation, but does not see through it until he is about to return to his ship. At the last moment, Benito Cereno jumps into Delano’s dinghy to escape the mutinous slaves and their leader Babo, whose slogan was “Follow your leader.” Ernst Jünger shared with Schmitt a penchant for symbolic form, there in Marble Cliffs, for instance, here in Leviathan. The friendship between the two, which included their families, grew closer during these years. In October 1941, at the invitation of the German Institute, Schmitt visited Paris, lectured, met Jünger, and also spoke with Friedrich Sieburg, Montherlant, and again with Drieu la Rochelle. In the next two years, Schmitt traveled to give lectures in friendly foreign countries.\n\nIn April, Schmitt drew his salary as a professor for the last time, having been on leave in February. Since savings were almost non-existent, the family hung in the air. During the year, they had to sell some of the household goods. Later, Duschka also sublet rooms from the apartment in the house, which was already occupied by refugees. In order to be able to obtain ration cards, which were essential for survival, Schmitt registered as a “scientist,” so that on May 18 he received the heavy workers ration card from the Russian administration, while his wife was only entitled to the 5th class card for housewives and former Nazis; later, in the U.S. zone, Schmitt received a Group 3 card. In the summer, when he had completed the expert opinion on international law for the imprisoned industrialist Flick, the family was able to live off the fee for a while. During this time, their daughter Anima continued to be in Cloppenburg, living with a Wesseling family and attending the local high school with her two cousins.\n\nIn his diary, during the spring and summer, Schmitt ruminated on the total defeat with the most severe devastation on German soil since the Thirty Years War, on the causes of Hitler’s power over the German people, and on his own participation in the Nazi regime. He continued the excerpts and preliminary studies he had already compiled in the last two years of the war for his major work Der Nomos der Erde im Völkerrecht des Jus publicum Europaeum (The Nomos of the Earth in International Law of the Jus publicum Europaeum) and worked on the above-mentioned expert opinion Das internationalsrechtliche Verbrechen des Angriffskrieges und der Grundsatz ‘Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege’ (The International Law Crime of War of Aggression and the Principle ‘Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege’), which was intended to protect the industrialist and businessman Flick against prosecution and conviction for participation in the crime of war of aggression. In the expert opinion, Carl Schmitt also made clear his view of the Nazi crimes, according to which those who had placed themselves outside the law as perpetrators for the planned killings and atrocities that exceeded human comprehension had become outlaws and should be punished accordingly.\n\nIn July 1945, American troops arrived in Berlin, which was divided into four occupation zones. The district of Zehlendorf-Nikolassee was now under the U.S. military government. In the early years, the Americans pursued a different policy toward the defeated country than the Soviet Russians. They tended toward collective moral condemnation and organized denazification first in extensive internments, divided into three groups: the actual war criminals, tried at the Nuremberg trial, persons whom the occupying power feared would endanger its troops, and finally the largest group, taken into “automatic arrest.” This group comprised almost the entire functional elite of the Reich, all of whom were assumed to have been National Socialists. The assessment of emigrants, many of whom returned as members of the U.S. Army, had a strong influence. These included people Schmitt knew personally, such as Karl Löwenstein, Ossip K. Flechtheim, Robert Kempner, and others.\n\nWhen Schmitt was arrested on September 26, 1945, it was at the intense urging of Löwenstein, who also had Schmitt’s private library confiscated on October 16. Schmitt had made it available to the public for scholarly use at the beginning of June on the basis of an agreement with the Zehlendorf cultural commissioner Erich F. Podach. He was first interned at the U.S. Interrogation Center Berlin-Wannsee, then at Camp Lichterfelde, where he filled out an extensive questionnaire in February, which he combined with a request for release. The Spruchkammer proceedings convened as a result, with German lay judges, unanimously proposed Schmitt’s dismissal, also on the basis of statements by respected persons in favour of Schmitt. At first, the American authorities did not agree. It was not until October 10, 1946, that he was released from the Interrogation Center in Wannsee, without conviction or acquittal, just as there had been no formal arrest document to begin with. In retrospect, it is clear from the documents that there had been no justiciable reasons for the internment, nor for the sequestration of Schmitt’s private library, which, after some interim storage, had been set up for use in the legal department of the U.S. military government since early 1946. However, it was clear to those responsible that the sequestration did not affect the title of ownership, which is why all of the approximately 4,000 books received corresponding stamp imprints for later return.\n\nSchmitt survived the internment thanks to the constant help of his wife Duschka, who provided him with food and warm clothing, donated by relatives and friends. The life-impractical scholar also found help in coping with everyday life in the camp in two fellow prisoners, Ministerialrat Wever and the last rector of Berlin University, orthopedist Lothar Kreuz. Here, too, Schmitt kept a diary despite being forbidden to write, because an American doctor gave him prescription pads in DIN A 7 format, on which Schmitt recorded his observations, his renewed turn to the Catholic faith, and laments about his fate, which later formed the basis for his book Ex captivitate Salus. The Catholic camp chaplain smuggled texts outside, as well as Schmitt’s letters to his wife.\n\nFreedom did not last half a year for Schmitt. On March 19, 1947, he was arrested again by the American secret service (CIC). The reasons for this are unclear, but presumably Löwenstein and Ernst Niekisch played a role here. After interrogations by Ossip K. Flechtheim, the authorities transferred him to the prison of the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg on March 29. His wife Duschka now feared that her husband would be indicted and sentenced to a long prison term. The interrogations by the prosecutor, Robert W. Kempner, however, were more moral reproaches than preparations for a justiciable indictment. After Schmitt, at Kempner’s request, had written expert reports on Hitler’s Greater Region policy and the internal power structure of the Nazi government, he was able to leave Nuremberg and arrived in Plettenberg as a free man on May 21.\n\nIn Plettenberg, as earlier in Berlin, Schmitt soon had contacts with artists in the surrounding area. These included the painter Wilhelm Wessel in Iserlohn, the artist and educator Hugo Kükelhaus in Soest, the painter Hubert Berke in the Rhineland and his close friend, the sculptor Heinrich Holthaus in Plettenberg. During the war, he had worked with Gilles, Heldt and Kaspar in the Klosterstraße studio community in Berlin, modeling a portrait head of Anima. At chamber music evenings, Schmitt’s sister Ännchen played the piano and the doctor Hendryk Bakowsky accompanied his wife Anne, a well-known pianist, on the cello. Schmitt also took part in the city’s cultural life, especially when guests he knew from his Berlin days appeared, such as the actor Mathias Wiemann or the tenor Peter Anders, who died in an accident after an evening at Brockhauser Weg.\n\nIn the 1950s, Carl Schmitt had written a legal opinion on the problem of the compatibility of the rule of law and socialization, had brought about the new edition of his famous constitutional doctrine in the house publisher Duncker & Humblot, and had published older essays with topical glosses commenting on the development of the Federal Republic in the Verfassungsrechtlichen Aufsätze (Essays on Constitutional Law), but he now turned more to topics of historical philosophy, literature, and contemporary diagnosis. In addition to numerous smaller reviews in the journal Das historisch-politische Buch and so-called corollaries on the subject of Nomos, he wrote several larger contributions on the interpretation of time. In the essay Drei Möglichkeiten eines christlichen Geschichtsbildes (1950) in the journal Universitas, Schmitt dealt with Karl Löwith’s publications on the modern philosophy of history and described his own position on the basis of the Christian teleology of the ‘catechon’ and the ‘great parallel’, which led to a view of history oriented to Konrad Weiß. In the article Die Einheit der Welt (1952) in Merkur, Schmitt showed that for him the two blocs in the Cold War stood in the ideological unity of a philosophy of history of the technical-industrial world of progress. Against their convergence in a planetary unity of pure technicity, he bet on a passage to a new multiplicity. He continued this view in his contribution to a Festschrift for Ernst Jünger Die geschichtliche Struktur des heutigen Weltgegensatzes von Ost und West. Remarks on Ernst Jünger’s writing Der gordische Knoten (1955). In it, he distanced himself from Jünger’s thinking in polarities and, on the other hand, developed a historical-dialectical structure from the opposition of land and sea, which led to elementarily different possibilities of existence of man; however, he renounced an answer to “the question after the question” in view of mere repetitions of historical-philosophical sense-making, because a historical truth was true only once.\n\nAs a media enthusiast, Schmitt had watched film screenings early on and lectured on radio from the early 1930s; now, in exile in Sauerland, he kept close track of the response to his publications and compiled lists of the books, offprints, or press releases he sent out. This applied, for example, to the independent writings such as the doctrinal talk on Die Macht und den Zugang zum Machthaber (1954). In it he discussed the dialectic of power and powerlessness of the powerful through his dependence on the ‘indirect’, the forecourt of power populated with background figures. In 1956 there was an excursion into literature and literary criticism through Shakespeare’s Hamlet in Hamlet or Hecuba. The Intrusion of Time into the Play. In Schmitt’s controversial interpretation of the stage play as a political work, he linked Hamlet to the then King James as a tragic figure whose mother married the patricide, which everyone knew but was not allowed to say. This intrusion of the time of a historical present into the play would be the origin of the mythical power of this drama, which had an effect until the 20th century. Already during the war Schmitt had discovered the mythical figure important for him in Hermann Melville’s novella of the same name Benito Cereno. His fascination with these figures involved in hopeless situations, lost posts, and unexplained frauds continued in the Münster Anabaptist Bockelson, the Prussian poet Heinrich von Kleist, or in Kaspar Hauser and the false Demetrius. What then culminated in Schmitt’s self-image as a Christian Epimetheus in the sense of his poet friend Konrad Weiß, who accepts what has been imposed on him and does not want to think again what has been thought, since one cannot go through the same river twice. Finally, this also includes Léon Bloy’s recurring phrase “tout ce qui arrive est adorable”.\n\nOne of his most influential writings, The Concept of the Political, had not been reprinted since the 1930s. Particularly at the urging of Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde, Schmitt decided in 1963 to reissue it with some corollaries and an extensive preface on constitutional history that also took into account the history of interpretation. Parallel to this writing, he published The Theory of the Partisan. Intermediate remark on the concept of the political. In the world civil war he diagnosed, the classical law of war with its distinction between combatants and non-combatants had ceased to exist. New actors appeared, such as the partisan, who on the one hand was tellurically bound to the ground to be defended and to interested third parties for support, and on the other hand, in the anti-colonialist movement, no longer conformed to the dualistic structure of the Cold War and thus acted in the world political context. At the same time, Schmitt discussed the changes in the concept of the enemy, which had to lead to a new concept of the enemy due to the great destruction potential of modern weapons: the absolute means of destruction required the absolute enemy to be applied."
