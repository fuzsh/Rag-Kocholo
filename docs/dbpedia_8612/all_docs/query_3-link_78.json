        "text": "[The] study has identified a serious problem in contemporary Chinese political thought and brings this deep undercurrent to light in an important volume of work in English.\n\n— Journal of Chinese Political Science\n\n[M]y overall impression of the book is positive. All in all, it provides a thoughtful response to a pressing issue that demands attention. I believe that it will serve not only as a reference for specialists in modern Chinese thought, but also as a guide for nonspecialists concerned about the issue. . . . The unique contribution of the book is to provide us an opportunity to reflect on our own position and situation.We may progressively develop a deeper understanding of ourselves when we begin to become more aware of our own beliefs, biases, and values. Only then can we build a stronger intellect to get rid of any fever in the future.\n\n— Dao: A Journal of Comparative Philosophy\n\nThis rich volume sparkles with insight as a dozen scholars describe and debate the appropriation of Schmitt and Strauss in the contemporary Sinophone world. Anyone seeking to understand and then engage with Chinese criticism of liberalism and skepticism of Western modernity should start here.\n\n— Stephen C. Angle, Professor of Philosophy and East Asian Studies, Wesleyan University\n\nCarl Schmitt and Leo Strauss in the Chinese-Speaking World does much more than contribute to the developing literature on cross-cultural political theory. By approaching Schmitt and Strauss from (a) Chinese perspective(s), the authors give us a much more complex understanding of these scholars. They show that the contemporary Chinese appropriation of Schmitt and Strauss leads not to a misunderstanding of those thinkers but to ‘a creative appropriation of foreign ideas for the sake of a new articulation of Chinese cultural and political identity.’ Thus this volume not only deepens our understanding of these two important anti-liberal thinkers but gives us a much more complex picture of the meaning of modernity as it has developed over the last 120 years and not only in China. Necessary reading not only for Schmitt and Strauss but for all interested in China and the meanings of modernity.\n\n— Tracy Strong, University of Southampton and UCSD Distinguished Professor, emeritus\n\nCalls to globalize political thought are rife, but few publications offer a concrete or sustained consideration of the specific issues driving truly global thinking about politics. This volume is a notable and brilliant exception. Its nuanced and comprehensive examination of how Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss are being interpreted in the Chinese-speaking world today draws on the expertise of a range of scholars from all over the world to think critically about the meaning and promise of this exchange. This volume promises to define the terms of such research for years to come.\n\n— Leigh Jenco, London School of Economics and Political Science\n\nThis volume represents comparative political theory at its very best. It will be essential reading not only for those interested in contemporary Chinese thought but also for scholars and students everywhere grappling with the ideas of Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss.\n\n— Mark Lilla, Professor of Humanities, Columbia University"
