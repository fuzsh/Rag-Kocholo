But when I changed the features to Open link, the button was no more on the cell’s screen.\n\nSorry English is not easy for me.\n\nIt might be the Row Owner issue again. The link I am trying to display is a template (start URL + rowID - to make a chat room on the fly). I see the data in the Data Editor… but is it Row Owners that is not letting me show it in the component?\n\nI start the process by clicking on the Ready to Start button (Show Form - opens the CollectTest sheet)\n\nthen I am in the form… but the row is empty - even if I am setting values like email, etc. The button will even save… but then I do not get the email in for whatever weird reason.\n\nI am in a crunch this week with a system to deliver (mostly) by Friday - happy to engage more properly to get the help to complete. @Darren_Murphy has been stellar with components of the system, but each good bit then opens up the chance for the next bit to go wrong!"
