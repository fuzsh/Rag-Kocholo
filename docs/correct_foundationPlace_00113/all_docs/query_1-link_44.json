        "text": "Defining dynamic hyperlinks through Identify results\n\nYou can dynamically add a hyperlink to a feature using the Identify tool . With dynamic hyperlinks, you do not use an attribute field to supply the hyperlink targets. The hyperlink target you specify is associated with the identified feature. This association is stored with your layer. They are also stored with your layer if you save the layer to a file.\n\nClick the Identify tool on the Tools toolbar.\n\nClick the feature for which you want to define a hyperlink.\n\nRight-click the feature in the Identify window and click Add Hyperlink.\n\nSpecify the desired hyperlink target.\n\nYou can specify any number of dynamic hyperlinks for any feature. All the dynamic hyperlinks defined for a feature are listed in the Hyperlinks pull-right list in the identify results context menu (steps 1–3 above). Also available from this menu is Manage Hyperlinks. Here, you can add and remove dynamic hyperlinks for this feature. This list does not include field-based hyperlinks, and the commands available have no effect on field-based hyperlinks.\n\nManaging hyperlink paths\n\nAs part of a map's properties, you can specify a hyperlink base, which is the base path, or URL, used for field-based hyperlinks to documents or URLs. For example, if the hyperlink base is set to D:\\Data, then the values in the field or fields used as hyperlinks to documents don't have to contain D:\\Data. They can just contain the name of the file. Using this property makes it easier to manage hyperlinks because if the location of the targets change, you can simply edit this one setting instead of having to edit each value of the field providing the hyperlink targets.\n\nThe Hyperlink Base property is specified on the Map Document Properties dialog box. Click File > Map Document Properties to open. There is one Hyperlink Base property for the map document. This setting has no effect if you specify that the target values are to be sent to a macro. Also, this setting has no effect on dynamic hyperlinks.\n\nYou can override this default so that no slash is automatically added. You can find this setting by launching the Advanced ArcMap Settings utility (<install drive>:\\Program Files\\ArcGIS\\Desktop10.2.1\\Utilities) and looking in the Miscellaneous tab. Overriding the default makes it easier to work with long paths and URLs.\n\nFor example, if you want to use the hyperlink base setting with long URLs such as this one—http://www.example.com/index.cfm?parameter=1234—you have to specify http://www.example.com as the base and store everything that comes after that—index.cfm?parameter=1234—in the hyperlink field. But, by overriding the default, you can specify most of the URL as the base— http://www.example.com/index.cfm?parameter=—and just store the last part of the URL, 1234, in the hyperlink field.\n\nIf you override the default, ArcMap will still retain the slash if the hyperlink base specified in Map Document Properties ends in a slash character. So, if you override the default, you can still add a slash manually to the hyperlink base. The setting to override the default only applies to your machine and is not stored as a property in the map document you are working with.\n\nMaking hyperlinks with relative paths\n\nSometimes, you may want to give a map that contains hyperlinks to someone who does not have access to your network resources. Just as you can save the map with relative paths to the data, you can also specify hyperlinks that refer to a location relative to the map.\n\nTo specify a path to a document in the same folder, type the document's name. For the example below, you would type directions.bmp (that is, do not include a \\ or drive letter prefix).\n\nTo specify a path through a folder immediately below the map's location in the file system, start the path with the folder name (again, no \\ or drive letter prefix). For the example below, you would type Graphics\\directions.bmp.\n\nUsing parameters to control how a program opens a hyperlinked document\n\nHyperlinks to documents can contain parameters that define how the program opens the document. For example, parameters can tell Adobe Reader to open a PDF to a specific page, allowing map features to hyperlink to different pages in the same document. Since each software package (such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Adobe Reader, and so on) has unique commands, consult the documentation for the software package used to open the document for the parameters and syntax available to it.\n\nMany times, these parameters will be provided for use in a command line. For example, to open a .PDF document to page 5, the command line might look like the following:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Reader 8.0\\Reader\\AcroRd32.exe /A Page=5=OpenActions c:\\temp\\PopulationData.pdf\n\nwhere\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Reader 8.0\\Reader\\AcroRd32.exe is the location of the software; /A Page=5=OpenActions is the open parameter; and c:\\temp\\PopulationData.pdf is the location of the file.\n\nArcGIS does not read these parameters like a command line. Instead, it uses a special delimiter, a ? (question mark), to separate the file path from the parameter. The hyperlink to the same document and page in ArcGIS would look like this:\n\nc:\\temp\\PopulationData.pdf ?/A Page=5=OpenActions\n\nThe ? serves as the delimiter between the path and the parameter."
