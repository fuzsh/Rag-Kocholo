        "text": "UNIONDALE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Openlink, the global leader in trading, treasury and risk management solutions for the energy, commodities, corporate and financial services industries, has announced that Rich Grossi has been promoted to CEO. John O’Malley has transitioned to the role of Executive Chairman of the Board, where he will continue to support the strategic direction of Openlink Financial.\n\nFor the past two years, John O’Malley has been at the helm of the growing trading, treasury and risk management company. He has established a strong strategic foundation for growth and has brought in a stellar leadership team with a renewed focus on client-led development. Today’s leadership change has been engineered to enable John to continue to support the strategic growth of the business in partnership with a strong and dynamic CEO.\n\nRich Grossi takes on the CEO position with nearly 20 years of operational and technological experience at Openlink. As CTO, Rich oversaw the development of Openlink’s products and technology as well as management of the company’s IT and information security. He has also played an instrumental role in the development of Openlink Cloud and has been guiding its subsequent growth.\n\nPreviously, Rich spent nearly a decade directing Openlink’s global operations, where he helped enhance the company’s sales and management processes to foster explosive growth. Throughout his lengthy tenure, Rich has worked closely and collaboratively with Openlink’s sales, services, systems, finance and product teams to ensure a consistent and high-quality level of delivery across the enterprise.\n\nJohn O’Malley commented: “I have been proud to lead Openlink through a period of extensive technological and operational evolution. My aim as CEO was to develop a dynamic executive team, product suite and operational strategy to ensure that clients can continue to rely on Openlink to help them navigate challenging markets, capitalize on unseen value and mitigate systemic risk. With our new Cloud platform and strong, experienced executives like Rich at the helm, I believe we are in the best position possible to serve clients and assert our leadership across all areas of risk management. Rich has played a central role in bringing this vision to life. There is no one better placed to take on the role and I anticipate that our collaborative efforts will grow even stronger in our new capacities.”\n\nRich Grossi commented: “In nearly two decades with Openlink, I’ve watched the firm continuously adapt to any and all industry change to maintain its mission of helping clients translate risk into opportunity. From leading global operations to shaping our technology strategy, I have been proud to help drive that growth in a variety of areas. As CEO, I plan on leveraging this intimate knowledge and collaboration with all of our business units to continue John’s vision and lead Openlink into its next phase of growth.”\n\nPrior to joining Openlink, Rich was a VP of Development at KWI, where he was responsible for technical management of internal software applications.\n\nIn concert with this leadership change, today also marks the launch of Openlink’s new global brand, positioning and website. John added: “Our new brand better showcases Openlink as the dynamic, modern company that we have evolved to be, and is a testament to our continuing investments in service, innovation and growth. Our new representation conveys the value our clients have come to expect and value in our partnership together: a comprehensive platform that provides a single source of the truth, our expertise in risk, our role as a solution innovator for complex business.”\n\nAbout Openlink\n\nFor more than 25 years, Openlink (www.Openlink.com) has been providing trading, treasury and risk management solutions for the world’s most sophisticated commodity, energy, corporate and financial services organizations.\n\nOpenlink’s innovative solutions help clients break down organizational silos and instantaneously connects trading, risk and treasury across multiple asset classes and throughout the front, middle and back office.
