Publishing procedures are built around fully open peer review and continuous publication, publishing research online as soon as the article is ready.\n\nBMJ Open aims to promote transparency in the publication process by publishing reviewer reports and previous versions of manuscripts as pre-publication histories. Authors are asked to pay article-publishing charges on acceptance; the ability to pay does not influence editorial decisions.\n\nAll papers are included in MEDLINE/PubMed and Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science).\n\nBMJ Open accepts submissions on a range of article types, including original research, cohort profiles and protocols.\n\nThe Author Information section provides specific article requirements to help you turn your research into an article suitable for BMJ Open.\n\nInformation is also provided on editorial policies and open access."
