Now I use Perspective Menu Tree, so now it works without any Gateway scripts.\n\nBut now I have the other problem: I cant open url in new tab via script system.perspective.navigate(url=‘link’)…\n\nI searched for the information about it on the forum and I found that it’s impossible\n\nI need to open new link in new window, because IFrame can’t show me GoogleMap\n\nI am lost…\n\nAll the examples given were examples for Vision, not perspective. Perspective scripts run on the gateway, so you can't launch other applications there.\n\nIn HTML, it would be as simple as adding a target to a link, but I don't know perspective well enough to know how you should achieve this in perspective.\n\n@Sanderd17 ‘s response made me take a step back and re-read the original post. I apologize for potentially leading you down the wrong path.\n\nIf you are using the Perspective Menu Tree, there is a “target” property in each of your items. You may place an external url there and it should open in a new tab\n\nOtherwise, you might look into placing the Link Component on a page for navigation.\n\nI would be interested in knowing whether this solves your problem or if you still need some way to do this via scripting.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nhey,\n\nCan You give me one advise about how to check if I pressed “BACK” in menu tree?\n\nI thought I can get a path for that with value “0”, but it gives no path if I press “BACK”…\n\nso… how to know if I pressed back?"
