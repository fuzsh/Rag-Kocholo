        "text": "Created and published by OpenLink Software, Virtuoso is a platform that provides secure and high-performance data access, integration, virtualization, and management. It provides a powerful platform for developing and deploying contemporary systems-of-intelligence using existing systems-record and systems-of-engagement.\n\nTarget audiences\n\nAI-based Smart Agent Developers\n\nThe platform's support for a wide range of data access and connectivity protocols provides a robust and efficient foundation for developing modern Smart Agent (or Personal Assistant) solutions. Specifically, it enables loose coupling of solutions with databases and knowledge bases (or knowledge graphs) which is crucial to any hallucinations minimization strategy.\n\nApplication Developers\n\nIt provides an open standards compliant platform for developing and deploying database independent solutions leveraging HTTP, ODBC, JDBC, and ADO.NET as data access protocols. In addition, it also fosters privacy-by-design as intrinsic solution functionality by loosely-coupling identity, identification, authentication, authorization, and storage.\n\nSystems Integrators\n\nIt provides a powerful platform for Low-Code and No-Code data integration that leverage hyperlinks as powerful super-keys for heterogenous data access and integration via semantically rich knowledge graphs.\n\nKnowledge and Power Users\n\nIt enables reuse of existing applications and services for secure and transparent access to disparate data sources via open standards-based protocols such as HTTP, ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET, and OLE-DB -- using industry standard query languages such as SQL and/or SPARQL.\n\nUsage\n\nFollowing virtual machine instantiation, simply SSH into your Linux shell to interact with your Virtuoso Server instance using its command-line Interactive SQL Query tool or HTML based Administration interface on HTTP port 8890 (via the URL-pattern: https://{your-virtual-machine-dns-name-or-ip-address}:8890/conductor)."
