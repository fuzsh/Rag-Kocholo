        "text": "The UK faces major challenges – climate change, inequality, ill health. All of these problems can seem overwhelming. But we believe it's possible to meet these challenges through innovation. That's the creation of new and better solutions. We believe that through new products, new services, new business models, and new policies, meaningful change is possible.\n\nWe are Nesta, the UK's innovation agency for social good. We design new solutions, test them rigorously, and help them to spread nationwide. How? By bringing our teams of designers, data scientists, and behavioural scientists to work with partners across the public and private sector, from local authorities and nurseries to supermarkets and energy companies, by harnessing the power of the arts to understand social problems and design solutions, by building new companies from scratch and investing in early-stage ones, by looking at what gets in the way of innovation and unblocking it.\n\nWe push the boundaries of what's possible. We are on a mission to reduce education inequality in early childhood, ensuring all babies and toddlers have a fairer start in life, an equal chance to thrive. We are on a mission to make healthy eating easier and more accessible in schools, high streets, workplaces, and online, helping more people live a healthy life for longer.\n\nWe are on a mission to reduce global warming by redesigning the UK's energy systems to reduce harmful pollution from households. We envision a sustainable future, where people can heat their homes more efficiently, cheaply, and easily. Our vision is a better life for millions of people. We are on a journey to that different and brighter future. We are Nesta. Join us on that journey."
