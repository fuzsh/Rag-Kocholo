        "text": "Although a formal query language, SPARQL, is available for accessing DBpedia, it remains challenging for users to query the knowledge unless they are familiar with the syntax of SPARQL and the underlying ontology. We have developed both an intuitive semantic graph notation or interface allowing one to pose a query by annotating a graph with natural language terms denoting entities and relations and a system that automatically translates the query into SPARQL to produce an answer.\n\nIndividuals living in highly networked societies publish a large amount of personal, and potentially sensitive, information online. Web investigators can exploit such information for a variety of purposes, such as in background vetting and fraud detection. However, such investigations require a large number of expensive man hours and human effort. This paper describes InfoScout, a search tool which is intended to reduce the time it takes to identify and gather subject centric information on the Web. InfoScout collects relevance feedback information from the investigator in order to re-rank search results, allowing the intended information to be discovered more quickly. Users may still direct their search as they see fit, issuing ad-hoc queries and filtering existing results by keywords. Design choices are informed by prior work and industry collaboration.\n\nThe evolution of information retrieval technology on the web has led to the idea of semantic search engine in which it understands the meaning and the context of the search query. As a consequence, the search results returned by this type of search engine should match closely with the query. However, the Web is still dominated by Web 2.0 in which information and data is presented in an unstructured manner and is only fit for human consumption. Hence, building a semantic search engine is a very challenging task and there is still a lot of improvement that needs to be done to achieve the desirable results. As an example, if we search for “food that is not halal”, existing semantic search engines still ignore the term of “not” resulting in inaccurate search. In view of this problem, this paper proposes a semantic meta search engine that utilizes the power of a traditional search engine (Google) and enriches the search result using DBpedia as the knowledge base to produce better results. This paper also describes the application of the knowledge base contained in DBpedia to deliver an improved search engine.\n\nThere are many opportunities to improve the interactivity of information retrieval systems beyond the ubiquitous search box. One idea is to use knowledge bases—e.g. controlled vocabularies, classification schemes, thesauri and ontologies—to organize, describe and navigate the information space. These resources are popular in libraries and specialist collections, but have proven too expensive and narrow to be applied to everyday webscale search. Wikipedia has the potential to bring structured knowledge into more widespread use. This online, collaboratively generated encyclopaedia is one of the largest and most consulted reference works in existence. It is broader, deeper and more agile than the knowledge bases put forward to assist retrieval in the past. Rendering this resource machine-readable is a challenging task that has captured the interest of many researchers. Many see it as a key step required to break the knowledge acquisition bottleneck that crippled previous efforts. This ..."
