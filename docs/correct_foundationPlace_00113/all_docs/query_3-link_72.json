        "text": "Send visitors to pages on your site, external content, email addresses, files, and more.\n\nUse links to help visitors navigate pages on your site, or guide them to external sites, files, email addresses, and phone numbers.\n\nThis guide covers links that visitors can click on your site. To learn more about linking visitors to your website from elsewhere, visit Sharing URLs from your site.\n\nTip: To help make your links accessible to the broadest audience possible, visit Accessibility resources at Squarespace.\n\nWhere you can add links\n\nYou can add links to almost any part of your site. For steps on adding various types of links, visit the corresponding guide:\n\nText - Create links almost anywhere you can add text\n\nNavigation - Add links to your site's navigation structure\n\nImages - Turn images into links\n\nButton blocks - Add button links to content areas\n\nCover pages (version 7.0 only) - Add links or buttons in the Actions panel of cover pages\n\nWhat you can link to\n\nDepending on where you create the link, you can link to:\n\nContent or posts filtered by a tag or category\n\nEmail addresses\n\nExternal sites or pages\n\nFiles\n\nPages on your site\n\nPhone numbers\n\nSpecific points on a page (anchor links)\n\nSpecific images within a gallery page, also called deeplink URLs (version 7.0 only)\n\nLink to external sites\n\nTo link to an external URL, such as the website for a friend's business or a third-party service you use with your site:\n\nSelect URL in the link editor drop-down.\n\nEnter the complete URL in the text field.\n\nSwitch the Open link in new tab toggle off to have the link open in the same tab.\n\nPress Enter or click outside the block editor when you're done.\n\nNotes: It isn't possible to automatically force links to open in an entirely new browser window, as this can cause issues with a browser's pop-up blocker.\n\nWe recommend following the steps in the next section to link to pages on your own site, but you may want to use the steps above to link to certain content from your site that you can't otherwise link to, such as:\n\nAn individual blog post, event, or portfolio sub-page\n\nCollections filtered by categories or tags\n\nA search page\n\nAnchor links\n\nAn individual gallery image (version 7.0 only)\n\nLink to your site's content\n\nTo link to pages on your site, individual products, collection categories, or collection tags:\n\nSelect URL in the link editor drop-down.\n\nStart typing the title or URL for the page you want to link, or start typing the category or tag on the collection page you want to link.\n\nSelect the page, product, category, or tag from the drop-down list of results.\n\nSwitch the Open link in new tab toggle on to have the link open in a new tab.\n\nPress Enter or click outside the block editor when you're done.\n\nKeep in mind:\n\nIf you change a linked page's URL slug, open the link and type in the new URL to update the link.\n\nTo link to an individual blog post, event, or portfolio sub-page, add its complete URL to the field.\n\nOn version 7.0, linking to an index's sub-page takes visitors to a standalone version of the page. To link to a sub-page within the main layout of a stacked index, add an index anchor link in the web address tab.\n\nLink to email addresses\n\nLink to an email address to encourage visitors to contact you. When visitors click the link, it opens a blank email in their default email service and automatically populates it with your information.\n\nTo link to an email address:\n\nSelect Email in the link editor drop-down.\n\nUnder To, enter the email address you want visitors to send their message to, and click CC and BCC to add email addresses to populate those fields. It's not possible to add multiple email addresses in one field.\n\nUnder Subject, enter a subject to populate the email's subject line.\n\nUnder Body, enter body text to populate the email's message. Keep in mind, visitors who click the email link can edit any populated fields before sending an email, and formatting may vary depending on the email service.\n\nPress Enter or click outside the block editor when you're done.\n\nNote: If your visitor doesn't have an email program installed on their device, the email link won't open. They'll need to copy your email address manually from the link.\n\nAdd other ways for visitors to email you\n\nSome people prefer not to show their email address for privacy reasons. To encourage emails without showing your address, add a contact form using a form block. This provides a layer of security, and you can respond directly to a form submission by email.\n\nFor a more visual approach, you can add your email address as a social icon. This creates an envelope icon with a \"mailto\" link that appears with your other social icons.\n\nAdd a mobile information bar to give visitors quick access to your contact information on the go.\n\nLink to phone numbers\n\nLink to your phone number to encourage visitors to call or text you. When a visitor taps the link from a smartphone, it prompts them to call or text the number.\n\nNote: If you add a phone number as plain text without linking to it, its formatting will vary across devices. Some devices automatically detect it's a phone number and show it as a link. To ensure it always displays as a link, follow the steps below.\n\nTo link to a phone number:\n\nSelect Phone in the link editor drop-down.\n\nEnter your phone number in the field, including country code and area code, if applicable. Don't include 0 at the beginning of the number, as this may cause the link to fail.\n\nSelect Call for the link to call the number, or select Text for the link to open a blank text message to the number.\n\nPress Enter or click outside the block editor when you're done.\n\nAdd other ways for visitors to call you\n\nAdd a mobile information bar to give visitors quick access to call you on the go.\n\nLink to files\n\nUnder File in the link editor, you can upload and link to files, like .pdf menus, size charts, or audio files. Depending on the browser and file type, uploaded files will download automatically or open in new tabs, where visitors can view them or save them to their computer.\n\nTo link to a file:\n\nSelect File in the link editor drop-down.\n\nClick the upload icon to select a file from your computer. If you want to link to a file you've already uploaded to your site, you can search for it, or select it from the Recently uploaded list.\n\nSwitch the Open link in new tab toggle off to have the file open in the same tab if possible. Keep in mind, some file types may open in a new tab when visitors click the link regardless of this setting.\n\nPress Enter or click outside the block editor when you're done.\n\nTo learn more, visit Uploading and managing files.\n\nLink to a collection item\n\nYou can link to products from your online store directly by searching for them with the URL option in the link editor. For other collection items, like blog posts, events, and portfolio sub-pages, add the full URL of the item in the URL field.\n\nTo link to a collection item:\n\nOpen the item you want to link to in a private browser.\n\nCopy the item's full URL, including your domain name.\n\nOpen a link editor on your site and select URL.\n\nPaste the item's full URL into the text field.\n\nSwitch the Open link in new tab toggle off to have the link open in the same tab.\n\nPress Enter or click outside the block editor when you're done.\n\nChange how a link opens\n\nTo change how a web address, page, or file link opens, go to the editing area where you added the link. This could be a clickthrough URL, button block, navigation link, or text link.\n\nTo open the link in a new tab, switch the Open link in new tab toggle on.\n\nTo open the link in the same tab, switch the Open link in new tab toggle off.\n\nIf you're editing in the Squarespace app and don't see the toggle, use a computer to change how the link opens.\n\nKeep in mind:\n\nSquarespace doesn't support setting links to open in an entirely new window, since this can cause issues with a browser's pop-up blocker.\n\nLinks to your site's content set to Open link in new tab open in the same tab when you're logged into your site. When you're logged out or visiting the site in an incognito browser, they open in a new tab as expected.\n\nHow the link opens is ultimately up to the visitor and how they use their browser. Even if a link is set to open in the same tab, visitors can open it in a new tab using shortcuts.\n\nLinks in gallery blocks\n\nOnly the grid layout of gallery blocks supports opening clickthrough URLs in a new tab.\n\nIn a grid gallery block, set clickthrough URL links to open in a new tab by checking the option in the design tab. This option applies to all images in the grid gallery block.\n\nWhile editing the page, hover over the grid gallery block and click Edit.\n\nClick the Design tab.\n\nScroll down and check or uncheck Open Links in New Window.\n\nClick Apply to save your changes.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nFor help with broken links and other issues, visit Troubleshooting link issues.\n\nWas this article helpful? 309 out of 876 found this helpful"
