        "text": "How does it work?\n\nYou create a Dynamic Link either by using the Firebase console, using a REST API, iOS or Android Builder API, or by forming a URL by adding Dynamic Link parameters to a domain specific to your app. These parameters specify the links you want to open, depending on the user's platform and whether your app is installed.\n\nWhen a user opens one of your Dynamic Links, if your app isn't yet installed, the user is sent to the Play Store or App Store to install your app (unless you specify otherwise), and your app opens. You can then retrieve the link that was passed to your app and handle the deep link as appropriate for your app.\n\nCustom link domains\n\nYou can create Dynamic Links using your own domain name:\n\nhttps://example.com/summer-sale https://example.com/links/promos/summer-sale https://links.example.com/summer-sale https://ex.amp.le/summer-sale\n\nOr, if you don't have a domain for your app, you can use a no-cost custom page.link subdomain:\n\nhttps://example.page.link/summer-sale\n\nCreate your subdomain at no charge in the Firebase console.\n\nAll Dynamic Links features, including analytics, post-install attributions, and SDK integrations, work with both custom page.link domains and your own domain.\n\nImplementation path\n\nSet up Firebase and the Dynamic Links SDK Enable Firebase Dynamic Links for your Firebase project in the Firebase console. Then, include the Dynamic Links SDK in your app. Create Dynamic Links You can create Dynamic Links programmatically or by using the Firebase console. Handle Dynamic Links in your app When your app opens, use the Dynamic Links SDK to check if a Dynamic Link was passed to it. If so, get the deep link from the Dynamic Link data and handle the deep link as necessary. View analytics data Track the performance of your Dynamic Links in the Firebase console.\n\nNext steps"
