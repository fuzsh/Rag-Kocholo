The OpenLink site says you can use ODBC, JDBC, etc…but the step by step details of exactly how to make it work with BO aren’t clear to me. Appreciate feedback from anybody who’s actually done this, or tried and failed, pitfalls, etc.\n\nThanks\n\nccermak (BOB member since 2007-11-13)\n\n[Moderator note - moved to the Semantic Layer forum]\n\nGiven what you have said, assuming you have details of the database why not try creating a connection and see if you can create a universe?\n\nNick Daniels (BOB member since 2002-08-15)\n\nCouple different reasons.\n\nFirst being I don’t have access to the db…yet, so it’s just theory at this point. It contains sensitive information and resides on it’s own dedicated domain, in CA and I’m in MN, with it’s own approvals etc. Security won’t let me connect to it and drag data across the WAN. Plan is to perform a POC by standing up a dedicated BO virtual server on the same domain as the db. This will take some time to get through the red tape…meanwhile I tried using the provided wizard on the OpenLink website to put in versions and OS’s to get to the correct driver, ODBC or otherwise, to download. No such luck, came up empty every time even selecting “Windows” on both fronts, meaning which OS is BO running on and which OS is “Virtuoso” running on, which seemed pretty vanilla.\n\nccermak (BOB member since 2007-11-13)\n\nQuestions about OpenLink Virtuoso are almost always best raised on the public OpenLink Discussion Forums, the Virtuoso Users mailing list, or through a confidential Support Case…\n\nYou can get the relevant Client Connectivity Kit for your needs from the main Virtuoso download page. For 32-bit client connections to Virtuoso 7, please use the Virtuoso 6 kit. 64-bit clients are better off with the Virtuoso 7 kit.\n\nYou can also set up a local Virtuoso instance for your own testing, while you await access to the corporate instance. For this purpose, you can use either the commercial version, under the two-week free trial license or any of the entry-level licenses available for purchase, or the Open Source version.\n\nOpenLink (BOB member since 2013-12-05)\n\nThanks! That’s the type of response I was looking for\n\nccermak (BOB member since 2007-11-13)"
