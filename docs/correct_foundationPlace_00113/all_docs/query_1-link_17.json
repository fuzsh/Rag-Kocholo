        "text": "We are pleased to announce the latest release of our YouID Browser Extension (for Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox, and others), alongside the native App for iOS.\n\nThis new release (1.5.11) adds Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains as additional sources of credentials for self-sovereign identity authenticity that work without incurring any “gas fees” nor triggering any “proof of work” or “proof of stake” related operations.\n\nUser Interface for generating self-sovereign identity credentials pegged to a Bitcoin Blockchain\n\nyouid-btc-blockchain-cert-demo-11130×740 49.3 KB\n\nUser Interface for generating self-sovereign identity credentials pegged to an Ethereum Blockchain\n\nyouid-eth-blockchain-cert-demo-11158×732 49 KB\n\nWhat is YouID?\n\nYouID is a tool for generating personal credentials (each comprised of a digital certificate and associated private key) that enable Internet- and Web-scale identity authenticity to be controlled by users themselves, rather than by third parties.\n\nWhy is YouID important?\n\nPrivacy and identity authenticity currently pose the biggest challenges to the deeply connected world arising from Internet and Web ubiquity. This challenge exists primarily due to the complex nature of identity, and the historic inability of technological solutions to understand the challenges posed both to the individual and to society at large.\n\nGrounding Rule:\n\nA third party cannot provide an individual with privacy, since that is a strictly individual superpower.\n\nThat rule provides both the technical and philosophical foundation upon which YouID has been developed.\n\nHow do I use YouID?\n\nSimply perform the following steps:\n\nLaunch the browser extension or iOS app\n\nSelect your preferred source of profile information\n\nFill in any empty fields remaining in the credentials data entry form\n\nGenerate a credential document — a secure file comprising a digital identity card (a/k/a certificate) and its associated private key\n\nDownload the secure credential document to your desktop, notebook, tablet, or phone\n\nOpen the credential document on your chosen device, and let the native operating system complete the process of storing your credential safely in its native credential store (a/k/a Keychain or Key Store)\n\nOnce completed, you will be able to perform the following tasks:\n\nSend digitally signed emails that can be verified by the recipients email package\n\nSend digitally signed and encrypted emails that can be verified and decrypted by the recipients email package\n\nSign PDFs (including documents sent for signature by various digital signing services)\n\nBegin the pursuit of document sharing (with specific individuals or groups) without requiring sharing-invitation recipients to join third party services\n\nRelated"
