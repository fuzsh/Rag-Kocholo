        "text": "The goal of the Netflix Open Connect program is to provide our millions of Netflix subscribers the highest-quality viewing experience possible. We achieve this goal by partnering with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to deliver our content more efficiently. We partner with over a thousand ISPs to localize substantial amounts of traffic with Open Connect Appliance embedded deployments, and we have an open peering policy at our interconnection locations. If you are an ISP with a substantial amount of Netflix traffic, review this information to learn more about the program.\n\nFor more information about Open Connect, see:\n\nOpen Connect Briefing Paper: A cooperative approach to content delivery (PDF - English only)\n\nOverview of Open Connect (PDF - English only)\n\nOpen Connect blog post\n\nKey links on this site:\n\nISP partnership options\n\nEngagement process\n\nRequirements for deploying embedded Open Connect Appliances\n\nDeploying embedded appliances\n\nPeering guidelines and contact information\n\nPeering locations\n\nFill out the appliance request form if you are interested in embedded appliance solutions.\n\nThe Netflix Open Connect program provides opportunities for ISP partners to improve their customers' Netflix user experience by localizing Netflix traffic and minimizing the delivery of traffic that is served over a transit provider.\n\nThere are two main components of the program, which are architected in partnership with ISPs to provide maximum benefit in each individual situation: embedded Open Connect Appliances and settlement-free interconnection (SFI).\n\nEmbedded Open Connect Appliances (OCAs)\n\nOpen Connect Appliances can be embedded in your ISP network. Embedded OCAs have the same capabilities as the OCAs that we use in our 60+ global data centers, and they are provided to qualifying ISP partners at no charge. Each embedded OCA deployment will offload a substantial amount of Netflix content traffic from peering or transport circuits. Multiple physical deployments can be distributed or clustered on a geographic or network basis to maximize local offload.\n\nNetflix provides:\n\nNetwork architecture and technical turn-up expertise\n\nOngoing monitoring and issue resolution\n\nPartner support\n\nISP partners work with Netflix to configure BGP sessions with the OCAs to steer traffic, and the appliances require a small amount of data center rack space, power, and connectivity.\n\nIf you have substantial Netflix traffic destined to your ISP customers, deploying embedded OCAs is usually the most beneficial option. However, embedded OCAs are not always deployed, depending on your traffic levels, data center limitations, or other factors.\n\nThe OCA Deployment Guide provides deployment details. If you are interested in OCA deployment at your ISP, please fill out our OCA request form.\n\nSettlement-free interconnection (SFI)\n\nConnect via direct Private Network Interconnect (PNI) or IXP-based SFI peering to Netflix Open Connect Appliances in our data centers. Peering alone can be beneficial.\n\nIf you deploy embedded OCAs, you also set up SFI peering for additional resiliency and to enable nightly content fills and updates.\n\nNetflix has the ability to interconnect at a number of global data center facilities and public Internet Exchange fabrics as listed on our Peering Locations page. We openly peer with any network at IXP locations where we are mutually present and we consider private interconnection as appropriate. If you are interested in interconnection, please review the information on the Peering Locations page.\n\nISPs who do not currently participate in public peering might want to consider that a single IX port can support multiple peering sessions, providing direct access to various content, cloud, and network providers. In addition to Netflix, many large organizations such as Akamai, Amazon, Facebook, and Google/YouTube widely participate in public peering and combine to deliver a substantial percentage of traffic to a typical ISP.\n\nFrom a connectivity standpoint, IX ports can be reached locally in a data center or via transport. We recommend http://peeringdb.com as a detailed source of information that can help you find an IX that best meets your needs."
