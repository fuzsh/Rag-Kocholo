I believe a way round this is to install OpenLink onto the NAS but the instructions at this point overwhelm me.\n\nCould someone simplify it please as I tried downloading an official firmware and what I believe I need - the LS2 version of OpenLink but I haven't a clue how to get it to flash it.\n\nI'm basing it off here - http://buffalo.nas-central.org/wiki/OpenLink and I think I'm using MIPSeL.\n\nMy Linux knowledge is nowhere near what it needs to be to figure this out.\n\nCheers."
