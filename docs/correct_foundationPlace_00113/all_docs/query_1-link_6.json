        "text": "... for the lifetime of the system\n\nToo many consultancies \"cut and run\": the project is forced over the line and then the client is left to deal with the consequences.\n\nAt Trinitatum, we believe in designing for the long-term. That means tests that won't stop working three months after go live. It means comprehensive documentation; auto-generated from source so it remains up to date.\n\nMost of all it means the investment in test automation continues to pay back; for the lifetime of the system.\n\nIntroducing Dynamic Testing\n\nNot content with automated execution of tests, Triangle enables the automatic generation of tests: tests that adapt dynamically to the system they are testing.\n\nOur “Test Accelerators” provide templates that embody testing best practice which Triangle can utilise to rapidly generate extensive test suites, tailored to your configuration. No more lengthy, up-front investment… with the hope of rewards. Dynamic Testing and Test Accelerators produce a quick result to the present needs as well as the ability to adapt to future challenges.\n\nThe problem\n\nThe client has suffered before. Armies of consultants arrive on site, consume large amounts of paper & money and then leave when the system (just about) goes live. The client is stuck with long term maintenance costs and a system that is expensive to change and hard to understand.\n\nThis time they vowed it would be different. They sought a trusted partner to develop a long-term automated regression capability; one that would deliver immediate benefits but would still be driving down the cost of change 5-10 years from now.\n\nOh, and the project was behind schedule so all this was to be done without distracting core project resources.\n\nThe solution\n\nThe project has already been running for a year when Trinitatum arrive on site.\n\nWithin weeks, the Trinitatum lead has performed a full system review (including documentation, source code and ad hoc analysis) and identified an approach and set of test principles that were reviewed and accepted by the programme management.\n\nAt the end of month one, the first automated test scenario is running and reviewed by business analysts and domain experts.\n\nIn month two, tests are running overnight and a project dashboard is available every morning.\n\nIn month three 85% of defects are found by Trinitatum’s regression test team.\n\nIn month four the functional tests are leveraged to provide automated performance and concurrency tests.\n\nIn months five and six, a full set of P&L, Exposure and Attribution tests are developed from first principles.\n\nThe Problem\n\nOur client had bought an off-the-shelf market data repository that required extensive customisation to meet their requirements. The project was over-running and a rash of technical issues was hampering progress. The test team were a disparate group of contract testers. Under pressure to deliver, animosity existed between the developers, testers and business analysts which had resulted in a breakdown in communication. There were frequent software releases to address the burgeoning bug list, but no test automation. This meant that >60% of each test cycle was occupied with labour-intensive manual regression testing. This was disheartening the testers and distracting them from doing proper testing."
