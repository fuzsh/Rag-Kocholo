We have collaborated with the NHS e-Learning for Healthcare (eLfH) and the Royal College of Anaesthetists e-Learning in Anaesthesia project (eLA) to develop four self-directed modules. You can launch the modules direct from the NTSP website by clicking the links below, or register with eLfH and access them directly through eLfH. Some use the eLfH portal to record courses and training activities, particularly in NHS England. Alternatively, you can generate you own certificate of completion by accessing the courses direct from the NTSP (this page). This certificate can be used for your own training records and may be acceptable to your employer.

Depending on your browser version, sometimes the JAVA script doesn't like linking directly from the website. Please RIGHT-CLICK the links below and choose 'open link in new window' (not a new tab) if you are having trouble opening the modules.
