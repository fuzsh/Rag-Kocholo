Waylon Arnold Jennings was born June 15th 1937 in Littlefield, Texas, USA.

Hired by Buddy Holly to play bass on the ill fated tour that led to Waylon giving up his seat on the plane to J.P. Richardson, otherwise known as 'The Big Bopper'. That of course was February 3rd 1959, 'The day the music died'. The plane crash on that day took the lives of Holly, Richardson and young Richie Valens along with the pilot.

Waylon, deep into country music, was one of the founders of the 'Outlaw Movement' in the 1970's a much more roots brand of music with an edge to it.

In the 1980's, Waylon formed the band called "The Highwaymen" along with Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson & Johnny Cash.

His solo career also flourished and he cut many great records throughout the years.

In later life his health suffered from drug abuse, drinking & smoking. He developed diabetes which led to the amputation of his left foot. He passed away in his sleep from diabetic complications after surgery on February 13th 2002 in Chandler, Arizona, aged 64.

He was survived by his wife, singer Jessi Colter whom he married in 1969 and his son Waylon Albright "Shooter" Jennings now a Country performer in his own right.

The above album, which speaks for itself, was issued in 1979 on the RCA Victor label.
