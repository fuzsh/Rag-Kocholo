WAYLON JENNINGS, who defined the outlaw movement in country music, has died. He was 64.

Jennings's spokesman Schatzie Hageman said the musician, who had long suffered from diabetes-related health problems, died peacefully at his home in Arizona.

Jennings, a singer, songwriter and guitarist, recorded 60 albums and had 16 No 1 singles in a career that spanned five decades. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in October.

In recent years his poor health had made it difficult for him to walk. In December, his left foot was amputated at a Phoenix hospital. Jennings and his wife, singer Jessi Colter, sold their home in Nashville more than a year ago and moved to Chandler, Arizona.

With pal Willie Nelson, Jennings performed duets such as Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys, Luckenbach and Good Hearted Woman. His resonant, authoritative voice also was used to narrate the popular TV series The Dukes of Hazzard, and he sang the show's theme song, which became a million seller.

He traditionally wore a black cowboy hat and ebony attire that accented his black beard and moustache. Often reclusive when not on stage, he played earthy music with a spirited, hard edge and had a well-defined image that matched well with his history of battling record producers to do music his way.
