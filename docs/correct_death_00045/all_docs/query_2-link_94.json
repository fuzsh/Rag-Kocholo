        "text": "The Outlaw Country Music movement ended long ago and, according to author Joe Nick Patoski, who wrote a respected Willie Nelson biography (\"Willie Nelson: An Epic Life\"), \"A decade after his death, Waylon's music is nowhere near as respected as it should be.\n\n\"Anyone doing Texas music, or Texas-style country, and anyone infusing rock and roll in their country, owes him a debt of gratitude for breaking the Nashville assembly-line system of recording and gaining the artists' control of their music.\n\n\"He's the one, the real Nashville rebel.\"\n\nProbably few expected the late Jennings, a Littlefield native who would have celebrated his 75th birthday earlier this summer, to one day be that rebel as they watched him spin records for KLLL Radio in Lubbock, or play bass for Buddy Holly on his ill-fated Winter Dance Party tour.\n\nOn the other hand, even Holly carved his own musical path. So why not Jennings?\n\nCountry Music Television dubbed Jennings the \"Greatest Outlaw of All Time.\"\n\nOutlaw in this case had nothing to do with crime. Rather, Jennings fought to play music the way he wanted, and that meant including his rock 'n' roll\n\ninfluences within the country sound.\n\nThat also meant defying Nashville.\n\nIt was Jennings - along with Willie Nelson, Jessie Colter and Tompall Glaser - who released an album in 1976 called \"Wanted! The Outlaws,\" which became the first platinum country music album with more than one million copies sold. But unlike Nelson, Jennings did not move to Austin.\n\nHe fought his battles in Tennessee.\n\nHe would take an even stronger stand, telling interviewers, \"The whole thing is that you're treated like a stepchild. They were stealing, basically. Stealing from us old country boys down here.\"\n\nThat would stop after Jennings hired Neil Reshen to be his business manager. It was Reshen who negotiated the deal that allowed Jennings to produce his own records.\n\nOr as Patoski told the Avalanche-Journal, \"If Waylon had not found Neil Reshen, we wouldn't even be talking about Willie or Waylon as one-name superstars.\"\n\nBut asked how Jennings is remembered in 2012, more than 10 years after he died from complications of diabetes, even British author John Goldrosen, who wrote the definitive Buddy Holly biography, \"The Buddy Holly Story,\" told the A-J, \"Jennings is remembered as someone who toughened up country and brought in a rock influence. And as a protege of Buddy Holly, of course. Buddy would have been proud of him, I think.\"\n\nJeff Scott, operations manager for four Lubbock radio stations, including KLLL, said Jennings is remembered \"as a pioneer, both musically and from a business standpoint. Waylon definitely paved the way for artists having more control of their own careers.\"\n\n\"At 75,\" said Austin music journalist and author John T. Davis, \"Waylon is remembered as a pioneer in the country-rock or progressive country genre, as a lodestone of Texas music and West Texas music in particular, and as a maverick in the sense that he approached the business as an independent spirit who insisted on doing things his own way.\"\n\nLongtime Lubbock radio personality Kidd Manning feels that Jennings' son, Shooter, plays a role in his being remembered.\n\nManning said, \"Shooter continues to release songs either re-recorded or remixed to keep the memories of Waylon fresh in music lovers' minds. The re-release of 'Lonesome, Onry and Mean,' with reworked guitar parts by Shooter, got everybody's attention a few years back, along with Waylon's take on rock band Cream's song 'White Room.'\n\n\"Waylon is remembered as a son of Texas, an Outlaw who led the '70s' musical movement that some would say was the beginning of what we know as Texas country.\"\n\nLubbock residents Larry Corbin and Jerry Coleman knew Jennings as friends. Corbin's family owned KLLL Radio, which hired Jennings as a deejay and watched as Buddy Holly saw his potential as a musician. Coleman recalls Jennings telling more than one person that he (Coleman) was the best deejay he had listened to.\n\nBut Jennings' career began before he met Holly.\n\nHis mother, Lorene, originally named him Wayland, but changed it to Waylon after a Baptist preacher congratulated her on naming her son after Wayland Baptist University.\n\nWhen Jennings turned 8, Lorene taught him how to play guitar with the song \"Thirty Pieces of Silver.\"\n\nJennings kept practicing, hoping to avoid having to pick cotton when he was older. He formed his own band as a teenager, and dropped out of school in the 10th grade. (He would later earn his GED.)\n\nHe also landed his first deejay job at age 14, and would move to Lubbock to continue playing, and also work as a deejay.\n\nIn 1958, Holly arranged a recording session for Jennings, where he recorded \"Jolie Blon\" and \"When Sin Stops (Love Begins).\"\n\n\"Holly saw something in ol' Waylon. After that last tour, Holly had said he was going to come back to Lubbock and build his own recording studio, and Waylon was going to be one of his first acts,\" said Corbin.\n\nCorbin recalls Jennings as \"a free spirit who refused to be bound by old traditions. Besides, country music was nothing more than white man's blues; all you had to do was listen to the words in black songs to see that.\"\n\nHe added that KLLL, even in the beginning, \"was country, but not traditional. We also played Presley, Holly and rockabilly.\n\n\"Waylon was a great deejay at KLLL,\" he said.\n\n\"Buddy said he would make Waylon a star someday. Waylon was still a KLLL deejay and Buddy asked my brother Sky if he could 'borrow' Waylon for a few weeks,\" said Corbin.\n\nHolly needed a bass player. Jennings could not play bass, but Corbin's brother Ray spent long nights at KLLL teaching Waylon \"how to at least play Buddy's songs,\" said Larry.\n\nJennings originally had a seat on the airplane that crashed and took Holly's life. He gave up that seat to J.P. Richardson (the Big Bopper), who had a cold.\n\n\"When the news of the crash came over the wire, it said, 'Buddy Holly and his band were killed in a plane crash.' We assumed Waylon had been killed, too,\" said Corbin.\n\n\"Waylon called us later that day, very scared and upset. He wanted us to send him money so he could come home. The tour promoter knew he had a publicity bonanza and would not pay anybody until they finished the tour.\"\n\nJennings calmed down and stayed with the tour.\n\nJennings had been making $90 per week at KLLL. He said Buddy had been paying him $200 a week and he returned to Lubbock only a short time to deejay at KDAV.\n\nLargely because he fought a battle to choose and produce his own music, Jennings wound up recording 60 albums and releasing 16 number one singles. Although he despised awards shows, he won two Grammy Awards and four Country Music Association awards.\n\nHe also made friends in Hollywood, and is known for narrating and singing the theme song for \"The Dukes of Hazzard.\"\n\nJennings made 17 appearances as an actor, most of them in made-for-television movies, although he also took part in the feature film \"Maverick.\"\n\nSongs such as \"Mama, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\" and \"Good Hearted Woman\" were said to have influenced such artists as Travis Tritt and Steve Earle.\n\nScott added, \"I think you still hear Waylon's musical influence in today's music, particularly in songs by Jason Aldean on the mainstream charts and Roger Creager on the Texas scene.\n\n\"His influence also shows in the number of artists who write and produce their own music, and have a bigger role in the business side of what they do.\"\n\nRetired radio executive Scott Harris said those \"directly influenced by Waylon include Montgomery Gentry, Pat Green, Jack Ingram, Dierks Bentley and not to leave out Shooter Jennings.\"\n\nAs for Waylon Jennings' lasting impact, not all agree.\n\nAsked if his music still has an impact, Davis said, \"Not as much as it should. I think his legacy, both musical and the way he approached his business, has been largely overlooked by the mainstream country establishment. I expect him to be rediscovered soon and take his rightful place alongside Merle (Haggard), Hank Williams and Johnny Cash.\"\n\nJay Richardson, KLLL radio vice president and market manager said, \"He pioneered an edgy sound to country music that lives both in Nashville and on the Texas country scene. If not for Waylon, country could very well be stuck in the bluegrass and western music image that it had been branded with so long ago.\"\n\nHarris, who's retired from KLLL, said, \"From my perspective, from where I'm sitting now and not as a deejay, I would have to say Waylon's impact becomes smaller and smaller as time goes on. I'm sure those close to Waylon and those in the country music business would argue. ... He is a legend and legends leave a mark that takes a while to dissipate.\"\n\nGoldrosen emailed from England, \"I don't know if this will be helpful because, to be honest, when I listen to country music today, I don't hear much of Waylon or the 'outlaw' sound. In the '70s, Waylon and Willie seemed revolutionary.\n\n\" ... Willie grew up in Texas with cowboy ballads, honky tonk, western swing and Mexican music. Waylon grew up in West Texas with rockabilly and '50s rock and roll layered on top of it. It was an alternative to Nashville pop, and now Nashville is more pop than ever.\"\n\nPatoski pointed out, \"He was the first country act to play arenas and stadiums. No one had done that before him, and few have done it effectively since. Waylon changed the way business was done in the music business, and he changed the way music was created within the country realm.\"\n\nQuietly generous\n\nCorbin also remembers Jennings for his generosity, saying, \"He was a prince of a guy.\"\n\nWhen the Lubbock Memorial Civic Center was to be dedicated after the devastation of the 1970 Lubbock tornado, Jennings and wife Jessie Colter were contacted. Corbin said, \"Waylon told me, 'I would like to do it, but I don't want to get paid. Just pay our hotel bill and give the rest to your favorite charity.' \"\n\nWaylon, Colter, Corbin and his wife, Jackie, drove to the Texas Boys Ranch the next day and presented management with \"a check for something like $25,000,\" said Corbin.\n\n\"Waylon took nothing.\"\n\nWhen the Buddy Holly statue was dedicated, another concert took place. Corbin said Jennings wanted to do the show while Holly's parents were alive to \"show his love and respect for them and Buddy.\"\n\nBut he would not allow his name to be used in promoting the show. Instead, he chartered a jet to Lubbock and began playing backup while the Crickets were on stage.\n\n\"It was several minutes before anyone in the audience saw him and said, 'That's Waylon Jennings,'\" said Corbin.\n\nLater, Corbin and Coleman visited Jennings in Nashville. They recall Jennings saying, \"A buddy of mine has had some troubles.\" It was the day George Jones had declared bankruptcy.\n\nThey said they accompanied him as Jennings carried a black bag to Jones' home and said, \"This is to help you out.\"\n\n\"There was $26,000 cash in that bag,\" said Corbin and Coleman.\n\nMost agree that Jennings reflected his roots and a determination to make music without being told what to do.\n\n\"I think the independent, hardworking spirit of West Texans definitely contributed to his legacy,\" said Scott.\n\nDavis called Jennings \"a large figure in a decades-spanning pantheon of West Texas musicians that ranges from Bob Wills to Buddy Holly, Roy Orbison, Joe Ely and many more.\"\n\nHarris agrees, saying, \"Waylon's talent was molded here with the influences that thrive in West Texas. Out here in the 'land of the real man,' most of us grew up with both rock and country influences. You can hear it in Waylon's music. There is a mixture that is purely West Texas.\n\n\"Listen to the traditional country flavor in earlier songs like, 'Only daddy that will walk the line.' Then later he morphs into more of the harder rock licks with masterpieces like 'Ain't living long like this.' He was able to combine both genres and invent a sound that was uniquely Waylon.\"\n\nRichardson noted, \"I believe being surrounded with all of the music of this region, from Buddy Holly to Bob Wills, allowed him to grow musically unlike many artists. We really are a musical melting pot.\"\n\nAnd Manning added, \"Waylon's early relationships with Buddy Holly, his time spent on the air, and his ability to make friends in the business was the platform that Waylon built his career on. ... Waylon was all Texas and was not that impressed with Nashville or the workings of the music business. Waylon always looked back to home, Texas. He says it in 'Sweet Mother Texas.'\n\n\"Waylon reminded us how lucky we are to be from Texas.\"\n\nPatoski said, \"(Waylon's) determination, hard-headedness, passion and drive to do it his way are just his West Texas roots showing. I'm glad his music is still with us, and still sounds as great as when it first came out.\"\n\nTo comment on this story:\n\nwilliam.kerns@lubbockonline.com\n\n• 766-8712\n\nleesha.faulkner@lubbockonline.com • 766-8747"
