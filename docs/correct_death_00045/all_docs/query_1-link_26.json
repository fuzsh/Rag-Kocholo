        "text": "Jennings' spokeswoman Schatzie Hageman says he died peacefully at his home in Arizona.\n\nHe recorded 60 albums and had 16 number one country singles in a career spanning five decades. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in October last year.\n\nJennings had been plagued with diabetes-related health problems in recent years that made it difficult for him to walk. In December, his left foot was amputated at a Phoenix hospital.\n\nWith pal Willie Nelson, Jennings performed duets like Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys, Luckenbach and Good Hearted Woman. Those 1970s songs nurtured a progressive sound and restless spirit embraced later by Travis Tritt, Charlie Daniels, Steve Earle and others.\n\nHis resonant, authoritative voice also was used to narrate the popular TV show The Dukes Of Hazzard. He also sang its theme song, which was a million seller.\n\nIn 1959, his career was nearly cut short by tragedy. He was scheduled to fly on the light plane that crashed and killed his friend Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper. Jennings gave up his seat on the plane to the Big Bopper, who was ill and wanted to fly rather than travel by bus with those left behind.\n\nBorn in Littlefield, Texas, Jennings became a radio disc jockey at 14 and formed his own band not long afterwards.\n\nBy the early 1960s Jennings was playing regularly at a nightclub in Phoenix. In 1963, he was signed by Herb Alpert's A & M Records, then was signed by RCA in Nashville shortly thereafter by Chet Atkins. Once in Nashville, he and Cash became friends and roommates."
