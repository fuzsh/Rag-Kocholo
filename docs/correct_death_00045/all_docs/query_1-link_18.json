        "text": "Waylon Jennings has died at his home in Arizona. The country music superstar had suffered from diabetes-related health problems for some time. He was 64.\n\nJennings recorded 60 albums, and had 16 No. 1 country singles in a career that spanned five decades.\n\nHe was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame last October.\n\nIn 1959, Jennings played bass in Buddy Holly's band, The Crickets, on Holly's last tour.\n\nHe was scheduled to fly in the plane that crashed, killing Holly. But he gave up his seat at the last minute so that another singer, J.P. Richardson, known as The Big Bopper, could fly in his place. Richardson was ill and wanted to fly rather than take the bus to the next tour stop.\n\nSinger Ritchie Valens was also killed in that plane crash.\n\nJennings was born on Littlefield, Texas and became a disc jockey at age 14. He and Holly were friends in Lubbock, Texas, and Jennings joined Holly's band. He later said that what he learned from Holly was that music \"shouldn't have any barriers.\"\n\nLater friends and musical associates would include Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson. In the mid-1980s the four teamed up to form the group The Highwaymen.\n\nIn 1984 he said he said he wanted to be remembered for his music, not for his wild lifestyle. \"Some people have their music. My music has me.\"\n\nJennings is survived by his fourth wife Colter and his son Shooter."
