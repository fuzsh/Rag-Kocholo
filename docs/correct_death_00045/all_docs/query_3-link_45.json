        "text": "Waylon Arnold Jennings (born June 15, 1937 – died February 13, 2002) was an American country music singer, songwriter,Waylon was married to Jesse Colter. He sang with Willie Nelson.\n\nBirth[]\n\nWaylon Jennings was born in Littlefield, Texas, the son of Lorene Beatrice and William Albert Jennings. His original birth name was Wayland, meaning land by the highway, but it was changed after a Baptist preacher visited Jennings' parents and congratulated his mother for naming him after the Wayland Baptist University in Plainview, Texas. Lorene Jennings, who had been unaware of the college, changed the spelling to Waylon.\n\nDeath[]\n\nJennings' health had been bad for years prior to his death. Jennings quit cocaine, and his habit of smoking six packs of cigarettes daily. In 1988 he underwent heart bypass surgery. By 2000 his diabetes worsened, and the pain reduced his mobility, forcing Jennings to end most touring. Later the same year he went under surgery to improve his leg circulation. In December 2001 his left foot was amputated at a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona. On February 13, 2002, Jennings died in his sleep of diabetic complications in Chandler, Arizona. Jennings was buried in the Mesa City Cemetery, in Mesa, Arizona."
