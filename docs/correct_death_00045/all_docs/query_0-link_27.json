Jennings also became the narrator of the show for all seven seasons.\n\nIn the 1980s he formed the group The Highwaymen along with Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson.\n\nIn 2001, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nOn February 13, 2002, Waylon Jennings died in Chandler, Arizona from health complications due to diabetes.[2][3]\n\n\"Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\" (with Willie Nelson) (1978)\n\n\"Theme from The Dukes of Hazzard (Good Ol' Boys)\" (1980)\n\nList of country musicians from Texas"
