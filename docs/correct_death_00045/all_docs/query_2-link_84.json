Not only was he a leader of the rock and roll genre while playing with Buddy Holly, but he also put out nearly a hundred records that were revolutionary and against what society believed was 'right'. Maybe he didn't always have the distorted guitar but he was a leader in the punk genre and allowed many of our leaders like mike ness, Joe strummer, and Joey Ramone to do what they did. Waylon Jennings died at the age of 64 after a long battle with diabetes."
