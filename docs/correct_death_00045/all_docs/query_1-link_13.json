        "text": "Beginnings With Buddy Holly\n\nWaylon Jennings rose from hardscrabble poverty in West Texas to become Buddy Holly’s bassist. Then, he went from Nashville rebel to Outlaw star.\n\nJennings escaped what he considered the futureless world of Littlefield, Texas, by working in radio in Lubbock, and by picking up the guitar. His big break came when Buddy Holly tapped Jennings to play bass in his new band on a tour through the Midwest in late 1958 and early 1959.\n\nIn an oft-told moment, Jennings gave up his seat on an ill-fated flight that would claim the lives of Holly, J. P. Richardson (“the Big Bopper”), and Ritchie Valens. After the crash, Jennings’s musical world crashed around him. Holly had been his mentor, producing his first record (“Jole Blon,” Brunswick, 1958), and Jennings felt responsible, because his last words to Holly had been the joking refrain, “I hope your ole plane crashes” (in response to Holly’s “I hope your damned bus freezes up again”).\n\nFrom West Texas to Phoenix to Nashville\n\nIt took Jennings years to regain some career equilibrium. He first went back to radio in West Texas, then began performing again, ending up at a bar in Phoenix, Arizona, called J. D.’s. Jennings became a local celebrity there, and when Nashville performer Bobby Bare passed through Phoenix and heard Jennings, Bare headed for a pay phone to tell his producer, Chet Atkins at RCA in Nashville, about this raw young talent out in Arizona.\n\nJennings had already cut some songs in the country-folk vein for then-fledgling A&M Records in Los Angeles, but A&M demurred to Atkins, who signed Jennings to RCA. The singer’s first session for RCA took place on March 16, 1965.\n\nJennings moved to Nashville and, by sheer chance, became roommates with Johnny Cash; the pair soon cemented their legends as hellraisers. Jennings starred in the 1966 movie Nashville Rebel, scored Top Ten hits with songs such as “The Chokin’ Kind” (#8, 1967) and “Only Daddy That’ll Walk the Line” (#2, 1968), and his 1969 collaboration with the Kimberlys on “MacArthur Park” won a Grammy.\n\nBut Jennings chafed under RCA’s tight rein, and at one point he also took a dramatic stand against the status quo: when Chet Atkins turned him over to staff producer Danny Davis, Jennings pulled out a pistol in the studio to protest Davis’s practice of what Jennings felt was studio bullying.\n\nBecoming an Outlaw\n\nBy the early 1970s, Jennings was getting frozen out of country’s mainstream. He retaliated by hiring jazz musician Miles Davis’s maverick manager from New York City, who put him into such high-profile venues as the rock-retro Max’s Kansas City in New York. Gradually, Jennings began to win his war in the studio: he stayed true to his musical instincts and recorded a gallery of landmark recordings, most notably the 1973 albums Lonesome, On’ry and Mean and Honky Tonk Heroes. He also staged an alternative show at the 1973 Disc Jockey Convention in Nashville, with Willie Nelson, Troy Seals, and Sammi Smith joining him in an Outlaw program.\n\nJennings was dubbed an Outlaw in Nashville for demanding, and eventually getting, what rock groups had been used to having for years—namely, the right to record the material he wanted, in the studio he wanted, and with the musicians he wanted to use. (His friend Nelson won his own independence by moving back to Texas and recording there.) It was, as Jennings later said, a simple matter of artistic freedom.\n\nJennings was named the Country Music Association’s Male Vocalist of the Year in 1975, but what finally won the battle for Jennings and the Outlaws was the ultimate weapon in corporate wars: sales. Wanted! The Outlaws, an RCA package of songs by Jennings, Nelson, Jennings’s wife Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser, was released in January 1976, with only Jennings’s name credited on the album spine (since he was the only one of the four artists still under contract to RCA). The album flew out of record stores and soon became the first album in country music history to be certified platinum, signifying sales of one million copies. The Jennings-Nelson duet “Good Hearted Woman” became a major crossover hit in 1976, as did Jennings’s “Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)” the following year. Wanted! The Outlaws won the CMA’s Album of the Year award, “Good Hearted Woman” was named CMA Single of the Year, and Jennings and Nelson earned the CMA Duo of the Year honor.\n\nJennings and Nelson also won a Best Country Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group Grammy for their 1978 hit “Mamas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys.” Forever linked as “Waylon and Willie,” they began selling records in numbers previously associated with rock album sales, and the Nashville system gradually moved away from a producer-dominated order to one in which the artist shares power."
