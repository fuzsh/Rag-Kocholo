        "text": "1937-2002\n\nBorn on June 15,1937,in Littlefield,Texas. He grew up a child of hard West Texas poverty. As a youngster Waylon learned guitar from his mother and by age 12 he had formed his own band. After years of picking cotten,he moved to Lubbock and met Buddy Holly. Waylon played in Holly's band from 1958-1959.Holly produced Waylon's first record and used him as a bass player.It was Waylon who gave up his seat to the Big Bopper on the plane that would crash,killing Holly and Richie Valens as well. Waylon was greatly affected by Buddy's death.He moved to Phoenix and released some records and gained a following,headlining at a club JD's. Bobby Bare helped Waylon get signed by Chet Atkins at RCA.By 1965 Waylon had moved to Nashville and wound up rooming with Johnny Cash. A relationship that helped earn his reputation as a hell raiser and a formed a friendship that would last 35 years.Waylon earned chart success with songs like his Top-3 hit\"Only Daddy That'll Walk The Line\" But he was growing unhappy with the Nashville bureaucracy and thought about quitting the music business.Instead Waylon fueled a rebellion that changed Nashville and the entire course of country music and the Outlaw movement was born. By 1972 Waylon had done the impossible.He retained complete control of his music. Waylon began to use his band in the studio instead of Nashville studio musicians. He also began a partnership with Willie Nelson. That year thier first Top-10 collaborative effort \"Good Hearted Woman\" was released From 1977 through 1983 Waylon simply could do no wrong and his records simply bore the name \"Waylon\"In the mid-1980's he joined with Nelson, Cash, and Kris Kristofferson to form the \"Highwaymen,which recorded and did concert tours.Waylon spent 21 years on drugs and had a $1,500-a-day cocaine habit. He kicked the habit in 1984.Waylon was married 4 times.He married Jess Colter in 1969 and they had one son Shooter . Waylon had seven children from his marriages.After years of hard living,Waylon's health began to decline. On Feb 13,2002 Waylon Jennings died peacefully in his sleep at his Arizona home after a long battle with diabetes related health problems.
