        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Waylon Jennings, who defined the outlaw movement in country music, died yesterday after a long battle with diabetes-related health problems. He was 64.\n\nJennings spokeswoman Schatzie Hageman said Jennings died peacefully at his home in Arizona.\n\nJennings, a singer, songwriter and guitarist, recorded 60 albums and had 16 No. — country singles in a career that spanned five decades and began when he played bass for Buddy Holly. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in October.\n\nHe had been plagued with diabetes-related health problems in recent years that made it difficult for him to walk. In December, his left foot was amputated at a Phoenix hospital.\n\nJennings and his wife, singer Jessi Colter, sold their home in Nashville more than a year ago and moved to Chandler, Ariz.\n\nIn 1959, his career was nearly cut short by tragedy soon after it began.\n\nHe was scheduled to fly on the light plane that crashed and killed Holly, Ritchie Valens and The Big Bopper. Jennings gave up his seat on the plane to the Big Bopper, who was ill and wanted to fly rather than travel by bus with those left behind.\n\nWith pal Willie Nelson, Jennings performed duets like \"Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys,\" \"Luckenbach\" and \"Good Hearted Woman.\" Those 1970s songs nurtured a progressive sound and restless spirit embraced later by Travis Tritt, Charlie Daniels, Steve Earle and others.\n\nHe traditionally wore a black cowboy hat and ebony attire that accented his black beard and mustache. Often reclusive when not on stage, he played earthy music with a spirited, hard edge. Combined, Jennings had a well-defined image that matched well with his history of battling record producers to do music his way.\n\nAbout his independence, he said: \"There's always one more way to do something - your way.\"\n\nSome of his album titles nourished his brash persona: \"Lonesome, On'r Mean,\" \"I've Always Been Crazy,\" \"Nashville Rebel,\" \"Ladies Love Outlaws\" and \"Wanted: The Outlaws.\"\n\nHe often refused to attend music awards shows on grounds performers should not compete against each other. Despite those sentiments, Jennings won two Grammy awards and four Country Music Association awards. He did not attend his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame last year.\n\nFor about 10 years, he declined to appear on the Grand Ole Opry because a full set of drums was forbidden at the time. That rule was eventually dropped.\n\nOf his outlaw image, he said: \"It was a good marketing tool. In a way, I am that way. You start messing with my music, I get mean. As long was you are honest and up front with me, I will be the same with you. But I still do things my way.\"\n\nBorn in Littlefield, Texas, Jennings became a radio disc jockey at 14 and formed his own band not long afterward.\n\nHe and Holly were teenage friends in Lubbock, Texas, and Jennings was in Holly's band.\n\nthe early 1960s Jennings was playing regularly at a nightclub in Phoenix. In 1963, he was signed by Herb Alpert's AM Records, then was signed by RCA in Nashville shortly thereafter by Chet Atkins. Once in Nashville, he and singer Johnny Cash became friends and roommates.\n\nHis hit records began in the mid-1960s and his heyday was the mid-1970s.\n\nHe made occasional forays into TV movies, including \"Stagecoach\" and \"Oklahoma City Dolls,\" plus the Sesame Street movie \"Follow That Bird\" and the B-movie \"Nashville Rebel.\"\n\nHe and Colter, his fourth wife, married in 1969. They had one son, Shooter."
