        "text": "In early August it was revealed that Guernsey’s Auctions out of New York City was preparing to auction off 2,000 items from the Waylon Jennings estate in Chandler, Arizona, with the proceeds going to the Phoenix Children’s Hospital. The items are being offered for sale by Waylon’s widow, Jessi Colter, who was married to Waylon for over 30 years. The auction is set to transpire on October 5th at the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix. Now even more details of the auction items have been revealed as the auction house has made a detailed auction guide available for pre-order.\n\nThe items will be made available for preview in Phoenix at the Musical Instrument Museum starting on October 3rd. Out of the 2,000 items, there will also be 500 lots, or groups of items that will be auctioned together. Telephone and online bidding will also be available.\n\nIncluded in the auction is a pair of ornate leather boots once worn by Hank Williams. There’s also an authentic set of Willie Nelson’s famous Indian braids given to Waylon in 1983 by his long-time Outlaw friend to celebrate Waylon’s newly-found sobriety. There’s also the original contract signed by Waylon that officially formed The Highwaymen supergroup with Willie, Kris Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash, and a letter to Waylon from John Lennon. There’s also a leather-clad Telecaster being sold (though not the main one Waylon played). But the crown jewel of the collection will be the Ariel Cyclone motorcycle previously owned by Buddy Holly, and given to Waylon Jennings as a birthday present in 1979 (read more).\n\nThough Waylon was originally from Littlefield, TX, his Phoenix history runs deep. Waylon got his start as a solo performer at JD’s in Phoenix. Owner Jimmy D. Musiel pattered his club around Waylon and his Waylors as the house band. Waylon’s Arizona estate in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler is where he spent much of his time, and where he passed away on February 13th, 2002.\n\nFor more information on the auction, visit www.guernseys.com.\n\nBraids Willie Nelson gave to Waylon after he found sobriety.\n\n“Storms Never Last” Bronze Bust\n\nWaylon’s Stage Chair\n\nWaylon’s Personal Rolex Submariner Watch\n\nPorsche Design Sunglasses & Case\n\nPorsche Design Sunglasses\n\nPartner Desk Given to Waylon by Johnny Cash in 1985\n\nOriginal contract forming the supergroup The Highwaymen.\n\nPhoto Display from the Music Row Museum\n\nMuhammad Ali’s Training Gloves\n\nMuhammad Ali’s Ring Robe Presented to Waylon Jennings by Ali in 1978\n\nLetter from John Lennon To Waylon\n\nOriginal Black Crayon Drawing of Johnny Cash by William Nelson\n\nHat Worn by Hank Williams Jr. During a Live Performance\n\nNomination Plaque for “Mamas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys”\n\nFender Custom Shop Waylon Jennings Telecaster\n\nWaylon’s Favorite Pair of Lucchese Boots\n\nEngraved ST Dupont Black Chinese Lacquer and Gold Lighter c. 1970s\n\nHank Williams’ Custom-made Nudie Cowboy Boots\n\nCostume Worn by Jennings in Sesame Street’s Follow That Bird\n\n“The Buddy Holly Days”\n\nBaume Mercier Watch\n\nNashville Rebel Poster with Autograph\n\nAutographed Nashville Rebel Poster WITH ORIGINAL SHARKEY’S POSTER\n\n1943 Martin Guitar 00021\n\nThe Highwayman Goes Gold"
