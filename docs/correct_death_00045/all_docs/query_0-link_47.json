He pioneered the Outlaw movement in country music.\n\nNamed Wayland at birth, his parents changed the spelling to \"Waylon\" when a pastor assumed they'd named him after Wayland Baptist University. (Apparently, they weren't very \"churchy\".) His mother taught him how to play guitar at age 8 and by age 14 he played his first professional gig. Although he was a high school dropout, he earned GED at age 52.\n\nHe was the first DJ hired at the radio station KLLL in Lubbock, Texas. That's how he was introduced to Buddy Holly in 1958.\n\nA bass player for Buddy Holly's band, he gave up his seat to the Big Bopper (J.P. RIchardson), on the fateful date (3 Feb 1959) of the plane crash in which Holly, Richardson & Ritchie Valens were killed.\n\nHe died of complications from diabetes on 13 Feb 2002.\n\nMarriages\n\nm: 1955 Maxine Lawrence\n\nm: 1962 Lynne Jones\n\nm: 1967 Barbara Elizabeth Rood\n\nm: 1969 Jessi Colter (with son, Shooter Jennings).\n\nAwards\n\nMember of the Country Music Hall of Fame\n\nACM Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award\n\nVideo Selections\n\nWurlitzer Prize (I Don't Want to Get Over You)\n\nBob Wills is Still the King\n\nOut Among the Stars\n\nDukes of Hazzard Theme Song\n\nSources\n\nBirth: \"Texas Birth Index, 1903-1997\", database, citing Texas Department of State Health Services, FamilySearch Record: VDML-PKY (accessed 7 May 2024), Waylon Arnold Jennings born on 15 Jun 1937, son of William Albert Jennings & Lorene Beatrice Shipley, in Lamb, Texas.\n\nMarriage Registration: \"Nevada Marriage Index, 1956-2005\", database, citing Page: C01, FamilySearch Record: VV1J-PW9 (accessed 7 May 2024), Waylon I Jennings marriage to Lynne G James on 10 Dec 1962 in Clark, Nevada, United States.\n\nMarriage Registration: \"Nevada Marriage Index, 1956-2005\", database, citing Page: A13, FamilySearch Record: VVV8-1ZM (accessed 7 May 2024), Waylon A Jennings marriage to Lynne G Jones on 10 Dec 1962 in Clark, Nevada, United States.\n\nDeath: \"United States Social Security Death Index\", database, citing U.S. Social Security Administration, Death Master File, database (Alexandria, Virginia: National Technical Information Service, ongoing), FamilySearch Record: V38P-MPF (accessed 7 May 2024), Waylon A Jennings death 13 Feb 2002 (born 15 Jun 1937).\n\nDeath: \"United States, Social Security Numerical Identification Files (NUMIDENT), 1936-2007\", database, citing Digital film/folder number: DI0001099, FamilySearch Record: 6K7J-ZXGV (accessed 7 May 2024), Waylon Arnold Jennings death 13 Feb 2002 (born 15 Jun 1937).\n\nFind a Grave, database and images (https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6179360/waylon-jennings: accessed 29 Apr 2024 ), memorial page for Waylon Jennings (15 Jun 1937â€“13 Feb 2002), Find A Grave: Memorial #6179360, citing City of Mesa Cemetery, Mesa, Maricopa County, Arizona, USA; Maintained by Find a Grave.\n\nBurial: \"BillionGraves Index\", database, citing BillionGraves (http://www.billiongraves.com : 2012), Burial at Mesa Cemetery, Mesa, Maricopa County, Arizona, United States, FamilySearch Record: QKN2-78K4 (accessed 7 May 2024) http://billiongraves.com/pages/record/person/16139761, Waylon Jennings burial (died on 13 Feb 2002) in Mesa, Maricopa County, Arizona, United States.
