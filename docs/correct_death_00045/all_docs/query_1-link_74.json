        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) – Waylon Jennings, who defined the outlaw movement in country music, died today after a long battle with diabetes-related health problems. He was 64. Jennings spokeswoman Schatzie Hageman said Jennings died peacefully at his home in Arizona. Jennings, a singer, songwriter and guitarist, recorded 60 albums and had 16 No. 1 country singles in a career that spanned five decades. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in October. He had been plagued with diabetes-related health problems in recent years that made it difficult for him to walk. In December, his left foot was amputated at a Phoenix hospital.\n\nMay God bless his soul. Wish he would meet the Big Bopper, Buddy and Ritchie at the much better place. They would make a great quartet there."
