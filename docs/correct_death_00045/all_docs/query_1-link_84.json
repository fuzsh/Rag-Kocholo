        "text": "US singer Waylon Jennings has died at the age of 64 after a glorious career as a country music star.\n\nHe was an influential and pioneering figure in the music business and helped to shape the image of country music.\n\nHe sold more than 40 million records world-wide, had 89 Billboard country chart hits, including 16 number one songs, and 53 top 10 hits.\n\nFamously, he missed the flight that killed his friend and mentor Buddy Holly in 1959.\n\nGive us your tributes to the star.\n\nYou will be sadly missed, could hold your head up with best. Will miss your music. My condolences to your family.\n\nAndy Dingsdale, England\n\nIt's a shock to country music fans everywhere - the news on Waylon had been encouraging since his surgery in December and he had seemed determined to recover quickly and get back to performing again. He'll be sadly missed.\n\nAngela, UK\n\nQue viva Waylon!\n\nRick, TX, USA\n\nAlthough I am not a big country fan, Waylon Jennings was an outstanding songwriter and singer. The music industry will feel the loss of his talent, as the thousands of fans around the world will too. God bless you Waylon, and thank you for the many years of great music. RIP.\n\nKim Kester, United States\n\nI grew up on the music of Waylon Jennings and admired him not only for his music but, as a man who wasn't afraid to stand up for what he believed in\n\nElizabeth Sahn, UK\n\nWaylon was a true great he will be sadly missed. He brought joy to millions throughout the world with his relaxed style and fantastic voice. Today is a very sad day for country music.\n\nDavid Spencer, England\n\nIt was with great sadness that I read of the death of Waylon Jennings. He was the original country outlaw and a true legend of country music. He was greatly respected and loved by fans and peers alike. I grew up on the music of Waylon Jennings and admired him not only for his music but, as a man who wasn't afraid to stand up for what he believed in. He revolutionised country music in the 70s, helping to bring greater artistic freedom for generations of singers to come. I've often lamented that there aren't more singers around today with Waylon's integrity. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him and his music. My thoughts are with Jessi and his family. God bless you Waylon.\n\nElizabeth Sahn, UK\n\nThat's a really awful thing to have to read this morning - God bless you Waylon.\n\nRay Clune, UK\n\nWaylon was truly one of the good ol' boys. His original singing style and unique guitar technique made his music stand out from many of the other \"blander\" country artists. He'll be greatly missed both in Milton Keynes and Hazard County.\n\nJP, Milton Keynes, UK\n\nMy Hero.......THE man..\"dark cloud hanging over me...\" in the words of one of his songs...so long Hoss....\n\nTed Muir, England\n\nHe was a real innovater and he changed country music for the better during his illustrious career\n\nJay Garcia, UK\n\nJust a good ole' boy , never meaning no harm ....\n\nDave Nightingale, England\n\nI have collected Waylon records since I was a child. The loss of this man leaves a hole in my heart.\n\nAllen Goodwin, UK\n\nWaylon Jennings was a true musical legend! I'll remember him for all his wonderful music over the years. He was a real innovater and he changed country music for the better during his illustrious career. Waylon's death is a sad loss for country music fans everywhere.\n\nJay Garcia, UK\n\nMy wife Bec and I listened to Waylon the first time we met, and during the birth of our first child. You will be in our hearts forever Waylon!\n\nPhillip McGriskin, England\n\nThe world's gone crazy and now we don't have our honky-tonk hero. My condolences to the family, friends and fans.\n\nTom Spreitzer, USA\n\nWe've lost so many of our dearly beloved ones in the past few years - Sun Ra, Jerry Garcia, Townes van Zandt, Lester Bowie, George Harrison. Now it's Waylon. Isn't \"The Taker/Tulsa\" one of the greatest American recordings of all times?! So let's all think of Billy Joe Shaver and Johnny Cash and wish them luck!\n\nJuergen Petzoldt, Germany\n\nI grew up watching The Dukes of Hazzard and for that alone I owe the guy a big thank you\n\nAndy, UK\n\nYou will be sorely missed by C&W lovers worldwide.\n\nRosalind Priest, Belgium\n\nPart of me has always liked Country & Western Music. I was introduced to the music of Waylon Jennings back in the sixties. I have a collection of his music and will remember him and his great songs with nostalgia. A great loss to the music industry and for his many fans.\n\nAnna Dance, England\n\nToday cannot be a good day - goodbye Waylon...\n\nTrym Staal Eggen, Norway\n\nI have been a fan of Waylon since I was about 10-years-old. My family and I went to see a movie Waylon performed in. I believe the title was called \"Green River\". If I can remember correctly, there was a song called Green River also and it was about a girl named Molly. I would love to be able to watch that movie again. We also used to have the album from that movie. But through the years it got misplaced. I saw Waylon for the first time in concert around 1969. I was 9-years-old. I actually talked to him and I'll never forget what he asked me...are you married??? Waylon, your music will forever be in my heart and soul...you were talented and one of the best!!\n\nSue Eades, USA\n\nYet another hero gone. There's just no more like him coming along. Thanks Waylon.\n\nDavid L Dala, UK\n\nWaylon was for real - a true outlaw!\n\nLyn Hughes-Evans, Wales\n\nI grew up watching The Dukes of Hazzard and for that alone I owe the guy a big thank you. He had a great personality and sense of fun and his music legacy will speak for itself.\n\nAndy, UK\n\nThe original honky tonk hero. I miss him already.\n\nLinda, USA\n\nThat a man like you has died is a true travesty. Wayne, you will always be in my heart and songs of yours such as the seminal Only Daddy That'll Walk The Line will always be in my head. Thanks for the good times.\n\nHenry O'Sullivan, England\n\nThanks for the great music. A sad day for music fans. My sympathy to Waylon's family.\n\nDonna Trammell, USA\n\nWaylon and I shared a passion... he and I both loved to entertain \"the kids\". You were the King, I could never take your crown. You will be sorely missed.\n\nChristopher Bettany, London, England\n\nWaylon was for real - a true outlaw! That's what real country singers are made of. He lived by his music! R.I.P.\n\nLyn Hughes-Evans, Wales\n\nThanks for the great music Hoss, I will play one of your concert videos tonight in my bar and raise a sad glass to you\n\nReg Fairfoot, Crete\n\nWaylon is an eagle soaring above us all. God bless.\n\nOlly Smith, UK\n\nHe was one of the greatest there ever has been and will always be one of the best. Yeeeha Waylon!\n\nDiablo del Huggins, Stroud\n\nEverytime I put on my cowboy boots and chaps I'll think of my honky tonk hero. RIP Waylon and thanks for the good times. God Bless.\n\nPaul Higgins, Liverpool, England\n\nSomeday the mountain might get 'im but the law never will\n\nPeter Reavy, N. Ireland\n\nThough not a huge C/W fan myself, I will mourn the loss of the Dukes of Hazzard's 'Balladeer'. RIP.\n\nDavid Wakefield, UK\n\nI grew up listening to Waylon in Canada as my Dad was a huge fan! We'll miss him dearly.\n\nJulie Ede, Camberley, Surrey\n\nMamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys, but please let them grow up to what Waylon became. Thanks for the great music Hoss, I will play one of your concert videos tonight in my bar and raise a sad glass to you. God Bless.\n\nReg Fairfoot, Crete, Greece\n\nFirst John Lee Hooker, then Chet Atkins, now Waylon Jennings. It's been a terrible last twelve months\n\nAlan Green, Germany\n\nGone, Waylon, but you will never be forgotten. Your songs saw me though so many of my formative years. Long may you be remembered with affection. My thoughts are with your family.\n\nChristina Bryan, United Kingdom\n\nI saw Waylon on his last concert tour. I knew then that he was really sick. Condolences to Jessi & Shooter. He was the greatest.\n\nChris Epps, USA\n\nSorry to see you go, Hoss. The world is worse off with one less gentle man who revelled in being an outlaw.\n\nDon Truitt, USA\n\nFirst John Lee Hooker, then Chet Atkins, now Waylon Jennings. It's been a terrible last twelve months. The world is a sad and lonely place without them.\n\nAlan Green, Germany\n\nEven in Africa we loved your songs, may you rest in peace.\n\nLiku Z., Ethiopia\n\nWaylon, you were a legend in your time from the early days as a DJ in Lubbock to the RCA years. What a man - glad to have seen you at Wembley as part of the Highway Men. Best wishes to Jessie from myself and all the other Waylon fans as well as all the members of the Buddy Holly Fan Club here in the UK.\n\nSue Woodham, UK\n\nYou always manged to cheer me up. God Bless!\n\nRon Barnbrook, England\n\nI used to impress the chicks with my one armed pressups to Waylon's bong bong tunes. Rock on in my heart, legend.\n\nAndy Clark, Acton, London\n\nI got in the car after work yesterday and turned on the radio which was playing \"Mama Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to be Cowboys.\" When I heard that, I knew he had died. Country radio never plays Waylon anymore, even though he continues to record new albums. All evening and this morning they were playing his songs. On top of all the sadness, I mainly feel mad that he had to die to get his songs on the radio.\n\nPat Hoover, USA\n\nIt is a little known fact that Waylon was actually born in Wales, his mother was a VERY good friend of my father. Loved your work, loved your life, and your sheepfarming methods were revolutionary.\n\nStuart Anthony, England\n\nI can't believe that it has all \"come so quickly\". It seems only \"two seconds\" ago that I was rocking back and forth to your tunes. Now, \"two strokes\" later, you're gone. The story of my life. You will be missed.\n\nTim Johnstone, UK\n\nA great singer! A sad day!\n\nBerit Grini, Norway\n\nHis songs brought my father and my brothers and myself closer\n\nJimmy, South Africa\n\nWaylon - your tune \"My Rust Coloured Wig\" is something I whistle on the way to work every morning. It's just as well I am unemployed! Live the life, and I'm off to see your wife.\n\nChristian Pearce, London, UK\n\nI'll miss you Waylon, No more Waylon and Willie, that is unthinkable. You always manged to cheer me up. God Bless!\n\nRon Barnbrook, England\n\nThank you for all your songs. Will miss you so much. All the best to Jessi and the family.\n\nTorsten Widlitzki, Germany\n\nI was saddened to hear of the passing of Waylon Jennings. Growing up in rural Texas, we admired and respected Waylon for his music and for being an everyman, who in spite of his success, remembered and valued the quiet basics of life, love of family and friends, which could be found in a place like Luckenbach, Texas. I, Willie, and the rest of the boys, will miss him.\n\nJuan, USA\n\nHis songs brought my father and my brothers and myself closer....a truly sad day...condolences to his friends and family.......'Mammas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys....'\n\nJimmy, South Africa\n\nAww, that's a shame. We just started getting Dukes of Hazzard re-runs here. I love that man.\n\nSutter, South Africa\n\nI have listened to his music since I was 15-years-old and I am now 52 years. You will be missed, dear old friend\n\nAlonso Jasso, New Mexico, US\n\nYou could have the best of both worlds with Waylon - an outlaw with the artistic spirit of a true gentleman.\n\nRobert del Valle, USA\n\nI grew up in Phoenix (early 60s) when Waylon was playing the bars and he had songs on the radio, local hits. His best song is Four Strong Winds with Herb Alpert on trumpet. I will miss his honest music very much.\n\nGilbert Satchell, USA\n\nA \"real man\" in country music has left us...I will always cherish those great songs from the 70s & early 80s.\n\nDavid Britton, USA\n\nI saw Waylon with the Highway Men in 1991 at Lakeside Rodeo grounds. A great time was had by all.\n\nSteve, USA\n\nWaylon, I know you're up there in digital heaven reading these messages but your music truly inspired me to become the man I am today. You touched my heart with your with your oh so beautiful lyrics. To all those at the Notting Hill Line Dancing association, as a mark of respect tonight's party will be a celebration of Waylon's life. We will be having a 'Waylon looky - likey' competition - the winner will receive a signed photo of the man himself. Peace and love to you all.\n\nBill, UK\n\nIt was just Tuesday afternoon that we drove through his little West Texas town of Littlefield with the faded signs at the city limits proclaiming it \"Hometown of Waylon Jennings\" and I thought about him living there as a child before leaving it for Lubbock and all that was to come. I have listened to his music since I was 15-years-old and I am now 52 years. You will be missed, dear old friend.\n\nAlonso Jasso, New Mexico, USA\n\nWaylon was the original outlaw country singer, combining traditional country with a little rock attitude\n\nJames Brooks, USA\n\nMy favourite Highwayman song is \"The Last Cowboy Song\", and as the last line of the chorus says, \"Another piece of America's gone.\" You'll be missed by us all, Waylon. God bless you, and may you rest in eternal peace.\n\nHammond Quaince, England\n\nWe have lost a true country legend. I adore Waylon's music, especially the wonderful work he recorded with Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson, collectively known as the Highwaymen. My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of Waylon Jennings. He will be dearly missed by all country music fans.\n\nJason Moran, England\n\nI loved his music. He was the outlaw, he paved the way for other singers and songwriters to do what they feel in their heart is right and to hell what the recordd company thinks! He was a genius and even though I never saw him in concert he sure put a smile on my face everytime I listened to one of his songs! I was so happy that he was inducted into the country music hall of fame last year, what a great tribute to a living legend! Thanks Hoss for standing up for what you believed in, many great memories and fantastic songs! You will be sorely missed!\n\nSandra Beasley, US\n\nThe current crop of country music artists should go out and buy some of his records, and learn something about songwriting. Waylon was the original outlaw country singer, combining traditional country with a little rock attitude.\n\nJames Brooks, USA\n\nWaylon! We'll miss you bud. Cold beer and your music! Nothin' finer!\n\nPhilip, Georgia, USA\n\nHopefully you/re in a place where \"ain't nobody feelin' no pain.\" I almost cried when I read the news. You will be sorely missed.\n\nEJ, UK\n\nMaybe it's time we got back to the basics of life. Thanks for the songs!\n\nTansy and Ceej, Gabon\n\nWhat a guy. What a voice, what a slice of americana. Our culture is poorer yet now. My thoughts are with Jessi Colter and her son, and Willie too.\n\nMatthew Tabaka, USA\n\nToday will never be just another day.\n\nGraham, Scotland\n\nHow can we not feel sad that the guy who called one of his records \"Too Dumb For New York City, Too Ugly For L.A.\" is no longer with us?\n\nIain Cash, France\n\nWaylon! We'll miss you bud. Cold beer and your music! Nothin' finer!\n\nPhilip, Georgia, USA\n\nYour music has helped me through some rough times\n\nVivien Murch, New Zealand\n\nHe may be gone, but he lives on in the \"Waylon Jennings Bus Shower\".\n\nJoe Whiteley, UK\n\nIt don't matter who's in Texas, Waylon's still the king!\n\nJeffrey Smith, USA\n\nThis is a sad day! Waylon was one of four wheels on a car of what will be country music.\n\nSvein Inge Olsen, Norway\n\nWhen Program Director for country KSAY, San Francisco in the 50s and 60s, Waylon Jenning's records were a must! I'll never forget \"Anita You're Dreaming,\" seldom mentioned to-day, but one I'll never forget!! We'll never forget you Waylon. Never!!\n\nWoody Woodward, USA\n\nOne of my great heroes is gone. I'm both sad and angry, sad because Waylon one of a kind and I'll miss him, thank god that we still have his music. I'm angry because the newspapers in my country thinks it is more important that Britney Spears will do another movie than that Waylon a true hero and legend has passed away.That really sucks doesn't it..? Rock on Waylon and R.I.P.\n\nDavid, Sweden\n\nThank you Waylon for all the wonderful music you have made over the years. Your music has helped me through some rough times and I will always enjoy your music. To your family and friends, my thoughts are with you all at this sad time, keep his memory alive and warm in your hearts.\n\nVivien Murch, New Zealand\n\nLike all the greats, he died too young. More than his music, Waylon was just an incredibly nice and sweet person\n\nJd Shine, USA\n\nYou came to Oz in 1990 with Highwaymen. All four of you represent the classic Aussie . Since I saw you I have listened to your music and read your history . I salute you Waylon. The modern country scene you hated so much is a disgrace to music. Rock'n'Roll on Waylon ..and as we say over here, tell 'em to get stuffed.\n\nNigel, Australia\n\nI am from Adelaide, Australia and it has been my pleasure to see, Waylon live three times.\n\nI also have the pleasure of having a Road Show Poster personally, signed by \"Waylon & Willy and The Boys\" on their last tour - \"The Road Goes On Forever\".\n\nHe will be missed by many in Australia.\n\nJeff, Australia\n\nWaylon Jennings is infamous and will be remembered forever by those of us growing up in the 80s who's Saturday evenings were spent watching the Dukes of Hazzard and listening to his fab country voice. He may be gone but he will not be forgotten.\n\nBekki, UK\n\nThanks for all the long, lonely nights you helped to fill with your songs. You were the \"real thing\"....a man who lived life on his own terms and had the heart and soul of a gentleman. We'll miss you and keep on singing your songs. Goodbye, you handsome wild man. Our condolences to Jessi and Shooter. They had the best.\n\nJo Ann, USA/Phoenix AZ\n\nWell, Buddy has his bass player back - it's really true - if there's a heaven, they got a hell of a band\n\nBob, USA\n\nIt is nice to see the nice comments from all the continents about Waylon. Like all the greats, he died too young. More than his music, Waylon was just an incredibly nice and sweet person. Last year at this time I was mourning the death of Billy Joe Shaver's son Eddie, who had a promising career ahead of him. So many great ones have passed this last year.\n\nJd Shine, USA\n\nOn the day the world puts me down In that empty space in the ground I know, that if I make a sound She'll come runnin'.\n\nHe's up there jammin' with Buddy and Patsy now.\n\nMichelle Clarke, UK\n\nI've been a fan of Waylon's since the Nashville Rebel Days. He was truly unique in his style, and will be lovingly remembered for many years to come.\n\nKaren Spencer, England\n\nWaylon, you will be missed by all the country, listen, I love your music. I got some of your old stuff from the 70s and 80s.\n\nGeneva Soard, USA\n\nIt's hard to type through the tears. Great songs, great music, great man. Devastated.\n\nJoe Kilroy, Stockport,UK\n\nUncompromising, unapologetic, unpretentious...the best voice in the bunch\n\nNeely, Texas\n\nWell, Buddy has his bass player back - it's really true - if there's a heaven, they got a hell of a band. Maybe the finest combination of heart-felt singing and ethereal guitar picking was Waylon singing Buddy Holly's (unfinished) song, \"Learning the Game\" with Mark Knopfler playing the most haunting guitar you'll ever hear on the Buddy Holly Tribute Album. Two of the biggest influences in American music are gone...Buddy and Waylon...both true to their music and to themselves - and there's nobody coming along who's remotely close to their artistry. God Bless Jessi and Shooter.\n\nBob, USA\n\nGoodbye Waylon, say hi to Elvis for us!\n\nGreg, USA\n\nI feel fortunate to have seen the one and only reunion of the original Outlaws at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Denver, Colorado. This took place in the summer of, and I'm guessing a little here, of 1976. Waylon was added at the last minute due to a cancellation. Tom Paul, Willie, Jessie and all of the originals happened to be in the same place at the same time. Willie and Waylon made peace with each other and the evening finished with a set that was truly awesome. It was a magical night that I'll always remember.\n\nDale, USA\n\nAmanda Light of My Life will never be the same sung by anyone else. You'll be sadly missed\n\nTed Moore, UK\n\nA wonderful talent and a true country legend. Waylon's music has given me so much pleasure. The world has lost a truly unique performer.\n\nPeter Bettany, UK\n\nHe rode the storm and his music will long outlive the pap produced today\n\nCarole O'Callaghan, UK\n\nA legendary Texan, gone. There just aren't many like him left...\n\nAnastasia, USA\n\nMy hero has always been Waylon. The outlaw has gone the way of old five and dimers. Missing him already\n\nJohn Lowe, England\n\nUncompromising, unapologetic, unpretentious...the best voice in the bunch...sure will miss you, old pardner.\n\nNeely, Texas\n\nDavid Allen Coe sang about Willie, Waylon and me, as being the outlaws of Texas. His days with the Countryman and his solo career have placed him in high regard, he will be sadly missed.\n\nRhoda, Australia\n\nI had a 100 minute tape of my favorite Waylon songs in my pick-up for years. That tape must have had 2000 hours on it before it got stolen.\n\nRoy Markell, USA\n\nLet's all celebrate the 43 years of briliant music he has given, because he never took a plane in '59'.\n\nChas Tidswell, UK\n\nWaylon was a truly great innovator and turned country music on its heels. He rode the storm and his music will long outlive the pap produced today. Rest in peace Waylon; \"Living Legends are a Dying Breed\".\n\nCarole O'Callaghan, England\n\nWaylon, I love you and will miss you. Hats off to a country music brother. Someday the mountain may get you, but the law never will.\n\nGay Crossland, England\n\n\"Perhaps I may become a simple drop of rain, but I will still remain, and I'll be back again.\" Waylon, the highway man, will always live in our memories.\n\nRonald, US\n\nI am shocked and saddened to hear 'ol Waylon is dead. I have listened to his music since I was a young child and he is still my number one choice! His music will always live on...Rest in Peace Waylon.\n\nCaroline, Birmingham, UK\n\nYou will be sadly missed. You are a true country legend. god bless. I love you\n\nNoel Speake, Wales\n\nI used to work for a well known Hi-Fi company, and we used to use Waylon as one of our engineering test CDs.\n\nChris Cowdery, UK\n\nI always used to enjoy a good strum to the tunes of Waylon. Sadly, my strumming sessions will never be the same again.\n\nPaul Gunner, England\n\nWaylon was a magical one off. His songs could move me to tears and then five minutes later he could have me howling with laughter. A wonderful performer and lovely man, Waylon will always have a special place in my heart. My love and sympathy go out to Jessi and to all of Waylon's extended family.\n\nLynn Nicholls, England\n\nWill really miss Waylon Have listened to him since I was very young, my heart goes out to Jessi, love her too. My prayers for the family are sent out. Thank you Waylon for a job well done and for always being so plain spoken...that was one thing special I liked about you.\n\nWanda, United States\n\nWe lost not only a great musician, we lost a part of what country music stands for. Legends like him do not come our way very often. I'm really going to miss him. We are running out of the few good old boys that are still here with us.\n\nK.C. Valdovinos, Wisconsin, USA\n\nYou were the modern day Hank Williams as described by Bocephus himself and I know you'd wear that badge with pride. My unending loyalty to your memory for your support and when I was fighting \"My Own Devils\" I will always include your \"Dreaming My Dreams\" in my own show in your memory, Hoss' in the words of Hank Sr. \"No one will ever know, how much I (we) Love You\" G'night Jesse and we'll hold his memory close ... Together. The Springburn Cowboy\"\n\nJimmy Reid, Canada\n\nWaylon could sing the phone book and make it sound sad and lonely. He had a great career that stood for what he believed in, he was an unbelievable songwriter in his own right, and he could pick the best songs from other writers. Waylon did great work that connected with a vast and varied array of people - musicians and regular folks alike.\n\nBecky Westbrook, Texas\n\nYour songs, everything about you, will be missed. Jessi and all you kids, I send my comdolences.\n\nKaron, USA\n\nThe sadness I felt when I heard Waylon Jennings had expired was as if I had lost a family member. His voice was so unique and such a nice person, you could see the love glowing around him when he would look at Jessi. She was fortunate and blessed to have him as her mate for so many years.\n\nI send you and your son my deepest sympathy to you Jessi, as I know your sadness must be tremendous. God bless you and help you through this terrible time. PS I wish you could e-mail me but I know that is not possible. He (Waylon) is like a flower, blown like the wind and the earth shall see him no more.\n\nMarie Betancourt, Texas, USA\n\nWaylon was a wonderful man and so nice. He shall be greatly missed. We had the honor of meeting Waylon and Jessie, he was such a kind man to our grandson. Jessie is absolutely beautiful and my heart goes out to her. I know how hard losing Waylon is to her. They were a beautiful pair together and may he rest in peace. He shall not be replaced on the entertainment place, there will be no one that can ever again fill his shoes. My heart and thoughts are with you and your son at this time Jessie. God Bless.\n\nJaci, USA\n\nOne of my favorite songs was \"Good Hearted Woman\". Waylon was a great guitar picker and always had a good band. He seemed to be a simple man and enjoyed doing things his way.... been travelling these highways and doing things my way...Waylon will be greatly missed..see you when I get there.\n\nCharlie Wilson, USA\n\nYou are a true legend in country music gone but never forgotten. Rest in peace.\n\nRichard Kealy, Ireland\n\nThe voice grew better the older he became. We still have the records. \"Nashville is rough on the living\" but the fans always loved him. Thoughts for Jessie and the family.\n\nEddie, UK\n\nI was really sad when I heard about Waylon's death, put a disk on my player, heard his voice and wish him the best to cross the heaven highways.\n\nRuth Gensicke, Germany\n\nWaylon..a little bit of me died with you. You have been a wonderful part of my life for 25 or more years. All my condolences to Jessi and all of his family. To all of us who loved the man and his music it`s a sad, sad goodbye. Heaven is a richer place already.\n\nAnita Coombes, Wales\n\nWaylon and Buddy, together again on the stage.\n\nPhil Davies, Wales\n\nI can't believe Waylon is gone! I've enjoyed his music, his honesty, his sense of humour. I'm probably the biggest Kris Kristofferson fan there is and I know that Kris had a lot of respect for Waylon. It made me appreciate Waylon just a little more. My heart goes out to Jesse and Shooter.\n\nLouise Lelievre, Canada\n\nThe man will never be forgotten... not in my heart's collection of great music. Wake up BBC and start playing some of his work on TV (we're sick to the back teeth with pop idols - 'course that's where the money lies!) May God somehow ease Jessi's pain.\n\nRaymond Wright, Northern Ireland\n\nWaylon was the greatest country singer we will ever have. He was a true outlaw. Always stuck to his guns 100%. Hoss you will be sadly missed, but you will NEVER be forgotten!\n\nSharon Gaffin, USA\n\nHe was truly a great artist and performer and will be missed greatly among his fans. Not many know that we could of lost him forever back in 1959 when he gave up his airplane seat to the Big Bopper who had the flu. That is the same flight that Buddy Holly, Big Bopper and Richie Valens lost their lives on, that stormy winter night.\n\nMarty, USA\n\nWaylon Jennings was an awesome man and especially when him and Willie were singing together. We sure will miss this one.\n\nTeri Burnette, United States\n\nSweet dreams, Hoss. I first got into music because of Waylon. He led me to other great artists from Hank Jr to Lynyrd Skynyrd, but Waylon'll always be the man. As one of his many duets with Willie said; \"There ain't nothing quite as sad as seeing your heroes die\". God bless you Waylon - I'll remember you till the end of my days.\n\nKieran Keegan, UK"
