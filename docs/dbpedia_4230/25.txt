Andrew "Andy" Roberts

(born 12 June 1946, Harrow, Middlesex) is an English musician.

He has played with The Liverpool Scene, Plainsong, The Scaffold, Roy Harper, Chris Spedding, Pink Floyd, Hank Wangford, Kevin Ayers, Vivian Stanshall and Grimms. He has also done many sessions for artists such as Richard Thompson, Paul Korda, and Maddy Prior, and has been a musical partner to Iain Matthews for 30 years.

Andy was a part of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band for a while.

He has also written film scores, themes for TV series, backed Billy Connolly, provided music and voice for Spitting Image and continues to create musical backdrops for the poetry of Roger McGough.

His great solo albums are "Homegrown", & "Nina and the Dream Tree"....his masterpiece.

And of course appearing on a favorite album of mine and yours...Plainsong's "In Search Of Amelia Earhart".

I finally found this beauty from Andy's "Nina & The Dream Tree"....there is a bit of Floyd here. I can see why they recruited Andy for the WALL tour.

A fine talent!
