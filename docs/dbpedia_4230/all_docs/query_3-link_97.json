Kusal Mendis (59) took Sri Lanka to a fighting total of 248 for 7.\r\nIndia never built any momentum losing their two most experienced batsmen in skipper Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli early. India folded for a disappointing 138 in 26.1 overs after Wellalage spun his magic.\r\nSri Lanka 248 for 7 (Avishka 96, Mendis 59, Parag 3-54) beat India 138 (Rohit 35, Wellalage 5-27) by 110 runs.\r\nAug 2024.",
