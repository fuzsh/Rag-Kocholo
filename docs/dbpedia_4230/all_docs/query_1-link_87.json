        "text": "A summary of his CV reads like a 'Who's Who' of contemporary music. Apart from the ground breaking Liverpool Scene, Plainsong, and an extremely productive solo career, Andy has played with The Scaffold, Roy Harper, Pink Floyd, Hank Wangford, Kevin Ayers, Grimms, done countless sessions for artists such as Richard Thompson, Maddy Prior and of course been a musical partner to Iain Matthews over a period of 30 years. He has written film scores, themes for TV series, backed Billy Connolly, provided music and voice for Spitting Image and continues to create musical backdrops for the poetry of Roger McGough."
