        "text": "Councillor Andy Roberts, who has represented Warndon Parish South on Worcester City Council for 17 years, has died peacefully at his home, aged 74.\n\nDescribed as kind and generous of spirit, Cllr Roberts was the Deputy Mayor of Worcester in 2008-9 and then Mayor in 2009-10.\n\nA member of the Conservative Party, he was first elected to Worcester City Council in 2006 and between 2010 and 2016 held a range of Cabinet positions, including Performance, Innovation and Efficiency; Delivering Value for Money; and Clean, Green and Safe City.\n\nDuring his time on the City Council he also served as Chair of the Licensing Committee, Chair of the Audit Committee and Vice-Chair of the Standards Committee.\n\nAndy Roberts had a keen interest in local history and his chosen theme during his year as the city's Mayor was promoting Worcester's involvement in the birth of democracy.\n\nCllr James Stanley, Leader of the Conservative group on Worcester City Council, said:\"The news of the passing of my friend and colleague Cllr Andy Roberts has come as an enormous shock to me and I'm sure to all members of Worcester City Council.\n\n\"Andy was a man whose kindness, generosity of spirit and wisdom knew no bounds and, in a world where old fashioned common sense is occasionally at a premium, his leaving us will be felt by all those who had the pleasure of meeting him.\n\n\"Moreover, Andy was a tireless advocate for those suffering through illness and particularly vulnerable young people and it was, I hope, a source of comfort to him and his family that lives have been genuinely taken forward as a result of his work.\n\n\"Whatever he did in life was undertaken with passion and good humour and we will all miss him deeply.\"\n\nAndy Roberts spent 37 years working with the Hereford and Worcester Fire Service, reaching the rank of Assistant Chief Fire Officer before his retirement. He was also a Worcestershire County Councillor for two decades.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Frances, whom he married in 1974, their two children, Wayne and Victoria, and granddaughter Kim."
