        "text": "Author, Andy Roberts, Surety Account Executive, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nRetention is a very common practice within the construction industry that typically involves 5-10% of each payment to the subcontractor being withheld until the project has been completed. The purpose behind this is simple, it is designed to make sure that subcontractors satisfy their contractual agreements before they receive their last payment for the work they have done. While this practice serves a real purpose, it can cause significant issues for subcontractors if the payments are delayed.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nObtaining bonding for public works projects can be a complex process but understanding what bonds are, why they are required, and what information the bond company needs can take a lot of the mystery out of the process and make it seem a lot less daunting.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nOver the past two years, there has been a lot of talk about a looming recession. If a recession happens, its severity remains to be seen, but regardless, it is important for contractors to be taking an active approach in building their relationship with their bond company and utilizing the services of a surety specific agent.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nIn my previous article and podcast, “Surety Industry Forced to Innovate,” I discussed a few technological advancements within the surety industry and how the ultimate goal would be issuing bonds to obligees digitally. While that is still some ways off, the technology is here and there are companies and organizations already exploring how blockchain technology may be the answer when it comes to fully digitalizing the surety industry.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety Group, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nRarely are the words surety and technology advancement synonymous, and that’s because it’s hard to introduce advancements to an industry where so many obligees still require raised seals and wet signatures on the bonds they are receiving. However, due to some challenges that bond companies, insurance agencies and obligees have faced during the pandemic, the industry is being forced to innovate.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety Group, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nWith the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, there is $125 billion of federal funds available for procurement. This provides a significant amount of federal construction work which will be put out to bid, with a vast majority of it requiring bonding.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety Group, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nAs a contractor looking to qualify for a contract surety bond program, your team should be aware that company financial statements will be required by underwriters in most cases. This is largely due to the fact that a company’s financials, their balance sheet and an income statement, represent the primary source of information that a surety will use when building a bond program. And, the way this information is presented goes a long way in determining the amount of credit that a bond company is willing to extend. There are a few different options for presenting year-end financials, with the two most common being internal financials and CPA-reviewed financials.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety Group, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nIn our current series of articles, we are taking a deeper look into the properties of a balance sheet that will affect a contractor’s bonding capacity. We have previously discussed bonding capacity and summarized working capital in regards to the impact it can have on a contractor’s capacity. However, another very important component on the balance sheet that surety underwriters will consider is net worth, also referred to as equity.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety Group, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nFor contractors that do a lot of bonded work, their bonding capacity is a critical element of their business. Capacity often determines which projects a company can and cannot pursue, so it is managed very closely. However, for contractors that are new to bonding or have not bonded previously but remain interested in performing bonded work, this is likely a foreign concept to them. So, what is bonding capacity, and what items determine the amount of capacity that a surety carrier is willing to offer?\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nAs surety brokers, we initiate bond programs for our construction clients. Single and aggregate limits are determined in large part by their financials and experience. Often, there are jobs that exceed the single limit we have in place, or are larger than any job that our client has previously completed. When it is a job that makes sense for the contractor, it is our job to work with the bond company and find a solution so the contractor can bid the job or take on the contract. One available solutions is a process referred to as funds control.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety Department, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic will have many long and short term effects on the surety industry. While the long term effects might not be known for years, some short term changes are already occurring. Early on, we have witnessed bond companies start to tighten their underwriting guidelines, and now we are seeing an increase in General Contractors (GC) requiring performance and payment bonds from their subcontractors.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety Department, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nContractors often ask us what bond companies are looking for when they are reviewing balance sheets and income statements. The answer isn’t a simple one, because there are many items that underwriters look at when determining if they will write a bond for a contractor. Typically, the first thing an underwriter will do is calculate a contractor’s working capital.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety Department, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nBefore COVID-19, the construction industry had been enjoying one of the longest economic booms that this county has seen in recent memory. And, even though construction has been deemed essential, the industry is already seeing some effects from the pandemic, ranging from delayed material supplies, projects being shut down, and late or non-payments from project owners.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety Division, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nThe construction industry is currently booming. According to a survey conducted by the AGC of America, and a recent article written by Rancho Mesa’s Kevin Howard, the industry shows no signs of slowing down, as 80% of contractors predict growth in 2020. While that’s great news for the industry, we are starting to see some trends that can cause some issues for contractors.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety Division, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nIn California, when a contractor opts to organize their business as a Limited Liability Company (LLC) they are required to maintain an LLC Employee/Worker Bond in the amount of $100,000 in order to obtain their Contractors License, per the California Business and Professions Code, Section 7071.6.5. After our clients receive notice of this requirement, we are often asked why this bond is required and what does it protect against.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety Division, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nWhen we have clients that are required to bond for the first time, often their first questions are what is a surety bond, how do they work, and why am I being required to provide one.\n\nIn its basic form, a surety bond is a three party agreement between the contractor, called the principal, the project owner, called the obligee, and the surety company. The surety company provides a financial guarantee to the obligee that the principal is both qualified and capable of performing the contracted job.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety Division, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nFor a contractor that is wanting to bid a job, or has won a job that’s requiring a bond that they are not able to qualify for on their own, one option for increasing their bond capacity and ability to qualify would be to have a third party also indemnify to their Surety. While there are definite risks, this type of agreement can be very beneficial to both parties.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety Division, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nFor small or new contractors that are looking to break into the world of government contract work, the process of getting a surety bond program in place can seem like an onerous one. It requires the contractor to compile a lot of paperwork and detailed financial reports, which can be a daunting task for any contractor, regardless of size or experience. However, there are now several “A” rated sureties that provide credit-based programs for writing smaller bonds.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nWhen we review contracts that require bonding, one area that we need to understand is the warranty obligation. I would expect that over 90% of the contracts that we review for our contractor clients contain a standard one-year warranty term. Since Performance & Payment Bonds respond to the contract, the surety company is also on the hook for this one-year obligation. Premium rates for bonding already include the cost for this one-year warranty in the cost of the performance & payment bond.\n\nAuthor, Andy Roberts, Account Executive, Surety, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nWhen a surety carrier is evaluating a bonding program for a contractor, they use many different underwriting factors to determine an acceptable amount of bond capacity. They will consider a contractor’s working capital, net worth and work in progress schedules, to name a few. Another important factor that can help increase a contractor's bonding capacity is a bank line of credit.\n\nAuthor, Emily Marasso, Media Communications Assistant, Rancho Mesa Insurance Services, Inc.\n\nBabies, we were all one once; and many of us have had them or are having them. During the Baby Boom, 50 million babies were born between the 1940s and 1950s. We haven’t seen numbers like that since, until this year. Well, we may be exaggerating a little."
