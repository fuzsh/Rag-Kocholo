        "text": "Andrew Roberts Biography\n\nBorn and raised in Muskingum County, Andy graduated from Maysville High School in 1999 and then went on to receive a Bachelor of Science in Geography from Ohio University. Having started working for Muskingum County GIS out of college, he gained a passion for public service and wanted to give back to his community. Andy was first elected to Zanesville City Council as an At-Large member in 2010, and then assumed the 6th Ward Council seat in 2014 and has served there since.\n\nAndyâ€™s focus while on Council has been broad; however his main work has revolved mainly around real estate issues and acquisition, the City budget and reinvestment into City infrastructure. Andy currently serves as the Chair of the Public Service Committee, sits on the Ways & Means and Public Safety Committees. He is also a board member of the Zanesville Community Improvement Corporation. His proudest achievements over his ten year term have been:\n\n-The rezoning of the former YMCA property on McIntire Ave, allowing that property to see its full potential and the impact it has had on the surrounding area.\n\n-Instituting traffic calming measures across the city making neighborhoods safer and more desirable.\n\n-Authorizing the study of our City road network, and budgeting additional funds to bring our streets back to what they should be.\n\nOngoing and future work include: the cleanup and redevelopment of the Lear site, Public Safety reform and ensuring that the City of Zanesville continues in a positive direction.\n\nAside from his Council duties, Andy administers the Muskingum County GIS Department, Muskingum County Planning Commission, and Muskingum County Land Reutilization Corporation (Land Bank).
