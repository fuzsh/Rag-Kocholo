(Sunday parking ordinance will be in effect for streets near the church).\n\nThose left to carry on his memory are his wife, Abi; his children, Dillon, Danika, and Deegan; sister, Becky; parents, Edie and Don; Abi’s parents, Dee and Joe, and her extended, close-knit family, as well as his many friends.\n\nAndy was born in Iowa City and continued to live in the area, eventually finding his home in Lone Tree. At a very early age, he fell in love with anything that had wheels. That love became his life’s work. He was a member of the Lone Tree Volunteer Fire Department and valued the friendships he made there. He continued helping people, not only as an EMT, but when he joined the UIHC staff. He will be remembered and missed by all who knew him.\n\nMemorial gifts in Andy’s memory may be made to the Lone Tree Volunteer Fire Department, Iowa City Hospice, or the charity of your choice.\n\nTo share a memory, thought or condolence please visit the funeral home website @ www.gayandciha.com\n\n."
