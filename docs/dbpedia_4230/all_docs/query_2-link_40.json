Despite the vice-captain putting in solid performances, it was clear that quality needed to be added in this position ahead of the new season.\n\nReports linked Liverpool with a range of players, but Andy Robertson was the main one that stuck after an impressive campaign at Hull despite their relegation. On 19 June 2017, it was widely reported that a deal of around £8,000,000 had been agreed with Hull for the transfer of Robertson, and that the Scot would arrive at Melwood for his medical in the coming days. These reports proved to be correct, as Robertson was photographed entering the training ground a day later.\n\nOn 21 July 2017, it was confirmed that Robertson had signed a five-year contract to become a Liverpool player. He was handed the number 26 shirt, previously worn by Tiago Ilori.\n\nAfter not being included in the squad for the opening two games of the season, Robertson made his Reds debut on 19 August 2017, starting and putting in an impressive showing in a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace. He continued to put in assured performance in his next two appearances, before failing to make a first-team appearance until December, due to the much improved performances of Alberto Moreno.\n\nOn 2 December 2017, Robertson made his first appearance in almost two months, starting in a 5-1 win away to Brighton. After an injury to Moreno, Robertson became the Reds’ first choice left back, starting in the 229th Merseyside Derby. The Scotsman’s form exceeded all expectations at the club, with Robertson becoming a firm fan-favourite. On 13 January 2018, Robertson had his name chanted by the Anfield crowd after an immense performance in a win over league leaders, Manchester City.\n\nOn 24 February 2018, Robertson was named man-of-the-match after a 4-1 win over West Ham, after a great defensive performance, as well as grabbing an assist for Sadio Mane’s goal. On 31 March, Robertson assisted Mohamed Salah’s winner with a well controlled first time ball in a 2-1 win away to Crystal Palace.\n\nOn 13 May 2018, Robertson scored his first goal for the club, smashing home from inside the penalty area to round off a 4-0 win over Brighton. The Scotsman had also previously assisted Dejan Lovren’s header with a fine cross.\n\nHonours[]\n\nLiverpool[]\n\nPremier League: 1 (2019-20)\n\nUEFA Champions League: 1 (2019)\n\nFA Cup: 1 (2022)\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: 1 (2019)\n\nEFL Cup: 2 (2022, 2024)\n\nUEFA Super Cup: 1 (2019)\n\nCommunity Shield: 1 (2022)\n\nIndividual[]\n\nPFA Team of the Year: 2 (2018-19, 2019-20)\n\nUEFA Team of the Year: 1 (2019)\n\nUEFA Champions League Squad of the Season: 1 (2018-19)\n\nStats[]\n\nSeason League FA Cup League Cup Europe Other Total Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals 2017-18 22 1 1 0 1 0 6 0 0 0 30 1 2018-19 36 0 0 0 0 0 12 0 0 0 48 0 2019-20 36 2 1 0 0 0 9 1 3 0 49 3 2020-21 38 1 1 0 0 0 10 0 1 0 50 1 2021-22 29 3 4 0 4 0 10 0 0 0 47 3 2022-23 34 0 2 0 1 0 5 0 1 0 43 0 2023-24 23 3 2 0 1 0 4 0 0 0 30 3 Total 218 10 11 0 7 0 56 1 5 0 297 11\n\nSeason Apps Goals Assists G+A 2017-18 30 1 5 6 2018-19 48 0 13 13 2019-20 49 3 12 15 2020-21 50 1 7 8 2021-22 47 3 15 18 2022-23 43 0 11 11 2023-24 30 3 2 5 Total 297 11 65 76\n\n[]\n\nAndy Robertson player profile at LFCHistory.net"
