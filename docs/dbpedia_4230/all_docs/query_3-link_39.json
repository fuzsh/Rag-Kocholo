        "text": "There are a lot of questionable stories about the diminutive, sparkly and very sociable historian Andrew Roberts. An ex-girlfriend claims he has framed pictures of Margaret Thatcher not just in his study and drawing room but also next to his bed. During his single days, he was supposed to rival Casanova with his successful romantic conquests. And there's a widespread belief among the denizens of social London that his wealth comes not from history but from a family interest in the British franchises of Kentucky Fried Chicken.\n\nThen there are those who claim he is among the finest historians of his generation and will be one of the big thinkers behind the next Conservative government, pointing to his close acquaintance with David Cameron and old friendships with Michael Gove, Oliver Letwin and, more surprisingly, Cameron's touchy-feely strategy chief, Steve Hilton.\n\nIt is certainly the case that it is practically impossible to go to a smart party in London without finding Roberts, usually squiring a beautiful woman - recently his second wife, public relations executive, Susan Gilchrist - and always surrounded by admirers listening to his tales of cosy dinners with George Bush and Nicolas Sarkozy. Of the other rumours, the bedside photograph will have been banished since his marriage (though his admiration for Lady Thatcher is undiminished), his romantic prowess speaks for itself and the ownership of KFC is true, though the family money also comes from the sale of Job's Dairy in 1987, and his books sell a fair few copies.\n\nAs a historian, Roberts is facing a defining moment. Next week sees the publication of The Storm of War, subtitled with characteristic bravado: \"A New History of the Second World War\". It runs to well over 600 pages and may be his masterpiece, concentrating on Hitler's personality and his Nazism and providing an answer to the biggest question of all: why the Germans lost the war.\n\nAdvance reviews, such as that published in last week's Economist, proclaim that it's a \"magnificent book\" and a serious work of scholarship. Readers of gossip columns, including Roberts's own, which he has just started writing for the reinvigorated monthly Tatler, might be surprised to find he has any time to spend in archives. But the Economist praises his research as \"startling\" and \"gritty\".\n\nThe Second World War is hardly new ground and publishing a worthwhile book about it requires both impressive research and a striking degree of self-belief. \"His biography of Salisbury is magisterial and his book on Halifax, which was written while he was practically still an undergraduate, remains the standard work,\" says Michael Howard, retired regius professor of modern history at Oxford University.\n\nRoberts's biography of Lord Halifax, The Holy Fox, published in 1991, was in fact written some six years after he graduated, after a short and unsuccessful stint as a merchant banker at Fleming. He has not looked back. Eminent Churchillians followed, since when there have been a further 10 books, including Hitler and Churchill (2003) and A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900 (2006), before The Storm of War.\n\nAt the same time, he has been married, had two children with his first wife, Camilla; been divorced and enjoyed a long relationship with Leonie Frieda, herself divorced from celebrity hairdresser John Frieda, and whom he encouraged to write a bestselling historical biography of her own on Catherine de Medici. Now he is married to Susan Gilchrist.\n\nRoberts was born in January 1963 in London, the son of Simon, who had inherited the Job's Dairy milk business, and Katie, a housewife. He was sent away to Cranleigh School and it was there, at the age of nine - \"I was an absolutely beautiful child\" - that he became interested in history: \"Story-telling, personality, battles, wars, assassinations and death ... there had to be smiting.\"\n\nIn the senior school, he was bullied and took refuge in the library where he first embraced Trotskyism and then Thatcherism. He has never abandoned the latter. These days, he jokes about the bullying - \"I was a hubristic little tosser\" - but at the time he found his unpopularity \"absolutely terrifying\". After his A-levels, he was expelled from Cranleigh and prepared for his Oxbridge entrance exams at a crammer in Cambridge. He graduated in 1985 from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, with a first-class degree in history and was approached as a possible recruit for MI6.\n\nHis mind is sharp and his published works have won many an award. However, unlike in America, where successful academics are expected to be politically active and socially accomplished, his reputation in Britain is muddied by his neoconservative politics and his relentless socialising. How can he be both objective and a friend of George Bush? people wonder. If he enjoys party-hopping, how can he enjoy serious study?\n\nA friend suggests that the two facets of his personality are complementary. \"If you've spent all day alone in an archive, it's nice to get out; second, his work is very strong on human stories and on understanding human motivation. The fact that he is a gregarious person helps that side of things.\"\n\nTatler editor Catherine Ostler, who hired Roberts, agrees. \"He has great social energy and a voracious appetite for interesting people,\" she says. \"I thought he would be the perfect columnist because he has the historian's triumvirate - an eye for detail, fluency and an ability to set things in context.\"\n\nNevertheless, Roberts invites a degree of mockery. In 1995 when he was 32, a journalist who went to interview him at home was shown to a seat below a big portrait of Roberts himself; while a diary published in the Spectator magazine in March 2007 drew widespread derision. It described a tour of America to promote A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900 and managed to name-drop, among others, Harry Evans and Tina Brown (they \"gave a dinner for 50\" in his honour), Henry and Nancy Kissinger (another dinner), Michael Bloomberg, John Bolton (\"who said he was enjoying the book\"), Irwin Stelzer (\"gave a big party for me\"), Karl Rove, Dick Cheney, Sarkozy (\"an intimate dinner\"), and Bush, then president or, as Roberts put it, \"reviewer-in-chief\".\n\nAll this would have been truly cringe-making if he had not ended the diary by likening himself to the absurdly self-important Mr Toad from Wind in the Willows. A friend says \"he does it slightly to take the piss out of himself\". He may appear a bumptious establishment figure, but it is impossible to escape the feeling that a lot of his Mr Toadishness is - not unlike Mr Toad's - a mask for sensitivity.\n\nRoberts's historical writings - for all their espousal of top-down history, where events are driven by great men - often question the received line. This was first the case in his debut, on Churchill's foreign secretary. Whereas Halifax has traditionally been written off as an unsound politician, too much in favour of appeasing Hitler, Roberts argued that he was an enthusiastic supporter of Churchill's desire to stand up to the dictator.\n\nOther unorthodox views have proved more controversial. \"Might it be that Hitler actually had nothing personally against the Jews, but just spotted that demonising them would be a rewarding political move?\" he asked in Hitler and Churchill. Rather than suggesting Roberts harbours sympathy for the Nazis (he rather proclaims his philo-semitism), this shows his preparedness to embrace controversy and his love of controversial counterfactual history.\n\nThis has not stopped attacks from those who are opposed to his neo-conservativism. Writing about A History of the English-Speaking People Since 1900 American historian Mike Davis proclaims that Roberts's arguments \"about the Boer concentration camps are similar to the arguments of the Nazi apologists about those camps\". It is not an accusation many people take seriously: as the Observer's review by Tim Gardam pointed out, the book is a call to arms for \"English-speaking people's democratic pluralism\" against \"fascist intolerance of different varieties\".\n\nRoberts is definitely committed to his work. \"He and Susan spent most of their holidays in the last four years visiting sites of interest to his books about the war,\" says a friend. \"Auschwitz, Stalingrad ... it's just as well that Susan isn't the sort of person to want to lie on a beach.\"\n\nThose close to Roberts say that despite his work for centre-right thinktanks the Centre for Policy Studies and Centre for Social Cohesion, he does not aspire to an overtly political role. He has, however, just been involved with the UK National Defence Association pamphlet on defence spending and, with his connections, it is likely that his advice and world view will be closely eyed by a possible Conservative government, whatever the formal relationship.\n\nLast week, Andrew Roberts announced that he keeps a daily diary. While there will be people who shudder at this news, it is bound to be a document of some historical interest.\n\nThe Roberts lowdown\n\nBorn: 13 January 1963 in London. His father Simon was a business man from Surrey who had inherited Job's Dairy. His mother a housewife called Katie. He was expelled from Cranleigh School, but went on to study history at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he is now an honorary senior scholar. He has worked as a corporate broker and a freelance journalist. Divorced from his first wife, Camilla Sophie, with whom he had two children. Married to Susan Gilchrist, senior partner at communications firm Brunswick.\n\nBest of times: Learning that George W Bush was a fan and taking up an invitation to the White House in 2007 while promoting his A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900\n\nWorst of times: On publication of the same book, he was criticised by some, including American historian Mike Davis, for excusing concentration camps in the Boer War. The Economist said the book was \"less a history than giant political pamphlet larded with its author's prejudices\".\n\nWhat he says: \"Sneered at for being 'simplistic' in his reaction to 9/11, Bush's visceral responses to the attacks of a fascistic, totalitarian death cult will be seen as having been substantially the right ones ... Iraq has been a victory for the US-led coalition.\""
