        "text": "Overview of the events of 1946 in music\n\nList of years in music (table)\n\n+...\n\nThis is a list of notable events in music that took place in the year 1946.\n\n1946 in British music\n\n1946 in Norwegian music\n\n1946 in country music\n\n1946 in jazz\n\nJanuary 6 – A somewhat revised and streamlined revival of Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's Show Boat opens on Broadway at the Ziegfeld Theatre, the same theatre at which the original production played in 1927. This production features newly designed sets and costumes, new, more extended choreography, and a new song, Nobody Else But Me, by Kern and Hammerstein.\n\nFebruary – Kathleen Ferrier's recording contract with Columbia Records expires, and she transfers to Decca.\n\nMay 24 – John Serry Sr. collaborates with the vocalist Sidor Belarsky and the Mischa Borr Orchestra in recordings of Ukrainian folk songs.[1]\n\nAugust – American singer Doris Day leaves Les Brown's band and begins her solo career.\n\nSeptember 11 – The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra holds its first rehearsal.[2]\n\nFormation of Bamberg Symphony; Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra; and RIAS Symphonie-Orchester.\n\nAl Jolson rerecords his old hits for the soundtrack of his Columbia biopic The Jolson Story (released October 10 in the United States), and becomes a superstar to the post-war generation too.\n\nB. B. King begins working as a professional musician in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nChet Atkins makes his first appearance at the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nGeorgia Gibbs signs with the Majestic label.\n\nBill Haley's professional musical career begins as a member of The Down Homers. His earliest known recordings are made during a Down Homers radio performance, but will not be released until 2006.\n\nJohn Serry Sr. appears as the featured accordion soloist on the Gordon MacRae radio hit Skyline Roof.[3]\n\nAnnie Get Your Gun – Original Broadway cast\n\nShow Boat – Original Broadway cast\n\nFrank Sinatra Conducts the Music of Alec Wilder – Frank Sinatra\n\nLombardoland – Guy Lombardo\n\nLouis Jordan And His Tympany Five – Louis Jordan\n\nManhattan Tower – Gordon Jenkins\n\nThe Voice of Frank Sinatra – Frank Sinatra\n\nMerry Christmas Music – Perry Como\n\nWhat We So Proudly Hail – Bing Crosby\n\nFavorite Hawaiian Songs, Vol. One – Bing Crosby\n\nFavorite Hawaiian Songs, Vol. Two – Bing Crosby\n\nBlue Skies – Bing Crosby\n\nDon't Fence Me In – Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters\n\nFor each Year in Music (beginning 1940) and Year in Country Music (beginning 1939), a comprehensive Year End Top Records section can be found at mid-page (popular), and on the Country page.\n\nThe charts are compiled from data published by Billboard magazine, using their formulas, with slight modifications. Most important, there are no songs missing or truncated by Billboard's holiday deadline. Each year, records included enter the charts between the prior November and early December. Each week, fifteen points are awarded to the number one record, then nine points for number two, eight points for number three, and so on. This system rewards songs that reach the highest positions, as well as those that had the longest chart runs. This is our adjustment to Mr. Whitburn's formula, which places no. 1 records on top, then no 2 and so on, ordered by weeks at that position. This allows a record with 4 weeks at no. 1 that only lasted 6 weeks to be rated very high. Here, the total points of a song's complete chart run determines its position. Our chart has more songs, more weeks and may look nothing like Billboard's, but it comes from the exact same surveys.\n\nBefore the Hot100 was implemented in 1958, Billboard magazine measured a record's performance with three charts, 'Best-Selling Popular Retail Records', 'Records Most-Played On the Air' or 'Records Most Played By Disk Jockeys' and 'Most-Played Juke Box Records'. As Billboard did starting in the 1940s, the three totals for each song are combined, with that number determining the final year-end rank. For example, 1944's \"A Hot Time in the Town of Berlin\" by Bing and the Andrews Sisters finished at no. 19, despite six weeks at no. 1 on the 'Most-Played Juke Box Records'(JB) chart. It scored 126 points, to go with its Best-Selling chart (BS) total of 0. Martha Tilton's version of \"I'll Walk Alone\" peaked at no. 4 on the Juke Box chart, which only totalled 65 points, but her BS total was also 65, for a final total of 130, ranking no. 18. Examples like this can be found in \"The Billboard\" magazine up to 1958. The 'Records Most-Played On the Air' chart didn't begin until January 1945, which is why we only had two sub-totals.\n\nOur rankings are based on Billboard data, but we also present info on recording and release dates, global sales totals, RIAA and BPI certifications and other awards. Rankings from other genres like 'Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs' or 'Most Played Juke Box Race Records', Country charts including 'Most Played Juke Box Folk (Hillbilly) Records', 'Cashbox magazine', and other sources are presented if they exist. We supplement our info with reliable data from the \"Discography of American Historical Recordings\" website, Joel Whitburn's Pop Memories 1890-1954[4] and other sources as specified.\n\nThe following songs appeared in The Billboard's 'Best Selling Retail Records', 'Records Most-Played On the Air' and 'Most Played Juke Box Records' charts, starting November 1945 and before December 1946.\n\nRank Artist Title Label Recorded Released Chart positions 1 Eddy Howard and His Orchestra \"To Each His Own\"[5] Majestic 7188 April 16, 1946 ( ) June 1946 ( ) US Billboard 1946 #1, US #1 for 8 weeks, 24 total weeks, 576 points, CashBox #3, 1,000,000 sales[4] 2 The Ink Spots \"The Gypsy\"[6] Decca 18817 February 19, 1946 ( ) March 1946 ( ) US Billboard 1946 #2, US #1 for 13 weeks, 23 total weeks, CashBox #1, US Most-Played Race Records 1945 #3, Race Records #1 for 3 weeks, 13 total weeks, 548 points, 1,000,000 sales[4] 3 Frankie Carle and his Orchestra (vocal by Marjorie Hughes) \"Rumors Are Flying\"[7] Columbia 37069 June 20, 1946 ( ) August 19, 1946 ( ) US Billboard 1946 #3, US #1 for 11 weeks, 28 total weeks, 477 points, CashBox #6, 1,000,000 sales[4] 4 Frank Sinatra \"Five Minutes More\"[7] Columbia 37048 May 28, 1946 ( ) July 8, 1946 ( ) US Billboard 1946 #4, US #1 for 7 weeks, 19 total weeks, 453 points 5 Swing and Sway With Sammy Kaye \"The Old Lamp-Lighter\"[8] RCA Victor 20-1963 August 21, 1946 ( ) September 1946 ( ) US Billboard 1946 #5, US #1 for 8 weeks (Juke Box), 21 total weeks, 452 points, CashBox #8 6 Frankie Carle and his Orchestra (vocal by Marjorie Hughes \"Oh!

It includes rankings for the calendar year only, handicapping records at the beginning and end of the year such as \"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie\", which finished second as a result. For all year-end charts on these pages, records that enter the chart in December of the previous year, or remain on the chart after December of the current year, receive points for their full chart runs. Each week, a score of 15 points is assigned for the no. 1 record, 9 points for no. 2, 8 points for no. 3, and so on, and the total of all weeks determined the final rank. Additional information from other sources is reported, but not used for ranking. This includes dates obtained from the Discography of American Historical Recordings website, chart performance from Billboard's 'Best Selling Retail Records, Records Most-Played On the Air and Most Played Juke Box Records charts, Most Played Juke Box Folk (Hillbilly) Records, Cashbox, and other sources as noted.
