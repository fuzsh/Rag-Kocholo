For more information about myself, you might take a look at my Bio page.\n\nHi, there!\n\nThis Andy Roberts Newsletter has been going here since January 2022 and there are more than 100 posts in the archive. When you subscribe, you get new ones sent to your inbox so you never miss an update, download link, advance notice of gigs, livestreams or anything else.\n\nStay up-to-date\n\nYou won’t have to worry about missing anything. Every new edition of my newsletter goes directly to your email inbox, or substack app if you prefer.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nCurrently the schedule is for a brief email going out each Wednesday, giving notice of any gigs coming up at the weekend, and a more thoughtful, longer piece of writing, news, video or music post which goes out on a Sunday. So a maximum of two emails per week, sometimes fewer. That can change and evolve as time passes though.\n\nJoin the After Party crew\n\nBecome part of a community of people who share a common interest and good taste! As an email subscriber you will also be entitled to post comments here or reply to the emails in order to have your say and join in the fun."
