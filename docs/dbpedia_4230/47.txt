Andy Roberts (born Jan. 29, 1951, Urlings Village, Antigua and Barbuda) is a West Indian cricketer who is considered the father of modern West Indian fast bowling.

Roberts was the first player from Antigua to represent the West Indies. He was a vital member of the four-pronged pace (fast-bowling) attack that made the West Indies such a feared team in the 1970s and â€™80s. The senior fast bowler on the team, he handed down his experience to the likes of Michael Holding, Joel Garner, Colin Croft, Wayne Daniel, Courtney Walsh, and Curtly Ambrose. Roberts had a moderately long run-up to the wicket, building his speed rapidly as he prepared for his delivery. He could generate steep lift and was very quick through the air. Roberts played for less than 10 years but faced some of the best teams in the world. He was not only a fast bowler but a crafty one, and he was the first bowler to use clever changes in pace to retire batsmen with bouncers (balls that are pitched short and bounce at shoulder level).
