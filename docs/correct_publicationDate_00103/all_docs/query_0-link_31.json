        "text": "Gritty, hard-boiled space action\n\nThe first in this series, Altered Carbon, was all the rage a few years back. It was a gritty, hard-boiled detective story set in the 25th century, complete with pithy first person narration by sardonic tough guy male protagonist. The universe is a little reminiscent of the one in the movie Blade Runner, with powerful corporations that run everything and crime syndicates and rebel groups in the shadows. The most notable technological feature of this reality is the ability to back human consciousness up on a \"cortical stack\" implant, allowing people to \"resleeve\" in a new body if the old one gets excessively damaged. The implications of this made for some interesting twists, both in terms of plot and human themes.\n\nIn this novel, a loose sequel to Altered Carbon, Takeshi Kovacs has put aside the detective work and is back to his former trade of soldiering. He's serving as a mercenary on behalf of a corporate power battling rebel fanatics on a planet whose civilian populace is receiving the brunt of the misery and suffering. He's feeling about ready to jump ship on his contract when a pilot points Kovacs to a xenoarchaeologist in a prison camp, who knows something about a gateway leading to an ancient, derelict alien starship -- the find of the century. Can he put together a team to stake legal claim?\n\nAs with many sequels to hot first novels, the dazzle factor of the author’s style and universe has worn off a little, and this reader notices the formula a little more. For those who liked the grit, hard-boiled cynicism, manga-like universe, over-the-top sex scenes, and action movie machismo of Altered Carbon, Broken Angels brings more of that, but the characters and plot are more familiar and forgettable. While the part surrounding the entering of the long-dead ghost ship, the high point of the book, has a cool eeriness similar to the opening of the movie Alien and its own horror to deliver about the fate of a superior civilization, the story leading up this point isn’t hugely riveting. Yes, the sequences about locating a corporate backer (without being screwed over by the same), recruiting a squad of soldiers from the colorful personalities found in a pile of discarded cortical stacks, battling nanobots, and discovering what became of a previous expedition to the alien ship, were a pleasant audio distraction while I was doing yard work, a lot of other science fiction novels could have done as much. The war going on in the background had potential to be interesting, but wasn’t fleshed out much -- I suspect it will come more into play in the next book.\n\nAll in all, this is a recommendation for those who loved Altered Carbon and want to go further into the Takeshi Kovacs universe, but other readers could probably take it or leave it. Audiobook reader Todd McLaren has a square-jawed voice that suits the hard-boiled nature of Morgan's prose well and keeps it from coming across as too self-serious, but his sultry-voiced women can be a little irritating. Particularly the \"sassy black girl\" voice.\n\nAMAZEBALLS!!!\n\nI dont write long reviews mainly bciz I dont like to read long reviews. I will just say that I've seen a lot of reviews on this book complaining that it is not like the first book and is just some military/war story. Not the case. True it is not the noir detective style that Altered Carbon hints to be, but it is certainly a \"sci-fi intrigue tale\" with as much character depth and poetic sort of writing. Basically, if you loved Alrered Carbon like I did you will be missing out terribly if you don't get this one! Takashi is his same deep introspective self and there's plenty of the same mythology and more in Broken Angels. So don't let anyone steer you away from this one thinking it won't be as good, in some ways it's even better if that's possible. I am dreading the next book however because I love this story line so much and I'm afraid that the rediculously poor audio and new narrator that doesnt even know enough about the trilogy to properly pronounce Takashi Kovacs and uses an echo effect on his voice for some unkown reason so I hope I can sit though it because after listening to Broken Angels I'm sure I love this story and it's excellent author. GET THIS BOOK!!! IT'S AMAZEBALLS!!!\n\nGreat narrator, OK story\n\nI was looking to find an audio book series after I completed the old man’s war series by John Scalzi and remembered being thoroughly entertained by Netflix’s altered carbon. After discovering that this was the second novel in the series, I decide to give this a try. The narrator is one of the best that I’ve heard as I am new to audiobooks, however, the content and story itself was lacking. There were multiple times throughout the story where I lost interest and it really only seems to pick up towards the end. Given that the overall length of the audiobook, I can’t help but feel that my time may have been better spent listening to something else."
