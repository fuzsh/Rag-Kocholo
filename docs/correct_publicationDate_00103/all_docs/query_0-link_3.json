        "text": "Dust jacket and interior illustrations by Vincent Chong.\n\nAbout the Book:\n\nBroken Angels is the follow-up to Altered Carbon, the novel that put Richard K. Morgan on the map, a fusion of Blade Runner noir and far future hard science tied together with a skull slamming narrative. It's really that good.\n\nWhereas Altered Carbon owed a debt to classic detective fiction, Broken Angels is a war and salvage novel, with the carnage and high energy narrative that goes along with that territory.\n\nThe Subterranean Press edition includes a cover and full color interior illustrations by Vincent Chong. One of the illos will be exclusive to the lettered edition.\n\nBroken Angels will be available in two unique editions:"
