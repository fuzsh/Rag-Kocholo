        "text": "About the Book\n\nThe Fallen Angels Book Club has only two requirements: the members must love books and have a white-collar criminal record. Hollis Morgan fits the bill.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nThe Fallen Angels Book Club has only two requirements: the members must love books and have a white-collar criminal record. Hollis Morgan fits the bill. Left holding the bag in an insurance fraud scheme concocted by her now ex-husband, she served her time and is trying to rebuild her life. All she wants is for the court to pardon her conviction so she can return to law school. After one of her fellow members is murdered in a scenario straight out of a club selection, Hollis is once again the subject of police scrutiny. Refusing to get stuck with another bad rap, she sets out to investigate her fellow club members. Is one of them really blackmailing the others? As a second member dies in yet another book-inspired murder, Hollis realizes that time is running out. Everything rides on her finding the killer-not just her career aspirations. She must identify the killer before she herself becomes the next victim. Everyone is convinced she knows more than she lets on. But what is it, exactly, that is she supposed to know? The Fallen Angels Book Club is the first book in an exciting new mystery series featuring amateur sleuth Hollis Morgan.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"Who is Hollis Morgan? Under this name she's building a life around her job as a paralegal and her volunteer work at a senior center. Her personal life centers on a monthly book club whose other members share her secret-they've all served prison time for white-collar felonies. When two murders put her on the suspect list, Hollis must find the connections that place her at the center of the web of lies, and clear her name before she loses her chance for a pardon. Twists and turns keep this debut novel exciting to the surprising end!\"\n\n-Michele Drier, author of Edited for Death, An Amy Hobbes Newspaper Mystery, and The Kandesky Vampire Chronicles.\n\n\"R. Franklin James' new book has everything a reader could ask for in a good mystery: intriguing plot, fascinating characters, and a few shockers thrown in along the way. From start to finish it kept me turning pages. I'm already looking forward to her next one.\"\n\n-Shirley Kennedy, Romance Novelist\n\n\"Reading is murder in this must-read suspense novel filled with surprising twists and turns.\"\n\n-Cathi Stoler, author of the mystery thriller, Telling Lies\n\n\"A fast paced plot with many twists coupled with a smart and determined protagonist make this a most enjoyable read.\"\n\n-Kathleen Delaney, author of the Ellen McKenzie real estate mysteries"
