As an Amazon Associate I earn money from qualifying purchases.\n\nPublication Order of A Land Fit For Heroes Books\n\nPublication Order of Hakan Veil Books\n\nPublication Order of Standalone Novels\n\nPublication Order of Takeshi Kovacs Books\n\nPublication Order of Takeshi Kovacs Graphic Novels\n\nwith Scott Bryan Wilson\n\nPublication Order of Black Widow Books\n\nPublication Order of Crysis Comic Books\n\nPublication Order of Black Widow (2004) Comic Books\n\nBorn January 01, 1965 in London, England, the United Kingdom. He had been brought up in Hethersett, which is a dormitory village. Totally screwed up his first year at Queen’s College, Cambridge University, he shifted his studies to History with a political/philosophical slant.\n\nAs a teenager, he had an ambition of traveling and wanted to be a writer. He believed that the way to learn English is through lessons from Native speakers so he did travel to Istanbul, Turkey. He entered the industry of English Language Teaching (ELT) and considered it as his accidental career. He stayed in that career for fourteen years. He read the literature, joined professional associations, signed up for further training, in-service and out. He traveled back to United Kingdom then to Madrid, Spain. Richard Morgan was a tutor at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, United Kingdom before he took off his writing career. Because of traveling widely and living in Spain and Istanbul, he became a Spanish and English fluent speaker.\n\nHe pursued his ambition of becoming a writer, he started writing short stories, articles, screenplays. At first, he was just writing idly and lazily while off but then, he spent one and a half year tying to get his screenplays taken seriously by movie makers. He started writing novels, furious letters protesting magazine editorial pieces but they weren’t published and no one wanted to make the movie.\n\nWhen he wrote Altered carbon in 2002, it was published by Gollancz and bought by Hollywood. It was the time he gave up his day job.\n\nRight now, he is a well-known English science fiction and fantasy author. He received a lot of awards like Philip K. Dick Award, Arthur C. Clarke Award, John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and nominations of Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, Locus Award for Best First Novel, and Arthur C. Clarke Award.\n\nAltered Carbon (2002)\n\nReceived Philip K. Dick Award for the Best novel winner in the year of 2003. This novel is richly created and well-crafted with fervent eye for details. It is like a second generation entry in a genre. Set roughly 500 years in the future or so, this novel imagines a world which can overcome death by the technology called “sleeving.” The human personalities, which are called sleeves, can be stored and downloaded into a new body, wherein their consciousness is stored in a cortical stack. Cortical stack is located at the base of human’s skull. When a person’s physical body died, his stack goes into the storage which enables other people to have it reloaded either in a virtual environment or another body. Only the richest people are able to acquire the best sleeving, and one of those people are called “Meths” (after the Bible figure Methuselah). Their bodies are repeatedly cloned and kept on ice which made them become immortals. Also, they are able to keep copies of their minds in remote storage. On the other hand, the hoi polloi, which are the people who can’t afford, are often subject to indignity because their bodies are used by others as sleeves while their own stacks deteriorate in storage.\n\nLaurens Bancroft, a Meth, seemingly committed suicide and his stack was destroyed. His backup enabled him to be resleeved. However, he can’t remember his actions for the last two days because his stack is on a back up schedule of 48 hours. But Bancroft believes that he has been murdered and hires Kovacs to perform some investigations regarding his death.\n\nTakeshi Kovacs, a former Envoy for the Protectorate, is a conservative UN body that has been resleeved over a century. The police and even Kovacs’ temptress swear that Laurens Bancroft can only have committed suicide. But while Takeshi Kovacs is dong his investigations, he slowly finds himself involved in an expanded trick which involves the impulse of the privileged and powerful people to protect themselves whatever may happen. The plot reveals through Kovacs’ history. He soon solves the enigma, but only after the great deal of cruelty and brutality, including torment in virtual reality, which he is able to endure only because of his training in Envoy.\n\nBLACK MAN “A.K.A. THIRTEEN” (2007)\n\nPublished by Gollancz in the United Kingdom and Del Rey in the United States of America. Thirteen is not simply a detective story set in the future but the setting is as different and highly-developed as the characters.\n\nCarl Marsalis, the main protagonist, is a thirteen. The thirteens are alpha males which are genetically engineered. They are designed to fight the century’s last disputes but they are risky to have around when it is peace time because they are bred and designed to brawl and attack. Like Carl Marsalis, he is designed to be like a soldier. Luckily, being Black is no longer an issue. However, being a thirteen, he is a subject to an entirely new form of partiality. He is a British and working for the organization of UN to keep track of all humans which are genetically enhanced.\n\nThirteens like him are downgraded to custody reservations or to Mars and outside the areas. There are also other humans enhanced but thirteens are the only ones imprisoned. Others are not seemingly threatening but they are still subject to oppression from the society. Marsalis is hired from the UN by the Colonization initiative (COLIN) to help investigate the traitor thirteen who has escaped from Mars. This traitor has emerged a series of brutal extermination across America. And only Marsalis can stop him so he joins the COLIN agents named Tom Norton and Sevgi Eretkin who also have their own few problems.\n\nCarl Marsalis makes his way through the man’s future world. People were exposed to Marsalis’ thoughts, as they’re influenced by him as a Black man, a British citizen, and as an outsider who is genetic. The trials Marsalis faces with the systems and humans he meets helped paint a lucid picture. This begins a frantic man hunt and battle of survival. Also the search for the verity about what the world’s last soldiers had done.\n\nBook Series In Order » Authors » Richard K. Morgan"
