        "text": "Subterranean Press, US, 2018. Full-Leather. Condition: New. Dust Jacket Condition: New. Vincent Chong (illustrator). 1st Edition. Presenting a superb signed lettered copy (this being letter 'A' of 26 lettered copies) presented in a leather traycase. This copy is in immaculate mint condition (book and case) and has never been read. Signed by the author, this copy is also signed by the artist Vincent Chong (artist for the cover and interior art. Other match-lettered copies are also available at the time of listing. Broken Angels is the follow-up to Altered Carbon, the novel that put Richard K. Morgan on the map, a fusion of Blade Runner noir and far future hard science tied together with a skull-slamming narrative. Whereas Altered Carbon owed a debt to classic detective fiction, Broken Angels is a war and salvage novel, with the carnage and high energy narrative that goes along with that territory. The Subterranean Press edition includes a cover and full colour interior illustrations by Vincent Chong. One of the illustrations is exclusive to the lettered edition. Synopsis - Fifty years after the events of ALTERED CARBON, Takeshi Kovacs is serving as a mercenary in the Procterate-sponsored war to put down Joshuah Kemp's revolution on the planet Sanction IV. He is offered the chance to join a covert team chasing a prize whose value is limitless -- and whose dangers are endless. Here is a novel that takes mankind to the brink. A breakneck-paced crime thriller, ALTERED CARBON took its readers deep into the universe Morgan had so compellingly realised without ever letting them escape the onward rush of the plot. BROKEN ANGELS melds SF, the war novel and the spy thriller to take the reader below the surface of this future and lay bare the treacheries, betrayals and follies that leave man so ill-prepared for the legacy he has been given: the stars. This is SF at its dizzying best: superb, yet subtle, world-building; strong yet sensitive characterisation; awesome yet believable technology, thrilling yet profound writing. Richard Morgan is set to join the genre's world-wide elite. Signed by Author and Illustrator"
