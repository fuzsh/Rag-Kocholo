        "text": "Altered Carbon is a sci-fi novel by English author Richard K. Morgan, first published in 2002. The cyberpunk adventure is set in a future where human consciousness can be transferred to different bodies, referred to as ‘sleeves’, allowing for a form of practical physical immortality.\n\nThe protagonist, Takeshi Kovacs, is a former elite military operative or ‘Envoy’ turned private investigator, piped from off-world storage facility into a new body on a Earth and hired to investigate the death of a wealthy man Laurens Bancroft. Bancroft and his wife are members of the untouchable self-serving super elite, nicknamed the ‘Meths’ after the long-lived biblical character Methuselah, and who tend to operate above the law.\n\nThe novel explores themes of the corruption of wealth (something very applicable to our current times) conscious versus physical identity, and the value put on human life in a society where bodies are interchangeable. It’s the first book in a trilogy following the exploits of the Takeshi Kovacs character, with sequels 2003’s Broken Angels and 2005’s Woken Furies. The story was adapted into a Netflix TV show which I enjoyed some years ago and wrote about here: Altered Carbon Season 1, Season 2 and Resleeved.\n\nLike the TV show, the book does not paint a pretty picture for the future of women in society – unless they are from the Meth class – and it touches on themes of sexual violence in a very direct manner. Violence in all it’s forms – sexual, physical, mental – is at the heart of this multi-layered story. As a result there is also more content unsuitable for a TV show within the pages of the book. However it is all mostly in keeping with the story and did not feel gratuitous while very obviously coming from the pen of a male writer.\n\nAnother major difference in the novel relates to the AI hotel in which Kovacs stays. In the show the hotel is an Edgar Allen Poe themed hotel called ‘The Raven’ run by a very human acting holographic AI to makes an interesting counterpoint to Kovacs’ military conditioning. Indeed, the avatar Poe is a strong character in the TV show. In the book there is hardly any banter between AI host and Kovacs, and the hotel is called ‘The Hendrix’ although the powerful guest defense system and hospitality of the AI hotel remains the same.\n\nAltered Carbon has been compared favourably to Blade Runner in that has a noir detective narrative blended with futuristic cyberpunk. The novel touches upon various societal issues such as class disparity, the commodification of human life, and the consequences of extreme wealth while also being filled with action-packed sequences, mystery and intricate plotting.\n\nMorgan also does some detailed world building in Altered Carbon, dropping nuggets about interplanetary history, politics, and social structures. The novel received widespread critical acclaim upon its release, and deservedly won the Philip K. Dick Award for Best Novel in 2003. The award is presented annually for the best science fiction published in paperback in the US. Sponsored by the Philadelphia Science Fiction Society, it has been supported since 2005 by the Philip K. Dick Trust. The award is presented at Norwescon, a sci-fi and fantasy convention held annually in Seattle, Washington.\n\nI was blown away by the novel, impressed by the complex plotting and visceral action sequences. As mentioned above, this is an unashamed ‘male’ sci-fi novel, but I have hopes that this edge be finessed in the later novels, Broken Angels and Woken Furies, which I will be reading this year at some point and will link to here once that happens. Having seen the TV show, I have a fairly good idea of where the story is headed, but I am sure there are surprises in store for me and layers of depth that just aren’t available when writing a Netflix show."
