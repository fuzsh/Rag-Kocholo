Hand provides everything that Kovacs and Schneider need to uncover the Martian spaceship and the hidden world that lies beyond its gate into space. Kovacs and Schneider have their own archaeologist, Tanya Wardani. Kovacs and Schneider rescue Wardani out of the internment camp that she is being held in. Wardani is one of the top archaeologists in her field.\n\nThe trio recruit some of the best soldiers in the war to help with their expedition. Not knowing what they are up against, they encounter challenge after challenge when the crew lands on the planet where they are plan on digging up the Martian spaceship,. Giant mechanical spiders, radiation sickness, and a feeling that there is a mole in their group that is trying to sabotage the mission are just a few of the obstacles.\n\nIn the end, some of the crew members die for the cause. Others become traitors. The biggest traitor of them all turns out to be the least likely culprit, the archaeologist, Tanya Wardani."
