        "text": "Broken Angels is a science fiction novel written by Richard K. Morgan and published in 2003. The audiobook version of the novel is narrated by Todd McLaren and runs for approximately 17 hours and 30 minutes. The novel is the second in the Takeshi Kovacs series, following the events of Altered Carbon.\n\nThe story is set in the 26th century, where humanity has colonized several planets and developed advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, interstellar travel, and human consciousness transfer. The protagonist, Takeshi Kovacs, is a former Envoy, a highly trained soldier with enhanced combat abilities and the ability to transfer his consciousness between bodies. Kovacs is hired by a wealthy businessman named Tanya Wardani to investigate the death of her father, a prominent scientist who was working on a secret project on the planet Sanction IV.\n\nKovacs arrives on Sanction IV and discovers that Wardani’s father was killed while working on a mysterious alien artifact known as the “Angelmaker.” The Angelmaker is a device that can manipulate reality and create new life forms, and it is coveted by several factions on the planet, including a religious cult, a criminal syndicate, and a group of mercenaries. Kovacs teams up with a group of mercenaries led by a woman named Jan Schneider, who has her own agenda for the Angelmaker.\n\nThe plot of Broken Angels is complex and multi-layered, with several subplots and twists that keep the listener engaged throughout the audiobook. The novel explores themes such as the nature of consciousness, the ethics of artificial intelligence, and the consequences of colonialism and imperialism. The world-building is rich and detailed, with vivid descriptions of the various planets and cultures in the novel.\n\nOne of the strengths of the audiobook version of Broken Angels is the narration by Todd McLaren. McLaren’s voice is deep and commanding, and he does an excellent job of bringing the various characters to life. His pacing is also spot-on, with the action scenes and dialogue flowing smoothly and naturally. The audiobook is also well-produced, with clear sound quality and no distracting background noise.\n\nAnother strength of the audiobook is the pacing of the story. The novel is fast-paced and action-packed, with several thrilling set pieces and intense combat scenes. However, the story also takes time to explore the characters and their motivations, which adds depth and complexity to the plot. The audiobook version of Broken Angels does an excellent job of balancing these elements, keeping the listener engaged and invested in the story.\n\nOne of the criticisms of Broken Angels is that it can be difficult to follow at times, especially for listeners who are not familiar with the first novel in the series. The novel introduces several new characters and concepts, and the plot can be convoluted and confusing at times. However, the audiobook version of the novel does a good job of clarifying these elements and making the story more accessible to new listeners.\n\nOverall, Broken Angels is a thrilling and thought-provoking science fiction novel that is well-suited to the audiobook format. The narration by Todd McLaren is excellent, and the pacing of the story is well-balanced between action and character development. While the plot can be complex and challenging at times, the audiobook version of the novel does an excellent job of making the story accessible to new listeners. Fans of science fiction and action-adventure stories will find much to enjoy in Broken Angels."
