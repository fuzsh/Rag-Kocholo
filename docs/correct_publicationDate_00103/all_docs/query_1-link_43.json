        "text": "From my list on compelling creepy.\n\nBy Heather Parry Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m a fiction and nonfiction writer originally from Rotherham, South Yorkshire but I now live and work in Glasgow. I have always loved dark books, even when I was a kid; I was firmly on the Goosebumps-Point Horror-Stephen King pipeline, and ended up in dark literary fiction. I love work that challenges the reader, makes them complicit, forces them to keep going despite everything because the writing is just so good. Here are five books I come back to time and time again.\n\nHeather's book list on compelling creepy\n\nWhy did Heather love this book?\n\nI first picked this up in a bookshop in Bangalore, knowing nothing about it or the (now very famous) author.\n\nI was unprepared for a novel that managed to evoke the lush and intense vibrancy of South Pacific Islands, the depravity of a real-life Nobel Prize winner who was accused of heinous crimes, and the heartbreak of losing someone to dementia – all at the same time.\n\nThis is an uncomfortable but unputdownable novel, and one that affected me so deeply I now have a tattoo of it; on my thumb is the symbol carved into wood to signal that the ’people in the trees’ live there, in memory of my beloved grandmother.\n\nBy Hanya Yanagihara,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The People in the Trees as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA thrilling anthropological adventure story with a profound and tragic vision of what happens when cultures collide—from the bestselling author of National Book Award–nominated modern classic, A Little Life\n\n“Provokes discussions about science, morality and our obsession with youth.” —Chicago Tribune\n\nIt is 1950 when Norton Perina, a young doctor, embarks on an expedition to a remote Micronesian island in search of a rumored lost tribe. There he encounters a strange group of forest dwellers who appear to have attained a form of immortality that preserves the body but not the mind. Perina uncovers their secret and returns with it…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on science fiction and fantasy for exploring new worlds.\n\nBy Ronald A. Geobey Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhile Dune, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica (1980s), and other SF staples laid the foundation for my love of SFF, I was also reading about the universe from a young age. Along came Star Trek: The Next Generation in the ‘90s and the stage was set. Completing Bachelor’s Degrees in Ancient History & Archaeology; Religions & Theology; and a PhD in Near and Middle Eastern Studies copper-fastened my passion for the ancient world and the history of religion, and along with reading historical fiction and fantasy, everything merged into the almost allegorical universe you’ll find in Kiranis. Lovers of all the above will find something here.\n\nRonald's book list on science fiction and fantasy for exploring new worlds\n\nWhy did Ronald love this book?\n\nI had been reading Heroic and Epic Fantasy for years, and I’d purposely avoided reading Sci-Fi, convinced that it would influence my burgeoning plot development. I wanted to maintain my plot integrity and not be subconsciously led by other authors in the genre (but of course I couldn’t avoid the influence of the SF I watched on TV). Of course, I was missing out on some great writing. I was enthralled by this story—it combined an undead trope with space opera, as the ‘risen empire’ maintains its territory while facing an external threat from the technologically hybrid Rix. There’s a fascination with the potential of biological augmentation and the place of AI in our distant future (consider ‘immortal’ humans against potentially ‘eternal’ hybrid humans), but this story is extremely character-driven and concerned with the place of the individual. The fictional science was breathtaking and not without research, but what stuck…\n\nBy Scott Westerfeld,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Risen Empire as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe undead Emperor has ruled his mighty interstellar empire of 80 human worlds for 1600 years. Because he can grant a form of eternal life-after-death, creating an elite known as the Risen, his power is absolute. He and his sister, the Child Empress, who is eternally a little girl, are worshipped as living gods. No one can touch them. No until the Rix, machine-augmented humans who worship planetary Al compound minds. The Rix are cool, relentless fanatics, and their only goal I to propagate such Als throughout the galaxy. They seek to end, by any means necessary, the Emperor's prolonged…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on peculiar romance.\n\nBy Emily Kinney Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI love weird situations. I have been writing since I was four years old, and have been patiently waiting for the man who appreciates my wide range of vocal inflections. Books have always been companions for me. It helped me develop empathy for others at a young age. Reading about situations that involve people who are nothing like you helps you think beyond yourself. I think that is partly why I’ve always gravitated towards books with unique plots and characters. There’s something invigorating about a story that breaks the mold and offers something new, even if it’s a little strange. The books I’ve recommended all have heavily influenced me and my writing throughout the years.\n\nEmily's book list on peculiar romance\n\nWhy did Emily love this book?\n\nI’m amazed that more people aren’t talking about this book. It falls in line with the vampire romance genre so effortlessly, and yet it is egregiously overlooked. I remember reading it years ago when I was a teenager and being totally entranced. There’s this beautiful lilt to the writing, and the plot is so richly complex. It deals with the subject of immortality in such an interesting way, comparing the endless life of this vampire to the swiftly expiring life of this girl’s mother. The romance itself is actually refreshing as well. There’s this soft, sweet gallantry that you don’t see a lot in modern work, in my opinion.\n\nBy Annette Curtis Klause,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Silver Kiss as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nZoe is wary when, in the dead of night, the beautiful yet frightening Simon comes to her house. Simon seems to understand the pain of loneliness and death and Zoe's brooding thoughts of her dying mother.\n\nSimon is one of the undead, a vampire, seeking revenge for the gruesome death of his mother three hundred years before. Does Simon dare ask Zoe to help free him from this lifeless chase and its insufferable loneliness?\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on bad guys who will steal your heart.\n\nBy Shea Swain Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs a lover of all things love and being a published author who has read and watched countless romance books and movies, I wanted to recommend bad/gray characters who have stolen my heart because it’s not easy writing a bad guy who deserves your undying love. Most think a bad guy should redeem himself. I believe some should but I also believed some should remain as they are, bad and proud. If I can write a dark character who can steal your heart, then I’ve won a fan for life. Even through bad guys, we can learn life lessons. So, embrace the dark souls in my recs and the ones I’ve written.\n\nShea's book list on bad guys who will steal your heart\n\nWhy did Shea love this book?\n\nLothaire features a Vampire on the brink of madness with revenge in mind. He is known as the Lothaire the Enemy of Old because he’s been around for hundreds of years. He was tortured and has done bad things to get what he wants and that is the throne. Who doesn’t love a revenge story? I love them but ones with a love interest he must kill to gain his goal when he is deeply attracted to her, is rough. I love a bad guy, especially one who really has little care for redemption, and that is Lothaire.\n\nBy Kresley Cole,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Lothaire as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom the humblest of beginnings a millennia ago, Lothaire the Enemy of Old rose to power, becoming the most feared and evil vampire in the immortal world. Driven by his past, he will not rest until he captures the vampire Horde's crown for himself. The discovery of his Bride, the female meant only for him, threatens to derail his plot.\n\nElizabeth Peirce is a mere mortal, a glaring vulnerability for a male with so many deadly foes bent on annihilating anything he desires. Yet soon he discovers his Bride's secret. A magnificent power dwells inside the fragile human, one that…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on middle grade magic and the supernatural.\n\nBy Kelly Fernández Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy name is Kelly Fernández (she/her) and I’ve been making comics since 2014. I’vealways been fascinated by stories about ghosts, monsters, and witches because I grewup in a family that believes in them. While writing my graphic novel Manu,Iresearchedand spoke to Latinx friends and colleagues about their personal experiences withbrujería (the Spanish word for witchcraft) to try and learn more about it across differentcultures. I love comics because, like oral storytelling, it’s just another way for people toshare their stories with each other!\n\nKelly's book list on middle grade magic and the supernatural\n\nWhy did Kelly love this book?\n\nI really enjoy McGrane’s sense of humor in both her illustrations and storytelling. I definitely wasn’t expecting to cry at the end, but I did! I truly felt for Dragoslav, who is a vampire child struggling with friendships, fears, and trusting people (especially the adults in their life).

Parker Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve experienced vivid dreams ever since I was a child, which led me to begin reading about the metaphysical universe at an early age, obsessed with anything and everything “unknown.” It is truly fascinating how various themes like paranormal activity, magic, the afterlife, reincarnation, and spiritual beliefs can all tie into one another. Yet, there aren’t many books that intertwine all the subjects into one. I truly believe that although every topic is vastly unique in certain aspects, they share similarities and can all be connected. I am a multi-genre author, however writing in this area is my passion.\n\nStevie's book list on Metaphysical expand your knowledge and imagination\n\nWhy did Stevie love this book?\n\nI typically enjoy books with well-defined characters and distinctive voices that I relate to. Rea Nolan Martin brilliantly uses a writing technique that is sometimes difficult to pull off. I loved that the story is told from the viewpoint of each character. I was particularly drawn to the interplay between the main character, Maya, and the voice in her head of her alleged “twin,” Maya.\n\nThis book had me thinking about the mysteries of life. There are not enough books with a \"moral to the story.\" This one has a number, but you may need to read it closely to catch them all.\n\nBy V. E. Schwab,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n16 authors picked The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"For someone damned to be forgettable, Addie LaRue is a most delightfully unforgettable character, and her story is the most joyous evocation of unlikely immortality.\" -Neil Gaiman\n\nA Sunday Times-bestselling, award-nominated genre-defying tour-de-force of Faustian bargains, for fans of The Time Traveler's Wife and Life After Life, and The Sudden Appearance of Hope.\n\nWhen Addie La Rue makes a pact with the devil, she is convinced she's found a loophole-immortality in exchange for her soul.

So I loved this book’s premise that immortality brings its own peculiar kind of stress.\n\nI, too, have wanted to negotiate with God to save someone or something I believed in. I sometimes feel a bad bargain is better than none at all. Naturally, I found it so much more enjoyable to read about two people who actually make that deal with God to save a loved one, only to be fated to life everlasting, constantly veering toward and away from each other in an existence that’s always changing but never-ending.\n\nWith this book, I gained another perspective on being careful what you wish for.\n\nBy Dara Horn,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Eternal Life as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nRachel's current troubles are only the latest in a litany spanning dozens of countries, scores of marriages, hundreds of children and 2,000 years.

I remember reading the epilogue over and over again—it broke my heart to think how the greed of one man could ruin something so magical. I pondered whether it was a blessing or a curse to live forever, and the town of Treegap felt like it could exist in any wooded place. Whenever I find myself in a thick forest, I still search for springs that bubble up from the ground, taking me right back to those emotions when reading this great classic.\n\nBy Natalie Babbitt,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Tuck Everlasting as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.

Or, as in this contemporary novel, for 500 years or more? In his unique style and wit, Matt Haig explores the many pitfalls and heartaches that living an extra-long life poses along with some of the positives his central character Tom must endure. Yes, it is a time-travel story, if at times a little too long and with much inward-self psychology, but one that brings elements of history, real-life characters, and at times shocking revelations by creating a scenario reversing a real human genetic condition, making the reader think: what if?

After reading this novel, I know what my answer will be.\n\nBy Matt Haig,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked How to Stop Time as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFrom the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Midnight Library.\n\n\"A quirky romcom dusted with philosophical observations....A delightfully witty...poignant novel.\" -The Washington Post\n\nHow many lifetimes does it take to learn how to live?\n\nTom Hazard has a dangerous secret.

I enjoyed discovering the different spices tied to each chapter.\n\nIn the beginning, there was a beautiful mythological backstory to becoming a Spice Mistress, which I found both inventive and fascinating.
