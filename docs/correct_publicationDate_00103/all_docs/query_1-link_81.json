Although perhaps that's just because it was very different to anything I'd read before.\n\nI don't read much cyberpunk, but I do like William Gibson and - most of all - Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, which absolutely blew me away.\n\nVince W\n\nTowel Champion\n\nJoined\n\nSep 9, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n5,329\n\nApr 16, 2017\n\n#5\n\nI read these as they came out and enjoyed them immensely. It'll be really interesting to see how Netflix handles this book. If they do well perhaps they might tackle Neuromancer.\n\nDave\n\nNon Bio\n\nJoined\n\nJan 5, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n22,938\n\nLocation\n\nWay on Down South, London Town\n\nApr 16, 2017\n\n#6\n\nI've only read the first - Altered Carbon. I liked it but I guess I didn't like it enough to read any more. I think it described scenes in a very cinematic way and so will make very good TV and translate between media easily. If I remember correctly, apart from the science fiction around swapping bodies, it was really just an old-fashioned private detective story, though I'm not saying that is a bad thing.\n\nwilliamjm\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nApr 28, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n1,037\n\nApr 22, 2017\n\n#7\n\nI read it shortly after it first came out. I thought it was an excellent mix of cyberpunk and noir mystery and Kovacs is a very memorable character. The two sequels were also good, although I didn't like them quite as much as the first book, they did try to explore different settings and bring in different sub-genres but I think the setting of the first book was maybe the best.\n\nvanye\n\nHuman, c.o.

As a very good read and a good laugh at corporate culture by the same author I recommend Market Forces. Also tried his fantasy (The Steel Remains) but somehow could not bring myself to like it.\n\nWerthead\n\nLemming of Discord\n\nJoined\n\nJun 4, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n2,187\n\nDec 1, 2017\n\n#9\n\nNetflix are bringing Richard Morgan's classic cyberpunk noir novel Altered Carbon (and possibly the sequels) to TV. The first season of the show, which adapts the first novel in the series, will air in Spring 2018. Netflix have started releasing teasers and images for it and it looks amazing.\n\nThree GIFs showing some of the set design can be seen here.\n\nA fake in-universe advert and four short teaser clips can be seen here.\n\nThis looks...impressive.\n\nVince W\n\nTowel Champion\n\nJoined\n\nSep 9, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n5,329\n\nDec 4, 2017\n\n#11\n\nI'm really looking forward to this one.\n\nCli-Fi\n\nJohn J.

Looks faithful to the book and 2nd Feb. I didn't expect it so soon.\n\nIs it worth reading the sequel books? I haven't, and in other threads people here were lukewarm about them so I never bothered.\n\nConnavar\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nApr 1, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n8,411\n\nJan 12, 2018\n\n#15\n\nFull Trailer.

It would be awesome feeling like when they are great faithful adaptation of Daredevil who was my alltime fav superhero.\n\nLooks very faithful, Netflix is at great spending real money on budget, talented actors.\n\nConnavar\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nApr 1, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n8,411\n\nJan 12, 2018\n\n#16\n\nIt looks good.

I haven't, and in other threads people here were lukewarm about them so I never bothered.\n\nThe reviews the sequels are not lukewarm overall, its just the second novel Broken Angels is vastly different from the first great modern classic greatness of cyberpunkish, noiris story of Altered Carbon. The second novel is more serious military SF that is similar to special soldier days of Kovacs that is mentioned in the first. The third book is almost as strong as the first, more similar in themes, story."
