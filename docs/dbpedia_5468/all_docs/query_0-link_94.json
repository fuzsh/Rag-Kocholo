Bush CVN 77 was commissioned on January 10, 2009. \"Those who are sitting out there, where I was, 65 years ago, preparing to serve aboard your new ship, I wish I was sitting right out there with you,\" the carrier's 84-year-old namesake told sailors at the commissioning ceremony. \"As you prepare to man this ship, I do know that you take with you the hopes and dreams of every American who cherishes freedom and peace, and you take with you the undying respect and admiration of the entire Bush family,\" he said. The 1,092-foot, 20-story USS George H.W. Bush was decorated with red, white and blue banners for the ceremony at Naval Station Norfolk.
