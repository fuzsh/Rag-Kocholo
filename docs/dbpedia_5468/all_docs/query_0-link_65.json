        "text": "Look at this loser 7 years ago, he spent a few days launching a pet food business and thought he'd become an overnight success He failed to do competitor research He failed to properly price his products He failed to create a thorough marketing plan He failed to ask experts for advice The result? He only made 3 sales in his lifetime. But unlike most losers, he didn't make that the end of the journey for him. He kept failing, but he got 1% better each time. Today, he's still failing. But he's failing at bigger and more complicated problems. Problems that your average loser wouldn't even make it to. At the end of the day, that's what growth is. Experiencing failures and progressing to larger and more complicated ones. #ecommerce #failure #growth\n\nAre you tired of dealing with large corporations that treat you like just another number?
