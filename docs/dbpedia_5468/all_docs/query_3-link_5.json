        "text": "“The call to community is more than just going to church on Sunday. A commitment to community might change the way you think about your Christian friends. Instead of working to impress them with your spirituality or your “edginess”, you might find yourself entrusting them with your struggles. Which might lead to better relationships. Which might lead to you going on mission together. Which is the whole point.” ~ One of my favorite quotes from the Tangible Kingdom Primer.\n\nThis summer Bridge Church is working back through the Tangible Kingdom Primer: An Eight Week Guide to Incarnational Community. It’s a simple study designed to challenge us to intuitively live life on mission for others and to lean in on what it means to be the presence of Christ in my neighborhood and community. One of the basic concepts in the study is the idea of posture, which is defined as “the way a person or community expresses itself toward others.” My personal posture and that of churches in which I’ve been a part of, has often been self-centered, inward focused, and closed off to nonconformists and anyone on the outside. What would it look like for us to posture ourselves and be present with those in the world? What honestly is the posture of your life? Toward the needs of others first or personal safety and satisfaction? The study serves as a daily devotional, with projects to do throughout the weeks designed to allow you to experience life on mission as an individual and group. Tangible, practical, simple, reproducible. Love these concepts which are woven into the entire study. Looking forward to tracking with Bridge Church through the TK primer.\n\nHere are a few resources for those doing the TK:\n\nThe Tangible Kingdom book.\n\nThe Tangible Kingdom video.\n\nTanglible Kingdom Primer Introduction. 17 minute description and training session led by the Author.\n\nOrder the TK Primer and check out other Tangible Kingdom resources here.\n\nFollow the TK guys on Facebook.\n\nHere’s one of my fav quotes from the Primer:"
