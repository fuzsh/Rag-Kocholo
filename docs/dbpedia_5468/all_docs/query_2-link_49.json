        "text": "NEW VIOLA WORKS INSPIRED BY THE PSALMS\n\nThe culmination of a yearlong collaboration between composers and performers representing a wide variety of Christian traditions, this ecumenical project celebrates the unique power of the arts to bring together Christians in fellowship and mutual conversation around our shared love for Scripture.\n\nFor this project, pairs of composers were each asked to write a solo viola composition inspired by a given psalm. Listening to each pair of compositions provides a unique and fascinating way to explore the ways each psalm can be interpreted differently.\n\nOriginally presented in Boston in 2022, I WILL LIFT MY EYES UNTO THE MOUNTAINS is the most recent version of Deus Ex Musica’s series of events that use new music to explore the psalms. These include IN THE SHADOW OF YOUR WINGS and THE BEAUTIFUL WORLD OF HOLINESS, each of which feature new compositions for voice and piano, as well as SEARCH ME, O GOD: a new album (and live event) featuring new works for solo violin written by Jewish and Christian composers.\n\nScroll down to watch the videos, read about each piece, and learn about the composers.\n\nPSALM 121\n\n1 I lift up my eyes to the hills—\n\nfrom where will my help come?\n\n2 My help comes from the Lord,\n\nwho made heaven and earth.\n\n3 He will not let your foot be moved;\n\nhe who keeps you will not slumber.\n\n4 He who keeps Israel\n\nwill neither slumber nor sleep.\n\n5 The Lord is your keeper;\n\nthe Lord is your shade at your right hand.\n\n6 The sun shall not strike you by day\n\nnor the moon by night.\n\n7 The Lord will keep you from all evil;\n\nhe will keep your life.\n\n8 The Lord will keep\n\nyour going out and your coming in\n\nfrom this time on and forevermore.\n\nMARIA THOMPSON CORLEY: Psalm 121\n\nABOUT THE MUSIC:\n\nPsalm 121 helped me through a very difficult period in my life. At the time, I used this Scripture daily to remind myself that God was never asleep; if I just “lifted up my eyes,” no matter what situation seemed about to overwhelm me, I could be certain that I wasn’t alone. Having visited the Rockies many times when I was growing up in Alberta, Canada, I think of mountains as being both towering (evoked by sections in the upper reaches of the viola and the use of arpeggios) and securely grounded (represented by the pedal point on the lowest string). Although the recurring use open “C” is meant to imply a firm foundation, it also literally depicts the feeling of being at a low point, in contrast with sections that “climb higher.” When the “C” is pizzicato, it is meant to illustrate achieving relative stability despite the vagaries of life. I wanted my piece to feel calm and reassuring, while also giving a hint of the anxieties that make us seek God’s assistance, referenced by the slight forward push and dotted rhythms in the middle section. Life will always have ups and downs, but we can achieve peace if we never forget the source of our strength. I hope and pray this piece expresses this message to the listener. - Maria Thompson Corley\n\nABOUT THE COMPOSER:\n\nMaria Thompson Corley began composing and arranging as a child. Since then, her music has been commissioned and recorded by numerous musicians and entities. She is published by Walton, Classical Vocal Reprints, NoteNova, and North Star. An Associate Composer of the Canadian Music Centre, she is known primarily for her vocal music, including short form composed operas for The Decameron Opera Coalition’s first two series, Tales from a Safe Distance and Heroes. She is a co-recipient of Opera America’s 2021 IDEA Grant. Dr. Corley is the music director/organist at St. Thomas Episcopal Church in Lancaster, PA.\n\n“As I read Psalm 121. And I was reminded of my wedding, and of my mothers death. At the former, a boys choir singing Lift Thine Eye (Mendelssohn) as I walked down the aisle. At the latter, my mothers priest reading the psalm as she lay dying. As I listened to this new piece, I thought of God’s constancy in times of joy and sorrow. I think it was the repeated tone around which everything else ascended and descended.” - Comment from listener\n\nJoogwang Lim: I LIFT UP MY EYES\n\nABOUT THE MUSIC:\n\nPsalm 121 is titled as a “song of ascents” to the temple. The narrator(s) first seek help, and soon realize that it is God who helps them. They acknowledge that there are obstacles and dangers on the way. Nevertheless, they are confident that God will keep them from all harm. This harm can be both physical and metaphorical – struggles from the Christian life. Also, the sanctuary - their contextual destination – still stands on the earth, but is spiritually separated from the secular world. While reading this psalm, I came to internalize the text with my experience of climbing mountains and my spiritual life: I, as a living creature, am bound to the physical and earthly realm, and prone to slip and stumble. But during my life, God continuously assures me of his guidance, on the way to the kingdom of God. This piece is my reflection on Psalm 121, and the materialization of my spiritual journey. Unlike real mountaineering, which ends in descending, the beginning section never comes back in the original motifs, for the way of mine is ever ascending the slope. - Joogwang Lim\n\nABOUT THE COMPOSER:\n\nJoogwang Lim (b.1992) is a South Korean composer. His main interest is the fusion between music and other ideas, such as myths, paintings, religious texts, political events, and scientific theories and virtual world. His compositions have been performed by Seoul Gayageum Ensemble, ASEAN Youth Ensemble, Korean Army Training Center Band, Prime Philharmonic Orchestra, Agape Festival Choir, Ensemble mise-en, Splinter Reeds, Sound Icon and MIVOS Quartet. Living in Boston, Joogwang is currently pursuing a doctoral degree in composition with Joshua Fineberg at Boston University. He earned his bachelor's degree in composition studying with Shinuh Lee from Seoul National University.\n\nPSALM 130\n\n1 Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord.\n\n2 Lord, hear my voice!\n\nLet your ears be attentive\n\nto the voice of my supplications!\n\n3 If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities,\n\nLord, who could stand?\n\n4 But there is forgiveness with you,\n\nso that you may be revered.\n\n5 I wait for the Lord; my soul waits,\n\nand in his word I hope;\n\n6 my soul waits for the Lord\n\nmore than those who watch for the morning,\n\nmore than those who watch for the morning.\n\n7 O Israel, hope in the Lord!\n\nFor with the Lord there is steadfast love,\n\nand with him is great power to redeem.\n\n8 It is he who will redeem Israel\n\nfrom all its iniquities.\n\nOUT OF THE DEPTHS by Biljana Bojović\n\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n\nOut of the Depths for solo viola (2022) is inspired by Psalm 130. The use of “ison,” a drone note, is heard throughout the piece, a feature existing in various Orthodox Christian chants but also in Balkan folk music, used to support and enrich the melody. In the middle section, a brief snippet of a vesperal melody in the sixth tone of the Serbian Orthodox chant is quoted. - Biljana Bojović\n\nABOUT THE COMPOSER\n\nBiljana Bojovic is an alumna of Interlochen Arts Academy, West Virginia University, and Butler University. She studied music composition with John Beall, Frank Felice, and Michael Schelle and has participated in composition masterclasses with William Bolcom, Eric Ewazen, Seymour Barab, Paul Chihara, Elliott Schwartz, Stephen Gryc, and many more. Biljana’s compositions have been performed at festivals, conferences, and various recitals throughout the United States, England, Czech Republic, Slovenia, and North Macedonia. Her works are written mostly for solo instruments and chamber ensembles, and often draw inspiration from Balkan folk and Orthodox church music. She currently lives and creates in California.\n\nCANTATA by Carlos R. Carrillo Cotto\n\nI. Sinfonia (\"De lo profundo\")\n\nII. Recitativo (\"¿Quién oh Señor, prodrá mantenerse?\")\n\nIII. Aria (\"Mi alma espera a Jehová\")\n\nIV. Choral (\"abundante redención\")\n\nPsalm 126\n\n1 When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion,[a]\n\nwe were like those who dream.\n\n2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter\n\nand our tongue with shouts of joy;\n\nthen it was said among the nations,\n\n“The Lord has done great things for them.”\n\n3 The Lord has done great things for us,\n\nand we rejoiced.\n\n4 Restore our fortunes, O Lord,\n\nlike the watercourses in the Negeb.\n\n5 May those who sow in tears\n\nreap with shouts of joy.\n\n6 Those who go out weeping,\n\nbearing the seed for sowing,\n\nshall come home with shouts of joy,\n\ncarrying their sheaves.\n\nJosh Rodriguez: como los que sueñan\n\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n\nThe first lines from the ancient biblical Psalm 126, contain a certain nostalgia, \"When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dreamed. [translated in Spanish as \"como los que sueñan\"] Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy.\" However, this remembrance becomes a petition, \"restore our fortunes, Lord.\" The psalmist desperately needs a miracle like the ones he'd seen in the past. This sense of perseverance in faith, of a farmer sowing in tears and waiting for a plentiful future, stands out. It's not blind or passive or despairing. This kind of faith - steadfast yet mundane, diligent yet quiet - challenges my desire for control, for instant gratification and fulfillment. This is the prayer of one who is broken, but hopeful to see new life, like \"streams in the desert.\" (v4) This work, written for Peter Slowik and Deus Ex Musica, concludes with a quote from Brahms's glorious German Requiem, a melodic fragment he used to set the promise in the fifth verse, \"Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy.\" - Josh Rodriguez\n\nABOUT THE COMPOSER\n\nKnown for his energetic rhythms, rich harmonic language, and striking colors, award-winning composer Josh Rodriguez (b. 1982) continues to gain recognition as an emerging composer and collaborator on a national and international scale. Born in Argentina and raised in Guatemala, Mexico and the United States, Rodriguez’s musical imagination has been formed by this bilingual, multi-cultural heritage. He collaborates regularly with theatre and film directors and has received several notable concert commissions in a wide range of musical genres. Rodriguez serves as Associate Professor of Music Theory and Composition at the Collinsworth School of Performing Arts at California Baptist University. https://www.joshrodriguezmusic.com/\n\nJ.A.C. Redford: Psalm 126 - A Song of Ascents\n\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n\nWhen I read this psalm, with an eye to crafting a musical response, the first image that stood out for me was that of awakening from a dream. The dream described is one of sorrow and loss. Dark hints are strewn throughout the text, which refers to sowing in tears, going out weeping and losing a fortune. Nevertheless, the awakened state of the dreamer is one of restoration, laughter and shouts of joy. The Lord has completely reversed the hopeless atmosphere of the night in a daybreak of dizzying, dancing fulfillment. In my music, I’ve tried in the opening section to capture that slow swim to the surface of consciousness that marks the awakening from a dream, with gestures that reference its disordered darkness. This music gives way to a second section in which the awakened one begins to grasp and make sense of the new reality which has greeted him in the sudden sunrise. Finally, the former dreamer rises to dance joyfully and without restraint, like overflowing watercourses in what was a desert. The dream does not have the last word. The Lord does, and that word is restoration. - J.A.C. Redford\n\nABOUT THE COMPOSER\n\nJ.A.C. Redford is a composer, arranger, orchestrator and conductor of concert, chamber and choral music, film, television and theater scores, and music for recordings. Ensembles and artists across the world have performed his work, which includes two symphonies, an oratorio and multiple cantatas and song cycles. There are currently eight purchasable albums devoted to his art music. Redford’s television work includes Coach and St. Elsewhere. He composed the scores for The Trip to Bountiful and Newsies, conducted The Little Mermaid, and orchestrated the scores for Avatar and Skyfall, for which he also arranged and conducted Adele’s Oscar-winning song.\n\nPsalm 46\n\n1 God is our refuge and strength,\n\na very present help in trouble.\n\n2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change,\n\nthough the mountains shake in the heart of the sea,\n\n3 though its waters roar and foam,\n\nthough the mountains tremble with its tumult. Selah\n\n4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,\n\nthe holy habitation of the Most High.\n\n5 God is in the midst of the city; it shall not be moved;\n\nGod will help it when the morning dawns.\n\n6 The nations are in an uproar; the kingdoms totter;\n\nhe utters his voice; the earth melts.\n\n7 The Lord of hosts is with us;\n\nthe God of Jacob is our refuge.[c] Selah\n\n8 Come, behold the works of the Lord;\n\nsee what desolations he has brought on the earth.\n\n9 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth;\n\nhe breaks the bow and shatters the spear;\n\nhe burns the shields with fire.\n\n10 “Be still, and know that I am God!\n\nI am exalted among the nations;\n\nI am exalted in the earth.”\n\n11 The Lord of hosts is with us;\n\nthe God of Jacob is our refuge.\n\nDavid Biedenbender: Refuge\n\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n\nRefuge is a meditation on Psalm 46 and the title comes from the Psalm’s opening line: “God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.” Refuge borrows melodic material from another work I wrote called Kairos, for reed quintet, which is influenced by Byzantine chant. In meditating on this Psalm, I was drawn again to the sonic aesthetic principle of cathedrals: resonance. In cathedrals, resonating the space is an attempt to sonically connect with something massive, something larger than ourselves—the Infinite—with God. The 6th-century poet Paul the Silentiary describes it this way: “human action…brings into presence the divine reaction, the divine voice…in a sense that is the reverberation of the space: After the human voice stops singing, the building continues.” I use the viola’s open strings and natural harmonics extensively to make the instrument resonate as much as possible, hopefully creating the illusion that the melody is ringing in a large cathedral-like space, regardless of where the piece is performed. And it is in this resonance—the liminal space between sound and silence—where I find this line from the Psalm: “Be still, and know that I am God.” - David Biedenbender\n\nABOUT THE COMPOSER\n\nDavid Biedenbender has written music for the concert stage as well as for dance and multimedia collaborations. His work is often influenced by diverse musical experiences in rock and jazz bands as a bassist, in wind, jazz, and New Orleans-style brass bands as a euphonium, trombone, and tuba player, and by study of Indian Carnatic Music. He has been awarded 2018 Rudolf Nissim Prize for Cyclotron, the 2019 Sousa/Ostwald Award, two ASCAP Morton Gould Young Composer Awards (2011, 2012) and the 2012 Suzanne and Lee Ettelson Composers Award. He is currently Associate Professor of Composition in the College of Music at Michigan State University, and he holds degrees in composition from the University of Michigan and Central Michigan University.\n\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n\nWhat life teaches you.. (2022) was written and revised for the wonderful Deus Ex Musica project. The piece was inspired by Psalm 46 which strongly talked about God’s Almighty power and His Greatness. When deciding the Psalm for the project, I was deeply saddened by the Ukraine War and what was happening around the world. People were stressed and feared. I felt like the only solution was praying and waiting on God’s help. Psalm 46 seemed like to provide great solutions for our fear. If God was with us, we would not fall. God could break the bow and shattered the spear. Our God is the Almighty King!! As I was reading through the Psalm, I could hear God’s voice very clearly. His voice was very firm to tell me that I needed to be still and to know that God was with us. What life teaches you.. (2022) is a set of variations from a theme that I would call it as God theme. I wanted to show How God is strongly speaking to us to trust Him when the hardships are around. Throughout the variations, I wanted to express how people are getting far from God and becoming so harsh and rootless without Him. At the end, God theme comes back again to remind us that He is still alive and is with us. - Caroline KyungA Ahn\n\nABOUT THE COMPOSER\n\nEmbracing a wide spectrum of musical styles, Dr. Caroline KyungA Ahn writes music inspired by the natural world.

Dr. Ahn currently works as an Assistant Professor and Artist in Residence at Anderson University.\n\nPsalm 84\n\n1 How lovely is your dwelling place,\n\nO Lord of hosts!\n\n2 My soul longs, indeed it faints,\n\nfor the courts of the Lord;\n\nmy heart and my flesh sing for joy\n\nto the living God.\n\n3 Even the sparrow finds a home\n\nand the swallow a nest for herself,\n\nwhere she may lay her young,\n\nat your altars, O Lord of hosts,\n\nmy King and my God.\n\n4 Happy are those who live in your house,\n\never singing your praise. Selah\n\n5 Happy are those whose strength is in you,\n\nin whose heart are the highways to Zion.\n\n6 As they go through the valley of Baca,\n\nthey make it a place of springs;\n\nthe early rain also covers it with pools.\n\n7 They go from strength to strength;\n\nthe God of gods will be seen in Zion.\n\n8 O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer;\n\ngive ear, O God of Jacob! Selah\n\n9 Behold our shield, O God;\n\nlook on the face of your anointed.\n\n10 For a day in your courts is better\n\nthan a thousand elsewhere.\n\nI would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God\n\nthan live in the tents of wickedness.\n\n11 For the Lord God is a sun and shield;\n\nhe bestows favor and honor.\n\nNo good thing does the Lord withhold\n\nfrom those who walk uprightly.\n\n12 O Lord of hosts,\n\nhappy is everyone who trusts in you.\n\nDelvyn Case: Psalm 84\n\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n\nLonging, fainting, crying…these are the words that strike me when I read this psalm. They are active and powerful – but also deeply personal. They come from a place deep within: a place as mysterious as that which gives birth to the rain and the sparrows. I love how this psalm reminds us that God’s strength is not revealed just through mightiness, but also lowliness – that God’s blessings are both glory and grace, the sun and the shield. My piece attempts to chart a course between these two ways of understanding God. It also reflects the joy as well as the challenge of trying to live a life brimming with trust in the LORD – a life in which God’s righteousness shines forth in our every word we speak. – Delvyn Case\n\nABOUT THE COMPOSER\n\nDelvyn Case, Deus Ex Musica founder, has spent 25 years developing projects for religious and secular audiences that explore music’s power to explore questions of spirituality in the contemporary world. His writings on music, faith, and theology have appeared in The Christian Century, Sojourners, Books and Culture, and numerous online magazines. He has collaborated on projects with the Yale Institute for Sacred Music, Harvard Divinity School, Hebrew College, the parish of St Martin in the Fields (London), and many others. His music has been performed by over 80 orchestras across the world, as well as by the Mivos and Borromeo Quartets, Grammy-winning artists Richard Stoltzman and the Chestnut Brass Company, and the Grammy-nominated Hermitage Trio A graduate of Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Case is Professor of Music at Wheaton College, a secular liberal arts school in Norton, Massachusetts.\n\nSophie Meyer: Fragments\n\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n\nBased on the Septuagint version of David’s psalm of pilgrimage “How beloved are Your dwellings”, the piece enacts the transmutation of the pilgrim’s longing into a foretaste of joy so intense that it takes on the force of memory. Trains of triads, present already in the simple ascending gesture at the outset of the piece, persist throughout the trek across a void of fragmentary emanations. With the expansion of the register, these outward-opening, connectivity-seeking structures precipitate grace notes that express the hesitance and agitation inherent to desire, but which cannot but give way to alignment and eventually fusion with the melody line. - Sofie Meyer\n\nABOUT THE COMPOSER\n\nSofie Meyer, winner of the 2021 Deus Ex Musica Composition Competition, is a Danish composer and violin player. She studied her bachelor degree at the Royal Academy of Music, Denmark and is now pursuing her masters degree in Tallinn, Estonia, under the guidance of Helena Tulve. She has participated in master classes with teachers such as Toshio Hosokawa, Chaya Czernowin, Bent Sørensen and Juste Janulyte and was in 2021 selected to present Denmark at the Young Nordic Music Festival. Her works have been performed in festivals such as International Young Composers Academy Ticino 2021, Mondi Sonori Festival and Festival de Cordes Sur Ciel.\n\nPsalm 42\n\n1 As a deer longs for flowing streams,\n\nso my soul longs for you, O God.\n\n2 My soul thirsts for God,\n\nfor the living God.\n\nWhen shall I come and behold\n\nthe face of God?\n\n3 My tears have been my food\n\nday and night,\n\nwhile people say to me continually,\n\n“Where is your God?”\n\n4 These things I remember,\n\nas I pour out my soul:\n\nhow I went with the throng[a]\n\nand led them in procession to the house of God,\n\nwith glad shouts and songs of thanksgiving,\n\na multitude keeping festival.\n\n5 Why are you cast down, O my soul,\n\nand why are you disquieted within me?\n\nHope in God, for I shall again praise him,\n\nmy help 6 and my God.\n\nMy soul is cast down within me;\n\ntherefore I remember you\n\nfrom the land of Jordan and of Hermon,\n\nfrom Mount Mizar.\n\n7 Deep calls to deep\n\nat the thunder of your torrents;\n\nall your waves and your billows\n\nhave gone over me.\n\n8 By day the Lord commands his steadfast love,\n\nand at night his song is with me,\n\na prayer to the God of my life.\n\n9 I say to God, my rock,\n\n“Why have you forgotten me?\n\nWhy must I walk about mournfully\n\nbecause the enemy oppresses me?”\n\n10 As with a deadly wound in my body,\n\nmy adversaries taunt me,\n\nwhile they say to me continually,\n\n“Where is your God?”\n\n11 Why are you cast down, O my soul,\n\nand why are you disquieted within me?\n\nHope in God, for I shall again praise him,\n\nmy help and my God.\n\nABOUT THE MUSIC\n\nThe opening verse of Psalm 42 has inspired peaceful images of deer by forested streams and gently trickling waterfalls. But deer do not pant because of thirst but rather to cool themselves after fleeing a predator, and the waterfalls in this psalm are “roaring” as “deep calls to deep.” The author – probably David - is living in exile, fleeing his enemies. He grieves the days when he could openly “shout with joy” with the “festive throng.” Sharply taunted by his foes, the psalmist struggles with intense sorrow while admonishing himself to put his hope in the God whose s during times of angst, isolation, and grief is with him in the night, whose “waves and breakers have swept over” him. This psalm timelessly captures role of faith in resilience and hope during times of angst, isolation, and grief. - Dawn Leonore Sonntag\n\nABOUT THE COMPOSER\n\nDawn Sonntag is a Pacific Northwest-based composer, performer, conductor, and writer.

We can hear two contrasting parts: the first, with a melodic character, which is looking for something while the second is a more introspective profile. Both will come these sound plots will find their “salvation”, they will be able to escape the abyss only in the final peace of the piece. Like our soul that hopes in God and only in Him finds salvation. - Christian Paterniti\n\nABOUT THE COMPOSER\n\nAn Italian native, Christian Paterniti (1990) graduated in piano and composition with top marks and honours Encouraged by a search for creativity, he devotes himself mostly to compositional activity, studying with Carmelo Chillemi, John Corigliano, Paolo Vivaldi, Mauro Bonifacio, Azio Corghi, Ivan Fedele.
