        "text": "\"Superconductivity: The Day Before Yesterday - Yesterday - Today - Tomorrow,\" V. L. Ginzburg, Physics - Uspekhi 43, 573 (2000). [A marvelous review of the ghosts of superconductivity, past, present and future, written in the style only Vitaly Ginzburg can create. The reference bibliography spans the entire scientific history of superconductivity to its date of publication.] \"Further Experiments with Liquid Helium...The Resistance of Pure Mercury at Helium Temperatures,\" as reported by H. Kamerlingh Onnes, Director of the Physical Laboratory of the Unversity of Leiden, Commun. Leiden 120b (1911). [Arguably the first report, at least in English, of the observation of \"zero resistance\" in mercury. Because of the unusual nature and vagaries (at least from a modern viewpoint) of \"publication lexicography\" in The Netherlands at the time, it can be difficult to actually sort out the time series of events (hopefully, all this will be sorted out by the 100th anniversary in 2011!). Toward this end, one should also consult the following sources (please observe the inserted comments and Acrobat Bookmarks): Through Measurement to Knowledge (a perspective), KAWA 120b,122b,124c (124c contains the \"famous\" Hg R vs. T plot), KAWA 133a-d (Observation of Ic in Hg, and Tc in Sn and Pb. The detection of relatively low levels of \"critical current\" dashed immediate hopes of lossless transmission lines, which were being touted right from \"t=0\" 1911). For an overall summary of work at Onnes' laboratory from 1910 to 1924, see CL S34b (A good discussion of the experimental apparati available at Leiden (photos of representative equipment can be viewed on the website of Boerhaave Museum)...and an observation that low temperatures do not affect radioactivity!), and CL S50a (Contains the speculation that superconductivity may constitute a new state of matter...but it's in French!). For a review of the properties of liquid helium and \"pre-Hg\" transport measurements (e.g., Pt...we now know that Pt is only superconducting as a powder, 0.02 K), see CL 119, and CL 120a for the low temperature virial properties of argon. CL 160b discusses the superconductivity of Tl and suggests its transport may be \"filamentary.\" Today we call that \"non-bulk.\"\n\nAn Historical Footnote\n\nIn the closing paragraph of 133d, Onnes remarks \"...I wish to express my thank(s) to Mr. G. Holst, assistant at the Physical Laboratory, for the devotion with which he has helped me...\" We now know that it was Gilles Holst who proposed the purification of mercury by distillation and performed the subsequent experiment that first revealed superconductivity. Gilles Holst was thus the \"Georg Bednorz\" of low temperature superconductivity and in today's scientific culture would have justly shared the fame of his better known mentor, as indeed did Bednorz. To be fair, Holst did go on to become the founding director of Philips Research Laboratory and a Professor at Leiden. I find the following remark by the late Vitaly Lazarevich Ginzburg on early 20th century publication ethics quite cogent: \"...Holst himself had not apparently thought of such a demeanor of Kamerlingh Onnes as unjust or unusual. The situation is not clear to me, and for our generation it is quite unnatural; perhaps 90 years ago morals and manners in the scientific community were totally different.\" The upcoming 100th anniversary of Onnes' and Holst's shared discovery will provide an opportunity to clarify the record.\n\nIn that regard, the September issue of Physics Today features a fascinating article by Dirk van Delft and Peter Kes, both associated with Leiden today, The Discovery of Superconductivity, containing copies of Onnes' original notes and drawings of the \"dewar\" system used in the mercury experiments. One is reminded experiments at liquid helium those days were far more challenging than now.] \"Ein neuer Effekt bei Eintritt der Supraleitfaehigkeit (A New Effect Concerning the Ability to Penetrate a Superconductor)\", W. Meissner and R. Ochsenfeld, Die Naturwissenshaften 44, 787 (1933). [(In German) Discovery that when a superconductor is cooled in an external magnetic field, that field is expelled from within the superconductor. It is this effect that differentiates a superconductor from a \"perfect conductor.\"] \"Measurements of the Specific Heat of Thallium at Liquid Helium Temperatures,\" W. H. Keesom and J. A. Kok, Physica 1, 175 (1934). [The first widely circulated report of a first-order jump in specific heat in a \"Type I\" superconductor, a major clue to what would become GL theory.] \"On Supraconductivity I,\" C. J. Gorter and H. Casimir, Physica 1, 306 (1934). [A thermodynamic and phenomenological treatment of the Meissner-Ochsenfeld field expulsion effect, showing that such expulsion lowers the overall free energy and explains the specific heat jump observed by Keesom and collaborators at Leiden. This paper is an anticipation of the Ginzburg-Landau theory.] \"The Electromagnetic Equations of the Supraconductor,\" F. London and H. London, Proc Roy. Soc London A149, 71 (1935). [An empirical reformulation of Maxwell's equations to accommodate the Meissner-Ochsenfeld field expulsion effect. Introduces the key concept of a magnetic field penetration depth.] \"The Discovery of Type II Superconductors (Shubnikov Phase),\" A. G. Shepelev, www.intechopen.com (2010). [In the process of obtaining the original papers of Shubnikov and his collaborators regarding the discovery of what came to be known as \"Type II\" superconductors in 1936. Shubnikov was arrested and executed by the Stalinist police the following year. In the meantime, please read this excellent history of these events by Shepelev.] \"Ginzburg-Landau Theory (Wikipedia),\" Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 20, 1064 (1950). [Can't find the original Russian or a translation...only Wikipedia...sorry] \"Isotope Effect in the Superconductivity of Mercury,\" E. Maxwell, Phys. Rev. 78, 477 (1950); \"Superconductivity of Isotopes of Mercury,\" C. A. Reynolds, B. Serin, W. H. Wright, and L. B. Nesbitt, Phys. Rev. 78, 487 (1950). [Both these papers were submitted simultaneously on 24 March 1950, each becoming aware of the other's work only a few weeks before at an ONR conference. Interestingly, earlier attempts at Leiden in 1922 to observe an isotope effect in Pb, and in 1941 in Germany, failed to give any observable effects. These present experiments suggested the atomic mass, and perhaps lattice vibrations, were a fundamental ingredient in superconductivity.] \"Theory of the Superconducting State. I. The Ground State at the Absolute Zero of Temperature,\" H. Froehlich, Phys. Rev. 79, 845 (1950). [This paper is the first speculation that lattice vibrations might be involved in superconductivity. However, it deals with the scattering of only one electron, and not pairs. It explains the earlier discovery of the isotope effect, although Froehlich was not aware of its existence when he first submitted this paper.] \"An Experimental and Theoretical Study of the Relation between Magnetic Field and Current in a Superconductor,\" A. B. Pippard, Proc. Roy. Soc. (London) A216, 547 (1953). [In this paper, Brian Pippard elucidates a fundamental key concept underlying all BCS-like theories of superconductivity, whether strong or weak coupling.] \"On the Theory of Superconductivity: the One-Dimensional Case,\" H. Froehlich, Proc. Roy. Soc. (London) A223, 296 (1954). [A seminal, but often overlooked paper, of possible relevance to eventual \"room temperature perfect conductor.\" It was employed by Bardeen in 1973 to interpret the, in turned out erroneous, data by the Heeger-Garito U. Penn group claiming observations of superconducting fluctuations in TTF-TCNQ. It does indeed, however, explain the phenomenon of charge density wave (Peierls) transitions ubiquitous to quasi-1D-conductors (e.g., polyacetylene) and a major competitive instability to superconductivity in such structures.] \"Bound Electron Pairs in a Degenerate Fermi Gas,\" L. N. Cooper, Phys. Rev. 104, 1189 (1956). [Cooper's seminal demonstration that an arbitrarily weak attractive interaction between electrons degenerate at the Fermi surface would lead to their pairing. He speculated that such an attraction could arise from lattice vibrations.] \"On the Magnetic Properties of Superconductors of the Second Group,\" A. A. Abrikosov, Sov. Phys. JETP 5, 1174 (1957). [Abrikosov's elaboration of the two solutions to the G-L equations depending on the magnitude of the parameter \"kappa\" which, when less than 1/âˆš2, leads to the formation of vortices and all the physics we associate with Type II superconductors. See the article by Berlingcourt for the fascinating pre- and post Cold War story of Type II superconductors.] \"Theory of Superconductivity,\" J. Bardeen, L. N. Cooper and J. R. Schrieffer, Phys. Rev. 108, 1175 (1957). [The BCS Nobel Prize paper. Finally, an explanation of superconductivity some 46 years after its discovery. The BCS theory is the crowning theoretical achievement of condensed matter physics in the 20th Century. This paper is also an outstanding review of the past theoretical attempts to explain superconductivity and why they failed.] \"Interaction between Electrons and Lattice Vibrations in a Normal Metal,\" A. B. Migdal, Sov. Phys. JETP 6, 996 (1958). [An important elaboration of BCS which does not use a perturbation approach to treat the electron-phonon interaction. Instead the interaction is renomalized, showing that pairing occurs for all values of the strength of the e-p coupling.] \"Microscopic Derivation of the Ginzburg-Landau Equations in the Theory of Superconductivity,\" L. P. Gorkov, Sov. Phys. JETP 9, 1364 (1959). [A landmark paper proving the Ginzburg-Landau equations can be derived from BCS theory with charge 2e.] \"Comparison of the Macroscopic Theory of Superconductivity with Experimental Data,\" V. L. Ginzburg, Sov. Phys. JETP (USSR) 36, 1930 (1959). [Essentially a comment on the paper of Gorkov pointing out additional \"thought\" must be given when using data on \"small\" samples relative to coherence and penetration depths.] \"Interactions Between Electrons and Lattice Vibrations in a Superconductors,\" G. M. Eliashberg, Sov. Phys. JETP 11, 1364 (1959). [This paper continued the work of Migdal up to a value of the e-p coupling scaled to the ratio of the Debye temperature to the Fermi energy. Combined with the work of McMillan, the two works form the basis of the computational study of strong coupled superconductors.] \"A Research Investigation of the Factors That Affect the Superconducting Properties of Materials,\" GE Report AD480235, 15 November 1965. [The classic GE study done under Air Force sponsorship which contains the first detailed study of hysteretic losses in Type II superconductors, otherwise known at the Bean Model.] \"Structure and Properties of High-Field Superconductors,\" J. D. Livingston, GE R&D Center Report (ca. 1969-70). [Jim Livingston's great little review of critical currents and pinning in Type II superconductors, probably still the clearest exposition of these issues and eerily relevant to anisotropic superconductors yet to be discovered.] \"Transition Temperature of Strong-Coupled Superconductors,\" W. L. McMillan, Phys. Rev. 167, 331 (1968). [The \"practical theory\" of superconductivity which allowed analytically relating the electron-phonon coupling to tunneling spectroscopy, the so-called alpha-2 F(omega).] \"The Problem of High-Temperature Superconductivity, II,\" V. L. Ginzburg, Sov. Phys. Uspekhi 13, 335 (1970). [The original exposition of VL's \"sandwich\" concept as an embodiment for RTSC, better known today as \"Ginzburgers.\"] \"The Description of Superconductivity in Terms of Dielectric Response Function,\" D. A. Kirzhnits, E. G. Maksimov, and D. I. Khomskii, J. Low Temp. Phys. 10, 79 (1972). [An alternative, and in my view, a far more general approach to fermion-fermion pairing than Eliashberg-McMillan which implicitly is restricted to a phonon-boson interaction. It employs a momentum-frequency dependent dielectric function approach (or more exactly its inverse) similar to, and perhaps equivalent, to the Lindhard function (see Andrea Benassi's Thesis). This KMK formalism was used by Gutfreund to analytically examine Bill Little's model for exciton-mediated superconductivity.] \"Transition Temperature of Strong-Coupled Superconductors Reanalyzed,\" P. B. Allen and R. C. Dynes, Phys. Rev. B 12, 905 (1975). [This paper applies an important correction to the McMillan BCS Debye temperature prefactor, involving a logarithmic average over the total e-p coupling as measured by tunneling spectroscopy.] \"Critical Fields, Pauli Paramagnetic Limiting, and Material Parameters of Nb3Sn and V3Si,\" T. P. Orlando, E. J. McNiff, Jr., S. Foner and M. R. Beasley, Phys. Rev. B 19, 4545 (1978). [The appendices of this paper contain a tremendously useful compilation of GLAG equations in various clean and dirty limits.] \"Type II Superconductivity: Quest for Understanding,\" T. G. Berlincourt, IEEE Trans. Mag. MAG-23, 403 (1987). [Probably the definitive history of Type II (hard) superconductors. Especially fascinating are the tribulations of Shubnikov and the complete ignorance in the US of the achievements of Abrikosov due to the curtain of the Cold War.] \"The Critical Current of a Superconductor: An Historical Review,\" D. Dew-Hughes,Low Temperature Physics 27, 713 (2001). [Probably the most up-to-date summary of the most important parameter for applications, next to Tc.]\n\n\"Possibility of Insulator to Superconductor Phase Transition,\" B. K. Chakraverty, J. Physique-Lettres 40,L-99 (1978). [Alex Mueller cites this paper, and the following two, as his principal inspiration to pursue mixed valent charge transition metal complexes as possible hosts for high temperature superconductivity.] \"Bipolarons and Superconductivity,\" B. K. Chakraverty, J. Physique 42, 1351 (1981). [A elaboration of the above paper.] \"Jahn-Teller Effect in Itinerant Electron Systems: The Jahn-Teller Polaron,\" K.-H. Hoeck, H. Nickish and H. Thomas, Helvetica Physica Acta 56, 237 (1983). [Mueller attributes great importance to this paper as pointing to tetragonal symmetry as hosting strong coupling of itinerant electrons to a Jahn-Teller distortion such as found in mixed valent compounds. Quite curiously, several years after the publication of this paper, Hoeck seems to have \"disappeared\" from the scientific scene.] \"Oxygen Intercalation in Mixed Valence Copper Oxides Related to the Perovskites,\" C. Michel and B. Raveau, Rev. Chim. Min. 21, 407 (1984). [This is a very old journal and has a number of continuations. I have not been able to obtain a copy yet. It contains the first Caen paper on LA-4-1-5-13 that Bednorz found.]\n\n[Note added 09/24/2013: Thanks to Eric Hellstrom (ASC Tallahassee), he and his students have found this historical jewel...enjoy and make sure you cite them!] \"The Oxygen Defect Perovskite BaLa4Cu5O13.4, a Metallic Conductor,\" C. Michel, L. Er-Rakho and B. Raveau, Mat. Res. Bull. 20, 667 (1985). [An elaboration of measurements reported in the Revue de Chimie Mineral paper. Shown are the thermopower and resistivity data from 200 - 550 K. Had measurements been made down to liquid helium temperatures, it is likely the Caen Group would have found some traces of superconductivity, especially in the thermopower. Apparently, the main interest of these workers in this material was for catalysis applications and high temperature oxygen sensors for use in, for example, cement kilns.] \"Possible High TC Superconductivity in the Ba-La-Cu-O System,\" J. G. Bednorz and K. A. Mueller, Z. Phys B - Condensed Matter 64, 189 (1986). [The discovery publication. Ironically, Bednorz chose initially the only copper oxide perovskite that's metallic at all temperatures and superconducting at none, but which is extremely difficult to make single phase. It was soon recognized that it was a minor secondary phase responsible for the appearance of superconductivity and they were on their way. There is quite a story behind this paper.] \"Susceptibility Measurements Support High TC Superconductivity in the Ba-La-Cu-O System,\" J. G. Bednorz, M. Takashige and K. A. Mueller, IBM Report RZ 1537, 19 November 1986. [This link is actually to a preprint received on 15 October 1986 by Rick Greene from Alex Mueller (with autograph!). The Zuerich workers, contrary to popular belief, in reality were the first to confirm their own discovery.] \"Susceptibility Measurements Support High TC Superconductivity in the Ba-La-Cu-O System,\" J. G. Bednorz, M. Takashige and K. A. Mueller, Europhys. Lett. 3, 379 (1987). [The paper resulting from the above preprint. Read the note added prior to publication.] \"High Tc Superconductivity in La-Ba-Cu Oxides,\" S. Uchida, H. Takagi, K. Kitazawa, and S. Tanaka, Jap. J. Appl. Phys. 26, L1 (1987). [The first \"outside IBM\" publication to verify the Zuerich Lab discovery ] \"High Tc Superconductivity in La-Ba-Cu Oxides. II.- Specification of the Superconducting Phase,\" H. Takagi, S. Uchida, K. Kitazawa, and S. Tanaka, Jap. J. Appl. Phys. 26, L123 (1987). [A curious paper. Appears to be a \"catch-up\" to cover experiments carried out after submission of the above. ] \"Flux Trapping and Superconductive Glass State in La2CuO4-y:Ba,\" K. A. Mueller, M. Takashige and J. G. Bednorz, Phys. Rev. Letters 58, 1143 (1987). [This is the third remarkable paper out of IBM Zuerich which started the whole subsequent study of flux dynamics in these anisotropic superconductors.] \"Superconductivity at 93 K in a New Mixed-Phase Y-Ba-Cu-O Compound at Ambient Pressure,\" W. K. Wu, et al., Phys. Rev. Letters 58, 908 (1987). [The Wu-Chu discovery of YBCO...but not 1-2-3.] \"Superconductivity Above 90 K in the Compound YBa2Cu3Ox: Structural, Transport, and Magnetic Properties,\" P. M. Grant, R. B. Beyers, E. M. Engler, G. Lim, S. S. P. Parkin, M. L. Ramirez, V. Y. Lee, A. Nazzal, J. E. Vazquez and R. J. Savoy, Phys. Rev. B35, 7242 (1987). [First Report of the \"1-2-3\" Crystal Structure and Material Processing Conditions. More story to follow. Until then, go here.] \"Chu Talk: Woodstock of Physics,\" 1987 APS March Meeting, 3/18-19/1987, Hilton NYC. [Paul Chu's mixed phase discovery engendered the \"Woodstock of Physics.\" Please watch.] \"Mueller Talk: Woodstock of Physics,\" 1987 APS March Meeting, 3/18-19/1987, Hilton NYC. [Pay particular attention to the Alex' last slide...there's an interesting story within his selection.} \"Grant Talk: Woodstock of Physics,\" 1987 APS March Meeting, 3/18-19/1987, Hilton NYC. [What we accomplished in IBM Almaden, San Jose, 4 January 1987 to 4 March 1987. Please watch.]\n\n\"Superconductivity Above Liquid Nitrogen Temperature: Preparation and Properties of a Family of Perovskite-Based Superconductors,\" E. M. Engler, V. Y. Lee, A. I. Nazzal, R. B. Beyers, G. Lim, P. M. Grant, S. S. P. Parkin, M. L. Ramirez, J. E. Vazquez and R. J. Savoy, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 109, 2848 (1987). [The best paper hands down, written by Ed Engler, that came out of the 1987 APS Meeting of March, 1987, the \"Woodstock of Physics.\" This is the first report, which I was honored to give at \"Woodstock,\" on the structure, processing and properties, of the rare earth substitutions for yttrium. There are two retrospective \"blunders\" in this paper. One was the attribution for the lack of superconductivity in Pr-1-2-3 to the absence of the orthorhombic phase, which was due to low oxygen concentration, later the subject of a more comprehensive paper. The other was reporting superconductivity in the Ba-Ca-Sr fractional substitution which turned out to be a blown labeling of samples! What the hell...we were in battle!]\n\n\"Evidence for Superconductivity in La2CuO4,\" P. M. Grant, S. S. P. Parkin, V. Y. Lee, E. M. Engler, M. L. Ramirez, J. E. Vazquez, G. Lim, R. D. Jacowitz and R. L. Greene, Phys. Rev. Letters 58, 2482 (1987). [This was a remarkable discovery. In January, 1987, Rick Greene and I observed zero thermopower at 41 K, a clear signature of superconductivity, in an \"undoped\" sample of La2CuO4 given us by Georg Bednorz, one which was completely insulating! Read the paper to find out what happened. High-Temperature superconductivity could have been discovered in 1954!] \"The Discovery of a Class of High Temperature Superconductors,\" K. A. Mueller and J. G. Bednorz, Science 237, 1133 (1987). [Story of the discovery by the discoverers.] \"Critical-Current Measurements in Epitaxial Films of YBa2Cu3O7-x Compound,\" P. Chaudhari, et al., Phys. Rev. Letters 58, 2684 (1987). [The first epitaxial films of Y-123 were made the evening of Monday,10 March 1987, the week before Woodstock, by Bob Laibowitz, using structural and processing data supplied by IBM Almaden.] \"Orientation Dependence of Grain-Boundary Critical Currents in YBa2Cu3O7-Î´ Bicrystals,\" Dimos, et. al, Phys. Rev. Letters 61, 219 (1987). [This is the famous \"Dimos\" paper that provided the science to jump start the worldwide development of coated conductor, or Gen 2 tape.] \"Remarks at the Federal Conference on Commercial Applications of Superconductivity,\" R. W. Reagan, International Ballroom, Washington Hilton Hotel, 11:47 AM, 28 July 1987. [I was there. One of two (along with Praveen Chaudhari) invited representatives from IBM. Reagan gave an absolutely marvelous speech (he was an actor, and I learned later was coached by Ed Teller and Ralph Gomory. What many deemed unusual was that all of the President's senior cabinet members attended. This was a time when there was a fear the Japanese would again exploit another American technology, as was supposed to have happened with VCRs. A magic moment.] \"Resistive Transition of High Temperature Superconductors,\" M. Tinkham, Phys. Rev. Letters 61, 1658 (1988). [This paper scared the hell out of us when it appeared, because it implied the newly discovered HTSC compounds may not be practical because of thermal depinning of the Abrikosov vortex lattice. Its appearance engendered a column in Science by Robert Poole, \"Superconductivity: Is the Party Over?\" Tinkham concludes that a future room temperature superconductor may indeed be in the superconducting state, but not have zero resistance! This is a great problem for future research.] \"Superconductivity: Is the Party Over?,\" R. Poole, Science 244, 914 (1988). [Column inspired by Tinkham's article supported by some of David Bishop's flux lattice melting work at Bell Labs. The piece quotes a number of industrial leaders to the effect that \"we're not going to quit.\" No major corporation has a superconductivity program today, and one of them that did now belongs to a French company.] \"High-Temperature Superconductivity (History and General Review),\" V. L. Ginzburg, Sov. Phys. Usp. 34,283 (1991). [Written in Ginzburg's delightful wry English style, containing his reflection on the recent discoveries of superconductivity in the cuprates and implications for the future.] \"Superconductivity at 39 K in Magnesium Diboride,\" J.
