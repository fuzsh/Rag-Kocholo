        "text": "Megan McGurk introduces three sparkling pre-Code gems in the Brooks Hotel.\n\nGrab a drink at the bar.\n\nPopcorn is free!\n\nTickets available at Eventbrite\n\nRed Headed Woman (1932)\n\nScreens 12 September at 7.00\n\nJean Harlow leapt to stardom playing an unabashed gold digger (or a ‘sex pirate’ as screenwriter Anita Loos preferred) who never met a man she couldn’t trim. She turns the tables on her married boss (Chester Morris) who assumes he’s in charge of a little office slap and tickle. Harlow lampoons sexual double standards without missing a beat. Keep an eye out for swoon merchant Charles Boyer as the chauffeur.\n\nTrouble in Paradise (1932)\n\nScreens 19 September at 7.00\n\nDirector Ernst Lubitsch set the gold standard for sophisticated comedies brimming with style in Depression-era Hollywood. Kay Francis plays an elegant parfumier who gets tangled up with two swindlers, played by Miriam Hopkins and Herbert Marshall. The ‘Lubitsch touch’ is on tap with the moon in champagne, daring jewel robberies, an obscenely expensive handbag, class upheaval, and a scintillating three-cornered romance.\n\nMurder at the Vanities (1934)\n\nScreens 26 September at 7.00\n\nOnce Florenz Ziegfeld kicked the bucket in 1932, Earl Carroll became the top chorus line producer on Broadway. Carroll developed the story about a backstage murder mystery and took his showgirls to Hollywood. Directed by Mitchell Leisen, a king of woman’s pictures, and costumed by Travis Banton, the musical revues give Busby Berkeley a run for his money. Not to be missed for the ‘Sweet Marijuana’ number.\n\nIn 1933, Betty Compson was robbed at home. The thief stole nearly $50,000 in jewels. She was only one of many stars burgled in a series of Hollywood heists. But by this time in her career, Betty had seen every dirty racket the film colony invented and pledged to get her gems back.\n\nOur new radio play was inspired by a newspaper story.\n\nWhen women ruled Hollywood, gigolos grew on palm trees.\n\nJoin us for the three-part series. Listen here:\n\nPart One\n\nPart Two\n\nPart Three\n\nBetty Compson’s Diamonds is a Sass Mouth Dames production, written and directed by Megan McGurk.\n\nMeet the stars:\n\nClara Higgins plays Betty Compson.\n\nClara is an Irish artist and writer perhaps better known as her pseudonym Mot Collins. Under this moniker, she creates illustrations, zines, and tattoos. Mot is interested in subversive expressions of femininity, sexuality, occultism, and comedy. She is highly influenced by pulp and punk culture. She can be found on Twitter as @heavydutywoman and @motcollinsart on Instagram. She will make her screen debut starring in the short film Sex Pirates of 1931.\n\nOlympia Kiriakou plays Lila Lee.\n\nOlympia Kiriakou is a film historian specializing in stardom and genre in classical Hollywood. She is the host of “The Screwball Story” podcast, and the author of BECOMING CAROLE LOMBARD: STARDOM, COMEDY, AND LEGACY (Bloomsbury, 2020). She is currently writing VIRGINIA GREY: GOOD LUCK CHARM for the University Press of Kentucky. Visit her website The Screwball Girl and find her on Twitter: @thescrewballgrl and @screwballstory.\n\nM. Shawn plays Sally Eilers.\n\nM. is a former television news producer, a writer, a researcher, an accidental homemaker, and a full-time Jean Harlow fan. After a year in quarantine, her blood type is banana bread, and if people were allowed to be fictional characters in a past life, she’d be Blondie Johnson.\n\nSavannah Monroe plays Claudia Dell.\n\nSavannah Monroe is a film writer and historian based in Colorado. Her focus is in the films and women of the classical Hollywood period. She has been researching and writing about Anne Bancroft, her life and legacy, since 2018. Her work can be found through her website Garbo Talks and on Twitter as @garbo_talks.\n\nRenee Smith plays Genevieve Tobin.\n\nWhenever Renee spent a weekend at her grandmother’s house, Nanna, who was a the best seamstress in town, would call Renee to her side to watch “the black and white movies” and point out all the great style. Renee and her sisters loved to play in Nanna’s closet with its furs, hats, lucite pumps and bejewelled bags. So of course she was drawn to Sass Mouth Dames and became a huge fan. Her mildly sardonic spouse and cheeky kids have accepted her recent insistence on wearing classic hats, big wrap shawls and gloves when she walks their muzzled dog, as she struts through the un-classic streets of her neighbourhood in Toronto, Canada.\n\nShane McCormack plays Finnegan Redmond.\n\nShane McCormack is a freelance illustrator specializing in movie and pop culture subjects.Recent licensed work includes Halloween and Ghostbusters. When not drawing he collects physical media especially 1930/40s movies and any Barbara Stanwyck film. He also enjoys photography and has a BA in Visual Art. He’s on Twitter as @mrharrylime. Shane is in pre-production as cinematographer for the short film Sex Pirates of 1931. You can see his work at www.mrharrylime.com\n\nPatrick McGurk plays Chick Gallagher.\n\nPat is a resident of SWFLA, enjoying the proximity to the Ocean and the Gulf. He has been active in community theatre since high school as an actor, director and producer. Pat’s stage credits include such diverse roles as the Narrator in The Rocky Horror Show, Bud Frump in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, Richard III, and various other parts in Shakespeare. He has also directed over 15 shows from Shakespeare to most recently Private Lives by Noel Coward. When not working on a show, or working, you can find Pat on the water with dive gear or a fishing rod.\n\nMegan is a writer and director who carries a torch for studio era woman’s pictures. She has hosted Sass Mouth Dames film club in Dublin since 2017 and the podcast from 2018. She has written and directed ten original radio plays set in the 1930s. She wrote an essay for Criterion on Love Affair. She is on Twitter @MeganMcGurk and @SassMouthDames and Instagram @sassmouthdames. Currently, Megan is in pre-production as the writer and director of the short film Sex Pirates of 1931.\n\nArt design for Betty Compson’s Diamonds by Mot Collins.\n\nSound editing and special effects by Tom O’Mahony.\n\nThomas O’Mahony is a London based Irish Podcast Producer who specialises in storytelling and audio design. He hosts a tattoo history show called Beneath the Skin, and is passionate about how we can use audio to tell new and innovative stories.\n\nYou can find Thomas on all social media @gotitatguineys or contact him for business related inquiries at thomasomahony.media\n\nTom’s podcast is here\n\nMegan McGurk introduces three classic woman’s pictures from Depression-era Hollywood Thursday nights in the Brooks Hotel cinema.\n\nTickets are available from Eventbrite\n\nFaithless (1932)\n\nScreens 2 May at 7.00\n\nTallulah Bankhead plays an heiress who lives on caviar, champagne, and designs by Adrian. She scoffs at the idea of living on the $400 a week her fiancé Robert Montgomery makes in advertising. After the Wall Street Crash, the best laid plans of sables, diamonds, and Monte Carlo go bust, catapulting our heroine into a rapid downward spiral. Tallulah loses everything—her money, possessions, and self-respect. When she hits rock bottom, will Bob Montgomery stick?\n\nThe Richest Girl in the World (1934)\n\nScreens 9 May at 7.00\n\nMiriam Hopkins shares a fizzy rapport with Joel McCrea in a picture that made a bundle at the box office and brought the co-stars together for four more pictures. Playing a savvy scion inspired by Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton, Miriam fends off a shower of fortune hunters who toy with her affections. Since she can’t be sure of any man’s intentions, Miriam switches places with her secretary, played by Fay Wray, to discover if Joel is after her heart or her money.\n\nStella Dallas (1937)\n\nScreens 16 May\n\nDirector King Vidor’s classic three-hankie melodrama captures the way society pressures women to conform within traditional roles. Barbara Stanwyck plays a brassy, fun-loving gal from the wrong side of the tracks who catches the eye of the son from a wealthy small-town family. John Boles falls for her unpolished charm, but as soon as they exchange vows, he tries to smooth her rough edges. Their daughter, played by Anne Shirley, inherits her father’s snobbery, and is mortified by her mother’s loud wardrobe. Barbara Stanwyck’s performance is a belter.\n\nMegan McGurk introduces four pre-Code woman’s pictures starring the MGM queens.\n\nGrab a drink at the bar in Brooks Hotel. Popcorn is free!\n\nTickets available at Eventbrite\n\nPossessed (1931)\n\nScreens 7 September\n\nIf Joan Crawford and Clark Gable had lacked discipline, the heat from their illicit affair might have burned Metro to the ground. Luckily, they kept their clothes on long enough to face the camera for the third of eight pictures they made together. Director Clarence Brown builds a kept woman story into a captivating romance during one of the bleakest years of the Depression. Joan plays an earnest factory gal on the hunt for a rich man as if she was a one-woman Lewis and Clark expedition.\n\nSusan Lenox: Her Fall and Rise (1931)\n\nScreens 14 September\n\nThe picture’s subtitle tells you everything you need to know about the trajectory of woman’s pictures during the 1930s. After Greta Garbo escapes an arranged marriage, she finds refuge with Clark Gable and his German Shepherd. Before long, she’s left high and dry and joins the circus. Then she moves into a Penthouse financed by a sugar daddy politician. Almost every writer in MGM had a crack at the baggy monster of a script which censors found objectionable, but the whole escapade is pure GARBO-going-places.\n\nRiptide (1934)\n\nScreens 21 September\n\nCurrently, Norma Shearer enjoys a reputation for being the great lady of MGM. But during the pre-Code era, Norma was targeted by religious groups for making pictures that they felt glorified premarital sex, adultery, and divorce. In Riptide, Norma follows her heart (or her libido) while wearing what is arguably the best wardrobe (by Adrian) of her entire career. Norma would be stuck in hoop skirts and period costume for the next five years. Will Norma choose Herbert Marshall or Robert Montgomery—and does it even matter when she looks so good?\n\nStamboul Quest (1934)\n\nScreens 28 September\n\nBased on the life of Annemarie Lesser, a famously dissolute spy who was dying in a sanitorium during the film’s production, Stamboul Quest stars Myrna Loy as agent Fräulein Doktor. Myrna is the whole show, playing a character who knows that romance is the Achilles heel for a counter-espionage expert. Myrna has an important job, yet she still falls for soft-spoken George Brent. Gowned to the nines by Dolly Tree, Myrna disproves the old canard about spies darting about incognito in trench coats and anonymous fashion.\n\nStardom. Love. Censorship.\n\nListen back to the new original series and meet the cast!\n\nPart One:\n\nIn 1931, Warner Bros. star Cleo Longe tops the box office in pictures where she gets away with it: no strings sex or sending men to the morgue. One night at a party, she meets Richard Tulliver, a new contract player who is cast as the juvenile in her next production. Cleo coaches him through the part and suggests a new name for his screen billing.\n\nPart Two:\n\nCleo finds a story for her next picture from an unlikely source. From the ground up, she builds the plot, takes a chance on a new screenwriter, casts the picture, and presents creative opportunities for her crew. Meanwhile, Cleo’s romance with Tully takes a serious turn.\n\nPart Three:\n\nDespite her success, Cleo discovers that having script approval in her contract is meaningless once the Production Code is enforced. Under the new rules, Cleo must argue over every page and justify her artistic choices to men who don’t care about the integrity of woman’s pictures. At the same time, Tully’s star rises.\n\nA Star Was Born is a Sass Mouth Dames production written and directed by Megan McGurk.\n\nArt design by Mot Collins.\n\nSound editing and special effects by Thomas O’Mahony\n\nMeet the cast:\n\nClara Higgins plays box office star Cleo Longe.
