        "text": "Betty Compson (March 19, 1897 – April 18, 1974) was an American actress. Born Eleanor Luicime Compson in Beaver, Utah, she had an extensive film career. Her father died when she was young, and she was forced to drop out of school and earn a living for herself and her mother. She obtained employment as a violinist at a theater in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nSilent films\n\nCompson made 25 films in 1916 alone, although most of them were shorts for Al Christie. She completed The Miracle Man (1919) for George Loane Tucker. Compson's rise as a star in motion pictures began with her portrayal of Rose in this production.\n\nCompson in Photoplay Magazine (July 1920)\n\nIn 1920, she began to head her own company. She worked at the Hollywood Brunton studio and acquired three stories for films. Compson returned from New York City where she obtained financial backing for her motion picture productions.\n\nHer first movie as producer was Prisoners of Love (1921). She played the role of Blanche Davis, a girl born to wealth and cursed by her inheritance of physical beauty. Compson selected Art Rosson to direct the feature. The story was chosen from a work by Catherine Henry.\n\nCompson worked for the Christie Company as a newcomer in films, followed by Famous Players-Lasky. After completing The Woman With Four Faces (1923) she signed with a motion picture company in London, England. There she starred in a series of four films directed by Graham Cutts, a well-known English filmmaker. The first of these was a movie version of an English play called Woman to Woman (1924), the screenplay for which was co-written by Cutts and Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nIn 1928, she appeared in Court-Martial as Belle Starr, and in The Barker, a silent movie which contained some talking scenes. Compson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in The Barker. Mainly due to this success, she became one of the busiest actors in the new talking cinema. Unlike a number of other female stars of silent film, it was felt that her voice recorded exceptionally well. Although she was not a singer, she appeared in a number of early musicals, in which her singing voice was dubbed.\n\nLater career\n\nBetty Compson\n\nOne of her most revered films remains The Docks of New York (1928), noted for its dark visual ambiance and superb performances. In 1930, she made a version of The Spoilers in which she played the role later portrayed by similar-looking Marlene Dietrich in the 1942 remake, while Gary Cooper played the part subsequently acted in the later film by John Wayne, perhaps the only time that Cooper and Wayne played precisely the same role. One major film in which she did not appear was Gone With the Wind; although she shot a Technicolor screen test for the role of Belle Watling, she was not cast in the role. Unfortunately, most of her later films were low-budget, even exploitation, efforts, though her acting was always competent.\n\nCompson's last film was Here Comes Trouble (1948). She retired following that film and helped her husband run a business called \"Ashtrays Unlimited\".\n\nPrivate life\n\nLobby card from The Docks of New York\n\nSigned publicity portrait\n\nEarly shot of Compson\n\nStudio portrait\n\n1921 Motion Picture Studio Directory\n\nCompson wed three times and produced no children. From 1924 to 1930 she was married to film director James Cruze. Later she married and divorced agent-producer Irving Weinberg. Her third husband was Silvius Jack Gall. He died in 1962.\n\nBetty Compson died in 1974, of a heart attack, at her home in Glendale, California. She was 77. She was interred in San Fernando Mission Cemetery in San Fernando, California. She left no surviving relatives.\n\nPartial Filmography\n\nSilent\n\nThe Devil's Trail (1919)\n\nThe Miracle Man (1919 Paramount)(lost; short fragment exists)\n\nPrisoners of Love (1921)\n\nFor Those We Love (1921 GoldwynPictures)(lost)\n\nAt the End of the World (1921)(extant; held at Gosfilmofond)\n\nLadies Must Live (1921)(lost)\n\nThe Little Minister (1921)(lost)\n\nThe Law and the Woman (1922)\n\nThe Green Temptation (1922)(lost)\n\nOver the Border (1922)(lost)\n\nAlways the Woman (1922)(lost)\n\nA Trip to Paramountown (1922 Paramount)(extant) (*short)\n\nThe Bonded Woman (1922)(extant;Gosfilmofond)\n\nTo Have and to Hold (1922 Paramount)(lost)\n\nKick In (1922 Paramount)(extant)\n\nWoman to Woman (1923)(lost) directed by Alfred Hitchcock\n\nThe White Shadow (1923)(extant) directed by Graham Cutts\n\nThe Royal Oak (1923)(lost)\n\nThe White Flower (1923 Paramount)(lost)directed by Julia Crawford Ivers\n\nThe Rustle of Silk (1923)\n\nThe Woman With Four Faces (1923)\n\nThe Stranger (1924)\n\nMiami (1924)\n\nDangerous Virtue (1924) screenplay by Alfred Hitchcock\n\nThe Enemy Sex (1924)(survives; Library of Congress)\n\nThe Female (1924)\n\nRamshackle House (1924)\n\nThe Fast Set (1924)\n\nThe Garden of Weeds (1924)\n\nLocked Doors (1925)\n\nNew Lives for Old (1925)\n\nEve's Secret (1925)(extant film;Library of Congress)\n\nBeggar on Horseback (1925 Paramount)(extant)\n\nPaths to Paradise (1925 Paramount)(extant)\n\nThe Pony Express (1925 Paramount)(extant)\n\nCounsel for the Defense (1925 BurtonKing/AssociatedExhibitors)\n\nThe Palace of Pleasure (1926 FoxFilmCorporation)(lost)\n\nWise Guy (1926 FrankLloydProds./FirstNationalPictures)(lost)\n\nThe Belle of Broadway (1926 ColumbiaPictures)(extant; Library of Congress)\n\nThe Ladybird (1927 Chadwick/1stDivisionPictures)\n\nSay It with Diamonds (1927 Chadwick)(survives; Library of Congress)\n\nTemptations of a Shop Girl (1927 Chadwick/1stDivisionPictures)\n\nLove Me and the World Is Mine (1927 Universal Pictures)\n\nCheating Cheaters (1927 Universal Pictures)(lost) remade n 1934\n\nThe Big City (1928 MGM)(lost)\n\nThe Desert Bride (1928 Columbia)(lost)\n\nThe Masked Angel (1928 Chadwick/1stDivisionPictures)\n\nLife's Mockery (1928 Chadwick)\n\nCourt-Martial (1928 Columbia)\n\nThe Docks of New York (1928 Paramount)(*her last pure silent film)\n\nSound"
