Fed up with his abuse, she quits, only to find herself performing as a dancer in a major stage show featuring Gabbo two years later. Though she is now married to a fellow dancer, Frank (Don Douglas), Gabbo makes a play for her. But when she rejects him, his madness returns, and he begins to speak only through his puppet.",
