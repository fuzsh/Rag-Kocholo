Miss Compson is seen as a French actress and dancer. She is seen first as a gay and vivacious young woman and then as one weighted with sorrow, when on the eve of her marriage her fiance is called away and then by a blow on the head by a thug he loses his memory. Opposite Miss Compson is Clive Brook, a picture actor unknown to most fans.\n\nMiss Compson's pictures are always of general appeal. She does splendid work and in this picture she is up to her usual standard."
