        "text": "1st James Cruze\n\nSteven Connor, in his writings on ventriloquism, notes that many narratives about ventriloquism fail to understand that what ventriloquism usually embodies is a \"a more generalized fantasy about the power of ventriloquists to control and animate any space at all, and to theatricalize any and every social encounter into a ventriloquial ‘scene’\", and certainly Gabbo is a man who in his act and his life is obsessed with controlling everything around him. Yet it's telling that the most control he ever achieves is through his doll Otto. The cheery voice he affects for interactions may seem more appealing, but they're never more than a way for him to extend his soft power, alternatively cajoling and insulting to…\n\nOk, so this is just a bizarre film and a classic. Might be the oldest movie I've reviewed so far and definitely the oldest film reviewed so far on Shudder. That's right, Shudder, the niche streaming horror service with a 1920s black and white film about a ventriloquist named Gabbo and his dummy Otto.\n\nShudder's interest, I'm guessing besides the film being \"free\" in the public domain, is that Gabbo is going insane, he's projecting his emotions through Otto, but it's not like other ventriloquist dummy movies that would follow that would be much scarier (Magic, also the episode with Talky Tina in The Twilight Zone).\n\nWhat's unusual about this movie is that it breaks out into full orchestra sing…\n\nNotes on Gabbo:\n\n- Something about one of the earliest talkies being about a ventriloquist talking mostly through (and to) his dummy strikes me as funny.\n\n- I'm fine with the title of this James Cruze horror-tinged drama, but I'm on the fence as to whether it's better than The Rival Dummy, title of Ben Hecht's original story. I think I like the ambiguity of that, I mean Otto the dummy is never really set in opposition to Erich von Stroheim's Gabbo but on the other hand Otto's the only one who has nice things to say to Gabbo's assistant and love interest Mary (Betty Compson), and it's Otto she misses after she leaves Gabbo.\n\n- The most telling scene…\n\nCollab with Ethan Lyon (Ethan, I wanted to preface you with the Great but then realised that would be equating you to an asinine ventriloquist who talks to his dummy, so I decided to skip the titulars altogether) and Stephen M (Stephen, ditto, I will skip the honorifics to avoid the von Stroheim association!)\n\nWhat even was this? Erich von Stroheim is the Great Gabbo, a ventriloquist whose only humanising element is his kinder dummy Otto which sings a song with these lyrics: Ha ha ha! He he he! Ho ho ho! I'm laughing! Written by King Zany and Donald McNamee, according to imdb. They also co-wrote the Lollipop Song from the film. Related films which are recommended on youtube…\n\nSeen in a mini-collaboration with my Letterboxd friends Ethan and Anna. Please check out their reviews here and here.\n\nA curio/oddity from 1929, the first year of talking motion pictures: A hybrid backstage drama/musical featuring Erich Von Stroheim as a delusional ventriloquist (“The Great Gabbo) and Betty Compson as the put-upon love object in his life. It has all the technical awkwardness of the early sound era - staticky sound, stagey atmosphere - but is also fascinating in the creepiness of Gabby and his weird little boy-puppet Otto and the musical revue numbers that belong to a bygone era. It doesn’t always work but it certainly held my interest.\n\nVentriloquism has been around for centuries, but it was a staple…\n\nI think when you watch these old movies context is important. It's almost 100 years old, depression era, and an early talking film. This might have been the only entertainment an average person at the time indulged in, and vaudeville acts were extremely popular. I enjoyed the musical numbers, stunting and dancing. It's also a pre code movie so a rare glimpse into the time. Billed as a horror or thriller movie, it's more of a melodrama.\n\nVentriloquist Gabbo dreams of having a Broadway show with his puppet Otto and in the process of doing so pushes away the love of his life. After making it big he attempts to woo back his ex gf to no avail and gives…"
