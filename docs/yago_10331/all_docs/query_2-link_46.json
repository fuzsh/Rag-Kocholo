        "text": "88% (2) The Docks of New York 76 min, [Crime, Drama, Film-Noir, Romance] [Josef von Sternberg]\n\nRatings & Reviews: IMDb Reviews: 77%, Rotten Tomatoes: 100%, External Reviews\n\nAwards: 2 wins.\n\nActors: Betty Compson, Clyde Cook, George Bancroft, Olga Baclanova\n\nWriter: Jules Furthman (story and screenplay), John Monk Saunders (suggested by \"The Dock Walloper\" by), Julian Johnson (titles)\n\nExternal Links: Wikipedia Rotten Tomatoes IMDb Language: English Country: USA\n\nPlot: Bill Roberts works as a stoker on a coal-red barge. It's dirty, hard work and the men have to put up with a foreman, Andy, who seems to enjoy making their life miserable. When finally off the ship, Bill sees a young woman struggling in the water - apparently trying to commit suicide. He takes her to the Sandbar saloon, the sailors' hangout. The girl is Mae and Bill takes a shine to her but so does Andy. One thing leads to another and Bill asks her to marry him then and there. They don't have a marriage ;licence however and despite Bill promising to get one first thing the morning he decides to leave her behind. When she gets into trouble however, Bill steps in.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: The smokily erotic ambience of Josef Von Sternberg's silent Docks of New York is best appreciated on a big theatrical screen--but only if the available print is at the very least second-generation. George Bancroft plays a two-fisted ship's stoker on shore leave. He saves Betty Compson from committing suicide; though the girl displays little gratitude, the inebriated Bancroft impulsively marries her. After he sobers up, Bancroft is prepared to set sail and leave his new wife waiting for him...perhaps forever. The story is secondary to the virtuosity of the direction and camerawork (one scene is framed in the eye of a needle!) Considered by many to be Von Sternberg's greatest film, Docks of New York is a prime example of the silent cinema at its zenith.\n\nScroll To: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75% [ / 7]\n\n64% (2) The Great Gabbo 92 min, PASSED, [Drama, Musical, Romance] [James Cruze, Erich von Stroheim]\n\nRatings & Reviews: IMDb Reviews: 62%, Rotten Tomatoes: 67%, External Reviews\n\nActors: Betty Compson, Donald Douglas, Erich von Stroheim, Marjorie Kane\n\nWriter: Ben Hecht (story \"The Rival Dummy\"), Hugh Herbert (continuity), Hugh Herbert (dialogue)\n\nExternal Links: Wikipedia Rotten Tomatoes IMDb Language: German, English Country: USA\n\nPlot: An insanely, egocentric ventriloquist, even though he is possessed by his wooden dummy, is in love with a dancer who is in love with another.

The four men call themselves The Four Seasons because of their surnames: there is also Joe Spring, Happy Winter and Pete Summer. Besides joining their group as a violinist, Freddie cooks and cleans for them and even gets them a gig at the Little Aregon restaurant after they are fired for asking for a raise at their old job. She is from the country of Aregon and knows the owner, Mr. Keppel, also from Aregon. When Prince Nicholaus of Aregon pays a visit to the restaurant and recognizes Freddie, he kisses her on the forehead, creating front page news that makes the restaurant famous. Keppel decides to open a larger restaurant because of the increase in business. Although Mike and Freddie love each other, Mike gets jealous at the attention Freddie gives the Prince, and quits the group two hours before the grand opening.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: The first official release from RKO Productions (previous films from this company had been produced by RKO antecedent FBO Pictures), Street Girl afforded Betty Compson to exhibit her considerable skills as a violinist. Compson is cast as Frederika \"Freddy\" Joyzelle, manager and principal attraction of The Four Seasons, a Jazz Quartet. In love with Mike Fall (John Harron), the group's pianist, Freddy briefly and foolishly falls in love with Prince Nicholaus (Ivan Lebedeff), who hails from the girl's home country of Aragon. But by film's end, Freddy and Mike have patched things up and tied the knot. A box-office hit, Street Girl was remade by RKO Radio as That Girl From Paris (1937) and Four Jacks and a Jill (1944).\n\nScroll To: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75% [ / 7]\n\n72% (1) Woman to Woman 82 min, [Drama, Romance] [Graham Cutts]\n\nRatings & Reviews: IMDb Reviews: 72%, External Reviews\n\nActors: Betty Compson, Clive Brook, Josephine Earle, Marie Ault\n\nWriter: Graham Cutts, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Morton (play)\n\nExternal Links: IMDb Language: N/A Country: UK\n\nPlot: David Compton leaves his expecting French girl-friend Louise Boucher, a dancer at the Moulin Rouge, for the war where he looses his memory.
