        "text": "This article from 1926 was first published in Motion Picture Classic magazine in August 1926. It is, on the surface, a piece about the demolition of the old Paramount studios. But there appears to be something more going on here. The Jazz Singer was released just over a year later and, with that in mind, this can be read more as a goodbye to the “old” Hollywood, and the author seems somewhat conflicted about whether those changes are good or bad. The piece starts off rather lyrically, but about mid-way through it becomes little more than a list of who was still acting, who was retired, who was living, and who dead. Not all of the information given was the truth, and my notes at the end try to correct this. The above picture is from the first page of the article in question.\n\nThe Haunted Home of Movie Ghosts\n\nBy Robert Donaldson\n\n(Motion Picture Classic, August 1926)\n\nThe Old Lasky Studio in Hollywood Has Become But a Memory. A New Day – With Its New Demands – Has Dawned. Which Means a Bigger and Better Studio Is Being Erected to Film the Paramount Stories.\n\n“I feel like one who walks alone\n\nSome banquet hall deserted,\n\nWhose Lights are fled,\n\nWhose garlands dead,\n\nAnd all but he departed.”\n\nTHOMAS MOORE.\n\nThe pepper-trees are the same on Vine Street in Hollywood, and even, for the time being, the grey exterior of the wooden two-story office-building that stretches the length of the block is untouched and as placid as ever. To the outward eye, the Famous Players-Lasky studio, for years a Hollywood landmark, is unchanged.\n\nYet its heart is gone, and today it is haunted by ghosts, musing ghosts in film finery, who hover about watching the busy crews of wreckers as they destroy.\n\nFor the old studio is no more. The glass, from the enormous roots over the stages is crashing and falling. A structural steel crane is lifting the great beams from their places and laying them side by side near the street. The floors of the stages, floors that have felt the tread of the panorama of movie great (sic), and have borne the weight of the most lavish sets ever erected by Cecil B. De Mille and Allan Dwan and James Cruze, are being torn up. From one side of the city block to the other, the view is unimpaired, where only yesterday one could not see because of the forest of “sets.”\n\nIt is Moving Day\n\nThe long row of dressing-rooms, which housed extras who became stars, and in some cases housed stars who became extras, has gone.\n\nPola Negri’s bungalow – it used to be Mary Pickford’s in the days when Douglas Fairbanks met and fell in love with her – still stands, and so does Gloria Swanson’s, at the opposite end of the lot. But soon, they too, will fall prey to the wreckers.\n\nThe paneling of Jesse L. Lasky’s private office, where contracts that have meant millions to stars have been signed, has been removed and transported to the new studio. Cecil B. De Mille’s churchlike private office was converted some time ago into a projection-room. If these offices could only talk! – what tales they would tell of fame and fortune, of tears and heartaches, of gambler’s chances that won, and great ideas that failed!\n\nFamous Players-Lasky is moving its studio. A new day, a new need. Their two city blocks in the heart of Hollywood is now too small to handle the immense productions the company is making, and the old facilities have become inadequate. So the United Studios lot, off Melrose Avenue, was purchased. The old Lasky lot had ten acres, the new has sixteen. The new lot will have eleven enormous stages. The old had but six, two of them quite small. While the crash and destruction of the wreckers is heard on Vine Street, the pleasant ringing of hammers is heard on Melrose, where a horde of carpenters, masons and plasterers is preparing the new home.\n\nThe Parade of the Specters\n\nGhosts…ghosts…they pass in Midnight Review, like the return before the eyes of the exiled Napoleon at Elba, of his famous marshals, parading in array victorious before him – for the glory of Napoleon and of France.\n\nGhosts…ghosts of film fame, return to this battle-field once illumined with the flare of sun-arcs and Kleigs, once raging with the fierce competition of celluloid rivalries. Ghosts that muse on the fickleness of popular acclaim, ghosts that bow in defeat before the remorselessness of Age – ghosts here and there that bow before the folly of extravagance and riotous living.\n\nAs the shadows of the pepper-trees flicker across the fence, it almost seems that the notes from Wally Reid’s saxophone can be heard from one of the stages…gay, happy, tragic Wally, grinding out eight and nine pictures a year, continuing work when he had to be carried on the set, forcing a smile, making the executives think it was only another irrepressible gag.\n\nIn the distance seems to move the enigmatic, courtly figure of William Desmond Taylor, whose murder created one of the unsolved mysteries in recent years…and just beyond is a girl in golden curls that he is directing; Mary Miles Minter, another ghost, at the age of twenty-two, her film career ended – because of the tragedy.\n\nJust Memories\n\nJames Neill, the character actor, passes in the flesh. As he looks on the ruins, he murmurs the verse quoted at the beginning of this story – “I feel like one who walks alone, some banquet hall deserted –” Neill played in the very first picture made on this lot.\n\n“What memories! What memories!” he said to me. “I remember the early days, when that old barn at the corner was the whole studio. I owned the only automobile – an old Buick. It was the sole car parked under the pepper-trees of Vine Street, where now there are hundreds. Jesse Lasky walked to work, and so did Cecil De Mille, and Samuel Goldwyn. Dustin Farnum, the star, owned a car in New York, but he hadn’t brought it with him. The studio, for its location trips, had three old Pope-Hartfords. Later, Mr. Lasky purchased a small foreign car.\n\nDustin Farnum! Why, isn’t that his name on the Orpheum 24-sheet across the street, advertising him in The Littlest Rebel[1]?\n\nDustin Farnum, the man who missed an opportunity to make a million on this very spot! He and Lasky and De Mille and Goldwyn were the original four partners in the concern. The other three put in $5,000 apiece. Farnum was to get his quarter interest in stock in return for acting in the first picture, The Squaw Man.[2] At the last minute he decided he wanted the $5,000 in cash, and gave back the stock, and the other three took it reluctantly because they had a hard time finding the $5,000. Today, if Farnum had retained the stock, it would be worth more than $1,000,000, not to speak of the many dividends. But he took the $5,000…and is still playing on the Orpheum, so the billboard says.\n\nOnward Stalk the Shadows\n\nIn the tide of traffic that swirls by, one sees another ghost, a chastened, somewhat shrunken ghost with a serious face, who passes in an unobtrusive inexpensive car. He casts a pondering glance at the partially demolished studio. Whatever may be his thoughts, they are well hidden behind the immobile mask of his countenance. It is Fatty Arbuckle, and the door which he is now hurrying past is the same to which he used to drive with a grand flourish in a red-and-gold custom-built automobile. Today he is on his way the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lot, where he is directing under the name of William Goodrich.\n\nGhosts of dead heroes and heroines, of men and women who laughed and loved in the celluloid world of make-believe, haunt the spot. Most of them worked there, all of them knew it as a landmark: Edward S. Abeles, Harry Woodruff, Bobby Harron, Alan Holubar, the director, all dead. Glorious Barbara La Marr, who died at the pinnacle of her fame; Harold Lockwood, victim of the “flu” epidemic, and brave Larry Paton, who paid the price in France. Arthur Johnson and John Bunny passed away before the studio was well known, but Bunny’s leading lady, Flora Finch, recently appeared in a small role in Gloria Swanson’s latest Paramount Picture.[3] Charles Ogle, the character actor, is retired and living at Long Beach, California. He has no telephone – because the casting directors insist on trying to lure him back to the screen.[4]\n\nFill the Cup and Toast Them\n\nHow the ghost names haunt his famous world of filmdom! Like Napoleon’s conquering army, the ranks are always full, for as soon as one hero falls, another steps in to fill the gap!\n\nFlorence Turner stopped a moment on the avenue to look at the scene of destruction. Once a shining light of movie stardom, she recently returned to the screen in mother rôles.[5] Moths in the flame…\n\nRuth Roland, the heroine of the thrillers, dressed in a chic business suit, slows down in her car to pay passing tribute. She is on her way to close a big business deal, for Ruth is now a real-estate operator of note in Los Angeles. Her name is posted on countless lots in the city.\n\nBryant Washburn enters the gates – on his way to hold a short conference with Raymond Griffith. Five years ago he was a big star on the lot. Raymond Griffith was then an unknown. Today Griffith is a big star – and Washburn recently returned to the screen, playing a second lead in support of Griffith.[6]\n\n“Life’s all right – as long as you have a sense of humor,” he smiled in passing.\n\nTime Was When…\n\nThe faint ghostly trilling of soprano notes recalls Geraldine Farrar, as famous in pictures as she was on the operatic stage. She is now in retirement so far as both arts go, and is living at Ridgefield, New Jersey.[7]\n\nA shadow from the land of the Rising Sun is Sessue Hayakawa, who recently returned to this country from France, where he has been making pictures. One he was famous in Hollywood. Today there is a younger generation that scarcely knows him. He is now trying his luck on the stage.[8]\n\nDapper Charlie Chaplin rides by on his way to his own lot. He casts a passing glance at Pola Negri’s bungalow…\n\nA doorway of the star dressing-room building that is being torn down reveals the name of Kathlyn Williams…she has retired from the screen, and is living abroad with her husband, Charles Eyton.[9] Another doorway reveals that name of Betty Compson, now Mrs. James Cruze. She is now featured in all-star casts…but her friends are predicting she will come back – to stardom.\n\nIn the Days of the Nickelodeon\n\nMemories…memories…Carlyle Blackwell is in vaudeville in England.[10] Fanny Ward is retired and living in Paris,[11] and so is Pearl White. Maurice Costello is on the stage in this country, but his two beautiful daughters, Dolores and Helene, are “carrying on” the Costello name in the films with tremendous success.[12] James Cruze, once famous as a leading man, and especially famous in The Million-Dollar Mystery,[13] in which his ex-wife, Marguerite Snow, played opposite him, is now one of the big directors, and is filming Old Ironsides.[14] Miss Snow is in vaudeville. Francis X Bushman is still in pictures, having last appeared in Ben-Hur.[15] J. Warren Kerrigan occasionally returns to the screen, as in The Covered Wagon.[16] He is living in semi-retirement in Hollywood.\n\nKing Baggot, Francis Ford, Robert Z. Leonard and Alan Hale are all directors, and Marshall Neilan, once tremendously popular as an actor, is now one of the biggest of directors.\n\nJuanita Hansen, once a Sennett bathing beauty and later a dramatic player, is in retirement.\n\nBetty Blythe is making pictures abroad, tho she is scarcely heard of any more. Mae Murray, another old-timer, is still going strong. Beverly Bayne is only seen at intervals on the screen.[17]\n\nOnce Upon a Time\n\nLois Weber, once a star, and former wife of Phillips Smalley, who played opposite her in most pictures, is the only woman director in the business, and is making a picture for Universal. Smalley is on the stage.\n\nIrving Cummings, an old-time hero, is directing. Mabel Normand, after a time out of pictures during which she was on the stage, has just returned and signed a half-million-dollar contract with Hal Roach. Another old-time actor is now the king of comedy producers – Mack Sennett. Theda Bara, once the vamp of vamps, is now trying to come back as a comedienne.[18]\n\nMabel Van Buren, the first leading lady at the studio, has retired altogether from the screen.[19] So have Edith Storey, Pauline Bush, Patty Darwell,[20] Grace Cunard,[21] Bessie Barriscale, Anita King, Marie Doro and Edna Goodrich. Marguerite Clark is married to a very wealthy New Orleans business man, and is no longer in pictures. Mae Marsh recently made a picture in England, but is now practically retired and living in Flintridge, California.[22] She is the wife of Louis Lee Arms, well-known newspaper man, and has two charming children.\n\nThe Fast Thinning Line\n\nAlice Joyce, once known as the “Kalem Girl,” continues her old-time popularity, and recently appeared in Mannequin[23] and Beau Geste.[24] Blanche Sweet, Marshall Neilan’s wife, is as popular as ever, and is now appearing in Diplomacy, which her husband is directing.[25]\n\nValeska Surratt has retired and is living in New York.\n\nConstance Binney left the atmosphere of the Kleigs some time ago in order to marry a Boston banker.\n\nHenry B. Walthall, famed as the “little colonel” in The Birth of a Nation,[26] after being out of pictures for some time, recently staged a comeback, as did Katherine McDonald.[27] Marguerite Fisher is married and is playing mother rôles and second leads.\n\nBut the passing flicker of film fame, like the verdict between the gladiators and the lions in the old Roman arena, is not always unkind.\n\nMary Pickford is still at the top of picturedom, and so are Doug Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin. Owen Moore, Matt Moore and Tom Moore are still high in popularity. Thomas Meighan, another old-timer, so far as picture history goes, is still at the top of the heap, and Gloria Swanson is a star of stars.\n\nRobert Edeson, Hobart Bosworth, James Neill, William S. Hart, Shirley Mason, Viola Dana, Noah Beery, Wallace Beery, Dorothy and Lillian Gish, are all still receiving the rewards of popular favor.[28] Wallace Beery, after many ups and downs, is firmly established as one of the greatest of them all, vying for honors as a character actor only with a comparative newcomer in pictures – Ernest Torrence.\n\nRaymond Hatton is still keeping the even tenor of his way before for the cameras. Marjorie Daw is still prospering before the Kleigs.\n\nSome of them have passed clear out of the picture – into new realms. For instance, “Broncho Billy” Anderson is now running a string of race-horses at Tia Juana. And “Texas” Guinan, once famed as a picture star, is a witty ad lib. hostess at a New York night club. Elliott Dexter is on the stage, and so is Robert Warwick.[29] Vivian Martin is in musical comedy.\n\nDear old Theodore Roberts, the “grand old man” of pictures, is gradually regaining his health after a long siege of illness, and has just appeared in his first picture in two years – The Cat’s Pajamas.[30] He is now making a vaudeville tour. His big house on the hill, at the head of Vine Street, looks sadly down on the wrecked studio, where he came as one of the first actors, and where his portable garage, which he used as a dressing-room, was moved all over the lot as expansion began to take place.\n\nLike Ships That Pass in the Night\n\nGhosts…ghosts that seem to tread softly in the gathering darkness, ghosts that will soon be homeless, wandering sadly thru a new maze of buildings that will spring up on this site. Store buildings, cold, prosy, unromantic; buildings that will not bask gently under the pepper-trees, buildings that will not hide the glitter and pageantry of filmdom; ghosts that will turn over a dead leaf and poke into an odd corner in hope of finding a faded remnant of the studio glory that was. Ghosts that would not feel easy, ghosts who might even be unknown, should they haunt the bright modern buildings of the new studio where the army of film great, ever recruited anew, marches on and on, down the pathways of celluloid fame.\n\n[1] Farnum was in a stage production of The Littlest Rebel on Broadway between November 1911 and January 1912. The dates of when he was in the production at the Orpheum in L.A. are unknown.\n\n[2] The Squaw Man (dir. Cecil B DeMille, 1914)\n\n[3] No evidence has been found to say that this is true.\n\n[4] Charles Ogle retired in 1926 (the year of this article).\n\n[5] Florence Turner’s break from the screen was between 1916 and 1919 – ending some seven years before this article was written – hardly “recent.”\n\n[6] Wet Paint (dir. Arthur Rosson, 1926)\n\n[7] While she was no longer appearing in staged operas, Farrar continued giving recitals until 1931.\n\n[8] With the exception of Daughter of the Dragon (dir. Lloyd Corrigan) in 1931, Hayakawa made no films in Hollywood between 1922 and 1949.\n\n[9] Williams returned to the screen after a two-year absence in 1927 with Sally in Our Alley (Walter Lang), and continued working steadily through the 1920s. Her last film was released in 1935.\n\n[10] Carlyle made films in the UK until 1930, as well as starring as Sherlock Holmes in a German silent film version of Der Hund von Baskerville (dir. Richard Oswald, 1929).\n\n[11] Actually “Fannie Ward.”\n\n[12] Maurice Costello was still working in film at the time this article came out, and continued to do so until 1928. His filmography resumes in 1934, but mostly in small or uncredited roles.\n\n[13] The Million Dollar Mystery (dir. Howard Hansel, 1914).\n\n[14] Old Ironsides (dir. James Cruze, 1926).\n\n[15] Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (dir. Fred Niblo, 1925).\n\n[16] The Covered Wagon (dir. James Cruze, 1923).\n\n[17] With the exception of an uncredited part in The Naked City (dir. Jules Dassin), Beverly Bayne’s last role for the big screen was Passionate Youth (dir. Dallas M. Fitzgerald, 1925).\n\n[18] Both Normand and Bara only made a handful of films during their mid-twenties attempt at a comeback, and then left film for good.\n\n[19] This was not the case, and she continued appearing in films throughout the 1920s.\n\n[20] Jane (Patti) Darwell would return to film in 1930 and work prolifically until her final role as The Bird Woman in Mary Poppins (Robert Sevenson, 1964).\n\n[21] Grace Cunard had not retired, and worked steadily until the mid-1940s, albeit in supporting (and, later, uncredited) roles.\n\n[22] The Rat (dir. Graham Cutts, 1925). Mae Marsh returned to film in 1931 and continued acting until the mid-1960s.\n\n[23] Mannequin (dir. James Cruze, 1926).\n\n[24] Beau Geste (dir. Herbert Brenon, 1926).\n\n[25] Diplomacy (dir. Marshall Neilan, 1926).\n\n[26] The Birth of a Nation (dir. D. W. Griffith, 1915).\n\n[27] Katherine McDonald’s comeback was not to be. It lasted two films, and she made no films after 1926.\n\n[28] William S. Hart released his final film a year prior to this article being published.\n\n[29] Robert Warwick returned to the screen in 1929 and acted prolifically until 1962.\n\n[30] The Cat’s Pajamas (dir. William A. Wellman, 1926)\n\nThe following article by Grace Halton first appeared in Motion Picture Magazine in October 1924. Along with twenty-seven other interviews with silent film stars, it is reprinted in Silent Voices: Vintage Interviews with Silent Film Personalities, available in paperback and kindle formats from Amazon online stores. The pictures do not originate from the original article.\n\n*\n\nTHE QUESTION OF JACK PICKFORD\n\nAn appreciation of this young star who, if he stood alone, and were measured in the public eyes only by the merit of his work –as an artist should be measured – would accomplish very great things indeed\n\nAuthor: Grace Halton\n\n(Motion Picture Magazine: October 1924)\n\nHe sat there behind a desk in the small studio office-room, and from time to time he lit a cigarette, rather nervously. When he smiled, it was quickly but with no reflection of an inner amusement in his eyes. He talked rapidly, but without ease. I felt that in his mind he was wondering what I would ask him next and wishing quite fervently that I would leave.\n\nOutside the summer sun beat down on the Pickford-Fairbanks lot. The walls of Mary’s old Rosita sets seemed to curl and quiver in the downpour of tropical sunshine.[1] The minarets of Bagdad rose, an eye-piercing blaze of silver against the hard blue of the sky. Only in the shelter of the mammoth walls of Doug’s mediaeval castle, erected for Robin Hood and later serving Mary well in Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall, was there shadow and cool.[2]\n\nAnd, quite wisely, a Pickford-Fairbanks chauffeur had parked one of the family’s Rolls-Royce cars in this grateful shade.\n\nSo Jack Pickford and I sat in the little office – Jack most immaculate in white trousers and well-cut gray coat – and when the riveters, working on a giant gas-tank nearby, did not drown out our conversation with their staccato clatter, we talked of various things.\n\nBut I knew, even as I asked him questions and he answered them obediently, like a little boy who hopes he’ll grade at least eighty per cent in examinations, but rather doubts it, that it was no sort of interview.\n\nOne gets no glimpse of the real Jack Pickford this way. I know, for I’ve met him a dozen times in the last half-dozen years, at parties, formal and informal, at the various dancing places, on transcontinental trains. Times when he was his natural, youthful self.\n\nHe was not himself the other day. His manner was guarded. He was earnestly striving to uphold the dignity of the Pickford family.\n\nHe endeavoured not to arouse interest in himself and in his reactions, veering ever from the personal with talk of Marilynn (sic), or Mary and Doug.[3]\n\n“It’s lonesome around here without them,” says Jack. “Sure.”\n\nHe has a way of saying “Sure,” as tho to emphasize his remarks.\n\nNews had come that day of a decoration upon Doug in Paris by the Ministry Beaux Arts. Two gold palms, crossed, and suspended by a purple ribbon. A great honor for Doug. No actor has ever before received this decoration, which was originated by Napoleon and has heretofore been awarded only to educators.\n\nDoug and Mary “have a new stunt” – thus the conversation continued. They like to go down to the Orpheum sometimes, when they’re here at home. It’s hard on Mary never having a chance to go out anywhere without being mobbed, and at last she and Doug have solved the difficult problem and how to enjoy a peaceful evening at a vaudeville show. They buy seats in the last row on the aisle, dress more inconspicuously and put on dark glasses. Then they slip into the theater after the show has started and out again just before the last act is over. The stunt works fine.\n\nThen – Marilynn. Marilynn Miller, before whom jaded first-night Broadway has bent the knee in homage, more than once. Mailynn of the soft golden curls, the babyish face, the twinkling toes. The adored “youngest star on Broadway.” Jack’s wife.\n\nOf these he will talk.\n\nHe and Marilynn are going abroad later in the summer, he says. Marilynn is to meet Barrie. She’s bringing Peter Pan to the stage in the fall and, well, it seems a good idea to meet Barrie beforehand. It’s an awful responsibility, you know, following Maude Adams in Peter Pan. Sure. Jack likes London. He has lots of friends in London. He lit another cigarette. No – he doesn’t like Paris.\n\nIt is later, perhaps, one remembers that Jack’s first wife, the beautiful Olive Thomas, met her tragic death in Paris, and one senses that Jack has been remembering all the time.\n\nOne brings him back from London – and Paris to the sunshine and heat of the Pickford-Fairbanks lot, the rat-tat-tat of the riveters working on the gas-tank, the light laughter of Marilynn and some other girls playing badminton on the studio court.\n\nJack’s next picture, he says, will be made in New York. Marilynn will be working there, he explains, as sufficient reason why he should desert Hollywood. Young Mr. Dudley is the title of the story and, the plot being conveniently laid in New York anyway, they’re going to shoot everything from the Battery to the Bronx.\n\nHis ideas of what he would like to do in future seem rather vague. The majority of actors, when one has talked to them for one consecutive minute, will tell one confidentially of their burning desire to bring to the screen some certain story or play, to create some certain character known to history or literature. But not Jack Pickford. In the main, his life has been mapped out for him by The Family. One feels that decisions as to what Jack will and will not do, rest with them usually, rather than with himself. Initiative is not developed under such circumstances. One feels also, that if he did cherish a secret longing to create some daring, difficult role, to depart in some manner from the comfortable, even routine mapped out for him, he wouldn’t be apt to say anything about it until he had The Family’s O.K.\n\nIn some obscure way, this irritates me, belonging as I do among those wilful persons who consider him an actor with tremendous possibilities. His work before the camera is stamped with authenticity. He possesses the rare ability to submerge himself in the character he is portraying. He never struts and poses in the well-known Hollywood male star manner. If his wild, primitive mountaineer boy in The Hill Billy isn’t as genuine a portrayal as the screen has seen this year, I’ll eat my fall chapeau.[4]\n\nBut he won’t talk about himself. Facing the interviewer, he becomes inarticulate. He’s not thinking of his work. He’s wondering just what sort of impression he is making on me. He is self-conscious, lacking the egotism on which a less sensitive soul might rely.\n\nThat soul of his has been scarred. He has seen his name in ugly headlines blazed across the world. That slight, nervous body has bent before the storm, and the years have passed. Jack hasn’t forgotten.\n\nAs I say, it was no sort of interview.\n\nI left him presently, and the white-hot glare of the Pickford-Fairbanks lot, with the haughty Rolls-Royce still standing in the thickening shadows of grey stone castle walls, and the silver minarets of Bagdad writing fairy tales unnumbered across the sky.\n\nBut the feeling of irritation persisted. I found myself wishing that Jack wasn’t a Pickford. That he hadn’t the fortunes of Hollywood’s royal family behind him. That the rare, delicate artistry of his work might draw strength from some hardier atmosphere. In short, that Jack wasn’t quite so smothered in The Family ermine.\n\nAfter watching the sensitive play of expression across his face for an hour, it intrigues one to muse on what Jack might accomplish if, freed from all prejudice, he stood alone, measured in the public eye by the merit of his work, as an artist should be measured.\n\nIt is good work, that the boy of Seventeen,[5] The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come, and innumerable other photoplays of the native American type, has given us. To one who watches with somewhat bored amusement the tug-of-war now going on between our middle-aged film heroes and the Latin lads, a Jack Pickford performance with its blending of humor and pathos, provides a welcome distraction.\n\nWe find it within us to hope that some day he may contribute to the screen a truly great performance.\n\n[1] Rosita (Ernst Lubitsch, 1923)\n\n[2] Robin Hood (Allan Dwan, 1922); Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall (Marshall Neilan, 1924)\n\n[3] Marilyn Miller: Jack Pickford’s second wife.\n\n[4] The Hill Billy (George W. Hill, 1924)\n\n[5] Seventeen (Robert G. Vignola, 1916)\n\nWhen people write film lists, it’s generally the “best” films that are included, with their enjoyability not always taken into account. So, here is my own film list (or at least part one of it), in which I highlight some personal favourites. Don’t expect to see many critics choices here; after all, I’d rather watch Final Destination than wade through Barry Lyndon or Metropolis! The films for each decade are in chronological order. And these aren’t my “favourite ten films”, but simply “ten of my favourite films” for each decade. And so, come with me back to the 1910s!\n\n*\n\nThe Land Beyond the Sunset (1912)\n\nThis short film from 1912 is not for those who cry easily at films. Directed by Harold M Shaw, it stars young Martin Fuller as a boy who sneaks away on an outing for poor children to the country. Once there he hears a fairy story about a land where children live happily and feel no pain. At the end of the day, the boy makes a decision which is bound to have you reaching for the tissues. Beautifully filmed and movingly acted, this was released on DVD as part of the Treasure of American Film Archives set.\n\nOld Scrooge (1913)\n\nSeymour Hicks appears on film for the first time as Ebenezer Scrooge, a role he would return to in a 1930s remake. Hicks is perfectly cast here, in the first film treatment of the story to be more than just a series of tableaux based on the novel. The effects are surprisingly good, and this early adaptation is well worth seeking out.\n\nA Florida Enchantment (1914)\n\nOne has to wonder what audiences made of this bizarre gender-bending comedy when it appeared in 1914. After taking some seeds, a woman realizes that her soul changes gender while she retains the same looks. She then proceeds to have a great deal of fun at the expense of others that results in what appear on the surface to be same-sex relationships. Daring for the time, but with a cop-out ending, this has to be seen just in order to realize how barmy some early feature films actually were.\n\nIntolerance (1916)\n\nOk, I confess. I like Intolerance. I can agree with most of the anti-Griffith sentiment out there, but here his love for epic proportions work in his favour and, while the narrative format doesn’t always work, it’s a hugely entertaining failed experiment. There is much more to enjoy here than the sluggish and offensive Birth of a Nation, and much for the eye to take in. Most of all, though, is the touching “modern” storyline which remains as moving now as when the movie was first shown nearly a hundred years ago.\n\nPoor Little Peppina (1916)\n\nAnyone who knows my ramblings well will know that my love for Mary Pickford is not great. That said, this rare little film is both ridiculous from a narrative point of view, and charming from the point of view of characterization, and well worth seeing. Pickford plays a girl kidnapped by the mafia, presumed dead, but then lands up in Italy knowing nothing of her past. When she later stows away to New York she (very) coincidentally finds herself involved with the members of the mafia that kidnapped her in the first place. Jack Pickford has a lovely little cameo as her brother.\n\nVingarne (1916)\n\nThis is Mauritz Stiller’s take on the novel Mikael by Herman Bang, in which an a princess comes between an aging artist and his protégé. Generally thought to be the first gay-themed feature film, but there is a problem in that the nature of the relationship isn’t made totally explicit. Nonetheless, it contains early performances from Lars Hanson and Nils Asther, and Mauritz Stiller pulls out all the stops with a complex structure in which a framing device is used in which the actors play themselves making the film. Confused?!\n\nHimmelskibet (1918)\n\nOne of the first feature-length science-fiction films, this Danish movie directed by Holger-Madsen doubles up as a plea for peace in war-torn Europe. Thought lost for many years, this is a wonderful find. Of course it’s all rather naïve, but it’s also surprisingly entertaining, and the thought of there being a race of peace-loving vegetarians on Mars is much more pleasant than most modern tales of alien life!\n\nAnders als die Andern (1919)\n\nAs a gay man, I could hardly leave out this remarkable film pleading for the legalization of homosexual acts in Germany. Directed by Richard Oswald and starring Conrad Veidt, the film is still remarkably touching even when viewed today in its fragmented form. Sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld helped write the script and appears in the film playing himself. Surprisingly ahead of its time – Victim would be seen as progressive when it tackled a similar theme and narrative over forty years later.\n\nIn Wrong (1919)\n\nThere was a cycle of rural coming-of-age dramas during the late 1910s and early 1920s and, of those that are still in existence, this is one of the most charming. Jack Pickford plays the somewhat lazy but likeable teenager who can’t seem to do anything right, until finally he does and wins over the girl. That’s pretty much it, folks, but this is a delightful character study, and Pickford demonstrates just why he was a box office draw during the 1910s. The vast majority of his work from this period is lost, but this shows just what he was capable of – and there are some lovely moments between him and a mongrel dog as well which are really rather touching.\n\nThe Lost Batallion (1919)\n\nA rarity in that this is an entertaining war film from the 1910s, based on the true story of a battalion fighting in World War I that is saved from certain death by a carrier pigeon that, rather oddly, was then awarded a medal! The soldiers mostly play themselves, and make a good job of it, with the first half of the film being particularly entertaining as they sign up, train and get to know each other. The second half isn’t so successful, but this is still good stuff."
