        "text": "The Pony Express (1925) has a great cast! Story wise it struggles to take advantage of what it has going for it. But a combination of fine performances, especially by Ernest Torrence, Wallace Beery, George Bancroft, Betty Compson & Ricardo Cortez making themselves noticed, and the film trying gallantly to tell as large a tale as it possibly could, this western story turns out quite well.\n\nThias is nowhere as big as Cruze's previous western The Covered Wagon despite having a very standout silent film cast (Ricardo Cortez, Wallace Beery, Betty Compson, George Bancroft). What it does have is that sense of discovery and freedom silent western often allow.\n\nReally hard to adequately review something that has lost half of its original run time. This edited down version of the lost complete film is quite hard to follow and relatively excitement free sans a couple of great shots (overall great cinematic work tbh). I hope to see a better outing from Cruze in the near feature. This was just a mess (albeit one I will give a pass too)"
