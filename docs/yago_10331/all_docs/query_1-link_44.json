        "meta_description": "Vintage original 7.5 x 9.5 in. US double-weight matte photograph of silent film actor and director JAMES CRUZE c.1923. Taken during his association with Paramount Pictures, he is depicted in a close interior shot gazing off-camera. As indicated by a rubber stamp on the verso, this photograph was taken by the acclaimed Hollywood photographer Eugene Robert Richee. It is in fine condition with a light 5 in. vertical crease starting on his right cheek and extending downwards. *\"James Cruze (born James Cruze Bosen; March 27, 1884[citation needed] – August 3, 1942) was a silent film actor and film director. Very little is certain about his childhood and teen years because he told a different story at every interview he granted. Cruze acted in, directed and or produced over 100 films, mainly during the silent era. His first known acting job was at Lubin Manufacturing Company in 1910. He started at Thanhouser Company in 1911 with She (1911), which is where the majority of his body of work was produced, much of it as the leading man. After leaving Thanhouser in 1916, he worked for several other companies as director and producer, primarily for Paramount Pictures, from 1918 to 1938. Cruze struggled to regain his successes of the silent era when sound came to film. His career declined as he descended further into alcoholism, and he ended his directing career at Republic Pictures. He spent the last four years of his life unemployed, before he killed himself in 1942. Cruze was first married to actress Marguerite Snow, and they had a daughter, Julie Jane. They divorced in 1923. He married actress Betty Compson on October 14, 1924.\"*(source: Wikipedia) YM3RB",
