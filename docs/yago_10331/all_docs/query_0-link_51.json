The Vera Cruz middle name came from the battle of Vera Cruz. He was raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but did not practice the religion after his teenage years. Very little is certain about his childhood and teen years because he told a different story at every interview he granted.\n\nCruze acted, directed and or produced in over 100 films mainly during the silent film era. His first known acting job was at Lubin Manufacturing Company in 1910. He started at Thanhouser Company in 1912 which is where the majority of his body of work was produced, much of it as the leading man. He married the actress Marguerite Snow in 1913 and had a daughter by her in 1914. They divorced in 1922.\n\nAfter leaving Thanhouser in 1916, he worked for several other companies as director and producer, primarily for Paramount Pictures, from 1918 to 1938. He married the actress Betty Compson in 1924 and they divorced in 1930. He married Alberta McCoy on 30 June 1941. McCoy survived him, and died in Hollywood on 7 July 1960.\n\nHe is interred in the Abbey of the Psalms in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California.\n\nAs Director (partial list)\n\nAs Actor\n\nFilmography\n\nActor\n\n1923\n\nThe Covered Wagon as\n\nIndian (scenes deleted)\n\n1919\n\nJohnny Get Your Gun as\n\nThe Duke of Bullconia\n\n1919\n\nUnder the Top as\n\n'Foxy' Stillmore\n\n1918\n\nThe Source as\n\nLanglois\n\n1918\n\nLess Than Kin as\n\nJinx\n\n1918\n\nThe City of Dim Faces as\n\nWing Lung\n\n1918\n\nBelieve Me, Xantippe as\n\nSimp Calloway\n\n1918\n\nWild Youth as\n\nLi Choo\n\n1918\n\nThe Hidden Pearls as\n\nKoro Leon\n\n1917\n\nThe Slave Mart as\n\nJack Spaulding\n\n1917\n\nNan of Music Mountain as\n\nGale Morgan\n\n1917\n\nThe Call of the East as\n\nJanzo\n\n1917\n\nOn the Level as\n\nOzmun\n\n1917\n\nWhat Money Can't Buy as\n\nFerdinand Vaslof\n\n1917\n\nThe Web of Life as\n\nTom Wilson\n\n1917\n\nHer Temptation as\n\nWalton Maynard\n\n1916\n\nThe Snowbird as\n\nBruce Mitchell\n\n1915\n\nArmstrong's Wife as\n\nHarvey Arnold\n\n1915\n\nHis Guardian Auto (Short) as\n\nBilly Budd -
