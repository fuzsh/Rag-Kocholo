        "text": "Playing in vaudeville sketches with touring circuits, Compson got noticed by Hollywood producers.[5] While touring, she was discovered by comedic producer Al Christie and signed a contract with him.[6] Her first silent film, Wanted, a Leading Lady, was in November 1915.[7]\n\nShe made 25 films in 1916 alone, although all of them were shorts for Christie with the exception of one feature, Almost a Widow.[8] She continued this pace of making numerous short films well into the middle of 1918 when after a long apprenticeship with Christie, she started making features exclusively. Compson's star began to rise with the release of the 1919 feature The Miracle Man (1919) for George Loane Tucker. Paramount signed Compson to a five-year contract with the help of Tucker.\n\nHer popularity allowed her to establish her own production company, which provided her creative control over screenplays and financing.[8] Her first movie as producer was Prisoners of Love (1921). She played the role of Blanche Davis, a girl born to wealth and cursed by her inheritance of physical beauty. Compson selected Art Rosson to direct the feature. The story was chosen from a work by actress and writer Catherine Henry.\n\nAfter completing The Woman With Four Faces (1923), Paramount refused to offer her a raise (her salary was $2,500 per week), and she refused to sign without one. Instead, she signed with a motion picture company in London. There she starred in a series of four films directed by Graham Cutts, a well-known English filmmaker.\n\nThe first of these was a movie version of an English play called Woman to Woman (1923), the screenplay for which was co-written by Cutts and Alfred Hitchcock. Part of The White Shadow (in which she played a dual role), another Cutts/Hitchcock collaboration. Woman to Woman proved to be popular enough for Jesse Lasky to offer top dollar to return to Paramount.\n\nBack in Hollywood, she starred in The Enemy Sex, directed by James Cruze, as well as the sound film The Great Gabbo in 1929, with Eric von Stroheim--his first sound picture. Compson and Cruze were married in 1925; they divorced in 1929.[9] Her contract with Paramount was not renewed, and she decided to freelance, working with lower-budget studios such as Columbia in The Belle of Broadway and Chadwick in The Ladybird. During this time, she was suggested as a replacement for difficult Greta Garbo in the MGM feature Flesh and the Devil opposite John Gilbert. She eventually worked for the studio with former The Miracle Man co-star Lon Chaney in The Big City.\n\nIn 1928, she appeared in a First National Pictures part-talkie, The Barker. Her performance as manipulative carnival girl Carrie garnered her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress,[10] although she lost to Mary Pickford in Coquette. In Court-Martial, a 1928 silent film, she became the first actress to portray Old West outlaw Belle Starr on film. In the same year, she appeared in the acclaimed Josef von Sternberg film The Docks of New York in a sympathetic portrayal of a suicidal prostitute.\n\nThese films caused Compson's popularity to re-emerge, and she became a busy actress in the new talking cinema. In fact, Chaney offered her the female lead in his first talkie The Unholy Three, but she was too busy and instead suggested friend Lila Lee. Unlike a number of other female stars of silent film, it was felt that her voice was recorded exceptionally well. Although she was not a singer, she appeared in a number of early musicals in which her singing voice was dubbed.\n\nLater career\n\nNow divorced from Cruze, Compson's career continued to flourish, starring in nine films in 1930 alone. However, her last hit proved to be in The Spoilers, alongside Gary Cooper. She was unable to score a success and only secured roles in \"poverty row\" studios.\n\nOne major film in which she did not appear was Gone with the Wind; although she shot a Technicolor screen test for the role of Belle Watling, she was not cast in the role. In 1941, Compson appeared in a small role in an Alfred Hitchcock film, Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Most of her later films were low-budget efforts. Compson's last film was 1948's Here Comes Trouble; after retiring from the screen, she began a cosmetic line and helped her husband run a business called Ashtrays Unlimited."
