High Entertainment by David Robbins argues for a category of cultural production that combines the experimental ethos of art with the accessibility of entertainment.

High Entertainment eschews the specialised, exclusionary language on which art has increasingly come to depend, in favour of a communication model that extends and elevates the pop grammars to which we are exposed from our earliest years.

Bringing together a selection of essays, an interview, and an artwork which explore the development of this framework, this book touches upon four decades of Robbins' engagement with the idea of High Entertainmentâ€”starting from the 1980s, through its moment of clearest resolution with the advent of digital technology, all the way to the present.
