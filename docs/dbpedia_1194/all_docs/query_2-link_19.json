        "text": "Monday August 5th\n\n7:00 to 8:00 pm\n\nA Healer Forged in Fire – a talk by author Cathy Morton\n\nWisdom from the Other Side of the Flames\n\nAre you needing a dose of inspiration? Does a part of you feel forgotten, or are you wondering if trauma has gotten the best of you? Author Cathy Marie Morton will inspire you with stories of how she has found freedom, real joy, and energy to share. Her journey to retrieve the lost fragments of her heart shows us what we are all capable of, and she will share different ways people can mend their own tattered hearts to come home to their authentic selves.\n\nBorn into a loving carnival family, Cathy was badly burned in a deadly fire at age 4. She had to fight to survive again as her father turned to alcohol and abuse.\n\nLonging to heal her heart and her scars, she traveled the world working with master healers. With their assistance, she uncovered her own gifts, while her guides and angels manifested in spirit photography.\n\nCathy’s sheer tenacity, courage and determination helped her evolve into a master healer. Her story is recounted in A Healer Forged in Fire.\n\nCathy Morton is a Crystal Reiki Master/Trainer, drum circle host, crystal grid practitioner and trainer, retreat host, mother & grandmother, and entrepreneur. A 47-year Alaska resident, now an 8-year Ashland resident (living on Alaska Street!)\n\nMonday August 12th\n\n7:00 to 8:00 pm\n\nPoetry Reading – Rachel Barton and Louise Barden read their poetry\n\nRachel Barton is a poet, writing coach, and founding editor of Willawaw Journal. She also serves as an associate editor for Cloudbank Books. Her collection, This is the Lightness, was published by The Poetry Box in 2022. Her chapbook, Happiness Comes, was published by dancing girl press in 2018. Barton’s recent publications include Across the Margins, SALT, SLEET, Cirque, and the Oregon English Journal.\n\nThe poems in Jacob’s Ladder are not so much steps to Heaven as they are portals going deeper into the daily. “What am I supposed to see today?” they ask, which at turns will require hanging out with the dead, dreaming of houses ablaze, or, more frequently, re-considering chores, garden, relationships—while not forgetting clouds, moss, rain. The poems aim to live closer to one’s life. They are ready to walk through the next door. –Richard Robbins, Oratory of All Souls\n\nLouise Cary Barden, a 2023 New Women’s Voices semi-finalist, has won the Lois Cranston Prize (Calyx Journal), Oregon Poetry Association award, the Harperprints chapbook competition, and others. Her poems recently appeared in such journals as Timberline, humana obscura, Willawaw and Cathexis Northwest. Her work is imbued with the imagery of nature as narrated by a self-described tree-hugger whose career indecisiveness led her from college English instruction to advertising and editorial copywriting, and marketing management.\n\nMonday August 19th\n\n7:00 to 8:00 pm\n\nGinny Dean Discusses her novel Changing Lanes in Flagstaff\n\nThree women face their biggest challenge and find the courage to step into uncharted waters.\n\nIt’s a chilly autumn night in the forest of Flagstaff. Rebecca flees from her husband and a deteriorating marriage. Running into the night, she passes Georgia, who stacks boxes at the curb from her recent move to the area. Georgia acknowledges Rebecca without a response and begins questioning her decision to start in a new place with no friends or family and without her son beside her.\n\nRebecca seeks shelter in a popular café, realizing she has taken the first steps into unchartered waters. The café’ owned by Heather, a woman struggling to define the loss of love in her marriage, becomes a focal point for the characters to meet and share the evolving outside world they have found themselves moving toward.\n\nLost loves, new loves, old friends, and new ones become interlaced throughout the engaging and heartfelt story as everyone unravels their choices in the quest for freedom, independence, and empowerment\n\nMonday August 26th\n\n7:00 to 8:00 pm\n\nDeborah Costella of The Cosmic Muffin School of Cookery talks about her new book\n\nFor those who, like Deborah Costella, read cookbooks as if they were the best fiction ever written, this book is for you.\n\nDeborah’s book: One 4-Ounce Serving * A Collection of Food Stories and Recipes, is a collection of short stories based on the supper club gatherings Deborah and her Friends Amid Food, as the group dubbed themselves. While several of the supper club members had unique dietary restrictions, none were deterred from enjoying the kinship found in preparing and sharing meals with one another. Each story is followed with recipes of the dishes prepared at these themed gatherings.\n\nDeborah currently teaches at Cosmic Muffin School Of Cookery, her small but well equipped cooking school located in downtown Ashland, Oregon. And she’s bringing goodies to eat!\n\nComing in September:\n\nSaturday September 7th\n\n7:00 to 8:00 pm\n\nJoyce Maynard talks about her new novel How The Light Gets In\n\nIn this follow-up to Count the Ways, Maynard continues the story of 54-year-old matriarch Eleanor and her family.\n\nFollowing the death of her former husband, Cam, fifty-four-year-old Eleanor has moved back to the New Hampshire farm where they raised three children to care for their brain-injured son, Toby, now an adult. Toby’s older brother, Al, is married and living in Seattle with his wife; their sister, Ursula, lives in Vermont with her husband and two children. Although all appears stable, old resentments, anger, and bitterness simmer just beneath the surface. How the Light Gets In follows Eleanor and her family through fifteen years (2010 to 2024) as their story plays out against a uniquely American backdrop and the events that transform their world (climate change, the January 6th insurrection, school violence) and shape their lives (later-life love, parental alienation, steadfast friendship)."
