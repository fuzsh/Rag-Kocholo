While at Phillips Exeter, he collaborated with Richard Brown, a colleague there, on a high school math text called Advanced Mathematics, an Introductory Course published in 1975 by Houghton Mifflin. The editorial adviser on the textbook was Andrew Gleason, who was David’s adviser when he was an undergraduate math major at Harvard. He then had a 24-year career on the research staff at the Institute for Defense Analyses—Center for Communications Research (IDA-CCR) in Princeton. He exhibited extraordinary creativity and brilliance in his classified work, while also finding time to make major contributions in combinatorics,notably to the proof of the MacDonald Conjecture and to the discovery of conjectural relationships between plane partitions and alternating sign matrices. Working on (and, especially, collaborating on) mathematics gave him enormous pleasure and fulfillment. His last mathematical efforts with his “pals” led to a generalization of Heron’s formula, answering a question that had intrigued Robbins since childhood. David lived in Princeton, where he settled in about 1981, and served for a number of years as a member and then president of the Princeton school board."
