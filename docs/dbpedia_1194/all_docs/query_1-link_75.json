        "text": "The Transformation Gallery Open Call I Regret To Inform You That... About 15 years ago I decided after countless rejection letters to exhibit them as my latest art piece. It felt as a relief and a victory at the same time, taking away the frustration of trying to get an exhibition, a job, grant or to get into a university. The act of creating art is inherently risky and vulnerable. Artists pour their thoughts, emotions, and perspectives into their work, hoping to communicate something meaningful to their audience. When this communication is met with rejection, it can initially feel like a denial of the artist's value or the worth of their work. Rejection serves as a critical reminder of the subjective nature of art. What one person or institution might reject, another might celebrate. This subjectivity is a fundamental aspect of art's beauty, allowing for a diverse range of expressions, interpretations, and values. Each rejection letter can, therefore, be seen as a reinforcement of art's intrinsic diversity, encouraging artists to seek the audience that resonates with their work. For the exhibition I Regret to Inform You That... I invite artists to send in their rejection letters to celebrate their victory over failure. *Every Rejection letter will be exhibited* https://lnkd.in/e__dNrBP Opening 4th of April 18:00 - 21:00 4th of April - 14th of April Friday - Sunday 13:00 - 18:00\n\nDon’t make yourself illusions. Your art doesn’t speak for itself. Even if you think it does… Showing your artwork to someone and hoping they just get it usually doesn’t happen. Most of the time, art needs some explanation for people to fully understand the message the artist wants to convey. In most cases, art requires some sort of explanation to allow the viewer to understand and appreciate your work more deeply. Some of the most common questions fans and collectors will ask about your art are, for example: • What inspired you to create this artwork? • Does it have a message? • What thoughts and emotions went into this piece? If you find it a bit hard to speak about your art, I have an easy-to-follow 3-step process for you to use!

What?! Yes, you heard me right. I don’t mean to say that you should make your beautiful #artwork deliberately ugly. But you should give yourself the permission to make bad art… too. It makes your #artistlife so much easier. Especially, if you are one of those little perfectionists who want everything to be just perfect. Can you relate? Well, I am guilty. I’m definitely one of those. Every time I started a new digital creation in the past, I thought this was now going to be The One. The one that tops it all. My best piece ever. …and then, when it was finished, it was just that: a new digital creation. But it’s ok. You don’t need to create a masterpiece every time you go to the studio. It’s ok to also create pieces of art that are not “so great.” I have a couple of works in my portfolio that I myself don’t even like that much. But it’s ok. I leave them there. We are all on our #artisticjourney and we are getting better every day. So, if you feel pressured by your perfectionism to always produce something great, try and allow yourself to make bad art. But that’s not the only reason. Here are some more reasons why artists should make BAD ART! #artisticinspiration #arttalk #artcommunity #arttherapy #creativejourney #artbusiness #mentalhealthmatters #artlife https://lnkd.in/eMR7CbMD\n\nWhat to do when you sell a work of art online? If it was posted on a gallery page of art for sale, take it down and replace it with something new. A changing selection not only shows you're selling, but also makes sure everything is always for sale on the page. If you posted it for sale on social media and it sells, edit the post to reflect that. If it's part of a group or series that's best presented together, then it's good to keep it that way and not post individual pieces for sale elsewhere."
