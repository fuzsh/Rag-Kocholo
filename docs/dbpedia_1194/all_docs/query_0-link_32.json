Her recording career, launched by O Superman in 1981, includes the soundtrack to her feature film Home of the Brave and Life on a String (2001). Anderson's live shows range from simple spoken word to elaborate multi-media stage performances such as Songs and Stories for Moby Dick (1999).

In 2002, Anderson was appointed the first artist-in-residence of NASA which culminated in her touring solo performance The End of the Moon.

During the 1970s, he directed the Center for Contemporary Music at Mills College, toured with the Sonic Arts Union, and produced and directed Music with Roots in the Aether, a 14-hour television opera/documentary about the work and ideas of seven American composers. Ashley wrote and produced Perfect Lives, an opera for television widely considered the precursor of “music-television.” The stage versions of Perfect Lives, Atalanta (Acts of God) and Now Eleanor’s Idea toured throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States. Dust was commissioned for premiere at the Kanagawa Arts Foundation in Yokohama, and Celestial Excursions for the Berlin Festival. Most recently, The Old Man Lives in Concrete was presented at Roulette in Brooklyn. Ashley's book Outside of Time: Ideas about Music, was published by MusikTexte in 2009. Kyle Gann's biography of Robert Ashley was published by the University of Illinois Press in November 2012.

Cage is perhaps best known for his 1952 composition 4'33', the three movements of which are performed without a single note being played. His major influences lay in various Eastern cultures. Through his studies of Indian philosophy and Zen Buddhism in the late 1940s, Cage came to the idea of chance-controlled music, which he started composing in 1951. The I Ching, an ancient Chinese classic text on changing events, became Cage's standard composition tool for the rest of his life. In a 1957 lecture, he described music as \"a purposeless play\" which is \"an affirmation of life - not an attempt to bring order out of chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply a way of waking up to the very life we're living\".

She has often collaborated with other artists, and her work has been included in and has been the subject of many gallery shows in New York City.

Her first exhibition of hyper-realistic paintings of large-scale daily objects was shown in 1965 followed by a series of paintings executed in grey made from photographs. Photography became central to her research. From 1966 to 1972, she taught painting and drawing at the University of California of Irvine and Yale and in 1969, she turned to more abstract painting and adopted a new technique with graphite pen on paper, drawing the illusion of the work by knot-works of individual lines. She produced a series representing the surface of the moon, the sea, the desert, or the constellations. Her work is regularly shown in the United States and abroad (in Paris, at the Centre George Pompidou, 2006). Her works of art are represented in several public collections and have appeared in numerous publications.

His pioneering work has led to a renewed appreciation of Baroque music in France, notably of the 17th and 18th century French repertoire, which he has introduced to a very wide audience. Born in Buffalo (New York State), William Christie studied at Harvard and Yale Universities, and has lived in France since 1971. The turning point in his career came in 1979 when he founded Les Arts Florissants. As Director of this vocal and instrumental ensemble, Christie soon made his mark as a musician and man of the theatre, in both the concert hall and the opera house, with new interpretations of largely neglected or forgotten repertoire. Major public recognition came in 1987 with the production of Lully’s Atys at the Opéra Comique in Paris, which then went on to tour internationally with much success.

From her early minimalist dance-constructions, through her animal movement studies, land portraits and news animations, Forti has had a seminal influence on her field. For the past two decades she has been developing \"Logomotion,\" an improvisational dance/narrative form. Forti's book \"Handbook in Motion\" was published in 1974 by the Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design and her book, \"Oh, Tongue,\" was published in 2003 by Beyond Baroque Books.

Her work and research deal primarily with the dialogue between body and dress, driven by the idea of having both a physical and a psychological relationship with a garment as a responsive clothing - wearable technology. Prior to joining NTU, Galina thought at Arizona State University for more than 15 years costume design and designed for world renown choreographers in USA, ASIA and Europe. In 1993 Galina left Bulgaria and moved to USA to study at Arizona State University.

She is the founder of Galina Couture in Scottsdale Arizona, where her team develops exclusive collections of one of kind designs.

Her art and design work has been shown in festivals, galleries and museums across United States, Asia,Central and South America and Europe. In 2007 she was nominated for the best design award at Cooper-Hewitt Design Museum.

In 1958 he began studies in art history at Columbia University in New York. The same year he returned to Rutgers for his first solo exhibition while he continued to work in New York, becoming an active figure in the New York art world where he created and staged many of the first “Happenings,” along with artists Allan Kaprow, Lucas Samaras, Red Grooms, Jim Dine, and Claes Oldenburg. Whitman’s performances were rare however, in that they allowed for future recitals, while his contemporaries rarely re-staged performances, if at all. Whitman worked on six projects such as this from New York, to India, to Japan from 1968 through 1981. He has also made several films and incorporated them into his work. These include Window, 1963; Dressing Table, 1964; Shower, 1964; Sink, 1964; and Room, 1974.

(2005)\n\nTerry Winters\n\nPainter, Set & Costume Designer\n\nTerry Winters was born in New York City in 1949 and received a BFA from Pratt Institute in 1971. Over the course of his career Winters has expanded the concerns of abstract art, primarily through the media of painting, drawing and printmaking. Beginning with botanically inspired images and going on to explore biological processes, mathematical visualization, and issues raised by the interaction of information technologies and the human mind, he maintains a strong modernist sensibility that reveals itself in the symbolic figural language he develops in his work. Winters' first one-person exhibition was held at the Sonnabend Gallery in 1982. By 1991, the Whitney Museum organized a major retrospective of his work, which opened at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Since that time, he has been the subject of one-person exhibitions at the Tate Gallery, London (1986); the Detroit Institute of Arts (1998); the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London (1999); the Kunsthalle Basel (2000); the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2001); the Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich (2003); and the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin (2009). Winters is currently represented by the Matthew Marks Gallery, New York. He lives and works in New York City and Columbia County, New York.\n\nCollaborated Repertory:\n\nFive Part Weather Invention (1999)\n\nEl Trilogy (2000)\n\nGroove and Countermove (2000)\n\nJud Yalkut\n\nMedia Artist\n\nJud Yalkut was born in New York City in 1938, graduated from the High School of Music and Art with a diploma in Art, and attended The City College of New York and McGill University in Montreal, Canada.

A resident of the Dayton area since 1973, he was Assistant Professor of Art at Wright State University (where he founded the film and video area of the Art Department), and taught at Sinclair Community College in Dayton, and at Xavier University in Cincinnati.
