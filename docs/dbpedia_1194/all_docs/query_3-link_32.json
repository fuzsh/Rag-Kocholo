Ziglar, 97 of Staunton, passed away at 3:05 PM on Monday, August 19, 2024, at Community Hospital of Staunton. She was born on October 22, 1926, in Staunton, the daughter of the late Joseph and Ricca (Odorizzi) Fortuna.\n\nShe married Edward J. Ziglar on June 28, 1947, he passed away on January 15, 1999. Vi was primarily a homemaker but worked for a time as a clerk at Hefer’s Grocery Store in Staunton. She was also a member of St. Michael Catholic Church of Staunton.\n\nShe was a vibrant presence at the Staunton Country Club where her love for golf and swimming was only surpassed by the friendships she formed. Word has it she achieved the elusive hole-in-one, but verifying this is challenging as many of her friends have already passed through the gates of Heaven. Her smile was contagious and she brought energy and joy to everyone around her. In her younger years, she was passionate about quilting and creating beautiful ceramics, leaving behind a legacy of both art, and warmth.\n\nHer grandchildren were her pride and joy and she showered them with boundless love, cooking, and wisdom. The memories she created with them will be cherished forever; a treasure trove of worth and happiness that will continue to inspire them throughout their lives.\n\nThough she is no longer with us, the stories, lessons, and love remain. She was an amazing person and fought hard until God called her to His glorious home.\n\nViolet is survived by her three children, E. Steven (Bev Hartman) Ziglar, Larry (Virginia) Ziglar, and Susan DeLaurent; four grandchildren, Tracy Morrison, Nicole (Todd) Bailey, Tim (Charlie) Sievers, and Kati (Greg) Harkins; eight great-grandchildren; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nBesides her husband and parents, she was preceded in death by her brother, Dominic (Floriene) Fortuna, and her sister, Delores (Leroy) Hart.\n\nPrivate services will be held at a later date. Memorials are suggested to the Staunton Country Club or to any Staunton charity. Williamson Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements.\n\nShare this story\n\nComments\n\ncomments\n\nDiana (Di) Bond Kilduff, 67 of Maryland Heights, MO, died on Saturday, August 3, 2024.
