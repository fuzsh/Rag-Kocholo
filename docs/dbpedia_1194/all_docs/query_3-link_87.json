        "text": "Candle lit by on April 20th, 2022\n\nDave and I were close friends at North Shore High School in Glen Head, NY. He went to Colgate and we lost touch after he became very ill on a collegiate cruise to India, as I recall. I remember him as being a terrific athlete and extraordinary competitor in everything he did. I would love to hear more about him and his life. If someone would contact me, I would be grateful.\n\nCandle lit by on November 23rd, 2023\n\nMost wonderful PhD. advisor, teacher, and tutor. I worked with Prof. Robbins on my BA and MA thesis, and on my PhD dissertation until his passing. His lectures were riveting, full of energy with an ability to summarise complex, demanding ideas in short, refreshing expressions. Especially his ability to encourage but be fair in his evaluations was unparalleled and rare. He is sorely missed."
