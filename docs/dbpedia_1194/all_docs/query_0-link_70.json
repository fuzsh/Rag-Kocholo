        "text": "The Noble Maritime Collection has announced the appointment of two community leaders to the museum’s Board of Trustees—Heather Butts and Joseph Torres.\n\nBoth new trustees will serve a three-year term where they will support the museum’s mission to celebrate the working waterfront of New York Harbor in the tradition of John A. Noble (1913-1983) and to preserve the history of Sailors’ Snug Harbor.\n\n“Professor Butts and Mr. Torres will bring new energy and ideas to the Noble Maritime Collection as our leadership continuously seeks to create enriching programming for the public in a welcoming space,” said the museum’s Chairman Steve Kalil, President of Caddell Dry Dock and Repair Company on Staten Island’s North Shore.\n\nHeather Butts\n\nHeather Butts is an Associate Professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. She is also the Faculty Course Lead for the Leadership Course at the Mailman School of Public Health. In addition, she holds appointments as an Adjunct Professor in Health Law and Bioethics at St. John’s School of Law and Long Island University Post.\n\nProfessor Butts is the co-founder and Executive Director of H.E.A.L.T.H for Youths, Inc. a nonprofit organization which focuses on college readiness and preparation. Her organization partners with 90 programs each year to help more than 7,000 students achieve their dream of going to college.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, her organization worked on dozens of projects to help the community including turning little free libraries into food pantries; getting resources to under privileged families; organizing several community gardening programs to get fresh produce to those in need.\n\n“I have admired the work of The Noble Maritime Collection for years. I am proud and honored to be a new member of the Board of Trustees and look forward to contributing to the significant work of the museum,” said Professor Butts.\n\n“Heather Butts is a tireless advocate for our community, and the Noble Maritime Collection’s trustees and I are so happy and grateful to have her energy on our team,” said Ciro Galeno, Jr., Executive Director of the museum.\n\nHe continued, “Our relationship with Heather began when she visited the museum and felt a connection to our hands-on work in service to the public, particularly through our education programs. We look forward to deepening that work through the community connections she will foster within Staten Island and throughout the city.”\n\nJoseph Torres\n\nJoseph Torres manages his wealth management practice at Merrill Lynch and serves as Vice Chairman of both the Staten Island Economic Development Corporation and the Richmond University Medical Center Foundation. He currently holds board leadership roles with Project Hospitality, The Richmond County Country Club, Staten Island Community Board 2, The Staten Island Chamber of Commerce Foundation, and The South Shore Rotary Club.\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Torres held directorships with Notre Dame Academy and The Giving Hope Network. From 2015 to 2019, he served as Chairman of Richmond University Medical Center’s successful capital campaign to develop the new, state-of-the-art Emergency Department.\n\nMr. Torres commented, “I am most excited by the Noble Maritime Collection’s ongoing commitment to promoting cultural and educational equity through their maritime educational outreach initiative. Introducing students within underserved communities to lucrative careers within maritime and related industries has a transformative and lasting impact where it matters most. As a longstanding supporter of this local cultural treasure, it is an honor to be invited to serve among Noble’s impassioned staff, trustees and benefactors.”\n\n“Joe has been a supporter of the Noble Maritime Collection for several years, and has always been generous with his financial advice and development recommendations, both of which have helped the museum maintain its modest, but always balanced budget, with which we put to the best possible use for the public good,” Mr. Galeno said.\n\nMr. Galeno added, “Joe will strengthen our team with his knowledge of fundraising and board management, as well as his dedication to fiscal responsibility and the creation of connections between businesses and non-profit organizations.”\n\nThe Noble Maritime Collection, located in a former sailors’ dormitory at Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Building D, Staten Island, is open year round, Thursday through Sunday from 12 until 5 PM. Admission is always by donation.\n\nThis year’s lots include original lithographs by the museum’s namesake, John A. Noble (1913-1983); several watercolor and oil paintings; work in a variety of mediums by noted local contemporary artists; and vintage prints by world-renowned artists including John James Audubon (1785-1851) and Marc Chagall (1887-1985).\n\n“There is no other event on Staten Island quite like the Noble Art Auction,” said Ciro Galeno, Jr., Executive Director of the Noble Maritime Collection. “It is, perhaps, the borough’s biggest annual art sale and one of its most successful non-profit fundraisers. It is also great fun and ever-growing in popularity, for which we are most grateful, particularly as we celebrate this 35th anniversary.”\n\nScott Van Campen, Executive Director of MakerSpace NYC, will return for his fifth year as auctioneer.\n\nThe in-person event will begin at 6:30 PM with an open bar and a light supper. Catering by Framboise, led by Chef Frank Puleo, will once again cater the event with French cuisine.\n\nThe auction will start at 8 PM and will be simultaneously streamed on LiveAuctioneers.com for virtual bidding.\n\nMajor underwriting for the event has been generously provided by Caddell Dry Dock and Repair Company, Mrs. Jean Roland, and Flagstar Bank, as well as other business and community supporters that can be viewed at noblemaritime.org/auction.\n\nTickets are $125 each, or $90 for museum members. Reservations are required. Those who wish to participate on LiveAuctioneers can make a free account to register for the Noble auction. LiveAuctioneers registrations will be accepted through the day of the event on November 10.\n\nTo purchase tickets, view the art, and learn about live online bidding via LiveAuctioneers, visit noblemaritime.org/auction.\n\nThe auction art is currently being exhibited in two of the museum’s first floor galleries and features 44 lots, including antique and contemporary paintings, prints, photographs, jewelry, and unique objects.\n\nThere are three lithographs by Noble, including Topsail Sheet Hook from 1970, which has never before been offered in the museum’s auction. The others are Watchman of the Dead from 1959 and Wood, Mud and Water from 1982.\n\nThere are also rare prints by celebrated historic artists. Included are Snowy Owls by John James Audubon (1785-1851), published as a deeptone offset print in 1948; À l'Ombre des Revês from Chagall Peintures 1942-1945 by Marc Chagall (1887-1985); and The Marilyn Monroe Trip, VIII a serigraph in Day-Glo ink from 1968 by Bert Stern (1929-2013).\n\n“Alice Austen and John A. Noble share a birthday—March 17—albeit 47 years apart,” noted Ciro Galeno, Jr., Executive Director of the Noble Maritime Collection. “They are Staten Island’s most preeminent historic artists, with a pair of ferries named for them. New York’s working waterfront figured largely in their art and lives, and we are honored to host this exhibition of the subject through Austen’s unique lens, which I am sure Noble would have appreciated.”\n\n“When the Noble museum asked me to curate an exhibition of Austen’s photographs for their galleries, I was thrilled to make connections between Austen’s and Noble’s legacies.” Victoria Munro, Executive Director Alice Austen House said. “This project gave me and the Alice Austen Collections Director Kristine Allegretti the opportunity to research the vast archive of maritime images that Austen captured. This revealed a collection of over 1,000 images that have rarely been viewed and opened a doorway to explore Austen’s intrinsic connection to the waterways of her front door and her travels. I hope viewers will take away an understanding of Austen’s professional dedication to her medium and her bold unconventional determination to capture the magnificent beauty of the open water and vessels that inhabit it.”\n\nThis exhibition was made possible, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council; the New York State Council on the Arts, with the support of Governor Kathy Hochul and the New York State Legislature; and by a grant from the Lily Auchincloss Foundation.\n\nThe Noble Maritime Collection, located in Building D, a former mariners’ dormitory at Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, New York, is open from 12 until 5 PM, Thursdays through Sundays. Admission is by donation.\n\nAlice Austen House Museum members will be offered free admission to the Noble Maritime Collection during regular gallery hours throughout the run of the Picturing the Water exhibition.\n\nFor more information, call (718) 447-6490 or visit noblemaritime.org.\n\nThe Alice Austen House Museum is located at 2 Hylan Boulevard, Staten Island, NY and is open Tuesday through Friday, 12 PM until 5 PM, and Saturday and Sunday, 11 AM until 5 PM. Admission is $6 per person.\n\nFor more information, call (718) 816-4506 or visit aliceausten.org.\n\nThe Noble Maritime Collection has been approved by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to receive a Challenge America award of $10,000. This grant will support the museum’s new education program Musical Voyage Around the World.\n\nThe museum is the recipient of one of 262 Challenge America awards totaling $2.62 million that were announced by the NEA as part of its first round of fiscal year 2023 grants.\n\n“The National Endowment for the Arts is proud to support arts projects in communities nationwide,” said NEA Chair Maria Rosario Jackson, PhD. “Projects such as this one with The Noble Maritime Collection strengthen arts and cultural ecosystems, provide equitable opportunities for arts participation and practice, and contribute to the health of our communities and our economy.”\n\n“Music education sparks creativity in our young children and plays a significant role in helping them enhance their listening, motor, and social skills,” Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis said. “I’m pleased to see NEA support the Noble Maritime Collection with this award so our students can have more access to music education and deepen their understanding of diverse music from around the globe.”\n\nMusical Voyage Around the World is a program to introduce general and special education students in the third through eighth grade to maritime history, water transport, and ethnomusicology.\n\n“The staff and board of the Noble Maritime Collection are grateful to the NEA for the opportunity to bring live, traditional music into the schools in our community with this innovative program that also celebrates Staten Island’s maritime heritage,” said Executive Director Ciro Galeno, Jr.\n\nThe Noble Maritime Collection’s Director of Programs Dawn Daniels is developing the program and will implement it during its pilot year with the assistance of diverse, professional musicians. They will lead students at PS 59: The Harbor View School in St. George and PS 373, District 75’s main location in Randall Manor, on an imaginary voyage around the world through interactive lessons, musical instrument exploration, and performance participation.\n\n“When I was little I had a book about children from all parts of the world. I never forgot it, and it inspired me to write an education program that celebrates the music of diverse cultures,” said Mrs. Daniels. “Musical Voyage Around the World explores performing arts traditions by bringing children on a pretend journey to all the continents. The program connects music with the museum's vision of using the arts to make maritime culture accessible to all people.”\n\nFreelance Grantwriting Consultant\n\nLocation: Hybrid combination of remote work and in-person office hours\n\nPosition Level: Freelance consultant\n\nOrganizational Profile: The mission of the Noble Maritime Collection, an art and history museum on Staten Island, is to present exhibitions and programs that celebrate the working waterfront of New York Harbor in the tradition of distinguished artist John A. Noble (1913-83), and to preserve Robbins Reef Lighthouse and the history of Sailors’ Snug Harbor. The museum is located at Snug Harbor Cultural Center, formerly the retirement home Sailors' Snug Harbor from 1833 to 1976. Noble was an artist and sailor who worked on schooners based out of New York in the 1920s. He lived on Staten Island and is known for his unique houseboat studio, fashioned out of parts of 19th-century wooden vessels.\n\nThe museum’s vision, inspired by its namesake, is to use art to make the working waterfront accessible to all people, and in doing so, foster an understanding of its history and relevance to the culture and economy of the local community. Its primary program areas are preservation and display of the permanent collection, new exhibits, arts education, and public programs.\n\nThe museum was founded as a nonprofit in 1986. Since that time its dedicated volunteer crew worked to recover, repair and preserve an historic building that previously housed retired sailors as part of Sailors’ Snug Harbor. The building itself is part of the unique experience of visiting the Noble Maritime Collection. The centerpiece of its exhibitions is John A. Noble’s unique houseboat art studio, restored and installed inside the museum.\n\nJob Description: Following the recent successful development of an organizational Development Plan that grew out of its strategic plan, the Noble Maritime Collection seeks to hire a part-time Grant Writing Consultant. The Noble’s leadership is particularly focused on identifying and pursuing opportunities that provide operational and capacity building support. The addition of a Grant Writing Consultant is a new endeavor for the museum and is an action being taken as part of the Strategic Plan goals to expand audiences for the museum’s work and build internal capacity.\n\nThe Consultant will utilize the existing Fundraising Plan to develop institutional grant proposals to new foundation and corporate sources as well as draft applications to existing and new government and foundation sources. Finalization of all application components will be completed in close coordination with the Executive Director. In addition, the Grant Writing Consultant will work with the Executive Director and program staff to draft and/or refine interim and final reports due to the Noble’s foundation and government funders.\n\nIt is expected that the incoming Consultant will hold existing relationships with foundation and corporate sources in order to introduce those sources to the work of the Noble Maritime Collection and lead to new funding opportunities.\n\nThe Consultant will work on a contract basis for 10 months. This position is offered in a hybrid work arrangement combining remote work and in-person office hours. The Consultant will have the ability to create a flexible schedule, but one that aligns with the needs of the grant schedule.\n\nResponsibilities: Reporting to Executive Director Ciro Galeno, Jr., the Grant Writing Consultant is responsible for the research, preparation, and tracking of grant proposals and reports to existing foundation and government funders. Final submission will be executed by Mr. Galeno.\n\nThe Consultant will also utilize the organization’s Fundraising Plan to determine the most likely sources of new income for the Noble Maritime Collection and, over the course of the contract, develop proposals to be submitted to new sources of foundation and corporate funding. The Consultant will expand the existing prospect list to add new foundation and corporate sources.\n\nThe Consultant will work with program staff to develop compelling narratives about the unique position that the Noble Maritime Collection holds in relationship to the history of Staten Island, local maritime history and culture, 19th through 21st century art, the history of immigration, and art forms including painting, drawing, sculpture, architecture, music, dance, and storytelling.\n\nThe Consultant may be asked to meet with the museum’s Fundraising Committee on a quarterly basis, and/or report at meetings of the Board of Trustees.\n\nQualifications: This position requires exceptional attention to detail, the ability to multitask, a high level of organization and excellent communication skills, both written and verbal. Extensive experience with grant writing is required; this is not a position for early career fundraisers. Familiarity with local and regional foundations, corporate and government funders for museums is required. It is expected that the Consultant will be willing to share their existing relationships with funders in order to make introductions on behalf of the Noble Maritime Collection. Knowledge of and ease with various application platforms (Fluxx, etc.) helpful. Superior proof-reading, information gathering, and listening skills are required. Knowledge of the grant research process, particularly access to and ease with Foundation Center Online, are required. The ability and desire to collaborate as part of a long-standing team are required, but the Consultant should be able to work independently and autonomously. Sound knowledge of Microsoft Office and Excel are required; previous database experience a plus.\n\nFamiliarity with museum operations, collections management, and visual arts is a plus.\n\nFamiliarity with Staten Island is a plus; willingness to visit the borough and learn its unique history and culture are a must.\n\nPay Rate: The Consultant will be paid an hourly rate of $65, for a maximum of 300 hours. Payment will be made monthly and based on the number of hours worked. The Consultant will be responsible for submitting monthly invoices to the Executive Director.\n\nThe consulting position does not offer benefits such as health insurance or transportation reimbursement.\n\nApplication Deadline: December 31, 2022\n\nHow to Apply: Please email a written cover letter and resume to Executive Director Ciro Galeno Jr. at jobs@noblemaritime.org. Finalists will be expected to provide two writing and budget samples plus three references at an appropriate point in the process. No phone calls, please.\n\nThe Noble Maritime Collection is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.

We will get the rest when we return next week. Thanks to Armorica, once again—we will keep it warm and safe. They also brought back the generator and the heavy grinder. Erin Urban will stow everything and return the tools.\n\nThe stairwell walls and staircase were wet because the circuit breaker on the ground fault interrupter had tripped. The pins on the timer had loosened and fallen out for unknown reasons, perhaps because of heavy moisture. The fourth floor porthole was not secure, and also could have loosened in the heavy wind and rain last week. When we left on October, it was tight. Gus and Carmen corrected the problems.\n\nNext steps: We will replace the timer with one that addresses humidity as well as heat. There’s always lots of maintenance, and we will go out regularly to check on the lighthouse and work on interior jobs. Under Andrew Quisling’s supervision, we will finish the Watch Gallery door by painting the outside and varnishing the inside and adding a chain and hook so we can leave it open, and Andrew will replace the kitchen door threshold. We will work on the floors. On good days, when we can get a crew, we will work on the promenade and clean it up little by little.\n\nWe will bring back the paint! We need a 250-volt inverter to run equipment.\n\nThe Noble Maritime Collection will present the 34th Annual John A. Noble Art Auction as an in-person and virtual event on Saturday, November 12 at the museum and via LiveAuctioneers.\n\nEach year since 1988, local artists and collectors have donated fine art to be auctioned as a fundraiser for the Noble Maritime Collection. This year’s lots include rare lithographs by the museum’s namesake, John A. Noble (1913-1983), several paintings, work by noted local contemporary artists, and a print by Marc Chagall (1887-1985).\n\nAll of the proceeds benefit the museum and yield up to 20% of its annual budget, making possible exhibitions and free and low-cost public programs including arts education for children of all ages and abilities.\n\n“Many non-profit fundraisers include some type of auction, but with ours it’s the main event—and it’s a really fun experience, as evidenced by the event’s longevity,” said Ciro Galeno, Jr., the museum’s Executive Director since 2018. “The movement of fine art is fast paced and exhilarating, with competitive and entertaining bidding—and what’s best is that it’s all for charity.”\n\nMr. Galeno continued, “We are so grateful to our sponsors, donors, and artists for making this all possible for the past 34 years, and a lot of good has been done—and will continue to be done—for the community thanks to their tremendous generosity.”\n\nScott Van Campen, Executive Director of MakerSpace NYC, returns for his fourth year as auctioneer.\n\nThe in-person event begins at 6:30 PM with an open bar and a light supper. Catering by Framboise, led by Chef Frank Puleo, will once again cater the event with Northern Italian cuisine inspired by the museum’s new exhibition Andrea Doria: Rescue at Sea.\n\nThe auction begins at 8 PM and will be simultaneously streamed on LiveAuctioneers for virtual bidding.\n\nMajor underwriting for the event has been generously provided by Caddell Dry Dock and Repair Company and New York Community Bank, as well as other business and community support that can be viewed at noblemaritime.org/auction.\n\nTickets are $125 each, or $90 for museum members. Reservations are required by November 7. Those who wish to participate on LiveAuctioneers can make a free account to register for the Noble auction. LiveAuctioneers registrations will be accepted through the day of the event on November 12.\n\nTo purchase tickets, view the art, and learn about live online bidding via LiveAuctioneers visit noblemaritime.org/auction.\n\nThe auction art, currently on view in the museum’s library, features 45 lots, including antique and contemporary paintings, prints, photographs, jewelry, and unique objects.\n\nPied et Paquebot, Noble’s iconic and sought-after lithograph of the Statue of Liberty from 1974 is the title piece. There are also two other lithographs by Noble—Shifting Topsails, created in 1950, which has never before been offered in the museum’s auction and Topsail Sheet Hook, Number 2 from 1981.\n\nThere are also rare prints by Chagall, Harry Fenn (1837-1911), Richard Aberle Florsheim (1916-1979), Jay Moon (active 1970s), Noble’s father John “Wichita Bill” Noble (1874-1934), Anton Seder (1850-1916), Joop Vegter (1931-2017), and Herman Zaage (1927-2008).\n\nContemporary printmakers represented in the auction include Staten Islanders Diane Matyas, Bill Murphy, and Francesca D’Atria Romano, as well as William Behnken, Colleen Pike Blair, Diego Briceno, Miriam Quen Cheikin, Patricia Langer, DeAnn L. Prosia, and Ellen Nathan Singer. The selection includes lithographs, engravings, etchings, mezzotints, monoprints, and woodcuts.\n\nThere are seven paintings offered in various mediums by artists Eric Kahn, Duncan Fraser McLea (1841-1916), Steve Negrón, Dennis Joseph Yanoski, and Staten Islanders Kathy Krantz Fieramosca, Paul Landgraf, and Halina McCormack.\n\nA painting of cherry blossoms by Noble’s friend and famed restaurateur Jack Demyan (1923-1999), as well as a giclée of a painting donated by local artist Sarah Yuster and two 19th-century European seascape paintings by unknown fine artists are additionally available.\n\nThe auction includes photographs by local artists Bill Higgins, Eric Holmes (1960-2014), Bo Kass (1938-2020), and Michael McWeeney.\n\nA unique, hand-carved piece of folk art by noted whittler Jehu Camper (1897-1989) is on offer, along with the book Americana Crafted: Jehu Camper, Delaware Whittler by Robert D. Bethke.\n\nMixed media pieces by Denise Mumm and prolific Staten Island artist Norman Pate (1923-2004) will also be auctioned, as well as a sterling silver necklace with turquoise beads by Valerie Quinlan (1937-2021).\n\nLocal artist and auction committee member Elle Finn donated a pen and ink drawing of lily pads as well as a hand-embellished print of an original painting of a Snug Harbor cottage by her husband Sal Rinaudo. Two limited edition prints, one of a painting and the other of a drawing, by museum trustee John Stobart round out this year’s selection.\n\nWinning bidders through LiveAuctioneers can pick up their purchases at the museum beginning on Tuesday, November 15.\n\nShipping is available through the museum’s partner, Postal Connections. Interested bidders can get a quote before bidding and arrange for shipping by contacting them at (718) 980-2000 or postalconnections210@yahoo.com.\n\nThe Noble Maritime Collection, located in a former mariners’ dormitory at Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, New York, is open to the public from 12 until 5 PM, Thursdays through Sundays, during which time the auction preview exhibition can be viewed.\n\nTo learn more about this unique maritime museum, or for more information about the auction, call (718) 447-6490 or visit noblemaritime.org.\n\nRobbins Reef Trip Report\n\nThursday, October 27, 2022\n\nCrew: Andrew Quisling, Carmen Campo, Erin Urban\n\nWeather: Another windy day with plenty of sun and deep-blue rough waters, mid-50s\n\nAccess: Left Miller’s at 1:15 PM and returned at 3:30 PM on the Nicholas Miller captained by Abdel Rahmanelmasry.\n\nPurpose of the trip: The purpose of the trip was to install the new redwood Watch Gallery door and to check on the lighthouse.\n\nTasks accomplished: After taking down the old door, Carmen and Andrew removed the bolts and two iron hinges. The hinges are original and had to be straightened, and Andrew did so expertly. To straighten them out, he leveraged the hinge using a sturdy 2x4 from the basement stash and the bottom rung of the ladder to the Watch Gallery. He and Carmen then hung the new door in place leaving 1/8” gap between the door and jambs.\n\nWe will use the bolt lock from the old door. Bye-bye loyal little black rope! We will sell you for $400 bucks to a collector of lighthouse memorabilia…\n\nErin checked out the Light Gallery; there was water in one sill only; we will check the caulking on that window, as everything else is holding.\n\nShe swept the promenade and would like to fill the holes, especially the ones from the Coast Guard bathroom. One long old pipe trough was full of salty, smelly water. We need a jackhammer and cement. We promenade weeders and sweepers would like to address the surface and remove the remnants of iron structures once built upon it. Again this is weather and crew-sensitive work.\n\nNext steps: Andrew will adjust the Watch Gallery and attach a hook for roping it open in the wind and paint the exterior white and probably varnish the inside because is so beautiful. He will adjust the kitchen door threshold, and the doors will be set.\n\nThe weather has been against us all season, and lately the humidly and rain have been unpredictable. We have decided to wrap up the exterior painting on the advice of Lou DeBlasi and Pete Battezzato from Armorica Sales, our paint donors; Carlo Giambanco from the Triboro Bridge and Tunnel Authority, and Tony Cucurullo and David Attwood, other engineer in the maritime field. Gus Scott concurs, if reluctantly. We all hoped to get more done this season.\n\nWe will bring back other equipment like the generator and grinding hammers, and continue to haul back paint for storage at Erin’s house; Pete said it will be fine there.\n\nNext steps: There’s always maintenance, and we will go out regularly to check on the lighthouse and work on interior jobs. We can now clean up the floors, as Lou gave us a 5-gallon pail of thinner, and we bought respirators and masks for anyone who wants to help. We need a circular floor fan to supplement the breezes in Kate’s house.\n\nOn good days, when we can get a crew, we will work on the promenade and clean it up little by little.\n\nWe need a 100-volt invertor so we don’t need a generator to run equipment.\n\nThe Noble Maritime Collection has announced the appointment of two community leaders to the museum’s Board of Trustees—Elizabeth Bennett and Christine Johnson.\n\nMs. Bennett has a wealth of non-profit management experience, including fundraising, audience building, equity, and programmatic collaboration. She previously worked as Director of Program Services at the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and as Executive Director of Staten Island Arts, and is currently a journalist with The Vineyard Gazette of Martha’s Vineyard and a grant writer.\n\nMs. Johnson has had an esteemed career in service to the public, including as a social worker and a victim assistance counselor, as well as a membership director at the YMCA. She is perhaps most widely known for her service as Chief-of-Staff to former New York City District 49 Council Member Debi Rose from 2010 to 2022.\n\nMs. Bennett and Ms. Johnson will bring new energy and ideas to the museum as its leadership continuously seeks to create enriching programming for the public in a welcoming and inclusive space.\n\nTheir addition to the museum’s leadership is part of an ongoing process that began with the creation of a Strategic Plan in 2021 with funding from the New York Community Trust and a Development Plan in 2022 with funding from the Staten Island Foundation.\n\n“We are grateful to Chris and Elizabeth for their willingness to continue to serve the public through the work we do at the Noble Maritime Collection. They will lead the board development committee and will focus on strengthening museum relationships with public and private funders,” said Board Chair Steve Kalil, President of Caddell Dry Dock and Repair Company.\n\nCiro Galeno, Jr., the museum’s executive director added, “Chris and Elizabeth have been champions of the Noble Maritime Collection for many years in their previous roles, and their passion, enthusiasm, and work ethic made them the ideal candidates to join the Board of Trustees.”\n\nThe Noble Maritime Collection, located in a former sailors’ dormitory at Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Building D, Staten Island, is open year round, Thursday through Sunday from 12 until 5 PM.\n\nThe new exhibition Andrea Doria: Rescue at Sea, featuring objects recovered from the wreck of the famous Italian ocean liner, is on view through June 2023.\n\nAdmission is by donation."
