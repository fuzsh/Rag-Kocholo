        "text": "By\n\nThe creator of the video that has figured so prominently in Soccermomgate — the Ken Johnson review in The New York Times of Michelle Grabner's exhibition at James Cohan — might have been expected to weigh in while the accusations were flying fast and heated, but I was too entertained watching the art world tie itself in knots. But with the votes now mostly in....\n\nI made the video with a dual purpose. On the one hand, it is a sincere effort to support my friend Michelle, by supplying her first big New York exhibition with a slightly more engaging didactic than the fish-on-ice press release (usually unread) typically offered at a gallery's reception desk. But I also deployed that sincerity, positioned it knowingly and with Michelle's acquiescence, as a trap to snare New York art world chauvinisms — parochial, sexist, classist, take your pick. And boy, did it succeed there. The trap I set might have been identified for what it was had any of the bloggers or critics taken the trouble to consider the background of the video's creator (First rule of journalism: go to the source!). As the artist who made \"Talent\" and \"The Art Dealers' Optical Tests,\" among other satires, and as the author of \"Concrete Comedy,\" the alternative history of twentieth-century comedy, I have more wit than to make a bomb also look like a bomb. Can't the New York art world discern camouflage? Aren't you guys supposed to be paragons of sophistication? I used to work for Warhol, people. I understand how to make a comedy that doesn't simultaneously announce itself as comedy.\n\nI shot \"A Few Minutes with...\" while visiting Michelle and her husband Brad Killam at their cottage in rural Wisconsin — mostly in order to have something to do there; as I have no country skills, rural settings tend to bore me. At my direction we improvised the shoot over less than an hour. It then took me a few days to work out the edit. All told, not a lot of heavy lifting.\n\nMichelle and I were casually aware that including depictions of her rural sympathies and domestic skills would frame a set of values different from, and at odds with, the hyper-professional commercial context in which the video was to be seen. But that contrast interests us; each of us, for our own reasons, has sought another set of values than that promoted by the New York art world, and we're happy to stand by — and for — that pursuit. And while our professional narratives may diverge — on top of her other achievements Michelle does want to succeed in New York, whereas I already did that scene more than thoroughly, decades ago, and don't defer to it in any aspect of my work today — the two of us are in accord when it comes to recognizing that in this de-centered era it has become viable to work from places like, say, Milwaukee (even from the suburbs of places like Milwaukee) and remain effective contemporary artists who have something to say. The American art world is changing, regardless of whether the New York art world approves of the change. The idea that contemporary artists must live in the \"right\" places or have the right artistic lifestyle/attitude in order to have something to say as artists is a corny, parochial idea left over from another time. It is New York at its corniest, frankly. Michelle isn't a soccer mom, but the idea that one can't be a soccer mom and also have something to say as an artist just doesn't wash. A review such as Mr. Johnson's only points up how outmoded the notion is. Because, let's face it, two artists who operate out of the suburbs in flyover country clearly outsmarted the New York press (New York audiences too?), and easily too, by doing very little more than lifting a pinky at the right angle.\n\nIf you don't think so, ask yourself who in this scenario got played. Whose hand was shown? When Mr. Johnson writes\n\n\"Nothing in all this is more interesting than the unexamined sociological background of the whole.\"\n\nhe is in a way correct, except he has misidentified the subject of study. The New York art world also constitutes \"a sociological background,\" after all, and it, by sly or other means, may itself be laid out on the slab. Narcissism — not the personal sort but rather that of the New York art system (all systems are narcissistic) — underwrites Mr. Johnson's attitude, in other words, and while that narcissism may have sprung the trap it wasn't the only critter that got caught. All the distorting prisms of \"isms\" and insular MFA-speak put into play subsequent to his review, occupy their own wing in the self-regarding hive mind of the contemporary art system, and (as evidenced by the response to his piece) actively do their part to prevent us thinking for ourselves about what we're seeing. A comedy reveals a world to itself, so as to liberate anyone who wants to be liberated. I'm a fan of independent thought. Sue me.\n\nThis dust-up has distracted from the qualities and merits of my friend's art, and I regret contributing to that. (My apologies, pal.) But I only set out a trap, I didn't make anyone put a foot in it; Mr. Johnson might have reviewed Michelle's show any number of ways. Anyway, art exhibitions are about something bigger than selling art, or can be. Michelle well knows that a value system attaches to and informs her art and, yes, her lifestyle. You'd have to ask her, but I suspect she hasn't minded throwing down with the dominant value system, and tasting a little blood. I know I haven't."
