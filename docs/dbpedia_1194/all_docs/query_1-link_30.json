As an artist he is best known for his work entitled Talent, eighteen \"entertainer's headshots\" of contemporary artists including Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons, Jenny Holzer, and others, as well as The Ice Cream Social, a project comprising installations, performances, a novella, and a Sundance Channel TV pilot. His books include High Entertainment, The Velvet Grind: Essays, Interviews, Satires, 1983–2005, The Dr. Frankenstein Option, The Camera Believes Everything, and a new book, Concrete Comedy: An Alternative History of 20th-Century Comedy.\n\nPublic programs are made possible, in part, by a major gift from Ann and Jerry Moss. Additional support is provided by Bronya and Andrew Galef, Good Works Foundation and Laura Donnelley, an anonymous donor, and the Hammer Programs Committee."
