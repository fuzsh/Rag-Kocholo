        "text": "Association of Art Editors Style Guide\n\nCopyright ©2017, Association of Art Editors, All Rights Reserved\n\nFirst edition (2006) compiled by Lory Frankel and Virginia Wageman. Edited by Lory Frankel with the assistance of Phil Freshman, Chris Keledjian, and Fronia W. Simpson\n\nRevised edition (2013) edited by Maureen Butler with the assistance of Phil Freshman\n\nContents\n\nTo the Reader\n\nThe first edition of the Association of Art Editors Style Guide was produced in 2006. The present revised edition was created in 2013 with a dual aim: to bring the Style Guide into alignment with The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition; and to make it reflect changes that occurred in manuscript preparation, editing, and publishing after 2006—largely due to evolving technologies.\n\nThe Style Guide is intended for authors of texts on art—any kind of text—and for editors of these texts and their publishers. Its purpose is to provide guidelines for authors and editors in the writing and redaction of manuscripts. Uniformity of usage is not the purpose of this guide. Rather, it aims to ensure uniformity of comprehension about the issues that authors and editors deal with.\n\nAlthough it would have its practical purposes, a definitive, this-way-only manual would be inadequate to the profession, since art history is an aggregate of many different methodologies and fields of specialization. Nor is it likely, or expected, that all publishers (or editors) will abandon long-cherished systems, especially when those systems adequately serve their purposes. Rather, we offer a guide to several generally accepted styles. Authors should consult with their publisher/editor before making final stylistic decisions; if the publisher is unknown at the time of writing, the author very often will be responsible for revising the manuscript later to accord with house style.\n\nNote: “See Chicago” (appearing throughout) refers to The Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition.\n\nThe style manuals and publications of various institutions were also among the sources consulted for substance and examples. We gratefully acknowledge: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., New York; the College Art Association, New York; The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.\n\nThis revised edition of the Style Guide, like the original, is dedicated to Virginia Wageman (1941–2003). A co-founder and early president of the AAE, she was an untiring campaigner for high editorial standards. Virginia’s loving devotion to her craft, fund of common sense, and sunny disposition made working with her deeply rewarding.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nIn general, abbreviations are appropriate in notes and parenthetical or display material but should be avoided in straight (narrative) text. Some publishers prefer to keep abbreviations to a minimum in text, spelling out reigned, circa, born, and so on, even in parenthetical references. Consistency is of primary importance. If you use b. for born, for example, you must use d. for died. A list of common abbreviations appears below.\n\nIn running text, cite books of the Bible by short title, usually one word. See Chicago 10.46–50.\n\nDo not abbreviate journal titles in running text. (Example: Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, not JWCI.) If such titles are to be abbreviated in notes, provide a key to their abbreviations.\n\nAvoid the abbreviations etc., e.g., and i.e. in running text.\n\nState names are spelled out in running text or when they stand alone. In references, captions, or checklists, standard state abbreviations—Mass. or Calif., for example—can be used. Avoid the two-letter postal-code form (see Chicago 10.28–30). Note, however, that some publishers prefer to spell out state names in all cases, an approach that makes the work more accessible to a global audience.\n\nIn running text, spell out: figure(s), note(s), number(s), page(s), plate(s), and catalogue number(s). These may be abbreviated in parenthetical references in text. See below for recommended abbreviations.\n\nIn running text, spell out: “about” (do not use “around,” “circa,” “c./ca.”), days of the week, months of the year, and dimensions such as “inches” and “feet.”\n\nCenturies are usually spelled out (eighteenth century, twenty-first century), but it is also acceptable to use numerals (18th century, 21st century). Whichever approach is chosen should be used consistently.\n\nSpell out the word Saint in names of saints, but abbreviate it in personal names where the abbreviation is preferred. (Example: Ruth St. Denis.) See below under Saint for rules on church names and other related details.\n\nIn place names, spell out: Fort, Mount, Mountain.\n\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS\n\nSee also Chicago 10.43 for a list of scholarly abbreviations.\n\nAccents\n\nUnusual diacritical marks should be marked on the manuscript by hand for the designer/typesetter/printer, either called out in the margin or marked with yellow or other highlighter.\n\nThe most common accents (acute é, grave è, umlaut ü, circumflex î, and cedilla ç) are supported by most fonts and need not be marked.\n\nIn a program or font that does not have the macron (long mark), the circumflex or tilde may be employed to indicate it if there are no words using the circumflex or tilde in the manuscript. If macrons are thus indicated by a different accent, a note to that effect should be given at the beginning of the manuscript so that the designer/typesetter and printer will know to change these to macrons.\n\nInsert all accents given in the foreign language, including accents on capital letters. (Note that diacritical marks are not always used on the first letter of capitalized words in French: Etude, instead of Étude, or Edouard instead of Édouard.)\n\nIn general, do not use vowel ligatures (œ or œ).\n\nThe five most commonly occurring accents can be created on Macintosh computers by pressing the Option key along with the following keys (after pressing these two keys together, press the letter that takes the accent):\n\n+ e = ´ (acute) é\n\n+ ` = ` (grave) è\n\n+ i = ˆ (circumflex) î\n\n+ u = ¨ (umlaut) ü\n\n+ n = ~ (tilde) ñ\n\n+ c = ç (cedilla)\n\nArticle (the)\n\nIn running text, lowercase the preceding a museum name. This is to be done even for museums that have the article as part of the official name and capitalize The in their own documents and publications. Example:\n\nA similar print is in the Museum of Modern Art, New York.\n\nIn running text, also lowercase the preceding the name of a building, residence, business, and the like. Examples:\n\nthe Breakers\n\nthe Red Rooster restaurant\n\nthe Empire State Building\n\nthe University of Chicago\n\nthe College Art Association Conference\n\nIn illustration captions and exhibition checklists, initial articles that are part of the museum’s official name are often capitalized. (See The Official Museum Directory, or locate the given museum’s Website on the Internet.)\n\nIn titles of books, an initial The is always italic. Example:\n\nThe Chicago Manual of Style.\n\nIn titles of journals, newspapers, or magazines, the preceding the name is lowercase and roman, even if it appears in the masthead for the publication. Examples:\n\nThe article is in the Village Voice.\n\nHe reads the New York Times every day.\n\nThe Art Bulletin is published by the College Art Association.\n\nHowever, the article is retained in foreign-language titles. Example:\n\nShe reads Le Monde every day.\n\nIn footnote and bibliographical references, an initial article The is omitted in titles of journals, newspapers, and magazines. Examples:\n\nArt Bulletin 52, no. 3\n\nNew Yorker, Feb. 14, 1998.\n\nArt movements, periods, and styles\n\nThe question of whether to capitalize or lowercase is one of the most common in the field of art history and one of the most difficult in which to attain any agreement. Chicago would lowercase all art movements, periods, and styles except those derived from proper nouns. However, many art historians and art institutions traditionally capitalize them. For this reason, we offer an alternative to the Chicago method.\n\nThe names of art movements or periods of art can be capitalized to distinguish them as references to a particular body of work whose visual and/or chronological definitions are generally accepted. The art so designated may be of relatively short duration (Post-Impressionism), or extend over a longer period characterized by a broader range of styles (Renaissance, Baroque), or stem from self-styled movements (Cubism, Futurism).\n\nFor names of art movements that have entered the English language as an autonomous word (for example, baroque, meaning “stylistically overwrought”), capitalization of the movement helps to keep the distinction between word and movement clear.\n\nSome exceptions are made in the general system of capitalization. The word medieval is never capitalized in designating medieval art (though the period known as the Middle Ages is always capitalized).\n\nWords such as modernism or postmodernism are often left uncapitalized by those who hold that the cap should be used only when the works designated fall into a coherent visual and/or chronological category. Since the question, “What does a modernist work look like?” cannot be answered clearly, modernism remains in lowercase.\n\nFor those who prefer to capitalize art movements, remember that it takes time for a body of works to achieve capital-letter status—to undergo the kind of critical ordering and analysis that ultimately yield a definition. What we now call Conceptual art, for example, generally remained lowercase until the concepts and the works that exemplified it had been articulated over time.\n\nAdjectival forms: Impressionism/Impressionistic or impressionistic; Cubism/Cubist or cubist? Some prefer to lowercase adjectival forms since adjectival forms of proper nouns generally take the lowercase (Pope John Paul’s visit to New York; the papal visit). Others prefer to retain the initial cap to refer unambiguously to the movement, avoiding confusion with another meaning or referent of the word. We lean toward capitalizing any adjectival form that would be capitalized as a noun as the simpler method (thus avoiding such ambiguities as “German expressionist painter”: expressionist of German nationality or of the German Expressionist movement?).\n\nEqually legitimate is the lowercasing of art movements. For some, it merely reflects a tendency to avoid capitalization whenever possible. For others, however, a lowercase baroque or cubism represents an ideological stance, in which the history of art is not a history of great “movements” progressing in linear fashion. But those who use a lowercase style should avoid ambiguities such as “German expressionist painter” (alternative: a painter of the German expressionist movement).\n\nNames of artistic styles are capitalized unless they are used in a context that does not refer to their specific art-historical meaning (example: His dream was surreal). Some common names:\n\nAbstract Expressionism\n\nConceptualism, Conceptual Art, Conceptual art\n\nCubism\n\nDada\n\nMinimalism, Minimalist, Minimal Art, Minimal art\n\nPop Art, Pop art\n\nSurrealism\n\nIn general, sharply delimited period titles are capitalized, whereas broad periods and terms applicable to several periods are not:\n\nArchaic period\n\nBaroque\n\nEarly Renaissance\n\nHigh Renaissance\n\nEarly Christian\n\nGothic\n\nGreek Classicism of the fifth century (otherwise, classicism)\n\nImperial\n\nImpressionism\n\nIslamic\n\nMannerist\n\nMiddle Ages\n\nNeoclassicism (for the late-18th-century movement; otherwise, neoclassicism)\n\nPost-Impressionism\n\nPre-Columbian, Precolumbian\n\nRococo\n\nRoman\n\nRomanesque\n\nRomantic period\n\nantique, antiquity\n\nclassicism (see above)\n\nmedieval\n\nmodern, modernism\n\nneoclassicism (see above)\n\npostmodern\n\nprehistoric\n\nquattrocento\n\nSee also Words and terms.\n\nBias-free language\n\nBias-free language does not discriminate on the basis of age, physical condition, economic status, ethnicity, gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation.\n\nWhere possible without sacrificing meaning or euphony, use language that is not gender specific.\n\nAvoid words and turns of phrase that exclude or are insensitive to readers of a certain gender, race, or religion. Equally, avoid any extremes of political correctness, unless required by the text; for example, the neologism “s/he” is to be avoided.\n\nWhen appropriate, gender-neutral language can be achieved by making the subject plural. Example: Students may register in advance if they . . .\n\nWhen necessary, he or she may be used.\n\nCommonly used words and phrases:\n\nhandmade (for man-made)\n\nassistive-listening headset\n\nbraille\n\npeople with disabilities\n\nhearing impaired\n\nhumankind, humanity (for mankind)\n\nindividual (for man)\n\nmotor-impaired visitors\n\nsolo exhibition (for one-person show)\n\nvisually impaired\n\nwheelchair accessible\n\nwheelchair user\n\nBiblical references\n\nReferences to biblical passages (for example, Matt. 4:14) should be made in either the text or notes rather than in the bibliography. The first citation, however, should have an endnote or footnote that provides a full reference and the version of the Bible used (for example, 1 Kings 2:10–12 [New International Version]).\n\nBooks and sections of the Bible are usually capitalized (for example, Acts of the Apostles). For abbreviations of books of the Bible, see Chicago 10.45–50.\n\nBibliography\n\nTwo common styles for bibliographies are the “notes and bibliography” system and the “author-date” system. Both are described here, accompanied by sample bibliographies of likely entries for both systems.\n\nIn this context, references to “author” mean the name under which the work is alphabetized in the bibliography or list of references; it may be an organization or, as in some exhibition catalogues, the venue (such as New York for the Museum of Modern Art) or venues (New York and Philadelphia).\n\nIf the work is accessed online, include its DOI (Digital Object Identifier) or a URL. The latter is less reliable, as a Website may move or disappear. Printed-book publishers may require an electronic-resource identifier in citations for which a source is hard to find.\n\nSee chapters 14 and 15 of Chicago for a detailed examination of bibliographic styles.\n\nNOTES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY SYSTEM\n\nThere are numerous ways to organize a bibliography under the notes and bibliography system. It may be presented as a single list in alphabetical order, or it may be divided into categories, separating sources of a general and a specific nature; books, exhibition catalogues, and articles; in a monograph, works by the artist, works about the artist, and exhibition history. If there is a suggested-reading list, sources for further reading—some of which may have been cited in the text—are given. A bibliography may include all the works cited in the text, or it may be a selected bibliography, which will not necessarily include all the works cited.\n\nUsing a selected bibliography has the advantage of retaining the bibliography’s traditional aspect as a list of sources on the subject; tangential or unrelated citations would not need to appear in it. Any references not given in the selected bibliography would be cited in full (in the first instance) as a footnote or endnote in the book. Subsequent references to the work may be shortened to the last name of the author, a short title, and page number(s). Example, 2. Smith, Bronzino, 23.\n\nWhen the source is given in full in the bibliography, shortened references in footnotes or endnotes may be used throughout the book; make sure they are given identically throughout. This system also requires the single alphabetical bibliographic list.\n\nEvery note needs to have a reference number linking it to the relevant text.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY (sample entries)\n\nArchives, Abstract Art Controversy Correspondence, box H4, file 82.

When authors have the same last name, initials are generally added to distinguish them. When there is more than one identical short form (for example, two for Smith, 1957) letters are added after the dates (for example, 1957a and 1957b.)\n\nThe author-date system requires a reference list of every work cited in single, alphabetical-list form, giving the author’s full name and publication date as the first items. Footnotes or endnotes can be used to supplement the author-date system.\n\nREFERENCE LIST (sample entries)\n\nAlberti, Leon Battista. 2011. On Painting. Edited and translated by Rocco Sinisgalli.

Example:\n\nHoly Roman Empire, the empire\n\nNAMES OF ORGANIZATIONS\n\nCapitalize the full or shortened version of a proper name but not generic categories. Example:\n\nAcadémie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, Académie Royale, but not the Academy.\n\nNAMES OF PEOPLE\n\nWhen particles are used with the full name, they are often left lowercased when only the last name is given. Example:\n\nThe late works of Vincent van Gogh\n\nThe late works of van Gogh\n\nHowever, it is also accepted practice to capitalize the particle when the first name is dropped—Van Gogh—so long as this is done consistently. When particles are capitalized with the full name, they should always be capitalized when the first name is dropped. Example:\n\nAnthony Van Dyck\n\nVan Dyck\n\nFor capitalization of particles, follow the usage of the named individual or tradition. (In general, lowercase the particle in European names.) Examples:\n\nde La Tour\n\nd’ Hulst\n\nde Staël\n\nvon Blanckenhagen\n\nDer Nersessian\n\nVan Buren\n\nvan Gogh\n\nvan der Weyden\n\nTitles, whether of nobility, offices, or religious, are capitalized only when they directly precede the name: King Edward II, President Clinton, Pope John Paul II. Otherwise, lowercase them: the duchess of Kent, the senator from Ohio, the pope’s entourage.\n\nIdentify people mentioned with a brief phrase (the noted collector, the critic, etc.), using full name at first mention. Example:\n\nThe nineteenth-century writer and art critic Octave Mirbeau\n\nAsian names: The traditional format for Chinese and Japanese names places the family name first, followed by the given name. Unless the name is Westernized, as it often is by authors writing in English, it should be kept in the traditional order.\n\nTraditional order: Tsou Tang; Tajima Yumiko\n\nWesternized: Tang Tsou; Yumiko Tajima\n\nPLACE NAMES\n\nCapitalize place names with distinct and titled identities—the Middle East, the West (referring to the cultural-geopolitical entity), the Continent, the East Coast—otherwise, lowercase: northern Italy, southern France.\n\nIn general, capitalize a political entity when it follows the name and lowercase it when it precedes—New York State, the state of New York—unless the official name happens to take that form: the District of Columbia, the Dominion of Canada.\n\nFor place-name spellings, use the first choice given in Merriam-Webster’s Geographical Dictionary.\n\nCaptions\n\nCaption style varies according to field, period, institution, and so on, and caption forms will of necessity vary from publication to publication, subject to subject. What follows is a sampling of formats; for specific instructions on individual elements of captions, see Collections and collectors/Credit lines, Dates, Dimensions, Inscriptions, Media of artworks, Titles of artworks.\n\nThe caption normally begins with information identifying and describing the work of art. It usually ends with collections data, often including fund or donor credit and, sometimes, accession number.\n\nLine-for-line style places elements of the caption on separate lines with no punctuation at the end of each line; run-in style gives all the information sentence-style, separated by punctuation. Checklists and catalogue entries often employ the line-for-line style. This style is seldom used in most books that are not also exhibition catalogues and periodicals, where the elements are placed in sequential order separated by punctuation. (This style is often used in exhibition catalogues for captions to figure references.) The particular style that the publisher requires should be ascertained ahead of time by the author or editor if possible.\n\nAll or some of the following information may be included in an illustration caption, in the order given or in a slightly different order. (For more information about each of these categories, see under each item.)\n\nFor a work by a known artist:\n\nfigure or plate number\n\nname of artist, artist’s nationality or country of origin (Germany, active United States), artist’s dates\n\ntitle of work, subtitle(s) or alternative title(s), translation of title\n\ndate of execution\n\nmedium, including support\n\ndimensions, usually in inches (height precedes width precedes depth), dimensions in centimeters (usually in parentheses following inch measurement)\n\nsignature/inscription information (rarely given in figure captions)\n\ncredit line/collection, followed by city of collection (includes, as applicable, collection to which work belongs, donor of the work, and a museum accession number or the year in which the work was acquired)\n\nphotograph credit, if not given in a separate section (see Photograph and illustration credits).\n\nOther cases:\n\nfigure or plate number\n\ndescription of the work\n\ncountry and/or region, dates\n\nmedium\n\ndimensions\n\ncredit line/collection\n\nAn abbreviated caption may include:\n\nfigure or plate number\n\nname of artist (including first name)\n\ntitle of work\n\ndate of execution\n\ncredit line/collection\n\nIn general, the artist’s name should be given in full even in multiple captions for the same artist’s work, unless the article or book is about a single artist, in which case the artist’s last name is sometimes used after the first mention or the artist’s name is omitted altogether.\n\nFor anonymous works, if the category is not omitted altogether, “artist unknown” is generally used.\n\nBe sure that the titles of works as given in the text and captions match.\n\nIf the full image is not used, the caption must specify that it is a detail: Michelangelo, David, detail; Michelangelo, Sistine Chapel, Rome, Vatican, detail of ceiling: ignudo;Detail of Fig. 3: Left wing; Detail of Fig. 8 with the Flight into Egypt.\n\nInclude verified credit lines and, where appropriate, photograph credits (see Collections and collectors/Credit lines, Permissions, Photograph and illustration credits). If the location of the work is not known, use “location unknown” or “whereabouts unknown.” If the owner wishes to remain anonymous, use “private collection,” or “private collection, name of city.” If the artist owns the work, use “collection of the artist” or “collection the artist.”\n\nThe following examples, from a variety of sources (some noted), offer a range of punctuation and ordering of the elements:\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (Italian, 1452–1509).

In a book with hundreds of such entries, it is important to verify consistency among entries. To this end, it is helpful to check each of the elements noted above one at a time from beginning to end. For specific instructions on individual elements, see Collections and collectors/Credit lines, Dates, Dimensions, Exhibition history, Inscriptions, Media of artworks, Titles of artworks.\n\nChronology\n\nAlso called a biographical outline, a chronology is often included in artist monographs, solo exhibition catalogues, and catalogues raisonnés. Many formats are possible. In writing a chronology, it is important to decide on a particular approach and then use it consistently. It is also helpful to decide what kinds of information to include and exclude. If there is limited space, information readily at hand elsewhere in the volume (for example, in an exhibition history) as well as material of secondary importance may easily be omitted. The intention of a chronology is primarily to trace the artist’s development, not necessarily to list all of the artist’s accomplishments and activities.\n\nMost chronologies are written in either narrative style, with full sentences (usually using the artist’s last name), or in telegraphic style, omitting the subject, understood to be the artist. As in any text, where individuals are introduced, their full names should be given and a brief identification added.\n\nIt is important to verify that information in the chronology agrees with that given elsewhere in the publication.\n\nExample from Diane Upright, Morris Louis: The Complete Paintings (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1985):\n\n1952\n\nLouis and his wife moved into Washington, where they purchased a house at 3833 Legation Street, N.W. Louis converted the 12-by-14-foot dining room into the studio he was to use for the rest of his life.\n\nJacob Kainen, a Washington artist, helped Louis to obtain a teaching position at the Washington Workshop Center of the Arts, which was founded in 1945 by Leon and Ida Berkowitz. Louis taught two adult painting classes each week. He became friendly with Kenneth Noland, also an instructor at the workshop.\n\nExample from John Elderfield, Henri Matisse: A Retrospective (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1992):\n\n1912\n\nJANUARY 27: With Mme Matisse, departs for the first of two trips to Morocco. Mme Matisse will stay in Tangier until the end of March, Matisse until mid-April. Paints landscapes, including Periwinkles (pl. 147), having received a landscape commission from Ivan Morosov; still lifes, including Basket of Oranges (pl. 148); and figure paintings.\n\nMARCH 14–APRIL 6: First exhibition of his sculptures in America is held at the “291” gallery in New York, organized by Steichen and selected by the artist with Steichen. Includes six bronzes, five plasters (probably including those of the first four Jeannette sculptures; pls. 127, 128, 138, 139), one terra-cotta, and twelve drawings. The show is attacked by the critics; none of the works is sold.\n\nAPRIL 14: Leaves Tangier for Marseille, en route to Paris.\n\nClassical references\n\nReferences to classical works should be cited within parentheses in the text. Examples: (Odyssey 9.266), (Timaeus 484b). The use of Arabic rather than Roman numerals is preferred. But as with biblical references, a footnote or endnote should be given at the first reference, citing which translation or critical edition was used.\n\nFor classical works that exist in numerous editions, write out the names of the sections of the work in the note, as readers might use an edition different from yours. Example: (bk. 1, sec. 3). The elements in the text can subsequently be given in Arabic numerals separated by periods without writing out the names of the sections. Example: (1.5).\n\nSee also Chicago 14.256–65. Note, however, that the rules Chicago gives apply primarily to specialized writings; a nonspecialist audience would not know what to make of IG2.3274 or POxy. 1485, which are better written out: Inscriptiones Graecae, vol. 2, 2nd ed., inscription no. 3274, and Oxyrhynchus Papyri, document no. 1485.\n\nCollections and collectors/Credit lines\n\nFor museums, all information required by the institution should be cited. This may include accession number and date and such information as “the Jones fund,” “Gift of,” and “purchased with funds from.” Credit-line information, not to be confused with copyright information, identifies the donor or fund(s) through which the object was acquired. Some publishers change punctuation and capitalization for consistency in style, while others (especially museums) insist on using the form given by the museum, including punctuation and capitalization. Examples:\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art, New York; Lillie P. Bliss Bequest\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Gift of Mrs. J. H. Jones, 1929\n\nMusée du Louvre, Paris\n\nMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston\n\nThe Frick Collection, New York\n\nMusée des Beaux-Arts, Brussels\n\nAlthough it is important that the wording given by museums and institutions be carefully followed in the credit line, some standardization can be obtained by using the same order of elements and the same punctuation throughout. Examples:\n\nWhitney Museum of American Art, New York; Purchase 58.55\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Fletcher Fund, 1987 (1987.275)\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art, New York. Mrs. Simon Guggenheim Fund\n\nHirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., Gift of the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Foundation, 1966.\n\nVirginia Museum of Fine Arts, The Nasli and Alice Heeramaneck Collection, Gift of Paul Mellon, 68.8.3\n\nBritish Museum, London [E 289]\n\nTo help achieve consistency, it is permissible to omit the wording “courtesy” or “courtesy of” in the collection line. For example, if Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts specifies its credit line as “Courtesy, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,” it could be given as simply “Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.” The use of “courtesy” should be reserved for signaling the role of an intermediary in obtaining a photograph or permission, as in “Collection of the artist; courtesy Mary Boone Gallery, New York.”\n\nSome museums require a copyright credit for having given permission to reproduce a photograph. This should appear in the photograph credit, not the credit line. Example:\n\nOslo, Nasjonalgalleriet (photo: J. Lathion, ©Nasjonalgalleriet)\n\nGive the full name and location of museums, unless the location is part of the name. Example: National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (not National Gallery). If an institution’s title includes the name of the city, do not repeat the city, although the state or country may have to be included. Examples:\n\nThe Springfield Museum of Art, Illinois\n\nDallas Museum of Fine Art\n\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art\n\nArt Gallery of Ontario, Toronto\n\nKunsthalle Bremen\n\nVirginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond\n\nStates and countries should be given only for cities judged to be obscure or where there are two cities with the same name, for example, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Cambridge, England. By tradition, “Cambridge” is given for the city in England, whereas the state name is added for the city in Massachusetts. Names of states may be spelled out. If they are abbreviated, the standard Webster’s abbreviations should be used rather than postal abbreviations. Chicago 10.28 also lists the older abbreviations.\n\nFor private collections, only the information the collector provides should be given. Do not add a city to private collection unless the owner approves. Examples:\n\nPrivate collection\n\nPrivate collection, Boston\n\nCollection John Jones, New York\n\nCollection of Mary Black, Somerville, New Jersey\n\nCollection of Mary Black and John Jones, Ventura, California\n\nCollection of the artist\n\nCollection the author (or, perhaps better, private collection)\n\nSome collections are treated as entities. Examples:\n\nJoseph H. Hirshhorn Collection\n\nThe Abrams Family Collection\n\nLehman Collection\n\nNote that in the text, while formal collections should be capitalized (Lehman Collection), generic terms associated with collections should be lowercased (the collection of Robert Lehman).\n\nThe words and abbreviations “Inc.,” “Company,” “Co.,” “Ltd.,” and the like are usually omitted when giving names of commercial galleries. Such elements should be retained, however, when the collection refers to a business or corporation. Example:\n\nThe IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York\n\nIn general, names of foreign museums are given in the original language for scholarly publications. However, for books with a wide general audience, names of foreign museums may be anglicized. Examples:\n\nPalazzo Pitti, Florence = Pitti Palace\n\nGalleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna, Rome = National Gallery of Modern Art\n\nKokuritsu Kindai Bijutsukan, Tokyo = National Museum of Modern Art\n\nIn cases where the owner cannot be ascertained, use “Location unknown” or “Whereabouts unknown.” If it is known that a work has been destroyed or lost, that information should be provided. Examples:\n\nFormerly Berlin, Gemäldegalerie; destroyed in World War II\n\nDestroyed by the artist, 1954\n\nDestroyed in a fire, 1963\n\nIn most books, photographers’ and photo agencies’ credits are removed from captions and placed in a section, called “Photo credits” or “Photograph Credits,” at the back of the book. See Photograph and illustration credits.\n\nCredits (image and lender)\n\nCredits usually appear at the end of a book, after the index, if there is one, though if they are short they may be on the copyright page. Pictures, extensively quoted passages of text (short quoted passages—properly attributed in the text or endnotes—and extensive quotations in scholarly publications are still covered by fair use), photographers, and owners of rights (organizations such as SPADEM that own rights to an artist’s work but do not own the actual work of art) must all be credited scrupulously. Many owners of artworks now request that a credit line appear in the caption to an image. However, wherever permitted, information beyond the location and owner of an artwork should be removed from the caption and inserted into the credits page. Picture agencies and photographers often request that a credit line appear with a photograph. Many publishers do not generally consent to that style and instead place all such credits at the end of the book. Note that the credits typically are not listed in the table of contents. For specific instructions, see Photograph and illustration credits.\n\nDashes\n\nThere should be no extra space on either side of dashes. Em (long) dashes may be typed as two hyphens--or as an em dash—.\n\nEn dashes are used between inclusive numbers and between compound adjectives. These should be either marked by the editor or inserted by the editor. Examples:\n\n1970–72\n\npp. 38–45\n\nNew York–London flight\n\npost–Civil War period\n\nquasi-public–quasi-judicial bodies\n\nDates\n\nMonth-day-year or day-month-year: June 6, 1988, or 6 June 1988; either is acceptable so long as one style is consistently used in both text and notes, including in references to journals. Note that a comma follows the year in the month-day-year style.\n\nMonth-day: January 30 (not 30th)\n\nMonth-year: January 1992 (no comma)\n\nThe name of the month should be spelled out in text; it may be abbreviated in notes, especially for bibliographic uses.\n\nSeasons: The fall 1992 season (lowercase, no comma)\n\nDecades: 1950s; 1840s and 1850s (in full, no punctuation); or, when the century referred to is unambiguous, “the thirties.” Do not vary formats within one sentence or paragraph. Use “in the 1950s and 1960s” or “in the fifties and sixties,” not “in the 1950s and sixties,” “in the 1950s and 60s,” or “in the 1950s and ’60s.”\n\nMid: mid-1990; mid-nineteenth century; mid-nineteenth-century (adj. form)\n\nCenturies: Spell out and lowercase in text. Examples:\n\ntwentieth-century art\n\na phenomenon of the nineteenth century\n\nHe is a scholar of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century art.\n\nart of the late eighteenth century (noun form: no hyphen)\n\nlate-eighteenth-century art (adj. form: many style guides and institutions hyphenate early- and late- in the adjective form, but several do not)\n\nIn notes and captions, figures are often used. Example:\n\nlate 2nd–early 3rd century\n\nCentury or centuries? Some institutions offer the following guide:\n\nThe style was revived during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\nThe movement lasted from the fifth through the eleventh century.\n\nThe movement lasted from the fifth to the tenth century.\n\nEras or systems of chronology: These abbreviations are conventionally set in small capitals, separated by periods but no space. (Some publishers omit the periods.) The most commonly used system remains B.C./A.D. The latter always precedes the year. Examples: 55 B.C., A.D. 110.\n\nAlternative systems that use the same time frame:\n\nB.C.E./C.E. (before the common era and the common era)\n\nB.P. (before the present)\n\nOther systems:\n\nA.H. (in the year of the Hegira, beginning A.D. 622)\n\nA.M. (in the year of the world), precedes the year\n\nA.S. (in the year of salvation), precedes the year\n\nA.U.C. (from the founding of [Rome, 753 B.C.]), follows year\n\nUse of the solidus (slash /) in dates: In birth or death date, 1878/81 means born or died in either 1878 or 1881. In the date of a work of art or event, it also indicates either/or.\n\nLife dates: Give in full. Examples:\n\n1908–1972\n\nArminius (c. 17 B.C.–A.D. 21)\n\n385–331 B.C. (All digits are given for all B.C. dates.)\n\nAbbreviations may be used in text for life dates given in parentheses. Examples:\n\nborn = b. (b. 1930) Note: this is preferable to the form (1930–)\n\ndied = d. (d. 1538)\n\nabout = c. or ca. (ca. 1489–d. 1538)\n\nflourished = fl. (fl. 1503–30) (fl. 1530s) (fl. 16th century)\n\ndate known but unverified = ? (1489?–d. 1538)\n\nactive = act. (or spell out) (act. 16th century or active 1711–16)\n\nOther forms:\n\n(1683–before 1737)\n\n(after 1750–1799)\n\nOther dates: 385–331 B.C. (all digits are given for all-B.C. dates), 1864–1916, 1900–1902 (all digits are given with dates ending in 00), 1962–65.\n\nReign dates: 1902–39; the abbreviation r. may be used for dates given in parentheses (r. 1902–39).\n\nDates of artworks: Do not use circa, c., or ca. in text, except when the date is given in parentheses; “about” should be used instead. Dates separated by a solidus (1878/81) indicate either/or (either 1878 or 1881). An en dash, not a solidus, should be used to indicate a range of time: 1878–81 means the work was begun in 1878 and completed in 1881; ca. 1878–81 means the work was executed sometime between 1878 and 1881. An undated work may be designated n.d. (no date) if the intention is not to give an approximate date. A work in progress may be designated by the date begun followed by an en dash and a space (1994– ). These and other possibilities are offered here:\n\n1878/81 = work executed either in 1878 or in 1881\n\n1878–81 = work begun in 1878 and completed in 1881. If it is known that no work was done in 1879 and 1880, it could be given as “1878 and 1881” or as “begun 1878 and completed 1881”\n\nca. 1878–81 = work executed sometime between 1878 and 1881\n\nexh. or exhib. or exhibited 1881 = earliest record of the work is date of exhibition, 1881\n\nn.d. = undated\n\n1994– = work in progress, begun 1994\n\n1924, reconstructed 1989 = originally executed in 1924 and remade, refabricated, or reconstructed in 1989. Alternative: 1924 (1989 reconstruction)\n\n1932, exhibition print 1995 = photograph originally printed in 1932, exhibition print (or any later print) made in 1995. Alternative: 1932 (1995 exhibition print)\n\nFor a work in a series, the date of the series alone suffices if it includes the date of the print; if not, both dates must be given. Examples:\n\nManhattan View, from the portfolio New York Skyline, 1932\n\nManhattan View, 1931, from the portfolio New York Skyline, 1932\n\nSee also Chicago 9.30–37.\n\nDimensions\n\nFor two-dimensional works of art, height precedes width; depth follows for three-dimensional works. Always compare the measurements against the photograph of the artwork to make sure that dimensions are given in the correct order. For example, if a picture is of an obviously horizontal artwork and this does not correspond to the order of the dimensions, check with the owner of the artwork; the measurements may be transposed, or there may be a typo in the numbers.\n\nThe following abbreviations may be used where necessary in captions (not in running text):\n\nD/D./ d/d.: depth\n\nDiam/Diam., diam, diam.: diameter\n\nEst. diam.: estimated diameter\n\nMax. diam.: maximum diameter\n\nH/H./ h/h.: height\n\nL/L./ l/l.: length\n\nT/T./ t/t.: thickness\n\nW/W./ w/w.: width\n\nin./ft.: inches, feet\n\nmm/cm/m: millimeters, centimeters, meters\n\nsq. in./ft.: square inches, feet\n\nA lowercase x may be used for by, or a multiplication sign, but use only one or the other. Always use a word space on either side of the x. Editors should mark a lowercase x to be set as a multiplication sign (*).\n\nUse the inch as the basic unit of measurement in captions and catalogue entries. Inches may be signified with the abbreviation in., used just once per set of dimensions: 17 x 19 in.; 106 x 27 x 8 in. It may also be indicated by inch marks. When foot and inch marks are used, repeat the mark in a set of dimensions: 6’ 2” x 12’ 10”. Editors should indicate the use of foot and inch marks for the designer/typesetter/printer, especially if quotation marks were used in the manuscript.\n\nMost publishers and institutions use inches up to 99 and feet and inches thereafter.\n\nHowever, if there are only a few dimensions over 99”, it is best to use inches throughout.\n\nIf centimeters are given, that measurement should follow in parentheses: 96 x 96 x 24 in. (243.8 x 243.8 x 61 cm).\n\nIn most cases, convert millimeters to centimeters: 3.5 cm, not 35 mm. Use 5 cm, not 5.0 cm, and .5 cm, not 0.5 or 0.50 cm. (Works on paper, however, are often given in millimeters.)\n\n1 inch = 2.54 centimeters.\n\nTo convert inches to centimeters, multiply the inch figure by 2.54.\n\nTo convert centimeters to inches, divide the centimeter figure by 2.54. If you use a conversion table, check its accuracy by making a few conversions with a calculator.\n\nStandard decimal-to-fraction conversions:\n\n.125 = 1/8”\n\n.375 = 3/8”\n\n.625 = 5/8”\n\n.875 = 7/8”\n\nThe following range of figures may be used in converting decimals to fractions:\n\n.063 – .125 – .187 = 1/8”\n\n.188 – .250 – .312 = 1/4”\n\n.313 – .375 – .437 = 3/8”\n\n.438 – .500 – .562 = 1/2”\n\n.563 – .625 – .687 = 5/8”\n\n.688 – .750 – .812 = 3/4”\n\n.813 – .875 – .937 = 7/8”\n\n.938 – .999 = 1” (round off to the next highest whole number)\n\n2/5 rounds off to 3/8\n\n3/5 rounds off to 5/8\n\n1/3 rounds off to 3/8\n\n2/3 rounds off to 5/8\n\n4/5 rounds off to 7/8\n\n1/5 rounds off to 1/4\n\nAs a general rule, use only the half, quarter, and eighth fractions. Change all sixteenths and thirty-seconds to the nearest rounded fractions. (Some institutions, however, go down to sixteenths, especially for works on paper.) It is unacceptable to leave dimensions of a third inch, a fifth inch, or a tenth inch.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to put a note on the copyright page of a book or preceding a checklist. Example:\n\nDimensions are in inches (and centimeters); height precedes width precedes depth.\n\nIf the dimensions are unfixed, use “dimensions variable.”\n\nIf the dimensions are given as “life-size,” no further dimensions are needed.\n\nIf the words “sight,” “overall,” or “each” are used to qualify dimensions, these may go at the end of the line, in parentheses if only inch dimensions are used and without parentheses if centimeters are used as well. Examples:\n\n30 x 40 in. (sight)\n\n30 x 40 in. (76.2 x 101.6 cm), sight\n\n30 x 40 in. (76.2 x 101.6 cm), sight\n\nIf a work has more than one part, this information precedes the dimensions. Examples:\n\neight parts, 115 7/8 x 83 1/2 x 10 1/2 in. (294.3 x 212.1 x 26.7 cm) overall\n\nthree panels, each 50 x 30 inches\n\n“Approximately” or “approx.” usually precedes the dimensions. Example:\n\napproximately (or: approx.) 30 x 40”\n\nExamples of dimensions for prints:\n\nimage: 7 7/8 x 12 3/8” (20 x 31.4 cm); sheet: 10 x 14 1/8” (25.4 x 35.9 cm)\n\nsheet, 11 5/16 x 15 13/16 inches; image, 7 9/16 x 11 3/16 inches\n\nsheet, 12 7/8 x 9 7/8 inches; plate, 6 7/8 x 4 inches\n\nExamples of dimensions for sculpture:\n\nDimensions with base, 12 x 13 x 14 in.\n\n12 x 13 x 14 in., with base\n\n12 x 13 x 14 in., without base\n\n12 x 13 x 14 in. overall\n\nExamples of dimensions for three-dimensional decorative objects:\n\n[Bowl] h. 10.3 cm (4 in.), max. diam. 28 cm (11 in.)\n\n[Tumbler] 3 7/8 x 3 1/16” (diam.)\n\nIn text, use numerals for dimensions, use by instead of x, and spell out the word inch and any other dimension. Examples:\n\nThe painting is 9 by 12 inches.\n\nShe used an 8-by-10-inch canvas.\n\nThe Great Pyramid of Cheops is 482 feet high.\n\nSee also Captions, Catalogue entries and checklists, and Measurements Conversion Chart (at Helpful Links).\n\nElectronic media and devices\n\nWEBSITES AND WEB PAGES\n\nWebsite titles are given in roman without quotation marks and are capitalized headline style. Be sure that when referring to a Website, it is differentiated from print materials either by the title, name of sponsor, author, or by a short description. Use quotation marks for titled sections or “pages” within a Website. Website titles that correspond to books or articles can be styled accordingly. Give revision dates for pages that are continuously updated.\n\nExamples:\n\nFacebook\n\nMySpace\n\nMerriam-Webster Online Dictionary\n\nthe Website of the Chicago Tribune; the Chicago Tribune online; chicagotribune.com\n\nGoogle; Google Art Project; “Google Art Project Collections”\n\nChristie’s Art Auctions; “Fine Art Storage Services”\n\nA sample bibliographic Website citation:\n\nSmithsonian Institution. “Exhibitions at the Smithsonian.” Last modified January 11, 2013.\n\nBLOGS AND PODCASTS\n\nCite blogs, named podcasts, and video blogs in a style similar to that used for periodical articles. Include the author of the post; the name of the post; the blog title or description; the name of the parent publication (if there is one); the date of posting; and the URL.\n\nA note example:\n\nMichael Kurcfeld, “An Artist’s Game of Chance on the High Seas,” Arts Beat (blog), New York Times, January 8, 2013.\n\nBlogs that are frequently cited can be included in a bibliography. Note that a date is not included. Example:\n\nRushmore, R. J. “Rae’s Latest Street Sculpture.” Vandalog [blog].\n\nA podcast note example:\n\nAllan McCollum, “Collection of Forty Plaster Surrogates, 1982,” Museum of Modern Art, New York. May 18, 2012. Podcast.\n\nELECTRONIC BOOKS\n\nVarious formats and devices can be used to download electronic books from a bookstore or library, including PDF e-book, Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, Microsoft Reader, and EPUB. They are identified at the end of a full citation. Example:\n\nSouter, Gerry. Frida Kahlo. New York: Parkstone International, 2011. PDF e-book.\n\nFREE ELECTRONIC BOOKS\n\nBooks that have entered the public domain are often available online at no cost. The electronic format should always be given for the source of the text. A full bibliographic example:\n\nSpeed, Harold. The Practice and Science of Drawing. Reprint of 1913 London edition, Project Gutenberg, 2004.\n\nMULTIMEDIA\n\nTo the extent possible, provide full publication details. Include medium information, such as the type of source (examples: podcast, video, DVD), length, and other relevant facts about the original source or performance. The electronic file name, or URL, should be included. Give the date last accessed if the source has no date. Note that electronic content with no formal publisher or sponsoring body has the status of unpublished work, but the copyright restrictions are the same as for any published material.\n\nA note example:\n\n“Mona Lisa’s ‘Twin Sister’ Discovered in Spain’s Prado Art Museum,” YouTube video, 0:53, Asianet News, February 21, 2012.\n\nA bibliographic example:\n\nLuhrmann, Baz. “Commentary.” William Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet,” music ed. DVD. Directed by Baz Luhrmann. Los Angeles: Twentieth Century Fox, 1996.\n\nBrand names for electronic devices (examples: iPod, iPhone) do not need capitalization, even at the beginning of a sentence or a heading.\n\nEllipses\n\nThree ellipsis points indicate an omission within a sentence.\n\nFour ellipsis points indicate an omission of the last part of a sentence, the first part of a sentence, a whole sentence or more, or a whole paragraph or more.\n\nIf three ellipsis points are used, spaces should separate the points from each other and from the words preceding and following. The points should be typed individually; do not use Microsoft Word’s unit ellipsis unless so instructed by the publisher. If four points are used, the first point serves as a period and should not be separated from the preceding word. Example:\n\n“A strong rhythm dominates José Clemente Orozco’s Zapatistas. . . . Diagonal lines . . . dominate the entire composition.”\n\nIf a sentence preceding four ellipsis points ends in a question mark or exclamation point, that punctuation replaces the period, to be followed by three ellipsis points. Example:\n\n“What’s Hecuba to him?. . .”\n\nEllipses are not used to indicate missing or illegible words or parts of words. See Inscriptions.\n\nSee also Quotations.\n\nExhibition catalogues\n\nMost exhibition catalogues share a number of components particular to them. These may include, in order (more or less) from front to back: a list of the exhibition schedule—including the travel itinerary and the exhibition’s funders and sponsors—which often appears on the copyright page; the Contents page (in cases of multiple contributors to the catalogue entries, this may be the only place where the full names of authors who wrote catalogue entries are given); the sponsor’s statement; lenders to the exhibition (may also appear with the back matter); list of trustees; funders (often given on the copyright page); the director’s foreword; acknowledgments, usually listing all the people who contributed money, expertise, writing, or artwork; essay or essays; catalogue entries; chronology; bibliography (possibly including an exhibition history); and index.\n\nThe catalogue entries themselves have several components: catalogue number; artist, nationality, dates; title of work; where created, date; material/medium; dimensions; signature/inscription information; credit line; accession number; text; provenance, or ex coll.; bibliography, or references; exhibitions, or exhibited; condition; related works; remarks. If short forms are used for the elements of bibliography and exhibitions, then the full information will be found in the overall bibliography at the end of the catalogue. For specific instructions, see Catalogue entries and checklists, Chronology, Collections and collectors/Credit lines, Exhibition history, Inscriptions, Notes.\n\nTitles of exhibition catalogues are italicized. See Chicago 8.195.\n\nThere are many ways to style an exhibition catalogue in notes, bibliography, and exhibition history. For purposes of notes and bibliography, the most important information is the publisher, which may be different from the venue. For exhibition histories, the venue is the essential information. It is possible, of course, to offer all of this information, but many formats are tailored to the purpose. Examples:\n\nRosenberg, Pierre. France in the Golden Age. Exh. cat., Metropolitan Museum of Art. New York, 1982. [If the publisher is not the museum, the place of publication should be the publisher’s location.]\n\nMetropolitan Museum of Art. François Boucher. Exh. cat., New York, 1986.\n\nAlain Beausire, “Le Marcottage,” in La Sculpture française au XIXe siècle, exh. cat. (Paris: Editions de la Réunion des Musées Nationaux, 1986), 95. [This gives the publisher rather than the venue.]\n\nBrooks, Rosetta. “Spiritual American.” In Lisa Phillips, Richard Prince (exhibition catalogue). New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1991, 85–108. [This gives the venue as publisher, without copublisher or distributor.]\n\nRuth Butler, “Rodin and the Paris Salon,” in Rodin Rediscovered, ed. Albert E. Elsen [exh. cat., National Gallery of Art] (Washington, D.C., 1981), 21. [This separates the venue and publishing information.]\n\nDayton Art Institute, Ohio, American Expatriate Painters of the Late Nineteenth Century (1976), exh. cat. by Michael Quick, pp. 100–101.\n\nElizabeth Cropper, Pietro Testa, exh. cat., Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Mass., 1988. [If publishing information is different, it may be added in parentheses.]\n\nMiller, Lillian B., ed. The Peale Family. Exh. cat. New York: Abbeville Press in association with the Trust for Museum Exhibitions and the National Portrait Gallery, 1996.\n\nMusée National d’Art Moderne, Paris. Max Beckmann. Paris: Réunion des Musées Nationaux, 1968. [In bibliography, under the heading “Exhibition Catalogues.”]\n\nParis, Grand Palais; New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1974–75. Centenaire de l’impressionnisme. English edition, Impressionism: A Centenary Exhibition. [In bibliography, under the shortened reference Paris, New York 1974–75.]\n\nParis, Musée de l’Orangerie, 1933. Renoir. Catalogue preface by Paul Jamot. [In bibliography, under the shortened reference Paris 1933.]\n\nJohn Plummer, ed. The Glazier Collection of Illuminated Manuscripts. Exh. cat., Pierpont Morgan Library. New York, 1968. [In bibliography, under the shortened reference New York, Glazier Collection, 1968 (to distinguish it from another entry of New York 1968; in such cases, short titles are preferable to letters).]\n\nExhibition history\n\nThis refers to two different elements: a listing of an artist’s exhibitions in an artist monograph or exhibition catalogue, usually preceding the bibliography; and an item in an exhibition catalogue entry listing all the venues where the object was displayed. The latter is also called “Exhibitions” or “Exhibited.”\n\nThe first type may take many forms. Most are divided into solo exhibitions (or one-artist shows) and group exhibitions, both arranged chronologically, from earliest to most recent. If opening and closing dates are used, exhibitions should be arranged chronologically by opening date. If only the year or years are used, then the exhibitions within each year may be arranged alphabetically by venue or by location. (The latter may be more sensible than trying to decide if Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum should be under S or G, and whether Mary Boone Gallery is under M or B. There is no set rule. However, it may not be helpful if many exhibitions took place in the same city.)\n\nThe listing of one-artist exhibitions may omit the titles of the exhibition, which usually consist only of the artist’s name; if the title is different, it may be included. Example:\n\n1982 Associated American Artists Gallery, Philadelphia and New York, Sittings: Portraits by Will Barnet, Terry Dintenfass Gallery, New York.\n\nThe listing of group exhibitions should include the full title of the show. Example:\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, A Forest of Signs: Art in the Crisis of Representation, 1989 [or: September 4–November 17, 1989]\n\nFor traveling exhibitions, the information may be indicated by the simple addition (traveled) at the end of the entry. Otherwise, all travel stops may be listed, usually after the opening venue, with just the year or the entire range of dates, so long as the same information is given for each item throughout. Some sample forms:\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, A Forest of Signs: Art in the Crisis of Representation, September 4–November 17, 1989 (traveled to: Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, December 15, 1989–January 12, 1990).\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, A Forest of Signs: Art in the Crisis of Representation, September 4–November 17, 1989. Traveled to: Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, December 15, 1989–January 12, 1990.\n\n1979 Will Barnet: Twenty Years of Painting and Drawing, Neuberger Museum, State University of New York, College at Purchase, and John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida.\n\n1977 Perceptions of the Spirit in Twentieth-Century American Art, Indianapolis Museum of Art and subsequent tour.\n\nIf the organizing institution is not the first venue, that may be indicated as follows:\n\nWhitney Museum of American Art, New York (organizer), A Forest of Signs: Art in the Crisis of Representation (traveled to: Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, September 4–November 17, 1989; Whitney Museum of American Art, December 15, 1989–January 12, 1990).\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, A Forest of Signs: Art in the Crisis of Representation, September 4–November 17, 1989. Traveled to: Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, December 15, 1989–January 12, 1990 (organizer).\n\nA Forest of Signs: Art in the Crisis of Representation, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, September 4–November 17, 1989; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (organizer), December 15, 1989–January 12, 1990.\n\nIf both venues are co-organizers, that term may simply be added after each venue. Example:\n\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (co-organizer), A Forest of Signs, September 4–November 17, 1989; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (co-organizer), December 15, 1989–January 12, 1990.\n\nExhibition services, such as American Federation of Arts, Independent Curators, and SITES, that organize but do not exhibit may be listed as follows:\n\n1967 American Masters—Art Students League, American Federation of Arts, New York, and subsequent tour.\n\nAmerican Federation of Arts, New York (organizer), American Masters—Art Students League. Traveled to [give venues chronologically by opening date].\n\nThe element “Exhibitions” or “Exhibited” in an exhibition catalogue entry may also take many forms. It may give full exhibition information (venue, location, year, title, number, plate, or page numbers in the catalogue), or it may give shortened names, with full information found in the bibliography. A shortened name may give the location and year only. Examples:\n\nCarnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, 1910, no. 114 or no. 117; Grand Central Art Galleries, New York, 1924, Retrospective Exhibition of Important Works of John Singer Sargent, no. 2, as The Lady with the Rose—My Sister;Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, 1950, The Adelaide Hilton de Groot Loan Collection, no cat.; Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, 1983, Painting in the South (trav. exh.), exh. cat. by D. R. Smith, pp. 48–50; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1987, American Paradise, exh. cat. by J. Howat et al., pp. 48–50, no. 120.\n\nDetroit Institute of Arts, 1940, The Age of Impressionism, no. 27 (Vase of Flowers, lent by the Bignou Gallery, New York); New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1960, Paintings from Private Collections, no. 64; Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, 1987, Franse meesters uit hand Metropolitan Museum of Art, no. 13.\n\nPeale’s portrait gallery (?), Independence Hall, Philadelphia, ca. 1782, then the Peale Museum, Philadelphia, from ca. 1786–1854; The Fabulous Peale Family, Kennedy Galleries, New York, June 13–July 8, 1960; The Voyage of Life, Bayou Bend Museum of Americana at Tenneco, Houston, September 22, 1991–February 26, 1993.\n\nParis 1931, no. 114; Antwerp 1948, no. 227; Amsterdam 1949, no. 123a; Antwerp 1954, no. 267; Essen 1956, no. 409; Edinburgh 1958, no. 102; Athens 1964, no. 63; Brussels 1982, no. Iv. 10; Cologne 1985, no. G 11.\n\nExhibition labels, object labels, wall labels\n\nEvery exhibiting institution has its own style for the identifying labels that appear with the objects displayed in its galleries. Essentially, they repeat the information given in the checklist or catalogue entry, often following the same or a similar format. Labels with text, sometimes called chats or didactics, usually follow the same rules as any other kind of text.\n\nSome exhibition labels are so extensive they have been cited in notes. The following format may be used:\n\nSee Michael Kauffmann, “Typology—the Old Testament,” wall label for Rubens and the Bible, curated by Helen Braham, Courtauld Institute Galleries (Somerset House), London, 1990–93.\n\nExhibition titles\n\nTitles of exhibitions are italicized in upper- and lowercase. Examples:\n\nThe Glory of Byzantium\n\nPrimitivism in Twentieth-Century Art\n\nSome types of exhibitions, however—such as expositions, world’s fairs, or recurrent shows—are usually cited in roman type, upper- and lowercase, as for a title. Examples:\n\nCentennial Exposition, Philadelphia\n\nDocumenta\n\nExposition Universelle, Paris\n\nInternational Exposition of Fine Arts, Barcelona\n\nSalon of 1864\n\nSalon des Refusés\n\nWhitney Biennial\n\nBe sure to cite as titles only the official names of exhibitions. For example, the first Impressionist exhibition is a description, not a title.\n\nTitles of exhibition catalogues are italicized.\n\nExtracts\n\nExtended quotations—the length varies, from more than fifty words to more than one hundred words to more than ten typed lines—are set off from the text with a line space above and below the quotation, indented one-half inch from the left margin, and double-spaced. Extracts should not be enclosed in quotation marks, and any quotations within them should be enclosed with double, not single, quotation marks. An extract placed before the text begins is known as an epigraph.\n\nSee Chicago 13.21–22.\n\nSee also Quotations.\n\nFigure and plate references\n\nMost texts use the words figure and plate spelled out in text and the abbreviations fig. and pl. in parenthetical references and captions. Examples:\n\nFor a painting by Matisse, see figure 2.\n\nMatisse’s Harmony in Red (fig. 2) shows the influence of the rich fabric designs of North Africa.\n\nFig. 2. Henri Matisse, Harmony in Red, . . .\n\nSome museums and publishers prefer capitalizing figure and plate. Example:\n\nIn Kienholz’s Ozymandias Parade (Fig. 72), unlike State Hospital and John Doe (Figs. 43, 65), we find . . .\n\nFor cross-references to illustrations within the book, use a blind reference (see plate 00) and indicate in pencil, circled in the margin, the tentative illustration number or title referred to.\n\nFootnotes\n\nSee Notes.\n\nForeign languages\n\nForeign-language quotations are set out and punctuated in the same way as English-language quotations. If an English translation would be useful to readers, place it either before or after the original quotation. If avoiding clutter is desirable, place the original-language text in an endnote or footnote rather than in the text. If the author of the text has not provided the translation, the translator/source must be given. Foreign-language quotations should not be put in italics or underlined.\n\nCapitalization of publication titles, in notes and bibliographies as well as in text: For the most part, adhere to the rules of sentence-style capitalization for the language in question—that is, capitalize the initial word of the title and subtitle and any words that would normally be capitalized in prose. An English translation can follow in parentheses. Example:\n\nGustave Flaubert’s L’Éducation sentimentale (A Sentimental Education) was published in 1869.\n\nSome publishers follow an alternative rule of capitalizing all words up to and including the first substantive. Example:\n\nLa Jeune Femme\n\nWhichever rule is adopted, follow it consistently. It should be noted that title pages in the original language are not reliable guides in this respect.\n\nForeign titles of artworks are capitalized in the same way as literary titles. In a title, any periods, guillemets (« »), or extra spaces can be changed to reflect standard use. When an artwork is best known by its foreign title, that title should appear first, with the English translation following in parentheses. Example:\n\nLe déjeuner sur l’herbe (Luncheon on the Grass)or (Luncheon on the grass)\n\nHowever, titles of well-known foreign works should be given in English, with the original title (following in parentheses) when the writer thinks it worth including. Example:\n\nA Modern Olympia (Une moderne Olympia)\n\nUse the original language for building names unless they are commonly anglicized. Examples:\n\nSistine Chapel\n\nArc de Triomphe, Paris\n\nMost institutions and publishers follow English-style capitalization for the names of foreign journals, buildings, institutions, and similar categories. Examples:\n\nBeihefte der Historischen Zeitschrift\n\nle Palais du Louvre\n\nThe use of foreign-language words in text should be minimized. Where it is essential, the English translation should be added within parentheses or quotation marks.\n\nForeign words and phrases that are likely to be unfamiliar should be in italics; translations following the foreign language are in parentheses, or quoted, but not both.\n\nMany foreign words and phrases have entered the English language and are no longer italicized. Examples:\n\nfin de siècle\n\ntrompe l’oeil\n\nZeitgeist\n\nA good guide to their status is whether they appear in the latest version of Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary. Also, most proper nouns that are not titles are not italicized. Examples:\n\nthe Curia\n\nthe Stanza d’Eliodoro\n\nthe Piazza del Fonte Moroso.\n\nTraditional English names for foreign places should be used: Florence (not Firenze); Munich (not München). In general, publishers and institutions rely on the first-choice spelling given by Merriam-Webster’s Geographical Dictionary. Foreign publishers’ names are not translated. Example:\n\nMunich: Carl Hanser Verlag, 2012\n\nFor a detailed examination of foreign-language style matters, see Chicago, chapter 11.\n\nHonorifics\n\nOmit honorifics except when thanking a person for help. In general, omit honorifics when citing debts of published or older sources; give honorifics when citing current unpublished ones, such as letters or oral communications. Examples:\n\nDr.\n\nProfessor\n\nM., Mme, Mlle\n\nSig., Sig.ra, Signorina\n\nDott., Dott.ssa\n\nRev.\n\nMsgr\n\nHyphens\n\nTo determine current usage for compound words and words with prefixes and suffixes, consult Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary or Webster’s Third New International Dictionary. Also, see the guidelines in Chicago 7.77–85. If a compound is not hyphenated in any of these sources, it probably should not be hyphenated. Use a hyphen only if the sentence might be ambiguous or confusing without it.\n\nHyphens are not used with most prefixes, such as non-, post-, or semi-. Exceptions are before capitalized words, as in post-Kantian; to separate repeated vowels, as in semi-industrial; or to distinguish homonyms, as in re-creation/recreation. For a list of examples, see Chicago 7.85.\n\nMost compounds with like are closed (that is, do not need a hyphen) unless confusion or misreading would result, for example, when the first element ends in the letter l, consists of three or more syllables, or is a compound word or a proper noun. Examples:\n\ndoglike, seal-like\n\nelephant-like\n\nPicasso-like\n\nNote: A -like compound formed with a proper name (Matisse-like) is incorrect when the comparison is to the artist’s work or style, not the artist personally. In these instances, use Matissian, Disneyesque, Rousseauvian (or Rousseauesque)—or better yet, recast the sentence.\n\nUse hyphens before the noun in color terms. Examples:\n\nblue-black ink\n\nblack-and-white print (but: the print is black and white)\n\ndark-green background\n\nbluish-gray tone\n\nUse hyphens with compound adjectives when they precede the noun but not when they follow it. Examples:\n\nwell-planned event\n\nthe event was well planned\n\nDo not use hyphens with adverbs ending in –ly. Examples:\n\ndimly lit painting\n\npoorly described text\n\nhighly regarded scholar\n\nCentury designations used as adjectives should be hyphenated. Examples:\n\nfourteenth-century Japanese art\n\nmid-sixteenth-century art\n\n300-year-old painting\n\nThe designations early and late, however, do not require hyphens. Examples:\n\nearly twentieth-century art\n\nlate nineteenth-century art\n\nUse a hyphen (not a solidus) to link descriptive nouns preceding a name or the title of a work. Examples:\n\nartist-monk Mokuan Reien\n\nartist-poet Marcel Broodthaers\n\nFrench given names are usually hyphenated (example: Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres), a practice begun in the nineteenth century. It is probably safe to hyphenate all French given names from the late eighteenth century on.\n\nHyphenate the terms e-mail, e-book, and e-pages.\n\nIllustrations\n\nSee Photographs and artwork.\n\nIndex (citing illustrations in)\n\nIt is useful to employ italics in citing pages on which illustrations appear. For a large index, it might be helpful to use small capital letters for the names of artists or places. (Note that when using small caps for this purpose, full caps should be used for those letters that would normally be capitalized. Example: DE KOONING, WILLEM.)\n\nAt the beginning of the index, the following key should appear:\n\nPages on which illustrations appear are in italics.\n\nNames of artists and places are in SMALL CAPITAL LETTERS.\n\nFor indexes limited in space, note that the use of passing references of proper names is less helpful than using themes that run through a text.\n\nSee Chicago, chapter 16.\n\nInscriptions\n\nInscriptions of any type—signatures, labels, stamps, marks—are usually specified for artworks in the catalogue entry or checklist, transcribed word-for-word, line-for-line, along with their location. Letters or words lost through damage are usually indicated by empty brackets (one em space in length) or sometimes simply by a (one em) space. Parentheses indicate letters omitted as the result of abbreviation in the inscription. Words in capital letters are usually set in small capitals. Line divisions are indicated by a solidus/ (with a space—ideally, a hair space—on either side of the solidus). Note that full capital letters are used in the examples below. However, small capital letters may be advisable in some cases.\n\nExamples for paintings:\n\nSigned lower left: C. H. Davis\n\nSigned and dated upper right: W. M. Harnett [in monogram] 1885\n\nSigned and dated lower right: Anna E Klumpke / 1898. Canvas stamp on reverse: 54 Rue N. D. DES CHAMPS PARIS / PAUL FOINET / TOILES COULEURS FINES.\n\nInscribed (on verso): AEt. 50 / 1749; Mrs. Margt. Nicholls of New York, N. America / Grandmother to Mrs. Frances Montresor (below in another hand).\n\nInscribed lower right: “les bêtes de la mer . . . / H. Matisse 50”\n\nSigned and inscribed lower left: G. Courbet / Bruxelles / 1851\n\nSome institutions distinguish between printed and cursive signatures by underlining the cursive signature.\n\nFor sculpture, the following terms may be used to indicate locations: base or base top, base front, base rear, base side, rim of base, base edge, under base, side, corner, back, above base. Examples:\n\nMarkings: ROMAN BRONZE WORKS NY (base, proper left rear); Paul Manship / © 1916 (proper right base top)\n\nInscribed (on back): E.D. PALMER SC. 1861.\n\nThe following example uses three separate lines to convey all the marks:\n\nSigned at front, top of base at right: Copyright by / Frederic Remington\n\nInscribed at rear, top of base along right curve: ROMAN BRONZE WORKS N.Y.\n\nInscribed on underside of base: 49\n\nExamples for prints:\n\nInscribed (below image): VICTORIOUS BOMBARDMENT OF VERA CRUZ. / by the united forces of the Army and Navy of the U. S. March 24th. and 25th. 1847.\n\nExamples for decorative art objects:\n\n[silver cup] Marked: BELL & BRO’S / SAN ANTONIO / TEXAS (incuse, base).\n\nEngraved: Florence [Florence Eager Roberts] (side).\n\n[ceramic coffee urn] Marks: FENN’S PATENT NO. 2 / NEW YORK NO. 2 (stamped on spigot)\n\nItalics\n\nUse roman type for scholarly Latin words and abbreviations. Examples:\n\na priori, ca., cf., e.g., etc.\n\nHowever, italics should be retained for sic, which is always placed in roman brackets: [sic].\n\nItalicize words used as words. Example:\n\nThe term artist here refers to the designer of the object rather than to the manufacturer.\n\nItalicize words and phrases in a foreign language that are likely to be unfamiliar to readers. Examples:\n\ncire perdue, modello (pl. modelli), ricordo\n\nA full sentence or more in a foreign language should be set in roman type. Familiar words and phrases should be in roman type; such words are likely to be found in the latest edition of Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary. Common examples:\n\na priori, cause célèbre, élan, facade, in situ, mea culpa, oeuvre, papier-mâché, pentimento (pl. pentimenti), plein air, repertoire, trompe l’oeil.\n\nSee also Foreign languages, Titles, Titles of artworks, Words and terms.\n\nManuscript locations\n\nIn notes, an abbreviation may be given with the first citation of a manuscript location and used thereafter. Some common examples:\n\nArchives Nationales, Paris (hereafter Arch. Nat. or AN)\n\nArchivio di Stato, Rome (ASR)\n\nArchivio di Stato, Venice (ASV)\n\nBiblioteca Ambrosiana, Milan (Bibl. Ambr. or BA)\n\nBiblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (Bibl. Vat. or BAV) Barb. lat.\n\nBiblioteca Nazionale, Florence (Bibl. Naz.)\n\nBiblioteca Riccardiana (Bibl. Ricc.)\n\nBibliothèque Nationale de France (BNF) ms gr., ms lat.\n\nBodleian Library (Bodl. Lib.) Laud ms Misc.\n\nBritish Library (Brit. Lib.) ms Royal, ms Add., ms Cotton\n\nBritish Museum (Brit. Mus.)\n\nVat. Lib. (Vatican Library) ms Reg. lat. [Reg. probably means “registro.”]\n\nManuscript preparation\n\nPublishers have precise guidelines about the submission of book or journal manuscripts, and it is important to be familiar with their instructions regarding use of software and fonts.\n\nManuscript files may be submitted to publishers as e-mail attachments, or a large number of files may be best submitted on a USB or into a cloud-based application site used by the publisher (example: Dropbox). A PDF version may be required, and a hard copy will usually be required as well. Each file should include the author’s name, the title of the article/book, the software used, and the file name (example: J. Jones, Art of the 1950s, Microsoft Word 2010, manuscript.docx). All files and printouts should be dated, so as to avoid confusion between different versions of the same material.\n\nThe following recommendations satisfy the requirements of most institutions:\n\nEach chapter should be a separate file.The front matter (table of contents, preface, acknowledgments, and foreword) takes up a single file, as does the back matter (appendix, glossary, bibliography, and image-reproduction credits). Complex and lengthy back-matter elements are better treated as separate files. Captions, too, should be in a separate file.\n\nFootnotes and endnotes are placed in the same file as the relevant chapter.Notes in electronic manuscripts can be hyperlinked to the text by the publisher. When a publisher requests that footnotes or endnotes not be embedded in the text, it is sometimes helpful to create a separate file for them. One university press uses embedded notes in endnote function in both a text and a separate notes file, so that notes can be added or deleted as necessary. Note numbers in text should be superscript. In the notes themselves, note numbers should be on the line, not superscript.\n\nAll text elements must be fully double-spaced (not 1.5), including quotations, notes, bibliography, and captions, even if the computer program defaults to single spacing for notes and extracts.Such defaults can be overridden.\n\nAll copy should be flush left, ragged right.Do not justify the right-hand margin; do not center heads. Do not break words (hyphenate) at the ends of lines. Turn off any automatic-hyphenating program.\n\nAllow 1-inch margins at left, right, top, and bottom. (Sometimes a 1 1/2-inch margin at right or at left is helpful.)\n\nIndent prose extracts (block quotations) by changing the margins rather than by using tabs or spaces. Add an extra line space above and below extracts.\n\nTabs—never spaces—should be used for paragraph indents.Do not leave an extra line space between paragraphs unless instructed by the publisher to do so.\n\nUse italic type or roman type underscored for words to be set in italics. Punctuation following italic words is set roman, including parentheses enclosing a word or words completely in italics.\n\nType em (long) dashes, or use two hyphens. Close up space on either side of the dash.\n\nThere should be one space after punctuation—including periods and colons—not two.\n\nDo not place endings of ordinal numbers in superscript (17th); leave them on the line (17th). Override the feature in your computer program that automatically changes ordinals to superscript.\n\nDo not use the lowercase “ell” for the numeral 1.\n\nIf a manuscript is submitted in separate files, each chapter can begin its page numbering at 1, provided it is clear which chapter each page belongs to (examples: “chapter 5:1,” “chapter 5:2”). A manuscript comprising just one file may have consecutive numbering.\n\nPublishers’ instructions will vary on header and footer information in a manuscript. The author’s name, chapter number, and page number should appear in either the header or footer, unless the author has been instructed to keep the author’s name off the manuscript (for example, if it will be sent out for peer review).\n\nGive headings in upper/lowercase headline style (never in all caps) and in roman type (never boldface or italics). Fancy or unusual typefaces are to be avoided. Use an easily readable font in 11- or 12-point type. Some institutions request 12-point Courier. Avoid the use of centering and all-capital letters. Text may be in bold if it is to be so in the final version.\n\nInclude on the first page (cover sheet) of the manuscript:\n\nyour name and address (office and home), telephone/fax numbers (office and home), and e-mail address;\n\nname of the article/book; number of words for each element (text, footnotes, captions, etc.); total number of words, including notes, captions, and all other elements;\n\ncomputer system used (PC, Macintosh), software and version (example: Microsoft Word 2010) or cloud-based application site (example: Google Docs), and the file names for all documents.\n\nIf images are submitted as scans, submit printouts at full size, fully labeled with illustration number and a brief description of the work. Give the file name of each image on the printout or on an accompanying illustration list, along with instructions regarding preferred illustration locations in the manuscript (see Photographs and artwork).\n\nThe hard copy should contain the complete manuscript exactly as it appears in the files, with no handwritten additions and nothing missing. If last-minute changes are made to the files, there must be a new printout of the relevant pages. If handwritten corrections cannot be avoided, they should be brought to the attention of the designer/typesetter/printer with a flag and an arrow in the margin (or other such signal).\n\nThe author and editor should keep backups of the electronic files. The author also needs to keep a record of relevant copyright and intellectual-property materials.\n\nMedia of artworks\n\nThe medium of most artworks takes the form of “medium on support”: oil on canvas; pencil on wove paper (some institutions prefer “graphite” to “pencil”); pen and brown ink with brown wash on paper, and so on.\n\nThe materials used to create an object should be listed in a consistent fashion; both “tempera on wood” or “tempera on panel” are acceptable, but only one form should be used within a single publication. Similarly, if there are two different ways to cite the same medium (gelatin silver [or gelatin-silver] print and black-and-white photograph), just one should be used throughout.\n\nFor decorative arts and textiles, it is preferable to list the principal material(s) first, then the decorative elements. Examples:\n\nporcelain with enamel and gilt decoration\n\nsilk with metallic thread embroidery\n\nTrademarked names must be capitalized (example: Masonite); it may be preferable to substitute generic terms where possible (example: fiberboard).\n\nHere are some examples of media and supports. Trademarked names are noted with TM, followed by a generic version of the given term.\n\nbeech (not beechwood)\n\nbister (preferred to bistre)\n\nBondo (TM)\n\nboxwood\n\nconté/conté crayon\n\nCor-Ten steel (TM)\n\nDacron (TM; polyester)\n\nfaience\n\nfelt-tip pen\n\nFiberglas (TM; fiberglass)\n\nFormica (TM; laminated plastic)\n\nfruitwood\n\ngilt bronze (noun), gilt-bronze (adjective)\n\nguilloche\n\nhandscroll\n\nindia ink/ink\n\nlimewood\n\nLucite (TM; acrylic resin or plastic)\n\nLiquitex (TM)\n\nMasonite (TM; fiberboard)\n\nMylar (TM; polyester film)\n\nocher (preferred to ochre)\n\npapier-mâché\n\nphotocollage\n\nphotoengraving\n\nphotomontage\n\npietra dure\n\nPlexiglas (TM; acrylic plastic or acrylic sheet)\n\nPolaroid (TM)\n\nposterboard\n\nsilkscreen/screenprint, screenprinted\n\nsilver gilt (n.), silver-gilt (a.)\n\nsilverpoint\n\nsoft paste (n.), soft-paste (a.)\n\nterra-cotta (n. and a.)/terra cotta (n.), terra-cotta (a.)/terracotta (n. and a.)\n\ntusche\n\nwoodblock\n\nwoodcut\n\nwood engraving\n\nXerox (TM; photocopy)\n\nNotes\n\nTwo terms are used for notes: footnotes, which are notes placed at the bottom of a page, and endnotes, which appear at the end of an article, chapter, or book. The terms footnotes and endnotes are essentially interchangeable.\n\nNote-reference numbers in the text should be clearly designated by means of superior figures placed at the end of a clause or after punctuation. Note-reference numbers in the notes themselves should be on the same line as the text, followed by a period and one space. Example: 1. John Shearman, . . .\n\nJournal article titles and subheadings in a book chapter may have note-reference numbers. Chapter titles, however, should not have note numbers.\n\nThe author’s name should be given exactly as it appears on the title page of the book or article cited. Chicago 14.72, however, allows replacing initials with the full first name to help identify the author correctly (example: John R. Martin rather than J. R. Martin). If the name appears in different versions, use the fullest version. Be sure to specify “ed.” where applicable. When no author or editor is specified, the institution sponsoring the publication is cited as the author.\n\nWith four or more authors, list the first author followed by “et al.” (example: Chappell et al., “Humanizing Creativity,”. . . )\n\nA colon—not a period, comma, or semicolon—is used to separate the main title and the subtitle, no matter how it appears on the title page. If there is a second subtitle, it is separated by a semicolon and starts with a capital letter (example: Rothko: Intimacy and Humanity; Painting on the Large Scale). A dash in the title, however, should be retained (example: “Self-Portrait—an Account of the Artist as Educator”). All titles should be given either headline-style or sentence-style capitalization. It is also permissible to spell out abbreviated words and numerals. Some editors find it useful to impose standard punctuation as well, such as serial commas and hyphens. See Titles.\n\nExhibition catalogues are indicated by the abbreviation “exh. cat.” Only the year the catalogue is published need be cited, not the exhibition’s range of dates. If the exhibition opened in one year and closed in the next, the opening date is used for the year of publication. Only the sponsoring institution need be given, not the entire list of venues. When the publisher is different from the sponsoring institution, that information may be (but need not be) included. Example: Lise Duclaux et al., Ingres, exh. cat., Petit Palais, Paris, 1967 (Paris: Réunion des Musées Nationaux, 1967). Note that some institutions substitute the publisher for the venue. Example: Lise Duclaux et al., Ingres, exh. cat. (Paris: Réunion des Musées Nationaux, 1967). If the catalogue is cited as a book, that is, omitting the mention “exh. cat.,” then only the publisher’s name is needed. If the catalogue is a copublication between sponsoring institution and publisher, that information, as specified on the title page, should be given. Example: David B. Warren et al., American Decorative Arts and Paintings in the Bayou Bend Collection (Houston: Museum of Fine Arts in association with Princeton University Press, 1998).\n\nInclude the city of publication as cited on the title page or copyright page. If more than one city is given, only the first need be cited. Include the state or country if the city of publication is not well known; use your judgment. Chicago prefers the two-letter postal code, but the standard state abbreviations are acceptable. See Chicago 10.28.\n\nIn publishers’ names, ampersands may be retained or may be changed to “and” so long as consistency is maintained. Examples: New York: Harper and Row. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul.\n\nPublishers’ names may be shortened to exclude “and Co.,” “Inc.,” “Ltd.,” “Publishers,” and the like, so long as they are treated consistently. Avoid truncating a publisher’s name: Alfred A. Knopf, not Knopf. For journals, if the month is included in the date of publication, spell it out or abbreviate it consistently. If seasons are used, uppercase them (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter).\n\nFor journals, distinguish between vol. and no. If the issue number is given, it is not necessary to give the month of publication (although it is not incorrect to include it). Example: Art Bulletin 81, no. 3 (1999). Unless the publication’s pages run consecutively throughout the volume, an issue number or month must be given.\n\nChicago recommends using figures only for volumes and page numbers. Example: (3: 466). Many institutions, however, prefer to identify one or each element. Example: vol. 3, 466, or vol. 3, p. 466.\n\nLowercase all references to parts of a book, in text as well as in notes. Examples:\n\nSee chapter 6.\n\nThe bibliography appears at the end of the article.\n\n16. Hannah Arendt, introduction to Illuminations, by Walter Benjamin . . .\n\nPage numbers should precede references to illustrations. Example: [page] 412, fig. 57.\n\nA shortened form for references may be used to reduce the size of documentation. If there is a complete bibliography, the short form may be used even at the first mention. Example of a full citation in a note:\n\nJean-Michel Rabaté, “A Constellation of Modernist Historiography: Woolf with Benjamin,” Journal of Modern Literature 36, no. 1 (Fall 2012): 163–65.\n\nExample of the short form, which contains the author’s last name, key words from the main title, and the page or page numbers:\n\nRabaté, “Constellation of Modernist Historiography,” 163–65.\n\nFor notes that supplement the author-date system, source citations appear as they do in the text. Example: (2012, 24).\n\nDo not use op. cit. or loc. cit.\n\nUse ibid. (not italicized) only in consecutive references (without intervening citations) to the same work. If note 3 contains two references and note 4 refers to the second reference cited in note 3, use a short form of the reference rather than ibid. in order to avoid ambiguity. Abbreviations for frequently cited journals, archives, series, and the like may be used in the notes if the key to the abbreviations is given at the head of the notes section or bibliography.\n\nNotes and note numbers can be hyperlinked in electronic works.\n\nBOOKS AND EXHIBITION CATALOGUES\n\nRoland Barthes, Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography, trans.
