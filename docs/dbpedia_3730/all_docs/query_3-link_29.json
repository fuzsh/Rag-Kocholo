        "text": "Wilmington says the transaction follows the sale of APM International on 26 April 2024 to Philia Medical Editions SAS, a subsidiary of Europa Group, and represents a significant step forward for the company as it increases the Group’s strategic focus on Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC).\n\nHome to Health Service Journal (HSJ), UK Healthcare is also a provider of data, information, events and advisory solutions across the NHS, pharmaceuticals, med-tech and life sciences sectors.\n\nThe group will now be rebranded under the recognised HSJ name and will comprise of four divisions: HSJ Market Intelligence, HSJ Advisory, HSJ Events and HSJ.co.uk, with the core strength of helping customers and clients understand and engage with the UK healthcare system.\n\nMark Milner, chief executive officer of Wilmington, said: “The sale of our UK Healthcare business completes our divestment of our European healthcare businesses, and I would like to thank the teams at APM and UK Healthcare for their hard work over their time at Wilmington, and wish them and their new business owners the best for the future.\n\n“Our Group is now a high margin, pure-play platform, meaning that we are focusing exclusively on Governance, Risk and Compliance (“GRC”); providing intelligence, data, and training directly to customers who themselves operate in regulated markets. We will continue to strengthen Wilmington Group by seeking high quality GRC assets that demonstrate our required characteristics.”\n\nWill Stamp, founding partner at Inspirit Capital, said: “We are delighted to be investing in HSJ. It is a truly differentiated business given its integrated offering and is well-positioned to capitalise on the ongoing growth in demand for data and information services across the UK healthcare space. The divestment also reinforces Inspirit's status as a trusted partner for delivering corporate carve-out transactions.”\n\nKeep up-to-date with publishing news: sign up here for InPubWeekly, our free weekly e-newsletter."
