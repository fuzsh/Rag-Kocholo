The Self-Assessment requires Programs to take a comprehensive look at its plans, processes, procedures, and capabilities and demonstrate compliance with all 64 standards. EMAP strongly encourages Programs to create rationales, compiled into a Proof of Compliance Report for each standard, for their documentation. These rationales provide that a comprehensive self-assessment has occurred and also provides a crosswalk for assessors during the on-site assessment. How does a Program go about conducting a comprehensive assessment of their plans, processes, procedures, and capabilities? What are assessors looking for in documentation? What information do I put in a rationale? All of these questions and more will be addressed in the webinar.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QaO8ZF7KFgw\n\nMaintenance Best Practices Webinar\n\nAn Emergency Management Program is not a static concept; it has to adapt to the environment.
