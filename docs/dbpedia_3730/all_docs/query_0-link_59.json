Insight and relationships I am respected for my analysis of public policy, politics and management, with excellent networks and specialist knowledge across health and local and central government. As Health Service Journal editor I led the team at the centre of Emap's biggest title. We were essential reading, breaking stories which attracted national attention. Ipsos Mori research gave us some of the highest approval ratings they had seen for a publication. Building and leading teams I am an experienced manager in the media industry. I led the editorial development at Dods Parliamentary Communications, delivering substantial increases in web traffic, major improvements in its magazines and a more integrated, collaborative culture in the editorial team. The titles include PoliticsHome, The House (for MPs and peers), Civil Service World, PublicTechnology and EU Parliament. I bring out the best in my teams. Winning the magazine industryâs top award, the Periodical Publishersâ Association Business Editor of the Year, the judges commended how I âcreate an energetic, rewarding culture and give staff space to innovateâ. At HSJ we grew subscriptions after three years' decline while increasing the price by 31%, grew online traffic and user engagement, doubled online advertising and made the website subscription only. I repositioned LGC to broaden appeal, driving up paid audited subscriptions by 9.8% in one year, and strengthened its reputation for breaking stories and leading debate. A record of achievement The PPA judges concluded: \"His personality comes shining through the workâ¦ demonstrating the importance of what a personal contribution can bring to a brand.\" When I left Emap chief executive David Gilbertson wrote: \"You have built and led an outstanding team and created a climate for reporting excellence which sets high standards for others to match.
