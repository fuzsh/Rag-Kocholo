        "text": "Anna Morley officially became chair of the Engineering Group of the Geological Society (Eggs) at its annual general meeting in June. She succeeds Geotechnical Consulting Group senior partner John Davis.\n\nMorley is an Arup associate director, specialising in engineering geology.\n\nAfter receiving a bachelor’s degree in geology and geography from the University of Birmingham in 1999, Morley took a gap year in the Alps. Her time in the mountains made her realise that she wanted to pursue a career that enabled her to use her degree and be based partly outdoors.\n\nAn MSc in engineering geology at Imperial College London that was run by then-engineering geology reader Mike de Freitas seemed like a good next step. But before she enrolled, de Freitas suggested that Morley get some work experience.\n\nShe picked up a copy of GE and browsed the Geotechnical Services File – since renamed GE100 – which included an A to Z list of the main geotechnical engineering companies in the UK.\n\nShe sent her CV off to several companies on the list, and Arup responded. It offered her some work experience and then supported her while she studied for her MSc at Imperial.\n\nMorley obtained her MSc in 2001 and won the Lapworth Medal, which is presented annually to the best MSc engineering geology student. She then joined Arup as a graduate geologist.\n\nRight from the start of her career Morley was most interested in natural hazards. She also knew that she wanted a career that would give her a mixture of stability and adventure.\n\n“I think I’d always been interested in natural hazards, because that’s the fun bit of geology,” she says.\n\n“So, I was looking for a career where I could work in natural hazards, but have a good career with variety, so a bit of indoors and a bit of outdoor work.\n\nEqually, I knew I didn’t want to be a geologist that traipsed around the jungle for 20 years.”\n\nA cornerstone of her career has been her work on the Whitecliffe project – a former chalk quarry and the largest development site in Ebbsfleet Garden City – which she has been involved with since 2005.\n\n“I was first working on that in a resident engineer role, so I was on site for six months during a summer earthworks period. And I’ve stayed involved with that up to now,” she says.\n\nWhen Morley received the Glossop Award in 2007, the Whitecliffe project was the inspiration for her presentation, titled “Reduce, reuse, recycle: engineering geology of a sustainable housing development, Eastern Quarry, Kent”. Eggs presents the Glossop Award annually to an outstanding early career ground engineer.\n\nMorley has travelled on and off over her career and did a six month stint in Hong Kong for Arup in 2010, working with the natural hazard landslide mapping team.\n\nFor the last eight years, she has been working on diagnosing, quantifying and mitigating natural hazards and risk in developing economies.\n\nMost recently she has been involved in a series of projects based in Sierra Leone for the World Bank and the United Nations Office for Project Services. These have focused on helping the country to mitigate and adapt to natural hazards such as landslides, flooding, coastal erosion and rising sea levels.\n\nMorley presented a talk on the landslide and flood hazard risk assessments at an Eggs evening lecture in 2023. The talk was about work she had carried out with Arup while in Sierra Leone.\n\n“That’s been a long term involvement in various projects in the country, starting with one big project called ‘Multi city hazard and risk’. That looks at three cities, of which Freetown is one of them. I’ve also been helping with a number of different projects in the country,” she says.\n\nMorley observes that she has had a two pronged career path, having simultaneously worked for developed economy clients such as at Whitecliffe and emerging economy clients such as in Sierra Leone.\n\nWhat she enjoys most about these two strands is the diversity of the work.\n\n“You get the variety of scales that you work at, from tiny micro scale if you’re looking at a clay particle, up to macro scale if you’re looking at a country sized map. You get the variety of working indoors and outdoors and also the variety of different countries and ground conditions,” she says.\n\n“If you’re a geologist, it’s really nice to work in different countries and cultures and ground conditions and hazards.”\n\nHer long term work in developed and emerging economies has also deepened Morley’s belief in the importance of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and of achieving them.\n\n“[It’s made me] realise how important the SDGs are to vulnerable countries, like some of those in sub-Saharan Africa where I work, but also how important it is to do the best we can in terms of mitigation and adaptation in developed economies as well.\n\n“Because I’ve been involved with Whitecliffe for so long, it’s allowed me to see the evolution of the journey. And also, to develop a very long term relationship with the client and the site owner. So, I’ve been able to try to shape the sustainability agenda there a bit as well.”\n\nEggs involvement\n\nMorley first became involved in Eggs in around 2009, after which she spent a few years on the group’s main committee.\n\n“I really enjoyed being on the committee and being involved with making change, basically. And finding good ways to reach the community,” she says.\n\nMorley benefited from the Eggs evening lectures, often hosted at the Geological Society in London. When she worked in Hong Kong, she also attended the lectures put on by the active Eggs special interest group there.\n\nMorley was then the secretary for Engineering Geology and Geomorphology of Glacial and Periglaciated Terrains, SPE28, a special publication on glacial and periglacial ground conditions. Eggs sponsored a working party that culminated in the publication of a state of the art guidance document.\n\n“The authorship and the editors were made up of real experts from industry and academia – and more than a handful of Glossop lecturers,” Morley explains.\n\n“Just being in the same space and discussing these things with them, you learn a lot. And I’m really proud of the publication; it’s a really well received and well used book”.\n\nMorley was also involved in the organising committee for the Eggs European earthworks conference in 2009.\n\n“From that I got the idea of how to run events that were of benefit to the members. And I’ve learned a lot about earthworks from them, because of my involvement in the Whitecliffe project.\n\nAs it’s in a former Chalk quarry, Whitecliffe is a very large earthworks project in the main.”\n\nDuring her tenure as Eggs chair, Morley would like to “nurture and mature” the offering of the Eggs Early Career Group that was launched under John Davis’ tenure. She hopes it will mirror the success of the British Geotechnical Association Early Career Group.\n\n“I think there’s also a good opportunity to renew collaboration with other special interest groups. There’s some special interest groups of the Geological Society and of the ICE [Institution of Civil Engineers] that we could foster stronger collaborations with, and co-host evening meetings.\n\n“I would also like to reach out and get a bit more feedback from our membership as to how they want to be supported, particularly around learning events,” she says.\n\nOpportunities and challenges\n\nMorley believes there are more opportunities than challenges for the sector going forward. But she acknowledges that “sadly the educational recruitment side still needs an injection from industry in terms of support”.\n\nShe notes: “There are not very many universities that host MSc courses in engineering geology, but some really good ones are producing really good high-quality candidates. So, they should be supported. And we had some good conversations at our annual conference about supporting the new degree apprenticeships.”\n\nMorley continues to be passionate about driving sustainability in the sector.\n\n“Engineering geologists have got a really important role to play in society to lead the conversation on SDGs and also work within planetary boundaries,” she says.\n\n“The beauty of the SDGs is they’re a framework that can be applied anywhere, in any part of the world, so they’re a good starting point for projects.\n\n“They can help you to tailor your advice for clients and make the sustainable agenda business as usual.\n\n“I think from an engineering geology point of view, it’s about bringing it to the forefront of people’s minds, and showing how we can really make a difference.”"
