        "text": "Emap is selling its magazines and radio businesses to German publishing group Heinrich Bauer for £1.14bn.\n\nThe company also announced this morning that it will not sell its business-to-business arm, which includes trade magazines and exhibitions.\n\nThe widely anticipated sale to Bauer, which publishes Bella, Take a Break and TV Quick in Britain, will mean Emap can return approximately £1bn in proceeds to its shareholders.\n\nThe company added in a statement: \"Following the disposal of Emap Consumer Media and Emap Radio, Emap will be a focused b-to-b business. As part of the overall review, Emap assessed all options for Emap Communications, including a possible disposal. However, the board believes that the best value for shareholders will be achieved through continuing to operate this focused business on a standalone basis and, accordingly, the board has terminated all discussions with parties interested in Emap Communications.\"\n\nEmap put itself up for sale in July following shareholder pressure, approaches from possible buyers and a languishing share price. The business-to-business arm was seen to be the most attractive of the Emap assets on offer and it had attracted widespread interest from private equity and trade buyers.\n\nInterested parties included private equity firms Cinven and Candover, and there was a joint bid from Apax and Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Guardian and Observer newspapers.\n\nAnalysts had predicted the business-to-business arm could fetch as much as £1.3bn.\n\nExecutive chairman Alun Cathcart, who took over running the group earlier this year when long-time chief executive Tom Moloney left, said Emap would now be a \"focused business-to-business company\" with strong cashflows.\n\n\"We are pleased to have achieved a successful outcome in the review of Emap's group structure. The price achieved for Emap Consumer Media and Emap Radio fully reflects the value of the two divisions,\" he said.\n\nFollowing the radio and magazines sales, Derek Carter, currently chief executive of Emap Communications, will become chief executive of Emap. Ian Griffiths becomes deputy chief executive and remains as finance director. Alun Cathcart will revert to non-executive chairman and \"will work with the new management team of Emap until a new non-executive chairman has been appointed.\"\n\nThe £1.14bn achieved for radio and magazines is roughly in line with analysts' forecasts. They had predicted the former could fetch £450m and the latter £700m.\n\nThe magazines arm is the UK's second-largest consumer magazine publisher with titles such as Heat, Closer, Grazia, FHM and Angling Times.\n\nEmap Radio is the UK's second largest commercial radio operator, with 38 local stations and a digital radio network. Its top brands include Magic and Kiss.\n\nCitigroup and Lazard ran the Emap sales process."
