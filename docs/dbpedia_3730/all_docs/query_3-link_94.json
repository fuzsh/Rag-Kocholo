It brings together individual specialties from different fields, notably health management, health policy, and health economics into a dynamic academic mix.\n\nIJHPM is intended to enhance communication among health system researchers, policy and decision makers, legislators, practitioners, educators, administrators, students, and other types of allied health professionals in the research and healthcare delivery systems. Geographical coverage including coverage of the poorest countries and low- and middle- income countries is a priority at the IJHPM.\n\nAll submissions to the IJHPM undergo a fair, supportive and double-blind peer-review process and our acceptance rate is about 9%. We follow the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, issued by International Committee for Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), as well as the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) code of conduct for editors.\n\nNote: IJHPM is not The International Journal of Health Planning and Management, which is published by Wiley.\n\nAbstracting and Indexing:\n\nWoS Journal Citation Reports (Social Sciences Edition) / WoS Science Citation Index Expanded (SciSearch®) / WoS Journal Citation Reports (Science Edition) / WoS Social Sciences Citation Index® / WoS Current Contents® (Social and Behavioral Sciences) / MEDLINE / Scopus / EBSCOhost / PubMed Central (PMC) / Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) / Index Medicus (IMEMR) / Google Scholar / Cabell's Directory / Ulrich Global Serials Directory / International Political Science Abstracts (IPSA) / OCLC Worldcat / Islamic World Science Citation Center (ISC) / Scientific Information Database (SID) / Magiran / Barakatkns\n\nIf your question is not addressed on these pages, then the journal’s Editorial Staff at Kerman University of Medical Sciences will be pleased to help you.\n\nLast updated: January 07, 2023"
