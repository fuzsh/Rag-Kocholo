For queries post acceptance, please contact the Supplier Project Manager. These details can be found in the Editorial Team section.\n\nAuthor responsibilities\n\nOur goal is to provide you with a professional and courteous experience at each stage of the review and publication process. There are also some responsibilities that sit with you as the author. Our expectation is that you will:\n\nRespond swiftly to any queries during the publication process.\n\nBe accountable for all aspects of your work. This includes investigating and resolving any questions about accuracy or research integrity.\n\nTreat communications between you and the journal editor as confidential until an editorial decision has been made.\n\nRead about our research ethics for authorship. These state that you must:\n\nInclude anyone who has made a substantial and meaningful contribution to the submission (anyone else involved in the paper should be listed in the acknowledgements).\n\nExclude anyone who hasn’t contributed to the paper, or who has chosen not to be associated with the research.\n\nIn accordance with COPE’s position statement on AI tools, Large Language Models cannot be credited with authorship as they are incapable of conceptualising a research design without human direction and cannot be accountable for the integrity, originality, and validity of the published work. The author(s) must describe the content created or modified as well as appropriately cite the name and version of the AI tool used; any additional works drawn on by the AI tool should also be appropriately cited and referenced. Standard tools that are used to improve spelling and grammar are not included within the parameters of this guidance. The Editor and Publisher reserve the right to determine whether the use of an AI tool is permissible.\n\nIf your article involves human participants, you must ensure you have considered whether or not you require ethical approval for your research, and include this information as part of your submission. Find out more about informed consent.\n\nGenerative AI usage key principles\n\nCopywriting any part of an article using a generative AI tool/LLM would not be permissible, including the generation of the abstract or the literature review, for as per Emerald’s authorship criteria, the author(s) must be responsible for the work and accountable for its accuracy, integrity, and validity.\n\nThe generation or reporting of results using a generative AI tool/LLM is not permissible, for as per Emerald’s authorship criteria, the author(s) must be responsible for the creation and interpretation of their work and accountable for its accuracy, integrity, and validity.\n\nThe in-text reporting of statistics using a generative AI tool/LLM is not permissible due to concerns over the authenticity, integrity, and validity of the data produced, although the use of such a tool to aid in the analysis of the work would be permissible.\n\nCopy-editing an article using a generative AI tool/LLM in order to improve its language and readability would be permissible as this mirrors standard tools already employed to improve spelling and grammar, and uses existing author-created material, rather than generating wholly new content, while the author(s) remains responsible for the original work.\n\nThe submission and publication of images created by AI tools or large-scale generative models is not permitted.\n\nResearch and publishing ethics\n\nOur editors and employees work hard to ensure the content we publish is ethically sound. To help us achieve that goal, we closely follow the advice laid out in the guidelines and flowcharts on the COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) website.\n\nWe have also developed our research and publishing ethics guidelines. If you haven’t already read these, we urge you to do so – they will help you avoid the most common publishing ethics issues.\n\nA few key points:\n\nAny manuscript you submit to this journal should be original. That means it should not have been published before in its current, or similar, form. Exceptions to this rule are outlined in our pre-print and conference paper policies. If any substantial element of your paper has been previously published, you need to declare this to the journal editor upon submission. Please note, the journal editor may use Crossref Similarity Check to check on the originality of submissions received. This service compares submissions against a database of 49 million works from 800 scholarly publishers.\n\nYour work should not have been submitted elsewhere and should not be under consideration by any other publication.\n\nIf you have a conflict of interest, you must declare it upon submission; this allows the editor to decide how they would like to proceed. Read about conflict of interest in our research and publishing ethics guidelines.\n\nBy submitting your work to Emerald, you are guaranteeing that the work is not in infringement of any existing copyright.\n\nThird party copyright permissions\n\nPrior to article submission, you need to ensure you’ve applied for, and received, written permission to use any material in your manuscript that has been created by a third party. Please note, we are unable to publish any article that still has permissions pending. The rights we require are:\n\nNon-exclusive rights to reproduce the material in the article or book chapter.\n\nPrint and electronic rights.\n\nWorldwide English-language rights.\n\nTo use the material for the life of the work. That means there should be no time restrictions on its re-use e.g. a one-year licence.\n\nWe are a member of the International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers (STM) and participate in the STM permissions guidelines, a reciprocal free exchange of material with other STM publishers. In some cases, this may mean that you don’t need permission to re-use content. If so, please highlight this at the submission stage.\n\nPlease take a few moments to read our guide to publishing permissions to ensure you have met all the requirements, so that we can process your submission without delay.\n\nOpen access submissions and information\n\nAll our journals currently offer two open access (OA) publishing paths; gold open access and green open access.\n\nIf you would like to, or are required to, make the branded publisher PDF (also known as the version of record) freely available immediately upon publication, you can select the gold open access route once your paper is accepted.\n\nIf you’ve chosen to publish gold open access, this is the point you will be asked to pay the APC (article processing charge). This varies per journal and can be found on our APC price list or on the editorial system at the point of submission. Your article will be published with a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 user licence, which outlines how readers can reuse your work.\n\nAlternatively, if you would like to, or are required to, publish open access but your funding doesn’t cover the cost of the APC, you can choose the green open access, or self-archiving, route. As soon as your article is published, you can make the author accepted manuscript (the version accepted for publication) openly available, free from payment and embargo periods.\n\nYou can find out more about our open access routes, our APCs and waivers and read our FAQs on our open research page.\n\nFind out about open\n\nTransparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines\n\nWe are a signatory of the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines, a framework that supports the reproducibility of research through the adoption of transparent research practices. That means we encourage you to:\n\nCite and fully reference all data, program code, and other methods in your article.\n\nInclude persistent identifiers, such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), in references for datasets and program codes. Persistent identifiers ensure future access to unique published digital objects, such as a piece of text or datasets. Persistent identifiers are assigned to datasets by digital archives, such as institutional repositories and partners in the Data Preservation Alliance for the Social Sciences (Data-PASS).\n\nFollow appropriate international and national procedures with respect to data protection, rights to privacy and other ethical considerations, whenever you cite data. For further guidance please refer to our research and publishing ethics guidelines. For an example on how to cite datasets, please refer to the references section below.\n\nPrepare your submission\n\nManuscript support services\n\nWe are pleased to partner with Editage, a platform that connects you with relevant experts in language support, translation, editing, visuals, consulting, and more. After you’ve agreed a fee, they will work with you to enhance your manuscript and get it submission-ready.\n\nThis is an optional service for authors who feel they need a little extra support. It does not guarantee your work will be accepted for review or publication.\n\nVisit Editage\n\nManuscript requirements\n\nBefore you submit your manuscript, it’s important you read and follow the guidelines below. You will also find some useful tips in our structure your journal submission how-to guide.\n\nFormat\n\nArticle files should be provided in Microsoft Word format.\n\nWhile you are welcome to submit a PDF of the document alongside the Word file, PDFs alone are not acceptable. LaTeX files can also be used but only if an accompanying PDF document is provided. Acceptable figure file types are listed further below.\n\nArticle length / word count\n\nArticles should be between 4000 and 7500 words in length. This includes all text, for example, the structured abstract, references, all text in tables, and figures and appendices.\n\nPlease allow 280 words for each figure or table.\n\nArticle title\n\nA concisely worded title should be provided.\n\nAuthor details\n\nThe names of all contributing authors should be added to the ScholarOne submission; please list them in the order in which you’d like them to be published. Each contributing author will need their own ScholarOne author account, from which we will extract the following details:\n\nAuthor email address (institutional preferred).\n\nAuthor name. We will reproduce it exactly, so any middle names and/or initials they want featured must be included.\n\nAuthor affiliation. This should be where they were based when the research for the paper was conducted.\n\nIn multi-authored papers, it’s important that ALL authors that have made a significant contribution to the paper are listed. Those who have provided support but have not contributed to the research should be featured in an acknowledgements section. You should never include people who have not contributed to the paper or who don’t want to be associated with the research. Read about our research ethics for authorship.\n\nBiographies and acknowledgements\n\nIf you want to include these items, save them in a separate Microsoft Word document and upload the file with your submission. Where they are included, a brief professional biography of not more than 100 words should be supplied for each named author.\n\nResearch funding\n\nYour article must reference all sources of external research funding in the acknowledgements section. You should describe the role of the funder or financial sponsor in the entire research process, from study design to submission.\n\nStructured abstract\n\nAll submissions must include a structured abstract, following the format outlined below.\n\nThese four sub-headings and their accompanying explanations must always be included:\n\nPurpose\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nFindings\n\nOriginality\n\nThe following three sub-headings are optional and can be included, if applicable:\n\nResearch limitations/implications\n\nPractical implications\n\nSocial implications\n\nYou can find some useful tips in our write an article abstract how-to guide.\n\nThe maximum length of your abstract should be 250 words in total, including keywords and article classification (see the sections below).\n\nKeywords\n\nYour submission should include up to 12 appropriate and short keywords that capture the principal topics of the paper. Our Creating an SEO-friendly manuscript how to guide contains some practical guidance on choosing search-engine friendly keywords.\n\nPlease note, while we will always try to use the keywords you’ve suggested, the in-house editorial team may replace some of them with matching terms to ensure consistency across publications and improve your article’s visibility.\n\nArticle classification\n\nDuring the submission process, you will be asked to select a type for your paper; the options are listed below. If you don’t see an exact match, please choose the best fit:\n\nOriginal Article\n\nCase Study\n\nConceptual Paper\n\nBook Review\n\nInterview\n\nYou will also be asked to select a category for your paper. The options for this are listed below. If you don’t see an exact match, please choose the best fit:\n\nResearch paper. Reports on any type of research undertaken by the author(s), including:\n\nThe construction or testing of a model or framework\n\nAction research\n\nTesting of data, market research or surveys\n\nEmpirical, scientific or clinical research\n\nPapers with a practical focus\n\nViewpoint. Covers any paper where content is dependent on the author's opinion and interpretation. This includes journalistic and magazine-style pieces.\n\nTechnical paper. Describes and evaluates technical products, processes or services.\n\nConceptual paper. Focuses on developing hypotheses and is usually discursive. Covers philosophical discussions and comparative studies of other authors’ work and thinking.\n\nCase study. Describes actual interventions or experiences within organizations. It can be subjective and doesn’t generally report on research. Also covers a description of a legal case or a hypothetical case study used as a teaching exercise.\n\nLiterature review. This category should only be used if the main purpose of the paper is to annotate and/or critique the literature in a particular field. It could be a selective bibliography providing advice on information sources, or the paper may aim to cover the main contributors to the development of a topic and explore their different views.\n\nGeneral review. Provides an overview or historical examination of some concept, technique or phenomenon. Papers are likely to be more descriptive or instructional (‘how to’ papers) than discursive.\n\nHeadings\n\nHeadings must be concise, with a clear indication of the required hierarchy.\n\nThe preferred format is for first level headings to be in bold, and subsequent sub-headings to be in medium italics.\n\nNotes/endnotes\n\nNotes or endnotes should only be used if absolutely necessary. They should be identified in the text by consecutive numbers enclosed in square brackets. These numbers should then be listed, and explained, at the end of the article.\n\nFigures\n\nAll figures (charts, diagrams, line drawings, webpages/screenshots, and photographic images) should be submitted electronically. Both colour and black and white files are accepted.\n\nThere are a few other important points to note:\n\nAll figures should be supplied at the highest resolution/quality possible with numbers and text clearly legible.\n\nAcceptable formats are .ai, .eps, .jpeg, .bmp, and .tif.\n\nElectronic figures created in other applications should be supplied in their original formats and should also be either copied and pasted into a blank MS Word document, or submitted as a PDF file.\n\nAll figures should be numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals and have clear captions.\n\nAll photographs should be numbered as Plate 1, 2, 3, etc. and have clear captions.\n\nAll figure/table captions should include the necessary credit line, acknowledgement, or attribution if you have been given permission to use the figure/table; if the figure/table is the property of the author(s), this should be acknowledged in the caption.\n\nTables\n\nTables should be typed and submitted in a separate file to the main body of the article. The position of each table should be clearly labelled in the main body of the article with corresponding labels clearly shown in the table file. Tables should be numbered consecutively in Roman numerals (e.g. I, II, etc.).\n\nGive each table a brief title. Ensure that any superscripts or asterisks are shown next to the relevant items and have explanations displayed as footnotes to the table, figure or plate.\n\nSupplementary files\n\nWhere tables, figures, appendices, and other additional content are supplementary to the article but not critical to the reader’s understanding of it, you can choose to host these supplementary files alongside your article on Insight, Emerald’s content-hosting platform (this is Emerald's recommended option as we are able to ensure the data remain accessible), or on an alternative trusted online repository. All supplementary material must be submitted prior to acceptance.\n\nEmerald recommends that authors use the following two lists when searching for a suitable and trusted repository:\n\nhttps://commons.datacite.org/repositories\n\nhttps://www.re3data.org\n\nIf you choose to host your supplementary files on Insight, you must submit these as separate files alongside your article. Files should be clearly labelled in such a way that makes it clear they are supplementary; Emerald recommends that the file name is descriptive and that it follows the format ‘Supplementary_material_appendix_1’ or ‘Supplementary tables’. All supplementary material must be mentioned at the appropriate moment in the main text of the article; there is no need to include the content of the file only the file name. A link to the supplementary material will be added to the article during production, and the material will be made available alongside the main text of the article at the point of EarlyCite publication.\n\nPlease note that Emerald will not make any changes to the material; it will not be copy-edited or typeset, and authors will not receive proofs of this content. Emerald therefore strongly recommends that you style all supplementary material ahead of acceptance of the article.\n\nEmerald Insight can host the following file types and extensions:\n\nAdobe Acrobat (.pdf)\n\nMS Word document (.doc, .docx)\n\nMS Excel (.xls, xlsx)\n\nMS PowerPoint (.pptx)\n\nImage (.png, .jpeg, .gif)\n\nPlain ASCII text (.txt)\n\nPostScript (.ps)\n\nRich Text Format (.rtf)\n\nIf you choose to use an alternative trusted online repository, you should ensure that the supplementary material is hosted on the repository ahead of submission, and then include a link only to the repository within the article. It is the responsibility of the submitting author to ensure that the material is free to access and that it remains permanently available. Where an alternative trusted online repository is used, the files hosted should always be presented as read-only; please be aware that such usage risks compromising your anonymity during the review process if the repository contains any information that may enable the reviewer to identify you; as such, we recommend that all links to alternative repositories are reviewed carefully prior to submission.\n\nPlease note that extensive supplementary material may be subject to peer review; this is at the discretion of the journal Editor and dependent on the content of the material (for example, whether including it would support the reviewer making a decision on the article during the peer review process).\n\nReferences\n\nAll references in your manuscript must be formatted using one of the recognised Harvard styles. You are welcome to use the Harvard style Emerald has adopted – we’ve provided a detailed guide below. Want to use a different Harvard style? That’s fine, our typesetters will make any necessary changes to your manuscript if it is accepted. Please ensure you check all your citations for completeness, accuracy and consistency.\n\nEmerald’s Harvard referencing style\n\nReferences to other publications in your text should be written as follows:\n\nSingle author: (Adams, 2006)\n\nTwo authors: (Adams and Brown, 2006)\n\nThree or more authors: (Adams et al., 2006) Please note, ‘et al' should always be written in italics.\n\nA few other style points. These apply to both the main body of text and your final list of references.\n\nWhen referring to pages in a publication, use ‘p.(page number)’ for a single page or ‘pp.(page numbers)’ to indicate a page range.\n\nPage numbers should always be written out in full, e.g. 175-179, not 175-9.\n\nWhere a colon or dash appears in the title of an article or book chapter, the letter that follows that colon or dash should always be lower case.\n\nWhen citing a work with multiple editors, use the abbreviation ‘Ed.s’.\n\nAt the end of your paper, please supply a reference list in alphabetical order using the style guidelines below. Where a DOI is available, this should be included at the end of the reference.\n\nFor books\n\nSurname, initials (year), title of book, publisher, place of publication.\n\ne.g. Harrow, R.

A few other important points:\n\nGive the journal aims and scope a final read. Is your manuscript definitely a good fit? If it isn’t, the editor may decline it without peer review.\n\nDoes your manuscript comply with our research and publishing ethics guidelines?\n\nHave you cleared any necessary publishing permissions?\n\nHave you followed all the formatting requirements laid out in these author guidelines?\n\nDoes the manuscript contain any information that might help the reviewer identify you? This could compromise the anonymous peer review process. A few tips:\n\nIf you need to refer to your own work, use wording such as ‘previous research has demonstrated’ not ‘our previous research has demonstrated’.\n\nIf you need to refer to your own, currently unpublished work, don’t include this work in the reference list.\n\nAny acknowledgments or author biographies should be uploaded as separate files.\n\nCarry out a final check to ensure that no author names appear anywhere in the manuscript. This includes in figures or captions.\n\nYou will find a helpful submission checklist on the website Think.Check.Submit.\n\nThe submission process\n\nAll manuscripts should be submitted through our editorial system by the corresponding author.\n\nThe only way to submit to the journal is through the journal’s ScholarOne site as accessed via the Emerald website, and not by email or through any third-party agent/company, journal representative, or website. Submissions should be done directly by the author(s) through the ScholarOne site and not via a third-party proxy on their behalf.\n\nA separate author account is required for each journal you submit to. If this is your first time submitting to this journal, please choose the Create an account or Register now option in the editorial system. If you already have an Emerald login, you are welcome to reuse the existing username and password here.\n\nPlease note, the next time you log into the system, you will be asked for your username. This will be the email address you entered when you set up your account.\n\nDon't forget to add your ORCiD ID during the submission process. It will be embedded in your published article, along with a link to the ORCiD registry allowing others to easily match you with your work.\n\nDon’t have one yet? It only takes a few moments to register for a free ORCiD identifier.\n\nVisit the ScholarOne support centre for further help and guidance.\n\nWhat you can expect next\n\nYou will receive an automated email from the journal editor, confirming your successful submission. It will provide you with a manuscript number, which will be used in all future correspondence about your submission. If you have any reason to suspect the confirmation email you receive might be fraudulent, please contact the journal editor in the first instance.\n\nPost submission\n\nReview and decision process\n\nEach submission is checked by the editor. At this stage, they may choose to decline or unsubmit your manuscript if it doesn’t fit the journal aims and scope, or they feel the language/manuscript quality is too low.\n\nIf they think it might be suitable for the publication, they will send it to at least two independent referees for double anonymous peer review. Once these reviewers have provided their feedback, the editor may decide to accept your manuscript, request minor or major revisions, or decline your work.\n\nThis journal offers an article transfer service. If the editor decides to decline your manuscript, either before or after peer review, they may offer to transfer it to a more relevant Emerald journal in this field. If you accept, your ScholarOne author account, and the accounts of your co-authors, will automatically transfer to the new journal, along with your manuscript and any accompanying peer review reports. However, you will still need to log in to ScholarOne to complete the submission process using your existing username and password. While accepting a transfer does not guarantee the receiving journal will publish your work, an editor will only suggest a transfer if they feel your article is a good fit with the new title.\n\nWhile all journals work to different timescales, the goal is that the editor will inform you of their first decision within 60 days.\n\nDuring this period, we will send you automated updates on the progress of your manuscript via our submission system, or you can log in to check on the current status of your paper. Each time we contact you, we will quote the manuscript number you were given at the point of submission. If you receive an email that does not match these criteria, it could be fraudulent and we recommend you contact the journal editor in the first instance.\n\nManuscript transfer service\n\nEmerald’s manuscript transfer service takes the pain out of the submission process if your manuscript doesn’t fit your initial journal choice. Our team of expert Editors from participating journals work together to identify alternative journals that better align with your research, ensuring your work finds the ideal publication home it deserves. Our dedicated team is committed to supporting authors like you in finding the right home for your research.\n\nIf a journal is participating in the manuscript transfer program, the Editor has the option to recommend your paper for transfer. If a transfer decision is made by the Editor, you will receive an email with the details of the recommended journal and the option to accept or reject the transfer. It’s always down to you as the author to decide if you’d like to accept. If you do accept, your paper and any reviewer reports will automatically be transferred to the recommended journals. Authors will then confirm resubmissions in the new journal’s ScholarOne system.\n\nOur Manuscript Transfer Service page has more information on the process.\n\nIf your submission is accepted\n\nOpen access\n\nOnce your paper is accepted, you will have the opportunity to indicate whether you would like to publish your paper via the gold open access route.\n\nIf you’ve chosen to publish gold open access, this is the point you will be asked to pay the APC (article processing charge). This varies per journal and can be found on our APC price list or on the editorial system at the point of submission. Your article will be published with a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 user licence, which outlines how readers can reuse your work.\n\nFor UK journal article authors - if you wish to submit your work accepted by Emerald to REF 2021, you must make a ‘closed deposit’ of your accepted manuscript to your respective institutional repository upon acceptance of your article. Articles accepted for publication after 1st April 2018 should be deposited as soon as possible, but no later than three months after the acceptance date. For further information and guidance, please refer to the REF 2021 website.\n\nCopyright\n\nAll accepted authors are sent an email with a link to a licence form. This should be checked for accuracy, for example whether contact and affiliation details are up to date and your name is spelled correctly, and then returned to us electronically. If there is a reason why you can’t assign copyright to us, you should discuss this with your journal content editor. You will find their contact details on the editorial team section above.\n\nProofing and typesetting\n\nOnce we have received your completed licence form, the article will pass directly into the production process. We will carry out editorial checks, copyediting, and typesetting and then return proofs to you (if you are the corresponding author) for your review. This is your opportunity to correct any typographical errors, grammatical errors or incorrect author details. We can’t accept requests to rewrite texts at this stage.\n\nWhen the page proofs are finalised, the fully typeset and proofed version of record is published online. This is referred to as the EarlyCite version. While an EarlyCite article has yet to be assigned to a volume or issue, it does have a digital object identifier (DOI) and is fully citable. It will be compiled into an issue according to the journal’s issue schedule, with papers being added by chronological date of publication.\n\nHow to share your paper\n\nVisit our author rights page to find out how you can reuse and share your work.\n\nTo find tips on increasing the visibility of your published paper, read about how to promote your work.\n\nCorrecting inaccuracies in your published paper\n\nSometimes errors are made during the research, writing and publishing processes. When these issues arise, we have the option of withdrawing the paper or introducing a correction notice. Find out more about our article withdrawal and correction policies.\n\nNeed to make a change to the author list? See our frequently asked questions (FAQs) below.\n\nFrequently asked questions"
