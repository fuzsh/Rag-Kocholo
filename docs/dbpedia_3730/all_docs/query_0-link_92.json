        "text": "Shadow Chancellor George Osborne has calculated that taking control of public sector advertising - traditionally a revenue stream for magazine and print publishers - and doing it all online, could save taxpayers £700m. He proposes a one-stop shop for the public sector procuring bodies, which number more than 100,000 and currently advertise most of their vacancies separately.\n\nThe present Government hosts several recruitment sites, most notably jobs.nhs.uk for the NHS, the UK's largest employer with more than 1.3 million employees and 600 separate employers. A further site for the Department for Education and Skills is understood to be in development.\n\nThe NHS site hosts almost 5,000 vacancies and is a thorn in the side of established hosts of job ads such as The Guardian, Times Educational Supplement, local papers, specialist titles from Emap, Haymarket and Reed Business Information and independent stand-alone websites.\n\nA spokesman for the site claims more than 90% of NHS employers use the site to recruit around 100,000 people a year and are increasingly making it their first port of call.\n\nBudget restraints\n\nPublic sector publications are already suffering from a recruitment downturn after the highs of the early New Labour years. Recruitment ad revenues at Emap's public sector titles were down by 37% in the six months to 30 September, with Health Service Journal and Nursing Times particularly hit by NHS budget restraints. Therapy Weekly, Emap's free title entirely dependent on public sector job ads for its revenues, is due to close this week.\n\nResearch from digital agency I-Level's market intelligence arm, Generator, suggests that only around 21% of public sector workers look for jobs online.\n\nYet an estimated 70% of public sector jobs are now online, reflecting the medium's wider growth in recruitment and classified ads, and publishers have adapted their business models to manage this change.\n\nHaymarket, which also publishes Media Week, recently launched thirdsectorjobs.com to target workers in the charity sector. And independent magazine Public Finance is launching a stand-alone site, pfjobs.co.uk, in the New Year.\n\nSimon Devitt, online publisher at Haymarket Professional, says: \"The most successful strategy is combining print and online, but it's not clear how long this will continue.\"\n\nStuart Taylor, commercial director of The Guardian, is laying the groundwork for an increasingly online future. \"We offer clients an integrated package and don't specify in advance that they have to do print or online, but our online option is below the price of using the paper.\"\n\nPublishers roundly dismiss Osborne's plan as recycled hot air. The TES, for example, says his claim that 18 vacancies in the magazine costs £30,000 overestimates the real figure by more than £20,000.\n\nBut the Government's moves have struck a nerve. Simon Headington, who operates the independent site nhsjobs.com, currently hosting less than 700 ads, says: \"It's hard to compete against a free government site unless you have very deep pockets.\"\n\nNevertheless, publishers believe that without a major push the NHS is unlikely to crush long-established publications, not least because it is competing with titles that target specific professions, rather than a network of employers.\n\nSpecific targeting\n\n\"Advertisers will pay for the brands jobseekers know well and trust,\" says Michael Spray, commercial manager of Public Finance. \"You have to get into the mindset of those jobseekers - if you have a finance job in the NHS, would you go to a broad-ranging NHS website for your next job?\"\n\nBecause they are listed for free, no government-approved model has yet managed to enable individual job ads to stand out.\n\nBy contrast, the TES offers an u pgraded package that can include Ofsted reports and teacher testimonials. The Guardian's jobs website has just hosted its first podcast job ad for Government Communications Headquarters.\n\nPrint proponents say they have their own trick up their sleeve that no site can replicate. Tim Bowdler, chief executive of Johnston Press, concludes: \"Print reaches people who are not necessarily looking for a job, but who stumble across an ad.\"\n\nWHO BENEFITS?\n\nWho are the main beneficiaries of public sector advertising?\n\n- The Guardian\n\nEducation Guardian (Tuesday), Society Guardian (Wednesday), Jobs (Saturday) and online at guardian.co.uk/jobs. It claims that 500,000 public service professionals read the paper each day and 1.5m visit its websites each month. Total recruitment ads are up 75% a year online\n\n- Times Educational Supplement\n\nThe recently relaunched newspaper magazine offers all print advertisers free ads on its website, tes.co.uk. It also has a premium package for online advertisers, which can include staff testimonials and Ofsted reports\n\n- Emap\n\nTitles include Nursing Times, Health Service Journal and Local Government Chronicle. All websites carry job ads and Nursing Times recently launched Talent Scout, which offers targeted ads next to editorial, and NT Online Plus, a package of online and offline advertising\n\n- Haymarket Publishing\n\nOffers all print advertisers in titles such as Third Sector, Planning, Regeneration & Renewal and Children Now, free ads online, and also takes web-only ads. Recently launched a stand-alone site, thirdsectorjobs.co.uk\n\n- Reed Business Information\n\nPublishes Community Care and tie-in website communitycare.co.uk, as well as stand-alone website 0-19.co.uk, aimed at anyone who works with children and young people."
