        "text": "Author Guidelines\n\nSUBMISSION OF MANUSCRIPT\n\nBy submitting my article to this journal, I agree to the Author Copyright Agreement, the IOS Press Ethics Policy, and the IOS Press Privacy Policy.\n\nAuthors are requested to submit their manuscript electronically to the journal’s editorial management system. Authors may include a positive and negative list of possible reviewers in the cover letter of their submission.\n\nPublication fee\n\nFor articles submitted and accepted after 1 January 2023, authors are required to pay a publication fee of €500/$500. A waiver request for the publication fee should be submitted before the initial submission of a paper.\n\nArtificial intelligence policy\n\nText generated from artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, or similar algorithmic tools cannot be the original content in papers submitted to the journal. Nor does the journal accept figures, images, or graphics produced by such tools. However, AI tools can be used in the writing process to improve the readability and language. A disclosure should be added to the paper in case AI tools were used.\n\nAI programs should not be included in the author list, nor should they be cited. The authors are ultimately responsible for the contents of the paper. For more information, see the IOS Press Ethics Policy.\n\nChanges to authorship\n\nIOS Press has adopted Sage’s Authorship Policy. Please go to: Authorship guidelines | SAGE Publications Ltd for details.\n\nRequired files for final submissions\n\nAfter the article has been accepted, the authors should submit the final version as source files, including a word processor file of the text, such as MS Word or LateX (If using LaTeX, please use the standard article.sty as a style file and also send a PDF version of the LaTeX file).\n\nOpen access option\n\nThe IOS Press Open Library offers authors an open access (OA) option. By selecting the OA option, the article will be freely available from the moment it is published, also in the pre-press module. In the Open Library the article processing charges are paid in the form of an OA fee. Authors will receive an order form upon acceptance of their article. OA is entirely optional.\n\nPREPARATION OF MANUSCRIPTS\n\nOrganization of the paper and style of presentation\n\nManuscripts must be written in English. Authors whose native language is not English are advised to consult a professional English language editing service or a native English speaker prior to submission.\n\nManuscripts should be prepared with wide margins and double spacing throughout, including the abstract, footnotes and references. Every page of the manuscript, including the title page, references, tables, etc., should be numbered. However, in the text no reference should be made to page numbers; if necessary, one may refer to sections. Try to avoid the excessive use of italics and bold face.\n\nManuscripts should be organized in the following order:\n\nTitle page\n\nBody of text (divided by subheadings)\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nReferences\n\nTables\n\nFigure captions\n\nFigures\n\nHeadings and subheadings should be numbered and typed on a separate line, without indentation. SI units should be used, i.e., the units based on the metre, kilogramme, second, etc.\n\nTitle page\n\nThe title page should provide the following information:\n\nTitle (should be clear, descriptive and not too long)\n\nName(s) of author(s); please indicate who is the corresponding author\n\nFull affiliation(s)\n\nPresent address of author(s), if different from affiliation\n\nComplete address of corresponding author, including e-mail address\n\nAbstract\n\nKeywords (Please provide 4-7 keywords. Keywords should be terms from the MeSH database)\n\nAbstract\n\nThe abstract should be clear, descriptive, self-explanatory and not longer than 200 words, it should also be suitable for publication in abstracting services. The abstract for research papers should follow the “structured abstract” format. Section labels should be in bold uppercase letters followed by a colon, and each section will begin on a new line.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nOBJECTIVE:\n\nMETHODS:\n\nRESULTS:\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nEthical considerations\n\nIOS Press has adopted Sage’s Publication ethics policies. Please go to:\n\nPublication ethics and research integrity: policy guidelines for authors | SAGE Publications Ltd for details.\n\nData sharing policy\n\nAll relevant data that were used or produced for conducting the work presented in a paper is encouraged to be made FAIR and compliant with the PLOS data availability guidelines prior to submission. See in particular the list of recommended data repositories. (We might provide our own data availability guidelines in the future, but we borrow the excellent PLOS guidelines for now.) In a nutshell, data have to be made openly accessible and freely reusable via established institutions and standards, unless privacy concerns forbid such a publication. In any case, metadata have to be made publicly accessible and visible.\n\nSupplementary data can be submitted and should be included within the manuscript after the figures and tables (or after the references). Each supplementary item should have a legend and should not exceed the file size of 10 MB. A short description of the supplementary items should be included under the header Supplementary Material within the manuscript before the References. Large datasets should be hosted on the author's own or institute's website or in an appropriate database, and should be properly cited within the manuscript.\n\nReporting guidelines\n\nManuscripts should adhere to the EQUATOR Network reporting guidelines relevant to the research design.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nSpecify the acknowledgements. If there are none, you can still include this section and insert \"The authors have no acknowledgments\".\n\nConflict of interest\n\nStatement of any potential conflicts should be clearly identified at the end of the paper. If there is no conflict of interest to declare, you must still include this section and insert the following statement: \"The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\"\n\nFunding\n\nSpecify sources of funding. If there are none, you can still include this section at the end of the paper and insert \"The authors report no funding\".\n\nFigures\n\nNumber figures as Fig. 1, Fig 2, etc. and refer to all of them in the text.\n\nEach figure should be provided on a separate sheet. Figures should not be included in the text.\n\nColor figures can be included in the print version, provided the cost of their reproduction is paid for by the author. The online version has no extra charges for color figures.\n\nFor the file formats of the figures please take the following into account:\n\n- line art should be have a minimum resolution of 600 dpi, save as EPS or TIFF\n\n- grayscales (including photos) should have a minimum resolution of 300 dpi (no lettering), or 500 dpi (when there is lettering); save as tiff\n\n- do not save figures as JPEG, this format may lose information in the process\n\n- do not use figures taken from the Internet, the resolution will be too low for printing\n\n- do not use color in your figures if they are to be printed in black & white, as this will reduce the print quality (note that in software often the default is color, you should change the settings)\n\n- for figures that should be printed in color, please send a CMYK encoded EPS or TIFF\n\nFigures should be designed with the format of the page of the journal in mind. They should be of such a size as to allow a reduction of 50%\n\nOn maps and other figures where a scale is needed, use bar scales rather than numerical ones, i.e., do not use scales of the type 1:10,000. This avoids problems if the figures need to be reduced.\n\nEach figure should have a self-explanatory caption. The captions to all figures should be typed on a separate sheet of the manuscript.\n\nPhotographs are only acceptable if they have good contrast and intensity.\n\nTables\n\nNumber as Table 1, Table 2 etc, and refer to all of them in the text. Each table should be provided on a separate page of the manuscript. Tables should not be included in the text. Each table should have a brief and self-explanatory title. Column headings should be brief, but sufficiently explanatory. Standard abbreviations of units of measurement should be added between parentheses. Vertical lines should not be used to separate columns. Leave some extra space between the columns instead. Any explanations essential to the understanding of the table should be given in footnotes at the bottom of the table.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAuthors are requested to use the Vancouver citation style. Place citations as numbers in square brackets in the text. All publications cited in the text should be presented in a list of references at the end of the manuscript. List the references in the order in which they appear in the text. Only articles published or accepted for publication should be listed in the reference list. Submitted articles can be listed as (author(s), unpublished data). If an article has a DOI, this should be provided after the page number details. The number is added after the letters 'doi'. Manuscripts will not be considered if they do not conform to the Vancouver citation guidelines.\n\nExamples of the Vancouver style:\n\n[1] Rose ME, Huerbin MB, Melick J, Marion DW, Palmer AM, Schiding JK, et al.

In most cases it is possible to incorporate the information in the text. If used, they should be numbered in the text, indicated by superscript numbers and kept as short as possible.\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n\nCopyright of your article\n\nAuthors submitting a manuscript do so on the understanding that they have read and agreed to the terms of the IOS Press Author Copyright Agreement.\n\nArticle sharing\n\nIOS Press adopted Sage’s Article Sharing Policy from 8th of July 2024.\n\nPlease go to: Sage’s Author Archiving and Re-Use Guidelines | SAGE Publications Ltd for details. If your manuscript was submitted prior to 8th of July 2024, please contact editorial@iospress.nl with details of your enquiry.\n\nPROOFS AND PRE-PRESS\n\nThe corresponding author will receive a PDF proof and is asked to check this proof carefully (the publisher will execute a cursory check only). Corrections other than printer's errors, however, should be avoided. Costs arising from such corrections will be charged to the authors.\n\nThe corrected proof is published online in the journal’s pre-press module and is indexed by PubMed where it appears as [Epub ahead of Print]. This is not the final version. When the article is published in an issue, the final published version replaces the pre-press file. Pre-press articles are fully citable by using their DOI number.\n\nPURCHASES\n\nHow to order reprints, a PDF file, journals, or IOS Press books\n\nThe corresponding author of a contribution to the journal will receive a complimentary PDF Author’s Copy of the article, unless otherwise stated. This PDF copy is watermarked and for personal use only. A free PDF copy will not be provided for conference proceedings and abstract issues. An order form for a PDF file without watermark, reprints or additional journal copies will be provided along with the PDF proof.\n\nAn author is entitled to 25% discount on IOS Press books. See Author's discount (25%) on all IOS Press book publications.\n\nKUDOS\n\nAuthors of published articles (non-prepress, final articles) will be contacted by Kudos. Kudos is a service that helps researchers maximize the impact and visibility of their research. It allows authors to enrich their articles with lay metadata, add links to related materials and promote their articles through the Kudos system to a wider public. Authors will receive no more than three emails: one invitation and a maximum of two reminders to register for the service and link the published article to their profile. Using and registering for Kudos remains entirely optional. For more information, please have a look at our authors section.\n\nHOW TO PROMOTE YOUR WORK\n\nWould you like some pointers on how to help your research achieve a wider reach and greater impact? Please consult our Promotional Toolkit for Authors for tips."
