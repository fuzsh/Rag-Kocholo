        "text": "Last week the US received 16 prisoners back from Russia and Russia got 8 prisoners back from the US, among them Vadim Krasikov, convicted in Germany in 2021 of killing a former Chechen rebel and also rumored to have been involved in the death of Putin’s former mentor Anatoly Sobchak in the year 2000.\n\nOne of the Russians swapped didn’t want to be. “ What happened on August 1, I don’t view as a prisoner swap but as my illegal expulsion from Russia against my will,” “ said Ilya Yashin after the swap, adding “and I say sincerely, more than anything, I want now to go back home.”\n\nSince 1985 exchange, Russia, the U.S. and its allies have exchanged prisoners infrequently. A notable exchange was the swap of GRU colonel and British double agent Sergei Skripal in 2010, who was later attacked and nearly killed in the UK with the Novichok nerve agent."
