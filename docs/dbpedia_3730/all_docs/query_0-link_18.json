        "text": "The new product format was developed by Abacus using the latest web app browser technologies, and it contains every story from the most recent issue of the magazine, plus all the latest content from hsj.co.uk.\n\nThis demonstrates the multichannel publishing capabilities of Webvision as EMAP’s content is created once in the CMS and then picked up by the different channels. The HSJ team have full control over the content selection, page layouts and template styles for the web app, so unlike a native app for iOS or Android which is fixed, the web app templates allow the publisher to experiment with layouts and change the pace of the reader experience at will. The same applies to the access control technology employed for gatekeeping on the desktop, mobile and tablet versions; the publisher has complete control over the access regime for each format to determine the best approach to maximise subscription revenue.\n\nThe web app features responsive pages for portrait and landscape orientation, offline reading mode, social sharing (Twitter and Facebook) and a suitcase for bookmarking content; and like the FT.com model, lives outside of Apple’s iTunes ecosystem so all the revenue goes to the publisher.\n\nSupport for the Android platform will follow shortly."
