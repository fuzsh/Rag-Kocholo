        "text": "This issue of the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice (JPHMP) focuses on communicable diseases of public health importance. The lead scientific article “Late Identification of Perinatal Transmission of HIV in an Infant at High Risk\" is contributed by the AIDS Institute of the New York State Department of Health. This article describes the delayed diagnosis of perinatal HIV transmission in a four-month-old infant prompting a reevaluation of HIV testing and treatment protocols. An accompanying commentary by Pasquale and co-authors from Duke University commends the study authors for identifying the policy-based gaps that led to the delayed diagnosis of HIV in an infant and amending the NYSDOG HIV perinatal guidelines.\n\nOf interest is a commentary “Measles Back to the Future\" by Fricchione, former director of immunizations of Chicago, and colleagues who argue for creating an isolation housing program for individuals with measles. This would provide big city, county, and local public health programs the right tools to respond to highly contagious infectious disease outbreaks. Fricchione points out that measles is three times as contagious as COVID-19 and kills 1 in 1000 children due to brain inflammation. Ready availability of measles family isolation housing is recommended to be available to public health officials. In addition, this article is of particular importance at this time because of the possible surge in measles and other vaccine preventable diseases due to individuals who oppose vaccination.\n\nOther articles on communicable disease in this issue include the epidemiology of Mpox cases in Alameda County, California; Hepatitis B infection cases in persons with active Tuberculosis in California; Hepatitis C cases among injection drug users; HPV (human papilloma virus) testing in federally qualified health centers; campylobacter case investigations in Colorado; and pivoting from influenza control to COVID-19 in Minnesota."
