        "text": "Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust (YAS) has been shortlisted in the ‘Generating Impact in Population Health Through Digital’ category at this year’s HSJ Digital Awards.\n\nThe annual awards recognise digital projects that transform care delivery, enhance efficiency, and improve patient outcomes - 343 entries were received this year.\n\nThe Trust’s Business Intelligence (BI) team’s entry is for its Place-Based Populational Health Management Analytics Tool for Ambulance and Integrated Urgent Care.\n\nPlace-based reporting allows YAS to generate insights to better understand its population and its health needs, alongside the Trust’s own data. YAS provides emergency, urgent and integrated care to a population of over five million people with varying levels of deprivation, demand, age, health and social needs.\n\nThe BI team developed this tool to help understand where these areas are, variations which exist, and develop plans, projects and resource based on this awareness. For example, the tool shows that North Yorkshire has a higher proportion of older people who suffer from falls on a regular basis. Therefore, provisions supporting this presentation and volume should be considered in the planning and resourcing of services.\n\nThe team will present to a judging panel on Thursday 2 May, before the winners are announced at the awards ceremony at Manchester Central on Thursday 6 June 2024."
