        "text": "The European Media Art Platform (EMAP) is the largest international platform for residencies of emerging media artists. It has developed from European Media Artists in Residence Exchange (EMARE) initiated in 1995 by the lead partner, Werkleitz Centre for Media Art. The network now connects 15 cultural institutions and organisations in EU and beyond. These partners give production grants annually to some of the best emerging European media artists, investing at the same time in research, capacity development, and presentation and distribution of media art in Europe and beyond. The main goal of the project is to foster high quality production of artworks by European artists, facilitate project collaborations and develop partnerships between European organisations working with media art.\n\nThe basic purpose of the programme is to enable European artists to collaborate on diverse projects, and consequently to create closer bonds between European new media art organisations.\n\nEMAP expanded offers an opportunity to artists specialising in Digital and Media Art, Bio Art, and Robotic Art, to develop their own projects within a new context and thereby give something back to their host organisation. This process of encouraging artists’ projects and building stronger links between media organisations is enhanced by the rapid development of network technologies and also reflects the moves towards integration taking place throughout Europe.\n\nThe various new technologies now coming to the fore require a relatively high degree of knowledge and, although each individual organisation has its own unique facilities and staff, opportunities for the exchange of information and skills give a further boost to the programme. Sharing insights, facilities and knowledge also foster greater efficiency when dealing with the international media market (issues such as TV broadcasting, co-productions, co-funding, etc.) and the art world (festivals, exhibitions, screenings, etc.).\n\nEMAP is always on the lookout for new partners, so European media centres with an interest in joining the network should please contact us.\n\nAims\n\nTo collaboratively create a European network of Media Labs;\n\nTo host Media Artists from all parts of Europe and facilitate the exchange;\n\nTo benefit from diverse cultural backgrounds;\n\nTo benefit from different kinds of competence and knowledge;\n\nTo benefit from different infrastructures;\n\nTo benefit from different cultural platforms and markets;\n\nTo launch collaborative projects or co-productions between different countries;\n\nTo exchange also cultural programs and staff;\n\nTo do joint applications, i.e. for European Union funding;\n\nTo create a joint jury that evaluates all applications;\n\nTo ultimately respect each individual’s own decision regarding selection of artists.\n\nMembers\n\nAntre Peaux, Bourges, France; Ars Electronica Center, Linz, Austria; Creative Industry Košice, Košice, Slovakia; gnration, Braga, Portugal; iMAL, Brussels, Belgium; IMPAKT, Utrecht, Netherland; Kontejner, Zagreb, Croatia; LaBoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial, Guijón, Spain; M-Cult, Helsinki, Finland; Onassis Stegi, Athens, Greece; NeMe, Limassol, Cyprus; RIXC, Riga, Latvia; WRO Center for Media Art Foundation, Wroclaw, Poland; Zavod Kersnikova (Kapelica Gallery), Ljubljana, Slovenia; and leading member, Werkleitz Centre for Media Art, Halle (Saale), Germany."
