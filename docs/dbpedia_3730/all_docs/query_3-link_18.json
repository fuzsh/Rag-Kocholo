        "text": "Wilmington Healthcare (including HSJ & Interactive Medica SL), a provider of regulatory compliance solutions, has been acquired by investment firm Inspirit Capital from Wilmington plc, a publishing firm and provider of information and training, specialising in compliance, legal and healthcare publications.\n\nWilmington Healthcare is a provider of data, information, events and advisory solutions across the NHS, pharmaceuticals, med-tech and life sciences sectors.\n\nThe group is being rebranded under the recognised Health Service Journal (HSJ) name and will comprise of four divisions: HSJ Market Intelligence, HSJ Advisory, HSJ Events and HSJ.co.uk. Its core strength is helping customers and clients understand and engage with the UK healthcare system.\n\n“We are delighted to be investing in HSJ” said Will Stamp, founding partner at Inspirit Capital. “It is a truly differentiated business given its integrated offering and is well-positioned to capitalise on the ongoing growth in demand for data and information services across the UK healthcare space.”\n\nInspirit Capital is a London-based investment firm that specialises in acquiring businesses that are no longer core to their parent company’s strategic objectives and require a different ownership structure to achieve their full potential.\n\nInspirit was advised on the transaction by Arrowpoint Advisory (M&A), Eversheds Sutherland (Legal), JacksonBreen (IT), CIL Management Consultants (Commercial) and Howden (Insurance and employee benefits). Wilmington plc was advised by KPMG (M&A) and Osborne Clarke (Legal).\n\nIn April, Wilmington plc sold its French healthcare business, APM, for an enterprise value of €26m (US$28m) in cash to Philia Medical Editions SAS, a subsidiary of Europa Group.\n\nThis sale reflected Wilmington’s ongoing management of its portfolio."
