        "text": "Mean Machines Sega\n\n…and the rise and fall of Sega in the 90s\n\nI still remember my first job interview at a magazine. It was a weekly street press covering music, tours and events back when that was still a viable business model.\n\nAnyway, I sat down with the publisher, and after some general back and forth he asked me what the purpose of this particular magazine was. I began my spiel about it being a, “trusted, comprehensive guide to events in the city…” and the guy conducting the interview cut me off with a laugh. He then proceeded to explain the facts of life.\n\nI’m paraphrasing here, but it went something like this: “The purpose of this magazine is to sell advertising. All the articles, music reviews, listings and whatnot are just garnish to facilitate the sale of ads.”\n\nWhich is a long and convoluted way to say that publishing is a business. And while the writers and editors tasked with filling the pages may be dedicated professionals, management are only interested in ad revenue, market share, and how to improve the bottom line.\n\nIn 1992 the management at EMAP publishing came up with a brilliant way to achieve all three… What if they carved up the very successful Mean Machines magazine into two distinct publications - one for Sega fans, one for Nintendo. Two magazines would mean twice the ad space, twice the monthly sales, and twice the revenue.\n\nOh, and the fact EMAP had just secured the rights to publish an official Nintendo publication was the icing on the cake.\n\nWhich is how late in 1992 Mean Machines became two separate entities - Nintendo Magazine System and Mean Machines Sega.\n\nSteve Merrett would go on to edit Mean Machines Sega for several years until its eventual closure in 1997. Which means he has a unique, inside view of Sega’s struggles, EMAP’s operations, and how it all came to a head in the pages of Mean Machines Sega.\n\nAs Steve recalls, “We were all based in Priory Court in Farringdon, London. The building was a shambles, but each of the five floors would play host to one or two mags. When I joined, The One and PC Review were on the ground floor, advertising were on the first, CU Amiga and Ace were on the second, marketing and MegaTech on the Third, and Mean Machines and Nintendo up on the fourth.”\n\n“The fourth floor was the place to be, though,” continues Steve. “We had the likes of Jaz Rignall, Gary Harrod, Rich Leadbetter, Lucy Hickman, Radion Automatic, Andy McVittie, Gus Swann and the fantastic Paul Davies all cramped into a tiny area of desks. There was a narrow gaming room to one side where various broken TVs and consoles in need of repair lined one wall, and a massive Street Fighter 2 arcade machine dominated the other.”\n\n“It was a fantastic time. Every one of the team was brilliant and contributed to the enthusiasm and love that shone through [in the magazines]. There was no fighting between formats as staff were shared across titles, so everyone got to see what everyone was playing and try everything themselves. But, yes, it was filthy. The whole building was a mess. But EMAP was made by the people there. Which the hierarchy never understood.”\n\nWithin six months each issue was selling almost 120,000 copies as Sega rode a wave of success in the UK and other PAL markets. With Sonic 3 on the horizon, the Mega CD starting to appear on shelves, the Game Gear holding its own and the Master System proving surprisingly resilient the future looked bright for both the magazine and Sega. It wouldn't last…\n\nBy the time Steve would take the helm the magazine’s circulation had halved, with monthly sales of approximately 65,000. That may have been a respectable number a few years back, but it was a far cry from the industry leading position that the Mean Machines’ brand had been known for.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nThe drop in circulation can be attributed to a number of factors, including the launch of rival publications, and internal issues at Sega, which were beginning to impact the brand’s appeal.\n\nIt wasn’t helped by EMAP’s decision to launch another Sega specific magazine…\n\nSega Magazine (official)\n\nSega Magazine made its debut in late 1993 with one major advantage over its various competitors - it was officially licensed. That meant it had more access to Sega than any of its rivals. Which translates to more exclusives, more insights, and more content.\n\nWhile that’s potentially good news for readers, it also splinters the audience.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nIt’s fair to say Steve Merrett had his job cut out for him when he took the reins in 1994.\n\nThe Mega Drive was in the twilight of its years, the Mega CD and 32X had under performed, and as the next generation battle swung into focus it became clear that the Sega Saturn was going to face stiff competition from Sony’s Playstation. A fact that Steve was acutely aware of.\n\n“I knew the Saturn was going to struggle,” he explains. “The reason the Mega Drive flew was because Sega US had a lot more control, which led to loads of third-party games and a reason for people to buy it. With the 32x it was barely an upgrade and expensive for what it was, and then Japan took control of Saturn and it launched with a disappointing selection of titles as they wanted to control releases much more closely.”\n\n“We'd got wind of Sony's plans for PlayStation and their charm offensive with publishers and knew of at least three times as many games on the way, so it was obvious that the writing was on the wall for Sega… I spoke to publishers on a daily basis and it was clear their focus was PlayStation as Sega was being so hard to work with.”\n\nThings fall apart\n\nThe decision to split Mean Machines magazine into two separate publications has been criticised in the past. A common gripe is that neither Nintendo Magazine System or Mean Machines Sega managed to capture the spirit of the original. That’s subjective, although it’s a view that Julian ‘Jaz’ Rignall agrees with.\n\nAs he explained to Eurogamer, “Both Mean Machines Sega and Nintendo Magazine System were quality mags, but they essentially lost the irreverent, anarchic edge that the original Mean Machines had. New staff members came in and the office vibe changed somewhat, which was reflected in the way we wrote the magazines. It was like changing a band's members - things just weren't quite the same.\"\n\nFair enough, but from a corporate perspective things were a bit more clear cut. A magazine’s success comes down to two distinct numbers - circulation and ad sales. Both these numbers are closely tied to the success of the platforms being covered by a magazine.\n\nIn other words, if a particular system is going well, there’s a ready-made audience wanting to buy the associated magazines. But as the 90s rolled on, Sega’s market share continued to drop, and the audience continued to shrink. Which had a rolling impact on the specialist magazines dedicated to its platforms.\n\n“It was only because Mean Machines Sega still had Mega Drive, Mega-CD, 32X and a few Saturn games to include that it maintained its decent issue sizes,” recalls Steve, “But Saturn games were becoming an afterthought for most publishers.”"
