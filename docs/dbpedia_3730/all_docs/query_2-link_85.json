        "text": "The new 266m Oder bridge is a replacement for a derelict rail bridge that utilises an innovative engineering solution, developed by structural engineering specialist Schlaich Bergermann Partner (SBP), which is a lightweight and material-saving hanger net using carbon tensile elements. It revives the once famous Berlin-Königsberg-Eydtkuhnen rail line.\n\nDesign concepts for the Küstrin-Kietz Rail Crossing emerged from a two-stage international design competition, which Schüßler-Plan and Knight Architects won. The full project comprises two bridge structures, the other being the 176m Odervorflut bridge which crosses a flood relief canal 500m west of the main crossing and is designed with similar architectural features to the main bridge. Part of the overall project was also the renewal of the track system in a section of 1,250m in length.\n\nSBP developed the structural design of the network arch bridge that followed the competition-winning concept, but instead of the originally proposed flat bar steel hangers, carbon cables with a diameter of 50mm were used. This significantly reduced the weight of the structure and cut the amount of steel and concrete used in the deck.\n\nThe structure is the world’s first and so far, only rail bridge using the high-performance material carbon for significant load-bearing elements. The technical basics for the feasibility of this solution had to be established within the framework of a comprehensive expert procedure, accompanied by specialists, to obtain special approval and highlight the commitment to technical innovation.\n\nIt is the second bridge structure by SBP that uses carbon hangers for the superstructure, the other being a tram bridge in Stuttgart, which was awarded the German Engineering Prize.\n\nThe original Oder bridge was a single-track truss structure built in 1926 with a 130m network arch spanning the river.\n\nWith its crown positioned above the demarcation line of the border, the new steel structure acts as a landmark that highlights the importance of the location and welcomes travellers between the two countries.\n\nThe crossing will help to increase line capacity and shorten travel times by allowing a maximum permissible speed of 120km/h, enabling the revival of rail travel both regionally and internationally. In the long term, this will help reduce road traffic and contribute to the mobility shift towards more sustainable means of transportation.\n\nSBP board member Andreas Keil said: \"We are proud that we were able to convince the client of our alternative technical solution of a network arch with carbon hangers. As such, the Oder Bridge symbolises a striking example of innovative engineering and marks a new chapter in bridge construction.”\n\nSchüßler-Plan Ingenieurgesellschaft - Berlin managing director André Hörmeyer added: “The inauguration of the rail bridges over the Oder River and the Odervorflut marks the completion of a technically outstanding and complex project. Thanks to the impressive teamwork of all those involved and the excellent cross-border cooperation, this challenging project could be realised. We are proud to have accompanied this impressive project throughout its entire duration, from the competition to its successful completion.”\n\nSBP director of research and development Lorenz Haspel said: “It has been a journey from a good idea to a bold decision to a new type of structural system. I am particularly pleased that initial doubts turned into valued cooperation with many parties involved in this project.”\n\nKnight Architects director and project lead for the bridges Bart Halaczek said: \"The Küstrin-Kietz Rail Crossing will play a crucial role in improving the transport links between Poland and Germany.\n\n\"Our concept provided a simple, clear and elegant design solution that distilled the complexity of a large railway development project to a single object with powerful, symbolic meaning and we welcome the tenacity with which the client and engineers retained the original design intent.\n\n\"The use of carbon fibres in the load bearing structure is a world first and demonstrates how great design and innovation can go hand in hand to deliver beautiful structures that connect people and enrich communities.\""
