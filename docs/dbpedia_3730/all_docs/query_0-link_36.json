Whilst the raw data had been published on the internet, each organisation had a different way of presenting the data. ScraperWiki automated the collation of the spending data from the internet and then created sophisticated scrapers to extract, clean and categorise the content. This allowed HSJ to discover some unique insights that they could share with their subscribers."
