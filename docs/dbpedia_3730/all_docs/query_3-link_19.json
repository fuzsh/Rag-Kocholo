        "text": "27 Mar 2022\n\n• Faculty and NHS England won for their life-saving Early Warning System (EWS).\n\n• EWS was developed at the start of the pandemic and used AI to forecast bed capacity across the NHS, ensuring decision makers could accurately plan resourcing.\n\n• The EWS now has over 1000 users across the NHS, who use the forecasts daily to inform patient care.\n\nOn 24 March 2022, the HSJ Partnership Awards awarded Faculty and NHS England Best Healthcare Analytics Project for the NHS.\n\nThe award recognises their innovative and collaborative partnership with the NHS over the past 12 months on the Early Warning System.\n\nFaculty built the COVID-19 Early Warning System in partnership with the NHS, a first-of-its-kind AI tool that forecasts COVID-19 hospital admissions and required bed capacity three weeks in advance.\n\nDaily predictions became available on a national, regional, and hospital level. For the first time, NHS staff could predict and plan for the potential impact of the virus on demand for frontline services.\n\nThe EWS underpinned the NHS’ COVID-19 response and was key to driving increased efficiencies, lower costs, and supporting life-saving decisions in real-time.\n\nMyles Kirby, Director of Healthcare and Life Sciences at Faculty, said:\n\n“We are thrilled to have won Best Healthcare Analytics Project for the NHS. TheEarly Warning System was critical in ensuring NHS decision makers could plan and prepare throughout the pandemic, saving thousands of lives in the process. We are looking forward to using AI to further improve patient outcomes, as it already does daily across the NHS. ”\n\nDave West, Health Service Journal’s Deputy Editor, adds:\n\n“The winners were chosen after considerable deliberation on many success factors, but primarily on the innovativeness and commitment to healthcare. On this occasion, I congratulate the winners for their hard work and workmanship, and I look forward to learning the future of their projects, now with the added accolade from the HSJ family.”\n\nThe awards ceremony was held at Park Plaza, Westminster in Central London, and was attended by leaders and professionals from both the NHS and private sector as well as figures from non-clinical backgrounds. The ceremony was hosted by actor/comedian/writer Tom Allen, and the evening was a celebration of the collaboration and innovation of private organisations and charities with the NHS.\n\nFor more information on the HSJ Partnership Awards visit: https://partnership.hsj.co.uk/\n\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n\nFor more information/media enquiries relating to the HSJ Partnership Awards 2022, please contact Rebecca Bright at rebecca.bright@wilmingtonhealthcare.com\n\nFor more information relating to Faculty, please contact Thomas Boyd at thomas.boyd.@faculty.ai\n\nAbout HSJ Partnership Awards:\n\nThe HSJ Partnership Awards celebrate the most effective partnerships with the NHS and highlight the benefits which working with the private and third sectors can bring to patients and NHS organisations.\n\nAbout HSJ\n\nHealth Services Journal is the only title to cover all aspects of publicly funded healthcare, providing news, analysis, and best practice information from some of the most powerful and respected figures in health.
