        "text": "The European Media Art Platform (EMAP), initiated by werkleitz and co-funded by Creative Europe since 2018, is a consortium of 15 leading European media art organizations specialised in Digital and Media Art, Bio Art and Robotic Art. The consortium includes several renowned festivals dealing with these interdisciplinary art forms. Through an open call, EMAP members offer practitioners two-month residencies built on the legacy of the European Media Artist in Residence Exchange (EMARE) which exists since 1995. EMAP also acts as a marketplace for Partners to select artists and works for their own festivals and exhibitions. In addition to production support for artists, EMAP provides an international platform to promote and disseminate the work of media artists.\n\nThe residency is based on intercultural and interdisciplinary knowledge exchange between the selected artists, host organizations and various experts from science, arts and technology involved to consult, support or train the artists. Each member host provides an artist grant, travel expenses, production budget, paid accommodation during the residency and access to labs and facilities. Events include solo exhibitions and group shows, on- and offline conferences and capacity building workshops to share knowledge.\n\nResidency 2024: masharu\n\nDr. masharu (they/them) is an earth eater, an earth lover, and a founder of the Museum of Edible Earth. They hold a PhD in Mathematics from Eindhoven University of Technology. masharu’s work combines scientific research with personal desires and cultural practices, and addresses relationships between humxns and more-than-humxns. It has been presented across 30 countries, and received several awards, such as Award of Distinction at Prix Ars Electronica (Austria) and YouFab Global Creative Awards (Japan).\n\nCollaborators: Sil Zeigarnik, Evy de Nijs, Emma Polman, Sophia Komarov-Reinisch, Open Wetlab of Waag Futurelab.\n\nAlong with EMAP, Compost as Superfood is developed within the Soil Life programme in the Netherlands, initiated by the Platform DIS and the Bodemzicht Foundation. Compost as Superfood is co-funded by the Creative Industries Fund NL.\n\nResidency 2023: Dorotea Dolinšek\n\nFollowing an international open call which received 641 artist proposals from 35 countries, we are excited to announce the selected artist for 2023: Dorotea Dolinšek Illuminates exciting possibilities for interplanetary existence with her proposal ‘Biosymbiotic Exoskeleton’.\n\nDorotea Dolinšek is Ljubljana based intermedia artist. She holds a bachelor degree in painting that she gained at Academy of fine arts in Venice. Currently, she’s working on her master thesis at Academy in Ljubljana, Video and new media art department. She’s collaborating with Kersnikova Institute (Kapelica Gallery) since 2020. In 2021 she received a student award at the International Festival of Computer Arts in Maribor, Slovenia.\n\nAll selected artists of 2023\n\nResidency 2022: Charlotte Jarvis, Dr. Patricia Saragüeta, Prof. Susana Chuva de Sousa Lopes\n\nExactly 500 submissions from 37 countries were received for the 2022 Open Call. 15 media artists or collectives were selected to complete their fully funded, two-month residencies at an EMAP partner organisation. The residency at Ars Electronica goes to artist Charlotte Jarvis, who is supported by researchers Dr Patricia Saragüeta and Prof Susana Chuva de Sousa Lopes.\n\nCharlotte Jarvis is an artist working at the intersection of art and science whose projects have been shown in eleven international solo exhibitions and over two hundred group exhibitions. Charlotte Jarvis’ work has won the Bioart and Design Award and been published in the Leonardo Journal. She is currently a lecturer at the Royal College of Art in London.\n\ncjarvis.com\n\nDr. Patricia Saragüeta has a degree and doctorate in chemistry. She is a CONICET researcher and professor at the Department of Physiology and Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences, UBA. She is a scientist and artist interested in genomics, cell and molecular biology.\n\nProf. Susana Chuva de Sousa Lopes has a PhD from Utrecht University (Hubrecht Institute). For the past five years, her group at Leiden University Medical Centre has focused on research into the developmental trajectories of human organs and tissues.\n\nLearn more about the project.\n\nAll selected artists of 2022\n\nThe basic purpose of the program is to enable European artists to collaborate on projects and consequently to create closer bonds between European media organisations. EMAP offers an opportunity to work within these bounds, as defined by the individual artists, which enables the latter to develop their own projects within a new context, and thereby give something back, in turn, to their host organization. This process of encouraging artists’ projects and building stronger links between media organizations is enhanced by the rapid development of network technologies and also reflects the moves towards integration taking place throughout Europe. The various new technologies now coming to the fore require a relatively high degree of know-how and, although each individual organization has its own unique set-up, facilities and staff, opportunities for the exchange of information and skills give a further boost to the programme.\n\nFind more information here.\n\nArtists can submit project proposals for the open calls.
