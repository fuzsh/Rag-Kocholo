Manuscripts that do not conform to the submission guidelines may be returned without review.\n\nPlease use the Manuscript Submission Checklist (PDF, 40KB) as a guide for submission. Authors must review all items on this checklist before submitting to the journal.\n\nManuscript submission\n\nAll manuscripts are considered on the understanding that they have not been published previously in print or electronic form and that they are not under consideration by another publication or medium. All manuscripts should respect patient confidentiality; research involving human subjects must include ethical approval.\n\nSubmit manuscripts electronically (.rtf, .doc, or .pdf) via the Manuscript Submission Portal.\n\nSubmit Manuscript\n\nJodi Polaha, PhD\n\nRobyn L. Shepardson, PhD\n\nCo-editors, Families, Systems, & Health\n\nGeneral correspondence and inquiries may be directed to Peer Review Coordinator Sheena Mouton.\n\nAuthors may obtain a user ID and password on the first visit. Instructions and support for the submission process are available on the site.\n\nAll parts of the manuscript must be available in an electronic format; generic rich text format (.rtf), PDF, or Microsoft Word.\n\nManuscript criteria\n\nAll manuscripts should be concise, well organized, and clearly written using active voice to present ideas relevant to the journal's scope: family functioning, systems thinking, and health, broadly defined. Manuscripts should address at least two of these three domains.\n\nWe welcome contributions from authors whose first language is not English and recommend that authors obtain professional assistance in written scholarly language prior to submission to ensure clarity, grammar, syntax, and organization.\n\nManuscript preparation\n\nPrepare manuscripts according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association using the 7th edition. Authors should ensure bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the Publication Manual). APA Style and Grammar Guidelines for the 7th edition are available. Review APA's Journal Manuscript Preparation Guidelines before submitting your article.\n\nDouble-space all copy. Other formatting instructions, as well as instructions on preparing tables, figures, references, metrics, and abstracts, appear in the Manual. Additional guidance on APA Style is available on the APA Style website.\n\nWhen required, structured abstracts should follow the Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion (IMRAD) format.\n\nReporting standards: Adhere to relevant Equator Network reporting guidelines, such as consort for randomized trials, strobe for observational studies, squire for quality improvement studies, or prisma for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Submit a completed reporting guideline checklist as a Document for Reviewers and include a participant flow diagram in the manuscript. Adhere to the APA Journal Article Reporting Standards (jars) for items that are not addressed in the Equator Network guidelines.\n\nConsidering equity, diversity, and inclusion\n\nIn an effort to address the FSH strategic plan around equity, diversity, and inclusion, please ensure your manuscript addresses the following:\n\nUse person-first language (see APA Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Inclusive Language Guidelines (PDF, 600KB)).\n\nUse system-centered language to acknowledge systems that uphold oppression and health inequities while preserving the humanity of affected persons (see Buchanan, Perez, Prinstein, & Thurston, 2021, p. 1102).\n\nIn the abstract and in the manuscript methods section, report the year(s) of data collection to help contextualize the study.\n\nConsistent with APA’s Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies, describe the sample characteristics. The abstract should include at least some sociodemographic characteristics of the sample (recognizing space constraints). The manuscript methods section should include more details. While all of the following are not required, please carefully consider: age, sex, gender identity, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, disability status, and the intersection of these attributes. Describe groups as specifically as possible.\n\nStudies sampling White/Western, education, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) populations should justify their use of such samples and discuss limits to generalizability.\n\nConsider whether the design of the study, framing of the results, and/or other aspects of the study or manuscript may inadvertently reinforce negative stereotypes about historically excluded and oppressed groups or could be misused or misinterpreted to cause harm to these groups.\n\nManuscript categories\n\nManuscripts should be organized using the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion (IMRAD) structure with references using APA Style. All research articles and brief reports must state in the Methods section which institutional review board (IRB) provided ethical review and oversight of the study or exemption from IRB review.\n\nSee Table below for word limit by manuscript category. Word count does not include the content of the title page, abstract, appendices, tables, figures, or reference list following the manuscript. Reference terms in the text are included in word count.\n\nTables or figures should be used to display demographic data and results and to organize the presentation of other information (e.g., themes, concepts, implications) in a way that makes it easily digestible for the reader.\n\nType Specifications Research articles (using qualitative research or mixed methods, or including multiple studies within one manuscript) Up to 5,500 words\n\nUp to 6 tables/figures Studies should focus topics consistent with two of the following domains: systems design, health and health care, and family science. Specific areas of interest include but are not limited to: integrated care (behavioral health in primary or specialty health care), health system process change (including rigorous quality improvement efforts), and health outcomes, and family-centered interventions (especially in medical settings). Research articles (using all other methodologies) Up to 3,500 words\n\nUp to 6 tables/figures Studies should focus topics consistent with two of the following domains: systems design, health and health care, and family science. Specific areas of interest include but are not limited to: integrated care (behavioral health in primary or specialty health care), health system process change (including rigorous quality improvement efforts), and health outcomes, and family-centered interventions (especially in medical settings). Brief reports Up to 1,500 words\n\nUp to 3 tables/figures\n\n250-word structured abstract\n\nUp to 10 references\n\nBrief reports are well designed initial efforts to study topics listed in the research section where the sample size is small or results are promising but may lack generalizability. Review articles (using meta-analysis or systematic review methodologies, but not narrative review) Up to 5,500 words\n\nUp to 6 tables/figures\n\n250-word structured abstract\n\nLike empirical papers, literature reviews should focus on topics consistent with two of the following domains: systems design, health and health care, and family science. Importantly, literature reviews should follow established methodology and serve as a guide for both clinicians and researchers seeking a comprehensive guide to the empirical knowledge in a given area.\" For guidance on review methodology, see Chapter 9 Methods for Literature Reviews. Conceptual articles Up to 3,000 words\n\nUp to 6 tables/figures\n\n250-word structured abstract\n\nConceptual articles are well-constructed explorations of topics consistent with two of the following domains: systems design, health and health care, and family science. These articles rely on the integration of relevant literature combined with the authors' effort to analyze, synthesize and, evaluate clinical, research, and educational topics. On this foundation it is appropriate for authors to propose new clinical, educational and research ideas. Commentaries Up to 1,000 words\n\nUp to 10 references\n\nAbstract not required\n\nCommentaries are focused essays addressing current publications, events and initiatives at the interface of systems design, health and health care, and family science. The editors may invite commentaries on articles of interest. Authors are welcome to submit commentaries and are welcome to explore ideas with the editors. Comments and replies Up to 600 words\n\nUp to 3 authors\n\nUp to 2 tables/figures\n\nUp to 6 references\n\nComments are short reactions to published articles in Families, Systems, & Health, submitted within two months of the original publication.\n\nThe focus should be on major issues brought up by the published article, rather than subtle details and introduce expansive, confirming or contradictory views in an effort to enhance our understanding of the topic. Derogatory, demeaning comments, absent of respectful tone will not be published.\n\nWe will share comments with the author(s) of the original article and they will have the option to reply. Comments may be published whether authors reply or not. Submissions go through the Families, Systems, & Health online manuscript portal and include a title and full author contact information.\n\nThe editor may edit comments for content and length and has final judgment about the suitability of content.\n\nWhen the Journal receives comment on a published article the authors of the original article will be given the opportunity to reply within three weeks.\n\nReplies can have no more than three authors, 600 words, two tables or figures, and six references. The editor may edit replies for content and length. Publication of the reply is up to the discretion of the editor.\n\nDepartments\n\nPolicy and management\n\nArticles submitted to Families, Systems, & Health under the \"Policy and Management\" section may contain up to 1,500 words and should use APA Style for references.\n\nThe policy brief should review the relevant literature, have a clear rationale for the methodology, integrate findings with current thinking and practice, and examine a suggestion and implications for policy change.\n\nRationale for the proposed policy recommendation can be based on existing data in the literature or extend from data that authors analyze. The work must address at least two of the three domains of this journal. Interested authors are referred to this article on writing health policy briefs (PDF, 25KB).\n\nBook and media reviews\n\nHigh-quality media reviews should be 1,000 words or less and should contain the following components: reasons the media item is important, the intended audience, potential broader audiences it could interest or apply to; its strengths and benefits, shortcomings and limitations; how it fits into the larger body of literature and media within the field, and the implications of the resource.\n\nWriting should be balanced, concise and professional. Reviews are helpful when they deliver insight beyond what a viewer could ascertain if glancing over the media resource, its website and description. Beyond previewing it or reading other reviews about it, the reviewer must \"consume\" the entire resource. Authors must attend to their biases and are expected to disclose these at the time of submission (e.g., an author reviewing her close colleague's website or training series). Similarly, reviews that are overly positive or negative are undesirable as they are less useful to the reader (Guetterman, 2016; Lee et al., 2010).\n\nAs with all peer-reviewed publications, submission does not guarantee acceptance for publication.\n\nSharing Our Stories\n\nSharing Our Stories: Narratives, Poetry, and 55 Word Stories curates medical humanities pieces that utilize creative writing-narratives, poetry, haiku, or 55-word stories to capture key experiences of wellness, illness, healing the health care system, and/or standout moments in healthcare.\n\nSubmissions should not exceed 1000 words and may take the form of a personal narrative, a poem utilizing any format including free verse, haiku, or a 55-word story.\n\nPieces will be peer-reviewed based on fit with the journal mission, use of well-crafted language, and the impact of the narrative. Contact our department co-editors Jo Marie Reilly or Hugh Silk if you have questions or if you are interested in becoming a reviewer for this section of the journal.\n\nCover letter/Title page\n\nBoth the cover letter and the title page of the manuscript should include the title, authors' names in order of contribution, and affiliations.\n\nDesignate a corresponding author and include address, e-mail, phone, and fax. A word count should also be included on the title page (excluding title page, abstract, appendices, tables, figures, and reference list following the manuscript).\n\nAn author note on the title page should also indicate:\n\nfull names of authors, in the order of their institutional affiliations, with lead author listed first;\n\naffiliation and location during the study plus current affiliation and location if they have changed since the study;\n\ngrant support and role of funder if any in role of preparation;\n\nany acknowledgment the authors wish to convey regarding collaborators whose contributions did not merit authorship; and\n\nany real or perceived conflict of interest that the author may have, considering the ICMJE criteria for authorship.\n\nPlease see the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (7th edition) for further guidance on the format of an author note.\n\nAbstract and keywords\n\nAll manuscripts must include an abstract containing a maximum of 250 words typed on a separate page. After the abstract, please supply up to five keywords or brief phrases.\n\nAuthor contribution statement using CRediT\n\nThe APA Publication Manual (7th ed.) stipulates that “authorship encompasses…not only persons who do the writing but also those who have made substantial scientific contributions to a study.” In the spirit of transparency and openness, the journal has adopted the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) to describe each author's individual contributions to the work. CRediT offers authors the opportunity to share an accurate and detailed description of their diverse contributions to a manuscript.\n\nSubmitting authors will be asked to identify the contributions of all authors at initial submission according to this taxonomy. If the manuscript is accepted for publication, the CRediT designations will be published as an author contributions statement in the author note of the final article. All authors should have reviewed and agreed to their individual contribution(s) before submission.\n\nCRediT includes 14 contributor roles, as described below:\n\nConceptualization: Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims.\n\nData curation: Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later reuse.\n\nFormal analysis: Application of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyze or synthesize study data.\n\nFunding acquisition: Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication.\n\nInvestigation: Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection.\n\nMethodology: Development or design of methodology; creation of models.\n\nProject administration: Management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution.\n\nResources: Provision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools.\n\nSoftware: Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components.\n\nSupervision: Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team.\n\nValidation: Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs.\n\nVisualization: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation.\n\nWriting—original draft: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation).\n\nWriting—review and editing: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by those from the original research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision—including pre- or post-publication stages.\n\nAuthors can claim credit for more than one contributor role, and the same role can be attributed to more than one author.\n\nReferences\n\nList references in alphabetical order. Each listed reference should be cited in text, and each text citation should be listed in the References section.\n\nExamples of basic reference formats:\n\nJournal article\n\nMcCauley, S.

American Psychological Association. https://doi.org/10.1037/0000119-012\n\nFigures\n\nPreferred formats for graphics files are TIFF and JPG, and preferred format for vector-based files is EPS. Graphics downloaded or saved from web pages are not acceptable for publication. Multipanel figures (i.e., figures with parts labeled a, b, c, d, etc.) should be assembled into one file. When possible, please place symbol legends below the figure instead of to the side.\n\nResolution\n\nAll color line art and halftones: 300 DPI\n\nBlack and white line tone and gray halftone images: 600 DPI\n\nLine weights\n\nAdobe Photoshop images\n\nColor (RGB, CMYK) images: 2 pixels\n\nGrayscale images: 4 pixels\n\nAdobe Illustrator Images\n\nStroke weight: 0.5 points\n\nAPA offers authors the option to publish their figures online in color without the costs associated with print publication of color figures.\n\nThe same caption will appear on both the online (color) and print (black and white) versions. To ensure that the figure can be understood in both formats, authors should add alternative wording (e.g., “the red (dark gray) bars represent”) as needed.\n\nFor authors who prefer their figures to be published in color both in print and online, original color figures can be printed in color at the editor's and publisher's discretion provided the author agrees to pay:\n\n$900 for one figure\n\nAn additional $600 for the second figure\n\nAn additional $450 for each subsequent figure\n\nDisplay equations\n\nWe strongly encourage you to use MathType (third-party software) or Equation Editor 3.0 (built into pre-2007 versions of Word) to construct your equations, rather than the equation support that is built into Word 2007 and Word 2010. Equations composed with the built-in Word 2007/Word 2010 equation support are converted to low-resolution graphics when they enter the production process and must be rekeyed by the typesetter, which may introduce errors.\n\nTo construct your equations with MathType or Equation Editor 3.0:\n\nGo to the Text section of the Insert tab and select Object.\n\nSelect MathType or Equation Editor 3.0 in the drop-down menu.\n\nIf you have an equation that has already been produced using Microsoft Word 2007 or 2010 and you have access to the full version of MathType 6.5 or later, you can convert this equation to MathType by clicking on MathType Insert Equation. Copy the equation from Microsoft Word and paste it into the MathType box. Verify that your equation is correct, click File, and then click Update. Your equation has now been inserted into your Word file as a MathType Equation.\n\nUse Equation Editor 3.0 or MathType only for equations or for formulas that cannot be produced as Word text using the Times or Symbol font.\n\nComputer code\n\nBecause altering computer code in any way (e.g., indents, line spacing, line breaks, page breaks) during the typesetting process could alter its meaning, we treat computer code differently from the rest of your article in our production process. To that end, we request separate files for computer code.\n\nIn online supplemental material\n\nWe request that runnable source code be included as supplemental material to the article. For more information, visit Supplementing Your Article With Online Material.\n\nIn the text of the article\n\nIf you would like to include code in the text of your published manuscript, please submit a separate file with your code exactly as you want it to appear, using Courier New font with a type size of 8 points. We will make an image of each segment of code in your article that exceeds 40 characters in length. (Shorter snippets of code that appear in text will be typeset in Courier New and run in with the rest of the text.) If an appendix contains a mix of code and explanatory text, please submit a file that contains the entire appendix, with the code keyed in 8-point Courier New.\n\nTables\n\nUse Word's Insert Table function when you create tables. Using spaces or tabs in your table will create problems when the table is typeset and may result in errors.\n\nIf your manuscript was mask reviewed, please ensure that the final version for production includes a byline and full author note for typesetting.\n\nReferences in text\n\nCite authors and dates of works used. First citation may include up to five authors; in subsequent citations of 3+ authors, state surname of first author, then et al. and the publication date, e.g., Jones et al. (1994). Multiple citations must be listed in alphabetical order.\n\nEditorial and peer-review process\n\nOne of the two editors reviews submitted manuscripts to assess quality and determine fit for the Journal. Articles sent out for peer review show potential to make a new and useful contribution to the literature.\n\nFamilies, Systems, & Health has recently moved to a doublemasked review process; neither authors' nor peer reviewers' identities are known to each other.\n\nAll accepted manuscripts are edited according to the Journal's style and returned to the author as page proofs for approval. Authors take responsibility for all statements made in their work.\n\nThe manuscript file should be anonymous and should not include:\n\nreferences to the author's previous work in the first person (I, my, we, our)\n\nauthor's name in the file path or document footer\n\nauthor institution details\n\nauthor contact details\n\nauthor notes\n\nacknowledgements\n\ncompeting interests (if declared)\n\nethics approval statements that refer to your institution\n\nAll relevant author information (the title of the manuscript along with all authors' names and institutional affiliations) should be provided on the separate title page file (not sent out to reviewers).\n\nPlease ensure that tracked changes are switched off if previously used. The file will automatically be converted to PDF once uploaded through the submission system and will be available to the reviewers.\n\nResponsibility for masking the manuscript rests with the authors; manuscripts will be returned to the author if not appropriately masked. If the manuscript is accepted, authors will be asked to make changes in wording so that the paper is no longer masked.\n\nIf you have any questions about our doublemask review please do not hesitate to contact the editorial office.\n\nPlease do not remove, redact or in any way anonymize references in the manuscript, including to citations your own previous work. We realize that an astute reviewer will be able to figure out who you are if you refer to your previous work, but reviewers often need to see citations supporting statements in your manuscript, especially ones that relate to the methods or help interpret your findings.\n\nPublic significance statement\n\nAuthors submitting manuscripts to Families, Systems, & Health are required to provide a short statement of one to two sentences to summarize the article's findings and significance to the educated public. This description should be included within the manuscript on the abstract/keywords page.\n\nView Guidance for Translational Abstracts and Public Significance Statements\n\nEditing and final proofs\n\nAfter an article has been accepted for publication, it is edited for conformity of style to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (7th ed.), clarity of presentation, coherence, punctuation, standard usage of terms, spelling, and so on.\n\nThe first author will receive the copyedited manuscript for review and must return it within two business days of receipt.\n\nReprint orders\n\nAuthors may order reprints of their articles from the printer when they receive their copyedited manuscript for review.\n\nAcademic writing and English language editing services\n\nAuthors who feel that their manuscript may benefit from additional academic writing or language editing support prior to submission are encouraged to seek out such services at their host institutions, engage with colleagues and subject matter experts, and/or consider several vendors that offer discounts to APA authors.\n\nPlease note that APA does not endorse or take responsibility for the service providers listed. It is strictly a referral service.\n\nUse of such service is not mandatory for publication in an APA journal. Use of one or more of these services does not guarantee selection for peer review, manuscript acceptance, or preference for publication in any APA journal.\n\nSubmitting supplemental materials\n\nAPA can place supplemental materials online, available via the published article in the APA PsycArticles® database. Please see Supplementing Your Article With Online Material for more details.\n\nPermissions\n\nAuthors of accepted papers must obtain and provide to the editor on final acceptance all necessary permissions to reproduce in print and electronic form any copyrighted work, including test materials (or portions thereof), photographs, and other graphic images (including those used as stimuli in experiments).\n\nOn advice of counsel, APA may decline to publish any image whose copyright status is unknown.\n\nDownload Permissions Alert Form (PDF, 13KB)\n\nPublication policies\n\nFor full details on publication policies, including use of Artificial Intelligence tools, please see APA Publishing Policies.\n\nAPA policy prohibits an author from submitting the same manuscript for concurrent consideration by two or more publications.\n\nSee also APA Journals® Internet Posting Guidelines.\n\nAPA requires authors to reveal any possible conflict of interest in the conduct and reporting of research (e.g., financial interests in a test or procedure, funding by pharmaceutical companies for drug research).\n\nDownload Full Disclosure of Interests Form (PDF, 41KB)\n\nEthical Principles\n\nIt is a violation of APA Ethical Principles to publish \"as original data, data that have been previously published\" (Standard 8.13).\n\nIn addition, APA Ethical Principles specify that \"after research results are published, psychologists do not withhold the data on which their conclusions are based from other competent professionals who seek to verify the substantive claims through reanalysis and who intend to use such data only for that purpose, provided that the confidentiality of the participants can be protected and unless legal rights concerning proprietary data preclude their release\" (Standard 8.14).\n\nAPA expects authors to adhere to these standards. Specifically, APA expects authors to have their data available throughout the editorial review process and for at least 5 years after the date of publication.\n\nAuthors are required to state in writing that they have complied with APA ethical standards in the treatment of their sample, human or animal, or to describe the details of treatment.\n\nDownload Certification of Compliance With APA Ethical Principles Form (PDF, 26KB)\n\nThe APA Ethics Office provides the full Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct electronically on its website in HTML, PDF, and Word format. You may also request a copy by emailing or calling the APA Ethics Office (202-336-5930). You may also read \"Ethical Principles,\" December 1992, American Psychologist, Vol. 47, pp. 1597–1611.\n\nOther information\n\nSee APA’s Publishing Policies page for more information on publication policies, including information on author contributorship and responsibilities of authors, author name changes after publication, the use of generative artificial intelligence, funder information and conflict-of-interest disclosures, duplicate publication, data publication and reuse, and preprints."
