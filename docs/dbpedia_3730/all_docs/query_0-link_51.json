The Institute of Health Visiting has grown very rapidly and our activities are beginning to make a real impact on the quality of services that the profession can deliver to children and families.\n\n“We really value the partnership work we are engaged in with many other organisations which has been critical to our success, as has the enormous enthusiasm of the profession and their employers who have wholeheartedly supported and embraced our developments. I would like to thank those who nominated me, the judges and the very many individuals who are helping the iHV to deliver its vision.
