The Order constitutes an offer by us to purchase the Goods and the Services. An Order and the Terms will be accepted when you indicate your acceptance, either expressly by giving notice of acceptance or impliedly by fulfilling the Order in whole or in part. The Terms will form part of the Contract between you and us save that if any other terms and conditions have been agreed in writing and validly executed between the parties (the \"Alternative Terms\") then such Alternative Terms will supersede and replace these Terms.
