        "text": "They intend to jointly study the implementation of a UK plant that will employ biological processes and technologies to produce recycled PET from PET plastic and textiles.\n\nFCC said UK recycling “has plateaued in recent years” and that achieving a circular economy required this kind of innovation and investment.\n\n“Exploring biorecycling is one way of doing this,\" it explained. “FCC is keen to understand this technology better by seeking an evidence-based view on the advantages of using enzymes for the treatment of PET such as lower energy consumption and better circularity of the polymers back into the PET production lines.\n\n“The innovative depolymerisation process developed by Carbios also facilitates the recycling of all kinds of PET waste, including problematic fractions such as polyester textiles, into high-quality recycled PET.”\n\nCarbios’s enzymatic depolymerisation technology enables efficient and solvent-free recycling of PET plastic and textile waste into virgin-like products, the company said.\n\nSteve Longdon, chief executive of FCC Environment UK, said the company was keen to develop an evidence base from which to examine the contribution that Carbios' technology could make to the UK waste hierarchy.\n\nLongdon added: “To deliver the challenges set out in the Environment Act, we need to think creatively about how we recover the value in materials that society no longer wants, and textiles, as we know from our work promoting a reuse culture, pose a huge challenge to our sector.”"
