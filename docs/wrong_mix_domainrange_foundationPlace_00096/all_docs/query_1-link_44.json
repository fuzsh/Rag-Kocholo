As a small business, this sucks hard. Fishtail will lend to La Croix when they get an order from Walmart so they can satisfy demand without tying up huge amounts of working capital. Usually banks will lend to folks only when the product makes it to Walmart (and only to large companies, who don't traditionally need $) -- the net effect of Fishtail is that we lend earlier in the chain to smaller businesses (which is a super duper hard problem).\n\nTech stack\n\nOur web stack is Ruby on Rails + turbo/stimulus/tailwind - data stack is python/pytorch + spark. We get a boatload of data tracking every vessel in the water/every plane in the sky (among other datasets like every trade transaction that has happened over the past N years).\n\nFun fact\n\nWe have a sustainability-linked trade finance product where we can tie the interest rate of our loans to the sustainability of the individual shipment (i.e. the greener the shipment, the better your interest rate) -- this is super nifty when you consider that transportation is responsible for ~30% of the world's green house gas emissions and there's really no good way to identify the best option to get from A to B.\n\nWhat we need\n\nWe're looking for support taking our product to the next level on all fronts (engineering, data, sales, operations, marketing/propaganda, etc) but are mostly looking for web people to help us build out our customer-facing product and sales/operations folk.\n\nReach out to hiring@fishtail.ai if you want to help small businesses win while saving the planet with us (we also have a job site here, if that's easier -> https://jobs.lever.co/fishtail)\n\nTapClicks | Intermediate-Senior Software Engineer - LAMP/PHP 8, Node.js/TypeScript and/or Vue.js | Montreal, QC and rest of Québec | ONSITE, SALARY: 80-120k CAD + stock options\n\nAlso looking for DevOps Manager and DevOps Engineer+MySQL DBA, also in the province of Quebec\n\nWe build a marketing cloud platform helping agencies to be more efficient and make better decisions. We have 200+ connectors to third-party platforms (e.g. Facebook Ads and Google Ads) where we store data in our data warehouse and allow advanced data transformation and blending (ETL), and are also investing in a live connector framework to get data on-demand from third-party APIs.\n\nOur stored connectors are written using the LAMP stack (PHP 8) and our live connector framework is written in TypeScript.\n\nWe are hiring for various roles on different parts of our application, and therefore looking for intermediate-senior developers with at least one of the following:\n\n* Node/TypeScript experience to work on our live connector framework\n\n* PHP 8 experience to work on our stored connector framework and back-end app\n\n* Vue.js experience to work on our front-end, including the UI for our ETL functionality\n\nIf you are interested in leading a small team; please also mention that.\n\nWe're looking for people anywhere in the province of Quebec and ideally in the Montreal area. We're open to sponsoring VISAs for great candidates.\n\nOur office is in the Old Port and we'd like to see you there from time to time (once every 1-2 weeks possibly), but these can be mostly WFH positions if that's your preference.\n\nEmail me at plsoucy@tapclicks.com if interested. Thanks!\n\nHello HN! We're looking for founding CTO ( engineering leader and builder) who can help us rapidly build out our vision for reinventing how people learn and grow in their careers with Scale Higher. https://www.scalehigher.com/jobs/technical-cofounder\n\nMany of the most successful people rely on 1:1 coaches to unlock their full potential. We believe everyone deserves that same unfair advantage — especially for those who typically get less mentorship and advocacy at work: women and people of color.\n\nCoaching and professional development is a 15B+ market and continuing to grow quickly. Several factors are driving this:\n\n1. Companies need to help their people perform their best in order to win in this climate, and they need impactful benefits to retain their top performers. 2. People (especially younger professionals) are seeking out the 1:1 guidance they need to succeed — this started in the personal wellness & fitness market, and is a fast growing need in professional development.\n\nScale is different. Instead of thinking about ourselves as a services company enabled by technology, we think about ourselves as a product & technology company enabled by 1:1 services. In recent years, there have been notable success stories based on this approach: Future, BetterHelp, and Noom as examples.\n\nWe’re making a big investment in development and working with great partners like Metalab (the company who helped Slack build its first version).\n\nYou'd be working with two seasoned co-founders: Ravi Mehta, CEO is the former Chief Product Officer of Tinder, EIR at Reforge, and VP of product for TripAdvisor. Victoria Young has held product leadership roles at Netflix, Uber, and Facebook before leading growth for Share Ventures.\n\nWe've raised from notable investors experienced in and committed to the future of professional development (including Hiten Shah, Julie Zhuo, Brian Balfour, Steve Schlafman, Lenny Rachitsky, Adam Medros, Li Jin, James Beshara, Lee Jacobs, Cyan Bannister, and other investors we're excited to have on board.)\n\nIf interested, you can also email ravi@scalehigher.com or victoria@scalehigher.com directly.

We've mapped over 40,000,000 sqm so far! Our mission is to allow building owners and occupants to stay safe and leverage their indoor data with a healthy respect for privacy.\n\nOur company culture is one of flexibility and respect for the individual - our office and Teams statuses are a ghost town after 5PM and we're proud of that! If you're looking for a full-time role, we have generous perks such as monthly flexidays on top of your standard leave, and we're open to people looking for part-time roles as well.\n\nWe're looking for mid-level engineers who are eager to build full-stack experience.

Our tools integrate the activities of scientists, engineers, and industrial robots to enable the rapid optimization of genetic designs and laboratory processes.\n\nAmong the tools we have developed are a CAD/CAM system for genetic engineering: a compiler toolchain whose target architecture is life itself. This stack physically integrates high level genetic modules into microbial hosts. We also derive novel strains through random mutagenesis and directed evolution. Using our custom control platform, we then subject these experimental organisms to high throughput performance screening in our state-of-the-art robot labs.\n\nResponsibilities: Design, develop and maintain web based application written in Python. Collaborate with scientists to transform an understanding of their workflow into designs and implementations of appropriate data models and user interfaces. Effectively communicate with research scientists. Apply best practices of software development throughout your work, while staying abreast of advances in the practice.\n\nQualifications: 8+ years of professional programming experience Strong coding skills in either Python or a similar language. Ideally deep experience in multiple languages. In addition to Python, Amyris has codebases in F#, R and PHP (phasing out, but still have some important legacy code). Experience with full-stack web application development, including coding skills in Javascript, CSS and HTML. Relational database design and coding experience. We use PostgreSQL and SQL Server, though we also treat plasmids and chromosomes as datastores. Experience developing software in a Unix environment. Dev tools are chosen at the developer’s discretion, but most of the software development and all production deployment is on Linux (Ubuntu). Fluent Linux command-line skills. Interest and ability to communicate with scientists Excellent written and verbal communication skills\n\nAt Amyris, we believe that diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) is essential to our core values. We embrace and encourage an equity-minded work culture, knowing that it is the driving force of innovation that positively impacts our employees, consumers, and communities. And for Amyris, a sense of belonging is what drives our mission forward and is the foundation of everything we do, ensuring a healthier, more sustainable future for us all.
