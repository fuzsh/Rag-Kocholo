About the EDM Council • The EDM (Enterprise Data Management) Council is a financial services industry consortium, working to improve data management across the industry • One of their primary focus areas is on content, and in particular, on development of content standards that define and facilitate conversations about  Business entities  Financial instruments  The terms and conditions of financial contracts  Classification to support aggregation and analysis • Membership includes  The largest banks in the US (Bank of America, Citigroup, Bank of New York Mellon, JP Morgan Chase, State Street, Wells Fargo …) and internationally (Bank of Tokyo, Barclays, Canadian Imperial Bank, Credit Suisse, HSBC, UBS, and many others)  The largest insurance companies and brokerage firms  The relevant regulatory agencies (CFTC, OFR, SEC, FINRA, FDIC, Federal Reserve, etc.)  Many of the largest consulting firms and vendors who operate in the financial services industry Copyright © 2013 Thematix Partners LLC\n\n9. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary FIBO Example: Classification of Securities (fragment) 9\n\n10. © 2014 SRI International SRI ProprietarySRI Proprietary Leveraging Ontology with Rules • Ontologies provide a conceptual framework for modeling domain knowledge, but . . . • When it comes to modeling complex policies and regulations, we need more expressiveness in the form of rules • Automated reasoning and inferencing tools can use rules to infer new facts from existing facts and data 10\n\n11. © 2014 SRI International SRI ProprietarySRI Proprietary Why Flora-2 and Not OWL+SWRL for Ontology+Rules? • Flora-2 is a highly expressive knowledge representation language and associated reasoning engine – Developed and maintained primarily by Michael Kifer of SUNY-Stony Brook and Coherent Knowledge Systems – Built on top of XSB-Prolog • Flora-2 advantages over OWL+SWRL include: – N-ary formulas, negation-as-failure, aggregation, higher-order predicates, functions, frame syntax for classes and instances, infix mathematical expressions, prioritized or default rules, and knowledge base update operators 11\n\n12. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary What is Sunflower? 12\n\n13. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary Sunflower Highlights • Synchronized suite of tools for ontology and rule editing, understanding, and validation – Text and graphical editors, search, graph views, query UI • Provides English explanation of analysis results • Provides importers from various formats (SQL, CSV, OWL, RDF, SWRL) and live connectors to databases/triple stores • Provides an API to enable integration with enterprise solutions • Declarative semantic language supports faster development than traditional procedural software – Changes easily made, for example, to perform “What If” Analysis • Provides server for web applications • Supports reasoning about hard and soft constraints and thus can rank solutions 13\n\n14. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary List of loaded projects and ontologies and Knowledge Bases (KBs) Textual view of rules, ontologies and KBs (Flora-2) Sunflower IDE Main Window The IDE is for people with some training in semantic technologies. We also have specialized web browser interfaces for end-users. 14\n\n15. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary FIBO Ontologies Translated from OWL to Flora • FIBO OWL ontologies and SWRL rules are translated (within seconds) into Flora. 15\n\n16. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary Example Queries Questions to answer: • Am I in compliance with RegW? Yes/No • Why? / Why not? CounterpartyBank 1) Is counterparty an affiliate? 2) Is transaction covered? 3) Is amount permitted? Covered transactions with an affiliate cannot exceed 10 percent of a bank's capital stock and surplus, and transactions with all affiliates combined cannot exceed 20 percent of the bank's capital stock and surplus. 16\n\n17. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary Reg-W Covered Transaction Scenarios (extract) 17 Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) described 17 Reg-W scenarios\n\n18. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary Reg-W Rule Development Translate each row into a formal, machine-readable Flora-2 rule 18\n\n19. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary Transaction Trade Data Automatic ingestion of production data into Sunflower: CSV & SQL DB importer 19\n\n20. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary Reg-W Transaction (in Ontology Editor) Transaction instances 20\n\n21. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary Queries 21\n\n22. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary Query Results for “Which transactions are (or are not) reportable and permitted?” 22\n\n23. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary Understanding and Tracing Analysis Results 23\n\n24. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary Comparing Results • Analysis results can be stored and compared to previous analysis results (e.g., data changes, hypothetical scenarios) 1. Save analysis results 2. Change the Moody rating of the CVS_Care asset from Baa1 to BBB+ using the ontology editor 3. Re-execute query and compare the result • New results in boldface, old results italicized and grayed out 24\n\n25. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary Sunflower Benefits For Regulatory Compliance 25 Declarative interpretations of regulations shared across the enterprise Compliance officer can modify declarative rules locally/provisionally to perform “what if” analysis Transparent compliance decision making Automatic ingestion of/ live connection to data from IT SQL/RDF systems, spreadsheets, etc. Rationale behind compliance analysis results in English Can ask “why not?” as well as “why?”\n\n26. © 2014 SRI International SRI Proprietary Headquarters: Silicon Valley SRI International 333 Ravenswood Avenue Menlo Park, CA 94025-3493 650.859.2000 Washington, D.C.
