        "text": "Lots of training and documentation and excellent performance\n\nAs a graph database, I am surprised at their performance and response time. I found that graphed database does not use the join function. In LDBMS, there's usually the time function with some tables. However, in a graph database, they only have nodes, raw data, and it's very powerful. Using GDB, it's very, very competitive with the RDBMS for some functions and business processes. In some cases, there are a lot of times, a lot of days, or a lot of months to get the results using the RDBMS; however, using the GDB, it only needs a few seconds or a few minutes. I tested and trained using Neo4j, and the Neo4j database also has a user interface solution called Bloom which is a very, very powerful solution for the client. The graph database is very different from the relational database. The graph data solution is not popular in Korea. However, it will be very popular and competitive for customers in the future. It's very good. In two to five years, the GDB, graph database, will be really popular. The product is easy to set up. It is stable. The solution can scale."
