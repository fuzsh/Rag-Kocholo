        "text": "Advertisements\n\nHi All,\n\nI saw a thread from 7 years ago talking about the differences. We are thinking of moving to the area for work (never been to NJ). We have two young kids (both elementary). What are the differences in the communities/schools, and sports/activities for the kids. We would like to stay in the 800K range, don't need a large home. Thanks in advance.\n\nFirstly, Princeton Jct is a small section in West Windsor that has the train station and a few neighbourhoods.\n\nThe biggest difference is that Princeton is a town, West Windsor is a suburban township.\n\nPrinceton used to be divided into the town and the township with distinct governing bodies, police, fire etc. The University, McCarter Theatre, Library etc are all in town. A very short while ago the town and the township merged.\n\nWest Windsor is a township and has a station on the NEC (popular with commuters to NYC and Philly).\n\nBoth Princeton and WW have stellar schools (Princeton usually edging WW out).\n\nBoth school districts/communities offer numerous programs/sports etc for kids.\n\nYour price point will give you a good selection of homes in either community, it will likely stretch further in WW.\n\nGood luck with your search!"
