        "text": "Populated place in Mercer County, New Jersey, US\n\nFor the railroad station, see Princeton Junction station.\n\nCensus-designated place in New Jersey, United States\n\nPrinceton Junction is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP)[9] located within West Windsor township, Mercer County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey.[10][11] As of the 2020 census, the CDP's population was 2,475.[3]\n\nFollowing the mid-1860s relocation of the Camden & Amboy rail line from next to the Delaware & Raritan Canal to the present location of the Northeast Corridor, and the subsequent construction of a train station south of the intersection of Washington Road and the new rail line, a community called \"Princeton Junction\" developed. This community originally featured several farmhouses, a hotel, a general store, a feed mill, and several other businesses centered around the intersection of Station Drive and Washington Road, profiting off of access to other cities provided by the rail line.[12]\n\nThe construction of the neighborhood of Berrien City (focused around Scott Avenue, Alexander Road, and Berrien Avenue) starting in the 1910s represented West Windsor's first planned development. Following the reconstruction of the Washington Road railroad bridge in 1939, the business center of the community shifted to the intersection of Washington Road and Cranbury Road, where a lumber yard, service station, liquor store, strip mall, several gas stations, and several more businesses operated for decades.[12]\n\nFollowing World War II, the Princeton Junction population grew with the construction of residential developments such as Sherbrooke Estates, Windsor Chase, and Wellington Estates.[12]\n\nPrinceton Junction is currently the proposed site of a \"transit village\" to be built northwest of the train station.[12]\n\nIn October 2019, the Historical Society of West Windsor published an online museum exploring the history of West Windsor - including that of Princeton Junction.[12]\n\nPrinceton Junction is in eastern Mercer County, in the northern part of West Windsor Township. The northeastern boundary of the community is the Millstone River, across which is Plainsboro Township in Middlesex County. Bear Brook, a tributary of the Millstone, forms the eastern border of Princeton Junction, and the CDP extends north as far as U.S. Route 1. Trenton, the state capital, is 11 miles (18 km) to the southwest, the borough of Princeton is 4 miles (6 km) to the northwest, and New Brunswick is 16 miles (26 km) to the northeast. Part of the Berrien City development is in the southwest corner of the CDP.\n\nPrinceton Junction's name comes from the train station of the same name, now on the Amtrak and New Jersey Transit Northeast Corridor. The station is the junction between this main line and a spur served by the \"Dinky\" train, run by New Jersey Transit, to Princeton itself.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Princeton Junction CDP has a total area of 1.855 square miles (4.804 km2), including 1.823 square miles (4.722 km2) of land and 0.032 square miles (0.083 km2) of water (1.72%).[1]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 19902,362—20002,3820.8%20102,4653.5%20202,4750.4%\n\nThe 2010 United States census counted 2,465 people, 921 households, and 696 families in the CDP.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.44% (134) of the population.[14]\n\nOf the 921 households, 35.0% had children under the age of 18; 68.6% were married couples living together; 5.4% had a female householder with no husband present and 24.4% were non-families. Of all households, 20.8% were made up of individuals and 11.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

For every 100 females ages 18 and older there were 90.2 males.[14]\n\nAs of the 2000 United States Census[6] there were 2,382 people, 842 households, and 681 families living in the CDP. The population density was 491.8 people/km2 (1,274 people/sq mi). There were 858 housing units at an average density of 177.2 units/km2 (459 units/sq mi). The racial makeup of the CDP was 86.99% White, 2.02% African American, 0.13% Native American, 8.86% Asian, 0.76% from other races, and 1.26% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.06% of the population.[13]\n\nThere were 842 households, out of which 41.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 71.0% were married couples living together, 7.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.1% were non-families. 15.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.82 and the average family size was 3.14.[13]\n\nIn the CDP the population was spread out, with 28.3% under the age of 18, 4.0% from 18 to 24, 27.8% from 25 to 44, 28.9% from 45 to 64, and 11.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.2 males.

Males had a median income of $100,000 versus $58,750 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $44,113. None of the families and 1.5% of the population were living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and 5.3% of those over 64.[13]\n\nThe turn of the century saw the closure of Lick-It ice cream, a tiny kiosk-like yellow building that served ice cream to walk-in and drive-through customers, always including a trademark nonpareil in the ice cream. The site is now occupied by PNC Bank opened in 2006.[15]\n\nIn 2009, Princeton Junction saw the closure of an Acme Supermarket, which had been an anchor tenant in the Windsor Plaza Shopping Center for nearly 40 years; the 33,000-square-foot (3,100 m2) store closed in the face of the opening of larger and more modern supermarkets nearby.[16]\n\nSome residents blame the \"deterioration\" of the central Princeton Junction area on a lack of political consensus.[17]\n\nPeople who were born in, residents of, or otherwise closely associated with Princeton Junction include:\n\nKevin Barry (born 1978), baseball player[citation needed]\n\nDouglas Forrester (born 1953), former gubernatorial candidate[citation needed]\n\nEthan Hawke (born 1970), actor[18]\n\nMatt Lalli (born 1986), professional lacrosse player for the Boston Cannons of Major League Lacrosse[19]\n\nBen H.
