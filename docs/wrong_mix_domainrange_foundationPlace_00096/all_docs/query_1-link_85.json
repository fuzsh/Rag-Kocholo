        "text": "Within the EC Project CHILL-ON, supply chain management of perishable food is seen as the process of planning, implementing, and controlling operations to ensure traceability and maintain low temperature as efficiently as possible. The key issues in food production, namely safety coupled with industry&#39;s demand for transparency and quality assurance, are the main objectives of the various tools being developed in the project. The concept of the Chain Information Management System, called “TRACECHILL”, is to tackle the most crucial points and design and implement novel solutions for the cold chain. This includes chilling technologies, real time temperature monitoring, logistic traceability, smart labels as time temperature indicators (TTIs) and molecular diagnostic tools (qPCR) for pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment and Shelf Life Prediction models have been developed and linked with a decision support system for immediate responses to potenti...\n\nMonitoring the cold chain can serve as a tool to evaluate the food supply chain and estimate the quality of food products at different stages of the cold chain based on realistic scenarios. The objective of this work was to conduct two focused field tests in Greece and France for selected chilled meat products. According to the field test design miniature electronic data loggers were incorporated in 580 food products in total at the production line and entered the typical cold chai n from production to consumer domestic refrigerator. The retrieved field test data loggers were used to assess temperature throughout the cold chain stages. The results of the specific study can be used in order to evaluate the real cold chain of chilled meat products in Europe. The retrieved temperature profiles have been used to expand the publically available Cold Chain Database (www.frisbee project.eu/coldchaindb).\n\nAcknowledging the significant impact of temperature deviations on vaccine efficacy, this study examines the prevalence of exposure to non-recommended temperatures, particularly focusing on freeze-sensitive vaccines. This study aims to identify critical points of temperature breaches during transportation from storage to last-mile delivery. In this cross-sectional study, the temperature integrity of vaccines has been examined during transportation across three states in India (Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan), utilizing data loggers to track and record temperatures in real time. By analyzing instances of exposure to temperatures beyond the recommended 2-8°C range, the study aims to identify the critical junctures within the vaccine supply chain susceptible to temperature excursions. The methodology entailed a systematic data logger analysis at each stage of transportation up to the last mile. In this study, descriptive statistics with the\n\nThis paper presents a cold chain monitoring system which focuses on assessment of quality and dynamic pricing information about food in cold chain. Cold chain is composed of many actors and stages; however it can be seen as a single entity since a breakdown in temperature control at any stage can impact the final quality of the product. In a cold chain, the shelf life, quality, and safety of perishable food throughout the supply chain is greatly impacted by environmental factors especially temperature. In this paper, a prototype application is implemented to retrieve timetemperature history, the current quality and the dynamic price setting according to changing quality impacted by temperature fluctuations in real-time.\n\nThis intervention study was conducted in Albania to establish the superiority of the Fridge-tag® (30-day electronic refrigerator temperature logger) against thermometers. Intervention sites used Fridge-tag® and a modified temperature control record sheet, while control sites continued with their routine operation with thermometers. All refrigerators in both groups were equipped with downloadable electronic data loggers to record temperatures for reference. Focus group sessions were conducted with involved staff to discuss temperature monitoring, Fridge-tag® use and its user-friendliness. Significant discrepancies were observed between thermometer readings and the electronic data loggers in control sites, while all alarms from Fridge-tag® were confirmed in the intervention group. Thermometers are not sufficient to monitor temperatures in refrigerators since they miss the great majority of low and high alarms. Fridge-tag® has proven to be an effective tool in providing health workers with the information they need to take the necessary actions when there are refrigerator temperature variations."
