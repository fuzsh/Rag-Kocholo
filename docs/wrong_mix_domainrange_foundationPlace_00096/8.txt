“World class organizations are using MarkLogic in cutting edge technology implementations,” said Tracy Eiler, senior vice president of marketing, MarkLogic. “The 2011 MarkLogic User Conference offers the opportunity to hear first-hand how these companies are using unstructured information to create value and increase agility. In a big data world, our customers have implemented solutions to leverage unpredictable and complex data to give them a competitive edge – something that has been nearly impossible with relational databases.”

Highlights of the agenda include:

Bank of America Merrill Lynch – Rupert Brown, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, will discuss how the frenzy and hype around cloud computing has ignored the fact that most large enterprises cannot begin to migrate their mission critical systems to more agile platforms. The session will examine the challenge of untangling the spaghetti of integration technologies and content flows. It will continue to look at the approach Bank of America and MarkLogic are using to address this problem in the context of ensuring the correct information is being delivered to key systems.

Raytheon – Bruce Bumgarner, Raytheon, will discuss how the Department of Defense and intelligence communities have implemented a key cross-agency information sharing component on MarkLogic. The session will look at the testing and scaling the MarkLogic system meets to ingest and query large loads in a real application.

McGraw-Hill – Richard Fusco, McGraw-Hill, will present a case study on using MarkLogic as the foundation for new content applications and product development. Fusco will discuss how McGraw-Hill used MarkLogic to quickly create prototypes and new products, develop mobile applications and integrate semantic search.
