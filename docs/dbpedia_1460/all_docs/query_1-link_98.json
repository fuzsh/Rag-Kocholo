        "text": "====== SUMMARY ======\n\nThe Senate's final vote on a GOP plan to eliminate the deficit by 2002 was put off until May 25, as Democrats proposed more than 40 amendments on what was to be the last day of debate. The budget resolution, S.Con.Res. 13, assumes no immediate tax cuts and relies on more conservative economic assumptions than the House version, H.Con.Res. 67. Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said those differences will be the center of disagreement when House and Senate conferees meet to write a single, nonbinding plan.\n\nThe Senate resolution would direct congressional committees to cut about $800 billion in projected spending on nondefense discretionary and entitlement programs. The budget assumes the government will save another $155 billion on debt service over those seven years. It also earmarks for tax reductions any fiscal dividends the Congressional Budget Office estimates have been gained by balancing the budget.\n\nThe Senate adopted amendment 1153, offered by Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., that would restore the presidential campaign fund and thus the tax form checkoff the Budget Committee sought to abolish. Though Republicans said the anemic use of the checkoff -- about 15 percent of taxpayers check the form -- proved it lacks popular support, 10 of them joined all 46 Democrats in support of the Kerry amendment.\n\nRepublicans said there was little point in trying to increase potential tax cuts after the Senate's 69-31 vote against the House Contract With America tax bill. After the May 24 vote closed, Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, received unanimous consent to change his original vote for the amendment. That raised the ranks of GOP opponents to 23.\n\nAmong the amendments offered were the following tax-related proposals:\n\nSen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., proposed amendment 1166 that would tax expatriates to restore funding for veterans' programs. It passed by voice after a \"second-degree amendment,\" 1167, by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., shifted the revenue to support repeal of the Social Security earnings limit. McCain's amendment passed, 97 to 3.\n\nSen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., proposed amendment 1131 to close corporate tax loopholes to replace $12 billion in education cuts. It was defeated, 51 to 48.\n\nSen. Russell D. Feingold, D-Wis., proposed amendment 1127 to strike the tax-cut reserve fund and devote it to the deficit. It failed, 55 to 44.\n\nSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., proposed amendment 1134 to establish a 60-vote point of order against a tax bill that would provide less than 90 percent of its benefits to families earning under $100,000. It was defeated, 54 to 46.\n\nSen. Paul S. Sarbanes, D-Md., proposed amendment 1149 to restore federal retirement cuts, offsetting the cuts by closing the loophole concerning wealthy Americans who renounce their citizenship to avoid taxes. The amendment was rejected on a 50-50 vote.\n\nFinance Committee member William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., proposed amendment 1150 to tax expatriates to offset the cost of prohibiting the leasing or sale of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling. Its defeat, 56 to 44, fell along regional lines.\n\nSen. John Glenn, D-Ohio., proposed amendment 1155 to keep a $500-million-per-year IRS compliance initiative outside of discretionary spending caps. It failed, 58 to 42.\n\nBudget Committee Chair Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., proposed amendment 1156, which would prohibit off-budget funding for the IRS and express the sense of the Senate that it should pass the \"Taxpayers Bill of Rights 2\". The amendment passed, 58-42, after Glenn proposed striking repeal of section 25 from H.Con.Res. 218, the resolution passed in the 103rd Congress.\n\nSenate Finance Committee ranking Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York proposed amendment 1161, which would restore funding for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children and JOBS programs by using tax cut amounts. Moynihan's amendment failed, 41- 59, on a budgetary point of order.\n\nThe texts of the day's debate and the amendments appears in the Record.\n\n====== FULL TEXT ======\n\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET\n\nThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will resume consideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution 13.\n\nThe clerk will report the pending business.\n\nThe legislative clerk read as follows:\n\nA concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) setting forth the congressional budget for the United States Government for the fiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002.\n\nThe Senate resumed consideration of the concurrent resolution.\n\nPending:\n\n(1) Harkin-Bumpers amendment No. 1126, to reduce unnecessary military spending, holding military spending to a freeze in overall spending over 7 years protecting readiness and modernization activities and shifting the savings to education and job training, restoring a portion of the reductions proposed for those programs in the resolution.\n\n(2) Feingold-Hollings amendment No. 1127, to strike the budget surplus allowance provision (Section 204) from the resolution to eliminate the use of the fiscal dividend for further tax cuts.\n\n(3) Snowe amendment No. 1128, to increase funding for mandatory spending in function 500 (Education).\n\n(4) Bumpers amendment No. 1130, to strike the proposed change in the budget process rules which would permit the scoring of revenue derived from the sale of federal assets.\n\nAMENDMENT NO. 1128\n\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, I would ask my chairman of the committee if it would be in order for me at this time to yield 10 minutes off the bill in opposition to the Snowe amendment to the Senator from Massachusetts?\n\nMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n\nHow much time remains on the Snowe amendment?\n\nThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Snowe has 67 minutes; the opposition has 35 minutes.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. I would prefer to yield 10 minutes off the opposition to the amendment. Is that what the Senator wanted?\n\nMr. EXON. The Senator from Ohio wants 10 minutes.\n\nI would start out today by saying to all the Senators that we are extremely strapped for time. Five minutes here, ten minutes there, under ordinary circumstances would be in order. I think we have about what -- 4 hours maximum left? How much time is remaining?\n\nThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three hours and 45 minutes.\n\nMr. EXON. Mr. President, 3 hours and 45 minutes, with about 70 amendments. We will have to extremely limit our time. I think that the requests -- may I suggest that we yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts and 8 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. And 8 minutes to the senior Senator from Ohio.\n\nMr. WELLSTONE. I might ask if I could have 4 minutes.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. Let me see how the opposition goes. I have none for myself at this point. Then I will see.\n\nI yield 8 minutes to Senator Kennedy, 8 minutes to the junior Senator from Ohio, and 8 minutes to the senior Senator from Ohio.\n\nThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\nMr. KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield myself 8 minutes.\n\nMr. President, one of the most important aspects of the whole budget resolution is what it does in the areas of higher education, as well as education generally.\n\nI took a few moments of the Senate's time just 3 days ago to outline where I thought we were on the whole issue of education in this country. We take pride in our higher education system. Of the top 149 universities worldwide, 127 of them are here in the United States. Our system works well. We provide superb higher education in this country. If there is a basic problem, it is the cost of higher education. We have tried to address this problem at the Federal level.\n\nOur Federal education policies have been worked out in a bipartisan way over the period of years since the early 1960's when a judgment was made that it was in the national interest to support higher education.\n\nIndividual contributions, private sector contributions, and Federal assistance have created the world's best education system. Together, we support educational opportunities for our Nation's citizens, and at the same time, we support the outstanding research that is going on in places like the NIH, the National Science Foundation, and other research agencies. Our system is working, and it is working well.\n\nThe charts we reviewed a few days ago in this Chamber show that providing higher education to our citizens contributes to this country immeasurably. The clearest example of this was the cold war GI bill which returned $8 for every $1 that was invested in education. Investments in education continue to be an investment in our country.\n\nNow, the Budget Act that is before the Senate today effectively cuts $65 billion from education, $30 billion of it out of higher education, and the remainder out of other education support programs over the period of the next 7 years.\n\nThat is a one-third cut in higher education. The suggestion by members of the Budget Committee that these cuts are not going to touch the Pell grants, that we are going to hold them harmless, is basically hogwash. Even when we hold the Pell grants harmless, we see a 40-percent reduction in what has been a lifeline for young people to go on to higher education.\n\nMr. President, 70 percent of all the young people in my State need some kind of assistance to go to the fine schools and colleges, the 4-year colleges and the 2-year colleges in my State. And 75 percent of that assistance comes from Federal support to higher education.\n\nWhat is amazing to me is that after we have had this dramatic cut, and the Senate has rejected the efforts by Senator Harkin, Senator Hollings, and others, to restore education funding, we now have this amendment that restores a meager 10 percent of the proposed reduction in Federal support to higher education.\n\nThe explanation about how we are going to avoid instructions to the Labor and Human Resources Committee that will be charged with going ahead with these cuts is enormously interesting to me.\n\nWe had a debate here on the floor of the U.S. Senate about how we ought to eliminate home equity -- farm home equity and home equity of young people -- in our calculations of student assistance eligibility. Why? Because the value of the farms have gone up over the period of recent years. That has been true in the heartland of this Nation, just as it has been true in the increased value of homes as a result of inflation that students have nothing to do with. Including home equity in calculations for student aid eliminated the sons and daughters of working families whose principal problem is the value of their farm went up or their home went up.\n\nA second debate we had here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, supported by Republicans as well, was to give young people a few months after they get out of college to find a job.\n\nWe wanted to make sure that they were not going to have to repay their loans for a short period of months -- and we are talking a few months -- after they graduate, when they are trying to find a job. That decision had the support of Republicans and Democrats alike. Now we are finding out that this grace period will be gone as well. Students are going to be penalized again.\n\nI do not know how it is in other parts of the country, but I can tell you the job market in my State is not flourishing for young people who are graduating from college. They are able to get jobs, but it takes them a little while and their salaries to begin are low. Now the Republicans want to penalize them for that.\n\nIf you want to talk about a figleaf over a problem, the Snowe amendment is just that. This is a 10-percent restoration from the budget cut. Some will say, given the fact we have been voted down and voted down and voted down, we ought to grab this, because it is the only thing we are going to get. The fact of the matter is, this amendment proposes to find offsets from travel, bonuses, and other agencies, but these are not binding instructions. The appropriators decide on those instructions. There is nothing to guarantee that education will be off limits.\n\nSo on the one hand, the Snowe amendment may restore some benefit to those who need Stafford loans, but you are taking money away from the sons and daughters of working families who need the help and assistance provided in a title I program or a school-to-work program. There are no guarantees here that you are not going to just put it back in one part of education and sacrifice another part.\n\nSo we should be thankful for any kind of restoration of funds to education. But I must say to the parents who are watching this debate that what they ought to understand is that we are going to see a one-third cut in the area of education, a $65 billion loss over the period of the next 7 years. The effect of this amendment, if it is successful, will be a restoration of $6 billion of those funds.\n\nThe Senator from Connecticut, myself, the Senator from Minnesota, and others will be offering, at an appropriate time, a very modest amendment to restore $28 billion, not the full amount, but just $28 billion, with offsets from corporate welfare and tax provisions.\n\nIt is extraordinary to me that once again we talk about educating children in this country, but the Budget Committee could only find $20 billion out of $4 trillion reductions in tax expenditures to turn to this important venture. We could have gotten the $60 billion. You would have thought they could find the billionaires' tax cuts where you find billionaires turning into Benedict Arnolds, where they make fortunes, hundreds of millions and billions of dollars, and then give up their citizenship and go overseas and avoid any kind of taxes. You would have thought they could find --\n\nThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\nMr. KENNEDY. I yield myself another minute.\n\nThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has no more time.\n\nMr. KENNEDY. I yielded myself 8 minutes and I was given 10, I believe.\n\nThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is incorrect. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\nSenator DeWine.\n\nMr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in very strong opposition to the amendment of my friend, the Senator from Maine. This amendment, frankly, will hurt the very people it purports to help, our young children.\n\nThe Snowe amendment would support programs that are, in fact, meritorious. But it would do so with an offset that would cause serious harm to the future of U.S. competitiveness in a very important high-technology industry. It would do so with an offset that would cause serious harm to U.S. competitiveness in an increasingly tough and competitive world. The offset assumes a reduction of $1.124 billion in aeronautic research and development.\n\nLet me explain the real world consequences this cut would have, and especially what it would do to some very important programs at NASA.\n\nOne of the programs has to do with the advanced subsonic technology. This program addresses future technology needs covering the whole spectrum of subsonic aviation, from commercial jets to small aircraft.\n\nFirst of all, this program has already perfected techniques for detecting and evaluating corrosion and cracks in aircraft. These techniques have now become a part of the industry. If we make this cut, the cut proposed in the Snowe amendment, our future ability to increase air safety will be seriously impaired.\n\nSecond, our ability to decrease the harmful environmental effects of aircraft will also be seriously impaired. To remain globally competitive, U.S. aviation has to stay ahead of international environmental standards. Thanks in part to the advanced subsonic technology program, we are doing that today. It would be wrong to lose our competitive edge in this area.\n\nThird, our ability to improve satellite air traffic control would also be seriously hurt by a cut in this program.\n\nAll of these areas -- aircraft safety, the environment, air traffic control -- are legitimate concerns of the Federal Government and have been an area where the Federal Government has been involved for decades. In these areas, NASA is engaging in high-risk research that individual companies simply cannot and will not undertake.\n\nFurthermore, Federal investment in this technology has important roots in the history of our country, as I will explain in a few moments. NASA's role, really, is to develop high-risk, high-payoff, precompetitive technologies so they can then be passed along to private industry. This is something that only NASA can do. And this investment is essential to the future of the U.S. aircraft industry. The continuing growth of U.S. market share depends on our ability to ensure that aircraft are safe, cost effective, and able to comply with ever more stringent environmental regulations.\n\nThere is a long history of Government involvement in basic, precompetitive research. Back in 1917, the United States established the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics to engage in basic precompetitive research. The NACA was a precursor of NASA and did the same kind of forward-looking work that would be cut under this amendment.\n\nEarlier this month we, of course, celebrated the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. Every single airplane that helped win that war was made possible by NACA's testing facilities. No single corporation had enough money to be able to invest in the kind of wind tunnels that were used to test these planes. NACA's Ames facility did have those resources. No single corporation had the resources to do the basic research on how wings should be shaped. NACA did have the resources.\n\nFor almost eight decades, NACA, and its successor agency, today's NASA, have been making the kind of investment in America's aviation knowledge base that no corporation could possibly match. Every single plane in America today has NASA's technology somewhere in it. The little piece of wing that juts out perpendicular from the wing tip -- known as a winglet -- was designed by NASA. The winglet increases the fuel efficiency of an airplane by 5 percent, and that 5 percent can make a big difference in making U.S. planes competitive.\n\nJust this week the Boeing 777 was unveiled. Major components in that plane were designed some 15 years ago in NASA's laboratories, not with a view toward the product line of any particular corporation, but because, over the long run, the long term, America needs that technology know-how.\n\nAnother research project threatened by this amendment is NASA's high-speed research program. Before investing the roughly $20 billion that might be necessary to develop a high-speed civil transport aircraft, private companies need to know whether such a plane could be built in compliance with environmental and safety standards.\n\nIf we allow the United States to fall behind in the quest for this technological breakthrough, the U.S. share of the long-range global aircraft market could drop below 50 percent. It would be a horrible blow to the trade deficit, to high-technology jobs, and to something in many respects even more important, our national sense that America is leading the world in the future of high technology.\n\nAmerica's ascent to the role of global superpower was made possible in large part by the ability of America's aviation pioneers to invest in the future.\n\nEducation -- so ably advocated by my good friend from Maine -- has to do with preparing our children for the challenges of the future. This program -- the program that would be cut by this amendment -- is building that future. I think cutting this program would be a very shortsighted measure -- and the losers would be our children.\n\nTens of thousands of American children can grow up to work in high-technology aviation jobs -- if we do not foreclose that option by making shortsighted decisions today.\n\nIn aviation, there is a truly global market. Over the next 15 to 20 years, the global demand is expected to be between $800 billion and $1 trillion.\n\nA recent study by DRI/McGraw-Hill estimates that a 1-percent gain in U.S. market share creates 9,000 new jobs -- and $120 million in Federal revenues -- each year.\n\nAviation already contributes over $25 billion a year to the U.S. balance of trade. That's more than any other U.S. manufacturing industry.\n\nAnd aviation already generates almost a million high-quality jobs in this country.\n\nIf we allow this cut to go forward, we will fall behind in our effort to develop technologies that will keep America on top of this global market.\n\nI think we should continue to invest in a high-technology future for this country.\n\nI think NASDA's research on aviation plays a fundamental and irreplaceable role in that process.\n\nThat is why I will be voting \"no\" on the amendment proposed by the Senator from Maine. To vote \"no\" on this amendment is to say \"yes\" to a high-technology future for Amercia's children.\n\nI will conclude by summarizing as follows: We hear a lot of talk on this floor about making sure our children have good jobs, high-paying jobs, high-technology jobs, and they should not be confined, as some people on both sides of the aisle have said, to flipping hamburgers. This type of research gives these good high-paying jobs to our children.\n\nI urge, therefore, a \"no\" vote on the Snowe amendment. I urge a vote for our future.\n\nI see my time is almost expired. I see my friend and colleague from Ohio, who has a tremendous amount of experience in this area, has risen to speak and will be speaking in just a moment. I look forward to listening to his comments.\n\nMr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n\nThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\nMr. GLENN. Mr. President, I regret we have such a short time here this morning to deal with this.\n\nMr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment proposed by Senators Snowe, Abraham, Grassley, Brown, Kassebaum, Cohen, Lott, and Chafee.\n\nI support the goal of the amendment -- to provide increased funds for higher education. My record is clear and unequivocal on education funding. These funds must be increased, but not in the way proposed by the proponents of this amendment.\n\nI do not know that there has been an education bill which I voted against since I have been in the Senate for over 20 years. My record is very clear in that regard.\n\nI want to speak about the offsets that are required here that would provide the money for this particular amendment. I would like to speak about two of the offsets that the amendment identifies and discuss the impact which these cuts would have on our economy and our Federal workers.\n\nFirst, the amendment would zero out two important NASA programs. This Nation has gotten to be what it is because we put more into research, and the inquiry into the unknown, into pushing back the frontiers of science, and then we develop the industry and the business once that has occurred. That has been the hallmark of America. We have been the envy of the world in doing that; the envy of the world.\n\nSo these programs in our R&D are seed-corn type programs that whole industries benefit from. We have seen in the past money spent at NASA in aeronautical research which in particular had led to the development of an aircraft industry in this country that has been leading in exports second only to farming, to agricultural products, in years past.\n\nDan Goldin, the Administrator of NASA, was given aid by the administration, and was tasked to downsize some, and he went ahead and did it. He did it, and he has a program in NASA, a 5-year budget, which was about $122 billion in fiscal 1993. The 1996 request is now $82 billion for the next 5 years. So they have been cut by one-third in just 2 years.\n\nNASA has stepped up to the plate to reduce bureaucracy and improve the way it does business. These programs are the R&D or seed-corn type programs which many of my colleagues have heard me speak about in the past. This amendment would zero out NASA's High-Speed Research Program, and NASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology Program.\n\nBefore I talk about these specific programs, I would like to observe that NASA has already absorbed more than its share of budget cuts. A couple of figures will illustrate what I am talking about. In fiscal year 1993, NASA's 5-year budget request was about $122 billion. The fiscal year 1996 request is now $82 billion for the next 5 years. NASA has been cut by one-third in just over 2 years.\n\nDan Goldin's leadership of the agency is currently going through a painful process of reducing its budget by $5 billion over the next 5 years. Mr. Goldin believes that this can be achieved without eliminating programs. He has a tough row to hoe to achieve this\n\nand he just cannot do it if we impose another cut like this on his\n\nbudget over there.\n\nThese programs are valuable. They are not something that we just pick up and lay down as a whim. Further cuts in NASA's budget will simply result in the elimination of current programs.\n\nAnd Mr. President, I suggest that, if this amendment is approved, the future of NASA's three aeronautic research centers -- Lewis Research Center, Ames Research Center, and Langley Research Center will be in jeopardy.\n\nNow, let me talk about the High-Speed Research Program first. The goal of this program is to help develop the technologies industry needs to design and build an environmentally compatible and economically competitive high-speed civil jet transport for the 21st century. The technology developments are to reach an appropriate stage of maturity to enable an industry decision on aircraft production by 2001.\n\nMr. President, the technologies currently needed to develop such a transport are beyond the state of the art. NASA estimates that industry will need to invest more than $20 billion to bring such a transport to market. A $20 billion industry just with this one development alone; $20 billion we are talking about, and we are talking about cutting back the research that will make that possible.\n\nStudies have identified a substantial market for a future supersonic airliner to meet rapidly growing demand for long-haul travel, particularly across the Pacific.\n\nThose that have been to the Southeast Asian area recently know how that area is really expanding economically. Over the period from 2005 to 2015, this market could support 500 to 1,000 aircraft, creating a multibillion sales opportunity for its producers. Such an aircraft will be essential for capturing the valuable long-haul Pacific rim market.\n\nAs currently envisioned an HSCT aircraft should be designed to carry 300 passengers at Mach 2.4 on transoceanic routes over distances up to 6,000 nautical miles at fares comparable to subsonic transports.\n\nNow let me talk about the Advanced Subsonic Technology Program.\n\nThe goal of NASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology program is to develop, in cooperation with the FAA and the U.S. aeronautics industry, high-payoff technologies to enable a safe, highly productive global air transportation system that includes a new generation of environmentally compatible, economical U.S. subsonic aircraft. Some of the technologies and issues being studied and developed in this program include:\n\nFirst, fly-by-light/power-by-wire: a fully digital aircraft control system which would be substantially lighter, more reliable and efficient than current control systems.\n\nHere is one that ought to get the attention of every single person who is hearing my voice, and every single person in this Chamber: Aging aircraft. My colleague from Ohio mentioned that a moment ago.\n\nSecond, aging aircraft: To develop new ways of inspecting aircraft to determine their airworthiness.\n\nWhen you see a black storm cloud on the horizon the next time you are taking off out of Washington National or Dulles in a 727 aircraft over 20 years old, I think you would be interested in this kind of research NASA wants to do.\n\nNew approaches are being developed to determine the residual strength in airframes using advanced nondestructive technologies. It might be worth thinking about this program the next time you are sitting in a 727 that's 20 years old waiting to take off on a cross-country flight.\n\nThird, noise reduction: This program is developing technologies to reduce aircraft noise by 10 decibels or more by the year 2000.\n\nFourth, terminal area productivity: Technologies, chiefly involving air traffic control, that can improve the efficiency of operations on the ground at busy airports.\n\nFifth, integrated wing design: New concepts, design methodologies, model fabrication and test techniques are being developed to provide industry an integrated capability to achieve increased aircraft performance at lower cost.\n\nSixth, propulsion: Technologies to improve fuel efficiency of future commercial engines by at least 8 percent and reduce nitrogen oxides by 70 percent over current technology.\n\nThese are only some of the technologies being developed under the program which the amendment's propents would completely gut.\n\nIt is a truly shortsighted amendment that would eliminate these important applied technology programs.\n\nMr. President, it is no secret that aerospace business is a government-private sector partnership. Historically our government has funded aeronautics R&D, and industry has taken this basic technology and developed aircraft that have dominated the world market. Over the last decade or so, other governments have gotten into the act. Currently, the U.S. market share is about 65 percent, down from about 91 percent in the 1960's.\n\nWe had 91 percent of the world's commercial aircraft market in the 1960's. We are now being competed with more vigorously than we have ever been in the past.\n\nCutting these two important programs will not help us regain this market share -- quite the opposite. We will be sending a signal that the U.S. aircraft industry will be less competitive. I do not want to see that happen.\n\nIn summary, the advanced subsonic technology: meets future technology needs for next generation aircraft; enables NASA to develo high-risk, high-payoff, precompetitive technology to prove feasibility so that industry may complete development and apply technology to specific products; will result in accomplishments in noise prediction codes for quieter engines, non-destructive evaluation techniques for detecting corrosion, cracks and disbonds; analytical tools to understand aircraft wake vortices for safe landings; and assists in preserving 1 million U.S. high quality jobs and $25 to $30 billion in annual positive balance of trade for U.S. aviation.\n\nHow can we possibly take a chance on knocking something like that down?\n\nThe High-Speed Research Program will: enable NASA to develop early, high-risk technology for future environmentally compatible, economically competitive high-speed civil transport aircraft (technologies needed are beyond state of the art); industry will take NASA technology and invest $20 billion to actually develop aircraft; and if the United States is first to market, the U.S. market share could grow to 80 percent, achieve $200 billion in sales, and create 140,000 new U.S. jobs.\n\nThank you Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Snowe-Abraham amendment.\n\nI think, while I support the goal of getting more money for education, I certainly do not support taking it out of these forward-looking research programs that have served us so well in the past, and will in the future.\n\nIMPACT ON NASA LEWIS\n\nNASA's zero-based review announced last week will have a significant impact on Lewis Research Center outside of Cleveland, OH. Lewis will be given primary responsibility for aeronautics research, especially aeropropulsion research. Other programs would be shifted away from Lewis, including work on expendable launch vehicles.\n\nMr. President, if the proposal by the Senator from Maine is accepted, I think it could be the death knell for Lewis Research Center. I use these words carefully. But when an agency like NASA is downsizing, and the chief mission of a given facility is eliminated -- and this amendment would eliminate high-speed research and advanced subsonic technology research, which will be Lewis' bread and butter -- then I think my words are accurate.\n\nIf Lewis closes, the impact on my State will be significant. According to NASA, Ohio has the second largest number of aeronautics jobs in the country, behind California. This is due primarily to NASA Lewis, Wright Patterson, the Ohio Aerospace Institute, and Ohio's university system. Anchoring these jobs is Lewis. It attracts world class scientists and engineers to world class facilities.\n\nDid the Senator from Maine and her cosponsors consider this impact when they put together their amendment? I do not think so.\n\nMr. President, Lewis employs directly about 4,500 people. About one-third of these are in some way connected to aeronautics research. But the multiplier effect is significant. The people employed at Lewis attract other businesses, or help form new ventures and stimulating the economy. Gutting these two programs would have a serious impact on this dynamic system.\n\nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several relevant documents be printed in the Record.\n\nThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration,\n\nOffice of the Administrator,\n\nWashington, DC, May 8, 1995.\n\nHon. Pete V. Domenici,\n\nChairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\nDear Senator Domenici: I am writing to express NASA's strong objection to the recommendation by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in its February 1995 Report to the House and Senate Committees on the Budget, \"Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options,\" to eliminate NASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology and High Speed Research programs. I request that this recommendation not be included in assumptions supporting the Committee's forthcoming FY 1996 Budget Resolution.\n\nIn making its recommendation, CBO contends that these programs develop technologies which should be developed by the private sector, namely large aircraft companies. The aeronautics program conducted by NASA and its predecessor, the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, has, since 1917, developed a wide range of precompetitive technologies to address safety, environmental, and aviation system capacity issues, as well as aircraft performance. The research and technology results, used by other U.S. Government or commercial entities, directly benefit air travellers and the general public while contributing to U.S. economic strength and national security. NASA's role is to develop high-risk, high-payoff technologies to a point where feasibility is proven and transfer those to FAA, DOD and U.S. industry. It is up to U.S. companies to make the substantial investments to validate the technologies and incorporate them into specific products and systems. Individual companies simply cannot undertake the high-risk research and technology development NASA does; investments are unrecoverable and often beyond the capability of a single company.\n\nEstimates for global aircraft market demand over the next 15 to 20 years range from $800 billion to $1 trillion. However, this market could be much smaller if it is constrained by safety and system capacity and/or an inability to meet more stringent environmental standards. Part of NASA's aeronautics research addresses these issues, i.e., to ensure the largest possible market for which U.S. companies will compete. U.S. companies currently hold about two-thirds of the global market; their primary competitor, Airbus Industries, is aiming to capture a full half of the market in the next 10 years. A recent study by DRI/McGraw-Hill estimates that a 1 percent gain in U.S. market share generates 9,000 jobs (40 percent in aerospace and 60 percent in supporting industries), $360 million in sales, and $120 million in\n\nFederal tax revenue each year. Aviation contributes between $25 and $30 billion annually to the U.S. balance of trade, the largest of any U.S. manufacturing industry.\n\nI believe CBO is inaccurate in stating \"the benefits from the R&D supported by the NASA programs in question fall almost exclusively to aircraft manufacturers, their suppliers, and airlines.\" These enabling advances provide the basic tools for U.S. industrial innovation. While NASA R&D contributes to a stronger U.S. aviation industry, the benefits are broader. Terminating these important technology programs would have repercussions far beyond the short-term profitability of U.S. aircraft manufacturers and airline operators. Joint NASA-FAA efforts to safely increase the capacity of the airspace system, eliminating costly and unproductive delays, would end. Technologies to ensure that the aging aircraft fleet remains safe and cost-effective would not be developed. U.S. efforts to develop rational positions on proposed international environmental regulations governing airline operations would be severely hampered, and new technologies to meet increasingly stringent environmental requirements would not be developed. The Nation's only precompetitive technology development for general aviation, commuter, and civil tiltrotor aircraft would end.\n\nNASA understands the continued budget pressures facing the Nation. In fact, NASA has led the Federal Government by reducing its outyear budget by 30 percent since 1993 and is engaged in a major effort to identify an additional $5 billion in reductions between FY 1997 and FY 2000. We shall continue to seek efficiencies and streamline our processes to ensure that the Nation has the best possible civil aeronautics and space program, conducting cutting-edge research and technology which will lead the United States into the 21st century.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDaniel S. Goldin,\n\nAdministrator.\n\nRESPONSE TO CBO RECOMMENDATION TO ELIMINATE NASA'S SUPPORT FOR\n\nPRODUCERS OF COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS\n\nCBO criticizes NASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) Program's goal of maintaining current U.S. market share in subsonic aircraft.\n\nAviation generates almost one million high quality jobs in the U.S. and contributes between $25 and $30 billion annually to the U.S. balance of trade -- the largest of any U.S. manufacturing industry.\n\nU.S. aircraft and engine manufacturers must compete effectively on both cost and technical capability with government-subsidized foreign competition. Airbus already claims more than one-third of the commercial aircraft market; their goal is 50% by 2005.\n\nThe AST program addresses future technology needs not only in next-generation subsonic aircraft, including small general aviation aircraft and civil tiltrotor as well as large transports, but also for safety and capacity of the evolving airspace system and environmental concerns.\n\nNASA's role is to develop high-risk, high-payoff precompetitive technologies to a point where feasibility is proven and transfer those to FAA, DOD and U.S. industry. Industry picks up the technologies, and with its own resources continues development, performs systems-oriented research and applies them to specific products.\n\nCBO criticizes NASA's role in High Speed Research (HSR).\n\nThe technologies required for an environmentally compatible, economically viable High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) aircraft are beyond today's state-of-the-art. Before industry can decide whether to invest the roughly $20 billion required to develop an HSCT, some level of confidence must be established that it could meet noise and emissions standards and that airlines could operate it profitably. The HSR program was designed to develop precompetitive technologies to eliminate the highest technology risks for a future HSCT, ensuring U.S. leadership.\n\nThe first to market a successful HSCT stands to gain $200 billion in sales and 140,000 new jobs.\n\nCBO criticizes NASA's work in technologies that will allow the continued operation of aging jet aircraft.\n\n25% of planes flying today are more than 20 years old, beginning to exceed their design life. The trend is to fly aircraft 30 years or more; as airlines continue to operate on the edge of profitability they cannot afford new aircraft. It is essential that these aging aircraft remain safe.\n\nCBO contends that \"the benefits from the R&D supported by the NASA programs in question fall almost exclusively to aircraft manufacturers, their suppliers, and airlines.\"\n\nA recent study by DRI/McGraw-Hill estimates that a 1% gain in U.S. market share will generate 9,000 jobs (40% in aerospace and 60% in supporting industries), $360 million in sales and $120 million in Federal tax revenue each year.\n\nNASA's programs address critical issues of safety, airspace system capacity, and environmental aspects of flight which benefit air travellers and the general public.\n\nCBO contends that noise and atmospheric pollutants generated by air travel are unpaid \"costs\" that travellers impose on the public at large and therefore air travellers should pay the full cost, including R&D for aircraft.\n\nAir travel is global, not national, just as the aircraft market is global. Airline operators will buy the best aircraft at the best price. If U.S. manufacturers were to incorporate the price of meeting international, government-established environmental regulations into their products they would quickly go out of business competing against government-subsidized competition.\n\nADVANCED SUBSONIC TECHNOLOGY\n\nNational investment in high-risk, high-payoff technologies will help ensure continued U.S. leadership in aviation, which brings significant economic and national security benefits to the Nation. Aviation generates almost one million high quality jobs in the U.S. and contributes between $25 and $30 billion annually to the U.S. balance of trade -- the largest of any U.S. manufacturing industry.\n\nNASA addresses a broad range of advanced technology needs for both civil and military aviation. The Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) program specifically addresses future technology needs in next-generation subsonic aircraft (from large commercial jets to small general aviation aircraft) and the evolving airspace system. NASA's role is to develop high-risk, high-payoff precompetitive technologies to a point where feasibility is proven and transfer those to FAA, DOD and U.S. industry. Industry picks up the technologies, and with its own resources continues development, performs systems-oriented research and applies them to specific products.\n\nRecent accomplishments in the AST program include:\n\nThe first integrated engine noise prediction code was delivered to industry for use in designing quieter engines to meet future noise standards.\n\nNondestructive evaluation techniques for detecting corrosion, cracks and disbonds in aircraft have been licensed to industry to help keep the aging aircraft fleet safe.\n\nTropospheric climatology data has been collected, to assist in understanding long-term changes in nitrogen oxides in the lower atmosphere caused by aircraft.\n\nAnalytical tools to understand aircraft wake vortices are being developed, which will contribute to revised safe aircraft landing separation standards.\n\nAn experimental database is improving understanding the relative acoustic and aerodynamic benefits of different rotor configurations for future civil tiltrotors.\n\nFY 1995 Budget: $125.8 million.\n\nFY 1996 Budget: $188.4 million.\n\nPossible impact of significant reduction/termination:\n\nEfforts to develop technologies to increase the capacity of the airspace system, increasing safety and expanding the aircraft market, would be severely curtailed. Weather and capacity delays cost airline operators $3.5 billion a year, and cause untold hours of unproductive time for the travelling public.\n\nTechnologies to ensure that the aging aircraft fleet (25% of planes flying today are more than 20 years old) remains safe and cost-effective would not be developed.\n\nU.S. efforts to develop rational positions on proposed international environmental regulations would be hampered by not developing better understanding of aircraft noise and pollution effects and technologies to minimize those effects.\n\nThe only technology development efforts in the U.S. for general aviation, commuter and civil tiltrotor aircraft would be terminated.\n\nThe ability of U.S. aircraft and engine manufacturers to compete effectively on both cost and technical capability with government-subsidized foreign competition would be seriously hampered. Airbus already claims more than one-third of the commercial aircraft market, and their goal is one-half by 2005.\n\nHIGH SPEED RESEARCH\n\nNASA's High Speed Research (HSR) Program is performing the early, high-risk technology development for an environmentally compatible, economically competitive high speed civil transport (HSCT) aircraft. Such a plane would fly at more than twice the speed of sound and carry 300 passengers over 5000 nautical miles at fares close to today's subsonic aircraft (747, DC-10, etc.). Before industry can decide whether to make the roughly $20 billion investment to develop an HSCT, some level of confidence must be established that it could meet international noise and emissions standards, and that airline operators would be able to operate it profitably. The technologies to achieve this are beyond today's state-of-the-art. The HSR program was designed to eliminate the highest risks and ensure U.S. leadership in this important arena.\n\nRecent accomplishments:\n\nCompleted research campaign in the South Pacific to characterize the stratosphere for incorporation in atmospheric simulation models which will be used to determine the potential impact of future HSCT aircraft.\n\nAchieved test goal for low-emission engine combustors (NOX level of 5g/kg fuel burned -- the Concorde emissions index is 20g/kg)\n\nDemonstrated a process to fabricate up to 10 feet per minute of fiber/resin composite material suitable for high temperature use, making the essential use of these materials for an HSCT affordable.\n\nFY 1995 Budget: $221.3 million.\n\nFY 1996 Budget: $245.5 million.\n\nPossible impact of significant reduction/termination:\n\nInterim assessment of atmospheric effects of a supersonic aircraft fleet would not be completed. This assessment is to support work by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on setting an HSCT emissions standard.\n\nEngine noise reduction tests and analysis to determine whether an HSCT could comply with strict international noise standards (Annex 16, Chapter 3 set by ICAO) would be stopped.\n\nThe U.S. share of the global long-range aircraft market could drop to under 50%, if technology development is stopped and Europe is first to market with a successful HSCT. This would result in larger trade deficits and the loss of hundreds of thousands of high-skill, high-wage jobs. If the U.S. is first to market, the U.S. market share could grow to nearly 80%, and crate $200 billion sales and 140,000 new jobs.\n\nFISCAL YEAR 1996 ESTIMATED TOTAL AERONAUTICS\n\nEMPLOYMENT BY STATE_____________________________________________________________________OA rank State Total employment Funding (millions)_____________________________________________________________________ 1 California 4,783 $382.6 2 Ohio 2,564 205.5 3 Virginia 1,466 117.3 4 Washington 519 41.5 5 Maryland 356 28.5 6 Texas 263 21.0 7 Connecticut 193 15.4 8 Wisconsin 171 13.7 9 District of Columbia 165 13.2 10 Georgia 113 9.0 11 Massachusetts 106 8.5 12 New York 84 6.7 13 Pennsylvania 73 5.8 14 Florida 70 5.6 15 Indiana 60 4.8 16 Missouri 56 4.5 17 Colorado 39 3.1 18 Illinois 38 3.0 19 Tennessee 28 2.2 20 North Carolina 26 2.1 Other 226 18.2 _______________________________ Total 11,399 911.9_____________________________________________________________________\n\nMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from New Mexico has 13 minutes, and the Senator from Maine has 17 minutes.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. Might I ask the distinguished Senator from Maine, does she need all 17 minutes? We are trying to expedite things.\n\nMs. SNOWE. Yes.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. I wonder if we might reach this agreement. I understand there is one second-degree amendment contemplated. I assume that we could enter into a unanimous-consent agreement about that.\n\nLet me ask Senator Snowe, could she get by with 10 minutes?\n\nMs. SNOWE. Yes.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. I could use 10 minutes. Then we could move to a second-degree amendment by Senator Dodd for 5 minutes on a side.\n\nMr. EXON. First, the second-degree amendment by Mr. Dodd, as I understand it, is the same second-degree amendment being considered by the Senator from Minnesota, and also the Senator from Massachusetts. Is that correct? We are talking about one second-degree amendment?\n\nMr. DODD. Yes.\n\nMr. EXON. Certainly, we would agree. We will need about 2 minutes for the negotiations that are going on. I think we are pretty close to making an arrangement along the lines that you outlined.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. I am going to get somebody to come to the floor, but I leave this suggestion. I must attend a meeting on the final wrap-up on this bill now, but we would be willing to have 5 minutes on a side on the Dodd amendment, which I have seen, which essentially is a change on the tax side of the equation, and spend the tax money in two ways, part of it on entitlement programs for education and part on discretionary, and we would take 5 minutes on our side on that, 10 minutes each here. Then I would authorize somebody to enter into that agreement in my behalf in my absence.\n\nMr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I wonder if I might get a couple of minutes on the Snowe amendment itself. Is that a possibility? Of the time you have?\n\nMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I cannot hold the Senator to this, but if the Senator will talk about the Snowe amendment and not about education in general, that would be fine. The Senator wants to speak against that amendment?\n\nMr. DODD. I do.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. If I am going to give the Senator time against it, I want him to be against it.\n\nMr. DODD. I intend to be against the Snowe amendment.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. And the Senator will speak against it?\n\nMr. DODD. Absolutely.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. All right, I yield Senator Dodd 2 minutes of my time.\n\nMr. WELLSTONE. I wonder if my colleague from New Mexico, upon condition that I speak against the Snowe amendment, would grant me time?\n\nMr. DOMENICI. I will give the Senator 2 minutes of my time.\n\nHow much did I give the Senator?\n\nMr. DODD. The Senator did not.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. I give the Senator 2 minutes of my time. Each Senator gets 2 minutes in opposition and that will keep 6 for me, and then Senator Snowe has the full 10 minutes to speak to the Senator's amendment.\n\nMr. EXON. Is that in the form of a unanimous-consent request?\n\nMr. DOMENICI. The Senator said he needed some time. Is he willing to do that?\n\nMr. EXON. That is agreeable to those on this side.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. Let us give it a try.\n\nMr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to object, will the result of that proposal ensure that we will have an opportunity to vote on the Dodd amendment in a timely way?\n\nMr. DOMENICI. Sure. We will not amend it. We do not guarantee that somebody will not table it, but we will have a vote on it and we will agree to stack it in the normal way that we are doing the others.\n\nMr. KENNEDY. So it would be treated as a second-degree amendment?\n\nMr. DOMENICI. Exactly.\n\nMr. KENNEDY. In that particular order.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. Correct.\n\nLet us try this, Mr. President. First of all, I am going to yield 2 minutes in opposition to the Snowe amendment to Senator Dodd, 2 minutes to Senator Wellstone, and I reserve the remainder for myself.\n\nThe total amount of time that is going to be used on the Snowe amendment -- and we yield back whatever other time we have -- is 10 minutes by Senator Snowe and a total of 10 minutes in opposition, of which 4 have just been allocated.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. Let me move on then to a unanimous-consent request. There will only be one second-degree amendment. It shall be an amendment offered by Senator Dodd which has been described here and presented to the Senator from New Mexico. There will be 5 minutes on a side, 5 minutes by Senator Dodd, 5 minutes in opposition, either by myself or Senator Snowe. We will then proceed to an amendment by Senator Hatfield immediately after that. And when the time has expired on the second-degree amendment -- there shall be no other second-degree amendments -- we will then stack the second-degree amendment pursuant to the previous understanding, that the leader will arrange the order and there will be a vote on or about the Dodd amendment in the stacked order.\n\nMr. EXON. I certainly do not object. I would just simply wish to expand this in order to move things along. We are prepared to consider time agreements now on both the Hatfield amendment and the amendment following that to be offered by Senator Boxer.\n\nIs the Senator from New Mexico in a position to talk about time agreements on the Hatfield amendment?\n\nMr. DOMENICI. I am going to a meeting right now at which I think the Senator will be in attendance, and I will seek some relief on time.\n\nMr. EXON. I thank the Senator.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor at this time.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\nThe Senator from Connecticut.\n\nMr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this morning to express my objection to the Snowe-Abraham amendment. This amendment proposes to restore some $6.3 billion in education, specifically to reduce the Labor Committee's instruction by this amount in an effort to stave off severe cuts in student loans.\n\nLet me at the outset say I appreciate the fact that there is at least some recognition of the fact we ought to be trying to restore some of these critical funds in education.\n\nEducation has always been an issue that has transcended politics in many ways. There has been a deep commitment historically to it on both sides of the aisle, and yet the Budget Committee proposal that is before us, even with the Snowe-Abraham amendment, offers education too little too late, I would say, Mr. President.\n\nIt is too little in that it offers students an umbrella in the midst of the hurricane they face with this budget proposal, even if this amendment were to be adopted. It will provide some protection but it is the thinnest of fig leaves in that the committee will still have to eliminate $7.5 billion from student loan programs.\n\nI have been through a number of reconciliations on the Labor Committee and make no mistake about it -- there is only one place you can find $7.5 billion, and that is in student loans. There is no other place within our committee's jurisdiction. And so we will be faced with looking ways to cut loans for working-class families, middle-class families many who do not qualify for Pell grants, do not have the personal affluence, and yet long for the better life that higher education can offer their children. And these will be the Americans who bear the brunt of these cuts.\n\nNow, these cuts may take many forms. It could come from the elimination of the in-school interest subsidy which can amount to additional costs of as much as $4,000 for a working family in this country; it could come through increased fees, through the elimination of the 6-month grace period, or an increase in the interest on student loans or any combination of those, again all money out of students' pockets. The bottom line is students and families are going to pay dearly as a result of what is in this budget, even if we adopt the Snowe-Abraham amendment.\n\nThis amendment is also too late, Mr. President, because the amendment only addresses the end of the education pipeline, higher education. Our world class higher education sector is in no way secure if our efforts in college preparation, elementary and secondary schools, Head Start and other areas are going to be severely undercut.\n\nThis amendment is sort of the double whammy for these critical discretionary programs. Not only does it not address the cuts proposed in these programs, it also further cuts into discretionary programs to offset the reduction it makes on the mandatory side.\n\nMr. President, we will offer a second degree amendment as an alternative which offsets $28 billion in cuts in education with very specific plugging of corporate loopholes which we can identify specifically, which Mr. Kasich on the House side identified as areas that should be looked at in the effort to balance our Federal budget.\n\nSo I would urge rejection of this amendment, with all due respect. We will have a substitute that will allow for this body to vote on truly whether or not they want to see these working-class families in this country get a break when it comes to education.\n\nMr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 2 minutes.\n\nMr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, last year in Minnesota over 14,000 students received assistance from the Federal Stafford Loan Program -- 14,000 students.\n\nI just rise to speak in opposition to the Snowe amendment and say that I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Dodd amendment.\n\nMr. President, this is, indeed, too little too late. What we are faced with right now are some really draconian cuts that will do irreparable harm to higher education in America. In the second-degree amendment we are going to introduce, we focus on corporate welfare or tax expenditures.\n\nMr. President, I would far prefer for some of the oil companies, some of the large pharmaceutical or insurance companies or large financial institutions to be tightening their belts and to be a part of the sacrifice than I would go forward with deep cuts in financial assistance for higher education.\n\nI cannot think of a more important middle-class issue as a former college professor than this issue.\n\nI do not have time, but if I had time I could recite story after story after story after story of students who have written letters to me and made phone calls saying for God sake, please do not deny us the opportunity to have an affordable higher education. No matter how you cut it, that is what these cuts are all about. I do not even have a chance in the 2 minutes to talk about earlier education which is, of course, equally important.\n\nThese cuts in higher education are myopic. These cuts are profoundly mistaken for our country. These cuts will have an accrual effect on students all across the across the nation from Ohio to Minnesota, and the Snowe amendment in that respect is really just a little bit more than symbolic -- too little, too late. We can do much, much better in how we sort out our priorities.\n\nI yield the floor.\n\nMr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\nMr. MURKOWSKI. How much time is remaining on our side?\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 10 minutes. The opposition now has 6.\n\nMr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I would yield such time as the Senator from Maine may need on the available time.\n\nMs. SNOWE. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\nMs. SNOWE. I found quite interesting the debate that has been offered here today on my amendment.\n\nFirst of all, just to recap my amendment, it is to restore $6.3 billion in the education account. And, yes, we do provide specific offsets. That should be no surprise if you are attempting to provide a credible alternative.\n\nAnd that is why I am somewhat confused by the debate here this morning, because I heard from the Senator from Ohio that my offsets are binding but then we heard from the Senator from Massachusetts that they are not binding.\n\nWell, I think we all understand the true nature of the budget process in the Congress. No, the instructions in the budget resolution are not binding. But if you are attempting to provide real numbers to demonstrate that they are credible, then it is responsible to recommend some specific offsets.\n\nIt is also true the committees do not have to follow those instructions. I understand that and the cosponsors of this amendment understand that. But we want to make sure that everybody understands that there is a way to reach those numbers. That is what is important.\n\nThe second issue is whether or not you live in a fiscal fantasy land. The difference between the amendment that I am offering here today with the cosponsors of this amendment and those who oppose it is we support a balanced budget. If you support a balanced budget, you have to make some choices. If you do not support a balanced budget, you do not have to make any choices. You can spend in an unlimited fashion.\n\nThe amendment that they will be offering will recommend reducing corporate welfare and tax loopholes. You cannot object to that. But exactly how are we going to reach that goal? They do not specify. No, they do not want to specify, because they do not want to receive any opposition to those specific offsets, just as they do not support a balanced budget because they do not want to make any real choices as to how we get there. So that is the difference.\n\nMy amendment is a credible amendment. It restores specific funding for specific issues with respect to student loan assistance. Yes, I would like to do more. But there are those on my side saying, \"You are doing too much,\" and then I hear from the other side of the aisle who say, \"No, you are not doing enough.\" Well, I think my amendment is somewhere in the middle. Hopefully, we will do more in the final analysis.\n\nThe amendments that have been offered to restore funding for education have used the illusory dividend. Well, that is just gimmickry at this point. That dividend may come down at the end of this process when reconciliation is in place. That does not give adequate instructions to the committee. It is not money that they can use right now and everybody knows it.\n\nSo if we really want to restore funding to education, if we really want to address the home and farm equity issue so that it is not used to determine one's income eligibility for student loans, if we want to keep the origination fee at 3 percent, if we want to have an adequate grace period, then you support the Snowe amendment.\n\nAnd, I should add who the cosponsors are of my amendment: Senator Kassebaum, Senator Lott, Senator Cohen, Senator Abraham, Senator Brown, Senator Grassley, Senator Chafee, and Senator Kempthorne.\n\nIn fact, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Kempthorne from Idaho as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\nMs. SNOWE. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\nMr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\nMr. MURKOWSKI. How much time is remaining on this side?\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 6 minutes remaining.\n\nMr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 6 minutes to my friend from Oklahoma.\n\nMr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n\nMr. President, last night, when we were watching the discussion take place, a comment was made by the Senator from Wyoming that the debate is getting redundant on this budget; that we have heard about every argument there is to hear and now we are working on repetition to try to drive it in.\n\nIt occurred to me that it sounded very much like the debate that we had on the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. At that time, people were standing up and saying, \"Well, give us the details. Give us the details. Where do you want to make cuts? What do you want to do with Medicare and Social Security,\" and all the contentious items that we can so easily demagog?\n\nI can suggest right now we have the details. But I wanted to take a couple of minutes this morning to share one thing with you, and that is we know pretty much how it is going to come out. We know who is going to vote for it and who is going to vote against it. And we know why.\n\nFirst of all, the argument has been used that there are cuts. We have talked about this over and over again. They are not cuts in the Medicare system. We are talking about a growth factor that is built in. And the same thing is true with all the other areas that people are very much concerned with.\n\nWhat we are trying to do is take this one last golden opportunity that we have -- this is it, our chance to fulfill that obligation that the American people gave to us back on November 8 with a mandate. The No. 1 mandate was to balance the budget. This is an opportunity to do it. The House has already done theirs. All we have to do is do it here. I think the votes are here to do it.\n\nBut I have heard people stand up, such as one Senator the other day, and say every Senator wants to balance the budget. I suggest, Mr. President, that is not true. I suggest that they want people to think they want to balance the budget, but what it gets down to is they are basically traditional big spenders and big taxers and they want the status quo. They want to keep Government going as it has been going.\n\nTo demonstrate this, I am going to tell you, Mr. President, who is going to be voting against this. The same people who will be voting against it today are the ones that voted for and are the right-to-know supporters. These are the ones that did not want a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n\nSo during that debate, I characterized who these people are who do not want a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and today do not want a balanced budget. I suggest to you they are the ones that can be identified with a voting behavior of taxing and spending.\n\nAnd I use as my examples the tax bill of 1993, the tax bill that was a Clinton bill that some people are touting as the great deficit reduction bill. In fact, it did not reduce any programs. All it did was increase taxes, the largest tax increase in history -- $267 billion. That is not what the American people wanted. It was an increase in taxes on all segments of society, a Social Security tax increase for thousands of Social Security recipients. It was a 70-percent increase. Yet, these individuals who will vote today against this balanced budget are the ones who voted for that tax increase.\n\nThen along came the Clinton stimulus program. It was characterized by a Democrat in this body as the largest single spending increase in the history of public finance in America or anywhere in the world. Such things as the $2.5 billion for swimming pools, parking lots, ice rink warming huts, alpine ski lifts, and other pork barrel projects; $1 billion for summer jobs, $1.1 billion for AIDS treatment and food distribution, on and on and on, all these spending increases that supposedly were going to stimulate the economy.\n\nSo I characterized those individuals who voted for those two bills and also who are rated as big spenders. There are a number of corporations that rate big spenders. The main one is the National Taxpayers Union. So I looked at those individuals who cosponsored the Right To Know Act which was the one to demolish, to do away with, the balanced budget amendment and stop our effort for a balanced budget.\n\nI found, of all the 41 cosponsors, all 41 voted yes on the biggest spending bill in the history of this body. And all 41 of those individuals had a National Taxpayer Union rating of D or F.\n\nSo, Mr. President, I think that we have had a lot of debate on this. But when it gets right down to it, the bottom line is this: Those individuals who are trying to hold on to the past, those who are trying with white knuckles to hold on to the status quo, those who did not hear the mandate that was so loud and clear on November 8, 1994, are going to be voting for big spending, big government, tax increases, spending increases and vote against the balanced budget that we have up before us today.\n\nI believe it will pass, because those individuals who are for the status quo are now in a minority.\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\nMrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\nMrs. HUTCHISON. How much time is remaining on our side?\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two seconds in opposition; and 6-1/2 minutes for the Senator from Maine.\n\nMrs. HUTCHISON. Six-and-a-half minutes remaining for the Senator from Maine?\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Six-and-a-half minutes remaining.\n\nMs. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Maine.\n\nMs. SNOWE. Mr. President, since I have a few remaining moments on my amendment, I think it is important to restate the case of how essential it is to restore funding to education, and the difference in the amendments that are being offered this morning is a difference between being able to realistically restore funding to education or not, because you will hear from the other side in presenting an amendment that there will not really be any specific offsets. While it is true that my offsets are not binding on the committee, at least we are being responsible in the approach that we are taking.\n\nI think this amendment is critical because it does provide $6.3 billion. It will be protecting some very serious student loan assistance programs, and I want to make sure that the low- and middle-income families are not affected by any changes in the student loan programs.\n\nI also want to ensure that the Labor and Human Resources Committee has the ability to protect the student loan assistance programs in the way that we have recommended in this amendment, so that they will not feel compelled to include home and farm equity in determining one's income eligibility, they will not feel compelled to raise the origination fee from 3 to 5 percent, and they will not feel compelled to eliminate an adequate grace period.\n\nI know there are some who are opposed to the offsets, but the committees are the ones who are ultimately responsible for the way in which we provide the restoration of funds. They have the options to pursue other courses.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, we have to take a responsible course by recommending ways in which we can reach our goals as identified in this amendment.\n\nI think that it is very, very important that we restore some of the funding in the education accounts. It is something that I argued within the Budget Committee during the time in which we were assembling this resolution. I wish it were more, but I also understand the delicate balance in crafting this budget resolution to reach the historic goal of balancing the budget by the year 2002.\n\nI wish that we could identify other areas and perhaps that will ultimately develop in the process. Maybe the dividend down the road, but that dividend is not here today, and I think everybody should understand that. The dividend is not available to be used because it is not there yet. We have to pass a balanced budget plan and reconciliation has to become law for the Congressional Budget Office to score a potential dividend. That will materialize over 7 years, so that is not money that can be used by the Appropriations Committee or considered by the authorization committees as they develop their programmatic changes.\n\nSo it does not make sense and it is gimmickry to suggest that we are going to use an illusory estimate. So if you hear about amendments, as we will hear from others this morning, about restoring funding by using this dividend, it means nothing because it is not available and it is not there yet.\n\nSo if you support restoring $6.3 billion in education and doing it in a responsible way, then I hope you will support the Snowe amendment that is cosponsored by 10 Members of the Senate.\n\nMr. BURNS. Mr. President, the Dodd second-degree amendment is, in effect, an increase in taxes and I am opposed to any increase in tax.\n\nHowever, I am also opposed to the Snowe amendment.\n\nLet me begin by stating that I am a strong supporter of educational funding. I am firmly opposed to the drastic cuts in educational programs and funding which is outlined in the House resolution. I believe that these cuts, while well-intentioned, are shortsighted. Such cuts ignore the long-term benefits of preparing America's children to assume their position in the world market, and for that reason I oppose those cuts.\n\nBy the same token, however, I believe that Senator Snowe's amendment is shortsighted. I believe that we, as guardians of our children's future, are charged with the moral obligation to not only educate our children but also to insure that there will be jobs available for them to assume once they have been educated. To ignore either is irresponsible.\n\nNow let us take a look at what is on the table. The High-Speed Research Program was designed to develop precompetitive technologies for high-speed civil transport aircraft. Once developed, the technology is transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Defense, and U.S. industry. It is estimated that the first organization to market such an aircraft stands to gain $200 billion in sales and 140,000 new jobs. In short, this program accomplishes three goals that are vital to the United States' financial solvency: First, it increases new jobs, which increases the country's tax base; second, it generates sales for U.S. industry, which increases the country's GNP, and, in so doing, increases the country's tax base; and third, it insures the United States' continued leadership in this field, thus forecasting future revenues.\n\nLikewise, the Advanced Subsonic Technology Program generates substantial long-term revenue benefits. This program is designed to protect the United States' market share in subsonic aircraft, an area which generates almost a million high quality jobs in the United States and contributes between $25 and $30 billion annually to the U.S. trade balance -- which, incidentally is the largest of any U.S. manufacturing industry. These programs are moneymakers, and to eliminate them for any reason is fiscally irresponsible.\n\nThis is particularly true under the present circumstances, where the chairman's budget adequately addresses the concerns raised by Senator Snowe. Senator Snowe's amendment seeks to restore $6.3 billion over 7 years for undergraduate loans -- $1.124 billion of this from the termination of the NASA programs.\n\nHowever, the chairman's resolution protects undergraduate student loans. Under Chairman Domenici's resolution, interest on loans for undergraduate education does not accrue until graduation. So, for all students who enter the work force immediately after college, nothing has changed. With regard to individuals who choose to pursue graduate or professional coursework, interest would not accrue on their college debt until they complete this coursework. Chairman Domenici's resolution does change the present student loan program with respect to deferring interest payments accruing upon graduate and professional coursework. However, this burden is lessened by the chairman's budget by preserving the benefits of capped interest rates on student loans, federal guarantees, opportunities to defer payments in case of economic hardship, and Federal fellowship programs targeted specifically toward graduate students.\n\nThe Snowe amendment ignores the long-term impact that terminating these programs would have upon the U.S. balance of trade, the GNP and its consequent U.S. Treasury implication, and the generation of jobs in America. Consequently, I oppose this amendment, and urge my fellow colleagues to do the same.\n\nMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\nAMENDMENT NO. 1128\n\nMs. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by Senator Snowe and others that would reduce funding for NASA's Aeronautics Program by $1.1 billion over the next 5 years. The $1.1 billion reduction proposed in the Snowe amendment for Aeronautics is in addition to the $800 million reduction proposed for NASA's Aeronautics Program that is included in the chairman's mark.\n\nThe effect of the Snowe amendment would be to eliminate NASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology Development and High-Speed Research programs which make up the core of NASA's Aeronautics program.\n\nMr. President, the aeronautics industry contributes over 1 million high quality jobs to the U.S. economy and generates $20 to $30 billion in exports each year. But U.S. aircraft and engine manufacturers must compete on both cost and technical capability against government-subsidized foreign competition.\n\nThe European Airbus Consortium already claims more than one-third of the commercial aircraft market, a market once dominated by U.S. manufacturers. The goal of Airbus is to control 50 percent of the global market by the year 2005.\n\nI do not intend to let the Europeans accomplish their goal, Mr. President. That is why, when I was chair of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, I pushed NASA to expand their research and technology efforts in aeronautics.\n\nNASA's Advanced Subsonic Technology program specifically addresses future technology needs in next-generation subsonic aircraft -- from large commercial jets to small general aviation aircraft -- and the evolving airspace system. NASA's role is to develop high-risk, high-payoff pre-competitive technologies to prove technical feasibility and then transfer these new technologies to the FAA, DOD, and U.S. industry.\n\nElimination of the Advanced Subsonic Technology program would terminate NASA's efforts to develop technologies to increase the capacity of the airspace system, to ensure that the existing aging aircraft fleet remains safe and cost-effective, and that the technologies needed for U.S. industry to meet international environmental, noise, and pollution regulations are available.\n\nMr. President, the Snowe amendment would also wipe out NASA's High Speed Research program which is conducting the early, high-risk technology development needed for an environmentally compatible and economically competitive high speed civil transport (HSCT). The goal of this program is develop a plane that would fly at more than twice the speed of sound and carry 300 passengers over 5,000 nautical miles at fares competitive with existing subsonic aircraft.\n\nMr. President, the stakes associated with the development of the HSCT are enormous. If the Europeans are the first to market an HSCT, it will cost the U.S. larger trade deficits and the loss of hundreds of thousands of high-skilled, high-wage jobs. If the U.S. wins this race, the U.S. market share for commercial aircraft could grow to nearly 80 percent, and create $200 billion in sales and 140,000 new jobs.\n\nMr. President, I happen to believe that the best social program is a job, and that job creation in America must be linked to our manufacturing base. Manufacturing in the new economy of a post-cold war era will require high technology and competitiveness in the global marketplace.\n\nAmerica's future in manufacturing begins and ends with aeronautics. Commercial aviation is one of the few areas of manufacturing where the U.S. continues to export more than we import, and where we are able to provide high-skilled, high quality jobs for American workers.\n\nMr. President, I do not intend to let our commercial aviation industry go the way of the VCR, the automobile, or the textile industry. I intend to fight to keep the U.S. aeronautics industry competitive so that we preserve the jobs we have and the job opportunities needed for the 21st century.\n\nThe Snowe amendment would reduce funding for NASA's Aeronautics Program by two-thirds over the next 5 years. The amendment is shortsighted and threatens our ability to develop a manufacturing strategy for this Nation.\n\nI urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I yield the floor.\n\nMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe. I, too, am concerned about the deep cuts -- $14.6 billion over 7 years -- in the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan and Federal Family Education Loan Programs which make it possible for many of our young people to pursue a higher education.\n\nHowever, I cannot support an amendment to restore funding for mandatory programs, such as the $6.3 billion for these student loan programs, by cutting nonmilitary discretionary programs by an equal amount. In other words, it would not cut military spending at all, even though it is the only area of the discretionary budget that will not be cut under this budget resolution. Not only is this robbing Peter to pay Paul, it violates the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 which prohibits offsetting tax cuts or mandatory program expansions with cuts in discretionary programs.\n\nIn addition, it is not growth in nonmilitary discretionary programs which is driving up the Federal deficit. This spending has been at a hard freeze or below since 1993. The budget resolution before us would cut nonmilitary discretionary programs nearly $200 billion below a freeze over the next 7 years. Meanwhile, mandatory programs and tax expenditures will continue to grow -- the latter with no restraint at all under this budget resolution.\n\nNo one understands the value of a higher education better than I, but I cannot support this amendment which would set an unacceptable precedent for funding mandatory programs with nonmilitary discretionary program cuts.\n\nMr. DODD. Mr. President, has all time been yielded back?\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has 21/2 minutes remaining.\n\nMrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we yield back the remainder of our time.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Maine yield back her time?\n\nMs. SNOWE. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n\nMr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\nAMENDMENT NO. 1131 TO AMENDMENT NO. 1128\n\n(Purpose: To restore $28 billion in outlays over seven years to\n\nreduce by $16 billion the discretionary cuts proposed in education and reduce the reconciliation instructions to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources (primarily affecting student loans) by $12 billion by closing corporate tax loopholes)\n\nMr. DODD. Mr. President, I send a substitute to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer this substitute amendment to the Snowe-Abraham amendment on behalf of myself and Senators Harkin, Hollings, Kennedy, Jeffords, Pell, Wellstone, and Simon.\n\nAs I understand it, there are now 5 minutes to be allocated on either side?\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\nMr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment which will restore $28 billion to our education programs. This is substantially less than the amendment that was offered yesterday by several of my colleagues, but this amendment would reduce the committee's instruction and, thereby, the cuts in student loans by $12 billion and restore $16 billion in discretionary cuts in education.\n\nThis amendment is also deficit neutral. While certainly in these resolutions it is ultimately up to the committees of jurisdiction as to where specifically they will make their cuts, I offset this $28 billion and suggest specifically four areas within the Tax Code that would provide up to $65.7 billion in revenues currently lost through corporate tax loopholes.\n\nThese areas were identified in a list of corporate tax loopholes compiled by the chairman of the Budget Committee on the House side, Mr. Kasich from Ohio. Let me identify them specifically.\n\nYou can pick $28 billion out of the $65.7 billion they would garner. The issue is choosing between these tax loopholes or investing in the education of children in this country who need higher education and count on the Federal investment in critical elementary and secondary programs.\n\nOne is the expatriate billionaire tax loophole. Closing this loophole generates $2.1 billion. Those are people who leave the country, fly out of America to avoid their taxes. That is $2.1 billion. So that is part of the choice: Helping out those people or children and students in this country who need an education.\n\nThe second is $26 billion. This currently shields foreign source income of U.S. firms from U.S. taxes, which should apply to that income. This change alone generates $26 billion. If you do not want to take all $26 billion, you can reduce that somewhat, since I offer a total of $65 billion in offsets. I understand it may be important to some firms, but we are making tough choices around here. So you have to ask yourself on this one: Should we modify that tax loophole to some degree to help pay for the education needs of America? That is my second tax loophole.\n\nMy third permits U.S. exporters to exempt a portion of their export income from U.S. taxation -- the House Budget Committee's figures suggest that this would generate an additional $10.9 billion. Again, you do not have to take all of it here, since there is the other part of the total $65 billion. But can't we take some of that money and try and restore these funds for the educational needs of America?\n\nAnd last, Mr. President, the one that provides $26.3 billion is one that interacts with the foreign tax credit provisions in a way that can effectively exempt a portion of a firm's export income from U.S. taxation. It is called the inventory property sales source rule exemption. The title is vague to me, but there is what Mr. Kasich said it does.\n\nSo $26.3 billion, $10.9 billion, $26.4 billion and $2.1 billion -- that is $65.7 billion. I would like to get just $28 billion out of that $65 billion to try and shield students and families from the crushing blow of these education cuts -- and preserve their access to higher education and continue our partnerships with schools and communities across this country in elementary and secondary education.\n\nThat is the choice: Whether you want to keep these tax loopholes or restore the $28 billion. We all make tough decisions.\n\nAgain, this is Mr. Kasich's list, this is not my list. These are the provisions he suggested that we ought to be looking at as a way to try to deal with deficit reduction. My amendment allows us to take these steps while simultaneously making the kinds of investments families across America need -- $12 billion to protect the student loan program and $16 billion to support critical discretionary programs like Pell grants, title I, and Head Start. Families and students need that kind of help.\n\nMr. President, this is an investment we must make in our future. Last Congress was hailed as the education Congress. We passed legislation lowering student loan costs, Head Start legislation that was to move us to fully funding all eligible children, the Goals 2000 legislation offering vital federal support to local efforts to improve our schools.\n\nWith this budget, we back away from our commitment. At this rate we will need to rename that last act if we are being honest with the American people. Why do we not call it Goals 3000 because, obviously, if we continue with the cuts proposed here we are never going to reach our goals, Goals 2000 becomes an absolute mirage. It does not exist. As this resolution is, we move the goal posts further down the road and make our education deficit that much larger.\n\nSo here is the choice: Billionaire tax loophole and some modification of the treatment of export income or critical investments in education.\n\nMr. President, I strongly urge that my colleagues support us in this substitute amendment. This gives this body the opportunity to demonstrate that the educational needs of America are just as important -- just as important -- as the export income or the billionaire tax loophole. The issue is, do you want to defend these interest, or do you want to defend families who are out there making investments in their children's educations. Investments which fundamentally contribute to the economic security of this Nation in the 21st century. To turn our backs on the educational needs of these children and their families I think would be a great tragedy.\n\nThe health of a nation depends upon many things. Fiscal responsibility is clearly one of them, but also an educated society, a well-prepared society. There are families that are out there telling their children to stay in school and study hard and do their homework, and go to college. We break a contract with them when those loans are not there or at such a high cost that they cannot avoid them. Fifty percent of all students in higher education today receive some form of assistance -- one out of every two. Yet, here we are slashing $14 billion out of these programs while we shield expatriot billionaires from their taxes and protect export income. We urge you to support our substitute.\n\nMrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n\nMs. SNOWE. Mr. President, here we go again. I hope that Members of the Senate will oppose this amendment. It is another generic amendment. You did not hear any specifics, other than the $6.3 billion and the $28 billion that would be necessary under this amendment through corporate welfare reductions and tax loopholes. While we all might agree with that goal, there is no specificity. It conveniently lacks specificity because they do not want to offend anybody. But that is not the responsible budgetary approach. That is why the Snowe-Abraham amendment is a credible approach in restoring $6.3 billion in education.\n\nIf you want to make sure that those funds are restored, then you must support the Snowe-Abraham amendment.\n\nThe amendment that is before us now, offered by the Senator from Connecticut, is illusory. It does not offer any instructions. It leaves potential instructions to the appropriate committees to determine how they reach the $28 billion. Unfortunately, that has been the process, not only here on the floor of the Senate but also in the Budget Committee. There were a number of Members who offered amendments to increase spending -- the accumulation of spending of more than $500 billion and $77 billion in tax increases -- but no corresponding amendments to reduce Federal spending, which is the goal of this budget resolution, and it is also a goal to reach a balanced budget.\n\nYes, we remember offsets. But at least we are in a position to say to the committee that this is the way in which you can arrive at these numbers. Do you want to make a decision about eliminating aircraft in the executive branch or raising funds for education? I think the choice is an easy one, and that is what this amendment is all about.\n\nSo I hope that Members of the Senate will oppose the Dodd amendment because it is not credible, because it does not offer responsible recommendations as to how to arrive at $28 billion worth of changes and at the same time do what we think is important by raising funds for education. The Snowe-Abraham amendment reaches that goal to provide the much-needed, very valuable school loan assistance programs to low- and middle-income families all across America.\n\nSo I urge the support of the Snowe-Abraham amendment in opposition to the Dodd amendment.\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\namendment no. 1131\n\nMr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I see a compromise. I see a way for the bipartisanship to return on education. It is a painful compromise on both sides, but we must pursue the art of the possible.\n\nMr. President, I tried 2 days ago, with my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, to make substantial progress toward restoring the cuts to education in this budget resolution with an amendment to restore $40 billion. That amendment was narrowly defeated. Yesterday, my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Exon attempted to restore $30 billion to education, as part of a package. That amendment narrowly failed.\n\nToday, the Republican Senators from Maine and Ohio, Senator Snowe and Senator DeWine have offered a $6.3 billion restoration to student loan cuts.\n\nWe are making progress. Republicans have admitted that there is a real problem in this budget in that it severely cuts education.\n\nBut Mr. President, $6.3 billion for student loans still leaves students paying billions more, essentially to provide tax cuts elsewhere. More importantly, we should not merely restore part of the college student aid cuts while accepting the 33 percent cuts in this budget resolution to the programs that serve children. This budget resolution cuts the 6 million children served under title I for the disadvantaged to 4 million. It cuts services for over 5 million disabled children served under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act by $5 billion. If it is wrong, economically, to cut student aid to provide tax cuts, as my Republican colleagues seem to concede, then it is certainly wrong to pass these huge cuts to education for younger children.\n\nThe means of bipartisan compromise is the Dodd amendment. It is a compromise that both sides can strain to reach. It restores a total of $28 billion. It does not fully restore the cuts to children's programs. It still reduces the number of children served, while we know that the number of children will rise. And, it fully -- not partially -- relieves college students of their part of cuts in student loans.\n\nMr. President, this amendment can help us rebuild the bipartisan consensus that education is a priority. We should not cut disadvantaged and disabled children, and it is economically foolish to do so. I know colleagues on both sides of the aisle believe this, and I urge all Senators to support this amendment.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. Do I have 3 minutes remaining?\n\nThe PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\nMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was searching in my mind for what Yogi Berra might say about this, but I cannot quite come up with it. \"De1ja2 vu all over again,\" yes; that sounds right. See, we just got behind us, we thought, the idea that the way to balance the budget was to raise taxes. We thought we had finished that off and that maybe so long as we were attempting to balance the budget by restraining Government, since the first effort 2 years ago to balance the budget relied heavily on tax increases and did not work and the deficit is still going up, we thought we ought to restrain Government in a very serious way. And the first real serious opportunity on the other side to change this budget resolution significantly is to raise taxes $25 billion for a good cause.\n\nNow, frankly, Mr. President, I believe the American people understand that the time has come to balance the budget by reining in Government, having less Government, redefining it, doing it better, doing it more efficiently. All of the arguments about what is happening to programs that we have in existence assumes that those programs are the only way to help A"
