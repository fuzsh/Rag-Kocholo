        "meta_description": "Calio, along with David W. Hobbs, John W. Howard, and Ziad S. Ojakli, begins by describing his work in the George H. W. Bush administration, as well as his early history as a congressional staffer. Calio then talks about the early years of the Bush 43 White House, with particular attention to the challenges of the pre-9/11 period. Calio covers a number of different topics, such as the No Child Left Behind Act, the general legislative process, relationships between the White House and Congress, and the impact of several key figures in that period, such as Dick Cheney, Trent Lott, and James Jeffords. Calio then talks about the changes brought about by the September 11 (9/11) terrorist attacks, and the ensuing wave of legislation, such as the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), the PATRIOT Act, campaign finance reform (McCain-Feingold), and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Calio also touches on a few other issues from the first term, including judicial appointments, the debate over stem cell research, and energy policy",

        "text": "Riley\n\nThis is the Nick Calio interview as a part of the George W. Bush Oral History Project. We're very grateful for your coming to Charlottesville for the sessions. We had a brief conversation before the recorder began about the ground rules; the most important one to reiterate is the basic rule of confidentiality, so you should feel free to speak candidly to the record.\n\nThis is an interesting experience for us because we don't have just one interviewee but a group of folks. I'm going to ask everybody around the table to identify yourself and say just a few words as an aid to the transcriptionist. I'm Russell Riley, I'm the chair of the Presidential Oral History Program here at the Miller Center.\n\nPerry\n\nI'm Barbara Perry and I'm a senior fellow here at the Presidential Oral History Program at the Miller Center.\n\nNelson\n\nI'm Mike Nelson, I teach at Rhodes College in Memphis and do a lot of work with the Miller Center.\n\nKnott\n\nI'm Steve Knott, I'm currently a professor at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, but I worked for six years with Russell Riley here at the Miller Center.\n\nHobbs\n\nI'm David Hobbs. The first two years of the Bush Presidency I was the House Deputy.\n\nOjakli\n\nI'm Ziad Ojakli, also known as \"Z.\" I was Deputy Assistant for the Senate for the first three years of the administration.\n\nHoward\n\nI'm Jack Howard, and the first two years of the Bush White House I was called the Inside Deputy, which is kind of a nefarious-sounding title we can discuss later.\n\nCalio\n\nI'm Nick Calio and I was the Assistant to the President for the first two years of the Bush administration.\n\nRiley\n\nWe're delighted to have you. As I said before, I think our contacts go back at least to 2003 when we were trying to recruit you.\n\nCalio\n\nI can't remember if it was you or someone else going back to Bush 41 where I never got my act together to get down here. I regret--always too busy, something going on.\n\nRiley\n\nWe may talk a little bit about that. It would be nice particularly to get some comparisons from you since our mission is to do these things across administrations.\n\nCalio\n\nWe did look at the questions and tried to bone up a little bit. There are things I'll offer if you ask those questions because there were significant contrasts.\n\nRiley\n\nWe like to start out with a little bit of biography. Nick, tell us a little about your background, where you're from and a bit about your education, your experiences, and originally getting involved in politics.\n\nCalio\n\nI went to undergrad at Ohio Wesleyan University where I'm now on the board. I went to Case Western Reserve Law School in Cleveland. I went to Washington, which I'd wanted to do since the seventh grade. I was a real-life practicing lawyer, the first associate in a small firm with a very good practice, which meant I got to do a lot of things that most young lawyers don't get to do.\n\nI left the firm after three years to go to a \"conservative public-interest law firm,\" the Washington Legal Foundation. Because I was leaving they made me \"of counsel\" to the firm. I made more money for 15 or 20 hours a month than I did as an associate, which was a good thing early on. Then I got stopped on the street one day by a guy I had done work with on product liability law reform, Dirk Van Dongen, and he offered me a job as head of government affairs for the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, which is kind of like the middle class of business and all the little trucks you see all over.\n\nThe constituency was largely homogenous in that it was almost all Republican--because they were small businesses at the time. We got heavily involved working with the [Ronald] Reagan administration. I got offered a job in the Reagan administration twice but thought I was making too much money.\n\nI worked on the '88 campaign for President [George H. W.] Bush 41 and then went in the administration as the House Deputy for the first two and a half years. I left in July of '91, got asked to come back to head the office when Fred McClure left at the end of December of '92, spent the following year working hard to lose the election. Jack and I were discussing that last night. We were together for Bush 41.\n\nHoward\n\nIt did take a lot of work.\n\nCalio\n\nIt did take a lot of work, took a lot of time, but we got there. [laughter] When we lost the election I started my own firm with Larry O'Brien, a Democrat whose father had been the chairman of the Democratic Party and the NBA [National Basketball Association] commissioner. Had a great firm, a great practice.\n\nRiley\n\nYou were Deputy in 41, who was the principal?\n\nCalio\n\nFred McClure.\n\nPerry\n\nWhat caused you in seventh grade to want to work in government?\n\nCalio\n\nMy father was an insurance salesman at the time and he won a trip to Florida. We drove through Washington, D.C., and I was fascinated by the monuments. I had an interest in politics already, and I just thought it would be a great place to work, I wanted to get involved with government.\n\nHoward\n\nI'm from New Jersey originally, had a similar sort of experience. We took a couple of family trips to Washington, thought it was really exciting to see all that sort of stuff. We came and met our Congressman and our Senator, Harrison Williams, who later ended up having to go to jail. [laughter] We thought that was pretty cool, what did we know? So that may have whetted my appetite a little bit.\n\nI went to school at Gettysburg College, about an hour north of Washington, and they ran a couple of internship programs. I didn't have any idea what I wanted to do when I graduated, but I did take a couple of internships and worked in Washington for a Congressman and also at what they called the National Republican Congressional Committee. This would have been probably 1977, '78. That is when I got bit by the bug. I thought it was really cool, I liked it down there.\n\nUntil I could figure out what I wanted to do for my career I thought I'd come to Washington and work for a couple of years. When I graduated I was hired by a Congressman from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, name of Bob Walker. He had no reason to hire me whatsoever. I wasn't from the district, I didn't know anything about the issues he hired me to handle, but he took a flying leap and hired me.\n\nBob developed a reputation as being the House floor watchdog. His job every day was to come in and figure out some way to tie the Democratic majority in knots, drive them to distraction with all sorts of procedural things. I did a lot of the staff work, and for a kid who was 23 or 24 years old this was great. All we did was roll hand grenades out there and watch the Democrats basically blow themselves up.\n\nI eventually became his chief of staff, but in the course of all the floor activity and antics that Bob engaged in, I came to the attention of the Republican leadership, for the good for the most part, though a few times there were things Bob did that drove the Republican leadership crazy as well. But in any event I came to the attention of Trent Lott, the House Republican Whip at the time. He wanted a lot of that sort of floor activity in his office.\n\nSo I went to work for Trent Lott as his floor assistant for a couple of years. That's where I really started to understand the broader nuances of how the House actually works from a procedural standpoint. He was the Whip so he did a lot of vote counting and strategy. That is where I really took a liking to that. Unfortunately he ran for the Senate in 1988. He had grand designs. He wanted me to go to the Senate. He was going to shake up that institution and I was like, \"I don't really like the Senate too much, I'm not so sure I want to--More power to you, you're a freshman Senator, I'm sure you're going to be great, but as a staff person I just don't think I'm suited for the Senate.\" Too many egos, especially at the staff level. That's the thing that got me. It's one thing for the Senators to have the big egos, it's another thing entirely for the staff to have big egos too.\n\nBush got elected in 1988. They offered me a job in the Legislative Affairs operation on the House side, working with Nick. That was terrific too. You still stay associated with House Republicans. We were in the minority.\n\nRiley\n\nPermanent minority.\n\nHoward\n\nPretty much, although there was a growing movement within the conference to do things drastically differently than they had in the past. We had a great four years. In the Legislative Affairs operation pretty much all we did was veto things, that's all we could do. Every once in a while we'd work out some kind of a deal. At the end of four years, that's pretty much all we had to show for ourselves, our veto strength, which didn't convince enough of the American people to reelect us. So we lost our jobs. I decided I wanted to go back to the Hill.\n\nSome people thought I was crazy for wanting to do that, but I went back to the Hill. Newt Gingrich was the Whip at the time. He offered me a job. I thought, This is great, I'll go back to doing what I really like doing in the Whip's office, vote counting, all that kind of stuff. Newt's idea was he was beefing up his policy staff so that when he became Speaker, in his mind, two years from then, he would have a Speaker staff in place.\n\nI thought, I don't know about that part. We were in the permanent minority. Great for you, you're going to be out there talking about being Speaker and things like that, but if this is what it takes to get me back on the House side, OK. I did that for two years and then lo and behold, Newt was right and we did take over in '95. The next thing we find ourselves in the Speaker's office doing the Contract with America and all that sort of thing. I stayed with him until the bitter end.\n\nHe got thrown overboard basically in 1998. Then I actually worked for Bob Livingston for about a month until he quit. I started thinking, There's sort of a pattern here. Then Denny Hastert took over. I had come to like and respect Denny Hastert. By that point I was figuring I had to get out of here. Hastert said, \"Look, I have no idea how to be Speaker, I don't know how the office functions. I don't really want to be Speaker. Would you mind sticking around for a little bit and helping me?\"\n\nI said, \"I've got nothing else to do, I don't have a job either. I'll help you for at least a little bit.\" I stayed for about six or nine months; I can't remember exactly. Trent Lott was Senate majority leader at the time. Every time he came down to meet with Hastert, or Newt for that matter, he'd come down the little back hallway. He'd say, \"When are you going to come over to the Senate and get a real job?\" That would drive Newt crazy. \"He's got a real job, quit talking like that.\" Then I finally got to the point of thinking I was kind of at the end of my career on the House side. There's a lot of turmoil; maybe I will try to work on the Senate side.\n\nI always thought if I worked for anybody, it would be Trent Lott. So I went to work for him as the deputy chief of staff for almost two years. I had no burning desire to go back into the White House. Bush got elected, that was a close race. I never really had factored into my thinking that I'd go back to the White House. I figured I had done my time.\n\nI get a call from Nick, who says, \"Are there any circumstances under which you'd want to come back to the White House?\" When you get that call--up to that point I was very dubious and skeptical. It's time for new people to come in. Then Nick talked to me and I heard about some of the people he was bringing in and I saw the team and thought, That could be a lot of fun. So I ended up doing that for two years.\n\nThen I left. My kids were getting ready to go to college. I had to pay for college and things like that. So now I'm a lobbyist in downtown Washington.\n\nRiley\n\nThat's terrific. Z?\n\nOjakli\n\nGosh, where did it begin? I'm from Brooklyn, New York, and went to school at Georgetown [University]. I still have my boxes to unpack. I got the fever. Never thought I would get into politics. When I was a kid I liked to memorize the Presidents and statistics, Martin Van Buren. Who was the 13th President? Millard Fillmore, little statistics here and there, kind of weird stuff.\n\nRiley\n\nJanuary 7, that's Fillmore's birthday.\n\nOjakli\n\nVery nice, I'm in the right place.\n\nKnott\n\nYou're among nerds.\n\nOjakli\n\nI feel in good stead here. Never thought I'd get involved in politics. I actually wanted to go back home to New York, but I got involved my sophomore year with an internship for Jack Kemp and started working on his political action committee. This is when he was thinking about running for President. One thing led to another. The PAC [political action committee] became the exploratory committee that became the Presidential campaign. I stayed on for three years and did just about every job that you could do in the campaign to where I became a volunteer coordinator, and my job was essentially running around to every campus to compete against the monolith, the Bush campaign and the [Robert] Dole campaign, and try to pull in volunteers, college kids, to man the jobs that all the other campaigns could pay for. We would try to get all the young people in the D.C. area to come work for Jack Kemp.\n\nI did that through college, went out to Iowa and really got the bug, knew that's what I wanted to do. When I graduated, I wasn't sure what I would do after graduation, but the chief of staff to Jack Kemp was a guy named Dave Hoppe, and he was the new chief of staff to the new Senator from Indiana who was appointed to fill Dan [J. Danforth] Quayle's spot, Dan Coats. I called him on a whim and said, \"Do you have any jobs?\" He interviewed me and the week after graduation I started as a legislative correspondent so I started writing letters. Boy, that was an interesting job. You learn from ground zero what people are thinking, what's on their minds.\n\nCalio\n\nWe could have put you in charge of that, correspondence.\n\nOjakli\n\nShould have, you missed your chance. I was darn good. I did that for a while. Because Dan was appointed he had to run twice--in '90 and then in '92 for the six-year term. I got sent out in '90 to work around the state. It was the big budget mess of 1990 if you recall. I went through many of the 92 counties. I would go everywhere I could and talk about Dan Coats and basically talk about his record. So I got sent out, got to learn Indiana for three, four months and campaigned. I really got to like campaigning.\n\nI came back, was an LA [legislative assistant] for a few years, did every issue under the sun, kind of topped out doing the issues. I left there, went briefly to the National Restaurant Association, and lobbied for them. Four square meals a day, great job, access to the finer restaurants in D.C. You could always get your reservations to the top of the line, made a lot of friends. But it was right around that time that the Republicans took back the House. In the Coats office, the person I sat next to, Mark Souder, was the policy director and not someone you'd ever think of running for office.\n\nHoward\n\nWhich is saying a lot, considering some of the Members I talked to.\n\nOjakli\n\nBut he went home and ran and won, so he asked me to be his chief of staff. I left the Restaurant Association and I was his chief of staff for his first three years. Then I went back over to the Senate. I was asked by Senator [Paul] Coverdell of Georgia to be his policy director. I spent a couple of years as his policy director and then as chief of staff in his leadership office. In between policy director and chief of staff I went down to Georgia. He had a tough campaign in 1998 and I spent some time living in Georgia, working on his campaign, which was an incredible experience. I worked for him through 2000. He became then Governor Bush's liaison to the Senate and his job was to round up all the endorsements he could, a job he did marvelously. But unfortunately and very sadly, he passed away in office.\n\nAfter wrapping up the office I went over to the RNC [Republican National Committee] and ran Congressional relations for what they called Victory 2000. It was a two-person shop: me and another person from Senator Coverdell's office. We basically took Member requests, everything from Senator Orrin Hatch wanting the Mormon Tabernacle Choir to play at the inaugural if there was one, to just passing messages back to the campaign. We did that for a couple of months, actually just passing back what was going on in Congress.\n\nAfter the election I wound up going over to the transition out in McLean. It was just an empty building and you watched how it was just floors of emptiness and a few chairs. Then the chairs became little modules and desks came in and offices were set up and it just mushroomed and filled in. It was neat to watch that happen over time.\n\nIn the transition I was the Senate liaison, same job ultimately that I had at the White House. Went through that and then when Nick came in--we were talking about this last night--one day over at the Library of Congress I was standing around minding my own business, and Nick came over and did me the honor of asking me if I'd come serve in the White House and be the Deputy for the Senate. I was honored to do that for three years.\n\nIn the White House, I had three kids under three. I had twins who were born right after the election, during the whole court battle. We were joking if one of them was a boy, we were going to call him Chad. It was a tense time because you didn't know--\n\nHoward\n\nHappily they were girls.\n\nOjakli\n\nIt was a very tense time. Having three kids under three, after year three it was about time to look for something more reasonable in terms of schedule, so I picked a cakewalk of a job at Ford, in the auto industry, going through the economic downturn and everything else.\n\nRiley\n\nDavid, how about you?\n\nHobbs\n\nI was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but moved to Houston at a very young age. I think I wanted to be a lawyer when I grew up. I don't know that I was that interested in politics but somewhere along the way I got interested. I went to the University of Texas and majored in government and then came to George Washington for a semester and wandered into the office of my local Congressman, Bill Archer, and said, \"I'd like to volunteer.\" They said sure. My classes were mostly later in the afternoon so I could work in the morning. As Jack said, that's kind of where the bug bit me.\n\nBill later became the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee but a lot of good experiences there, really enjoyed watching the legislative process. We were watching it then because we were always going to be in the minority. So I went back to the University of Texas and graduated. Then I thought I wanted to go to law school, but I worked for a year in between for Ron Paul in his district office as a field representative. I drove all around the 22nd District to smaller towns, and I think the highlight might have been awarding some Jaycee award in a prison. I decided that wasn't where I wanted to be.\n\nI went to graduate school, got my master's in public affairs from the LBJ [Lyndon B. Johnson] School [of Public Affairs], very interesting, small school at the time, only about 25 people in the class. Barbara Jordan was my graduate advisor. It was me and Bill Hughes, who these guys know, became the Speaker's policy director at one point. We were the only Republicans in the school.\n\nAfter graduating from there in '83, I came to Washington and worked for Ron. That was a very interesting process. Ron Paul is Ron Paul. He's a good man and I suspect that 200 years ago he was probably the idea that the Framers had in mind for a Member. It used to really rankle me that he was always voting no. I thought he was right on the issues but it was always no, no, no. So in 1984 Dick Armey was elected and I went to work for Dick as his legislative director. He started out just like Ron Paul and earned the moniker \"Dr. No.\" Again it was kind of like, \"Dick, if we could just give a little, we could be more relevant and start accomplishing things.\" One story is that as a sophomore Member of the minority party, not on the committee of jurisdiction, Dick passed the base-closing initiative, the BRAC [Base Realignment and Closure Commission] process. To me the sign that Dick had arrived came when they used to write the politics and policy page on the back of the Wall Street Journal, and Jeff Birnbaum wrote, \"Texas GOP [Grand Old Party] Member changes tactics, starts accomplishing things in the House.\" I think he probably would regret it, but I think he's a rival in terms of a legislator.\n\nI was fully infected so I moved back to Texas to start a foundation, the Institute for Policy Innovation, but I really wanted to be back in Texas so I could run for Congress. After a couple of years I ran for Congress in 1992 as these guys were throwing the Presidency away. [laughter]\n\nCalio\n\nNot throwing away, we chipped away at it consistently.\n\nHobbs\n\nIt started out well. That was the year that H. W., 41, was at 92 percent in January and I'm sad to report that I outran him in Fort Worth, Texas, and got 38 percent. I knocked on 10,000 doors and spent pretty much my entire life's savings, but I lost 40 pounds in the process, so that was good. I went back to the foundation and then the miracle of miracles happened, the Republicans took the House.\n\nI moved back to Washington. Dick had been elected majority leader and for four years I was his policy coordinator/senior floor assistant. Jack was there, Newt had grand visions and Newt kind of wanted to run the world, and running the House of Representatives should be delegated to other people, and he started a tradition that sort of exists. The Speaker is the Speaker. He delegated a lot of responsibility to the majority leader to schedule the floor and to work with the Rules Committee in terms of what amendments--so for four years I really enjoyed that process. You got to know the Members, all of them, and the ebb and flow and the dynamics of it. Then in '98 when Newt left, Dick's chief of staff, Kerry Knott, left as well, so I became the leader's chief of staff in '99 and 2000.\n\nThen Bush won and Nick was very nice and asked me to come to the White House. I thought about it long and hard. I wasn't sure I wanted to do it. He had Andy Card call me and he had John Boehner come by. I've thanked him for it many times since. For some reason, fate or whatever, I decided I'd go. So for the first two years I was the House Deputy with these guys. Then after Nick left I took his job as Assistant to the President and did that for two years. In the meantime my wife and I--we had been in the adoption process for a long time--were blessed to adopt a newborn from Pennsylvania during my last year. I remember when the President got elected and went to the Reagan Center he said, \"Hobbsy, you have to stay one more year.\"\n\nI said, \"Sir, I have an eight-month-old baby at home. I'm 46 years old, I'm not going to get too many more cracks at this and I don't see him awake Monday through Friday. So I appreciate it, let me think about it.\" I decided to move on to the more lucrative but considerably more boring lobbying world. That's what I've been doing since I left the White House in February 2005.\n\nRiley\n\nTerrific. Anything you guys want to pick up on?\n\nNelson\n\nI'm thinking you probably had some encounters with George W. Bush in Texas, is that right?\n\nHobbs\n\nNot really. In '92 I was running for Congress against Pete [Preston] Geren who later became a Republican. I went and visited with Governor Bush and I remember calling up and saying, \"Can I come by?\" and he says, \"What's going on, how can I help you?\"\n\nI said, \"I'm running against this guy in Fort Worth, Pete Geren, and I'd really like your help and support.\" He said, \"I'd do everything I can for you except that his best friend is my business partner in the Texas Rangers. So good luck, buddy.\"\n\nNelson\n\nNick, did you have any encounters with him when you were in the first Bush White House?\n\nCalio\n\nYes, I did. If I could just add one thing since I didn't say I was from Cleveland, Ohio. One thing I should have said, the whole point about the wholesaler's job was, we did a lot of work with the Reagan administration on all those big economic issues, the budget, led the coalition on tax reform. That's where I honed my vote-counting skills, did a lot of work with Jack and with Trent Lott's office. So I met him on the first campaign.\n\nI actually started out working for Dole. When the campaign was getting up and going, Lee Atwater came to me and my boss and asked us to both work for H. W. [George Herbert Walker Bush]. This was in '87. With all the tax work I did, I had a good relationship with Dole, who was behind by about 30 points in the polls. So my boss said to me, \"It occurs to me that probably you ought to split it up. One of us ought to go with Bush, one of us ought to go with Dole so we're covered.\" I said, \"Yes, that makes sense.\"\n\nHe said, \"You probably have a better relationship with Dole.\" I said, \"You sign my paychecks, I'm going with Dole.\" So I went with Dole. That campaign was a model of organization and efficiency and any effort to bring organization to it, which I tried to do in terms of contacts and setting up state and local groups, didn't work out too well. Once that was over I got asked to go over to the Bush Congressional relations campaign. That's where I first met W, in passing. He was always around the campaign, confident to the point of being cocky, really funny, very friendly. But it was only in passing. I'd see him occasionally around campaign headquarters and then at the convention some.\n\nAfter that I didn't have a lot of contact with him while I was the House Deputy. When I became the Assistant, he called on a number of occasions about issues and what was going on. It wasn't a lot; I didn't know him well at all.\n\nHoward\n\nWe used to see him around.\n\nNelson\n\nHe called you in what capacity?\n\nCalio\n\nSon of the President, sometimes troubleshooting for his father.\n\nHoward\n\nYes, he did a lot of that.\n\nCalio\n\nAnd did it, I would say, increasingly as time went on.\n\nHoward\n\nYes.\n\nCalio\n\nParticularly he did that the first three years, and that last year he became increasingly involved.\n\nHoward\n\nYes, that's when you saw most of him. You would see him in the hallways, in the West Wing, just walking around. Not frequently, but you'd see him around. I thought, Just a member of the family; it's not that unusual to see members of the family. You'd see Barbara Bush all the time. He was very involved, like Nick said, in the last--particularly when things were starting to spiral out of control. I think just in loyalty to his father he felt he needed to jump in and try to right the ship.\n\nRiley\n\nIs it fair to say he wasn't somebody that you might have thought of as an elected official at the time? Somebody who would run for office?\n\nHoward\n\nI don't think so, I don't think he did either at that point, was entertaining those notions.\n\nCalio\n\nThis is total speculation on my part, but I think what happened throughout '91 and '92 to his father is probably where he started thinking about it. He came to the Governorship with very clear ideas about what not to do and how he would not operate, which he transferred to the Presidency pretty clearly.\n\nHoward\n\nI agree with that. I don't think he had a notion that \"If I'm ever President I'm not going to do it this way,\" but I think a lot of what he learned and saw in '91 and '92 he applied to his White House and basically how not to do things.\n\nNelson\n\nFor example?\n\nCalio\n\nHow you communicate, you don't make everything all gray, it's not very nuanced. When you want to make a public statement it has to be black or white. It's his opinion. You can probably carry that to an extreme. Putting our staff together, the conversations I had with him about whether I would take the job or not were all based on my experience in 41 and my background and what I did in business, in my firm, how you organize a staff, how you operate it on a day-to-day basis. It had to be a contrast, otherwise for me it wasn't worth taking the job.\n\nI had decided I wanted to go back in because you get that bug, you can't resist when the call comes. But the two White Houses operated in very different fashions.\n\nHoward\n\nOne of the things he consciously got away from was having a strong, very visible Chief of Staff. John Sununu was Chief of Staff with 41, with whom we got along great, we had a terrific relationship, but he was a dominant figure. Pretty much everything went through Sununu. I think 43 decided, \"I'm not going to have that kind of Chief of Staff. I'm going to have somebody who is lower profile, not as controversial, much more collegial than Sununu was.\"\n\nCalio\n\nIn going down to talk to him, it started out I didn't have a lot of involvement in the 2000 campaign except for raising money. I went down to an event in Austin at one point and got a big hello from across the room and then a big hug afterward. I was a Sherpa in the transition and one of the Sherpas for Mitch Daniels. First Rob Portman called and said, \"Everybody says you'd be the best guy for the job, but everybody says you won't take it, so I'm calling to find out whether you would consider it because they don't want to call you if not.\"\n\nI said, \"I'd consider it.\" About a week later Andy called. It was right before Christmas and he said they needed a center for the White House basketball team. It is a story that dates back to Bush 41, where I got a call because Bo Derek was down in the Press Office so I should come down. You know, she's flat-out gorgeous. She's radiant. I walk in and Andy says, \"Oh, Bo, I want you to meet Nick Calio; he's the center on the White House basketball team.\" So I turned this color. The joke was on them because she says, \"Oh, that's not nice.\" She comes up, grabs me, and gives me a hug.\n\nAnyway, then nothing happened for a week or two--\n\nRiley\n\nWith Bo Derek?\n\nCalio\n\nNo, with Andy. At any rate, Andy called and said, \"Would you be interested in coming and talking to the President?\"\n\nI said, \"I would be but, Andy, I want to get certain things clarified. This is not just to go down and say yes.\" So I went down, I guess it was January 2, January 3. I went to the mansion. He and I met in the dining room. There was a lot of kerfuffle going on because they were going to announce [Karl] Rove, [Karen] Hughes, and [Joseph] Allbaugh that day for their positions.\n\nSo we talked. I wanted to know how he planned to operate the White House and the White House staff. I said, \"To be candid, I learned a lot from your father's administration.\" I thought in 41 the President was insulated and isolated. We loved Sununu, we got along great with Sununu, but he did a really good job of isolating the President. Almost no one got in. The way the Legislative Affairs office was operated I think there were people on staff who it may not have been Fred's choice to put there, but they were put there for certain reasons. As a Deputy even, I gained more and more access to the President, but not a lot because almost nobody did. It wasn't a good thing.\n\nFor instance, on vote counts, on issues--as a frontline person everything you said, everything you would relay was put through a filter and you were never sure it was going through the right way, what arguments were made back if people said no. I don't think that's a good way to work. I told the President that. He said he was going to operate in a very different fashion, that he knew the problems with his father's White House, that he thought he was too isolated and that caused him problems, that there were too few inputs into the President. That's not the way he operated as Governor, and that's not how he would operate the Presidency.\n\nWe talked about strategy. He said, \"I'm going to use the issues that I ran on, that I campaigned on, as my agenda as President to start.\" We talked about being in on the ground floor for strategy. I said, \"I'm not going to be on the outside. I've seen that with businesses where the government affairs people or the legislative people aren't part of the strategy. The strategy is made up, and there are all these government impediments or obstacles so the strategy doesn't work.\"\n\nHe said that it would not be that way, that Legislative Affairs would be in all the decision making. I also said that I wanted nominally access for myself. Obviously I'm going to operate through Andy, I'm not going to walk in all the time, although he did have a fairly open office as it turned out. But I wanted access for my staff too. I'm going to be very heavily involved in everything, but I'm not going to sit there--there will be people on staff who are always going to know more than I do. They ought to be in the meetings. You can have all these policy people and all these other--I don't want to call them hangers-on, but everybody wants to be at the meeting.\n\nAs Andy used to say, \"It's not a matter of wanting to be there, it's a matter of needing to be there.\"\n\nHoward\n\nThe President used to say that himself, \"I don't want all the straphangers around.\"\n\nCalio\n\nBut he didn't consider my folks straphangers, he liked our staff. I said, \"For the Legislative Affairs staff, the coin of the realm and the credibility comes from speaking for the President. They have to know that I am speaking for you and that I can speak.\" He said, \"They will know that you are speaking for me.\" I said, \"But for my staff, if it is known that they see you, that you know them, that gives them so much more credibility. All of this leads to the fact that we will be able to do the job better for you.\" We agreed on that.\n\nI said I wanted to be able to hire all the Assistant Secretaries for the Cabinet. I said, \"There are going to be some Cabinet Secretaries who won't like that. We'll have some fights over that, but we've got to have that input because in your father's administration, and in every administration, to be clear, some Cabinet Secretaries are outliers and they hire their own people who have loyalties to the Cabinet Secretary, which in a sense it should be, but they all work for the President. You don't need to be finding out that you're speaking with three voices.\" He agreed to that. That included the other White House offices, National Security, Council on Environmental Quality, and input on the Vice President's.\n\nI said, \"We'll all be part of one big staff, we'll all work for you and if anybody is starting to stray or you reach a decision and somebody strays from it, we'll be the first to know.\" And you know what? That worked in any number of instances where the Energy Secretary or somebody else decided something different would really work better. We knew and cut it right off at the head.\n\nIt was a good conversation. We agreed to do it and it went on from there. He also talked about communicating and how you need to communicate. He didn't think that the Bush 41 administration did a good job on communications.\n\nNelson\n\nPublic communications?\n\nCalio\n\nPublic communications. Probably internal as well. Then we talked about issues. That's when he told me we were going to go on the issues that he campaigned on. We talked about the tax part and had that famous discussion--of course I started getting legislative right away on him. He just leaned across and said, \"Nicky\"--actually he called me Slick at first. I said no.\n\nHoward\n\nWhy not?\n\nCalio\n\nWe're not going there. He said OK. So he started calling me Nicky, which he still does and Mrs. Bush does and Condi [Rice] does, which oddly enough is my legal name, which nobody knew at the time. Thank you, Mom.\n\nAt any rate, in the discussion about taxes, he leaned across the table and said, \"No. We're going to say 1.6 trillion, 1.8.\" I said, \"People are going to get irritated with you and they're going to get pissed off at us, but we're going to keep saying it. We might move, but we're not going to move until we really have to and we'll get a lot more of what we want. That's the way we're going to operate.\"\n\nWe talked about hitting the ground running, outreach to Members a lot. There was the rancor from the campaign. I think he had pretty much made the decision, or we had collectively made the decision, that we would run like we had a mandate.\n\nHoward\n\nYes.\n\nCalio\n\nBetween that and the outreach it would throw people off balance. That's how we proceeded.\n\nHobbs\n\nAlso started, not necessarily, with tax cuts but with something more bipartisan.\n\nOjakli\n\nEducation.\n\nHoward\n\nThere was a lot of, not pushback from people on the Hill because I was on the Hill actually when they were talking about a lot of this stuff. But the Republican leaders' advice to the President was, \"We need to start small. You have such a narrow majority; we need to prove that you can actually govern. We just need a few small legislative victories and then we'll move on to the bigger things.\"\n\nWhereas the President decided, \"No, we're going to start big and then we'll get to the other stuff later. We're going to focus exclusively on the big stuff until we get it done.\"\n\nRiley\n\nNick, let me ask a question again about the contrast between 41 and 43. Looking back on them, one of the big differences would have been that with 41 the foreign policy agenda was so dominant at the time as opposed to what you expected of 43, at least in January of 2001. It turns out very differently, but was that a factor in your discussions or not?\n\nCalio\n\nNot really. I think as a Governor and based upon what he had run on, which was education, taxes, Medicare, defense, and Social Security, which we can talk about later. These guys can really talk about that one. No, foreign policy wasn't--it was focused on the domestic agenda.\n\nRiley\n\nPart of the question was whether the sense of isolation for 41 might not in part have been the fact that he was kind of sequestered with Brent Scowcroft and with the foreign policy folks. At least the perception from the outside was that because he was focused on that, Sununu was charged with \"Take care of all the rest of the stuff while I'm piecing the world together.\"\n\nHoward\n\nThere might be something to that. There's no secret that 41's sympathies lay more in the foreign policy--I think that's where he felt very comfortable, given his background. Also the issue matrix at the time with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War, those tended to be the dominant issues, which was different from 43. For the first six months or so, there weren't any major foreign policy crises. At the time it was the economy, the economy was going down.\n\nLarry Lindsey, the President's economic advisor, was advising him that we were going into a recession. He campaigned on tax cuts. We had a surplus and things like that. That really was the focus at the time.\n\nPerry\n\nCould you talk a little bit about the President's rationale on starting big and not taking the strategy of \"your mandate is small so let's do little things\"? Does that come from his personality that you talked about as being, \"cocky\" is the word you used?\n\nCalio\n\nI said almost cocky.\n\nPerry\n\nAlmost cocky, to correct the record.\n\nCalio\n\nIn a good way.\n\nPerry\n\nIs it that force of personality, is it political strategy? What is it that has him say, \"No, we're not doing what people are recommending on the Hill; we're going this way\"?\n\nCalio\n\nIt's a combination of factors. I think it is his personality. I think he ran for President for a reason. He wanted to get things done and thought it was possible that you could operate as he did as Governor and reach out to people and work together as two parties. But in the transition--as short as it was--we were doing what became our infamous issue briefs, where you put your strategy on one piece of paper. It was never a question that we were going to try and start with all these big domestic issues and push them, but it did become a strategy that you couldn't start small or you'd never get anywhere. It was a conscious decision, at least on our part, that starting big, doing all this outreach, and I've got numbers on how many Members we had in the first week, and that never really stopped. We had meetings every week. He made himself very available.\n\nWe kept going, we had to just get past it, otherwise it was going to consume us and the agenda. So his personality was perfectly well fit to that. The election was in the past and we had to move on.\n\nHoward\n\nIt was a real test of his leadership. He could have easily succumbed to the conventional wisdom of \"OK, let's start small.\" In a lot of ways that's how Bill Clinton started his Presidency. He had a lot of advice from people that we ought to do welfare reform and this, that, and the other thing first. He decided to do health care.\n\nMy impression of Bush--Nick knows him way better than I do--he is intuitively a very smart guy, in some ways in contrast to the public perception. I think he knew most Presidencies you've got a narrow window, six months, nine months of your first term where you've got to get it done. Look back at Reagan. Reagan got his economic program through in the first eight months. That window shrinks rapidly. He intuitively knew that we have to start big, start fast, and jam as much as we can through the system, whether the Members liked it or not.\n\nCalio\n\nJack makes a good point because in terms of what so much of the public never realized, he was so intuitive and we would make recommendations on issues--I can't tell you the number of times. We'd be sitting there, talking points, this and that. He would come up with one line that made everything so understandable. I want to point that out, you juxtapose that with what I said about communications earlier. It's not just that it is black and white. You had to say things people could understand and relate to. He was very good at that. There may have been times where he faltered on that during his Presidency, but on a day-to-day basis he was really good.\n\nHoward\n\nHe drove the process by sheer force of personality and discipline. We had all these meetings, I don't know how many hundreds of them, but there were consistent themes in every meeting. \"We're moving fast, we're moving big, we're not going to compromise until we have to.\"\n\nCalio\n\nIf you go through this briefing book and look at the first six months and onward, there was consistency of message. Our notion was you had to have consistency of message and you use the messaging and the meetings to create unity, enforce discipline, and drive process. He was great in the meetings. He had an uncanny ability to know Members' names.\n\nHoward\n\nAs I said, it goes back to discipline. He was relentless, to the shock of the Members. I remember we'd get feedback, blowback from Members, leaders, \"We're moving too fast, we can't get this budget done in time.\" The President says, \"No, you're going to do it. You're going to have that budget off the floor by March, you're going to have the tax bill done by May.\" They were like, \"You've got to be kidding. We never move this fast.\" He kept driving the system and he got it done.\n\nOjakli\n\nI agree with everything said, it was speed and big early on, but also just a laser beam focus. It was almost like there were two big issues. It was focusing back on the campaign and making sure--you had a window to get to the campaign promises. One was a soft issue. What we would say would be textbook today--education reform. That's where everybody is on board. You have [Edward] Kennedy and Boehner. Looks like perfect compromise. Then you have a harder lift in a big tax-cut bill. So you had those two big pillars coming out of the box and trying to get those done early on.\n\nI remember a meeting that, Nick, you pulled together with our whole legislative team. The President came in and outlined all our priorities. I remember him saying specifically after walking through each of the big items he wanted to get done early, \"You know what? Sometimes when you want capital you have to spend some capital.\"\n\nHoward\n\nI remember that too.\n\nOjakli\n\nThat was a perfect crystallization of his philosophy early on.\n\nHobbs\n\nWhen you spend capital you get more capital.\n\nOjakli\n\nYes.\n\nCalio\n\nWe had a meeting in the Roosevelt Room of our entire staff including the staff assistants. By that time the entire staff was together, and between these three guys and everybody else we put together it was a rock-star staff.\n\nRiley\n\nI want you to park on that for a little while and tell us how you thought about structuring, whether you did anything different than you had seen before and what you were thinking about as you were trying to put the staff together and how it would function to serve you and the President.\n\nCalio\n\nI think my private-sector experience and the experience in the first Bush White House led me to certain conclusions. In one sense I didn't organize it any differently than we had in Bush 41, which was a change back from Clinton because they had all sorts of legislative people who didn't really have legislative experience and they wanted it heavy on policy. That just doesn't work. The Legislative Affairs office is a vote-counting machine. But you don't just count votes, you have to get votes and you have to know the policy and persuade people. There is the famous Bryce Harlow \"ambulatory bridge across the constitutional gulf.\" We were back and forth all the time, we're always up there.\n\nI wanted the three deputies. Jack was my first call because we had a long history together. Jack is very quiet and has no ego. I called him my shark in the first Bush administration.\n\nHoward\n\nI had my ego drummed out of me a long time ago.\n\nRiley\n\nBy?\n\nHoward\n\nWorking in the Legislative Affairs operation in the first Bush White House actually.\n\nCalio\n\nHe is also a good writer. So that Inside Deputy is critical, which I knew from Bush 41. We had Rob Portman as the Inside Deputy when I was the House Deputy. Then when I came back Rob had left and there was another person who really was not good at directing traffic. Wasn't good at anything. I had to push him out the door and it wasn't easy; it was like a corporate negotiation. I got Josh Bolten to come in as my Deputy. Even in '92 he made me look like a genius every day because he was selfless, faceless, and quickly made a name for himself. He was hard to pry out of USTR [United States Trade Representative], I had to use Carla Hills and a whole bunch of other people to call him, kind of the same thing I did with David.\n\nThere was a Senate retreat before we took office. Z had been working with Candi [Wolff]. When I had my own firm, for each client we'd put on paper what the issues were and what the approach to each issue was going to be. Everybody who had a context--I think it is really easy to get lazy. So it drove people crazy. We had a small firm, but we were so much better prepared than the other consultants because we considered who were our allies, who were the opponents and all that. Then Z, as I said, was doing these little strategy papers. I combined the two of them and they became our infamous issue briefs, which the staff hated but I think really, if you look back at them, I told these guys, self-serving, we were good. We had stuff down the line about how we were going to drive things, what the messaging had to be, what the bumps were going to be along the way.\n\nWhen we put the rest of the staff together you wanted people who were really good. You get people you can trust and the more trust you give them, the better they will do. That was part and parcel also, giving exposure to the President, to the Cabinet Secretaries and that. People feel more fulfilled and go on. They'll do a great job and make you look like a genius. People knew it. I was involved, but everybody had their head. They could make the call. We were very collaborative; we had a great team. It had to be a team. \"If you don't want to be part of a team,\" I would tell people, \"you don't belong here.\" We worked like crazy.\n\nWe also had fun. I instituted something called \"mandatory fun.\" With any White House, Republican, Democrat, whatever, it is very easy to become infused with your own importance. \"I've got to be here, I can't do that, we can't take time off.\" Every time I said, \"OK, get rid of the Blackberries and the pagers, we're going out. We're going to have some drinks, we're going to talk, not about business,\" it created a really good bonding. That served the President well because we were up on the Hill, we had better information, we knew everything that was going on. Members accepted us as equals.\n\nThe other thing was what you wanted counting votes. I wanted everybody on staff to have the ability to talk to Members face-to-face, not the staff-to-staff thing.\n\nWe treated the staff well. In some cases, we or I rankled some of the staff because they thought that they weren't being dealt with at an appropriate level, which was not true, because we dealt with them as equals too. That was probably what rankled them. We talked to the Members because the Members vote. So it was trying to put together a staff that would be organized, disciplined, and independent, and drive the process. Our staff was able to drive the process.\n\nIn July of '01, just before the recess--I can't remember what was going on, but everybody on the Hill was really tired, they didn't want to hear about it. We were pushing TPA [trade promotion authority]. We talked at our staff meeting and I said, \"We can drive this process, we can pick everybody else up and drive it forward.\"\n\nEverybody said we couldn't get it done and we did. It was Legislative Affairs writ large with the Cabinet Assistant Secretaries. We just blanketed everybody and kept at it. We did get it done. Probably the most difficult, interesting, and at the end of the day fun but crazy vote I've ever worked. We did some horse trading on that one. Some of the stories are just unbelievable.\n\nRiley\n\nDon't tease us.\n\nHobbs\n\nWe had Solomon Ortiz's vote.\n\nCalio\n\nIt was difficult because if you went back this time actually to '91 and then called fast track, we had on our target list, I think we had 248 Democrats maybe at the time?\n\nHoward\n\nAbout that, yes.\n\nCalio\n\nWe had 92 Democrats on our target list, legitimate targets to vote for trade promotion authority. We set up ad hoc Whip groups with [Daniel] Rostenkowski and Sam Gibbons and people like that. That's how the House operated. We had probably 15 to 20 Republicans that we had to worry about not might vote for it. In this instance we probably had a group of 45 to 50 Republicans we had to target and work because they didn't like it. When it came to the end of the day we probably had a list of legitimate targets of 20 Democrats. It became clear to the Democrats involved that they were important, so they wanted things. We got that famous bridge down in Texas, which three years after I left the White House I'm still getting calls about, \"Did you really make this promise?\"\n\nHobbs\n\nYou did and we couldn't--the long and short of it is we could never honor it because it violated a U.S. and Mexico treaty that said we couldn't build a bridge to Mexico. The Mexicans had some say in it.\n\nCalio\n\nBecause it is relevant to this particular discussion on getting the votes, the one thing that we did, and I've always tried to do, was stay in touch with not quite everybody but almost everybody and treat everybody with the same amount of respect. Even if you weren't going to be with them or they weren't going to be with you, let them know what was going on. You drop by, it's not one off. The President brings everybody in. We stayed on top of them, always kept visiting them. It paid off on this. Like with Solomon Ortiz and Luis Gutierrez. I was going office to office.\n\nHobbs\n\nRod Blagojevich.\n\nCalio\n\nYes, indeed.\n\nHobbs\n\nYou can see how he ended up in jail.\n\nCalio\n\nHe wanted something big, we didn't get there. I'm going office to office and I'd say yes or no. \"We'll try to do that, let me see what I can do.\" If there is a fairly big ask like [Robert] Marion Berry from Arkansas had first $300 million worth of projects, then it grew to $500 million. Then it was more. But I go see Luis Gutierrez, and he's got a really good education program in Chicago that wasn't going to be funded.\n\nLuis says, \"I appreciate your coming to see me because Dick Gephardt comes in here, he grabs my tie like this and he says, ‘Luis, we need your vote.' I say, ‘I'm worried about this.' He says, ‘We'll look at that' and then nothing ever happens.\" I said, \"How much are you looking for?\" He said, \"Five million dollars.\" You remember the scene in It's a Wonderful Life when there is a run on the savings and loan--\"I need my $217\" and the little old woman says, \"Can I get $17.62?\" Like Jimmy Stewart, I wanted to lean across the counter and kiss him and say thank you.\n\nThat just kept going on. We were horse trading. Dennis Moore wanted a letter that if we didn't get TPA, or this may be the second one, that we would sign the letter saying we'd still go for Worker Adjustment Assistance. I didn't want to say yes to that because I knew it would cause some people heartburn, but at the end of the vote the President was making all these calls to people. I'm on the cell phone with the President. He's calling people. I'm on a hard line in the Rayburn Room, we're getting down to it. Marion Berry is on the phone. He's on the House floor, he says, \"I don't know how much of my project--\" I said, \"We'll give you the projects.\" He said, \"Dick Gephardt just offered me a seat on Appropriations.\" I said, \"He can't give you one; he's not the majority leader.\" See you, Marion.\n\nNancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer were trying to grab Dennis Moore, and I actually had my leg around his leg. I said, \"You've got your letter,\" and he voted yes. The next day the Treasury Department had a heart attack.\n\nHoward\n\nDo you want to talk about Mitch Daniels and his view of all this at the time?\n\nCalio\n\nMitch wasn't real happy. Andy runs the senior staff meeting and Mitch was there every day. You go around the table and Andy says, \"Mitch, what do you have?\" He's looking around, he says, \"I just want to let everybody here know how good I feel about being Nick Calio's banker.\" [laughter] So we won the vote. It was staying in touch with people who really helped us at the end of the day. We had some credibility. We were around when we weren't asking for something and we stayed around. It's the way to do business. I mean this as a clinical statement, not as a partisan, only it is partly critical. If you look at what is going on with the so-called charm offensive right now, how does it take that long to get there?\n\nRiley\n\nThis is President [Barack] Obama going to the Hill.\n\nHoward\n\nThe other thing too, it is kind of implicit what Nick is talking about in terms of assembling the staff. That was the deciding factor for why I went back to the White House, when I saw the quality of the people. I knew Nick, I knew what kind of operation he ran, but I had crossed paths with these guys. I'd known Z on the Senate side. David and I worked together in the House. I knew a bunch of the other people coming in.\n\nI thought, These are high-quality, competent people. I also knew the nature of the personalities. I think we can do this job--do it well--but also have a lot of fun in the process. So that's what convinced me to go back. But I also think--going back to talk about the structure of the White House and the kinds of people we hired. We were also known quantities on the Hill before having gone to the White House.\n\nCalio\n\nYes, that's a good point.\n\nHoward\n\nThere was a level of trust. The Members knew who we were, knew our backgrounds, our capabilities. They felt very comfortable dealing with us, yelling at us, and venting their frustrations. We got a lot of that.\n\nI used to tell the new people coming to Legislative Affairs, \"If you're the kind of personality that can't handle getting yelled at a lot for things you had nothing to do with, then this is probably not the right job for you.\" The real challenge of these kinds of jobs is to take that tension out of the system. Members know that they can vent their spleen. Then when they get to the President--\n\nCalio\n\nI was just going to say--\"You, Calio, you--\" finally you give them something meaning, \"You look good, Mr. President.\"\n\nOjakli\n\nHe just had the briefing paper, again, with the Oval Office--gee.\n\nHoward\n\nWe would have warned the President beforehand that this guy was apoplectic and blah, blah, blah and then he comes out and says, \"He's the nicest guy in the world.\"\n\nOjakli\n\nIt was great. You have this little hum in the back of your head that you could turn on when a Senator would yell at you and give the whole business to the President. \"You tell the President that there is no way I'm going to vote with him, I'm never going to do that.\"\n\nHoward\n\nOne of the challenges is to understand the Members well enough to know when they're yelling at you just to yell at you and they're just mad, or are they really mad.\n\nHobbs\n\nMost of us came from leadership offices. I know later when I was hiring people I always wanted people from leadership offices because they were used to saying no to people other than their own boss. If you were on the floor all day or in the Speaker's office or a leadership office in the Senate, a lot of people--\"Hey, I want this bill on the floor, I want this amendment.\" You'd say, \"Sorry, that doesn't fit the message. No.\" Sometimes they got mad at you, but you were just used to it.\n\nI give Nick great credit. Z and I were talking about this last night. I think there is a level--it's been six years, I knew all these Members on a first-name basis and had done favors for them and ticked off a lot of them too, but you were still a staffer.\n\nThen at the White House--and it didn't take too long--where you realized in many instances because of what Nick alluded to earlier in terms of being in the room and hearing the President say, \"I want this\" and seeing how he said it that you knew. We would hear, \"We're going to do--\" And respond, \"No, you're not.\" Or, \"We're going to do this--\" And we'd say, \"No, the President wants this. I talked to him, he wants it, we're going to get this done.\" That kind of leadership.\n\nI was going to interject at the time, but that type of being involved in the process was also great in the White House because there are a lot of people in this White House, or in any White House, who want to go around saying, \"The President doesn't want that.\" We would say, \"Really? I just left the Oval Office and I heard him say he did.\" And hear, \"Well, uh … uh.\"\n\nHoward\n\nIt's amazing how many people speak with the President's authority.\n\nHobbs\n\nRight. But in terms of that relationship. As he said, you just knew. Frankly, even legislative bodies wanted to be led. Education--Z mentioned it was kind of soft. It was a softer bipartisan issue, but it was really hard in the sense that maybe not as conservative as today, but the House is a conservative body. The leaders didn't want to do No Child Left Behind. But for the fact that we'd had Clinton for eight years and they'd been out in the wilderness and they were so happy that George Bush was now President, they probably never would have accepted and put through No Child Left Behind except at that opportunity. Obviously I think it was good because it was big, bipartisan, and it wasn't a tax cut.\n\nThe Democrats could tell that the conservative Republicans were a little ticked off and a little miffed. I think that helped set up tax cuts in a spirit of bipartisanship. With George Miller and Ted Kennedy and Boehner and others, it was a pretty significant--\n\nRiley\n\nYou were agreeing with this and I'm wondering if we can take No Child Left Behind and do a start-to-finish on it as a way of dealing with some of these issues we're talking about.\n\nCalio\n\nIt was a softer issue, but what struck me in going through some of the old papers was the fissures were there right at the beginning, which I largely ignored. I was floating at the higher level, dealing with Kennedy and Miller and Boehner and such, but the Republican leadership did not like the bill, the conservatives did not like the bill from the start. There were liberal Democrats who didn't like things--and in some cases for the same reasons, just from a different angle.\n\nHoward\n\nYes.\n\nCalio\n\nWe pushed it. To jump forward, the President kept insisting, \"No, this is going to be a bipartisan bill.\" He was going to work with everybody. But the leadership at one point--and I can't remember exactly when it was--requested a meeting with the President and tried to scuttle the bill. So it was the President, the Vice President, me, Andy and then Hastert, DeLay, and Armey. Boehner was late. They were making a very effective attack on the bipartisan nature of the bill, saying, \"We can pass a Republican-only bill. We've got people very unhappy; it's going to be very difficult.\"\n\nThey were starting to make a little progress, so I jumped in and said, \"Mr. President, we've gone bipartisan this far. I think if you turn around people will start questioning your sincerity on a whole range of issues. You have to do this.\" Then John showed up, happily. We were already past the point, the President said he agreed with that. I remember afterward Andy Card saying, \"That was the right thing to do.\"\n\nI said, \"Did you see DeLay? I have a target on my forehead. It won't take three days.\" And, boy, within three days there was some nasty-ass article about me in Roll Call and how arrogant I was. \"Unnamed Republican staffer.\"\n\nHoward\n\nBut it is a good contrast. I don't mean to speak ill of the Obama White House, but there was a profile the other day on the new Legislative Affairs head. I assume it was intended as a puff piece because it was in the Style section, but it is chock-full of quotes from people on the Hill saying, \"We don't recognize this guy, we don't know who he is, what he does, where he comes from.\" I don't see how you do your job with that kind of article out there, that sort of reputation. That goes back to the point Nick was making in terms of bringing people on who are visible and known.\n\nCalio\n\nWhen it came to No Child Left Behind, clearly the President wanted it. He was very articulate about it and the reasons for it. The outreach that he did with Kennedy and Miller, with the conservatives, with the liberals. You go through these briefing papers and you see all the different meetings we had to bring people in. Larger-scale meetings where he talked about education as one of the issues, along with taxes and some of the other things. Just education meetings alone, then the one-on-ones that he had. It made a difference. The issue kept moving forward, and we hit bumps. It was funding because funding was a big issue. So we'd keep going back and Teddy would say, \"Nick, we've got to--\"\n\nI'd say, \"We're not going to do that, we're not going that far. We can't do that; we won't be able to get the votes. You're in the Senate, you're a Democrat, we've got all these Republicans. We couldn't do it.\"\n\nWe'd walk out of the room and he'd grab somebody and say, \"Nick just agreed to $19 billion, I think we're there.\" So we'd settle on a number like $3.5 or something and then the next conversation he'd pick up the phone, he's so good, he'd say, \"So we're starting at $4.6.\" Then things got bumpy for a while and almost went into a deep sleep for a couple of months because of other issues, September 11. Then we picked it up and it all worked. That was a really good experience. It couldn't have been done without Kennedy and without George and Boehner. Everybody toed the line in terms of trying to drive to a conclusion on it.\n\nIt was a good example of how to operate where you're going to take votes from both sides and realize you're going to give up some number of votes within your party. That's the way we started, that's the way we kept it. At some point we ought to talk about the policy apparatus in the White House and the way that was structured because that was, I think, the success. That is what underlay the success of the first two years and so many things we did because it was a very consistent process. Everybody had their say. And that's also why you never saw any leaks.\n\nHoward\n\nThe other thing I just want to mention on that, I think Z alluded to, goes to the point about the contrast with Bush 41. One of the first things that 43 did was sit down with the entire Legislative Affairs staff in the Roosevelt Room, and he ran through his agenda. We got a real sense of his personality. Most of us hadn't had much dealing with him. I came away thinking, Wow, this guy is sharp. He's on the ball, he knows what he wants, he knows how to get there. I had no frame of reference whatsoever. He is very shrewd in the sense that he also wanted to know about us.\n\nI think he knew that a good chunk of the success of his Presidency hinged on us. So I think he wanted some sense of confidence that we knew what we were doing, who we were, our backgrounds, things like that. We never had any meeting like that with 41.\n\nOjakli\n\nIt's interesting because now that I've seen life in corporate America, when I look back on that meeting I see a CEO [chief executive officer] who set clear goals and clear objectives, and, \"Here are your marching orders, go do it. And I want to understand you too.\"\n\nHoward\n\nRight.\n\nOjakli\n\n\"Because I've got a lot riding on this. Go, I empower you.\"\n\nCalio\n\nThat's exactly right. We knew. \"Here are the goals, the objectives, here is the point I want to get to.\" Then it was up to us to create the strategy and figure out how to execute it.\n\nHoward\n\nAnd it is one thing to read about him or watch him on TV, it's another thing entirely to be in a room, not a whole lot bigger than this, with the sheer force of his personality. It was pretty clear, not in an offensive way, but very determined.\n\nRiley\n\nDo you recall in that setting any discussion of partisanship or bipartisanship, or was that in the realm of things that he was going to leave to you, you figure out how to get the votes that you need?\n\nCalio\n\nNo, I think in setting objectives his clear goal was to take Washington by storm in the sense of reaching out and trying to be bipartisan.\n\nOjakli\n\nYes.\n\nCalio\n\nIt worked, in some cases it frayed around the edges. You could have the leadership on both sides wanting to do it and the rank and file, and it was a very different Congress then from what it is now, but the rank and file would start to pick around at the edges. We talk about 9/11, that's the best object example of what happens when you try to be bipartisan on a consistent basis and do things the right way because it was the rank and file that actually started to cause--after that three-week garden period--\n\nHoward\n\nIn the early months there was a conscious--it surfaced in all the internal meetings we had with the other White House staff. The President had a good working relationship with Bob Bullock in Texas, he was the Lieutenant Governor. Bob was somebody he could trust and deal with and get things done. There was a lot of discussion internally in the White House, \"We need to find that kind of person.\"\n\nThat's why he started working with Kennedy. Some of us would say, \"Ted Kennedy is not quite Bob Bullock, but we get the idea.\" There was a real conscious effort, up until 9/11, to try to find who is that Democratic dealmaker out there that I can work with?\n\nCalio\n\nWe put together these lunches and breakfasts once a month where we'd have the top two leaders, the Vice President, the President, me, sometimes but rarely Andy, just to talk about the issues.\n\nWhat Jack was talking about before, how shrewd he was and the force of his personality. I can't tell you the number of times I'd have people come out of a small meeting with him, including people who didn't like him, who'd say, \"God, he is really smart, and he's funny. He's really funny.\"\n\nHoward\n\nAnd engaged. That was the other, it's interesting, it just popped into my head.\n\nHobbs\n\nThe press portrayed this image that he underpromised and overperformed. I think based on that--you don't go to Harvard and Yale, be Governor--but it was also he'd talk to you about sports or your kids. I think they could tell he really cared.\n\nHoward\n\nYes, but I remember the difference in 41 when we'd have Members down in the Cabinet Room, leadership meetings, pretty much the way they went the President would make a few opening remarks and everybody would go around the room and make their speeches.\n\nThe first couple of meetings we had with 43 were much different. He would make a few opening remarks, and the Members thinking, This is the way it used to be, would give their remarks only to find out the President would challenge them. If some Member would say something about one thing or another he'd get into it with him. You could tell by their body language, \"Whoa, we're not used to this. There is somebody actually listening to what we have to say and challenging us on a lot of these points.\"\n\nSo he early on created the impression that, number one, he's very smart, on top of his game, and willing to engage with Members directly and take them on.\n\nHobbs\n\nAnd he was on time. After the Clinton years, we were always so late. We'd call a meeting at 9:15, we wouldn't even leave until 9:15 because we knew we were going to be kept waiting. When Bush calls a meeting at 9:00 and everybody shows up at 9:10, the meeting started at 8:50.\n\nCalio\n\nWe're sitting in the Oval Office; the briefing is done five minutes early. He says, \"Let's go.\" I said, \"Mr. President, it's not nine o'clock yet.\" He said, \"Fine, fine.\" Then I've got people in the outer office and in the hallways doing this relay--\"Is everybody here?\" and people weren't there. He said, \"It's three minutes after nine. Let's go.\"\n\nHoward\n\nAnd he was not happy.\n\nCalio\n\nSo we went. The Members came in, the meeting started. He said, \"They won't be late again.\" REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT EDTEXTREDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT REDACTEDTEXT\n\nHoward\n\nTo David's point, meetings never started late. If anything they started early.\n\nCalio\n\nYou learned you had to be there.\n\nHoward\n\nParticularly for the staff preparation work. You didn't have the luxury of thinking, I've got until 9:30 to get this done. You knew there was a chance that you'd get a call saying, \"OK, the President is ready\" 20 minutes early.\n\nOjakli\n\nAnd the door might be locked.\n\nHoward\n\n\"Come on in.\" You'd go and--\n\nRiley\n\nThe door might be locked?\n\nCalio\n\nWorking on the briefing memo or whatever. He locked Colin Powell out once. He did. He said, \"Lock the door, lock the door.\" Everybody is sitting there and you hear this [fiddles with doorknob] and it's the Secretary of State. You don't keep the boss waiting.\n\nNelson\n\nSomething I wonder about. Here you have a Vice President who had been a leader of his party in the House and a White House Chief of Staff and who is known to take an interest in a lot of things. What was his role in any of the things we've been talking about up to and including the most effective way to relate to Congress?\n\nCalio\n\nThat's a big sweeper.\n\nRiley\n\nThink about it, I owe you a break.\n\nHoward\n\nStart with how you put the staff together, in terms of integrating the Vice President's staff.\n\nCalio\n\nRemind me to start there because it all flows from there.\n\n[BREAK]\n\nCalio\n\nI don't think I ever finished the story about you, Z.\n\nOjakli\n\nWhich one?\n\nCalio\n\nThe day you came on staff because Z and Candi Wolff were doing a lot of things together. So the Vice President, Z, and I were at this Republican retreat. The Vice President pulls me out in the hallway and says, \"So you're staffing up, I'm staffing up. I hear you might be interested in Z and Candi. Who do you want?\" I said both. He said, \"No, you get one.\"\n\nI said, \"I'll take Z.\" So I got Z but the Vice President and I had talked. I had known him 20 years maybe. A lot of people asked me when I took the job, and a lot of people speculated not just to me but in the press, \"The Vice President is going to run Legislative Affairs, he'll be on the Hill all the time. They'll have no control.\" I'm not going to say we had strict ground rules, but we had ground rules. He wasn't interested in being a Legislative Affairs staffer by any stretch. I think there have been some articles that talk about his influence over the President that were totally sourced by his own staff, at that point current and former, which were just BS [bullshit] because the relationship was very clear.\n\nThe way it operated, first of all in terms of our staffing, Candi then became the head of Legislative Affairs for the Vice President.\n\nOjakli\n\nNancy [Dorn].\n\nCalio\n\nYes, Nancy Dorn, then Candi went to work for Nancy.\n\nOjakli\n\nAs the Senate Deputy for the Vice President.\n\nCalio\n\nBut we operated as a single staff, and the Vice President's staff came to our staff meeting in the morning, asked that each one of the offices, CEQ [Council on Environmental Quality], National Security Council, all their Legislative Affairs people essentially reported up through the White House Office of Legislative Affairs.\n\nHoward\n\nAnd it wasn't just staff meetings either. Nancy would come over to our offices all the time in the West Wing. We'd see her, she'd see us. It was about as integrated a staff as you could get. Going back to the contrast with 41, we knew Dan Quayle's legislative people, but what they were doing? We never had any idea what they were up to.\n\nOjakli\n\nAlso Candi was the Vice President's Deputy Assistant for Legislative Affairs in the Senate. The Vice President had an office in the Senate, and we would work out of the Vice President's office there. It was very seamless. We worked hand in hand with the Vice President's people.\n\nCalio\n\nThe other way it operated with the Vice President was--and this was part of the policy process that I mentioned earlier--everything was seamless because it was made clear that we were all one staff. We were integrated. We would all be pointed in the same direction at all times. The policy process was concocted by Andy and Josh, and I think probably largely Josh, but there were a certain number of people around the table right from the start of every decision-making process. That was the President, the Vice President--when we reported in.\n\nAt one of those meetings you'd have the President, the Vice President. There would be, depending on the issue Margaret [Spellings], Larry, Karl, Karen, later Dan, me, Scooter [I. Lewis] Libby usually. You had the same group. Then you would expand the group as the decision-making process moved on. Everybody had their say, but throughout that it was always clear. The President is the President, the Vice President is the Vice President. He was very deferential. They talked in private. They had a very give-and-take relationship. I think that the notion somehow that [Richard] Cheney ran the Presidency is totally out of sync with the facts.\n\nHoward\n\nAll you had to do was be in the same room with them when the two of them were together, and it was very clear who was President.\n\nHobbs\n\nI totally concur with that. I think Cheney was very loyal.\n\nCalio\n\nVery loyal.\n\nHobbs\n\nThere were difficult issues and on issues that maybe he disagreed with he was still ultimately the good soldier. Later in intelligence reform and some things where he had very strong feelings that were opposite the President's, he still toed the line.\n\nHoward\n\nHe was a real asset for us in Legislative Affairs.\n\nCalio\n\nI was just going to say that. People would say, \"Aren't you worried?\" I'd say, \"Are you kidding? Given his background, I've got a good relationship with him. He's a huge resource.\" We used him very well.\n\nThat's the other thing. People say, \"Why would you take the job? You only have a six-vote margin in the House, it's a 50-50 Senate.\" Where I came from the last time, we had 158 Republicans in the House and 43 in the Senate. This is a dream.\n\nHoward\n\nCheney was very cognizant of that too. He did not want to interfere in a lot of Legislative Affairs.\n\nKnott\n\nThis perception that Cheney perhaps did have inordinate influence on the President you believe was fed in part by the Vice President's staff?\n\nCalio\n\nYes, and if you know Dick it would never have been fed by him.\n\nHoward\n\nNo.\n\nCalio\n\nWhenever we were doing something he would always tell me what he was doing, where he was going. Particularly if he was going to the Hill, like for policy lunches. He would report back on what was going on. It was very collaborative. We'd tell him what we needed, where we needed him--which we did a lot, particularly that early part because we had to have him in the chair in the Senate on 50-50 votes. It was a very good relationship. He, particularly early on, given his background and given the fact that he was one of those people Jack talked about, the meetings and Bush 41 people would go around, everybody would say everything. The number of times I heard a Member say, \"Everybody has already said what I'm going to say, so I'll be brief,\" and then they'd go through the whole thing. The only time I ever saw something different was when we had this meeting and people were going around the table, and the President says to Cheney, when he was the House Whip, \"Dick, what do you have to say?\" He said, \"Nothing, already been said.\" Really?\n\nHoward\n\nHe was very secure in himself and his role.\n\nHobbs\n\nI also want to point out that obviously it was the leader of the Senate, on tie votes, but they gave him an office, H208, right off the floor on the House side, the old Ways and Means office. He was there a lot. He was always an asset and always part of the team.\n\nNelson\n\nIf staffers leak stories saying the Vice President is really running the show once, that's one thing. If it happens twice, then the Vice President is tolerating it, right? Did you have a feeling that the Vice President is enabling his staff people to go out and give a false impression of how things really work?\n\nCalio\n\nI may be stupid, but I did not think so. I think it also says something about the President, who would just shrug it off. It wasn't reality and he didn't care about that kind of stuff. He would tell you he didn't read the paper, which I don't think was true. But he just didn't care. They had a very good relationship. Cheney was a resource and he was used as such. He had great experience. Very deferential. Sometimes he would disagree, but that's the thing about all those meetings I was referring to. We would have very vigorous discussions about it, but it was always the President's call which way we went on something, always at the end of the day. Everybody toed the line whether you agreed or disagreed.\n\nOjakli\n\nI think it's also the laziness of the press corps. It's like the myths of George Bush. They just keep repeating it. There's probably a shrug of the shoulders from the Vice President as there was a shrug of the shoulders, I'm sure, from the President on some of the stuff that was said about him. This stuff just keeps winding its way back and back and nobody cares to correct it.\n\nRiley\n\nWas there any way in which the Vice President's experience on the Hill miscued him or was dated because there had been a fair amount of churning in the interval since he had left the Hill?\n\nHobbs\n\nNo, he was a conservative. It's not like it is today where there are 355 Members with districts with PDIs [reports from Political Data Inc.] of plus five or greater. Republicans have always been dominated by conservatives and the Democrats by liberals. So he came out of that. The dynamic doesn't change much. The personalities do. I think he was very comfortable even if he didn't know all the freshmen and things like that.\n\nHoward\n\nThey knew him.\n\nRiley\n\nOf course.\n\nHoward\n\nHe was able to use that reputation to his advantage.\n\nCalio\n\nHe would give Members their deference. That's their call. We talk about taxes, we can talk about one situation where it cost us part of the tax cut maybe because he wanted to give the Senators their head and the Senators got their head, but then they didn't produce necessarily. So all in all, the Cheney thing was a real positive from our point of view. There are those myths that have built, like Shirley Anne Warshaw, whom I'm sure you know--\n\nRiley\n\nGettysburg.\n\nHoward\n\nFor hours I tried to talk her out of her--\n\nCalio\n\n\"Why would Condi have told me this? Shirley, think about it.\" My daughter went to Gettysburg so I got to know Shirley. We couldn't talk her out of it to save our lives.\n\nHoward\n\nShe was going to write her book come hell or high water. I kept trying to tell her, \"Shirley, this is just not right.\"\n\nRiley\n\nStanford published it.\n\nHoward\n\nShe was convinced--\n\nCalio\n\nI know. I have a lot of respect--she wanted me to give a quote, I said, \"I can't do this.\"\n\nHoward\n\nDavid Addington basically ran not only Cheney's operation but the entire West Wing. It was the whole controversy over signing statements and things like that. Shirley was all worked up over signing statements, how David Addington writes these signing statements that basically have the effect of negating anything Congress wants to do. David Addington has a clear field; he can do whatever he wants. I said, \"Shirley, those things came across my desk all the time. I made changes, I edited them. Some were OK. It wasn't like he was out there by himself.\" But, no, she was convinced that David Addington and Dick Cheney were the Rasputins running the whole place.\n\nHoward\n\nBased on what we could never figure out.\n\nRiley\n\nNick, you did make an interesting comment about the Vice President recognizing the prerogatives of the Members. The general perception out there, particularly when you start thinking about Addington and this theory of the unitary executive and the notion that--and most of this admittedly is post-9/11, or the success of it is post-9/11, but your characterization is fascinating because it is at odds with this external perception of the Vice President's role as somebody who was constantly trying to push the limits of Presidential power.\n\nCalio\n\nThat he was.\n\nHoward\n\nYes, he was.\n\nCalio\n\nThose are two different things.\n\nRiley\n\nOK, tell me.\n\nCalio\n\nI think that, pretty clearly, I don't know what he said when he came back, if you guys haven't seen this picture.\n\nRiley\n\nHe didn't say anything. We had a nice lunch and talked shop but nothing about the 43rd Presidency.\n\nCalio\n\nHis view of the executive branch power once he got out of the legislative branch was that it needed to be expanded. But the President himself had very distinct views about the nature of Executive power versus legislative power and the constitutional tension between the two. The President thought that the pendulum had swung back way too far to the Congress and was committed to recapturing Executive power and Executive prerogatives.\n\nNelson\n\nBefore we leave No Child Left Behind I want to ask you a broader question. That's an area that he had worked on a lot as Governor of Texas and had worked with the Texas legislature across the aisle. That seemed to translate pretty well into his Presidency. Were there things about being Governor of Texas and dealing with that kind of legislature that turned out to be the source of misperceptions when he was President? Thinking he knew how to deal with the legislature and maybe finding out through experience that it was different with a legislature like Congress.\n\nCalio\n\nI think it was a process. I don't think it ever fueled anything. He knew it was different. I think he would have liked to believe it could be that way. You start with one issue and build up on another issue and you'd have this trust and it would be like the old days. You could disagree all day but then you could go out and get a drink at night. When I say it was part of a process, it became clear over time that it just wasn't going to work that way. You had too many different Members to deal with. The ingrained partisanship going back to the [James C., Jr.] Wright Speakership, building on Republicans, Democrats, alike.\n\nHoward\n\nIt was also the bitter nature of the election itself.\n\nCalio\n\nIt was too much.\n\nHoward\n\nFor the better part of the first part of the first year, he was trying to find who is that Bob Bullock on the other side of the aisle that I can actually work with? We ran through a whole list of candidates and with the passage of time and evolution he came to the conclusion that this is just a different--\n\nCalio\n\nDifferent model.\n\nRiley\n\nYou mentioned Kennedy. Who else was contemplated as maybe being the Bullock?\n\nCalio\n\n[John] Breaux, and Breaux was great, he was our go-to guy. Particularly with the combination of Breaux and Lott we were able to get a lot of stuff done. Breaux had great influence over the other Democratic moderates. Both he and Trent Lott know how to cut a deal.\n\nHobbs\n\nAlso the Lieutenant Governor position in Texas has more power in many respects than the Governor has. If you don't have it you should get the story on background of how Bush and Bullock came together and have that color. Ted Kennedy was powerful because when you cut a deal with Ted Kennedy you have the Democrats, and nobody could impeach him. Bullock just had more institutional power to decide what was going to move and what wasn't. It wasn't necessarily philosophical. Different legislatures, institutions, and dynamics at work. But like Nick said, I think he probably would have liked to have it, but it just doesn't--they're different. I think he knew that from his father's Presidency.\n\nCalio\n\nAnd the target field was larger. It is relevant to everything we did because with all that outreach that I keep referring to, we had our target lists going before we took office of who--and it was a broad target list of people we could potentially work with on various issues. Knowing we couldn't get them on each issue, but it included Dianne Feinstein and Evan Bayh.\n\nOjakli\n\nThen there was Zell Miller. People who clicked with him personality-wise. Zell Miller loved his personality, loved his decisiveness, and was a fellow former Governor. He was the one who helped deliver the tax cut, for example.\n\nCalio\n\nYes, so it was Miller and Breaux and Ben Nelson. The President spent a lot of time reaching out to them, had Breaux to dinner more than once. Between us we lived in those offices, and they would say so too. We were all, between [Max] Baucus and Nelson and Breaux and some of the other people we were like plants, just kept showing up.\n\nOjakli\n\nIdentified in pictures as \"staffer.\" Nelson's staffer.\n\nCalio\n\nYes, that did happen once.\n\nRiley\n\nFor Z or for you?\n\nOjakli\n\nFor me.\n\nPerry\n\nGo back to the quote that is so interesting from the President about spending capital to get capital. Can you define the spending of capital? Define the capital that is in that sentence?\n\nHobbs\n\nHis view was that you think big things and you have big aspirations and you go out and achieve them, and then by achieving them you gain more capital.\n\nPerry\n\nBut what do you spend? What is the currency that you're spending? Some of it you explained, when you said the fellows said, \"I need $5 million for my--\"\n\nCalio\n\nThat's a minor part, that's not what I'm talking about.\n\nPerry\n\nWhat else?\n\nHobbs\n\nIt wasn't the spending, it was like you get something done and then you have capital; now you spend that capital, that good will, that achievement, that accomplishment. From the press, to the Members and others. Now you use that and invest it in another initiative.\n\nOjakli\n\nYou don't waste it on small ball. You take it and go to the next big initiative.\n\nCalio\n\nI think Barbara is talking one step back. I think the capital that you spend--\n\nPerry\n\nAt the outset.\n\nCalio\n\nAt the outset is your stature, your good will. You're willing to put yourself out there to define the issue and fight to get it.\n\nOjakli\n\nFrom the beginning.\n\nCalio\n\nFrom the beginning.\n\nOjakli\n\nYour reservoir.\n\nCalio\n\nOne of the toughest things in any of these jobs is you've got your plan, your strategy, you go for it. Then inevitably, because it is such a big Congress and there are so many diverse people, somebody comes back and whacks you on something. I automatically start thinking votes and maybe we should look at this and look at that. He wasn't like that. He would just say, \"No, for right now we're here.\" He'd go back at people and discuss it with them and argue with them, but he would put himself out there all the time. The theory was, if we won, then people would have more respect for the Presidency and for him and then we're going to move on and get this issue done.\n\nHoward\n\nAnd part of that was what did he say about polls? He didn't even care about polls, snapshot polls, which is in contrast to the Clinton White House where apparently everything was decided by polls. He took the long view on a lot of those things and figured the polls eventually would come around. But for the moment he wasn't going to make strategic decisions based on what the latest poll says.\n\nHobbs\n\nAnd he wasn't afraid to be bold. I remember the tax cuts in 2003, and it was, what is he going to announce? A rare leak that said something like, \"He's going to ask for dividends relief and it's going to cost $350 billion.\" I remember some policy time he would kind of bristle and he said, \"I haven't made up my mind.\" A few days later he came out with a plan that cost double that. It was like, \"Screw you.\"\n\nCalio\n\nHe went out of his way--\n\nHobbs\n\n\"If you think you guys are going to define what I'm going to do, you're not. We're going to ask for it all.\" Whereas the meeting is, \"We have this much money, it spins out this way, what can we afford, how do you get the most bang for the buck in terms of growing the economy?\" And then whoever leaks it out, somebody trying to get an outcome, and he's like, \"Oh, yeah?\"\n\nHobbs\n\n\"I'll show you.\"\n\nHoward\n\n\"I'll show you; we're going to do everything on the list.\"\n\nCalio\n\nLeak that!\n\nNelson\n\nI remember him being quoted as saying during the initial tax cut, \"I'm not going to compromise with myself.\"\n\nHoward\n\nYes, I heard that a lot.\n\nNelson\n\nCan you say more about that?\n\nCalio\n\nIt goes back to that first conversation I had with him in Austin where he leaned across the table and said, \"No, we're not going to argue with ourselves, we're not going to compromise. We're going to keep saying 1.6, 1.6.\" At one point in the process I was able to get agreement that we were going to go to 1.375 with enough Democrats that it would have worked. The President said, \"You think it's too early?\" I said, \"No, I don't think it's too early. I'm not sure we'd get any better from this.\"\n\nCheney was there and the Vice President said, \"What do our Members say?\" I said, \"Candidly, they're not convinced that we can't get more, but we're coming up on Easter and I'm not sure where the time is going to be or where they see the movement coming from. I would take this deal now. We lock in 1.375, maybe there's some way to get it more.\" The President just looked at me and said, \"I think we've probably got to go with our horses up there for now.\" As I'm walking out he said, \"Nicky,\" I turned around and he said, \"Don't wobble, 1.6.\" I said, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nNelson\n\nYou ended up with 1.35.\n\nCalio\n\nYes, but not until the Easter recess break where all of our allies who said we'd get more than 1.375, and things were kind of dribbling along and then the jet fumes started to take over and we're sitting in the Vice President's office and either Phil [William] Gramm or Don Nickles stuck his head in and said, \"We've got 1.1!\"\n\nHoward\n\nAnd they think that's a good deal.\n\nCalio\n\nOK, you've got them out of town. This is after we refused the 1.375, the numbers started going backward. We only got to 1.35, what was it, $250 billion I think we came up with.\n\nHoward\n\nRebate?\n\nCalio\n\nNo, we cooked it up with Breaux.\n\nHoward\n\nYes.\n\nCalio\n\nBut there was $250 billion we tacked back onto the 1.1 later that got it up to 1.35. Anyway it was a good thing. With just sticking to the 1.6 and not compromising with ourselves, as he put it--we were talking about this last night, in going through the papers you see the development where all of a sudden you've got a Democratic plan that's $400 billion so you know you've got a tax cut of at least $400 billion. Then it goes to $600 billion, then it goes to $800 billion. We're all sitting around going, \"This is getting better and better. We've already won.\"\n\nHobbs\n\nHe wasn't afraid to compromise; he just had a sense that he wasn't going to do it early.\n\nHoward\n\nRight.\n\nHobbs\n\nSurprisingly, in a lot of negotiations on the Hill people do compromise too early.\n\nCalio\n\nThat's a good point.\n\nHobbs\n\nIt's kind of I've got to get home, they want to get out of town and there are various elements. I think the President, again, was never afraid to compromise to win 60, 80, 90 percent. But you just don't do that early. There's a time to do it and now is not the time.\n\nHoward\n\nPart of that falls to the function of the Legislative Affairs operation because you will get a lot of Members, Senators, who want to cave early because they think they get as good a deal as they can get. So part of the challenge is to push back on them and tell them, \"No, you have to hold out for 1.6\" or whatever it is. Then when the time is right, you compromise. But if you do it too early--\n\nCalio\n\nAnd telling them no or pushing back in the right way, which was a constant struggle. Personally I also spent a lot of time with the moderates. When the President told me, which I mentioned before, he said, \"People are going to get pissed off at you and us.\" He was right because they did. Without going into names, some of them were just not happy. You talk about getting yelled at and having to take it. There were some who made a specialty of it for weeks at a time because they were unhappy with the position they were being put in. We could have accepted less and maybe we could add this much money for this program or that program that would take away from the tax cut.\n\nHoward\n\nI think there are still Members mad at us from stuff we did in Bush 41.\n\nCalio\n\nMinimum wage.\n\nKnott\n\nJack, you mentioned earlier that Bush 43 was determined not to have a strong Chief of Staff. That he had seen the Sununu example as some kind of warning.\n\nHoward\n\nYes.\n\nKnott\n\nCould you talk a little bit about Andy Card's attributes and weaknesses? In other words, what was Andy Card's portfolio?\n\nCalio\n\nAndy's portfolio was everything. If I can make the distinction, I don't think it was that the President didn't want--Jack included \"visible\" in his description. He didn't want somebody who was going to be the center of attention or detract from what you were trying to accomplish. If you know Andy, he is the ultimate loyalist, team player. He is very smart about people. Andy took on a lot of difficult jobs in terms of organizing and getting things done, but also in terms of being the bearer of bad tidings, which you never want to have to be on a consistent basis. But it is not the President's job, so the Chief of Staff would deliver bad news to people on a lot of different occasions.\n\nHobbs\n\nHe was strong. Look, you had Karl and Karen coming in.\n\nHoward\n\nYes.\n\nHobbs\n\nI don't think Jack was intimating that he was somehow weak.\n\nHoward\n\nNo, not at all.\n\nHobbs\n\nBush put him there because he wanted Karl and Karen and others to be involved but they weren't Chief of Staff.\n\nHoward\n\nUltimately Andy was through and through a Bush family loyalist.\n\nCalio\n\nHe ran the staff. If people were getting out of line, he'd yank them back in no uncertain terms in his own fashion. He made sure that everybody was cooperating and pulling together, but that worked naturally because we all liked each other. It was the best two years of my life professionally. We had so much fun on that staff, we laughed like crazy at senior staff meetings, in with the President who--most people will never get to understand or know his sense of humor, but from the sublime to the ridiculous in terms of his sense of humor. I was trying to brief him once and he wasn't taking me very seriously. I'm standing in front of his desk. He's got a bottle cap like this, he's putting it in his eye, looking at me like--I wouldn't laugh. He just kept it up. His wit is like this.\n\nAndy was very good about that in terms of making sure that the staff was operating the right way, that people were serving the President, that people got in. Andy himself was very accessible. Based on his vast experience he knew when people had to get to see the President and when the President needed to hear something directly. It was an open White House to begin with because that's what the President wanted, but I think Andy helped make it more so. We could get Andy anytime, anywhere.\n\nThis is a good example of how we did operate. A Member would call. They'd always rather talk to the Chief of Staff or the Vice President than the head of Legislative Affairs, let's be honest, if they can. They'd call and Andy's first words would be, \"Have you talked to Nick yet?\" or \"Have you talked to Z or have you talked to David?\" That would kind of put Members back. The Vice President was up and getting a lot of information on his own, but he was like that too. The President appointed me and Mark Weinberg from Treasury as the two leads on the tax bill, which really rankled Bill Thomas because he didn't think--I had a good relationship with him, Mark had an even better one, but he was now chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Basically, we're two piddly staffers who are going to be negotiating the tax bill for the White House.\n\nAt one point he insisted on a meeting. He wanted Cheney there. So we go to this meeting in Lott's little back office. Before Thomas can even say a word Cheney said, yes, he was here, he can only stay a short time and as long as everybody understood that Nick and Mark were going to be handling this, the President has full confidence in them, they speak for the President and he can't get involved in this. This is what the President decided. Is there any kind of problem with that? That was the end of the meeting. We started talking about issues and the tax bill.\n\nHoward\n\nBut Andy, just by the way he did his job, inspired a lot of loyalty among the staff too. He made you feel like you wanted to go the extra mile for him. He was lower key than Sununu was--\n\nOjakli\n\nHe has no ego.\n\nHoward\n\nRight, he wasn't on the Sunday shows, he wasn't trying to make all the decisions in the White House, he wasn't imposing his will on people, he was very collegial. As Nick alluded to, he didn't force the rules, we were going to be inclusive.\n\nOjakli\n\nIt wasn't uncommon to come back to your chair at night and find a note card on your seat from Andy saying, \"Congratulations on this victory. I know you've worked hard these last couple of weeks. Just a special thanks.\" You're thinking, My gosh, where does he find the time? Here is a guy who comes in at four o'clock in the morning and leaves at eleven o'clock. Those little niceties were a hallmark of Andy.\n\nCalio\n\nHe and the President were a lot alike in that way. After the tax bill vote the President called me up and said, \"Nicky, round up your troops and bring them all in.\"\n\nHoward\n\nI remember that.\n\nCalio\n\n\"Bring them into the Oval, we have to meet.\" We rounded everybody up.
