        "text": "Tracy Johnson and Elizabeth Fee\n\nNearly a decade before women's exclusion from clinical research became an issue of public scrutiny and political debate, a 1981 article documented women's underrepresentation in drug trials. The article observed that conservative Food and Drug Administration (FDA) policies which discouraged the inclusion of women of ''childbearing potential'' in early drug trials led to their widespread exclusion in later, Phase III testing.1 That the article stirred so little response reflects the relative consensus at the time among researchers and federal policymakers vis a vis protectionist policies governing research on women.\n\nIn contrast, the findings of the General Accounting Office (GAO) in 1990 met with public outcry and congressional action in the form of the Women's Health Equity Act.2 This GAO report documented that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) had made \"little progress\" toward implementing its 1986 policy encouraging the inclusion of women as subjects in clinical research.3 Although NIH's records retention methods render any attempt to quantify the extent of women's exclusion difficult, press coverage has focused attention on several large-scale clinical trials with all-male study populations, e.g., the Physicians' Health Study4 and Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (aptly abbreviated as MR. FIT).5 The mobilization of congressional women, women in the health professions, and women's advocacy organizations around this issue marks a shift in both public opinion and policy development.\n\nConclusion\n\nMuch as the 1970s' women's liberation movement incorporated themes of the civil rights movement, women's health advocates of the 1990s borrowed the concept of a consumer-driven research agenda from AIDS activists. Both movements have focused constructive attention on the research process. However, the challenge remains to define a policy which will minimize risks and yet allow productive research for men, women, and children. It is clear that the protectionist tradition will no longer continue unchallenged, and that women are demanding input in the evaluation of relative risks and benefits inherent in research activities. Beyond mere inclusion, women insist that their diverse health concerns should inform the formulation of the hypotheses, design, and implementation of federally funded research activities."
