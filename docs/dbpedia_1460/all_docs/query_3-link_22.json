He is the coauthor of the 2024 book, How Government Built America, which presents a novel history of America from the colonial period to the present and establishes government as an essential partner with the market system in building the country. He is also the coauthor of Administrative Competence: Reimagining Administrative Law (2020) and Achieving Democracy: The Future of Progressive Regulation (2014), and has written or co-written eight other books, eight book chapters, and over fifty-five articles.
