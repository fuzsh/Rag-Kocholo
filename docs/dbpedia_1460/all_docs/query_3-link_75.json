        "text": "When, and under what circumstances, are congressional minority parties capable of influencing legislative outcomes? This question is in need of further investigation for at least two reasons.\n\nFirst, we know that minority parties sometimes exercise significant influence over legislative outcomes, but we lack robust explanations for when, why, or how. For example, despite unified Republican control of the White House and Congress in 2018, the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending package enacted that March not only needed Democratic votes to pass but also contained numerous Democratic Party priorities—including significant investments in child care programs, health care funding, election security, and more. As White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney put it, “we had to give away a lot of stuff that we didn’t want to give away.”Footnote 1 On final passage, the bill had as much Democratic (60% of the caucus) as Republican (62%) support in the House and more support from Democrats (39) than Republicans (25) in the Senate.Footnote 2\n\nSeveral empirical findings underscore the often unexpected influence of minority parties: Majorities frequently need minority party support to pass major legislation (Curry and Lee Reference Curry and Lee2020) and minority party support for a bill in committee is predictive of its legislative success (Ryan Reference Ryan2020). House minority parties shape the issue attentions of the majority party (Hughes Reference Hughes2018) as well as the floor roll-call record (Egar Reference Egar2016). Majority parties are often unable to control the House floor agenda (Ballard and Curry Reference Ballard and Curry2020), and there are virtually no differences between the negative agenda-setting powers exercised by House and Senate majority parties, despite far more favorable rules in the House (Ballard Reference Ballard and Curry2021; Gailmard and Jenkins Reference Gailmard and Jenkins2007; Reference Gailmard, Jenkins, Monroe, Roberts and Rohde2008). Meaningful minority party influence is not a rare occurrence.\n\nSecond, the nature of the American constitutional system compels us to better understand the influence of minority parties. The founders placed an emphasis on minority rights when designing the U.S. Constitution. While they were not thinking of minority parties, they nevertheless set up a governmental system that was intended to frustrate majorities (Hamilton, Madison, and Jay Reference Hamilton, Madison and Jay2003). Today, the American hybrid system is as much consensus based as it is majoritarian (Dahl Reference Dahl2003; Lijphart Reference Lijphart2012), and it frequently hinders the policy ambitions of majority parties (Carey Reference Carey2007; Curry and Lee Reference Curry and Lee2020; Mayhew Reference Mayhew2005; Samuels and Shugart Reference Samuels and Shugart2010; Shugart and Carey Reference Shugart and Carey1992).\n\nDespite these compelling reasons, scholars and observers of Congress offer no consistent explanations for minority party influence. Observers often chalk up minority influence to failures on the part of the majority or the majority leadership.Footnote 3 Scholars have focused overwhelmingly on understanding majority party power (e.g., Aldrich and Rohde Reference Aldrich, Rohde, Bond and Fleisher2000; Cox and McCubbins Reference Cox and McCubbins2005; Curry Reference Curry2015; Monroe and Robinson Reference Monroe and Robinson2008; Roberts Reference Roberts2005; Roberts and Smith Reference Roberts and Smith2003; Rohde Reference Rohde1991). Left relatively underexplained are the underpinnings of minority party influence. As a result, examples of minority party influence like those noted above are not well explained by prominent theories of party power.\n\nHere, we develop a theory of minority party capacity for legislative influence. By capacity, we mean the ability to influence legislative outcomes. We argue that the capacity of minority parties is a function of three factors: (1) constraints on the majority party, which create opportunities for the minority; (2) minority party cohesion on the issue at hand; and (3) motivations for the minority to engage in legislating rather than electioneering. As these factors increase and align, a minority party’s capacity increases."
