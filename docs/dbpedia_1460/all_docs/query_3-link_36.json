        "text": "II.A. The Narrow Interpretation of ‘Genetic Information’\n\nPoore v Peterbilt Bristol, L.L.C., which was decided in 2012, was the first published case to address the question of whether medical information, other than information about an individual's manifested condition, constitutes genetic information under GINA. The employee, Mark Poore, worked for Peterbilt of Bristol, L.L.C. (‘Peterbilt’), which provided health insurance for Poore and his family. In responding to his employer's ‘health insurance questionnaire regarding his family's general medical conditions and medications’,66 Poore indicated that his wife had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Three days later, despite ‘no complaints about [his] work performance’, Poore was terminated from his position ‘without sufficient explanation’.67\n\nPoore brought a number of employment discrimination claims against Peterbilt, including one alleging discrimination based on his employer's acquisition of genetic information in violation of GINA.68 In a brief opinion, the court found that the information at issue—the wife's multiple sclerosis diagnosis—was not ‘genetic information’ with respect to Poore, and therefore it dismissed the GINA discrimination claim.69\n\nTo reach this conclusion, the court turned to GINA's legislative history to glean the ‘basic intent of GINA’.70 Quoting statements by legislators, it concluded that GINA’s goal was primarily ‘to prohibit employers from making a “predictive assessment concerning an individual's propensity to get an inheritable genetic disease or disorder based on the occurrence of an inheritable disease or disorder in [a] family member”’.71 The court acknowledged that Congress included family history in its definition of ‘genetic information’ because it could be used ‘as a surrogate for genetic traits’, and could ‘be viewed to indicate that the individual himself is at an increased risk for that disease’. 72 Nevertheless, it reasoned that information about a disease or disorder in family members is not ‘genetic information’ if ‘such information is taken into account only with respect to the’ the family member with the condition and ‘not as genetic information with respect to any other individual’.73 In other words, information about Poore's wife's diagnosis with multiple sclerosis had ‘no predictive value with respect to Poore's genetic propensity to acquire the disease’,74 and presumably was not ‘taken into account’ with respect to Poore's health status. Therefore, according to the court, it did not constitute genetic information.\n\nThere is a certain logic to the Poore opinion. That GINA prohibits genetic discrimination based on presymptomatic genetic information as opposed to manifested genetic conditions could be read to suggest that it only prevents discrimination against people based on a propensity for genetic disease. Because a wife's health condition certainly does not predict her husband's genetic risks, it does not seem like genetic information understood in those terms.\n\nEven so, the Poore court notes that GINA defines ‘genetic information’, in part, as ‘the manifestation of a disease or disorder in family members of an individual’.75 Inexplicably, it does not grapple with this statutory language to consider whether a spouse is a ‘family member’. Nor does it examine GINA’s definition of ‘family member’ as ‘a dependent (as such term is used for purposes of section 1182(f)(2) of title 29 [the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”)]) of such individual’.76 Likewise, it does not discuss the interpretive guidance of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (‘EEOC’), which describes a ‘family member’ as a ‘person who is a dependent … as the result of marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption’.77 In other words, Poore fails to consider who the relevant family members are or what constitutes a dependent under GINA.\n\nThere is a strong argument that ‘the definition for “dependent” includes relatives who are not blood-related (e.g., spouse, adopted child)’.78 The EEOC took such a position in 2010 when promulgating the regulations to implement Title II, despite the fact that groups representing employers had submitted comments opposing the inclusion of such individuals. These groups argued that ‘dependents by adoption or placement for adoption should not be considered family members because genetic information about them would not indicate whether an individual protected by GINA might acquire a disease or disorder’.79\n\nThe EEOC rejected this narrow interpretation of ‘dependent’ because GINA’s ‘explicit reference’ to ERISA, when defining family members as dependents, made it ‘absolutely clear’ that dependents, even if not biologically related, constitute family members under GINA.80 Furthermore, health information about dependents through adoption or marriage could lead employers to discriminate against an employee based on her dependent's medical condition to avoid ‘potential health care costs’ or ‘increased health insurance rates’,81 which the EEOC believed GINA intended to prohibit.82 The health information of spouses would surely pose an equally great risk of such employment discrimination as the health information of non-biological children (through adoption or marriage). Therefore, the EEOC concluded that spouses are dependents.83\n\nIf this interpretation is correct, Poore's wife's multiple sclerosis is a manifestation of a disease in a family member, and therefore it constitutes genetic information under GINA.84 Instead of engaging with these important semantic and definitional issues, however, the Poore court simply reached its conclusion based on two statements made during floor debates before GINA was passed. It offered no context for the legislators’ assertions that genetic information must be predictive of the employee's health status and failed to assess how they relate to the statutory language Congress ultimately adopted.\n\nNevertheless, the Poore court set the groundwork for a two-tiered interpretative approach that other courts soon followed: ie a determination of (1) whether a manifested disease or disorder exists in a family member and (2) whether information about a family member's disease or disorder is ‘taken into’ account in determining whether the employee has a propensity for disease. The following year, for example, Allen v Verizon Wireless85 used similar reasoning to reject Queen Allen's claim for discrimination under Title II of GINA. Allen alleged she had been denied short-term disability benefits based on her family history.86 In requesting leave to care for her mother under the Family Medical Leave Act, she provided her employer, Verizon Wireless, with her mother's ‘confidential medical information’,87 which the court never described. She alleged that Verizon considered her mother's medical information, which she asserted was genetic information under GINA, in denying her request for short-term disability benefits.88\n\nThe court was skeptical that Allen's employer used her mother's medical information as ‘genetic ‘family history’. But even if her employer had, the court dismissed her claim on the grounds that Allen ‘failed to allege facts to raise a reasonable inference’ that she was denied benefits ‘because of’ the alleged genetic information.89 What is relevant for our purposes is the fact that the court quoted Poore with approval to describe the relevance of family medical history under GINA. As the court asserted,\n\nevidence of a family member's disease diagnosis is only considered ‘genetic information’ if used to determine the likelihood of disease in another individual. It is not considered ‘genetic information’ if it ‘is taken into account only with respect to the individual in which such disease or disorder occurs and not as genetic information with respect to any other individual’.90\n\nAlthough this discussion was not central to the court's ultimate resolution of the GINA claim, it reiterated the idea established in Poore that information about a family member's diagnosis only sometimes constitutes genetic information. It went a step further than Poore, however, because this time the family member was a blood relative—a mother—as opposed to a non-biological relative, like the spouse in Poore. Although one can find some ambiguity as to whether a spouse is a family member under GINA,91 an employee's mother unequivocally meets the definition of family member as an ‘individual who is a first-degree … relative of such individual’.92 In spite of that unambiguous statutory language, Allen advocated, in dictum, Poore's two-tier approach. In other words, a manifested genetic condition of a parent would not qualify for genetic information if it is not used ‘to determine’ the likelihood of disease or is not ‘taken into account’ with respect to the health status of the employee.\n\nApplying a similar interpretive approach, Conner-Goodgame v Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.93 decided a GINA retaliation claim in favor of the defendant. In that case, the plaintiff, Kaneshia Conner-Goodgame, claimed among other things that her employer discriminated against her in violation of GINA and discharged her in retaliation for having complained about discrimination under GINA.94 She argued that she informed her supervisor at Wells Fargo Bank that her mother had been diagnosed with and died from AIDs, she claimed her supervisor disclosed that information to her co-workers, in violation of GINA.95 The court disposed of her GINA claims on two grounds. First, it concluded that information about her mother's AIDS diagnosis ‘does not constitute genetic information about a manifested disease or disorder’.96 Citing to EEOC interpretations, it reasoned that GINA does not protect against discrimination on the ‘basis of impairments that have a genetic basis’ (ie manifested genetic conditions), but instead focuses on protecting against discrimination because an employer thinks its employee is ‘at increased risk of acquiring a genetic condition’.97 Furthermore, it pointed out that HIV tests are not genetic tests and therefore the determination of her mother's AIDS status based on such tests ‘could not be considered genetic information’.98\n\nThis analysis misunderstands several aspects of GINA. That GINA does not protect against impairments with a genetic basis is true, but irrelevant. The plaintiff was not claiming that the genetic information at issue was the manifestation of a genetic condition in herself, which clearly would not be protected under GINA.99 Instead, her claim was that information about the AIDS diagnosis of her mother was genetic information. While the court is correct that GINA protects against discrimination based on presymptomatic genetic risks, one of the ways it does that is by including information about ‘the manifestation of a disease or disorder in family members’.100 That her mother's diagnosis was based on HIV testing, which is not a genetic test, is also irrelevant. She was not suggesting that her mother's condition was diagnosed based on a genetic test. She merely claimed that she disclosed information about her mother's ‘manifestation of a disease or disorder’.\n\nSecond, the Conner-Goodgame court rejected the plaintiff's assertion that her employer's ‘disclosure of non-genetic information concerning [her] family member's disease or disorder’ could be a basis for liability under GINA in this case. It found ‘no support’ for interpreting genetic information ‘so strictly’.101 The court observed that the plaintiff ‘had no chance of acquiring HIV in the future as a result of her deceased mother's AIDS’, and therefore the family history provided no predictive information with regard to the employee. It also struggled with the notion that GINA protects non-genetic information concerning a family member, but not non-genetic information concerning a plaintiff herself. In essence, it feared the plaintiff's assertion that her mother's AIDS diagnosis was protected genetic information would ‘give more protection’ to the family member's information than to ‘the actual employee's information’.102\n\nAgain, as in Poore, there is a certain logic to the court's reasoning if one focuses on GINA’s distinctions between presymptomatic genetic information and manifested genetic disease. Because infectious diseases are not generally heritable, it is unlikely that an employee's mother's AIDS diagnosis decades earlier poses a risk of future disease in the employee. Like the Poore court, however, the Conner-Goodgame court erred in ignoring GINA’s plain language. In defining genetic information in part as ‘the manifestation of a disease or disorder in family members’, GINA did not distinguish between non-genetic and genetic disease in family members. The AIDS diagnosis in Conner-Goodgame's mother, therefore, unambiguously fits within this definition of ‘genetic information’.\n\nThe Poore two-tier approach to construing genetic information in terms of its predictive value continued in Maxwell v Verde Valley Ambulance Co., Inc.103 In that case, plaintiff Matthew Maxwell alleged that his employer, Verde Valley Ambulance Co. (‘VVAC’), required him, in violation of GINA, to ‘disclose “genetic information” in his family medical history’. Maxwell had told his supervisor that he was disabled due to a leg injury sustained prior to his employment. As a result, his employer requested he receive a medical evaluation to determine whether he ‘was qualified’ to perform his employment duties.104 When his supervisor requested a copy of the physician's letter, she also received the health and occupational history form that Maxwell completed, which indicated that his grandfather had had cancer.105 Maxwell alleged that VVAC violated GINA by ‘requesting, requiring, or purchasing genetic information’.106\n\nA key issue in addressing the claim was whether the plaintiff's family medical history concerning his grandfather's cancer was ‘genetic information’ under GINA. Quoting Poore and its reliance on legislative history, the Maxwell court emphasized that GINA's purpose is to prevent discrimination based on a ‘predictive assessment concerning an individual's propensity to get an inheritable genetic disease or disorder based on the occurrence of an inheritable disease or disorder in [a] family member’.107 Like Poore, it concluded that a family member's medical diagnosis does not constitute ‘genetic information’ under GINA if ‘such information is taken into account only with respect to’ the affected family member and ‘not as genetic information with respect to any other individual’.108 Finding no evidence to suggest that Maxwell's grandfather's history of cancer ‘was “taken account” with respect to Plaintiff’, the court found a question of fact as to whether the information at issue was ‘genetic information’. Accordingly, it denied both parties’ motions for summary judgement.109 Although the court left open the possibility that additional evidence could potentially support a conclusion that it was genetic information, it worried about the implication in the plaintiff's argument that an employer could face ‘strict liability’ any time it ‘receives information about an employee's family medical history’.110\n\nThe reasoning of the Maxwell court, in particular its unwillingness to conclude that the family history was ‘genetic information’ as a matter of law, is troubling in a few additional respects. First, as noted earlier, nothing in GINA suggests that the definition of genetic information depends on whether the manifested disease or disorder in an employee's family member is predictive with respect to whether the employee is at risk for a genetic disease. The statute states unambiguously that a manifested disease in a family member constitutes genetic information.\n\nSecond, even if the definition of ‘genetic information’ required family medical history to be predictive of an employee's future health risks, Maxwell is a case in which the family history was potentially predictive. Cancer has both genetic and environmental components. Its diagnosis in an employee's relative therefore has potential predictive value in assessing future health risks in the employee. Whereas an employee's wife's diagnosis with multiple sclerosis and an employee's mother's AIDS diagnosis are not indicative of the employees’ future health risks, information about cancer in an employee's second-degree relative has potential predictive value about his propensity for cancer. It would seem, therefore, that such a family history should be genetic information as a matter of law: it both fulfills the definition and is consistent with the spirit of GINA.\n\nTwo recently decided cases also rely on the Poore methodology to assess whether family history constitutes genetic information. Although the information at issue in these cases does not constitute genetic information under even a broad construction, the cases' reliance on Poore is instructive. In Carolina Rebecca Green v Whataburger,111 Ms. Green alleged a discrimination and retaliation claim under GINA based on information about her daughter's medical history, specifically the fact that her daughter needed surgery ‘due to the possibility of cancer’.112 The court correctly concluded that this information did not constitute ‘the manifestation of a disease or disorder in family members’ because her daughter had not yet been diagnosed with a condition.113 Nevertheless, the court's dictum suggested that to determine whether a family history is genetic information under GINA requires more than the fact that a family member has a manifested disease or disorder.\n\nThe court quoted the, by now, familiar language from Poore that the ‘purpose of the family medical history provision’ in defining genetic information is ‘to prohibit employers from making a predictive assessment concerning an [employee's] propensity to get an inheritable genetic disease or disorder based on the occurrence of an inheritable disease or disorder in a [a] family member’.114 In so doing, it suggested that even if there was evidence of a manifested disease in the daughter, the court would have to determine whether such information was ‘taken into account’ only with respect to the daughter and ‘not as genetic information with respect to any other individual’.115 Thus, it seemed to accept the two-tier analysis of Poore: (1) is there a manifested disease in a family member? and (2) is it taken into account to provide ‘predictive value’ with respect to the employee? The court was correct in concluding that the first-tier was not met (because Green's daughter had not been diagnosed with cancer). But the court erred in suggesting that a second analytic step would have been required, had a family history been established, to show that the family history was predictive in order to be considered ‘genetic information’.\n\nFinally, in Gibson v Wayfair,116 Toya Gibson brought a GINA claim alleging that Wayfair had terminated her employment based on information about her father's stroke and her mother's ‘unspecified mental illness’.117 Again, in dictum, the court cited precisely the same language from Poore that Whataburger and the other cases described in this section used.118 It did not ultimately apply the two-tier analysis of Poore, however, because Gibson had not exhausted the administrative remedies with respect to the claims concerning her father's stroke119 and because there was ‘no evidence that her mother was diagnosed with a specific mental disease or disorder’.120 Thus, although the ultimate disposition was correct, the court's endorsement of Poore's narrow understanding as to when family history constitutes ‘genetic information’ under GINA is problematic.\n\nII.B. Broad Construction of ‘Genetic Information’\n\nWhile Poore and its progeny construe ‘genetic information’ narrowly, in terms of whether it was ‘taken into account’ for its predictive value, another line of cases interprets the definition quite differently. They simply examine whether the information in question falls within the definitional language of GINA. For example, in Jackson v Regal Beloit America,121 the court easily concluded that under ‘the plain language of GINA’, Regal Beloit America (‘Regal’) had unlawfully requested genetic information from Shelia Jackson when the physician who performed an employment-related medical examination requested medical records that ‘contained protected “genetic information” in the form of her family history’.122 Unlike Poore and its progeny, the court did not suggest that another level of inquiry was required to assess whether the family history was ‘taken into account’ with respect to the employee's propensity for disease. Not only did the court find a GINA violation for an ‘unlawful request’ for genetic information,123 it also found that the plaintiff had established a retaliation claim under GINA. Jackson demonstrated that Regal's displacement and termination of her immediately followed her refusal to turn over requested medical records containing ‘protected genetic information’, and Regal offered no ‘legitimate rationale’ for its adverse employment decisions.124\n\nSimilarly, in Thomas Montgomery et al. v Union Pacific Railroad,125 the employer requested medical records ‘without a warning not to disclose genetic information’.126 Although the court considered the plaintiff's GINA claim to be ‘very weak’, it was unwilling to grant the employer summary judgement with respect to the plaintiff's claim that his employer had unlawfully requested genetic information by requesting medical records ‘without instructions to redact family history’.127 The implication, again, was that family history alone, without consideration of whether the employer ‘took it into account’ with respect to the employee's propensity for disease, constituted genetic information.\n\nIn other cases that also construe genetic information broadly, the facts might have yielded the same results even under the narrower interpretive approach of Poore et al. These cases are nevertheless instructive because they avoid Poore's two-tier analysis and focus only on GINA's simple definition. For example, in Punt v Kelly Services,128 employee Kristin Punt alleged that she was terminated from her employment based on her family history of cancer in violation of GINA. She had shared information with co-workers that her ‘mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, cousin, and aunt were all diagnosed with breast cancer’.129 The court readily concluded that such information ‘is the type of genetic information implicated by GINA’, not specifically because it suggested predictive potential, but because it met the statutory definition of ‘the manifestation of a disease or disorder in family members’.130\n\nIn spite of this more expansive understanding of GINA, however, Punt did not succeed because she failed to allege ‘sufficient evidence’ that her termination was based on her genetic information.131 While she faced the same challenge in establishing discriminatory intent that many plaintiffs face in bringing employment discrimination claims,132 she was not thwarted by a court's unwillingness to apply the plain language of GINA in establishing that the information at issue was genetic information.\n\nLee v City of Moraine Fire Dept. 133 similarly concluded that an employee's family history constitutes genetic information. In that case, David Lee's employer, Moraine Fire Department updated its requirements for health and wellness physicals. As part of the revised process, Lee completed a questionnaire, which asked about family history of heart disease.134 Lee brought claims under GINA alleging that his employer had ‘unlawfully requested [his] genetic information and family history’.135 The court easily granted his motion for summary judgement on this basis. It found that information about a family history of heart disease meets one of the statutory definitions of ‘genetic information’.136 In addition, it concluded that the question on the health form—‘Is there a family history of heart disease in your parents and siblings?’—violated GINA’s prohibition of requests for genetic information.137 Like the Punt court, the Lee court could have interpreted the information at issue to be genetic information under the more narrow, Poore analytic approach. But more importantly it merely examined whether the information met the statutory definition. It did not examine whether the information about family history was ‘taken into account’ with respect to the propensity of disease in the plaintiff.\n\nSimilarly, the court in EEOC v Grisham Farm Products, Inc.138 had little difficulty concluding that information about the health of family members constitutes genetic information. In that case, the requests for information about family history were more indirect. Defendant Grisham Farm Products, Inc. required job applicants to fill out a ‘three-page “Health History”’ form. One of the questions asked whether applicant Phillip Sullivan had ‘“consulted” a healthcare provider “within the past 24 months”’139 and whether ‘future … diagnostic testing … [has] been recommended or discussed’.140 Although the questionnaire did not directly ask about the health of family members, the court reasoned that Sullivan's responses would reveal ‘family history or risk factors’141 if Sullivan indicated that, despite having no manifestations of a medical condition, he had consulted with a physician, or a health care provider had recommended diagnostic testing. In other words, even indirect queries about health status that could lead to medical information about family members (or risk factors) constitute a violation of GINA’s prohibition of requests for genetic information.142 As a result, the court awarded damages to Sullivan.143\n\nLowe v Atlas Logistics Group Retail Services (Atlanta), L.L.C.,144 the last in the line of cases broadly construing genetic information, is quite different, factually speaking, from the other cases. It is also the most notorious, described in the press as the ‘devious defecator’ case.145 The case originated with a ‘mystery employee’ who ‘habitually’ defecated in one of the warehouses of Atlas Logistics Group Retail Services (‘Atlas’).146 In an attempt to identify the offender, Atlas requested that some of its employees, including plaintiffs Jack Lowe and Dennis Reynolds, submit to a cheek swab for forensic DNA analysis to compare their DNA with that of the ‘offending fecal matter’. Neither was found to be a match. 147 Both, however, filed charges of discrimination with the EEOC alleging that their employer had violated GINA in requesting and requiring them to provide, and in disclosing, their genetic information.148 While the EEOC dismissed the charges, the federal district court found that Atlas had violated GINA.\n\nThe case turned on whether ‘genetic information’ applied to the results of the forensic DNA analysis of Lowe and Reynolds. This method of identification determines genetic variants in non-coding regions of the DNA, but does not determine propensity for disease.149 Focusing initially on the text of the statute, the court concluded that ‘the unambiguous language of GINA covered Atlas’ requests for Lowe's and Reynolds’ genetic information’.150 The definition of genetic information includes, in part, information about an ‘individual's genetic tests’,151 which are defined as analyses of ‘human DNA, RNA, chromosomes, proteins, or metabolites, that detects genotypes, mutations or chromosomal changes’.152 Since the forensic analysis of the employee's DNA detected ‘genotypes and mutations’, it met the definition of a genetic test and therefore the results were genetic information under GINA.153\n\nAtlas argued, however, that the spirit and legislative history of GINA required the definition of genetic tests to be limited to those ‘related to one's propensity for disease’.154 It pointed to GINA’s goal of preventing the misuse of genetic information and, like Poore et al., quoted legislators expressing the view that the ‘intent of GINA was to be limited to combating discrimination based on one's propensity for disease’.155 It also quoted the same language upon which the Poore court relied: that GINA prohibits discrimination based on a ‘predictive assessment concerning an individual's propensity to get an inheritable genetic disease or disorder based on the occurrence of an inheritable disease or disorder in [a] family member’.156\n\nThe Lowe court was not persuaded by Atlas’ defense. First, it reasoned that Atlas’ understanding of genetic testing and information would ‘render[] other language in GINA superfluous’.157 For example, Congress explicitly excluded from the definition of ‘genetic test’ certain types of genetic analysis that do not establish disease propensity, such as ‘DNA analysis … for purposes of human remains identification’ and ‘analysis of DNA identification markers for quality control to detect sample contamination’.158 Such language, the court reasoned, would be ‘unnecessary’, if Atlas were right that any DNA analysis that did not identify disease propensity fell outside the purview of GINA.159\n\nSecond, it noted that legislative statements demonstrating instances in which GINA could protect people identified to be at an increased risk of diseases were not ‘exhaustive’ examples.160 More important, the court noted, the statements (that Poore et al. rely upon) suggesting that GINA was limited to information demonstrating disease propensity expressed the views of only ‘a handful of legislators’ and did not reflect the view of Congress.161 Instead, these statements were attempts to persuade fellow legislators that GINA’s definition of ‘genetic information’ was too broad and should be narrowed.162 As the Lowe court observed, their efforts failed and as did other efforts to narrow the definition.163\n\nThe court also noted that the EEOC regulations use the same language as GINA. Moreover, not all of its examples of genetic information include information that indicates a propensity for disease. The regulations state, for example, that information from ‘DNA testing to detect genetic markers associated with information about ancestry’ or ‘DNA testing that reveals family relationships such as paternity’ constitutes ‘genetic information’. Furthermore, the kinds of genetic tests that are not protected under GINA, according to the regulations, do not include the genetic forensic analysis used by Atlas.164 For all of these reasons, the court followed the ‘plain meaning of the statute's text’ and determined that Atlas had violated GINA in requesting DNA forensic analysis of its employees.165\n\nIII.A. Why Courts Should Adopt the Broad Construction of ‘Genetic Information’\n\nAs the Lowe court notes, the presumption should be to follow the plain meaning of the statute.166 Where statutory language is unambiguous, the words chosen by the legislature are ‘the most reliable source of legislative intent’167 and there is no reason to probe further to construe the meaning of the terms.168 In other words, courts should generally ‘look to other interpretive tools, including the legislative history’ only when there is ambiguity in the text.169 For the most part, GINA’s language defining genetic information and genetic test is ‘plain and admits of no more than one meaning’.170 Under this interpretive approach therefore, the text alone should be sufficient to construe the meaning of ‘genetic information’.\n\nEven in Poore, where there was potential ambiguity as to whether the term ‘family member’ applies to spouses, the court never considered whether this aspect of the definition was ambiguous generally or as applied to that case. Similarly, the other courts that relied on legislative intent to narrow their understanding of genetic information never discussed whether the statutory language was ambiguous. Nor did they offer any other rationale to justify an interpretation that goes against the plain meaning of GINA's definition of genetic information. Although these cases did not discuss their methodology, their approach hints at a view that the ‘meaning—or ambiguity—of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context’.171 As the Supreme Court noted in King v Burwell, ‘when deciding whether the [statutory] language is plain’, courts ‘must read the words “in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme”’.172 When one considers both that Congress intended to draft a broad definition and that it is impossible to draw tidy lines between genetic and non-genetic information, the definition read in context argues in favor of the broad construction.\n\nEven if an examination of legislative intent were necessary to determine the full meaning of ‘genetic information’ in these GINA cases, the legislative history and purpose of GINA support the broader construction. As the Lowe court noted, the fact that legislators cited examples of genetic information indicating a propensity for disease does not mean that ‘genetic information’ includes only such information. Moreover, there is scant support in the legislative history for the view that family history is genetic information only if it is predictive of an employee's future health. After all, such a view comes from the testimony of ‘only a handful of’ legislators who lost the battle over the breadth of the definition of ‘genetic information’.173\n\nFurther, the broad goal of GINA was ‘to fully protect the public from and allay concerns about discrimination’.174 As part of that effort, Congress expressly chose a definition of genetic information that is among the broadest of those used in genetics legislation. Not only did it use family history, which many state legislatures explicitly excluded from the definition, it included family members who were not genetically related. In addition, it did not define family history in terms of ‘inheritable’ manifested diseases of disorders in family members. While Congress could easily have narrowed its definition to include only family history that is expressly predictive of future health risks, it did not do so, in spite of some legislators' concerns about adopting too broad a definition. It seems clear from the ultimate definition that Congress adopted, even in the face of these criticisms, that its goal was to protect genetic information expansively.\n\nThe EEOC’s drafting of the final rule and response to comments offers some insights as to why Congress may have defined ‘genetic information’ broadly and failed to limit the definition to information about predictive risks. Although concerns about discrimination based on future health risks were the impetus for GINA, the EEOC did not modify its definition of family history in the ways suggested by Poore and progeny. Indeed, in drafting the Final Rule, it rejected requests from some employer groups to narrow the regulation's definition of ‘family medical history’ to include only modified diseases or disorders in family members that were ‘inheritable’ for a few reasons.175 First, the EEOC wanted the language of the regulation to be ‘consistent with the plain language of the statute, which also does not include the word “inheritable”’. In addition, given how rapidly the field of genetics is developing, the EEOC was concerned about the ‘significant compliance and enforcement problems’ for covered entities or EEOC investigators in determining whether a disease or disorder in family members is ‘“inheritable” or has a genetic basis’.176\n\nThe facts in Maxwell, involving a grandparent with cancer, illustrate this difficulty, given that cancer can but does not always have a strong genetic component.177 How would a covered entity or EEOC investigator determine whether this particular instance of cancer is inheritable or has a genetic basis? It is likely that Congress recognized such concerns and opted for a bright-line rule that would cover all predispositions to genetic disease, even if, in some instances it might be overly broad. Attempting to modify family history as ‘inheritable’ manifested disease or disorder in family members would have presented interpretation problems. It would also have risked the possibility of too narrow an understanding of genetic information and the possibility that some information that might be predictive of future health risk would be incorrectly deemed not to constitute relevant family history. Given the impossibility of a definition that maps perfectly onto propensity for health risk, Congress seemed quite clearly to prefer a definition that was overly broad to one that was overly narrow. Thus, the statutory language, GINA’s goal to ensure broad protection, and the implementing regulations all suggest that the understanding of family history as defined under GINA should not be restricted in the way that Poore, Allen, Connor-Goodgame, Maxwell, Carolina Rebecca Green, and Gibson suggest.\n\nNot only is the Poore interpretation inconsistent with the goals of Congress and GINA’s unambiguous statutory language, it also presents another and more subtle difficulty in its understanding of the meaning of family history. Even if one were to accept the view that genetic information is (or should be) limited to information predictive of future health risks in an employee, Poore's two-tier test to determine whether family history is genetic information requires a showing that a manifested disease or disorder in a family member is ‘taken into account’ not only with respect to the family member and but also with respect to the health risks of the employee.178 This language suggests not only that the health status of the family members must reveal a propensity of disease in the employee but also that it must be understood as such, ie ‘taken into account’ with respect to the employee.\n\nThe Poore lineage does not explicitly describe who must take it into account, but the reasoning of these cases suggests it must be the covered entity. The Poore court explains, for example, that GINA used family history to define ‘genetic information’ because employers could ‘potentially use [it] “as a surrogate for genetic traits”’. It makes this statement right before it discusses the need for the family history to be ‘taken into account’ with respect to the employee, implying it is the employer who must perceive the information in that light.179 The passive voice hides the actor, but who else could the court have imagined would interpret the information other than the employer? Under this view, therefore, the test of the predictive value of the health status of family members does not depend on whether the information objectively demonstrates a propensity for disease in the employee, but on whether the covered entity perceives this family medical history as genetic or heritable; whether it ‘takes into account’ the relative's health status in predicting a future health risk for the employee.\n\nUnder the facts of Poore and Conner-Goodgame, there may not be much distinction between an objective assessment of and the employer's view about the predictive value of a family member's health status. One could argue coherently under the facts of Poore and Conner-Goodgame that the family history—an employee's spouse's diagnosis with multiple sclerosis and an employee's mother's diagnosis with AIDs—reveals nothing about the propensity of disease in the employees under any objective assessment. Similarly, in both cases the employers did not (and one would not expect them to) interpret the family history as suggesting a propensity for disease.\n\nIn the Maxwell case, however, it is hard to make such an argument. One cannot claim definitively that cancer in a second-degree relative has no predictive value, objectively speaking. A family history of cancer might well have some such value, although without more information it is unclear how predictive it is. Even so, the employer might not ‘take into account’ the employee's grandfather's cancer with respect to the employee's health, even if it should have.180 Or the employer might assert that it has not done so, even if it has, a point that would be hard to disprove.\n\nTo make the distinction more concrete, imagine that an employee's relative had cancer, but an employer claims that it did not ‘take into account’ that information with respect to the employee's future health. If, in fact the relative's cancer had a genetic basis and therefore it was inheritable, this would be genetic information under an objective assessment because the family history would reveal a propensity for disease in an employee. But if the definition depends on the employer's perception of the relevance of this information to the employee's health, it would not be genetic information. Similarly, if the employer wrongfully claimed it had not taken the information into account and the employee could not prove otherwise, it also would not be genetic information under this test. Defining genetic information in terms of the employer's understanding and interpretation of the information essentially narrows the definition too much. Even if the family history is predictive, it will not be genetic information if the employer does not (or persuasively claims not to) perceive it as such.\n\nDefining genetic information in this manner therefore depends on the employer's state of mind, which is problematic for a few reasons. First, absolutely nothing in GINA or the EEOC regulations suggests that Congress intended genetic information to depend on the employer's understanding of the information. Worse, it substantially weakens one of the benefits of the privacy protections of GINA, which, as Jessica Roberts has noted, bolster the anti-discrimination prohibitions.181 GINA is ‘not a typical antidiscrimination statute’. Unlike the vast majority of federal antidiscrimination laws, which prohibit discriminatory actions, but do not prohibit covered entities from ‘seeking—or even disclosing—information related to other kinds of protected statuses’, GINA restricts employers from acquiring (‘requesting, requiring, or purchasing’) genetic information.182 As she notes, this privacy provision helps combat discrimination by making ‘intent … irrelevant’.183 Whereas employment discrimination claims generally require the challenging task of proving an employer's discriminatory intent—ie that the employment decision was based on the protected status184—GINA provides an avenue for relief under the ‘privacy’ provision that should not depend on establishing the employer's state of mind.185\n\nThe Poore lineage of cases limits this protection by requiring the employee to show not only that there is a family history, but also that the employer construes the family history as genetic information by ‘taking it into account’ with respect to the employee's health risks.186 If this understanding of genetic information is correct, it requires plaintiffs to establish their employers’ mindsets not only with respect to whether employment decisions were based on protected information, but also whether the information at issue is even protected under GINA.\n\nHad Congress wanted to define ‘genetic information’ in terms of the employer's perceptions it easily could have. After all, it defined disability under the ADA, in part, in terms of perceptions. Specifically, in drafting that antidiscrimination legislation, Congress adopted a definition of disability that includes objective information—whether one has had an ‘impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities’—as well as information related to perceptions—whether one has a ‘record of such an impairment’, or whether one is ‘regarded as having such an impairment’.187 GINA, in contrast, does not define ‘genetic information’ in terms of the employer's or anyone else's perceptions. None of the various definitions of genetic information discuss or refer to how the information is understood or ‘taken into account’ by the employer or anyone else.\n\nIII.C. The Problem of Genetic-Specific Legislation\n\nGiven the inevitable over- and underinclusiveness of any definition of ‘genetic information’, no definition will make everyone happy. But that is the price of any genetics-specific legislation and the problematic conceptual exercise of trying to distinguish genetic information from other medical information. These semantic and definitional challenges, however, also raise substantive issues about the propriety of attempting to grant genetic information special treatment and protection in the first place.192\n\nPerhaps there is something about presymptomatic genetic information that is truly different from other medical information, although as I describe in great detail in earlier work, I am skeptical. Certainly there are aspects of some (but not all) genetic information that warrant its protection—its predictive capacity, its hidden nature, its being out of our control, etc.193 But other kinds of medical information raise precisely those issues—non-genetic tests can predict health risks; epigenetic changes can be hidden and predict propensity for disease; and many non-genetic factors, including many environmental stimulants or even epigenetic changes, are outside our control.194 Moreover, if the concern is the immutability of genetic inheritance and the fact that our inheritance is outside of our control, how can we justify treating those with manifested genetic diseases differently from those who are merely at risk of genetic disease?195 Even so, GINA and other genetics legislation draw such a line.\n\nGINA’s unique treatment of medical information raises more than problematic semantic challenges. It also presents practical problems of implementation and troubling inconsistent protections for similar kinds of information. With respect to the first problem, it is difficult for employers to comply with some of GINA’s provisions. Although the ADA allows employers to seek the release of medical records of individuals to whom they have made a conditional offer of employment,196 GINA limits this right by prohibiting the acquisition of genetic information. Mark Rothstein argues, however, that complying with this provision is ‘infeasible’. Genetic information (whether one adopts the narrow or broad interpretation of this term) exists throughout the medical record, making it difficult or even impossible for health care providers to send medical records to employers devoid of any genetic information.197\n\nThis difficulty implementing the GINA privacy protections reflects the fact that GINA provides a level of privacy protection with respect to genetic information that does not exist for health information under the ADA. In addition to prohibiting employers from discriminating based on genetic information, GINA prohibits them from acquiring genetic information, with some exceptions.198 The ADA, in contrast, allows employers to access health records or require preemployment exams once a conditional offer of employment is made.199 Although the ADA prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of information about an employee's disability, employees may have difficulty determining or establishing whether employment decisions were made on that basis. GINA tries to limit this problem of proving discriminatory mindset by preventing employers from accessing genetic information in the first place. Why should genetic information be accorded such protection but not non-genetic medical information or information about manifested conditions (including genetic conditions)?\n\nWe should be especially troubled by this distinction because the temptation for employers to use information about a manifested condition would be just as great, if not greater than, the temptation to use information about a risk of a future illness that may not develop for years, or ever. The way that GINA treats family medical history only underscores this concern. To be sure, the biggest reason to include family medical history in the definition of ‘genetic information’ was to prevent employers from using indirect evidence to discern an employee's genetic risks. But, as discussed earlier, another rationale to include medical information about family members (even if related through marriage or adoption) in the definition is because of concerns that employers might discriminate based on the potential health care costs associated with the family member's illness. If those worries justify protection of information about family medical information, including information that does not in any way reveal the propensity of disease in the employee, it is not clear why an employee's presymptomatic genetic information, but not information about an employee's manifested condition, deserves privacy protection.\n\nIf one of GINA’s concerns was preventing employers from denying employment to someone because his wife's multiple sclerosis may impose burdensome health care costs, shouldn’t we also be concerned about employers denying employment to someone because of potential health care costs associated with a manifested condition, genetic or otherwise, in that individual? That the ADA prohibits such discrimination if the condition constitutes a disability under the statute is an inadequate response. As noted above, because the ADA does not establish the same kind of privacy protection for health information that GINA provides for genetic information,200 it can be hard for plaintiffs to establish whether the prohibited discrimination under the ADA has occurred. Perhaps this problem could be avoided, and the implementation challenges of keeping genetic information out of medical records could be resolved, by more broadly limiting employer access to medical information post conditional offer, ie by treating all medical information more like genetic information.201\n\nOn the other hand, there may be reasons to consider whether the privacy protections of GINA should be less absolute. GINA demands a ‘genome blind’ world where employers may never use genetic information for employment decisions.202 The ADA, in contrast, treats health information quite differently. Employers may use health information for certain employment decisions, such as providing reasonable accommodation for otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities.203 The ADA is but one example of antisubordination approaches where employers can use information about employees to remedy or prevent discrimination and its affects.204\n\nThat GINA treats genetic information in such a manner is not in and of itself problematic. This unique treatment of information related to the protected status may, however, limit the potential of GINA to advance some of its underlying goals. Imagine the scenario that Jessica Roberts describes, where an employee has a genetic predisposition to carpal tunnel syndrome.205 If employers could use this genetic information to provide reasonable accommodations, in the way they can for individuals with disabilities under the ADA, for example, the employee's chance of actually developing the condition might decrease.206 This outcome would be consistent with GINA’s goal of encouraging genetic testing so that people can improve their health. By treating genetic information differently from the way other antidiscrimination statutes treat information related to other protected groups, GINA might, to some extent, undermine its goal of encouraging the public to obtain the maximum benefits of genetic testing and related technologies.\n\n1Pub.

But because GINA does not define ‘a manifested disease, disorder, or pathological condition’, it is not clear whether such an individual would be presymptomatic and protected under GINA or affected by a manifested disease and not protected under GINA.

The court quoted the implementing regulations, which note that an employer is responsible for telling ‘health care providers not to collect genetic information, including family medical history, as part of a medical examination intended to demonstrate the ability to perform a job, and must take additional reasonable measures within its control if it learns that genetic information is being requested or required’.

Similarly, when the EEOC promulgated the final rule, it removed earlier references to ‘deliberate acquisition’ with respect to the prohibitions of acquisition of genetic information, indicating that the privacy violations of GINA did not require ‘specific intent’. As Professor Ajunwa notes, the EEOC ‘recognized the difficulty for a claimant to prove deliberate acquisition of genetic information by the accused’, eliminating a hurdle that might be insurmountable in the way that proving intent to discriminate can be insurmountable.
