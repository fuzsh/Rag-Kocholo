The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 3:05 p.m., in room SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Pat Roberts (Chairman of the Committee) presiding. Committee Members Present: Senators Roberts, Bond, Lott, Snowe, Chambliss, Warner, Rockefeller, Feinstein, Wyden, and Corzine. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PAT ROBERTS Chairman Roberts. The Committee will come to order. I would like to apologize to our witnesses for the 40- minute delay due to the procedural votes that we had on the floor of the Senate. I guess the good news is that, at least for the time being, we have completed those votes. The challenge that we face is that at 5 o'clock we will have additional votes. We're down already to 1 hour and 45 minutes. Now I have a marvelous opening statement that deals with the PATRIOT Act and all of the varied concerns and positives that are involved with that Act and your concerns as well. But, I am going to simply submit that for the record in an attempt to hear from you. Can we keep the applause down a little bit? [Laughter.] Chairman Roberts. I think the Vice Chairman is going to do likewise, although he will seek his own counsel. We've invited a panel of outside experts to provide their views of the USA PATRIOT Act and their opinions on those provisions of the Act which will expire later this year. Our witnesses are Mr. Gregory T. Nojeim, the Associate Director and Chief Legislative Counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union; Mr. Jim Dempsey, Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology; and Ms. Heather MacDonald, a John M. Olen fellow at the Manhattan Institute. The Committee thanks all of our witnesses for being here today. [The prepared statement of Chairman Roberts follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Pat Roberts The Committee will come to order. On September 11, 2001, 19 terrorists hijacked four flights over the United States. We all remember the events of that day. The images of the collapse of the World Trade Center, the burning Pentagon, and the crash site of United Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania should never be forgotten. But, the story of that day was written well before September 11th, and it was written by the terrorists that lived and trained within the United States. They rented apartments, bought cars, made telephone calls, sent e-mails, surfed the Internet, received wire transfers, and attended flight schools. The terrorists hid in the open--their sinister plans and intentions camouflaged by millions of innocent, lawful transactions that occur every day in the United States. The activities of the hijackers went largely unnoticed by our intelligence and law enforcement agencies. As this Committee and the 9/ 11 Commission have pointed out, systemic flaws in our national security agencies prevented full cooperation that might have stopped these attacks. But, in addition to these systemic flaws, our national security agencies were operating under obsolete authorities. Their hands were tied by inaccurate interpretations of existing law that restricted common-sense sharing of intelligence information. The USA PATRIOT Act was the first legislative effort by Congress and the President to reform our national security apparatus in response to the attacks of September 11th. The Act brought intelligence tools into the information age. Collection authorities that had been enacted during the era of the rotary phone had not kept pace with the new world of e-mail, the Internet, and mobile phones. The Act also tore down ``walls'' erected by overly cautious lawyers that had prevented information sharing and coordination between law enforcement and intelligence officials. The USA PATRIOT Act was drafted and passed by overwhelming majorities in both the Senate and the House and signed by the President on October 26, 2001. But, to describe the Act as a rash response to a horrific attack would be a mistake. Many of the provisions in the Act had been the subject of deliberation for years. The provisions were enacted with an acute awareness of rights guaranteed by the Constitution and applicable judicial precedents. The USA PATRIOT Act reflected a careful balancing of national security and the privacy rights of U.S. persons. Nonetheless, some of the more important provisions in the Act were passed subject to a ``sunset'' provision. Sixteen provisions in the Act--and the recently enacted ``lone wolf '' amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--will expire on December 31, 2005. The danger posed by terrorism and other national security threats, however, will not expire on that date. Today, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence continues its on-going oversight of the USA PATRIOT Act. This open hearing will be the first in a series of three hearings designed to educate Members and the public as the Senate considers the repeal of the ``sunset'' provision and modifications to other intelligence authorities. On Thursday, the Committee will hold a closed hearing on operational matters relating to the Act. Next Wednesday, we will hear from the Attorney General, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Director of Central Intelligence. This is not the Committee's first review of the USA PATRIOT Act or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, also known as FISA. The Committee regularly holds hearings, conducts briefings, and receives information regarding the activities of the Intelligence Community. The Committee conducted a closed hearing on the USA PATRIOT Act during the last Congress. We receive detailed reports from the Department of Justice every 6 months regarding FISA collection and annual reports on the use of other surveillance tools. The Committee is also in the final stages of completing its second audit of the procedures, practices, and use of FISA. This comprehensive, classified analysis will represent one of the most thorough reviews of Executive branch activities under FISA since the USA PATRIOT Act was enacted. Today, we have invited a panel of outside experts to provide their views of the USA PATRIOT Act and their opinions on those provisions of the Act that will expire later this year. Our witnesses are: Mr. Gregory T. Nojeim, Associate Director and Chief Legislative Counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union; Mr. Jim Dempsey, Executive Director of the Center for Democracy and Technology; and Ms. Heather Mac Donald, a John M. Olin fellow at the Manhattan Institute. The Committee thanks all of our witnesses for being here today. We have also received testimony and submissions for the record from: The Honorable Bob Barr, former Congressman from Georgia; Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, and Paul Rosenszweig (RO-zen-swayg) of the Heritage Foundation; Associate Professor Orin S. Kerr of the George Washington University Law School; and Ms. Kate Martin, Director of the Center for National Security Studies. Without objection, the submissions from these commentators will be entered into the record. Before I recognize the Vice Chairman, I want to set out some fundamental principles that will inform my consideration of the USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization and any other modifications to law or policy governing intelligence activities. First, our intelligence agencies need flexible authorities to confront terrorists, spies, proliferators, and other national security threats. Second, as we seek to protect national security, we must also ensure that civil liberties and privacy are not sacrificed in the process. This is not a zero-sum game, however. As former Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg noted, ``While the Constitution protects against invasions of individual rights, it is not a suicide pact.'' Third, these are not matters of ``first impression.'' Interpreting the Constitution and the President's responsibility to protect national security, Federal courts have wrestled with many of these issues before. They have recognized the authority of the President to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance of foreign powers and their agents. Well-established judicial precedents also make clear that certain records--even of the most private information--lose their Constitutional protection when voluntarily exposed publicly or to a business or other third party. Finally, I will support reasonable modifications to USA PATRIOT Act provisions or other authorities that clarify legal uncertainties, but I will oppose modifications that place unnecessary hurdles in the path of lawful intelligence investigations. I would like to note one particular example of an authority that has been questioned by some in the context of the USA PATRIOT Act. Everyday, we expose our personal information to businesses--when we buy milk from the grocery store with a credit card; when we open an e- mail account over the Internet; when we apply for a mortgage. This information we have voluntarily exposed to others is no longer private. Federal courts have clearly established that this record trail is not ``protected'' by the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. I have said before, that the 9/11 hijackers conducted numerous transactions while living within the United States. It should not be surprising that the records of these transactions would have been useful to the Intelligence Community before the attacks. Records from flight schools, cell phone companies, rental car dealers, or internet service providers might have revealed crucial information about the activities of these terrorists. To gain access to these types of transactional records, the FBI uses a FISA ``business records'' order. A FISA ``business records'' order allows the FBI to access records for investigations of international terrorists and spies. Before the USA PATRIOT Act, the authority to access ``business records'' under FISA was limited to certain types of business--like storage facilities, rental car companies, airlines, hotels, and the like. Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act expanded the types of entities that were subject to a FISA ``business records'' order and the types of items that could be sought with such an order. Armed with a FISA ``business records'' order, the FBI can now go to a flight school to ask for records about a student they believe to be a terrorist. They can ask an internet service provider for the subscriber information of a possible spy. They can ask for transactional records from a fertilizer company, a chemical company, and a car dealership if those records will support an investigation to stop a car bomb attack by al Qaeda. Libraries, booksellers, and others have raised great concern about this provision. In law enforcement investigations, the government can obtain the same types of records--from all types of businesses, including libraries and bookstores--with a grand jury subpoena. These subpoenas are issued without a court order and are subject to judicial review only after they are issued. A FISA ``business records'' order--on the other hand--can be issued only upon the approval of a Federal Judge serving on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The judge can direct the FBI to modify the scope of the order. No similar pre-issuance review exists in the context of grand jury subpoenas. Still, there is concern that the provision infringes privacy interests. A FISA ``business records'' order also CANNOT be sought if the investigation is based solely on activities protected by the First Amendment. This prohibition dovetails with existing restrictions in Executive Order 12333 on the collection of foreign intelligence concerning the domestic activities of U.S. persons. Finally, I note that the FISA ``business records'' provision is a relatively non-intrusive means of collecting intelligence for a national security investigation. Analysis of these business records can help solidify investigative leads or clear innocent names before more intrusive FISA techniques such as electronic surveillance or physical search are ever employed. And, there are limitations in the USA PATRIOT Act, along with requirements for judicial review, the Congressional reporting obligations, and the prohibitions in Executive Order 12333. While I recognize that some clarifying modifications to Section 215 may be necessary, I will oppose modifications that increase the standard for an order above ``relevance'' or place unreasonable barriers between these business records and intelligence officials. Section 215 is just one example of the numerous tools that the USA PATRIOT Act provided to the men and women protecting us from further attack. These tools are currently helping our intelligence agencies identify terrorists, track their movements, and disrupt their plots. The provisions are subject to review by courts and the oversight of Congress. Those provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act subject to expiration at the end of the year must be reauthorized. The alternative is a return to failed, outdated, and illogical limits on national security investigations that tied our hands prior to the 9/11 attacks. The dangers are real, and we should give our people every Constitutional tool available to fight and defeat terrorism. I now recognize the Vice Chairman for any remarks he might wish to make. Chairman Roberts. We also received testimony and submissions for the record from the Honorable Bob Barr, the former Congressman from Georgia; former Attorney General Ed Meese and Paul Rosenzweig of the Heritage Foundation; Associate Professor Orin S. Kerr of the George Washington University Law School; and Ms. Kate Martin, the Director of the Center for National Security Studies. Without objection, the submissions from these commentators will be entered into the record. [The prepared statements referred to follow:] Prepared Statement of Bob Barr Chairman Roberts, Ranking Member Rockefeller, distinguished members of the Select Committee, I thank you for the invitation to present my views in this written statement on the debate over the PATRIOT Act ``sunset'' provisions, and I applaud your oversight on this crucial matter. My name is Bob Barr. From 1995 to 2003, I had the honor to represent Georgia's Seventh District in the U.S. House of Representatives, serving that entire period on the House Judiciary Committee. From 1986 to 1990, I served as the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia after being nominated by President Ronald Reagan, and was thereafter the president of the Southeastern Legal Foundation. For much of the 1970's, I was an official with the CIA. I currently serve as CEO and President of Liberty Strategies, LLC, and Of Counsel with the Law Offices of Edwin Marger. I also hold the 21st Century Liberties Chair for Freedom and Privacy at the American Conservative Union, consult on privacy issues with the American Civil Liberties Union, and am a board member of the National Rifle Association. Finally, I am the Chairman of a new network of primarily conservative organizations called Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances, which includes the American Conservative Union, Eagle Forum, Americans for Tax Reform, the American Civil Liberties Union, Gun Owners of America, the Second Amendment Foundation, the Libertarian Party, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, and the Free Congress Foundation. We strongly urge Congress to resist calls to summarily remove the sunset provisions in the PATRIOT Act. This reflects our philosophy in support of all necessary and constitutional powers with which to fight acts of terrorism, but against the centralization of undue authority in any one aim or agency of government. As I have said many times before, I believe the current struggle to properly integrate our shared constitutional heritage into our efforts to provide for the common defense, is the defining debate of our time. If we fail to strike the appropriate balance, we will do irreparable harm to our most elemental principles as a nation. To that end, I urge this Committee to carefully examine the current language of the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act, and to make modest modifications to a handful of its provisions. In particular, I strongly urge individual members to co-sponsor Senator Larry Craig's Security and Freedom Enhancement Act of 2005, known as the SAFE Act. Although in many respects, this legislation does not address all of our concerns with the USA PATRIOT Act, it is an essential first step. Even though I voted for the USA PATRIOT Act in October 2001, as did many of my colleagues, I did so with the understanding it was an extraordinary measure for an extraordinary threat; that it would be used exclusively, or at least primarily, in the context of important antiterrorism cases; and that the Department of Justice would be cautious in its implementation and forthcoming in providing information on its use to the Congress and the American people. I have become skeptical on all of these fronts. First, the Justice Department has been quite frank in its use and desire to use the USA PATRIOT Act in non-terrorism contexts. Second, the administration has repeatedly stated its intention to expand the USA PATRIOT Act, and has floated various pieces of legislation that would do so. And, third, although this Committee would be in the best position to judge, the Justice Department has not produced any compelling evidence that the USA PATRIOT Act has been essential in preventing al Qaeda-style terrorist plots. Although I grant we have not suffered another major terrorist attack since 9/11, as Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff put it, ``[i]t's like sprinkling powder to keep away elephants. If no elephants show up, how do you prove it's because of the powder, rather than because there were never any elephants?'' \\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Stephen Brill, After: How America Confronted the September 12 Era 348 (2003). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Before I specifically discuss those provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act most pertinent to this Committee's jurisdiction, I would like to bring two new developments in the ``sunsets'' debate to the Committee's attention. Namely, we learned earlier this month that both the USA PATRIOT Act appears to have been used in the Brandon Mayfield affair, and that the Administration is increasingly turning to it for its surveillance needs. The Mayfield revelation is particularly disturbing. Mayfield--the Oregon lawyer turned prime suspect in the Madrid bombing investigation because of faulty fingerprint analysis at the FBI--was subjected to a highly intrusive Federal investigation and then detained as a ``material witness'' for 2 weeks before finally being exonerated. According to Attorney General Gonzales, the FBI used the USA PATRIOT Act when it executed a covert search of Mayfield's home. Specifically, the attorney general said that Section 207 was used to extend the duration of Mayfield's surveillance, and that ``in some sense'' Section 218, which made it easier to use intelligence authorities in criminal contexts, was used. We all fully understand the FBI is not perfect and generally support the bureau even when it makes honest mistakes. However, the Mayfield case shows how the USA PATRIOT Act, by lessening meaningful judicial oversight, reduces the ability of the FBI and Justice Department to avoid such mistakes. In particular, it shows how--through the increased use of classified and less exacting foreign intelligence surveillance authority in place of traditional criminal warrants based on probable cause and executed in the open--the USA PATRIOT Act can compound mistakes and amplify them into serious deprivations of an innocent person's personal liberty. In Mayfield's case, not only was a U.S. citizen detained, but his home was subjected to a ``black bag'' intelligence search even though the Justice Departillent was arguably conducting this search primarily for criminal purposes; in other words, in order to apprehend a suspect in a terrorist bombing that had already taken place. Such a foreign intelligence search is even more intrusive than the criminal ``sneak and peek'' search warrants available under section 213 of the USA PATRIOT Act, because notice is not simply delayed, it is never provided. The Washington Post reported that in a March 24th letter to Mayfield, the Justice Department acknowledged that during a covert search of his home, agents copied computer and paper files, took 355 digital photographs, seized six cigarette butts for DNA analysis, and used cotton swabs to obtain other DNA evidence. In short, the Mayfield case should serve as a cautionary tale of how the USA PATRIOT Act can seriously exacerbate any ``broken telephone'' effect in an ongoing investigation. I would also say, especially to Senators Hatch and Feinstein, that this is the type of problem that supporters of increased checks and balances refer to when discussing so-called ``PATRIOT Act abuses.'' No one is of the mind that the FBI would deliberately seek to infringe on the rights of loyal, law-abiding Americans. But there need be no malice aforethought for something to constitute an ``abuse.'' The fact is, procedural deficiencies in the law's implementation likely led to Mayfield's predicament, and Mayfield was an innocent man. Put another way, sometimes the road to abuse is paved with good intentions. Take, for instance, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, Act, which was passed to provide tools to fight organized crime, but was then used against pro-life groups. Overbroad laws are necessarily subject to overbroad application, if not now, then under future administrations, including those with less regard for civil liberties. That in itself can be deemed ``abusive.'' The second consideration--that the USA PATRIOT Act is becoming an ever more popular tool for the Justice Department--should be of particular concern to limited government conservatives like myself. As with taxes, unduly expanded government authority is next to impossible to retract. As an illustration, I would point the Committee to the Attorney General's statement that, to date, Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act has been used 35 times. Note, however, that former Attorney General John Ashcroft declassified a memorandum to FBI Director Robert Mueller in September 2003 saying that Section 215 had never been used, meaning that those 35 court orders have all been issued in just the last year- and-a-half. Granted, three dozen court orders may be considered by some to be a drop in the ocean of foreign intelligence document-production orders. Clearly, however, the trend is toward increased, not decreased, use of the USA PATRIOT Act; and, given the reach of the statute, the increased enthusiasm for its use ought to sound alarms. Similarly, on the eve of the recent, April 6th Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, the Justice Department released statistics disclosing the use to date of Section 213 of the PATRIOT Act--the so- called ``sneak and peek'' provision that grants statutory authorization for the indefinite delay of criminal search warrant notification. Apparently, the department sought and received the authority to delay notice 108 times between April 2003 and January 2005, a period of approximately 22 months. By contrast, it sought and received this authority 47 times between November 2001, when the PATRIOT Act was enacted, and April 2003, a period of about 17 months. The 5-month difference in timeframe aside, these numbers clearly reveal a substantial increase in use. Moreover, Senator Arlen Specter at the April 6th Judiciary Committee hearing also revealed that 92--or approximately 60 percent-- of those 155 requests were granted under the broad justification that notice would have the result of ``seriously jeopardizing an investigation,'' rather than under the more specific criteria that notice would endanger a person's life, imperil evidence, induce flight from prosecution or lead to witness tampering. While I understand the jurisdiction of this Committee is concerned primarily with foreign intelligence authorities, not with criminal ``sneak and peek'' warrants, I respectfully submit that you should be concerned when criminal investigative powers are made so broad that they come to resemble powers associated with foreign intelligence investigations. As Attorney General Gonzales informed Representative Flake at an April 7th hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, six criminal delayed- notice warrants under section 213 of the PATRIOT Act were approved with an indefinite delay (just as we had feared), and one had a delay that lasted fully half a year. Lengthy, secret surveillance, including secret ``black bag'' jobs (all undertaken, since 1978, with the proper approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, of course) have long been the hallmark of a specialized, but crucial, type of investigation--the foreign intelligence investigation of suspected spies and international terrorists--the members of this Committee understand better than anyone. When these intrusive powers, such as the power to enter a home without notifying the owner, become more common in criminal or other types of investigations, the American people become alarmed. The resulting furor risks more draconian limits on all such secret surveillance powers--even in the investigations where they may actually be needed. Although I acknowledge the Justice Departtnent's argument that Section 213 and 215 searches and surveillance represent only a fraction of the searches and surveillance conducted by the FBI and other security agencies, I remain concerned. These are extraordinary authorities and they are being used more frequently, and more and more outside their proper context of foreign intelligence and terrorism investigations. Any hint of such a trend should be very worrisome. Furthermore, I would point the committee's attention to an April 1, 2005 Associated Press story on a recent report to Congress by the Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs, William E. Moschella, disclosing the record number of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, wiretaps in 2004. The department requested and won approval of 1,754 FISA wiretaps in 2004, up from 1,724 in 2003. Although the marginal increase between 2003 and 2004 is small, the numbers still represent a 70 percent jump over the number obtained in 2000. In 2003, moreover, the use of intelligence wiretaps outstripped that of normal criminal wiretaps for the first time in history. One can only presume that the same trend continued in 2004. The USA PATRIOT Act is directly relevant to the increased use of these intelligence wiretaps, as a number of provisions in the law made these wiretaps more intrusive and much easier to obtain outside of terrorism or espionage investigations. Section 218, for instance, which is set to sunset this year, now requires the investigation of foreign intelligence or terrorism to be a ``significant purpose,'' rather than the primary purpose, of the intelligence wiretap. Bearing these two new developments--the Mayfield revelations and the increased use of the PATRIOT Act--in mind, I urge the Intelligence Committee to look at three provisions that are of particular importance to your oversight mandate. These are Sections 206, 215 and 505, which, respectively, created ``roving wiretap'' authority under FISA, expanded the government's ability to seize personal records and other materials under foreign intelligence authorities, and finally removed the required ``nexus'' to foreign powers for the specific targets of FBI ``National Security letter'' subpoenas. First, when Congress created foreign intelligence roving wiretap authority in the USA PATRIOT Act, it failed to include the checks against abuse present in the analogous criminal statute. This is troubling because, as roving wiretaps attach to the target of the surveillance and not to the individual communications device, they provide a far more extensive and intrusive record of a person's communications. Accordingly, criminal roving wiretaps require agents to ``ascertain'' that the target, rather than a third-party, is in fact using the telephone before they begin recording. They also require that, if the FBI does not actually know the identity (or an alias) of the target, but knows that he or she will be using a particular phone, the wiretap can attach to a single phone and all its users. In creating roving wiretap authority under FISA, the USA PATRIOT Act did away with this ascertainment requirement. Then, shortly thereafter, the intelligence authorization bill for FY 2002 took away the requirement that the applicant specify either the identity of the target or the particular communications device. The result, today, is a ``John Doe'' general warrant, issued secretly under FISA, that permits electronic surveillance irrespective of the communications device being tapped or the person being eavesdropped on. The Justice Department has defended the open-ended nature of these ``John Doe'' wiretaps, by pointing to the requirement that they provide the FISA court with a physical description of the target if it cannot identify the communications device or target. Critics question how much of a safeguard this description requirement is in practice, given the paucity of identifying information it requires. In recognition of the oversight authority and security clearance of this Committee, I would urge its members to inquire on this point at length. In addition, I would urge the Committee to tighten the roving wiretap authority to prevent anonymous or dragnet wiretapping, and to use the internal safeguards in the criminal roving wiretap statute as a model. At the very least, a judge authorizing a roving wiretap should have some assurance that (a) an innocent bystander's sensitive communications are protected, and (b) the court order is not an effective general warrant to be filled in later. To that end, Senator Craig's SAFE Act would restore the ascertainment requirement and mandate that an FBI applicant for a national security roving wiretap specify either the actual target (or an alias) or the communications device to be tapped. This would, I believe, reserve for the government power that is more than sufficiently flexible to meet the demands of modern anti-terrorism and other anti-criminal investigations, over and above that of pre-PATRIOT Act authorities. Next, I would urge the committee to carefully review the use and utility of Section 215, the USA PATRIOT Act's amendment to what was special authority under FISA to seize rental car, self-storage and airline records for national security investigations. Prior to the USA PATRIOT Act, the underlying statute applied to only a limited subset of businesses, and it required a showing of ``specific and articulable facts'' that the target was an agent of a foreign power. The 2001 Act removed both these limitations, thereby greatly expanding the power of the government to reach to all ``tangible things'' (including books, records, papers, documents and other items), and lowering the evidentiary standard below that of standard, grand jury subpoenas which are pegged to at least some showing of relevance to criminal action by a particular person in an ongoing international terrorism or foreign intelligence investigation. Some have questioned why the section 215 power has become known as the ``library provision,'' when libraries were not mentioned and given that it covers so much beyond library records or other information maintained by libraries. The answer is simple. Prior to the USA PATRIOT Act, library and bookseller records were not covered by this power, which then only permitted an order for the records of certain business. Now, library records are covered--as are all other records and tangible items, including membership lists of political organizations, gun purchase records, medical records, genetic information, and the list goes on. Section 215 also comes with a sweeping gag order, without any explicit provision for a recipient to even consult with counsel; and if certification is made that the records are sought for any intelligence or terrorism inquiry, the judge has no power under the law to challenge that certification. Finally, and crucially, this is not like a grand jury subpoena, because a recipient has no explicit right to move to have it quashed in court, and failure to comply with a 215 order is presumably a serious offense. Accordingly, critics of this section rightly charge that its open- ended scope and lack of meaningful judicial review open the door to abuses, and I agree. At the very least, Congress must restore the particularity requirement for the target of a Section 215 order, and should institute additional reporting requirements (subject, of course, to appropriate classification measures). Here again, such a modest limitation, consistent with traditional Fourth Amendment principles, would pose no significant hardship to Federal agents. Federal judges would, as they have for ages past, continue to approve virtually all such applications properly supported and applied for by government agents. The SAFE Act, among other new procedural safeguards, would restore the specific and articulable facts standard and provide a recipient with at least some outlet to challenge an unreasonable order. It would also require notice before any information seized pursuant to Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act is introduced as evidence in any subsequent proceeding. These are ``burdens'' the government has always been able to meet and which have never been seen as any real impediment to the government's ability to secure necessary evidence. I welcome the Attorney General's recent statements, agreeing to some changes to Section 215 that would make explicit a recipient's right to challenge the order and the secrecy provision, and would make explicit a recipient's right to consult an attorney. The Attorney General is certainly right to agree to changes in this poorly drafted provision, but, unfortunately, it remains unclear that the Administration will agree to a standard for a Section 215 order (individual suspicion) that will truly protect privacy. I strongly urge you to adopt the SAFE Act's standard in this regard. Finally, I would urge the Committee to review Section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which removed the requirement that the FBI self- certify that it has ``specific and articulable facts'' that the individual target of an administrative subpoena or ``national security letter'' (NSL), is an agent of a foreign power. Prior to the USA PATRIOT Act, the FBI could use NSLs, which serve as non-judicial subpoenas issued at the sole discretion of the FBI, to demand business, Internet, credit and telephony records, among other things. Before doing so, agents had to at least certify internally that the NSL pertained to a particular individual, who was acting on behalf of a foreign power. The USA PATRIOT Act effectively allows the FBI to issue NSLs for certain financial, transactional, electronic communications and credit records without any individualized suspicion. It changed the standard again to relevance to any investigation. The SAFE Act treats NSLs much like it does Section 215 orders--it maintains the expansive scope of the law, but includes the appropriate, minimal standard of individual suspicion; provides an explicit right to challenge the order; and retains the secrecy requirement, all of which take into account the sensitivity of national security investigations without taking away any necessary government powers. In short, the SAFE Act simply modifies the powers expanded by the USA PATRIOT Act, by making the government's exercise thereof subject to the basic Fourth Amendment notion that before the government ``pierces'' an individual's right to privacy of information that can be used as evidence against them, it must have a reasonable suspicion that the person has either violated the law or is serving as an agent of a foreign power. The government has not shown any reason why it cannot meet such a nominal burden, and the Fourth Amendment requires it do so. I believe, especially given that NSLs currently have no judge in the picture at all, that the SAFE Act's approach is entirely appropriate. The committee should also note that Section 505(a) of the USA PATRIOT Act has been at the center of an ongoing bit of confusion about a 2004 court decision dealing with NSLs and whether that court decision involved the 2001 Act or some other law. If I may, I would like to take this opportunity to make sure the record is accurate. In September 2004, Judge Victor Marrero of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a 50-page ruling in the case of Doe v. Ashcroft, 334 F.Supp.2d 471 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). In it, he struck down 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2709, the statute permitting the issuance of NSLs for customer records from Internet, telephone and other electronic service providers. The judge struck the provision in its entirety, including the amendments made by Section 505(a) of the PATRIOT Act. Accordingly, the judge's decision struck down all of Section 505(a) of the PATRIOT Act, but also struck down the rest of the NSL statute with it.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Judge Marrero's decision did not affect the rest of Section 505, which amended a number of different statutes that permit the FBI to issue NSLs for the production of other kinds of records. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The judge ruled on two primary grounds--that the Section 2709 NSL is unreviewable, and that the attached gag order forever barred a recipient from telling anyone anything about the NSL. As the judge noted repeatedly in his opinion, the USA PATRIOT Act did remove the requirement of individual suspicion from the statute. For instance, he rests a large part of his First Amendment findings on the FBI's post- PATRIOT Act ability to suppress anonymous speech using an NSL. Judge Marrero proffers two hypotheticals on that score, neither of which would have been possible prior to the USA PATRIOT Act unless the FBI had specific facts that the individual target was an agent of a foreign power. The FBI could use an NSL, the judge notes, to disclose the identity of an anonymous ``blogger'' critical of the government, or to discover the identity of everyone who has an e-mail account through a political campaign. A number of lawmakers and other interested parties continue to claim, however, that Doe v. Ashcroft did not strike down a provision of the USA PATRIOT Act because Section 2709, prior to the Act, did not contain a right to challenge and contained a gag order. This is simply not true. First, whenever a statute is struck down in its entirety any then-operative amendments are also rendered unconstitutional. It is hard to see how a decision that strikes down every word of one section of a law can be said not to ``involve'' that law. Second, the USA PATRIOT Act is the 800-pound gorilla in the Marrero opinion, and clearly factored into his reasoning. In sum, then, I urge the Committee to take into account the recent developments in the USA PATRIOT Act debate, most notably the Mayfield revelations and the indications that the Justice Department is turning to the PATRIOT Act more and more. I also respectfully ask that the Committee look closely at the three most contentious PATRIOT Act amendments to foreign intelligence law--Sections 206, 215 and 505--and urge individual members to co- sponsor S. 737, the Security and Freedom Enhancement Act of 2005, which already enjoys bipartisan support. As evidenced by the circumstances surrounding the founding of this very Committee, foreign intelligence law, especially as it applies domestically, poses serious risks to basic constitutional freedoms. While some hail the provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act as breaking down an artificial ``wall'' or a ``technicality'' between the gathering and use of evidence in criminal cases--matters necessarily subject to the Bill of Rights--and the gathering of foreign intelligence-- appropriately not subject in its gathering to the limitations in the Bill of Rights--the fact is the artificial ``wall'' that applied different standards to the gathering and use of each category of information, is neither artificial nor a technicality: it is the Constitution of the United States of America. In treating them as one and the same in the name of fighting ``terrorism'' or any other threat posed to the good order and safety of our society, we show disdain for the fundamental underpinning of our constitutional form of government and the freedoms it enshrines. Doing otherwise will result in an historical pattern where such laws are made ever more secret, ever more unchecked and ever more susceptible to abuse; and each subsequent national ``crisis'' forces the shades drawn tighter. It is a slippery slope, down which this Committee, this year in consideration of whether to sunset certain provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act and in deciding whether to place very modest and limited--but fundamentally important--restraints on some of the law's provisions, can help avoid. Thank you again for this opportunity to comment on the vitally important deliberations of this Committee. I remain available to provide whatever further information the Committee might request. The Heritage Foundation, Washington, DC, April 18, 2005. Hon. Pat Roberts, Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senate Hart Office Bldg., Washington, DC. Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV, Vice Chairman, Senate Select Committee on on Intelligence, Senate Hart Office Bldg., Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Roberts and Vice Chairman Rockefeller: We understand that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence will be conducting an oversight hearing on April 19th concerning the reauthorization of certain provisions of the Patriot Act. We write to provide you with our views concerning that question. In general, our view is that too much of the debate has focused on the Act not as it truly is but as people perceive it to be. Most of the proposals for reform mistake the appearance of potential problems and abuse (the myth) with the reality of no abuse at all. To take but one example, the Inspector General for the Department of Justice has consistently reported that there have been no instances in which the Patriot Act has been invoked to infringe on civil rights or civil liberties. See Report to Congress on Implementation of Section 1001 of the USA Patriot Act (March 2005); see also ``Report Finds No Abuses of Patriot Act,'' Wa. Post at A2 (Jan. 28, 2004). Thus, while we acknowledge that any expansion of governmental power comes with the potential for abuse, that potential does not, in our judgment warrant hesitancy absent some evidence of real abuse. In short, the case for change has not been made. The Heritage Foundation has conducted extensive research on the Patriot Act that provides greater detail on this subject. All of our research is summarized in a memorandum we published entitled ``The Patriot Act and Related Provisions: The Heritage Foundation's Research'' (http:// www.heritage.org/Research/HomelandDefense/wm612.cfm). Most saliently for the Committee's consideration we would respectfully call your attention to two separate publications that contain much of our substantive analysis (copies of which we enclose with this letter): Rosenzweig, Carafano & Kochems, eds. ``The Patriot Act Reader,'' (also available at http://www.heritage.org/Research/ HomelandDefense/The-Patriot-Act-Reader. cfm) Meese & Rosenzweig, ``The SAFE Act Will Not Make Us Safer,'' (also avail- able at http://www.heritage.org/Research/HomelandDefense/lm10.cfm) We would ask that you make this letter and our publications a part of the record of the Committee's hearing. We thank you for the opportunity to share with you our views. Sincerely yours, Edwin Meese III, Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow. Paul Rosenzweig, Senior Legal Research Fellow.

Kerr Mr Chairman, Members of the Committee: My name is Orin Kerr, and I am an Associate Professor at George Washington University Law School. It is my pleasure to submit this written testimony concerning the USA Patriot Act. My testimony will contain three parts: first, a brief explanation of my view that the public debate over the Patriot Act largely has misunderstood the Act; second, an overview of the legal issues raised by foreign intelligence surveillance; and third, an analysis of the constitutional issues raised by orders to compel information such as library records, bookstore records, and Internet communications. I. THE DEBATE OVER THE USA PATRIOT ACT The public debate over the USA Patriot Act has been based on a number of major misunderstandings about the scope and effect of the law. Millions of Americans believe that the Patriot Act profoundly reshaped the balance between privacy and security in a post-9/11 world. That is simply wrong. The truth is that the law is much more modest: Most of the Patriot Act consists of minor adjustments to a set of preexisting laws, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. The Patriot Act left the basic framework of preexisting law intact, offering mostly minor changes to the set of statutory privacy laws Congress first enacted in the 1970's and 1980's. I explained this in greater depth in a law review article published in January 2003, and stand by that view today. See Orin S. Kerr, Internet Surveillance Law After the USA Patriot Act: The Big Brother That Isn't, 97 Northwestern University Law Review 607 (2003), available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-- id=317501. Fortunately, the gap between the perception and the reality of the Patriot Act is beginning to narrow. In recent months, critics of the Patriot Act have come to acknowledge that most of the Act is consensus legislation that does not raise civil liberties concerns. For example, in an April 5, 2005 press release the American Civil Liberties Union acknowledged that: Most of the voluminous Patriot Act is actually unobjectionable from a civil liberties point of view and . . . the law makes important changes that give law enforcement agents the tools they need to protect against terrorist attacks. A few provisions . . . must be revised. . . . See Bipartisan Legislation Would Fix Worst Parts of Patriot Act While Maintaining Key Law Enforcement Powers, available at http:// www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm? ID=17935&c=206. Although it is unfortunate that this acknowledgment appeared as late as it did, the ACLU's recognition that the Patriot Act debate is actually quite narrow is an important step to understanding Patriot Act reform. It reveals that the differences among pre-Patriot Act law, the law under the Patriot Act, and proposals to reform the Patriot Act tend to be relatively small. Of course, any legislative proposals that impact government power to conduct criminal or intelligence surveillance must be treated with the greatest consideration and care. Finding the right balance that both gives the government the power it needs to investigate terrorist threats and preserves our precious civil liberties is a very difficult task. At the same time, the effect of the Patriot Act and the scope of proposed amendments to it are much narrower than press accounts would lead one to believe. II. OVERVIEW OF THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE USA PATRIOT ACT AND FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE I will now turn to an overview of the issues raised by the law of intelligence surveillance to help put the debate in better perspective. At the most basic level, any modern legal regime that allows the government to investigate crime or terrorism must address a number of basic methods for acquiring information. In particular, the law must cover three basic types of authorities: (1) Authority to conduct physical searches to retrieve physical evidence or collect information. (2) Authority to compel third parties to produce physical evidence or disclose information. (3) Authority to conduct real-time monitoring over communications networks. In the case of criminal investigations, the legal regime that covers these authorities is well- established. The first authority is governed by the traditional Fourth Amendment warrant requirement. The police must have a search warrant based on probable cause to enter a home or business unless a person with apparent or actual authority over the place consents, exigent circumstances exist, or another exception to the warrant requirement applies. The second authority is governed by the Fourth Amendment rules governing subpoenas. Although many different types of subpoenas exist, and the rules can vary slightly depending on the type of subpoena, the general rule is that the police can compel third parties to disclose information in their possession using a subpoena. A subpoena can be issued under a wide range of circumstances: the information need only be relevant to the government's investigation, and compliance with the subpoena cannot be overly burdensome to the subpoena recipient. Finally, the third authority is regulated primarily by statutory law. Two different laws apply: the interception of contents such as phone calls and e-mails is regulated by the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2510-22, and the collection of non-content information such as phone numbers dialed and e-mail addresses is governed by the Pen Register statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3121-27. The former requires the law enforcement to obtain a ``super warrant'' based on probable cause unless an exception applies, while the latter permits law enforcement monitoring of non- content information under a relevance court order something like a subpoena. The law governing monitoring for intelligence purposes is somewhat different than the law governing evidence collection for criminal cases. The Fourth Amendment's requirements are much less clear--and generally less strong--than in the routine criminal context. As a general matter, the few courts that have confronted how the Fourth Amendment applies to intelligence collection have held that the rules are somewhat similar to the rules for criminal investigations but also more flexible. When the Fourth Amendment applies, information and evidence collection must be reasonable in light of the countervailing demands and interest of intelligence collection. See United States v. United States District Court, 407 U.S. 297, 323-24 (1972); In re Sealed Case, 310 F.3d 717, 745-46 (Foreign Int. Surv. Ct. Rev. 2002). This legal framework appears to place Congress in the primary role of generating the law governing intelligence collection, with the Fourth Amendment serving as a backstop that reviews Congress's approach to ensure that it is constitutionally reasonable. Congress has responded to the challenge by passing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, also known as ``FISA.'' FISA attempts to create a statutory regime for intelligence monitoring that largely parallels analogous rules for gathering evidence in criminal cases. FISA covers the three basic authorities as follows: First, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1821-29 covers the authority to conduct physical searches, a parallel to the provision of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that allows investigators to obtain a search warrant in criminal cases. Second, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1861-62 and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2709 covers authority to compel third-parties to disclose records and physical evidence, a parallel to the provision of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that allows the issuance of subpoenas in criminal investigations. Third, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1801-22 and 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1841-45 cover the authority to conduct real-time monitoring over communications networks. Specifically, Sec. Sec. 1801-22 cover the authority to obtain the contents of communications, a parallel to the Wiretap Act used in criminal cases, and Sec. Sec. 1841-45 cover the authority to obtain non-content information, a parallel to the Pen Register Statute used in crime investigations. The debates over the FISA-related provisions of the Patriot Act focus primarily on the second type of authority: powers to compel third parties to produce physical evidence or disclose information. Specifically, critics object to the weak privacy regulations found in provisions such as Section 215 of the Patriot Act that address the government's power to compel third parties to produce physical evidence or disclose information in intelligence cases. For the most part, these weak privacy regulations match the standards applied in the analogous criminal context. For example, the Supreme Court has held that a grand jury subpoena can be issued if the order to compel seeks information that may be relevant to a criminal investigation. See United States v. R. Enterprises, Inc., 498 U.S. 292 (1991). This authority ``paints with a broad brush'' by design, permitting subpoenas to be issued ordering third parties to disclose physical evidence and information ``merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even just because . . . assurance [is sought] that it is not.'' Id. at 297 (quoting United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U.S. 632, 642-643 (1950)). The Supreme Court has justified this low standard on the ground that orders to compel evidence from third parties are preliminary investigative tools designed to determine if more invasive forms of surveillance are necessary. ``[T]he Government cannot be required to justify the issuance of a grand jury subpoena by presenting evidence sufficient to establish probable cause because the very purpose of requesting the information is to ascertain whether probable cause exists.'' See R. Enterprises, Inc., 498 U.S. at 297. The key question that the Committee must consider is whether a higher standard is appropriate for orders to compel in the context of intelligence investigations. The environment of intelligence investigations is somewhat different than the environment of criminal investigations. For example, subpoenas can be easily challenged and can be complied with under few time pressures, both of which are important explanations for the light legal regulations of subpoenas. See United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1, 10 (1973). At the same time, the harm that intelligence investigations seek to avoid is on average greater than the harm a typical criminal investigation seeks to deter. In addition, it is worth noting that Congress has opted to provide special privacy protections to protect some types of Internet communications and stored e-mails, raising the privacy protection beyond that provided by subpoenas. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703. Perhaps Congress should consider a similar approach in the intelligence context, permitting subpoena- equivalents to be used in some contexts but higher-threshold court orders to be used in other contexts that raise more substantial privacy concerns. III. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF ORDERS TO COMPEL LIBRARY RECORDS AND INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS The statutory regulation of orders to compel evidence from third parties is particularly important because the Fourth Amendment offers little in the way of regulation of such orders. In this final section, I wish to explain the constitutionality of orders to compel, specifically in the context of library records and Internet communications obtained from third party providers. My conclusion is that orders to compel the disclosure of evidence from third parties ordinarily do not require probable cause. Under current law, for example, probable cause is not required to compel libraries to compel library records. The constitutionality of orders to compel evidence without probable cause can be justified on two alternative grounds. The first is that the disclosure of information to third parties has been held to eliminate Fourth Amendment protection in that information. As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 443 (1976): This Court has held repeatedly that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities, even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in the third party will not be betrayed. Under the disclosure rationale of Miller, third parties normally can be ordered to disclose records held by them without implicating the Fourth Amendment on the theory that the information was disclosed to them in the course of their coming into possession of the information. Applying this rationale, courts have uniformly held that an individual does not retain Fourth Amendment rights in non-content records that reveal how that individual used an account or service provided by a third party. A person may reasonably believe that the third party will not disclose the information to the police, but this alone does not create a Fourth Amendment ``legitimate'' or ``reasonable'' expectation of privacy in the information. For example, a person does not retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information the telephone company retains about how a particular telephone account was used. See United States v. Fregoso, 60 F.3d 1314, 1321 (8th Cir. 1995). Similarly, a customer does not retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information that Western Union retains about how a particular Western Union account was used. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 827 F.2d 301, 302-03 (8th Cir. 1987). The rationale also applies to library records. For example, in Brown v. Johnston, 328 N.W.2d 510 (Iowa 1983), a library challenged a subpoena obtained by a State investigator who wanted to gather library circulation records to see if anyone had checked out books relating to cattle mutilation. The Iowa Supreme Court rejected the argument that an ordinary subpoena could not be used to collect library records: It is true the State's investigation was only preliminary; and as Brown and the library board argue, no suspects were identified nor was the search for information limited to any named library patrons. This does not diminish the need for the information, however, as we assume the whole purpose in examining the record was to gain enough information so that the investigation could be narrowed. The State's interest in well-founded criminal charges and the fair administration of criminal justice must be held to override the claim of privilege here. Brown and the library board have cited no cases to us which have reached a contrary conclusion under similar facts, and we have found none. Id. at 513. Although I have been unable to find any cases applying the Fourth Amendment to bookstore records, the same analysis would seem to apply to sales records kept by bookstores. To be sure, some State courts have interpreted their own State constitutional provisions to create greater privacy protections to regulate State police officers in the context of bookstores. See, e.g., Tattered Cover, Inc. v. City of Thornton, 44 P.3d 1044 (Colo. 2002). But as far as I am aware, no court has held that a person retains a reasonable expectation of privacy in their bookstore customer records under the Fourth Amendment. As a general matter, the Fourth Amendment rules that apply to bookstores are the same as the Fourth Amendment rules that apply to other spaces. See, e.g., Maryland v. Macon, 472 U.S. 463 (1985). Finally, the same rationale applies to non-content Internet account records. Non-content Internet account records are disclosed to the ISP, and are not protected under the Fourth Amendment. See United States v. Hambrick, 55 F. Supp. 2d 504, 508 (W.D. Va. 1999), aff 'd, 225 F.3d 656 (4th Cir. 2000) (unpublished opinion); United States v. Kennedy, 81 F. Supp. 2d 1103, 1110) (D. Kan. 2000) (same). This does not mean an individual can never have a reasonable expectation of privacy in information held by third parties. Existing caselaw focuses on whether the information transferred to the third- party is disclosed to the third party or is sealed away from them. If a person gives third party a sealed container to hold on their behalf, then that person retains a reasonable expectation of privacy in the unexposed contents of that sealed container. See, e.g., United States v. Most, 876 F.2d 191, 197-98 (D.C. Cir. 1989); United States v. Barry, 853 F.2d 1479, 1481-83 (8th Cir. 1988). For that reason, a person retains a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of sealed postal letters or packages sent via UPS or FedEx until the point that the letters and packages arrive at their destination. See Ex Parte Jackson, 96 U.S. (6 Otto) 727, 733 (1877); Walter v. United States, 447 U.S. 649, 651 (1980). It is unclear under current law how the sealed/unsealed distinction applies to disclosed information such as Internet communications, particularly in the context of the contents of Internet communications. Courts may conclude that by sending an e-mail, the user discloses that e-mail to an ISP under Miller. On the other hand, courts may conclude that the contents of e-mail can be analogized to the contents of a sealed letter, and thus retain Fourth Amendment protection. At the current time, all we know is that the Fourth Amendment does not protect non-content information held by ISPs, and may or may not protect content information held by ISPs. Notably, this uncertainty is part of what led Congress to impose greater statutory protections in the case of e-mail contents sought in criminal investigations under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703(a). Finally, existing cases suggest that a subpoena or equivalent order to compel without probable cause may be constitutionally sufficient even if a suspect retains a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information. The case here are sparse, as the courts have decided few cases in which the government ordered a third party to disclose sealed packages. But the few cases on this question suggest that the government can subpoena information even if that information is protected by a reasonable expectation of privacy; no probable cause warrant is required. See United States v. Barr, 605 F. Supp. 114, 119 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (permitting subpoena served on third-party mail service for undelivered mail); United States v. Schwimmer, 232 F.2d 855, 861-63 (8th Cir. 1956) (permitting subpoena served on third-party storage facility for private papers in facility's possession); Newfield v. Ryan, 91 F.2d 700, 702-05 (5th Cir. 1937) (permitting subpoena served on telegraph company for copies of defendants' telegrams). In light of these cases, current law points to the use of orders to compel evidence as being constitutional in the Fourth Amendment in most if not all cases without a requirement of probable case. The most difficult and least clear cases are orders to compel content records, such as the contents of e-mails and sealed letters. In most circumstances, however--and clearly in the case of non-content records such as library records--orders to compel evidence do not require probable cause under the Fourth Amendment. __________ Prepared Statement of Kate Martin, Director, Center for National Security Studies While effective counterterrorism and counterintelligence require that agencies share relevant information, sections 203 and 905 of the USA Patriot Act fail to address the real difficulties in such sharing: How to determine what information is useful for counterterrorism and counterintelligence; how to determine what information would be useful if shared; how to identify whom it would be useful to share it with; and how to ensure that useful and relevant information is timely recognized and acted upon. To the contrary, the approach of the Patriot Act--which can fairly be summarized as share everything with everyone-- can be counted on to obscure and make more difficult the real challenge of information sharing. Widespread and indiscriminate warehousing of information about individuals violates basic privacy principles. Amending the Patriot Act to require targeted rather than indiscriminate information sharing would restore at least minimal privacy protections and substantially increase the likelihood that the government could identify and obtain the specific information needed to prevent terrorist acts. Section 203 of the USA Patriot Act allows unrestricted sharing of sensitive information gathered by law enforcement agencies with the CIA, the NSA, immigration authorities, the Secret Service, and White House officials. Such sharing is not limited to officials with responsibility for terrorism matters, nor are there any safeguards regarding the subsequent use or dissemination of such information by such officials (so long as the use is within the official duties of the recipient). Section 203 allows the sharing of all information that is in any way related to any American's contacts with or activities involving any foreign government, group, or individual. (Section 203 allows the sharing of ``foreign intelligence information,'' ``foreign intelligence'' and ``counterintelligence.'' The definition of ``foreign intelligence information'' included in section 203 is tied to threats and potential threats of terrorism, sabotage and clandestine intelligence-gathering, the national defense and foreign affairs, Sec. 203(a)(1)(iv), 203(b)(2)(C), and 203(d)(2). However, the definitions of ``foreign intelligence'' and ``counterintelligence'' are not even that limited.) Section 203 applies to all intercepts of telephone conversations. It applies to all confidential information obtained by a grand jury, which has the power to subpoena virtually any records or testimony from any person merely at the request of a prosecutor. Section 905 overlaps with section 203, but makes such sharing mandatory. It requires the Attorney General and the head of any other law enforcement agency to ``expeditiously disclose'' to the Director of Central Intelligence (and now the new Director of National Intelligence) all ``foreign intelligence'' acquired during a law enforcement investigation. The Attorney General may exempt only those classes of foreign intelligence whose disclosure ``would jeopardize an ongoing law enforcement investigation or impair other significant law enforcement interests.'' Section 905 suffers from the same defects as section 203: it covers the most sensitive grand jury information and wiretap intercepts regardless of relevance, and contains no limits on the use or redisclosure of the information by intelligence agency staff. ``Foreign intelligence'' includes anything related to any American's contacts with a foreign government, group or person. The Act sets no standards or safeguards for use of this information. While it requires the Attorney General to issue rules, those rules simply require that information concerning citizens and legal permanent residents be marked as such. Existing intelligence agency protocols are so broad as to allow intelligence agencies to keep all information obtained under section 203 or 905. See EO 12333 section 2.3. Two and a half years after the passage of the Patriot Act, the 9/11 Commission staff confirmed that ``there is no national strategy for sharing information to counter terrorism.'' The Department of Justice has yet to explain how these Patriot Act provisions will focus the bureaucracies on identifying what information is useful to locate actual terrorists, analyzing that information, and determining what actions to take based on the information. To the contrary, the provisions essentially direct agencies simply to dump massive volumes of unanalyzed information on other agencies. They facilitate the construction of a vast intelligence data base on Americans. And they effect an extraordinary change in the capability and authority of the foreign intelligence agencies, including the CIA, to keep information on Americans. Congress should amend both sections 203 and 905 to provide some simple privacy safeguards, which will also ensure that information sharing is done in a more effective way. Current law offers no protections against abuse. Too much information may be turned over to the CIA and others, including virtually all information about any American's contacts with any foreigner or foreign group, including humanitarian organizations, for example. Existing rules provide virtually no protection against authorized government compilation of dossiers on millions of Americans and use of those dossiers in intelligence operations. Congress could provide some modest protections. The amendments proposed below--limiting shared information to information relating to terrorism or counterintelligence, limiting its dissemination to officials working on those matters, requiring judicial approval, and requiring marking to prevent redissemination--would not interfere with the needs of counterterrorism or counterintelligence. While the Justice Department claims that any modifications to the information-sharing provisions would mean that agencies ``would be required to identify proper legal authority prior to sharing or disseminating information outside of the collecting agency or community,'' such objection misses the point. See Justice Department, USA Patriot Act: Sunsets Report, April 2005. The proposed amendments would not change the legal authorities for sharing information, they would simply help ensure that information is actually analyzed and determined to be useful to counterterrorism and counterintelligence. None of the uses of information outlined by the Justice Depaitinent in its Patriot Act report would be prohibited because all of them relate to terrorism. But Congress should act to ensure that those agencies which first obtain information and are best positioned to understand its context do the work necessary to determine whether the information may be useful or relevant to other agencies. When in doubt, they should of course err on the side of transferring the information, but they should exercise some judgment in doing so. Ideally, they should describe the potential usefulness of the information when distributing it to other agencies. We note that intelligence officials are already reporting that under the current regime there is too much indiscriminate sharing of useless information. Specifically Congress should consider the following modifications. 1. When information is gathered pursuant to judicial power, the court's approval should be required before transferring the information to intelligence agencies, White House personnel, or other law enforcement agencies in order to ensure that there is some real need for more widely distributing the information. Accordingly, court approval for sharing criminal wiretap intercepts of conversations and e-mail and secret grand jury information should be obtained, except when there is no time to obtain such approval in order to prevent an imminent terrorist act or the flight of a suspect. 2. The information that should be shared with the intelligence agencies, the White House, etc., should be limited to information relevant to terrorism or counterintelligence, rather than all information concerning any foreign contacts, the vast majority of which have nothing to do with terrorism. If the information transferred by law enforcement to the intelligence community were limited to ``foreign intelligence information'' as that term is defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, it would offer some protection against the CIA and others constructing a data base on the domestic activities of Americans. This safeguard was included in the Patriot Act, H.R. 2975 (107 Cong.), as approved by the House Committee on the Judiciary in October 2001.\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ See, H.R. REP. No. 236, 107th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1(2001), at 8, available at http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/107-236p1.pdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. The information should be shared only with those officials who are directly involved in terrorism or counterintelligence. 4. There should be procedures for marking and safeguarding the shared information so these limits can be enforced and to protect against the redissemination of the information beyond these limits, much as classified information is marked and stored. Confidential grand jury information should be marked as such and intercepts of Americans' conversations and e-mails should be marked to prohibit indiscriminate circulation. CONCLUSION One of the most basic protections against government abuses has been the principle that a government agency should only collect information about individuals that it needs for a specific and articulated purpose, should use it only for the purposes for which it was collected, should not keep it any longer than necessary, and should not share it with other government agencies except for very good reasons. The Patriot Act violates that principle by adopting the approach that myriad government agencies should collect, share and maintain forever as much information on as many people as possible. Requiring the minimal protection that the government articulate why specific information could be useful for counterterrorism or counterintelligence before widely distributing it would help keep the government focused on the information needed to locate the next attackers, instead of ware- housing personal information about millions of Americans. Chairman Roberts. I now recognize the distinguished Vice Chairman. Vice Chairman Rockefeller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will follow the same procedure you have. I think it's a wise one. I'm ready to hear the witnesses. [The prepared statement of Vice Chairman Rockefeller follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. John D. Rockefeller III, Vice Chairman This week and next the Committee will hold two open hearings on the Patriot Act. The Patriot Act, which was enacted soon after the attacks of September 11, 2001, contains 10 titles. Nine of those titles are permanent law. One title of the Patriot Act--Title II on Enhanced Surveillance Procedures--has 16 provisions that will cease to have effect, or sunset, on December 31, 2005. In addition, the recently enacted Intelligence Reform Act authorizes the use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in the case of so-called ``lone wolf '' terrorists. That new authority is also subject to sunset at the end of this year. Congress should resolve two questions this year: first, on the basis of experience or further reflection since September 11, 2001, should any of the expiring authorities be amended; and second, as originally enacted or as amended, should they be made permanent? The process of evaluation of the expiring provisions is under way. In response to a request from Senator Feinstein, the Department of Justice has submitted to Congress a lengthy ``Sunsets Report'' which sets forth a case for each of the 16 provisions of the Patriot Act that will sunset at the end of this year. The Judiciary Committee has begun a series of Patriot Act hearings. It heard 2 weeks ago from the Attorney General and the FBI Director, something our Committee will do next week on April 27th. We have been informed that the Judiciary Committee plans to hold an additional hearing in May. Members of the Senate have introduced bills that propose amendments to expiring Patriot Act provisions. There are also proposals to amend other provisions of the Act. On our Committee, Senator Corzine has joined a bipartisan group of 11 Members in cosponsoring S. 737, the ``Security and Freedom Enhancement Act,'' a bill introduced by Senator Craig to amend several authorities in the Patriot Act. Senators Wyden and Corzine are cosponsors of S. 317, the ``Library, Bookseller, and Personal Records Privacy Act.'' In short, Congress has begun a serious effort to examine the expiring provisions of the Patriot Act. There were good reasons to act quickly after the September 11 attacks. Because of the need for speed then, it was wise to require, through a sunset provision, that there be a further evaluation of portions of the Act after several years of experience. We now have an opportunity to assess carefully what surveillance and search powers are needed in gathering intelligence about terrorism and other threats. I look forward to hearing testimony and working with colleagues on our Committee and on the Judiciary Committee. Our goal, of course, should be to ensure that there is a sound, long-term basis for the effective gathering of intelligence in a manner consistent with our Constitution and values. Our panel today will assist us in beginning that effort. The members of the panel--Jim Dempsey of the Center for Democracy and Technology, Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, and Gregory Nojeim of the ACLU are all distinguished participants in the public debate about the Patriot Act. I look forward to their testimony today and to next week's testimony from the Administration. In addition, the Committee has received four statements for the record: (1) from former Attorney General Edwin Meese and Paul Rosenzweig of the Heritage Foundation; (2) from former Congressman Bob Barr, chairman of a recently created coalition named Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances; (3) from Kate Martin, Director of the Center for National Security Studies; and (4) Orin Kerr, Associate Professor of Law at the George Washington University Law School. I am pleased that the Chairman has asked for and obtained unanimous consent to place these additional statements on our record of this hearing. The statements will make an important contribution to the Committee's understanding of the issues before us. I thank the authors of each and the witnesses who are here today for their assistance to the Committee. Chairman Roberts. We will go in the order of introduction. Mr. Nojeim, would you like to open up, please? [The prepared statement of Mr. Nojeim follows:] Prepared Statement of Gregory T. Nojeim Chairman Roberts, Vice Chairman Rockefeller and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to appear before you today on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union and its more than 400,000 members, dedicated to preserving the principles of the Constitution and Bill of Rights at this rare, and crucial, public oversight hearing on USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT Act) Act of 2001, Pub. L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Patriot Act was passed by Congress in 2001 just 6 weeks after the terrorist attacks of September 11. Although the act passed by wide margins, members on both sides of the aisle expressed reservations about its impact on fundamental freedoms and civil liberties. As a result, Congress included a ``sunset clause'' providing that over a dozen provisions will expire on December 31, 2005, if Congress does not act to renew them. A number of the provisions that will expire are within the jurisdiction of this committee, including some of the most controversial provisions. This statement's main focus is on those Patriot Act intelligence provisions that pose the greatest risk for civil liberties.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ This statement is adapted from a longer memorandum that examines a number of other Patriot Act and related issues in greater depth, including immigration, material witness and ``enemy combatant'' detentions, criminal ``sneak and peek'' search warrants, the crime of material support of terrorism and the definition of domestic terrorism. See Memo to Interested Persons Outlining What Congress Should Do About the Patriot Act Sunsets, March 28, 2005, available at: http:// www.aclu.org/news/NewsPrint.cfm?ID=17846&c=206. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Congress should use the upcoming debate over the renewal of parts of the Patriot Act as an opportunity to reassert its rightful role in determining law enforcement and national security policy in the post-9/ 11 context, which has waned as the power of the executive branch has waxed. Before re-authorizing any intelligence power, this committee should require the executive branch to meet the standard articulated by the bipartisan 9-11 Commission. First, Congress should re-examine the specific provisions that sunset, taking care not to renew any provision unless the government can show ``(a) that the power actually materially enhances security and (b) that there is adequate supervision of the executive's use of the powers to ensure protection of civil liberties.'' \\3\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (``The 9/11 Commission Report'') 294-95 (2004) (boldfaced recommendation) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Second, ``[i]f the power is granted, there must be adequate guidelines and oversight to properly confine its use.'' \\4\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Third, because the issues of national security and civil liberties posed by anti-terrorism powers that are not part of the Patriot Act sunset are at least as serious as any posed by those provisions that do sunset, Congress should undertake a broader review of anti-terrorism powers, both within and outside of the Patriot Act, using the same standard of review. Finally, Congress should resist efforts by the executive branch to evade searching review of its existing powers, both under the Patriot Act and under other legal authorities, by shifting the debate to new anti-terrorism legislation, such as proposals for administrative subpoenas or new death penalties. Congress may not be able to fully review or assess the effectiveness, and impact on civil liberties, of some anti-terrorism powers that the executive branch was granted in the Patriot Act. The lack of meaningful information about the use of many powers is sometimes a direct result of excessive secrecy in the executive branch, and sometimes the result of necessary secrecy. In any case where sufficient information is not available to undertake a thorough review, Congress should set a new sunset date and impose additional reporting requirements to facilitate a proper review, rather than cede those powers permanently to the executive branch. Because many domestic intelligence authorities operate in complete secrecy, this committee plays a particularly critical role in determining whether specific intelligence powers ``actually materially enhance security.'' Only an intensive and painstaking process of examining the facts regarding the use of these powers can answer that question. This committee was created in large part to perform just that function. It should not be content with general statements of the Patriot Act's usefulness or selective accounts of how certain sections have been used. Rather, we hope it will aggressively and thoroughly examine whether administration claims that certain powers are vital to the prevention of terrorism are born out by specific facts. Until now, the government has fallen short. Just last week, Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter expressed frustration at the Justice Department's inability to provide such facts even in a classified setting. ``This closed-door briefing was for specifics,'' Senator Specter explained. ``They didn't have specifics.'' \\5\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\5\\ Eric Lichtblau, Specter Voices Frustration Over Briefing on Patriot Act, N.Y. Times, Apr. 13, 2005. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- CLEAR EVIDENCE OF PATRIOT ACT ABUSES, BUT EXTENT OF PROBLEM STILL SECRET In its three and one-half years, the government has abused and misused the Patriot Act while seeking significant expansions of powers granted under the Patriot Act. Secrecy permeates the Patriot Act, particularly in its expansions of intelligence authorities. Many powers are accompanied by statutory gag orders. Moreover, the administration has taken the posture that information that is embarrassing to it must be kept secret for reasons of national security. For these reasons, it has been extremely difficult to uncover information about how the Patriot Act has been used, and even information about whether particular sections have been used at all. The ACLU has repeatedly sought this information in letters, requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and in FOIA litigation. Despite the efforts of the executive branch to cover up information about how controversial provisions of the Patriot Act have been used, some information has become public. This information is disturbing in and of itself, and may be emblematic of other abuses that have not yet become public. Appended to this testimony are some examples of abuses of intelligence powers expanded under the Patriot Act, and of the chill on the exercise of First Amendment rights that such powers can create. PATRIOT ACT INTELLIGENCE POWERS: GREATER SECRECY, LESS MEANINGFUL REVIEW In the debate over the Patriot Act, we ask the committee to pay particular attention to the most intrusive expanded intelligence surveillance techniques. Secret Records Searches Without Probable Cause or an Ability to Challenge: Library Records, Other ``Tangible Things,'' and National Security Letters Perhaps no sections of the Patriot Act have become more controversial than the sections allowing the government secretly to obtain confidential records in national security investigations-- investigations ``to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.'' National security investigations are not limited to gathering information about criminal activity. Instead, they are intelligence investigations designed to collect infounation the government decides is needed to prevent--``to protect against''--the threat of terrorism or espionage. They pose greater risks for civil liberties because they potentially involve the secret gathering of information about lawful political or religious activities that Federal agents believe may be relevant to the actions of a foreign government or foreign political organization (including a terrorist group). The traditional limit on national security investigations is the focus on investigating foreign powers or agents of foreign powers. Indeed, the ``foreign power'' standard is really the only meaningful substantive limit for non-criminal investigations given the astonishing breadth of information a government agent might decide is needed for intelligence reasons. The Patriot Act eliminated this basic limit for records searches, including the power under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to obtain with a FISA court order any records or other ``tangible things,'' and the FBI's power to obtain some records without any court review at all. Section 215 of the Patriot Act allows the government to obtain any records, e.g., library and bookseller records, medical records, genetic information, membership lists of organizations, and confidential records of refugee service organizations, as well as any other ``tangible things'' with an order from the FISC. The order is based merely on a certification by the government that the records are ``sought for'' a national security investigation and the judge is required to issue the order. The order contains an automatic and permanent gag order. Section 215 is subject to the sunset clause. Two weeks ago, the government acknowledged for the first time that Section 215 has been used, that it has been used 35 times, and that it was used to obtain credit, apartment, ISP and other records, but not library or medical records. Section 505 of the Patriot Act expanded the FBI's power to obtain some records in national security investigations without any court review at all. These ``national security letters'' can be used to obtain financial records, credit reports, and telephone, Internet and other communications billing or transactional records. The letters can be issued simply on the FBI's own assertion that they are needed for an investigation, and also contain an automatic and permanent nondisclosure requirement. Section 505 does not sunset. Although such demands never required probable cause, they did require, prior to the Patriot Act, ``specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe'' the records pertain to an ``agent of a foreign power.'' The Patriot Act removed that standard for issuing records demands in national security investigations. As a result, a previously obscure and rarely used power can now be used far more widely to obtain many more records of American citizens and lawful residents. Because the requirement of individual suspicion has been repealed, records powers can now be used to obtain entire data bases of private information for ``data mining'' purposes--using computer software to tag law abiding Americans as terrorist suspects based on a computer algorithm. These records search provisions are the subject of two court challenges by the ACLU. In Muslim Community Association of Ann Arbor v. Ashcroft, No. 03-72913 (E.D. Mich.), the ACLU has challenged section 215 of the Patriot Act First and Fourth Amendment grounds. As explained in the case example, the ACLU's challenge has uncovered serious and unconstitutional chilling effects of section 215 on the exercise of basic freedoms. The district court has not yet ruled in this case. In Doe v. Ashcroft, 334 F. Supp. 2d 471 (S.D.N.Y. 2004), a Federal district court struck down a ``national security letter'' records power expanded by the Patriot Act, agreeing with the ACLU that the failure to provide any explicit right for a recipient to challenge a national security letter search order violated the Fourth Amendment and that the automatic secrecy rule violated the First Amendment. The case is now on appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. There has been some confusion about whether Doe v. Ashcroft struck down a provision of the Patriot Act. In fact, Doe v. Ashcroft struck down, in its entirety, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2709(b), the national security letter authority for customer records of communications service providers, as amended by section 505(a) of the Patriot Act. The court referred repeatedly to the Patriot Act in its opinion. To be clear, the court invalidated all of section 505(a) of the Patriot Act. It is simply inaccurate to imply that the court's decision was unrelated to the Patriot Act, or that it did not strike down a provision of the Patriot Act. If the court's decision is sustained on appeal, section 505(a) of the Patriot Act will no longer have any force or effect.\\6\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ While the use of national security letters are secret, the press has reported a dramatic increase in the number of letters issued, and in the scope of such requests. For example, over the 2003-04 holiday period, the FBI reportedly obtained the names of over 300,000 travelers to Las Vegas, despite casinos' deep reluctance to share such confidential customer information with the government. It is not clear whether the records were obtained in part with a national security letter, with the threat of such a letter, or whether the information was instead turned over voluntarily or to comply with a subpoena. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Both FISA records demands and national security letters can be used to obtain sensitive records relating to the exercise of First Amendment rights. A FISA record demand could be used to obtain a list of the books or magazines someone purchases or borrows from the library. A FISA record demand could be used to obtain the membership list of a controversial political or religious organization. A national security letter could be used to monitor use of a computer at a library or Internet cafe under the government's theory that providing Internet access (even for free) makes an institution a ``communications service provider'' under the law. While both national security letters and FISA records demands cannot be issued in an investigation of a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident if the investigation is based ``solely'' on First Amendment activities, this provides little protection. An investigation is rarely, if ever, based ``solely'' on any one factor; investigations based in large part, but not solely, on constitutionally protected speech or association are implicitly allowed. An investigation of a temporary resident can be based ``solely'' on First Amendment activities, and such an investigation of a foreign visitor may involve obtaining records pertaining to a United States citizen. For example, an investigation based solely on the First Amendment activities of an international student could involve a demand for the confidential records of a student political group that includes United States citizens or permanent residents. The expanded scope and broader use of both FISA records demands and national security letters has exacerbated other constitutional problems with the statute under both the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment. Unlike almost every other type of subpoena or records demand, neither statute contains any explicit right to file a motion to quash the demand before a court on the ground that the demand is unreasonable or seeks privileged information. Similarly, both types of records demands bar the recipient from disclosing that the demand has been issued. This permanent secrecy order is imposed automatically, in every case, without any review by a judge, without any right to chal"
