        "text": "The 2012 United States Senate election in Maine was held on November 6, 2012, alongside a presidential election, other elections to the United States Senate in other states, as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Despite initially declaring her candidacy and being considered the favorite, popular incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Olympia Snowe unexpectedly decided to retire instead of running for reelection to a fourth term.\n\nIndependent former governor Angus King won the open seat with 52.9% of the vote against Republican Charlie Summers and Democrat Cynthia Dill. Following Independent Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman's retirement from the Senate in 2013, King became the second Independent incumbent U.S. Senator, after Vermont's Bernie Sanders. This was the first U.S. Senate race in Maine since 1988 that was not won by a Republican. This was also the first Senate election in the state since 1854 not won by a Democrat or Republican.\n\nAfter being elected, King met with Democratic Leader Harry Reid and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. He then decided to caucus with the Democratic Party. This effectively gave the Democrats a 55–45 Senate majority due to the other Independent, Bernie Sanders, caucusing with the Democrats as well.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nIncumbent Olympia Snowe won re-election to a third term in 2006 with 74.01% of the vote over Democrat Jean Hay Bright and independent Bill Slavick. Due to the unpopularity of some of Snowe's votes among conservative voters, namely for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and initial support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, there was speculation that she would face competition in the 2012 Republican primary from more conservative challengers.[1] The Tea Party Express had promised to aid in a primary against Snowe.[2] There had also been speculation that Snowe would switch parties, though she has always denied this.[3][4][5] By June 2011, Snowe had officially entered her name with signatures to run in the Republican primary, saying, she \"would never switch parties\".\n\nHowever, on February 28, 2012, Snowe announced that she would be retiring from the U.S. Senate at the end of her term, citing the \"atmosphere of polarization and 'my way or the highway' ideologies has become pervasive in campaigns and in our governing institutions\" as the reason for her retirement.[6] Her announcement opened the door for candidates from all parties, creating a much more contested 2012 election.[7]\n\nThe primary election was held on June 12.[8]\n\nRepublican primary\n\n[edit]\n\nOn ballot\n\n[edit]\n\nRichard A.

They also had concerns over past actions in sending letters to college students about voter registration requirements. A spokesperson for Summers said that he had turned over all election oversight to a deputy secretary of state, and Summers himself stated that he was not going to resign.[33] No Secretary of State or Maine Attorney General who was seeking higher office in the last 30 years has resigned.[34]\n\nSteve Woods announced on August 1 that, if elected, he would donate his entire Senate salary to Maine charities chosen by an independent committee of business and nonprofit leaders he would appoint. He encouraged Angus King to make a similar pledge; King responded through his spokesperson that he and his wife would continue to donate money to charities, and that all candidates should do so in \"the best way they feel they can.\"[35]\n\nAnti-spoiler proposal\n\n[edit]\n\nSteve Woods met with Angus King on June 13 to discuss a proposal by Woods for either man to leave the race if it appeared one or the other was not going to win, in order to avoid being a spoiler candidate. Woods specifically cited the 2010 Maine Gubernatorial election as well as the 2000 presidential election as examples of what could result from a fragmented electorate. King stated that while he had not fully considered Woods' proposal, he didn't think he was a spoiler, in that \"If I thought that, I wouldn't be running.\" Woods said that regardless of whether or not King accepted the proposal, he likely would abide by it and endorse King in late October if it appeared he would not win.[36] Woods did indeed drop out and endorsed King on November 4, stating that King had the \"highest degree of integrity to represent all Mainers\". Woods' name, however, remained on the ballot.[37]\n\nCampaign spending issues\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 13, Angus King held a press conference and stated that he would discourage campaign spending by outside groups if his opponents would agree to do the same. King criticized such spending as \"a tidal wave of anonymous campaign expenditures that distort our political process.\" His proposed agreement was modeled on a similar agreement between Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown and his opponent Elizabeth Warren, which required them, if outside money is spent on their behalf, to donate an equivalent amount of money to the charity of their opponent's choice. Democrat Cynthia Dill criticized the proposal as lacking \"detail or substance\" but added that she \"looked forward to seeing a proposed agreement.\" Republican Charles Summers did not state whether he would accept King's proposal or not but criticized King for discussing campaign finance instead of issues like the economy and government spending.[38] Andrew Ian Dodge called such an agreement \"unworkable\", while Steve Woods said he would abide by such an agreement.[39]\n\nIn a letter to King, Dill again stated that she was open to an agreement on limiting outside spending in the race, but she also called on King to support measures the candidates can take themselves to limit campaign spending. These include pledging to not finance their campaigns themselves and limiting contributions to $500. Dill also called on King to take stands on a variety of campaign finance legislation, such as the DISCLOSE Act. King told the Bangor Daily News the prior week that he does support increased disclosure requirements for super-PACs, but did not specifically say he supports the DISCLOSE Act. King is so far the only candidate to benefit from super-PAC money, as a group called icPurple Inc. spent $24,000 making an online advertisement for King. King stated that as part of his proposal, he would ask the group to take the ads down.[39]\n\nDanny Dalton stated on June 14 that he would not accept any campaign donations whatsoever, in order to assure constituents that he will represent everyone equally.[40]\n\nSteve Woods pledged to not spend more than $1.3 million on his campaign, or roughly $1 per Maine resident, including campaign donations and his own money. He stated, \"If I can't get my message out and if the public isn't interested in that message, to spend more would be egregious.\"[41]\n\nOn July 18, King was criticized for attending a fundraiser in Washington, D.C., where he raised money from PACs and other donors. Republicans said King's actions were \"the height of hypocrisy\" for speaking out against PAC money and raising it at the same time, while Cynthia Dill criticized King as an \"insider who is working the system\". King defended his actions by stating that he \"took no joy\" in them but that it was necessary for him to raise money to defend himself in the \"dogfight\" he expects. King also reiterated his support of changing campaign finance laws and said that he was making no promises to donors.[42]\n\nEndorsements\n\n[edit]\n\nFundraising\n\n[edit]\n\nCandidate (party) Receipts Disbursements Cash on hand Debt Angus King (I) $937,694 $434,250 $503,444 $37,742 Charlie Summers (R) $294,081 $174,082 $119,289 $55,000 Cynthia Dill (D) $104,512 $75,988 $28,521 $5,698 Source: Federal Election Commission[57][58]\n\nTop contributors by employer\n\n[edit]\n\n[59]\n\nAngus King Contribution Charlie Summers Contribution Cynthia Dill Contribution Lee Auto Mall $15,000 Alamo PAC $10,000 Auto Europe $2,500 Bernstein Shur $13,300 Kelly PAC $10,000 Thornton Academy $2,500 Bowdoin College $11,500 Making Business Excel PAC $5,000 Southern Maine Community College $2,500 Elevation Partners $10,000 Royal Shell Real Estate $5,000 Jones Day $2,000 Lee Auto Mall-Auburn $10,000 White Rock Distilleries $5,000 Quimby Foundation $2,000 International Union of Operating Engineers $10,000 D&G Machine Products $3,000 City of Middletown Connecticut $1,000 Spectrum Health $8,950 3M Co. $2,500 Mill to the Hill PAC $1,000 $1,000 Pierce Atwood LLP $8,500 Doyle Group $2,500 Martin's Point Health Care $8,250 Speedway Motorsports, Inc. $2,500 Eaton Peabody $6,000 Moulison North $2,500\n\nTop industries\n\n[edit]\n\n[61]\n\nAngus King Contribution Charlie Summers Contribution Cynthia Dill Contribution Retired $117,500 Leadership PACs $25,000 Lawyers/Law Firms $3,850 Lawyers/Law Firms $56,600 Misc Business $23,500 Retired $2,550 Financial Institutions $37,250 Retired $12,000 Health Professionals $2,500 Real Estate $26,600 Real Estate $6,000 Non-Profit Institutions $2,000 Automotive Industry $25,000 Manufacturing & Distributing $5,500 Women's Issues $1,500 Misc Finance $24,750 Alcohol industry $5,000 Civil Servants/Public Officials $1,250 Education $20,960 General Contractors $3,000 Leadership PACs $1,000 Misc Business $20,750 Business Services $2,750 Misc Business $500 Health Professionals $19,450 Telecommunications industry $2,500 Construction Industry $500 Insurance $16,750 Insurance $2,500 Food Industry $350\n\nPredictions\n\n[edit]\n\nSource Ranking As of The Cook Political Report[62] Tossup November 1, 2012 Sabato's Crystal Ball[63] Likely I (flip) November 5, 2012 Rothenberg Political Report[64] Likely I (flip) November 2, 2012 Real Clear Politics[65] Likely I (flip) November 5, 2012\n\nPolling\n\n[edit]\n\nPoll source Date(s)\n\nadministered Sample\n\nsize Margin of\n\nerror Charlie\n\nSummers (R) Cynthia\n\nDill (D) Angus\n\nKing (I) Other Undecided WBUR TV/MassInc Polling Group June 13–14, 2012 506 ±4.4% 23% 9% 50% 1% 17% Portland Press Herald/Critical Insights June 20–25, 2012 615 ±4% 27% 7% 55% 1% 9% Moore Consulting August 5–6, 2012 500 ±n/a 28% 8% 46% — — Portland Press Herald/Critical Insights September 12–16, 2012 618 ±4% 28% 12% 50% 3% 8% Maine People's Resource Center September 15–17, 2012 856 ±3.35% 28% 15% 44% 6% 7% Public Policy Polling September 17–18, 2012 804 ±3.5% 35% 14% 43% — 8% Rasmussen Reports September 25, 2012 500 ±4.5% 33% 14% 45% 1% 7% Pan Atlantic SMS September 24–28, 2012 400 ±4.9% 24% 12% 50% — 14% Portland Press Herald/Critical Insights October 30–31, 2012 613 ±4% 33% 11% 49% — 7% Public Policy Polling November 1–2, 2012 1,633 ±2.4% 36% 12% 50% — 2% Maine People's Resource Center November 1–3, 2012 905 ±3.26% 34% 11% 48% 5% 3%\n\nResults\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States Senate election in Maine, 2012[66] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 700,599 100.00% N/A Independent gain from Republican\n\nCounties that flipped from Republican to Independent\n\n[edit]\n\nAndroscoggin (largest city: Lewiston)\n\nAroostook (largest city: Presque Isle)\n\nCumberland (largest municipality: Portland)\n\nFranklin (largest town: Farmington)\n\nHancock (largest municipality: Ellsworth)\n\nKnox (largest municipality: Rockland)\n\nKennebec (largest city: Augusta)\n\nOxford (largest town: Rumford)\n\nPenobscot (largest city: Bangor)\n\nPiscataquis (largest municipality: Dover-Foxcroft)\n\nSomerset (largest town: Skowhegan)\n\nWashington (largest city: Calais)\n\nLincoln (Largest city: Waldoboro)\n\nWaldo (Largest city: Belfast)\n\nSagadahoc (largest town:Bath)\n\nYork (largest town:Biddeford)\n\nBy congressional district\n\n[edit]\n\nKing won both congressional districts, which both elected Democrats.[67]\n\nDistrict King Summers Dill Representative 1st 56.14% 27.95% 13.17% Chellie Pingree 2nd 49.26% 33.88% 13.36% Mike Michaud\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\n2012 United States Senate elections\n\n2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Maine\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nElections Division from the Maine Secretary of State\n\nCampaign contributions at OpenSecrets.org\n\nOutside spending at the Sunlight Foundation\n\nCandidate issue positions at On the Issues\n\nOfficial campaign websites"
