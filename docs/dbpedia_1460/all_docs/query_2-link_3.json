        "text": "The first women's rights convention in the U.S. took place in Seneca Falls, New York. Convened by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and others active in the anti-slavery movement, it resulted in a Declaration of Sentiments modeled on the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration demanded a variety of rights for women, including suffrage.\n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton was the first woman to run for the U.S. House of Representatives, even though she was not eligible to vote. She ran as an Independent from New York State, receiving 24 votes of 12,000 that were cast.\n\nVictoria Woodhull, a stockbroker, publisher, and protégé of Cornelius Vanderbilt, ran for president of the United States on the Equal Rights Party ticket.\n\nClick here for a complete list of women who have run for president and vice president.\n\nOskaloosa, Kansas became the first town in the United States known to have an all-woman government, with the mayor and entire council being female. The council included Mayor Mary D. Lowman, and Councilmembers Carrie Johnson, Sadie E. Balsley, Hanna P. Morse, Emma K. Hamilton, and Mittie Josephine Golden. One year prior, in 1887, voters in Syracuse, Kansas elected women to all five seats of the city council, but a man served as mayor.\n\nFrances Warren of Wyoming became the first woman delegate to a Republican National Convention. In the same year, Elizabeth Cohen of Utah was chosen as an alternate to the Democratic National Convention. When another delegate became ill, Cohen became the first woman delegate to a Democratic National Convention.\n\nJeannette Rankin, a Republican from Montana became the first woman ever elected to Congress. She served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1917 to 1919 and again from 1941 to 1942; a pacifist, she was the only lawmaker to vote against U.S. entry into both world wars.\n\nRebecca Latimer Felton, a Georgia Democrat, became the first woman appointed to the Senate, but only served one day. While she was a suffragist, fully embracing equality of the sexes, she was also an outspoken white supremacist and advocate of segregation who spoke out in favor of lynching.\n\nFlorence Ellinwood Allen was elected Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio, the first woman elected to the highest court in any state. She had previously been the first woman assistant county prosecutor in the country and the first woman elected to a judicial office in Ohio. Later, she became the first woman appointed to a federal appeals court judgeship.\n\nBertha K. Landes, Republican city council president at the time, became acting mayor of Seattle, the first woman to lead a major American city. Two years later she was elected mayor in her own right in a campaign run by women.\n\nIn 1925, Texas Governor Pat Neff faced a dilemma: a fraternal organization had a case before the Texas Supreme Court, but all the justices, and nearly every eligible judge and lawyer in the state, were members of the organization and were required to recuse themselves. His solution was to seat a special session of an all-woman Texas Supreme Court, consisting of Hortense Sparks Ward, Ruth Virginia Brazzil, and Hattie Lee Hennenberg. It remains the only all-woman state supreme court in history.\n\nNellie Tayloe Ross, a Wyoming Democrat, became the nation's first woman governor, elected to replace her deceased husband. She served for two years. Later, she became vice chair of the Democratic National Committee and director of the U.S. Mint. At the 1928 Democratic National Convention, she received 31 votes on the first ballot for Vice President.\n\nHattie Wyatt Caraway (D-AR), appointed in 1931 to fill a vacancy caused by her husband's death, ran for a full term and became the first woman elected to the Senate, where she served two full terms. She was the first woman to chair a Senate committee – the Committee on Enrolled Bills, a minor post.\n\nRuth Bryan Owen, a former congresswoman, became the first woman to hold a major diplomatic post when she was appointed by President Roosevelt as minister to Denmark. She held that post until 1936, when her marriage to a Dane and resulting dual citizenship made her ineligible to serve.\n\nMargaret Chase Smith (R-ME) became the first woman elected to the Senate without having first been appointed to serve. Smith had first come to Congress when elected to fill her deceased husband's House seat; she went on to be elected to the Senate in her own right. With her election to the Senate, Smith also became the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress.\n\nCharlotta Spears Bass was the first Black woman nominee for vice president in the United States. She ran on the Progressive Party ticket, which received less than one percent of the popular vote in the 1952 presidential election.\n\nConsuelo Bailey, a Vermont Republican, became the first woman ever elected lieutenant governor of a state. In that role, she served as president of the state Senate. Since she had previously served as speaker of the state House of Representatives, she thus became the only woman in the country ever to preside over both chambers of a state legislature.\n\nSenator Margaret Chase Smith, a Maine Republican, was nominated for the presidency by Vermont Senator George Aiken at the Republican national convention. Smith had campaigned briefly for the post, limiting herself to periods when the Senate was not in session. Elected to the House of Representatives in 1940 (to replace her dying husband) and the Senate in 1948, Smith had already made history by becoming the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress.\n\nPatsy Takemoto Mink, a Democrat from Hawaii, became the first woman of color and the first woman of Asian-Pacific Islander descent in the U.S. House of Representatives. She served until 1977 and was re-elected in 1990.\n\nSophia Mitchell was appointed mayor of Rendville, Ohio, becoming the first Black woman in the country known to serve as mayor of a municipality. She served for at least two more terms, although she noted in a later interview that she never ran for the position and stayed on because no one else wanted the role.\n\nCongresswoman Shirley Chisholm ran for president in the Democratic primaries. At the party's national convention, she garnered 151.25 delegate votes before Senator George McGovern clinched the nomination. At the same convention, Frances (Sissy) Farenthold, a former Texas state legislator who twice ran for governor of that state, finished second in the balloting for the Vice Presidential nomination, receiving more than 400 votes.\n\nJean Westwood was named by presidential nominee George McGovern to chair the Democratic National Committee. The first woman to hold that position, she served until just after the election, when she was replaced by Robert Strauss.\n\nCongresswoman Patsy Mink agreed to have her name appear on the Oregon presidential ballot to provide a platform to discuss opposition to the Vietnam War, force previous Democratic front-runner George McGovern to resume his antiwar focus, and hold the state’s liberal votes together until its delegates reached the convention that summer. Mink received more than five thousand votes in the Oregon primary on May 23 and smaller numbers in Maryland (573) and Wisconsin (913). She made no effort to have her name placed into nomination at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nLelia Foley-Davis was elected mayor of Taft, Oklahoma. She was widely cited in national news reports at the time as the nation's first elected Black woman mayor. While she is not technically the first (see the 1971 timeline entry on Ellen Walker Craig-Jones), she is one of the very first Black women to serve as mayor of a municipality in the country and the first Black woman to serve as mayor of an all-Black town.\n\nJulia Cooper Mack was appointed by President Gerald Ford to the DC Court of Appeals, becoming the first woman of color appointed to a court of last resort in the U.S.\n\nCongresswoman Lindy Boggs (D-LA) served as chairwoman of the 1976 Democratic National Convention, becoming the first woman to preside over a major party convention. Boggs was also the first woman elected to Congress from Louisiana and later served as United States Ambassador to the Holy See.\n\nEllen McCormack entered 20 state primaries for the Democratic presidential nomination as an anti-abortion candidate, winning 22 convention votes. She became the first woman to qualify for federal campaign matching funds and qualified for Secret Service protection. In 1980, she ran for president again as the candidate of the Right to Life Party, winning more than 30,000 votes from three states.\n\nPatricia Roberts Harris was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to serve as secretary of Housing and Urban Development during 1977-1979. From 1979-1981, she served as secretary of Health and Human Services. She was the first Black woman to serve in a presidential Cabinet and the first woman to hold two different Cabinet positions.\n\nLaDonna Harris appears to be the first Native American woman nominee for vice president in the United States. She ran on the Citizens Party ticket, which received less than one percent of the popular vote in the 1980 presidential election.\n\nFor the first time, a national party's nominating convention delegates included equal numbers of men and women. At its convention in New York, the Democratic party also added to its charter a requirement that future conventions have equal numbers of female and male delegates.\n\nSandra Day O'Connor, a former Republican state legislator from Arizona who had served on a state appeals court, was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as the first woman ever to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThird-term Congresswoman Geraldine A. Ferraro (D-NY), secretary of the House Democratic Caucus, became the first woman ever to run on a major party's national ticket when she was selected by Walter F. Mondale as his Vice Presidential running mate. The ticket was decisively defeated, capturing only 13 electoral votes, and few analysts felt that Ferraro's presence had a strong impact–positive or negative–on the outcome.\n\nEmma Wong Mar appears to be the first Asian American woman nominee for vice president in the United States. She ran on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket as running mate to Sonia Johnson. Together they received less than one percent of the popular vote in the 1984 presidential election.\n\nCongresswoman Lynn Morley Martin (R-IL) began the first of two terms as vice chair of the Republican Conference in the House, the first time a woman held an elected position in the congressional party's hierarchy.\n\nBarbara Ann Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, became the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate without previously filling an unexpired Congressional term. Combining her Senate service from 1987-2017 with her service in the US House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987, she is the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress.\n\nCongresswoman Patricia Schroeder (D-CO) made national headlines when she took preliminary steps toward making a serious run for the presidency, but she dropped out before the primaries, unable to raise the necessary funds.\n\nKay Orr, a Republican from Nebraska, was the first Republican woman elected governor of a state, as well as the first woman to defeat another woman in a gubernatorial race.\n\nIleana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican, became the first Hispanic woman and first Cuban American to be elected to Congress. She was elected in August 1989 in a special election and continues to serve.\n\nApart from single-member House delegations, the first all-woman U.S. House delegation was from Hawaii.

They were also the first all-woman of color House delegation.\n\nAlthea Garrison (R) was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, becoming the first transgender or transsexual person to serve in a state legislature in the United States.
