Yet what is it that makes the birthplace of Gucci, Cav-\n\nalli and the Vespa scooter so inspiring, so dolce (sweet)? Florence takes the lead with\n\nits artistic heritage and tradition of master craftsmanship, but Tuscan style, grace and\n\nappreciation of beauty find expression in an extraordinary attention to detail, a quest\n\nfor perfection and a dauntless pride in local dialect and history.\n\nRural Roots No title better\n\ndelves into\n\nDeeply attached to their patch of land, people in this predominantly ru-\n\nral neck of the woods, with only a dusting of small towns, are not simply the essence of\n\nItalian or Tuscan.

For most, such campanilismo (literally, ‘loyalty to one’s and the Good\n\nbell tower’) is all-consuming. ‘Better a death in the family than a Pisan Life – Making the\n\nat the door’ says an old Florentine proverb with reference to the historic Tuscan Lifestyle\n\nrivalry between the Tuscan towns.\n\nYour Own by\n\nPassionate, proud, reserved, hard-working, family-oriented, fond of Ferenc Màté.\n\nfood and wine, thrifty, extremely self-conscious and proud of their ap-\n\npearance are characteristics attributed to Tuscans across the board.

Contadini (peasants) lived and worked on\n\nthe land, receiving in return a home for their traditionally large families (typically consist-\n\ning of 10 people – the more hands the better) and 50% of the crops or profit reaped from\n\nthe land they worked. The other half went to the padrone (land owner), who often did not\n\nlive on his fattoria (agricultural estate) but in the city.\n\nPost-WWII industrialisation saw the birth of the tractor and the first shift in the equal\n\nbalance between landowner and peasant: farmers had no money to buy tractors, oblig-\n\ning owners to invest instead and so upsetting the apple cart in terms of who gave how\n\nmuch. Gradually farm workers gravitated towards towns in search of better-paid jobs,\n\nthe 1960s witnessing a particularly large exodus and prompting the eventual collapse of\n\nsharecropping and many a Tuscan farm with it.\n\nBest La Dolce Vita\n\nPasseggiata\n\nLife is dolce (sweet) for this privileged pocket of Italy, one of the coun-\n\nStrips try’s wealthiest enclaves, where the family reigns supreme, and tradition\n\nand quality trump quantity. From the great names in viticulture to the\n\nVia de’ Tornabuoni flower-producing industry of Pescia and the small-scale farms of rural\n\n& Ponte Vecchio Tuscany, it is family-run businesses handed down generations that form\n\nthe backbone of this proud, strong region.\n\n(Florence)\n\nVia Fillungo In Florence – the only city with a faint hint of the cosmopolitan – daily\n\nlife is the fastest paced. Florentines rise early, drop their kids at school by\n\n(Lucca) 8am, then flit from espresso to the office by 9am. Lunch is a lengthy af-\n\nVia Banchi di Sopra fair for these food- and wine-loving people, as is the early-evening aperi-\n\ntivo, enjoyed in a bar with friends to whet the appetite for dinner. For\n\n(Siena) younger Florentines, who bear the brunt of Florence’s ever-rising rent\n\n‘The Corso’ aka and salaries that scarcely increase, it is quite common to treat the lavish\n\naperitivo spread like dinner – enter apericena. Smokers, fast dwindling,\n\nCorso Italia puff on pavements outside.\n\n(Arezzo)\n\nThere is no better time of day or week than late Sunday afternoon to\n\nCorso Carducci witness the passeggiata (early-evening stroll), a wonderful tradition that\n\n(Grosseto) sees Tuscans in towns don a suitable outfit and walk – to get a gelato,\n\nchat, meet friends, mooch, contemplate the sunset and, quite simply, rel-\n\nish the close of the day at an exceedingly relaxed pace.\n\nTheatre, concerts, art exhibitions (the free opening on Thursday eve-\n\nnings at Florence’s Palazzo Strozzi is always packed) and il calcio (foot-\n\nball) entertain after hours. Tuscany’s top professional football club, ACF\n\nFiorentina, has a fanatical fan base (check the memorabilia in Florence’s\n\nTrattoria Mario).\n\nWeekends see many flee their city apartments for less urban climes,\n\nwhere the din of motorini (scooters) whizzing through the night lessens\n\nand there’s more space and light. Green countryside is a mere 15-minute\n\ngetaway from lucky old Florence, unlike many urban centres where in-\n\ndustrial sprawl really sprawls.\n\nCasa Dolce Casa\n\nBy their very nature, family-oriented Tuscans travel little (many live all\n\ntheir lives in the town of their birth) and place great importance on casa\n\ndolce casa (home, sweet home) – the rate of home ownership in Tuscany\n\nis among Europe’s highest.\n\nThe rural lifestyle is driven by close-knit, ancient communities in\n\nsmall towns and villages, where local matters and gossip are more im-\n\nportant than national or world affairs. Everyone knows everyone to the\n\npoint of being clannish, making assimilation for outsiders hard – if not\n\n301\n\nimpossible. Farming is the self-sufficient way of life, albeit one that is Lose yourself in The Tuscan Way of Life L a Festa\n\nbecoming increasingly difficult – hence the mushrooming of agriturismi the culinary and\n\n(farm-stay accommodation), as farmers stoically utilise every resource cultural beauty\n\nthey have to make ends meet.\n\nof the Tuscan\n\nAt one time the domain of Tuscany’s substantial population of well-off home with Emiko\n\nBrits (there’s good reason why playwright John Mortimer dubbed Chi- Davies’ Florentine\n\nanti ‘Chiantishire’ in his 1988 novel and 1989 TV adaptation Summer’s (2016), an inspi-\n\nLease), the region’s bounty of stylish stone villas and farmhouses with rational cookbook\n\nterracotta floors, wood-burning fireplaces and terraces with views are\n\nnow increasingly passing back into the hands of Tuscans eagerly redis- with exquisite\n\ncovering their countryside. photography,\n\na ‘romantic\n\nIn both urban and rural areas, children typically remain at home nostalgia’ vibe\n\nuntil they reach their 30s, often only leaving the nest to wed.

No cultural\n\nagenda is more jam-packed with ancient festivities than theirs: patron\n\nsaints alone provide weeks of celebration, given that every village, town,\n\nprofession, trade and social group has a saint to call its own and venerate\n\nreligiously.\n\nLa festa climaxes – not once but twice – with Siena’s soul-stirring Il\n\nPalio, a hot-blooded horse race conceived in the 12th century to honour\n\nthe Virgin Mary and revamped six centuries on to celebrate the miracles\n\nof the Madonna of Provenzano (2 July) and the Assumption (16 August).\n\nDeeply embroiled in its religious roots is a fierce contrada rivalry, not to\n\nmention a penchant for dressing up and a respect for tradition that sees\n\nhorses blessed before the race, jockeys riding bareback and the silk ban-\n\nner for the winner of August’s race ritually designed by Sienese artists\n\nand the July banner by non-Sienese. (Legend says that a Sienese bride\n\nmarrying in far-off lands took with her earth from her contrada to put\n\nbeneath the legs of her marital bed to ensure that her offspring would be\n\nconceived on home soil.)\n\nAlthough it’s by no means the social force it once was, Catholicism (the\n\nreligion of 85% of the region) and its rituals nevertheless play a key role\n\nCOFFEE CULTURE\n\nCoffee is not just a drink but a way of life for Tuscans, whose typical day is punctuated\n\nwith caffeine, the type of coffee depending wholly on time of day and occasion.\n\nThe number-one cardinal rule: cappuccino (espresso topped with hot, frothy milk),\n\ncaffè latte (milkier version with less froth) and latte macchiato (warmed milk ‘stained’\n\nwith a spot of coffee) are only ever drunk at breakfast or in the early morning. If you’re\n\ntruly Tuscan, though, the chances are you’ll probably grab a speed espresso (short,\n\nsharp shot of strong, black coffee) or caffè doppio (double espresso) standing up at the\n\nbar with everyone else at your favourite cafe on the way to work.\n\nLunch and dinner only end one way: with un caffè (literally ‘a coffee’, meaning an es-\n\npresso and nothing else), although come dusk it is quite acceptable to finish with un caffè\n\ncorretto (espresso with a dash of grappa or another spirit).\n\nSitting down at a table in a cafe to have a coffee is four times more expensive than\n\ndrinking it standing at the bar.\n\n302 Th e T usca n Way o f Li fe B e ll a F i g u r a in daily lives: first Communions, church weddings and religious feast\n\nTuscan days are an integral part of Tuscan society.\n\nIcons\n\nBella Figura\n\nThe Vespa scooter\n\nGucci A sense of style is vital to Tuscans, who take great pride in their dress\n\nand appearance to ensure their bella figura (good public face).

Its basic premise: don’t Tuscan\n\nwaste a crumb.\n\nIl Teatro del Sale\n\nDuring the 13th and 14th centuries, when Florence prospered and (Florence)\n\nthe wealthy started using silver cutlery instead of fingers, simplicity\n\nremained the hallmark of dishes served at lavish banquets thrown by Trattoria Mario\n\nfeuding families as a show of wealth. And while the Medici passion for (Florence)\n\nflaunting the finer things in life during the Renaissance gave Tuscan cui-\n\nsine a fanciful kick, with spectacular sugar sculptures starring alongside La Taverna di San\n\nspit-roasted suckling pig, ordinary Tuscans continued to rely on the age- Giuseppe (Siena)\n\nold cucina povera (poor dishes) to keep hunger at bay.\n\nRistorante La\n\nContemporary Tuscan cuisine remains faithful to these humble roots, Mandragola (San\n\nusing fresh local produce and eschewing fussy execution.\n\nGimignano)\n\nA Bloody Affair: Meat & Game La Bucaccia\n\n(Cortona)\n\nThe icon of Tuscan cuisine is Florence’s bistecca alla fiorentina, a char- Osteria La Porta\n\ngrilled T-bone steak rubbed with olive oil, seared on the chargrill, sea- (Val d’Orcia)\n\nsoned, and served al sangue (blue and bloody). A born-and-bred rebel,\n\nthis feisty cut of meat is weighed before it’s cooked and priced on menus\n\nper l’etto or 100g. Traditionally it is butchered from creamy Chianina\n\ncows, one of the oldest breeds of cattle, originating from the wide green\n\nVal de Chiana in eastern Tuscany.\n\nTuscan markets conjure up animal parts many wouldn’t dream of eat-\n\ning. In the past, prime beef cuts were the domain of the wealthy and offal\n\nwas the staple peasant fare: tripe was simmered for hours with onions,\n\ncarrots and herbs to make lampredetto or with tomatoes and herbs to\n\nmake trippa alla fiorentina – two classics still going strong.\n\nPasto, an ancient mix of picchiante (cow’s lungs) and chopped po-\n\ntatoes, is not even a gastronomic curiosity these days – due to lack of\n\ndemand it has died a quiet death and is no longer possible to find on\n\nrestaurant menus. Equally ancient cibrèo (chicken’s kidney, liver, heart\n\nand cockscomb stew) and colle ripieno (stuffed chicken’s neck) are both\n\nstill cooked up, though. Another golden oldie featured on many a me-\n\ndieval fresco is pollo al mattone – boned chicken splattered beneath a\n\nbrick, rubbed with herbs and baked beneath the brick. The end result is\n\nhandsomely crispy.\n\nCinghiale (wild boar), hunted in autumn, is turned into salsicce di\n\ncinghiale (wild-boar sausages) or simmered with tomatoes, pepper and\n\nherbs to create a rich stew.\n\n304 The Tuscan Table A Country Kitchen In Tuscany the family pig invariably ends up on the plate as a salty\n\nslice of soprassata (head, skin and tongue boiled, chopped and fla-\n\nBest voured with garlic, rosemary and other herbs and spices), finocchiona\n\nBistecca (fennel-spiced sausage), prosciutto, nearly black mallegato (spiked with\n\nnutmeg, cinnamon, raisins and pine kernels from San Miniato) or morta-\n\nalla della (a smooth-textured pork sausage speckled with cubes of white fat).\n\nFiorentina Lardo di colonnata (thin slices of local pork fat aged in a mix of herbs\n\nand oils for at least six months) is a treat hard to find outside Tuscany.\n\nTrattoria Mario\n\n(Florence) Best on Friday: Fish\n\nOfficina della The old Medici port of Livorno leads the region in seafood: cacciucco\n\nBistecca (Panzano (one ‘c’ for each type of fish thrown into it) is the signature dish.

Jam-packed with\n\n(La Foce) protein, cheap and available year-round (eaten fresh in summer, dried in\n\nwinter), pulses go into traditional dishes like minestra di fagioli (bean\n\nsoup), minestra di pane (bread and bean soup) and ribollita (a ‘reboiled’\n\nbean, vegetable and bread soup with black cabbage that is left to sit for\n\na day before being served).\n\nOf the dozens of bean varieties, cannellini and dappled borlotti are the\n\nmost common; both are delicious drizzled with olive oil to accompany\n\nGO SLOW TUSCANY\n\nBorn out of a desire to protect the world from McDonaldisation, Slow Food (www.fondazi\n\noneslowfood.com) preserves local food traditions and encourages interest in the food\n\nwe eat, its origins and how it tastes. Created by Italian wine writer Carlo Petrini, it works\n\nin over 130 countries and has also given rise to Slow City (www.cittaslow.blogspot.com).\n\nSlow City towns in Tuscany – Anghiari, Barga, Castelnuovo Berardenga, Civitella in Val\n\ndi Chiana, Greve in Chianti, Massa Marittima, Pratovecchio, San Miniato, San Vincenzo\n\nand Suvereto – have a visible and distinct culture; rely on local resources rather than\n\nmass-produced food and culture; work to reduce pollution; and increasingly rely on sus-\n\ntainable development, such as organic farming and public transport.\n\nIndustrialisation, globalisation and environmental dangers threaten traditional, indige-\n\nnous edibles. Enter Slow Food’s Ark of Taste, a project born and headquartered in Flor-\n\nence that aims to protect and promote endangered food products, including, in Tuscany:\n\nChianina beef, lardo di colonnata, Certaldo onions, Casola chestnut bread, Cetica red\n\npotatoes, Garfagnana potato bread and farro (spelt), Carmignano dried figs, cinta senese\n\n(the indigenous Tuscan pig), Londa Regina peaches, Pistoian Mountain pecorino cheese,\n\nOrbetello bottarga (salted mullet roe) and Zeri lamb. Among the many cured meats that\n\nmake the list: San Miniato mallegato, Prato mortadella (smooth-textured pork sausage\n\nmade dull pink with drops of alkermes liqueur and speckled white with cubes of fat),\n\nSienese buristo (a type of pork salami made in the province of Siena), Valdarno tarese\n\n(a 50cm- to 80cm-long pancetta spiced with red garlic and orange peel and covered in\n\npepper), Florentine bardiccio (fresh fennel-flavoured sausage encased in a natural skin of\n\npig intestine and eaten immediately) and biroldo (spiced blood sausage made in Garfag-\n\nnana from pig’s head and blood).\n\nSampling any of these Tuscan items guarantees an authentic tasting experience.\n\nmeat.

Still\n\nrespected, the sheep’s-milk pecorino crafted in Pienza ranks among Ita-\n\nly’s greatest pecorini: taste it young and mild with fava beans, fresh pear\n\nor chestnuts and honey, or try it mature and tangy, spiked with toscanello\n\n(black peppercorns) or as pecorino di tartufo (infused with black-truffle\n\nshavings). Pecorino massaged with olive oil during the ageing process\n\nturns red and is called rossellino.\n\nFestive Frolics: Sweets, Chocolate & Ice\n\nBe it the honey, almond and sugar-cane sweets served at the start of\n\n14th-century banquets in Florence or the sugar sculptures made to im-\n\npress at the flamboyant 16th- and 17th-century feasts of the Medici, dolci\n\n(sweets) have always been reserved for festive occasions.

Brighidini di lamporecchio are small, round an-\n\niseed-flavoured wafers; ricciarelli are almond biscuits, sometimes with\n\ncandied orange; and lardpinocchiati are studded with pine kernels. In\n\nLucca, locals are proud of their buccellato (a sweet bread loaf with sul-\n\ntanas and aniseed seeds), a treat given by godparents to their godchild\n\non their first Holy Communion and eaten with alacrity at all other times.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it was at the Florentine court of Catherine de’ Medici\n\nthat Italy’s most famous product, gelato, first appeared, thanks to court\n\nmaestro Bernardo Buontalenti (1536–1608), who engineered a way of\n\nfreezing sweetened milk and egg yolks.

Something of a viticulture\n\npowerhouse, Tuscany excites oenophiles with its myriad full-bodied,\n\nhighly respected reds. Wine tasting is an endless pleasure and the re-\n\ngion is peppered with enoteche (wine bars) and cantine (wine cellars)\n\ndesigned especially for tasting and buying.\n\nMany are planted on Tuscany’s strade del vino (wine roads): signpost-\n\ned itineraries that lead motorists and cyclists along wonderfully scenic\n\nback roads into the heart of Tuscan wine country.\n\nTuscan white amounts to one label loved by Renaissance popes and\n\nartists alike: the aromatic Vernaccia di San Gimignano, best drunk as an\n\naperitif on a terrace in or around San Gimignano.\n\nBrunello di Montalcino\n\nBrunello di Montalcino is one of Italy’s most prized wines: count on up to\n\n€15 for a glass, €30 to €100 for an average bottle and €5000 for a 1940s\n\ncollectible. The product of Sangiovese grapes grown south of Siena, it\n\nmust spend at least two years ageing in oak. It is intense and complex,\n\nwith an ethereal fragrance, and it’s best paired with game, wild boar\n\nand roasts. Brunello grape rejects go into Rossi di Montalcino, Brunello’s\n\nsubstantially cheaper but wholly drinkable kid sister.\n\nVino Nobile di Montepulciano\n\nPrugnolo Gentile grapes (a clone of Sangiovese) form the backbone of the\n\ndistinguished Vino Nobile di Montepulciano (2006 was an exceptional\n\nyear). Its intense but delicate nose and dry, vaguely tannic taste make it\n\nthe perfect companion to red meat and mature cheese.\n\nOLIVE OIL\n\nOlive oil heads Tuscany’s culinary trinity (bread and wine are the other two members)\n\nand epitomises the earthy simplicity of Tuscan cuisine: dipping chunks of bread into\n\npools of this liquid gold or biting into a slice of oil-doused fettunta (bruschetta) are sweet\n\npleasures here.\n\nThe Etruscans were the first to cultivate olive trees and press the fruit to make oil, a\n\nprocess refined by the Romans. As with wine, strict rules govern when and how olives are\n\nharvested (October to December), the varieties used, and so on.\n\nThe best Tuscan oils wear a Chianti Classico DOP or Terre di Siena DOP label and an\n\nIGP certificate of quality issued by the region’s Consortium of Tuscan Olive Oil.

It was more famous than\n\ngood in the 1970s, but contemporary Chianti gets the thumbs up from\n\nLe Volpi e l’Uva wine critics today. Produced in seven subzones from Sangiovese and a\n\n(Florence) mix of other grape varieties, Chianti Classico – the traditional heart of\n\nIl Santino this long-standing winegrowing area – is the best known, with a DOCG\n\n(Florence) (Denominazione d’Origine Controllata e Garantita; Protected Designa-\n\ntion of Origin and Quality) guarantee of quality and a Gallo Nero (Black\n\nL’Enoteca Marcucci Cockerel) emblem that once symbolised the medieval Chianti League.\n\n(Pietrasanta) Young, fun Chianti Colli Senesi from the Siena hills is the largest sub-\n\nzone; Chianti delle Colline Pisane is light and soft in style; and Chianti\n\nEnoteca Tognoni Rùfina comes from the hills east of Florence.\n\n(Bolgheri)\n\nSuper Tuscans\n\nEnoteca Osteria\n\nOsticcio One result of Chianti’s ‘cheap wine for the masses’ reputation in the\n\n1970s was the realisation by some Tuscans – including the Antinoris,\n\n(Montalcino) Tuscany’s most famous wine-producing family – that wines with a rich,\n\nCantina Nardi complex, internationally acceptable taste following the New World tra-\n\ndition of blending mixes could be sold for a lot more than local wines.\n\n(Livorno) Thus, innovative, exciting wines were developed and cleverly marketed\n\nto appeal to buyers both in New York and in Florence. And when an\n\nEnglish-­speaking scribe dubbed the end product ‘Super Tuscans’, the\n\nname stuck. (Italian winemakers prefer the term IGT – indicazione ge-\n\nografica tipica.) Sassacaia, Solaia, Bolgheri, Tignanello and Luce are all\n\nsuper-hot Super Tuscans.\n\nMore and more international wine producers are turning to Tuscan\n\nsoil to blend Super Tuscans and other modern wines.

Divided into three parts – Inferno, Purgatorio\n\nand Paradiso – The Divine Comedy delivered an allegorical vision of the\n\nafterlife that made an immediate and profound impression on readers\n\nand, through its wide-reaching popularity, established the Tuscan dialect\n\nas the new standardised form of written Italian.\n\nAnother early adaptor to the new language of literature was Giovanni\n\nBoccaccio (1303–75), who hailed from Certaldo. His masterpiece, Decam-\n\neron, was written in the years following the plague of 1348. A collection\n\nof 100 allegorical tales recounted by 10 characters, it delivered a vast pan-\n\norama of personalities, events and symbolism to contemporary readers\n\nand was nearly as popular and influential as The Divine Comedy.\n\nThe remaining member of the influential triumvirate that laid down\n\nthe course for the development of a rich literature in Italian was Petrarch\n\n(Francesco Petrarca; 1304–74), born in Arezzo to Florentine parents. Al-\n\nthough most of his writings were in Latin, he wrote his most popular\n\nworks, the poems, in Italian. Il canzoniere (Songbook; c 1327–68) is the\n\ndistilled result of his finest poetry. Although the core subject is his un-\n\nrequited love for a woman named Laura, the breadth of human grief\n\nand joy is treated with a lyrical quality unseen until then. His influence\n\nspread far and across time: the Petrarchan sonnet form, rhyme scheme\n\nand even subject matter was adopted by English metaphysical poets of\n\n17th-century England such as John Donne.\n\nAnother outstanding writer of this period was Niccolò Machiavel-\n\nli (1469–1527), known above all for his work on power and politics, Il\n\nPrincipe (The Prince; 1532).\n\n311\n\n19th Century Onwards Americans Tuscany on Page & Screen Tuscany in Print\n\nAbroad\n\nAfter its stellar start during the Renaissance, Tuscany took a literary\n\nbreak in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The Galleria Palatina,\n\nbasic template was simple: a stark nave stripped of extra columns ending in Palazzo Pitti\n\na domed apse, surrounded by chapels usually donated by wealthy patrons. (Florence)\n\nIn the 11th century the Romanesque style acquired a distinctly Tuscan\n\ntwist in Pisa, when the coloured marble banding and veneering of the\n\ncity’s duomo (cathedral) set a new gold standard for architectural decora-\n\ntion. This new style (sometimes described as Pisan) was then applied to\n\na swath of churches throughout the region, including the Chiesa di San\n\nMiniato al Monte in Florence, and the Chiesa di San Michele in Foro and\n\nthe Cattedrale di San Martino, both in Lucca.\n\n314 Art & Architecture The Middle Ages: the Rise of the Comune Siena was not about to be outdone in the architectural stakes by its rivals\n\nBest Gothic Florence and Pisa, and so in 1196 its city council approved a no-expenses-­\n\nChurches spared program to build a new duomo.

Comuni (local governments) were formed to represent\n\nthe various interests of merchants, guilds and competing noble families,\n\nand the first order of business in major medieval cities, such as Siena,\n\nFlorence and Volterra, was the construction of an impressive town hall\n\nto reflect the importance and authority of the comune.\n\nIn addition to being savvy political lobbyists and fans of grand archi-\n\ntectural projects that kept their constituents gainfully employed, medi-\n\neval comuni were masters of propaganda, and perfectly understood the\n\ninfluence that art and architecture could wield. A case in point is Ambro-\n\ngio Lorenzetti’s Allegories of Good and Bad Government fresco series in\n\nSiena’s Palazzo Comunale, which is better and bigger than any political\n\nbillboard could ever be. In the Allegory of Good Government, Lorenzetti’s\n\ngrey-bearded figure of Legitimate Authority is surrounded by an entou-\n\nrage that would certainly put White House interns to shame: Peace, For-\n\ntitude, Prudence, Magnanimity, Temperance and Justice. Above them flit\n\nFaith, Hope and Charity, and to the left Concord sits confidently on her\n\nthrone while the reins of justice are held taut overhead.\n\nNext to this fresco is another depicting the effects of good government:\n\ntownsfolk make their way through town in an orderly fashion, pausing to\n\ndo business, greet one another and dance a merry jig. But things couldn’t be\n\nmore different in the Allegory of Bad Government, where horned and fanged\n\nTyrannia rules over a scene of chaos surrounded by winged vices, and Justice\n\nlies unconscious, her scales shattered. Like the best campaign speeches, this\n\ncautionary tale was brilliantly rendered but not always heeded.\n\nOn the World Stage\n\nWhen they weren’t busy politicking, late-medieval farmers, craftspeople\n\nand merchants did quite well for themselves.

The local version often featured a simple Maria (Arezzo)\n\nlayout and striped stone naves fronted by multilayer birthday-cake fa-\n\ncades, which might be frosted with pink paint, glittering mosaics and\n\nrows of arches capped with sculptures. The most famous example of this\n\nconfectionery approach is the duomo in Siena.\n\nThe evolution from solid Romanesque to airy Gothic to a yin-and-yang\n\nbalance of the two can be witnessed in buildings throughout the region,\n\nmany of which blend a relatively austere Romanesque exterior with high\n\nGothic drama indoors. This set a new ecclesiastical architecture standard\n\nthat was quickly exported into Italy at large and on to the rest of Europe.\n\nDark Times\n\nBy the 14th century the smiling Sienese townsfolk of Ambrogio Lorenzet-\n\nti’s Allegory of Good Government must have seemed like the figment of a\n\nfertile imagination. After a major famine in 1329 and then a bank collapse,\n\nSiena’s comune went into debt to maintain roads, continue work on the\n\nduomo, help the needy and jump-start the local economy. But just when\n\nthe city seemed set for a comeback, the plague brought devastation in 1348.\n\nThree-quarters of Siena’s population – including Pietro and Ambrogio\n\nLorenzetti – died, and virtually all economic and artistic activity ground to\n\na halt. Another plague hit in 1374, killing 80,000 Sienese, and was swiftly\n\nfollowed by a famine. It was too much – the city never entirely recovered.\n\nFlorence was also hit by the plague in 1348, and despite fervent public\n\nprayer rituals, 96,000 Florentines died in just seven months. Those who\n\nGIOTTO DI BONDONE\n\nThe 14th-century Tuscan poet Giovanni Boccaccio wrote in the Decameron that his fellow\n\nTuscan Giotto di Bondone (c 1266–1337) was ‘a genius so sublime that there was nothing\n\nproduced by nature…that he could not depict to the life’.\n\nBoccaccio wasn’t the only prominent critic of the time to consider Giotto extraordinary\n\n– Giorgio Vasari was also a huge fan, arguing that Giotto initiated the ‘rebirth’ (rinascità or\n\nrenaissance) in art. In his paintings, Giotto abandoned popular conventions such as the\n\nthree-quarter view of head and body, and presented his figures from behind, from the side\n\nor turning around, just as the story demanded. Giotto had no need for lashings of gold\n\npaint and elaborate ornamentation to impress the viewer with the significance of the sub-\n\nject. Instead, he enabled the viewer to feel the dramatic tension of a scene through a natu-\n\nralistic rendition of figures and a radical composition that created the illusion of depth.\n\nGiotto’s important works in Tuscany include an altarpiece portraying the Madonna\n\nand Child among angels and saints in Florence’s Galleria degli Uffizi, a painted wooden\n\ncrucifix in the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella and frescoes in the Basilica di Santa Croce.\n\nHis magnificent Life of St Francis fresco cycle graces the walls of the upper church of the\n\nBasilica di San Francesco in Assisi, Umbria.\n\n316 A rt & A rc h itec t u re T h e R e nai s s anc e survived experienced a crisis of faith, making Florence fertile territory\n\nMasaccio’s for humanist ideals – not to mention macabre superstition, attempts to\n\nTrinity, a wall raise the dead, and a fascination with corpses that the likes of Leonardo\n\nda Vinci would call science and others morbid curiosity.\n\npainting in the\n\nBasilica di Santa At the plague’s end, a Florentine building boom ensued when upstart\n\nMaria Novella in merchants such as Cosimo I de’ Medici (Cosimo the Elder) and Palla\n\nFlorence, is often Strozzi competed to put their stamp on a city that needed to be reima-\n\ndescribed as one gined after the horrors it had undergone.\n\nof the founding\n\nworks of Renais- The Renaissance\n\nsance painting\n\nand the inspira- It wasn’t only merchants who were jockeying for power at this time.

Giotto – often described as the founding artist\n\nof the Renaissance – had been commissioned to design the city’s iconic\n\n85m-tall square campanile (bell tower) and one-up the 57m-tall tower\n\nunder construction in Ghibelline Pisa that was already looking a bit off\n\nkilter. And this was only one of many such projects.\n\n‘Mess with Florence, and you take on Rome’ was the not-so-subtle hint\n\ndelivered by Florentine architects, who made frequent reference to the\n\nglories of the ancient power and its classical architecture when designing\n\nthe new churches, palazzi and public buildings that started sprouting\n\nacross the city during the Trecento (14th century) and proliferated in the\n\nQuattrocentro (15th century). This new Florentine style became known\n\nas Renaissance or ‘rebirth’, and it really started to hit its stride after archi-\n\ntect Filippo Brunelleschi won a competition to design the dome of Flor-\n\nence’s duomo. Brunelleschi was heavily influenced by the achievements\n\nof the classical masters, but he was able to do something that they hadn’t\n\nFILIPPO BRUNELLESCHI\n\nMany Renaissance men left their mark on Florence, but few did so with as much grace\n\nand glory as Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446). An architect, mathematician, engineer\n\nand sculptor, Brunelleschi trained as a master goldsmith and showed early promise as a\n\nsculptor – he was an entrant in the 1401 competition to design the doors of the baptistry\n\nin Florence (won by fellow goldsmith Lorenzo Ghiberti) and shortly after travelled to\n\nRome with Donatello, another goldsmith by training, to study that city’s ancient archi-\n\ntecture and art. When he returned to Florence in 1419 he took up an architectural com-\n\nmission from the silk merchant’s guild to design a hospital for foundlings on Piazza della\n\nSantissima Annunziata in San Marco. Known as the Ospedale degli Innocenti (Hospital\n\nof the Innocents – today a stunning museum), his classically proportioned and detailed\n\nbuilding featured a distinctive nine-arched loggia and was a radical departure from the\n\nHigh Gothic style that many of his artistic contemporaries were still embracing. Its de-\n\nsign was sober, secular and sophisticated, epitomising the new humanist age.\n\nIn 1419, after completing his work on the foundling hospital, Brunelleschi moved on\n\nto a commission that was to occupy him for the next 42 years – the dome of Florence’s\n\nduomo. His mathematical brain and talent for devising innovative engineering solutions\n\nenabled him to do what many Florentines had thought impossible: deliver the largest\n\ndome to be built in Italy since antiquity.\n\nBrunelleschi’s other works in Florence include the Basilica di San Lorenzo, the Basilica\n\ndi Santo Spirito and the Cappella de’ Pazzi in the Basilica di Santa Croce. Vasari said of\n\nhim: ‘The world having for so long been without artists of lofty soul or inspired talent,\n\nheaven ordained that it should receive from the hand of Filippo the greatest, the tallest,\n\nand the finest edifice of ancient and modern times, demonstrating that Tuscan genius,\n\nalthough moribund, was not yet dead’.

Born in Arezzo, he gew up in what is now the small but fascinating house museum\n\nMuseo di Casa Vasari. He later trained as a painter in Florence, working with artists such\n\nas Andrea del Sarto and Michelangelo (he idolised the latter). As a painter, he is best\n\nremembered for his floor-to-ceiling frescoes in the Salone dei Cinquecento in Florence’s\n\nPalazzo Vecchio. As an architect, his most accomplished work was the elegant loggia of\n\nthe Galleria degli Uffizi (he also designed the enclosed, elevated corridor that connected\n\nthe Palazzo Vecchio with the Uffizi and Palazzo Pitti and was dubbed the ‘Corridoio Vasari-\n\nano’ in his honour). But posterity remembers him predominantly for his work as an art\n\nhistorian. His Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects, from Cimabue\n\nto Our Time, an encyclopaedia of artistic biographies published in 1550 and dedicated\n\nto Cosimo I de’ Medici, is still in print (as The Lives of the Artists) and is full of wonderful\n\nanecdotes and gossip about his artistic contemporaries in 16th-century Florence.\n\nMemorable passages include his recollection of visiting Donatello’s studio one day to\n\nfind the great sculptor staring at his extremely lifelike statue of the Prophet Habakkuk\n\nand imploring it to talk (we can only assume that Donatello had been working too hard).\n\nVasari also writes about a young Giotto painting a fly on the surface of a work by Cima-\n\nbue that the older master then tried to brush away.\n\nuniformly admired until the Medicis were ousted by Savonarola in 1494.

Conversely, trends from northern\n\nEurope (Impressionism, plein-air painting and Romanticism) became\n\ntrendy among Italian artists, as witnessed in the collection at Florence’s\n\nGalleria d’Arte Moderna in the Palazzo Pitti, which is dominated by\n\nlate-19th-century works by artists of the Tuscan Macchiaioli school (the\n\nlocal equivalent of Impressionism). These include Telemaco Signorini\n\n(1835–1901) and Giovanni Fattori (1825–1908).\n\nIn architecture, the most fascinating case of artistic import–export is\n\nItalian art nouveau, often referred to as Liberty after the London store that\n\nput William Morris’ Italian-inspired visual ideals into commercial action.\n\n324 A rt & A rc h itec t u re T HE 2 0 T H C E N T U R Y The 20th Century\n\nBest After centuries under the thumbs of popes and sundry imperial powers,\n\nSculpture Tuscany had acquired a certain forced cosmopolitanism, and local art-\n\nists could identify with Rome, Paris and other big cities in addition to\n\nParks their own contrada (neighbourhood).

In the field of sculpture, Pistoia’s Marino Marini (1901–80) drew on\n\nBest Tuscany’s Etruscan heritage in his work, developing a strong equestrian\n\nModern theme – nudes and men on horseback are what Marini did best.\n\nArt In the 1980s there was a return to painting and sculpture in a tradition-\n\nMuseums al (primarily figurative) sense.

Bartolini has also changed the local flora of\n\nthe tiny Tuscan town of Cecina, near Livorno, where he lives and works,\n\nattracting colourful flocks of contemporary-art collectors and curators.\n\nThe bijou town of Pietrasanta in the hinterland of the Versilian coast in\n\nnorthwestern Tuscany has a vibrant arts community and is home to the\n\nmuch-lauded Colombian-born sculptor Fernando Botero (b 1932). In the\n\nVal d’Orcia, Volterra’s homegrown sculptor Mauro Staccioli (b 1937) encour-\n\nages visitors to admire the landscape from an alternative perspective with\n\nhis series of monumental geometric installations scattered around town.\n\nAlso notable is San Gimignano’s Galleria Continua, a world-class com-\n\nmercial gallery whose portfolio of artists includes Tuscans Giovanni Ozzola\n\n(b 1982) and Luca Pancrazzi (b 1961).

Make the pilgrimage to Assisi\n\n(p284) to see his Life of St Francis fresco\n\ncycle.\n\nFra’ Angelico (c 1395–1455)\n\nFew artists are saints – they’re far more\n\nlikely to be sinners. One of the exceptions\n\nwas Il Beato Angelico, who was canon-\n\nised in 1982. His best-loved work is the\n\nAnnunciation, versions of which are on\n\ndisplay in Florence’s Museo di San Marco\n\n(p88) and Cortona’s Museo Diocesano\n\n(p282).\n\nDuccio di Buoninsegna\n\n(c 1255–1318)\n\nHead honcho of the Sienese school,\n\nhe’s known for his riveting Madonnas\n\nwith level gazes and pale-green skin\n\nagainst glowing gold backgrounds.
