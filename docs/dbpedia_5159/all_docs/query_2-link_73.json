        "text": "BEFORE the Coens, the Hugheses, the Quays, the Wachowskis and the Farrellys, there were the Tavianis, Paolo (born in 1931) and Vittorio (born in 1929): the greatest cinematic brother act since Louis and Auguste Lumière, who pretty much invented the movies just over a century ago. And when the Tavianis are at their best -- in pictures like ''Padre Padrone'' (1977), ''The Night of the Shooting Stars'' (1982), ''Kaos'' (1984) and ''Elective Affinities'' (1996) -- they seem very much like the Lumières: the images and sounds they capture are so strange, so fresh and so unaccountably beautiful that you can almost believe that they, too, were present at the creation.\n\nThis is a fanciful notion, of course, but the Tavianis' films tend to stimulate the remoter stretches of the imagination. That's where their art flourishes -- in the wild outbacks of history, where the air is charged with myth, folklore and fairy tale. It's a hard place to get to, and, as the Museum of Modern Art's coming retrospective of the brothers' work (Nov. 15-29) demonstrates, the Tavianis themselves took a while to find their way.\n\nAlthough they began making feature films in 1962, their movies didn't make much of an impression on international audiences until nearly a decade later. The Italian cinema was bursting with new talent in the late 50's and early 60's. Among the directors who made their debuts between 1958 and 1965 were Pier Paolo Pasolini, Francesco Rosi, Ermanno Olmi, Marco Bellocchio, Gillo Pontecorvo and a young prodigy named Bernardo Bertolucci. In that company the Tavianis' first efforts could only have looked ordinary.\n\nBut in 1971 they did their first literary adaptation, uprooting a Tolstoy story and replanting it in their native land, and began to develop their own unmistakable style. ''St. Michael Had a Rooster'' is a fairly insufferable picture -- its hero, a mad late-19th-century radical clinging obstinately to his revolutionary ideas, comes off as a narcissistic bore -- but it's partly redeemed by the boldness and blunt elegance of its visual ideas. The strongest sequence, a botched guerrilla raid filmed in precisely choreographed long shots, is an early indication of the Tavianis' distinctive approach to violence. Human conflict, seen from the unnerving distance at which they place their camera, becomes a kind of tragic slapstick: stirring, messy, laughably awful.\n\nTheir next film, ''Allonsanfan'' (1974), picked up the rich, unstable tone of that sequence and ran with it -- ran amok, I'm tempted to say. ''Allonsanfan,'' which is set in Italy just after the Napoleonic wars, is so rife with invention that it's barely coherent, but it's a much sprightlier take on political drama than the often lugubrious ''St. Michael.'' The hero, Fulvio (Marcello Mastroianni), is a leader of a ragtag revolutionary cult that calls itself the Sublime Brotherhood, and, like most of the Tavianis' protagonists, he suffers from a divided conscience. He can't quite make up his mind whether he wants to be a freedom fighter or a pampered aristocrat. It's a tough choice, because both his highborn family and the high-minded Sublime Brothers are deeply ridiculous -- a point driven home by the berserk musical numbers the Tavianis stage for each group. ''Allonsanfan'' turns politics into farce, a comic orgy of misapprehensions and betrayals that ends, inevitably, in the hero's betrayal of himself and a death that hinges on nothing more significant than a stupid mistake.\n\nErratic as these transitional films are, they are evidence of the filmmakers' originality and independent-mindedness: although the Tavianis are unambiguously ''men of the left'' (as the Europeans say), they are bracingly unsentimental about revolution and those who espouse it. And their next picture, ''Padre Padrone,'' showed an equally heartening disinclination to romanticize peasants; the intellectually and morally stunted Sardinian shepherds of that film are no one's idea of the salt of the earth. ''Padre Padrone,'' adapted from the autobiography of the linguist Gavino Ledda, was the Tavianis' artistic breakthrough, the film in which all the audacious, sometimes half-baked experiments of their previous movies triumphantly paid off.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
