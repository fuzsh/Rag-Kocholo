        "text": "Jean-Jacques Rousseau (Author)\n\nRousseau was both a reader and a critic of Montesquieu. Like Montesquieu he developed a theory of ideal government where to some significant degree the people would be sovereign. Both influenced the French and American Revolutions.\n\nThomas Jefferson (Author)\n\nJefferson was a careful reader of Montesquieu and took extensive notes in his Commonplace Book on Montesquieu’s political accounts and theories.\n\nEdmund Burke (Author)\n\nBurke often cites Montesquieu favorably, and his views on encouraging liberty in government mirror many of Montesquieu’s own ideas.\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville (Author)\n\nTocqueville was heavily influenced by Montesquieu and framed his understanding of what will make democracy stable around Montesquieu’s ideas.\n\nJames Madison (Author)\n\nMadison was also a careful reader of Montesquieu, and as Publius cite him in The Federalist Papers."
