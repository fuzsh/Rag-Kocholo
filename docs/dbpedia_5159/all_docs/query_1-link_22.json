        "text": "Jenny Matthews\n\nWhen or what made you decide to specialise in painting flowers?\n\nI have had an interest in wild flowers since childhood holidays in the Scottish Highlands. When I was studying Drawing and Painting at Edinburgh College of Art, I chose to take Botanical Illustration as an elective subject. Dame Elizabeth Blackadder taught this at Edinburgh’s Royal Botanic Garden. Therefore much of my work at college was flower-based, and it’s a subject I never tire of. Fortunately people enjoy my paintings, so I am able to pursue this interest.\n\n‘A Little Bird Told Me’\n\nAs a mother of two and a highly sought after artist, how do you fit it all into 24 hour day?\n\nMy studio is on the top floor of our townhouse, so my commute time is very short! Once everyone has gone off in the morning I can go up there to work in peace until late afternoon when the family starts to return. Of course, a typical day is also interspersed with other more domestic duties, but I thrive on limited time and deadlines.\n\nWhen did you take the risk of turning the pretty into the pretty amazing and developing your own style?\n\nI was fortunate that from my first exhibition during my degree show people were buying my paintings. My style is constantly evolving because I enjoy exploring new ideas and methods. Although I do not seek to paint what I know will sell, I am aware that if I take an avenue which results in me ceasing to sell work, then I cannot justify spending my days creating art which remains unsold. There is a balance between creating intuitively and earning a living. I am fortunate that what I paint does not compel me to live in a garret.\n\n‘Tortoishell and Dahlia’\n\nCan you discuss the ‘splodge’ backgrounds to your work?\n\nWatercolour is a wonderful medium in itself, regardless of the subject matter being described. The effects it creates as it dries are fascinating and it results in curious abstractions. The colours for my backgrounds often come from nature: sky, light effects, combinations of colours glimpsed together ... and I like to celebrate the characteristics of watercolour whilst depicting a subject literally.\n\nButterflies –sketches from France with paint\n\nDiscuss the composition of two or three paintings?\n\n‘Tarves Sampler’ (63 x 71 cm) is a still life which incorporates a family heirloom. This sampler was stitched in 1866 by my great grandmother who lived in Aberdeenshire in a small village called Tarves. I am always on the lookout for interesting bits and pieces which can spark an idea. My still lives are not literally set up in front of me as I work, but the components are put down in a sketch and brought together using colour, in this case coming from the sampler, to become a painting. ‘Tarves Sampler’ was painted in the spring, so I used some early miniature irises which I had in the studio to accompany the sampler.\n\n‘Traves Sampler’\n\n‘Flight of the Butterflies’ (90 x 120 cm) shows some life size irises from my garden. I never work from photographs, so sometimes I either cut the flowers and bring them into the studio, or work outside, depending on the weather of course. Here, I experimented with some graphite pencil in the background to create some texture.\n\n‘Flight of the Butterflies’\n\n‘Knock Me Down with a Feather’ (63 x 53cm) was for an exhibition called ‘In the Company of Birds’ in central Edinburgh. I explored various themes to do with birds, including feathers. Because I was outdoors looking for feathers, wild flowers seemed a natural choice to be included. These flowers were all sketched in Scotland.\n\n’Knock Me Down with a Feather’\n\n‘Wet Weather Tulips’ (86 x118 cm). This painting of life-size tulips was created from some paintings I made in the garden in 2012. It was a very wet spring and a bad year for tulips. The background represents the showers of rain which cut short my painting!\n\n‘Wet Weather Tulips’\n\nYou also travel – how do you record during your travel?\n\nOne of my current interests is butterflies and insects and I take a small cartridge sketch book and coloured pencils with me when I go travelling, not to mention my binoculars. Sometimes I visit an area with the intention of finding subjects: wildlife reserves for example, although we have very few species of butterfly in Scotland. In the summer of 2013 in France I spent a lot of time sketching butterflies and saw about 12 ‘new’ ones: capturing their movements and attitudes is important, and I try to do as many sketches as I can so that I have plenty of material to use later in paintings.\n\nButterfly sketches in France\n\nIf heading out to neighbours’ gardens can also be considered ‘travel’, then I take an Imperial sized piece of watercolour paper prepared on a board, my paints and palette and a stool to paint on location. I have a friend close by who has an enormous collection of tulips which fill her garden every May. If I’m out walking in the hills then I will usually have a sketch book and binoculars in case I see something interesting.\n\nAnn’s Garden\n\nYou do many commissions. Can you discuss how you have developed this part of your work?\n\nCommissions form an important part of my work and they are requests from people who have a space to fill of a particular size/ want their collection of garden flowers brought together in one painting/ have seen a painting which has already sold or have a favourite flower they wish depicted. The commissions are very often to be gifts for weddings or special birthdays. However, customers are never obliged to purchase the finished painting if they are in any way disappointed, so this removes a potential obstacle.\n\nMany would not expect that you would do commission of wedding Bouquets and other simple domestic requests, explain this aspect of your commissions?\n\nI enjoy the challenge of finding a way to fulfil a customer’s requests while remaining true to myself. Occasionally I have been asked to paint something which I’m not comfortable with and in this case I don’t accept the commission: I need to be able to create a painting which is still a ‘Jenny Matthews’, and that is normally what the client wishes too so they’re never too prescriptive in their brief. It’s interesting to discover what people are looking for in a painting, and to be party to that.\n\n‘Wild Bouquet Strathdon’\n\nYou say you don’t like ‘bitty flowers’ - can you expand on this comment?\n\nI am attracted to flowers with strong silhouettes and forms. I will sometimes incorporate a ‘bitty’ flower, for example Forget Me Not, into a painting, and the juxtaposition of different scales and forms can work really well in a composition, but if I painted only what I am attracted to then I would always go for irises or tulips and other bold forms! Wild flowers tend to be ‘bitty’ too, but I love painting them.\n\nDiscuss the influence Dame Elizabeth Blackadder has had on your work as a tutor and mentor?\n\nElizabeth lives in Edinburgh, as I do, and I remember when I first heard of her when I was still at high school. Subsequently, when I was at art college, I was steered towards her botanical illustration course. From then on she was hugely influential to me: not only because she worked alongside us as we worked, but also because she uses watercolour which I love above all other media. Elizabeth unashamedly paints beautiful things for their own sake, and creates decorative images which give pleasure to the viewer, and I admire that. She is also someone I can get along with and feel comfortable with, which obviously helps.\n\nYou are not restricted to the demands of formal botanical painting. Can you discuss this?\n\nBotanical artists are required to measure and record with perfect accuracy the flowers they paint. Their work is used in identification, so accuracy is of the utmost importance. What I enjoy is the ‘character’ of the plant, and trying to record my response to it.\n\n‘One Moth’\n\nYou are not afraid to leave the ink and crayon marks on your work rather allowing these to take a part in your work, explain this?\n\nWhat I like to see in a piece is how it came into being: the process and some evidence of the creator’s hand. It’s ‘paint’ as well as ‘a painting’.\n\nYou now also teach. Can you expand on your teaching?\n\nI have actually given up teaching in any regular way. I don’t really have time any more, although I do occasionally give one-to-one tutorials in my studio. I used to teach adult classes in Botanical painting, watercolour and drawing in the days when I had more time and less success (or should that be children?)!\n\nDo you exhibit beyond the UK?\n\nNot yet! Exhibiting beyond the UK is an ambition of mine and something which I am pursuing! Any suggestions?\n\n‘Birds of a Feather’\n\nDo you see a strong relationship between the fragility of watercolour and flowers?\n\nThis is me speaking as a Scot in a Scottish climate! However, I do feel that watercolour lends itself to the depiction of flowers more than other media.\n\nYour format is not in bowls rather as if the flowers have just been picked and scattered on the table. Explain this approach?\n\nIt’s a continuation of botanical illustration, with my own take on the tradition. Durer, one of my favourite artists, did the same. I like the idea of painting a flower’s portrait.\n\n‘Where the Wild things Grow’\n\nContact details:\n\njennymatthews@blueyonder.co.uk\n\nwww.jennymatthews.co.uk\n\nJenny Matthews, Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nInterview by Deborah Blakeley, November 2013\n\nby Deborah Blakeley\n\nJohn Wheeldon\n\nCan you expand on several aspects of your ceramic work and how you use these techniques?\n\nCopper Matt\n\nDuring the 1980’s I had developed a way of working that involved applying precious metal lustres to both the surface of a textured black stoneware clay and to a translucent white porcelain. The lustres were applied using hand-cut rubber stamps and the designs built area by area until the piece was finished. These techniques resulted in an important body of work for me and were successful both creatively and commercially. I eventually reached a point, however, where I felt the creative development of what I was making had slowed to where it was becoming rather repetitive and needed a new direction.\n\nI found this in Copper Matt Raku which was a very different way of working to what I had been used to. It involved real fire and smoke and an unpredictability that was appealing after many years of formal pattern making.\n\nI had been shown the Copper Matt process by a friend who had seen it in America and I sensed that this was a new road to explore with scope for substantial development and refinement.\n\nMany months of practice, note taking, failures and increasing successes followed and as a result I stopped making the lusterware and became a Raku potter specialising in Copper Matt pieces.\n\nCopper Matt is essentially a Raku process using a simple glaze composed of Copper oxide with an addition of ten percent Alkaline Frit. The difficulties involved in producing it however occur in the firing.\n\nSuccess relies on very close control of all the variables involved in the firing and relies on being able to repeat every time the correct formula.\n\nI continued to make the work for several years but became aware that I again needed a new creative impetus as I had taken the Copper Matt as far as I could and I felt it was becoming repetitive.\n\nThe new idea dawned as I was conducting a workshop in Norway. One of the students was working with terra sigillata and was also aware of the work I had done with lustres in the 80’s. She asked me if lustre would work on Raku fired Terra Sig. My initial reaction was that I didn’t think so but we would give it a try. The results were encouraging, not amazing but definitely containing the seeds of a possible new investigation.\n\nOn the flight home I made plans to develop this further. I had the raku techniques, I had the forms and I had the lustre tools and materials, all I needed was Terra Sigillata.\n\nThis came by way of my friend Richard Godfrey who gave me clay samples and a formula to make Terra Sig. And so I returned to making lusterware again but this time on a Raku surface.\n\nLustre\n\nMy present way of working involves throwing and turning the pots using thin steel ribs to ensure a perfectly smooth surface. I use very smooth stoneware clay which enables me to achieve this fine finish.\n\nThe pots are dried, coated with 3-4 layers of Terra Sig applied using soft brushes and biscuit fired.\n\nThe lustre is then applied, as before using small rubber stamps, building up the pattern area by area until the piece is complete.\n\nThe lustre is then fired in an electric kiln to harden on the decoration.\n\nThe final part of the process involves sponging on a resist slip [similar to those used in the naked raku technique] over the lower part of the vessel using either cut and shaped foam to produce a geometric pattern or a natural sponge, usually used in conjunction with latex trailing to create lines, giving a marbled finish.\n\nRaku firing using sawdust completes the process.\n\nThe heavy smoking modifies the colours of the lustre and creates a dense black background to the pattern which helps intensify the effect.\n\nRaku\n\nI do make a small quantity of what could be termed ‘standard raku’ glazed with crackle glazes and smoked with sawdust. I produce mainly tea bowls using this method and enjoy it for the freedom it gives me to throw and turn loosely as opposed to the fine surface needed for the lustred pots.\n\nCan you expand on how you began to use pattern and how it has evolved over time?\n\nBefore I started to make the lusterware in the 1980’s I made tableware decorated using foam stamps to apply coloured glazes onto the pots and the rubber stamps I used on the lusterware evolved from these, essentially they were just much smaller and made from a different material.\n\nThe patterns themselves come from many places [most of them forgotten] but I’ve always found historic architecture, particularly English cathedrals a rich source.\n\nIn evolutionary terms the pattern has, over time changed, mainly as a result of the individual elements becoming smaller. This has resulted in a denser, richer overall surface. The colours themselves haven’t changed being composed of gold, copper, silvery blue and purple.\n\nCan you discuss the gold base lustres you use?\n\nThe lustres are commercial resinate lustres from Heraeus in Germany. They are supplied ready to apply in liquid form which I allow to stiffen slightly as it makes application easier.\n\nCan you expand on the importance of history to your work?\n\nI cite history as one of my influences and it is indeed very important to me. I’m not sure however that there is an obvious link apparent in my work beyond the links with architectural details in my patterns. My signature vessel form however has its roots in Bronze Age storage jar in a local museum although it may not be apparent in its present form.\n\nHow important is traditional ware to your studios output?\n\nStrangely, if you had asked me this 12 months ago I would have replied as it being almost nonexistent having concentrated solely on Raku for many years although I did, as I mentioned earlier, make tableware early in my career.\n\nHowever, over the last year I have begun to reinvestigate tableware [if that is what you mean by traditional ware] and for about 6 months have not made Raku at all.\n\nI decided to take time to look afresh at what I was doing and incorporate into it elements of the ceramic history I am interested in. So, I have the beginnings of a new range of work drawing on research into early 18th century Staffordshire ceramics.\n\nI am hoping that this new work will be ready by Easter in time for next year’s shows and so far the people who have seen the early pieces have been complimentary.\n\nShape is a large part of ceramic ware. Discuss one or two of your personal favourites?\n\nThe form I have used for many years, the narrow footed, rounded vessel was derived from a Bronze Age pot I saw in a Museum many years ago and has long been a special piece for me. There’s something about its generosity of form and the way it grows when it’s thrown on the wheel that appeals to me.\n\nI’m also a fan of the large slipware dishes made by Thomas Toft and Ralph Simpson in Staffordshire during the 1600’s. Also, in the 1700’s before the full effect of industrial production there were a group of potters using predominantly hand methods but with a new found sophistication such as Wedgewood and Whieldon and I am presently finding inspiration from this source and using it in my new work.\n\nWhen leather hard the slabs are joined to form a 3D object. This is the most exciting stage in the making process and results in a piece which unifies colour, form, texture and design.\n\nYou also make boxes. Can you explain these and the technical aspects that must be taken into account in the making?\n\nI’ve made boxes for many years. I enjoy them as they are like a small, flat ‘canvas’ ready to decorate, each one can be different and can have a variety of uses. They are a small individual piece and don’t need to be made in matching sizes. I aim to fit the lid as precisely as possible by accurate throwing and careful turning as the fit and feel of the two halves is part of their appeal.\n\nYour work has a very masculine look. Do you think this is achieved by the use of dark colours and strong pattern?\n\nI am sure this is the case but it has never really been a conscious decision.\n\nRaku courses are part of you art practice. Can you expand on the classes?\n\nI have run the courses for several years now and continue to refine them year to year .Presently they are a two day course and cover Classic Glazed raku, Copper Matt and Techniques for Burnished surfaces. I don’t cover lustre owing to the expense involved, gold is very expensive. I provide suitable pots although students can bring their own, good coffee, tea, biscuits and a substantial lunch\n\nYou are represented in the UK and Europe. How important is it to have good representation?\n\nVery important! Most of my pots are sold through galleries in this country as well as several of the potters fairs both here and in Europe. As well as actual retail sales the value of networking at these events, contacts with galleries etc. and keeping up with friends is of great importance.\n\nContact Details\n\nJohn Wheeldon,\n\n4 West End,\n\nWirksworth,\n\nDerbyshire, DE44EG,\n\nUK\n\nWeb: johnwheeldonceramics.co.uk\n\nEmail: j.wheeldon@tiscali.co.uk\n\nAlso : ejw@johnwheeldonceramics.co.uk\n\nJohn Wheeldon, Derbyshire, UK\n\nInterview by Deborah Blakeley, November 2013\n\nby Deborah Blakeley\n\nMaryline Collioud-Robert\n\nThere has been a strong and consistent growth in your quilts from the 1980’s through to today. Can you discuss how you keep developing your style?\n\nI have no drawn path in front of me. I like to work in series, and it's usually in the middle of creating a quilt that surges a bright idea for the next one. I do not produce many quilts, so I have series dating from years behind, I would like to add on to. I'm always 20 quilts in advance in my head, and curse time flying and everyday life taking so much time out of creation!\n\n‘A Happy Place – detail’\n\nBetween 1980’s and 2000 your work was very colourful but piecing was the dominating factor, please expand on this?\n\nI have always loved piecing and still do. There is magic in the math of patchwork, as well as a meditative and soothing effect in the repetition of blocks.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010 you went beyond the boundaries. Explain how your work was no longer restricted by borders and templates?\n\nOver the years, the quality of the surface, the colours and shapes have taken over the fascination of the puzzle inherent to patchwork piecing.\n\nBy 2006 and 'Collage 2' you have developed your own style. Can you explain the process you now use?\n\nI appliqué/fuse fabrics to a background; I have hundreds of fabrics already fused, ready for use, and I choose among them, like I would choose colours for painting. I cut out the shapes by hand, and arrange them together until I get the intense colour surface I want.\n\n‘Gujarat – detail’\n\n‘Gujarat’\n\nWith a work like ‘Fragments 3’ you have had to work at colour while also tone. Can you explain the importance of the knowledge and use of tone in your work?\n\nI teach a colour workshop where I bring a large suitcase containing over a thousand different fabrics for the students to make collages with. At the end of the course, I collect the scraps, some as tiny as postage stamps. I use the small pieces of fabrics and I freely piece them to make the Fragments series./p>\n\n'Fragment’\n\nI love to make colour to colour or light to dark progressions. I always teach these progressions to my students, because one learns so much about colour in trying to make them.\n\nGoing from light to dark in one colour range is a lot easier than going from light to dark mixing all the colours. Quite a challenge, but I like to do that, it's relaxing. It drains my brain of everything unwanted! I call this series, (Fragments), my yoga series!\n\nIn your recent work you use pattern in the background, as we can see in ‘Riflesso’. What has allowed this breakthrough?\n\n'Riflesso’\n\nI've been using black and white fabrics for a while, because I like the intensified contrast it brings to the whole. For some reason, black and white fabrics are much more interesting, pattern wise, than some other fabrics created in other colour ranges.\n\nI love my black and white fabrics, (I have built an impressive collection over the years) and I have a sketchbook where I sketch down some more inspiration to create new black and white fabrics! Maybe one day!...\n\nYou also combine machine and hand stitch – How do you know when enough is enough?\n\n'Epieces’\n\nI've recently turned back to some hand stitching around my fused shapes, after coming back from India. Indeed, I was very lucky to take part to a trip to Gujarat, in the Kutch area, along with a group of textile lovers.\n\nThere, we visited several ethnical groups who each did a different kind of embroidery. I was struck by such beauty and expertise, although I'm not an embroiderer, and probably never will be. Some embroiderers were making incredible designs, and once finished, they went around the design with tiny white stitches. It's in honour of their incredible work that I started hand quilting again.\n\nCan you discuss the piecing that you now use that creates such movement in your work?\n\nWorking on ‘A Happy Place’\n\nI build movement in the quilt by freely piecing background fabrics. The seams will then be the \"stems\" along which the shapes will be fused.\n\nAfter cutting the shapes….\n\nColour is so important in your work. Where do you source your fabrics?\n\nI've been buying fabrics for over thirty years, therefore I have a large choice. I'm not interested in printing or dying my own fabrics. (Perhaps in another life!). Going into shops all over the world and discovering new colours and new patterns is a great joy!\n\nMaryline’s studio\n\n‘Paysage Imaginaire’- how important is the colour wheel to your palette?\n\nSometimes I like to work within the colour wheel, such as in this red/green complimentary colours quilt. But I usually let myself be surprised by colour combinations I see around me. I used to carry a tiny notebook in which I described colour combinations I found on my way, using words as precise as possible, so I could recreate the combination once at home. Now I use my smartphone!\n\n‘Passage Imaginaire’\n\nYou have travelled throughout the USA to discover quilts, can you tell about one or two very memorable events?\n\nI was studying humanities at the University of Neuchâtel, while already creating quilts. I decided to go to the States to study quilts a little deeper, taking workshops, meeting artists, and visiting museums. This trip took over a year to prepare, as there was no internet then, and I remember writing over 200 letters to different people to organise my trip.\n\nI also remember carrying in my suitcase, for months long, a tremendous amount of material for one workshop I was to take in Los Angeles. But on the week-end of the workshop, all we used was a sheet of paper and a pencil!\n\nThis trip was memorable. I was lucky to meet such wonderful artists such as Michael and Judy James, who became dear friends.\n\nExhibiting is a very large part of your studio time. How do you choose where to exhibit and how often?\n\nIt may seem like I exhibit quite a lot, but no, not so much. Quilting, at least the way I make quilts, takes an incredible amount of time, and to achieve a whole body of works for an exhibit takes ages.\n\nAlso, galleries in Switzerland are totally closed to exhibiting textiles. It's hard to find convenient venues.\n\nI belong to a professional Swiss quilt artists group, called fabric-connection.ch, and we have organised a few well received exhibitions, in Switzerland and in the States.\n\nI also take part in international group exhibitions, whenever possible.\n\n‘Ciao Bella!’\n\nEveryone loves to see inside a studio. Can you share yours?\n\nThe main piece of furniture in my studio is a huge chest of drawers holding my fabrics. But I also have tons of fabrics outside of the main drawers as well!\n\nCan you tell us more about your teaching?\n\nYou have four classes can you share what each class brings to your students - “This workshop is especially convenient for people wanting to set a foot outside traditional quilting and wanting to develop some more personal work”?\n\nTeaching is one of my favourite occupations, besides making quilts. I love to transmit my love of colour and textile, share my enthusiasm about fabrics and to bring people to discover new worlds.\n\nMost beginner feel secure making traditional quilts, which is perfectly all right, but I try to lead them a little bit outside their comfort zone. I also offer numerous exercises to make them discover new colour combinations, and I teach them how to use colour theories, everyday environment or just chance to be inspired.\n\nWhere do you teach these classes?\n\nI'm lucky to go all over Europe to teach. Guilds, textile festivals, or private groups invite me.\n\nIt fuels my battery to be in a creative environment with eager students. I get to travel, make new acquaintances and get out of my lonely studio for a while!\n\nWhat do you mean by the term 'ephemerical quilt'?\n\nNo fear of the white page in my colour workshops! I give students instructions to work on an element (sometimes a quilt block) and all the blocs are then pinned to the wall. With a large surface obtained in a short amount of time, it's easy to discuss colour, design, what could be changed, etc. The \"group quilt\" is photographed and then another one takes its place.\n\nHow important was it to your development to give up templates?\n\nI think not only I, but many quilters have more or less given up templates. Nowadays, some incredibly creative people have developed quick, clever machine piecing techniques, and most important, shared their discoveries with the world, allowing everyone to be more spontaneous and more creative.\n\nCan you share your photography with the blocks of colour?\n\nMy theory is that everyone, making even a very traditional quilt, will end up with a masterpiece, if they use variations of one colour, instead of just one colour.\n\nI often advise people to buy 20 small pieces of different red fabrics rather than 2 meters of one single red fabric. I illustrate this every week on my blog, in choosing three colours taken out of one of my pictures, and working these three colours in \"Vibrations\". The same can be done with combinations including more than 3 colours.\n\nCan you explain how you use your photographs for inspiration?\n\nWhenever possible, I carry my camera with me. I'm a very visual person, and I'm mostly inspired by things I see, rather than by things I hear or read.\n\nColours, textures, nature, are my main inspiration.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nI'm working on a large quilt, black and white with coloured appliqué forms, arranged in a zig zag movement.\n\nI'm also working on a new series, using reverse appliqué. That is sewing several layers of fabrics or whole patchwork surfaces, on top of one another, and making holes in the upper layer to reveal what's underneath.\n\n‘Spring’\n\nContact details.\n\nm.collioud@me.com\n\nwww.marylinecollioudrobert.com\n\nhttp://maryandpatch.blogspot.com\n\nMaryline Collioud-Robert, Boudry, Switzerland\n\nInterview by Deborah Blakeley, November, 2013\n\nby Deborah Blakeley\n\nSasha Harding\n\nYour aim is to capture the moment. Can you discuss this aspect of your work?\n\nI sometimes think of my paintings as snap shots a brief glimpse of a situation. I like the idea of representing moments that are familiar to all of us and also of more private, quite moments.\n\nNarrative is inspirational in your work. This is not something that many artists say, can you explain?\n\nI often start with a title rather than an image, I have pages and pages of lists of titles and ideas, the sketching out of the idea comes after the words. I have a vivid imagination and tend to think in terms of a story or narrative rather than a specific image, using my own memories of child hood or something that has accrued in my daily life.\n\nYou limit yourself to three colours and white. Why and how did this come about?\n\nIt was as simple as being penniless at college and only being able to afford a few paints! Over the years I have grown so used to my palette that I am loath to change it, sometimes I will add a new colour for a while but always go back to the three colours. I am much more interested in the content and story of a painting than the colour and so like to keep it simple.\n\nYou have been absorbing Cornwall since 1973. How did location have such a large part in your work?\n\nI was actually raised in Dorset but have lived in Cornwall for the past 18 years. Both counties have played a huge part in my work, the sea is an ongoing fascination of mine and very much part of my daily life, be that walking by it or fishing or being out in my boat.\n\nExhibiting your work is an integral part of our artistic life; can you expand on the importance of exhibiting to you?\n\nI think exhibiting is important because it gives you an opportunity to paint a large coherent body of work that will be shown as a whole, it is also really important for meeting the people who buy my work and chatting to them about it.\n\nYou have recently completed commissions for Canada and America. Can you discuss the stimulation commissions give to your work?\n\nCommissions are so different to my normal work, there is a brief to stick to and I have to be aware that I am painting for someone rather than for myself! They are a blessing and a curse and can be more stressful than my usual work .put it this way I am really enjoying having a month off commissions!\n\nCan you discuss your Aquarelle Collection?\n\nAquarelle are a small company that specialize in very small runs of limited editions. Quality is paramount and this is why I decided to do some work for them. Prints are a good way of making my work more accessible to a wider public.\n\nCurrently you are working on the illustrations for your own book. Can you tell us a little more about this?\n\nI have always wanted to write an illustrate my own book and having completed the south west coast path this time last year I realised it was the perfect subject. I have completed the hard part, a 65000 word manuscript (quite an achievement for me) I am now looking forward to illustrating it. This all ties in very well with my liking for a narrative and it seems a natural progression for me to do a book. Now all I need is to find the time to do it!\n\nYou do a very novel idea with “A Painting A Day”. Please explain this?\n\nIt is not my idea! I heard about this movement called “a painting a day” online: artists would paint a picture a day and put it on eBay or their own web site for a certain amount of money. Some of these artists have been doing it for years. Normally they paint still life or landscapes .I thought I could do something for a month and see what the reaction was.\n\nThe paintings were selling within seconds of being put on my website, it was very exciting and unlike anything I had done before. I love the immediacy of it; I paint the picture and put it online just like that. The small size of the images means they are much easier to buy without having to take out a second mortgage, so people can snap them up as soon as they appear. I may do one this November, but as with everything it is finding the time, also it is quite tricky thinking up 30 different pictures one after the other.\n\nDo you like to do your work around a thematic approach? As you know I love your paintings of dogs - can you expand on how you work up these images and also the importance of having a pet in your life?\n\nI grew up with dogs and as soon as I could I got myself a rescue dog, my new dog is very much part of my life (we did the walk together) and my day seems to revolve around her needs! Walking is where I get nearly all my ideas so my dog is essential to my painting.\n\nI love painting dogs ,they add an extra presence in a painting ,innocence, or a comedy element.\n\nOften you draw your figures in water but you allow us to see both above and below. How did this method come about?\n\nIt’s funny how people often end up doing things in adult hood that they did in childhood; I used to paint long pictures of underwater scenes with coral and sand and seaweed, I would paint and cut out fish and crabs and shell and then play for hours placing the cut out images in amongst the back drop.\n\nHere I am years later still fascinated by showing the hidden things under the sea. I always loved grubbing around in rock pools and I love the fact that I can paint them and other people like them.\n\nSketchbooks are a major part of your work. How does this lend itself to your outdoor days and studio days?\n\nI use my sketch books to draw out and plan a painting, much like cutting out image as a child I now draw out the images I want to use in a painting and cut them out, I then offer them up to the blank canvas and draw around them when I am happy with the composition, in this way I can plan everything in advance rather than doing all the working out on the canvas. I have draws full of little cut out figures and boats and dogs .Most of my pictures are from my head and so I don’t tend to sketch whilst out and about ,but use the books for planning and honing an image.\n\nFishermen and children are major players in your art, explain why?\n\nMy husband was a fisherman and I always loved the idea of being a fishwife!\n\nI know I have a romantic vision of fishermen and the very dangerous job they do but I am more interested in the image of the fisherman, the beard, the thick blue jumpers and big boots, the scruffy little ships dog.\n\nChildren represent all of our childhoods, if we are lucky we have fond memories of childhood (I know I do). I want to capture that innocence, that time in life before jobs and bills and stress when looking into a rock pool and seeing a hermit crab is the most amazing thing in the world.\n\nYour studio is so neat and tidy like your work, am I correct?\n\nYes it is!\n\nI am not a mucky artist although nearly all my clothes have paint on them and I often seem to end up with paint in my hair! I like to work in a fairly ordered way hence the working out and planning in my sketch book, not all over the clean, white canvas. The most important thing for me is cleaning up at the end of the day so when I go to work the next day it feels like a fresh start.\n\nVery rarely is someone alone in your paintings, they always have company or a pet. Please discuss.\n\nI like to see the way people interact with each other, I do paint people on their own but they are pensive, quiet pictures and normally I am an outgoing sort of girl and so paint what I like: people.\n\nFinally, you also use a completely different composition: tiny figures and in the foreground seaside plants. Can you discuss this method?\n\nIt is fun to paint in a different scale, I loved the idea of the plants taking the centre stage, but as with all my paintings there has to be a human element, no matter how tiny.\n\nContact details:\n\nEmail: sashahardingartist@gmail.com\n\nSasha Harding, Cornwall, UK\n\nInterview by Deborah Blakeley, October 2013\n\nby Deborah Blakeley\n\nYvette Kaiser Smith\n\nCan you explain ‘simply’ the technique you use to produce your sculptures?\n\nFiberglass as a finished product is a fibre reinforced plastic. Fiberglass as raw material is a fibre made from spun glass. It is white, opaque, pliable, and behaves as a heavy cloth. It is commonly combined with polyester resin, a liquid plastic. Normally, the resin wetted cloth is laid into or over a mould until the material cures into a hard, translucent surface.\n\nI start with a form of fiberglass called continuous roving or gun roving. Gun roving comes as a large spool of clustered continuous strands of fiberglass. I crochet the roving with a regular crochet hook to create my own cloth. The “J” hook is just big enough to pick up the mass of the roving. Using a variety of traditional stitches, I crochet flat geometric shapes: circles, rectangles, squares. For the next step, I use a hard finish polyester resin. This is polyester resin with 5% styrene wax. As the resin cures, the wax comes to the surface for a hard finish which is sand able, and eliminates the perpetual surface tack and smell of regular laminating resin. I do not lay my wet fiberglass into a mould; rather I use gravity to create simple geometric shapes. When laid into a mould, the crocheted cloth loses its dimensionality, it becomes flat and ugly.\n\nFibreglass roving\n\nSummary of process basics:\n\n• Commit to a number sequence\n\n• Work out form and colour in drawings\n\n• Crochet flat shapes\n\n• Build a jig for draping and forming\n\n• Pour out the resin, add colour in form of dyes, add hardener, apply resin to crocheted cloth with a 1” or 2” brush\n\n• Hang resin wetted cloth on jig and recover shape by gently pulling out the edges until it starts to set (between 15 – 30 minutes)\n\n• Let it harden for 24 hours\n\n• Cut the edges and make cuts to correct form\n\n• Sand body and edges of forms\n\n• Recoat with coloured resin, usually 2 or 3 times\n\n• Sand down drips\n\n• Touch up sanded areas with more resin.\n\nIf a work is made from several units that are fused together, I now have to:\n\n• Figure out how to make them fit and temporarily hold together in proper place with cable ties without going insane\n\n• Sew parts together with the roving\n\n• Apply resin\n\n• Sand\n\n• Recoat with resin\n\n• Polish with ArmorAll vinyl upholstery cleaner using a 1” brush.\n\nCrocheted Cloth\n\nCan you expand on the mathematics involved in your work and how this came about?\n\nIt started with Tim, my husband. Tim is a mathematician by education and a complete math nerd to the core. While driving me from install to install, during long highway trips, Tim used to amuse himself by working out the square root of the multi-digit numbers on the back of big trucks or by trying to deduce whether these long numbers were primes. Or while on vacation or visiting family in the country, Tim would drop to his knees, while all others walked on, to count the leaves on plant life new to his eyes; that number was always a prime. His constant curiosities made me see that math is a part of life, all of life, and cannot be separated from “identity” dialogue.\n\nMy reference to math started slowly with an obsession with prime numbers. Utilizing a unique number that is only divisible by 1 and itself was a natural addition as a conceptual tool within identity narratives. Whenever possible I pushed the number of components, or rows, or columns to the nearest prime number. I was convinced, and still am, that repeating nature in this way, that is, fixate on primes, produces a more balanced visual experience.\n\nIn 2001, I was working on a show for a university gallery. A wall sized piece takes 3 hard months to produce. I had 2 weeks left and one more large wall to fill. I crocheted 80 plus 10” circles and had the idea to make them ‘the same but different’ in the way that I am same but different from day to day. This involved snapping a graphite grid on the wall to control placement. (I love grids. I have always gravitated towards artwork utilizing grid, I just never found a natural way to bring it into my work.) I wanted to space the circles in a seemingly random, asymmetrical pattern. I asked Tim for a random pattern generator. He said: why don’t you use pi! I said: pi?! Simple interpretation: on the grid, 3 fiberglass circles, space, 1 circle, space, 4 circles, space, and so on. I installed the same piece in 4 different venues, always on a wall that was quite different from the others, I mimicked the wall proportions with the grid, so that I had something like 3 rows by 17 columns or 10 rows by 10 columns. Always I followed the beginning sequence of the infinite number pi, staying true to the number, and always the composition worked!! It was balanced, it was asymmetrical, it was not predictable, and it was beautiful. So now I am obsessed with prime numbers and using pi sequences to generate random patterns. From about 2000 on, most of the work was large and in one piece. Large they were but still limited by standard doorways in the short dimension; and both Tim and I were really fed up with moving these things. From the beginning of this ‘abstracting identity narrative’ stuff I depended on some level of narrative as the source for decisions about material, colour, form, movement, etc.. In 2007 I started working on a solo show for a new, beautiful gallery with a few very large walls. Like a 5 year old, I see a huge wall and I want to fill it. I planned a 10 by 10 foot square. This meant modules. In the thinking / drawing stage, one thing led to another and I thought: Articulate the digits!! Let the number make the work. Grid!! This gave the natural organic feel of the crocheted fiberglass a structure that was missing. And it really felt true in my gut. Everything since then has been number generated.\n\nIt was at this time I rummaged through my notes and found small scraps of paper on which Tim suggested, years ago, that I could also use e, another infinite number, and Pascal’s Triangle. I used pi, e, and Pascal’s Triangle to create all the work for the DIGITS show at Alfedena Gallery in 2008. Sequences from pi and e can produce completely different rhythms. There is nothing more true than maths and physics. If I commit to a number sequence, I stay true to it. If it doesn’t quite work for that particular form or idea, I try several sequences on paper until it does what I need it to do.\n\nFirst Pi Piece\n\nPeople hear math and run away. My math use is stupidly simple. The numbers are my referent, my source, the thing that creates the work. I am from Western culture so naturally I run sequences from left to right, top to bottom, with some exception. Larger works are straight forward, more obvious, interpretations of each digit, while the source math in the small works is less evident.\n\nIdentity Sequence e 4 (2007) is based on the beginning sequence of the infinite number e. It is constructed from 323 small units, 17 rows by 19 columns, to look like an enlarged section of a microscopic organic blueprint. Flesh toned units directly articulate each digit. The four molecule sequence of human DNA determined the use of four alternating colours which serve as the space between each flesh toned digit.\n\nIdentity Sequence e\n\nIdentity Sequence e Black (2007) is based on the first 49 digits of the number e. I wanted it to feel like a small section that seems to be cut away from a much larger one. Grid is constructed from 49 units in 7 rows by 7 columns. Here the digits are articulated by two systems: tonal gradation of the black where the darkest colour value represents the 9 digit and no colour represents 0; and the distance each unit pushes away from the wall, where units representing the 9 digit push 32” away from the wall and the zeros barely pooch up.\n\nIdentity Sequence e Black\n\nIdentity Sequence Pascal’s Triangle Green and Red (2007 / 2008) are based on digits from the first six rows of Pascal's Triangle. Blocks of the same colour represent each digit. The form of each triangle in Pi in Pascal's Triangle Square and Pi in Pascal's Triangle Round (2010) is based on the first four rows of Pascal's Triangle. Four colours are distributed using the first 30 digits of pi. Meaning: I assign colour 1, colour 2, colour 3, colour 4, and then use the digit to drop the colour. For a pi sequence, I count 3 and drop colour 1; count 1 drop colour 2; count 4 drop colour 3; count 1 drop colour 4; and so on. Again, I run the sequence on paper in different colour order because the look of the work, in varied colour distributions, can be quite different.\n\nIdentity Sequence Pascal’s Triangles\n\nSize - discuss the size of your work?\n\nEarly on, in BFA School I began to understand that every material and process has its own language, its own way to articulate words and ideas. This is one of the principle drivers that took the seminal “I want to abstract narratives of identity” question (1992) to the current crocheting fiberglass into abstract, geometric, minimal number generated forms.\n\nPart of the challenge of understanding a specific material or conceptual language is finding the right scale for that particular form. And, yes, there is always the ‘right’ scale. This is why most of the work from 2000 to 2008 was very large. It took me years to find it and years to explore it. I still believe that the crocheted fiberglass language based on narrative needed to be in that large scale in order to be successful. The number generated work from 2007/2008 changed that. Grid came in. Modules came in. Small components came in. The older, more organic forms needed the scale. The structure of the geometry and pattern released me from that, although the first few number generated works are big.\n\nStrands – small work 40x40x7\n\nWhile making the DIGITS show, I ran out of time, had two small walls, the systems I was developing allowed for a successful 3 x 3 foot and 2 x 5 foot. Six months later I had opportunity to set up an artist booth at The Artist Project art fair. Small walls, actually thinking about selling the work, the new systems allowed and happily resided in this 4 x 4 and 3 x 3 foot scale. These things moved so I stuck in the scale. The work got a little bit smaller as I started using USPS to ship overseas.\n\nMoving (selling and shipping) the work necessitated the scale down which would not have happened without the math structure.\n\nPart of the beauty is the shadows; your work casts comment on this?\n\nAt first, the shadow was just a by-product. I soon realized that the shadow, the act of being projected through a solid form, really played into the identity dialogues: which is you, the core of you, is it the body or that which flows through the body and imprints on your environment, that is, your behaviour or even a soul; that kind of stuff. And the shadows were cool. I saw some as drawings. Some had the look of photograms. I enjoyed the reference. With this new conceptual anchor, I wanted to create forms that maximized the shadow drawings, so that the expectation of a certain shadow reaction dictated the form creation and construction. Now that the forms work off of the numbers, a shadow of a curve anchored to a wall can serve as another dimension to complete or close a form. In the more architectural panel pieces, the shadows can draw out or elongate or even create additional elements.\n\nPrimary Structures\n\nDiscuss your involvement in the Art in Embassy Program?\n\nArt in Embassies creates permanent and temporary art exhibitions in over 200 diplomatic venues worldwide. The temporary group exhibitions are curated by incoming ambassadors or their representatives, usually for the duration of their term.\n\nA significant larger work, Daisy Chain (1999), was curated into the art loaned to Spaso House, the American Embassy in Moscow, Russia for a 4 year period (2002-2006). Also during that time, a smaller work was part of the exhibition at the American Embassy in Ankara, Turkey; this was a 2 year loan. From this exposure, in 2006, I was able to sell a large existing work to be a permanent part of the American Embassy in Abuja, Nigeria. And, Daisy Chain was the month of August in the 2004 Embassy of the United States wall calendar!!\n\nDaisy Chain in Spaso House, Moscow\n\nComment on the connection between your work, culture and history?\n\nThe search for numbers went on for thousands of years; in this respect, numbers represent the human search for knowledge. And, just about every culture, current and extinct, has and had its own lace or knotted cloth tradition. The tradition of crochet and the process of crocheting both embody passing of time, human labour, and innovation and creativity. The narrative based crocheted fiberglass as well as the math driven crocheted fiberglass reference culture and humanness; they represent time and community; the work highlights our connectivity. If identity is a hybrid of our heritage, then lace is, as tradition of time, labour, and creativity, one tiny point of intersection that connects us all.\n\nYour work, due to the base structure, is seen a feminist, how do you feel about this?\n\nThe base structure is the logic of geometry and spatial relationships created by number sequences, thank you for acknowledging the math! Oh, you mean the crochet!! Is the work feminist because I am female crocheting? If the same work was created by male would it still be seen as feminist? The work does surface gender issues, but perhaps not the expected. At most, I’d call the work quietly subversive. But I suppose subversive and feminist reside in the same house.\n\n13 Pi Line - detail\n\nIt is seen as feminist because of the gender of the maker. I prefer for the art to be received for what it is: objects that are products of an active, long-term material and conceptual exploration; minimal, geometric abstractions that are not generic in form but resonate through specificity. The structure, form and colour distribution within the object is created by math; base materials are fiberglass and polyester resin, industrial and nasty to work with; the technique I use to create my own sculpting material is a craft traditionally attributed to female. That is one out of three key components.\n\nI explore the nature of relationships and identity using formalism while striving for specificity. I began ‘abstracting narratives’ to go beyond the generic in my minimal abstract forms. Identity was a vehicle used to construct the DNA (specificity) of the initial work and then process took over. The work is not feminist, it is formalist and referential. It is a hybrid that defies conventional out-dated labels.\n\nCrochet and lacework is very European does this connect you to your homeland and ancestors?\n\nI was born in communist Prague. Moved to the United States 7 weeks before my 11th birthday. I don’t remember any experience with lace or crochet. In 1999, 30 years later, my Mom and I went back to Prague for the first time. By this time, I was crocheting fiberglass for about 3 years, the forms were on the large end of medium, I was not yet handling the material in the best way, I only used simple stitches, and my identity concepts were still limited.\n\nThe trip back home had a significant impact on my studio. What I saw was that Czechs are known for, and are proud of, the best beer on this planet, Czech crystal, and lace!! I, for the first time, realized that Czechs have a tradition of gorgeous lace everything. Every home we visited was inundated with lace: concentric circles on interior door glass; lace curtains; plastic lace on plant pots; lace runners; basically lace everywhere. On the streets, the old ladies seemed to have a sort of uniform which consisted of four items: blouse, slacks or skirt, vest, and shawl. Three of these were usually in pattern, the fourth was solid. This overload of patterns should not have worked but it did.\n\nWhen I got home, my work exploded. Somehow, recognizing that my heritage comes with a lace tradition, I felt a permission to exploit it more fully. I also realized that, although I was claiming to “articulate narratives of identity in the language of crocheted fiberglass”, I was not utilizing the fullness of the crochet language. I bought a book that catalogues many of the traditional stiches, patterns, and formats and began to exploit this resource more fully. I learned that the more complex stiches created a stronger form and allowed me to work larger. While immersing myself in pattern, I finally began to think outside of the body and saw identity in terms of pattern: internal and external; nature vs. nurture; DNA; social behaviour, how groups affect the individual. The identity dialogue evolved into greater complexity. The sculptures reached their proper large scale. Reaching this scale forced me to develop better handling of the material. All this happened because I went back to Prague, saw lace, and reconnected to that culture and place.\n\nYour work is sculpture: does it become sculpture due to its solidness or size? Please discuss\n\nIt doesn’t become sculpture, it is sculpture. Sculpture can be in any scale; it can be solid or hollow. Sculpture is not flat; it possesses mass and volume, as does my work. My forms hang on a wall but they reside in three dimensional space. The wall dependency began as a material / scale necessity and later became part of the material language. Sculpture manipulates and activates space. The sheets of handmade, not prefabricated, fiberglass are manipulated to create forms that break into three-dimensional space. The forms manipulate space by pushing into it, by holding it, by folding it, by squeezing it. Some of the forms are so active they command the entire room in deep three dimensional relief, Etudes from Pi in 5 Squared (2011) for example. Some quietly hover in shallow relief, like Pi Line 22 in 5 (2012), yet they still activate a shallow more personal space. In terms of construction, mine is both an additive and subtractive sculpting process.\n\nEtudes from Pi in 5 Sq.\n\nWhich came first: the fibreglass or the crochet?\n\nThe fiberglass.\n\nThe ‘abstracting of identity narratives’ stuff began at onset of MFA School (1992). That work explored more common sculpture-student materials like iron wire, lead sheet, copper sheet, plaster, bees wax, wood. I was all over the place. My forms were restricted to body metaphors. I still did not understand scale. I had a copper sheet and iron wire form that did not work on the floor or in any relationship to the wall. As a desperate act to salvage the piece, I brought polyester resin, fiberglass matt, and fiberglass insulation into the studio to make a small stand. During my 1st year, a then 2nd year cast fiberglass cloth into moulds; probably why it came to mind. I knew immediately that fiberglass was the material to explore. Not only for its versatility but also for its natural translucency and skin like splotchiness.\n\nResin Applied Panels\n\nDuring the next three years, my studio focused on material exploration, trying to understand the language of fiberglass and how to use it to articulate my conceptual agenda, which was still stuck in one individual, within the body. During this time, I found the roving. Having used iron wire in school for forcing a shape by binding, I bought a spool and began to play. It was all stupid. I shoved the roving in the corner and forgot about it.\n\nAround November 1996, I was starting to work on my first 2-person show, my narrative was still limited to the body, dichotomies a large part of the dialogue; I was at an all-night grocery at one o’clock in the morning, running by the meat counter, from the corner of my eye, I saw tripe!! I stood there frozen in time as thoughts rushed through my head. I saw fat, I saw lace; beauty and ugliness; identity!! Without recognizing why, I associated lace with crochet. The next day I found a hobby store, purchased a book that teaches you how to make pot holders and baby booties, every size of hook available, and began to crochet. It took another 3 years or so before I began to understand the material language of crocheted fiberglass vs. the language of the prefab matt and cloth.\n\nWhat are you working on currently?\n\nI am making new work for a small solo show here in Chicago at ARTexhibitionsLink’s Gallery Uno that will go up the first week in October. Right after that I begin a 3 week Artist Residency at Ragdale. During the past 3 years, I have been trying to squeeze in time to transition to 2D by experimenting in ways to map the math via Encaustic work. This is what will continue at Ragdale; but my mind is already distracted by the possibilities.\n\nFibonacci\n\nHow do you physically cope with the resin process in you studio?\n\nMy studio has a large roof exhaust. I have a full face respirator with two options for filters; a great disposable glove supplier; my body is always fully covered; and at this point, it’s just a normal circumstance of my work.\n\nStudio Basics – Wearing Resin Gear\n\nIt is the most maddening stage of the material process. With the time constraint of the initial curing time; the full gear I wear, especially in summer when it is 90 in the studio; the sticking to everything if in resin all day; trying not to lose 2 weeks of crochet in one day by not being able to control the form; this is what I call my Three Stooges stage because the resin session can easily turn into dark, one-person Three Stooges episode. If ever I scream in panic, it is in resin application.\n\nIt’s just part of the process. It is what it is. I am committed to this process, I believe in it. Much more unpleasant is the sanding!!\n\nOriginally your exhibitions were all in Chicago. This year 2012 you have an exhibition in Germany. How did this come about?\n\nIn late 2004 I went to a local gallery to hear an artist talk about her work. There I sat next to another artist who was actively working with ARTexhibitionLink, an art organisation founded by art historian Barbara Goebels-Cattaneo, which links the contemporary art scene in Chicago and Berlin. Barbara asks: “Do artworks show geographic or historical adherence or has contemporary art become a global issue, dealing with comparable problems, working with similar standards?”\n\nIn March 2005 Barbara was in Chicago; my new artist friend introduced me; I had a show up; Barbara liked the work; that fall she included me in a 3-person show (also featuring my new artist friend) that hung in an alternative gallery in Rome and later in Berlin. We reconnected in 2010; Barbara took my work to Berliner Liste art fair. In the booth across the aisle was Kunsthandlung Huber & Treff, a gallery from Jena, Germany. They listened to me talk about my work, non-stop, for 4 days. The following year Huber & Treff became the curators for an exhibition space in the lobby of Jenoptik Corporation in Jena which was unused for several years. They invited me to be the inaugural show.\n\nA take away from this story is (although I am mostly a recluse) artists leave your studios!!\n\nJenoptik - Lobby\n\nArtists are becoming global - can you expand how this is affecting your art work?\n\nThe shipping difficulty of moving sculpture in terms of cost and dimensional restrictions led to two things. It made me think in modules (the first work I made for ARTexhibitionLink in 2005) which pried open the door to the number generated work. And it continues to challenge me to make smaller, more compact, yet still somewhat intelligent works, which are easy to ship. I like barriers, they push the work where I would not go on my own.\n\nWhen I travel, I, like many artists, take too many pictures, often of interesting colour combinations or patterns in architecture. Before each project, whether the fiberglass or the 2D work, I run through my sources for inspiration. Math is universal, but I think that the character of a specific geography can be transported through colour and/or rhythm.\n\nContact Details:\n\nWebsite:www.yvettekaisersmith.com\n\nEmail: yvette@kaisersmith.com\n\nYvette Kaiser Smith, Chicago, USA\n\nInterview by Deborah Blakeley, October, 2013\n\nby Deborah Blakeley\n\nSylvain Guenot\n\nWhat are some important things that you need to go through with the sitter to get the best results?\n\nI spend quite a lot of time with the sitter(s) before the actual start of the shoot. First I show them samples of my work to remind them the specific nature of my portraiture so that they \"understand\" what I expect of them. Then they show me round inside and outside the house so that I can spot the places with potential. Finally we choose together the clothes to be used to match best the various places. This is a very intimate time to build up the necessary confidence needed for a successful shoot: intimacy between photographer and sitter is a key thing in my experience.\n\nOf course you also work in colour, can you discuss why colour is important for these prints?\n\nIn both these photos the link between sitter and surroundings is made by colour mainly, in these two cases black and white would have diminished the impact rather than enhance it. In quite a few of my colour photos the main feel remains monochromatic, sometimes there is somewhere in the picture a little splash of brighter colour\n\nI actually mainly work in colour nowadays although I do think monochrome extends the artistic dimension of an image providing it is the right type of image. Some images have to be colour otherwise they become pointless.\n\nComposition is a very important part of you photography, can you expand on this aspect?\n\nYes, composition is essential in my images: there is actually a lot of geometrical shapes involved whether they are around the sitter or the sitter. My aim is to make them talk together in an harmonious way to produce a successful image. To do that, at the composition stage in my viewfinder, I consider the sitter (actually the space he/she occupies) as an abstract shape taking no more importance than everything else around background and foreground. I regard the whole thing as an abstraction of the reality which I then photograph. The image comes out of it where the sitter and the rest cannot be visually dissociated they are bits of the same working machine.\n\nIf you take out what is around the sitter, the portrait is poor, or alternatively if you take out the sitter, the image is incomplete and cannot live by itself. Interestingly enough, some people who see my work for the first time in an exhibition ask me if it is painting or a photograph?\n\nCan you discuss the sitter’s reaction on seeing the final image?\n\nSometimes some of them who have not fully \"understood\" my approach might tend to only look at themselves not being able to take the whole thing in one go, so it can disturb them a little bit….\n\nThis is Sir John Houghton, he is a scientist who received a joint Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his team work with Al Gore about climate. This portrait was commissioned by a publisher for the front cover of his biography which is coming out in September 2013. The brief was to illustrate the \"Conflict\" our planet is facing through the voice and work of this highly respected scientist. Again use of foreground and background.\n\nWhat do you mean by the word “peoplescapes”?\n\nThis is what I call \"peoplescape\" a word I feel I have invented but probably already existed before… I mean an image which contains a person or more than one but which goes beyond showing that person. It is an artistically pleasing image altogether which creates an emotion. Being supported by somebody' s presence in association with abstracted surroundings suggesting (often in a subliminal way) rather than informing in a 'documentary\" way\n\nThe abstracted background is used in a way to suggest Chinese calligraphy for this French Woman who is temporarily experiencing the life of an expat in Hong Kong\n\nYou see beyond the image and want to capture the character, can you expand on this?\n\nYes, the particular use of background/foreground I make, inevitably (and intentionally), reveals character in a subtle, non explicit way which makes the portrait more appealing and more interesting. I feel each image has a psychology and I try to use it to serve the sitter's character in the image.\n\nHere the surroundings are made of a foreground on top right corner (lampshade) echoing shape wise with the yellow collar of the shirt but also merging with metal staircase and windows in the background to produce a kind of disturbing/distressing feel which serves character for this young Danish expat girl in Hong Kong.\n\nThis man is an English high level cage fighter, I am aiming at showing his strength and also vulnerability, first layer of fragile green twigs acting as a foreground and second one as background, together suggesting subtlely the cage he fights in. Note how the shapes of the twigs replicate those of the shirt and therefore assemble sitter and surroundings in one working image.\n\nYou also use light in your work?\n\nThe combination of the strong side light with the settee designed cushions create an appropriate Dickens type of atmosphere to portray that little rascal.\n\nYour major work is portraiture. You have also completed “The Hong Kong project” - can you discuss this project?\n\nI took these photos on my numerous trips in Hong Kong between portrait commissions, I was fascinated by these derelict walls whose natural abstract patterns tend to evoke an infinity of concrete things depending on the way your mind decides to look at them. Interestingly enough the photographic process there was to transform abstract forms into more real looking ones as opposed to the \"peoplescapes\" which are about abstracting real things. Both processes complete each other and require the same artistic vision and abilities.\n\nDo you have other projects that you are working on or have done?\n\nI currently have an exhibition of portraits of famous American Contemporary Dance dancers in New York and I love the idea of doing a similar thing with UK dancers at The National Portrait Gallery in London but I will have to convince NPG first….The NYC exhibition is called \"inAction, The Virtuosity Of Presence\", my challenge was to show the virtuosity of the dancer through a \"portrait\" where this dancer is not dressed as a dancer, not performing, not even in a dance environment.\n\nTopaz Arts Inc 55-03 39th Avenue Woodside, NY 11377 for “inAction: the Virtuosity of Presence” new portraiture featuring 40+ New York-based dancers & choreographers photographed by Sylvain Guenot.\n\n‘Carmen de Lavallade’\n\nI am also in the middle of setting up a commercial project consisting in getting Asian people to come and have their wedding (or rather pre-wedding) photos taken in England and France. A coffee table book of portraits of famous people around the world is also in the pipeline, it is too early at this stage to reveal more about the project.\n\nHow has photography changed for you since digital and software such as Photoshop?\n\nIt has changed dramatically and for the better: first I was very reluctant to leave my film camera as I was convinced digital technology would never enable me to produce such good black and white, black and white being the only way for me…. Not only it did a very good job in that respect but it also gave me a chance to discover colour and find myself loving it to a point I nearly only produce colour work nowadays. I actually find it difficult to convert colour digital files into black and white when I previously photographed the scene with colour in mind. Also digital technology has enabled me to take more work on as it makes it possible to work much faster and more efficiently than in the darkroom. Finally I love the control on the image you get through Photoshop or any other software of that kind.\n\nHow large can you have you prints processed?\n\nI always do my own printing because I want to keep control of the image until the final stage, interpreting my digital file in a similar way I used to with my negative in the darkroom. My Epson 3880 printer allows me to print up to A2 (60.5 cm x 43 cm). Much larger prints can very easily be achieved with my high resolution files (Canon 5D Camera)\n\nCan you explain to the reader that as a professional you don’t expect to get that one image with one photograph and it isn’t simply a case of being a professional, you too need to take many to capture the perfect image? Discuss?\n\nAbsolutely right! First I need to find the idea which means the right place in the right light with the sitter wearing the right clothes. With the experience I have become good at working out quite quickly (sometimes a bit instinctively) which combination of these elements would have the potential for a successful image. Then it is a question of trying it and sometimes it can take many shots indeed to get the one(s) providing the expected pleasing result. I would advise to always work with an idea in mind, working randomly is rarely fruitful.\n\nContact details.\n\nWebsite: www.portrait-photographer-gloucestershire.co.uk\n\nOffice: 0044 1453 764849\n\nMobile: 0044 777 98 19 602\n\nSylvain Guenot, Gloucestershire, UK\n\nInterview by Deborah Blakeley, October, 2013\n\nby Deborah Blakeley\n\nRegina Heinz\n\nYou have done many residencies in the UK and beyond. Can you expand on the importance of them to you work?\n\nResidencies are a great opportunity to push the boundaries of one’s work. They provide time, space and usually good facilities and thus encourage to experiment, try a different scale or introduce a new technique.\n\nAll my residencies have worked in this way. Two of them were particularly beneficial: At the beginning of my career I spent three months at Cleveland Crafts Centre, Middlesbrough, England and in 2011 I was invited as part of the British contingent to create work for the Fule International Ceramic Museum in Fuping, China.\n\n‘Dress’ Brushed Lithium Glaze, Middlesbrough\n\n‘Middlesbrough’’\n\nMiddlesbrough is an industrial town in the North East of England not far from the lovely rolling landscape of the Yorkshire Moors. I was startled by the stark contrast created by industrial plants eating into the natural environment. This prompted me to “cut” into my organic pillow shapes and to introduce “manmade” right angled elements in order to visualise this contrast.\n\nSince then I have cultivated this contrast. Balance and juxtaposition of precise geometric components and softly undulating sensual forms is one of the main characteristics of my visual language.\n\nThe residency in Fuping took place in a brick factory and not only provided a huge working space but also the opportunity to work with prefabricated elements.\n\n‘Fuping Residency’ – New Roof\n\nThe factory produced curved roof tiles amongst other products. I used 70 of them to create the large relief sculpture “A New Roof”, displayed on the floor of the British pavilion. This sparked off ideas of creating my recent body of large scale wall based work, 3D undulating wall units, cast in Stoke on Trent, hand painted in my South London studio, which can be combined in different ways to create installations for interior and exterior settings.\n\nNew Roof- detail\n\nAre there any special tricks to winning residencies that you are willing to share?\n\nIt is always good to indicate why you are applying how and in what way the residency will benefit your work. Usually residencies have certain criteria when looking for in suitable candidates. If you want to apply find out as much as possible about the residency and in your application try to fit the criteria.\n\nExhibiting of you ceramics: how, where and why?\n\nExhibiting and selling my work is a form of communicating and thus vital for my professional life. I am grateful to have been able to exhibit in many different venues all over the world, including galleries, competitions, museums exhibitions and ceramic and interior design fairs. All these venues demand different types of work and target a different audience, one off pieces and special pieces are best exhibited in galleries and museums, my recent wall based work also fits the criteria of architectural ceramics and has been successfully exhibited in interior design fairs over the past years.\n\nArchitectural Ceramics ‘Collection Flow’\n\nYour initial training was in painting. Can you explain how this can be seen in your current work?\n\nAll my work is essentially painting onto a 3-D surface. I love colour in general and the richness depth and texture of ceramic colour in particular. I also love the act of brushing and when decorating I am building up layers of colours and textures.\n\nOxides, glazes, biscuit slips, washes of ceramic pigment and most recently ceramic transfers and gold enamels are applied in sequence and juxtaposed and very often fired on in between in multiple firings, thus creating depths and vibrancy which adds to the richness and sensuality of the organic form. Bits of the layer underneath are very often left exposed thus emphasising the act of painting.\n\nMost recently in my high firing range I have discovered shades of colour and natural phenomena like a sunlit moving water surface are translated into a ”carpet” of different coloured tones, golden highlights and bold patterns.\n\n‘Flow Collection ’ Brushed Stoneware Glaze\n\nWe see a lot of rhythm and repetitive pattern work, please discuss?\n\nAs with my colour palette also my patterns have been derived from nature and observation of natural phenomena.\n\nThe movement of water is one of my main sources of inspiration and is translated into undulating forms and wavy repetitive patterns and designs.\n\nOver the years my focus on the landscape has undergone an interesting change. Overall views have been submitted to a process of “zooming in” and “blowing up” of smaller and smaller areas. Close ups of surfaces, details of natural and manmade environments now serve as starting points.\n\n‘Cityscape’ each tile 20x15x3cms\n\nYour work is hand built. Can you expand on your technique?\n\nAll my hand built work is constructed from soft slabs in order to emphasise the sensual and tactile qualities of clay.\n\nThe process can be compared to “tailoring”, the designs are developed on a flat surface, then slabs are rolled out, cut and incised similar to pattern cutting. The slabs are shaped while still soft by gentle pressure applied from above or underneath to create an undulating surface. I always try to manipulate the slabs as little as possible and to retain their original surface texture, cracks, markings, newspaper creases etc. to the highest possible degree. This technique is paramount to my work and requires both spontaneity and control. The soft slabs react immediately to every touch, every movement of the hand and are easily over-worked, in danger of losing their elasticity and freshness.\n\nWhen leather hard the slabs are joined to form a 3D object. This is the most exciting stage in the making process and results in a piece which unifies colour, form, texture and design.\n\nI use grogged Stoneware clays for technical and aesthetic reasons. Grog provides tactile and visual texture as well as strength for better control during the forming process.\n\n‘Cityscape Collection’\n\nCan you explain about both your studio and the importance of an arts grant to help you set it up?\n\nMaintaining a professional studio is an essential part of working as a ceramic artist.\n\nI received a setting up grant from the British Crafts Council when I started out. The help was invaluable, I was able to equip my studio with a proper kiln, pug mill and slab roller and turn it into a functioning ceramic studio. The grant also kick started my career as my work was included in the promotional campaign run by the Crafts Council for all the grants recipients.\n\nYour work is suitable for internal and external display. Can you explain how these differ?\n\nI have two firing and glaze ranges.\n\nThe decoration of my low firing indoor range consists of a Lithium glaze fired to 1035°C and various oxides, washes of ceramic pigments and biscuit slips.\n\nThe final effect is the result of multiple firings; layers of colour are fired-on between applications.\n\nThe high firing range uses a stoneware glaze with a high China clay content that generates a beautiful mat fresco like surface, well suited to “clothe” the organic undulating forms. Oxides and stains are added in varying quantities to achieve shades of colour. My high firing colour palette comprises warm tones, browns and ochre as well as blues, greens and greys.\n\nHow are your wall sculptures physically hung?\n\nThe wall sculptures are mounted on boards, either glued for a permanent fixture or screwed on using cavity screws for a non-permanent installation.\n\nIf required the modules can also be glued permanently to the wall using a tile adhesive.\n\n‘Flow’ 300 x 140 x 5 cm\n\nColour and pattern is intrinsically part of your work. Please expand on this?\n\nThe Austrian painter Gustav Klimt is very well known for his highly decorative and ornamented art nouveau portrait paintings of high society ladies in Vienna around 1900.\n\nPerhaps less well known are his beautiful landscape paintings he created during several summers when he stayed on the lake “Atter” (Attersee) in “Salzkammergut”, Upper Austria, the same lake where I used to stay during my child hood summers.\n\nLake Attersee, Upper Austria\n\nI particularly love the paintings which depict the lake. Though observed from nature the different shades of blue and turquoise of the water surface are represented by single brush strokes in different colours, which when looked at in isolation, remind me of abstract paintings. The visual impression of glittering light, reflection and movement has been translated into tessellations of colour, very similar to the process I am using in my work: Observation from nature are simplified, abstracted and distilled into colour, patterns and forms.\n\nWater Surface Island Donthe, Lake Attersee\n\nWater surface – inspiration for ‘Flow’\n\nWhat are the sizes of your work?\n\nI love to work in groups or to themes, large scale, and for particular sites Therefore depending on the circumstances or commissions there are no size restrictions. My sculptures start from usually 30 cm, my largest free standing sculpture so far was 160 cm high, restricted only by the size of the available kiln.\n\n‘With a Twist’ 63x55x30 cms\n\nThe modular nature of my wall based work lends itself to large scale and can easily be extended to whole interior or exterior walls. The largest piece so far was 2 x 2 m and was created for an exhibition display for the American company Ann Sacks.\n\nYou comment that you get inspiration from the mountainous landscape of your homeland, Austria, how?\n\nMy work is biographical and topographical and draws from my early memories of growing up in a particular beautiful mountainous part of Austria. Rather than telling stories and incorporating a narrative I am conveying my feelings and visual impressions in a more abstract way and encourage the spectator to create their own stories and memories. Very often I use the camera as a vehicle to explore my surroundings. Photography is part of my creative process, with the image abstracted, tessellated and integrated into softly undulating ceramic forms. Like photographs my pieces are impressions, “3-D snapshots” that capture moments in time.\n\n‘Engaged’\n\nYou have your work in many UK and international galleries. Can you explain how you have been able to develop this network and also how you keep up with the work load?\n\nI am a member of several professional associations including the British Crafts Council, the British Craft Potters Association and the International Academy of Ceramics. This helps with networking, getting to know key figures in the ceramics world and obtaining important information regarding galleries, exhibition opportunities, competitions etc. I have also always proactively researched and applied to suitable galleries, presented my work at fairs and most recently started a newsletter sent to my contacts on a regular basis. In general I try to “communicate” my work through exhibitions, publications, competitions and taking part in workshops and symposia. In 2011 I demonstrated at the International Ceramic Festival in Aberystwyth, which also has greatly extended my network.\n\nAs to the work load it is important to be organised, to plan ahead and to prioritise the most important events. Occasionally I also employed an assistant and had help in the studio from students and interns.\n\n‘Keeping Time’\n\nYou have had to develop a way of packing and freighting you work around the world. This would often be a problem that stops other new ceramic artists, can you share some of the secrets?\n\nShipping is not really a problem. There are now very good online shipping companies available who offer competitive rates all over the world.\n\nThe real secret is packing. I had very few breakages over the years. One has to allow for plenty of space around the piece filled with protective fillers like polystyrene. Using double boxes is also very good and in general packed like that the piece will arrive safely and sound.\n\n‘Flow’\n\nYour work is in many collections, can you take one or two that have given you particular delight and why?\n\nIt gives me great pleasure to know that my work can be found all over the world. Two collections stand out:\n\nOne is the private collection in California. Paul F. Dauer is an enthusiastic and knowledgeable collector of British studio ceramics, and I am very proud to be part of this fine collection.\n\nThe second one is Museum of Modern Ceramic Art, Gifu, Japan. Two of my ceramic sculptures were added to the collection this year. Created in 2000 the museum focuses on modern ceramic art and aims to represent both functional and non-functional international ceramic art in a beautiful setting, making it to one of the finest ceramic art museum worldwide.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nMy most exciting project at the moment is designing panels to be included in the art work for a large cruise ship. Apart from developing new designs, patterns and shapes the project also involves working with the architect, managing suppliers and being involved in the whole process right from start, all of which is an exciting new departure.\n\n‘Flow’ detail\n\nContact Details\n\nregina_heinz@ceramart.net\n\nRegina Heinz, London, UK\n\nInterview by Deborah Blakeley, October, 2013\n\nby Deborah Blakeley\n\nJohn Short\n\nSketchbooks are an intricate part of your artwork, can you expand on this?\n\nAll through my college years and to date I have used sketchbooks for a variety of functions, the most important one is familiarising myself with the drawing, shapes, foibles and movements of my subjects be they people, birds or animals. I also use them to experiment with arrangements and compositions. In these pages I can experiment with colour and collage. I have always believed that the act of drawing and visualising something means that, however slight, that my idea has become crystallised on paper. That’s really important and I never edit them as the drawings which don’t work out are often the ones that you learn most from. I work with a variety of sizes, shapes and paper surfaces of sketchbooks. They are not regular visual diaries, nor are they meant to be, but places where I record subjects as they unselfconsciously appear in life. At this stage I have many, many volumes and often comb through them for useful fragments in finished paintings back in my studio. I often think of finished paintings as large immediate sketchbook pages.\n\n‘Manly Beach’\n\n‘Birds'\n\nI also followed a lot of the truly exotic bird life around; a highlight was a flock of pelicans at Noosa in Queensland.\n\n‘Pelicans at Noosa'\n\nAlso a series of drawings done during a musical concert in the Hayden Orpheum in Cremorne, a beautifully restored Art Deco movie theatre.\n\nThe plan is to return to Australia next July/August to explore and do more now having taken in a lot of potential locations. I bought a beautiful gigantic A3 moleskin watercolour sketchbook in Shanghai which I used specifically for my Australian travels. I also filled a couple of pocket sized sketchbooks.\n\nYou have sketchbooks, but what other documentation do you do of your work?\n\nMy work methods are fairly simple I will draw my living moving subjects in sketchbooks and use my digital camera for use in recording background locations. Recently I have been working on combining photo transfers (digital images) and ink and watercolour drawings. This has been very interesting technically and I make a lot of use of my camera and colour printer. I have to also keep my website up to date with scanned 2D and photographed 3D works.\n\n'Bloomsday, Ukelele Band'\n\nWhen you do your initial sketches composition is high on your agenda. Can you elaborate on how you get such variation of composition?\n\nWhen I was a student in the Royal College of Art in London I set Sundays aside for visiting galleries and studying composition and colour in paintings. I have always been a big fan of Degas, Hockney, Bruegel, Singer Sergeant, Utamaro and Sydney Nolan to name a few. It helps to study how others construct effective compositions as well as developing and formulating your own.\n\nHow do you manage you work load between teaching, travelling, sketching and time in your studio?\n\nI think the answer to that is to combine a lot of these things. My teaching involves a fair bit of travel and I work in cooperation with a colleague, Tom Kelly, who is a highly experienced photographer. We work together teaching image making (includes drawing, illustration, photography) with visual communication students in Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) and this has involved a lot of location work, regularly in Morocco and China.\n\nOur teaching method includes us producing work on location with the students and followed by a public exhibition of the results of their work and ours. One of the highlights of this practice was a six week location project with our students and students of Shanghai Institute of Visual Arts documenting the gigantic EXPO world fair in China. Otherwise I work in my studio whenever and as much as I can. I’m lucky as I work relatively fast after a lot of preparation and visual research.\n\n'Cormorants, China'\n\nPlace is very important to your work, you get great inspiration while away. Can you discuss how you combine travel and teaching?\n\nAs with the recent trip to Australia for me travelling is always inspiring and it’s not difficult to be inspired and inspire students when on locations abroad. It’s easy to forget how influential these field trips can be for students who often use the wealth of visual research material they collect towards other project work on their return. It must be said that for me it’s very interesting seeing what inspires the students on site also. I’m proud to say that the work we do with the students has been described as a showcase for our School of Art and Design in DIT.\n\n‘Moroccan Sketchbook’\n\nWater is in many of your paintings, can you comment on the mirror effect of painting water?\n\nReflections and wave patterns are lovely things which are fairly difficult to handle. Water changes so much and the effect of reflected light, colour and shadow can be managed if you can control ink and watercolour allowing them to flow and do what they naturally want to do, what I mean is that they are perhaps the most appropriate and subtle media for this subject. Again it helps if you look at how other artists handle water reflections; the American artist John Singer Sergeant for instance did a series of beautiful watery watercolours of boats in Venice. In watercolour, unlike oil painting, it’s easy to see how it is done. It’s incredibly difficult to do it of course but the trick is to make it look effortless.\n\n‘Scotland #3’\n\n‘West Ireland Sketchbook’\n\nEarlier you had commissions from both newspapers and magazines. How has this work developed the work you do today?\n\nI worked for several years as a freelance illustrator for newspapers and publishers in London and in Dublin and I enjoyed the challenge of each job as they came in. I had no idea what might be asked for subject wise from portraits to editorial, to court room drawings, to food illustrations, to book jackets and posters. It was all very demanding but I certainly learned a lot and was able to successfully work from photo libraries and on site to create material for reproduction. I haven’t done any commissioned illustration for many years now but I still enjoy doing family watercolour portraits as commissions. I certainly could write another article about that whole area.\n\nYou are the Senior Lecture in Drawing and Image making at the School of Art & Design, at the Dublin Institute of Technology. Can you share one or two pieces of advice that you give your students?\n\nIt is all about basics and the basics are the same for Drawing, Illustration, Image making and Photography. It goes without saying that being professional is essential and remembers that the world is endlessly hungry for new and original images and ideas. Make sure that you understand what is required in a brief and anything of yours that your mother likes – tear it up!\n\nMany of your paintings are made into prints can you discuss the decisions that must be made in this process?\n\nA selected and limited amount of my paintings have been successfully reproduced as digital prints, or giclee prints as the process is technically known. It’s a highly faithful reproduction of original artwork which is something that you either like or don’t like however there is no denying the beautiful quality of the printed image. Opinion is clearly divided and some gallery owners and collectors can be very sniffy about them but for me a limited edition print can be much more affordable alternative for a lot of people. The decision to print an edition is something I always discuss with the owner of the original. It is true to say that most sales via the website are prints. To distinguish the original from the print I make a point of reproducing it to a slightly smaller size than the original. They are expensive to produce and you need therefore to consider the edition sizes as well as price. With this kind of printing the print companies charge often by the square centimetre and a once off charge for photographing or scanning.\n\nYou do wonderful work capturing the everyday, can you discuss this?\n\nObserving how people move and interact, their body language, their costumes, their shapes and all their imperfections are intensely human and it’s this I find endlessly fascinating and entertaining. In unselfconscious moments people can be very revealing and honest.\n\nIn different locations and cultures the everyday becomes exotic, please discuss?\n\nFor me it is like theatre with lives being acted out in similar ways but in different costumes and locations. People do interact and behave in different social ways and have exotic cultures but underneath they are all still people who have their own individual foibles which are unique. Those are the pearls which you have to look for no matter whether you are here looking at bathers in Ireland or Australia, dancers in China or shoppers in Morocco.\n\n‘Ballet Class in the Park, Shanghai, China’\n\nDiscuss the use of current technology in your art?\n\nI am always looking for new ways to change and develop my work, particularly with the technologies available that are developing at a dynamic pace. It’s all highly seductive of course but what you need to understand is that it all has to work for you and your demands. I use digital photography via software and my printer to achieve what I want to do. Right now its photo transfer and combining media in images but I would love to have time to animate drawings, perhaps that is the next thing? I have done some work in 3D drawings and I would like to experiment with some 3D sculptures on a 3D copier.\n\nCan we look at Forty Foot: please explain the name?\n\nNearby to where we live is a public outdoor bathing place where people swim all year round, summer and winter, I guess for all sorts of reasons, mainly health and life affirming but it’s a real local tradition and has quite understandably become something of a tourist attraction. It’s a natural deep rock pool in Dublin bay which, it is said was named after the Highland regiment 40th of foot who were stationed there in a Napoleonic fort in the 19th century, but its origins are fairly obscure.\n\nInspiration?\n\nFor a charity fund raising event some years ago I was asked to contribute a few paintings that I put together from sketches I had made of bathers at the Forty Foot. They proved to be very popular and I began to supply prints and more paintings to a local gallery and the combination of my quirky drawings and quirky subjects really struck a cord.\n\n‘Winther Bathers - New Year’\n\nLocation?\n\nThe specifics of location are really important to my work. They are all places which are accessible and I think that their charm is that aspect and my visions of those places, that’s why I think that the fusion of media with photographic elements and drawing works and is worth developing. After all photographs have a function and drawings have a function in imagery.\n\n‘Bewleys Café, Dublin, Ireland’\n\nYou have also made 3D images can you explain about this work and in particular related to Forty Feet?\n\nI have made a few series of 3D figurative sculptures from packaging card inspired by the simplicity of Picassos’ simple folded card figures. I worked on a series of local bathers and also a series of couples practising ballroom dance moves from a park in Shanghai. This was a new and enjoyable departure from 2D to 3D and as a French friend of mine said, that it must be very interesting for me to walk around my drawings. Working with cheap materials really appealed also, it makes them somehow more honest and to use that word ‘quirky’ again. There is certainly a lot more development work needed on those but so far so good.\n\nYour aim is for your work to look spontaneous and unplanned but this is not really the case. Please expand on this?\n\nSome time ago I ditched the ubiquitous bouncy castle at one of our son’s birthday parties in favour of having the kids all sit individually for small watercolour portraits, which they all got to take home with them in their goody bags. It really was great fun, it’s a bit of a real party trick actually and at one point as I was painting one of my sitters, I was conscious of a boy watching over my shoulder and nearing completion he called the others through to look and said ‘Wow! It starts of crap and then it’s cool’\n\nActually sounds like a metaphor for my career.\n\nOtherwise…\n\nGiving the impression of spontaneity is important in my work. Being casual and relaxed certainly helps through much practice and draughtsmanship. Often the quickest seemingly throwaway and most immediate use of materials can often capture more than a few too many strokes. Make it look effortless, controlled and well observed.\n\n‘Pelicans, Noosa, Australian Sketchbook’\n\nContact details:\n\nEmail: John@johnshort.ie\n\nWebsite: www.johnshort.ie\n\nJohn Short, Dublin, Ireland\n\nInterview by Deborah Blakeley, August 2013\n\nby Deborah Blakeley\n\nKathy Venter\n\nYou use very traditional techniques of hand coiling and pinching in you work, can you elaborate on your technique?\n\nI began hand building by using the coil method. The application of a thick coil of clay around the circumference of the upper edge of the form and then pinching this coil to blend into the clay form below and upwards to extend and resemble the wall below. To follow the outer line of the form more accurately, I later used smaller lozenges of clay pinched into place. I’ve adapted this method to suit the specific challenges of creating figurative life-size work. Unlike many of my contemporaries, I don’t make use of any life casts, moulds into or over, or modelling over an armature. I finish the shaping of the area I built the day before by bending and paddling the wall – then add a new area of rough form above this and repeat the process.\n\nThe model poses for me throughout.\n\nKathy in her studio\n\nCurrently you have a huge installation at the Gardiner Museum. Could you tell us about your relationship with the museum? How ‘Life’ came about? The time line you had to prepare for this whole exhibition?\n\nThe Gardiner Museum is the largest museum of its kind in Canada and attracts visitors from all over.\n\nThe head curator – Dr. Charles Mason visited my studio having an idea in mind for a large scale exhibition which would be a strong and full use of the new space for contemporary ceramics being built onto the Gardiner at that time.\n\nWhen he saw my work in person he felt this was an answer to the headache of whether a vessel form could ever be referred to as sculpture. The popular theory defined a vessel as any ceramic form enclosing a space – and sculpture not. The popular definition of the vessel as craft is seriously challenged in my art as the hollow clay form created in the making of these sculptures had no practical function and the outside form is obviously sculpture, i.e., fine art. But the technique of pottery making is the fundamental process in creating these works. I have a respect for the basic fundamentals of craft existing in the sculpture of all societies. The argument of art versus craft has traditionally had very little relevance in most societies and I believe that this argument has run its course in the contemporary debate. We have to remember that the work “art” comes from the Greek “ars”, which means craft. So during a period of high art, the best craftsmen were valued. In fact, my sculpture, because of the medium, consistently straddles what could be considered craft and what could be considered fine art. My work has only been exhibited in contemporary fine art galleries.\n\nI had three years to prepare for the show, but this extended into six years because of other commitments for the Gardiner.\n\nAs well as the exhibition, there is a beautiful catalogue: can you discuss how this catalogue came about and your involvement in its production?\n\nI had good documentation of all my work and Deon, my artist husband, put the catalogue together with the images relating to the text. The biography was compiled using images of our early life in South Africa as well as our immigration to Canada in 1989 and subsequent exhibitions.\n\nCan you discuss the importance of humanity and community to your work?\n\n'Coup d’oeil #5'\n\nIn the installation Coup d’Oeil the subject of our collective humanity and community is most evident. These young women are all friends and have been part of this community for most of their lives. Looking at them grouped in the sculpture they could have lived ten thousand years ago or they could be from our times. My intention is for these figures to have the appearance of life itself, in its own process of coming to be. They’re universal. I take the approach of depicting the living persona, without generalization or objectification. Artists have the freedom to also show the enduring qualities in humanity, the strength within society as well as reveal our spiritual capacity. In this way the themes of our humanity are the visions of our poetic intuition and define our emotions. The human body is a universal for all cultures. Our past is linked to our present and all cultures through our humanity.\n\nCeramics and Sculpture are both part of your art practice, can you elaborate?\n\nDuring my years at art school sculpture was my major and ceramics one of my subjects.
