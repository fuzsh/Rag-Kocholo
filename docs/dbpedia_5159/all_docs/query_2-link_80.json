        "text": "Since the end of the 20th century, museum institutions have been adopting the logic of communication, promotion, and administration typical of cultural industries, mainly Cinema. In 1994, Andreas Huyssen argued that the museum, as an elitist place of preservation of canon and high culture, gave way to the museum as a mass medium. Cinema became the paradigm of contemporary cultural activities whose new exhibition practices respond to the changing expectations of the public and their constant search for stellar events.Since the end of the 20th century, museum institutions have been adopting the logic of communication, promotion, and administration typical of cultural industries, mainly Cinema.

Cinema became the paradigm of contemporary cultural activities whose new exhibition practices respond to the changing expectations of the publi...\n\nContemporary art more and more frequently takes the form of a visual or audiovisual event rather than a permanent, stable object – an artefact. Today we increasingly encounter alongside film, the first artistic medium based on moving images, and its continuation – video, various forms of interactive media. As a result of the coexistence of these media, the temporal dimension of the work-event assumes one of two forms. In the first form, the work is linear in structure. Its time span poses a challenge to the traditional relationship between the addressee and the work of art. The addressee should in this case be aware of and accept the fact that it is not he or she who determines the time frame needed to experience a work of art, but rather the work itself. That failure in respect to this principle robs him or her of the possibility of truly experiencing the work. This challenge is one of acceptance and adaptation. In the second form, the work is nonlinear in structure. Here the temporal relationship between viewers and the work is determined by their mutual relations – that is, through a process of interaction. It is this interaction – with the event replacing the objective artefact – that in fact constitutes the experience of the work. In this case, the addressee's attitude cannot be reduced to a simple reaction to the temporal form of the work. But it is also not solely dependent on his or her decisions. It is the result of mutual cooperation between the two sides – the addressee and the work. This challenge is one of participation and cooperation. While the first type of work has found a home in the museum world thanks to the process of videofication the art world has been undergoing since the mid-1990s, pioneers of which include Nam June Paik, Bill Viola and Matthew Barney. The second type has only just begun to make its way into museums. In this chapter, I intend to propose a typology of interactive film and consider how the fates of these different varieties are tied to the institution of the museum, as well as what other environments could serve as a space for presenting it.\n\nSince the 1950s, art institutions have sought to find ways of extending their programming through the use of television, as evidenced by Lynn Spigel’s research on the New York’s Museum of Modern Art’s ‘TV Project’ (TV by Design: Modern Art and the Rise of Network Television. Chicago: U of Chicago Press, 2008). By the mid-1970s, the expansion of cable services in the US meant that smaller institutions such as the Long Beach Museum of Art could expand their exploration of video beyond the spaces of the gallery and produce their own programming for local TV. Informed by these historical examples, this essay examines changes in art institutional uses of television since the 1990s, through reference to curating, commissioning and public programming strategies developed by US institutions including Brooklyn Museum, New York; Long Beach Museum of Art in Long Beach (California); the Hammer Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art (both Los Angeles). It also explores a range of TV-themed projects realised by European art institutions such as Munich Kunstverein; Contemporary Art Centre, Vilnius (Lithuania); Rooseum, Malmo (Sweden); MACBA (Barcelona) and the Institute of Contemporary Arts (London).\n\n\"In this chapter, I argue the case that film, and cinema more broadly, have produced metaphorical and literal shifts of focus and frame within the museum context. The chapter initially discusses the multi-layered ways in which film, as a representational medium and as an exhibited object, interacts with its political and socio-cultural counterpart: the institution of cinema. I then argue that these focal shifts in the treatment of film in the museum, and the treatment of museums on film, potentially eliminate some aspects of the museum from cinema’s perceptual field, while highlighting others, operating as a counter-discourse to the prime concerns of museums at a given moment in time. These aspects are also subject to, and affected by changes in the tangible materiality of cinema, as an object, an experience, an exhibition space, and a cultural institution. Rather than imagining film as a ‘medium’ in the technological or communicative sense, the chapter examines the politics of film as a mediator, negotiator, or indeed critic of museum spaces and museum politics. The ‘visible’ and ‘invisible’ institutions in the title of this chapter refer to these shifts in focus and frame that draw attention toward – or away from – the political and cultural contingency of film in the museum space. Cinema’s historical and contemporary privileged position in French cultural heritage suggests that thinking about French museums specifically informs an understanding of the moving image’s conceptual and spatial shift away from ‘cinema’ as such, towards a broader conception of the medium. ‘Cinema’ as we like to think about it has long since left the auditorium and found itself transmitted across multiple screen media technologies, from the handheld mobile device, to digital streaming, to large-scale screening on tower blocks: such devices have inevitably been adopted by museums as modes of education, interpretation and outreach. Increasingly, ‘cinema’, as a mutable cultural institution that defies visible definition, has made a shift into the ‘museum’: a socio-cultural institution which often courts both physical presence and virtual existence, in add-on digital apps, screen-based interpretation and online exhibition spaces. Consequently, the case studies of this chapter are situated within a French cultural context that offers concrete examples of the complex relationships between cinema and the museum. In doing so, the chapter interrogates the complex political, curatorial and broader socio-cultural concerns of the institutionalized ‘housing’ of film within the museum, both as a public space and as a political institution. \""
