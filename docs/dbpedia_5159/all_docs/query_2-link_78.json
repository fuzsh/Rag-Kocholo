        "text": ">> Close\n\nThe Ship of Fools\n\n2007\n\n4-channel film installation\n\nColour, sound\n\nShot on Super-16mm\n\nConverted to HD-SR and transferred onto Blu-ray Disc\n\nAspect ratio 16:9\n\nLoop, 7 min 23 sec\n\nEdition 6 + 2 ap\n\nIn the four-channel film installation The Ship of Fools (2007), filmed at the Baroque manor Schloss Sacrow near Potsdam, the location itself becomes the protagonist of the scenery through its history. Built during the Romantic period, Schloss Sacrow was temporarily inhabited by artists such as Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy; during World War II, it was home to a Nazi officer; in the course of Germany’s division it was trapped in the death zone of the Berlin Wall and served as a training facility for watchdogs guarding the Berlin Wall, while nowadays it is declared as a World Heritage site and a destination for Sunday strolls. Rosefeldt combines the site – symbolising the metamorphosis and continuity of German national sentiments from the Romantic era through National Socialism, the division of Germany to nowadays – with equally emotionally charged and melancholic scenes reminiscent of Caspar David Friedrich: sheepdogs are defending an old oak tree; a well-built skinhead stares into the far distance before disappearing into the swamp; an opera singer performs Wagner; a ship loaded with a crowd silently waving German flags appears out of nowhere and passes a lone wanderer standing on the shore.\n\nThe work is a sceptical epitaph on German sensitivities and on the still problematic dealing with German identity. Characterised by an agitating immobility, the four tableaux vivants in The Ship of Fools visualise the risk of stagnation.\n\nSummarised from Stefan Berg and Katerina Gregos, in: Julian Rosefeldt: Film Works (2008)\n\nExhibitions / Catalogues"
