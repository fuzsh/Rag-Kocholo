        "text": "Architect and urban designer, Liang Wang came to Syracuse Architecture in fall 2020 as the School’s fifth Harry der Boghosian Fellow .\n\nCultivated Imaginaries: Superblock and the Idea of the City\n\nCULTIVATED IMAGINARIES is the culminating exhibition of Harry der Boghosian Fellow Liang Wang’s year-long research project devoted to the study of the superblock. The results of Wang’s studio and other courses taught over this last year are catalogued and published in two large volumes, which are part of the exhibition. Volume One features forty-one superblock projects redrawn from initial research produced in the seminars. Volume Two collects student design projects produced in seminars and in the Visiting Critic studio. But those materials tell only part of the story. Wang and his students also set out to discover why “superblock,” as a term, concept and reality has been so central to discussions of the contemporary city despite the fact that even today there is no agreed upon definition for the term or its use. What they discovered is that “superblock” is not so much­­­­ a term, concept or reality, but is instead the name for an ambition, shared by the architect and the urbanist alike, to “see all”: to represent, name and thus comprehend the seemingly incomprehensible complexity of the contemporary city.\n\nThe centerpiece of the exhibition is a large model of multiple scales—urban, architecture, interior—that comes in and out of focus depending on how and from what vantage point it is viewed. Indeed, depending on the vantage point, the scales appear not only to be multiple, but indeterminate. To be more precise, the model encourages our eye to move seamlessly between scales and accede to the ambition of “seeing all” named by “superblock” but more often accomplished in the views provided by Song Dynasty landscape paintings. The large model is painted white and filled with copper-colored interior furnishings visible through the frame of what, upon entering the Marble Room through the center doors, appears to be a large white building. As we approach the white frame, the interior spaces of the building do not conform precisely to the expected scale. When viewed more closely, the scale of these three levels with furnishings becomes larger as our eye moves vertically up the model towards the top level. Also, as we move in closer to the model, towers arise beyond the copper furnishings from what appears to be the center of the building. Walking around the model blurs and montages the framed views into the building creating a more fluid, “cinematic” view that allows us to see through and past the interior furnishings where we can make out, though not see in full, an urban block in what, by convention, would be called the building’s atrium.\n\nOn initial approach, views of the urban scale are thus framed by and through the white building, and then as we move closer, by the multiple-scaled interiors, and then more fully—though not entirely—by way of a more kinetic view enabled by walking around the model. Access to a full view of the urban scale is foreclosed, however, by the height of the model itself. Something approximating this full view, though, is enabled through the eye of a camera placed above the model, which provides a continuous video feed projected onto one of the room’s marble walls, also accessible via Bluetooth on a mobile phone. And yet even this unconventional, mediated plan view, which allows us to see the urban, architecture and interior scales all at once, does not enable us to “see all.” The conclusion drawn by Wang and his students seems to be that this full view can only ever be “imagined” and made possible through a rigorous and inventive curation, cultivation and narration of multiple points of view such as the one offered here in this exhibition. As such, the exhibition is perhaps better viewed like a novel in which the spaces themselves are characters in a story whose narrative is driven by the ambition to “see all.” But we are also left to understand that even the fictive, “imagined” view provided by this exhibition is but a single, cultivated imaginary, only one among many possible views or stories. And in this, Wang and his students have truly understood the call to “see all” invoked by the superblock, acknowledging, as all who attempt an answer must, both the impossibility of success and the necessity of the effort.\n\n…\n\nThis exhibition is the result of a truly collective and collaborative process. Special thanks to Michael Speaks, CULTIVATED IMAGINARIES curator and dean of Syracuse Architecture; Julia Czerniak, professor and associate dean of Syracuse Architecture; Emily Hu ’22 (B.Arch) and Lu Zhang (Payette), exhibition production team; Wendy Li ’23 (B.Arch) and Roy Zhang ’23 (B.Arch), exhibition research team; John Bryant, Michael Giannattasio and Robbie Weaver, Syracuse Architecture Fabrication Shop; Andy Molloy and Thuc Phung, Syracuse Architecture IT Services; and all the students enrolled in the fall 2020, spring 2021 and summer 2021 Boghosian Fellowship seminars and studios.\n\nLiang Wang\n\nSyracuse Architecture\n\nHarry der Boghosian Fellow 2020–21\n\nSpace is limited.

This symposium, “Charting Renewal,” will focus on urban design and issues of social and economic justice. This conversation will consider critical questions as the city confronts what comes next: What makes a good community? What is the relationship between public space and private development? How does good design contribute to the success of neighborhoods and the people who live there? What can we learn from successful housing models elsewhere?\n\nThis is the first of three planned events addressing housing issues in Syracuse, and will create a dialogue among and between residents, local leaders, and national experts on the history and impact of other urban revitalization projects.\n\nParticipants\n\nLanessa Chaplin, Esq.\n\nAssistant Director at the New York Civil Liberties Union\n\nLizabeth Cohen\n\nHoward Mumford Jones Professor of American Studies, Department of History, Harvard University\n\nLawrence Vale\n\nAssociate Dean and Ford Professor of Urban Design and Planning, MIT\n\nJohn Washington\n\nOrganizer and Political Educator, People’s Action\n\nModerator\n\nDevon Patton\n\nTV News Anchor, Spectrum News\n\nCity Scripts is a partnership between the School of Architecture and the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. The partners hope their collaboration will help to ensure that inclusive policy and design are at the forefront of challenges facing cities in the United States and around the world. The goal of the City Scripts symposia is to create an ongoing, interdisciplinary and applied dialogue that reaches beyond the university and influences both policy and design.\n\nThe “Charting Renewal” forum is supported by The Kresge Foundation’s American Cities Program, the Syracuse University Collaboration for Unprecedented Success and Excellence (CUSE) grant program, the Campbell Public Affairs Institute at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs , the School of Architecture, and Syracuse University. It is organized by School of Architecture Associate Professors Elizabeth Kamell and Lawrence Davis, undergraduate chair; and Maxwell School Professors Carol Faulkner, associate dean, and Grant Reeher, director of the Campbell Public Affairs Institute.\n\nTo gain access to the event weblink, register below.\n\nBlackness, as both a conceptual orientation as well as a way of thinking through living, is embedded within the built environment while also incontrovertibly linked to histories of systems through which oppression and segregation were designed. The effects of systemic, structural racism for centuries established the means by which anti-Black sentiment was not only enforced through architecture and the landscape but also widely adopted at all scales of development, including education, medicine, museums, infrastructure, industry and housing throughout the United States.\n\nReconstructions: Architecture and Blackness in America , co-curated with Mabel O. Wilson, set to open in February 2021 at The Museum of Modern Art, will be the first exhibition for which Black and African Diasporic architects, artists and designers will be the sole focus of a show that will observe, question and speak to the celebration of Black Life rather than excavating such histories of disenfranchisement, violence and despair. Discussing the ten commissioned projects of The Black Reconstruction Collective, join Associate Curator Sean Anderson for a conversation about the exhibition and its ambitions with a response from Assistant Professor Sekou Cooke , one of the exhibition’s participants.\n\nSean Anderson is Associate Curator in the Department of Architecture and Design at The Museum of Modern Art. He has practiced as an architect and taught in Afghanistan, Australia, India, Italy, Morocco, Sri Lanka and the U.A.E. His second book, In-Visible Colonies: Modern Architecture and its Representation in Colonial Eritrea (2015) was nominated for an AIFC Book Prize in Non-Fiction. Earlier this year, he curated the exhibition On Muzharul Islam: Surfacing Intention at the Dhaka Art Summit. At MoMA, he has organized the exhibitions Insecurities: Tracing Displacement and Shelter (2016-17), Thinking Machines: Art and Design in the Computer Age, 1959-89 (2017-18) as well as collaborative collection displays including Surrounds (2019), Inner and Outer Space (2019-20) and Building Citizens (Present). Sean manages the Young Architects Program (YAP) and the Issues in Contemporary Architecture series, with the next exhibition opening in February 2021 and its associated Field Guide organized with Mabel O. Wilson, Reconstructions: Architecture and Blackness in America .\n\nThis year’s symposium, “Stretchy Cities” features presentations by leading experts and discussion among local office-holders and the audience concerning regional urban government and a “stretched” urban landscape. The symposium will examine the intersections of public policy, economics and urban space.\n\nExperts, local officials and the audience will consider the most pressing governance issues involved in an increasingly complex and varied urban landscape, the government’s impact on the built environment, and whether to preserve the classic urban core and local authority or accommodate a new regional urban reality.\n\n“Stretchy Cities” continues the public deliberation on governance and planning in Syracuse, but also offers a constructive reference point for other North American metropolitan areas as they engage in similar discussions on their future political and spatial composition.\n\nThe symposium is the fifth in the interdisciplinary City Scripts series, which examines the intersections of public policy, economics, and spatial practice.\n\nSpeakers\n\nDavid Owen\n\nCritic, author of Green Metropolis: Why Living Smaller, Living Closer, and Driving Less Are the Keys to Sustainability, and staff writer, The New Yorker.\n\nRoger Keil\n\nProfessor of Environmental Studies and research chair in Global Sub/Urban Studies at York University; author of Suburban Planet: Making the World Urban from Outside In\n\nRespondents\n\nKhalid Bey\n\nSyracuse Common Council, councilor at-large and president pro tempore; author, The African American Dilemma\n\nEdward M. Michalenko, Ph.D.\n\nSupervisor, Town of DeWitt, New York; President, Onondaga Environmental Institute\n\nModerator\n\nMary Anne Ocampo\n\nPrincipal, Sasaki Associates, Boston, Ma.; Lecturer of Urban Design in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThe City Scripts symposia series and accompanying website are made possible by a unique partnership between the School of Architecture and the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. The partners believe their collaboration will insure that policy and design are at the forefront when confronting the challenges facing cities in the United States and around the world. The goal of the symposia is to create an ongoing, interdisciplinary and applied dialogue that reaches beyond the university and, ultimately, influences both policy and design. The website extends the life and impact of the symposia, creating a dynamic resource open to a global audience.\n\nThe “Stretchy Cities” symposium is curated by Syracuse Architecture associate professors Elizabeth Kamell and Lawrence Davis, undergraduate chair; Carol Faulkner, Maxwell School professor of history and associate dean; and Grant Reeher, director of the Campbell Public Affairs Institute within the Maxwell School.\n\nThe City Scripts series is co-sponsored by Syracuse University’s School of Architecture and the Campbell Public Affairs Institute within the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs and funded in part by the Collaboration for Unprecedented Success and Excellence (CUSE) grant program.\n\nEllie Abrons is a licensed architect, principal of T+E+A+M, and Assistant Professor of Architecture at the University of Michigan Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, where she was the A.

But crumbling industrial artifacts offer unprecedented opportunity for innovative design and re-invention of cities in the 21st century.\n\nA forgotten product of the post-industrial environment and rapid technological change, abandoned industrial structures are increasingly explored as history worth preserving and sites worth reinventing. Scattered across our city’s edges, ruined manufacturing sites now offer our greatest opportunities for innovative public spaces, equitable housing, resiliency against climate change, and radical contemporary design.\n\nThis lecture will investigate innovative projects by Manhattan based STUDIO V Architecture that are reinventing these sites and transforming our cities. It will explore Maker Park, a contemporary park in abandoned oil tanks on the Brooklyn Waterfront; Empire Stores, a Civil War-era coffee warehouse transformed into a museum, startups, and rooftop public park; and for the first time show their new designs for Silo City, the transformation of the iconic and ruined Grain Elevators in Buffalo into a cultural and arts center. These projects portray how the ruins of our industrial past can be preserved to benefit communities and transform our cities.\n\nJay Valgora’s Manhattan based practice, STUDIO V Architecture, is dedicated to the reinvention of the contemporary city. The Studio addresses multiple themes in its designs including creating a new architecture of transformative edges and sustainable communities, radical adaptive reuse, and experiments in innovative structures and fabrication.\n\nSTUDIO V has designed an extraordinary range of work advancing these issues. The Studio’s work encompasses reimagining New York City’s waterfront in all five boroughs including Astoria, Inwood, Flushing, DUMBO, Gravesend, Sunset Park, and Staten Island. Innovative designs for the Empire Stores and Bronx Post Office combine historic and contemporary architecture. The exploration of radical structures and fabrication includes Yonkers Raceway, MOBI pavilion, and Morimoto Asia.\n\nMr. Valgora has thirty years of experience in multiple disciplines including architecture, urban design, and industrial design. Mr. Valgora earned a Master of Architecture from Harvard, a Bachelor of Architecture from Cornell University and was a Fulbright Fellow to the United Kingdom where he began his studies of reinventing former industrial waterfronts.\n\nMr. Valgora’s work has received numerous awards including national, state, and local AIA awards, International Design Award, Architizer A+ Awards, Architectural Record Award, among many others. His work is featured in numerous publications including The New York Times, Fast Company, Architectural Record, Dwell, Wall St. Journal, New York Magazine, Crain’s New York, and Architect’s Newspaper. He is currently completing a book on the contemporary transformation of cities titled Last Utopia.\n\nJayna Zweiman is a multidisciplinary artist and designer. Her independent practice combines architecture, art, craft and new media to focus on experiences that overlap physical, virtual and conceptual spaces.\n\nPerhaps best known as the co-creator/co-founder of The Pussyhat Project, an international network and movement of women’s rights supporters, Zweiman has become a leading advocate of using design innovation to enact social change. The Pussyhat Project became a worldwide phenomenon at the 2017 Women’s Marches with one of the largest crowd-sourced art advocacy projects ever. She is also the creator and founder of Welcome Blanket, a reconceptualization of the 2000-mile length of the proposed border wall as 2000-mile length of yarn to make individual welcome blankets for new immigrants coming to the United States.\n\nZweiman’s work has been exhibited and published internationally. In 2017, her work has been nominated for the Beazley Design of the Year by the Design Museum in London, acquired by the Victoria & Albert Museum, and awarded the first ever Brand of the Year by the School of Visual Arts. Zweiman was awarded in 2017 as one of “The 25 People Who Defined Visual Culture” by Artsy.\n\nZweiman received her AB from Brown University in visual arts and economics and her Masters in Architecture from Harvard University Graduate School of Design. She lives and works in Los Angeles.\n\nIn her talk, Zweiman questions how can we use design and architecture to craft the world we wish to see? We will investigate the overlap between individual stories and collective conversations, between craft and politics, and between physical and virtual communities in both Pussyhat Project and Welcome Blanket. Join Zweiman to discuss how these design interventions create social change by reimagining our spaces and systems.\n\nCo-sponsors for this event\n\nThe Humanities Center\n\nSchool of Art\n\nMaxwell School\n\nSchool of Architecture\n\nEvent to take place in Slocum Hall first-floor atrium\n\nSince 2014, when he retired as Smith Professor of Humanities in the departments of Classics and Art History at Case Western Reserve University, Charles Burroughs has been Adjunct Professor of Art History at Geneseo. Previously he taught at SUNY Binghamton, UC Berkeley Architecture School, Northwestern, and the Rome Program of Trinity College. He has degrees from Oxford (BA) and London (PhD), and was a visiting member of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. His scholarly interests encompass Italian architecture and urbanism of the 14th to 17th centuries, Renaissance painting and art writing (he has published on Alberti, Michelangelo, and Botticelli, on whom he is writing a book), and plantation landscapes in the Americas, including the Hudson Valley. Since settling in Rochester he has been working on a revisionist account of Frederick Law Olmsted’s plans for the park system, and on the impact of Jane Jacobs’ ideas about city life on the design, by an associate of hers, of an academic facility in upstate New York, a building that marked an early departure from modernist orthodoxy.\n\nLecture overview\n\nAnyone who has strolled through a historic Italian city recalls streets framed by impressive house facades, forming a surprisingly uniform backdrop to the choreography of the streets while registering, more or less subtly, the status of individual occupants. The architectural facade has a history. As part of a building, the facade arises in late medieval Italy and eventually meets a fatal challenge in the reaction against 20th century modernism (its more recent resurrection is not my topic). The facade is also a cultural phenomenon, coinciding with the era of portraiture, the Renaissance emphasis on the human face, not so much as a window into the soul as a crucial site of dissimulation and insincerity. For Renaissance architects the facade was a surface requiring a harmonious and unified design, incorporating an element, the entrance, that potentially disturbs the integrity of the whole. Especially baroque facades concentrate the typical rhetorical dimension at the portal, as key interface of interior and exterior, the source of (claimed) power and the arena of its projection. This talk will review examples in Italy and France of the tension in many facades of between the expression of passage and the implementation of ideal principles of design, and will discuss inventive responses to the challenge of the facade.\n\nThis unique lecture will focus on the theme of urbanism and theatre. Randy Weiner will talk about immersive theater, his history, and what he is working on now. It is held in conjunction with visiting critic Bing Bu’s “Double Scripted Urban Play” fall 2017 studio.\n\nAbout Randy Weiner\n\nWeiner​ is a producer, venue owner, and playwright. He has been hailed as “the leading impresario of nontraditional theater in New York” by the New York Times, and “a mad genius of nightlife” by The Wall Street Journal. He is the recipient of two Drama Desk Awards (“Sleep No More” and “Queen of the Night”).\n\nWith partners Simon Hammerstein and Richard Kimmel, Weiner created the theater nightclub, The Box (first in New York, then in London), for which he continues to serve as a Managing Partner.\n\nWith Hammerstein, Weiner created The Box’s sister nightclub, The Act, in Dubai. Also with Hammerstein, their dinner spectacular, “Queen of the Night,” opened in 2014 at The Diamond Horseshoe in The Paramount Hotel in Times Square, New York City. “Queen of the Night” has been licensed for further productions in Tokyo, Shanghai, Beijing, and Las Vegas.\n\nWith partners Jonathan Hochwald and Arthur Karpati, Weiner produced Punchdrunk’ “Sleep No More” in New York City at the formerly abandoned McKittrick Hotel. Weiner and his partners have gone on to restore The McKittrick Hotel to include a jazz club, Manderley Bar; a restaurant, The Heath; and a roof garden, Gallow Green.\n\nWith his wife, Tony Award Winning Director Diane Paulus, Weiner created “The Donkey Show,” a disco adaptation of A Midsummer Night’s Dream that has been produced in New York, London, Madrid, Geneva, Edinburgh, Helsinki, Seoul, and throughout the United States.\n\nWeiner is the creator of OBERON, the theater ​nightclub that is the second stage at A.R.T. at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Weiner has worked as a designer for Cirque du Soleil on multiple occasions, and most recently served as the dramaturg for their touring tent show “Amaluna.” Weiner has also collaborated with MIT Media Lab composer Tod Machover and United States Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky to create the opera “Death and the Powers,” a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nWeiner has been a member of the Advisory Committee on the Arts at Harvard University and has lectured on theater at Harvard, Columbia University, Barnard College, New York University, and Yale University. Weiner’s work as an entrepreneur in the arts is the subject of a Harvard Business School case study.\n\nWhat kind of city should Los Angeles become?\n\nThe question strikes at the heart of challenging and polarizing issues Angelenos struggle with as their city faces the effects of rapid growth and rapid urban transformation. Perhaps no issue defines the challenges faced by Los Angles, and indeed cities across North America, more than housing: Should there be more or less public housing? More or less market rate development? What should be the mix of public and private housing? And should new housing, whether public or market rate, be more or less dense?\n\nThe Syracuse Architecture undergraduate program presents the third installment of “Density: Through Thick and Thin,” a 3-part series of discussions on re-surging issues about urban density in the 21st century.\n\nAs we face pressures of global population explosion, measurable and alarming ecological stress and related urbanization, the symposia offer an arena to discuss the current and near future status of the fundamental quality of built environments. Join us as we focus on discourse occurring in LA and a larger discussion about the various modes of urban density and their relation to environmental, economic, social, cultural and political quality.\n\nThursday, March 30, 5:30pm-7:30pm\n\nSlocum Auditorium\n\nGreg Goldin\n\nArchitectural critic and writer\n\nSam Lubell\n\nArchitectural critic and writer\n\nStuart Rosenthal\n\nUrban economist, professor, Maxwell Advisory Board Professor of Economics\n\nLemir Teron\n\nEnvironmental justice and policy; Assistant Professor, SUNY-ESF,\n\nJamie Winder\n\nUrban geographer; O’Hanley Faculty Scholar, Professor, Maxwell School\n\nFrancisco Sanin, Moderator\n\nProfessor, Syracuse Architecture\n\nSponsored by the Syracuse Architecture undergraduate program, Associate Professor Lawrence Davis, Chair; Curated by Associate Professor Elizabeth Kamell and Assistant Professor Tarek Rakha\n\nParticipant bios\n\nGreg Goldin\n\nGreg Goldin was the architecture critic at Los Angeles Magazine from 1999 to 2011.

Similarly to art (and other aspects of humanity), architecture has not been a stranger to persistent questions for absolutes. Questions of authorship, source, imitation or creation, blending-in or standing-out are prevailing.\n\nHowever, the world we live in cannot be understood as a singular entity - the in-between happens to be our current reality. Uncertainty is understood to be an obstacle in architectural practice today, and the fallacy that it can be avoided through rigorous planning and design remains persistent.\n\nWe experience a new paradigm shift where public and private blend into one another; with the ever-growing, multi-layered digital presence of our real-time, social networking reality, we are, more than ever, confronted with a multiplicity of media platforms that challenge both our perception of our environment, as well as our multivalent presence in it. Therefore, maybe, uncertainty can become a chance for new conversations instead of reasons for capitulation.”\n\nThis symposium invites architects to examine their work through the lens of “ishness, in-between & other uncertainties.” A series of short presentations by the participants will lead to a round table discussion that will further shape a conversation around the potential of “ishness” in architectural practice.\n\nFormat\n\nThree panel discussions, each with a 15-minute intro by Maya Alam, followed by a round table discussion moderated by Dean Michael Speaks .\n\nSymposium participants\n\nKristy Balliet\n\nBalliet Studio / BairBalliet / Ohio State University’s Knowlton School of Architecture & Southern California Institute of Architecture (Sci-Arc)\n\nErin Besler\n\nBesler & Sons / UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture\n\nSarah Blankenbaker\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago College of Architecture and the Arts\n\nMira Henry\n\nSouthern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc)\n\nMolly Hunker\n\nSPORTS / Syracuse University School of Architecture\n\nNicole McIntosh\n\nArchitecture Office / Syracuse University School of Architecture\n\nCarrie Norman\n\nNorman Kelley / Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP)\n\nRosalyne Shieh\n\nSchaum/Shieh Architects / Yale School of Architecture\n\nJulien De Smedt is the founder and director of JDS Architects based in Brussels, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Shanghai.

Adjaye Associates’ largest completed project to date is the £160 million Moscow School of Management Skolkovo (2010).\n\nIn the United States Adjaye was the designer of a new home for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver (2007), two public libraries in Washington DC (2012), as well as of several innovative residential projects. In 2009 a team led by Adjaye was selected to design the new $360 million Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall in Washington DC. The practice has also completed a social housing scheme in New York’s Sugar Hill (2014) and the Ethelbert Cooper Gallery of African & African American Art at Harvard’s Hutchins Center (2014). Adjaye is currently working on the new home for the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Ruby City building for the Linda Pace Foundation in San Antonio, and a condominium development for Four Seasons in Washington DC.\n\nAdjaye Associates now has offices in London, New York, and Accra, with projects throughout the world. These include the Aishti Foundation shopping and cultural complex in Beirut (2015), the Alara concept store in Lagos (2014), and a new headquarters building for the International Finance Corporation in Dakar (ongoing).\n\nAdjaye frequently collaborates with contemporary artists on art and installation projects. Examples include The upper room, with thirteen paintings by Chris Ofili (2002), Within reach, a second installation with Ofili in the British pavilion at the Venice Biennale (2003), and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Art for the 21st Century Pavilion that was designed to show a projection work by Olafur Eliasson, Your black horizon, at the 2005 Venice Biennale. The upper room is now in the permanent collection of Tate Britain. Adjaye recently collaborated with Okwui Enwezor on the design of the 56th Venice Art Biennale (2015).\n\nAdjaye has taught at the Royal College of Art, where he had previously studied, and at the Architectural Association School in London, and has held distinguished professorships at the universities of Pennsylvania, Yale and Princeton. He is currently the John C. Portman Design Critic in Architecture at Harvard. He was awarded the OBE for services to architecture in 2007, received the Design Miami/ Year of the Artist title in 2011 and the Wall Street Journal Innovator Award in 2013.\n\nThe material from Adjaye’s ten-year study of the capital cities of Africa was shown in Urban Africa, an exhibition at the Design Museum, London (2010) and published as African Metropolitan Architecture (New York, 2011, and as Adjaye Africa Architecture, London, 2011). He was the artistic director of GEO- graphics: A map of art practices in Africa, past and present, a major exhibition at the Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels (2010). An exhibition of his architectural work, David Adjaye: Output, was held at Gallery MA, Tokyo (2010). In 2015 a comprehensive retrospective exhibition of his work to date was held at Haus der Kunst in Munich and the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAdjaye Associates has recently been named as one of 7 finalists for the design of the future Obama Presidential Library in Chicago.\n\nAccessibility entrance\n\nPlease enter at the ground-floor level entrance on College Place and take the elevator to Floor 2.\n\nSusan Dieterlen holds joint appointments as a Research Assistant Professor in the School of Architecture at Syracuse University, and as a Faculty Research Fellow at the Syracuse Center of Excellence. Her research investigates human behavior and environments, with a focus on urban neighborhoods during economic transformations. She is the author of several publications, including those within Environment and Behavior and the Journal of Urbanism, as well as a book-length scholarly monograph. She also blogs at City Wild on www.susandieterlen.com .\n\nHer work identifies opportunities during economic change to create more equitable, sustainable, and prosperous places for people. Such transformations can provide increased equality and understanding across demographic divisions, as communities pull together toward common goals. The publication of her book, Immigrant Pastoral: Midwestern Landscapes and Mexican-American Neighborhoods (Routledge, 2015) caps a decade of work focusing on immigration’s transformation of small postindustrial cities and rural meatpacking towns.\n\nA related line of work explores social and behavioral impacts of increasing urban nature and neglect. This includes studies of crime and social capital in areas of tree canopy and understory vegetation, especially unmaintained spontaneous vegetation. This work incorporates an approach of trade-offs between costs and benefits, including the increasing need to mitigate climate change impacts in cash-strapped municipalities. Dr. Dieterlen is currently conducting studies in this area and lecturing on it nationally.\n\nAdditional work includes projects with the Syracuse Center of Excellence involving the transformation to a post-carbon age through the incorporation of clean and distributed energy generation and use. Current studies include the use of community microgrids to promote economic revitalization of disadvantaged neighborhoods in postindustrial cities. Her work also engages the dismantling/vacating of fossil-fuel infrastructure and its profound impacts on the physical environment and public acceptance.\n\nPrior to joining Syracuse University, Dr. Dieterlen taught as a faculty member in the SUNY-ESF Landscape Architecture program. She has taught a wide range of design studios as well as courses on environment and behavior research, applied research methods, and postindustrial cities. Her teaching emphasizes critical thinking and connecting interdisciplinary research to built design work, and involves a unique combination of scholarly rigor and real-world business expertise.\n\nIn addition to an undergraduate professional degree in landscape architecture from Purdue University, Dr. Dieterlen holds a Master of Landscape Architecture and a doctorate in Landscape Architecture from the University of Michigan. She is also a registered landscape architect with several years of full-time professional practice experience, including the founding of Prologue, a small design practice."
