        "text": "Rural Roots Deeply attached to their patch of land, people in this predominantly rural neck of the woods, with only a dusting of small towns, are not simply Italian or Tuscan. Harking back to centuries of coexistence as rival political entities with their own style of architecture, school of painting, bell tower and so on, it is the paese (home town) or, in the case of Siena and other towns, the contrada (neighbourhood) in which one is born that reigns supreme. For most, such campanilismo (literally, ‘loyalty to one’s bell tower’) is all-consuming. ‘Better a death in the family than a Pisan at the door’ says an old Florentine proverb with reference to the historic rivalry between the Tuscan towns. Passionate, proud, reserved, hard-working, family-oriented, fond of food and wine, thrifty, extremely self-conscious and proud of their appearance are characteristics attributed to Tuscans across the board. Brash, no, but in Florence Florentines like to make it known where they stand in society. From oversized doorknobs to sculpted stonework, overt statements of wealth and power are everywhere in this class-driven city, whose dialect – penned for the world to read by literary greats Dante, Boccaccio and Petrarch in the 14th century – is deemed the purest form of Italian. Titled Florentines are still alive and well, accounting for a tiny fraction of contemporary Florentine society. From the 12th century until the Renaissance, when wealth and ability overtook aristocratic ranking, titles – prince, duke, marques, count, viscount, baron, patrician and noble – ruled the roost. Florentine nobility derived mainly from bankers and merchants, and many of the city’s most wonderful properties and countryside estates remain in the hands of counts and barons – Europe’s largest private walled garden, the Giardini di Torrigiani, is a prime example. In the city, elderly nobles still gather each week at Florence’s exclusive, elusive Circolo dell’ Unione (aka ‘club of nobles’), enthroned since 1852 in a palazzo on Florence’s most aristocratic street, Via de’ Tournabuoni. Membership is not hereditary and costs a (large) fee. Some 60% of the club’s 400-odd members (of which just a handful are female) bear a title – though titles have not been recognised by the Italian state since 1948, following the fall of the Italian monarchy. The Tuscan Way of Life Romanticised the world over, Tuscany has impassioned more writers, designers and film-makers than any other region. Yet what is it that makes the birthplace of Gucci, Cavalli and the Vespa scooter so inspiring, so dolce (sweet)? Florence takes the lead with its artistic heritage and tradition of master craftsmanship, but Tuscan style, grace and appreciation of beauty find expression in an extraordinary attention to detail, a quest for perfection and a dauntless pride in local dialect and history. No title better delves into the essence of Tuscan life than The Wisdom of Tuscany: Simplicity, Security and the Good Life – Making the Tuscan Lifestyle Your Own by Ferenc Màté. Unesco World Heritage Sites Historic centre of Florence Pisa’s Piazza dei Miracoli Historic centre of Siena Val d’Orcia Historic centre of San Gimignano Historic centre of Pienza Medici villas and gardens 299 ©Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd\n\nLa Dolce Vita Life is dolce (sweet) for this privileged pocket of Italy, one of the country’s wealthiest enclaves, where the family reigns supreme, and tradition and quality trump quantity. From the great names in viticulture to the flower-producing industry of Pescia and the small-scale farms of rural Tuscany, it is family-run businesses handed down generations that form the backbone of this proud, strong region. In Florence – the only city with a faint hint of the cosmopolitan – daily life is the fastest paced. Florentines rise early, drop their kids at school by 8am, then flit from espresso to the office by 9am. Lunch is a lengthy affair for these food- and wine-loving people, as is the early-evening aperitivo, enjoyed in a bar with friends to whet the appetite for dinner. For younger Florentines, who bear the brunt of Florence’s ever-rising rent and salaries that scarcely increase, it is quite common to treat the lavish aperitivo spread like dinner – enter apericena. Smokers, fast dwindling, puff on pavements outside. There is no better time of day or week than late Sunday afternoon to witness the passeggiata (early-evening stroll), a wonderful tradition that sees Tuscans in towns don a suitable outfit and walk – to get a gelato, chat, meet friends, mooch, contemplate the sunset and, quite simply, relish the close of the day at an exceedingly relaxed pace. Theatre, concerts, art exhibitions (the free opening on Thursday evenings at Florence’s Palazzo Strozzi is always packed) and il calcio (football) entertain after hours. Tuscany’s top professional football club, ACF Fiorentina, has a fanatical fan base (check the memorabilia in Florence’s Trattoria Mario). Weekends see many flee their city apartments for less urban climes, where the din of motorini (scooters) whizzing through the night lessens and there’s more space and light. Green countryside is a mere 15-minute getaway from lucky old Florence, unlike many urban centres where industrial sprawl really sprawls. Casa Dolce Casa By their very nature, family-oriented Tuscans travel little (many live all their lives in the town of their birth) and place great importance on casa dolce casa (home, sweet home) – the rate of home ownership in Tuscany is among Europe’s highest. The rural lifestyle is driven by close-knit, ancient communities in small towns and villages, where local matters and gossip are more important than national or world affairs. Everyone knows everyone to the point of being clannish, making assimilation for outsiders hard – if not A PEASANT’S LIFE Mezzadria (sharecropping), a medieval form of land management in place until 1979, was the key to success in the Tuscan countryside. Contadini (peasants) lived and worked on the land, receiving in return a home for their traditionally large families (typically consisting of 10 people – the more hands the better) and 50% of the crops or profit reaped from the land they worked. The other half went to the padrone (land owner), who often did not live on his fattoria (agricultural estate) but in the city. Post-WWII industrialisation saw the birth of the tractor and the first shift in the equal balance between landowner and peasant: farmers had no money to buy tractors, obliging owners to invest instead and so upsetting the apple cart in terms of who gave how much. Gradually farm workers gravitated towards towns in search of better-paid jobs, the 1960s witnessing a particularly large exodus and prompting the eventual collapse of sharecropping and many a Tuscan farm with it.

Farming is the self-sufficient way of life, albeit one that is becoming increasingly difficult – hence the mushrooming of agriturismi (farm-stay accommodation), as farmers stoically utilise every resource they have to make ends meet. At one time the domain of Tuscany’s substantial population of well-off Brits (there’s good reason why playwright John Mortimer dubbed Chianti ‘Chiantishire’ in his 1988 novel and 1989 TV adaptation Summer’s Lease), the region’s bounty of stylish stone villas and farmhouses with terracotta floors, wood-burning fireplaces and terraces with views are now increasingly passing back into the hands of Tuscans eagerly rediscovering their countryside. In both urban and rural areas, children typically remain at home until they reach their 30s, often only leaving the nest to wed. In line with national trends, Tuscan families are small, with one or two kids; around 20% of households are childless and 25% are single. Despite increasing numbers of working women, chauvinistic attitudes remain well entrenched in more rural areas. La Festa Delve into the mindset of a Tuscan and a holy trinity of popular folklore, agricultural tradition and religious rite of passage dances before your eyes – which pretty much translates as la festa (party!). No cultural agenda is more jam-packed with ancient festivities than theirs: patron saints alone provide weeks of celebration, given that every village, town, profession, trade and social group has a saint to call its own and venerate religiously. La festa climaxes – not once but twice – with Siena’s soul-stirring Il Palio, a hot-blooded horse race conceived in the 12th century to honour the Virgin Mary and revamped six centuries on to celebrate the miracles of the Madonna of Provenzano (2 July) and the Assumption (16 August). Deeply embroiled in its religious roots is a fierce contrada rivalry, not to mention a penchant for dressing up and a respect for tradition that sees horses blessed before the race, jockeys riding bareback and the silk banner for the winner of August’s race ritually designed by Sienese artists and the July banner by non-Sienese. (Legend says that a Sienese bride marrying in far-off lands took with her earth from her contrada to put beneath the legs of her marital bed to ensure that her offspring would be conceived on home soil.) Although it’s by no means the social force it once was, Catholicism (the religion of 85% of the region) and its rituals nevertheless play a key role COFFEE CULTURE Coffee is not just a drink but a way of life for Tuscans, whose typical day is punctuated with caffeine, the type of coffee depending wholly on time of day and occasion. The number-one cardinal rule: cappuccino (espresso topped with hot, frothy milk), caffè latte (milkier version with less froth) and latte macchiato (warmed milk ‘stained’ with a spot of coffee) are only ever drunk at breakfast or in the early morning. If you’re truly Tuscan, though, the chances are you’ll probably grab a speed espresso (short, sharp shot of strong, black coffee) or caffè doppio (double espresso) standing up at the bar with everyone else at your favourite cafe on the way to work. Lunch and dinner only end one way: with un caffè (literally ‘a coffee’, meaning an espresso and nothing else), although come dusk it is quite acceptable to finish with un caffè corretto (espresso with a dash of grappa or another spirit). Sitting down at a table in a cafe to have a coffee is four times more expensive than drinking it standing at the bar. Lose yourself in the culinary and cultural beauty of the Tuscan home with Emiko Davies’ Florentine (2016), an inspirational cookbook with exquisite photography, a ‘romantic nostalgia’ vibe and plenty of astute musings on modern life in the Renaissance city. 301 The Tuscan Way of Life La Festa\n\nin daily lives: first Communions, church weddings and religious feast days are an integral part of Tuscan society. Bella Figura A sense of style is vital to Tuscans, who take great pride in their dress and appearance to ensure their bella figura (good public face). Dressing impeccably comes naturally to most, and for most Florentines chic is a byword. Indeed it was in their beautiful city that the Italian fashion industry was born and bred. Guccio Gucci and Salvatore Ferragamo got the haute-couture ball rolling in the 1920s with boutiques in Florence. And in 1951 a well-heeled Florentine nobleman called Giovanni Battista Giorgini held a fashion soirée in his Florence home that spawned Italy’s first prét-à-porter fashion shows. The catwalk quickly shifted to Florence’s Palazzo Pitti, where Europe’s most prestigious fashion shows dazzled until 1971 (when the women’s shows moved to Milan). The menswear shows stayed put, though, and top designers still leg it to Florence twice a year to unveil their menswear collections at the Pitti Immagine Uomo fashion shows and their creations for bambini (kids) at Pitti Bimbo. Tuscan Design Never has Italian design been so expressive as in 1963, when Piaggio in Pontedera, 25km east of Pisa, launched the Vespa 50, a motorised scooter requiring no driving licence. Overnight it became a ‘must-have’ item as Italy’s young things snapped up the machine and the freedom and independence it gave. All of Europe’s Vespas are still made in the Tuscan plant where the original ‘wasp’ was born in 1946. While Audrey Hepburn was cruising around Rome side-saddle on a Vespa for Hollywood, a group of anti-establishment artists and architects were busy building a reputation for Florence as the centre of 1960s avant-garde design. The groups Radical Design, Archizoom and Superstudio were all founded in Florence in 1966, and included hot-shot Florentines Massimo Morozzi (b 1941; buy his pasta set from Alessi) and Andrea Branzi (b 1938), whose furniture designs are timeless. As with fashion, the design scene moved to Milan in the 1970s, starving Tuscany of its cutting edge. Tuscan Icons The Vespa scooter Gucci Chianti wine Michelangelo’s David Renaissance art Italians Dance and I’m a Wallflower by Florence-based author Linda Malcone provides a cracking insight into local behaviour and cultural expression. It’s published by The Florentine Press (www.theflor entinepress. com), a fabulous resource for publications (print and ebook) in English covering everything from arts and culture to politics, travel and humour. 302The Tuscan Way of Life B e ll a Figur a\n\nA Country Kitchen It was above an open wood fire in la cucina contadina (the farmer’s kitchen) that Tuscan cuisine was cooked up. Its basic premise: don’t waste a crumb. During the 13th and 14th centuries, when Florence prospered and the wealthy started using silver cutlery instead of fingers, simplicity remained the hallmark of dishes served at lavish banquets thrown by feuding families as a show of wealth. And while the Medici passion for flaunting the finer things in life during the Renaissance gave Tuscan cuisine a fanciful kick, with spectacular sugar sculptures starring alongside spit-roasted suckling pig, ordinary Tuscans continued to rely on the ageold cucina povera (poor dishes) to keep hunger at bay. Contemporary Tuscan cuisine remains faithful to these humble roots, using fresh local produce and eschewing fussy execution. A Bloody Affair: Meat & Game The icon of Tuscan cuisine is Florence’s bistecca alla fiorentina, a chargrilled T-bone steak rubbed with olive oil, seared on the chargrill, seasoned, and served al sangue (blue and bloody). A born-and-bred rebel, this feisty cut of meat is weighed before it’s cooked and priced on menus per l’etto or 100g. Traditionally it is butchered from creamy Chianina cows, one of the oldest breeds of cattle, originating from the wide green Val de Chiana in eastern Tuscany. Tuscan markets conjure up animal parts many wouldn’t dream of eating. In the past, prime beef cuts were the domain of the wealthy and offal was the staple peasant fare: tripe was simmered for hours with onions, carrots and herbs to make lampredetto or with tomatoes and herbs to make trippa alla fiorentina – two classics still going strong. Pasto, an ancient mix of picchiante (cow’s lungs) and chopped potatoes, is not even a gastronomic curiosity these days – due to lack of demand it has died a quiet death and is no longer possible to find on restaurant menus. Equally ancient cibrèo (chicken’s kidney, liver, heart and cockscomb stew) and colle ripieno (stuffed chicken’s neck) are both still cooked up, though. Another golden oldie featured on many a medieval fresco is pollo al mattone – boned chicken splattered beneath a brick, rubbed with herbs and baked beneath the brick. The end result is handsomely crispy. Cinghiale (wild boar), hunted in autumn, is turned into salsicce di cinghiale (wild-boar sausages) or simmered with tomatoes, pepper and herbs to create a rich stew. The Tuscan Table Whether sinking your teeth into a beefy blue bistecca alla fiorentina (chargrilled T-bone steak), wine tasting in Chianti, savouring Livorno fish stew or devouring white truffles unearthed around San Miniato near Pisa, travelling in Tuscany is a memorable banquet of gastronomic and viticultural experiences.

Lardo di colonnata (thin slices of local pork fat aged in a mix of herbs and oils for at least six months) is a treat hard to find outside Tuscany. Best on Friday: Fish The old Medici port of Livorno leads the region in seafood: cacciucco (one ‘c’ for each type of fish thrown into it) is the signature dish. Deriving its name from the Turkish kukut, meaning ‘small fry’, cacciucco is a stew of five fish simmered with tomatoes and red peppers, served atop stale bread. Triglie alla livornese is red or white mullet cooked in tomatoes, and baccalà alla livornese, also with tomatoes, features cod traditionally salted aboard the ships en route to the port. Baccalà (salted cod), not to be confused with stoccofisso (unsalted air-dried stockfish), is a trattoria mainstay, served on Fridays as tradition and old-style Catholicism demands. Poor Man’s Meat: Pulses, Grains & Veg Pulses were poor man’s meat to Tuscans centuries ago. Jam-packed with protein, cheap and available year-round (eaten fresh in summer, dried in winter), pulses go into traditional dishes like minestra di fagioli (bean soup), minestra di pane (bread and bean soup) and ribollita (a ‘reboiled’ bean, vegetable and bread soup with black cabbage that is left to sit for a day before being served). Of the dozens of bean varieties, cannellini and dappled borlotti are the most common; both are delicious drizzled with olive oil to accompany Best Bistecca alla Fiorentina Trattoria Mario (Florence) Officina della Bistecca (Panzano In Chianti) Sergio Falaschi (San Miniato) Ristorante Da Muzzicone (Castiglion Fiorentino) Osteria Acquacheta (Montepulciano) Dopolavoro (La Foce) GO SLOW TUSCANY Born out of a desire to protect the world from McDonaldisation, Slow Food (www.fondazi oneslowfood.com) preserves local food traditions and encourages interest in the food we eat, its origins and how it tastes. Created by Italian wine writer Carlo Petrini, it works in over 130 countries and has also given rise to Slow City (www.cittaslow.blogspot.com). Slow City towns in Tuscany – Anghiari, Barga, Castelnuovo Berardenga, Civitella in Val di Chiana, Greve in Chianti, Massa Marittima, Pratovecchio, San Miniato, San Vincenzo and Suvereto – have a visible and distinct culture; rely on local resources rather than mass-produced food and culture; work to reduce pollution; and increasingly rely on sustainable development, such as organic farming and public transport. Industrialisation, globalisation and environmental dangers threaten traditional, indigenous edibles. Enter Slow Food’s Ark of Taste, a project born and headquartered in Florence that aims to protect and promote endangered food products, including, in Tuscany: Chianina beef, lardo di colonnata, Certaldo onions, Casola chestnut bread, Cetica red potatoes, Garfagnana potato bread and farro (spelt), Carmignano dried figs, cinta senese (the indigenous Tuscan pig), Londa Regina peaches, Pistoian Mountain pecorino cheese, Orbetello bottarga (salted mullet roe) and Zeri lamb. Among the many cured meats that make the list: San Miniato mallegato, Prato mortadella (smooth-textured pork sausage made dull pink with drops of alkermes liqueur and speckled white with cubes of fat), Sienese buristo (a type of pork salami made in the province of Siena), Valdarno tarese (a 50cm- to 80cm-long pancetta spiced with red garlic and orange peel and covered in pepper), Florentine bardiccio (fresh fennel-flavoured sausage encased in a natural skin of pig intestine and eaten immediately) and biroldo (spiced blood sausage made in Garfagnana from pig’s head and blood). Sampling any of these Tuscan items guarantees an authentic tasting experience. 304The Tuscan Table A Country Kitchen\n\nmeat. The round, yellow zolfino from Pratomagno and the silky-smooth sorano bean from Pescia are prized. Of huge local pride to farmers in the Garfagnana is farro della garfagnana (spelt), an ancient grain grown in Europe as early as 2500 BC. Tuscany’s lush vegetable patch sees medieval vegetables grow alongside tomatoes. Wild fennel, black celery (braised as a side dish), sweet red onions (delicious when oven baked), artichokes and zucchini flowers (stuffed and oven baked), black cabbage, broad beans, chicory, chard, thistle-like cardoons and green tomatoes are among the ones to look out for. Prized as one of the most expensive spices, saffron is all the rage around San Gimignano, where it was enthusiastically traded in medieval times. Fiery red and as fine as dust by the time it reaches the kitchen, saffron in its rawest state is the dried stigma of the saffron crocus. Pass the Salt: Bread One bite and the difference is striking: Tuscan pane (bread) is unsalted, creating a disconcertingly bland taste many a bread lover might never learn to enjoy. Yet it is this centuries-old staple – deliberately unsalted to ensure it lasted for a good week and to complement the region’s salty cured meats – that forms the backbone of Tuscany’s most famous dishes: pappa al pomodoro (bread and tomato soup), panzanella (tomato and basil salad mixed with a mush of bread soaked in cold water) and ribollita. None sound or look particularly appetising, but the depth of flavour is extraordinary. Thick-crusted pane toscana is the basis of two antipasti delights: crostini (lightly toasted slices of bread topped with liver pâté) and fettunta (a kind of Tuscan bruschetta that’s also called crogiantina; toast fingers doused in garlic, salt and olive oil). A Dowry Skill: Cheese So important was cheesemaking in the past that it was a dowry skill. Still respected, the sheep’s-milk pecorino crafted in Pienza ranks among Italy’s greatest pecorini: taste it young and mild with fava beans, fresh pear or chestnuts and honey, or try it mature and tangy, spiked with toscanello (black peppercorns) or as pecorino di tartufo (infused with black-truffle shavings). Pecorino massaged with olive oil during the ageing process turns red and is called rossellino. Festive Frolics: Sweets, Chocolate & Ice Be it the honey, almond and sugar-cane sweets served at the start of 14th-century banquets in Florence or the sugar sculptures made to impress at the flamboyant 16th- and 17th-century feasts of the Medici, dolci (sweets) have always been reserved for festive occasions. In more humble circles street vendors sold bomboloni (doughnuts) and pandiramerino (rosemary-bread buns), while Carnevale in Florence was marked by stiacchiata (Florentine flat bread made from eggs, flour, sugar and lard, then dusted with icing sugar). As early as the 13th century, servants at the Abbazia di Montecelso near Siena paid tax to the nuns in the form of panpepato (a pepper and honey flat bread), although legend tells a different tale: following a siege in Siena, Sister Berta baked a revitalising flat cake of honey, dried fruit, almonds and pepper to perk up the city’s weakened inhabitants. Subsequently sweetened with spices, sprinkled with sugar and feasted on once a year at Christmas, Siena’s panforte (literally ‘strong bread’) – a rich cake with nuts and candied fruit – is now eaten year-round. An adage says it stops couples quarrelling. Pasta is as much Tuscan as it is Italian, and no Tuscan banquet would be quite right without a primo (first course) of homemade maccheroni (wide, flat ribbon pasta), pappardelle (wider flat ribbon pasta) or Sienese pici (a thick, handrolled version of spaghetti) served with a duck, hare, rabbit or boar sauce. 305 The Tuscan Table A Country Kitchen\n\nTuscan biscotti (biscuits) – once served with candied fruit and sugared almonds at the start of and between courses at Renaissance banquets – are dry, crisp and often double baked. Cantucci are hard, sweet biscuits studded with almonds. Brighidini di lamporecchio are small, round aniseed-flavoured wafers; ricciarelli are almond biscuits, sometimes with candied orange; and lardpinocchiati are studded with pine kernels. In Lucca, locals are proud of their buccellato (a sweet bread loaf with sultanas and aniseed seeds), a treat given by godparents to their godchild on their first Holy Communion and eaten with alacrity at all other times. Unsurprisingly, it was at the Florentine court of Catherine de’ Medici that Italy’s most famous product, gelato, first appeared, thanks to court maestro Bernardo Buontalenti (1536–1608), who engineered a way of freezing sweetened milk and egg yolks. For centuries, ice cream and sherbets – a mix of shaved ice and fruit juice served between courses at Renaissance banquets to aid digestion – only appeared on wealthy tables. Celebrations Be it harvest, wedding, birth or religious holiday, traditional celebrations are intrinsically woven into Tuscan culinary culture. They are not as raucous as festivals of the past, when an animal was sacrificed, but most remain meaty affairs. Tuscans have baked breads and cakes, such as ring-shaped berlingozzo (Tuscan sweet bread) and schiacciata alla fiorentina (a flattish, spongy bread-cake best made with old-fashioned lard) for centuries during Carnevale, the period of merrymaking leading up to Ash Wednesday. Fritters are another sweet Carnevale treat: cenci are plain twists (literally ‘rags’) of fried, sweet dough sprinkled with icing sugar, castagnole look like puffed-up cushions, and fritelle di mele are slices of apple battered, deep fried and eaten warm with sugar. On Easter Sunday families take baskets of hard-boiled white eggs covered in a white-cloth napkin to church to be blessed, and return home DINING ETIQUETTE Dining out in Tuscany has its own set of unspoken rules – heed them to make your dining experience a whole lot smoother. Dress Smart-casual is best, particularly in Florence and other cities and large towns, where working urbanites go home to freshen up between aperitivo and dinner. Courses Don’t feel obliged to order the Tuscan full monty; it’s quite acceptable to order just one or two courses such as an antipasto (starter) and a primo (pasta course), or even just a secondo (main course). Bread This is plentiful, unsalted and served without butter – or a side plate (put it on the table). Spaghetti Twirl it around your fork as if you were born twirling – no spoons, please. Young children It is perfectly acceptable to ask for a plate of plain pasta with butter and Parmesan. Coffee Never order a cappuccino after 11am, and certainly not after a meal, when an espresso is the only respectable choice (with, perhaps, a digestif of grappa or another fiery spirit). Il conto (the bill) Whoever invites pays. Splitting the bill Common enough. Tipping If there is no servizio (service charge), leave a 10% to 15% tip. 306The Tuscan Table Celebr ations\n\nto a luncheon feast of roast lamb gently spiced with garlic and rosemary, preceded by the blessed eggs. September’s grape harvest sees grapes stuck on top of schiacciata to make schiacciata con l’uva (grape cake), and autumn’s chestnut harvest brings a flurry of chestnut festivals and the appearance of castagnaccio (chestnut cake baked with chestnut flower, studded with raisins, topped with a rosemary sprig and served with a slice of ricotta) on the Tuscan table. Come Christmas, bollito misto (boiled meat) with all the trimmings is traditional for many families: various animal parts, eg trotters, are thrown into the cooking pot and simmered for hours with a vegetable and herb stock. The meat is later served with mustard, green salsa and other sauces. A whole pig, notably the recently revived ancient whiteand-black cinta senese indigenous breed, roasted on a spit, is the other option. On the Wine Trail There’s far more to this vine-rich region than cheap, raffia-wrapped bottled Chianti – that was the 1970s, darling! Something of a viticulture powerhouse, Tuscany excites oenophiles with its myriad full-bodied, highly respected reds. Wine tasting is an endless pleasure and the region is peppered with enoteche (wine bars) and cantine (wine cellars) designed especially for tasting and buying. Many are planted on Tuscany’s strade del vino (wine roads): signposted itineraries that lead motorists and cyclists along wonderfully scenic back roads into the heart of Tuscan wine country. Tuscan white amounts to one label loved by Renaissance popes and artists alike: the aromatic Vernaccia di San Gimignano, best drunk as an aperitif on a terrace in or around San Gimignano. Brunello di Montalcino Brunello di Montalcino is one of Italy’s most prized wines: count on up to €15 for a glass, €30 to €100 for an average bottle and €5000 for a 1940s collectible. The product of Sangiovese grapes grown south of Siena, it must spend at least two years ageing in oak. It is intense and complex, with an ethereal fragrance, and it’s best paired with game, wild boar and roasts. Brunello grape rejects go into Rossi di Montalcino, Brunello’s substantially cheaper but wholly drinkable kid sister. Vino Nobile di Montepulciano Prugnolo Gentile grapes (a clone of Sangiovese) form the backbone of the distinguished Vino Nobile di Montepulciano (2006 was an exceptional year). Its intense but delicate nose and dry, vaguely tannic taste make it the perfect companion to red meat and mature cheese. OLIVE OIL Olive oil heads Tuscany’s culinary trinity (bread and wine are the other two members) and epitomises the earthy simplicity of Tuscan cuisine: dipping chunks of bread into pools of this liquid gold or biting into a slice of oil-doused fettunta (bruschetta) are sweet pleasures here. The Etruscans were the first to cultivate olive trees and press the fruit to make oil, a process refined by the Romans. As with wine, strict rules govern when and how olives are harvested (October to December), the varieties used, and so on. The best Tuscan oils wear a Chianti Classico DOP or Terre di Siena DOP label and an IGP certificate of quality issued by the region’s Consortium of Tuscan Olive Oil. In Florence look out for prize-winning oils from local producer Marchesi de’ Frescobaldi.

It was more famous than good in the 1970s, but contemporary Chianti gets the thumbs up from wine critics today. Produced in seven subzones from Sangiovese and a mix of other grape varieties, Chianti Classico – the traditional heart of this long-standing winegrowing area – is the best known, with a DOCG (Denominazione d’Origine Controllata e Garantita; Protected Designation of Origin and Quality) guarantee of quality and a Gallo Nero (Black Cockerel) emblem that once symbolised the medieval Chianti League. Young, fun Chianti Colli Senesi from the Siena hills is the largest subzone; Chianti delle Colline Pisane is light and soft in style; and Chianti Rùfina comes from the hills east of Florence. Super Tuscans One result of Chianti’s ‘cheap wine for the masses’ reputation in the 1970s was the realisation by some Tuscans – including the Antinoris, Tuscany’s most famous wine-producing family – that wines with a rich, complex, internationally acceptable taste following the New World tradition of blending mixes could be sold for a lot more than local wines. Thus, innovative, exciting wines were developed and cleverly marketed to appeal to buyers both in New York and in Florence. And when an English-speaking scribe dubbed the end product ‘Super Tuscans’, the name stuck. (Italian winemakers prefer the term IGT – indicazione geografica tipica.) Sassacaia, Solaia, Bolgheri, Tignanello and Luce are all super-hot Super Tuscans. More and more international wine producers are turning to Tuscan soil to blend Super Tuscans and other modern wines. American-owned Castello Banfi (http://castellobanfi.com), in the Tuscan biz for over three decades, is one of the most state-of-the-art wineries in Italy and continues to impress the international wine world with its pioneering work, quietly underscoring the demise of winemaking as the exclusive domain of old, blue-blooded Tuscan families. These days, in this ancient land first cultivated by the Etruscans, Tuscany’s oldest craft is open to anyone with wine-wizardry nous.

WINE CLASSIFICATIONS The quality and origin of Tuscan wine is flagged with these official classifications: DOC (Denominazione d’Origine Controllata; Protected Designation of Origin) Must be produced within a specified region using defined methods to meet a certain quality; the rules spell out production area, grape varietals and viticultural/bottling techniques. DOCG (Denominazione d’Origine Controllata e Garantita; Protected Designation of Origin and Quality) The most prestigious stamp of quality, DOCG wines are particularly good ones, produced in subterritories of DOC areas. Of Italy’s 44 DOCGs, eight are Tuscan – Brunello di Montalcino, Carmignano, Chianti, Chianti Classico, Morellino di Scansano, Vernaccia di San Gimignano, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and Elba Aleatico Passito.

Local Voices Prior to the 13th century, Italian literature was written in Latin. But all that changed with Florentine-born Dante Alighieri (c 1265–1321). One of the founders of the Dolce Stil Novo (Sweet New Style) literary movement, whose members wrote lyric poetry in the Tuscan vernacular, Dante went on to use the local language when writing the epic poem that was to become the first, and greatest, literary work published in the Italian language: La grande commedia (The Great Comedy), published around 1317 and later renamed La divina commedia (The Divine Comedy) by his fellow poet Boccaccio. Divided into three parts – Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso – The Divine Comedy delivered an allegorical vision of the afterlife that made an immediate and profound impression on readers and, through its wide-reaching popularity, established the Tuscan dialect as the new standardised form of written Italian. Another early adaptor to the new language of literature was Giovanni Boccaccio (1303–75), who hailed from Certaldo. His masterpiece, Decameron, was written in the years following the plague of 1348. A collection of 100 allegorical tales recounted by 10 characters, it delivered a vast panorama of personalities, events and symbolism to contemporary readers and was nearly as popular and influential as The Divine Comedy. The remaining member of the influential triumvirate that laid down the course for the development of a rich literature in Italian was Petrarch (Francesco Petrarca; 1304–74), born in Arezzo to Florentine parents. Although most of his writings were in Latin, he wrote his most popular works, the poems, in Italian. Il canzoniere (Songbook; c 1327–68) is the distilled result of his finest poetry. Although the core subject is his unrequited love for a woman named Laura, the breadth of human grief and joy is treated with a lyrical quality unseen until then. His influence spread far and across time: the Petrarchan sonnet form, rhyme scheme and even subject matter was adopted by English metaphysical poets of 17th-century England such as John Donne. Another outstanding writer of this period was Niccolò Machiavelli (1469–1527), known above all for his work on power and politics, Il Principe (The Prince; 1532). Tuscany on Page & Screen Few destinations have such a rich history and landscape to draw on for inspiration as Tuscany – or offer writers, actors and crews such a sybaritic location in which to research, write and shoot their works. The birthplace of Italian literature (courtesy of the great Dante Alighieri) and the setting for the greatest Italian film of recent decades (Life is Beautiful), Tuscany offers the visitor plenty of options when it comes to pre-departure reading and viewing.

The scene regained momentum in the 19th century with Giosuè Carducci (1835–1907), a Maremma-born writer who spent the second half of his life in Bologna. The best of his poetry, written in the 1870s, ranged in tone from a pensive evocation of death (such as in ‘Pianto antico’) or memories of youthful passion (‘Idillio Maremmano’) to a nostalgia harking back to the glories of ancient Rome. During the pre-WWI years Florence’s Aldo Palazzeschi (1885–1974) was in the vanguard of the Futurist movement. In 1911 he published arguably his best work, Il codice di Perelà (Perelà’s Code), a sometimes bitter allegory that in part becomes a farcical imitation of the life of Christ. Another Florentine, Vasco Pratolini (1913–91), set four highly regarded neo-realist novels in his birthplace: Le ragazze di San Frediano (The Girls of San Frediano; 1949), Cronaca familiare (Family Diary; 1947), Cronache di poveri amanti (Chronicle of Poor Lovers; 1947) and Metello (1955). Fiesole-born Dacia Maraini (b 1936), for many years the partner of author Alberto Moravia, is one of Italy’s most lauded contemporary writers, with novels, plays and poetry to her credit. Her best-known works include Buio (1999), which won the Premio Strega, Italy’s most prestigious literary award, and La lunga vita di Marianna Ucrìa (published in English as The Silent Duchess; 1990). Her most recent novel is La bambina e il sognatore (2015). Through Foreign Eyes The trend of setting English-language novels in Tuscany kicked off during the era of the Grand Tour, when wealthy young men from Britain and northern Europe travelled around Europe to view the cultural legacies of antiquity and the Renaissance, completing their liberal educations and being introduced to polite society in the process. The Grand Tour’s heyday was from the mid-17th century to the mid-19th century. With the advent of rail travel in the 1840s, the prospect of a cultural odyssey opened to the middle classes. Wealthy travellers from Britain, Americans Abroad Italian Hours (Henry James; 1909) The Stones of Florence (Mary McCarthy; 1956) The City of Florence (RWB Lewis; 1995) TUSCAN MEMOIRS Many people visit Tuscany and dream of purchasing their own piece of paradise. The following writers did just that, some establishing wildly successful literary franchises in the process. Kinta Beevor (A Tuscan Childhood; 1993) Beautiful evocation of life in the Tuscan countryside between the two world wars, by the daughter of an English painter who bought a castle in Tuscany and hobnobbed with the likes of DH Lawrence, Aldous Huxley et al. Eric Newby (A Small Place in Italy; 1994) The original Tuscan memoir; Newby bought a farmhouse in northeastern Tuscany in the 1960s and so came to pen this sensitive portrait of rural Tuscany, its people, seasons and ancient rituals. Frances Mayes (Under the Tuscan Sun: At Home in Italy; Bella Tuscany; In Tuscany; Every Day in Tuscany; 1996–2010) Following the end of her marriage, American writer and poet (and subsequent Tuscan bard) bought a dilapidated house in Cortona, did it up and wrote about it in Under the Tuscan Sun – a classic today. Ferenc Máté (The Hills of Tuscany; A Vineyard in Tuscany: A Wine-Lover’s Dream; The Wisdom of Tuscany; 1999–2009) The author and his wife, a painter, left New York for Tuscany’s Montalcino vineyards in 1990 – the abandoned farm they bought anchors a wine-producing estate today. Mark Gordon Smith (Tuscan Echoes; Tuscan Light: Memories of Italy; 2003–2007) It’s the tiny details of nature, season and cuisine that stand out in the short-story prose of this English writer who spent his early childhood in Tuscany. 311 Tuscany on Page & Screen Tuscany in Print\n\nAmerica and Australasia flocked to Italy, and some wrote about their experiences. Notable among these were Henry James, who set parts of The Portrait of a Lady (1881) and Roderick Hudson (1875) here; George Eliot, whose Romola (1862) was set in 15th-century Florence; and EM Forster, who set A Room with a View (1908) in Florence and Where Angels Fear to Tread (1905) in San Gimignano (fictionalised as Monteriano). Things slowed down in the early 20th century, with only a few major novelists choosing to set their work here. These included Somerset Maugham (Up at the Villa; 1941) and Aldous Huxley (Time Must Have a Stop; 1944). In recent decades, a number of highly regarded novels have been set in Tuscany. Perhaps the best known of these is the Renaissance fiction by English writer Linda Proud, whose Botticelli trilogy – A Tabernacle for the Sun, Pallas and the Centaur and The Rebirth of Venus – is set in Renaissance Florence during the Pazzi conspiracy, the Medici exile and the rise of Savonarola. The historical detail in all three is exemplary, and each is a cracking good read. Her novel about Botticelli’s master Fra’ Filippo Lippi, A Gift for the Magus, was published in 2012. Other writers who have used Renaissance Florence as a setting include Sarah Dunant (The Birth of Venus; 2003), Salman Rushdie (The Enchantress of Florence; 2008), Michaela-Marie Roessner-Hermann (The Stars Dispose; 1997, and The Stars Dispel; 1999) and Jack Dann (The Memory Cathedral; 1995). Of these, Dann wins the prize for constructing the most bizarre plot, setting his novel in a version of the Renaissance in which Leonardo da Vinci actually constructs a number of his inventions (eg the flying machine) and uses them during a battle in the Middle East while in the service of a Syrian general. Also set in Florence are Innocence (1986), written by Booker Prize– winning novelist Penelope Fitzgerald and set during the 1950s; The Sixteen Pleasures (1994) by Robert Hellenga, set after the devastating flood of 1966; The English Patient (1992) by Michael Ondaatje; and Inferno (2013) by Dan Brown (author of The Da Vinci Code). Tuscany on Film Cinema heavyweight Franco Zeffirelli was born in Florence in 1923 and has set many of his films in the region. His career has taken him from radio and theatre to opera (both stage productions and film versions) and his films include Romeo and Juliet (1968), Brother Sun, Sister Moon (1972), Hamlet (1990) and the semiautobiographical Tea with Mussolini (1999). Watch snippets of the latter as part of an engaging cinematic montage of films set in Florence at the city’s Museo Novecento. Actor, comedian and director Roberto Benigni was born near Castiglion Fiorentino in 1952. He picked up four Oscars and created a genre all of his own – Holocaust comedy – with the extraordinarily powerful La vita é bella (Life Is Beautiful; 1998), a film shot in the east Tuscan town of Arezzo that he directed, co-wrote and starred in. Often compared with Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, he has directed nine films (two set in Tuscany) and acted in many more, including three directed by American independent film-maker Jim Jarmusch. Four films based on neo-realist novels by Vasco Pratolini were shot in Florence: Le ragazze di San Frediano (The Girls of San Frediano; Valerio Zurlini; 1954), Cronache di poveri amanti (Chronicle of Poor Lovers; Carlo Lizzani; 1954), Cronaca familiare (Family Diary; Valerio Zurlini; 1962) and Metello (Mauro Bolognini; 1970). Award-winning film-makers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani were born in San Miniato and have set parts of three of their films in Tuscany: La notte di San Lorenzo (The Night of the Shooting Stars; 1982), Le affinità elettive (Elective Affinities; 1996) and Good Morning Babylon (1987).

From the 8th to the 3rd centuries BC, Etruscans held their own against friends, Romans and countrymen, worshipped their own gods and goddesses, and farmed lowlands using sophisticated drainage systems of their own invention. How well they lived between sieges and war is unclear, but they sure knew how to throw a funeral. Etruscan necropoli (tombs) are found throughout southern, central and eastern Tuscany. Excavation of these tombs often yields a wealth of jewellery, cinerary urns (used for body ashes) made from terracotta and alabaster, earthenware pottery (particularly the glossy black ceramic known as bucchero) and bronze votive offerings. Of course, the Romans knew a good thing when they plundered it. After conquering swaths of Etruscan territory in Tuscany in the 3rd century BC, they incorporated the Etruscans’ highly refined, geometric style into their own art and architecture. Enter Christianity Roman centurions weren’t in the area for long before Christianity began to take hold. After abandoning his studies and a promising career in Rome to adopt the contemplative life around AD 500, a young local man named Benedict went on to achieve a number of miracles, personally establish 12 monasteries and inspire the founding of many more. His story is visually narrated in great detail in the stunning fresco series (1497–1505) by Il Sodoma and Luca Signorelli in the Great Cloister at Abbazia di Monte Oliveto Maggiore, near Siena. One early Benedictine monastery, San Pietro in Valle, was built in neighbouring Umbria by order of the Lombard duke of Spoleto, Faroaldo II. It kick-started a craze for the blend of Lombard and Roman styles known as Romanesque, and local ecclesiastical structures were built in this style. The basic template was simple: a stark nave stripped of extra columns ending in a domed apse, surrounded by chapels usually donated by wealthy patrons. In the 11th century the Romanesque style acquired a distinctly Tuscan twist in Pisa, when the coloured marble banding and veneering of the city’s duomo (cathedral) set a new gold standard for architectural decoration. This new style (sometimes described as Pisan) was then applied to a swath of churches throughout the region, including the Chiesa di San Miniato al Monte in Florence, and the Chiesa di San Michele in Foro and the Cattedrale di San Martino, both in Lucca. Art & Architecture In many respects, the history of Tuscan art is also the history of Western art. Browse through any text on the subject and you’ll quickly develop an understanding of how influential the Italian Renaissance, which kicked off and reached its greatest flowering in Florence, has been over the past 500 years. Indeed, it’s no exaggeration to say that architecture, painting and sculpture rely on its technical innovations and take inspiration from its major works to this very day.

They certainly got their money’s worth, ending up with a spectacular Gothic facade by Giovanni Pisano, a pulpit by Nicola Pisano and a rose window by Duccio di Buoninsegna. While Tuscany’s churches were becoming increasingly more spectacular, nothing prepared pilgrims for what they would find inside the upper and lower churches of the Basilica di San Francesco in Assisi, Umbria. Not long after St Francis’ death in 1226, an all-star team of Tuscan artists was hired to decorate these churches in his honour, kicking off a craze for frescoes that wouldn’t abate for centuries. Cimabue, Giotto, Pietro Lorenzetti and Simone Martini captured the life and gentle spirit of St Francis while his memory was still fresh in the minds of the faithful. For medieval pilgrims unaccustomed to multiplexes and special effects, entering a space that had been covered from floor to ceiling with stories told in living colour must have been a dazzling, overwhelming experience. The Middle Ages: the Rise of the Comune While communities sprang up around hermits and holy men in the hinterlands, cities began to take on a life of their own from the 13th and 14th centuries. Roman road networks had been serving as handy trade routes starting in the 11th century, and farming estates and villas began to spring up outside major trading centres as a new middle class of merchants, farmers and skilled craftspeople emerged. Taxes and donations sponsored the building of hospitals such as Ospedale Santa Maria della Scala in Siena. Streets were paved, town walls erected and sewerage systems built to accommodate an increasingly sophisticated urban population not keen on sprawl or squalor. Once townsfolk came into a bit of money, they weren’t necessarily eager to part with it, and didn’t always agree on how their tax dollars should be spent. Comuni (local governments) were formed to represent the various interests of merchants, guilds and competing noble families, and the first order of business in major medieval cities, such as Siena, Florence and Volterra, was the construction of an impressive town hall to reflect the importance and authority of the comune. In addition to being savvy political lobbyists and fans of grand architectural projects that kept their constituents gainfully employed, medieval comuni were masters of propaganda, and perfectly understood the influence that art and architecture could wield. A case in point is Ambrogio Lorenzetti’s Allegories of Good and Bad Government fresco series in Siena’s Palazzo Comunale, which is better and bigger than any political billboard could ever be. In the Allegory of Good Government, Lorenzetti’s grey-bearded figure of Legitimate Authority is surrounded by an entourage that would certainly put White House interns to shame: Peace, Fortitude, Prudence, Magnanimity, Temperance and Justice. Above them flit Faith, Hope and Charity, and to the left Concord sits confidently on her throne while the reins of justice are held taut overhead. Next to this fresco is another depicting the effects of good government: townsfolk make their way through town in an orderly fashion, pausing to do business, greet one another and dance a merry jig. But things couldn’t be more different in the Allegory of Bad Government, where horned and fanged Tyrannia rules over a scene of chaos surrounded by winged vices, and Justice lies unconscious, her scales shattered. Like the best campaign speeches, this cautionary tale was brilliantly rendered but not always heeded. On the World Stage When they weren’t busy politicking, late-medieval farmers, craftspeople and merchants did quite well for themselves. Elegant, locally made ceramics, tiles and marbles were showcased in churches across Tuscany and became all the rage throughout Europe and the Mediterranean when Best Gothic Churches Duomo (Siena) Abbazia di San Galgano (south of Siena) Chiesa di Santa Maria della Spina (Pisa) As madness and profligacy often run in families, so too does artistic genius. Italian artistic dynasties include the della Robbias (Luca, Marco, Andrea, Giovanni and Girolamo), the Lorenzettis (Ambrogio and Pietro) and the Pisanos (Nicola and Giovanni, Andrea and Nino). 314Art & Architecture The Mid dl e Ages: the Rise of the Comune\n\npilgrims returned home to England and France with examples after following the Via Francigena pilgrimage route from Canterbury to Rome. Artisans were kept busy applying their skills to civic-works projects and churches, which had to be expanded and updated to keep up with the growing numbers and rising expectations of pilgrims in the area. With outside interest came outside influence, and local styles adapted to international markets. Florence became famous for lustrous, tinglazed maiolica (majolica ware) tiles and plates painted with vibrant metallic pigments that were inspired by the Islamic ceramics of Mallorca (Spain). The prolific della Robbia family started to create richly glazed ceramic reliefs that are now enshrined at the Museo del Bargello in Florence and in churches and museums across the region. Modest Romanesque cathedrals were given an International Gothic makeover befitting their appeal to pilgrims of all nations, but the Italian take on the French style was more colourful than the grey-stone spires and flying buttresses of Paris. The local version often featured a simple layout and striped stone naves fronted by multilayer birthday-cake facades, which might be frosted with pink paint, glittering mosaics and rows of arches capped with sculptures. The most famous example of this confectionery approach is the duomo in Siena. The evolution from solid Romanesque to airy Gothic to a yin-and-yang balance of the two can be witnessed in buildings throughout the region, many of which blend a relatively austere Romanesque exterior with high Gothic drama indoors. This set a new ecclesiastical architecture standard that was quickly exported into Italy at large and on to the rest of Europe. Dark Times By the 14th century the smiling Sienese townsfolk of Ambrogio Lorenzetti’s Allegory of Good Government must have seemed like the figment of a fertile imagination. After a major famine in 1329 and then a bank collapse, Siena’s comune went into debt to maintain roads, continue work on the duomo, help the needy and jump-start the local economy. But just when the city seemed set for a comeback, the plague brought devastation in 1348. Three-quarters of Siena’s population – including Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti – died, and virtually all economic and artistic activity ground to a halt. Another plague hit in 1374, killing 80,000 Sienese, and was swiftly followed by a famine. It was too much – the city never entirely recovered. Florence was also hit by the plague in 1348, and despite fervent public prayer rituals, 96,000 Florentines died in just seven months.

Boccaccio wasn’t the only prominent critic of the time to consider Giotto extraordinary – Giorgio Vasari was also a huge fan, arguing that Giotto initiated the ‘rebirth’ (rinascità or renaissance) in art. In his paintings, Giotto abandoned popular conventions such as the three-quarter view of head and body, and presented his figures from behind, from the side or turning around, just as the story demanded. Giotto had no need for lashings of gold paint and elaborate ornamentation to impress the viewer with the significance of the subject. Instead, he enabled the viewer to feel the dramatic tension of a scene through a naturalistic rendition of figures and a radical composition that created the illusion of depth. Giotto’s important works in Tuscany include an altarpiece portraying the Madonna and Child among angels and saints in Florence’s Galleria degli Uffizi, a painted wooden crucifix in the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella and frescoes in the Basilica di Santa Croce. His magnificent Life of St Francis fresco cycle graces the walls of the upper church of the Basilica di San Francesco in Assisi, Umbria. 315 Art & Architecture Dark T ime s\n\nsurvived experienced a crisis of faith, making Florence fertile territory for humanist ideals – not to mention macabre superstition, attempts to raise the dead, and a fascination with corpses that the likes of Leonardo da Vinci would call science and others morbid curiosity. At the plague’s end, a Florentine building boom ensued when upstart merchants such as Cosimo I de’ Medici (Cosimo the Elder) and Palla Strozzi competed to put their stamp on a city that needed to be reimagined after the horrors it had undergone. The Renaissance It wasn’t only merchants who were jockeying for power at this time. To put an end to the competing claims of the Tuscan Ghibelline faction that was allied with the Holy Roman Empire, the Rome-backed Guelph faction had marked its territory with impressive new landmarks, predominantly in Florence. Giotto – often described as the founding artist of the Renaissance – had been commissioned to design the city’s iconic 85m-tall square campanile (bell tower) and one-up the 57m-tall tower under construction in Ghibelline Pisa that was already looking a bit off kilter. And this was only one of many such projects. ‘Mess with Florence, and you take on Rome’ was the not-so-subtle hint delivered by Florentine architects, who made frequent reference to the glories of the ancient power and its classical architecture when designing the new churches, palazzi and public buildings that started sprouting across the city during the Trecento (14th century) and proliferated in the Quattrocentro (15th century). This new Florentine style became known as Renaissance or ‘rebirth’, and it really started to hit its stride after architect Filippo Brunelleschi won a competition to design the dome of Florence’s duomo. Brunelleschi was heavily influenced by the achievements of the classical masters, but he was able to do something that they hadn’t FILIPPO BRUNELLESCHI Many Renaissance men left their mark on Florence, but few did so with as much grace and glory as Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446). An architect, mathematician, engineer and sculptor, Brunelleschi trained as a master goldsmith and showed early promise as a sculptor – he was an entrant in the 1401 competition to design the doors of the baptistry in Florence (won by fellow goldsmith Lorenzo Ghiberti) and shortly after travelled to Rome with Donatello, another goldsmith by training, to study that city’s ancient architecture and art. When he returned to Florence in 1419 he took up an architectural commission from the silk merchant’s guild to design a hospital for foundlings on Piazza della Santissima Annunziata in San Marco. Known as the Ospedale degli Innocenti (Hospital of the Innocents – today a stunning museum), his classically proportioned and detailed building featured a distinctive nine-arched loggia and was a radical departure from the High Gothic style that many of his artistic contemporaries were still embracing. Its design was sober, secular and sophisticated, epitomising the new humanist age. In 1419, after completing his work on the foundling hospital, Brunelleschi moved on to a commission that was to occupy him for the next 42 years – the dome of Florence’s duomo. His mathematical brain and talent for devising innovative engineering solutions enabled him to do what many Florentines had thought impossible: deliver the largest dome to be built in Italy since antiquity. Brunelleschi’s other works in Florence include the Basilica di San Lorenzo, the Basilica di Santo Spirito and the Cappella de’ Pazzi in the Basilica di Santa Croce. Vasari said of him: ‘The world having for so long been without artists of lofty soul or inspired talent, heaven ordained that it should receive from the hand of Filippo the greatest, the tallest, and the finest edifice of ancient and modern times, demonstrating that Tuscan genius, although moribund, was not yet dead’. He is buried in the duomo, under the dome that was his finest achievement. Masaccio’s Trinity, a wall painting in the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella in Florence, is often described as one of the founding works of Renaissance painting and the inspiration for Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper fresco. 316Art & Architecture The Renais sance\n\nbeen able to do themselves – discover and record the mathematical rules by which objects appear to diminish as they recede from us. In so doing, he gave local artists and architects a whole new visual perspective and a means to glorious artistic ends. To decorate the new buildings, artists enjoyed a bonanza of commissions to paint heroic battle scenes, fresco private chapels and carve busts of the latest power players – works that sometimes outlived their patrons’ clout. A good example is the Peruzzi family, whose members had risen to prominence in 14th-century Florence as bankers, with interests reaching from London to the Middle East. They set the trend for art patronage by commissioning Giotto to fresco the family’s memorial chapel in Santa Croce, completed in 1320. When Peruzzi client King Edward III of England defaulted on loans the family went bankrupt – but, as patrons of Giotto’s precocious experiments in perspective and Renaissance illusionism, their legacy set the tone for the artistic flowering of Florence. One Florentine family to follow the Peruzzis’ lead was the prominent Brancacci, who commissioned Masolino da Panicale and his precocious assistant Masaccio to decorate a chapel in the Basilica di Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence. After Masaccio’s premature death aged only 27, the frescoes were completed by Filippino Lippi. In these dramatic frescoes, framed in astonishingly convincing architectural sets, scenes from the life of St Peter allude to pressing Florentine concerns of the day: the new income tax, unfair imprisonment and hoarded wealth. Masaccio’s image of the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden proved especially prophetic: the Brancacci were allied with the Strozzi family, and were exiled from Florence by the Medici before they could see the work completed. But the patrons with the greatest impact on the course of art history were, of course, the Medicis. Patriarch Cosimo the Elder was exiled in 1433 by a consortium of Florentine families who considered him a triple threat: powerful banker, ambassador of the Church, and consummate politician with the savvy to sway emperors and popes. But the flight of capital from Florence after his departure created such a fiscal panic that the banishment was hastily rescinded and within a year the Medicis were well and truly back in town. To announce his return in grand style, Cosimo funded the 1437 rebuilding of the Convento di San Marco (now Museo di San Marco) by Michelozzo, and commissioned Fra’ Angelico to fresco the monks’ quarters with scenes from the life of Christ. Another artist pleased to see Cosimo return was Donatello, who had completed his lithe bronze statue of David (now in the city’s Museo del Bargello) with his patronage. Through such commissions, early Renaissance innovations in perspective, closely observed realism and chiaroscuro (the play of light and dark) began to catch on throughout the region. In Sansepolcro, a painter named Piero della Francesca earned a reputation for figures who were glowing with otherworldly light, and who were caught in personal predicaments that people could relate to: Roman soldiers snoozing on the job, crowds left goggle-eyed by miracles and bystanders distressed to witness cruel persecution. His fresco series Legend of the True Cross, commissioned by the Bacci family for a chapel in Arezzo’s Chiesa di San Francesco, was one of the supreme artistic achievements of the time. The High Renaissance The decades leading up to and beginning the Cinquecento (16th century) are often seen as a kind of university faculty meeting, with genteel, silver-haired sages engaged in a collegial exchange of ideas. A bar brawl might be closer to the metaphorical truth, with artists, scientists, politicians and clergy mixing it up and everyone emerging bruised. The debate was never as simple as Church versus state, science versus art or seeing versus believing; in those days, politicians could be clergy, scientists could be artists, and artists could be clergy. As well as endowing churches, building palaces and funding frescoes, the wealthy merchant families of the Renaissance commissioned plenty of portraits. Cosimo I de’ Medici’s favourite portrait painter was Agnolo di Cosimo (1503–72), called Bronzino because of his dark complexion. Look for his Medici portraits in the Uffizi, Florence. Filippo Lippi (1406–69) entered the Carmelite order as a monk aged 14, but he renounced his vows after eloping with a novice who was sitting for the figure of the Madonna in a fresco he was painting for Prato’s duomo. Their son Filippino (1457–1504) became a notable painter too. 317 Art & Architecture The High Renais sance\n\nThere were many artistic superstars during this period, and most were locals who ended up honing their skills in Florence and then moving elsewhere in Italy. Their careers were well documented by Giorgio Vasari in his gossipy Lives of the Artists. Inspired by Masaccio, tutored by Fra’ Filippo Lippi and backed by Lorenzo de’ Medici, Sandro Botticelli was a rising Florentine art star who was sent to Rome to paint a fresco celebrating papal authority in the Sistine Chapel. The golden boy who’d painted the Birth of Venus for Lorenzo de’ Medici’s private villa in 1485 (now in Florence’s Galleria degli Uffizi) could do no wrong until he was accused of sodomy in 1501. The charges didn’t stick, but the rumours did, and Botticelli’s work was critiqued as too decadently sensual for religious subjects. When religious reformer Savonarola ousted the Medici and began to purge Florence of decadent excess in the face of surely imminent Armageddon, Botticelli paintings went up in flames in the massive ‘Bonfire of the Vanities’. Botticelli repudiated mythology and turned his attention to Madonnas, some of whom bear a marked family resemblance to his Venus. Michelangelo, a Tuscan village lad from Caprese (today Caprese Michelangelo) in the remote Tuscan outback of Casentino in eastern Tuscany, was another of Lorenzo de’ Medici’s protégés. His classically inspired work was RENAISSANCE FRESCOES They may look like ordinary bible stories now, but in their heyday Renaissance frescoes provided running social commentary as well as religious inspiration. In them, human adversity looked divine, and vice versa. Fantastic examples are found throughout Tuscany, but to see the very best head to the following churches and museums: Collegiata, San Gimignano (p155) There are hardly any undecorated surfaces in this cathedral, with every wall sporting huge, comic-strip-like frescoes by Bartolo di Fredi, Lippo Memmi, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Benozzo Gozzoli. The highlight is Taddeo di Bartolo’s gleefully grotesque Final Judgment (1396). Libreria Piccolomini, Duomo, Siena (p130) Umbrian artist Bernardino Pinturicchio extols the glory of Siena in 10 vibrant fresco panels (c 1502–1507) celebrating Enea Silvio Piccolomini, aka the humanist Pope Pius II. St Catherine of Siena makes a cameo appearance. Museo di San Marco, Florence (p88) Fra’ Angelico’s frescoes portray religious figures in all-too-human moments of uncertainty, reflecting the humanist spirit of the Renaissance. The highlight is his Annunciation (c 1440). Museo Civico, Siena (p132) Magnificent is the only word to use when describing Ambrogio Lorenzetti’s Allegories of Good and Bad Government (1338–40) and Simone Martini’s Maestà (Virgin Mary in Majesty; 1315). Cappella Brancacci, Florence (p97) Masaccio’s The Expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise and The Tribute Money (c 1427) showcase architectural perspective and sly political satire. Cappella Bacci, Chiesa di San Francesco, Arezzo (p265) Piero della Francesca’s Legend of the True Cross (c 1452–66) displays a veritable encyclopaedia of Renaissance painting tricks (directional lighting, steep perspective etc). Chiesa di Sant’Agostino, San Gimignano (p157) Benozzo Gozzoli’s bizarre fresco of San Sebastian (c 1464) shows the fully clothed saint protecting the citizens of San Gimignano, helped by a bare-breasted Virgin Mary and a semi-robed Jesus. Wins the prize for the weirdest religious iconography. Cappella dei Magi, Palazzo Medici-Riccardi, Florence (p87) More Gozzoli, but this time there’s nothing strange about his subject matter, which has members of the Medici family making a guest appearance in the Procession of the Magi to Bethlehem (c 1459–63). To understand just how much of his life, passion and soul Michelangelo gave to sculpture – and the city of Florence – read Irving Stone’s gripping biographical novel The Agony and the Ecstasy (1961). 320Art & Architecture The High Renais sance\n\nuniformly admired until the Medicis were ousted by Savonarola in 1494. By some accounts, Savonarola tossed rare early paintings by Michelangelo onto his bonfires. Without his Medici protectors, Michelangelo seemed unsure of his next move: he briefly hid in the basement of San Lorenzo and then roamed around Italy. In Rome he carved a Bacchus for Cardinal Raffaele Riaro that the patron deemed unsuitable – but this only seemed to spur Michelangelo on to make a bigger and still more sensuous statue of David in 1501. It’s now exhibited in Florence’s Galleria dell’Accademia. Leonardo, who hailed from Vinci, southwest of Florence, had so many talents that it is hard to isolate only a few for comment. In his painting, he took what some critics have described as the decisive step in the history of Western art – namely, abandoning the balance that had previously been maintained between colour and line and choosing to modulate his contours using shading. This technique is called sfumato and it is perfectly displayed in his Mona Lisa (now in the Louvre in Paris). Few of his works remain in his birthplace; the exceptions are his Adoration of the Magi and Annunciation, both in the Uffizi. In 1542 the Inquisition arrived in Italy, marking a definitive end to the Renaissance exploration of humanity in all its glorious imperfections. Tuscan art and architecture would never again lead the world by example. A Stop on the Grand Tour A ‘Grand Tour’ of Italy became an obligatory display of culture and class status by the 18th century, and Tuscany was a key stop on the itinerary. German and English artists enraptured with Michelangelo, Perugino and other early High Renaissance painters took the inspiration home, kick-starting a neoclassicist craze. Conversely, trends from northern Europe (Impressionism, plein-air painting and Romanticism) became trendy among Italian artists, as witnessed in the collection at Florence’s Galleria d’Arte Moderna in the Palazzo Pitti, which is dominated by late-19th-century works by artists of the Tuscan Macchiaioli school (the local equivalent of Impressionism). These include Telemaco Signorini (1835–1901) and Giovanni Fattori (1825–1908). In architecture, the most fascinating case of artistic import–export is Italian art nouveau, often referred to as Liberty after the London store that put William Morris’ Italian-inspired visual ideals into commercial action. GIORGIO VASARI’S ‘LIVES OF THE ARTISTS’ Painter, architect and writer Giorgio Vasari (1511–74) is rightly described as a ‘Renaissance man’. Born in Arezzo, he gew up in what is now the small but fascinating house museum Museo di Casa Vasari. He later trained as a painter in Florence, working with artists such as Andrea del Sarto and Michelangelo (he idolised the latter). As a painter, he is best remembered for his floor-to-ceiling frescoes in the Salone dei Cinquecento in Florence’s Palazzo Vecchio. As an architect, his most accomplished work was the elegant loggia of the Galleria degli Uffizi (he also designed the enclosed, elevated corridor that connected the Palazzo Vecchio with the Uffizi and Palazzo Pitti and was dubbed the ‘Corridoio Vasariano’ in his honour). But posterity remembers him predominantly for his work as an art historian. His Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects, from Cimabue to Our Time, an encyclopaedia of artistic biographies published in 1550 and dedicated to Cosimo I de’ Medici, is still in print (as The Lives of the Artists) and is full of wonderful anecdotes and gossip about his artistic contemporaries in 16th-century Florence. Memorable passages include his recollection of visiting Donatello’s studio one day to find the great sculptor staring at his extremely lifelike statue of the Prophet Habakkuk and imploring it to talk (we can only assume that Donatello had been working too hard). Vasari also writes about a young Giotto painting a fly on the surface of a work by Cimabue that the older master then tried to brush away. The term ‘Macchiaioli’ (the name given to a 19th-century group of Tuscan plein-air artists) was coined by a journalist in 1862. It mockingly implied that the artists’ finished works were no more than sketches, and was drawn from the phrase ‘darsi alla macchia’ (to hide in bushes or scrubland). 321 Art & Architecture A Stop on the Grand Tour\n\nThe 20th Century After centuries under the thumbs of popes and sundry imperial powers, Tuscany had acquired a certain forced cosmopolitanism, and local artists could identify with Rome, Paris and other big cities in addition to their own contrada (neighbourhood). The two biggest stars in the early decades of this century were Livorno-born painter and sculptor Amedeo Modigliani (1884–1920), who lived most of his adult life in Paris, and Greek-born painter Giorgio de Chirico (1888–1978), who studied in Florence and painted the first of his ‘Metaphysical Town Square’ series there. Other than Modigliani and di Chirico, no Tuscan painters of note were represented within the major artistic movements of the century: Futurismo (Futurism), Pittura Metafisica (Metaphysical Painting), Spazialismo (Spatialism) and Arte Povera (conceptual art using materials of little worth). Architecture didn’t have many local stars either, with the only exception being Giovanni Michelucci (1891–1990), whose buildings include Santa Maria Novella Railway Station in Florence (1932–34). In the field of abstract art, installation art and sculpture, it was the small town of Pistoia that made itself heard in the 1950s and 1960s through a trio of artists. Pistoia-born Fernando Melani (1907–85) lived all his life in Pistoia, rarely exhibiting elsewhere. His playful works utilised an abundance of recycled materials, with thin metal wire being shaped and twisted in all directions to create the most extraordinary forms and models. His contemporary Mario Nigro (1917–1992) moved to Livorno when he was 12 and later, once the abstract-art bug bit, to the brighter lights of Milan. In the field of sculpture, Pistoia’s Marino Marini (1901–80) drew on Tuscany’s Etruscan heritage in his work, developing a strong equestrian theme – nudes and men on horseback are what Marini did best. In the 1980s there was a return to painting and sculpture in a traditional (primarily figurative) sense. Dubbed ‘Transavanguardia’, this movement broke with the prevailing international focus on conceptual art and was thought by some critics to signal the death of avant-garde. Tuscan artists who were part of this movement include Sandro Chia (b 1946). Contemporary Art A heritage of rich artistic traditions spanning three millennia means job security for legions of Tuscan art-conservation specialists and art historians, but can also have a stultifying effect on artists attempting to create something wholly new. Fortunately, there’s more going on than the daubs by pavement artists outside major museums and tourist attractions would indicate. One of the most notable visual artists working here is Massimo Bartolini (b 1962), who radically alters the local landscape with just a few deceptively simple (and quintessentially Tuscan) adjustments of light and perspective that fundamentally change our experience: a bedroom where all the furniture appears to be sinking into the floor, Venice style; or a gallery where the viewer wears special shoes that subtly change the gallery’s lighting with each step. Bartolini has also changed the local flora of the tiny Tuscan town of Cecina, near Livorno, where he lives and works, attracting colourful flocks of contemporary-art collectors and curators. The bijou town of Pietrasanta in the hinterland of the Versilian coast in northwestern Tuscany has a vibrant arts community and is home to the much-lauded Colombian-born sculptor Fernando Botero (b 1932). In the Val d’Orcia, Volterra’s homegrown sculptor Mauro Staccioli (b 1937) encourages visitors to admire the landscape from an alternative perspective with his series of monumental geometric installations scattered around town. Also notable is San Gimignano’s Galleria Continua, a world-class commercial gallery whose portfolio of artists includes Tuscans Giovanni Ozzola (b 1982) and Luca Pancrazzi (b 1961). In Prato, the contemporary-art flag is flown by the recently unveiled Centro per l’Arte Contemporanea Luigi Pecci.

Here’s our best attempt. Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564) The quintessential Renaissance man: a painter, sculptor and architect with more masterpieces to his credit than any other artist either before or since. In Florence, view his David in the Galleria dell’Accademia (p90) and his Tondo Doni (Holy Family) in the Uffizi (p68). Sandro Botticelli (c 1444–1510) His Renaissance beauties charmed com - missions out of the Medicis and continue to exert their siren call on the millions who visit the Uffizi Gallery (p68) each year. Don’t miss his Primavera and Birth of Venus . Giotto di Bondone (c 1266–1337) Giotto kick-started the Renaissance with action-packed frescoes in which each character pinpoints emotions with fa - cial expressions and poses that need no translation. Make the pilgrimage to Assisi (p284) to see his Life of St Francis fresco cycle. Fra’ Angelico (c 1395–1455) Few artists are saints – they’re far more likely to be sinners. One of the exceptions was Il Beato Angelico, who was canon - ised in 1982. His best-loved work is the Annunciation, versions of which are on display in Florence’s Museo di San Marco (p88) and Cortona’s Museo Diocesano (p282). Duccio di Buoninsegna (c 1255–1318) Head honcho of the Sienese school, he’s known for his riveting Madonnas with level gazes and pale-green skin against glowing gold backgrounds. His masterwork is the Maestà in the Museo dell’Opera (p131) in Siena. 319 VALERY VOENNYY/ALAMY © ODYSSEY-IMAGES/ALAMY ©\n\nTuscan Architecture Italy has more than its share of great buildings, and a large percentage of these are in Tuscany. Brunelleschi and Michelangelo both designed masterpieces here, and every town and city seems to have at least one notable Romanesque, Gothic or Renaissance structure. Churches Tuscany’s chiese (churches) are headline attractions where worship can take many forms. Every village, town and city has at least one church, and many are repositories of great art. Florence has masterpieces galore (don’t miss Santa Maria Novella, Santa Croce and San Lorenzo), but Siena, Pisa and San Gimignano are richly endowed, too, with their respective duomos (cathedrals) being the best-loved and most distinctive buildings in town. On the border of Tuscany and Umbria, Orvieto’s duomo is one of the most beautiful in the country. Baptistries Important cathedrals often have a detached battistero (baptistry) with a dedicated altar and font. Pisa’s cupcakeshaped example in the Piazza dei Miracoli, with its exquisite hexagonal marble pulpit carved by Nicola Pisano, is wonderful, as is Florence’s Romanesque version with its famous door panels sculpted by Lorenzo Ghiberti. Hospitals Funded by the church, the comune (municipality) or wealthy philanthropists, ospedali (hospitals) have historically been among the largest and grandest of civic buildings. Siena’s Santa Maria della Scala 322 Tuscan Architecture322 ©Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd\n\nis perhaps the best known, but architecture buffs adore Brunelleschi’s Ospedale degli Innocenti in Florence. Palaces The Medicis weren’t the only dynasty with a penchant for building palazzi (palaces). In the medieval and Renaissance periods, wealthy families in every city built houses aimed to impress, as did ambassadors, popes, cardinals and podestàs (chief magistrates). Architecturally notable examples include Palazzo Strozzi, Palazzo Pitti and Palazzo Medici-Riccardi in Florence; Palazzo Piccolomini, Palazzo Salimbeni and Palazzo Chigi-Saracini in Siena; and Palazzo Piccolomini in Pienza. Piazzas These triumphs of town planning are the lifeblood of every Tuscan community, the places where locals come to connect with their neighbours and where important institutions such as churches and town halls are almost inevitably situated. The two most famous examples, Piazzo Pio II in Pienza and Piazza dei Miracoli in Pisa, feature in Unesco’s World Heritage List. Worthy of an honourable mention are Livorno’s Piazza dei Domenicani, Arezzo’s Piazza Grande and Massa Marittima’s Piazza Garibaldi. Town Halls Built to showcase wealth and civic pride, the palazzo comunale (municipal palace) is often the most impressive secular building in a Tuscan town. Noteworthy examples include those on Siena’s Piazza del Campo, Volterra’s Piazza dei Priori and Florence’s Piazza della Signoria. 323 CATARINA BELOVA/SHUTTERSTOCK © PHOTOTRIPPINGAMERICA/SHUTTERSTOCK © 1.

VACCINATIONS No jabs are required to travel to Italy. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all travellers should be covered for diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella and polio, as well as hepatitis B. EATING PRICE RANGES The following price ranges refer to a meal consisting of two courses and a bicchiere di vino della casa (glass of house wine), and include a coperto (cover charge): € less than €25 €€ €25–45 €€€ more than €45\n\nDirectory A–Z Insur ance 328 In Florence & Tuscany AVAILABILITY & COST OF HEALTH CARE Pharmacists can give you valuable advice and sell overthe-counter medication for minor illnesses. They can also advise you when more specialised help is required and point you in the right direction. Pharmacies generally keep the same hours as other shops, closing at night and on Sundays. However, in big cities a handful remain open on a rotation basis (farmacie di turno) for emergency purposes. These are listed online at www.miniportale.it/mini portale/farmacie/Toscana. htm. You can also check the door of any pharmacy that is closed for business – it will display a list of the nearest emergency pharmacies. If you need an ambulance, call 118. For emergency treatment, head straight to the pronto soccorso (casualty) section of a public hospital, where you can also get emergency dental treatment. TAP WATER Despite the Tuscan enthusiasm for consuming bottled mineral water with meals, tap water in the region is perfectly drinkable. Insurance A travel insurance policy to cover theft, loss and medical problems is a good idea. Some policies specifically exclude dangerous activities, which can include scuba diving, motorcycling and even hiking – read the fine print. Worldwide travel insurance is available at www. lonelyplanet.com/travelinsurance. You can buy, extend and claim online any time – even if you’re already on the road. Internet Access Most locals have home connections and practically every hotel, B&B, hostel and agriturismi (accommodation on working farms or wine estates) offers free wi-fi (albeit patchy at times given many properties’ centuries-old thick walls or deeply rural location). Specialised internet cafes are practically non-existent. Legal Matters The average tourist will only have a brush with the law if they’re robbed by a bag-snatcher or pickpocket, or if their car is towed away. In an emergency (to report theft, robbery, assault or accidents) call 113 or 112 – the latter has a reply service in a number of languages. Maps Once you meander off the main road and dip into rural Tuscany, a map definitely comes in handy. Several sheet maps cover the region, including Michelin’s Toscana (1:200,000), Marco Polo’s Toscana/Tuscany (1:200,000) and Touring Editore’s Toscana (1:200,000). Buy them from bookshops and some petrol stations. If you’re relying on digital maps, download off-line versions before departure: in rural Tuscany you will frequently find yourself with zero connectivity. Money ATMs widely available. Credit cards accepted at most hotels and many restaurants. ATMs Bancomats (ATMs) are widely available throughout Tuscany and are the best way to obtain local currency. Credit & Debit Cards International credit and debit cards can be used at any bancomat displaying the appropriate sign. Cards are also good for payment in most hotels, restaurants, shops, supermarkets and tollbooths. If your card is lost, stolen or swallowed by an ATM, you can telephone toll free to have an immediate stop put on its use: American Express %06 7290 0347 Diners Club %800 393939 MasterCard %800 870866 Visa %800 819014 Currency The euro is Italy’s currency. Notes come in denominations of €500, €200, €100, €50, €20, €10 and €5. Coins are in denominations of €2 and €1, and 50, 20, 10, five, two and one cents. Money Changers You can change money in banks, at the post office or in a cambio (exchange office). Post offices and banks tend to offer the best rates; exchange offices keep longer hours, but watch for high commissions and inferior rates. Taxes & Refunds A Value Added Tax (VAT) of around 22%, known as PRACTICALITIES Weights & Measures Italy uses the metric system. Smoking Banned in all enclosed public spaces. Newspapers Major dailies include Corriere della Sera (www.corriere.it/english) and La Repubblica (in Italian, www.firenze.repubblica.it).The Florentine (www.theflor entine.net) covers local news, views and classifieds, and is published monthly in English online and in print (free).\n\nDirectory A–Z Opening Hours 329 Imposta di Valore Aggiunto (IVA), is slapped on most goods and services in Italy; a discounted rate of 10% applies in restaurants, bars and hotels. It’s sometimes possible for non-EU residents to claim a refund of VAT paid on goods. CLAIMING TAX REFUNDS If you’re a non-EU resident and spend more than €154.94 on a purchase, you can claim a refund when you leave. The refund only applies to purchases from affiliated retail outlets that display a ‘tax free for tourists’ (or similar) sign. You have to complete a form at the point of sale, then have it stamped by EU customs as you leave the zone (if you are visiting one or more EU countries after visiting Italy, you’ll need to submit the form at your final port of exit). For information and a list of refund offices in Florence, visit Tax Refund for Tourists (www.taxrefund.it). Tipping Taxis Round the fare up to the nearest euro. Restaurants Many locals don’t tip waiters, but most visitors leave 10% to 15% if there’s no service charge. Cafes Leave a coin (as little as €0.10 is acceptable) if you drank your coffee at the counter or 10% if you sat at a table. Hotels Bellhops usually expect €1 to €2 per bag; it’s not necessary to tip the concierge, cleaners or front-desk staff. Opening Hours Opening hours vary throughout the year. We’ve provided summer (high-season) and winter (low-season) opening hours, but be aware that hours might differ in the shoulder seasons. Banks 8.30am to 1.30pm and 3.30pm to 4.30pm Monday to Friday Restaurants 12.30pm to 2.30pm and 7.30pm to 10pm Cafes 7.30am to 8pm Bars and pubs 10am to 1am Shops 9am to 1pm and 3.30pm to 7.30pm (or 4pm to 8pm) Monday to Saturday Post Le Poste (www.poste.it), Italy’s postal system, is reasonably reliable, but if you are sending a package you might want to use DHL or FedEx, which can be safer. Francobolli (stamps) are available at post offices and authorised tabacchi (tobacconists; look for the official sign: a big ‘T’, often white on black). Since letters often need to be weighed, what you get at the tobacconist for international airmail will occasionally be an approximation of the proper rate. If you’ve any concerns about ensuring an accurate stamp price, use a post office. Tabacc"
