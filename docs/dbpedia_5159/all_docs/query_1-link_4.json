In this course you read selections from many of Joyce’s works, exploring such themes as art, politics, love, and religion. As we study Joyce’s experimental writing, you pursue your own creative writing. Dublin itself is our classroom as we range from its museums to its pubs and traverse the same streets, parks, and shores that Joyce and his characters inhabited, gaining a vibrant sense of the city’s culture and history.\n\nProf. Steve Bauer & Samantha Wallace\n\nWork on a consulting project focused on an international start up or portfolio company's business issue. Your consulting team will travel to the client company location to commence the consulting engagement. Learn about the local culture, economy, and historical and current business trends in preparation for your in-person client meetings and to conduct in country primary research during the pre-travel academic sessions.

How do approaches to business ethics in our own countries differ from Malaysians' and Thais'? In this course, we will ask if Malaysia and Thailand have anything to teach our countries. We will focus on three Asian faiths and cultural traditions, visit 3 socially responsible companies, and aim to understand what qualities those 3 Asian traditions share which may distinguish them generally from Western traditions in business ethics.\n\nProf. Jim Hoopes\n\nBusiness Environment in Spain is a study abroad course designed to introduce Babson students to the diverse Spanish economy with emphasis on the regional innovation ecosystems of Madrid and Barcelona. It examines the challenges that Spain has faced in recovering from the global financial crisis of 2008 as well as the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Also, practice Entrepreneurial Thought and Action within the cultural/institutional environment in Japan. You will work in teams to conduct observations, identify problems and opportunities, design an entrepreneurial initiative, and assess its impact (including stakeholder analysis) and feasibility in various contexts/perspectives.\n\nProf. Yasu Yamakawa\n\nExplore how Paris has created an increasingly vital entrepreneurial ecosystem and get a first-hand look at the French entrepreneurs and investors who are putting the concept of entrepreneurship into practice. In the last few years, France’s economy has stagnated and like other regions in Europe, such as Barcelona and Lisbon, local governments have seen that there is an opportunity to revive the economy by encouraging more entrepreneurial activities. Join the course to gain new perspectives and get experience consulting to local startups.\n\nProf. Peter Cohan"
