Coffee, cake, and homemade soup will be served. This movie is an East-German/DEFA-Film by director Siegfried Kühn. It is based on the famous novel by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe written in 1809 during the Napoleonic wars. Employing the metaphor of chemical reactions to examine romantic relationships, Goethe’s story describes the emotional dynamics in play when an aristocratic couple (Edward and Charlotte) invite an old friend (Captain Otto) and Charlotte’s niece Ottilie to live with them on their estate. The film will be shown in German with English subtitles.\n\nAll of our events are open to the public.\n\nWe welcome members and non-members alike."
