        "text": "Los Angeles Filmforum presents\n\nLarry Gottheim: Chants and Dances\n\nFriday, February 7, 2020, 8:00 pm\n\nAt the Echo Park Film Center, 1200 N. Alvarado St., Los Angeles CA 90026\n\nLA premieres!\n\nRenowned filmmaker Larry Gottheim returns to Los Angeles Filmforum with a couple of classic films and the LA premieres of two new digital works.\n\nNote the change in date & time & location.\n\nLarry Gottheim taught film-making and cinema aesthetics at Binghamton University until 1998. This was a program he started in the late 1960’s, the first regular undergraduate program dealing with film as a personal art. His early silent films such as FOG LINE, DOORWAY, BARN RUSHES are widely known. In the 1970’s he made ELECTIVE AFFINITIES, a set of 4 long films that explore complex relationships between sound and image. While still formal and concerned with sound and image, some later films include material that would ordinarily be seen in a documentary mode (MACHETE GILETTE.... MAMA.) His many years’ involvement with Vodou in Haiti led to a video work CHANTS AND DANCES FOR HAND. His most recent film KNOT/NOT is a complex web of material tied together by repetition and superimposition. His works have been included in numerous museums, festivals and other venues throughout the world.\n\nhttps://www.larrygottheimfilms.com/\n\nSpecial Thanks to Amy Halpern.\n\nTickets: $12 general; $8 students (with ID)/seniors; free for Filmforum Members.\n\navailable through Brown Paper Tickets at https://gottheim2.bpt.me or at the door.\n\nFor more information: www.lafilmforum.org or 323-377-7238."
