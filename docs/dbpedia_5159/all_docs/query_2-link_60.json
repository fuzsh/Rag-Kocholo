        "text": "[#image: /photos/5909586d019dfc3494e9ee8f]\n\nI’ve been avoiding compiling a Best Of list, not for the usual reasons—it’s too reductive, I can’t make up my mind—but because, when it comes to the theatre, so much went on this year, and so much of it was tied to, or associated with, other cultural artifacts I love, such as books and movies and music, that I felt like a fake having to pass myself off strictly as a theatre critic. But we go with what we have. Or what the public makes of us. Herewith, a provisional list of that which enlightened, fed the soul, amused, or distracted this year; the order is dictated by the intensity of my emotional response. Sort of.\n\nDiane Keaton’s memoir “Then Again.” She understands film acting because she understands collage, and she knows that cinema—those little bits of film glued together to make some kind of a whole—are just that: an accumulation of fragmentary moments that are collaged by the director to provoke an emotional response in the viewer. Keaton’s interest in collage was encouraged by her mother, Dorothy Hall. As a girl, Keaton came back to Los Angeles from a family trip to New York City, thrilled by the Joseph Cornell wonders she’d seen at MOMA; could she collage her room like that? The very beautiful Dorothy, once voted Mrs. Los Angeles, inspired her eldest child to pursue her dreams from the first, and this book is a kind of dream, if memories are dreams, and the collage-like structure is as much a homage to the form as it is to Keaton’s interest in joining together emotional fragments into a whole, but with all the cracks still showing.\n\nBobby Cannavale and Elizabeth Rodriguez in “The Motherfucker with the Hat.” The stage is a camera in permanent medium shot. Nothing gets more tired quicker than watching actors working neatly within the parameters of the proscenium arch—that is, keeping their performances in a kind of emotional medium shot. Cannavale and Rodriguez climbed the fourth wall, broke it down, and built it up again, in one of the best collaborations I can recall seeing in recent years, and their freedom was supported by Stephen Adly Guirgis, whose script about lowlifes stepping high (while sometimes getting high) was also a poem about Guirgis’s New York, which happily diverges off the Scorsese-Allen beaten-to-death path, to describe a city that never winks.\n\nAudra McDonald in “Porgy and Bess.” I wouldn’t want to say McDonald is a pure theatre animal—she’s worked on films over the years as well—but I often wonder why the screen hasn’t been as good to her as the stage. Obviously, McDonald doesn’t have a shortage of beauty or talent, but I think the stage gives her what film or television work cannot: continuity. As the most nuanced Bess we’ve ever had, McDonald lets us share what new love often looks like: tentative, shy, and angry with itself (why did I let this bounty pass me up before, and for years?). Partnered with the beautiful Norm Lewis as Porgy, the broken Bess sings “I Loves You Porgy” as though it were a roundelay by turns shameful, exciting, and too tender to be exposed to an audience. But they’re doing it.\n\nDavid Adjmi. Of the new young playwrights, he’s one of the more exciting because his work shows every indication of never falling into anything approaching predictability or self-caricature, that which too often passes as style. “Stunning” was crammed with so many ideas, but that was just the mark of an artist who was thrilled to be working full scale in his chosen medium that he could barely (intellectually speaking) sit down: Here’s this idea! Let’s try this! In the end, who wouldn’t want to be part of that kind of experience? A surfeit of ideas and feelings rather than the usual conventional wisdom dressed up as a play—the old two-act call and response. “Elective Affinities” was entirely different in structure than “Stunning,” but not in intent: Adjmi wears his politics on his linguistically brocaded sleeve. Still, he’s smart to work with directors who get his gorgeous blend of narrative, girl talk, and politics—and can bring out the meanness to be found in each. I’ve read the playwright’s full-length piece, “Marie Antoinette,” which will be produced at Yale Rep, and all I can say is that I’ve never read anything like it before—and can’t wait to see it.\n\nSenga Nengudi’s work in the curator Kellie Jones’s necessary survey, “Now Dig This! Art and Black Los Angeles 1960-1980.” A precursor of the brilliant London-based artist, Sarah Lucas, by about thirty years, Nengudi’s biomorphic shapes created out of pantyhose, remarkable drawings, and work as an arts educator in Watts during the nineteen-sixties makes her an artist of considerable power, historical significance, and a producer of just plain beauty who is being given her due under Jones’s clear, not rushed understanding of how black culture made up the “other” L.A.\n\nTyne Daly in “Master Class.” Daly didn’t sentimentalize those parts of Terrence McNally ’s play that could have devolved into the usual diva-solipsism—specifically those moments when Daly-as-Callas talked about her great love and nemesis, Aristotle Onassis—but lifted them up and shed some light on the delicious masochistic thrill that can be the diva’s quest once she’s conquered the world outside her bedroom. Looking straight out at the audience, Daly defied us to be less than interested in the woman she played with such love and not a little criticism: she embodied the spirit of Callas without Callas taking over her considerable technique, and her compassionate distance.\n\nJames Wolcott’s “Lucking Out.” This brilliant book was not reviewed anywhere nearly as attentively as it should have been. But it should have been. It was pitched, unfairly, into the storm of Pauline Kael-ania (largely because of Wolcott’s vivid portrait of his late friend) when, in fact, it’s central theme is the education of a writer. Wolcott’s description of how his drinking family helped shape his emotional reticence and critical acuity, and his subsequent career as a writer at The Village Voice in the nineteen-seventies, are never less than real, poignant, and accurate. Several times throughout the book, Wolcott touches on the subject of race—at CBGBs, in a taxi, and elsewhere—which reminded me of how segregated the cultural world was back in Wolcott’s day, and why I never set foot in CBGBs, and why Lou Reed’s disaffected pose and cool racist chic (“I Wanna Be Black”) was such a turn off. Nevertheless, Wolcott’s back-of-the-class take on the entire scene was better than most contemporary novels, thus pointing out the obvious: Wolcott must allow himself a similar freedom, and write another novel.\n\nKirsten Dunst at the Cannes Film Festival. Sitting next to Lars von Trier, during the press conference for their film, “Melancholia,” was a study in self-containment, the ability to listen, and struggling not to react—the work of a truly disciplined performer. As her director unravelled under the uneasy pressure of success—Dunst would go on to win the Best Actress award for the film—the lovely young actor managed to do what so few performers can ever manage in life: listen without the hope that there’s a camera on the other end of your sentence. Her work during the press conference—and it was work—showed what self-possession looks like, and how it will, hopefully, add glory to her future work.\n\nAnother documentary performance of exceptional naturalness and grace was that of Bill Cunningham in Richard Press’s documentary, “Bill Cunningham New York.” The only other artist who could have described Cunningham’s personality with even greater specificity than Cunningham himself would have been Flaubert, of course, whose “A Simple Heart” aptly illustrates the artist we discover in the film: a figure possessed of preternatural modesty whose religious faith causes him to turn away from the camera in a moment of such heartbreaking self-exposure that we want to turn away, too.\n\n**Sutton Foster in “Anything Goes,”Â Christina Kirk in “Knickerbocker,” Zoe Caldwell in “Elective Affinities,” E. Faye Butler, Starla Benson, Laurence O’Dwyer, and Thomas Jefferson Byrd in “Trouble in Mind,” Edie Falco in “The House of Blue Leaves,” Josh Hamilton in “Three Sisters,” and “The Cherry Orchard,” Maggie Gyllenhaal in “Three Sisters,” Daniel Davis in “The Cherry Orchard,” Kirsten Scott and the showgirls in “Follies,” Kimberly Herbert Gregory in “By The Way, Meet Vera Starke,” Adam Driver in “Man and Boy”**Â (a performer of such immense sexiness and intensity that he recalls the “real looking” wave of actors who made a hit in the films of the nineteen-seventies, such as Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, John Cazale, and Brad Dourif—will somebody write him a movie?),Â **Cate Blanchett in “Uncle Vanya,” Carey Mulligan in “Through A Glass Darkly,” Teena Blain in “Sleep No More,” Tonya Pinkins, Cherise Booth, Angelia Lewis, and Nikiya Mathis in “Milk Like Sugar,” Quincy Taylor Bernstine in “born bad,” Daniel Alexander Jones, Helga Davis, and Sonya Perryman in “Jomama Jones: Radiate.”**Â The greatness of these theatre artists cannot be underestimated, and I not only put them together here because of space, but emotional expediency. In a perfect world, each would be given a column devoted to their superlative work, and the incredible spirit and imagination they brought to narratives having to do, for the most part, with insiders who felt outside the citadel, somehow, or outsiders looking for some sense of community, no matter how wrong, temporary, or superficial. Hamilton, arguably the most nuanced actor we have of Chekhov’s various nuances, made me see the maestro in an entirely new way, while Daniel Alexander Jones as a black American sheathed in European affect, brought me to tears with his presence and showmanship and need. I am grateful to all of these stars—for that is what they are—for illuminating and renewing my interest in performance, and for reviving the pleasures of the text.\n\nAndrew Upton and Tamas Ascher’s “Uncle Vanya,” and Kirsten Greenidge’s “Milk Like Sugar.” While Upton and Ascher’s translation (and Ascher’s direction) of the Chekhov work was the most brilliant adaptation and interpretation of a “classic” work I’ve seen in recent years, I would be hard placed not to call it a new work, given the enthusiasm and energy with which they more or less imagined what someone like Chekhov would have made of the Australian world they placed his characters in. And it was a similar enthusiasm for the freedom to be found in the imagination that made Greenidge’s language such a draw: you wanted to hear more of what her characters had to say because she did, too. While age separate Upton and Ascher from the younger writer, they’re united in their energy and inventiveness, and their interest in making stage-based work that reminds us of why we go to the theatre in the first place.\n\nIllustration by Jim Stoten.\n\nRead more from The New Yorker’s 2011: The Year in Review, at News Desk and at Culture Desk."
