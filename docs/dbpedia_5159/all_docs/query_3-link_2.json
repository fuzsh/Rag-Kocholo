The BA programs are designed to give students knowledge of the literature and culture of their area of concentration, as well as to develop their linguistic competence in one or more of the Romance languages.\n\nStudents in other fields of study may also complete a minor in RLLT. Information follows the description of the major.\n\nCourses in the major may not be counted toward general education requirements. For courses that are not taken as part of a University of Chicago study abroad program, students must petition for elective credit from the College before requesting departmental credit. Advanced language students should consider taking special topic courses at the 20000 and 30000 levels. Some of these courses may require consent of the instructor. In addition to the courses offered in this catalog, please check the UChicago Summer Session website for courses that may be offered each summer.\n\nDegree Program in French and Francophone Studies\n\nProgram Requirements\n\nStudents who elect the major program must contact the French undergraduate adviser before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the major and to complete the required paperwork. Students are strongly encouraged to build their own program in consultation with the French undergraduate adviser. Students must submit to the departmental office an approval form for the major program signed by the French undergraduate adviser by the end of Spring Quarter of their third year.\n\nThe major program in French consists of ten courses beyond FREN 20300 Language, History, and Culture III. One course must be FREN 20500 Ecrire en français or FREN 20503 Modes De Raisonnement Francais (taught in Paris). The remaining courses should be upper-level courses in or related to French, and determined according to the student’s interests and with approval from the French Undergraduate Adviser.\n\nAll students must take at least one departmental course at the introductory level. Introductory-level courses (as designated in the course title or description) are designed as “gateway” courses that provide foundations for the major and are suitable for students who have just completed the advanced language requirement. All students must also take at least two courses that include pre-nineteenth-century material.\n\nThe program offers a number of introductory, bilingual, and cross-listed literature/cultural courses that are open to students before FREN 20500 and that can count toward the major. Please ask the undergraduate adviser for details.\n\nStudents have the flexibility to explore their own interests while developing in-depth knowledge of the language, literature, society, and culture of the Francophone world. The department offers a wide range of courses in language, literature, theater, visual arts, cinema, and music. Departmental courses allow students to gain advanced proficiency in speaking, reading, and writing French and to understand the historical, social, and cultural complexity of France and the Francophone world. Students are encouraged to discuss their course selections with the French undergraduate adviser.\n\nAll students must take a majority of their courses in the department but are encouraged to explore appropriate course offerings in History, Political Science, Sociology, Art History, Cinema and Media Studies, Music, and Theater and Performance Studies and seek approval from the French undergraduate adviser to include non-RLLT courses in their major.\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nStudents are encouraged to participate in the College's study abroad programs in France. Many of these programs confer major or minor credit, including the courses in the summer Advanced French program. The three civilization courses in the French-language European Civilization in Paris program can be used for credit in the French major or minor, assuming a student is not using these courses to fulfill the general education civilization studies requirement. The three courses from the Autumn Quarter African Civilizations in Paris program or the three courses from the Winter Quarter Cinema and Media Studies program in Paris can be used for credit (if they are not being used to meet the general education requirements in civilization studies or the arts). The three courses from the Winter Quarter Middle Eastern Civilizations program in Morocco or the three courses from the Winter Quarter African Civilization program in Dakar can also be used for credit if they are not being used to meet the general education requirements in civilization studies or the arts. Further information is available from the Study Abroad office or at study-abroad.uchicago.edu.\n\nStudents may also petition for credit for other courses taken at the University of Chicago Center in Paris, depending on the course content, or for courses taken at other institutions (for instance, at French universities as part of the year-long study abroad program), subject to College procedures and departmental approval. Up to four courses taken at other institutions can be counted toward the major with the approval of the French undergraduate adviser.\n\nGrading\n\nFrench majors must receive quality grades in all required courses. Non-majors may take departmental courses for P/F grading with consent of instructor. However, all language courses must be taken for a quality grade.\n\nHonors\n\nTo qualify for honors, students must have an overall GPA of 3.25 or higher and an average GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major. They must also submit a completed BA paper to their adviser no later than Friday of fifth week of Spring Quarter of their fourth year. Students with papers judged superior by the BA paper adviser and another faculty reader will be recommended to the Master of the Humanities Collegiate Division for honors. Only students who wish to be considered for honors are required to write a BA paper.\n\nStudents who wish to complete a BA paper are strongly encouraged to register for FREN 29901 Academic Research and Writing in Winter Quarter. If FREN 29901 is not offered, students may instead take FREN 29900 BA Paper Preparation: French. Students seeking honors may count either of these courses towards their course requirements; they must be taken for a quality grade. The BA paper typically is a research paper with a minimum of 15–20 pages, as agreed upon with the BA advisor, and a bibliography written in the language of specialization.\n\nStudents must seek permission from their BA paper adviser to use a single paper or project to meet both the major requirements of Romance Languages and Literatures and those of another department or program. Students must also obtain the approval of both program chairs on a form available from the College adviser, to be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation.\n\nSummary of Requirements: Major Program in French and Francophone Studies\n\n100 Ecrire en français Modes De Raisonnement Francais *900 ** Total Units1000\n\nSample Program: Major in French and Francophone Studies\n\nFREN 20500Ecrire en français100 FREN 20601Expression orale et phonétique100 KREY 21600Francophone Caribbean Culture and Society: Art, Music, and Cinema100 FREN 22203The Literary Avant-Garde100 FREN 23444Voyages littéraires, XXe-XXIe siècles (introductory-level course)100 FREN 24100Nature and the Natural in the Middle Ages100 FREN 25000Molière: Comedy, Power and Subversion (pre-19th century course)100 FREN 25505Grandes voix féminines des Lettres africaines100 FREN 25910Racine (pre-19th century course)100 FREN 29901Academic Research and Writing100 Total Units1000\n\nMinor Program in French and Francophone Studies\n\nStudents who elect the minor program must contact the French undergraduate adviser before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the minor.

Students will be provided with the knowledge and critical skills necessary to understand and engage with the vastly diverse societies and cultural histories of Iberia and Latin America, while also learning how to read and analyze texts with rigor and insight, write carefully and with well-supported arguments, and refine their written and oral expression.\n\nInterdisciplinary Study\n\nStudents may choose from a wide range of courses in Iberian and Latin American languages, literatures, and cultures—including Basque, Catalan, Portuguese, and Spanish—and courses taught by visiting faculty from abroad. Some of our students concentrate on more than one language, in several adaptable combinations. Our students are often double majors who bring to the classroom a multiplicity of perspectives that enrich our interdisciplinary approach to the study of language, literature, and culture. Moreover, many of our majors and minors take cross-listed courses that focus on cinema and media studies, art history, Latino studies, music, and Latin American history, among others.\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nStudents are encouraged to participate in the College's study abroad programs in Mexico or Spain. The three civilization courses in the Spanish-language Civilization in the Western Mediterranean program in Barcelona can be used for credit in the Spanish major or minor, if these courses are not used to fulfill the general education civilization studies requirement.

Romance languages have never existed in isolation and, now more than ever, we live in a globalized society that traverses linguistic borders. This major prepares students to flourish in an increasingly multicultural and multilingual world. In addition, movements of migration and territorial expansion make the domain of Romance languages one of porous borders. The BA program in Romance languages therefore also welcomes students to study additional languages (Basque, Creole, Quechua).\n\nThe major program in Romance Languages, Literatures, and Cultures consists of ten courses beyond the second-year language sequences. Linguistic competence in at least two Romance languages, non-Romance languages of the Iberian Peninsula, or languages of the Caribbean or Latin America, is assumed.\n\nStudents who elect a major program in Romance Languages, Literatures, and Cultures must meet with the undergraduate adviser in each relevant language/literature before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year to declare their intention to complete the major and to complete the required paperwork. Students are strongly encouraged to build their own program in consultation with relevant RLLT undergraduate advisers. Students must submit to the departmental office an approval form for the major program signed by relevant RLLT undergraduate advisers by the end of Spring Quarter of their third year.\n\nGrading\n\nRLLT majors must receive quality grades in all required courses. Non-majors may take departmental courses for P/F grading with consent of instructor. However, all language courses must be taken for a quality grade.\n\nHonors\n\nTo qualify for honors, students must have an overall GPA of 3.25 or higher and an average GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major. They must also submit a completed BA paper to their adviser no later than Friday of fifth week of Spring Quarter of their fourth year. Students with papers judged superior by the BA paper adviser and another faculty reader will be recommended to the Master of the Humanities Collegiate Division for honors. Only RLLT students who wish to be considered for honors are required to write a BA paper.\n\nStudents should select a faculty supervisor for the BA paper early in Autumn Quarter of their fourth year. During Autumn or Winter Quarter they may register for CATA 29900 BA Paper Preparation: Catalan, ITAL 29900 BA Paper Preparation: Italian, FREN 29900 BA Paper Preparation: French, PORT 29900 BA Paper Preparation: Portuguese, or SPAN 29900 BA Paper Preparation: Spanish with the faculty member chosen to direct the writing of the BA paper. Students writing a BA paper in French, Italian, or Spanish are strongly encouraged to take FREN 29901 Academic Research and Writing, ITAL 29901 Academic Research and Writing, or SPAN 29901 Academic Research and Writing if this course is offered, in lieu of FREN/ITAL/SPAN 29900 BA Paper Preparation. Students seeking honors may count one of these courses towards their course requirements; it must be taken for a quality grade. The BA paper typically is a research paper with a minimum of twenty pages and a bibliography written in the language of specialization. It should engage with sources and scholarship from one or multiple fields and literatures.\n\nStudents must seek permission from their BA paper adviser to use a single paper or project to meet both the major requirements of Romance Languages and Literatures and those of another department or program. A significant and logical section of the BA paper must be written in the appropriate Romance language in consultation with the student's BA paper adviser. Students must also obtain the approval of both program chairs on a form available from the College adviser.
