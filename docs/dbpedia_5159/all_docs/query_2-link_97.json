        "text": "Horizons is a pivotal work in Larry Gottheim’s filmmaking career, for a number of reasons. After having made seven short films, Horizons was Gottheim’s first feature-length effort. In many respects it is the summation of certain tendencies in the first part of Gottheim’s career, even as it introduces strategies that will define the newer works to come. Gottheim retroactively designated Horizons as the first part of his four-feature suite Elective Affinities, suggesting that it offered a gateway for understanding the major precepts of this second phase of production."
