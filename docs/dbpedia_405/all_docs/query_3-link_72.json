        "text": "Getting to explore the Smith College campus in Northampton MA for an engagement session on one of the most gorgeous fall days this year felt like an absolute dream. When Liz and Lisa reached out to me for their engagement session there I was thrilled. First off, I adore Northampton MA so much but I was also really excited to explore the Smith College campus. Especially with people who know it well! Although to be fair- whether I know a space or not I am driven by where the light is and what inspires me as well, so it was a little bit of that mixed with some spots that Lisa and Liz enjoyed!\n\nWe met up outside the campus and before we even officially met up I was furiously texting them I AM AT THE GATES OMG THE LIGHT IS AMAZING!!!! So. Hi. We started off our Smith College engagement bonanza on literal fire! I jumped right in because the light was moving fast, explaining how I work as I go – which a huge part of how I work is light. The second part that fuels my fire is true connection. Here, we had BOTH and I was so happy and inspired I had to talk myself down so I didn’t come across as too…. much. I tried, at least!\n\nOn our way to elsewhere, we stopped at this gorgeous wrought iron fence. They are clearly laughing at my excitement here and I welcome it! More laughing, all of the laughing!\n\nThis ivy wall, against, I don’t even know what building on the Smith College campus made my heart race. Keep scrolling!\n\nLike. I cannot.\n\nLiterally on the way to the restrooms I saw this light, these fluffy grassy things and BAM. It’s a spot for photos!\n\nThere was a soccer game that sounded super intense going on on the other side of the bridge, it was fun to listen to while we worked! Also a teeny bit distracting as I am a big fan of soccer!\n\nThere is also a little adorable waterfall situation on the Smith College campus that was gorgeous and noisy and I LOVE the spray that just floated all around us!\n\nAdd in a conservatory? I am like LADIES, ENOUGH. ENOUGH. Just kidding I wanted MORE MORE MORE I wanted to go INSIDE and explore and touch all of the plants and take ALL OF THE PHOTOS…! We had outside to enjoy only, which was amazing! Talk about a versatile campus!\n\nThis all felt very… California to me? I don’t know but I was just so in love. With Liz and Lisa and their obvious love and care for one another; with literally every single spot Smith College gifted us with; the LIGHT. All of it!\n\nAdd in a swing hanging from a tree??????? I am literally running on fumes because my adrenaline dumps are just coming fast and furious I am just so excited!\n\nA pond. A boat house. MORE MORE MORE. Smith College you have my heart! What a spot!\n\nThe colors they chose for this part of their session were PERFECT!\n\nWe were almost done. I think I *may have even said ‘OK ladies I think I got it!’ Then we walked past this freaking tree. AS IF I COULD NOT STOP.\n\nIt is just so… textured and lovely and colorful and also all the colors are harmonizing so beautifully together!!! Just. WOW.\n\nEven the walkways were stunning! Add in gorgeous design with gorgeous light and Lisa and Liz? FLIP ME OVER, I AM DONE FOLKS. Ok byeeeeeee\n\nLiz and Lisa. To say I am excited for your wedding is almost a lie. I am BEYOND. You both had such calm loving and easy energy. I really enjoyed working with you both creating these images that just take my breath away! I can’t wait to be back on that Smith College campus again and even more I can’t wait to create more magic with you both again! Thank you for trusting me with your engagement session and wedding!
