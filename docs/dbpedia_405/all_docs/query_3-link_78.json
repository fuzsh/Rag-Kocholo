        "text": "Stories You May Like\n\nI struggled with what to do after graduation—but in our data-heavy landscape, today’s students are much more empowered\n\nBy Anna Esaki-Smith ’83\n\nI racked up my fair share—from banks to magazines to consumer goods companies—as I cast a wide net to find an employer that might see something in me and my degree.\n\nI even wrote to the manager of the English rock band The Police when I heard they were planning a tour in Japan, offering my vague services as an on-the-ground coordinator.\n\nQuite incredibly, the manager wrote a kind letter back, informing the naïve, soon-to-be Cornell graduate that they had already hired someone who could help them.\n\nAs Homer Simpson would say: D’oh!\n\nBut nowadays, high school students feel more pressure to know what they want to do before even starting college than I did when I was about to graduate.\n\nWith high tuition fees, there is little time—or money—to “find yourself” during your four undergraduate years.\n\nStories You May Like\n\nIf I were starting college now, maybe all those hours I spent throwing a Frisbee with friends at the old “Dust Bowl” on West Campus would have been spent Googling careers.\n\nIf I were starting college now, maybe all those hours I spent throwing a Frisbee with friends at the old 'Dust Bowl' on West Campus would have been spent Googling careers.\n\nI eventually did find my way, but not before stumbling a bit.\n\nAfter a few jobs here and there, I got a master’s in journalism at Columbia and became a foreign correspondent with Reuters in Tokyo. Hooray, Asian studies degree!\n\nMy less-than-linear career trajectory inspired me to write my book about navigating the college admissions landscape: Make College Your Superpower: It’s Not Where You Go, It’s What You Know aims to support students in what’s become an anxiety-ridden application process.\n\nI still have some of those “ding” letters, which at this point are about as parched and worn as the Dead Sea Scrolls. Maybe today’s university graduates, hopefully a bit more focused than I was, are getting fewer of them.\n\nAnna Esaki-Smith ’83 co-founded the research consultancy Education Rethink and helps universities and edtech companies with their internationalization strategies. She's also a contributor to Forbes, writing about higher education. After many years living and working overseas, she resides in Westchester County, NY—and, happily, was able to attend her 40th Reunion.\n\n(All images provided.)\n\nPublished March 18, 2024"
