        "text": "Smith College is an all-female undergraduate school that’s also home to some of the best architectural and art pieces in the United States. Smith is reputed as one of the top producers of female industry leaders in various fields. The school boasts of a strong academic program for courses related with the arts, science, business, government, and law.\n\nThis college is considered one of the most selective liberal arts colleges in the United States. Like many liberal arts colleges, an open curriculum is allowed and encouraged. Students map out their own coursework and choose from over 50 courses. Students have the option of cross-registration to nearby colleges in the Five Colleges consortium, namely Amherst, Hampshire, and Mount Holyoke colleges, and the University of Massachusetts. Smith is renowned as a school for intellectuals and house some of the rarest art pieces and largest library collection in the country.\n\nSmith undergraduates have an automatic spot in a college-funded internship. Students are able to train with mentors in organizations related with social work, the arts, media, health, education and other fields.\n\nWhile the undergraduate classes are all-female, male students are allowed in the graduate programs.\n\nSchool History\n\nIn 1871, the college was established after a generous donation from Sophia Smith, who inherited a fortune from her father and brothers. The school officially opened in 1875 and started with 14 students and six faculty members. The school was meant to be a female counterpart of the all-male colleges already established at that time. In the 1890s, the planning of the campus was done in the style of an arboretum. The architect that designed the school was Frederick Law Olmsted, the same architect that designed Central Park in New York.\n\nCampus Life\n\nSmith is a residential college and most students live in campus. There are several housing options, including cooperative living and dormitory living. Freshmen have a guaranteed slots in the dormitories, so finding a home in Smith is not a problem for new students. Late night escort services as well as twenty-four hour security facilities are available, making Smith College safe for all its students and faculty members. There is a hotline available for students with emergencies. Moreover, the school offers self defense workshops for interested students.\n\nMany Smith students look forward to joining the Junior Year Abroad programs, which enable them to live and study in European cities such as Paris, Hamburg, Florence and Geneva as exchange students.\n\nFinding a way to hone one’s leadership skills is not a problem in Smith, as most students are able to find the right extracurricular activities to practice their leadership skills and hone their talents. Music enthusiasts can join choral groups, form a concert band, and join the dance troupe and drama club. Budding writers can contribute to the literary magazine and student newspaper. Students also use their extra time to continue the operation of a radio station, a television station and an active student government. It’s not surprising that many of the students have a lot of time leftover for athletics as well as other clubs despite their academic load. Most Smith students are reliable and responsible, as well as ambitious in their chosen careers.\n\nThe support for LGBT groups is remarkable among the Smith student population. The college sponsors discussions on and seminars for topics such as coming out as transgender in the workplace.\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nSmith College accepts students based on merit, not the capacity to pay the tuition fee and other expenses such as housing. The school is committed to meeting the full documented need of students that qualify for financial aid packages. Students complete the financial aid application and the college evaluates the need of the student to come up with a financial aid package.\n\nRankings"
