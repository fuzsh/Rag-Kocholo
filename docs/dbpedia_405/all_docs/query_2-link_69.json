        "text": "At Smith we look at the whole applicant and do not rely on a test score to define your potential for academic success. Your academic record, extracurricular activities, essay, recommendation letters, personal accomplishments and characteristics, and engagement in your community are all carefully considered during our review and selection process.\n\nÂ\n\nFirst year applicants may apply to Smith under one of three decision plans: Early Decision I, Early Decision II, and Regular Decision. There is no application fee.Â The submission of SAT or ACT scores is optional for all applicants.\n\nÂ\n\nInternational applicants are required to demonstrate English proficiency and may be required to submit testing.Â Please see ourÂ websiteÂ for more details.\n\nTransfer students must have completed at least one semester at any of a variety of institutions, including four-year private and public colleges and universities, community and junior colleges, and international institutions. Women who are 24 or older, a veteran or have a dependent other than a spouse must apply to Smith as Ada Comstock Scholars. Smith uses the Common Application for all transfer student types (Traditional Transfer, Ada Comstock Scholars, and Visiting Students.) Please be sure to select the applicable program when applying. There is no application fee.\n\n\"At Smith, I've discovered that I'm a lot more capable than I thought. Being at a women's college has given me the confidence to explore new experiences, and being at Smith has taught me that I can do whatever inspires me.\""
