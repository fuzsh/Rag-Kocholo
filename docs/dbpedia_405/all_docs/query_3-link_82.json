        "text": "Each school has different requirements for standardized testing. Only a few schools require the SAT or ACT, but many consider your scores if you choose to submit them.\n\nSmith College hasn't explicitly named a policy on SAT/ACT requirements, but because it's published average SAT or ACT scores (we'll cover this next), it's likely test flexible. Typically, these schools say, \"if you feel your SAT or ACT score represents you well as a student, submit them. Otherwise, don't.\"\n\nDespite this policy, the truth is that most students still take the SAT or ACT, and most applicants to Smith College will submit their scores. If you don't submit scores, you'll have one fewer dimension to show that you're worthy of being admitted, compared to other students. We therefore recommend that you consider taking the SAT or ACT, and doing well.\n\nSmith College SAT Requirements\n\nMany schools say they have no SAT score cutoff, but the truth is that there is a hidden SAT requirement. This is based on the school's average score.\n\nAverage SAT: 1415\n\nThe average SAT score composite at Smith College is a 1415 on the 1600 SAT scale.\n\nThis score makes Smith College Strongly Competitive for SAT test scores.\n\nSmith College SAT Score Analysis (New 1600 SAT)\n\nThe 25th percentile SAT score is 1390, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 1500. In other words, a 1390 on the SAT places you below average, while a 1500 will move you up to above average.\n\nHere's the breakdown of SAT scores by section:\n\nSectionAverage25th Percentile75th Percentile Math720670760 Reading + Writing705700760 Composite141513901500\n\nSAT Score Choice Policy\n\nThe Score Choice policy at your school is an important part of your testing strategy.\n\nSmith College has the Score Choice policy of \"Highest Section.\"\n\nThis is also known as \"superscoring.\" This means that you can choose which SAT tests you want to send to the school. Of all the scores they receive, your application readers will consider your highest section scores across all SAT test dates you submit.\n\nClick below to learn more about how superscoring critically affects your test strategy.\n\nTherefore, if your SAT superscore is currently below a 1500, we strongly recommend that you consider prepping for the SAT and retaking it. You have a very good chance of raising your score, which will significantly boost your chances of getting in.\n\nEven better, because of the Superscore, you can focus all your energy on a single section at a time. If your Reading score is lower than your other sections, prep only for the Reading section, then take the SAT. Then focus on Math for the next test, and so on. This will give you the highest Superscore possible.\n\nSmith College ACT Requirements\n\nJust like for the SAT, Smith College likely doesn't have a hard ACT cutoff, but if you score too low, your application will get tossed in the trash.\n\nAverage ACT: 32\n\nThe average ACT score at Smith College is 32. This score makes Smith College Strongly Competitive for ACT scores.\n\nThe 25th percentile ACT score is 31, and the 75th percentile ACT score is 34.\n\nEven though Smith College likely says they have no minimum ACT requirement, if you apply with a 31 or below, you'll have a very hard time getting in, unless you have something else very impressive in your application. There are so many applicants scoring 32 and above that a 31 will look academically weak.\n\nACT Score Sending Policy\n\nIf you're taking the ACT as opposed to the SAT, you have a huge advantage in how you send scores, and this dramatically affects your testing strategy.\n\nHere it is: when you send ACT scores to colleges, you have absolute control over which tests you send. You could take 10 tests, and only send your highest one. This is unlike the SAT, where many schools require you to send all your tests ever taken.\n\nThis means that you have more chances than you think to improve your ACT score. To try to aim for the school's ACT requirement of 34 and above, you should try to take the ACT as many times as you can. When you have the final score that you're happy with, you can then send only that score to all your schools.\n\nACT Superscore Policy\n\nBy and large, most colleges do not superscore the ACT. (Superscore means that the school takes your best section scores from all the test dates you submit, and then combines them into the best possible composite score). Thus, most schools will just take your highest ACT score from a single sitting.\n\nWe weren't able to find the school's exact ACT policy, which most likely means that it does not Superscore. Regardless, you can choose your single best ACT score to send in to Smith College, so you should prep until you reach our recommended target ACT score of 34.\n\nSAT/ACT Writing Section Requirements\n\nCurrently, only the ACT has an optional essay section that all students can take. The SAT used to also have an optional Essay section, but since June 2021, this has been discontinued unless you are taking the test as part of school-day testing in a few states. Because of this, no school requires the SAT Essay or ACT Writing section, but some schools do recommend certain students submit their results if they have them.\n\nSmith College considers the SAT Essay/ACT Writing section optional and may not include it as part of their admissions consideration. You don't need to worry too much about Writing for this school, but other schools you're applying to may require it."
