It is open to all children in the surrounding communities. The Campus School strives to be a cooperative and responsive community committed to an education that addresses children's cognitive, physical, social, and emotional development. We recognize and respect individual differences and work to build on the strengths of each child. We celebrate children's achievements, helping children recognize their accomplishments and experience a joy in learning. Central to our philosophy is the belief that children should acquire a set of fundamental concepts and skills, as well as the habits of mind and heart, that enable them to understand and operate in their world and become effective problem solvers and responsible community members. We view learning as a dynamic process that is enhanced by an openness to new ideas and a willingness to take intellectual risks in the pursuit of knowledge.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow much does Campus School Of Smith College cost?\n\nCampus School Of Smith College's tuition is approximately $14,100 for private students.\n\nWhat is Campus School Of Smith College's ranking?\n\nCampus School Of Smith College ranks among the top 20% of private schools in Massachusetts for: Oldest founding date.\n\nWhen is the application deadline for Campus School Of Smith College?\n\nThe application deadline for Campus School Of Smith College is Mar. 1 / rolling (applications are due on Mar. 1 but additional applications are reviewed year-round as space permits ).\n\nSchool Reviews\n\n5.00 out of 5 (4 reviews)\n\n5\n\nMy daughter has attended Campus School of Smith College since kindergarten after attending the Smith's preschool at Fort Hill. Now entering 4th grade, she loves going to school every day and is enriched by not only the perks of being a lab school of Smith (student teachers and *phenomenal* resources!) but by having a place where she is a known and valued member of her classroom and school community. Campus School also works hard to include parents and foster a sense of connection among families with activities, gatherings, and opportunities to participate at all levels.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Hannah\n\n5\n\nI just graduated from the Campus School after 7 amazing years there and I have to say, it was the best possible choice for me and my sister. The small class and school size makes for a wonderful environment to grow up in, and by sixth grade, the bonds I'd made with my entire class were immeasurably strong. Looking back, I realize that each and every one of my teachers has been an immensely kind and talented mentor, especially in fifth and sixth grade. This is an amazing school filled with brilliant people and incredible programs.\n\n- Posted by Student/Alumni - hexametramania\n\n5\n\nThe school doesn't live up to its marketing messaging and by 5th and 6th grades most of the kids we know, including are own, have become rather bored with the school's not-very-challenging curriculum. Overall, the education received does not come close to being worth the cost.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Disappointed\n\n5\n\nFrom the moment I walked into the Campus School, I knew it was the right place for my kids. The staff and faculty are so warm and friendly. The students here learn to be critical thinkers and great problem-solvers. The best part is that my kids will leave here in 6th grade with a passion for learning.\n\n- Posted by Parent - Sage\n\nEndorse Campus School Of Smith College.
