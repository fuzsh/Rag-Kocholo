        "text": "With an average student-faculty ratio of 8:1, professors at Smith are always ready and able to help you achieve your academic goals. Whether you’re wondering which chemistry professors are interested in the same research fields as you, looking to declare your major and choose an adviser, or are curious about a particular topic, check out the complete list of faculty and say hello.\n\nAs a small liberal arts college, Smith is poised to offer research positions to undergraduates that larger universities can’t.\n\nThe HSS (Humanities and Humanistic Social Science) labs program, created in the summer of 2021, provides students in the humanities with hands-on research experience alongside faculty members year-round, with 12 labs on campus. Combined with labs in nearly any STEM field, your options for research at Smith are innumerable.\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nOver 100 programs on six continents comprise Smith’s study abroad opportunities. Go for a semester or your entire junior year and immerse yourself in another culture (and possible another language!). The world’s your oyster!\n\nSummer Precollege Programs\n\nGeared toward high school students, Smith’s precollege programs give students a taste of what it’s like to live on campus for one, two, or four weeks, while exploring and learning about a specific topic.\n\nGraduate & Special Programs\n\nSmith offers a number of graduate degrees and special programs. These programs are coed and add to the diversity, breadth of experience, and intellectual energy on campus.\n\nThe Five Colleges\n\nIncorporated in 1965, Five Colleges, Inc., is one of the oldest and most highly regarded consortiums in American higher education. As a Smith student, you can take classes at Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Hampshire colleges, as well as the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Explore the Five College course catalog to learn more."
