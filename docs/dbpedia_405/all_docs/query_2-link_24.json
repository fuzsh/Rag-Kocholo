        "text": "Smith College is a women's college in Northampton, Massachusetts, United States. It is a private, independent, liberal arts college. It is the largest member of the Seven Sisters group of colleges. In 2013, it was number 18 on U.S. News & World Report's list of Best Liberal Arts Colleges.[6]\n\nSmith is a member of the Five Colleges group.[7] That means its students can go to classes at four other schools: Mount Holyoke College, Amherst College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.[8]\n\nSmith College was started in 1871 using money left by Sophia Smith. She left money in her will to start a women's college after her death. In her will, she said:\n\n\"I hereby make the following provisions for the establishment and maintenance of an Institution for the higher education of young women, with the design to furnish for my own sex means and facilities for education equal to those which are afforded now in our colleges to young men.\"[9]\n\nWhen Smith College opened in 1875, it had 14 students and six faculty.[10] By 1915â€“16, there were 1,724 students and 163 faculty.\n\nThe Smith campus covers 147 acres (0.6 km2). It has more than 1,200 varieties of trees and shrubs.\n\nThe United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, was a training ground for junior officers of the Women's Reserve of the U.S. Naval Reserve (WAVES). It was nicknamed \"USS Northampton.\" On August 28, 1942, 120 women went to the school for training.[11]\n\nSmith has had 10 presidents and two acting presidents. (An acting president is someone who does the work of a president when there is no president or the president is not available to do the work.) Elizabeth Cutter Morrow was the first acting president of Smith College and the first female head of the college, but she did not use the title of president. For the 1975 centennial, the college had its first woman president, Jill Ker Conway. Since her term, all Smith presidents but one have been women.\n\nOn December 10, 2012, the Board of Trustees announced that Kathleen McCartney would be the president of Smith College starting on July 1, 2013. Her official inauguration was planned for October 2013.[12]\n\nMany Smith students have become notable. They include:\n\nBarbara Adams, General Counsel of Pennsylvania\n\nTammy Baldwin, US Senator, D-Wisconsin\n\nBarbara Bush (attended Smith but did not graduate), former First Lady of the United States\n\nErnestine Gilbreth Carey, author\n\nPenny Chenery, recipient of the Smith College Medal, owner/breeder of Secretariat\n\nJulia Child, chef and author\n\nJulie Nixon Eisenhower, daughter of Richard Nixon\n\nCaterina Fake (attended Smith but did not graduate), entrepreneur, founder of Flickr and Hunch\n\nMargaret Farrar, crossword puzzle editor\n\nBonnie Franklin, actress\n\nBetty Friedan, feminist, activist, author\n\nSusan George, noted Franco-American political and social scientist, activist and writer\n\nMolly Ivins, columnist and author\n\nMadeleine L'Engle, award-winning author\n\nAnne Morrow Lindbergh, author and aviator\n\nCatharine MacKinnon, feminist, activist, lawyer\n\nAnn M.
