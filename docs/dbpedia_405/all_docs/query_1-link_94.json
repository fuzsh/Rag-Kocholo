        "text": "Truly a wonderful experience if you like a small environment. Academics vary from major to major, as there are many visiting professors who only teach one or two classes, and consistency of class offerings also vary major to major. But, the open curriculum allows you to explore so much without making any firm commitments until your second year. Concentrations are an amazing way to add to your academic profile because they provide some serious practical resume-building experience and can bridge your various majors, minors, or interests. As for housing and campus life: housing is amazing if you know how to work the system. The lottery every year is stressful, but most rooms are big and beautiful (even singles!). Food is subpar but there are so many options every day that you can just go to the dining hall with the meal you like. The campus is stunning and there are many, many, many places to cozy up and study, warm or cold weather alike. I have really loved my experience at Smith so far.\n\nSmith College is an incredible place that balances rigorous academics with a supportive community. As a student, I've found the small class sizes and dedicated professors truly enriching. The campus is stunning, especially in the fall, and Northampton offers a vibrant, artsy atmosphere. The college's commitment to women's education and empowerment is evident in every aspect, from the diverse course offerings to the numerous leadership opportunities. The student body is passionate and politically active, creating an environment where you can engage deeply with important issues. Living in a close-knit residential community has been a highlight, fostering lifelong friendships and collaborative learning. Overall, Smith has provided me with an education that is both intellectually challenging and personally transformative.\n\nI love Smith. The institution certainly has its faults, as does any, and I think that some Smithies are quick to make negative judgements of the college due to the bubble we're in that can limit our perspective in the grand scheme of higher education across the country. I think they make these judgements because Smithies are uniquely driven, passionate, and brilliant people so this is not a criticism of them, but a way to interpret some lower reviews.\n\nMy professors and classes here are incredible and I know I couldn't get this education elsewhere. Students are so involved on campus and our student orgs are uniquely autonomous in a very impressive way. The number of ways you can be involved on campus from day one are immeasurable. The class sizes are great and the house communities can't be found at any other school. If you come with realistic expectations and want to put effort into connecting with the community, Smith is a great place for you.\n\nThose considering Smith College should read \"The Strange Disappearance of Sophia Smith\" by Quentin Quesnell. Today, the college has taken a radical departure from the Christian institution as set forth in her Last Will by Sophia Smith which can be found online.\n\nKnow exactly what you need to get from your education. After investing four years of my life as an Ada Comstock scholar to earn my BA to seek gainful employment, I was not even given as much as an interview for a job I applied for at Smith that I was well-qualified for.\n\nAt Smith, equity, diversity, and inclusion DOES NOT include conservative traditional values. Your voice will be silenced. One must wonder how \"sustainable\" the college is at this point.\n\nBefore Smith, the courses I took at the local community college were every bit as good as those at Smith. Do not be fooled by a brand name. If it is an education you seek, do your homework and get the best value for your money. Look beyond the elitist facade.\n\nAdmin does not care about what students think, but it's really easy to find your people. And honestly, the people are what makes your experience at Smith worthwhile. However, the workload is CRAZY and the culture is very queer-centric. I'm queer, so it didn't matter, but I can imagine straight people having a hard time here.\n\nMy first two years at smith were wonderful, but then I started to seriously struggle with my mental health and they did next to nothing to help me. Now I am one class shy of my degree and they won't let me finish at Smith. Not only do I have to find a high level astronomy course that I could take from where I live, but they haven't helped my figure it out at all. In fact I would argue that Smith has made this whole situation significantly harder and has basically been ignoring me. I have lots of friends with similar stories as well. Yes, Smith has a really wonderful queer student community, but their bureaucracy is soul-crushing and if you struggle with your mental health I would recommend against this institution. All they really want is to keep up their image as an elite college and satisfy their alums so they can keep their multi-billion dollar endowment.\n\nI pretty much enjoyed my time at Smith. As a women's college, I was often inspired and touched by professors, alumnaes, and my fellow classmates. It was a place to bond. The school and professors really cared about you, and they were all super sweet. I heard many people said that Smith is a \"bubble\", and it's kinda true. I felt like i could do anything there without being judged.\n\nIncredible experience to be around so many intellectual women. Brilliant faculty who were very active and highly respected researchers (the College supported them with resources so they could publish and stay active as scholars) and were also incredible teachers. As a faculty member now at an elite university, I can say that Smith is very unusual in the kind of intellectual fire you experience on campus. Students arrive very well-prepared, of course, to do rigorous academic work but they also all have a sense of where they want to go. It was not a place that pandered to students and I am so grateful that we were taught from the start that we needed to show up prepared with reading notes and questions. (I've taught too many students who think it is acceptable to roll into class with some half-baked ideas from skimming the reading; at Smith that was not tolerated).\n\nOf course, Smith housing is legendary, the campus is beautiful, and the 5 Colleges offer so many social opportunities!"
