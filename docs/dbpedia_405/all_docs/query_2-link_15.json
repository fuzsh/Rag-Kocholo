        "text": "Smith College, liberal arts college for women in Northampton, Massachusetts, U.S. One of the Seven Sisters schools, it is among the largest privately endowed colleges for women in the United States. Bachelor’s degrees are granted in 29 departmental and 8 interdepartmental programs, and undergraduates are urged to study in seven fields of knowledge: literature, historical studies, social science, natural science, mathematics and analytic philosophy, the arts, and foreign languages. Smith is noted for its School for Social Work, which offers master’s and doctoral degree programs. Master’s degrees are granted in education, biological sciences, Italian, dance, playwriting, music, physical education, and religion. Smith belongs to the Five Colleges consortium (along with Amherst, Hampshire, and Mount Holyoke colleges and the University of Massachusetts), which provides cooperative undergraduate and graduate programs. Since 1924 qualified students have spent their junior year abroad; full-year programs are available in Florence, Italy; Hamburg, Germany; Geneva, Switzerland; and Paris, France. Total enrollment is about 2,500.\n\nSophia Smith, an heiress, left her fortune to establish Smith College, which was founded in 1871 and opened in 1875. The first women’s college basketball game, between Smith’s freshman and sophomore teams, was played there in 1893. The first female president of Smith, Jill Ker Conway, served from 1975 to 1985. Noted alumnae include conservationist and editor Nancy Newhall, anatomist Florence Rena Sabin, writers Margaret Mitchell and Sylvia Plath, feminists Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, and culinary expert Julia Child."
