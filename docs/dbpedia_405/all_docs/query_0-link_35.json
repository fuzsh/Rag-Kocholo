        "text": "Studies in Clinical Social Work: Transforming Practice, Education and Research was founded in 1930 by Smith College School for Social Work (SSW) in Northampton, MA. Founded in 1918, Smith SSW is the nation’s first psychiatric (clinical) social work program and has since been a leader of graduate training in clinical social work. Over its long and distinguished history, the journal has contributed significantly to the development of clinical knowledge, having published manuscripts by a wide range of influential social work thinkers and practitioners.\n\nContinuing its leadership in and commitment to advancing the field of clinical social work, Studies in Clinical Social Work: Transforming Practice, Education and Research is a refereed journal that serves as a forum for clinicians, social work educators, practicum instructors, and researchers to share high quality work that critically engages and advances knowledge and practice of clinical social work. The journal has a renewed commitment to publishing critical work that reflects implications for promoting racial and social justice within a clinical process as well as advancing practice with individuals, families, and small groups in oppressed and marginalized communities. The journal welcomes submissions of empirically sound research of all types of methodology (i.e., quantitative, qualitative, mixed-methods, review methods). The journal also welcomes conceptual work (e.g., theoretical, case studies) that introduces innovative practice approaches or pedagogical practice and/or helps advance clinicians’ commitment to racial and social justice in a practice context. Arguments made in the articles must be grounded in relevant literature and contribute to advancing the field of contemporary clinical social work.\n\nPeer Review Policy: All papers published in this journal have undergone editorial screening and double-anonymous peer review."
