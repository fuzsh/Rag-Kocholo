Rest assured, though, that Anonymous Information provided to third parties will not allow anyone to identify you, or determine anything personal about you. We may collect Anonymous Information through features of the software supporting our Web site and Web site services through both the means described below and other means.\n\n8.1. IP Addresses; Logs.

Cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data that often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a Web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to use a Web site upon a future visit. We may include cookies on our Web site and use them to recognize you when you return to our site. In addition, other third-party Web sites may recognize our cookies stored on your computer's hard drive, and use that information to provide you with information related to the content of our Web site.

Pixel tags also enable us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they inform us whether e-mails have been opened, to help ensure that our messages are of interest to recipients. None of this data includes Personal Information, and you can \"opt out\" of receiving these types of e-mails from us by following the directions provided in Section 10 (Opting Out). If any Personal Information is collected using such tools, it will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.\n\n8.4. Click-Throughs. We may send e-mail messages which use a \"click-through URL\" linked to content on our Web site. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our Web server before arriving at the destination Web page. We track this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply do not click text or graphic links in the e-mail, or notify us in accordance with Section 10 (Opting Out).\n\n8.5. Banner Ads; Advertising Profiles. Our site may include the use of ad banner partners for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions, and other marketing messages. These ads may be provided, in some cases, by a third party ad service provider or advertiser (collectively, \"Advertisers\"). These Advertisers may use traditional banner ads, or other advertising methods, such as advertising using profiles and related content. An Advertiser may place or utilize its own cookie on your browser, and may use Anonymous Information about your visit to our site, such as the number of times you have viewed the ad. If the Advertiser requests that you provide Personal Information to it, please be aware that this Advertiser's use and collection of this information will be governed by its own privacy policy, and not our Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the Advertiser's privacy policy before providing Personal Information.\n\nAny Anonymous Information Linked with Personal Information is Protected as \"Personal Information.\" To enable us to better understand your characteristics and/or to provide services tailored to your needs, we may link Personal Information with Anonymous Information.

If we choose to send bulletins, Alerts, or other communications to you, we will provide you with the ability to decline, or \"opt out of\", receiving such communications.

We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before fulfilling such requests. You may also delete your name and other Personal Information from our databases.

In addition, if you request the deletion of your Personal Information, you will be unable to utilize the services associated with that Personal Information. We will fulfill deletion requests within a reasonable time.\n\nOffline Collection of Personal Information. You are able to access a variety of different forms through the Web site including, for example, event request forms, payroll forms, and service request forms. Many of the forms you can access on our Web site require you to provide Personal information. Although you can access and print many of our forms online, we require you to submit the completed form to us offline, and not through our Web site. We provide additional terms regarding how we collect and use Personal Information when you provide such information to us through means other than our Web site (collectively, the \"Other Policies\"). Accordingly, the Other Policies, and not this Privacy Policy, govern how we treat Personal Information we collect from you offline.

This information will be publicly available, and will no longer qualify as Personal Information. As such, please use discretion when including Personal Information and other details in Submitted Content you provide to us.\n\n6.4 Right to Decline Submitted Content.

The notice must include ALL of the following:\n\nA physical or digital signature of the owner of an exclusive copyright right (i.e., the copyright owner himself or the owner's exclusive licensee of the right(s) to reproduce, distribute, display, perform or create derivatives) or the owner's authorized agent;\n\nA description of the works claimed to be infringed;\n\nA description of the allegedly infringing works, sufficient to enable the agent to find them;\n\nSufficient information to enable the agent to contact the complainer;\n\nA statement that the complainer believes in good faith that the use of the material is not authorized by the owner, the owner's agent or the law; and\n\nA statement that the information in the notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complainer is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of one or more exclusive copyright rights.\n\nIndividuals who wish to submit a notice are referred to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act Section 512 (c) (3) (A) (for notices alleging that content infringes) or Section 512 (d) (3) (for notices that allege that information location tools such as links contribute to infringement of a work).\n\nThe college's agent will review the notification to be sure it substantially conforms to the statutory requirements. If the notice substantially conforms, the agent will take reasonable steps to notify the page owner of the allegation of infringement and secure voluntary take-down of the work or disable access to the work.\n\nIf the notice fails substantially to conform, but the problems are with requirements 1, 5 or 6 above, the agent will contact the complainer and try to obtain the missing information. If the complainer provides substantially conforming information, the agent will notify the page owner of the allegation of infringement and secure voluntary take-down of the work or disable access to the work.\n\nIf the notice is nonconforming with respect to requirements 2, 3 or 4, or if the complainer does not respond to the agent's request for additional information, the agent will ignore the notice. The agent will archive the notice along with a copy of any correspondence attempting to obtain additional information.\n\nCounter-Notification Procedure\n\nAfter the page owner voluntarily takes down the page or the college's agent disables access to it, the college or the page owner may decide to proceed to counter-notification.\n\nCounter-notices can only claim: (1) that the copyright owner is mistaken and that the work is lawfully posted or (2) that the work has been misidentified. A page owner may assert that a use of another's work qualifies as a fair use and so the copyright owner is \"mistaken\" in characterizing it as infringing.\n\nCounter-notices must contain ALL of the following:\n\nA physical or digital signature of the page owner;\n\nA description of the material removed and its location before it was removed;\n\nA statement that the page owner believes in good faith that the material was removed by mistake or because it was misidentified;\n\nThe page owner's name, address and phone number and his or her consent to jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for that address or any Federal District Court if the address is foreign; and\n\nA statement that the page owner will accept service of process from the complainer.\n\nThe page owner must send the counter notification to the college's agent who will:\n\nPromptly send a copy of any substantially conforming counter-notice to the complainer indicating that the college will restore access in 10 business days; and\n\nRestore access to the allegedly infringing work within 10 to 14 business days after the day the agent receives the counter-notice, unless the agent first receives a notice from the complainer that he or she has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the page owner.\n\nIf the agent receives notice that the complainer has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the page owner, the agent will:\n\nNot repost the allegedly infringing work while court action is pending;\n\nForward the notice to the page owner; and\n\nForward the notice to the appropriate college administrator (the Provost/Dean of the Faculty if the page owner is a faculty member, the Dean of the College if the page owner is a student, or the Vice President for Finance and Administration if the page owner is a staff member)."
