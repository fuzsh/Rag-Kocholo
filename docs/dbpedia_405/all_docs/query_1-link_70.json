        "text": "Now I feel capable of a deeper heartier love to all my friends, and I have often thought of late that I would like to be with you now, to show you how much more loving I am. O thank god for love! … Yes, I have many friends, but no one like Cora. I do not tell them the same things, I do not have toward them the same sort of feeling. And yet I am grateful and glad for all love….I am naturally exclusive- would like to give all of myself to a chosen few..but yet, I am so glad there was a Beloved Desciple [sic]- and that it is written ‘Now Jesus loved Mary, and Martha, and their brother.’\n\n-Eleanor Larrison to Cora, October 18, 1881. Sophia Smith Collection, Eleanor Larrison papers, box 1397, letter 13.\n\nCora, what a comfort you are to me! To me, our friendship defies time and space, bodily weakness and suffering on your part, and a busy life making its never-ending demands on me. I fly to the thought of your faithful love as a refuge when cares oppress, and it contributes to make up the happiness of my bright hours. There is such a sense of rest in the thought of this friendship of ours. I have no jealous pangs. I know you love me; your loving sympathy surrounds me like the atmosphere. And I know I love you. I do not have to anxiously question myself about it.\n\nI am led to think of this by the unrest which Helen causes me so often. I know but too well how much I love her….I did not seek or choose that it should be so. It came from God- and in His own exuding excellent way- a way which seems to the world blinded soul like chance. I came very gradually to love her as well….I could not help myself, so I know that it was sent to me. But I cannot feel sure of her….I find in her something of the same sort of charm that some women find in men. She is ‘manly, as a woman may be womanly’- passionately strong. I never would choose to make advances to her, but am unspeakably happy when she smooths my cheek with her hand, or lays it on my head, looking down at me with the dewy light of her dark grey eyes, and calls me by one of her many names for me….But I cannot be sure, you see. I have not known her long enough, I have not tested and tried her love….As much better is a long tried friendship where both parties have arrived at the love which if not yet perfect, is yet near enough it to cast out fear, as the settled steadfast love of its hearts on their golden wedding day is better than the jealous pangs, the doubts and fears, of the lover in the days of early courtship.\n\n-Eleanor Larrison to Cora, September 17, 1881. Sophia Smith Collection, Eleanor Larrison papers, box 1397, letter 12.\n\nSunday the 5th….Alice–she insists I call her Alice, though I hardly dare–asked me to dinner again to-day….However, I don’t think she cares a straw for me. I am almost positive she is engaged to Brother, or could be if she wanted to….I almost wish she didn’t know Brother, and then I’d be sure she liked me for myself. As for my feelings toward her–well, I can only say that I don’t blame Brother. If I were one of those who were susceptible to such things, I suppose I’d have a “crush” by this time. Thank goodness I’m not.\n\nTuesday the 7th.–I met Alice downtown to-day. She is the nicest, dearest girl I ever saw….That sounds a little ‘dime-novelish’, but I mean it seriously. She’s my ideal of a girl.\n\nIf anyone should read this–any college girl I mean–she’d accuse me of having that which I consider so silly–something which begins with a ‘c’.\n\nMonday, the 13th.–She kissed me to-day! Why is it people put down in their diaries the things they couldn’t forget if they tried?\n\nWednesday the 15th.–In spite of all I’ve said and felt and thought, I must admit it. I have what they call a ‘crush’. At least, I seem to show all the symptoms which distinguish one. If so, a real one is a much more serious affair than would appear to the casual observer….Altogether I think I must confess myself a victim of the freshman malady. In theory I do not approve, but practically I can’t help it. As I’ve said before, this feeling is not a silly one by any means. I do love Alice dearly, and I don’t see why I shouldn’t say so. She is the dearest, truest girl I’ve ever known.\n\nWe are having such a queer time now with the girls. Several of our friends have gotten into entanglements which are causing both them and us a great deal of worry and annoyance. The heart to heart talks, and the good advice that we sane people have lavished on our temporarily insane friends yesterday would fill a volume. It is hard to explain in a letter, but it is about crushes (if you choose to look at them that way.) There is one case that I have prayed over, and what the end will be God only knows. It is not a crush, it is something far too serious and heart-rending for that.\n\n-Eleanor Little to Mother, April 22, 1907. Box 1708, Smith College Archives."
