Instead, you can take as many courses as you like during your membership period.\n\nThere are no course registration fees or additional fees for material, textbooks or eBooks. Everything is included as part of your membership.\n\nWith Sophia, you determine your own level of time commitment. You can move through course work quickly or slow down your pace.\n\nYou can take as many courses as you'd like each month and are allowed to be active in two courses at the same time.\n\nYes, your membership will automatically renew. At that time, you’ll also be billed for your new membership period.\n\nIf within 30 days of payment you are not satisfied, you can cancel your membership by going into your account profile. You can request a refund by contacting your learning coach by email or phone. To receive a refund, you must not have previously completed a Sophia course as a member."
