        "text": "I don’t know which college to go to, and I’m struggling with the fear of being extremely secluded if I attend Vassar. There doesn’t seem to be a lot going on with Poughkeepsie, though I know that Arlington is also in the area: either way, I’m concerned about finding jobs or internships. New York City is 1.5/2 hours away by train, though. I think the art and music scene at Vassar is probably better, and those things are very important to me, considering I’m going to be an English/Psych major and I’m planning on continuing on with my music related hobbies. I’ve also heard a lot about students being very close to professors in small classes, which I like, but they kind of both have that. Vassar is the more selective school and in this case it’s also going to be cheaper for me. Smith is an all girls school, yes, but it’s connected to the Five College Consortium so I could take classes at four other colleges, and it’s a college town- Northhampton is right on its doorstep- so the fear of seclusion isn’t there. The main fear for Smith for me is a lack of diversity both in terms of general population of students and their opinions, but again, both of their student bodies are going to be extremely progressive. It would seem that Smith is predominantly white women and it’s important for me to meet people from different walks of life. I could be wrong about some of this, I don’t know, and I have really limited time to make this decision, and I could use all the help that I can get. These schools are both great but Im struggling to choose. Thoughts?\n\nI think you’re off base.\n\nSmith is 53% white and Vassar 55%…but yes there’s a man/female differential. I think you need to research vs. just assume.\n\nJobs today are mainly found online - interviews to hire - you meet your team on the first day you show up - so whether in Alaska or Poughkeepsie it doesn’t matter. Your majors do though - and you getting an internship or job will depend on your hustle -but also utilizing school resources.\n\nSmith is part of the consortium but not close to the other schools - so would you take advantage?\n\nI’ve not spent time at Vassar but I’ve read many on here who say there is more than enough activity, all the time. You’ll find no matter where you go, many kids mainly stay on the fringes of campus.\n\nChoose the one that is best for you - but make sure you are using accurate info to choose.\n\nI’ve linked the Vassar career page for you. It’s not great - but I would contact the career center and ask for the latest career report. Same with Smith - generic info - ask for the specific outcomes - they’ll have them.\n\nNo wrong choice here - but money does matter (if you have affordability issues). Being selective (or not) doesn’t…\n\nExplore Outcomes ← Explore Vassar ← Admission ← Vassar College\n\nCareer Outcomes | Smith College\n\nI agree with the post above. From what you’ve written, it seems you prefer Vassar. I’m wondering if you have visited both.\n\nI live not far from Vassar. Secluded doesn’t even come to mind. Beacon is nearby and is a very cool and arty place, full of transplanted city hipsters. There are a lot of towns. If anything, I feel Smith is more secluded, though I think it’s a good school. And it’s not like you can walk between the colleges there, except for Amherst and U Mass.\n\nI think this is right. I know for a fact that they have a great radio station. I often listen to it when I’m on my way to central NY state. Poughkeepsie is nothing special, but neither is Amherst, though it’s cute. There are a lot of interesting tourist sights in the Hudson Valley (and a lot of tourists) and I am sure Vassar offers students ways to visit some of the attractions. They probably provide shuttles to various places at the weekends.\n\nI’m not sure where you’re getting some of your information, but Vassar is well connected to NYC in terms of jobs and alumni. I get the sense you’re avoiding making a decision, but to me, your preference for Vassar seems pretty clear.\n\nIn terms of where I’m getting my information, I have been on so many websites and so many forums in the past few days I’ve lost track. Some of the websites were probably old and outdated, and at this point all of the information is so jumbled up in my head there are definitely things I’m flat out wrong about. I appreciate the insight about the area that Vassar is in, and yeah, you’re right, I definitely have a preference for it, but I’m putting off making a decision because I’m scared that it’s not the right one. I appreciate your insights, thank you!\n\nI actually attended Vassar and visit frequently for a variety of reasons. @Lindagaf is offering a description consistent with what I experienced and continue to observe.\n\nFYI a lot of job recruitment at smaller schools (like Vassar or Smith) does take place initially on campus and is followed up in person (particular in NYC). Specifically I was part of a panel of Wall Street veterans that would return to campus annually to host a Women in finance symposium that would include recruitment teams from our various financial institutions. I can’t speak to Smith but in the case of Vassar the proximity to NYC does help with career placement and internships.\n\nI remain in touch with two professors in spite of having graduated over 30 years ago. One came to my wedding having inspired me in a direction I never would have considered without her support. In this regard Vassar is a very special place (and I am sure Smith is as well). This is a hallmark of small LACs.\n\nOne last point and difference Vassar’s campus is enormous relative to the number of students at 1,000 acres while Smith is 147 acres. Vassar students can play golf on the campus course, enjoy the Vassar farm, jog around Sunset lake, explore Shakespeare Gardens or just lounge on “the beach”. There is in fact a lot to do.\n\nI don’t want to over sell the proximity to NYC but it certainly was a great escape valve.\n\nSeveral times a year friend groups would go see concerts at MSG or overnight at a particular NYC students home (that had lots of room) and go to Mott street for amazing Chinese food. It wasn’t ad if we wanted to be off campus frequently because there was a lot to do but it was nice to have as an option.\n\nFrequency increased as we became upper class men and women and many had cars on campus.\n\nIt’s always tough when you make a decision. One truly never knows - til you’re there. Maybe you have a bad roommate or bad professor or get home sick. Maybe it’s just too small.\n\nYou don’t know - but let’s say you panic and pick the other - the same situation applies.\n\nIt could very well be that both work out for you - one never knows.\n\nBut go with your gut - what you feel right now says Vassar and as a bonus, it’s cheaper.\n\nLife is long. Hopefully it works out and it likely will (I read on a third party site that retention is 96%) but if for some reason it doesn’t, that’s ok too. Life is long and full of the unknown - and that’s what makes it exciting.\n\nYou’ve got two great choices here but it’s clear you prefer one - and I’d be there. If it makes you feel better, it’s got much better “cache” in the name too - at least in my opinion.\n\nGood luck.\n\nMy child (sophomore) at Vassar participated in a special career connections program in January just for Sophomores, where they came back to campus early and had a few days of meetings with lots of alums from so many different fields; the students were given a book with all of the contact info, and lots of opportunities to build connections and learn. There was a huge contingent of folks (alums) from NYC, but others from all over.\n\nThe summer after my son’s freshman year, Vassar gave him a grant to go to Peru and work on his Spanish all summer through a program that they recommended for him (he is not a Spanish major, but wanted to improve his fluency). This coming summer, Vassar is giving him a grant to work with a non-profit as an intern (the non-profit couldn’t afford to pay him, so Vassar is paying him instead). He has found Vassar to be very helpful in so many ways - but he did have to proactively go and ask.\n\nThis.\n\nAnd also: in some ways, you have an active part in making it be the “right” or “best” decision. As others have pointed out, there are a lot of elements that go into how you land - at any school. There are good and bad teachers, people, schedules, etc at every school. Your reaction to both will be a critical factor in how happily you land wherever you go. So, remember that every path has it’s puddles, and when you find yourself in one (as you pretty certainly will- it’s the rare life that encounters no puddles over 4 years, especially as a young adult! - have confidence in your ability to figure out how to move through and out the other side. Learning to trust yourself to choose a path, and to trust your ability to handle it if it turns out that it’s time to choose a new path is one of the big jobs of adulting. You’ve got this!\n\nMy husband and I both graduated from Vassar and I wouldn’t use secluded to describe it. Actually, we recently visited Hamilton, Connecticut College and Bates with DS and neither of those campuses could you walk anywhere. Vassar has a coffee shop, a pizza joint, various other restaurants, a bank, a grocery store, post office, etc. literally a block or two off campus. Poughkeepsie has a mall, Target, Marshalls, etc a 10 min drive from campus. I never had a car (I’m from the midwest) but friends did and I could borrow it when I needed a mall trip. Also, Poughkeepsie has lots of restaurants, the walkway over the Hudson, and isn’t far from the Culinary Institute of America, Beacon, Rhinebeck, great hiking, etc. And a train directly to NYC. But there is plenty to do on campus to never need to leave on the weekend. I did field work at the local hospital’s NICU and in a 1st grade classroom. So if your worry is seclusion, I would put that aside! Happy to answer any other Vassar questions!\n\nI’d like to add that the train trip along the Hudson River between Poughkeepsie and NYC is beautiful. Particularly going north at sunset🌄.\n\nWalkway Over the Hudson is also A+, and if you like history at all, FDR’s house and museum at Hyde Park are outstanding.\n\nVassar was my D19’s second choice although she ended up wanting a bigger school. It would be my S24’s first choice if he thought he had a chance at admission!"
