        "text": "This semester, my school system is almost entirely paperless. I occasionally jot things down on a Post-It note or scrap piece of paper, but in terms of my day-to-day operations, everything is digital. The one other exception is that I took a paper circuits exam a few weeks ago. In past semesters, I have had a hybrid system consisting of digital notes and problem sets competed on paper. Even during the fully remote fall 2020 semester, I did my work on paper and then used a scanning app to convert it to a pdf. To read some of my other posts about organizational systems, click here.\n\nBeing a paperless student isn’t for everyone, but has been great for me. The main drawback of a digital system is the increased cost and screen time. To be a paperless student you ideally have a laptop, tablet, and stylus. To read about my specific devices, click here. You may be able to get away with a 2-in-1 device, but it’s suboptimal for remote classes. Specifically, having to split your screen between the Zoom class and a note-taking application would be annoying. In the case of handwritten digital notes, it would be even more difficult as the camera angle would be terrible and you would have no space to write.\n\nCourse Materials:\n\nAll of my classes have course materials and assignment submissions on Moodle. (Moodle is an open-source learning management system). In addition to resources posted to Moodle, many courses require textbooks. I primarily read textbooks on my iPad. Some are official ebooks with designated apps whereas others are just pdfs. Additionally, one of my classes uses a free online textbook that is read from the browser. You can read about saving money on textbooks here.\n\nNotes:\n\nI take all of my notes in Microsoft OneNote. If you have been reading my blog for a while, you are probably are tired of hearing about OneNote, but you’re not getting an apology from me! One thing I love about digital notetaking is the ease of editing. For instance, I can move things around, erase mistakes, and change ink colors. The other key advantage is that if you keep things organized it’s really easy to look back on old notes from past semesters. Even if you are not super organized the search tool can be a lifesaver. That said, flipping through current notes in a notebook is a slightly smoother process than hunting around for the correct page of a digital notebook. I typically handwrite lecture notes on my iPad and type textbook and other reading notes on my laptop. I also type my lecture notes for my UMass computer science course. (You can read more about Five College registration here). Typed notes make sense for that class because there is a lot of information with important details that are necessary to know for the quizzes. One nice thing about remote classes is the ability to take screenshots of key figures and other diagrams. Actually writing things down plays a key role in remembering what you are learning. Thus it’s important to not become dependent on screenshots. On the other hand, if you are spending all of your time trying to write/draw you are probably not actively engaging with the material in real-time.\n\nAssignments:\n\nIn this section, I will be referencing the specific classes I am taking this semester, which you can read about here. For COMPSCI 230, we have online tests and quizzes as well as programming assignments. In other words, it’s all digital by default. For CSC 250, I typeset my homework in Overleaf which is a cloud-based LaTeX editor. For EGR 220 and PHY 210, I handwrite assignments in the default notes app on my iPad. I also occasional sketch diagrams for my CSC 250 assignments. Notes is a very bare-bones application but have served me well this semester. You can have lined or graph paper while you write, but once it’s exported to a pdf the lines disappear. This hasn’t proved to be a problem but also isn’t ideal. A missing feature is the ability to resize hand-drawn diagrams (and other writing). It also doesn’t clearly mark the end of a page so you do have to play around a bit to export your work into a nice pdf. If you don’t mind spending money on apps, I have heard good things about GoodNotes and Notability. For other assignments, I also make use of Google applications such as Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Speaking of Google, Google Drive continues to be my file management system of choice. I use Google Drive to store all of my school work (aside from the notes in OneNote). Furthermore, I designed a whole programming contest using Google Drive which you can read about here.\n\nTests:\n\nI learned the hard way that tests should not be completed in the default Files app! The pdfs get really large and which can result in syncing and saving issues. Having now transitioned to using the PDF Expert app, I haven’t had any issues. I still prefer the experience of annotating in the Files app, but I no longer trust it for exams. One nice thing with PDF Expert is that it still syncs cleanly with the Files app and thus iCloud.\n\nTime and Task Management:\n\nTo round out my digital system, I use Google Calendar, Tascal, and Toggl Track. I use Google Calendar to keep track of all of my events, the associated Zoom links, and deadlines. Tascal is the task management app I built last summer. Finally, Toggle Track is a time tracking application that I have been using since senior year. The data can be useful in helping predict how long an assignment will take, but the main benefit is that it helps me stay focused on the intended task at hand.\n\nThe new Neilson Library opened Monday of this week! I have been walking by regularly, but today (Friday) was my first time inside. The interior is absolutely incredible! This is not going to be a super detailed post as I have only wandered around for about 20 minutes and taken a few photos. For some more professional images and a more complete tour, check out this video. I also wrote this post from a little study spot in the exhibition gallery. In the future, this space will be used to showcase research and artwork from the Smith community. I am finding the chair to be very comfortable and absolutely love the minimalist desk.\n\nI have always liked libraries, but in all honesty, I tended to just study in my room last year. Seeing and experiencing the new Neilson makes it clear what we have been missing this whole time. I am unsure if the new Neilson will actually change my study habits, but I definitely look forward to spending more time here.\n\nIt is worth noting that the library is not completely set up. There are numerous rooms that are only open to staff or closed completely. For instance, Special Collections is slated to open in the fall. Another cool room that is currently closed off is the reflection room (shown below, photo taken through the window).\n\nFurthermore, for social distancing, the library has been de-densified (i.e. chairs have been removed). At current, the building capacity is limited to 300 people. The real-time occupancy can be viewed here. At the moment, there are 101 people here.\n\nNow for some of the oddities of the space. I found it hard to see the individual steps of the stairs down to the basement. Not sure if this is something that others have found to be true. Secondly, the curved transparent walls in the basement bend the light strangely which was a bit disorienting.\n\nBeyond these little nitpicks, the new Neilson is one of my new favorite places on campus. I think Ford Hall is still my favorite building, but Neilson makes a close second.\n\nFor the past three months, I have been collaborating with my computer science professor in designing and organizing a remote programming contest for high school students. My professor has been running this contest since 2006 and was looking for an assistant. My prior programming experience made me a very strong student in her data structures course last fall. (You can read about my journey into engineering and computer science here.) Despite being a student taking the course for credit I took on additional responsibilities as an unofficial course assistant. I am not saying any of this to brag but rather to explain how it is that I got a job offer without even asking for one. A fun fact is that actually participated in this contest back when I was a sophomore in high school.\n\nMy early responsibilities included helping to write the problems and rules. I also tested all of the problems by coding them in both Java and Python. More recently, I have been dealing with registration which has involved creating forms, working with spreadsheets, and sending lots of emails. Today was the actual competition which meant I was overseeing and assisting the jury. I’d be lying if I said that everything went off without a hitch, but I am also very proud of all the work I put in to make it an overall success.\n\nMy work as a contest assistant was fortunately funded through a student research assistance grant from the Committee on Faculty Compensation & Development (CFCD). As it was technically a research grant, I got paid a little over minimum wage. (Most on-campus jobs pay minimum wage whereas research positions pay a bit more. To read more about on-campus jobs, click here.)\n\nWhile this job had a programming component, the real experience I gained was from developing systems and communicating with people. We set up the whole contest in Google Drive, which meant I made extensive use of my Google Suite skills. I also got a lot of practice with written communication through writing the rules, problems, and various emails. Furthermore, as the course assistant, I had a lot of responsibilities but was also wasn’t the project lead. This was a new team dynamic that I learned a lot from. Finally, as mentioned in my post about my Summer 2021 Plans, this job is something that stood out in my résumé."
