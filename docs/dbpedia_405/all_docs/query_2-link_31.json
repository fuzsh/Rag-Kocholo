        "text": "A child's earliest years are the most developmentally formative, shaping their academic and intellectual trajectory. Early classroom environments also imprint children socially and emotionally.\n\nAs the lab school of Smith College, Campus School offers a unique atmosphere fostering both emotional security and intellectual zeal. Nestled on idyllic college grounds, it features small classes, close connections, and cozy spaces, serving as a launchpad into the collegeâ€™s ideas, resources, and energy.\n\nFor example, third graders study rivers in the classroom and observe sediment deposits in a Smith geology lab. Fourth graders explore rainforest ecology in the computer lab and examine related plants in the campus greenhouse.\n\nAs a small-world elementary school within a world-class college, Campus School creates a safe space for young learners to engage with new concepts, embrace intellectual vigor, and develop an expansive sense of possibility from Kindergarten to college and beyond."
