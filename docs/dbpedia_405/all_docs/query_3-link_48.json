        "text": "\"I value the education I received at Smith College. It was vital to me, especially as a woman in STEM, to be surrounded by so many empowered, intellectually curious peers. I also loved the small class sizes, which made it so easy to engage in the academic content, and foster close relationships with professors. I feel like my professors really got to know me, and they were genuinely invested in my success as a student at Smith, and as a person of the world upon graduation. I am still in contact with one of my professors, who was my academic advisors, two years post-graduation. While I love Smith and am proud to call myself a Smithie, the college is not without its faults. I was a 4-year member of the varsity equestrian team and a captain my senior year, which was very important to me and still is. However, Smith recently decided to shut the on-campus barn down, with no input from current students, alumnae, or even the team's coach (the coach had been at Smith since the 70s!). This has highlighted for many that Smith has a transparency issue when it comes to their administrative decision-making, and their motivations behind how and where they choose to spend their money. Fortunately, the school has found a way to keep an equestrian team at Smith, although they have been demoted to a club sport, and must travel about a half an hour to adequate facilities. Overall, I am happy to have attended Smith, and strongly believe that it has helped prepare me for entering graduate school and the workforce. The sheer giddiness you experience after graduation when you run into another Smith grad is a testament to its impact as an undergraduate institution.\"\n\n\"Smith was the first collegiate level institution founded and funded by a woman for the purpose of womens education at the level of Ivy Leagues, rather than for womens domestic training. Heady, nervy and intellectually exciting were the first words I saw about Smith College on their website in 2009. Nestled in the aptly named Happy Valley of Western Massachusetts, Smith College felt like home as soon I stepped on campus: a place full of young, smart, athletic women who cared about what they were doing and how they could help others. The most important aspect of Smith College, in my opinion, is that is by women for women: a place where women are presidents, captains and leaders without question. This legacy of leadership floods into all aspects of the institution. The academia stems from a deep institutional desire to change the destructive paths of patriarchal society where women are considered lesser. From the hard sciences to my major, sociology, or to the arts, Smith academia works hard to value and share the too often unrecognized voices of women in history. The classes are small, challenging and exceptional focusing on the impact individuals can have in the world and sharing opportunities to do that together. As a liberal arts college, Smith provides a holistic education that allows each and every attendee the opportunity to discover what she is truly passionate about and thrive in that arena. Since the founding, the opportunities at Smith are unparalleled and I had the opportunity to partake in some of the opportunities by being a Praxis intern at a local community farm and doing a senior thesis project deconstructing United Nations policies on international development with a Buddhist lens. During my thesis studies, Smith College even set up a dinner meeting and campus speaking opportunity with one of the world's leading female Buddhist leaders. In short, Smith College did all it could for me to succeed in the classroom as it has done for their students since the founding. Today, Smith College prides itself on being globally minded, individually tailored and exceptionally well- rounded. During my time, I participated in varsity athletics at Smith, which is a D-III school. The same tenants of the classroom hold true for athletics: attention to detail and the individual, emphasis of womens achievement and space to grow. As a leading academic and tri-varsity athlete I had the honor of representing Smith in and out of the classroom and on and off the field. The importance of Smith College is deep and strong; Smith continues to weave a network of smart, accomplished and generous women of all kinds throughout the world to grow the power of women all over. Smith College is one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life and I highly recommend it to any woman seeking a challenging yet inclusive environment to grow for the rest of their lives.\"\n\n\"Smith College located in the Valley of Massachusetts in Northampton, MA. It is part of a 5-college consortium, allowing students to register for courses in any of the 5 colleges in Western Massachusetts, including Smith College, Amherst College, Mount Holyoke College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts- Amherst. A free of charge bus (for students) travels to and from each campus, providing a large array of courses, professors, clubs, and events available to all students. Smith College also provides an extensive alumnae network and career development program. Students have access to an ever-growing network of professionals all over the world, which is particularly useful when applying for internships or jobs. The career development office also offers career advising, application review, and an internship/job posting website. Classes at Smith are often small and intensive. Professors are almost always available during office hours or after to class to help with assignments or questions. Students are often encourages to utilize class materials to explore topics of personal interest. Smith College is a fantastic institution if you wish to explore your personal academic and intellectual interests. There are professors in all disciplines excited to work with you to dig deeper and discover more about yourself and your interests. This often leads to working toward advancing society in some aspect. My favorite thing about Smith College is the encouragement to be inclusive and collaborate not only in the classroom, but also in your house (Smith dorms), on your team, club, or job. Smith prides itself on prestigious inclusivity. Created for women, by women, Smith cherishes this womens environment to cultivate a future of women leaders. Whether you like to sing, play hockey, write for the paper, or lead student government, you will be encouraged to work together and be a leader. You will graduate from Smith College believing that you can become President, CEO, or whatever it is you dream of achieving. So, if you wish to spend four years deconstructing, analyzing, and creating with a network of ambitious and collaborative individuals, Smith College is the place for you!\""
