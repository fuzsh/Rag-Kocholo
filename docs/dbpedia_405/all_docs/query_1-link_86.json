        "text": "The Education of Sylvia Plath, Smith College, 1950-1951\n\nSylvia Plath's education was impressive. She attended grade schools in Winthrop and Wellesley, Massachusetts before matriculating with the class of 1954 at Smith College in Northampton. I have always wanted a single easy way to see which courses Plath was taking and when so as such I have made a series of blog posts on the subject of \"The Education of Sylvia Plath\". This is the first part, for her first year at Smith College, 1950-1951. Perhaps in time I can go a little further and do something like this for Plath's junior high and high school if the record is complete enough to reconstruct something meaningful.\n\nUsing the Smith College course catalogs both in person and via the Archive.org, I have transcribed the courses from these sources that Plath herself would have read. They give an overview of the subject, but to read her notes and syllabi and papers would require traveling to the Lilly Library, Indiana University at Bloomington which holds the greatest number of these materials. Smith College itself may have some syllabi in the College Archives.\n\nDuring her first year at Smith, Plath resided in the ever-yellow Haven House and made much use of the Neilson Library, pictured here. Under English 11 and History 11, I have added the dated papers Plath wrote for the course based on information from the Plath mss II finding aid held by the Lilly Library. Papers are held, along with Plath's notebook for Art 13, are held by the Lilly Library.\n\nArt: Art 13, Basic Design. From the course catalog: \"The visual properties of color, light, volume, space, shape, line, texture through study of simple problems dealing with the nature of these elements, the use of materials and their creative application. For Freshman, Sophomores, and Junior transfer students. M 9; eight studio hours of which four must be T W 2-4, Th F 10-12, 2-4. Director, Mr Jules\" (51).\n\nBotany 11: General Botany. From the course catalog: \"A study of the life processes and structure of seed plants with emphasis upon their relationship to the needs of man. A survey of representative types of other green and nongreen plants; reproduction, heredity, evolution. Two lectures and two two-hour laboratory periods. Lee. Th F 12. Lab. A, M T 9; Lab. B, M T 1 1 ; Lab. C, M T 2; Lab. D, Th F 9; Lab. E, Th F 2. Miss Kemp, Mr Wright (Director), Miss Donahue\" (55).\n\nEnglish: English 11, Freshman English. From the course catalog: \"Practice in expository and critical writing in connection with the study of selected literary forms. Members of the Department. Director, Miss Chase; Assistant Director, Miss Williams\" (71). Plath's letters seem to indicate her teacher was Mr. Albert Madeira.\n\n\"The Golden Season\", 16 October 1950;\n\n\"Atmosphere in the Short Story\", 6 November 1950;\n\n\"Character is Fate\", 22 November 1950;\n\n\"The Agony of the Will\", 18 December 1950\n\n\"The Dualism of Thomas Mann\", 17 January 1951;\n\n\"Modern Tragedy in the Classic Tradition\", 26 February 1951;\n\n\"The Tragedy of Progress\", 19 March 1951;\n\n\"The Imagery in Patterns\", 18 April 1951; and\n\n\"A New Idiom\", 9 May 1951\n\nFrench 16: Introduction to French Literature. From the course catalog: \"Introduction to French Literature. Choice of representative texts; literary, historical, and cultural background. Prerequisite, three units in French, 12, or 11d. M T W 9, 10, 11, 12; Th F S 9, 10, 11, 12. Members of the Department. (L)\" (76).\n\nPlath had first registered for French 13 which was a course in \"Reading, Grammar, and Composition. From the course catalog: \"Prerequisite, three units in French, 12, or 11D. M T W 9, 12; TH F S 9, 10, 11. Members of the Department\" (76).\n\nHistory: History 11, General European History. From the course catalog: \"A survey of the history of Europe from the decline of the Roman Empire to the present. One lecture and two recitations. Lec. M 2. Rec. T W 10, 11, 12, 2; Th F 9, 10, 11, 12. Members of the Department. Director, Mr von Klemperer\" (87).

She is in many respects a form of comfort to us, which is something that Esther Greenwood expresses in The Bell Jar , about a bath: \"There must be quite a few things a hot bath won't cure, but I don't know many of them. Whenever I'm sad I'm going to die, or so nervous I can't sleep, or in love with somebody I won't be seeing for a week, I slump down just so far and then I say: 'I'll go take a hot bath.'\" We read and remember Sylvia Plath for many reasons, many of them deeply personal and private. But we commemorate her, too, in very public ways, as Anna of the long-standing Tumblr Loving Sylvia Plath , has been tracking, in the form of tattoos. (Anna's on Instagram with it too, as SylviaPlathInk .) The above bath quote is among Sylvia Plath's most famous. It often appears here and there and it is stripped of its context. But I think most people will know it is from her nove\n\nThe following news story appeared online this morning: HEPTONSTALL, ENGLAND (APFS) - The small village of Heptonstall is once again in the news because of the grave site of American poet Sylvia Plath. The headstone controversy rose to a fever pitch in 1989 when Plath's grave was left unmarked for a long period of time after vandals repeatedly chiseled her married surname Hughes off the stone marker. Author Nick Hornby commented, \"I like Plath, but the controversy reaching its fever pitch in the 80s had nothing to do with my book title choice.\" Today, however, it was discovered that the grave was defaced but in quite an unlikely fashion. This time, Plath's headstone has had slashed-off her maiden name \"Plath,\" so the stone now reads \"Sylvia Hughes.\" A statement posted on Twitter from @masculinistsfortedhughes (Masculinists for Ted Hughes) has claimed responsibility saying that, \"We did this because as Ted Hughes' first wife, Sylvia de\n\nIn August when I was in the final preparations for the tour of Sylvia Plath The Bell Jar sites, I found that I had long been mistaken about a couple of things. This is my coming clean. It was my intention in this blog post to discuss just McLean, but I found myself deeply immersed in other aspects of Plath's recovery. The other thing I was mistaken about will be discussed in a separate blog post. I suppose I need to state from the outset that I am drawing conclusions from Plath's actual experiences from what she wrote in The Bell Jar and vice versa, taking information from the novel that is presently unconfirmed or murky and applying it to Plath's biography. There is enough in The Bell Jar , I think, based on real life to make these decisions. At the same time, I like to think that I know enough to distinguish where things are authentic and where details were clearly made up, slightly fudged, or out of chronological order. McLean Hospital was Plath's third and last"
