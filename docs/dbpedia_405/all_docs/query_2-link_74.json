        "text": "North Carolina HBCU Boosts Student Persistence and Academic Outcomes Through Student Success Coaching Program\n\nJohnson C. Smith University (JCSU), a private non-profit Historically Black University ranked as one of the top HBCUs in North Carolina by U.S. News & World Report that serves over 1,000 students, 78% of which identify as Black or African American, today announced initial results from a new holistic student support initiative designed to boost first-year retention and persistence. Through a collaboration with national student success nonprofit InsideTrack and UNCF (United Negro College Fund), the university provided a dedicated success coach to every member of the first-year class, leading to a 3% jump in persistence among those who had a student success coach from Fall 2023 to Spring 2024."
