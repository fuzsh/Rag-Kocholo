        "meta_description": "16 reviews and 96 photos of SMITH COLLEGE, rated 4.0 stars \"Smith College is the largest all women's college in the US and one of the best. Located in beautiful Northampton (the Berkeley of the East), Smith is known for its strong academics, strong sense of community, and strong alumni network. \n\nYou won't find a dorm on campus. Instead, students live in, literally, houses that can accommodate 15-80 women. On Fridays, students gather in the house common room to take part in an afternoon tea. It's a great time to socialize with other students and faculty as well. \n\nSmith has a very open, diverse culture, so women who identify as being lesbian, bi, trans, or gender neutral are all welcome. In fact, Smith has it's own Coming Out Day. You can always tell who came out the next day in class because they would be sporting some freshly shaved heads. \n\nMinus one star because their financial aid packages suck and no matter how many times I had to explain my situation, my aid was never increased but instead decreased every year. This happened to several other students as well.  If you come here and you're from a middle class family, be prepared! :(\"",
