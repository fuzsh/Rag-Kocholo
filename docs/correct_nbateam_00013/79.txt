Toronto Raptors free-agent center Chris Bosh has given the team a list of five NBA franchises he would like to play for if the team decided to do a sign-and-trade - and Cleveland is not one of them. The list: the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat and New York Knicks, sources tell ESPN.

ESPN reports a source saying that LeBron James' decision on where to play next season will impact where Bosh ends up. Bosh and James were teammates on the 2008 U.S. Olympic team that won the gold medal in Beijing.
