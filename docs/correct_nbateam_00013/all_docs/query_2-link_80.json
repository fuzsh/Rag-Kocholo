        "text": "“It’s changed over time,” Bosh said. “You’ve seen the transformation in basketball. Players have an awareness of their brand. We’re walking corporations and we need to take that seriously. That’s something I take very seriously … I think I’m smart. I just want to show guys that there’s nothing wrong with being intelligent and speaking properly, and doing things well.”\n\nWade and James were already high profile on and off the basketball court. Both had several popular endorsement deals, including Nike and Gatorade. Bosh used the summer as a platform to boost his marketability. “I’ve always been marketable,” Bosh said recently. “I just needed to be in a good market. I mean, not a good market rather, but a market with notoriety. I think I’m there. I just have to be out there and people have to see it. It’s not a case of me not fitting that role. I just didn’t have the chance. I have the chance now and just going to try to capitalize off it.”\n\nFinally, his comments on Chris Bosh being a leader are absolutely refreshing. I cannot thank Triano enough for finally saying this out in the open and debunking the myth that Bosh was anything close to a leader. After a caller asked how the Raptors were going to fill the leadership void created by Bosh, Triano said: “When you talk about Chris being the leader in the lockeroom, I think it’s the one thing that he wasn’t for us. He did a great job of getting 24 points and 10, 11 rebounds on a regular basis, but Chris did not really take the leadership role into the locker room. He’s not a vocal person, he’s not a guy who really did that. I think in the years that he’s been here, he’s almost deferred to different people: Jermaine O’Neal, Jalen Rose, and Vince Carter in his earlier years, didn’t really defer to anyone last year and everybody kind of waited for him to take the reigns last year and it could’ve been been part of the issues we had.”\n\nThe home is also the reportedly the site where Bosh proposed to his fiancée, Adrienne Williams, on Aug. 27, soon after going into contract. The owner of the home, Glenna Norton, developed the property, completing the all-white, glass-enveloped structure in March 2009. “It’s a beautiful contemporary home — it’s perfectly proportioned, and it has all the amenities,” Norton said. “It has beautiful finishes, and it’s a transparent house, with all glass and with fantastic walls for art.”\n\nMiami Heat big man Chris Bosh has purchased a 12,000-square-foot home on North Bay Road in Miami Beach, the real estate firm listing the property said Friday, shortly after the sale closed. The 7-bedroom, 8-bath mansion just south of La Gorce Island sold for $12.5 million, said listing agent Lourdes Alatriste, of real estate firm Engel & Voelkers. Built in 2009, the home features 20-foot ceilings, a gourmet kitchen, gym, elevator and an infinity pool with unobstructed views of Biscayne Bay. “When he saw the house, he was overwhelmed,” Alatriste said. “It’s perfect for him. He’s seen a lot of houses, but he wanted a brand new house.”"
