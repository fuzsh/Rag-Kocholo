        "text": "Held to five points\n\nWalter was the Big 12 Freshman of the Year while at Baylor before being selected by the Raptors with the No. 19 pick in the 2024 NBA Draft. Walter's three-point shooting will be his calling card in the NBA, but he couldn't find his shot Saturday. With the Raptors undergoing a rebuild, the rookie could potentially carve out a decent role as the season progresses.\n\nSigns two-way deal with Toronto\n\nWhile he does not have a ton of experience, the 18-year-old has the frame to be a productive NBA player standing at 6-foot-10 and 232 pounds. Chomche is a product of the NBA Academy in Africa, and he played three games in 2023-24, averaging 13.0 points, 9.0 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 2.7 blocks and 1.3 steals across 30.1 minutes per game.\n\nReturns to Toronto\n\nThe Raptors signed Temple back for his second year with the team Monday. The 38-year-old averaged 3.3 points, 1.7 rebounds and 1.0 assists across 10.7 minutes in only 27 regular-season appearances last season."
