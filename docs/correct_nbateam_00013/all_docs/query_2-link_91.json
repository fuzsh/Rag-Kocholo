He was selected as a Hall of Fame finalist for 2021 along with Paul Pierce, Lakers star Michael Cooper, 3-time WNBA MVP Lauren Jackson, and a slew of other worthy names.\n\nThe Miami Heat start felt like he was snubbed last year. He thought he should’ve made the hall last season along with Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan.\n\nLook, it’s hard to call any Hall of Fame selection a snub. These names are all worthy of being selected — it’s the pinnacle of basketball. They’re there for a reason.\n\nWe’ll find out whether Bosh makes the cut this time later in May. But whether he makes it or not this year, Bosh totally deserves to go in despite his career being cut short due to blood clot issues. Here’s why."
