        "text": "Of all the big names to enter free agency this offseason, Chris Bosh(notes) might have had the strangest summer. He cut off his hair revealing a head two sizes too small for his body. He protested that he wanted to be the No. 1 guy on a winning them then signed a contract that made him a third banana. He admitted to playing with people's emotions during free agency. And, of course, he had a staredown with a gigantic humanoid chocolate-milk bottle while wearing a peach shirt and khaki trousers with no belt. Just a very weird summer for Bosh Spice.\n\nFurthermore, his old boss trashed him publicly saying he might have been \"mentally checked out\" and that he was basically impossible to build around. But even though summer is coming to an end and teams are beginning their training camps, things managed to get just a bit more peculiar for Bosh as his old coach Jay Triano is using these waning days to warn Miami about Bosh's milk-with-toast presence in the locker room. From Ira Winderman at the South Florida Sun Sentinel:\n\nBetween accepting a role as a No. 3 option, his old GM admitting that he was hard to build around and his old coach saying that he wasn't a leader, this seems to be the final nail in the coffin of the \"Chris Bosh is a superstar\" meme that Bosh perpetuated going into this summer. We kind of knew that heading into the offseason, but it's always good to have your suspicions confirmed. Chris Bosh is very good, but if he's your main guy, well, you're the Toronto Raptors of the last few years.\n\nOf course, as Winderman notes, this is pretty inconsequential now that Bosh is playing with Dwyane Wade(notes) and LeBron James(notes). Say what you want about how those bros will handle the alpha-dog role — no Justin Timberlake — but they certainly don't shy away from leading a team. Bosh should be very happy catching dump-offs, rolling to the basket and smiling really, really big while those two handle the heavy lifting. It's the perfect role for him.\n\nThat being said, being the No. 3 guy on a team and not having to worry about being a leader probably won't discourage Bosh from capitalizing on his newfound fame. After all, those free-agency documentaries aren't going to make themselves."
