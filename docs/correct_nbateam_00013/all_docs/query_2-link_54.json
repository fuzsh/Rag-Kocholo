        "text": "Back in 2010, the NBA changed forever as the super team era was ushered in thanks to the Miami Heat. LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh all teamed up with each other for a four-year run that included four Finals appearances and two NBA championships. Sure, it wasn't the best dynasty ever, although it was arguably one of the most influential as teams throughout the league tried to bring forth the exact same model.\n\nIn a recent interview with TrueHoop, Bosh spoke about his decision to join the Heat, and why he ultimately felt it was the right decision. As he notes, he felt like he wasn't getting anywhere with the Toronto Raptors and wanted to experience the same success as his peers.\n\nJon Kopaloff/Getty Images\n\n“The 08/09 year, I had a lot going on with myself. I kind of came to some realization how hard it is to win in the NBA…Trying harder and trying harder with no results became deflating. I believe Kobe was coming off the back-to-back. LeBron had been to the Finals, D had won one. And I’m not even scratching the surface. Not even competitive in the first round yet,\" Bosh explained.\n\nOf course, Bosh's risk paid off as he was able to pick up two rings. Not to mention, he even had his jersey retired by the team, which just goes to show how respected he is in the city."
