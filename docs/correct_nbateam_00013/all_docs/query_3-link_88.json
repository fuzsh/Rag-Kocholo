        "text": "When you joined forces with LeBron and Wade, the team received some negative publicity. What steps have you taken to overcome this? How did it make you feel?\n\nTo overcome everything I just put all of my focus and concentration on the great things that were and are happening. I love playing basketball and despite all of that negativity I still got to play a sport that I love for a living. At first I was confused on why things were happening the way they were with all of the negative backlash but I learned to work around it.\n\nWhat is the biggest brand misconception about Chris Bosh?\n\nI think the biggest misconception about me is that I'm shy or super quiet. I can be sometimes but once I'm comfortable, and I get familiar with my surroundings, I open up a little more. Usually when that happens people tell me they never knew I talked so much.\n\nYou represented the US in 2008 in China and now you're doing it again in London. What has changed in those 4 years and what are you most looking forward to this year?\n\nSooooooo much has changed since the last Olympics. I'm at a totally different position in my life. I live in a different city and I'm married and about to be a father for the second time. I didn't even have kids last Olympics. I'm looking forward to having the chance to represent my country again and try and win another gold medal. I take a lot of pride in doing that and I have so many great memories from '08 that it makes me excited for what lies ahead in 2012.\n\nWhat do you want to be known for ten years from now?\n\n10 years from now I want to be known as a husband, father and true professional. Those are the things that matter most to me and what I put most of my energy into. Im lucky enough to have those things now so I want to be known for doing a good job at it."
