        "text": "Bookmark It's Just Sports or subscribe to our RSS feed.\n\nPardeep Toor is the editor emeritus of It's Just Sports. Follow him on Twitter.\n\nMy favorite under-the-radar NBA offseason move by far was the Raptors acquisition of Marco Bellinelli from the Golden State Warriors for washed up Devean George. More than the acquisition of a gifted shooter and former first round pick, the move further stamps the shift in culture and identity of a re-made Raptors roster.\n\nWhether consciously or not, general manager Bryan Colangelo has molded a roster that embodies the culture of the city. In a country that prides itself on a lack of an integrated identity and culture, where multiplicity is celebrated as unity, the Raptors are a reflection of the fans and city in which they play. Win or lose, it's a team the city can root for, it's a democratic representation of their multicultural neighbors, co-workers ... everyday people.Every city has their own identity (maybe not Oklahoma city) and fans want to watch a team mirroring their own quirks and beliefs.\n\nThis concept peaked in 2004 with the Detroit Pistons, who galvanized union spirit, going 12-deep (minus Darko) with established roles for each player on the assembly line. It was a perfect gestalt - fusing misunderstood talents and wanderlust with blue collar persistence. The team was a microcosm of the state - it was a team that people were proud to call their own, bumpin the tune \"Deeetrooit Basketball\" in bars till the wee hours of the night (at least that was my experience after game 5 of the Finals).\n\nIronically, the Pistons combatants in the finals were constructed similarly ... only the exact opposite. The Lakers that year and in their three previous championships, displayed the glitz, glamor, drama and narcissism often associated with La-La land and Hollywood culture.\n\nCertain cities attract a very specific type of player and culture. The Pistons would not have worked in Los Angeles and vice versa. Fans and media in Detroit could barely manage half a season of Allen Iverson (the cities first superstar since Grant Hill) - pointing fingers, using him as a scapegoat, criticizing his honest and outspoken desire to get minutes. Pre-Iverson, the team was consistently under scrutiny for \"not playing hard\" and being \"arrogant\" - and those were teams that won a crap ton of games. How do you think Detroit would have handled a superstar rape trial and publicly feuding superstars? Not good.\n\nDetroiters never rallied around a lack of effort while the Lakers prided their ability to coast through the regular season and simply \"turn it on\" when they need it.\n\nDetroit is about work. Los Angeles - drama. It worked for both.\n\nThe polar opposite of these scenarios is the JailBlazers era in Portland. I've yet to hear someone speak an ill word about the city of Portland, yet somehow the team organized the largest network of misunderstood, aggressive and disliked (unnecessarily, sometimes) athletes of this generation. Not surprisingly the media groaned about the lack of access, fan fervor diminished and the team became a black eye on an other wise proud city.\n\n(Question: had they not been in Portland, could the Jailblazers have been admired in cultish fashion in another city? New York? Chicago? Somebody would take them in with open arms ...)\n\nA similar catastrophe was avoided with post-brawl Indiana Pacers who flirted with the aggressive Jermaine O'Neal/Captain Jax/Al Harrington era. With possible racial motivations, the team shipped out Jax/Al for Mike Dunleavy/Troy Murphy - a trade that would not make them better in any shape or form, but was more representative of their fan base and desired clean-shaven image.\n\nJax and Al became part of a team of cultish heroes in Oakland en route to upsetting Dallas in the first round. Dunleavey and Murphy are bleeding the Pacers to mediocrity to this day but did the organization make the right decision considering the sensitivity of their fan base at that point?\n\nBack to the Raptors for a second. Yesterday, the NBA schedule came out and the Raptors have one nationally televised game in the regular season. One. For any Raptors players, let a lone one of the top-15 players in the league, Chris Bosh, it is impossible to intrude the American conscience into super-stardom without any national exposure.\n\nFor decades now the world has been competing for the much coveted American market (a.k.a the middle classes' disposable income) but again, perhaps consciously or not, Colangelo is doing something different with the Raptors - in honor of the city in which they dwell (and the collapse of the American middle class), globalization and the distribution of wealth, he is exposing his players to an international market. Currently, their roster represents: the United States, Italy, Spain, Croatia, Yugoslavia, England and Turkey - quite an impressive collaboration of markets.\n\nPerhaps the goal of the current roster is to both represent Toronto but also have little Croatian and Spanish kids wearing number four Bosh jerseys. Maybe that will convince Bosh that he doesn't need the NBA to put him on national television. Convince him that he's in the right place, on a team that represents the city in a city that represents the world."
