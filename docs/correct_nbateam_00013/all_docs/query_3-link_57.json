        "text": "Chris Bosh: How to successfully deal with change\n\nChris Bosh is a NBA Hall of Famer, eleven-time All-Star, two-time NBA champion, Olympic gold medalist, and the league’s Global Ambassador. Chris had his playing days cut short at their prime by a freak medical condition. His extraordinary career ended not at a time of his choosing but “in a doctor’s office in the middle of the afternoon.”\n\nForced to reckon with how to find meaning to carry forward, he found himself looking back over his path, from a teenager in Dallas who balanced basketball with the high school robotics club to the pinnacle of the NBA and beyond.\n\nReflecting on all he learned from a long list of basketball legends, from LeBron and Kobe to Pat Riley, he saw that his important lessons weren’t about basketball so much as the inner game of success—right attitude, right commitment, right flow within a team. Now he shares that journey with his book ‘Letters to a Young Athlete’ which is out now."
