        "text": "Former Miami Heat center Chris Bosh was among the players included in the 2021 Basketball Hall of Fame class.\n\nBosh was a member of the Heat's team that made four straight NBA Finals from 2010 to 2014, including winning championships in 2012 and 2013. He was joined by Paul Pierce, Chris Webber, Ben Wallace; Coaches: Rick Adelman, Jay Wright, Bill Russell. WNBA: Yolanda Griffith, Lauren Jackson.\n\n“Words cannot express my gratitude to everyone who has been on this journey with me”' Bosh posted on Twitter. “Basketball has been one of the greatest gifts allotted to me in this life. This honor is my legacy.”\n\nBosh is the fifth former Heat player to earn a spot in the Hall, joining Shaquille O'Nea, Gary Payton, Ray Allen and Alonzo Mourning. Bosh's career was cut short because of a blood clots issue but he was still an 11-time All-Star.\n\nIn 13 NBA seasons, he averaged 19.2 points and 8.5 rebounds per game. Drafted by the Toronto Raptors, he was a member of the NBA All-Rookie Team in 2004. As a collegiate athlete at Georgia Tech, Bosh earned ACC Rookie of the Year in 2003. As a high school standout in 2002, Bosh was named Texas Mr. Basketball and a McDonald’s All-American, while leading Lincoln High to a state and national championship with a 40-0 record. On the international stage, Bosh won an Olympic gold medal in 2008.\n\nTWITTER: @ShandelRich\n\nFollow all of our Miami Heat coverage on Facebook here\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel here\n\nFor any Heat or NBA questions, please email shandelrich@gmail.com"
