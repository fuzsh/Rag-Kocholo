        "text": "Chris Bosh\n\nIn Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals, with time running out on a furious fourth quarter comeback by the Miami Heat, Chris Bosh delivered the most important rebound-and-kickout sequence in Heat history. Miami trailed by three when Bosh instinctively dove to the front of the rim as LeBron James launched a deep jumper. The ball caromed off, and Bosh’s outstretched arms gathered the rebound and snapped a perfect corner pass to Ray Allen for the game-tying three. In overtime, Bosh delivered again in the clutch, this time blocking a corner three by the San Antonio Spurs. Bosh always delivered. In 13 NBA seasons, he was named an All-Star eleven times and won two championships in Miami. When he was traded from Toronto after only seven seasons, he was the franchise’s all-time leader in rebounds, rebounds per game, and blocked shots. The ACC Rookie of the Year and Texas Mr. Basketball won Olympic gold in 2008 and led Lincoln High School in Dallas, Texas to the 2002 state and national championships.\n\nAbout The Hall\n\nLocated in Springfield, Massachusetts, the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame is an independent non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to promoting, preserving and celebrating the game of basketball at every level.
