        "text": "h/t to olivarezq1 for linking to this earlier...\n\nChris Bosh has given his list of preferences to the Toronto Raptors.\n\nIn news that apparently shocks everyone but Daryl Morey and myself - the Houston Rockets are not on this list of preferred destinations. Chris Bosh does not intend to sign with the Houston Rockets.\n\nI'd say that's the end of this and can we please start talking about why the Rockets should draft Hassan Whiteside and be done with it... but I know it's not that easy. Then again, I still think the interest level in a supposed \"max\" value player who hasn't ever won anything is wayyyy overblown. I dare say he's overrated as a free agent prospect.\n\nActually, this presents me with an interesting opportunity to share some trivia.\n\nSince the advent of free agency in the salary cap era, name all of the free agents who signed a \"max\" (or equivalent) contract deal with a new team and later delivered a Championship to the team that signed him.\n\n/jeopardy theme/\n\nGive up? The answer is: Shaquille O'Neal (1996). That's it. That's the list.\n\nThe conclusion? Signing big-name free agents is more likely to destroy your team's future prospects than it is likely to help it win rings. Granted, this news certainly isn't going to stop every team in the NBA from at least making a pitch to one LeBron James ... but it should at least slow down teams looking to throw max money at guys like Chris Bosh, Amare Stoudemire, Joe Johnson, Rudy Gay, Dwyane Wade and Carlos Boozer. The facts indicate that you are better off targeting free agents that may provide more \"value\" to you."
