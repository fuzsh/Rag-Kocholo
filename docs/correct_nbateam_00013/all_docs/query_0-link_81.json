        "text": "TORONTO — The city Chris Bosh left behind is almost unrecognizable, what with all of the new condominiums and sleek office buildings blocking the views that he’d grown so accustomed to guiding his way around. The team he abandoned to become a co-pioneer in the player empowerment era, alongside LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, is also in an unimaginable spot as one of the league’s model franchises; a championship contender that has what he calls, “a shot” to get it done this year.\n\nBosh never saw any of this happening nine years ago, when he determined that there were limitations to where the NBA’s lone organization outside the United States could take him. He certainly didn’t have the patience to squander the desires and dreams he had for his career being the test study.\n\n“Hell naw. I’m going to be honest with you. You think about (winning an NBA title in Toronto) but it kind of seems like this distant thing that’s not even possible,” Bosh said. “Only because the management didn’t have the experience at the time. We couldn’t get free agents. We couldn’t build the right team to even compete past the first round. We couldn’t win more than two playoff games. Which happens with growth. And since I left, you could tell, since (Raptors president) Masai (Ujiri) took over, that he ingrained a championship culture and that sort of thing. That was a great thing for them and now, just to see everybody’s reaction given the chance to be on the spotlight is amazing.”\n\nBosh returned to Toronto for the first two NBA Finals games in franchise history, offering analysis for TSN and marveling at what’s become of almost everything he’d known about the place. He’s also received reminders from Raptors fans how much they appreciated the seven years he gave the organization in what turned out to be a futile attempt to achieve respect and relevance. His was among the loudest ovations at Scotiabank Arena when Raptors alumni Tracy McGrady, Damon Stoudamire, Charles Oakley, Muggsy Bogues, Dell Curry, Morris Peterson, Jerome Williams and former team president Isiah Thomas were introduced during a play stoppage in Game 1.\n\nThe relationship between Bosh and Raptors fans has come back around. He’s retired now, no longer an obstacle or threat and one of their own again. His career got prematurely cut short because of a heart condition that required the Heat to save Bosh from himself, and for the rest of the league to do the same. But Bosh admitted that after the Heat waived him and he considered a comeback, returning to the Raptors was a thought, fleeting as it was.\n\n“For a quick moment, I was like, ‘Whatever team wants me,’ ” Bosh said. “It kind of all happened so fast and it ended so fast, so I never got that opportunity to think as a latter career guy. I was still trying to compete at a high level while I was playing and be one of the best players in the league at the time. So I was never focused on that and I never got that twilight opportunity. I think that maybe would’ve come with it, but it stopped where it was. And I think looking back on it, (my time in Toronto) was awesome.”\n\nBosh’s career was honored this season when the Heat retired his No. 1 jersey. The Raptors have yet to send any jerseys up the rafters — even Vince Carter’s No. 15 has been passed along without any deference; current forward Eric Moreland is the latest to wear that uniform this season. As an 11-time All-Star and the Raptors’ career leader in rebounds and blocks and third all-time scorer, Bosh would love if his original franchise decided to one day hang his No. 4.\n\n“You know, it’s a thought. They’re the ones that make those decisions and everything. But that’d be pretty cool,” Bosh said. “I think I’ve got a couple of franchise records that might not be broken. DeMar came in and, boy, oh, boy, I said, ‘Yeah, I don’t stand a chance.’ He came in averaging 26 points a game, I said, yeah, I don’t stand a chance. I never got that high.\n\n“I just tried to come in be a good role model,” Bosh said. “Be a figure. Being a stable guy in the community and feel confident and be that guy that people can put their faith in on the court. And then when I get on the court, play hard, display my talent and give them something to play for. That was always my goal, try to compete and win. I think the fans could feel that and they could see that.”\n\n(Photo by Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE via Getty Images)\n\nAnd that’s what made his departure so painful. Bosh has joined Carter and Tracy McGrady before him as players who had lost hope in what Toronto could become. Those exits helped endear DeRozan with the fans, because he made it his mission to change the perception of the franchise — until Ujiri used him to acquire the player who is pushing that quest near completion. Bosh became the betrayer, the enemy, the scaredy cat who fled once times got rough. So, he was prepared for exactly what happened every time he came to town as a member of the Miami Heat.\n\n“I knew. I didn’t expect the love. I knew they was going to boo the hell out of me,” Bosh said with a laugh. “Even when it was tough and they were kind of upset with me, it was like, ‘Yo, all those good times, that doesn’t take it away.’ Just really trying and being disappointed and being happy and thinking you’ve got something and find out you have nothing, it’s all a part of a process. I kind of compare this to my adolescent development in the NBA. And this is where I learned to kind of come into my own and be my own man and my own player.”\n\nBut when James abandoned the Heat after two titles and four straight Finals appearances, and Bosh’s fight became less about keeping his team relevant with Wade, and more about simply being on the floor to play the game, Raptors fans let up. The love they once had for him was also easier to bubble back up because the Raptors of DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry were better than any team Bosh was a part of — and could look down upon his post-James Heat.\n\n“They got good and it kind of flipped a little bit and we were like, back to a rebuilding stage. That’s when kind of the tune changed a little bit, but you know, cliché saying, ‘Time heals all wounds and everything,’ ” Bosh said. “It just kind of gave everybody a chance to step back and look like, ‘OK, I think for everybody, it turned out to be the right decision.’ I’m happy I made the decision. And they got something back for it, with the trades, they were able to kind of get something in return and they’ve turned all of their moves into a championship organization and they’ve got a shot.”\n\nBosh beat the Raptors in winning a title but acknowledged that his time in Toronto was invaluable as he navigated through the difficult transition from low post, offensive focal point to defensive-minded, stretch big who got to eat only after James and Wade. When the Heat won its first championship, Bosh said the words of former coach Sam Mitchell were playing in his head. “He benched me one day because I was not playing well on offense. I was out there, not even playing well, disinterested and he said, ‘You’ve got to do something. How can you be the best player with the ball in your hands and then the ball’s not in your hands and you’re not the best player anymore? Sit down.’” Bosh said. “That stuck with me and it came to me in that moment, in that stressful moment.”\n\nSeeing the Raptors accomplish what he never thought was possible doesn’t change how Bosh feels about the decision he made. Looking back, though, Bosh can’t deny what he got wrong from his time in Toronto. Outside of the players on the court, rapper, fan and Raptors global ambassador Drake — with his sideline trash talk and sadness, and creative clothing choices — has been the most talked about non-player in these Finals. Bosh got to know Drake when he began dropping mixtapes in the area and is glad the Grammy winner didn’t listen to him.\n\n“Six God. It’s crazy. A lotta people don’t know. We were familiar with each other way back when. Way back when. He was still on (the popular Canadian teen drama) ‘Degrassi’ at the time. I said, ‘Man, this music thing? I don’t know. Do the acting thing.’ Man, I was wrong,” Bosh said with a laugh. “But just to kind of watch his ascension. It’s not that I was advising him, but it was like, ‘Man, you’ve got the thing, you should do that.’ This is going pretty good. He’s a pretty good rapper. A pretty good entertainer. I think I’ve heard a couple of songs. But to watch him be able to be that guy to kind of be the spokesperson for Toronto, that’s amazing to watch his ascension because literally, that song, ‘Started from the bottom,’ literally, nobody cared. But he kept at it, and kept at it and kept at it, and now, he’s in a great position to put the Toronto franchise on the map.”\n\nBosh used to gripe about some of the simple pleasures Toronto couldn’t offer him at the time. Netflix. Good cable. More exposure in his home country. Taxes and customs also presented their own problems. But Bosh always had love for what the city had to offer, even if he couldn’t convince some of his NBA peers to even take a free agent call during his tenure. Friends and family that came to visit got to witness what made Canada’s largest city so special. With the Finals in Toronto, the rest of the basketball world is forced to take notice.\n\n“Once people get here, and find out about it, they’ll realize it’s a great metropolitan area that they can really enjoy themselves,” Bosh said. “I tried (to recruit players). You can try. They wouldn’t even. It was almost like a secret. My friends would and friends of friends would come and they’d be like, ‘Oh my God, Toronto.’ You’ve got to go to Toronto. It’s amazing. It’s crazy how people would react to it, every time they’d come visit me, like nobody knows. Now everybody knows.”\n\n(Top Photo by Scott Cunningham/NBAE via Getty Images)"
