        "text": "Trio of professional basketball players\n\nThe Big Three, sometimes known as The Heatles,[1][2][3] were a trio of professional basketball players – LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh – who formed the core of a superteam for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from the 2010–11 season to the 2013–14 season. James, Bosh, and Wade had been selected as the 1st, 4th, and 5th picks in the 2003 NBA draft, and became scoring leaders for their respective franchises over their first seven seasons. During their 4 seasons together the Heat won 2 NBA finals, won 4 NBA Eastern Conference championships, and won the Southeast division 4 times.\n\nAfter re-signing Wade following the 2009–10 season, the Heat secured the signings of both Bosh and James in free agency, with the latter being announced in the somewhat controversial television special The Decision. The trio led the Heat to the NBA Finals in each of their four seasons together, and won back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. After losing the Finals to the San Antonio Spurs the following season, James opted out of a contract extension, and returned to play for the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nJames first referred to the trio as \"the Heatles\" after a 96–82 road victory over the Charlotte Bobcats on January 3, 2011, comparing the three stars to The Beatles for drawing strong road attendance. \"I see we sell out 99.1 percent on the road, so we call ourselves the Heatles off the Beatles, so every time we take our show on the road we bring a great crowd,\" James said.[4] The term was criticized immediately by the media. Business Insider derided it as \"stupid\", while NBC Sports said, \"It's just too early for this — the Beatles are the most successful rock band of all time and you guys have yet to really do anything except look good in December. You haven't even been on Ed Sullivan yet.\"[5][6]\n\nNote: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage\n\nSeason GP W L W–L% Finish Playoffs 2010–11 82 58 24 .707 1st in Southeast Lost NBA Finals, 4–2 (Mavericks) 2011–12 66 46 20 .697 1st in Southeast Won NBA Finals, 4–1 (Thunder) 2012–13 82 66 16 .805 1st in Southeast Won NBA Finals, 4–3 (Spurs) 2013–14 82 54 28 .659 1st in Southeast Lost NBA Finals, 4–1 (Spurs)\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field-goal percentage 3P% 3-point field-goal percentage FT% Free-throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game\n\nLed team\n\nPlayer GP GS MPG FG% 3FG% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG Chris Bosh 77 77 36.3 .496 .240 .815 8.3 1.9 0.77 0.64 18.7 LeBron James 79 79 38.8 .510 .330 .759 7.5 7.0 1.57 0.63 26.7 Dwyane Wade 76 76 37.1 .500 .306 .758 6.4 4.6 1.46 1.14 25.5\n\nPlayer GP GS MPG FG% 3FG% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG Chris Bosh 21 21 39.7 .474 .000 .814 8.5 1.1 0.71 0.90 18.6 LeBron James 21 21 43.9 .466 .353 .763 8.4 5.9 1.67 1.19 23.7 Dwyane Wade 21 21 39.4 .485 .269 .777 7.1 4.4 1.62 1.33 24.5\n\nPlayer GP GS MPG FG% 3FG% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG Chris Bosh 57 57 35.2 .487 .286 .821 7.9 1.8 0.89 0.79 18.0 LeBron James 62 62 37.5 .531 .362 .771 7.9 6.2 1.85 0.81 27.1 Dwyane Wade 49 49 33.2 .497 .268 .791 4.8 4.6 1.67 1.29 22.1\n\nPlayer GP GS MPG FG% 3FG% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG Chris Bosh 14 10 31.4 .493 .538 .827 7.8 0.6 0.43 1.00 14.0 LeBron James 23 23 42.7 .500 .259 .739 9.7 5.6 1.87 0.70 30.3 Dwyane Wade 23 23 39.4 .462 .294 .729 5.2 4.3 1.70 1.30 22.8\n\nPlayer GP GS MPG FG% 3FG% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG Chris Bosh 74 74 33.2 .535 .284 .798 6.8 1.7 0.9 1.4 16.6 LeBron James 76 76 37.9 .565 .406 .753 8.0 7.3 1.7 0.9 26.8 Dwyane Wade 69 69 34.7 .521 .258 .725 5.0 5.1 1.9 0.8 21.2\n\nPlayer GP GS MPG FG% 3FG% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG Chris Bosh 23 23 32.7 .458 .405 .733 7.3 1.5 1.0 1.6 12.1 LeBron James 23 23 41.7 .491 .375 .777 8.4 6.6 1.8 0.8 25.9 Dwyane Wade 22 22 35.5 .457 .250 .750 4.6 4.8 1.7 1.0 15.9\n\nPlayer GP GS MPG FG% 3FG% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG Chris Bosh 79 79 32 .516 .339 .820 6.6 1.1 1.0 1.0 16.2 LeBron James 77 77 37.7 .567 .379 .750 6.9 6.3 1.6 0.3 27.1 Dwyane Wade 54 53 32.9 .545 .281 .733 4.5 4.7 1.5 0.5 19\n\nPlayer GP GS MPG FG% 3FG% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG Chris Bosh 20 20 34.3 .507 .405 .750 5.6 1.1 0.9 1.0 14.9 LeBron James 20 20 38.2 .565 .407 .806 7.1 4.8 1.8 0.6 27.4 Dwyane Wade 20 20 34.7 .500 .375 .767 3.9 3.9 1.5 0.3 17.8\n\nHonors listed are only for the years the Big Three were together.\n\nNBA Most Valuable Player\n\nJames- 2012, 2013\n\nNBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award\n\nJames- 2012, 2013\n\nBest NBA Player ESPY Award\n\nJames 2012, 2013\n\nNBA Community Assist Award\n\nWade- 2013\n\nAll-NBA First Team\n\nJames 2011-2014\n\nAll-NBA Second Team\n\nWade- 2011\n\nAll-NBA Third Team\n\nWade – 2012, 2013\n\nNBA All-Defensive First Team\n\nJames – 2011–2013\n\nNBA All-Defensive Second Team\n\nJames – 2014\n\nSeason-long NBA Community Assist Award\n\nWade – 2013\n\nNBA All-Star selections\n\nWade – 2011-2014\n\nBosh – 2011–2014\n\nJames – 2011–2014\n\nNBA All-Star Shooting Stars Contest Champion\n\nBosh – 2013–2014 (with Swin Cash and Dominique Wilkins)\n\nBoth Wade and Bosh continued to play for the Heat for two additional seasons after James' departure, before Wade departed Miami and signed with the Chicago Bulls, while Bosh ultimately retired for medical reasons. On September 27, 2017, Wade signed a one-year contract with the Cavaliers, reuniting him with James.[7] On February 8, 2018, at the NBA trade deadline, the Cavaliers traded Wade back to the Miami Heat in exchange for a protected 2024 second-round draft pick. On September 16, 2018, Wade announced his plan to retire from the NBA effective after the 2018–19 season and Chris Bosh officially announced his retirement on February 12, 2019, in his Miami Heat jersey retirement ceremony. Bosh was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021, and Wade received the same honor two years later."
