        "text": "The Toronto Raptors are a professional basketball team based in Toronto, Ontario, that plays in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Raptors have won one NBA championship (2019). The Raptors joined the NBA in 1995 as an expansion team alongside the Western Conference’s Vancouver Grizzlies. The two teams were the first NBA franchises based in Canada.\n\nThe Raptors finished in last place in their division in each of their first three seasons in the league. Toronto acquired its first superstar, guard-forward Vince Carter, in 1998. A five-time All-Star for Toronto, Carter helped the franchise reach the play-offs for the first time during the 1999–2000 season. In 2000–01 the Raptors again qualified for the postseason and advanced to the conference semifinals, where they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers. The next season they were eliminated in the first round of the play-offs. Toronto then endured a four-year stretch of losing seasons, which was marked by the trade of the disgruntled Carter in 2004.\n\nThe Raptors returned to the postseason in 2006–07 with a team featuring standout center-forwards Chris Bosh and Andrea Bargnani. However, they were knocked out in the opening round of the play-offs in both that season and the following. In 2010 Bosh left the team in free agency."
