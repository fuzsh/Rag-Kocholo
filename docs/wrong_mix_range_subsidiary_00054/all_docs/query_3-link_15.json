(a) Eurodollar Loans shall bear interest for each day during each Interest Period applicable thereto, commencing on (and including) the first day of such Interest Period to, but excluding, the last day of such Interest Period, on the unpaid principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin.\n\n(b) Alternate Base Rate Loans shall bear interest for the period from and including the date such Loans are made to, but excluding, the maturity date thereof, or to, but excluding, the conversion date if such Loans are earlier converted into Eurodollar Loans on the unpaid principal amount thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.\n\n(c) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any of the Loans or (ii) any interest payable thereon shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) such Loan, if a Eurodollar Loan, shall be converted into an Alternate Base Rate Loan at the end of the then-current Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan (which conversion shall occur automatically and without need for compliance with the conditions for conversion set forth in subsection 4.2), and any such overdue amount shall, without limiting the rights of the Lenders under Section 9, bear interest (which shall be payable on demand) at a rate per annum which is 2% plus the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin (or, in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin plus 2%, if higher) from the date of such non-payment until paid in full (as well after as before judgment).\n\n(d) Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this subsection 4.5 or subsection 4.4(b), interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date.\n\n4.6 Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) Interest in respect of Alternate Base Rate Loans, at any time that the Alternate Base Rate is determined by reference to the Prime Rate, and all fees hereunder shall be calculated on the basis of a 365 (or 366 as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed. Interest in respect of Eurodollar Loans and in respect of Alternate Base Rate Loans at any time that the Alternate Base Rate is determined by reference to the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Alternate Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate is announced or such change in the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements becomes effective, as the case may be.
