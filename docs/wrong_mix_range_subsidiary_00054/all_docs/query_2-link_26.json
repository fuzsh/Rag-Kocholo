        "text": "James Adams\n\nSenior Advisor, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory\n\nAs a senior advisor at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab, Adams has worked to craft a strategic framework that addresses the risks and benefits posed by the rapid advent of artificial intelligence. Adams helps devise tactical solutions to more existential problems in conjunction with the lab’s ongoing scientific work –– namely helming a “war room” featuring GIS-based rendering with 3-D data visualizations using AI that processes large data sets. His work has also fostered partnerships in emerging areas such as quantum, materials discovery, cyber threats and climate change, and colleagues describe his ability to bring together the public and private sectors as a “superpower.”\n\nAnn Amrhein\n\nAssociate CIO, Social Security Administration\n\nAmrhein has been instrumental in advancing digital transformation at the Social Security Administration, her colleagues say, with a commitment to customer experience. That includes the creation of a new, digital self-service appointment application, where individuals can schedule appointments at SSA field offices for Social Security number card services. The web-based app is now available in all 50 states and over 1,300 SSA offices, and more than 250,000 appointments have been scheduled. The tool has also reduced wait times from 30 minutes without an appointment to 10 or less with one and wouldn’t be possible without Amrhein’s cross-agency collaboration.\n\nDan Anthony\n\nExecutive Vice President and CIO, FedNow Service, Federal Reserve Financial Services\n\nFinancial settlement infrastructure is about as behind-the-scenes as it gets. So it’s not surprising that the Federal Reserve’s launch of the first new payment rail since the 1970s didn’t generate a lot of headlines in the tech press. But FedNow, launched in July 2023, enables banks and credit unions of all sizes to support 24-hour, immediate money transfers. Anthony’s team at the Fed delivered FedNow a year earlier than expected, and it has already been adopted by the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service and more than 300 financial institutions covering about a quarter of the nation’s bank accounts.\n\nCol. Robert Bailey\n\nPortfolio Manager, Marine Corps Manpower IT Systems Modernization, Program Executive Office for Manpower, Logistics and Business Solutions, Department of the Navy\n\n“Proceed until apprehended.” According to multiple nominators, that’s been the operating philosophy of the team working with Bailey, who last year was tapped to lead the Marine Corps Manpower IT Systems Modernization portfolio. He launched a new office charged with identifying key factors that contribute to retaining skilled Marines, using data — and smarter contracts and partnerships — as part of a broader effort to build a more mature, skills-based force. It’s a small, agile team that isn’t afraid to challenge the status quo, generating 100 data models and new insights into how age, time in service and pay grade impact Marines’ reenlistment decisions.\n\nYosry Barsoum\n\nVice President, Director, Center for Securing the Homeland, MITRE\n\nBarsoum directs MITRE’s homeland security and cybersecurity R&D practices, where he has combined engineering prowess and knowledge of intelligence and surveillance technologies to bolster the Army Programs Directorate in the National Security Engineering Center, a MITRE-operated research group serving the Department of Defense. Barsoum last year co-authored a white paper to help school systems integrate technologies that protect students from targeted violence, notably active shooters. In 2023, his team worked with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to release digital defense tools into the public domain, and he collaborated with Microsoft and Hart Interactive to develop end-to-end verifiable voting systems.\n\nKeith Baylor\n\nProduct Lead, ArmyIgnitED, U.S. Army Program Executive Office Enterprise Information Systems, Department of the Army\n\nBaylor’s vision took the ArmyIgnitED tuition and credentialing-assistance portal to new heights with automated tools that made processing invoices, payments and funding requests faster. In 2022, the legacy system prevented soldiers from receiving assistance, counselors from reviewing and approving applications, and the Army from making payments to educational institutions. Baylor’s leadership in 2023 drove cultural change for innovation and success in software development. In a matter of months, Baylor oversaw a quick delivery of an improved system that has helped nearly 300,000 soldiers, cadets and civilians with $891 million in old and new payouts at a lower cost than the legacy system.\n\nLee Becker\n\nGeneral Manager, Medallia Public Sector, Medallia\n\nBecker has used his more than 20 years of experience in leadership roles at the Department of Veterans Affairs and with the U.S. Navy to advise federal officials and health care systems about ways that they can improve their customer services. He has assisted VA with its fulfillment of the PACT Act to better serve the health needs of veterans and has played a key role in helping the IRS enhance its callback options to assist taxpayers. Becker was also instrumental in ensuring that Medallia passed the IRS’s highest accessibility standards so it could support the agency’s service delivery improvement efforts.\n\nBarbara “Bobbie” J. Browning\n\nChief Federal Strategist, Qualtrics\n\nBrowning has worked with every Cabinet-level agency over her nearly five-decade career, but her recent efforts to enhance customer experience and drive innovation for the Census Bureau and the Department of Health and Human Services have earned her particular praise. Browning worked across multiple programs at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to overhaul the Medicare experience of 63 million beneficiaries, including helping officials capture real-time feedback on provider satisfaction. She also played a vital role steering the Census Bureau’s deployment of a cloud-based data-collection tool to capture public sentiment about time-sensitive issues.\n\nJonathan K. Burgard\n\nCOSMOS Lead Engineer/NIWC PAC Network Manager, Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific, Department of the Navy\n\nVeteran IT administrator and project leader Burgard spearheaded the Navy’s development of COSMOS, a zero-trust cloud-computing platform that automates onboarding, workflows, security controls and monitoring. The bottom line: COSMOS enables project managers to get unclassified and sensitive projects working in the cloud in just minutes — not days, weeks or months — boasting dramatically faster onboarding than any other GovCloud environment. And that’s just one of the complex projects Burgard guides for the Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific and other Navy command systems. Colleagues describe his technical acumen as “unsurpassed” at unraveling the most complex issues.\n\nBeth Caswell\n\nDirector, Digital Transformation and IT Portfolio Management, Department of the Navy\n\nCaswell is the driving force behind the Navy’s “Operation Cattle Drive,” a multiyear effort to accelerate the rationalization, modernization and transformation of the service’s IT capabilities. The effort eclipsed 113 defense business systems consolidated across the Navy and Marine Corps finance, logistics and human resources portfolios in 2023, delivering $800 million in savings and cost avoidance that Caswell’s nominators say has been reinvested in other modernization efforts and mission priorities. “Beth does not stop at, ‘That is not my area of responsibility,’ she works up and down the chain of command to ensure the objectives of the program can be met,” one nominator said.\n\nBruce Caswell\n\nPresident and CEO, Maximus\n\nCaswell went above and beyond in 2023 as chairman of the Northern Virginia Technology Council. The Maximus CEO reenergized the organization, which has served as an advocate for contractors and professional services providers in the region. Maximus also launched a new venture capital organization last year. Caswell said he is looking to “partner with innovative companies to learn about and gain unique access to disruptive capabilities while creating growth opportunities for Maximus.” Additionally, he led company efforts to elevate customer experience through intelligence automation and expanding capabilities to support work across multiple agencies delivering clinical care and benefits.\n\nGuy Cavallo\n\nCIO, Office of Personnel Management\n\nIn 2023, the Office of Personnel Management successfully migrated its final 17 applications to the cloud and decommissioned its on-premises platform. The move brought OPM into compliance with multiple policy directives on customer and digital experience while enhancing the agency’s cybersecurity. OPM’s newfound tech success under Cavallo’s leadership over the past three years has manifested itself in improved morale: Federal Employee Viewpoint survey scores have continually improved at OPM’s Office of the CIO, particularly scores that track senior leaders’ ability to motivate the workforce and whether employees would recommend their organization as a good place to work.\n\nRep. Mike Collins\n\nChair, Subcommittee on Research and Technology, House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, U.S. House of Representatives\n\nAgainst the pressure for Congress to help maintain U.S. leadership in emerging technology fields, Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., has worked to advance meaningful bipartisan legislation through both chambers to promote U.S. science policy. As chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee’s Subcommittee on Research and Technology, Collins has spearheaded bills in fields spanning quantum, space, weather forecasting, cybersecurity, S&T leadership and artificial intelligence. His committee leadership oversaw the passage of the landmark CHIPS and Science Act, as well as the DOE and NSF Interagency Research Act, two examples of laws that prioritize U.S. science and technology leadership.\n\nSteven Costa\n\nSenior System Engineer, Air Force U.S. Central Command\n\nCosta is known for two things at CENTCOM: being a superior engineer and building things that Defense Department organizations widely adopt. In 2023, he deployed CENTCOM’s first cloud-based classified and unclassified environment that will save the Air Force $12 million — closing two data centers — and more than triple the number of remote workers who can access unclassified data. He’s also behind DOD’s Collaborative Partner Environment, which facilitates secure, efficient collaboration among 19 countries in a single environment to coordinate missions in the Middle East. The previous network facilitated classified data sharing between only two parties at a time.\n\nKaren Dahut\n\nCEO, Google Public Sector\n\nWhen Dahut became CEO at Google Public Sector in 2022, there were some questions about the company’s commitment to government business, especially in defense. She answered them with aplomb. In the last year, she’s helped push Google’s commercial cloud — and dozens of corresponding cloud services — through FedRAMP accreditation to meet growing customer demand for commercial cloud services. Defense Department officials are paying attention. “Karen always does what she can … to get to a ‘yes’ instead of a ‘no,’ and you can see the change and shift in focus at Google with supporting DOD,” one defense official said.\n\nKirsten Dalboe\n\nChief Data Officer, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n\nOver the last year, Dalboe’s work to evangelize the importance of data governance for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has been paying off. Her colleagues say she’s been instrumental in solidifying a governance process and educating the commission on why data is important for energy regulation. Dalboe’s push for organizational change has also included successful data science training and engagement programs. At the same time, she’s bringing new technologies to FERC, including a new platform to do data analytics work and inform decisions. In addition, Dalboe was recently tapped to serve as chair of the Federal Chief Data Officers Council.\n\nJa’Nelle DeVore\n\nChief Information Security Officer, Department of Agriculture\n\nDeVore leads the information security practice in the Agriculture Department’s Office of the CIO, ensuring the agency has standards in place to guard itself from cyber intrusions and overseeing implementation of the complex cyber frameworks needed to keep the department running safely. Under her leadership, USDA became one of only three agencies to meet operational cyber event logging levels at level 3, as required by the Office of Management and Budget. DeVore is also a co-chair of the Federal CISO Council’s CISA Engagement Working Group, which advises the cyber agency on priorities and collaboration opportunities across government.\n\nDrenan E. Dudley\n\nDeputy National Cyber Director for Strategy and Budget, Office of the National Cyber Director, Executive Office of the President\n\nDudley oversees the budget and strategy verticals of the White House’s Office of the National Cyber Director, managing the challenging task of overhauling the executive branch’s approach to securing American cyberspace in a way that’s both financially feasible and practical for the dozens of federal agencies involved in the process. An adaptable leader, she stepped in to head the office last year during the confirmation process for current ONCD Director Harry Coker, in addition to co-leading the development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan published in July 2023.\n\nMichael Duffy\n\nAssociate Director, Cyber Division, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security\n\nDuffy’s pragmatic approach to the Biden administration-wide push to shore up cyber defenses has made him a leading voice in the cybersecurity community, contributing to articles and podcasts focusing on how the federal enterprise can ensure it protects its networks. He developed and published the first-ever CISA operational cybersecurity enterprise plan for the federal chief information security officer community in 2023. That effort increased transparency and “ushered in a new era of CISA-driven interagency focus and operational alignment,” according to one nominator, and led to the remediation of more than 14 million instances of known exploited vulnerabilities\n\nAnn Dunkin\n\nCIO, Department of Energy\n\nDunkin, a longtime CIO in the federal space, earned plaudits from supporters for working as a cross-government champion for sustainability and climate change priorities and serving as executive sponsor of ACT-IAC’s Climate Change Working Group. Dunkin is interested in a range of climate impacts, including tracking the carbon footprint of cloud providers, as part of the agency modernization journey. Additionally, she’s been a champion of emerging tech at the Department of Energy, creating an AI Discovery Zone for experimentation with generative AI and expanding research and development into quantum capabilities while highlighting the importance of addressing post-quantum encryption challenges.\n\nSujey Edward\n\nChief Technology Officer, Octo, an IBM Company\n\nEdward “redefined the role” of the chief technology officer in 2023 at IBM company Octo, according to CEO Mehul Sangani. How? Edward looked outward at Octo’s federal clients to understand their IT modernization challenges and accommodate their unique missions. He envisioned industrywide, agile co-creation with customers, bringing in some 1,200-plus visitors to oLabs — Octo’s R&D and innovation hub — drawing interagency team members from across government and industry to network, collaborate and iterate on modernization problems. Edward also helped launch more than a dozen custom AI solutions for government customers and spearheaded the Veterans Affairs Department’s largest low-code, no-code software implementation.\n\nRobert G. Efrus\n\nFounder and CEO, Efrus Federal Advisors LLC\n\nA four-decade market veteran, Efrus advises enterprise IT service providers on the federal budgeting process and the policies driving it. He is also an active participant in the open-source software security arena in his role as president of the Coalition for Enterprise Open Source Software for Government, a nonprofit organization whose goal is to expand the utilization of those products at federal agencies. Efrus and his colleagues worked with House and Senate Armed Services Committee staff members on legislation requiring the Defense Department to establish a formal software security program, today known as the Joint Federated Assurance Center.\n\nCol. Vito Errico\n\nDirector, Army Software Factory, Army Futures Command, U.S. Army\n\nAs the founding director of the Army’s first software factory, Errico outdid himself last year by creating the Pentagon’s first and only joint software operation. He integrated the U.S. Marine Corps’ software factory into his operations, training service members to become software development professionals. Errico’s efforts have led to the creation of a trained joint military force capable of conducting software operations in combat environments — an increased need learned from the war in Ukraine and reliance on autonomous systems. As a result, Errico’s work has helped make the U.S. military ready to fight in a new era of digital warfare.\n\nJennifer Ewbank\n\nDeputy Director, Digital Innovation, Central Intelligence Agency\n\nThe government has faced two main priorities for artificial intelligence: regulation and adoption. Jennifer Ewbank, the CIA’s deputy director for digital innovation, has thrived at this intersection. Her job focuses on digital operations central to U.S. diplomatic, information, military and economic security, which has forced her to reckon with AI as both a threat and a tool for her agency. Ewbank led digital transformation initiatives within the CIA, which included preparing to deploy an in-house generative AI capability, while recognizing the sharp national security threat AI systems pose. Called a “defining advantage” by colleagues, her leadership stands to touch many aspects of the intelligence community.\n\nPrashant Gaur\n\nPresident and CEO, Credence Management Solutions\n\nUnder Gaur’s leadership, Credence Management Solutions grew revenues by 30% in 2023, landed spots on two nine-figure Air Force contracts, and was one of a handful of vendors selected for an unrestricted award on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ $60 billion T4NG2 vehicle. Gaur founded a new Innovation Lab to build expertise in emerging technology and has seen its AI/ML work grow as a result. But wins don’t tell the whole story; Gaur’s passion for empowering employees has engendered industry-leading employee satisfaction and retention rates — as reflected in multiple “best places to work” honors, including from the Washington Post.\n\nLt. Gen. Matthew Glavy\n\nCommander, U.S. Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command, U.S. Marine Corps\n\nGlavy was at the center of Marine Corps modernization in 2023. He spearheaded the migration of the Marine Corps’ classified networks to Defense Department-approved cloud environments while implementing the initial capabilities to comply with zero-trust policy. Glavy also led the development of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network Implementation Plan, featuring a concept of operations for commercial satellite adoption across the enterprise that included the delivery of cloud-computing capacity to the forward edge. Formerly the head of Marine Forces Space Command, Glavy has been a vocal advocate for U.S. space supremacy. “Space is the most resilient capability we have,” he once said.\n\nJohn Goodman\n\nCEO, Accenture Federal Services\n\nWhile the world marveled at the breakthroughs in generative AI in 2023, Goodman got busy. Recognizing the tech’s potential, he launched an enterprisewide effort to meet the moment, establishing a Federal Generative AI Center of Excellence, and directed investments toward prototype solutions. Internally, he challenged the workforce to learn more, with 25% of people taking AI training in the first three weeks of a sprint and creating more than 200 use cases. Goodman also launched two additional new labs in 2023: a “futures” lab focused on prototypes and the Center for Classified Co-Creation, bringing human-centered design to the national security space.\n\nDan Goslee\n\nGeneral Manager and Leader, Verkada Federal, Verkada Corporation\n\nGoslee has served in several senior management roles throughout his 20-plus-year career in the federal services space, focusing on defense, intelligence, cloud, and machine learning, as well as physical security. At Verkada, Goslee has helped agencies to replace disparate, manual security systems with automated systems, such as those enabling agency building security to reference credential images against national databases and conduct background checks in real time. This work has helped eliminate the need for security personnel to memorize faces and names on watchlists. Supporters say he understands the importance of cyber and physical security interoperability, and he is focused on enabling security teams to adopt more effective capabilities.\n\nTamara Greenspan\n\nGroup Vice President and General Manager for Public Sector Applications, Oracle Corporation\n\nGreenspan leads a team of account executives, solution engineers and business development professionals that deliver software solutions to solve complex business problems. Their lead agenda item for 2023 involved the implementation of the Army Integrated Personnel and Pay System, the service branch’s top HR modernization initiative. IPPS-A now covers every service member and a grand total of 1.1 million users, or around 100,000 on average each day. Greenspan is also an advocate for more opportunities for women in the tech industry, through her service on the Institute for Excellence in Sales’ Women in Sales advisory board.\n\nJustin Grimes\n\nSenior Policy Analyst, Office of the Federal CIO, Office of Management and Budget\n\nThis was a busy year for digital policy at OMB. Grimes was in the thick of it, playing a critical role in developing new policy to enhance digital experience for citizen users while complying with congressional mandates. Specifically, he was instrumental in setting standards for the use of government domains to support compliance with the DOTGOV Act, crafting policy to improve digital accessibility for people with disabilities and contributing to the guidance supporting the 21st Century IDEA Act’s implementation, which Federal CIO Clare Martorana has characterized as a 10-year road map for digital government.\n\nDavid Grundy\n\nDirector of Strategy Management and Complex Solutions, Department of Agriculture\n\nIn 2023, Grundy helped start the Agriculture Department’s New Strategy Management and Complex Solutions Division, which supported $65 million in projects to meet internal and external customers with complex solutions and leverage economies of scale. Key functions of the division have been creating a common digital platform, developing a cloud strategy and acquisition plan, and leading and supporting customers as they move toward enterprise adoption of cloud computing. USDA launched its STRATUS contract vehicle in 2023, and Grundy’s division also led work to rehome the Office of Management and Budget’s Max.gov and onboard transitioning customers to Agriculture’s Connect.gov platform last year.\n\nRoss R. Guckert\n\nProgram Executive Officer, U.S. Army PEO/EIS, Department of the Army\n\nProgram Executive Officer, U.S. Army PEO/EIS, Department of the Army\n\nThe Army’s lead buyer for information systems, Guckert ushered in myriad changes for the service, including setting up a chief information office and making agile development practices central to how the program executive office does business with a dedicated center of excellence. The transition to agile was timely, as several major software programs were behind schedule. The shift supported multiple successful deliveries, including the Integrated Personnel and Pay System-Army, the tuition-assistance portal ArmyIgnitED, the Army Contract Writing System and a preview of the Accessions Information Environment. Guckert’s transformative leadership and communication were pivotal in managing the agile journey and fostering a collaborative environment.\n\nJenn L. Gustetic\n\nProgram Director, Early Stage Innovations and Partnerships, Space Technology Mission Directorate, NASA\n\nFrom her time in the White House, to the Federal Innovation Council at the Partnership for Public Service, to her current role at NASA, Gustetic has built a reputation as a changemaker. At NASA, she was trusted by her directorate’s head with establishing the Early Stage Innovations and Partnerships program portfolio in 2020. Under her leadership, ESIP now maintains over 700 projects and oversees six early-stage space programs. Gustetic also helped transform the NASA research and tech transfer programs by sponsoring experiments to enhance efficiencies, including work that led to the implementation of a new, dramatically faster decision-support tool.\n\nSonny Hashmi\n\nCommissioner, Federal Acquisition Service, General Services Administration\n\nHashmi led the Federal Acquisition Service and its approximately 4,400 employees through a redesign in 2023 meant to improve the experience of customers, industry and employees of the organization. The project delivered over $100 billion in business volume around the world to federal, state, local and tribal governments for the first time. The reorganization around customers — rather than regions — is meant to improve service delivery and was years in the making, Hashmi told Nextgov/FCW. Simultaneously, he maintained focus on other FAS goals, including the rollout of the MAS 8(a) pool and FAS Catalog Pilot.\n\nPaul Hasz\n\nDirector of System and Support Services, GrantSolutions, Department of Health and Human Services\n\nThe impact of Hasz’s work stretches across government via GrantSolutions, a shared service that half of federal agencies use to manage grants business processes. It facilitates over $100 billion in federal funding annually. Hasz has been a champion for user-centered design, resulting in major system releases like the machine-learning-powered FasTrack tool to make the work of federal staff easier and get grants out the door faster. Hasz also oversaw the development of the Recipient Data Insights risk management tool, which uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to automate data collection from over 850,000 organizations to predict future audit findings.\n\nSteven Hernandez\n\nChief Information Security Officer and Director of Information Assurance Services, Department of Education\n\nHernandez distinguished himself in 2023 as co-chair of the Federal CISO Council, leading several initiatives to drive progress on modernizing performance metrics, enhancing guidance for secure cloud deployments and advancing the high-value asset program. At the Education Department, he gets some of the credit for the agency’s dramatic improvement on FITARA scores. Hernandez also developed strategies to address federal workforce skills gaps and looked to reskilling to add capacity inside his own shop. He led a zero-trust implementation project and transformed the lessons learned into a governmentwide playbook that other agencies can draw upon for their own zero-trust journeys.\n\nLilian “Lilly” M. Herrera\n\nMobile Services Manager, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security\n\nHerrera leads the federal initiative to enhance mobile security across government agencies, focusing on developing cybersecurity solutions and fostering collaboration to address vulnerabilities and share advancements. An IT expert with significant experience in the mobile sector, Herrera co-chairs the Federal CIO Council’s Federal Mobility Group, aiming to advance federal mobility strategies. In 2023, she held over 30 introductory demonstrations, in addition to beginner and advanced workshops, on CISA’s Mobile App Vetting program — which she worked to launch — so agencies could understand the importance of examining such applications before deploying them. Now, 35 agencies use MAV to make informed mobile decisions.\n\nKendall Holbrook\n\nCEO, Dev Technology Group\n\nWithin Dev, Holbrook oversaw the training and upskilling of 45 employees impacted by the loss of the company’s second-largest contract so they could move to new areas. Within the larger industry, she mentors other small businesses and startup companies in the government market that are looking to find their own path of success. Holbrook’s involvement in the community included her leadership as industry chair of the 2023 ACT-IAC Imagine Nation ELC conference for the second year in a row. That event’s approximate attendance of 1,200 people made it the largest effort in the history of Imagine Nation ELC.\n\nKaren Howard\n\nExecutive Director, Head of Office of Online Services, Internal Revenue Service\n\nIn 2023, Howard was a driving force on taxpayer-experience efforts at the IRS as outlined in the agency’s 10-year strategic plan. Her work includes leadership on an array of tools and initiatives like the enhanced Where’s My Refund tool and recently released Direct File pilot. Howard’s portfolio also includes working on the IRS.gov website and leading the agency’s efforts on self-service options for taxpayers. She has pushed to elevate user experience by recruiting and hiring the right talent and building in user-experience design across development and lifecycle management processes at the IRS.\n\nMark A. James\n\nDirector of Enterprise Cloud Services Directorate, Office of Information and Technology, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security\n\nJames, a 26-year veteran of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has been instrumental in boosting the agency’s push to the cloud. He and his team have migrated more than 80% of the agency’s application portfolio to the cloud as of the end of 2023. The establishment of CBP’s cloud organization has sped up application delivery by as much as 60%. These efforts have powered a new reliance on public-facing digital services, notably the CBP One scheduling platform, demand for which has surged since it was incorporated into an administration effort to manage the influx of migrants at the southern border.\n\nMartha P. Jasper\n\nDeputy Director, Joint Enterprise Services Directorate, Defense Information Systems Agency, Department of Defense\n\nJasper has worn many hats at DISA, including roles spanning security, IT engineering, program management and leadership. As deputy director of the agency’s Joint Enterprise Services Directorate, she is responsible for maintaining the availability, reliability and scalability of DISA’s major IT and business systems. Over the past year, Jasper has been instrumental in DISA’s modernization of its IT service management solution to better support users stationed across the globe.

His team’s development of the IAM Advantage platform — which earned a spot in the DISA Marketplace and completed FedRAMP High and DOD Impact Level 5 requirements — led to its deployment at the U.S. Air Force in less than a week, compared to the usual 12 to 18 months. Topper has also created a tool that accelerates other providers’ accreditation processes by getting up to 80% of their controls properly configured at the get-go, assisting six companies in getting FedRAMP High certification in 2023.\n\nTimothy Tutt\n\nCEO and Co-founder, Night Shift Development\n\nTutt has leveraged his nearly two decades of combined software engineering experience and technical expertise to help organizations across the public and private sectors enhance their analytics tools. With a focus on democratizing data through nontechnical solutions, Tutt is committed to expanding access to technical capabilities for all users. He was selected to participate in — and subsequently graduated from — MissionLink’s 2023 cohort, an invitation-only program focused on developing innovative solutions to national security threats. The organization works to connect technical leaders, like Tutt, with the skills they need to boost the security and data aptitude of critical federal-sector entities and commercial firms.\n\nRosa M. Underwood\n\nSenior Cybersecurity Advisor, Federal Acquisition Service, General Services Administration\n\nUnderwood’s role at the Federal Acquisition Service is to ensure that government purchases meet objectives to improve the nation’s cybersecurity. In 2023, she spearheaded collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to help agencies meet provisions in the Federal Zero Trust Strategy, developing tools like the Application Security Testing Buyers Guide. While serving as a leader on cross-government working groups, she also conceptualized a strategy to support the transition to post-quantum cryptography across the government. Her leadership has helped improve the way GSA’s cadre of technology buyers understand cybersecurity and supply chain risks, according to her supporters.\n\nSteve Walters\n\nSenior Vice President, Federal, ServiceNow\n\nAn Army veteran, Walters brings the highly organized, mission-oriented approach of an ex-military officer to his role as ServiceNow’s federal sales leader. In 2023, his approach with government customers more than paid off, with the company’s U.S. federal business exploding each quarter, accelerating growth in what was already a big business. Under Walters’ leadership, ServiceNow has continued its evolution from IT service desk solution to a trusted platform for digital transformation used by each Cabinet-level agency. For his company, that means revenue; for Walters’ government customers, it means delivering new capabilities in service of citizens, warfighters and public servants.\n\nCW5 Taylor Wells\n\nSenior Technical Advisor to the Director, Defense Information Systems Agency, Department of Defense\n\nWells is the technical plug between warfighters and the head of the Pentagon’s lead IT agency. In his daily role, he provides analysis and advice to DISA’s director, while keeping the pulse of warfighters’ technical needs. In 2023, Wells created a technical strike team that was directly involved in 10 engagements to solve various challenges across the agency. The initiative also served as an excellent recruiting tool, exposing talent outside the agency to DISA’s mission. Wells brings a level of common sense and perspective to challenges that ensures success, according to one colleague.\n\nStephanie L. Wilson\n\nChief Operating Officer, NetImpact Strategies\n\nAll of NetImpact Strategies’ client-facing operations and growth initiatives fall under Wilson’s purview, which means she gets a firsthand look at customers’ digital transformations and evolving mission needs.

She also led the company’s partnership with the Defense Health Agency to roll out the first phase of a new Virtual Education Center that curates 40,000 health articles for patients. Wilson also contributes to industry organizations, including AFCEA, HIMSS and the Professional Services Council.\n\nCori Zarek\n\nDeputy Administrator, U.S. Digital Service, Office of Management and Budget\n\nZarek is in charge of running the day-to-day operations of the White House’s U.S. Digital Service, an over 200-person-strong organization meant to help the federal government deliver better services. In 2023, Zarek devoted particular effort to telling the story of the organization, which is embedded in nearly 20 agencies working on dozens of projects. Zarek has also worked to strengthen internal processes, including by creating a best-practices toolkit for USDS-ers heading into new agencies and expanding digital service capacity across government by helping other agencies set up and expand their own digital service teams.\n\nMya Zemlock\n\nGovernment Program Manager, Dcode\n\nIn 2023, Zemlock helped upskill and reskill more than 500 senior leaders through workshops she led through Dcode, providing continuous learning for government officials and technologists on topics including acquisition and emerging technologies.
