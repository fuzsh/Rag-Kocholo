Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)\n\nCalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared and to comply with this policy.\n\nAccording to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:\n\n0.1. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;\n\n0.2. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;\n\n0.3. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at info@infracloud.io.\n\nOur Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:\n\nWe honor Do Not Track signals and do not track plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.\n\nYou can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.\n\n12. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)\n\nIf you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data, and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask us:\n\n0.1. What personal information we have about you. If you make this request, we will return to you:\n\n0.0.1. The categories of personal information we have collected about you.\n\n0.0.2. The categories of sources from which we collect your personal information.\n\n0.0.3. The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\n\n0.0.4. The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.\n\n0.0.5. The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.\n\n0.0.6. A list of categories of personal information that we have sold, along with the category of any other company we sold it to. If we have not sold your personal information, we will inform you of that fact.\n\n0.0.7. A list of categories of personal information that we have disclosed for a business purpose, along with the category of any other company we shared it with.\n\nPlease note, you are entitled to ask us to provide you with this information up to two times in a rolling twelve-month period. When you make this request, the information provided may be limited to the personal information we collected about you in the previous 12 months.\n\n0.2. To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete the personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, the deletion may be accomplished through the de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your personal information to operate.\n\n0.3. To stop selling your personal information. We don’t sell or rent your personal information to any third party for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.\n\nIf you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.\n\nPlease note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services that require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances will we discriminate against you for exercising your rights.\n\nTo exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s) by email: info@infracloud.io.\n\nYour data protection rights, described above, are covered by the CCPA, short for the California Consumer Privacy Act. To find out more, visit the official California Legislative Information website. The CCPA took effect on 01/01/2020.\n\n13. Service Providers\n\nWe may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (“Service Providers”), provide Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.\n\nThese third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.\n\n14.

We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.\n\nWe have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party sites or services.\n\n18. Children’s Privacy\n\nOur Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 18 (“Child” or “Children”).\n\nWe do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 18. If you become aware that a child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.\n\n19.

We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.\n\nWe will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update “effective date” at the top of this Privacy Policy.\n\nYou are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
