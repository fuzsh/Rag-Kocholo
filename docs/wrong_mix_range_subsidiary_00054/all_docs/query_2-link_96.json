        "meta_description": "Abstract. The radiative effects of clouds make a large contribution to the Earth's energy balance, and changes in clouds constitute the dominant source of uncertainty in the global warming response to carbon dioxide forcing. To characterize and constrain this uncertainty, cloud-controlling factor (CCF) analyses have been suggested that estimate sensitivities of clouds to large-scale environmental changes, typically in cloud-regime-specific multiple linear regression frameworks. Here, local sensitivities of cloud radiative effects to a large number of controlling factors are estimated in a regime-independent framework from 20 years (2001â2020) of near-global (60ââNâ60ââS) satellite observations and reanalysis data using statistical learning. A regularized linear regression (ridge regression) is shown to skillfully predict anomalies of shortwave (R2=0.63) and longwave cloud radiative effects (CREs) (R2=0.72) in independent test data on the basis of 28 CCFs, including aerosol proxies. The sensitivity of CREs to selected CCFs is quantified and analyzed. CRE sensitivities to sea surface temperature and estimated inversion strength are particularly pronounced in low-cloud regions and generally in agreement with previous studies. The analysis of CRE sensitivities to three-dimensional wind field anomalies reflects the fact that CREs in tropical ascent regions are mainly driven by variability of large-scale vertical velocity in the upper troposphere. In the subtropics, CRE is sensitive to free-tropospheric zonal and meridional wind anomalies, which are likely to encapsulate information on synoptic variability that influences subtropical cloud systems by modifying wind shear and thus turbulence and dry-air entrainment in stratocumulus clouds, as well as variability related to midlatitude cyclones. Different proxies for aerosols are analyzed as CCFs, with satellite-derived aerosol proxies showing a larger CRE sensitivity than a proxy from an aerosol reanalysis, likely pointing to satellite aerosol retrieval biases close to clouds, leading to overestimated aerosol sensitivities. Sensitivities of shortwave CREs to all aerosol proxies indicate a pronounced cooling effect from aerosols in stratocumulus regions that is counteracted to a varying degree by a longwave warming effect. The analysis may guide the selection of CCFs in future sensitivity analyses aimed at constraining cloud feedback and climate forcings from aerosolâcloud interactions using data from both observations and global climate models.",

We find a discrepancy between optimal domain size for predicting locally and globally aggregated cloud radiative anomalies and identify upper-tropospheric static stability as an important high-cloud controlling factor.\n\nA satellite-based analysis of semi-direct effects of biomass burning aerosols on fog and low cloud dissipation in the Namib Desert\n\nAlexandre Mass, Hendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Paola Formenti, Eva Pauli, and Julian Quinting\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1627,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1627, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the interaction between smoke aerosols and fog and low clouds (FLCs) in the Namib desert between June and October. Here, a satellite-based dataset of FLCs, reanalysis data and machine learning are used to systematically analyze FLCs persistence under different aerosol loadings. Aerosol plumes are shown to modify local thermodynamics which increases FLC persistence. But fully disentangling aerosol effects from meteorological ones remains a challenge.\n\nFractional solubility of iron in mineral dust aerosols over coastal Namibia: a link to marine biogenic emissions?\n\nKarine Desboeufs, Paola Formenti, Raquel Torres-SÃ¡nchez, Kerstin Schepanski, Jean-Pierre Chaboureau, Hendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Stefanie Feuerstein, Benoit Laurent, Danitza Klopper, Andreas Namwoonde, Mathieu Cazaunau, Servanne Chevaillier, AnaÃ¯s Feron, CÃ©cile Mirande-Bret, Sylvain Triquet, and Stuart J. Piketh\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1525–1541, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1525-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1525-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the fractional solubility of iron (Fe) in dust particles along the coast of Namibia, a critical region for the atmospheric Fe supply of the South Atlantic Ocean. Our results suggest a possible two-way interplay whereby marine biogenic emissions from the coastal marine ecosystems into the atmosphere would increase the solubility of Fe-bearing dust by photo-reduction processes. The subsequent deposition of soluble Fe could act to further enhance marine biogenic emissions.\n\nAnalysis of cloud fraction adjustment to aerosols and its dependence on meteorological controls using explainable machine learning\n\nYichen Jia, Hendrik Andersen, and Jan Cermak\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1667,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1667, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a near-global observation-based explainable machine-learning framework to quantify the response of cloud fraction (CLF) of marine low clouds to cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) considering the covariations with meteorological factors. The CLF sensitivity to Nd and numerous meteorological factors as well as the dependence of the Nd–CLF sensitivity on the meteorology reveal the underlying physical mechanisms, providing a novel approach to constrain aerosol-cloud interactions.\n\nHigh-resolution satellite-based cloud detection for the analysis of land surface effects on boundary layer clouds\n\nJulia Fuchs, Hendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Eva Pauli, and Rob Roebeling\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 4257–4270, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4257-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4257-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTwo cloud-masking approaches, a local and a regional approach, using high-resolution satellite data are developed and validated for the region of Paris to improve applicability for analyses of urban effects on low clouds. We found that cloud masks obtained from the regional approach are more appropriate for the high-resolution analysis of locally induced cloud processes. Its applicability is tested for the analysis of typical fog conditions over different surface types.\n\nLongwave radiative effect of the cloudâaerosol transition zone based on CERES observations\n\nBabak Jahani, Hendrik Andersen, Josep CalbÃ³, Josep-Abel GonzÃ¡lez, and Jan Cermak\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1483–1494, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1483-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1483-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe change in the state of sky from cloudy to cloudless (or vice versa) comprises an additional phase called transition zone with characteristics laying between those of aerosols and clouds. This study presents an approach for the quantification of the broadband longwave radiative effects of the cloud–aerosol transition zone at the top of the atmosphere during daytime over the ocean based on satellite observations and radiative transfer simulations.\n\nMeteorology-driven variability of air pollution (PM1) revealed with explainable machine learning\n\nRoland Stirnberg, Jan Cermak, Simone Kotthaus, Martial Haeffelin, Hendrik Andersen, Julia Fuchs, Miae Kim, Jean-Eudes Petit, and Olivier Favez\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 3919–3948, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3919-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-3919-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAir pollution endangers human health and poses a problem particularly in densely populated areas. Here, an explainable machine learning approach is used to analyse periods of high particle concentrations for a suburban site southwest of Paris to better understand its atmospheric drivers. Air pollution is particularly excaberated by low temperatures and low mixed layer heights, but processes vary substantially between and within seasons.\n\nSynoptic-scale controls of fog and low-cloud variability in the Namib Desert\n\nHendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Julia Fuchs, Peter Knippertz, Marco Gaetani, Julian Quinting, Sebastian Sippel, and Roland Vogt\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 3415–3438, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-3415-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-3415-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFog and low clouds (FLCs) are an essential but poorly understood element of Namib regional climate. Here, a satellite-based data set of FLCs in central Namib, reanalysis data, and back trajectories are used to systematically analyze conditions when FLCs occur. Synoptic-scale mechanisms are identified that influence the formation of FLCs and the onshore advection of marine boundary-layer air masses. The findings lead to a new conceptual model of mechanisms that drive FLC variability in the Namib.\n\nSpatiotemporal dynamics of fog and low clouds in the Namib unveiled with ground- and space-based observations\n\nHendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Irina Solodovnik, Luca Lelli, and Roland Vogt\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 4383–4392, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-4383-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-4383-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFog and low clouds (FLCs) are an essential but poorly understood component of Namib-region climate. This study uses observations from multiple satellite platforms and ground-based measurements to coherently characterize Namib-region FLC patterns. Findings concerning the seasonal cycle of the vertical structure and the diurnal cycle of FLCs lead to a new conceptual model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of FLCs in the Namib and help to improve the understanding of underlying processes.\n\nThe observed diurnal cycle of low-level stratus clouds over southern West Africa: a case study\n\nKarmen BabiÄ, Bianca Adler, Norbert Kalthoff, Hendrik Andersen, Cheikh Dione, Fabienne Lohou, Marie Lothon, and Xabier Pedruzo-Bagazgoitia\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 1281–1299, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-1281-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-1281-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe first detailed observational analysis of the complete diurnal cycle of low-level clouds (LLC) and associated atmospheric processes over southern West Africa is performed using the data gathered within the DACCIWA (Dynamics-Aerosol-Chemistry-Cloud-Interactions in West Africa) ground-based campaign. We find cooling related to the horizontal advection, which occurs in connection with the inflow of cool maritime air mass and a prominent low-level jet, to have the dominant role in LLC formation.\n\nNocturnal low-level clouds in the atmospheric boundary layer over southern West Africa: an observation-based analysis of conditions and processes\n\nBianca Adler, Karmen BabiÄ, Norbert Kalthoff, Fabienne Lohou, Marie Lothon, Cheikh Dione, Xabier Pedruzo-Bagazgoitia, and Hendrik Andersen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 663–681, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-663-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-663-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study deals with nocturnal stratiform low-level clouds that frequently form in the atmospheric boundary layer over southern West Africa. We use observational data from 11 nights to characterize the clouds and intranight variability of boundary layer conditions as well as to assess the physical processes relevant for cloud formation. We find that cooling is crucial to reach saturation and a large part of the cooling is related to horizontal advection of cool air from the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nBuilding a cloud in the southeast Atlantic: understanding low-cloud controls based on satellite observations with machine learning\n\nJulia Fuchs, Jan Cermak, and Hendrik Andersen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 16537–16552, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-16537-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-16537-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study separates the influence of aerosol on cloud properties in the southeast Atlantic region from meteorological conditions in the biomass-burning season. Machine learning is used to link 8-day-averaged satellite and reanalysis data sets. Distinct regimes of aerosol–cloud interactions are identified in the subregions of the southeast Atlantic based on the obtained sensitivities.\n\nFirst fully diurnal fog and low cloud satellite detection reveals life cycle in the Namib\n\nHendrik Andersen and Jan Cermak\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 5461–5470, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-5461-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-5461-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFog and low clouds (FLCs) are a valuable source of water for many ecosystems in the Namib. This study presents the first fully diurnal satellite detection of FLCs, revealing the spatial and temporal patterns in the Namib. A validation is conducted against station measurements in the central Namib and shows a high overall accuracy. The average timing and persistence of FLCs seem to depend on the distance to the coast, suggesting that the region is dominated by advection-driven FLCs.\n\nUnderstanding the drivers of marine liquid-water cloud occurrence and properties with global observations using neural networks\n\nHendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Julia Fuchs, Reto Knutti, and Ulrike Lohmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 9535–9546, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-9535-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-9535-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol-cloud interactions continue to contribute large uncertainties to our climate system understanding. In this study, we use near-global satellite and reanalysis data sets to predict marine liquid-water clouds by means of artificial neural networks. We show that on the system scale, lower-tropospheric stability and boundary layer height are the main determinants of liquid-water clouds. Aerosols show the expected impact on clouds but are less relevant than some meteorological factors.\n\nA systematic evaluation of high-cloud controlling factors\n\nSarah Wilson Kemsley, Paulo Ceppi, Hendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Philip Stier, and Peer Nowack\n\nAtmos.

Here, we present the latest version of tobac, v1.5, which substantially improves scientific capabilities and computational efficiency from the previous version. These enhancements permit new uses for tobac in atmospheric science and potentially other fields.\n\nSensitivity of thermodynamic profiles retrieved from ground-based microwave and infrared observations to additional input data from active remote sensing instruments and numerical weather prediction models\n\nLaura Bianco, Bianca Adler, Ludovic Bariteau, Irina V.

The retrieved profiles are assessed against collocated radiosonde in non-cloudy conditions to assess the sensitivity of the retrievals to different input combinations. Case studies with cloudy conditions are also inspected.\n\nGeneral circulation models simulate negative liquid water pathâdroplet number correlations, but anthropogenic aerosols still increase simulated liquid water path\n\nJohannes MÃ¼lmenstÃ¤dt, Edward Gryspeerdt, Sudhakar Dipu, Johannes Quaas, Andrew S.

These particles change how much sunlight clouds reflect to space, an important human perturbation of the climate, whose magnitude is highly uncertain. We found that the latest climate models show a negative correlation but a positive causal relationship between aerosols and cloud water. This means we need to be very careful when we interpret observational studies that can only see correlation.\n\nIsolating aerosol-climate interactions in global kilometre-scale simulations\n\nRoss J. Herbert, Andrew I. L. Williams, Philipp Weiss, Duncan Watson-Parris, Elisabeth Dingley, Daniel Klocke, and Philip Stier\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1689,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1689, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClouds exist at scales that climate models struggle to represent, limiting our knowledge of how climate change may impact clouds. Here we use a new km-scale global model representing an important step towards the necessary scale. We focus on how aerosol particles modify clouds, radiation, and precipitation. We find the magnitude and manner of responses tend to vary from region to region, highlighting the potential of global km-scale simulations and a need to represent aerosols in climate models.\n\nOpinion: Why all emergent constraints are wrong but some are useful – a machine learning perspective\n\nPeer Nowack and Duncan Watson-Parris\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1636,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1636, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn our Opinion article, we review uncertainties in global climate change projections and current methods using Earth observations to constrain them, which is crucial for climate risk assessments and for informing society. We then discuss how machine learning can advance the field, discussing recent work that provides potentially stronger and more robust links between observed data and future climate projections. We further discuss challenges of applying machine learning to climate science.\n\nBiomass Burning Emissions Analysis Based on MODIS AOD and AeroCom Multi-Model Simulations\n\nMariya Petrenko, Ralph Kahn, Mian Chin, Susanne E.

In regions where plumes are thick and background aerosol is low, models and satellites compare well. However, the input emission inventory tends to underestimate in many places, and particle property and loss-rate assumptions vary enormously among models, causing uncertainties that require systematic in-situ measurements to resolve.\n\nWeak liquid water path response in ship tracks\n\nAnna Tippett, Edward Gryspeerdt, Peter Manshausen, Philip Stier, and Tristan W. P. Smith\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1479,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1479, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nShip emissions can form artificially brightened clouds, known as ship tracks, and provide us with an opportunity to investigate how aerosols interact with clouds. Previous studies that used ship tracks suggest that clouds can experience large increases in the amount of water (LWP) from aerosols. Here, we show that there is a bias in previous research, and that when we account for this bias, the LWP response to aerosols is much weaker than previously reported.\n\nA Lagrangian perspective on the lifecycle and cloud radiative effect of deep convective clouds over Africa\n\nWilliam K. Jones, Martin Stengel, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 5165–5180, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5165-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5165-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStorm clouds cover large areas of the tropics. These clouds both reflect incoming sunlight and trap heat from the atmosphere below, regulating the temperature of the tropics. Over land, storm clouds occur in the late afternoon and evening and so exist both during the daytime and at night. Changes in this timing could upset the balance of the respective cooling and heating effects of these clouds. We find that isolated storms have a larger effect on this balance than their small size suggests.\n\nEarth Virtualization Engines (EVE)\n\nBjorn Stevens, Stefan Adami, Tariq Ali, Hartwig Anzt, Zafer Aslan, Sabine Attinger, Jaana BÃ¤ck, Johanna Baehr, Peter Bauer, Natacha Bernier, Bob Bishop, Hendryk Bockelmann, Sandrine Bony, Guy Brasseur, David N.

In the context of photovoltaic power production, FLS is particularly important, as FLS, impact large regions simultaneously, making regional power grid balancing hard. This study introduces a new machine leanring based algorithm developed for the MSG geostationary satellites that can provide a coherent and detailed view of FLS development over large areas over the 24 H day cycle.\n\nImproving solution availability and temporal consistency of an optimal estimation physical retrieval for ground-based thermodynamic boundary layer profiling\n\nBianca Adler, David D. Turner, Laura Bianco, Irina V. Djalalova, Timothy Myers, and James M. Wilczak\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-714,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-714, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nProfiles of temperature and humidity in the atmospheric boundary layer can be retrieved from passive ground-based remote sensors such as microwave radiometers and infrared spectrometers. In this work, we present improvements to the optimal estimation physical retrieval framework TROPoe, which increase the availability of retrieved profiles and temporal consistency and enhance the value of TROPoe for the study of atmospheric processes.\n\nFractional solubility of iron in mineral dust aerosols over coastal Namibia: a link to marine biogenic emissions?\n\nKarine Desboeufs, Paola Formenti, Raquel Torres-SÃ¡nchez, Kerstin Schepanski, Jean-Pierre Chaboureau, Hendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Stefanie Feuerstein, Benoit Laurent, Danitza Klopper, Andreas Namwoonde, Mathieu Cazaunau, Servanne Chevaillier, AnaÃ¯s Feron, CÃ©cile Mirande-Bret, Sylvain Triquet, and Stuart J. Piketh\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1525–1541, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1525-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1525-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the fractional solubility of iron (Fe) in dust particles along the coast of Namibia, a critical region for the atmospheric Fe supply of the South Atlantic Ocean. Our results suggest a possible two-way interplay whereby marine biogenic emissions from the coastal marine ecosystems into the atmosphere would increase the solubility of Fe-bearing dust by photo-reduction processes. The subsequent deposition of soluble Fe could act to further enhance marine biogenic emissions.\n\nCloud condensation nuclei concentrations derived from the CAMS reanalysis\n\nKaroline Block, Mahnoosh Haghighatnasab, Daniel G. Partridge, Philip Stier, and Johannes Quaas\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 16, 443–470, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-443-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-16-443-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosols being able to act as condensation nuclei for cloud droplets (CCNs) are a key element in cloud formation but very difficult to determine. In this study we present a new global vertically resolved CCN dataset for various humidity conditions and aerosols. It is obtained using an atmospheric model (CAMS reanalysis) that is fed by satellite observations of light extinction (AOD). We investigate and evaluate the abundance of CCNs in the atmosphere and their temporal and spatial occurrence.\n\nGlobal observations of aerosol indirect effects from marine liquid clouds\n\nCasey J. Wall, Trude Storelvmo, and Anna Possner\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 13125–13141, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13125-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13125-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInteractions between aerosol pollution and liquid clouds are one of the largest sources of uncertainty in the effective radiative forcing of climate over the industrial era. We use global satellite observations to decompose the forcing into components from changes in cloud-droplet number concentration, cloud water content, and cloud amount. Our results reduce uncertainty in these forcing components and clarify their relative importance.\n\nRapid saturation of cloud water adjustments to shipping emissions\n\nPeter Manshausen, Duncan Watson-Parris, Matthew W. Christensen, Jukka-Pekka Jalkanen, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 12545–12555, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12545-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-12545-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol from burning fuel changes cloud properties, e.g., the number of droplets and the content of water. Here, we study how clouds respond to different amounts of shipping aerosol. Droplet numbers increase linearly with increasing aerosol over a broad range until they stop increasing, while the amount of liquid water always increases, independently of emission amount. These changes in cloud properties can make them reflect more or less sunlight, which is important for the earth's climate.\n\nIdentifying climate model structural inconsistencies allows for tight constraint of aerosol radiative forcing\n\nLeighton A. Regayre, Lucia Deaconu, Daniel P. Grosvenor, David M. H. Sexton, Christopher Symonds, Tom Langton, Duncan Watson-Paris, Jane P. Mulcahy, Kirsty J. Pringle, Mark Richardson, Jill S. Johnson, John W. Rostron, Hamish Gordon, Grenville Lister, Philip Stier, and Ken S. Carslaw\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8749–8768, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8749-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8749-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol forcing of Earthâs energy balance has persisted as a major cause of uncertainty in climate simulations over generations of climate model development. We show that structural deficiencies in a climate model are exposed by comprehensively exploring parametric uncertainty and that these deficiencies limit how much the model uncertainty can be reduced through observational constraint. This provides a future pathway towards building models with greater physical realism and lower uncertainty.\n\nAnalysis of cloud fraction adjustment to aerosols and its dependence on meteorological controls using explainable machine learning\n\nYichen Jia, Hendrik Andersen, and Jan Cermak\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1667,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1667, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a near-global observation-based explainable machine-learning framework to quantify the response of cloud fraction (CLF) of marine low clouds to cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) considering the covariations with meteorological factors. The CLF sensitivity to Nd and numerous meteorological factors as well as the dependence of the Nd–CLF sensitivity on the meteorology reveal the underlying physical mechanisms, providing a novel approach to constrain aerosol-cloud interactions.\n\nUpdated observations of clouds by MODIS for global model assessment\n\nRobert Pincus, Paul A. Hubanks, Steven Platnick, Kerry Meyer, Robert E. Holz, Denis Botambekov, and Casey J. Wall\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 2483–2497, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2483-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2483-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes a new global dataset of cloud properties observed by a specific satellite program created to facilitate comparison with a matching observational proxy used in climate models. Statistics are accumulated over daily and monthly timescales on an equal-angle grid. Statistics include cloud detection, cloud-top pressure, and cloud optical properties. Joint histograms of several variable pairs are also available.\n\nSatellite observations of smokeâcloudâradiation interactions over the Amazon rainforest\n\nRoss Herbert and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4595–4616, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4595-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4595-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide robust evidence from multiple sources showing that smoke from fires in the Amazon rainforest significantly modifies the diurnal cycle of convection and cools the climate. Low to moderate amounts of smoke increase deep convective clouds and rain, whilst beyond a threshold amount, the smoke starts to suppress the convection and rain. We are currently at this threshold, suggesting increases in fires from agricultural practices or droughts will reduce cloudiness and rain over the region.\n\nA semi-Lagrangian method for detecting and tracking deep convective clouds in geostationary satellite observations\n\nWilliam K. Jones, Matthew W. Christensen, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 1043–1059, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-1043-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-1043-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGeostationary weather satellites have been used to detect storm clouds since their earliest applications. However, this task remains difficult as imaging satellites cannot observe the strong vertical winds that are characteristic of storm clouds. Here we introduce a new method that allows us to detect the early development of storms and continue to track them throughout their lifetime, allowing us to study how their early behaviour affects subsequent weather.\n\nIdentifying climate model structural inconsistencies allows for tight constraint of aerosol radiative forcing\n\nLeighton A. Regayre, Lucia Deaconu, Daniel P. Grosvenor, David Sexton, Christopher C. Symonds, Tom Langton, Duncan Watson-Paris, Jane P. Mulcahy, Kirsty J. Pringle, Mark Richardson, Jill S.

Combined consideration of parametric and structural uncertainties provides a future pathway towards building models that have greater physical realism and lower uncertainty.\n\nPossible evidence of increased global cloudiness due to aerosol-cloud interactions\n\nAlyson Rose Douglas and Tristan L'Ecuyer\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2022-688,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2022-688, 2022\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol, or small particles released by human activities, enter the atmosphere and eventually interact with clouds in what we term aerosol-cloud interactions. As more aerosol enter a cloud, they act as cloud droplet nuclei, increasing the number of cloud droplets in a cloud and delaying rain formation, leading to a larger cloud. We use machine learning and found that these interactions lead to 1.27 % more cloudiness on Earth and offset ~1/4 of the warming due to CO2.\n\nRobust evidence for reversal of the trend in aerosol effective climate forcing\n\nJohannes Quaas, Hailing Jia, Chris Smith, Anna Lea Albright, Wenche Aas, Nicolas Bellouin, Olivier Boucher, Marie Doutriaux-Boucher, Piers M. Forster, Daniel Grosvenor, Stuart Jenkins, Zbigniew Klimont, Norman G. Loeb, Xiaoyan Ma, Vaishali Naik, Fabien Paulot, Philip Stier, Martin Wild, Gunnar Myhre, and Michael Schulz\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 12221–12239, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12221-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12221-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPollution particles cool climate and offset part of the global warming. However, they are washed out by rain and thus their effect responds quickly to changes in emissions. We show multiple datasets to demonstrate that aerosol emissions and their concentrations declined in many regions influenced by human emissions, as did the effects on clouds. Consequently, the cooling impact on the Earth energy budget became smaller. This change in trend implies a relative warming.\n\nSource attribution of cloud condensation nuclei and their impact on stratocumulus clouds and radiation in the south-eastern Atlantic\n\nHaochi Che, Philip Stier, Duncan Watson-Parris, Hamish Gordon, and Lucia Deaconu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 10789–10807, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10789-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-10789-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtensive stratocumulus clouds over the south-eastern Atlantic (SEA) can lead to a cooling effect on the climate. A key pathway by which aerosols affect cloud properties is by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Here, we investigated the source attribution of CCN in the SEA as well as the cloud responses. Our results show that aerosol nucleation contributes most to CCN in the marine boundary layer. In terms of emissions, anthropogenic sources contribute most to the CCN and cloud droplets.\n\nHigh-resolution satellite-based cloud detection for the analysis of land surface effects on boundary layer clouds\n\nJulia Fuchs, Hendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Eva Pauli, and Rob Roebeling\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 4257–4270, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4257-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4257-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTwo cloud-masking approaches, a local and a regional approach, using high-resolution satellite data are developed and validated for the region of Paris to improve applicability for analyses of urban effects on low clouds. We found that cloud masks obtained from the regional approach are more appropriate for the high-resolution analysis of locally induced cloud processes. Its applicability is tested for the analysis of typical fog conditions over different surface types.\n\nA machine learning approach to quantify meteorological drivers of ozone pollution in China from 2015 to 2019\n\nXiang Weng, Grant L. Forster, and Peer Nowack\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 8385–8402, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-8385-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-8385-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use machine learning to quantify the meteorological drivers behind surface ozone variations in China between 2015 and 2019. Our novel approaches show improved performance when compared to previous analysis methods. We highlight that nonlinearity in driver relationships and the impacts of large-scale meteorological phenomena are key to understanding ozone pollution. Moreover, we find that almost half of the observed ozone trend between 2015 and 2019 might have been driven by meteorology.\n\nLongwave radiative effect of the cloudâaerosol transition zone based on CERES observations\n\nBabak Jahani, Hendrik Andersen, Josep CalbÃ³, Josep-Abel GonzÃ¡lez, and Jan Cermak\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 1483–1494, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1483-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-1483-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe change in the state of sky from cloudy to cloudless (or vice versa) comprises an additional phase called transition zone with characteristics laying between those of aerosols and clouds. This study presents an approach for the quantification of the broadband longwave radiative effects of the cloud–aerosol transition zone at the top of the atmosphere during daytime over the ocean based on satellite observations and radiative transfer simulations.\n\nOpportunistic experiments to constrain aerosol effective radiative forcing\n\nMatthew W.

Chem. Phys., 22, 641–674, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-641-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-641-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTrace gases and aerosols (tiny airborne particles) are released from a variety of point sources around the globe. Examples include volcanoes, industrial chimneys, forest fires, and ship stacks. These sources provide opportunistic experiments with which to quantify the role of aerosols in modifying cloud properties. We review the current state of understanding on the influence of aerosol on climate built from the wide range of natural and anthropogenic laboratories investigated in recent decades.\n\nModel calibration using ESEm v1.1.0 â an open, scalable Earth system emulator\n\nDuncan Watson-Parris, Andrew Williams, Lucia Deaconu, and Philip Stier\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 7659–7672, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7659-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7659-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Earth System Emulator (ESEm) provides a fast and flexible framework for emulating a wide variety of Earth science datasets and tools for constraining (or tuning) models of any complexity. Three distinct use cases are presented that demonstrate the utility of ESEm and provide some insight into the use of machine learning for emulation in these different settings. The open-source Python package is freely available so that it might become a valuable tool for the community.\n\nAerosol absorption in global models from AeroCom phase III\n\nMaria Sand, BjÃ¸rn H.

Tsyro, and Duncan Watson-Parris\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 15929–15947, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15929-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15929-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAbsorption of shortwave radiation by aerosols can modify precipitation and clouds but is poorly constrained in models. A total of 15 different aerosol models from AeroCom phase III have reported total aerosol absorption, and for the first time, 11 of these models have reported in a consistent experiment the contributions to absorption from black carbon, dust, and organic aerosol. Here, we document the model diversity in aerosol absorption.\n\nGlobal evidence of aerosol-induced invigoration in marine cumulus clouds\n\nAlyson Douglas and Tristan L'Ecuyer\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 15103–15114, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15103-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15103-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhen aerosols enter the atmosphere, they interact with the clouds above in what we term aerosol–cloud interactions and lead to a series of reactions which delay the onset of rain. This delay may lead to increased rain rates, or invigoration, when the cloud eventually rains. We show that aerosol leads to invigoration in certain environments. The strength of the invigoration depends on how large the cloud is, which suggests that it is highly tied to the organization of the cloud system.\n\nMachine learning calibration of low-cost NO2 and PM10 sensors: non-linear algorithms and their impact on site transferability\n\nPeer Nowack, Lev Konstantinovskiy, Hannah Gardiner, and John Cant\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 5637–5655, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5637-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5637-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMachine learning (ML) calibration techniques could be an effective way to improve the performance of low-cost air pollution sensors. Here we provide novel insights from case studies within the urban area of London, UK, where we compared the performance of three ML techniques to calibrate low-cost measurements of NO2 and PM10. In particular, we highlight the key issue of the method-dependent robustness in maintaining calibration skill after transferring sensors to different measurement sites.\n\nAn unsupervised learning approach to identifying blocking events: the case of European summer\n\nCarl Thomas, Apostolos Voulgarakis, Gerald Lim, Joanna Haigh, and Peer Nowack\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 2, 581–608, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-2-581-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-2-581-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric blocking events are complex large-scale weather patterns which block the path of the jet stream. They are associated with heat waves in summer and cold snaps in winter. Blocking is poorly understood, and the effect of climate change is not clear. Here, we present a new method to study blocking using unsupervised machine learning. We show that this method performs better than previous methods used. These results show the potential for unsupervised learning in atmospheric science.\n\nOn the contribution of fast and slow responses to precipitation changes caused by aerosol perturbations\n\nShipeng Zhang, Philip Stier, and Duncan Watson-Parris\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 10179–10197, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-10179-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-10179-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe relationship between aerosol-induced changes in atmospheric energetics and precipitation responses across different scales is studied in terms of fast (radiatively or microphysically mediated) and slow (temperature-mediated) responses. We introduced a method to decompose rainfall changes into contributions from clouds, aerosols, and clear–clean sky from an energetic perspective. It provides a way to better interpret and quantify the precipitation changes caused by aerosol perturbations.\n\nThe importance of antecedent vegetation and drought conditions as global drivers of burnt area\n\nAlexander Kuhn-RÃ©gnier, Apostolos Voulgarakis, Peer Nowack, Matthias Forkel, I. Colin Prentice, and Sandy P. Harrison\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 3861–3879, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3861-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-3861-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAlong with current climate, vegetation, and human influences, long-term accumulation of biomass affects fires. Here, we find that including the influence of antecedent vegetation and moisture improves our ability to predict global burnt area. Additionally, the length of the preceding period which needs to be considered for accurate predictions varies across regions.\n\nAEROCOM and AEROSAT AAOD and SSA study â PartÂ 1: Evaluation and intercomparison of satellite measurements\n\nNick Schutgens, Oleg Dubovik, Otto Hasekamp, Omar Torres, Hiren Jethva, Peter J.

We evaluate and intercompare four global satellite datasets of absorptive aerosol optical depth (AAOD) and single-scattering albedo (SSA). We show that these datasets show reasonable correlations with the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) reference, although significant biases remain. In a follow-up paper we show that these observations nevertheless can be used for model evaluation.\n\nEvaluating stratospheric ozone and water vapour changes in CMIP6 models from 1850 to 2100\n\nJames Keeble, Birgit Hassler, Antara Banerjee, Ramiro Checa-Garcia, Gabriel Chiodo, Sean Davis, Veronika Eyring, Paul T.

We evaluate changes to these species from 1850 to 2100 in the new generation of CMIP6 models. There is good agreement between the multi-model mean and observations, although there is substantial variation between the individual models. The future evolution of both ozone and water vapour is strongly dependent on the assumed future emissions scenario.\n\nMeteorology-driven variability of air pollution (PM1) revealed with explainable machine learning\n\nRoland Stirnberg, Jan Cermak, Simone Kotthaus, Martial Haeffelin, Hendrik Andersen, Julia Fuchs, Miae Kim, Jean-Eudes Petit, and Olivier Favez\n\nAtmos.

Here, an explainable machine learning approach is used to analyse periods of high particle concentrations for a suburban site southwest of Paris to better understand its atmospheric drivers. Air pollution is particularly excaberated by low temperatures and low mixed layer heights, but processes vary substantially between and within seasons.\n\nAn overview of the ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) project: aerosolâcloudâradiation interactions in the southeast Atlantic basin\n\nJens Redemann, Robert Wood, Paquita Zuidema, Sarah J.

ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) is a 5-year NASA investigation designed to study the key processes that determine these climate impacts. The main purpose of this paper is to familiarize the broader scientific community with the ORACLES project, the dataset it produced, and the most important initial findings.\n\nThe CLoudâAerosolâRadiation Interaction and Forcing: YearÂ 2017 (CLARIFY-2017) measurement campaign\n\nJim M.

This study provides an overview of a measurement campaign called the cloud–aerosol–radiation interaction and forcing for year 2017 (CLARIFY-2017) and documents the rationale, deployment strategy, observations, and key results from the campaign which utilized the heavily equipped FAAM atmospheric research aircraft.\n\nCloud adjustments dominate the overall negative aerosol radiative effects of biomass burning aerosols in UKESM1 climate model simulations over the south-eastern Atlantic\n\nHaochi Che, Philip Stier, Hamish Gordon, Duncan Watson-Parris, and Lucia Deaconu\n\nAtmos. Chem.

A UKEMS1 model simulation shows that the absorption effect of biomass burning aerosols is the most significant on clouds and radiation. The dominate cooling and rapid adjustments induced by the radiative effects of biomass burning aerosols result in an overall cooling in the south-eastern Atlantic.\n\nDescription and evaluation of aerosol in UKESM1 and HadGEM3-GC3.1 CMIP6 historical simulations\n\nJane P.

Here, we comprehensively document and evaluate the aerosol schemes as implemented in the physical and Earth system models, HadGEM3-GC3.1 and UKESM1. This study provides a useful characterisation of the aerosol climatology in both models, facilitating the understanding of the numerous aerosolâclimate interaction studies that will be conducted for CMIP6 and beyond.\n\nTropical Pacific climate variability under solar geoengineering: impacts on ENSO extremes\n\nAbdul Malik, Peer J. Nowack, Joanna D. Haigh, Long Cao, Luqman Atique, and Yves Plancherel\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 15461–15485, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15461-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-15461-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSolar geoengineering has been introduced to mitigate human-caused global warming by reflecting sunlight back into space. This research investigates the impact of solar geoengineering on the tropical Pacific climate. We find that solar geoengineering can compensate some of the greenhouse-induced changes in the tropical Pacific but not all. In particular, solar geoengineering will result in significant changes in rainfall, sea surface temperatures, and increased frequency of extreme ENSO events.\n\nConstraining the Twomey effect from satellite observations: issues and perspectives\n\nJohannes Quaas, Antti Arola, Brian Cairns, Matthew Christensen, Hartwig Deneke, Annica M.

This Twomey effect is poorly constrained by models and requires satellite data for better quantification. The review summarizes the challenges in properly doing so and outlines avenues for progress towards a better use of aerosol retrievals and better retrievals of droplet concentrations.\n\nAn AeroComâAeroSat study: intercomparison of satellite AOD datasets for aerosol model evaluation\n\nNick Schutgens, Andrew M.

Such measurements are challenging but also provide the best opportunity to globally observe an atmospheric component strongly related to air pollution and climate change. Our study shows that most datasets perform similarly well on a global scale but that locally errors can be quite different. We develop a technique to estimate satellite errors everywhere, even in the absence of surface reference data.\n\nQuantifying the sensitivity of aerosol optical properties to the parameterizations of physico-chemical processes during the 2010 Russian wildfires and heatwave\n\nLaura Palacios-PeÃ±a, Philip Stier, Raquel Lorente-Plazas, and Pedro JimÃ©nez-Guerrero\n\nAtmos. Chem.

This is mainly due to the lack of understanding of aerosol optical properties and vertical distribution, whose uncertainties come from different processes. This work attempts to quantify the sensitivity of aerosol optical properties and their vertical distribution to key physico-chemical processes.\n\nCloudy-sky contributions to the direct aerosol effect\n\nGunnar Myhre, BjÃ¸rn H.

In this study we use observational methods and two sets of multi-model global aerosol simulations over the industrial era to show that the contribution from cloudy-sky regions is likely weak.\n\nEnsemble daily simulations for elucidating cloudâaerosol interactions under a large spread of realistic environmental conditions\n\nGuy Dagan and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 6291–6303, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-6291-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-6291-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEnsemble daily simulations for two separate month-long periods over a region near Barbados were conducted to investigate aerosol effects on cloud properties and the atmospheric energy budget. For each day, two simulations were conducted with low and high cloud droplet number concentrations representing clean and polluted conditions, respectively. These simulations are used to distinguish between properties that are robustly affected by changes in aerosol concentrations and those that are not.\n\nQuantifying cloud adjustments and the radiative forcing due to aerosolâcloud interactions in satellite observations of warm marine clouds\n\nAlyson Douglas and Tristan L'Ecuyer\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 6225–6241, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-6225-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-6225-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosols, or small, suspended droplets in the atmosphere, are released from anthropogenic activity and interact with warm clouds, leading to changes in the clouds' brightness and size. Our study evaluates how aerosols alter warm clouds and their ability to cool the Earth's surface. We find aerosols make clouds brighter and grow larger in the atmosphere; however, the cooling effect due to whiter, brighter clouds is 5 times the cooling due to an increased extent.\n\nGlobal response of parameterised convective cloud fields to anthropogenic aerosol forcing\n\nZak Kipling, Laurent Labbouz, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 4445–4460, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4445-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4445-2020, 2020\n\nAtmospheric energy budget response to idealized aerosol perturbation in tropical cloud systems\n\nGuy Dagan, Philip Stier, Matthew Christensen, Guido Cioni, Daniel Klocke, and Axel Seifert\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 4523–4544, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4523-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-4523-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn order to better understand the physical processes behind aerosol effects on the atmospheric energy budget, we analyse numerical simulations of tropical cloud systems. Two sets of simulations, at different dates during the NARVAL 2 field campaign, are simulated with different dominant cloud modes. Our results demonstrate that under different environmental conditions, the response of the atmospheric energy budget to aerosol perturbation could be different.\n\nSynoptic-scale controls of fog and low-cloud variability in the Namib Desert\n\nHendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Julia Fuchs, Peter Knippertz, Marco Gaetani, Julian Quinting, Sebastian Sippel, and Roland Vogt\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 3415–3438, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-3415-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-3415-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFog and low clouds (FLCs) are an essential but poorly understood element of Namib regional climate. Here, a satellite-based data set of FLCs in central Namib, reanalysis data, and back trajectories are used to systematically analyze conditions when FLCs occur. Synoptic-scale mechanisms are identified that influence the formation of FLCs and the onshore advection of marine boundary-layer air masses. The findings lead to a new conceptual model of mechanisms that drive FLC variability in the Namib.\n\nSurprising similarities in model and observational aerosol radiative forcing estimates\n\nEdward Gryspeerdt, Johannes MÃ¼lmenstÃ¤dt, Andrew Gettelman, Florent F. Malavelle, Hugh Morrison, David Neubauer, Daniel G. Partridge, Philip Stier, Toshihiko Takemura, Hailong Wang, Minghuai Wang, and Kai Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Observation-based estimates of the radiative forcing are typically smaller than those from global models, but it is not clear if they are more reliable. This work shows how the forcing components in global climate models can be identified, highlighting similarities between the two methods and areas for future investigation.\n\nEffects of aerosol in simulations of realistic shallow cumulus cloud fields in a large domain\n\nGeorge Spill, Philip Stier, Paul R. Field, and Guy Dagan\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Here we present simulations of realistic, shallow cloud fields in a large domain, in contrast to typical idealised simulations, and find that in these simulations the response to aerosol perturbations is different.\n\ntobac 1.2: towards a flexible framework for tracking and analysis of clouds in diverse datasets\n\nMax Heikenfeld, Peter J.

It provides a flexible new way to include the evolution of individual clouds in a wide range of analyses. It is developed as a community project to provide a common basis for the inclusion of existing tracking algorithms and the development of new analyses that involve tracking clouds and other features in geoscientific research.\n\nWater vapour adjustments and responses differ between climate drivers\n\nÃivind Hodnebrog, Gunnar Myhre, BjÃ¸rn H.

Here we investigate how various gases and particles impact atmospheric water vapour and its lifetime, i.e., the average number of days that water vapour stays in the atmosphere after evaporation and before precipitation. We find that this lifetime could increase substantially by the end of this century, indicating that important changes in precipitation patterns are excepted.\n\nIn situ constraints on the vertical distribution of global aerosol\n\nDuncan Watson-Parris, Nick Schutgens, Carly Reddington, Kirsty J. Pringle, Dantong Liu, James D. Allan, Hugh Coe, Ken S. Carslaw, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 11765–11790, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-11765-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-11765-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe vertical distribution of aerosol in the atmosphere affects its ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei and changes the amount of sunlight it absorbs or reflects. Common global measurements of aerosol provide no information about this vertical distribution. Using a global collection of in situ aircraft measurements to compare with an aerosolâclimate model (ECHAM-HAM), we explore the key processes controlling this distribution and find that wet removal plays a key role.\n\nThe global aerosolâclimate model ECHAM6.3âHAM2.3 â Part 2: Cloud evaluation, aerosol radiative forcing, and climate sensitivity\n\nDavid Neubauer, Sylvaine Ferrachat, Colombe Siegenthaler-Le Drian, Philip Stier, Daniel G.

The simulation of clouds has improved in ECHAM6.3âHAM2.3. This has an impact on effective radiative forcing due to aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions and equilibrium climate sensitivity, which are weaker in ECHAM6.3–HAM2.3 than in the previous model versions.\n\nEvaluation of global simulations of aerosol particle and cloud condensation nuclei number, with implications for cloud droplet formation\n\nGeorge S.

This study evaluates the skill of global models to simulate aerosol, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCs). Model results show reduced spread in CDNC compared to CCN due to the negative correlation between the sensitivities of CDNC to aerosol number concentration (air pollution) and updraft velocity (atmospheric dynamics).\n\nAnthropogenic aerosol forcing â insights from multiple estimates from aerosol-climate models with reduced complexity\n\nStephanie Fiedler, Stefan Kinne, Wan Ting Katty Huang, Petri RÃ¤isÃ¤nen, Declan O'Donnell, Nicolas Bellouin, Philip Stier, Joonas Merikanto, Twan van Noije, Risto Makkonen, and Ulrike Lohmann\n\nAtmos.

When aerosols encounter clouds they interact in what is known as the indirect effect. Brighter clouds are expected due to the microphysical response; however, certain environments can trigger a modified response. Limits on the stability, humidity, and cloud thickness are applied regionally to investigate local cloud responses to aerosol, resulting in a range of indirect effects that would result in significant cooling or slight warming.\n\nThe global aerosolâclimate model ECHAM6.3âHAM2.3 â Part 1: Aerosol evaluation\n\nIna Tegen, David Neubauer, Sylvaine Ferrachat, Colombe Siegenthaler-Le Drian, Isabelle Bey, Nick Schutgens, Philip Stier, Duncan Watson-Parris, Tanja Stanelle, Hauke Schmidt, Sebastian Rast, Harri Kokkola, Martin Schultz, Sabine Schroeder, Nikos Daskalakis, Stefan Barthel, Bernd Heinold, and Ulrike Lohmann\n\nGeosci.

The updated version of HAM contains improved descriptions of aerosol processes, including updated emission fields and cloud processes. While there are regional deviations between the model and observations, the model performs well overall.\n\nSpatiotemporal dynamics of fog and low clouds in the Namib unveiled with ground- and space-based observations\n\nHendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Irina Solodovnik, Luca Lelli, and Roland Vogt\n\nAtmos.

This study uses observations from multiple satellite platforms and ground-based measurements to coherently characterize Namib-region FLC patterns. Findings concerning the seasonal cycle of the vertical structure and the diurnal cycle of FLCs lead to a new conceptual model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of FLCs in the Namib and help to improve the understanding of underlying processes.\n\nAerosol effects on deep convection: the propagation of aerosol perturbations through convective cloud microphysics\n\nMax Heikenfeld, Bethan White, Laurent Labbouz, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 2601–2627, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-2601-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-2601-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosols can affect the evolution of deep convective clouds by controlling the cloud droplet number concentration. We perform a detailed analysis of the pathways of such aerosol perturbations through the cloud microphysics in numerical model simulations. By focussing on individually tracked convective cells, we can reveal consistent changes to individual process rates, such as a lifting of freezing and riming, but also major differences between the three different microphysics schemes used.\n\nThe observed diurnal cycle of low-level stratus clouds over southern West Africa: a case study\n\nKarmen BabiÄ, Bianca Adler, Norbert Kalthoff, Hendrik Andersen, Cheikh Dione, Fabienne Lohou, Marie Lothon, and Xabier Pedruzo-Bagazgoitia\n\nAtmos.

We find cooling related to the horizontal advection, which occurs in connection with the inflow of cool maritime air mass and a prominent low-level jet, to have the dominant role in LLC formation.\n\nAerosol backscatter profiles from ceilometers: validation of water vapor correction in the framework of CeiLinEx2015\n\nMatthias Wiegner, Ina Mattis, Margit PattantyÃºs-ÃbrahÃ¡m, Juan Antonio Bravo-Aranda, Yann Poltera, Alexander Haefele, Maxime Hervo, Ulrich GÃ¶rsdorf, Ronny Leinweber, Josef Gasteiger, Martial Haeffelin, Frank Wagner, Jan Cermak, Katerina KomÃ­nkovÃ¡, Mike Brettle, Christoph MÃ¼nkel, and Kornelia PÃ¶nitz\n\nAtmos.

Thus, a correction is required to retrieve aerosol optical properties. Validation of this correction scheme was performed in the framework of CeiLinEx2015 for several ceilometers with good agreement for Vaisala's CL51 ceilometer. For future applications we recommend monitoring the emitted wavelength and providing dark measurements on a regular basis to be able to correct for signal artifacts.\n\nNocturnal low-level clouds in the atmospheric boundary layer over southern West Africa: an observation-based analysis of conditions and processes\n\nBianca Adler, Karmen BabiÄ, Norbert Kalthoff, Fabienne Lohou, Marie Lothon, Cheikh Dione, Xabier Pedruzo-Bagazgoitia, and Hendrik Andersen\n\nAtmos.

We use observational data from 11 nights to characterize the clouds and intranight variability of boundary layer conditions as well as to assess the physical processes relevant for cloud formation. We find that cooling is crucial to reach saturation and a large part of the cooling is related to horizontal advection of cool air from the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nBuilding a cloud in the southeast Atlantic: understanding low-cloud controls based on satellite observations with machine learning\n\nJulia Fuchs, Jan Cermak, and Hendrik Andersen\n\nAtmos.

Phys., 18, 16537–16552, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-16537-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-16537-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study separates the influence of aerosol on cloud properties in the southeast Atlantic region from meteorological conditions in the biomass-burning season. Machine learning is used to link 8-day-averaged satellite and reanalysis data sets. Distinct regimes of aerosol–cloud interactions are identified in the subregions of the southeast Atlantic based on the obtained sensitivities.\n\nFirst fully diurnal fog and low cloud satellite detection reveals life cycle in the Namib\n\nHendrik Andersen and Jan Cermak\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 5461–5470, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-5461-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-5461-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFog and low clouds (FLCs) are a valuable source of water for many ecosystems in the Namib. This study presents the first fully diurnal satellite detection of FLCs, revealing the spatial and temporal patterns in the Namib. A validation is conducted against station measurements in the central Namib and shows a high overall accuracy. The average timing and persistence of FLCs seem to depend on the distance to the coast, suggesting that the region is dominated by advection-driven FLCs.\n\nSALSA2.0: The sectional aerosol module of the aerosolâchemistryâclimate model ECHAM6.3.0-HAM2.3-MOZ1.0\n\nHarri Kokkola, Thomas KÃ¼hn, Anton Laakso, Tommi Bergman, Kari E.

Schultz, Isabelle Bey, Philip Stier, Nikos Daskalakis, Colette L. Heald, and Sami Romakkaniemi\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 3833–3863, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-3833-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-3833-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we present a global aerosol–chemistry–climate model with the focus on its representation for atmospheric aerosol particles. In the model, aerosols are simulated using the aerosol module SALSA2.0, which in this paper is compared to satellite, ground, and aircraft-based observations of the properties of atmospheric aerosol. Based on this study, the model simulated aerosol properties compare well with the observations.\n\nThe chemistryâclimate model ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3-MOZ1.0\n\nMartin G. Schultz, Scarlet Stadtler, Sabine SchrÃ¶der, Domenico Taraborrelli, Bruno Franco, Jonathan Krefting, Alexandra Henrot, Sylvaine Ferrachat, Ulrike Lohmann, David Neubauer, Colombe Siegenthaler-Le Drian, Sebastian Wahl, Harri Kokkola, Thomas KÃ¼hn, Sebastian Rast, Hauke Schmidt, Philip Stier, Doug Kinnison, Geoffrey S. Tyndall, John J. Orlando, and Catherine Wespes\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 1695–1723, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-1695-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-1695-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe chemistry–climate model ECHAM-HAMMOZ contains a detailed representation of tropospheric and stratospheric reactive chemistry and state-of-the-art parameterizations of aerosols. It thus allows for detailed investigations of chemical processes in the climate system. Evaluation of the model with various observational data yields good results, but the model has a tendency to produce too much OH in the tropics. This highlights the important interplay between atmospheric chemistry and dynamics.\n\nAerosols at the poles: an AeroCom Phase II multi-model evaluation\n\nMaria Sand, BjÃ¸rn H. Samset, Yves Balkanski, Susanne Bauer, Nicolas Bellouin, Terje K. Berntsen, Huisheng Bian, Mian Chin, Thomas Diehl, Richard Easter, Steven J. Ghan, Trond Iversen, Alf KirkevÃ¥g, Jean-FranÃ§ois Lamarque, Guangxing Lin, Xiaohong Liu, Gan Luo, Gunnar Myhre, Twan van Noije, Joyce E. Penner, Michael Schulz, Ãyvind Seland, Ragnhild B. Skeie, Philip Stier, Toshihiko Takemura, Kostas Tsigaridis, Fangqun Yu, Kai Zhang, and Hua Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 12197–12218, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-12197-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-12197-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe role of aerosols in the changing polar climate is not well understood and the aerosols are poorly constrained in the models. In this study we have compared output from 16 different aerosol models with available observations at both poles. We show that the model median is representative of the observations, but the model spread is large. The Arctic direct aerosol radiative effect over the industrial area is positive during spring due to black carbon and negative during summer due to sulfate.\n\nUncertainty from the choice of microphysics scheme in convection-permitting models significantly exceeds aerosol effects\n\nBethan White, Edward Gryspeerdt, Philip Stier, Hugh Morrison, Gregory Thompson, and Zak Kipling\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 12145–12175, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-12145-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-12145-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosols influence cloud and precipitation by modifying cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNCs). We simulate three different types of convective cloud using two different cloud microphysics parameterisations. The simulated cloud and precipitation depends much more strongly on the choice of microphysics scheme than on CDNC. The uncertainty differs between types of convection. Our results highlight a large uncertainty in cloud and precipitation responses to aerosol in current models.\n\nImpacts of stratospheric sulfate geoengineering on tropospheric ozone\n\nLili Xia, Peer J. Nowack, Simone Tilmes, and Alan Robock\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 11913–11928, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-11913-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-11913-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOzone is a key air pollutant. We model two geoengineering schemes, stratospheric sulfur injection and solar irradiance reduction, to compare their impacts on atmospheric ozone concentrations. With the nearly identical global mean surface temperature reduction, solar dimming increases global average surface ozone concentration, while sulfate injection decreases it. This difference is due to different stratosphere–troposphere exchange of ozone and tropospheric ozone chemistry in the two scenarios.\n\nOn the spatio-temporal representativeness of observations\n\nNick Schutgens, Svetlana Tsyro, Edward Gryspeerdt, Daisuke Goto, Natalie Weigum, Michael Schulz, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 9761–9780, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-9761-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-9761-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe estimate representativeness errors in observations due to mismatching spatio-temporal sampling, on timescales of hours to a year and length scales of 50 to 200 km, for a variety of observing systems (in situ or remote sensing ground sites, satellites with imagers or lidar, etc.) and develop strategies to reduce them. This study is relevant to the use of observations in constructing satellite L3 products, observational intercomparison and model evaluation.\n\nUnderstanding the drivers of marine liquid-water cloud occurrence and properties with global observations using neural networks\n\nHendrik Andersen, Jan Cermak, Julia Fuchs, Reto Knutti, and Ulrike Lohmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 9535–9546, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-9535-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-9535-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol-cloud interactions continue to contribute large uncertainties to our climate system understanding. In this study, we use near-global satellite and reanalysis data sets to predict marine liquid-water clouds by means of artificial neural networks. We show that on the system scale, lower-tropospheric stability and boundary layer height are the main determinants of liquid-water clouds. Aerosols show the expected impact on clouds but are less relevant than some meteorological factors.\n\nEvaluating the diurnal cycle in cloud top temperature from SEVIRI\n\nSarah Taylor, Philip Stier, Bethan White, Stephan Finkensieper, and Martin Stengel\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 7035–7053, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-7035-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-7035-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVariability of convective cloud spans a wide range of temporal and spatial scales and is important for global weather and climate. This study uses satellite data from SEVIRI to quantify the diurnal cycle of cloud top temperatures over a large area. Results indicate that in some regions the diurnal cycle apparent in the observations may be significantly impacted by diurnal variability in the accuracy of the retrieval. These results may interest both the observation and modelling communities.\n\nDynamic subgrid heterogeneity of convective cloud in a global model: description and evaluation of the Convective Cloud Field Model (CCFM) in ECHAM6âHAM2\n\nZak Kipling, Philip Stier, Laurent Labbouz, and Till Wagner\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 327–342, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-327-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-327-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present the first evaluation of the convective cloud field model (CCFM) in the context of a global climate model. CCFM attempts to address some of the shortcomings of commonly used representations of convection, in particular allowing for physically based aerosol effects on different types of convective cloud. We show that the model performs well overall in the context of the climate model and is thus well placed to study aerosolâconvectionâclimate interactions at the global scale.\n\nEffect of aerosol subgrid variability on aerosol optical depth and cloud condensation nuclei: implications for global aerosol modelling\n\nNatalie Weigum, Nick Schutgens, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 13619–13639, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-13619-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-13619-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce a novel technique to isolate the effect of aerosol variability in models from other sources of variability by varying the resolution of aerosol and trace gas fields while maintaining a constant resolution in the rest of the model.\n\nOur results show that aerosol variability has a large impact on simulating aerosol climate effects, even when meteorology and dynamics are fixed. Processes most affected are gas-phase chemistry and aerosol uptake of water through equilibrium reactions.\n\nInverse modelling of KÃ¶hler theory â Part 1: A response surface analysis of CCN spectra with respect to surface-active organic species\n\nSamuel Lowe, Daniel G. Partridge, David Topping, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 10941–10963, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-10941-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-10941-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA novel inverse modelling framework is developed for analysing the sensitivity of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations to simultaneous perturbations in multiple model parameters at atmospherically relevant humidities. Many parameter interactions are identified and CCN concentrations are found to be relatively insensitive to bulk–surface partitioning, while aerosol concentration, surface tension, composition and solution ideality exhibit a higher degree of sensitivity.\n\nCommunity Intercomparison Suite (CIS) v1.4.0: a tool for intercomparing models and observations\n\nDuncan Watson-Parris, Nick Schutgens, Nicholas Cook, Zak Kipling, Philip Kershaw, Edward Gryspeerdt, Bryan Lawrence, and Philip Stier\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 9, 3093–3110, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-3093-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-3093-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we describe CIS, a new command line tool for the easy visualization, analysis and comparison of a wide variety of gridded and ungridded data sets used in Earth sciences. Users can now use a single tool to not only view plots of satellite, aircraft, station or model data, but also bring them onto the same spatio-temporal sampling. This allows robust, quantitative comparisons to be made easily. CIS is an open-source project and welcomes input from the community.\n\nLimitations of passive remote sensing to constrain global cloud condensation nuclei\n\nPhilip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 6595–6607, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-6595-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-6595-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCloud droplets form on suitable nuclei from aerosol emissions. Clouds with more droplets have higher reflectance so that aerosol emissions have a cooling climate effect. Numerous publications of these effects rely on passive satellite remote sensing. In this work I use a self consistent global aerosol model to show that a commonly used assumption (passively retrieved aerosol extinction is a suitable proxy for cloud condensation nuclei) is violated for a significant fraction of the Earth.\n\nWill a perfect model agree with perfect observations? The impact of spatial sampling\n\nNick A. J. Schutgens, Edward Gryspeerdt, Natalie Weigum, Svetlana Tsyro, Daisuke Goto, Michael Schulz, and Philip Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 6335–6353, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-6335-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-6335-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe show that evaluating global aerosol model data with observations of very different spatial scales (200 vs. 10 km) can lead to large discrepancies, solely due to different spatial sampling. Strategies for reducing these sampling errors are developed and tested using a set of high-resolution model simulations.\n\nStratospheric ozone changes under solar geoengineering: implications for UV exposure and air quality\n\nPeer Johannes Nowack, Nathan Luke Abraham, Peter Braesicke, and John Adrian Pyle\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 4191–4203, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-4191-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-4191-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVarious forms of solar radiation management (SRM) have been proposed to counteract man-made climate change. However, all these countermeasures could have unintended side-effects. We add a novel perspective to this discussion by showing how atmospheric ozone changes under solar geoengineering could affect UV exposure and air pollution. This would have implications for human health and ecology. Atmospheric composition changes are therefore important to consider in the evaluation of any SRM scheme.\n\nOn the characteristics of aerosol indirect effect based on dynamic regimes in global climate models\n\nShipeng Zhang, Minghuai Wang, Steven J. Ghan, Aijun Ding, Hailong Wang, Kai Zhang, David Neubauer, Ulrike Lohmann, Sylvaine Ferrachat, Toshihiko Takeamura, Andrew Gettelman, Hugh Morrison, Yunha Lee, Drew T. Shindell, Daniel G. Partridge, Philip Stier, Zak Kipling, and Congbin Fu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 2765–2783, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-2765-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-2765-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe variation of aerosol indirect effects (AIE) in several climate models is investigated across different dynamical regimes. Regimes with strong large-scale ascent are shown to be as important as stratocumulus regimes in studying AIE. AIE over regions with high monthly large-scale surface precipitation rate contributes the most to the total aerosol indirect forcing. These results point to the need to reduce the uncertainty in AIE in different dynamical regimes.\n\nWhat controls the vertical distribution of aerosol? Relationships between process sensitivity in HadGEM3âUKCA and inter-model variation from AeroCom Phase II\n\nZak Kipling, Philip Stier, Colin E. Johnson, Graham W. Mann, Nicolas Bellouin, Susanne E. Bauer, Tommi Bergman, Mian Chin, Thomas Diehl, Steven J. Ghan, Trond Iversen, Alf KirkevÃ¥g, Harri Kokkola, Xiaohong Liu, Gan Luo, Twan van Noije, Kirsty J. Pringle, Knut vonÂ Salzen, Michael Schulz, Ãyvind Seland, Ragnhild B. Skeie, Toshihiko Takemura, Kostas Tsigaridis, and Kai Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 2221–2241, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-2221-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-2221-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosol is an important factor in its effects on climate. In this study we use a sophisticated model of the many interacting processes affecting aerosol in the atmosphere to show that the vertical distribution is typically dominated by only a few of these processes. Constraining these physical processes may help to reduce the large differences between models. However, the important processes are not always the same for different types of aerosol.\n\nThe importance of temporal collocation for the evaluation of aerosol models with observations\n\nN. A. J. Schutgens, D. G. Partridge, and P. Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 1065–1079, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-1065-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-1065-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhen comparing models against observations, researchers often use long-term averages without due regard for the temporal sampling of the underlying data sets. We study the errors introduced by this practice and show they are often larger than observational errors and comparable to model errors. We further analyse what causes these errors and suggest best practices for eliminating them.\n\nWet scavenging limits the detection of aerosol effects on precipitation\n\nE. Gryspeerdt, P. Stier, B. A. White, and Z. Kipling\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 15, 7557–7570, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-7557-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-7557-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWet scavenging generates differences between the aerosol properties in clear-sky scenes (observed by satellites) and cloudy scenes, leading to different aerosol-precipitation relationships in satellite data and global models. Convective systems usually draw in air from clear-sky regions, but global models have difficulty separating this aerosol from the aerosol in cloudy scenes within a model gridbox. This may prevent models from reproducing the observed aerosol-precipitation relationships.\n\nModelled black carbon radiative forcing and atmospheric lifetime in AeroCom Phase II constrained by aircraft observations\n\nB.

Phys., 14, 12465–12477, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-14-12465-2014,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-14-12465-2014, 2014\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFar from black carbon (BC) emission sources, present climate models are unable to reproduce flight measurements. By comparing recent models with data, we find that the atmospheric lifetime of BC may be overestimated in models. By adjusting modeled BC concentrations to measurements in remote regions - over oceans and at high altitudes - we arrive at a reduced estimate for BC radiative forcing over the industrial era.\n\nA pathway analysis of global aerosol processes\n\nN. A. J. Schutgens and P. Stier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 14, 11657–11686, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-14-11657-2014,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-14-11657-2014, 2014\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe complexity of the physical and chemical processes effectively turns global aerosol models into black boxes. In an attempt to lift the veil, we present a detailed budget of process contributions (emissions, nucleation, sulfate condensation, coagulation, aging, deposition) in ECHAM5.5-HAM2 across varying length- and timescales. We show a clear hierarchy exists in process importance, that can be used in improving and simplifying the model and for understanding discrepancies with observation.\n\nLinks between satellite-retrieved aerosol and precipitation\n\nE.
