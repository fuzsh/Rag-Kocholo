        "text": "Schneider Electric, along with Stratus Technologies and Avnet Integrated, launched new zero-touch edge computing data centers to help industrial automation. The EcoStruxure Micro Data Center is manufactured and shipped with pre-loaded software when combined with the Stratus ftServer, for industrial applications that need always-on fault tolerance, an uninterruptible power supply, and cybersecurity protection.\n\nThe purpose-built Schneider Electric EcoStruxure Micro Data Center with Stratus ftServer is a pre-integrated enclosed rack system that provides power, cooling, security and monitoring for faster deployment and efficient management of edge computing infrastructure.\n\n“At Schneider Electric, we share a vision with Stratus and Avnet, which we believe will help customers transform their industrial operations and reap the benefits of digitalization,” said Rob McKernan, SVP, Secure Power Europe Region, Schneider Electric. “The standardized solutions we have co-developed significantly reduce the complexities associated with deploying critical IT in factory environments, freeing up valuable time and increasing process efficiency for our customers.”\n\nThe EcoStruxure Micro Data Center with Stratus ftServer enables enterprises to deploy data center computing power and storage to collect and process sensor data from equipment and processes. Some of the edge use cases for the Micro Data Center architecture include UOC for command centers and control rooms, manufacturing execution systems, asset management, and AI and machine learning.\n\nAlready tested and validated EcoStruxure Micro Data Center is available with pre-loading software, such as the AVEVA system platform. Schneider Electric has also provided physical protection on the enclosure with locks and card readers along with NetBotz security and environmental monitoring capabilities.\n\n“The EcoStruxure Micro Data Center with Stratus ftServer delivers the reliability, efficiency, rugged protection, and zero-touch operation required by the automation industry,” said Greg Hookings, director of business development for EMEA with Stratus Technologies. “It provides the ability to transform data from critical assets, securely, whether staff are operating at the edge or remotely.\n\nDevelopers can get hands-on experience with the EcoStruxure Micro Data Centre with the Stratus ftServer at hall 11, stand C58 at Hannover Messe 2022.\n\n“We are excited to be teaming with Schneider Electric and Stratus to successfully scale global deployment of the EcoStruxure Micro Data Center featuring ftServer solution for industrial edge applications,” said Brian Stack, senior director, Avnet Integrated EMEA.\n\nRelated\n\nArticle Topics\n\nAvnet | edge data center | industrial | manufacturing | Schneider Electric | Stratus | systems integration"
