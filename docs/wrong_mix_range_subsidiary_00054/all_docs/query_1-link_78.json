        "text": "The evaluation of an offeror's past performance, including the agency's determination of the relevance of an offeror's performance history and the weight to be assigned to a subcontractor's past performance, is a matter of agency discretion, which we will not find improper unless it is inconsistent with the solicitation's evaluation criteria. CLS Worldwide Support Servs., LLC, B-405298.2 et al., Sept. 11, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 257 at 15. The evaluation of past performance, by its very nature, is subjective and we will not substitute our judgment for reasonably based evaluation ratings; an offeror's disagreement with an agency's evaluation judgments does not demonstrate that those judgments are unreasonable. FN Mfg., LLC, B-402059.4, B-402059.5, Mar. 22, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 104 at 7.\n\nHere, we have no basis to question the agency's evaluation of VNT's past performance. VNT identified in its proposal five past performance references--three that stemmed from its own performance and two from its proposed subcontractor. AR, exh. 3, VNT Proposal, at 0073-77. With respect to its three projects, one--involving safety attendants at schools--was reasonably deemed not relevant; the other two projects--involving ambulette services--were considered relevant. AR, exh. 6, SSD, at 0230-31. Only one past performance questionnaire (PPQ) was returned for VNT's projects, which was for its performance on the predecessor contract to transport patients for the SAVAHCS. AR, exh. 3, VNT Proposal, at 0083-85.\n\nIn the PPQ, the contracting officer documented numerous concerns with respect to VNT's performance. He highlighted problems with the effectiveness of VNT's management, including \"several turnovers at the manager position,\" and the failure to pay subcontractors on time. Id. at 0084. He described VNT's quality as satisfactory, and noted that an 80-year old patient was injured because VNT had not followed procedures. Id. Other concerns focused on timeliness, quality control, and overall customer satisfaction, which was merely satisfactory. Id. at 0084-85. In addition, the contracting officer pointed to a fine imposed by the Department of Labor due to VNT's failure to pay its employees in accord with the Service Contract Act. Id. at 0085. In the end, he explained that VNT \"does not understand working with the federal government and the laws and regulations that go along with that,\" and has \"no concept of how to conform to a contract's terms and conditions.\" Id. The contracting officer wrote that he would not award the company another contract.\n\nThe contacting officer also considered additional information obtained from procurement files and his personal knowledge, specifically regarding VNT's performance on the predecessor contract. The contracting officer discussed in detail VNT's \"failure to perform the services under the contract,\" which resulted in the VA terminating VNT's contract for cause in June 2017. AR, exh. 6, SSD, at 0234. The contracting officer documented numerous examples of problems the agency experienced during VNT's performance, including an injured patient, failure to report an accident, and failure to meet transportation timelines. Id. According to the past performance record, VNT was given multiple letters of concern, a cure notice, and a show cause notice. Id. Ultimately, VNT \"abruptly ceased performance,\" which resulted in \"numerous patients . . . stranded at the hospital and up to 100 patients per day . . . in jeopardy of missing their scheduled appointments.\" Id. Hence, the contract was terminated for default.\n\nThe agency also took into account the past performance record of VNT's proposed subcontractor. Id. at 0234-35. While the subcontractor's record showed generally positive past performance, the agency nevertheless assigned little weight to the subcontractor's past performance. See id. at 0235-36. In this regard, the contracting officer explained that VNT failed to describe in its proposal the percentage of services that the subcontractor would provide. Id. at 0236. In addition, the contracting officer noted that VNT previously failed to timely pay its subcontractors, \"raising a question of how long the proposed subcontractor might actually perform work on this contract.\" Id. Based on the totality of the past performance record, including the consideration of somewhat positive PPIRS information, the contracting officer concluded that there was a \"low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.\" Id.\n\nHere, in light of the record described above, we have no basis to question the agency's limited confidence in VNT's performance. In addition, contrary to VNT's suggestions otherwise, the agency was under no obligation to afford greater weight to the subcontractor's performance record. In this respect, the significance of, and the weight to be assigned to, a subcontractor's past performance is a matter of contracting agency discretion. See Diversified Tech. & Servs. of Va., Inc., B-412090.2, B-412090.3, Dec. 16, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 34 at 6-7. Given that VNT failed to disclose what percentage of the effort its proposed subcontractor was to perform, the agency's consideration of VNT's subcontractor's performance record here is unobjectionable.\n\nMoreover, we see nothing improper with the contracting officer's consideration of VNT's poor performance on the predecessor effort. In this respect, as discussed above, the RFP expressly provided that the agency could consider \"other relevant information.\" RFP at 0148. Indeed, the agency may have had an obligation to take this information into account, given that the poor performance was on a contract for the same services for the same geographic location with the same contracting office. See, e.g., International Bus. Sys., Inc., B-275554, Mar. 3, 1997, 97-1 CPD ¶ 114 at 5; TRW, Inc., B-282162, B-282162.2, June 9, 1999, 99-2 CPD ¶ 12 at 5.\n\nLastly, and equally unavailing, is VNT's dubious assertion that the firm's past performance rating is the result of agency bias, which, according to VNT, is substantiated by the comprehensiveness of the documentation in the record. See Comments/Supp. Protest at 8. As we recently explained to VNT, government officials are presumed to act in good faith, and a protester's contention that contracting officials are motivated by bias or bad faith must be supported by convincing proof; we will not attribute unfair or prejudicial motives to procurement officials on the basis of inference or supposition. See Veteran Nat'l Transp., LLC, B-415011, Oct. 31, 2017, 2018 CPD ¶ 51 at 6; Career Innovations, LLC, B-404377.4, May 24, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 111 at 7-8. Here, the record is devoid of any support for VNT's bias claim. Indeed, rather than agency bias, VNT's poor performance on the incumbent effort is what led to its less than favorable past performance assessment. (Veteran National Transportation, LLC B-415696.2, B-415696.3: Apr 16, 2018)\n\nThe protester first alleges that the agency improperly attempted to contact only one of its eight past performance references--the one that responded positively following the agencys corrective action. Protesters Comments at 1-3. In support of this contention, GMCS points to the eight emails it provided with its initial protest that were from the past performance references identified in its proposal. GMCS also provides follow up emails from four of its past performance references in its comments on the agencys report. In these emails, the references continue to state that they were not contacted by the agency. Protesters Comments at 16-23.\n\nGMCS also disputes the agencys initial report of a negative reference from one of the eight references identified in its proposal. GMCS argues that this individual has maintained both in writing and by phone that he never communicated with the Agency or provided any feedback on GMCS performance to the Agency. Protesters Comments at 3. As a result, the protester argues that the agencys personnel have committed fraud by suggesting that they have contacted any of our past performance references, except [for the one] noted above. Protesters Comments at 3.\n\nIn response, the agency has provided an affidavit from the agency official who contacted the protesters references, the officials notes from her phone calls, and the underlying emails sent from the official to the protesters references. Declaration of Quality and Safety Manager, OAS, Dec. 4, 2017; AR, Tab 12, Agency Past Performance Notes. With regard to the individual the protester asserts was never contacted--that is, the individual that the agency claimed provided the negative review during the initial evaluation--the agency official explains that during the initial evaluation she emailed this individual, and subsequently spoke by phone with this individual. During this phone call, the individual provided a negative past performance review, which the agency official documented in her contemporaneous notes. AR, Tab 12, Agency Past Performance Notes, at 4. The agency explains that all subsequent attempts (following corrective action) to contact this individual were unsuccessful. While the protester asserts that the agency has misrepresented that it contacted this individual, and points to the email from its initial protest in which this person stated that no one from the agency had contacted him, we find that the agency has sufficiently demonstrated that it did, in fact, contact this individual, and find nothing improper about the agencys reliance on the negative past performance information it received. With regard to the second individual who the protester asserts was never contacted, the agency official explains that she attempted to email this individual, and never received a response. However, the record shows that the email address incorrectly spelled this individuals name, and thus it appears that the agencys attempt to email this individual was unsuccessful. Declaration of Quality and Safety Manager, OAS, Dec. 4, 2017, Email Attachment.\n\nThe record here shows that the agency either contacted, or attempted to contact, three of the eight past performance references provided by GMCS in its proposal. In addition, the record shows that the agency reached one of these references prior to the agencys corrective action. AR, Tab 19, Agency Past Performance Memorandum, at 1‑2. Following the agencys corrective action, the agency attempted to contact two additional organizations identified by GMCS in its proposal as past performance references. The record shows that the agency reached one of these references and recorded its input. Id. at 2‑3. Given this, we find the record does not support the protesters contention that the agency failed to contact any of its past performance references GMCS provided. To the extent the crux of the protesters complaint is that the agencys attempts to contact its references were inadequate, such that the agency was required to contact the other past performance references the protester had provided, there is no requirement that an agency contact all of an offerors references. See OMV Med., Inc.; Saratoga Med. Ctr., Inc., B‑281387 et al., Feb. 3, 1999, 99‑1 CPD ¶ 52 at 4. (Government and Military Certification Systems, Inc. B-414740.5: Dec 19, 2017)\n\nDynCorp objects to the three marginal ratings, arguing that the ratings are not supported by the record and are inconsistent with the CPARs. Protest at 15-22. DynCorp further contends that its overall satisfactory confidence rating is irrational because it is based on the agency's \"selective reliance on one-off comments\" made in the narrative portions of the CPARs or during the past performance interviews. Comments/Supp. Protest at 7.\n\nHere, we find reasonable the agency's evaluation of DynCorp's past performance. In this respect, the PPET's [past performance evaluation team] determination that DynCorp's past performance record included three adverse performance issues is unobjectionable. As noted above, the RFP defined adverse as \"past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comment received from sources without a formal rating system.\" RFP at 333. In this respect, contrary to DynCorp's arguments, the CPAR ratings alone did not control whether an offeror's past performance record included adverse issues. Instead, the record reflects that the evaluators considered various sources of information and reasonably reached the conclusion that DynCorp had not effectively implemented actions to remedy performance issues described in the CPARs.\n\n(sections deleted)\n\nThe evaluation of an offeror's past performance is within the discretion of the contracting agency, and we will not substitute our judgment for reasonably based past performance ratings. MFM Lamey Group, LLC, B-402377, Mar. 25, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 81 at 10. Where a solicitation calls for the evaluation of past performance, we will examine the record to ensure that the evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the solicitation's evaluation criteria and procurement statutes and regulations. Divakar Techs., Inc., B-402026, Dec. 2, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 247 at 5. In addition, the relative merits of an offeror's past performance information is generally within the broad discretion of the contracting agency. See Paragon Tech. Group, Inc., B-407331, Dec. 18, 2012, 2013 CPD ¶ 11 at 5. A protester's disagreement with the agency's judgment does not establish that an evaluation was unreasonable. FN Mfg., LLC, B-402059.4, B-402059.5, Mar. 22, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 104 at 7.\n\nOur review of the record confirms the reasonableness of the PPET's assessment. In this respect, the CPARs demonstrate that while DynCorp was lauded for certain aspects of its performance, supply support-related concerns were documented as well. For instance, in the 2011-2012 CPAR, in addition to the comments cited by the PPET, the CPAR evaluator noted that DynCorp's \"weakness lies in the areas of Aircraft Maintenance and Logistical Support.\" AR, Tab 17, DynCorp PPI for INL/A Contract, at 13. This same weakness regarding logistical support remained in the 2012-2013 CPAR, and the 2013-2014 CPAR highlighted the related concerns cited by PPET, discussed above. Id. at 18, 23. The CPARs did not include other comments relevant to the PPET's assessment under the supply support element or indicate that DynCorp's approach to logistics improved during performance. In fact, the PPET's March 2016 interview with the program COR (contracting officer's representative) discussed DynCorp's \"ongoing problem with supply support.\" Id. at 26. According to the interview record, the COR reported that DynCorp \"displayed a negative trend in providing parts and supply for the Beechcraft aircraft that were and are stationed in Afghanistan and Iraq.\" Id. The COR also relayed that the State Department created a position to specifically provide oversight and directives to DynCorp. Id. Thus, the record reflects that supply support remained an ongoing problem at the time the PPET conducted its evaluation.\n\nOn this record, we find unobjectionable the agency's assessment that the supply support element for DynCorp's INL/A contract reflected adverse performance, as defined in the RFP. While DynCorp disagrees with this determination, primarily contending that the firm never received less than satisfactory ratings on the CPARs, such disagreement does not demonstrate an unreasonable evaluation. See CLS Worldwide Support Servs., LLC, B-405298.2 et al., Sept. 11, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 257 at 15-16. Indeed, the entirety of the past performance record, including the narrative explanations in the CPARs and the interviews with INL/A officials, supports the reasonableness of the agency's evaluation. (DynCorp International LLC B-414647.2,B-414647.3: Nov 1, 2017)\n\nOur Office will question an agencys past performance evaluation where the record indicates that the agency either failed to evaluate, or otherwise unreasonably considered, the relevance of past performance references in accordance with the solicitations stated evaluation criteria. Arctic Slope Mission Servs., LLC, B-410992.5, B-410992.6, Jan. 8, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 39 at 12. Additionally, in reviewing an agencys evaluation of proposals, we consider not only whether the agency deviated from the RFP evaluation criteria, but also whether the actual evaluation was unreasonable. American Dev. Corp., B-251876.4, July 12, 1993, 93-2 CPD ¶ 49 at 10 (finding agency evaluation that divorced the contract performance rating from the relevancy rating to be unreasonable).\n\nBased on our review of the record, we conclude that the agencys past technical performance evaluation was unreasonable. The RFP here provided that the agency would first evaluate the relevancy of the past performance references submitted in the offerors past technical performance proposal as well as obtained through other means (PPIRS, interviews, etc.) and would next evaluate the quality of this past performance through a review of questionnaire responses and information available in CPARS. RFP at 177. The agency would then calculate the overall confidence rating based on the amount of experience, relevancy of that experience to the current requirement and quality of [the] offerors past performance. Id. Of note, the solicitation defined a substantial confidence rating as [b]ased on the offerors recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Id. Clearly, the RFP envisioned that the agency would make both relevancy and quality determinations for the past performances references submitted in USMMIs proposal, and that the agencys overall confidence assessment rating would be an integrated assessment based on these determinations.\n\nHere, however, the agency failed to make the dual determination envisioned by the RFP. Instead, the agency credited the orphan questionnaire ratings without examining the relevance of such ratings, and conversely credited the orphan relevance determinations without receiving information about the quality of USMMIs performance. All of these relevancy and quality ratings were then included in a general range of scores, and the agency determined subelement confidence ratings based on whether the range included high relevance or quality scores. The net effect of this was to distort the agencys evaluation because it added quality ratings of unknown relevance and relevancy determinations of unknown quality. This was inconsistent with the evaluation scheme, which anticipated that the agency would assess both the relevance and the quality of each past performance reference, and that the confidence assessment would examine the offerors recent/relevant performance to predict whether the offeror could successfully perform the required effort.\n\nFor instance, with regard to the subelement relating to lifecycle management experience providing maintenance and repair,[4] the agencys evaluation was as follows:\n\n2. Lifecycle Management\n\na. Experience, in the last five years, in executing lifecycle management programs to ensure:\n\ni. Adequate and timely maintenance and repair.\n\nUSMMI provided eight contracts as evidence of its experience for element 2(a)(i). USMMI demonstrated [it] has Relevant and Very Relevant experience for element 2(a)(i). See attachment A for the relevancy evaluation ratings and summary. Questionnaires were received from seven respondents that addressed element 2(a)(i). USMMI received questionnaire ratings ranging from Satisfactory to Very Good.\n\nBased on an evaluation of the offerors recent/relevant performance record for this element, USMMI received a rating of SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE for this element as the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.\n\nAR, Tab 8, Past Technical Performance Report, at AR0235. However, of the eight contracts noted above that were evaluated for relevancy, the agency only received three questionnaire scores. See AR, Tab 10, Past Technical Performance Report, at AR0248. Similarly, of the seven questionnaires received by the agency,[5] the agency only evaluated the relevance of three of the contracts. Compare id. with AR, Tab 9, Past Technical Performance Report, at AR0243. Removing these orphans, as well as the undocumented contract reference noted below, from the agencys assessment, would result in only two contract references where the agency possessed both relevance and questionnaire ratings. Both of these references were found to be relevant and satisfactory. Accordingly, had the agencys evaluation considered only these two contracts, rather than the numerous references quoted above, the agency may have reached a different conclusion with regard to its subelement confidence assessment.[6]\n\nTOTE next argues that the agency improperly determined that the only submitted contract on which USMMI was the prime contractor, the [DELETED] contract, was very relevant under five of the past technical performance subelements.[7] In this regard, the solicitation defined very relevant under each subelement as having the same experience as that called for under the solicitations scope of work. For instance, a determination of very relevant under subelement 2(a)(i) was defined as follows:\n\nRFP, Attach. N. For each of the five subelements in question, USMMIs proposal narrative submitted the [DELETED] contract for each subelement but did not specifically explain how the contract met the specific relevancy criteria. See AR, Tab 11, USMMI Vol. 2, at AR0264-276. For instance, for subelement 2(a)(i), USMMIs proposal narrative contained a general discussion of its maintenance experience, but did not contain any explanation of how the [DELETED] contract involved maintenance and repair on systems that were the same as those on the SBX-1. See id. at AR0269.\n\nIn response to this argument, the agency concedes that three of the subelement relevancy ratings were incorrect and should have been rated relevant rather than very relevant, though the agency contends these errors were harmless.[8] The agency further asserts that the five subelement relevancy determinations were made based on the personal knowledge of the agencys evaluators, who had general and direct knowledge of the [DELETED] contract and were therefore familiar with its systems. Supp. MOL at 9.\n\nWhile, as a general matter, the evaluation of an offerors past performance is within the discretion of the contracting agency, we will question an agencys evaluation of past performance where it is unreasonable or undocumented. Solers, Inc., B-404032.3, B-404032.4, Apr. 6, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 83 at 8. Although an agency is not required to retain every document generated during its evaluation of proposals, the agencys evaluation must be sufficiently documented to allow our Office to review the merits of a protest. Apptis, Inc., B-299457 et al., May 23, 2007, 2008 CPD ¶ 49 at 10. Where an agency fails to document or retain evaluation materials, it bears the risk that there may not be an adequate supporting rationale in the record for us to conclude that the agency had a reasonable basis for its source selection decision. TriCenturion, Inc.; SafeGuard Services, LLC, B-406032 et al., Jan. 25, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 52 at 13.\n\nHere, we find the agencys evaluation was not sufficiently documented to allow us to determine whether the agencys conclusions were reasonable. In this regard, while the agency asserted that its evaluators relied on their personal knowledge of the [DELETED] contract, this assertion is not supported in the contemporaneous record and does not explain the agencys admitted mistake with respect to three of the five subelement relevancy determinations. Moreover, for the five subelements in question, the contemporaneous record does not contain any information regarding the systems in place on the [DELETED] vessels, or how such systems compare to the corresponding system on the SBX-1 vessel.\n\nIn addition, the agencys explanation that it relied on its evaluators knowledge is inconsistent with the past technical performance evaluation report. The report points to USMMIs proposal narrative as the source of the agencys relevancy determinations; the report does not state that such relevancy determinations were made based on the evaluators personal knowledge of the contract. See AR, Tab 9, Past Technical Performance Chart, at AR0242-245. Accordingly, we find that the contemporaneous record does not contain sufficient documentation for us to determine the reasonableness of the agencys relevancy determinations with respect to the five subelements in question. (TOTE Services, Inc. B-414295, B-414295.2: Apr 25, 2017)\n\nPast Performance\n\nThe protesters challenge the agencys past performance evaluation in many respects. As set forth below, our Office identified a number of concerns with the agencys evaluation of proposals under this factor, and therefore sustain several of the protests challenging the agencys evaluation. Some of the errors appear to have impacted the evaluation of several proposals. In such circumstances, we address below the nature of the concern and highlight representative examples. In other instances, the errors appear to have been unique to individual proposals.\n\nAs a general matter, we will review an agencys past performance evaluation to determine whether the evaluation was conducted fairly, reasonably, and in accordance with the solicitations evaluation scheme. Logistics Mgmt. Intl, Inc., et al., B-411015.4 et al., Nov. 20, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 356 at 8. We will question an agencys evaluation conclusions where they are unreasonable or undocumented. OSI Collection Servs., Inc., B-286597, B-286597.2, Jan. 17, 2001, 2001 CPD ¶ 18 at 22. On the other hand, a protesters disagreement with the agencys judgment, without more, is insufficient to establish that an evaluation was improper. Beretta USA Corp., B‑406376.2, B-406376.3, July 12, 2013, 2013 CPD ¶ 186 at 10. Additionally, it is fundamental that a contracting agency must treat all offerors equally, and therefore it must evaluate offers evenhandedly against common requirements and evaluation criteria. Logistics Mgmt. Intl, Inc., et al., supra, at 16.\n\nEvaluation of Past Performance Information\n\nThe agency appears in several circumstances to have unreasonably either ignored or discounted relevant information bearing on the quality of offerors past performance if it was not included in a CPARS report. For example, DMA identified three student loan collection references, its incumbent contract (for which the agency has a CPAR report) and two contracts with commercial entities. The TEC rated all the references as highly relevant. Under the quality subfactor, however, the agency appears to have only considered the incumbent contract. The TEC noted that DMA had received a satisfactory quality rating on its most recent CPARS report, and compared favorably against other incumbents due to its low error rate under the agencys 2015 focused review for regulatory compliance. Based on this one reference, the TEC concluded that [t]he satisfactory past performance rating received [on the incumbent contract] demonstrates that [DMA] performed at an acceptable level and that there is high confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the PWS requirements as outlined in the solicitation with minimum risk. Consolidated AR, Tab 68, DMA TEC Report, at 1-2.\n\nAbsent from the TECs analysis, however, is the agencys consideration of the quality of DMAs performance on its other two highly relevant contracts. The contemporaneous record (and the agencys response to the protest) is devoid of any indication that the agency considered the detailed information in DMAs proposal regarding these past performance references, or made any effort to contact DMAs references to inquire about the quality of the protesters performance. In this regard, we note that DMAs proposal includes detailed information supporting the quality of its performance on the contracts. See, e.g., Consolidated AR, Tab 29, DMA Proposal  § B, at 33 (noting the customers prior exceptional rating on another DOE past performance questionnaire), 37 (including a recommendation letter for the second contract).\n\nAs another example, with respect to TGSL, the firm identified, as one of its three past performance references, its performance as a subcontractor in connection with the incumbent requirements. With respect to this reference, the TEC found that TG[SL] did not provide indicators of performance quality. TGSL AR, Tab P, TGSL TEC Report, at 2. The record, however, does not support this evaluation finding. Rather, the record reflects that the agency had past performance information from the prime incumbent contractor concerning TGSLs subcontractor performance. Specifically, the prime contractor advised that: TG[SL] continues to perform at a high level while maintaining thorough compliance and zero complaints for the pool of accounts they are servicing . . . [we are] extremely happy with TG[SL]s service, training, and overall collections as a current subcontractor on our Task Order. TGSL AR, Tab O, Email from TGSL Past Performance Reference, at 1-2. We have previously explained that an agencys past performance evaluation is unreasonable where the agency fails to give meaningful consideration to available relevant past performance information. See, e.g., Shaw-Parsons Infrastructure Recovery Consultants, LLC; Vanguard Recovery Assistance, JV, B-401679.4 et al., Mar. 10, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 77 at 8 (sustaining protests where agency failed to reasonably consider past performance questionnaires); DRS C3 Sys., LLC, B‑310825, B‑310825.2, Feb. 26, 2008, 2008 CPD ¶ 103 at 26 (same regarding a CPARS report).\n\nThis pattern by the agency of neglecting to consider, or unreasonably discounting, relevant past performance information, based on what appears to be the agencys fixation on CPARS reports to the exclusion of other past performance information, is further highlighted by the agencys evaluation of the past performance of VRH, one of the awardees. VRH submitted three past performance references; one was for performance of the incumbent contract as a subcontractor, and the other two were student loan debt collection contracts with commercial entities. See GRC AR, Tab Q, VRH TEC Report, at 1. Although the TEC evaluated VRHs two commercial contracts as highly relevant, it did not consider the quality of VRHs performance on these contracts. Instead, the TEC focused on CPARS reports for contract references not identified by VRH. Specifically, it focused on VRHs performance of a contract with the Department of Energy, which was for professional support services, including financial analysis and the development of policy recommendations, relating to the evaluation and award of direct loans and loan guarantees to applicants seeking funding for the commercialization of technologies in the automotive, renewable and conventional energy fields. GRC AR, Tab M, VRH Past Performance Information, at 2. The record, however, lacks any analysis of how this Department of Energy reference was relevant to the student loan debt collection activities contemplated under this RFP, or any explanation for why the agency eschewed consideration of the highly relevant references cited by VRH. Here again, it is apparent that the agency unreasonably relied almost exclusively upon CPARS reports in lieu of reasonably considering available past performance information, which the agency itself identified as being highly relevant.

Comments at 15-22; Supp. Comments at 27-40. As related to this allegation, the record reflects that the agency evaluated more than 200 of Crowleys past efforts. AR, Tab 119, Crowley Past Performance Summary Addendum, at 2-34. Of these efforts, 16 were found somewhat relevant. Id. All of the others were found not relevant. Id. After completing its relevancy evaluation, the agency determined that the 16 somewhat relevant efforts, combined, supported an overall past performance confidence assessment rating of satisfactory confidence. Id. at 35.\n\nXPO argues that the 16 efforts assessed as somewhat relevant were too miniscule compared to the current procurement to merit such a rating. Comments at 19. To illustrate, XPO analyzed the relative magnitude of 15 past efforts deemed somewhat relevant by calculating each efforts value as a percentage of the $3 billion maximum value of the contract awarded under the solicitation. Id. at 20‑21. The calculations show that the value of one Crowley effort was approximately 2 percent of this procurements $3 billion maximum value, one effort was approximately 1 percent of the maximum value, and all 13 of the other efforts had values of less than 1 percent of this procurements maximum value.[10] Comments at 20-21. Based on this disparity in values, XPO argues that the agencys assessment of the efforts as somewhat relevant was unreasonable. Id. at 21. XPO further argues that because the efforts should not have been found somewhat relevant, the satisfactory confidence rating assigned to Crowleys proposal was improper. Id.\n\nIn response, the agency argues that XPOs comparison of the value of Crowleys efforts to the total value of this procurement is flawed. Supp. AR at 15-16. The proper comparison, according to the agency, begins with a calculation of a value per year equivalency for each of Crowleys past efforts. Id. at 15. This amounts to an average annual value of each effort, calculated by dividing the efforts total value by the total months of performance, then multiplying that number by 12. Id. at 16. After presenting these calculations, the agency argues that its evaluation was reasonable because the aggregate of the average annual value of 12 of the Crowley efforts exceeds $[DELETED]. Id. The agency chooses $[DELETED] as its benchmark because this figure is the maximum value for the transportation CLIN for the 2-year base period of the contract awarded to Crowley under the solicitation. Id. (citing AR, Tab 122, Crowley Contract, at 3). The agency justifies its choice of this value--rather than the significantly higher total contract value, or any of the significantly higher-valued option periods--on the basis that the option years only reflect potential contract value if additional military services use the contract. Id. at 17.\n\nAs explained in detail below, the agencys response is problematic for a number of reasons. First, the analysis presented by the agency is not reflected in the contemporaneous record. In addition, the agencys selection of only the relatively low‑value base period of the contract as awarded to Crowley unreasonably distorts the comparison of the magnitude of Crowleys past efforts to the magnitude of the solicitation.\n\nBefore proceeding further, we observe that as a general matter, the evaluation of an offerors past performance is within the discretion of the contracting agency, and we will not substitute our judgment for reasonably based past performance ratings. See Al Raha Grp. for Tech. Servs., Inc.; Logistics Mgmt. Intl, Inc., B-411015.2, B‑411015.3, Apr. 22, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 134 at 5. However, we will question an agencys evaluation conclusions where they are unreasonable or undocumented. See id. The critical question is whether the evaluation was conducted fairly,\n\nreasonably, and in accordance with the solicitations evaluation scheme. See id. Finally, we have found the assessment of a somewhat relevant rating to an offerors past effort to be unreasonable where the solicitation requires the agency to consider the magnitude of the past effort compared to the solicited requirement, and the agency fails to reasonably explain why a past effort involving a minimal amount of the requirement justifies such a rating. See id. at 7-8; Health Net Fed. Servs., LLC, B-401652.3, B-401652.5, Nov. 4, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 220 at 17; see also Si-Nor, Inc., B-292748.2 et al., Jan. 7, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 10 at 17 (low dollar value of awardees past effort showed agencys determination that the effort was similar to the solicited requirement to be unreasonable); Contl RPVs, B‑292768.2, B‑292768.3, Dec. 11, 2003, 2004 CPD ¶ 56 at 12 (agencys conclusion that the awardees past effort was similar to the solicited requirement was unreasonable because the past effort involved less than three percent of the solicited requirement).\n\nReturning to the merits of the protest here, we begin with the solicitations evaluation criteria for the past performance factor. As stated at the outset, the solicitation provided that the agency would evaluate the relevancy of each past performance effort submitted by an offeror. RFP at 53 (emphasis in original). The solicitation defined the relevancy ratings to be assigned to each past performance effort as follows:\n\nId. These definitions show that to warrant a rating of somewhat relevant, an effort must involve some of the magnitude of effort required under the solicitation. The definitions further show that if an effort involved little or none of the solicitations magnitude, a rating of not relevant was appropriate. At issue here is whether the relatively low value of Crowleys past efforts renders unreasonable the agencys conclusion that Crowleys efforts involved some of the solicitations magnitude.\n\nWe begin our analysis by noting that it is not clear from the contemporaneous record how the agency determined that the magnitude of Crowleys past efforts supported the ratings of somewhat relevant. In this regard, the past performance evaluation report for Crowley shows the following information for most of the past efforts at issue: the number of monthly shipping transactions, the period of performance, and an approximate total value. AR, Tab 119, Crowley Past Performance Summary Addendum, 2-29. However, there is no evidence that the agency calculated an average annual value for the efforts in order to make an apples-to-apples comparison of the efforts magnitude relative to the magnitude of the solicitation; i.e., there is no evidence that the agency employed the methodology that it has argued to be the appropriate methodology in response to XPOs protest. There also is nothing in Crowleys past performance evaluation report to reflect what benchmarks might have been used to assess whether Crowleys past efforts met the criteria for the various relevancy ratings defined in the solicitation. While such benchmarks might have included the total or average annual dollar value of an effort (or the number of total or monthly shipment transactions under the effort[11]), it is not evident if or how the agency took this information into consideration.\n\nWe turn now to the agencys argument that the evaluation was reasonable because the sum of the average annual value of 12 Crowley past efforts exceeds the $[DELETED] maximum value of the transportation CLIN for the 2‑year base period of the contract awarded to Crowley. The agencys argument is based on the general proposition that where the period of performance of an offerors past effort materially differs from the period of performance in a solicitation, some method of making an apples-to-apples comparison of the magnitude of the two efforts is necessary. We agree with the agency that to make such an apples-to-apples comparison, it may be appropriate to consider the average annual value of an offerors past efforts. Under a solicitation with numerous option years with significantly differing values, such as the one here, the question becomes, what annual value under the solicitation should be used as the basis of comparison--the smaller value at the start of performance, or the significantly higher values anticipated in the later years? Here, the value the agency has chosen is the base period of Crowleys contract, as awarded. As explained below, given the circumstances of this procurement, we find the agencys choice unreasonable.\n\nThe record reflects that the agency prepared an IGCE that included projections of the value of each period of performance under the solicitation. AR, Tab 3, ICGE, at 4‑7; AR, Tab 4, DFTS Acquisition Strategy Panel Slides, at 4. The table below shows these values, as well as the maximum values for each period of performance in Crowleys contract, as awarded.\n\nSee AR, Tab 4, DFTS Acquisition Strategy Panel Slides, at 4; AR, Tab 122, Crowley Contract, at 3-9. The table shows that [DELETED]. It also shows that the value of each option year is significantly higher than the value of the base period. The IGCE explained that this increase was due to the potential addition of military users of the contract. AR, Tab 3, IGCE, at 2. The IGCE explained the basis for including the additional military users as follows:\n\nThere is currently a concerted effort for the [Department of Defense] to move away from awarding non-FAR based tenders for freight transportation. As there are no known feasible acquisition alternatives, it seems reasonable that the military services might opt to be included as customers under [the] DFTS [contract].\n\nId. Thus, the record reflects that the agency anticipated the value of the option years to be significantly higher than the value of the base period--both at the time it prepared the IGCE and when it awarded Crowleys contract. The record also reflects that the agency included option year pricing in its calculation of the offerors total evaluated prices and that the SSA considered the offerors total evaluated price in his tradeoff decision. RFP at 54, 653; AR, Tab 120, SSDD, at 5‑6. For all of these reasons, we find the agencys selection of the significantly lower-valued transportation CLIN for the base period of Crowleys contract to be an unreasonable benchmark for assessing the relevance of the magnitude of Crowleys past efforts.\n\nThe question of which annual value is selected as a comparative benchmark has a material effect on whether Crowleys past efforts reasonably can be assessed as somewhat relevant versus not relevant. For instance, if the annual value of the base period of Crowleys contract is used (as the agency has proposed), the value of 2 of the 12 Crowley past efforts at issue are in the range of 60 to 70 percent of the solicited requirement, 2 are in the range of 25 to 35 percent, 6 hover in the range of 10 to 15 percent, while the final 2 are approximately 5 and 0.5 percent. See Supp. Comments at 37-38. Some of these figures could support assessments of somewhat relevant. As discussed above, however, we conclude that using only the base period of Crowleys contract is not reasonable under the circumstances here.\n\nOne reasonable benchmark under the circumstances here could be the average value of each year of performance (including options) of the contract. When the average value of each year of performance is used as the benchmark, 2 of Crowleys past efforts are approximately 10 percent of the solicited effort, 2 are in the range of 4 to 6 percent, while the others are approximately 2 percent or less. See Supp. Comments at 35-36. As discussed above, the solicitations distinction between the ratings of somewhat relevant and not relevant was whether the effort involved some versus little or none of the solicitations effort. While the 2 efforts involving 10 percent of the requirements average annual effort might reasonably be assessed as involving some of the effort, the vast majority of Crowleys efforts involve 6 percent or less of the effort. Under the ratings definitions established by the solicitation, this level of effort appears to be more closely aligned with an assessment of little or none of the requirement, which would result in ratings of not relevant.\n\nAs established above, it is not clear from the contemporaneous record how the agency concluded that Crowleys past efforts supported ratings of somewhat relevant. Additionally, the evaluation methodology that the agency has advanced in response to XPOs protest uses only the value of the base period as a comparative benchmark, despite the agencys estimates--both at the time of preparing the IGCE and at the time of awarding Crowleys contract--that the option years would be of significantly higher values. In addition, this approach is inconsistent with the agencys decision to include option year pricing in the offerors total evaluated prices, and to consider the offerors total evaluated prices in the tradeoff decision. In sum, the value of Crowleys past efforts are extremely small relative to the value of the requirement, indicating that the agencys assessment of ratings of somewhat relevant to these efforts was misplaced. For these reasons, we sustain XPOs allegation regarding this aspect of the evaluation.\n\nBefore concluding, we note XPO also argues that the agencys evaluation of several of Crowleys past efforts was unreasonable because these efforts involved very low numbers of shipments per month or, in the case of an effort that was evaluated for the use of special equipment, because the record lacks specific information regarding Crowleys experience. Comments at 22; Supp. Comments at 39-40. We have considered the agencys responses to these allegations and we find, based on the record, that these allegations also have merit. However, we do not discuss these allegations in detail because the issues raised necessarily would be addressed through the implementation of our recommendation--discussed below--that the agency reevaluate Crowleys past performance in a manner that is reasonable and consistent with both the solicitation and this decision.\n\nFinally, we note that XPO argues that it was improper for the agency to aggregate Crowleys past performance efforts in its determination of Crowleys overall confidence assessment rating. Comments at 17-19; Supp. Comments at 27-30. We do not reach this issue because the record does not support the agencys findings that Crowleys past performance efforts were somewhat relevant, which should be a prerequisite to aggregating the results. (XPO Logistics Worldwide Government Services, LLC, B-412628.6, B-412628.7: Mar 14, 2017)\n\nCSR protests the agencys evaluation of its past performance. Specifically, the protester contends that the agency unreasonably failed to consider all available assessment reports when assessing the quality of its past performance. CSR also alleges that the agencys evaluation of its past performance was disparate from how the agency treated BAH. CSR argues that had the agency performed a proper evaluation, it would have received an exceptional past performance rating, equal to that of BAH (on which the agency relied when making its best-value decision). As detailed below, we find the agencys evaluation of CSRs past performance was unreasonable because it was unequal with how the agency treated BAH.\n\nIn reviewing a protesters challenge to an agencys evaluation of vendors past performance, our Office does not independently evaluate quotations; rather, we review the agencys evaluation to ensure that it is reasonable and consistent with the terms of the solicitation and applicable statutes and regulations.

RFQ at 31-32. The solicitation advised vendors that the Government may use all data provided by the Offeror in this quote and data obtained from other sources, including, but not limited to, other DOJ and OJP contracts and information from Government repositories . . . . Id. at 32. The RFQ also established that the agency would assess both the relevance and quality of each vendors past performance in order to assess the probability of successful performance. Id.\n\nCSR submitted six past performance references--four for itself and two for proposed subcontractor [DELETED]--using the RFQ-allotted pages. AR, Tab 7, CSR Quotation, Vol. I, Technical, at 373-79. Three of CSRs references concerned task orders involving PMT services previously performed for DOJs OJP. Id. at 373-74.\n\nThe TEB, when evaluating CSRs past performance, assessed the relevance of the vendors prior work based on the information provided by CSR in its quotation. AR, Tab 14, TEB Report, at 641. When assessing the quality of CSRs prior work, the evaluators took into account three Contractor Performance Assessment Reports (CPAR) regarding the OJP task orders that CSR had referenced in its quotation. AR, Tab 9, CSR CPARs, at 573-80. Overall, the TEB found all of CSRs references to be relevant and the quality of the vendors prior work to be mixed, and rated the protesters past performance as acceptable. AR, Tab 14, TEB Report, at 641.\n\nCSR argues that the agency unreasonably failed to consider other relevant CPARs regarding its past performance, and all involving DOJ. The protester points to two earlier CPARs involving its first referenced OJP task order, as well as a CPARs for another relevant project (i.e., research, evaluation, and performance measurement services) not listed as a reference in its quotation (the three additional CPARs identified by CSR were uniformly of high quality). Protest, exh. 4, CSR CPARs, at 1-11. The protester contends that this additional past performance information was relevant, too close at hand for the agency to ignore as part of its evaluation, and would have affected the assigned past performance rating. Supp. Protest, at 9.\n\nThe agency asserts that, when retrieving CPARs, it limited its search to only those specific projects that were identified by the vendors in their quotations, and only the most recent CPARs that were available for those projects. COS, Dec. 22, 2016, at 2. As CSR had identified three specific OJP task orders in its quotation, the agency states, the contract specialist pulled only the most recent CPARs for each of those referenced task orders. Id. The agency also states that it did not consider the three other CPARs which CSR points to in its protest because two were older reports for a referenced project, and the other was not considered because it was not among the past performance projects that CSR identified in its quotation. Id.\n\nThe record reflects, however, that in conducting its past performance evaluation of BAH, the agency considered CPARs for past performance projects that were not identified in the awardees quotation. BAH submitted six past performance references for itself and its proposed subcontractors in its quotation. AR, Tab 4, BAH Quotation, Vol. I, Technical, at 189-95. Relevant to the protest here, one of BAHs references was for its law enforcement systems analysis (LESA) project for the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Id. at 190. BAHs quotation also detailed the relevance of its LESA project to the PMT work to be performed here. Id. at 193-94.\n\nThe agency considered three CPARs when evaluating BAHs past performance--two of which concerned projects referenced in the vendors quotation. AR, Tab 6, BAH CPARS, at 300-312. The third CPARs, however, involved BAH providing support services to ICE at its Pacific Enforcement Response Center (PERC). Id. at 304-06. The record indicates that BAHs LESA project and its PERC support services effort were different task orders issued under the same contract with ICE: in addition to involving different types of work, the projects also had different award dates, performance periods, dollar values, performance locations, and contracting officers. Compare AR, Tab 4, BAH Quotation, Vol. I, Technical, at 190, with AR, Tab 6, BAH CPARs, at 304.\n\nThe TEB thereafter found all of the past performance references in BAHs quotation to be relevant, and the CPARs to be uniformly of high quality, and rated the awardee as exceptional. AR, Tab 14, TEB Report, at 635. The record does not indicate that the TEB members, when evaluating BAHs past performance, were aware that one of the CPAR reports on which they based their evaluation of BAHs performance quality was for a project other than the identified references on which they had assessed BAHs past performance relevance. See id.\n\nWe have previously found nothing improper in an agencys decision to limit its review of past performance information in various ways. In this regard, an agency has the discretion to determine the scope of the past performance history to be considered, provided all quotations are evaluated on the same basis and the evaluation is consistent with the terms of the solicitation. See Hygeia Solutions Partners, LLC; STG, Inc., B-411459 et al., July 30, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 244 at 13; Weidlinger Assocs., Inc., B-299433, B-299433.2, May 7, 2007, 2007 CPD ¶ 91 at 8. Here, however, the record reflects that vendors past performance history was not evaluated on the same basis, and that the agency engaged in disparate treatment of CSR.\n\nAs set forth above, the agencys evaluation of CSRs past performance was based on only the most recent CPARs for those specific projects identified by the vendor in its quotation. However, when evaluating BAHs past performance, the agency considered CPARs for other than the specific projects that BAH had identified in its quotation. Specifically, the PERC support services CPARs at issue here did not involve one of the projects that BAH referenced in its quotation. It was an entirely different project than the LESA effort that BAH had performed for ICE. Quite simply, to the extent that the agencys past performance evaluation of BAH considered CPARs for other than the projects specifically referenced by the awardee in its quotation, the agency was required to do the same when evaluating CSRs past performance. As the agency was required to treat vendors equally and evaluate past performance evenhandedly, and failed to do so here, the agencys actions were disparate and unreasonable.\n\nThe agency does not dispute that BAHs referenced LESA effort and the evaluated PERC effort were different projects, or that its evaluation took into account the CPARs for BAHs PERC project. The agency nonetheless argues that its actions were not unfair or disparate because the referenced and evaluated projects bore the same contract number, and because the agency record . . . do[es] not support a conclusion that [the] assessment of work under the same contract number was wholly irrelevant to the evaluation of BAHs past performance. Memorandum of Law, Jan. 5, 2017, at 2. We find these contentions unconvincing. The fact that the LESA and PERC efforts may have been performed under the same overarching contract vehicle does not alter the fact that they were different projects, and the agency had previously decided that only the CPARs for the specific projects that were identified by the offerors in their quotations would be considered. COS, Dec. 22, 2016, at 2. Furthermore, the agencys assertion that BAHs PERC project was not wholly irrelevant misses the point: if the agency wanted to consider relevant CPARs for other than for the projects referenced for BAH, it was then required to do the same for CSR (or any other vendor). Because the agency failed to consider all available, relevant CPARs when evaluating CSR, it failed to take into account information that may have affected the agencys evaluation rating. (CSR, Inc. B-413973, B-413973.2: Jan 13, 2017)\n\nThe only remaining question is whether the 6th Floor Project was complete at the time of the evaluation. The CPARS evaluation indicates that the project was only 45 percent complete during the period assessed (November 2012 through April 2014), AR, Tab 13, CPARS, at 1, and there is no evidence in the record that the Navy obtained any additional information indicating that the project had been completed prior to the Navys evaluation here. Moreover, in its protest, Halbert asserted that the project was not complete, Protest at 8, and the agency never disputed that assertion in its responses, see generally, COS/MOL at 15-16; Supp. MOL at 3. Thus, the record establishes that the project was not 100 percent complete as defined by the solicitation here.\n\nThe Navy, however, contends that this relevancy criterion did not apply to information obtained by the agency, but rather, applied only to information submitted by the offeror. Supp. MOL at 3 (explaining that the Solicitation required offerors to submit projects that were 100% complete[,] but that this requirement for completeness did not apply to information found from other sources such as the PPIRS[.]). The Navy further contends that it was entitled to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources[.] Id. (citing RFP at 36). Accordingly, the Navy argues that it was appropriate for it to obtain and consider interim CPARS evaluations regarding incomplete projects. Id. at 4.\n\nAs a general matter, an agency is not precluded from considering any relevant information, regardless of its source, and is not limited to considering only the information provided within the four corners of an offerors proposal when evaluating past performance. Al Raha Grp. for Tech. Servs., Inc., supra at 10 (citing FAR § 15.306(a)(2)(ii)); Paragon Sys., Inc., B‑299548.2, Sept. 10, 2007, 2007 CPD ¶ 178 at 8. Here, the solicitation also notified offerors that the past performance evaluation would not be limited to a review of the information provided in the offerors proposals, but that the agency could also obtain and review past performance information from other sources. RFP at 36. Accordingly, we agree with the Navy that it was permitted to obtain and consider information from other sources.\n\nOur Office will question an agencys past performance evaluation where the record indicates that the agency either failed to evaluate, or otherwise unreasonably considered, the relevance of past performance references in accordance with the solicitations stated evaluation criteria. Rotech Healthcare, Inc., supra, at 5‑6; Artic Slope Mission Servs., LLC, B‑410992.5, B‑410992.6, Jan. 8, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 39 at 12; Al Raha Grp. for Tech. Servs., Inc. supra, at 6. This is true whether the information is furnished by the offeror or obtained independently by the agency. Al Raha Grp. for Tech. Servs., Inc., supra, at 8-12 (sustaining protest because information independently obtained by the agency failed to satisfy the RFPs recency and relevance criteria); Logistics Mgmt. Intl, Inc., supra, at 14-16.\n\nHere, even if we accept, for the sake of argument, the Navys contention that the RFPs relevancy criteria did not apply to information independently obtained by the agency, we find that the Navy did not treat offerors equally in this regard. The record reflects that, in evaluating the past performance of Offeror 7, the TET found that one of the 23 evaluations in the PPIRS database for Offeror 7 demonstrated relevant adverse past performance. AR, Tab 7, TET Report, at 22. Despite this conclusion, however, the TET did not assign Offeror 7s proposal a weakness for this project. Id. at 23. Likewise, the project is not mentioned in the Navys tradeoff analysis. AR, Tab 9, SSAC Report, at 5. The contemporaneous record suggests that the project was not considered by the Navy.\n\nAfter Halbert challenged this aspect of the Navys evaluation, Comments at 5‑6, the Navy responded that the TETs statement was a typographical error and that, indeed, Offeror 7s project was not considered by the agency in its past performance evaluation because it did not meet the solicitations criteria for relevancy. Supp. MOL at 2 n.1. Specifically, the Navy alleges the project is not relevant because the dollar value fell below the solicitations $3 million minimum construction cost requirement. Id.\n\nThus, the record reflects that the agency did not consider Offeror 7s adverse performance on a project because the agency concluded that it did not satisfy the RFPs relevancy criteria, while simultaneously considering Halberts adverse performance on a project that did not satisfy the RFPs relevancy criteria. It is fundamental that a contracting agency treat all offerors equally, and therefore, it must evaluate offers evenhandedly against common requirements and evaluation criteria. Logistics Mgmt. Intl, Inc., supra, at 16. On this record, we find the Navys evaluation of the past performance of Halbert to be unreasonable because the Navy engaged in disparate treatment of Halbert. (Halbert Construction Company, Inc. B-413213: Sep 8, 2016)\n\nPast Performance\n\nRotech challenges the agencys assignment of a rating of good to Lincares proposal under the past performance evaluation factor, arguing that the record fails to establish that the rating was based on Lincares performance on contracts similar in size, scope, and complexity to the effort here, as required by the RFP. As discussed below, we agree with the protester.\n\nThe RFP instructed offerors to provide past performance information on contracts of similar size, scope, and complexity that were ongoing or completed within the last three years. RFP at 97. The solicitation explained that past performance would be evaluated as follows:\n\nPast performance will be evaluated based on the level of risk of poor performance as indicated by an offerors past performance references of similar size, scope, and complexity that are ongoing or have been completed within the last three years. A Past Performance Survey template will be included as an attachment to the solicitation, to include questions concerning timeliness of performance, cost control, effective management, customer satisfaction, quality awards, and the technical success of the project. All of the [P]ast Performance Survey questions are of equal importance relative to each other. Offerors shall submit those surveys to their previous contract references, who then shall complete the survey and submit directly to the contracting officer for evaluation.\n\nRFP at 101.\n\nIn its proposal, Lincare identified eleven recent/ongoing contracts on which it was performing (or had performed), the number of oxygen patients under the contract, and the annual contract value. Two of the contracts were with the VA. Nine of the contracts served patient populations of approximately 1,000 or less; the remaining two served populations of 2,612 and 7,383 patients, respectively. Only the final contract had an annual value of more than $5 million.\n\nThe agency received completed past performance surveys from references on only two of the contracts identified by Lincare. One of the surveys pertained to a contract involving 962 oxygen patients (the annual value of which was $3.5 million) on which Lincares performance was generally rated as excellent. The other pertained to Lincares performance on a contract involving 218 patients (with an annual value of $2.5 million) on which Lincares performance was generally rated as satisfactory; in response to the survey question as to whether the reference would award another contract to Lincare, this reference indicated No. In evaluating Lincares past performance, the evaluation team also took into consideration the personal experience of one of its members dealing with Lincare in a private industry setting. Based on her experience, this individual rated Lincares past performance as excellent; the evaluation record contains no information as to the similarity of the private sector contract to the work solicited here, however.\n\nThe evaluation team summarized its basis for assigning Lincares proposal a past performance rating of good as follows:\n\nThe offeror received a long list of strengths identified by the evaluators, as evidenced by the many past performance references provided. The offeror received good comments on their references, which include current contracts with entities within the Dept. of VA. The offeror has over forty years of experience, already has a large patient population including VA, military, and private insurance patients. Nothing in their past performance references indicated poor performance, and one evaluator had personal experience dealing with the offeror in the private industry setting-with excellent reviews. They appear to be experienced, provide good customer service, and excel at solving communication issues that arise. Some weaknesses were identified, however, including the fact the offeror is not currently contracted with any entire VISN in VA, a few mixed reviews on their past performance questionnaire, including Walla Walla, WA VA rating the offeror satisfactory but not likely to renew their contract due to some problems with rural service.\n\nLincares past performance consensus rating resulted in Good despite weaknesses identified, because the overall strengths more than offset the weaknesses. Some evaluators did give Lincare a Satisfactory overall rating, and one an Excellent rating, but after discussion the consensus was agreed upon to rate Lincares past performance as Good due to the overwhelming strong responses.\n\nSSD at 13.\n\nAs noted above, the protester contends that the agencys evaluation was flawed in that it failed to consider the similarity and relevance of Lincares contract references to the effort solicited here.\n\nAn agency is required to consider, determine, and document the similarity and relevance of an offerors past performance information as part of its past performance evaluation. Phillips Healthcare Informatics, B-405382.2 et al., May 14, 2012, 2012 CPD ¶ 220 at 9; see Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) §15.305(a)(2). As a general matter, the evaluation of an offerors past performance, including the agencys determination of the relevance and scope of an offerors performance history to be considered, is a matter within the discretion of the contracting agency, and we will not substitute our judgment for reasonably based past performance ratings.

Clean Harbors Envtl. Servs., Inc., B-296176.2, Dec. 9, 2005, 2005 CPD ¶ 222 at 3. The critical question is whether the evaluation was conducted fairly, reasonably, and in accordance with the solicitations evaluation scheme, and whether it was based on relevant information sufficient to make a reasonable determination of the offerors past performance. DRS C3 Sys., LLC , B‑310825, B-310825.2, Feb. 26, 2008, 2008 CPD ¶ 103 at 22.\n\nHere, the record simply does not demonstrate that the agency had a reasonable basis for assigning Lincares proposal a past performance rating of good based on Lincares performance on contracts similar in size to the solicited effort. There is no evidence in the contemporaneous record that the evaluators considered whether Lincares contracts were similar in size to the contract to be awarded here; moreover, the agency received completed past performance surveys on only two of Lincares contracts, neither of which appears to have been comparable in size (in terms of number of patients or annual contract value) to the contract here. Furthermore, there is no information in the record establishing that the contract on which one evaluator had personal experience was comparable in size, scope, and/or complexity to the solicited effort. Under these circumstances, we are unable to conclude that the agency had a reasonable basis for its rating of Lincares past performance. Accordingly, we sustain the protest on this basis. (Rotech Healthcare, Inc.\n\nB-413024, B-413024.2, B-413024.3: Aug 17, 2016)\n\nIn one respect, however, NASAs evaluation of CGJVs past performance was unreasonable and contrary to the terms of the RFP. ABJV challenges NASAs consideration of past performance by CTR Management regarding a contract with HHS because there was no record of performance for that contract. Protesters Comments at 3-7; Protesters Supp. Comments at 3-4. ABJV argues that since the RFP expressly provided that the past performance factor would assess the offerors performance record, and that NASA w[ould] not consider past performance on any contract that has no documented performance history, it was improper for NASA to consider CTR Managements past performance under this contract. Id. at 4. ABJV argues that given CTR Managements roles as manager of the joint venture, and as the firm primarily responsible for performance of [DELETED] SOW sections, NASAs failure to identify the lack of past performance information for CTR Management was unreasonable. Protesters Comments at 5-6.\n\nAlthough NASA concedes that the record contains no documentation of the performance by CTR Management under the HHS contract, the agency nevertheless argues that it was proper to consider the contract in the past performance evaluation. Specifically, even though there was no record of CTR Managements performance between the award of that contract in August and the submission of proposals under this RFP in November,[9] NASA maintains that it still was proper to evaluate the HHS contract as both recent and relevant. NASA argues that recency and relevance were separate elements of the past performance evaluation, and therefore, the agency could evaluate past performance for CTR Management despite having no record of the firms performance. Supp. AR at 3-4.\n\nIn our view, the terms of the RFP precluded consideration of past performance for which there was no record of performance, as was indisputably the case for CGJVs HHS contract. Further, we do not see how the fact that one joint venturer had recently been awarded a contract for similar services would have any reasonable relationship to the agencys past performance evaluation absent a record of the quality of that performance. In sum, the record provides no rational basis for NASA to consider the HHS contract in the past performance evaluation of CGJV.\n\nWe also conclude that ABJV was prejudiced by the misevaluation of CGJVs past performance. The record does not reflect precisely how significant the consideration of the HHS contract was to the agencys judgment about CGJVs past performance. The record does show, however, that the HHS contract was the only past performance identified by CTR Management; that CTR Management was to have overall management of the JV; and that CTR Management was to have primary responsibility for performance of [DELETED] of the seven main SOW areas. AR, Tab 11, CGJV Proposal, vol. II, at 3 (organizational chart and explanation of roles). Given the discussion of CTR Managements HHS contract positively in both the evaluation report and the source selection decision, the record shows that the misevaluation influenced the agencys tradeoff judgment. See AR, Tab 13, Evaluation of CGJV, at 18-20; AR, Tab 15, Source Selection Decision, at 12. In such circumstances, we resolve doubts regarding prejudice in favor of a protester; a reasonable possibility of prejudice is sufficient to sustain a protest.

Where a protester challenges an agencys past performance evaluation, we will review the evaluation to determine if it was reasonable and consistent with the solicitations evaluation criteria and with the procurement statutes and regulations, and to ensure that it is adequately documented. Falcon Envtl. Servs., Inc., B-402670, B-402670.2, July 6, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 160 at 7.\n\nHere, the solicitation provided that:\n\nThe Past Performance information will be evaluated to determine the relevancy of the like or similar items in accordance with the descriptions below:\n\n* * * * *\n\nRelevant - Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.\n\nSomewhat Relevant - Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.\n\nRFP § M.3.3. The solicitation further defined relevant past performance as follows:\n\nRelevant is defined as having previously produced like or similar items. Like or similar items are defined as items that have been produced using similar manufacturing processes, including experience with casting, machining, forging, metal forming, welding, essential skills and unique techniques required to produce the MK-76 with MK‑14, BDU-33 and the 25lb Suspension Lug.\n\nRFP § L.3(f).\n\nAs indicated in its proposal, Delfasco has been a previous producer of the BDU-33 Practice Bomb, MK-76 Practice Bomb, and 25-pound suspension lug under both single and multi-year contacts. AR, Tab 20-02, Delfasco Proposal, Technical Subfactor 1, at 1; Tab 21-03; Delfasco Proposal, Past Performance Subfactor 2.2, at 10-11. Delfasco proposed using existing practices, technology, personnel, and equipment, all of which it has utilized to produce millions of BDU-33 and MK-76 Practice bombs as well as thousands of the 25lb Suspension Lug. AR, Tab 20-02, Delfasco Proposal, Technical Subfactor 1, at 1, 9. Based on its extensive prior experience, Delfascos proposal as reevaluated by the agency during the protest received a relevant rating under both past performance subfactors and also the overall past performance factor.\n\nIn contrast with Delfascos extensive experience producing BDU-33 Practice Bombs, MK-76 Practice Bombs, and 25-pound suspension lugs, the agencys evaluation indicated that GTI had much more limited experience relevant to these items. As discussed below, the agency found the awardee lacked relevant past performance with respect to two necessary skills identified in the RFP, and only somewhat relevant experience with respect to another skill. Thus, the agency evaluated the relevance of GTIs experience under the quality program problems subfactor of the past performance factor as follows:\n\nThe offeror submitted three parts for their relevant items, the Leaf Sight Rail Grabber Assembly, M385A1, and the BDU-48. The 76/33 Bomb Bodies are cast and the respective Lugs are forged. The offeror has not demonstrated they have any relevance [sic] with castings and forgings requirements including inspection and machining of castings and forgings. They did provide a matrix which demonstrates some of the scope of work relevant to the 76/33. This includes plating, MPI, hardness testing, and weld testing. They demonstrated somewhat relevant requirements to machining threads but not specific to class three threads which have a tighter tolerance. There are forming processes for the BDU‑48 practice bomb fin which are relevant and welding which is very relevant to the 76/33. There are machining processes for turning which are relevant to the 76/33. Though the offeror does not appear to have relevant experience i[n] all aspects that will be required on this solicitation, their past performance does involve a similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires giving the offeror an overall relevancy rating of Relevant[.]\n\nAR, Tab 53-01, GTI Past Performance Evaluation, Subfactor 1, at 5.\n\nDelfasco asserts that given the evaluated limits on GTIs experience as indicated in the agencys evaluation, it was unreasonable for the agency to assign the same relevant rating assigned Delfasco, which had extensive experience producing the BDU-33 Practice Bomb, MK-76 Practice Bomb, and 25-pound suspension lug being procured here. We agree.\n\nAgain, the solicitation defined like or similar items, for purposes of establishing that experience as relevant, as including experience with casting, machining, forging, metal forming, welding, essential skills and unique techniques required to produce the MK-76 with MK-14, BDU-33 and the 25lb Suspension Lug. RFP § L.3(f). Of those necessary skills, the agency noted that GTI had not demonstrated any relevant experience in two (casting and forging) and only somewhat relevant experience in the third (machining), such that GTI had only demonstrated some of the skills necessary to produce the bomb bodies. AR, Tab 53‑01, GTI Past Performance Evaluation, Subfactor 1, at 5. In our view, the agency has not adequately explained, nor is it otherwise apparent, why GTIs limited relevant experience warranted a relevant rating (similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires) rather than a lower rating. For these reasons, we sustain the protest. (Delfasco, LLC B-409514.3: Mar 2, 2015)\n\nPast Performance\n\nThe solicitation instructed offerors to provide summaries of up to 5 contracts that were performed within 36 months of the proposal submission deadline and that were similar in size, scope, and complexity to the current requirement. RFP, § L.3.3. The offerors also were required to provide a questionnaire to a reference for each past performance contract listed. Id. The solicitation provided that contracts would be assessed for relevancy and quality of performance, and then assigned an overall confidence rating. RFP, § M at 2.4.\n\nPatricio submitted five past performance references and GID submitted three past performance references. The offerors past performance was evaluated as follows:\n\nAR, Tab 15, Past Performance Report, at 6, 7; Agency Response (Mar. 24, 2016) at 6; Supp. AR (April 1, 2016) at 3.\n\nAs set forth above, GID received a past performance rating of substantial confidence and Patricio received a past performance rating of satisfactory confidential. In explaining the basis for these ratings, the SSA, who was also the Contracting Officer stated the following:\n\nThe PPET [Past Performance Evaluation Team] decided that a SUBSTANTIAL performance confidence assessment would be warranted when ALL relevant past performance was determined to be VERY RELEVANT with EXCEPTIONAL quality ratings. Any other combination of relevancy and quality would result in a SATISFACTORY (or lower) performance confidence assessment. This methodology was consistently employed by the PPET for every offeror.\n\nAR, Tab 25, Declaration of SSA, at 2-3 (emphasis in original).\n\nAs a general matter, the evaluation of an offerors past performance is within the discretion of the contracting agency, and we will not substitute our judgment for reasonably based past performance ratings.

Where a protester challenges the past performance evaluation and source selection, we will review the evaluation and award decision to determine if they were reasonable and consistent with the solicitations evaluation criteria and procurement statutes and regulations, and to ensure that the agencys rationale is adequately documented. Shaw-Parsons Infrastructure Recovery Consultants, LLC; Vanguard Recovery Assistance, Joint Venture, supra.\n\nFor example, in Shaw-Parsons Infrastructure Recovery Consultants, LLC; Vanguard Recovery Assistance, Joint Venture, we sustained a challenge to the agencys past performance evaluation methodology, finding it unreasonable because it effectively penalized offerors for submitting less relevant contract references, where, had the less relevant contracts not been submitted, the offerors past performance rating scores would have been higher. Id. at 8. In that case, we agreed with the protesters argument that any reasonable consideration of its less relevant contracts could only have increased its score since it received all superior ratings for those contracts. Id.; see also Olympus Bldg. Servs., Inc., B-285351, B-285351.2, Aug. 17, 2000, 2000 CPD ¶ 178 (sustaining protest where agencys mechanical formula for scoring experience unreasonably penalized an offeror for including extra, less relevant references in addition to relevant ones).\n\nHere, Patricio asserts that the evaluation methodology used by the agency was unreasonable. We agree. Specifically, Patricio, like GID, had two very relevant past performance contracts that were rated exceptional for quality. Patricio also had two additional references that were found to be relevant and rated exceptional for quality, and one additional reference that was very relevant and rated very good for quality. In our view, the agencys mechanical evaluation of past performance was unreasonable where the result was that additional relevant past performance references with exceptional and very good quality resulted in a downgraded past performance rating. In sum, the agencys past performance evaluation methodology was not rational and resulted in an unreasonable evaluation of the offerors past performance. Therefore, we sustain the protest on this basis.

Given this, an individual order (or orders) under the basic ordering contract should be submitted in lieu of just the basic ordering contract itself. Each submitted order shall be considered a separate effort unless information is provided indicating follow-on or series of orders for continued performance of the same scope and such can be verified by the user/customer. In this event, such submitted multiple orders shall be considered as a single effort for evaluation purposes.\n\nRFP at 131.\n\nSupplyCore initially submitted past performance information concerning four ID/IQ contracts, but the Air Force stated during discussions that, in accordance with the RFP, only order-related information would be evaluated and that ID/IQ contract-related information would be assessed as not relevant. AR, Tab 8, SupplyCore Evaluation Notices and Responses, at 1. In response, SupplyCore amended its past performance proposal to include information about a representative task order for each of the ID/IQ contracts. Id. In its response to the initial protest, however, the agency contended that it had reasonably considered the overall ID/IQ contracts in evaluating SupplyCores past performance confidence assessment. See, e.g., Supp. COSF in B-411015.2 and B-411015.3 (Mar. 2, 2015) at 11-12. We sustained LMIs and RGTSs protests challenging this aspect of the agencys evaluation for three independent reasons: (1) there was no contemporaneous evidence that the agency had in fact considered the ID/IQ contracts generally, or specifically in terms of the RFPs relevance criteria; (2) the agencys reliance on the ID/IQ contracts was inconsistent with the RFPs instruction that offerors submit only order-related past performance; and (3) the agencys reliance on the ID/IQ contracts was inconsistent with its contemporaneous interpretation of the applicable RFP provision during discussions. Al Raha Grp. for Tech. Servs., Inc.; Logistics Mgmt. Intl, Inc., supra, at 8-10.\n\nDuring its corrective action reassessment, the Air Force investigated the underlying ID/IQ contracts against which the four orders submitted by SupplyCore were issued.[5] Specifically, the agency contacted the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the agency that awarded the ID/IQ contracts against which SupplyCores orders were issued, to obtain additional information regarding the nature of the contracts and the resulting orders. AR, Tab 47, Email from Air Force Contracting Officer to DLA (Apr. 29, 2015), at 2. DLA provided the Air Force with copies of the applicable ID/IQ contracts. AR, Tab 67, SupplyCore ID/IQ Contracts. Additionally, two DLA contracting officers spoke to the Air Force by phone. The Air Force summarized one DLA contracting officers discussion of two of SupplyCores ID/IQ contracts as follows:\n\n[The DLA Contracting Officer] confirmed the [evaluators] evaluation that DLA uses unique ordering procedures for its IDIQ contracts. She stated that DLA drops delivery orders constantly based on their customers mission. Orders can range anywhere from a few dollars to over a million dollars. The scope and magnitude of the orders is based on the customers various projects. Some orders simply meet an immediate need for material, while others have associated services. The vendor works directly with the customer to support their needs.\n\nAR, Tab 45, Notes from Apr. 30, 2015, Phone Call (May 11, 2015), at 1; see also Tab 46, Notes from May 5, 2015, Phone Call (May 11, 2015), at 1 (noting the second DLA contracting officer stated that [o]rders can range anywhere from a few cents to thousands of dollars depending on the need).\n\nThe Air Force also reviewed the associated ordering histories for the DLA ID/IQ contracts that were available through the Department of Defenses Electronic Document Access (EDA) system. The EDA system included only the following information for each order: (1) the order number; (2) the number of modifications, if any; (3) the obligated amount; and (4) the effective date. AR, Tab 47, EDA Data, at 6-2337. Based on the EDA data (and other supplemental data from DLA), the Air Force calculated: (1) the duration of the ordering periods falling within the RFPs 5‑year recency period; and (2) the number and total value of orders placed against each of the four ID/IQ contracts during the recent periods of performance, as follows:\n\nID/IQ Contract Number SPM7LX-10-D-9009 SPM500-05-D-BP04 SPM500-05-D-BP06 SPM500-02-D-0122 Recent Duration 1 year, 11.5 months 3 years, 2 months 5 years, 4 months 3 years, 3 months Total Orders Placed 88,022 1,336 76,490 6,129 Total Dollar Value $28,340,026 $147,702,804 $294,833,055 $31,832,889\n\nAR, Tab 48, Past Performance Report (July 29, 2015), at 113, 115-16, 118, 120-21.\n\nNext, the Air Force considered the general scopes of these contracts, and whether they satisfied the 7 specific experience areas identified in the RFP. The agencys evaluation considered the information provided by SupplyCore in its proposal, which consisted of general information regarding the ID/IQ contracts and specific information regarding four individual orders. See AR, Tab 8, SupplyCore Evaluation Notices and Responses. Based on this analysis, the Air Force concluded that SupplyCores ID/IQ contracts met the RFPs exception as a series of orders for continued performance of the same scope of work. The Air Force evaluated the relevancy of the four ID/IQ contracts as follows:\n\nID/IQ Contract Number SPM7LX-10-D-9009 SPM500-05-D-BP04 SPM500-05-D-BP06 SPM500-02-D-0122 Scope & Magnitude Similar Essentially the Same Essentially the Same Similar Specific Experience 5 of 7 6 of 7 6 of 7 4 of 7 Overall Relevance Relevant Relevant Relevant Somewhat Relevant\n\nBased on these findings, the SSA determined that the aggregate value of SupplyCores past performance work was $502,708,775.94 under the four ID/IQ contracts, and that the prior work was very relevant to the RFPs requirements and warranted a rating of substantial confidence. AR, Tab 50, Source Selection Decision (Aug. 5, 2015), at 83.\n\nThe protesters first challenge the agencys determination that SupplyCores ID/IQ contracts satisfied the RFPs exception to the requirement that only orders issued against ID/IQ contracts would be evaluated. The protesters contend that the agencys determination is inconsistent with the RFPs terms because: (1) only four representative orders, one for each ID/IQ contract, were submitted in the awardees proposal for the agencys review; (2) the agency unreasonably assumed, based on its review of a single order issued against each of SupplyCores ID/IQ contracts, that the other orders issued against the contracts were for follow-on or continuous performance of the same scope; (3) other information available to the agency demonstrates that the tens of thousands of orders issued against the contracts were not for follow-on or continuous performance; and (4) the information was not reasonably verified by DLA or the end user/customer of the orders. The protesters also argue that the Air Force failed to reasonably consider whether the series of orders had similar logistical and programmatic considerations as those required by the RFP or satisfied the seven specific experience areas.\n\nThe Air Force responds that it reasonably evaluated the tens of thousands of orders issued against SupplyCores ID/IQ contracts as constituting a series of orders for continuing performance of the same scope. COSF (Sept. 15, 2015) at 12‑15. The agency argues that DLA uses unique ordering procedures on its ID/IQ contracts, whereby DLA constantly issues many small value orders that, when aggregated, demonstrate a similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexity as compared to the RFPs requirements. Id. at 13-14. The Air Force contends that DLAs placement of many thousands of orders under the overall ID/IQ contracts broad statements of work demonstrates that the orders were for the continuing performance of the same scope. Id.\n\nWe find unreasonable the Air Forces conclusion that the many thousands of orders issued against SupplyCores four individual ID/IQ contracts constituted, collectively, four discrete references. First, it appears that the agency evaluated SupplyCores ID/IQ contracts, as opposed to the individual orders issued against the contracts, in violation of the RFPs instruction that only orders would be considered. We also find that the agencys reliance on the overall, general scopes of work for the ID/IQ contracts was insufficient to satisfy the RFPs requirements that, to be considered as a single effort, multiple orders had to be for follow-on performance or continued performance of the same scope. Where a protester and agency disagree over the meaning of solicitation language, we will resolve the matter by reading the solicitation as a whole and in a manner that gives effect to all of its provisions; to be reasonable, and therefore valid, an interpretation must be consistent with the solicitation when read as a whole and in a reasonable manner. TransAtlantic Lines, LLC, B‑411242, B-411242.2, June 23, 2015, 2015 CPD ¶ 204 at 16.\n\nHere, we conclude that the protesters reasonably interpreted the series of orders provision to be an exception to the general requirement that only order-related information would be considered in the past performance evaluation. The protesters argue that the text of this provision applies only where: (1) orders were submitted or provided; (2) for follow-on or continuous performance of the same scope; and (3) such information could be verified by the user/customer. RFP at 131. We agree. In this regard, the agencys interpretation of the provision that all orders issued under the awardees ID/IQ contract references are necessarily for follow-on or continuous performance, would effectively make every ID/IQ contract a series of orders eligible for consideration, which in turn would render superfluous the requirement that only order-related information be submitted and evaluated. Additionally, the Air Forces evaluation of only a single representative task order, and each ID/IQ contracts general scope of work, ignores the RFPs requirement that the agency evaluate only order-related information, as opposed to the ID/IQ contracts against which the orders were issued. The agency failed to meaningfully evaluate whether the orders demonstrated follow-on or continuing performance because it did not seek any information regarding the scopes of the tens of thousands of orders upon which its evaluation conclusion relies.\n\nEven the limited information in the record collected by the Air Force about the orders does not support the Air Forces argument that the orders demonstrated a pattern of continued performance of the same scope. The Air Forces notes of its conversations with DLA reflect that the DLA contracting officers represented that the scope and magnitude of effort and complexity of the orders varied based on the unique project or customer requirements resulting in the issuance of each order. See AR, Tab 45, Notes from Apr. 30, 2015, Phone Call (May 11, 2015), at 1; Tab 46, Notes from May 5, 2015, Phone Call (May 11, 2015), at 1. Similarly, the record shows that the goods or services performed under the series of orders, while tangentially related under the umbrella ID/IQ contracts, varied significantly in terms of dollar value, duration, scope, and magnitude of effort and complexity. For example, based on the EDA data available for contract No. SPM-500-05-D-BP04, SupplyCore had 6 orders, all of which had an effective date of April 11, 2012 and ranged in value from $130.20 to $19,714.08. See AR, Tab 47, EDA Data, at 1929. While no additional information about the scope or programmatic considerations pertinent to the orders was provided, the fact that the orders: (1) all had the same effective date; and (2) were for divergent amounts, suggests that they were not for follow-on or continuous work of the same scope.\n\nAdditionally, under contract No. SPM500-05-D-BP06, SupplyCores proposal reflected seemingly distinct projects that were not for follow-on work or continuous performance of the same scope. First, under order No. NMM6, SupplyCore discussed a $143,461.67 project for the replacement and installation of three doors at the Misawa Air Base Hospital in Misawa, Japan. AR, Tab 8, SupplyCore Evaluation Notices and Responses, at 21-25. The proposal, however, also discussed SupplyCores other work under the contract, including the installation of a large solar project (exceeding $1 million) in Okinawa, Japan, and other facility and maintenance projects, including: (a) heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; (b) plumbing; (c) electrical; (d) roofing and flooring; (e) procurement of construction supplies; and (f) perimeter security. Id. at 24, 27. Thus, based on the awardees own description of the work under the contract, it appears that the orders issued against the contract were for discrete projects located at U.S. government sites throughout Japan. On this record, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the various orders issued against SupplyCores ID/IQ contracts were for follow-on work or a series of orders for the continuous performance of the same scope of work. We therefore find that the Air Forces evaluation of the tens of thousands of orders under SupplyCores ID/IQ contracts as constituting a series of orders for continuing performance of the same scope of work, and thus warranting treatment as a single reference, was inconsistent with the RFPs express terms, unreasonable, and not adequately documented. (Logistics Management International, Inc.; Al Raha Group for Technical Services, Inc.; Dalma Tech² Company B-411015.4, B-411015.5, B-411015.6: Nov 20, 2015) (pdf)\n\nThe RFP provided that the agency would assess the relevancy of the past performance examples based on the extent to which the example showed that it involved the same magnitude of effort and complexities involved in performing the solicited requirement. RFP at 72. As noted above, the contract awarded to IGH is for a total value of approximately $49 million, or more than $16 million per year. It contemplates performance on a nationwide basis in all 50 states, with a requirement for an estimated 170 full time equivalent personnel, exclusive of management personnel. RFP at 26-27.\n\nThe record shows that IGH included three past performance examples in its proposal. The first of these examples was for performance of a community service relocation readiness program and lending closet program at a single location. AR, exh. 8, IGH Technical Proposal, Vol. II, at 29-30. The period of performance for this contract was 2 years, and the total dollar value of the contract was $58,176. The record shows that the agency assigned this past performance example a rating of relevant, stating without elaboration: The past performance is within scope and the contract dollar value is not similar to the IGCE. AR, exh. 14, PPEB Report, at 22.\n\nIGHs second past performance example was a contract to perform grant management support services for the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
