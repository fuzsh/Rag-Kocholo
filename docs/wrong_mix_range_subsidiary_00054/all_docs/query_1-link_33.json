        "text": "Being patient always pays off. Being positive always pays off. In 2020, when Biden ran for the President of the United States of America, his message was very clear. He wanted to be the president for one term. He wanted to dethrone Trump. He wanted to fix America’s credibility on world stage. He wanted to unify the bitterly divided nation. And people responded and voted him to power. But he was clear that he wouldn’t want a second term. Hence Kamala Harris, his Vice President, had a very clear expectation — that in 2024, she would be the Democratic nominee or at least the front runner from the party for the presidential race. She patiently waited in the wings. Supported Biden wholeheartedly. But in 2022, the mid-term elections happened. The Democrats did far better than expected. Biden felt his presidency and achievements were the reason for this. He changed his mind and decided to run for a re-election. In one shot, Kamala’s dreams were set back by 4 more years. 4 years of uncertainty. Biden may not win the re-election and hence she may not be VP by 2028. That meant her advantage of becoming the automatic choice of the Democratic nominee had completely vanished. Even if Biden did win in 2024, his second term may be a disaster and she would be associated with that disaster. And let us face it, who likes to be told that the top job promised to you next year has now been pushed back by 5 years? Any normal person would have been bitter. Would have hated her boss for it. But Kamla had enormous patience as a virtue. She buried her disappointment and completely backed her boss for another term. She never let even the slightest tinge of bitterness, disappointment, or negativity show on her face. She never burned her bridges with Biden by sulking with him. Today, she has been rewarded for her patience. Biden stepped down from the race because of doubts over his eroding mental abilities. She has suddenly become the Democratic candidate for the top job. And Biden has endorsed her. Being patient always pays off. Taking setbacks positively always pays off. Not burning one’s bridges always pays off. Controlling your emotions always pays off. Would you agree? #Kamalaharris\n\nFrom selling mangoes to owning a ₹400 crore ice cream business. This is a story of an idea that was backed by passion, grit, and courage. This is the story of Raghunandan Kamath. He was born in a small village in Mangaluru and was introduced to the world of business early. He assisted his father who was a mango vendor. From a young age he was exceptional at identifying a perfect mango. At 14, he left his studies and joined his brother's restaurant. He had a dream that seemed audacious at the time - to create handcrafted ice cream made with real fruit pulp. This dream took him to Mumbai in 1984, where he opened his first ice cream parlour in the Juhu scheme suburbs. He started with just six staff members and twelve flavours. The quality of his ice cream began to attract a loyal customer base, who lovingly dubbed it \"Ice Cream of Juhu Scheme.\" His journey was not without its challenges. He was in an industry dominated by artificial flavours but still insisted on using real fruit, inspired by his mother's techniques. His innovative approach and dedication to quality soon paid off. By 1994, Naturals Ice Cream had expanded to five more outlets, and today, it boasts over 165 outlets across 15 cities, with a ₹300+ crore turnover. One of Kamath's most celebrated creations, the Tender Coconut flavour, is listed among the Top 100 most iconic ice creams in the world by Taste Atlas. Kamath passed away at the age of 75, leaving behind a legacy far richer than any accolade. His story shows that success can be attained by doing uncommon things too. Being innovative and unique still pays off. Of course, one needs to have the passion and courage to back the innovation with decisive action. Kamath was popularly known as the “Ice cream man of India”. Have you ever heard of him or this is your first time? #RaghunandanKamath #BoundlessWithRamG\n\nOver the last 10 years, I have been working on building a 56-inch chest! Of course, it doesn’t always happen in the gym!! 56-inch chest is all about courage. In general parlance, it is about the ability to take tough, big, bold decisions and following up with courageous action. But I believe courage can come in many more flavours. And we see them all around us. The incredible grit of millions of women — who put in 8-12 hour work in a profession/occupation and on top of that, manage the complexities of running a household and taking care of children. - People who stick it out in a job they hate and still put in 12 hours a day, because they have a family to feed and children to educate. - The parents, barely above poverty line, working their guts out to educate their children so that they can break out of the crushing cycle of poverty. - The teenage child, body-shamed by malicious classmates, but defiantly going back to school every day, trying to smile through the pain she/he feels inside. There are 56 inch chests all around us. For me, it is about conquering a few mental demons that lurk in my head every moment of every day, ready to pounce at the slightest weakness I exhibit. The fear that grips my heart every time I walk. The fear that I might yet again trip and fall and fracture or sprain some part of the body as I have done dozens of times in the past few years. Self-doubt that every once in a while breaks through my mental defence and reminds me that I may be wheelchair bound in a few years. Ever-present worry that reminds me that I may be unable to use my fingers to type in a few years. Apprehension that flashes through my mind occasionally when I lift weights above my head in the gym that warns me my grip may give away and a heavy weight might fall on my head. Yes, these demons are very real and these battles are now a part of my everyday life. So how do I build my 56-inch chest so that these demons are diminished, if not utterly vanquished? I laugh. I find simple, silly things to laugh about. I crack stupid jokes and am the loudest to laugh at my own jokes. I look for the absurd in life and share that with others and share the joy that it generates. I seek out people to support. With my time, my experiences, and by being generous with my appreciation. I bask in the thought of all the wonderful people and things life has offered me. And feel awesome about life. I embrace people — for who they are, without judgment and focus fully on their good. I try new things again and again without fear of failure in pursuit of my passion so that every day is a self-discovery of the extent of my abilities. And I rejoice at my ability to constantly grow. And most importantly, I push myself to do the things that I fear most to do, because I know that if we do this, the death of fear is certain. With all these constant set of mental workouts, are you surprised that my chest is on the way to attaining 56 inch? #BoundlessWithRamG\n\nNo Indian had won this award until Parvej Khan. He is a 19-year-old from Haryana, India, who recently clinched gold at the SEC Championships in the United States, He had an impressive time of 3:42.73 in the 1500m race but this wasn’t his only victory; he also snagged a bronze medal in the 800m category. A big deal for a teenager, right? His journey started in the humble district of Metwa, Haryana. His father, Nafees Khan, is a farmer, and the family didn’t have much. But Parvej had big dreams. At 13, he left his village and headed to Delhi to pursue athletics. He trained at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium for a year before moving to Bhopal to train under coach Anupama Srivastava at the Sports Authority of India. His dedication paid off when he was picked by the Indian Navy, which eventually sent him to the United States on a full scholarship. This is where his story takes a thrilling turn. Competing for the University of Florida’s Gators, Parvej made history. He became the first Indian track athlete to compete at the prestigious NCAA championships in Boston, racing in the one-mile event. Parvej’s journey hasn’t been without its challenges. He faced controversy in 2021 when he was declared overage at the National Junior Championships in Guwahati. However, he bounced back, proving his mettle in senior categories and continuing to break barriers. His dream is to qualify for the Olympics. It’s a tough goal, but he’s committed to giving it his all. “I am very far behind... but I am giving my 100 per cent and doing my job every day,” he said. Parvej Khan’s story is one of grit, determination, and the relentless pursuit of dreams. From running on farmlands in Haryana to competing in the United States, he’s come a long way. This is your reminder that no dream is too big if you have the courage to pursue it. #ParvejKhan #Inspiration\n\nI had an All-India Rank (AIR) of 129 in IIT JEE. Well, it means I am good at quant stuff and that I had self-discipline in high school. Nothing more. We (the society) regularly make the mistake of assuming if a person has achieved something difficult in a coveted field, they are great at everything. This is called the ‘Halo Effect’. This is why we end up listening to movie stars when they give ‘gyan’ on parenting, cricketers giving ‘gyan’ on education, or political leaders giving ‘gyan’ on integrity. As an IITian, it is obvious that I have cracked one of the toughest exams in the world, the IIT JEE. It means I was good at high school level physics, maths, and chemistry. It also means I have strong quantitative skills. It even means that in my high school days, I must have had the self-discipline to prepare well for the JEE. But honestly, that is all it means. These skills do not necessarily make an IITian a great leader, a great manager, a great colleague, a great teacher, a great communicator, a great spouse, or a great human being. I know many IITians who are terrible at interpersonal skills or empathy — two qualities that are essential for success at workplace, or even in personal life. IITians also follow a normal distribution on these qualities like those who went to other colleges — varying from very poor to very good. Unfortunately, the society has created something like a class system based on education. Those from the so-called-premier institutions being the upper class and hence considered superior in every way to those from other institutes. And this class discrimination is for a lifetime. Most hiring managers also suffer from halo effect and end up making some spectacular hiring mistakes. Hiring for proven strength in certain qualities, and automatically assuming that person is great in all other dimensions. When it comes to promotions, a similar halo effect kicks in, but this time, based on past performance. When promoting an individual into a larger role, what matters is not so much performance in the previous role, but strengths in the competencies required for the next role. So next time we feel great admiration for a person, let us sit back and ask ourselves — which particular strengths in that person do we admire? And once we have identified which those strengths are, let us make sure we don’t automatically give them credit for qualities for which they haven’t proved their expertise. What do you think? #BoundlessWithRamG\n\nHave you met someone who has never made a mistake? I’m sure the answer is “no.” The truth is, if you keep living in fear of making mistakes, you will never progress. I once had a colleague who was terrified of making mistakes. So she would keep trying to get everything perfect before starting on any project. One day, she was assigned to lead a major project. As expected, she kept dragging her feet at every decision and the project just wouldn’t move. And when she had a midway review with the internal customer, the unthinkable happened. Despite her efforts, a minor error had slipped through, causing a slight delay. The customer was understanding and gave her time to rework. And this helped her to control her panic; instead, she took a deep breath and focused on fixing the issue. She worked with her team to find a solution and managed to get the project back on track. The client was happy, and the project was a success in the end. This was a turning point for her. This experience taught her that mistakes are not the end of the world. They can be a valuable learning opportunity. The truth is, we are human and bound to make mistakes. If we see them as opportunities to grow, we can develop resilience and creativity to try again. It is a natural part of the learning process. Accept them, learn from them, and watch yourself grow. #growthmindset #BoundlessWithRamG\n\nThe people that make everyone happy are sometimes the saddest. This is the harsh reality of the life of Robin Williams. He was born in 1951, in Chicago and was the only child of a Ford executive and a former model. However, his family’s wealth didn’t shield him from loneliness, and ended up often spending more time with his household staff than his busy parents. He was a quiet and shy child, bullied in school, and found solace in making people laugh, inspired by his mother’s wit. His journey to stardom was not easy. After attending Claremont Men’s College and the College of Marin, he earned a scholarship to the famous Juilliard School. There, he met lifelong friends like Christopher Reeve and honed his acting skills. His teachers at Juilliard saw his genius, even though they felt the school's traditional training couldn't fully contain his talent. His big break came with his role as the quirky alien Mork in \"Mork & Mindy,\" which made him famous and showcased his talent. He was known for his incredible range, starring in both comedies and dramas. He brought joy to families with films like \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" \"Jumanji’. But it was movies like ‘Dead Poets Society’, and ‘Patch Adams’, with their strong message of compassion that defined Robin Williams. His ability to switch between humor and serious roles made him a unique and cherished figure in Hollywood. Yet, behind the laughter and accolades, Williams battled inner demons. He struggled with substance abuse. Despite periods of sobriety, he faced relapses and ongoing depression. He turned to cycling and other hobbies to cope, but the battle was relentless. In his later years, Williams faced more health challenges. He was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, which was later revealed to be a misdiagnosis; he actually had Lewy body dementia, a serious brain condition. This diagnosis came with symptoms of paranoia, depression, and anxiety, which greatly affected his quality of life. On August 11, 2014, the world was shocked by the news of his passing. Williams died by suicide at the age of 63. His death highlighted the deep gaps in our understanding of mental health and the silent battles many people endure. It was a tragic end to the life of a man who had brought so much joy and laughter to others. He left behind a legacy not just of laughter, but of humanity, compassion, and a testament to the complexities of the human spirit. His story is a reminder to be always conscious that every person may be battling invisible demons within and that we need to be understanding and compassionate. His films continue to inspire and entertain, reminding us that each of us can leave behind legacies of love and laughter long after our physical bodies have turned to dust. . #RobinWilliams #MentalHealthAwareness\n\nAnwar Mohammed was the most cheerful and energetic of my gym buddies. Then one day he had a massive heart attack. He was a regular at our apartment complex gym for over 4 years. He always walked into the gym with a cheerful ‘hi’ to all his gym buddies — just about everyone there!! As he went about his workout, he would take it upon himself to motivate and push others to do that extra bit. He was also always there to help newbies with advice and help. He was one of the heavy lifters in the gym, regularly bench pressing 50 – 75 Kgs. Exactly a year back, as he started his workout, he felt a shooting pain on his side. He felt weak and he was sweating profusely. Luckily, the gym buddies read the symptom correctly. They rushed him to the hospital — just in time. He had 100% block in his arteries and had to undergo an emergency stent placement. So popular is Anwar that half the gym had accompanied him. There were close to 50 people including colleagues waiting outside the OT. The experience was traumatic for Anwar. Heart attack at such a young age was shocking to say the least. The doctor advised zero exercise for 3 months except for sedate walking. Anwar slowly built up the walking and by month 3, was walking 3 kilometres. We were all happy when Anwar resumed the gym after 3 months. But he was a pale shadow of his previous self — quiet, subdued, and unsmiling. He was suffering from PTSD, and the gym, where the attack happened, was increasing his stress. He was also not allowed to lift over 10 Kgs. After watching him for couple of weeks, I decided to speak to him. I was fully aware that I am not a psychologist or counsellor and the words I spoke shouldn’t make him more depressed. So my words had to be weighed carefully. I gently told him, “Anwar, we love the way you spread energy in the Gym by speaking to everyone and encouraging them. I am glad you are back and can do that. Looking forward to your cheerful voice again.” I had surmised that Anwar draws his energy by interacting with others. I was taking a bet that this would bring his old self back. I don’t know whether it had anything at all to do with my talk, or the constant encouragement from his amazing wife, or a combination of both; or maybe it was just Anwar's natural resilience. But over the next few days, I noticed a marked change in him. Anwar started going around and motivating others again. That helped him bounce back. Today, he is his old self again — the biggest cheerleader in the Gym. He is now lifting 30Kgs weight and soon will go back to his original weights. The lesson for me? Surprisingly, one of the sure-shot ways of bouncing back from a slump is by reaching out to others, engaging with them and supporting them. It will enhance your own self-worth and help you mentally recover. So whether you are an extrovert with lots of friends or an introvert with couple of close friends, reach out to your network to help them when you are down! #Resilience #BoundlessWithRamG"
