        "text": "First\n\nThe ORP International Foundation together with the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) announce the ORP International Awards, a distinction awarded to a company, entity or professional of international scope with the aim of recognising its trajectory for the improvement of health and safety management at work, prevention of occupational hazards and procedures to achieve a healthy company.\n\nSecond\n\nThese awards are open to professionals, organisations, companies, corporations, public or private, that demonstrate their commitment to the dissemination and application of the values of occupational risk prevention, with the aim of improving the management of health and safety at work: occupational risk prevention.\n\nThird\n\nThe reports submitted must express, compulsorily, the most relevant issues related to working conditions that highlight the preventive policies in use in the organisation.\n\nSpecial attention will be paid to the sections on ORP and innovation.\n\nFourth\n\nThe documentation shall be sent by email to administracion@fiorp.org with the title: ORP Awards Application.\n\nFifth\n\nThe reports can be written in Spanish or English.\n\nSixth\n\nAnyone wishing to compete for the Prize must provide documentary proof that there are no problems with the reproduction of the image of persons appearing in the reports submitted, and that they have expressly obtained the necessary authorisations for the documents, images, music or any other content included in the same, assuming the responsibilities of any kind that may arise from non-compliance with this base.\n\nSeventh\n\nThe deadline for the submission of reports is 15 May.\n\nEighth\n\nSubmission to the call for entries implies acceptance of the rules and the Jury’s verdict. Works that do not meet the requirements established in the rules will not be accepted.\n\nNinth\n\nThe Jury shall be made up of representatives of the entities organising the event and members of the FIORP Board of Trustees.\n\nThe Jury will assess the reports presented, taking into account their rigour, originality, initiative and effectiveness in reducing occupational accidents and improving working conditions.\n\nConsideration will be given not only to the impact produced in the short term, but also in the medium and long term.\n\nTenth\n\nThe Prize may, at the Jury’s discretion, be declared void.\n\nThe first recognition went to the company LIDL, which arrived in Spain in 1994 and since then has not stopped growing. Over the years, the company has been strengthening its commitment to our country, with continuous investment aimed at expanding and improving its network of shops and logistics centres and increasing its workforce to adapt to the growth it has been experiencing.\n\nLidl Supermercados, in its management model, is committed to the long term, sustainability and people as the basis for all its actions and decisions. From the point of view of occupational risk prevention, it is committed to promoting the health, well-being and balance between the professional and personal lives of its employees, creating safe and healthy working environments on a physical, mental and social level. This commitment is reflected in the daily work of its own prevention service, which has promoted and developed the “Your health matters to us” programme.\n\nThe ORP Recognition was awarded to LIDL for its ‘Your health matters to us’ programme and the award was collected by Ester Martorell, Head of the Occupational Risk Prevention Department.\n\nThe second recognition went to one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical groups and a global leader in healthcare, a global pharmaceutical company that researches, develops and distributes therapeutic solutions to improve people’s lives.\n\nProtecting health, improving quality of life and responding to the therapeutic needs of the world’s population are its top priorities. Sanofi’s health promotion programme is primarily aimed at promoting healthy habits among our employees in order to improve their health status. Therefore, they not only take care of their patients, but also extend this model to their employees.\n\nThis recognition was given to SANOFI for its “Health Promotion Programme”. The recognition was collected by Mrs. María José Martínez, HSE Head of Sanofi.\n\nThe third recognition goes to DOWDUPONT, a business group formed by The Dow Chemical Company and DuPont with the intention of building strong, independent, publicly traded companies in agriculture, materials science and specialty products, capable of leading their respective industries through productive scientific innovation that meets customer needs and helps solve global challenges.\n\nThe belief that “0” (zero incidents, zero accidents, zero excuses) is possible and that management systems must be designed to achieve that goal has been part of its strong commitment to this. Programmes implemented by DOWDUPONT such as process-related safety (PSM) or behaviour-based safety have been benchmarks in the world of safety and are today replicated in hundreds of companies with high preventive standards.\n\nThe concept of a healthy company, so much in vogue at the moment, has a long history in these companies through the implementation of models oriented towards health care, understood in a broad sense of the term, through their numerous employee promotion and support programmes that allow an approach that goes beyond the working environment, implementing real wellbeing management policies.\n\nIf until now each of the companies had Occupational Health and Safety as one of its key values, the new group will strengthen, if possible, its commitment to people and the environment as a reality that it assumes in all its daily activities.\n\nFor this reason, this recognition was presented to DOWDUPONT and the award was collected by Ángela Santianes, President of DuPont for Spain and Portugal and Raoul Milesi, Director of Safety and Environment for Dow Chemical Ibérica.\n\nAnd the fourth Business Recognition is for a leading group in the unique European audiovisual sector in content integration, audiovisual production and distribution. Its activity is the production of content for cinema and television, the management of sports rights and the management of audiovisual and other associated services.\n\nIn line with its sustainability policy, the Mediapro Group is actively committed to society and promotes guidelines that encourage the responsible consumption of energy and natural resources and promote health and a culture of health in both the professional and personal spheres of all the people who work there.\n\nOne of the fundamental values of the Mediapro Group is its people, the key asset of its success. To this end, the Mediapro Group has developed new forms of collaboration and has developed a new health and safety management model that improves the protection and physical, mental and social well-being of all the people who work in the company, all of this in a company in which the variety, singularity and geographical dispersion of the activities it carries out, as well as the number of workers, pose a challenge for the group’s own prevention service.\n\nIn this sense, Mediapro’s occupational risk management system has shown great adaptability to the variety, singularity and dispersion of its activities (remember that it not only manages sports rights or audiovisual services, but also produces multiple events, films, series, etc., in which a large number of work activities are required and reproduced, which places great demands on the Group’s prevention service). All this has resulted in a clear improvement in the health and safety conditions of its workers.\n\nThis recognition was presented to MEDIAPRO for the adaptability of its occupational risk management system to the different business areas. The award was collected on behalf of Mediapro by Nuria Cabrero Sola, Head of the Efficiency Area and Head of the Occupational Risk Prevention Area of the People Department of the Mediapro Group.\n\nThe first recognition goes to a pioneer in the integration of gas and electricity. It is a multinational group present in more than 30 countries and with almost 22 million customers. It is a company involved with our environment and with the responsible management of the business activity it carries out. Therefore, its commitment is that the results guarantee the stability and solidity of the company, that its service is excellent and that its supply chain is equally responsible. All its actions are based on values such as sustainability, integrity, transparency and equal opportunities.\n\nFor its commitment in the field of occupational risk prevention and its commitment to continuous innovation, training and the implementation of healthy company policies, this ORP recognition goes to Gas Natural Fenosa.\n\nThe award was collected by Mr. Antonio Gella, Prevention Director of Gas Natural Fenosa.\n\nThe second recognition is for a public establishment of technical-scientific reference that directs and controls the system of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences in Colombia. They provide forensic services to the community and the administration of justice based on scientific research and the suitability of human talent within a framework of quality, impartiality, competitiveness and respect for human dignity.\n\nFor the implementation of management systems in autopsy rooms, this recognition is awarded to the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences of Colombia.\n\nThe recognition was received by the Secretary General of the Institute, Ms. Claudia Isabel Victoria Victoria Niño Izquierdo.\n\nThe third recognition is for a scientific association of occupational health professionals that was born in 2002. It brings together professionals from different disciplines and responsibilities in the field of Prevention and Occupational Health and Safety.\n\nIts main objective is the promotion and development of the scientific knowledge of occupational health, i.e. the improvement of the health and safety of workers in their workplaces and in any of its modalities.\n\nFor its contribution to the improvement of occupational health and safety management, this recognition goes to the Association of Occupational Health and Safety Specialists (AEPSAL).\n\nThe award was collected on behalf of the Association by its president, Mr. Josep Orrit.\n\nThe fourth and last ORP recognition is for a Spanish public company, with more than 5,500 workers, belonging to SEPI (the company dependent on the Ministry of Finance and Public Function). It is a world leader in the design and construction of military vessels and high-tech civilian ships.\n\nWe are talking about a technologically leading company in which research, development and innovation are strategic areas of the company with the ultimate aim of adapting to the present and future needs of the market.\n\nFor its management model and preventive integration, this recognition goes to Navantia.\n\nThe award was collected by Mr. Ignacio Ramón Cayetano, Director of Prevention and Environment at Navantia.\n\nThe first recognition is for a company with a constant concern for the safety of equipment and operations translated into a demanding occupational risk prevention and control system at all levels of its organisation. This effort has earned them recognition such as the European Seal of Excellence 500+ or the Ibero-American Quality Award (FUNDIBEQ). The development and implementation of innovative IT tools such as Abengoa Easy Management, the Colabora IT platform and the Huella Project have led to significant improvements both in the control of occupational risks in the different companies, work centres and worksites and, especially, in the construction and start-up of major projects in the energy and environment sectors in more than 50 countries on 5 continents.\n\nAn institution that contributes to the formation of road awareness in children from an early age. Through its Road Safety Education Theme Park, it brings teachers and pupils closer to road and citizenship issues, while at the same time fostering universal values such as respect and solidarity in them. Since its opening, this space has received different recognitions. Declared of Interest by the National Road Safety Agency of the Government of Argentina and of Educational and Cultural Interest by different organisations, this initiative has become a powerful tool for building real awareness of the importance of preventing traffic accidents.\n\nIt is not easy for a young company, created in February 1999, to achieve the highest certifications and the integration of management systems. Because in 1999, with an almost recent Law on Occupational Risk Prevention, information and experience were not available. It was a gamble. Therefore, the main objective was to achieve a working methodology, focused on continuous improvement in order to achieve the safety and well-being of all the workers in the organisation, whether they were our own staff or those of collaborating companies. And so, since 2008, it has managed to achieve the standards and requirements of the internationally recognised standard OSHAS 18.001-2007, a unique milestone at national level.\n\nA person who has been able to combine his professional work, outside the world of prevention, with a sensitivity that has led him, over time, to be an accomplice in actions to disseminate the culture of prevention.\n\nThe ORP jury greatly appreciates the fact that dissemination actions go beyond the scope of the law. On this occasion, this recognition has been given to a journalist whose professional life has been linked to Cadena SER and who currently directs the “graffiti” programme on Euskadi radio, a programme with great social content, where he has always been sensitive to introducing elements related to Occupational Health into the programme with the naturalness of someone who understands, intelligently, that everything that happens in working life must have its interrelationship in the social world.\n\nThe company is located in the Basque Country and its sphere of action reaches all corners of the world.\n\nMore than 90% of the activity carried out by the Trápaga Centre in 2011 was destined for export, after having manufactured the propulsion of 91 AVE trains for Renfe. The Trápaga centre inherits the experience of the prominent former General Electric Española, Wes-tinghouse, AEG, Cenemesa and Conelec. Its activity is centred on the development of propulsion and traction systems for vehicles destined for large lines and urban transport. The Trápaga technology centre is undoubtedly one of the most advanced in the world.\n\nIn 2007, the Trápaga plant was the protagonist of a historic milestone for the Spanish railway industry when it was recognised by the IRIS world standard, the railway sector’s certification for excellence in management, compliance with the high demands of quality, continuous improvement, environmental concerns, occupational health and safety and customer satisfaction, among other aspects, which ensure the supply of high quality safety systems. The Trápaga plant was the first Spanish plant to receive this award and the first of the multinational group to do so worldwide."
