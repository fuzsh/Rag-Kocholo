Dell Technologiesâ Paul Perez discusses how\n\nagencies can effectively deploy this game-changing technology to best\n\nserve the mission.\n\nAPRIL/MAY 2024\n\nVOLUME 38\n\nNUMBER 3\n\nP:02\n\nPaul Perez\n\nSenior Fellow,\n\nDell Technologies\n\nWith over 40 years of experience designing and\n\narchitecting computing systems, Dell Technologiesâ Senior\n\nFellow Paul Perez is no stranger to quickly evolving\n\ntechnology landscapes. As the AI boom accelerates\n\nacross the federal space, Perez discusses exactly how the\n\ntechnology will impact agenciesâ architectures and how\n\nthey can prepare to successfully usher in this new era.\n\nQ: Recently, generative AI has exploded onto the market.\n\nHow has it changed things for agencies in terms of\n\nenterprise architecture?\n\nA: There are certainly many changes occurring that will\n\nimpact enterprise architecture, specifically around data\n\ngrowth at the edge and how AI adoption will impact\n\nhybrid, multicloud and edge topology. Importantly, one\n\nissue with generative AI is that it tends to drive energydense environments in terms of power and cooling. In my\n\nexperience, federal agencies vary in terms of readiness for\n\nthese dense deployments. At Dell, we are developing a\n\ntool that will recommend optimized compute and storage\n\ntopologies depending on the AI model, size of the model\n\nand phase of production (training, tuning or inference) that\n\nhas proven to yield the best performance per watt in our\n\ninternal trials.\n\nQ: As AI is more broadly implemented into federal\n\noperations, data governance becomes an increasing\n\nconcern. How can agencies effectively manage and\n\nsecure the data fed into AI models?\n\nA: Behind every successful AI deployment, there is more\n\nthan likely unpublicized successful data management and\n\ndata governance. Data is intellectual property, especially\n\nin the context of AI. And, as with any digital system, what\n\nyou put in is what you get out, so you want to ensure\n\nyour data is robust and clean. That requires strong data\n\ngovernance. The good news is that you can start using\n\nAI techniques to facilitate data management and data\n\ngovernance in ways that are necessary to facilitate AI. For\n\nexample, at Dell weâve had successful trials in adapting\n\nAI capabilities for large-scale data labeling. Lastly, along\n\nwith data governance there is data security. AI and GenAI\n\ndeployments are typically âgreenfield projectsâ â the\n\ninstallation of software, data centers, network, etc. that\n\ndoesnât use previous infrastructure â are prime candidates\n\nfor zero trust cybersecurity controls.\n\nQ: Generative AI requires massive amounts of data\n\nto function properly, which often means increased\n\ncomputing power. What kind of computing architecture is\n\nneeded to support modern AI?\n\nA: AI is not a workload, but a lifecycle: training, tuning,\n\ninference. Infrastructure optimized for heavy training is\n\nvery different than infrastructure tuned for large-scale\n\ninference. In addition, we can also think of AI as an\n\napplication platform service like databases or messaging.\n\nIt all depends on whether a federal customer is looking\n\nat a bespoke deployment â infrastructure tuned to a\n\nspecific AI use case â or adding AI capabilities to a general\n\npurpose computing environment. I would advise federal\n\ncustomers to embrace silicon diversity. Different CPUs\n\nand accelerators, and different ratios of the two, may be\n\nrequired for different workloads. Luckily Dell can provide\n\nthat diversity along with the manageability tools to simplify\n\ndeployment and production life.\n\nLearn More: DellTechnologies.com/Federal\n\nP:03\n\nAPRIL/MAY 2024\n\nVOLUME 38\n\nNUMBER 3\n\nThe\n\n2024\n\nFederal\n\n100\n\n& GOVERNMENT\n\nHALL OF FAME\n\nP:05\n\nNEXTGOV/FCW APRIL/MAY 2024 // 3\n\nThe New Age of AI in\n\nGovernment\n\nThanks to advances in hardware\n\nand software, the use of artifi cial\n\nintelligence is becoming more\n\nwidespread, and AI is now\n\nsupercharging the technologies\n\nthat fuel government\n\nmodernization.\n\nCUSTOM CONTENT:\n\nPRESENTED BY CARAHSOFT\n\nCOVER ILLUSTRATION BY ISTVÃN SZUGYICZKY\n\nAPRIL/MAY 2024\n\nVOLUME 38\n\nNUMBER 3\n\nThe\n\n2024\n\nFederal\n\n100\n\n& GOVERNMENT\n\nHALL OF FAME\n\n77 SERVICE SPOTLIGHTS//\n\nThe future of war\n\nLeaders at the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and the\n\nnascent Space Force are responding to todayâs diverse\n\nthreat environment with new tools and strategies\n\nfor modern combat, from high-tech air tankers to\n\ninformation warfare to operations in lunar space.\n\nBY SAM SKOVE, LAUREN C.

The Office of Personnel Management developed\n\nthe proposal with the Office\n\nof Management and Budget\n\nand the Office of the National\n\nCyber Director.\n\nIf passed into law as currently proposed, the changes\n\nwould give OPM the authority\n\nto establish new cyber workforce classification and pay\n\nsystems in the civil service,\n\naccording to a fact sheet and\n\nlegislative text OPM shared\n\nwith Nextgov/FCW.\n\nThat would allow agencies\n\nto set up higher, market-sensitive pay rates while retaining\n\nmerit system principles, and\n\ncollective bargaining rights\n\nwould remain intact, according\n\nto OPM.\n\nThe package also includes\n\na number of changes to how\n\nand what the government can\n\npay cyber feds and others\n\nwith hard-to-get skills.\n\nThat includes upping the\n\nâcritical payâ amount that\n\nOPM can greenlight for positions central to agency missions that require high levels\n\nof expertise â which could\n\napply not only to feds in cybersecurity, but also to other\n\nhigh-demand jobs. Incentive\n\npay for high-demand skills\n\nwould also see changes.\n\nIn addition, the proposal\n\nwould enable OPM to establish higher special pay\n\nrates for feds in cyber, science, tech, engineering and\n\nmath jobs, as well as higher\n\nmaximum basic pay rates for\n\nsenior executive service and\n\nother senior-level cybersecurity jobs.\n\nThe personnel agency has\n\nbeen working on the legislative package since at least\n\n2022.\n\nOPM Director Kiran Ahuja\n\nhas complained publicly that\n\nspecial cyber talent authorities at the departments of\n\nDefense and Homeland Security were creating internal\n\ncompetition for talent within\n\nthe government.\n\nâWe arenât just competing\n\nwith the private sector,â she\n\nsaid last year. âOftentimes,\n\nwe are competing with\n\nourselves. â¦ DHS can pay for\n\nmore for cyber talent, leaving\n\nother agencies at a competitive disadvantage.â\n\nOPM says its proposal\n\nwould level the playing field\n\nfor agencies and help them\n\nrecruit and retain top talent in\n\na tight market.\n\nâWe wanted to look at a\n\npackage that makes sense\n\ngovernmentwide so we donât\n\nhave more pop-up legislation,\n\nwe have one kind of system\n\nthat fits across government,â\n\nsaid Jason Barke, deputy\n\nassociate director of strategic\n\nworkforce planning at OPM, at\n\na fall 2023 event.\n\nAn aide for Sen.

That\n\ncohort is decidedly smaller but again displays an amazing\n\nrange of roles and transformative work.\n\nThe individuals youâll meet on these pages are largely\n\nunsung heroes. Thereâs an old saying in journalism that nobody writes about the planes that land. But our winners\n\nand inductees have generally made their mark by bringing home essential projects and spotting problems before\n\nthey make headlines. Government simply would not function without the talent, dedication and drive of individuals\n\nlike the ones featured on the pages that follow, and weâre\n\nproud to spotlight them year after year.\n\nThe federal government is a massive enterprise, where\n\nindividual efforts can seem insignifi cant. Yet the Federal\n\n100 and Government Hall of Fame programs make clear\n\nthat exceptional individuals â both in the near term and\n\nover the course of a career â can empower the government to deliver dramatically better results. Read each profi le, and we think youâll agree: Government has its challenges, but this community is rich in the talent and tenacity\n\nneeded to tackle them.\n\nâ The editors\n\nThe 2024 Government Hall of Fame and Federal 100\n\nHONORING THE INDIVIDUAL EXCELLENCE THAT POWERS GOVERNMENT\n\nSTEFANI REYNOLDS/GETTY IMAGES\n\nP:26\n\nFulfilling\n\nthe mission\n\nWe are honored to celebrate the leaders and trailblazers who serve the\n\npublic and have been pivotal in transforming our past, present, and future.\n\nCongratulations to the 2024 Government Hall of Fame inductees\n\nand Federal 100 award winners.\n\nÂ© 2024 AT&TÂ Intellectual Property.

Its\n\nposition as the leading supplier of technology to\n\nfederal agencies is âone of the things I love about\n\nGSA,â he said in an interview. He calls his post âa\n\ntechieâs dream job.â\n\nâOne of the things that excited me about coming to GSA and has kept me around is the fact\n\nthat we donât do to our partners what we havenât\n\ntried out on ourselves fi rst,â Shive said. âWhat\n\nthat means is a lot of our outward-facing products\n\nand services got their start on the inside, where\n\nwe would have an idea and try it at scale within\n\nthe agency fi rst.â\n\nShive ticked off a long series of fi rsts at GSA,\n\nsome predating his arrival. It was the fi rst agency\n\nto have an internet connection on every desktop,\n\nthe fi rst to have an open-source software strategy,\n\nthe fi rst to hire a chief customer offi cer and the\n\nfi rst to do agile implementation.\n\nâAnd these fi rsts are because of a tendency\n\nto lean forward. But we donât do it just because\n\nitâs cool,â he said. âWe do it because we use ourselves as a proving ground to then scale some of\n\nthat great thinking out through our products and\n\nservices that we project out to the agencies and\n\nthe citizens who are end users of these services.â\n\nShive has also seen the roles of government and\n\nprivate-sector CIOs morph over the years from\n\nserving as a âchief tech bean counterâ managing\n\na portfolio of technology investments to a true\n\nbusiness advisor to the front offi ce. And, Shive\n\nnotes, itâs increasingly common to fi nd tech experience on the resumes of top leaders.\n\nâI suspect that in government, you may not\n\nsee former CIOs coming in and running federal\n\nagencies, but what youâll see are CEO types who\n\nhave meaningful experience in tech domains, as\n\na 21st-century executive should, and being able\n\nto employ those technology strategies to better\n\nsupport the business mission.â\n\nShive has also seen the pace of change accelerate dramatically inside of government, especially\n\nrecently with hard pivots on cybersecurity, customer experience, digital identity, cloud adoption\n\nand more.\n\nâWhen I talk with my private-sector CIO peers,\n\nthey are shocked at how fast we move here in government. Thereâs been a long-standing misnomer\n\nthat government operates at a very plodding pace,\n\nthat weâre behind the private sector,â Shive said.\n\nâAnd you know what? Thatâs just not true. Having\n\nworked in both, I know that the quality of the technology outcomes supporting the businesses of the\n\nagencies that we serve is equal to or better than\n\nthe best of the best out in the private sector.â\n\nâ Adam Mazmanian\n\nP:33\n\nNEXTGOV/FCW APRIL/MAY 2024 // 31\n\nZAID HAMID\n\nP:34\n\n32 // APRIL/MAY 2024 NEXTGOV/FCW\n\nP:35\n\nNEXTGOV/FCW APRIL/MAY 2024 // 33\n\nSinai\n\nNick\n\nTHE INDUSTRY\n\nEAGLE AWARD\n\nNick Sinai can trace the launch of his career as a\n\nleader in government technology delivery to the\n\n2008 fi nancial crisis.\n\nSinai and his new wife had taken a red-eye fl ight\n\nto Italy for their honeymoon that September. Upon\n\nlanding, Sinai learned about the collapse of Lehman\n\nBrothers from a newspaper headline. Heâd been\n\nplanning on starting a job at Lehmanâs venture arm\n\nupon his return, but when that offer evaporated, he\n\nhad to look elsewhere for work.\n\nHe was hired at the Federal Communications\n\nCommission to work on the National Broadband\n\nplan, an ambitious effort to incentivize the development of high-speed internet across the U.S.\n\nwhile transitioning to faster mobile technologies.\n\nâThat was my fi rst exposure to policymaking as\n\na grown-up, and it was tremendously exciting,â\n\nSinai said.\n\nThat experience connected him with a new generation of government techies who were starting\n\nto focus on then-novel concepts like agile development and user-centered design. He joined the White\n\nHouse Offi ce of Science and Technology Policy under Chief Technology Offi cer Aneesh Chopra as an\n\nadvisor and served as deputy CTO under Chopraâs\n\nsuccessors Todd Park and Megan Smith.\n\nBefore long, the Healthcare.gov debacle saw a\n\nlot of the staff of OSTP detailed to the rescue effort. Sinai stayed at OSTP, but some of the programs he sponsored supplied personnel needed to\n\nget Healthcare.gov on track â and helped supply\n\na proof of concept for in-house digital innovation\n\ngroups like 18F and the U.S. Digital Service.\n\nThe experience and knowledge gained at OSTP\n\nalso provided fodder for the 2022 book Hack Your\n\nBureaucracy, co-written by Sinai and former Veterans Affairs CTO Marina Nitze.\n\nThe tactics in the book are âfundamentally\n\nabout understanding the organization and understanding people and processes and why things\n\nare the way they are before you go try and disrupt them and change them,â Sinai said. âSome\n\npeople think âhackâ is a pejorative term, but we really see it as a way to improve government, and it\n\nstarts with understanding the problem space and\n\nunderstanding the end users.â\n\nToday Sinai works as an investment advisor, but\n\nthat description doesnât cover his impact on the federal technology community.\n\nâHe has a deep understanding of the policymaking process â¦ he has the judgment of an investor\n\nfocused on early-stage companies capable of identifying sparks that might scale to deliver meaningful\n\nimpact, and he is a talented operator who can see\n\nthe kindling of promising ideas all the way through\n\nimplementation,â Chopra told Nextgov/FCW.\n\nA former colleague, Erie Meyer, now chief technologist at the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, said that Sinai is âone of the fi rst lifelines I call\n\nwhen I have a hard problem.â\n\nâNick is smart, tough and kind,â Meyer said. âIâve\n\nlearned a lot from him, but my favorite thing is the\n\ndiscipline of how to learn a lot from people. Heâs\n\nconstantly cultivating community, helping people\n\nstretch and asking sharp questions.â\n\nâ Adam Mazmanian ZAID HAMID\n\nP:36\n\n34 // APRIL/MAY 2024 NEXTGOV/FCW\n\nJames Adams\n\nSenior Advisor\n\nJohns Hopkins Applied Physics\n\nLaboratory\n\nAnn Amrhein\n\nAssociate CIO\n\nSocial Security Administration\n\nDan Anthony\n\nExecutive Vice President and\n\nCIO, FedNow Service\n\nFederal Reserve Financial\n\nServices\n\nCol.

Stipulated by a May 2022 executive\n\norder signed by President Joe Biden, NLEAD documents\n\nserious federal law enforcement misconduct, including use\n\nof excessive force, making false reports, engaging in bias or\n\ndiscrimination and sexual misconduct. Merrickâs colleagues\n\npraised his expert oversight of NLEADâs development and\n\nits launch within a short four months.\n\nAdele Merritt\n\nIntelligence Community CIO, Offi ce of\n\nthe Director of National Intelligence\n\nIf you follow Merritt, you already\n\nknow about her commitment to the\n\nfederal workforce. Often, sometimes\n\ndaily, sheâll put out tech-related\n\nannouncements about open positions within the IC and\n\nbroader federal government, evidence that âshe has\n\nbeen a visible champion for recruiting and retaining the IC\n\ntechnology workforce of the future,â according to one of her\n\nnominators. In the past year, sheâs also championed zerotrust tenants within the IC â moving from risk avoidance\n\nto risk management â built partnerships among the IC,\n\nacademia and industry, and delivered key IC strategies\n\naround data and information technology.\n\nJ. Christopher Mihm\n\nFellow, National Academy of Public\n\nAdministration\n\nMihm was lead author on an initiative\n\nto help prepare the government\n\nfor future destabilizing shocks\n\nand emergencies in areas like\n\ncybersecurity and sustainability. The work â conducted\n\nby the IBM Center for the Business of Government and\n\nthe IBM Institute for Business Value with the National\n\nAcademy of Public Administration â included international\n\nroundtables to capture lessons for a series of reports, at\n\nleast two of which Mihm authored, to offer actionable\n\nsolutions to build government resilience. In this work, he\n\nhas drawn on his expertise from over 37 years of work in\n\nthe U.S. Government Accountability Offi ce.\n\nRenata Miskell\n\nDeputy Assistant Secretary, Accounting\n\nPolicy and Financial Transparency,\n\nDepartment of the Treasury\n\nMiskell only started her new gig as\n\na deputy assistant secretary at the\n\nTreasury Department early last year,\n\nbut sheâs already producing results in payment integrity â\n\nan important effort for the Treasury as a dispersing agency\n\nfor the government. Miskell particularly zeroed in on the\n\nuse of data and technology to keep pace with fraudsters\n\nand identify vulnerabilities in the system. Her agency has\n\nalready saved hundreds of millions by using AI-powered\n\nfraud detection processes. And sheâs not limiting her\n\nimpact to Treasury alone; sheâs working across agency\n\nboundaries to champion the cause of payment integrity.\n\nP:61\n\nCongratulations\n\nto this year's\n\nFed100 nominees\n\nand winners!\n\nRubrik stands proudly alongside federal agencies,\n\nfortifying our nation's critical infrastructure and\n\nsafeguarding its most precious data.
