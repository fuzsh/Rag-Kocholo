Provider extends supply chain execution capabilities

Chicago — March 9, 2006 — SSA Global Technologies Inc., a global provider of extended enterprise solutions and services, today announced the acquisition of Provia Software Inc., an order-to-delivery supply chain execution (SCE) solutions provider.

SSA Global said the acquisition provides it with a small-to-medium market SCE solution that is a cost-effective approach for distribution-intensive companies. Customers now have access to an integrated Web services offering that features warehouse management, order management, analytics, transportation management and radio frequency identification (RFID) capabilities.

Provia's solution complements SSA Global's existing supply chain management (SSA SCM) offerings, which target larger, high-volume distribution fulfillment customers. By adding Provia, SSA Global said it can now offer demand driven solutions for any size company's supply chain.

Both SSA Global and Provia serve these same industries, including third-party logistics (3PL), consumer packaged goods, food and beverage, high-tech and electronics, wholesale, and retail.

Through the Provia acquisition, SSA Global is bringing new capabilities to companies in industries we already know and serve, said Mike Greenough, chairman, president and CEO of SSA Global. SSA Global offers Provia customers and prospects an SCE solution supported by the strength and financial viability of a large software solutions partner.

SSA SCM, which includes SSA Advanced Planning and Scheduling, SSA Warehouse Management and SSA Transportation Management, is a solution utilized by retailers, logistics and distribution companies, and manufacturing firms to join the demand chain with the supply chain. Companies using the solution can forecast demand; take an order; give a promise date; source and manufacture the right goods; position inventory; and pick, pack and ship while maintaining a minimal finished goods inventory.
