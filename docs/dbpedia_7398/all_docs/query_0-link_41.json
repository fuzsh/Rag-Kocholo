Since the World Trade Organisation is a rule based international organization and members are primarily sovereign states the law of the WTO is a specific type of international law. Despite its prominence the WTO is poorly understood. Most of the people who have profound interest in the WTO are not lawyers. They are mainly economists political scientists and members of the public. For them it is difficult to understand how the WTO an organisation overseeing international trade is subject to Public International Law and how the law of the WTO can have effect on them who are subject to the national laws of a particular sovereign state. The present paper is an attempt to answer these questions. It sees the WTO from international law perspective. As the WTO agreements are treaties the law of the WTO is nothing but international law. The paper analyses briefly the functioning of the WTO Agreements the WTO dispute settlement mechanism the sources of the WTO law and how the WTO law is applied in the domestic sphere of Member States. The papers concludes with suggestions for improvement. 304 pp.\n\nHardcover. Condition: new. Hardcover. There are over a billion Indians alive today. But are some more Indian than others?

The volumes of Project on the History of Science Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization aim at discovering the main aspects of India's heritage and present them in an interrelated way. In spite of their unitary look these volumes recognize the difference between the areas of material civilization and those of ideational culture. The project is not being executed by a single group of thinkers and writers who are methodologically uniform or ideologically identical in their commitments. The project is marked by what may be called methodological pluralism. In spite of its primarily historical character this project both in its conceptualization and execution has been shaped by scholars drawn from different disciplines. It is for the first time that an endeavour of such a unique and comprehensive character has been undertaken to study critically a major world civilization. The present volume on Islam forms a part of the other volumes of the PHISPC under The Religious Systems of India. The conceiving of this volume speaks of the thoughtfulness of the Centre for Studies in Civilizations as Islam is the religion of the largest minority in India. Islam's presence in India is practically as old as Islam itself. Naturally it has undergone important changes and development in India. These developments are in the fields of commentaries of the Quran and Hadiths Jurisprudence Sufism Philosophy and culture. Our efforts are directed to project and highlight these developments through the articles included in this volume. It is hoped that the volume will be of interest to those who want to know Islam and Muslims in India rather closely. Most of.\n\nHardcover. Condition: New. 1st Edition. Contents: 1.
