After the expiry of the Deportation Liability Notice period and expiry of the time to file the appeal to the Tribunal, he was issued with deportation order. Mr Singh engaged Barrister & Solicitor Gurbrinder Aulakh to act for him. Judicial Review Mr Aulakh filed Judicial Review proceedings at the Auckland High Court against the deportation order on behalf of his client. At the first Case Conference, the Judge noted that the respondent, INZ (precisely, MBIE Chief Executive) had only been served with the notice of proceedings a day before and therefore, it was twitter /indiannewslink effectively a ‘Without Notice’ basis. The Judge also noted that although there was a quasi-application for interim relief along with the affidavit of the applicant, there was no separate written application to stay the order pending the Judicial Review. The Judge directed the applicant to file the same for consideration by the High Court. Appeal for Interim Relief The applicant then filed the interlocutory application for interim relief. Mr Aulakh challenged the deportation order on several counts as violating his client’s rights. The matter was then listed to come up before the Duty Judge as the first call for interim relief. Following the service of the interlocutory application, the respondent, through Crown Counsel, filed a written assurance that no steps to deport the applicant will be taken, pending the outcome of the review proceeding. A joint memo of the Counsel was then filed requesting the Court to adjourn the matter to a later date, for the parties to consider their respective position, and for substantive hearing. Mr Aulakh declined to divulge more details of the case saying, “the matter is subjudice, and therefore it will not be appropriate for me to comment.” The case will be in the High Court for substantive hearing in the following weeks.

A notification said that Tradies who do undeclared cash jobs can be hit with tax penalties or criminal convictions that could lead to prison, costing them their business and income. “Declare it all. Or risk everything,” the notification said. An accountant told <strong>Indian</strong> <strong>Newslink</strong> that it was not uncommon for some people in the building trade (such as plumbers, electricians, cleaners and others) to demand cash for their services and some customers willingly doing so to avoid GST. Honest Tradies “Most tradies are honest and issue invoices and request customers to transfer payments into High Court asks INZ to hold fire on deportation Venkat Raman venkat@indiannewslink.co.nz The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) which supervises Immigration New Zealand (INZ) has given a written undertaking to the Auckland High Court that it will not execute a deportation order on a man of <strong>Indian</strong> origin, pending a judicial review. The man, known only as Mr Singh, had been issued with a Deportation Liability Notice. Mr Singh said that he has been a New Zealand resident for many years and that he was lately on a work visa. their bank account. However, some people prefer cash. I have advised two of my clients to issue invoices and document all cash received. Tradies are busy people and good accountants should take care of them,” he said. The IRD communication said that doing jobs for cash or doing work for friends or anyone else is alright, so long as they keep a record of these jobs and declare the income earned while filing their tax returns. “Make sure that you record every job, no matter how big or small. Find out more about Gurbrinder Aulakh Allegation of breach INZ had issued a deportation liability Notice last year stating that he had breached visa conditions and was given 14 days to either show cause as to why he should not be deported or file an appeal to the Immigration and Protection Tribunal within 28 days. keeping good business records from our website. You should charge GST if you are registered. All businesses earning more than $60,000 must register for GST. Tradies must also register all their employees and declare all income while filing tax returns,” the notification said. Voluntary Disclosure IRD has also advised that tradies and others who have not filed their actual income, have an opportunity to do so under its ‘Voluntary Disclosure’ through its IR281 Form. The advice is, “Tell us before we find out that you have hidden something from us” “A Voluntary Disclosure is when you tell us what is wrong with your tax returns before we find out in some other way. It may be that you have omitted some income from your return or incorrectly claimed expenses. Anyone can make a Voluntary Disclosure, including salary or wage earners, individuals, businesses, trusts and employers.” New Accounting Method IRD has also recommended small companies to understand the way Provisional Tax works and adopt the new Accounting Income Method (AIM). The Department has urged businesses with annual turnover under $5 million to talk with their accounting software provider or tax agent about a new option that allows them to pay provisional tax only when they are making a profit. Deputy Commissioner for Transformation Greg James said that AIM makes managing cash flows simpler because provisional tax payments are based on the business’ actual results. “IRD has created a product that takes the guesswork out of provisional tax payments,” he said. Businesses take a stab in the dark about their projected earnings for the current year. When that’s off the mark, it can lead to either an overpayment of tax and a long wait for a refund or an underpayment and a penalty charge.
