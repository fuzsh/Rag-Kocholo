        "text": "The paper looks at the mystique of the poetic process and the manner in which the subterranean cultural and primal patterns of the mind of the poet – Yasmeen Hameed, manifest themselves in the lyrics. Contrary to the western paradigm of duality such patterns are studied in the light of the oriental Sufi tradition where I and you pine for each other. The thee is perceived as the core and the me is in a perpetual quest/voyage gyrating towards the core. The convergence of these two poles is the unison that has both aesthetic/intellectual relevance as well as spiritual resonances for the reader and the poet alike. This gravitational pull finds expression in an idiom that is almost metaphysical in the poetry of Yasmeen Hameed. The paper explores how the two poles of the artistic process, the technical craftsmanship and content converge and finds expression in a language that is transparent as well as veiled. It also studies the way in which the visceral, existential poetic experience con...\n\nAbstract Agha Shahid Ali is a Kashmiri American poet; he can be referred as the Bard who sings about the pain, suffering and oppression inflicted on the people of his homeland. There is a constant sense of loss and lamentation with political undertone of protest pervasive throughout his poetry. He laments the loss of a paradise which is now submerged in the “blood dimmed tide”. His poems revolve around both thematic and cultural poles and there are references of complete and all pervasive sense of loss in his works, this is what the paper grapples with how he juxtaposes images of golden past with that of bleak images of modern times, in order to understand the culturally barren times we are living in. Ali through his poetry tries to fulfill his “double “duty as a Diaspora writer, one of asserting his identity and other of upholding the culture of his homeland\n\nSubalterns, the palpable fuel of society's power structure, are always marginalized by the tormentors from the corridors of power. The oppressors use their life force to make them oppressed. One of the main tasks of literature is to reveal the truth of society. Kazi Nazrul Islam and Faiz Ahmed Faiz, two prominent revolutionary poets in the Indian subcontinent, spoke on behalf of the masses but in two different languages (Bengali and Urdu). Their poems still carry considerable importance in the context of contemporaneity. The exploitation of the power-centric society and resistance of the subaltern have come alive through their poetry. The poets undertaken for the present research consistently speak out against ethnic violence and political exploitation in their verses. The words for the wretched are always uttered in their voice. They have portrayed the misery of the marginalized people and suggested the way of achieving true freedom. Their poems transcend their time because of the universality of their contents and themes. Their poems intrinsically support subaltern studies worldwide. This study aims to compare Kazi Nazrul Islam and Faiz Ahmed Faiz on the grounds of their concerns for the subaltern and their resistance infusing with three theoretical concepts, subaltern, power, theory of resistance. The study will further focus on how the two poets with their similarities have depicted the marginalized voice of the subalterns.\n\nThe socio-political environment of a nation leaves an enormous impact on the individual and collective trends and thinking of its people. More than the thinking of the layman, it influences the thinking of the writers and poets, who are the highly perceptive and sensitive class of society. The socio-economic and political impact of the ordinary or even extra-ordinary events, also known as the spirit of the age is evidently reflected through the poetry and other writings of the poets and writers of a society. The Afghan land, and the Pashtun region on the Pakistani side of the border, which is a part of Pakistan, has remained a witness to war and terrorism for a period which is spread over four decades. During this period, a whole generation was born and grew up. The impact of the socio-political conditions on the millennials' poetry on both sides of the border is visible in their poetry and can also be deeply felt by the reader. This is also an age of awareness through social media and that influence is also visible in their poetry. The awareness of the millennials about socio-political scenarios around them is really amazing, as it is a rarity in the writings of females of a few decades back. The restriction of females into the domestic sphere and their exclusion from the public sphere limits them to the household and domestic world. The wider social world belongs to man amongst the Pashtuns. The very open expression of these millennials is a like silver lining in the dark world of FOCUS 80 Pashtuns and may bring far reaching positive results. One book of every Pashtun millennial, two from Afghanistan and two from Pakistan, have been studied for this paper. From the four books of the four millennials, sixty-six ghazals (a form of poetry) and other poems have been selected for a more profound analysis and also to explore the trends, approaches and understandings of these young minds about the social and political world around them. The outlook of these four millennials from the very conservative Pashtun society and their understanding of the social and political issues around them is amazing despite the so many restrictions even on the thinking of Pashtun women.\n\nShad was a poet, critic, playwright, researcher and an intellectual. In beginning he wrote poetry in Urdu and later in the Balochi language. Shad is considered the architect of modern symbolic Balochi poetry. He was inspired by the tutelage of Faiz Ahmed Faiz but soon felt the need to evolve his own style of poetry. His marvelous style gave him a prominent place in the literary quarters. His poetries are whole which cover all the aspects of Baloch Society. Hence, his poetries not only delight the readers but represent the socio-culture, economic life and many social problems of everyday life. Therefore, this paper is an attempt to demonstrate Atta’s art in the portrayal of socio-cultural approach through his poems, “Shepank/Shepherd” and “Dil Greet O Shap Naret/ Heart weeps and night moans”.The nature of the research is qualitative and researcher used textual analysis for the present study. However, the findings exhibit that Atta Shad as a whole discussed the social life of human be...\n\nUrdu literature in general and Urdu poetry in particular, always played its part in generating, shaping and mobilizing the Indian public opinion and defeated thereof all the odds of time and space during India's progressive journey. Accordingly, Urdu literature resisted the British imperialism from its very beginning. However, during 1940's, when British employed in full swing, all Machiavellian, ideological, political and military tools to maintain their imperial permanence in India, thereby dividing Indians on different grounds, Urdu poetry performed well its moral responsibility of generating and mobilizing united public opinion against British rule. Urdu poets fought British Raj by inculcating among Indians spirit of unity, patriotism, and sacrifice. Urdu poetry besides giving a vide space to all forms of anti-British resistance going on in India and abroad, also quickened the pace of freedom movement by mobilizing the public opinion against British Raj. This piece of research therefore, explores the dominant nationalistic trends in Urdu poetry during 1940's by analyzing three Urdu poems.\n\nThe purpose of this analysis is to expose the issue of ideology enforcement in poems Chadur and Char-Diwari (CCD) by Fahmida Riaz, Gracefully She Approached (GSA) by Simin Behbahani, and Daughter of Afghanistan (DOA) by Nadia Anjuman. The issue of ideology enforcement refers to the patriarchy system strategies in applying their rules to the women. The problem of this analysis is to find how far these poems expose the issue of the patriarchy system&#39;s ideology enforcement. This analysis aims to expose men&#39;s rule influence toward the Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan women. This analysis uses the contribution of poetic elements; imagery, symbol, and diction in revealing the issue of the patriarchy system&#39;s ideology enforcement. The analysis is based on the concept of a feminist by Kate Millet, Naomi Wolf, and Betty Friedan that is supported by the text and context-based interpretation. The result of this analysis is the strategy of the patriarchy system enforcing their ideolo..."
