        "text": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 19 (APP): Allama Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the leader of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan breathed his last Thursday night at Lahore, his party announced. He was 55.\n\nNo reason for his death was given. His party officials said he was rushed to a hospital after he had problem breathing and had fever for past few days. However he was pronounced dead when he arrived at the hospital.\n\nSenior TLP leader Syed Inayat-ul-Haq Shah also confirmed the news and asked the TLP workers to proceed to Lahore to participate in his last rites. The Tehreek-e-Labbaik announced that his funeral would be held on Saturday at 10 in the morning at Minar-e-Pakistan.\n\nVideos on several social media accounts showed large number of his followers rushing to his home and crying over his sad demise.\n\nThe fire brand clerk was known for his protest marches, that often became violent and created law and order problems. His last protest was relatively shorter at Faizabad and ended only after a two day blockade of the twin cities on Monday.\n\nImmediately after the confirmation of the news condolences poured in from all sections of society; including the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, Information Minister, Chief of Army Staff, Chief Minister Punjab and political leaders of many parties.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan in a tweet expressed his grief over the sad demise of Allama Khadim Rizvi and conveyed condolences to his family.\n\nChief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa also conveyed his condolences over the demise of the TLP leader.\n\nDr Firdous Ashiq Awan, Special Assistant to the Chief Minister on Information in Punjab also expressed grief over his sad demise.\n\nAmir Jamat Islami also expressed his grief and prayed to Allah Almighty to bless the departed soul.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an abortive attempt to create diversion from Narendra Modi’s human rights abuses in Kashmir, the Indian media went berserk by propagating fake news about a “civil war” like situation in Karachi, triggering a hilarious response from the twitterati in Pakistan, who enjoyed every bit of the ridiculous reports.\n\n#CivilWarInPakistan and #KarachiCivilWar were in no time the top trends, with the young twitter users going crazy by posting video clips from action movies, comics, images of the Indian MiG pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, shot down by Pakistan Air Force inside Pakistan’s territory, as scenes from the Civil War, getting an equally enthusiastic response with numerous retweets and likes.\n\nThe arrest of PML-N leader Captain (Retd) Safdar on charges of political sloganeering at Quaid’s Mausoleum and leave applications by senior police officers was exploited by the top Indian news channels, who portrayed an administrative issue as a “civil war” and went to the extent of even reporting casualties, and armed clashes.\n\nIndian Media ditches professionalism to dip at to its lowest\n\nThe news reports were part of a persistent barrage of fake news from Indian mainstream media and its RAW controlled assets on social media over the past few months. The trend has witnessed a sharp spike as part of India’s fifth generation war (5GW) against Pakistan.\n\nPakistan’s Foreign Office on the “malicious and fabricated propaganda” by Indian mainstream and social media claiming civil unrest in Pakistan, said planting such baseless stories were reflective of the “Pakistan-obsessed BJP-RSS” mindset.\n\n“Needless to say that Indian media continues to hit new lows,” he said, when asked to respond over the series of fake news flashed as breaking news across the Indian media about a “civil war in Pakistan”.\n\n“Indian media continues to hit new lows”: FO\n\nThe Spokesperson said through “peddling fake news and running propaganda machinery”, India could not wash away the truth about its own gross and systematic human rights violations in Indian Ilelgally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\n\n“Rather than reporting on humanitarian crisis in IIOJK, the Indian media chooses to spread fake and sensational news about Pakistan to detract from core issues,” he said.\n\n5th Gen War – Twitterati bust RAW’s #Fake letter attributed to COAS\n\nThe Indian media tried hard to appease its own consumers and to create a diversion from its human rights abuses in occupied Kashmir. However in its abortive attempt it created history by churning out fake news overpowered by the anti-Pakistan hysteria, undermining its professional ethics and credibility.\n\nThe unleashing of the Indian media did not go unnoticed, as Michael Kugelman, deputy director at the @AsiaProgram and South Asia senior associate @TheWilsonCenter in a tweet pointed that the Indian disinformation accounts were exploiting Pakistan’s current political crisis, and “falsely claiming that the country is no experiencing urban warfare.”\n\nHe described the trend as “dangerous and disturbing”, as several of these accounts were verified and had huge followings.\n\nMinister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari said the Indian media was in “hyper drive with fake news on Pakistan” and regretted that it was “unfortunate that Twitter is [deliberately ignoring it].”\n\nAll major media outlets in so-called world’s biggest democracy decimated all journalistic norms as none bothered to fact-check such a huge gaffe. India’s News18, India Today, Zee News, India.com and several others quoted the International Herald which showed old videos of bomb explosions in Pakistan and portrayed it as the ongoing civil war.\n\nThe Institute of Policy Research in a report said their data indicates a pattern of Indian propaganda against Pakistan on digital media that grew exponentially after 2018 General Elections in #Pakistan. The propaganda hovers around largely 4 key themes.\n\nMinister for Ports and Shipping pointed that the Indian propaganda was at its peak and “sadly fueled by the PDM Circus.” He said the food inflation was artificially manufactured, but was being brought under control.\n\nMinister for Kashmir Affairs also lambasted the “fake, fabricated and malicious propaganda campaign to malign State institutions of Pakistan. He urged @Twitter to take action against Indian accounts for #FakeNews against Paksitan.\n\nHowever, this idiocy of Indian media gave the Twitterati a perfect chance to enjoy as the microblogging site was flooded with messages to ridicule the Indian media’s insanity.\n\n“Karachi civil war has gotten so bad that my food panda delivery boy had to crawl through mine fields carrying his AK47, RPG & 9mm along with my nihari and Biryani. This thing is getting so serious. Multiple cows have been killed & people are dying of over eating. #IndianMedia,” commented renowned singer Fakhr-e-Alam.\n\nBesides numerous other fake photos, the Indian media also used an image of a building collapsed following a gas leakage blast in Karachi earlier in the day to substantiate its fake news of civil war.\n\n“A little investigation would have informed Zee News that it wasn’t a bomb blast in ‘civil war’ in Pakistan but the result of a gas leak in Karachi. Whither truth, objectivity, balance and fairness in reporting?,” said Farhatullah Babr, former senator of Pakistan Peoples Party which rules Sindh province.\n\n“An Aircraft shot during civil war in Karachi… and the pilot captured…,” commented another Twitter user Fasihuddin while sharing the images of Indian aircraft MiG-21 and captured injured pilot Abhinandan following an aerial dogfight during India-Pakistan standoff in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nISLAMABAD, Aug 29 (APP): Minister for Finance and Revenue Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday chaired a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet.\n\nThe meeting was attended by Minister for Privatization Abdul Aleem Khan, Minister for Petroleum Musadik Masood Malik, Minister for Power Sardar Awais Khan Leghari, Minister of State for Finance & Revenue Ali Parvez Malik.\n\nGovernor State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Chairman SECP, federal secretaries, and other senior officers of the relevant ministries also attended the meeting, said a press release.\n\nThe ECC considered a summary of Ministry of Communications regarding “Execution of Frame-work Agreement between China and Pakistan on Realignment of KKH (Thakot-Raikot) under CPEC”.\n\nAfter detailed discussions and deliberations, and in order to comply with the codal requirements, the ECC allowed the Ministry of Communications/National Highway Authority to proceed with provisions of the framework agreement in accordance with provisions of Rule-5 of Public Procurement Rules, 2004 for procurement of construction of realignment of KKH (Thakot Raikot Section 241 KM) project under CPEC (Phase-II).\n\nThe ECC considered another Summary of Ministry of Communications regarding “Chakdara-Timergara, 39 km Road Project (N-45)”. It was discussed that Rule-5 of Public Procurement Rules-2004 PPRA can be invoked after the authorization of ECC and consultations with relevant stakeholders.\n\nForegoing in view, the ECC authorized the Ministry of Communications/National Highway Authority to proceed in accordance with Public Procurement Rule-5 in Procurement of Consultancy Services required for Section-1 (Chakdara-Timergara, 39km) under Chakdara-Chitral Road Project (N-45).\n\nLastly, a Summary of Finance Division regarding “Proposal for Revision in Home Remittances Incentive Schemes” was also considered.\n\nAfter detailed discussion and deliberation, as per the proposal of SBP, the ECC approved the following revisions to the two Remittances Incentive Schemes including Reimbursement of Telegraphic Transfer (TT) Charges Scheme.The flat reimbursement rate of SAR 30 per eligible transaction will be divided into Fixed (SAR 20) and Variable (SAR 08-15) components.\n\nThe variable component will be linked to the incremental growth in remittances and banks will receive higher rewards based on their performance in increasing remittances inflows.\n\nIncentive Scheme for Exchange Companies (ECS) and the base rate for the fixed component will be increased from Rs 1 to Rs 2 per USD surrendered.\n\nThe variable component will be linked to the incremental growth in remittances and ECSs will receive higher rewards based on their performance in mobilizing remittances.\n\nThese revisions are expected to further incentivize banks and exchange companies to increase remittance inflows, thereby boosting the country’s foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nISLAMABAD, Aug 29 (APP): Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue, Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday reiterated the government’s unwavering commitment to bolstering the energy sector and expressed confidence in PQEPC’s significant role in meeting Pakistan’s energy demands.\n\nThe minister held a productive meeting with a delegation from the Port Qasim Electric Power Company (PQEPC), which was led by Yang Tianyu, President of Power China Resources, said a press release issued by the Ministry of Finance.\n\nMinister for Energy (Power Division), Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari, Minister of State for Finance and Revenue, Ali Pervaiz Malik, Secretary of Power Division, and senior officials from the Finance Division attended the meeting.\n\nSenator Aurangzeb emphasized the significance of collaborative efforts between Pakistani and Chinese companies in advancing sustainable and efficient energy solutions.\n\nThe meeting focused on various matters related to the power sector including the payments to the energy producers and possible ways to resolve the issues hindering timely payments. Matters related to the technical and financial feasibility of converting these projects to run on domestic coal, thereby reducing reliance on imported fuel were also discussed.\n\nThe Chinese side was informed that the government is taking a number of steps to facilitate this transition including the launch of a railway line to ensure smooth and effective transformation of local coal.\n\nThe Finance Minister also briefed the delegation on the structural reforms being undertaken by the government, particularly in the energy sector, and the ongoing privatization of power supply companies and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). He assured the delegation of the government’s steadfast commitment to providing all necessary support and taking swift action to overcome any challenges impeding the operation of these power plants.\n\nThe Finance Minister reaffirmed the government’s full commitment to honoring all obligations, particularly in government-to-government projects, and maintaining the sanctity of contracts in both letter and spirit. He expressed confidence that, through mutual understanding and cooperation, both sides could develop sustainable solutions to the core issues facing the power sector, ensuring its long-term viability.\n\nIn response, the President of PQEPC expressed appreciation for the government’s efforts in implementing energy sector reforms and thanked the government for its continued support in reviving the operations of the Port Qasim coal projects.\n\nThe meeting concluded with an agreement to establish a working group comprising members from PQEPC, the Power Division, and the Finance Division. This group will monitor progress on a day-to-day basis to ensure timely and effective implementation of the agreed-upon initiatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalik Khizar Zaman\n\nCHENGDU, Aug 29 (APP): Media organizations from over 75 countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) have pledged to work collaboratively to further the spirit of the ancient Silk Road, strengthen international ties, and contribute to the high-quality development of the mega project.\n\nThis consensus was reached during the 2024 Media Cooperation Forum on Belt and Road, which commenced on Wednesday in Chengdu, the capital of China’s Sichuan Province.\n\nThe forum, jointly organized by China’s leading media outlet, People’s Daily, and the Government of Sichuan Province, brought together representatives from more than 200 media outlets. Under the theme “Enhance Media Cooperation for Common Development,” the two-day event emphasized the crucial role of media in building consensus and pooling collective strengths to promote the high-standard cooperation envisaged under the BRI.\n\nA significant outcome of the forum was the adoption of the “Belt and Road Media Cooperation: Chengdu Initiative,” which underscores the media community’s commitment to fostering mutually beneficial engagement among BRI participants.\n\nThe Chengdu Initiative highlights the successes of the BRI since its inception, noting that participating countries have prioritized connectivity, leading to enhance policy coordination, infrastructure development, seamless trade, financial integration, and stronger people-to-people ties. These efforts have bolstered global connectivity, created platforms for international economic cooperation, and stimulated global economic growth.\n\nAs the BRI enters a new phase, it stresses the continued importance of media collaboration in promoting cultural exchange and mutual understanding. The document calls on media outlets to embrace the principles of joint consultation, construction, and shared benefits, and to disseminate fair, objective, and truthful information. It also warns against bias, fake news, and misinformation, advocating for deeper connections among all parties involved.\n\nParticipants in the forum agreed that the collective power of the media should be harnessed to effectively narrate stories of the BRI’s contributions to common development, regional cooperation, and global governance. The forum also highlighted the BRI’s role in enhancing people-to-people exchanges and facilitating mutual learning among civilizations.\n\nSince its launch in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping, the BRI has made significant progress in global infrastructure development, reviving historic Silk Road routes, and supporting numerous projects across participating countries. Notably, the Gwadar Port in Pakistan, a key component of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), stands as a testament to the BRI’s robust development and progress.\n\nThe forum featured parallel sessions on regional cooperation, media dialogue, and cultural development within the Belt and Road framework. An exhibition showcased the BRI’s achievements, and media delegates are scheduled to visit various BRI projects in Sichuan to gain first-hand insights into their progress and impact.\n\nThe BRI is projected to significantly boost global trade and economic growth. The World Bank estimates a 4.1% increase in trade among participating countries, a reduction in global trade costs by up to 2.2%, and an overall GDP growth of 2.6% to 3.9% for developing countries in East Asia and the Pacific. Additionally, the Centre for Economics and Business Research forecasts that the BRI could contribute $7.1 trillion annually to global GDP by 2040, encouraging more countries to join this transformative infrastructure initiative.\n\nAdvertisement"
