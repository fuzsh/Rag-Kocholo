        "text": "Kader Khan was an illustrious figure in the Indian film industry, known for being as an actor, screenwriter, comedian, and director. Born on October 22, 1937, in Kabul, Afghanistan, he moved to Mumbai, India, during his early childhood. His humble beginnings saw him working as a professor of civil engineering at M.H. Saboo Siddik College of Engineering before fate led him to the world of cinema. Khan's cinematic journey commenced in 1971 with his debut in the film Daag, marking the beginning of a career that spanned over three decades. He demonstrated his versatility by effortlessly switching between roles, from villainous characters to comedic roles, earning him critical acclaim. His exceptional contribution to Indian cinema comprised over 300 films, with notable performances in Amar Akbar Anthony, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, and Coolie. Moreover, his talent was not confined to acting alone; he penned dialogues for more than 250 movies, showcasing his flair for writing. Despite his successful film career, Kader Khan didn't shy away from his commitment to education. He established an acting school named Kader Khan's Academy of Cinema in Dubai, aiming to nurture young talents. His dedication to both cinema and education contributed significantly to his legacy. Khan passed away on December 31, 2018, leaving behind a rich body of work that continues to inspire generations of actors and writers.\n\nSir Muhammad Iqbal (; Urdu: محمد اِقبال‎; 9 November 1877 – 21 April 1938), widely known as Allama Iqbal was a poet, philosopher and politician, as well as an academic, barrister and scholar in British India who is widely regarded as having inspired the Pakistan Movement. He is called the \"Spiritual Father of Pakistan.\" He is considered one of the most important figures in Urdu literature, with literary work in both Urdu and Persian.Iqbal is admired as a prominent poet by Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Iranians and other international scholars of literature. Though Iqbal is best known as an eminent poet, he is also a highly acclaimed \"Muslim philosophical thinker of modern times\". His first poetry book, The Secrets of the Self, appeared in the Persian language in 1915, and other books of poetry include The Secrets of Selflessness, Message from the East and Persian Psalms. Amongst these, his best known Urdu works are The Call of the Marching Bell, Gabriel's Wing, The Rod of Moses and a part of Gift from Hijaz. Along with his Urdu and Persian poetry, his Urdu and English lectures and letters have been very influential in cultural, social, religious and political discourses.In the`1922 New Years Honours he was made a Knight Bachelor by King George V, While studying law and philosophy in England, Iqbal became a member of the London branch of the All-India Muslim League. Later, during the League's December 1930 session, he delivered his most famous presidential speech known as the Allahabad Address in which he pushed for the creation of a Muslim state in north-west India.In much of South Asia and the Urdu-speaking world, Iqbal is regarded as the Shair-e-Mashriq (Urdu: شاعر مشرق‎, \"Poet of the East\"). He is also called Mufakkir-e-Pakistan (Urdu: مفکر پاکستان‎, \"The Thinker of Pakistan\"), Musawar-e-Pakistan (Urdu: مصور پاکستان‎, \"Artist of Pakistan\") and Hakeem-ul-Ummat (Urdu: حکیم الامت‎, \"The Sage of the Ummah\"). The Pakistan government officially named him \"National Poet of Pakistan\". His birthday Yōm-e Welādat-e Muḥammad Iqbāl (Urdu: یوم ولادت محمد اقبال‎), or Iqbal Day, is a public holiday in Pakistan.Iqbal's house is still located in Sialkot and is recognized as Iqbal's Manzil and is open for visitors. His other house where he lived most of his life and died is in Lahore, named as Javed Manzil. The museum is located on Allama Iqbal Road near Lahore Railway Station, Punjab, Pakistan. It was protected under the Punjab Antiquities Act of 1975, and declared a Pakistani national monument in 1977."
