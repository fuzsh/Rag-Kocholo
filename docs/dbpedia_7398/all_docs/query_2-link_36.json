        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nIn the domain of respiratory diseases, a wide array of conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and several viral infections, may all be included under one comprehensive term. These disorders are usually accompanied by symptoms such as coughing, runny nose, sneezing, trouble breathing, bronchitis, influenza, common cold, sinus infections, and other similar conditions (Guo et al., 2021). In recent decades, respiratory infections have become a major public health concern in many parts of the world. According to official statistics, the number of people dying from respiratory disorders increased by 18 % between 1990 and 2020, despite the percentage of mortality attributed to respiratory diseases did not increase compared to other diseases over the same period. (Baptista et al., 2021). The Asian continent was the site of the vast majority of these deaths. As a result of the urbanization of major cities on the Asian continent in recent decades, tobacco smoking, industrial air pollution, allergies of various kinds, as well as bacterial and viral diseases such as COVID 19 have been identified as the primary causes of these respiratory diseases on the continent (Tsang and File Jr 2008). The vast majority of respiratory infections that occur in countries located in and around the Middle East are attributable to environmental causes. The hot warmth and dust of the desert, as well as the very low temperatures of the winter, make the sensitive populations more susceptible to respiratory disease than other groups (Waness et al., 2011). Respiratory disorders are common in Saudi Arabia. According to studies from the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia, respiratory disorders were regarded as the fifth most prevalent cause of mortality. Some of the significant elements that have been identified in Saudi Arabia as potential triggering factors for these disorders are certain pollens found in the desert region, cigar-smoking, dust, gases, biomass fuel, and air pollution, among others. This statistic has also been boosted by a number of virus outbreaks, such as MERS, which have occurred recently (Al Ghobain et al., 2011).\n\nThere has been a significant increase in the number of individuals taking herbal medications during the last few decades, despite the fact that herbal treatments have been used in many parts of the world for thousands of years. The market for herbal remedies, which may either be obtained via a doctor's prescription or taken care of by the patient themselves, is growing at a rapid rate. Even though many contemporary therapeutic agents are now accessible in clinical practice, many individuals still believe in and use herbal remedies. Traditional techniques have gained popularity as a result of the fact that they are both cost-efficient and have been shown to be successful over the course of time. (Younis et al., 2018). Traditional methods make use of a variety of different materials, the most prominent of which being plants; nevertheless, a great many others are also used. According to the World Health Organization, plant-based preparations are used to provide primary health care to more than 80 % of the world's population. Furthermore, these traditional plants or their synthetic analogs are responsible for the production of more than 10 % of the commercially available contemporary medications (Bogusz et al., 2002). The safety of traditional herbal plants is a key obstacle to their acceptance; most of them have not yet been well examined, and the vast majority of them do not have literature accessible on them. Because of this, it is important to create a database of such plants for future scientific investigations in order to explain their application and promote the creation of contemporary pharmaceuticals (Parveen et al., 2015).\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is located in the far southwest corner of Asia, and it shares borders with many nations in the Middle East, as well as Yemen and the Red Sea ( ). More than 2200 different types of plants may be found there. Since ancient times, Saudi Arabia has been known for herbs in traditional medicine as a significant practice. This was many centuries before the advent of modern medicine. The use of prophetic medicine in the treatment considerably reinforces its applicability. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia is regarded as the origin of herbal medicine. Traditional healers in Saudi Arabia are referred to as Hakims, and they possess a plethora of indigenous knowledge on tribal and cultural medicine. They have herb collections that are geographically scattered around the nation. Saudi Arabia's terrain is varied, including mountains, forests, Greenland, and deserts. They all have various species, and some are only found in certain medicinally significant regions. Officially, these geographical locations are divided into provinces such as Al-Bahah, Al-Jawf, Asir province, Eastern province, Hail, Jizan, Madinah, Makkah, Najran, Qassim, Riyadh, and Tabuk. All of these provinces have their own particular plant species and customs. The majority of citizens of Saudi Arabia uses herbal drugs, which was very evident during the time of COVID-19 pandemic. AlNajrany et al., (2021) have found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Saudi population made extensive use of herbal supplements. Despite the fact that numerous plants have been used in traditional medicine to treat respiratory ailments, there is no complete report on the subject and only a handful have been studied in scientific investigations. As a result, the present study's goal is to collect data on the use of herbs for various respiratory illnesses in different Saudi Arabian areas using different sources.\n\n3. Plants used traditionally for respiratory diseases\n\n3.1. Acacia Arabica (Lam.) Willd\n\nAcacia Arabica is one of the genus acacia's 1350 species. It is classified within the Leguminosae family, which Linnaeus initially categorized and named in 1773. This plant is also known as Indian gum, babool, and mimosa. It is an evergreen tree with a short trunk often seen in black or brown shades. It is common in regions with very hot climates, deserts, and arid terrain, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula, India, Africa, and Sri Lanka (Amadou et al., 2020). The plant may grow in all parts of Saudi Arabia, particularly in wadi habitats (valleys) and rowdahs (gardens) on sandy and alluvial soils. Locally, it is referred to as ‘sant al arabi’ and is a vital component of traditional medicine. It is used to treat a variety of respiratory tract illnesses, including the common cold (Qari et al., 2021). Additionally, this plant has significant effects against bacterial, viral, fungal and malarial infections. In addition, they are an excellent agent for ulcer protection, diabetes mellitus and an anti-oxidant. This plant's gum is abundant in phenolics and tannins. The fruit has a high concentration of phenolic acids, including m-digallic acid and gallic acid (Roqaiya et al., 2015).\n\n3.2. Acalypha indica L\n\nAcalypha indica is an erect annual plant of the Acalypha genus, which grows to a maximum height of 1.2 m. This plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, and it's mostly found in Asia and Africa's wastelands and roadside. It grows mainly in Africa, such as Ethiopia and Somalia, and Asia, such as the Arabian Peninsula (Suresh et al., 2021). In Saudi Arabia, it is referred as “thafilan”, and it is used in conventional practice to cure bronchitis., pneumonia, and asthma (Yusuf and Wahab 1994). This plant has a significant history of use in traditional medicines all across the world, including as an anthelmintic, laxative, anti-epilepsy, headache treatment, anti-ulcer for bug bites, and wound healing. Analgesic, anthelmintic, anti-arthritis, anti-cancer, anti-fungal, antibacterial, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral properties have been shown in scientific investigations. Fats, vitamins, minerals, and a variety of secondary metabolites of therapeutic use abound in this plant. It contains phenolics such as geraniin and corilagin, according to studies. Ellagic acid, gallic acid, kaur-en-18-oic-acid, 16,17-dihyroxy-ent-kauran 19-oic-acid, and 4,4′,5,5′,6,6′ hexahydroxy diphenic acid are all prevalent anti-oxidant chemicals. The presence of a molecule called quebrachitol is thought to be responsible for this plant's anti-asthmatic properties (Zahidin et al., 2017).\n\n3.3. Aloe vera (L.) Burm. F\n\nAloe vera is one of the 400 species in the Aloe genus. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family. It is thought that it originated on the Arabian Peninsula, but it has since spread quite far and is now regarded as an invasive species over the globe. It gets more vigorous in difficult circumstances and on terrain similar to a desert. It's a 100-cm-tall stemless or extremely short-stemmed plant with no leaves. It's found all across Saudi Arabia, particularly in the Asir deserts (Ameen et al., 2021). It's known as ‘Sabar’ in the area. In the traditional medicinal practice of Saudi, it is used to treat asthma (Qadir 2009). The gel of this plant is used for a variety of cosmetic purposes in many traditional practices. It was also approved for the treatment of cough, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, immune system problems, and inflammatory disorders. According to studies, it possesses anti-cancer, wound healing, anti-ulcer, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetes, and anti-oxidant properties (Rajeswari et al., 2012). Aloe contains a lot of aloein, including nataloins like picric and oxalic acids, as well as a-barbaloins. Its antibacterial properties are due to the presence of lupeol and salicylic acid. Because of the inclusion of lupeol, it was an excellent analgesic (Maan et al., 2018).\n\n3.4. Alternanthera paronychioides A.St.-Hil\n\nAlternanthera paronychioides is a perennial plant with a prostrate stems that belonging to the Amaranthaceae family.

According to their traditional medicine, the leaves of this plant are used to treat bronchitis and asthma in Saudi Arabia (Saqib and Janbaz 2016). Other traditional practices have included the use of this plant as a carminative and treatment for dermatitis. This plant has a high concentration of flavonoids, which contributes to its anti-oxidant properties (Erlejman et al., 2004). The presence of flavonoids has been shown to inhibit the production of free radicals, particularly ROS. This plant is well-known for its ability to stimulate beta cells in the pancreas and to lower blood sugar levels, both of which are beneficial in diabetics. As a result, it is regarded to be protective against glucotoxicity (Wu et al., 2013, Sufian et al., 2017).\n\n3.5. Anastatica hierochuntica L\n\nAnastatica hierochuntica L. is a tiny, grey-green winter annual plant of the Brassicaceae family. They grow to a maximum of 15 cm tall and have a distinctive white flower. Linnaei was the first to describe this plant in 1753 (Eshel et al., 2017). It is mostly found in the Arabian Peninsula, including the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. It is called as 'Kaff' in Saudi Arabia, then in traditional medical practice, the plant itself is utilized to treat a variety of respiratory conditions. (Ihsanullah, 2012, Alqethami et al., 2020). The majority of Arabs consume this plant's leaves in the form of a tea beverage. In addition, the plant has been used to treat depression, hypertension, fever, malaria, epilepsy, hyperglycemia, as a cardiac medication, and in the treatment of infertility. Anti-oxidant, antibacterial, anti-fungal, hypolipidaemic, anti-inflammatory, hepatic protective and immunomodulation characteristics have been discovered in this plant. Minerals such as manganese, magnesium, calcium, and iron are abundant in the plant. Flavonoids, lignans, flavones, phenolic acids, flavanols, and other secondary metabolites are found in them.
