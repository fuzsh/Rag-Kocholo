        "text": "In the nineteenth century, Muslim modernist reformers sought to ground an agenda for social and political rejuvenation in a return to the spirit of the early Muslim community. However, the influence of this quest for communal regeneration on theological discourses was, in some cases, less notable than its influence upon projects for cultural and social reform. One area of focus for Indian modernists of the nineteenth century was literature and the literary arts, including poetry, which were now deemed relevant to notions of cultural health, authenticity and decline. Under the dictum that a people's condition is reflected in their language, the themes of moral degeneration and reform came to have a strong bearing on the indigenous valuation of poetry and the literary arts, challenging the criteria upon which such literature was judged. In this paper, I will analyse how the modernist agenda for social reform led to the birth of a new literary romanticism in Urdu poetry.\n\nThis paper will look into the possibilities of defying the apparent dichotomy, of primeval and modern, in the title itself. India and Pakistan have a common history, being part of the same chunk of land until their Partition. Sufism has a significant role to play in the shared heritage of this land. The nature of their culture today, a liberal, multicultural outlook, owes a lot to Sufistic thought. As history tells us, the initiates were possibly academicians, a part of the troop of invaders from Central Asia. Sufism ran parallel to institutions like administration and various religious factions. It led to an amalgamation and accommodation of people across sections into the larger fabric of society. This paper intends to treat Sufism more as the humane dimension of a composite religion along with the mystical. It came forward as a refuge to the underprivileged and the deprived, and as a tool for asserting equity and resistance, in a divided brahmanical society. Modernism as a movement in literature is also a response to the human propensity for bestiality and subjection of others. Both stand against the divisive strain in society and towards a greater achievement. An analysis tracing sufistic thought as showcased in the poems of Ibn-e-Insha will be done for reading the elements of divinity, equanimity and anti-establishment, along with other sufistic tenets. Key words: Sufism, Modern Urdu poetry, Ibn-e-Insha, composite culture\n\nUrdu literature in general and Urdu poetry in particular, always played its part in generating, shaping and mobilizing Indian public opinion, and defeated thereof all odds of time and space through India's progressive journey. Accordingly, Urdu literature resisted the British imperialism from its very beginning. However, during the first half of 20 th century, when British employed in full swing all political, military, ideological and Machiavellian tools to maintain their imperial permanence in India, thereby dividing Indians on different grounds, Urdu poetry performed well its moral responsibility of generating and mobilizing united public opinion against British rule. Urdu poets fought British Raj by inculcating among Indians spirit of harmony, unity, patriotism, and sacrifice. Urdu poetry, besides giving a vide space to all forms of anti-British resistance going on in India and abroad, also quickened the pace of freedom movement by mobilizing the public opinion against British Raj. This piece of research therefore, explores the dominant nationalistic trends in Urdu poetry during first half of 20 th century.\n\nUrdu literature in general and Urdu poetry in particular, always played its part in generating, shaping and mobilizing the Indian public opinion and defeated thereof all the odds of time and space during India's progressive journey.
