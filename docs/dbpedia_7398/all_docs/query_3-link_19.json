        "text": "To Margaret, the Librarian\n\nIt was a librarian\n\nwho first showed me\n\nhow to properly\n\nopen a book.\n\nThe rest\n\nis all my fault.\n\n– Sam Hamill\n\nHere’s to mountain-and-forest feelings flourishing…\n\n“On Returning to My Mountains,\n\nfor the Ch’an Abbot Clarity-Deep”\n\nI heard the unborn inner pattern young\n\nbut we rarely follow mind’s deep impulse: this life’s rugged path is often full of dust.\n\nNow, back to old canyons in my twilight, I find myself a neighbor to Clarity-Deep.\n\nAmid forests, rejoicing in kindred spirits, we sit perfecting the mat’s jewel together, contemplate this drift on seas of suffering, teachings lost in a surging swelling world.\n\nUsing dharma’s subtle mystery, you guide us into that crystalline purity of origins, where karma’s travail ends in tranquility, mountain-and-forest feelings flourishing.\n\nI come at dawn asking after some answer, and by dusk our talk touches clarity whole, like your dark brush exhausting ancient truths, its words startling human realms.\n\n– from The Mountain Poems of Meng Hao-jan,\n\ntranslated by David Hinton, Archipelago Books\n\nExperience\n\nStop.\n\nGo out.\n\nBe the explorer of nights;\n\nthe inspector of storms;\n\nthe witness of the dawn.\n\nYou’re breathing\n\nbut how much of this life\n\nhave you actually seen?\n\n– L.M. Browning\n\nWords cannot begin to describe the beauty, richness, healing power, joy and nourishment of – say, for example, a cloudy morning, the wind, a friendship, kind parents, great teachers, the existence of music or the shades of color we call green.\n\n– Jason Espada\n\nIt was like getting a love letter from a tree\n\nEyes closed forever to find you—\n\nThere is a life which\n\nif I could have it\n\nI would have chosen for myself from the beginning\n\n– Franz Wright – The Poem\n\nYes, my Other, this is how\n\nI always recognize you\n\nupward-reaching and glad\n\nwithin wing’s wind of a Great Song.\n\nThere is speech that, burnished,\n\naspires to poetry which,\n\nif lyric and true, longs to\n\ndissolve in wordlessness, since\n\nSilence is the Voice of G_d.\n\n– Yahia Lababidi\n\nLove: the skillful audacity required to share an inner life.\n\n– Gertrude Stein\n\nThe writer is by nature a dreamer—a conscious dreamer.\n\n– Carson McCullers\n\nMagic\n\nTake a pen, and decide it is a magical pen. Take paper, and decide it is magical paper. Take some time, and decide it is a magical time. Find a nice place, and decide it is a magical place. Now write down the most glorious, magical, beautiful, pure, powerful, creative, inspiring and Divine intention for your life and for your world. Let every word be clear and positive and dripping with the nectar of love and what feels true to you. And once you feel complete then put the pen down and relish the magical feeling as though this has already happened for you and enter a state of deep and perfect fulfillment and gratitude. Finally surrender this vision to the highest, the essence, to the creative source of everything, and relax, release, let go. Put this paper away in a safe place with love. Nothing more needs to be done. Life takes care of the rest. You will be amazed by what happens next, by how your life will be guided. Enjoy every step of the journey now.\n\n– Nithya Shanti\n\nThe greatest gift of life on the mountain is time. Time to think or not think, read or not read, scribble or not scribble – to sleep and cook and walk in the woods, to sit and stare at the shapes of the hills. I produce nothing but words; I consumer nothing but food, a little propane, a little firewood. By being utterly useless in the calculations of the culture at large I become useful, at last, to myself.\n\n– Philip Connors\n\nMay I not squander the astonishments.\n\n– Jorie Graham\n\nGetting started, keeping going, getting started again — in art and in life, it seems to me this is the essential rhythm not only of achievement but of survival.\n\n– Seamus Heaney\n\nAn endless stream flows out of mind\n\nwhichever way is down never up\n\nwhere it rests and moves doesn’t matter\n\nreaching the sea it all becomes waves\n\n– Stonehouse\n\nField Guide\n\nby Tony Hoagland\n\nOnce, in the cool blue middle of a lake,\n\nup to my neck in that most precious element of all,\n\nI found a pale-gray, curled-upwards pigeon feather\n\nfloating on the tension of the water\n\nat the very instant when a dragonfly,\n\nlike a blue-green iridescent bobby pin,\n\nhovered over it, then lit, and rested.\n\nThat’s all.\n\nI mention this in the same way\n\nthat I fold the corner of a page\n\nin certain library books,\n\nso that the next reader will know\n\nwhere to look for the good parts.\n\nThe object we call a book is not the real book, but its potential, like a musical score or seed. It exists fully only in the act of being read; and its real home is inside the head of the reader, where the symphony resounds, the seed germinates. A book is a heart that only beats in the chest of another.\n\n– Rebecca Solnit\n\nAt some point in life the world’s beauty becomes enough. You don’t need to photograph, paint, or even remember it. It is enough.\n\n– Toni Morrison\n\nFor this feeling of wonder shows that you are a philosopher, since wonder is the only beginning of philosophy.\n\n– Plato, Theaetetus\n\nI would now rouse women’s essence, spirit, to rise as birds in flight over fields, leaving swiftly earth’s dust, that they may speedily cross the frontier into the great world of light and brilliance. I desire that they be leaders, awakened lions, advance messengers of learning and intelligence; that they may serve as rafts crossing cloudy ferries; as lamps in dark chambers.\n\n– Qiu Jin\n\nPoet, revolutionary, feminist and writer\n\n1875-1907\n\nAny time you find somebody today who’s afraid of the word ‘revolution,’ get him out of your way.\n\n– Malcolm X\n\nIf your goals aren’t synced with the substance of your heart, then achieving them won’t matter much.\n\n– Danielle LaPorte\n\nThe nature of our society is such that we are prevented from knowing who we are.\n\n– Ralph Ellison\n\nFind a subject you care about and which you in your heart feel others should care about. It is this genuine caring, and not your games with language, which will be the most compelling and seductive element in your style.\n\n– Kurt Vonnegut\n\nPeople are just wonderful as sunsets if I can let them be. In fact, perhaps the reason we can truly appreciate a sunset is that we cannot control it. When I look at a sunset as I did the other evening, I don’t find myself saying, “Soften the orange a little on the right hand corner, and put a bit more purple along the base, and use a little more pink in the cloud color.” I don’t do that. I don’t try to control a sunset. I watch with awe as it unfolds\n\n– Carl Rogers\n\nPoetry is essentially the discovery, the love, the passion for the name of everything.\n\n– Gertrude Stein\n\nPoetry is a life-cherishing force. For poems are not words, after all, but fires for the cold, ropes let down to the lost, something as necessary as bread in the pockets of the hungry.\n\n– Mary Oliver\n\nEven if you can’t sing well, sing. Sing to yourself. Sing in the privacy of your home. But sing.\n\n– Rebbe Nachman of Breslov\n\nRemind us again, / brave friend. / What countries may we / sing into? / What lines should we all / be crossing?\n\nWhat lines might we dare to cross, and what songs might we hear, that can deepen our days?\n\n– Paul Robeson\n\nThe human heart\n\nis a labyrinth.\n\nOne more reason\n\nto explore it.\n\n– Gregory Orr\n\nThe possible’s slow fuse is lit by the Imagination.\n\n– Emily Dickinson\n\nAh, to be one of them! One of the poets whose song helps close the wound rather than open it!\n\n– Juan Ramón Jiménez\n\nElizabeth Mattis Namgyel ~ When the world is an open inquiry it’s not samsara anymore\n\nOur journey is about being more deeply involved in life and yet less attached to it.\n\n– Ram Das\n\nElizabeth Mattis Namgyel ~ When, like the Buddha, we begin to question that things may not be as they seem, we join a lineage of people–a culture of truth–who aspire to transcend a limited view of reality.\n\nI bow to the sky,\n\nseamless and blue,\n\nthe mystical sunlight\n\nfiltering through\n\nmy church in the pines\n\nhere by this creek\n\nwith rocks that can sing\n\nand devas that speak\n\na secret language beyond sound\n\nin praise of hallowed ground.\n\n– Kirtana\n\nMy song will sit in the pupils of your eyes,\n\nand will carry your sight into the heart of things.\n\nAnd when my voice is silenced in death,\n\nmy song will speak in your living heart.\n\n– Tagore\n\nGod’s gifts put man’s best dreams to shame.\n\n– Elizabeth Barrett Browning\n\nyour love\n\n.\n\nit is you who imbues\n\nthis morning with meaning –\n\nyour light allows me\n\nto see with new eyes –\n\nyour love has infused\n\nevery mote of my being,\n\nand given me back the sky —\n\n.\n\n– E.M.\n\nMy debt to you, Beloved,\n\nIs one I cannot pay\n\nIn any coin of any realm\n\nOn any reckoning day.\n\n– Jessie B. Rittenhouse\n\nLearn silence. At least with your friends, with your lovers, with your family, with your fellow travelers here, sit in silence sometimes.\n\nDon’t go on gossiping, don’t go on talking. Stop talking, and not only on the outside – stop the inner talk. Be in an interval.\n\nJust sit, doing nothing, just being present to each other. And soon you will start finding a new way to communicate. And that is the right way.\n\nStart communicating through silence sometimes. Holding the hand of your friend, sit silently. Just looking at the moon, feel the moon, and both feel it silently. And see, a communion happens – not only communication, but a communion.\n\nYour hearts start beating in the same rhythm. You start feeling the same space. You start feeling the same joy. You start overlapping each other’s being.\n\nThat is communion. You have said without saying anything, and there is no misunderstanding.\n\n– Osho\n\nWhen I look at my life and its secret colors, I feel like bursting into tears.\n\n– Albert Camus\n\nHe loved her, of course, but better than that, he chose her, day after day. Choice: that was the thing.\n\n– Sherman Alexie, The Toughest Indian in the World\n\nAmidst the great disturbances affecting both nature and culture turning inward, is necessary to balance and retune to our own souls. When we tune back in to the song of the soul we become more able to contribute to the healing of the world. As the poet Rumi reminds us, we don’t have to save the world; what we must do is tune to our souls, become our own unique note and join the great song of creation ongoing.\n\n– Michael Meade\n\nIf we would have new knowledge, we must get us a whole world of new questions.\n\n– Susanne Langer\n\nAs true of people as it is of life’s graces:\n\n“Step back, that you may be approached.”\n\n– St Augustine\n\nWe spend most of our time and energy in a kind of horizontal thinking. We move along the surface of things going from one quick base to another, often with a frenzy that wears us out. We collect data, things, people, ideas, “profound experiences,” never penetrating any of them…But there are other times. There are times when we stop. We sit still. We lose ourselves in a pile of leaves or its memory. We listen and breezes from a whole other world begin to whisper.’\n\n– James Carroll\n\nTo confront a person with his own shadow is to show him his own light.\n\n– Carl Jung\n\nClose your eyes and imagine the best version of you possible. That’s who you really are, let go of any part of you that doesn’t believe it.\n\n– C. Assaad\n\nMay all beings everywhere\n\nPlagued by sufferings of body and mind\n\nObtain an ocean of happiness and joy\n\nBy virtue of my merits.\n\nMay no living creature suffer,\n\nCommit evil, or ever fall ill.\n\nMay no one be afraid or belittled,\n\nWith a mind weighed down by depression.\n\nMay the blind see forms\n\nAnd the deaf hear sounds,\n\nMay those whose bodies are worn with toil\n\nBe restored on finding repose.\n\nMay the naked find clothing,\n\nThe hungry find food;\n\nMay the thirsty find water\n\nAnd delicious drinks.\n\nMay the poor find wealth,\n\nThose weak with sorrow find joy;\n\nMay the forlorn find hope,\n\nConstant happiness, and prosperity.\n\nMay there be timely rains\n\nAnd bountiful harvests;\n\nMay all medicines be effective\n\nAnd wholesome prayers bear fruit.\n\nMay all who are sick and ill\n\nQuickly be freed from their ailments.\n\nWhatever diseases there are in the world,\n\nMay they never occur again.\n\nMay the frightened cease to be afraid\n\nAnd those bound be freed;\n\nMay the powerless find power,\n\nAnd may people think of benefiting each other.\n\nFor as long as space remains,\n\nFor as long as sentient beings remain,\n\nUntil then may I too remain\n\nTo dispel the miseries of the world.\n\n– Dalai Lama\n\nHippies are like ferrets— they sound cool in theory, but they’re a pain in the ass to live with. My opinion of hippies has been forever tainted by several months in my early twenties of listening to bizarre spiritual ego battles and house-wide feuds over which specific kinds of organic vegan foods are permitted in the cooking area, while nobody in our share house was actually buying groceries except me. Like all movements, the original kernel of truth in the zeitgeist of the sixties has gotten lost in the shuffle of time, and now it’s essentially just an identity people pin on themselves when they like pot and spiritual escapism.\n\nThat said, the aforementioned kernel of truth was very much a real thing. Something very real happened in the organic arising of the hippie movement, and they were very right about some things. That’s what I’d like to talk about here with you today, dear reader. I’d like to take a brief pause from making fun of the Washington Post and talking about what a ridiculous turd waffle Wolf Blitzer is and give myself permission here to kind of zoom out and talk about what all these political fireworks look like from a bigger-picture perspective as I see them.\n\nSo here’s the thing, if you’re still with me: those goofy hippies were right. There is indeed a great awakening in the mail. It’s taken a bit longer than they thought it would take, and it sure as hell doesn’t look anything like what they thought it’d look like, but it’s coming, and, unlike the initial spark of truth which appeared in their movement, this one can’t be shut down. No amount of cultural backlash or Nixonian drug wars or Reaganite yuppyism is going to get this cat back in the bag, because its carrying agent is so radically decentralized. The great awakening is not coming by means of psychedelic drugs as so many early hippies foretold, nor by communism, nor by the spread of eastern philosophy and Transcendental Meditation. It’s coming through the internet.\n\n– Tim Foley\n\nLast year ,I was foolish monk.This year ,no change.\n\n– Ryokan\n\nwhen the torah speaks of loving god “with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your will”, it is saying that true love is a deed of the whole-being. the love we feel inside is the love we do outside. the love of the whole-being is always a radical call. it transforms a human being into an “instrument” for deeds of peace and compassion. what else should we wish for the new year other than to be blessed with even a measure of such wonderful a transformation? yes, we will be betrayed. and yes, not always we will be reciprocated for our work of gifting creation and healing. but challenges we face, are also opportunities to practice equanimity and compassion. in a sense, what else should anyone wish for the new year but to be grateful for the goodness received and the goodness given. and, yes, should that be the case, may we also have the strength to practice compassion in the face of hurts and disappointments. may we always learn to forgive, it is important. and as the poet martin buber said, we must always choose to love powerfully! may this be my wish for a happy new year to all.\n\n– hune margulies\n\nAnd sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to describe them in.\n\n– Jane Austen\n\nI saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more.\n\n– Angelita Lim\n\nI love you the more in that I believe you had liked me for my own sake and for nothing else.\n\n– John Keats\n\ni love you so dearly, dear\n\nforgetful one.\n\ncome and walk in the dusk\n\nthere is no wind anymore\n\nthe world ended yesterday.\n\n– Belle Heywood\n\nBecause of you I’m talking to crickets, clouds,\n\nconfiding in a cat. Everyone says,\n\nCome to your senses, and I do, of you.\n\nEvery touch electric, every taste you,\n\nevery smell, even burning sugar, every\n\ncry and laugh. Toothpicked samples\n\nat the farmer’s market, every melon,\n\nplum, I come undone, undone.”\n\n– Dean Young\n\nLiterature adds to reality, it does not simply describe it. It enriches the necessary competencies that daily life requires and provides; and in this respect, it irrigates the deserts that our lives have already become.\n\n– C.S. Lewis\n\nWhat’s happening to music?\n\nThere is a lot to this question. Every time I try to look at it I see so many different points of view at the same time. The idea that musicians should be able to copy a product and sell each copy for a hefty price is a relatively recent one. It didn’t exist for Mozart and it may well not exist again soon. Despite how it may affect me and a lot of people I know and love it may actually be for the best. The people who benefit most from this system are not the people who can go out in front of an audience with their instrument and entertain them for a couple of hours.\n\nMusic is everywhere. Lifts, shops, hotel lobbies, everywhere. You see people walking in the country with headphones on. In rural Ireland 100 years ago hearing music was a rare treat. Music is being devalued at a rate of knots. The best sax player on the planet could busk in Cork city and lots of people would walk by without a glance unless they were told who he was and why they should listen. You can hear and see the best musicians in the world everyday for free on YouTube. You could sit in a pub in the evening while the barman turns off the Eagles ‘Hotel California’ on the sound system so a guy with a guitar and a backing track can sing a far inferior version of the same song. A decision has been made that this may get more people into the bar. That’s all that’s at stake. The connection between money and music is working much better for money than it is for music. There are thousands even millions of people who don’t play music, but work hard everyday to make as much profit as possible from it.\n\nMusic is a bangle for your wrist, a fashion accessory, a way to join a club, a badge.\n\nBut music as life changing, reach into your gut, give you hope, love, life, joy, that’s what shapes my world. Music as beauty, music as truth.\n\nI started to answer a blog and ended up here, going in all directions.\n\n– Declan Sinnott\n\ni clipped and put together a few lines from a meditation by the great brazilian poet vinicius de moraes.\n\nyou don’t have to be a man, it’s enough to be human, it’s enough to have sentiment, it’s enough to have heart. you have to know how to speak or be quiet, more than anything you have to know how to listen. you have to like poetry, dawn, a bird, the sun, the moon, the song of the winds and the music of the breeze. you must have love, a great love for somebody, or feel the void of not having that love. you must… respect the pain the passer-by carries with him… you don’t have to be pure, nor totally impure, but you shouldn’t be vulgar. you should have an ideal and fear of losing it and, in case you are not like that, you should feel the great vacuum which that leaves…your principal objective should be to be a friend. you should feel pity for sad persons and comprehend the immense emptiness of the lonely… look for a friend…who is moved when called a friend. who knows how to converse about simple things, the dew, the great rains…you need a friend so as not to go mad…you should like deserted streets, puddles of water and wet roads, the edge of the street, the countryside after the rain, to lie down in the grass. one needs a friend who says it’s good to live, not because life is beautiful but because he has a friend…one needs a friend to stop crying…in order not to live leaning on the past in search of lost memories. who slaps us on the shoulder smiling or crying, but who calls us friend in order to know that we are still living.\n\n– Hune Margulies\n\nMy Kingdom is spread all over the earth, and you do not see it.\n\n– Jesus the Nazarene\n\nThe difference in a teacher and a mentor is that a mentor is interested in our soul.\n\n– Robert A. Johnson\n\nThe object of life is not happiness, but to serve God or the Grail. All of the Grail quests are to serve God. If one understands this and drops his idiotic notion that the meaning of life is personal happiness, then one will find that elusive quality immediately at hand.\n\n– Robert A. Johnson\n\nThe real relatedness between two people is experienced in the small tasks they do together: the quiet conversation when the day’s upheavels are at rest, the soft word of understanding, the daily companionship, the encouragement offered in a difficult moment, the small gift when least expected, the spontaneous gesture of love.\n\n– Robert A. Johnson\n\nTo suffer one’s confusion is the first step in healing.\n\n– Robert A. Johnson\n\nThe only hope for healing is to offer a better form of ecstasy, to upgrade so the addict will give up the stupid one.\n\n– Robert A. Johnson\n\nSomeone observed darkly that it is always two A.M. when one is in the ‘dark night of the soul.\n\n– Robert A. Johnson\n\nThe question isn’t what will happen. It’s what we will make happen.\n\n– Rebecca Solnit, December 2016\n\nI thought poetry could change everything, could change history and could humanize, and I think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe. But now I think that poetry changes only the poet.\n\n– Mahmoud Darwish\n\nNot Anyone Who Says\n\nNot anyone who says, “I’m going to be\n\ncareful and smart in matters of love,”\n\nwho says, “I’m going to choose slowly,”\n\nbut only those lovers who didn’t choose at all\n\nbut were, as it were, chosen\n\nby something invisible and powerful and uncontrollable\n\nand beautiful and possibly even\n\nunsuitable —\n\nonly those know what I’m talking about\n\nin this talking about love.\n\n– Mary Oliver\n\nBe a good steward of your gifts. Protect your time. Feed your inner life. Avoid too much noise. Read good books, have good sentences in your ears. Be by yourself as often as you can. Walk. Take the phone off the hook. Work regular hours.\n\n– Jane Kenyon\n\nLove yourself first and everything else falls into line. You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world.\n\n– Lucille Ball\n\n…Spare me from bitterness\n\nand from the sharp passions of\n\nunguarded moments. May\n\nI not forget that poverty and\n\nriches are of the spirit.\n\nThough the world knows me not,\n\nmay my thoughts and actions\n\nbe such as shall keep me friendly\n\nwith myself.\n\nLift up my eyes\n\nfrom the earth, and let me not\n\nforget the uses of the stars.\n\nForbid that I should judge others\n\nlest I condemn myself.\n\nLet me not follow the clamor of\n\nthe world, but walk calmly\n\nin my path.\n\nGive me a few friends\n\nwho will love me for what\n\nI am; and keep ever burning\n\nbefore my vagrant steps\n\nthe kindly light of hope.\n\nAnd though age and infirmity\n\novertake me, and I come not within\n\nsight of the castle of my dreams,\n\nteach me still to be thankful\n\nfor life, and for time’s olden\n\nmemories that are good and\n\nsweet; and may the evening’s\n\ntwilight find me gentle still.\n\n– Max Ehrmann\n\n…I miss the old temples where you could hang out with God.\n\nStill, we have pet pounds where you can feel love draped in warm fur,\n\nAnd sense the whole tragedy of life and death.\n\nYou see there the consequences of carelessness,\n\nAnd you feel there the yapping urgency of life that wants to be lived.\n\nThe only things lacking are the frankincense and myrrh.\n\nWe don’t build many temples anymore.\n\nMaybe we learned that the sacred can’t be contained.\n\nOr maybe it can’t be sustained inside a building.\n\nBuildings crumble.\n\nIt’s the spirit that lives on.\n\nIf you had a temple in the secret spaces of your heart,\n\nWhat would you worship there?\n\nWhat would you bring to sacrifice?\n\nWhat would be behind the curtain in the holy of holies?\n\nGo there now.\n\n– Tom Barrett\n\nPhilippians 2:4\n\nLet each of you look not to your own interests,\n\nBut to the interests of others.\n\nThis river is a mighty one;\n\nI have to trust its flow\n\nBut if you asked me where it’s taking us,\n\nI wouldn’t say I know.\n\nBut I will go there willingly;\n\nshe’s never led me astray.\n\nAnd I’ve only be bruised\n\nwhen I’ve refused to get out of my way.\n\nSo, I wouldn’t stop the rain.\n\nNo, I wouldn’t stop the rain.\n\nWhat good would it do?\n\nAnd I wouldn’t trade the pain,\n\nor mess with the math that created the path\n\nthat eventually led to you , my love.\n\nI give you my love.\n\nAnd when I say love\n\nI mean a love that will stay love\n\nthrough every change that could betray love\n\nand the vicissitudes of time.\n\nI mean mature love,\n\nunconditional and pure love.\n\nThe kind of love I feel with your love,\n\nI want you to feel with mine.\n\n– Kirtana\n\nWe are happy when for everything inside us there is a corresponding something outside us.\n\n– W.B. Yeats\n\nThe mind deals with optimism in an analytic way; it analyzes the data and then decides “I’m optimistic or pessimistic.” The imagination, on the other hand, considers all the data and reinvests itself again in hope. The imagination believes in its own power to see what it’s never seen before. It’s not constrained by analysis.\n\n– Barry Lopez\n\nI took refuge in Buddha,\n\nAnd I found a teacher\n\nWho discovered a way to end suffering;\n\nI took refuge in Dharma,…\n\nAnd I found teachings and practices\n\nThat lead to suffering’s end;\n\nI took refuge in Sangha,\n\nAnd I found a community\n\nThat works together to end suffering.\n\nThen I started giving away what I had taken…\n\nAnd I found an end to suffering.\n\n– Fa Hsing Jeff Miles\n\nA miraculous healing awaits this planet once we accept our new responsibility to collectively tend the Garden rather than fight over the turf.\n\n– Bruce H.

What job.\n\nWhat tidy bit of formal activity.\n\nI float into all the windows,\n\nfollow all cars home and inhabit\n\nthe secrets my neighborhood carries\n\nWhen you’re unemployed in a plaza,\n\nyou have entrée to the multiple affairs,\n\nthe entreaties, the escapes, the wrapping-up,\n\nthe years-later. I used to sit at a counter\n\nand dust the classifieds with my toast crumbs\n\ndrawing circles like one deciphering glyphs\n\nby lantern in a tomb, and walk away cursed.\n\nUnder the weight of their credentials\n\nmy leg broke in five places. Over here,\n\ntheir statue of the Buddha, over there,\n\nthe open letter, and probably nuclear\n\nsubmarines glide under the sunset,\n\none might guess from the short life span\n\nglowing around each of us. Meanwhile\n\na stranger plays the gold piano she wheeled\n\nunder the lindens. Gold is its own concordance.\n\nI play the most delicate balalaika, and bike\n\nall night with a samovar balanced on my handlebars.\n\nI think I remember work, stifled yawns,\n\nhow a rivet pulls the metal sheets together\n\nlike near-strangers clutching at last call.\n\nMy advice is to be survived by a hymn.\n\nPut allegories in charge and wait for loss.\n\nPeople have always been good at imagining the end of the world, which is much easier to picture than the strange sidelong paths of change in a world without end.\n\n– Rebecca Solnit, Hope in the Dark\n\nIt’s discouraging to think how many people are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit.\n\n– Noël Coward, Blithe Spirit\n\nWe have stopped for a moment to encounter each other, to meet, to love, to share. This is a precious moment, but it is transient. It is a little parenthesis in eternity. If we share with caring, lightheartedness, and love, we will create abundance and joy for each other. And then this moment will have been worthwhile.\n\n– Deepak Chopra\n\nLet us take the temple of illusions down. When imperial power becomes the ultimate caricature dressed in her finery—when the foundations of the house are rotten—what else is there to do? The the robot queen of Babylon has to be dismantled—imaginatively. Not though blind and violent revolution but through inner conversion.\n\n– Andrew Sweeny\n\nI have frequently seen people become neurotic when they content themselves with inadequate or wrong answers to the questions of life. They seek position, marriage, reputation, outward success of money, and remain unhappy and neurotic even when they have attained what they were seeking. Such people are usually confined within too narrow a spiritual horizon. Their life has not sufficient content, sufficient meaning. If they are enabled to develop into more spacious personalities, the neurosis generally disappears.\n\n– C. G. Jung\n\nThe likelihood that your acts of resistance cannot stop the injustice does not exempt you from acting in what you sincerely and reflectively hold to be the best interests of your community.\n\n– Susan Sontag\n\nBut hope is not about what we expect. It is an embrace of the essential unknowability of the world, of the breaks with the present, the surprises. Or perhaps studying the record more carefully leads us to expect miracles – not when and where we expect them, but to expect to be astonished, to expect that we don’t know. And this is grounds to act.\n\n– Rebecca Solnit, Hope in the Dark\n\nDzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche ~ Through simmering in the raw discomfort of our tendencies, we can gain victory over our aggression and experience the confidence and well-being that come from patience.\n\nFor many of us, the moment when we experienced something we could not share with our outer world, because our outer world had given us no “word” to acknowledge it, was the moment that impelled us toward poetry. And poetry was a struggle with the given language, to make it give us better words than ‘unlikely’ for what had fallen out of this world’s likelihood.\n\n– Alan Williamson\n\nA PATH IN THE WOODS FROM A NEW NAME\n\nI don’t trust the truth of memories\n\nbecause what leaves us\n\ndeparts forever\n\nThere’s only one current of this sacred river\n\nbut I still want to remain faithful\n\nto my first astonishments\n\nto recognize as wisdom the child’s wonder\n\nand to carry in myself until the end a path\n\nin the woods of my childhood\n\ndappled with patches of sunlight\n\nto search for it everywhere\n\nin museums in the shade of churches\n\nthis path on which I ran unaware\n\na six-year old\n\ntoward my primary mysterious aloneness\n\n– Anna Kamieńska\n\nUnder adversity, under oppression, the words begin to fail. The easy words begin to fail. In order to convey things accurately, the human being is almost forced to find the most precise words possible, which is a precondition for literature.\n\n– Rita Dove\n\nSuicide is, after all, the opposite of the poem.\n\n– Anne Sexton\n\nI think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits, unless I spend four hours a day at least—and it is commonly more than that—sauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields, absolutely free from all worldly engagements.\n\n– Henry David Thoreau\n\nAs the fabric of life loosens and the veil between this world and the otherworld becomes thinner and more permeable, we can begin again to align ourselves with the luminous ground of imagination, the inherited territory of the human heart and soul. Our minds can learn again to serve the deepest longing of our hearts and draw upon the wisdom hidden in our souls. Just as time seems to be running out on everyone, the eternal tries to slip back into human awareness. Things become both impossible and more possible at the same time. Amidst the theories about how it all might come to an end, the unseen thread of the eternal can be found again. For, we are all held by the threads of dreams and secretly tied to the cosmos. If we allow it, we are pushed by the inspirations of genius and pulled on by the stars.\n\nThe answers to the overwhelming problems and daunting global issues we all face cannot simply come from the limited consciousness of abstract reasoning and scientific attitudes that currently dominate the world. The problems run deeper than the simple facts of the matter; the answers must be found in deeper places as well. There is an increasing need for psychic balance, for both deeper intelligence and greater imagination that might reveal more of the ways we are each woven to the earthly realm and connected at the same time to the stars. Both at the quantum level and the mythic levels of understanding, we all remain connected to the dream of the cosmos and the wonder of the world.\n\n– Michael Meade, from The Genius Myth\n\nThe long silences need to be loved, perhaps\n\nmore than the words\n\nwhich arrive\n\nto describe them\n\nin time.\n\n– Franz Wright\n\nRumi’s wise answers to questions put to him…\n\nWhat is poison?\n\nAnything which is more than our necessity is poison. It may be power, wealth, hunger, ego, greed, laziness, love, ambition, or anything.\n\nWhat is fear?\n\nNon-acceptance of uncertainty. If we accept the uncertainty, it becomes an adventure!\n\nWhat is envy?\n\nNon-acceptance of the goodness in others. If we accept the goodness, it becomes inspiration!\n\nWhat is anger?\n\nNon-acceptance of the things which are beyond our control. If we accept, it becomes tolerance!\n\nWhat is hatred?\n\nNon-acceptance of others as they are. If we accept them unconditionally, it becomes love!\n\nYoga is like music: the rhythm of the body, the melody of the mind, and the harmony of the soul create the symphony of life.\n\n– BKS Iyengar\n\nOnly to the extent that we expose ourselves over and over to annihilation can that which is indestructible in us be found.\n\n– Pema Chodron\n\nThe supreme blasphemy is the denial of the indestructible essence within us.\n\n– Schopenhauer\n\nEssences are not capable of annihilation. Attributes, however, can be annihilated… When the Divine will in regard to a man becomes subsistent, his will is annihilated and his personal initiative disappears.\n\n– Al Hujwiri, Sufi\n\n…What locks itself in sameness has congealed.\n\nIs it safer to be gray and numb?\n\nWhat turns hard becomes rigid\n\nand is easily shattered.\n\nPour yourself out like a fountain.\n\nFlow into the knowledge that what you are seeking\n\nfinishes often at the start, and, with ending, begins.\n\nEvery happiness is the child of a separation\n\nit did not think it could survive. And Daphne, becoming\n\na laurel,\n\ndares you to become the wind.\n\n– Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nThe most important thing in all human relationships is conversation, but people don’t talk anymore, they don’t sit down to talk and listen.\n\nThey go to the cinema, watch television, listen to the radio, read books, update their status on internet, but they almost never talk.\n\nIf we want to change the world, we have to go back to a time when warriors would gather around a fire and tell stories.\n\n– Paulo Coelho\n\nFaith is based on genuineness, trusting in yourself and your vision. You are not faking anything, and you are not trying to impress anybody. Faith inspires discipline, which is not based on punishment or arbitrary rules and authority, but rather on becoming thoroughly gentle and genuine. Discipline guides you and shows you how to live in the warrior’s world. With this unwavering discipline, the warrior takes joy in the journey and joy in working with others. This joy is like music, which celebrates its own rhythm and melody. The celebration is continuous, in spite of the ups and downs of life.\n\n– Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche\n\nRest in your heartbeat,\n\nwhere you have no enemies,\n\nwhere no one is to blame,\n\nwhere the journey has not begun,\n\nand even prayers for peace\n\ndo not need to speak.\n\nDisperse into what you are\n\nbefore you breathe,\n\nsmoke of sage in desert air.\n\nBurn away and remember,\n\nyour body is made of stars\n\nthat vanished eons ago.\n\nFriend, rest here\n\nin your own rhythm,\n\nwhere motion is stillness.\n\nThis is the secret.\n\nA nest inside an egg.\n\nA mother’s womb that carries\n\nher own savior.\n\nBe the seed of whatever\n\nyou are seeking.\n\nFlower on a Winter night.\n\n– Fred LaMotte\n\nThe birds are in their trees,\n\nthe toast is in the toaster,\n\nand the poets are at their windows.\n\nThey are at their windows\n\nin every section of the tangerine of earth –\n\nthe Chinese poets looking up at the moon,\n\nthe American poets gazing out\n\nat the pink and blue ribbons of sunrise.\n\nThe clerks are at their desks,\n\nthe miners are down in their mines,\n\nand the poets are looking out their windows\n\nmaybe with a cigarette, a cup of tea,\n\nand maybe a flannel shirt or bathrobe is involved.\n\nThe proofreaders are playing the ping-pong\n\ngame of proofreading,\n\nglancing back and forth from page to page,\n\nthe chefs are dicing celery and potatoes,\n\nand the poets are at their windows\n\nbecause it is their job for which\n\nthey are paid nothing every Friday afternoon.\n\nWhich window it hardly seems to matter\n\nthough many have a favorite,\n\nfor there is always something to see –\n\na bird grasping a thin branch,\n\nthe headlights of a taxi rounding a corner,\n\nthose two boys in wool caps angling across the street.\n\nThe fishermen bob in their boats,\n\nthe linemen climb their round poles,\n\nthe barbers wait by their mirrors and chairs,\n\nand the poets continue to stare\n\nat the cracked birdbath or a limb knocked down by the wind.\n\nBy now, it should go without saying\n\nthat what the oven is to the baker\n\nand the berry-stained blouse to the dry cleaner,\n\nso the window is to the poet.\n\nJust think –\n\nbefore the invention of the window,\n\nthe poets would have had to put on a jacket\n\nand a winter hat to go outside\n\nor remain indoors with only a wall to stare at.\n\nAnd when I say a wall,\n\nI do not mean a wall with striped wallpaper\n\nand a sketch of a cow in a frame.\n\nI mean a cold wall of fieldstones,\n\nthe wall of the medieval sonnet,\n\nthe original woman’s heart of stone,\n\nthe stone caught in the throat of her poet-lover.\n\n– Billy Collins\n\nThe Trouble with Poetry and Other Poems\n\nYour own view isn’t necessarily the way things really are.\n\n– Dogen\n\nThe greatest need of our time is to clean out the enormous mass of mental and emotional rubbish that clutters our minds and makes of all political and social life a mass illness. Without this housecleaning we cannot begin to see. Unless we see, we cannot think.\n\n– Thomas Merton\n\nThere’s only one way to proceed. Go inside yourself. Explore the reason that compels you to write; test whether it stretches its roots into the deepest part of your heart, admit to yourself whether you would have to die if the opportunity to write were withheld from you. Above all, ask yourself at your most silent hour of night: must I write?\n\n– Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nEmerging\n\nA man says yes without knowing\n\nhow to decide even what the question is,\n\nand is caught up, and then is carried along\n\nand never again escapes from his own cocoon;\n\nand that’s how we are, forever falling\n\ninto the deep well of other beings;\n\nand one thread wraps itself around our necks,\n\nanother entwines a foot, and then it is impossible,\n\nimpossible to move except in the well –\n\nnobody can rescue us from other people.\n\nIt seems as if we don’t know how to speak;\n\nit seems as if there are words which escape,\n\nwhich are missing, which have gone away and left us\n\nto ourselves, tangled up in snares and threads.\n\nAnd all at once, that’s it; we no longer know\n\nwhat it’s all about, but we are deep inside it,\n\nand now we will never see with the same eyes\n\nas once we did when we were children playing.\n\nNow these eyes are closed to us,\n\nNow our hands emerge from different arms.\n\nAnd therefore when you sleep, you are alone in your dreaming,\n\nand running freely through the corridors\n\nof one dream only, which belongs to you.\n\nOh never let them come to steal our dreams,\n\nnever let them entwine us in our bed.\n\nLet us hold on to the shadows\n\nto see if, from our own obscurity,\n\nwe emerge and grope along the walls,\n\nlie in wait for the light, to capture it,\n\ntill, once and for all time,\n\nit becomes our own, the sun of every day.\n\nI believe in two simple\n\nspiritual principles:\n\nthat we matter\n\nand that everyone else matters.\n\n– G. K. Chesterton\n\nIf war is caused by a clash of ideas, can peace on Earth be created by the alignment of ideas? Connecting one-by-one to like minds around the world, will we soon recognize our biological and mental similarities? Most of us share the same dreams and aspirations. Most of us want more peace, love and harmony in our lives. Most of us share a common compassion for those who suffer. In fact, this compassion for life–all life on Earth–draws us together like a gravitational force, and it may help us create a critical mass for our rapid evolution.\n\n– Alexia Parks, Rapid Evolution\n\nSo long as you write it away regularly nothing can really hurt you.\n\n– Shirley Jackson\n\nWe were all born with an authentic, jewel-like mind, simple and relaxed. But, as we go through life, gritty, dirty, endless complications shroud that jewel, covering up the grace and elegance it naturally contains. We grow clumsier and more awkward, constantly focusing on the grit and grime – the seemingly important things in life – all the while neglecting the precious jewel. We are fortunate, because the Buddhist path gives us a way to uncover the jewel of the mind, and a way to clean and polish it. We start by cultivating inner strength and inner well-being through meditation practice. At the same time we practice letting go of the grit and grime – the outer, unimportant things. This way, we can begin to relax and feel connected to life, to every moment of every single day. And graceful elegance slowly pierces the veil of our awkwardness.\n\n– Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche, Heart Advice\n\nThe true light never hides the darkness but is born out of the very center of it, transforming and redeeming. So to the darkness we must return, each of us individually accepting his ignorance and loneliness, his sin and weakness, and, most difficult of all, consenting to wait in the dark and even to love the waiting…\n\n– Helen M. Luke\n\nNo one wants to read poetry. You have to make it impossible for them to put the poem down–impossible for them to stop reading it, word after word. You have to keep them from closing the book.\n\n– Muriel Rukeyser\n\nEach of us literally chooses, by way of attending to things, what sort of universe he or she shall appear to inhabit.\n\n– William James\n\nI think people don’t place a high enough value on how much they are nurtured by doing whatever it is that totally absorbs them.\n\n– Jean Shinoda Bolen\n\nI have never known any distress that an hour’s reading did not relieve.\n\n– Montesquieu\n\nThe poet is much more the one who inspires than the one who is inspired.\n\n― Paul Éluard\n\nSyrian poet Dima Yousf:\n\nOh, if only the years were edible,\n\nso that the starving would chew them,\n\nand spit the bitter taste in our faces.\n\nOh, if only The Lord would see\n\nthe protruding bones of children,\n\nand would do something,\n\nanything,\n\nso that we wouldn’t lose faith.\n\nOh, if only my heart were a god.\n\nPoetry confronts in the most clear-eyed way just those emotions which consciousness wishes to slide by.\n\n– C. K. Williams\n\nBut the law of loving others could not be discovered by reason, because it is unreasonable.\n\n– Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina\n\nAfter Loki I was the first to borrow Freyja’s cloak of falcon feathers. I flew to you. Flew across centuries and oceans. I could not bear the separation and so, not finding you quickly enough, I consulted the Thrice Burnt Thrice Born, the she-witch Gullvieg. She spoke:\n\nI am sorry but there is nothing I can say that would not perchance dismantle, denude, destroy the careful contrivance you call “your life.” And so I laid down on pine bow bed, wildflower, arch of bones, Viking feast in the halls of Folkvangr. I practiced the sex magic of the old Norse: dwarves painted on the sides of barn timbers,\n\nthe deep pull of ancient wells,\n\nthe sorcery of touch wood,\n\nskin bag, ermine gloves.\n\nDue to my being a man, she would not at first see me. But she was Freyja’s sister and so I told her it was of you. I knew she would understand the backward way of love; I told her you are my household. I told her that without you I have no poetry. She laughed like lunacy. “Love’s unknowings outweigh human contrivances,” she whispered.\n\nShe burnt plants: henbane, mushroom, pine sap.\n\nShe unmade man-ness, took away gendering.\n\nShe went to her loom, loosened a knot in the woof,\n\nthe ways in which you were hidden were undone.\n\nShe tied a knot, the enemy was bound.\n\nShe made me a finder of futures and pasts.\n\nThat unsane sister tied the words ‘yours’ ‘mine’ to colored thread and wove them into the community of messengers – the bird headed females called envoys of sagas. Then and there I unbecame and became again. Now, unlike that odd species called “men,” I am not endangered (or engendered) by womanly freedoms….\n\nNow when I die I will go with the half who journey to Freyja; let the men who only know battle go to Odin.\n\n– Traktung Khepa\n\nBe around truth. Here’s why. Mystics claim (especially Sufi), that when we are surrounded by lies it creates so much activity and nervousness in our head in some subtle way we can’t properly enter our own bodies. Hence the need for friends where truth is a given, anything can be said, nothing need ever be concealed. We lose touch with our wingspan when we hunch.\n\n– Martin Shaw\n\nNot to listen is to be like a pot turned upside down. Not to be able to retain what you hear is to be like a pot with a hole in it. To mix negative emotions with what you hear is to be like a pot with poison in it. The upside-down pot: when you are listening to the teachings, listen to what is being said and do not let yourself be distracted by anything else. Otherwise you will be like an upside-down pot on which liquid is being poured. Although you are physically present, you do not hear a word of the teaching. The pot with a hole in it: if you just listen without remembering anything that you hear or understand, you will be like a pot with a leak: however much liquid is poured into it, nothing can stay. No matter how many teachings you hear, you can never assimilate them or put them into practice. The pot containing poison: if you listen to the teachings with the wrong attitude, such as the desire to become great or famous, or a mind full of the five poisons, the Dharma will not only fail to help your mind; it will also be changed into something that is not Dharma at all, like nectar poured into a pot containing poison.\n\n– Patrul Rinpoche, Words Of My Perfect Teacher\n\nUsually we shun difficult situations. But like peacocks that thrive on poison, Bodhisattvas thrive on adversity. Bodhisattvas have made a commitment to themselves to without interruption work for the happiness of everyone, regardless of how they are treated.\n\n– Barry Kerzin\n\nUltimately we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselves, more and more peace, and to reflect it toward others. The more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world.\n\n– Written by Etty Hillesum during her time in a concentration camp, 1943\n\nWhen by a teacher you are given medicine/blessings/instructions/sacred items of protection and any tool/remedy for purification-clearing-healing-balancing- use them.\n\nBe humble enough to understand that you really need them- don’t wait or hesitate- take them- and keep on using these medicines until they are finished and or you receive different instructions/medicines and or more.\n\nDon’t presume the medicines are ornaments or mementos. And don’t kid yourself that you are fine and don’t need it. They have been given to you to take/take up.\n\n– Belle Heywood\n\nSome people feel that the world’s problems are so pressing that social and political action should take precedence over individual development.\n\nThey may feel that they should sacrifice their own needs completely in order to work for a larger cause. In its extreme form, this kind of thinking justifies individual neurosis and aggression as purely a product of a troubled society, so that people feel they can hold on to their neurosis and even use their aggression to try to effect change.\n\nAccording to the Shambhala teachings, however, we have to recognize that our individual experience of sanity is inherently linked to our vision for a good human society.\n\nSo we have to take things one step at a time. If we try to solve society’s problems without overcoming the confusion and aggression in our own state of mind, then our efforts will only contribute to the basic problems, instead of solving them.\n\nThat is why the individual journey of warriorship must be undertaken before we can address the larger issue of how we can help this world. Still, it would be extremely unfortunate if Shambhala vision were taken as purely another attempt to build ourselves up while ignoring our responsibilities to others.\n\nThe point of warriorship is to become a gentle and tamed human being who can make a genuine contribution to the world. The warrior’s journey is based on discovering what is intrinsically good about human existence and how to share that basic goodness with others.\n\nThere is a natural order and harmony to this world, which we can discover. But we cannot just study that order scientifically or measure it mathematically. We have to feel it – in our bones, in our hearts, in our minds.\n\nIf we are thoroughly trained in the disciplines of warriorship, then by invoking the drala principle, we can reawaken that intimate connection to reality. That provides the ground to work with others in a genuine and gentle fashion.”\n\n– Chögyam Trungpa, Sacred Path of the Warrior\n\nI read them a poem by Phillip Lopate that someone once sent me, that goes:\n\nWe who are your closest friends feel the time has come to tell you that every Thursday we have been meeting, as a group, to devise ways to keep you in perpetual uncertainty frustration discontent and torture by neither loving you as much as you want nor cutting you adrift. Your analyst is in on it, plus your boyfriend and your ex-husband; and we have pledged to disappoint you as long as you need us. In announcing our association we realize we have placed in your hands a possible antidote against uncertainty indeed against ourselves. But since our Thursday nights have brought us to a community of purpose rare in itself with you as the natural center, we feel hopeful you will continue to make unreasonable demands for affection if not as a consequence of your disastrous personality then for the good of the collective.\n\n– Anne Lamott, Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life\n\nIf we are not regularly deeply embarrassed by who we are, the journey to self-knowledge hasn’t begun.\n\n– Alain de Botton, The Course of Love\n\nEvery song is the remains of love.\n\n– Federico Garcia Lorca\n\nO love,\n\nI who am lost and damned with words,\n\nWhose words are a business and an art,\n\nI have no words. These words, this poem, this\n\nIs all confusion and ignorance.\n\nBut I know that coached by your sweet heart,\n\nMy heart beat one free beat and sent\n\nThrough all my flesh the blood of truth.\n\n– Kenneth Rexroth\n\nYou are at once both the quiet and the confusion of my heart.\n\n– Franz Kafka\n\n…Who knows who I am? I change and change. But it is the boundary of my transformation, its pure rim: if it radiates love to you, deeply, good: then let us both believe in it.\n\n– Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nLoren Eiseley wrote in The Immense Journey that human beings are denied the dimension of time, so rooted are we in our particular now. We cannot in person step backward or forward from our circumscribed pinpoints. I cannot touch a leaf encased in ice—nor can I feel the calloused hands that stacked these walls. Yet we make our lives among relics and ruins of former times, former worlds. Each of us is, too, a landscape inscribed by memory and loss.\n\n– Lauret Savoy\n\nReal maturity is the integrity of inhabiting that “immortal longing” that always calls you to new horizons.\n\nYour true longing is to belong to the eternal that echoes continually in everything that happens to you.\n\nReal power has nothing to do with force, control, status, or money.\n\nReal power is the persistent courage to be at ease with the unsolved and the unfinished.\n\nTo be able to recognize, in the scattered graffiti of your desires, the signature of the eternal.\n\n– John O’Donohue, Eternal Echoes\n\nChogyam Trungpa ~ A balanced state of mind depends on the way you do things, the way you pour a cup of tea… It may seem like a really insignificant thing, but it means everything\n\nBecome a prayer-maker. Why? Because what you face in your life is bigger than you can handle. It is. Go to a place with shadows and privacy, and just start talking. There is some ancient Friend that wants to hear from you. No more dogma than that. Use your simple, holy, words. Then sit. Listen. Go for a walk. Let in.\n\n– Dr. Martin Shaw\n\nOur strategy should be not only to confront empire, but to lay siege to it. To deprive it of oxygen. To shame it. To mock it. With our art, our music, our literature, our stubbornness, our joy, our brilliance, our sheer relentlessness – and our ability to tell our own stories. Stories that are different from the ones we’re being brainwashed to believe.\n\n– Arundhati Roy\n\nIn contemplative meditation we use our thinking mind to develop insight and to focus on positive qualities like love and compassion. Thinking in the form of anxiety, worry, calculating, regret, guilt, paranoia, pride, envy, aggression, and craving etc. can obviously be a waste of energy, but thinking can also be creative, to the point, and oriented toward a process that is beneficial for ourselves and others.\n\n– David Nichtern\n\nIn the beginning I was so young and such a stranger to myself I hardly existed. I had to go out into the world and see it and hear it and react to it, before I knew at all who I was, what I was, what I wanted to be.\n\n– Mary Oliver, Upstream\n\nTo oppose something is to maintain it…You must go somewhere else; you must have another goal; then you walk a different road.\n\n– Ursula K.

Spend more time alone.\n\n– Joan Didion\n\nDreaming, waking or in between\n\nin any part of the multiverse\n\nin any body, in any life\n\nyou are invited to play\n\na memory game.\n\n…\n\nWhatever world you are in\n\nthe trick is to remember\n\nthe other worlds you inhabit\n\nwhere you are dead and more alive\n\nand the self that is dreaming you.\n\n– Robert Moss\n\nSam Hamill: Approaching Winter Solstice\n\nA bitter wind out of the north,\n\ngulls frozen to their icy perches,\n\nand a lone tug inching its way\n\nacross the bay. On the eastern horizon,\n\nthe great mountain in a robe\n\nof new snow, the sky turquoise blue.\n\nI have come far enough to know\n\nthe snows that bury dreams and wishes,\n\nthe blizzard in the soul that cries\n\nfor the warm embrace of love\n\nin the harshest season. But the world\n\nremains silent, but for moaning winds\n\nand the faint drone of mindless traffic\n\nin the distance. Who am I now,\n\nold and weathered, almost worn out,\n\nbut still that hunger, that faint light burning?\n\nI am a seeker, a wanderer in a world\n\nI never imagined. A soul seeks itself\n\nin a kindred soul, the need for a touch,\n\na knowing glance that makes the fire roar.\n\nSmoke and ash and an old man’s\n\nmerciless hunger. May the gods\n\nchew my gnarled bones when that time comes,\n\nbut in this soul there still is a story\n\nwaiting to be told, still a mystery\n\nto unfold, still a spark in the tinder\n\nof unknowing.\n\nNuthatch Logic\n\nToday, in the wood, I decided to converse\n\nwith nuthatch. “Nuthatch,” I said, “the\n\nworld seems upside down.”\n\nAnd, nuthatch squeaked in the way\n\nnuthatches do, and replied:\n\n“I can see how you would see it that way.\n\nI don’t understand how you people get\n\naround the way you do,\n\nAll that blood going to your feet. It must\n\nbe hard to think.”\n\nAnd, I could say no more.\n\n– Jamie K. Reaser\n\nTo make bread or love, to dig in the earth, to feed an animal or cook for a stranger — these activities require no extensive commentary, no lucid theology. All they require is someone willing to bend, reach, chop, stir. Most of these tasks are so full of pleasure that there is no need to complicate things by calling them holy. And yet these are the same activities that change lives, sometimes all at once and sometimes more slowly, the way dripping water changes stone. In a world where faith is often construed as a way of thinking, bodily practices remind the willing that faith is a way of life.\n\n– Barbara Brown Taylor\n\nYou are a function of what the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is a function of what the whole ocean is doing.\n\n– Alan W. Watts\n\nBees\n\nJane Hirshfield\n\nIn every instant, two gates.\n\nOne opens to fragrant paradise, one to hell….\n\nMostly we go through neither.\n\nMostly we nod to our neighbor,\n\nlean down to pick up the paper,\n\ngo back into the house.\n\nBut the faint cries—ecstasy? horror?\n\nOr did you think it the sound\n\nof distant bees,\n\nmaking only the thick honey of this good life?\n\nOn fighting fascism:\n\nThe first and possibly most important thing we can do is to resist accepting narrow definitions of everything. Let the nuances of supple understanding infect ideology. If carried out on a mass scale, this will force the government to deal with our stupendous diversity, which makes us far less easily manipulated.\n\nEvery facet of our understanding can synapse with those of other people and a much denser mesh work of connectivity forms in our collective body when we think deeply about what’s happening. But it’s the energy of love, flowing pervasively through the network, that really brings vitality into that network.\n\nProjecting ideology onto us is a very invasive form of violence that reduces the “neural” complexity of the world-organism we can develop. What we’re doing now is an egregiously violent suppression of the human will. The most important role for future government is to provide scaffolding that supports the formation of deeper networks that can respond to every world issue thoroughly and efficiently. That loosens the release valve of the human will and lets it find coordinated integration into the Network-will.\n\n– Joshua Wine Morriston\n\nWe cripple ourselves by only gazing from within our caves of reflection. If we would see with the eyes of freedom, we must be as open and as unceasing as the Sea.\n\n– Susie Motz\n\nIntimacy is seeing the other as they truly are. We make it so very difficult, shrouded in games and avoidance and so much noise. A masquerade ball masquerading as a complex interplay. But it’s so bare and so real and so bloody simple. It’s meeting each other where we live, below it all. No expectations. No mechanisms. No armor. True nakedness. Here I am. Here you are. Here we are.\n\n– Jeff Brown\n\nOur most profound prayers hardly reach our lips; they are made with our entire being.\n\n– Yahia Lababidi\n\nEvery one of us is called upon, perhaps many times, to start a new life. A frightening diagnosis, a marriage, a move, loss of a job…And onward full-tilt we go, pitched and wrecked and absurdly resolute, driven in spite of everything to make good on a new shore. To be hopeful, to embrace one possibility after another–that is surely the basic instinct…Crying out: High tide! Time to move out into the glorious debris. Time to take this life for what it is.”\n\n– Barbara Kingsolver\n\n…In this light we hunger for maturity, see it not as stasis\n\nbut a form of love. We want the stillness and confidence\n\nof age, the space between self and all the objects of the world\n\nhonoured and defined, the possibility that everything\n\nleft alone can ripen of its own accord,\n\nall passionate transformations arranged only\n\nthrough innocent meetings, one to another,\n\nthe way we see resin allowed to seep into the wood\n\nin the wood’s own secret time. We intuit our natures\n\nbecoming resonant with one another according\n\nto the grain of the way we are made. Nothing forced\n\nor wanted until it ripens in our own expectant hands.\n\nBut for now, in the busy room, we stand in the child’s\n\nfirst shy witness of one another, and see ourselves again,\n\ngladly and always, falling in love with our future.\n\n– David Whyte\n\nSensations, from the beginning, involve a sort of doing. This means that, in an important sense, it is your doing self that brings your core self into being. You are responsible at the very deepest level for what it feels like to be you. But then, for your next trick, well, how about spreading some of that soul dust onto the things around you? Remember, too, that it is your mind that projects phenomenal qualities onto external objects. If you only knew it, you yourself are responsible for the feel of the world.\n\n– Nicholas Humphrey\n\nFrom a third-story window above the Parc du Portugal,\n\nI’ve watched the snow come down all day.\n\nAs usual, there’s no one here. There never is.\n\nMercifully, the inner conversation is canceled by the white noise of winter.\n\nI am neither the mind, the intellect nor the silent voice within.\n\nThat’s also canceled.\n\nAnd now, gentle reader, in what name – in whose name –\n\ndo you come to idle with me\n\nin this luxurious and dwindling realms of aimless privacy?\n\n– Leonard Cohen\n\nMy religion is to seek the truth in life and life in the truth, even knowing I’ll not find them while I live; my religion is to fight incessantly and tirelessly with mystery.\n\n– Miguel de Unamuno\n\nI cannot live without books.\n\n– Thomas Jefferson\n\nWe have to do something about the “crude” factor in society: self-education, better language in speaking and writing, kindness.\n\n– Thomas Moore\n\nDon’t grieve. Anything you lose comes round in another form. – Rumi\n\nan absent lover returns as many others,\n\na nation forsaken in the shape of a new life;\n\npoems might take the place of mothers\n\nand friends gone come back as a wife.\n\nIf Love were not always a step ahead\n\nhow would it ensure we kept up the chase?\n\n– Yahia Lababidi\n\nHow admirable!\n\nto see the lightening and not think\n\nlife is fleeting.\n\n– Basho\n\n…In that realm\n\nheavenly music\n\nis played continually\n\nsix times during the\n\nday and night\n\nmandarava flowers\n\nrain down from the sky.\n\n– Amidakyo Sutra\n\nQUEST\n\nTake me past\n\nthe guarded place\n\nin you\n\nwhere confusion\n\ncovers itself\n\nin unrelenting confidence\n\nthen marches on\n\nIn lively steps\n\nTake off the façade\n\nlet it fall away\n\ninto nowhere\n\nTurn around and face me\n\nI search the infinite depth\n\nwhere beyond all entrenchments\n\nI find your thirst\n\nto be met\n\nand understood\n\nthe sadness in your bones,\n\nthe want of your silent cries\n\nto be heard\n\nand be known—\n\nabiding within those\n\nunseen landscapes\n\nis a world of precious\n\ndreams\n\nLet me touch where\n\nthe battle wounds\n\nlie quietly healing—\n\nBuried beneath\n\nan armored sheath\n\nrests a lifetime of love\n\nand loneliness,\n\nblame and triumph,\n\nhonor and defeat\n\nWithin this blended web\n\nof scars and treasures,\n\nglistening with honesty,\n\nthere you are—\n\nI found you,\n\nbeneath the soldier’s plated heart\n\nSo loosen the knots around my own\n\nsee all its agony bared and mending\n\nand in between each open space\n\nwe’ll breathe upon the frailty\n\nAll the wishful longings to be had\n\nbring to me yours\n\nas I meet you there with mine.\n\n– Susan Frybort, Hope is a Traveler\n\nIf we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man’s life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility.\n\n– Henry Longfellow\n\nI like for you to be still\n\nIt is as though you were absent\n\nAnd you hear me from far away\n\nAnd my voice does not touch you\n\nIt seems as though your eyes had flown away\n\nAnd it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth\n\nAs all things are filled with my soul\n\nYou emerge from the things\n\nFilled with my soul\n\nYou are like my soul\n\nA butterfly of dream\n\nAnd you are like the word: Melancholy\n\nI like for you to be still\n\nAnd you seem far away\n\nIt sounds as though you are lamenting\n\nA butterfly cooing like a dove\n\nAnd you hear me from far away\n\nAnd my voice does not reach you\n\nLet me come to be still in your silence\n\nAnd let me talk to you with your silence\n\nThat is bright as a lamp\n\nSimple, as a ring\n\nYou are like the night\n\nWith its stillness and constellations\n\nYour silence is that of a star\n\nAs remote and candid\n\nI like for you to be still\n\nIt is as though you are absent\n\nDistant and full of sorrow\n\nSo you would’ve died\n\nOne word then, One smile is enough\n\nAnd I’m happy;\n\nHappy that it’s not true\n\n– Pablo Neruda\n\nThese nights are gifts\n\nour hands unwrapping the darkness\n\nto see what we have.\n\n– Carol Ann Duffy, December\n\nAnd the night smells like\n\nsnow.\n\nWalking home for a\n\nmoment\n\nyou almost believe you\n\ncould start again.\n\nAnd an intense love\n\nrushes to your heart,\n\nand hope.

I can’t tell you what it is, but I can feel it, it’s a sort of a presence and sometimes it vibrates very strongly. Years ago someone told me that Flaubert said the objects we are drawn to are not haphazard, they are material expressions of something intangible but vital that our soul wishes to bring to our attention, they are clues, in other words, and we should decipher them as such.\n\n– Claire-Louise Bennet\n\nHowever this much I know: dissatisfaction with one’s self, and dissatisfaction with the world, is necessary–it is one of the prime things that keep the artist going on–that drives him [or her]–happiness, as such, must come in between times, as best it can.\n\n– Clarence John Laughlin\n\nOne Last Thing\n\nby Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer\n\nLet us lace our words with light—\n\nthe fragrant light we carry in our flesh.\n\nEven the darkest words can be said\n\nwith light, can be spoken with a seam\n\nof radiance, spoken as if the whole world\n\ndepends on us finding that inner shine\n\nand sharing it.\n\nReal seeing requires a flair for the unseen; real listening, a flair for the unspoken.\n\n– Dennis Lewis\n\nA man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own. The great instrument of moral good is the imagination.\n\n– Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nWhen thinking leads to the unthinkable, it is time to return to simple life. What thinking cannot solve, life solves, and what action never decides is reserved for thinking. If I ascend to the highest and most difficult on the one hand, and seek to eke out redemption that reaches even higher, then the true way does not lead upward, but towards the depths, since only my other leads me beyond myself. But acceptance of the other means a descent into the opposite, from seriousness into the laughable, from suffering into the cheerful, from the beautiful into the ugly , from the pure into the impure.\n\n– C.

The important thing is to speak well: with liveliness, thought, and grace. The rest will be given us as a gift.\n\n– Antonio Machado\n\nOne could say that “the world” exerts tremendous pressure on the psyche, collective opinion terrorizes the soul; the demands of the world obsess the pysche, and the world and its attractions offer to use up all the time available. Each person needs then, early on, to go inside, far enough inside to water the plants, awaken the animals, become friends with the desires, and sense what Machado calls “the living pulse of the spirit,” start the fire in the hearth, and close the door so that what is inside us has sufficient power to hold its own against the forces longing to invade.\n\n– Antonio Machado\n\nNow I am quietly waiting for / the catastrophe of my personality / to seem beautiful again, / and interesting, and modern.\n\n– Frank O’Hara\n\nRemember the landscape of your birth. Love your body and its memory of this place. Know true north and follow the red cord of passion. Listen to tree talk, water words, the voice of raven and hummingbird, and trust these at least as much as human speech. When the trees drop their leaves, let go of all you have outgrown. When the earth lies cold and still, rest. Blossom in season. When they tell you that you must kill for your country, or pay for the killing, talk back. Be faithful to what you love. Celebrate beauty every day.\n\n– Lorraine Anderson\n\nInto the darkness they go, the wise and the lovely.\n\n– Edna St. Vincent Millay\n\nWhen I am with you, we stay up all night.\n\nWhen you’re not here, I can’t go to sleep.\n\nPraise God for those two insomnias!\n\nAnd the difference between them.\n\n– Rumi\n\nThree points for an authentic spiritual practice:\n\n1) You need some shut up time. If you’re making noise all the time it is hard to pay attention, hard to notice the lessons and the lesson.\n\n2) You need some regularity. Doing it once might open your heart and eyes. Has happened. But most of us need to return and return and return.\n\n3) You need someone to check you. The brain is a great liar. We tell ourselves all sorts of stories about what we need and deserve, only some of which are true. Also along the spiritual way we have lots of experiences. Mostly of limited or actually no value on the way. Someone who has walked the way before you, who you have some trust in, and who is willing to say the hard truth now and again, is worth their weight in gold.\n\n– James Ford\n\nYoung men, don’t put your trust\n\ninto the trials of flight,\n\ninto the hot and quick.\n\nAll things already rest:\n\ndarkness and morning light,\n\nflower and book.\n\n– Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nWhen profound delicateness meets profound delicateness, with almost nothing happening, everything that matters most is happening: the exquisiteness of meeting.\n\n– John de Ruiter\n\nChogyam Trungpa ~ The practice of meditation is a way of unmasking ourselves, our deceptions of all kinds, and also the practice of meditation is a way of bringing out the subtleties of intelligence that exist within us. ~ The Path Is The Goal.\n\nWe wanted to unite all the people who were writers, who were musicians, who were artists, to demonstrate that the West and the United States was devoted to freedom of expression and to intellectual achievement, without any rigid barriers as to what you must write, and what you must say, and what you must do, and what you must paint, which was what was going on in the Soviet Union.

How you breathe.\n\n– William Stafford\n\nHow strange that the story is most true when it falls silent.\n\n– David Hinton, Existence: A Story\n\nNow I am the simple who rose up and lived; each day a blank, each night a catacomb.\n\n– Ruth Stone\n\nBENEDICTION\n\nBY JOSEPH FASANO\n\nBecause it is still possible to whisper yes\n\nanother hour, wander out through wintering\n\nawhile. Wade out through the deep snow\n\nof the pastures, the lost ones in the small skiffs\n\nof their shadows, the moon’s coins in the shallows\n\nof their palms. Lie down on the frozen drum-skin\n\nof the reservoir, in the immensities of the absences\n\nof the grasses, in the perfect ignorance of the wind.\n\nYou have had to begin over. You have had\n\nto empty your life of astonishing things,\n\nto give up what the lost cannot be given.\n\nYou have had to hand your vengeance to the great\n\ngods. Come, now: it is after\n\nevery hour. You have leaned down to your losses’\n\nhearts like yearlings, their little shoes of iron\n\nfor the voyage. You have salvaged them in darkness\n\nand done harm. Come, now: it is after\n\nevery after. In the lost’s songs, in this ruin\n\nthat has loosed you, be there to listen to it\n\nhappen: the winnowing, the wilder wings\n\ndeparting, a radiance arriving\n\nthrough night air. Be there\n\nto listen to them open: the wild wings\n\nin the cold air far above you, the doomed moon\n\nin the tatters of her splendor, the story\n\nin the winter’s bitter stars.\n\nIn the wind, in the bitter hands\n\nof winter, be there to listen to it\n\nwhisper: the one word, the world’s song\n\nyou have not sung, the one song\n\nyou can only be, not sing of;\n\nthe one song in the night air,\n\nin the high pines; its singing,\n\nwhich, in winter, as it plays\n\nyou, as you play out through the fading\n\nof the radiance, as your changing\n\ntakes its place among that radiance,\n\nmay have grace to make you almost what you are.\n\nReal love is one that triumphs lastingly, sometimes painfully, over the hurdles erected by time, space and the world.\n\n– Alan Baidou\n\nSweet love, renew thy force.\n\n– Shakespeare\n\nUltimately, America’s answer to the intolerant man is diversity, the very diversity which our heritage of religious freedom has inspired.\n\n– Robert F. Kennedy\n\nMay we all grow in grace and peace,\n\nand not neglect the silence that is printed\n\nin the centre of our being.\n\nIt will not fail us.\n\n– Thomas Merton\n\nVery sensitive, creative people have experiences of an extraordinary nature. Their quiet and passive openness allows fine energy to enter them. They use this energy to produce great works of creative expression, but their mechanism may not be strong enough to take in this refined energy in quantity. It accumulates, until it becomes strong enough to tear them apart. It is possible to determine in an abstract way the creative potential of a human being as a function of their physical strength and sensitivity. Sensitivity allows them to absorb a refined energy; strength enables the integration of that refined energy into the physical structure. But neither is useful without the other.\n\n– Rudi\n\nSomething that remained astonishing in this year of the greatest excitements, upheavals and disappointed expectations in his life was his capacity for concentration, his openness to intellectual matters, and the harmoniousness of style in his letters. There was in him a store of profound serenity – only poorly described by the word stoicism – that remained untouched by the awkward situations in which he found himself at that time and the upheavals designed to throw his existence off course.\n\n– Erdmut Wizisla, Walter Benjamin and Bertolt Brecht: The Story of a Friendship\n\nROBERT WRIGLEY\n\nArrowhead\n\nto my children, an explanation of Idaho\n\nFoolishness, to think it could be explained anymore\n\nthan Massachusetts or Maine. But know this:\n\nthat its boundaries, like theirs, are imaginary and political.\n\nThat it resembles Montana and spoons\n\nits eastward front thereto is, in truth, mostly incorrect,\n\nor that it imagines itself what it was,\n\nwhich was, before it was, almost no one’s\n\nbut the ravens’, who outnumber its people\n\neven today. What has come to be\n\nknown as Utah is a growth upon its rump,\n\nor it is, upon Utah’s narrow head,\n\na tumor fed by methamphetamine, beer,\n\nand The Church of Latter-day Saints.\n\nThat I have never known a Mormon\n\nI did not like immensely, except certain senators.\n\nThis can be explained. It is history.\n\nThat Idaho has in its history elected\n\nsenators of considerable greatness,\n\nbut not for a long time, not, at least,\n\nfor most of my life here and none of yours.\n\nThat the state is an embarrassment and a joy.\n\nIt has been dragged into the century\n\nbefore this one now well under way,\n\nits notions of liberty circumscribed\n\nby fearful ideas of stricture and malignity,\n\nusually religious, which in this republic\n\nhave not, will not, and cannot be explained.\n\nThat its rivers are among the purest\n\nand most beautiful in the same republic.\n\nThat it was established by the republic\n\nit hardly seems to want to be a part of anymore.\n\nThat it has a town called Dixie\n\nand a river called the Secesh, short\n\nfor secessionist, but also a Yankee Fork\n\nof the Salmon, and that the Salmon is its greatest river,\n\nnamed for a noble anadromous fish\n\nmost wild examples of which are gone from it.\n\nThat this is in part the fault of the republic\n\nit once prided itself on belonging to.\n\nThat it is not universally but all too abundantly\n\nracist. Neo-Nazis and Confederates\n\nwalk its occasional streets believing Hawaii\n\nis a nation on the continent of Africa.\n\nIts huckleberries are unparalleled,\n\nits mountains spectacular, and deer\n\nare its most numerous citizens.\n\nSome of its human citizens would rather\n\ndeer vote than anyone who is not white.\n\nThat television was invented here,\n\nfor which the state will neither be given credit\n\nnor forgiven. That at its least elevations\n\nthe temperature will reach 120 degrees\n\nevery summer, and at certain of its summits\n\nthe snow, until recently, never went away.\n\nThat its hot summer afternoons are indolent\n\nand perfect, winter nights cold\n\nand often ridiculous with stars. It lies\n\nathwart the Rockies, it is desert and peak,\n\ntundra and valley, prairie and canyon and forest.\n\nIts beauty can afflict you like a virus.\n\nThat much of its populace is poor and that it is\n\ndetermined to keep it that way. That it is\n\nfor sale and boasts more millionaires\n\nper capita than any other state.\n\nThat its potatoes are peerless and most\n\nAmericans cannot place it on a map,\n\nbelieving it must, like the other “I” states,\n\nbe Midwestern, and that is a good thing\n\nin many ways. That its name means nothing\n\nbut scans the same as Illinois, where\n\nI was born and one of you were,\n\nwhich can be explained, though Illinois cannot.\n\nThat Idaho, like all the other states, is history\n\nand toil, that massacres occurred here too.\n\nThat most of its people are kind,\n\nlike most people everywhere. That I have\n\nfor most of my life been in the employ of it\n\nand been made to feel all the while\n\nsomething very like an enemy of the state.\n\nThat for some reason I cannot leave,\n\nthough my own parents are aging or infirm\n\nmany miles away. This can be explained\n\nbut not to my own satisfaction. I feel filial guilt.\n\nTwo of you have happily left the state\n\nalready and the other aspires to. That of\n\nthe forty-two people named Robert Wrigley\n\nin the republic, I am the only one in Idaho.\n\nThere are probably more Wrigleys in Chicago\n\nthan Johnsons in Idaho. That Chicago\n\ncannot be explained. There are 242\n\nDick Johnsons in the nation, five in Idaho.\n\nThat the name Dick Johnson consists of two\n\neuphemisms for penis, and that such\n\na diminutive as Dick, when your surname\n\nis Johnson, can in this way be explained. That nothing’s\n\nin a name and wild roses are even now\n\nbudding out everywhere around me. There is\n\na domestic rose called Crepuscule,\n\nwhile these are wild and called Rosa woodsii. That one\n\nof you is named Jordan, a name your mother,\n\nwhen she was pregnant with you, spotted\n\non a lawyer’s office door\n\nin Salmon, Idaho. That you are the only\n\nJordan Wrigley in the republic, that your\n\nolder brother is one of only five Philip Wrigleys\n\nand that Philip Wrigley was one of the richest men\n\nin the nation the year of my birth. As for Jace,\n\nthe youngest of you, he is the only one\n\nanywhere—thus once you were all the only Philip, Jordan,\n\nand Jace Wrigleys in Idaho, as I am the only Robert.\n\nThis can be explained, this too is history,\n\nwhich, like the boundaries of Idaho,\n\nis imaginary and political to the extent\n\nthat every polity is a political construct\n\nand therefore imaginary, with the force of law.\n\nThat law is itself imaginary and if not\n\nuniversally agreed upon nevertheless occasionally enforced.\n\nThere was, until overturned, a law forbidding\n\na man marrying another man here, or a woman\n\nanother woman. And there was once,\n\nand not all that long ago, a law forbidding\n\nthe marriage of a Mormon to a non-Mormon,\n\nalso one forbidding the harvesting of fish\n\nwith electrical current or dynamite.\n\nThat this, all of it, can be explained.\n\nThere are cedar trees on this mountain\n\nolder than Chaucer and pine trees older than Whitman.\n\nThat the state, though it might claim otherwise,\n\ndoes not care for schools and teachers.\n\nThat in its Platonic way, the state\n\nalso does not much care for poets,\n\nand that in this regard it is like the others.\n\nThat the only true city in Idaho has a river with trout.\n\nThat the state’s trout should be foregone\n\nfor the trout of other places, and that this\n\nis explainable and entirely selfish of me.\n\nThat sometimes the moon risen\n\nover the mountain summit to the East\n\ncan bring me almost to tears. The most\n\nbeautiful place I have ever been is here,\n\nand I would pinpoint it for you\n\nbut not in this particular document,\n\nlest others, in light of my selfishness, should go there.\n\nThat I do not understand this impulse\n\nto explain that which cannot be.\n\nIt is possible you might have been\n\nbetter off, had you been raised elsewhere,\n\nthough I do not think this is true,\n\nbeyond certain measures economic and cultural.\n\nThere are things that cannot be explained\n\nwhich are vastly superior to those that can.\n\nThis document is in some way my form of prayer,\n\nand I pray most often to certain trees.\n\nSeeing a mountain lion when you are alone\n\nin the woods is a terrifying benediction.\n\nI hope you remember the afternoon\n\nwe watched from our porch above the river\n\ntwelve bald eagles circling in the sky above us.\n\nThe sound of a wolf howling is a miracle\n\nmany in the state would exterminate.\n\nThat it seems I cannot help myself.\n\nAs one of you has said, living in the state\n\nis like living in an abusive relationship:\n\nthere is always the hope it will get better.\n\nA woman once said to your mother\n\nraising children in this place is child abuse.\n\nThat we understand ourselves to be lucky somehow.\n\nThere is a place we hunted for arrowheads\n\nand hunting for arrowheads is illegal.\n\nWe did not know this, and I found a white one..\n\nWe were lucky. A man came from upriver that day,\n\nwalking along to shore to reach us.\n\n“How’s it going?” he asked, and I told him we were\n\nhunting arrowheads and extended my hand,\n\nthe white one in my palm. He looked away,\n\nout over the river. “Hunting arrowheads is illegal,”\n\nhe said. He said, “No, what you’re looking for is flint.”\n\nThat guns outnumber people here\n\nis the pure product of America, which is crazy.\n\nThat allusions are how writers congratulate themselves.\n\nArrowheads are made of flint: quartz, obsidian,\n\njasper, or chert. That making an arrowhead\n\nrequires two tools, a hammerstone and a billet,\n\nusually antler. Also enormous patience and skill.\n\nThere are likely thousands in that place along the river,\n\nlost among chips, fragments, and pebbles.\n\nToday I am in the little building I built\n\nalmost entirely by myself, though each of you\n\nhelped me some. That what I mean to say, is that\n\nlove is undertaken, and borne, that it is\n\nbeyond explanation and not worth living without.\n\nA snail’s glister trail across a leaf\n\nis a beauty that might be transmitted\n\nbut not explained. That I have met\n\nevery governor of the state since I’ve lived here,\n\nsave one, who was interim and is now\n\na senator, about whom the less I say the better\n\n(cf: lines 15–20 above). That sometimes\n\nwhen I’m fishing I understand a cutthroat trout\n\nis more distinguished than any man\n\nwho ever lived, certainly me. That I am by turns\n\nmisanthropic and generous,\n\nand this is something I might explain.\n\nThat I have been awakened in one-man tent\n\nby the howl of a wolf, that I have been\n\nawakened in a one-man tent by a bull moose\n\nsplashing in a mountain lake, that I have been\n\nawakened in a one-man tent with a desperate\n\nneed to pee, and that soon I stood peeing\n\nat the edge of camp and looked up to see\n\na bear risen manlike on its hind legs—\n\nit seemed hypnotized by a swirl\n\nof yellow butterflies just above its nose.\n\nThat it ran when it saw me there.\n\nIt leaped a fallen log as gracefully as a steeplechase\n\nthoroughbred and made no sound at all.\n\nThat the central Idaho wilderness\n\nis where God lives, which is to say, nobody.\n\nThat the central Idaho wilderness is larger\n\nthan many eastern states. That Connecticut\n\ncannot be explained. Nor most especially\n\nRhode Island, not being an island at all.\n\nThat according to current actuarial charts,\n\nI have just sixteen more years to live in Idaho.\n\nThat I have found a pound of morel mushrooms\n\nthis spring, and on one mushroom hunting trip\n\nI also found a perfect whitetailed buck’s skull,\n\nwith smooth antlers not the least gnawed by mice,\n\nand later on, in the same draw, I saw a doe lick the caul\n\nfrom her newborn fawn until it rose\n\nunsteadily and followed her into the brush.\n\nThat the Nimi’ipuu called this part of what is\n\nnow known as Idaho “Tat-Kin-Mah,” meaning\n\n“place of the spotted deer.” That Tatkinmah\n\nis also the name of the property owners’ association\n\nof which I am a member in good standing.\n\nThis can be explained, it is meant\n\nas homage, it is history. It is also\n\na species of historical rapaciousness\n\nthat makes me uneasy. That I like to walk\n\nin the woods at night, because it is impossible\n\nnot to be a little frightened by the dark.\n\nThere are very few darknesses in the republic so deep\n\nas those we may seek out and abide in here.\n\nThe man from the electric company\n\nthought I was crazy, when I asked\n\nthat the dusk-to-dawn yard light be removed.\n\nThat by darkness I mean nothing metaphorical,\n\nand that by metaphorical darkness I mean\n\nsuch darkness as is universal, historical, and political.\n\nAlso that the measure by which I love hating money\n\nis the obverse of how much I like having it.\n\nThat “In God We Trust” is on our currency\n\nand this can only be explained ironically.\n\nI do not know what liquidity has to do with money.\n\nThis is something I wish I could explain.\n\nThe song of the brown-headed cowbird\n\nis sweet and liquid, and the many-noted\n\ncall of the meadowlark makes me entirely glad.\n\nThe bugle of a bull elk is ethereal,\n\nand the scream of a mountain lion\n\nprimal, and once at a bar, given the choice\n\nof being killed by a grizzly bear\n\nor dying in a head-on collision, I said\n\nbear, and this is explainable. I am now\n\nrecovered from such romantic nitwittery.\n\nYour mother would rather sleep outdoors\n\nthan in, and that her elegance mystifies\n\nthose who know this mystifies me. That for me this is\n\nonly explainable in terms of Idaho.\n\nThat the female great horned owl’s hoo\n\nis deeper and more masculine-sounding\n\nthan its mate’s. Years ago I glanced up\n\nfrom a page to see out the window\n\na bald eagle, holding its place in the air,\n\nin the midst of a snowstorm on the Clearwater.\n\nIt was most surely not the case it turned\n\nto look at me, though it seemed to,\n\nbefore it slanted and soared back down\n\nto the river. Sometimes on my walks\n\nalong the shore, I used to lie next to the shallows,\n\njust so that I could see how the current\n\nin the middle was se"
