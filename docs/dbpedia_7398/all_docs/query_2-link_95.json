India is becoming like pre WW2 Nazi Germany.\n\nActually worse....considering we are in a different era and we are exposed to a different mindset....even a little racist is seen as a big no but India has gone full out\n\nWhile back then a little racist was a norm but nazi went full blown racist....\n\nThe thing u dont believe in will bring the peace in south asia. India is becoming like pre WW2 Nazi Germany.\n\nI am aware of the dangers, including the personal dangers that might await me and my wife when we go to Pakistan end of this year. Several people here are warning us to be aware. The haramkhor Indians probably have access to everything including our flight plans because they can trace everything from the home IP address. I am in IT myself. I would know how to do these things!!\n\nAnd..the point of this post here is that the Indian moles can damage ANY nationality or person because of their positions in IT departments. This is a message to CIA and FBI as if they are not already monitoring this forum already?!!\n\nTrust me.. in my previous job, I had access to 'Subpoenas' involving even before Trump became the President. In all honesty, I never read them at all. None of my business. But that's my moral compass.\n\nMy message in this post was/is to Americans: Indian moles in the American IT system are THE FIFTH COLUMNISTS to watch out for!! America should keep an eye on these moles in American system.\n\nI am aware of the dangers, including the personal dangers that might await me and my wife when we go to Pakistan end of this year.

They are not only taking american jobs but also threatening the citizens of the host country with consequences if they don't agree with their hindu supremacy ideology."
