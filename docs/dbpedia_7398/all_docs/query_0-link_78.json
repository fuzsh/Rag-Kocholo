        "text": "Salam to all of my Brothers. When we far away from our native land, we miss that, then we plan to go back but we indulge ourselves in works that our life pass even we unable to go back, my own experience revealed that we pass a life full of slavery in foreign countries, every moment we miss our native land, want to go back, looking with lusty eyes who still there. But then we suddenly become solemn that how we tell people who day & nights trying to get out of there & want to plunge in salvage life. There is nothing in abroad my countrymen just live there & try to settle there. Otherwise you will cry no one listen u & u get tired of entreating. Love my Hajira, missing a lot & every moment.Sagheer Sahib AOA. I wrote comments few days back but did not appear when I re-checked. Hence, I am going to address you again briefly.I was shocked to know that Babu Sb has passed away. He was the brother of one of my aunt(Mami).May God rest his Soul in peace.You have lost your parents and so have I in the same order as of your parents.My father died in 2007 n the dear mother died recently in Oct,2011. May almighty Allah grant eternal peace in the life hereafter to all deceased muslims including yours n my parents, Aamin.Now coming to the state of our neglected people. Yes you are right that we must undertake from our candidates before casting our vote for them. However,I have reservation for the outsider parties.They must not be allowed todo activities in AJK. They have made hell of Pakistan and are training their robots to do the same with the people in AJK also.May Allah save our people from their evil.I thank you for immediate response n Khuda Hafiz.Mohetram Abdul Qayyum Khan Sahib AOA\n\nThese are the problems faced by our people but some problems are self created\n\nif our people use their voting power and pressurize the candidates who want to contest\n\nthe election before elections and put their demands before him and ask him to fulfill these demands before polling then I think he can do something to ease their problems otherwise there is no solution except any honest person win the election\n\nfrom Karachi to Muzaffarabad looters & dacoos are our rulers so we can ,nt do anything only pray to Almighty ALLAH to show the right way to these looters.\n\nI am in Karachi since 1970 my age is 56 years you are very right I am son of Qazi Najamuddin(late) father died in 1996 mother died in 2008 now I have no one to pray for me . My elder brother Abbas Qureshi retired from PIA service 8 years B4 . I have 4 sons only the elder one is married and No.2 completed BBA and working in travelling agency 3rd one is studying in B.com final 4th is studying in 10th class\n\nI think you very well know about Babu Hassan Sb (late) of Paandi he died 3 mnth B4\n\nI go to Azad Kashmir Phagwati every year in the month of June/July I have 33 years\n\nin PIA . this is my introduction you know in Hajira Bazar Soofi Khadim Hussain Sb & Ghalab Din Sb are very close to us.\n\nI pray to ALLAH always guide & guard you\n\nWith Best wishes\n\nSagheer Qureshi 0300-2428076\n\nThanks Sagheer Qureshi Sb for responding on my comments.I admire your concern for poor and most neglected people of our area. In fact I was frustated not because of the deteriorating situation of our area only but also because of least concern from our educated people towards this grave situation. However,your comments encouraged me and I hope that the day is not very far away when this beautiful area of ours will be developped not by our so called leaders but by the common people ot the land themselve. Having said so, I come to my first teacher (late) who was your cousin.I really have great regards for his soul and you are lucky to be part of such a respectable family.In you next comment, kindly introduce yourself in a bit detail. Are you son of Qazi Najja. How old are you and since how long you hve been residing in Karachi.How many children you have and how old are they.I have three sons and two daughters. All of them have completed their education except the last daughter who is about to comlete her LLM. I pray for eternal peace for the soul of deceased Qazi Sahib and let us pray to Almighty Allah for enabling us to resolve our problems ouselves instead of waiting for so called leaders. Pay comlements to your family. Regards to all Kashmiries whereever they are. Allah Hafiz.Mob.0336-5199336Abdul Qayyum Sahib AOA\n\nI belong to Phagwati Khas and (Late) Qazi Baddaruddin Sahib was my cousin\n\nyou remarks must have reached to his soul you are 100% right that this is 4th term\n\nof Sardar Ghulam Sadiq Khan but as usual you can see and observe that no development work is going on. The Middle school Phagwati is still middle since 35 years\n\nand Girls primary school is still primary since 30 years the roads are badly damaged and no one is looking in it. there is no health centre in Akramabad, Chatrora or Phagwati so we have no comments for our MLA he should be himself looked in to his areas otherwise he will loose next elections. Please pray for him to pay attention on these basic issues.\n\nI am currently at Karachi working with PIA but I have great love for Azad Kashmir\n\nespecially Hajira, Phagwati .\n\nBest of luck & Best wishes to all .\n\nQazi Sagheer QureshiGharib Hanif, I wish that we could have a sincere leader like you who may do some good for our people.You have put up trmendous efforts in providing us a plateform to express our viws regarding beutiful but most neglected part of our country. It is pity that our leadership is dishonest to its own people. We have corruption in almost all public sector institutions, whether it may be health, education, judiciary,police or communication etc. I tell you one example of a school built by our elders on self help basis in Chatrora Phagwatti back somewhere in 1955-56. A teacher named Qazi Budrud Din late was deployed for teaching.I was one of the student who were enrolled on its opening ceremony. The credit of this school goes to all the poor people of that time in Chatrora,however, two of these people named Haji Subedar Diwan Ali Khan and Haji N/Sub Shahab-ud-Din Khan played the pivotal role in setting up this institution.I was one of those boys who passed their fifth class from this school in the year 1961. Later on, I studied in Faisalabad and Joined the government service. Now I have retired From Service after attaining the age of 60 years. My comment has gone too lengthy but what I wanted to explain that my old school was later converted to a girls school by my father somewhere in 1966 and again a private teacher was employed to teach.The government did not recognised it as a boys school,however it was recognised as a girl school in 1977 and a teacher was provided. Unluckily the school was not looked after and its building was not consrructed by government. Now after about 55 years since it started there is no building. The original building has been sold out inclding stones used in constructing it.It is stated that government has approved money for its reconsruction but no job has been started instead some of the very old trees near school have also been sold out. Since more than a year children are studying in my cousins house whose wife is also a teacher of this poor school. The school constructed by our poor elders have been sold out without eracting an alternate building which reflects one of the many curruptions of AJK Governments. The MLA of our constituancy Mr Ghulam Sadiq has been elected as speaker of Assembly but he also did not pay any attention towards this grave situation. I urge upon the honourable speaker to resolve this problem immediately before it is too late. This example shows that after more than 55 years the original school built on self help basis has been turned by our inefficient and currupt government into nothing instead of turning into a university.
