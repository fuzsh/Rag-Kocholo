        "text": "The Pakistani Federation has granted more autonomy to the provinces through the 18 th constitutional amendment. This autonomy has proved impetus for the ongoing demands of sub-national groups and provincial minorities for creation of new provinces in Pakistan. The Siraikis of South Punjab have been advocating for a separate province since 1970s. The analysis suggests that the movement appears quite successful in achieving some of its core objectives. However, the movement is still far away from attaining its ultimate political destination i.e. the establishment of a separate Siraiki Province. In this context, this paper attempts to investigate the prospects and challenges to the movement of Siraiki Province. The paper argues that without fundamental changes in its objectives and strategy, the movement would not be able to achieve its goal in near future. Though, a more accommodative and flexible approach would enhance the probability of its success.\n\nThis study examines the initial stage (1947-1953) of the Urdu/Punjabi controversy in Pakistani Punjab and the concomitant production of distinct language ideologies by different groups. I argue that three linguistic ideologies emerged in Lahore's intellectual scene in the post-partition years. One was a pro-Urdu ideology defended by Maulvi Abdul Haq and Maulana Salahuddin Ahmad, backed by the provincial government, and based on an assimilation between language and nation. The other two ideologies contested it: one was a Marxist ideology structured around the master binary of Bourgeoisie/People ('Avām), opposing the hegemonic use of Urdu and promoting Punjabi as a language of the people; and the other was an ideology supported by Pakistani nationalists mobilized by Faqir Muhammad Faqir and Abdul Majeed Salik, structured around the binary of Urdu-speaking settlers versus Punjabi natives and promoting Punjabi as a language of an ethnic community facing cultural and linguistic invasion.\n\nPunjab's current landscape is reminiscent of its past, as once again witnessing unrest and protest. The difference today is that the major issues faced by Punjab are the product of a chain of events in its history. The most impactful events chosen in this research are the partition of Punjab in 1947 and the period of religious unrest in 1984. Both events are used to provide a basis to the research that focuses on the current areas in decline across Punjab. Identity is a key facet to community strength. This research focuses on areas of language, culture, and religion to assess how they have been influenced by these past events. In doing so, the research aims to understand where Punjabi society has been affected most by tumultuous events of the past. It finds that language, identity, and politics have all been victim to the aftermath of communal unrest which is seen in the gradual weakening of a shared cultural identity for Punjabis. This research finds that contemporary issues like the water shortage and the farmers' protests are the result of historical divisions that have presented themselves through issues of language, identity, and politics.\n\nThis is the first history of the politics of language in Pakistan. It begins with the British language policies in South Asia, goes on to look at the HIndi-Urdu controversy in the 19th century and then examines the vernacular-English divide before independence. After that it examines at length the way language functioned as a symbol of ethnicity helping to construct a power group against policies which the counter elites speaking Bengali, Sindhi, Pashto, Siraiki, Blaochi, Brahvi and Punjabi considered unjust. All language movements are explained on instrumentalist grounds except the Punjabi language movement which is basically because of the loss of the mother-tongue by an educated elite. However, in all language movements the extra-rational dimension (anger, love and sentiment) do play a role so instrumentality is tempered with other factors.\n\nThis essay attempts to explore mass-based movement (munazzam awami tehreek) of democratic politics of the protagonists of Urdu, in post-independence Bihar, India. This politics clinched relatively greater success in persuading the provincial government to offer incentives of public employment for the Urdu-speaking population/Muslims. Compared to the adjacent province of Uttar Pradesh, apparently, the status of Urdu in Bihar is much less discouraging. A probable reason for a more assertive political movement for Urdu in Bihar is that the Muslim League’s separatist politics in late-colonial Bihar was much weaker. In the post-Partition/Independence period, when it became taboo for the Muslims to express their demands on the basis of religion, language movement emerged as a convenient tool of minority politics. Essentially speaking, the “popular politics” of Urdu in its first phase (1951–1971) functioned more as a “political society”, whereas in the second phase (1971–1989), as a “civil society”, when Urdu became the second official language. This movement maintained effective links with the relevant common population. Priority was more on seeking support and patronage of the government for the language to survive rather than making efforts to see that it thrives self-reliantly, except the Madrasas."
