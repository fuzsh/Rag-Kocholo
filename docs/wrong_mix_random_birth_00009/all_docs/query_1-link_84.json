        "text": "Led the Bulls to four NCAA Tournament appearances, including three trips to the second round\n\nAmerican Athletic Conference team championships in 2017, 2019\n\nAAC Coach of the Year in 2017, 2019\n\nCoached one ITA All-American and six All-AAC performers, including two AAC Players of the Year and one AAC Freshman of the Year\n\n14 seasons as a professional player on the ATP Tour\n\nCaptured four ATP tournament doubles championships, while reached the U.S. Open semifinals (2006) and the quarterfinals at Wimbledon (2004) and the Australian Open (2006)\n\nCareer high doubles world ranking was No. 19\n\nTwo-time All-American player for TCU, where he was ranked No. 1 nationally in doubles\n\nWorked as broadcaster for the Tennis Channel, ATP Media and FOX Sports at events such as the Australian Open and the Davis Cup\n\nUSF men’s tennis has enjoyed one of its most prosperous eras under head coach Ashley Fisher, who has led the Bulls to four NCAA Tournament appearances, two American Athletic Conference titles and an 86-58 dual-match record since taking over in the 2016-17 school year.\n\nFisher says the best is yet to come.\n\n“We’re always looking to continue the upward trajectory,’’ Fisher said. “The success we’ve had is good, but we want more than that. We are hungry to get even better.\n\n“We have been knocking on the door, very close to that breakthrough, very close to that big win. In sports or in life, it’s always hardest to do something you haven’t done before. Once that first domino falls, once that breakthrough happens, I believe you can not only get there, but stay there. And that’s our goal.’’\n\nFisher was AAC Coach of the Year in 2017 and 2019, the seasons when the Bulls captured conference titles. He has coached one ITA All-American, two AAC Players of the Year, one AAC Freshman of the Year and six all-conference players, along with two all-conference doubles teams.\n\nThe Bulls reached the NCAA Tournament’s second round three times in a four-season span (excluding the 2020 COVID season), defeating Duke 4-0 in 2017, Alabama 4-3 in 2019 and Duke 4-2 in 2021. The Bulls also made the 2022 NCAA Tournament field, but fell 4-3 against Miami in the first round.\n\nThe 2022 season was an exercise in patience. At midseason, the Bulls were 5-6 with four defeats by a 4-3 score. But USF, led by All-AAC singles player Ivan Yatsuk and doubles team Rithvik Bollipalli and Bruno Oliveira, got hot in the late season and earned the program’s 17th NCAA Tournament bid. The Bulls were boosted by a rigorous schedule that included 10 of the selections for the 64-team postseason field with three (Memphis, SMU, Tulsa) coming from the AAC.\n\nIn 2021, it was Jakub Wojcik, an All-AAC singles and doubles (with Bollipalli) performer, who helped the Bulls to an NCAA Tournament second-round finish. Meanwhile, Bollipalli and Wojcik reached the Round of 16 in NCAA doubles play.\n\nFisher’s 2019 team finished No. 23 in the final rankings, while winning the AAC championship and reaching the NCAA Tournament’s second round. That season, the Bulls had the AAC’s Player of the Year (Alberto Barroso-Campos, who finished 24th individually) and Freshman of the Year (Chase Ferguson). Barroso-Campos also was named an ITA All-American.\n\nIn 2017, Fisher’s first spring season, the Bulls won the AAC title behind conference Player of the Year Sasha Gozun and resoundingly defeated Duke 4-0 in the NCAA Tournament’s first round before being dismissed by No. 3-ranked and home-standing Georgia 4-1.\n\n“The underdog story has always resonated with me,’’ Fisher said. “As a player, I wasn’t a factor when I started out in college tennis (at TCU). I ended up as a No. 1-ranked player (in doubles), then top 20 in the world (on the professional tour).\n\n“It’s not where you start. It’s where you finish. I know what’s possible and I love taking on that role here. Some of the so-called brand-name schools might not see us coming. It’s great fun to surprise people.’’\n\nFisher, a USF assistant coach prior to his promotion to head coach on July 12, 2016, had a long career as a touring professional, television broadcaster and coach.\n\nHe spent 14 seasons (1998-2011) on the ATP Tour, capturing four ATP doubles titles, reaching the semifinals of the U.S. Open (2006) and quarterfinals of Wimbledon (2004) and the Australian Open (2006).\n\nHe reached as high as No. 19 in the world doubles rankings while winning 26 doubles titles and 23 minor-league challengers and futures events in the International Tennis Federation. Fisher competed in 41 grand slam tennis events, posting a 33-41 record. He served for four years as an elected representative on the ATP Player Council, serving with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal among others, before retiring from competition in 2011.\n\nAs a broadcaster, he worked as an analyst for the Tennis Channel, ATP Media and FOX Sports, covering numerous ATP World Tour events, the Davis Cup and the Australian Open.\n\nFisher began his coaching career working as a personal coach for Canadian Junior Tennis in 2004. Starting in 2012, he worked as a head coach on the ATP Tour, guiding professionals such as top 100 ranked ATP World Tour singles player Marinko Matosevic, No. 1 ranked ATP double players Max Mirnyi and 2014 Australian Open doubles champion Robert Lindstedt.\n\nFisher also worked as a touring tennis professional at The Renaissance, Vinoy Golf and Tennis Club in the Bay Area from 2010-16, and in 2014 was an assistant coach for the San Diego Aviators of Billie Jean King’s World Team Tennis league.\n\nA native of New South Wales, Australia, Fisher earned his bachelor’s degree in business administration from Texas Christian University in 1998. He was a two-time NCAA All-American, ranked No. 1 nationally in doubles, and reached the doubles final in the 1996 NCAA Championships during his four-year career with the Horned Frogs. He also served as team captain for a TCU team that was ranked No. 3 in the nation.\n\nFisher resides in St. Petersburg with his wife, Kirsten, and their two children, Holden and Declan."
