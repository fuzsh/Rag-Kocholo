Is the Administrative Board,\n\nbent on delaying: this necessary piece\n\nof construction, already half-com\n\npleted? Will there be another pro\n\nlonged struggle through all the good\n\npart or the year, leaving us with a\n\nmain rondwny torn up for months i\n\navaiu next winter? What reason and\n\nlogic does the board proceed upon In i\n\n?making no immediate provision for I\n\nthe extension of smooth paving on\n\nBroad street In accordance with the\n\npolicy once adopted and sanctioned by\n\ntiie citizens?\n\nThe board lets contracts for piece- j\n\ncneal paving all over the city. We J\n\nhave not the least doubt that all this '\n\nIs nee did and many miles more. But j\n\nnon* of it is needed more than the J\n\ncompletion of the remaining blocks on\n\nBroad .Street. Xothin.tr is needed more\n\n5n this community than the construc\n\ntion of qne big undertaking: in aeeord\n\nnnce with the size and importance of !\n\nthe city. If tve are not rich enough j\n\nSo pave all the streets we need, let us\n\nfct least, pet the principal one paved i\n\n7 ight.\n\nThe board declares that we can pay j\n\nfor this improvement by using the!\n\nitior.fy to be raised for a new market\n\nbuilding. Bui the board was not asked ;\n\nIn substitute Broad Street for the :\n\nmarket. It was asked to nap its funds |\n\nso that Broad Street would be paved, j\n\nMoreover, lite money Cor (he market!\n\nis to te provided on short time notes, j\n\n:n be covered by a later bond issue.\n\nThere has been no intention to bond\n\nthe city for Broad Street. This is\n\npractically the proposal of the board.\n\nTh\" Finance Committee has rightly\n\nderided against issuing bonds for\n\nstreet improvements, on the ground\n\nMiat the latter are temporary and '\n\nwear out bclore the bonds can be paid i\n\noff. It 5s no*. th.? province of the'\n\nboard, to use up all street funds else-I\n\nwhere and dictate how money must br !\n\nprovided for paving Bi'oad Street.\n\niiiehmond wants Broad Street smooth 1\n\npaved. It has decided that this is an J\n\nessential. The board should see that,\n\nit is don,- The present proposal will\n\nnot achieve this desired end, but cer\n\ntnlnlv arouse protest and Council .\n\naction that will waste valuable time !\n\nand hinder the progress of the com- j\n\nni u n i t y.\n\nt\n\nC ONSCIK.VCK i\\ KIXING WAGES.\n\nWhatever else may be the result of ,\n\nthe country-wide agitation about the I\n\nwages paid women and immorality, one j\n\ngood has already come. The public!\n\nconscience has been awakened as never\n\nbefore. Men and women, lawmakers '\n\n;?nd employers have been brought face\n\nto face with the facts It will be a ,\n\ndenial of civilization unlets something\n\nis done to remedy that part of the\n\nI'Vlln that I s'Vcrn citable by immediate !\n\naction, 'i'/f's \"netterment may come in I\n\nhome measure through legislative en- j\n\nnctment looking to *?ie establishment\n\nof certain wage standards, but we think\n\nit v.-ill come more largely from the\n\npressure exerted by public opinion up\n\non the employers of labor and upon\n\nsociety in general. Already, in Cleve\n\nland, large-spirited women have open\n\ned their own homes and started an in\n\nstitution to give working women the !\n\ncomforts and protection they so urgent- ;\n\n3y need. When employers are educat- I\n\n?d to refuse riches won at the price of\n\nwomen's lives and morals, and f<ood !\n\nwomen are educated to refuse bargains j\n\n?-.t 1 he expense of a sister's sacrifice, i\n\neomethlng will have been done.\n\nIt is idle to oeny the connection be\n\ntween wages and morals Jt get* us no\n\nwhere to hide behind certain obvious\n\nfacts. Admit at once that some women\n\nwill b6 moral on the smallest wage,\n\nand starve in tin defense of self .....\n\nspect.

Admit\n\nanything you want and the \\ ilal fact\n\nstill remains that our economic struc\n\nture, despite h rich country n-.ri ; hlfrh\n\n< ivillzutlon. does no; guarantee w?'\n\nmen who are forced to work a ihi;:*\n\nwage in return for their best efforts,\n\nl'laying ostrich, talking about home\n\nenvironment, rhetoric about putting a\n\nprice on virtue?these r.?> not change\n\nihe facts. The fruits of toll must be so\n\ndistributed that millions of women who\n\nare compelled to work, j.ot from\n\nchoice, but by economic pressure. can\n\nget enough to keep them deeentl>,\n\nor men must get enough to keep them\n\ndecently, either n.? fathers or bus\n\ntards.\n\nThe wages now paid women workers\n\nnvay be enough for them to llva on,\n\nbut th* III* will be so narrow, seml\n\n?n8M\n\nstarved and deaparata that it weakens\n\nwill power, and makes them easy pray\n\nto vicious men. Women are only hu\n\nman, Why should tliey be forced to\n\nbear tho burden of tho world's moral\n\nity? The bulk of theiu are neither\n\nmartyrs nor wantons. They want conij\n\nfort, peace, happiness, a t?Bte of pleas\n\nure and companionship. Has not God\n\nput enough wealth in the world to glvo\n\nthem these simple things legitimately?\n\nTHE TRAGEDY IX CREECK.\n\nOnce more the nations of the world\n\nare moved lo profound sympathy by\n\nthe assassination of a chosen ruler.\n\nThe King of Greece has paid the ter\n\nrible price of lofty position. For no\n\npersonal failing, but merely because\n\nhe was King, and stood as a repre\n\nsentative of kingly prerogative, lie lias\n\nbeen murdered by some bit of human\n\nI flotsam described as a \"Greek degen\n\nerate. '' The pity of these recurring\n\ntragedies is that no one is to blame.\n\nKing George had done nothliig against\n\nthe peace of his slayer. The man\n\nhimself probably had no merely crim\n\ninal intent. Fanaticism, misguided\n\nlove of democracy, a chance slipping\n\n' of his mind from focus, whenco came\n\n[the change from a love of humanity\n\nto the mad desire to vindicate it by\n\n; tudden death, something of this\n\nJ brought murder. It is a heavy price\n\nto pay for the title \"King,\" that of\n\n| being exposed to death from some too\n\nhot and passion, blinded heart and\n\nhead.\n\nThe United Stales must deeply re\n\ngret King George's death at this mo\n\nment. While the assassination itself\n\ndoes not seem to have had political\n\nsignificance, the change of rulers can\n\nnot but intensify the gravity of the\n\nEastern situation. Our own appre\n\nhensions as to Mexico just before in\n\nauguration hint as to what this may\n\nmean in Europe. The balance of sen\n\ntiment has been extremely delicate, and\n\nthe changed personal relations fol\n\nlowing on the assumption of the throne\n\nby Constantine XII. may make peace\n\nand re-adjustment more difficult.\n\nThe Balkan confederation, of which\n\nKing George was considered for Presi\n\ndent. has been in large measure sup- !\n\nported l?y England, France and Rus- i\n\nsia. King George was brother to\n\nDowager Queen Alexandra of England\n\nand to the Dowager of llussia. On\n\nthe other band, the wife of the new\n\nKing is a daughter of the German Em\n\nperor. Thereby is introduced a new\n\nelement into the already tangled sit\n\nuation. This country can but trust\n\nthat this useless death will result in\n\nno new bloodshed in Europe.\n\nVIRGINIA'S S'CllOOIi HO 1.1, AND lli\n\nJ,ITEKACV.\n\nA Census Bureau publication, an\n\nnounced to be issued soon, advance ;\n\nexcerpts from which have been sent\n\nout, and which \"analyzes tlie composi\n\ntion and character of Virginia's popu- ,\n\nlation.\" contains, anions other things,\n\nsome facts and figures in Illiteracy and\n\nschool attendance in the Ftate. of deep\n\ninterest to the public in general and :\n\nthose especially interested in educa- |\n\ntion in particular.\n\nThere are. it is .stated, ?32,911 il\n\nliterates in the State, representing 15.2\n\nper cent of the total population ten\n\nyears of iirp and over, as compared i\n\nwith 22.9 per cent in 1900.

Vet, \"In\n\nthe long run, the public has never\n\nbenefited by destructl\\e competition.\"\n\nNor does competition permanently re\n\nduce prices or charges. It may bo a\n\nslight stlmulunt, but true reduction\n\nof costs Is the result of protection\n\nthat insures bigger business and bet\n\nter methods of production.\n\nThe main conclusion reached Is that\n\ncontrolled monopolies give the best re\n\nsults In public service lieids. It is\n\nadmitted that regulation and control\n\nby commission has become a perma\n\nnent feature of our economic policy.\n\n\"That being so, it Is essential for the\n\nwell-being of the community that such\n\nregulation and control should be ef\n\nfective, equitable, acceptable lo the\n\npublic, arid final.\" They should also\n\nallow corporations freedom from undue\n\nrestraint or restriction on operations\n\nso long as good service is rendered\n\nat reasonable prices\n\nKvery word In this article applies\n\nto Richmond. The wisdom here dis\n\nclosed should profit us. The Adminis\n\ntrative Board and the Council should\n\n1 read and ponder. The end of all our\n\nmistakes will be regulated monopoly\n\nbecause economic laws demand it.

Vest's oldest son, John, en\n\nlisted as a private In tho Second Com\n\npany of Richmond Howitzers, and. as\n\nwas common In those days, carried\n\nwith him his young servant, Alex., to\n\nwait on him. \"Jack\" Vest, as lie was |\n\nfamiliarly called, joined the \"Renfrew\"\n\nMess of t lie Second Howitzers, so\n\nnatnod from a then recent visit of\n\nBaron Renfrew to Richmond, and Alex,\n\nwas duly Installed as the cook for i\n\nthat mess.\n\n'1*11o recollection of the fidelity and j\n\neflielericy with which Alex, performed\n\ntin? duties of ills humble position is\n\nnot only a cherished memory of the ]\n\nfew survivors of the \"Renfrew,\" but .\n\nof every other surviving member of ?\n\nthe Second Howitzers.

Such services can t\n\nonly be fully appreciated by a soldier i\n\nwho lias experienced the hardships and j\n\nprlvntions of arpiy life.\n\n\"Jack\" Vest, Alex.'s young \"master,\" i\n\ndied In the fall of 18(13, and although ]\n\nhis owner wanted him to return to\n\nhis home, where lie would have been\n\nsurrounded by every comfort, yet\n\nAlex, had become so attached to the\n\nmembers of Ills mess that ho got per\n\nmission to do so and remained and\n\nsurrendered with the Second Howit\n\nzers at Appomattox on April 9, 1865.\n\nAfter this event, tho sadness of Which\n\n' _ ?
