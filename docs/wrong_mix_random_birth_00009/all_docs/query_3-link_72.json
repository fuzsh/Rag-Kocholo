        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Playing in unseasonably cool temperatures, No. 35 Vanderbilt fell for just the second time this season on its home court, as No. 7 Ole Miss topped the Commodores, 6-1, on Friday at the Currey Tennis Center.\n\nThe loss dropped Vanderbilt to 10-6 overall and 2-5 in the Southeastern Conference. Ole Miss moved to 15-4 on the season and 5-2 in the SEC.\n\nBoth teams dealt with less-than-ideal weather conditions throughout the match. At first, a rain shower delayed warm-ups, forcing the match to start 30 minutes later than the intended start time. As the match progressed, the temperature continued to fall from the mid 60s early in the day to the mid 40s at the conclusion of the match. After Ole Miss had taken a 4-0 lead in the match, the remaining three singles matches were finished indoors due to rain.\n\nVanderbilt earned its lone point of the match in the No. 1 position, as No. 75 Ryan Preston earned a 6-2, 6-4 victory over No. 16 Matthias Wellermann of Ole Miss. The win for Preston was his second in a row and fourth this season over a ranked opponent. He is now 4-3 in the SEC in the No. 1 singles position.\n\nAfter Ole Miss won the doubles point, the Rebels were able to win the next three completed singles matches to clinch the overall match.\n\nOle Miss’ second point came in the No. 5 position, as Kalle Norberg downed Vanderbilt’s Alex Zotov, 6-1, 6-0. The loss halted Zotov’s two-match winning streak.\n\nThe Rebels were able to earn their third point in the No. 6 position, where Vanderbilt’s Adam Baker built a one-set lead before Ole Miss’ Jakob Klaeson was able to win the remaining two sets.\n\nThe clinching point came in the No. 4 position, where Ole Miss’ Jonas Berg defeated Vanderbilt’s Bryant Salcedo, 6-2, 6-4.\n\nFollowing the match in the No. 4 position, the remaining three matches at the Nos. 1, 2, and 3 positions were moved indoors due to rain.\n\nWith Ole Miss leading 4-0 in the match, Preston’s win made the score 4-1 before the Rebels were able to win the final two matches.\n\nIn the No. 3 position, No. 101 Vijay Paul lost a hard-fought match to No. 32 Robbye Poole of Ole Miss, 7-5, 6-4.\n\nLastly, Nick Cromydas dropped his match in the No. 2 position to No. 13 Erling Tveit of Ole Miss, 6-3, 7-5.\n\nIn doubles play, Ole Miss was able to win the point by sweeping all three matches. The loss in doubles play was Vanderbilt’s fourth in a row.\n\nThe first completed match came in the No. 2 position, where Nick Cromydas and Bryant Salcedo were defeated by Ole Miss’ duo of Robbye Poole and Matthias Wellermann, 8-4. The loss was just the second of the spring for Cromydas and Salcedo, who are now 8-2.\n\nClinching the doubles point was Ole Miss’ tandem of Tucker Vorster and Jakob Klaeson, who downed Vanderbilt’s Evan Dufaux and Adam Baker, 8-6, in the No. 2 position.\n\nIn the No. 1 doubles match, Vanderbilt’s team of Ryan Preston and Vijay Paul were defeated by No. 6 Erling Tveit and Jonas Berg, 8-5.\n\nUp next, Vanderbilt will conclude its home schedule against No. 38 Mississippi State at 1 p.m. on Sunday at the Currey Tennis Center.\n\nFriday’s Results:\n\nNo. 7 Ole Miss (14-4, 5-2 SEC) def. No. 35 Vanderbilt (10-6, 2-5 SEC), 6-1\n\nDoubles:\n\n1. No. 6 Erling Tveit/Jonas Berg (OM) def. Ryan Preston/Vijay Paul (VU), 8-5\n\n2. Robbye Poole/Matthias Wellermann (OM) def.
