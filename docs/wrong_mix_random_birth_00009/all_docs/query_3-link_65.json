        "text": "Too-Big Mac\n\nEnough, already! John McEnroe's mighty mouth threatens to devour\n\ntennis\n\nImagine if you'd approached John McEnroe toward the end of his\n\nplaying career and told him that a decade hence he'd have an\n\noutsized presence in tennis. He would likely have responded: You\n\ncannot be serious! Surely McEnroe would be too busy with his art\n\ngallery, his band and his family. Surely the game's biggest\n\niconoclast would ditch the tennis establishment as soon as\n\npossible.\n\nYet during the U.S. Open the past two weeks, it was impossible to\n\ntune in to the tournament and not encounter McEnroe's overexposed\n\nmug. Before the event he appeared on Letterman; during it he\n\nprovided some 80 hours of commentary for USA and CBS. He shilled\n\nfor Heineken and Lincoln. Until his opponent, Boris Becker,\n\npulled out with a foot injury, McEnroe was to have competed in a\n\n$100,000 stadium court exhibition match after Saturday's\n\nprime-time women's final. Close line calls were even replayed on\n\nthe Acuvue Mac Cam.\n\nPerhaps McEnroe's ubiquity would be easier to take if he weren't\n\nmarinating in hubris. Among his favorite themes: At age 42 he\n\ncould still hold his own on the tour in doubles. Time and again\n\nhe reminded us that he'd been asked to partner with defending\n\nU.S. Open doubles champion Max Mirnyi, 24, at Flushing Meadow\n\nthis year. (Asked about the invitation last week, Mirnyi said\n\nwith a laugh, \"I didn't think we'd win; I just wanted to play\n\nalongside a legend.\") McEnroe has also used his bully pulpit to\n\nincessantly promote his candidacy for the nonexistent position of\n\nCommissioner of Tennis. Please. This is a man who lobbied for\n\nyears to be the U.S Davis Cup captain. When he finally got the\n\njob, he alienated the top American players, trashed opposing\n\nathletes and coaches and blew off meetings and press conferences.\n\nDuring a disastrous 5-0 loss to Spain last summer, McEnroe showed\n\nup at a captain's breakfast in a bathrobe. After barely a year he\n\nquit in semidisgrace--then said he'd like to be named to a Davis\n\nCup doubles spot.\n\nMcEnroe also regularly bashes the men's game for its lack of\n\ncompelling personalities. He may have a point, but he's part of\n\nthe problem. So long as he refuses to cede the spotlight, he will\n\nupstage every player and render even the most colorful of them Al\n\nGore-bland. As one veteran pro puts it: \"We want to move forward\n\nand out of the Borg-McEnroe-Connors era, but John won't let it\n\nhappen.\"\n\nIn fairness, McEnroe does have genuine passion for the game, and\n\nhis willingness to take on the sport's sacred cows is admirable.\n\nHis candor and hilarious random ruminations as an analyst make\n\neven the most lopsided matches worth watching. During one of the\n\ncountless matches he called last week, McEnroe referred to\n\nhimself as an \"old soldier.\" No one is asking that he fade away\n\nentirely, but we sure wish he came in smaller doses. --L. Jon\n\nWertheim\n\nFive Old McFoes: What They're Up to Now\n\nBJORN BORG At bjornborg.net, offers eponymous line of\n\nleisurewear, handbags and perfumes, plus manifesto against\n\nunderpopulation (\"Drop your pants or drop dead\").\n\nJIMMY CONNORS Broke pro hiatus in July to play World Team\n\nTennis; lives in California with wife Patti, who owns and runs a\n\ngourmet food company, Patti's Pickledilly Pickles.\n\nIVAN LENDL Robotic Czech plays regularly on celebrity golf tour\n\non which he has one win. With business partners, building golf\n\ncomplex near his home in Goshen, Conn.\n\nILIE NASTASE Failed in 1996 campaign for mayor of Bucharest and\n\nin '99 bid for presidency of International Tennis Federation;\n\ndeveloping huge tennis academy in Bucharest.\n\nMATS WILANDER Coolheaded coach of Russian star Marat Safin; has\n\ninstituted $100 fine for each racket Safin intentionally breaks.\n\nSports and Religion\n\nA WIN OR A PRAYER?\n\nDodgers outfielder Shawn Green's decision to sit out L.A.'s Sept.\n\n26 game against the Giants--a matchup that could have an impact on\n\nthe Dodgers' postseason hopes--to observe Yom Kippur isn't the\n\nfirst time sports has run up against faith:\n\nEric Liddell. In a decision immortalized in Chariots of Fire, the\n\nBritish sprinter, a devout Presbyterian, opted not to compete in\n\nthe 100 meters at the 1924 Olympics because qualifying heats were\n\nto be held on a Sunday. Instead, Liddell ran the 200, earning the\n\nbronze, and the 400, which he won in Olympic record time.\n\nHank Greenberg. As his Tigers battled the Yankees for the 1934\n\npennant, Greenberg consulted a rabbi to decide whether he should\n\nplay on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. He was cleared to play on\n\nthe former, the celebratory Jewish New Year, but not the latter,\n\nthe somber Day of Atonement. Greenberg hit two homers in a 2-1\n\nwin over the Red Sox on Rosh Hashanah and then didn't play on Yom\n\nKippur nine days later. The Tigers won the pennant by seven\n\ngames.\n\nSandy Koufax. After earning pitching's version of the Triple\n\nCrown in 1965 (26 wins, 2.04 ERA, 382 strikeouts), the Dodgers\n\nace declined to pitch in Game 1 of the World Series against the\n\nTwins because it fell on Yom Kippur; replacement Don Drysdale was\n\nshelled for seven runs in 22/3 innings. Koufax lost Game 2 but\n\nrebounded to throw complete-game shutouts in Games 5 and 7 and\n\nwin the Series MVP award.\n\nDan Thomas. The prized Brewers outfield prospect joined the\n\nWorldwide Church of God before the 1977 season and declared that\n\nhe'd observe his church's Sabbath (sundown Friday to sundown\n\nSaturday). Dubbed the Sundown Kid, Thomas quickly dropped through\n\nthe farm system due to poor play and conflicts with managers. By\n\nseason's end the sun had set on his pro career.\n\nEdwin Correa. A Rangers righthander and Seventh-Day Adventist,\n\nCorrea negotiated with the team not to pitch on Friday nights or\n\nSaturday afternoons during the 1987 season. The arrangement was\n\nhonored until June 27, when, at the team's urging, he reluctantly\n\ntook the mound and won the first game of a Saturday doubleheader\n\nin Minnesota. In his next start, on July 5, Correa blew out his\n\nshoulder. He never pitched again.\n\nUneasy Riders\n\nJazz officials must have shuddered when Karl Malone announced\n\nhe'll drive a monster truck on the U.S. Hot Rod Association's\n\nMonster Jam Circuit. The Mailman, though, is apparently within\n\nhis rights. \"I have one stipulation in my contract with the\n\nJazz,\" said Malone, an avid hunter, \"and that's not shooting off\n\na horse.\" Other odd contract riders:\n\n--When soccer player Spencer Prior moved from English club\n\nManchester City to Cardiff City in June, he was contractually\n\nobliged to eat sheep's brain and testicles. Cardiff City's\n\nLebanese-born owner, Sam Hammam, believes the Middle Eastern\n\ndelicacies helped his players win promotion to the second\n\ndivision the previous season.\n\n--In 1999, injured Red Wings defenseman Uwe Krupp's rehab regimen\n\nincluded weekends spent dogsled racing, a practice the team\n\ncontends violated his contract. Detroit is refusing to pay Krupp\n\n$8.2 million in salary from the past two seasons. Krupp says his\n\ndeal does not ban dogsledding.\n\n--When first baseman Will Clark played for the Giants, he could\n\nnot participate in 54 specific activities, including wood\n\nchopping, ice boating and spelunking. Roger Clemens wasn't\n\nallowed to play jai alai when he pitched for the Red Sox.\n\n--Though Major League Soccer contracts forbid skydiving (as well\n\nas riding mopeds and hang gliding), Columbus Crew striker Brian\n\nMcBride took a plunge on a whim in 1997. He was fined $500.\n\n--Then, of course, there's Michael Jordan, who famously had a\n\n\"love of the game\" clause written into his Bulls contract,\n\nstating that MJ could play hoops anytime and anywhere he wished.\n\nWonder if he'll have the same deal with the Wizards?\n\nWhoa for Five\n\nWho says Keanu Reeves has limited range? In his new film,\n\nHardball (above, left), opening Friday, Reeves plays a baseball\n\ncoach, his latest athletic role. A review of his career stats:\n\nHardball Role Conor O'Neill, down-on-his-luck gambler forced to\n\ncoach urban Little League team. Display of athletic prowess\n\nScrambles up fire escape to outrun bookie's thugs. Career failing\n\nKeeps placing big bets on post-Jordan Bulls. Sports line \"What do\n\nI know about coaching baseball?\"\n\nThe Replacements Role Shane Falco (middle), ex-Ohio State\n\nquarterback turned replacement player. Display of athletic\n\nprowess Throws perfect spiral in first pro practice. Career\n\nfailing Choked in Sugar Bowl. Sports line \"Pain heals. Chicks dig\n\nscars. Glory lasts forever.\"\n\nPoint Break Role Johnny Utah, ex- Ohio State quarterback turned\n\nFBI agent. Display of athletic prowess Spins football on\n\nfingertip. Career failing Suffered a knee injury in Rose Bowl.\n\nSports line \"In high school I played football because my old man\n\nexpected me to.\"\n\nParenthood Role Tod (right), slacker drag racer. Display of\n\nathletic prowess Demonstrates WWF rassling techniques on\n\nbrother-in-law. Career failing Crashes brother's car in first\n\nrace. Sports line After being pulled from wreckage on track,\n\nasks, \"Did I win?\"\n\nYoungblood Role Heaver, French-Canadian minor league hockey\n\ngoalie. Display of athletic prowess Balances roll of stick tape\n\non his head. Career failing Can't stop any of Rob Lowe's shots in\n\npractice. Sports line No intelligible quotes.\n\nBlotter\n\nDeclined\n\nBy the Dodgers, a Giants request that the two teams dress in\n\n1951-style uniforms at PacBell Park on Sept. 16 to commemorate\n\nthe 50th anniversary of Bobby Thomson's Shot Heard 'Round the\n\nWorld. The Giants plan to wear the retro unis and celebrate\n\ntheir famous playoff victory without Los Angeles's participation.\n\nReached\n\nA settlement between four pro football coaches--Buddy Ryan, his\n\nsons Rex and Rob (assistants for the Ravens and the Patriots,\n\nrespectively), and former Dallas assistant Ernie Zampese--and a\n\ntrio of Texas high school coaches who'd sold the pro coaches'\n\nplaybooks on sportsplaybooks.com. The three agreed to pay each\n\nof the plaintiffs $3,000 and refrain from future sales.\n\nProbed\n\nBy the U.S. Justice Department, whether the ticket policy for\n\nthe Sept. 1 World Cup qualifier between the U.S. and Honduras at\n\nRFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., violated federal civil rights\n\nlaws. Honduran fans, including ambassador Hugo Noe Pino,\n\ncomplained that they were denied good seats for the game because\n\nthey were rooting for the visiting team. U.S. soccer officials\n\nsaid they wanted to restrict Honduran fans to the upper deck to\n\ncreate a pro-U.S. atmosphere but denied that the policy\n\ndiscriminated on the basis of national origin.\n\nLeft\n\nThe Reds, with huge pants to fill after hefty first baseman\n\nCalvin Pickering was claimed by the Red Sox on waivers.\n\nCincinnati got Pickering in a trade with the Orioles on Aug. 30\n\nbut lacked trousers big enough to fit the 295-pounder and had to\n\nbuy a pair of size-50 softball pants at a sporting-goods store.\n\nHis specially ordered gray road pants arrived last Friday, the\n\nday Boston made its waiver claim.\n\nspot Check\n\nThe NFL's \"This is what it's all about\" campaign\n\nSYNOPSIS A series of syrupy spots highlighting the softer side of\n\npro football. In one ad a teenage boy stays home to watch a game\n\nwith his grandmother rather than cruise for chicks with his\n\nbuddies. In another a Titans fan gets ready for a game while\n\nLionel Richie croons \"I'm easy like Sunday morning\" in the\n\nbackground.\n\nBACKGROUND After dropping its long-running \"Feel the Power\" ads,\n\nthe NFL turned to ad agency Young & Rubicam for a new approach.\n\n\"The league wasn't connecting to casual fans,\" says Y&R chief\n\ncreative officer Jim Ferguson. \"The NFL already has the hard-core\n\nfans in its pocket. All it has to do is put the game on TV, and\n\nit's got them hooked. But the untapped market is those casual\n\nfans, who enjoy the social aspects of football more than the game\n\nitself.\" Indeed, in 90 seconds of the new ads, only six seconds\n\nare of game footage. Says John Collins, the league's senior VP\n\nfor marketing, \"The underappreciated power of the NFL is its\n\nability to bring people together.\"\n\nBOTTOM LINE Reaching out to new fans makes sense, given that the\n\nNFL's ratings have dropped in five of the past six years. Still,\n\nthe kinder, gentler spots might be met with criticism from\n\ndie-hard fans. After all, Lionel Richie?\n\nBooty Call\n\nAh, parting is such sweet sorrow. But if you're a future Hall of\n\nFamer, it can also be rather lucrative. Take Cal Ripken Jr. and\n\nTony Gwynn, who in their final visits as players to major league\n\nparks have been racking up the going-away gifts. Here's a\n\nrundown of some of the loot they've received from opposing\n\nclubs, along with estimates of the gifts' value. (Most teams\n\nhave also contributed to Ripken's and Gwynn's charities.)\n\nRIPKEN VALUE\n\nA's Collection of Silver Oaks Cellars cabernet\n\nsauvignon from California's Alexander Valley $425\n\nANGELS An original drawing of Ripken with Mickey Mouse $1,000\n\nBRAVES Plaque commemorating Cal's 6-for-6\n\nnight against the Braves in 1999 $300 to $500\n\nDEVIL RAYS One-year supply of stone crab claws $700\n\nCommemorative oil painting $12,000\n\nMARINERS One-year supply of Dungeness crabs $1,800 to $2,100\n\nJersey signed by current Mariners $2,000\n\nMARLINS Three framed photos of Ripken and his father $300\n\nRANGERS Jersey signed by Texas players $500\n\nPair of Lucchese ostrich cowboy boots $600\n\nROYALS Portrait of Ripken breaking Japan's Sachio\n\nKinugasa's world record for consecutive games played $1,000\n\nWHITE SOX Wooden chair from old Comiskey Park $400 to $700\n\nDirt from old Comiskey PRICELESS\n\nTOTAL VALUE $21,025 to $21,825\n\nGWYNN\n\nASTROS Framed Texas flag $500\n\nHandmade sterling-silver belt buckle $500\n\nBRAVES Commemorative plaque $500\n\nBREWERS Harley Davidson leather jacket $500\n\nCARDINALS Pencil drawing of Gwynn signed by St. Louis\n\nplayers as well as by Lou Brock and Stan Musial $1,500 to $2,000\n\nMARLINS Bat signed by Florida players $400 to $500\n\nPHILLIES Miniature Liberty Bell $500\n\nOil portrait $5,000\n\nPIRATES Oil painting of Gwynn's game-winning\n\nhit in 1994 All-Star Game in Pittsburgh $1,000\n\nTOTAL VALUE $10,400 to $11,000\n\nthe Beat\n\nIchiro fever continues unabated in Japan, where every move\n\nMariners outfielder Ichiro Suzuki makes is reported and\n\ndissected (page 112). Not even the recent allegation of an\n\nextramarital affair between Suzuki and a 20-year-old Japanese\n\ncollege student in San Francisco has dampened his popularity.\n\nLast month the weekly Japanese tabloid Friday published what it\n\nsaid was the transcript of a sexually explicit phone\n\nconversation between Suzuki and a woman identified only as M.\n\nThe paper also quotes the woman's roommate as saying Suzuki and\n\nM met at least twice. In December, Friday reported that Suzuki,\n\nwhile a bachelor, had had a five-year affair with a married\n\nwoman and that he'd paid the woman's husband $100,000 to keep\n\nquiet about the relationship. After that story Suzuki held a\n\npress conference in which he fessed up to his \"thoughtless act\"\n\nbut said the relationship was over....\n\nLions receiver Herman Moore has fallen off the (high speed)\n\nwagon. After two subpar seasons Moore (above), a car freak who's\n\nowned a Ferrari Testarossa, a Lamborghini Diablo, four Jaguars\n\nand two Porsches, swore off his hot wheels habit. Then, after\n\nlearning in the off-season that he'd be featured in Detroit\n\ncoach Marty Mornhinweg's West Coast offense, Moore broke down\n\nand bought himself a treat: a Ferrari 360 Modena. \"I looked at\n\nred, black and silver,\" says Moore of his $200,000 toy. \"But the\n\nfly yellow stood out. Even sitting idle, it looks like it's\n\ngoing fast.\" So how fast does Moore go in the car? \"I'm not\n\nsaying. But if I put that kind of money in a car, it's not going\n\nto sit around as a collectible.\"...\n\nAmong the stars who turned out at the U.S. Open in support of\n\nVenus and Serena Williams were comedian Jamie Foxx, filmmaker\n\nSpike Lee and actress/singer Brandy. The sisters took the glitzy\n\nguests in stride, but Serena did get star-struck by one. When\n\ntold rapper Jay-Z had come to watch her, she broke down in a fit\n\nof giggles: \"Really? Really? Really? Oh my God. Oh my God.\n\nThat's a total shocker. Oh my. You know that's good. I don't\n\nknow what to say.\" Clearly.\n\nB/W PHOTO: BRAD RICKERBY/REUTERS HOLDING COURT Nine years after retiring, McEnroe dominates his sport.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: NEIL LEIFER Koufax's religion kept him out of Game 1 of the 1965 Series.\n\nCOLOR ILLUSTRATION: ILLUSTRATION BY FRED HARPER\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: CHUCK HODES/PARAMOUNT PICTURES (HARDBALL)\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: EVERETT COLLECTION (THE REPLACEMENTS)\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: NEAL PETERS COLLECTION (PARENTHOOD)\n\nCOLOR PHOTO\n\nB/W PHOTO: ACME (THOMSON)\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: JEFF MITCHELL/REUTERS (RIPKEN)\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: CHRIS GARDNER/AP (GWYNN)\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: TODD ROSENBERG (MOORE)\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: ROBERT BECK\n\nGo Figure\n\n2\n\nBasketball players on the court for Bosnia and Herzegovina at\n\nthe end of its 101-77 loss to Greece during the European\n\nchampionship tournament, after referees ejected every player on\n\nboth benches for brawling and three of the remaining five\n\nBosnian players fouled out in the final 90 seconds.\n\n5\n\nHits by White Sox shortstop Royce Clayton in Chicago's Sept. 4\n\ndoubleheader against the Tigers, equaling his total output for\n\nMay, when he went 5 for 48.\n\n15:26.10\n\nWinning time of Kenya's Paul Bitok in the 5,000 meters at the\n\nGoodwill Games; it was nearly three minutes off the world mark,\n\n14 seconds slower than the winning time in the women's 5,000 at\n\nthe Games and 41 seconds off the junior girls' world mark.\n\n0\n\nSteve Smiths to have played major league baseball, the only\n\nsport among the big four that has yet to field a Steve Smith.\n\nThis Week's Sign of the Apocalypse\n\nDuring its game with visiting Wofford, Clemson ordered its\n\nmarching band and cheerleaders to remain silent during breaks in\n\nthe action so that TV commercials could be played on the Memorial\n\nStadium video screen.\n\nCasual fans enjoy football's social aspect more than the game.\n\npage 34\n\nThey Said It"
