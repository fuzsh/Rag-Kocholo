Lee-Hesh rivalry good for tennis: Mirnyi

LONDON: Mahesh Bhupathi's doubles partner Max Mirnyi, in an interview, says the rivalry between Bhupathi and Leander Paes has made the two Indians better players.

<div class="section1"><div class="Normal">LONDON: You beat Pete Sampras, Roger Federer and Paradorn Srichaphan in ATP Tour events. You win the US Open doubles title and reach the singles quarterfinal. Your career earnings swell to over $ 3 million. <br /><br />That''s the beauty of being the Beast.<br /><br />''The Beast'' is Max Mirnyi, nicknamed so for being six feet five inches and possessing a thunder-ball serve. Known in India for being Mahesh Bhupathi''s doubles partner, the Belarussian is also a consistent performer in singles. He is among the better, busier players on the circuit and in 2002, his best season, played the second highest number of matches in a year - 127. Mirnyi made three ATP Tour semifinals before entering his maiden grand slam quarterfinal at Flushing Meadows, where he lost a night-time, four-set shoot-out to Andre Agassi in the Arthur Ashe stadium.<br /><br />The about-to-turn 26 Mirnyi spoke to Times News Network on Monday after beating Vince Spadea in the first round at Wimbledon, where he looms as a threat to the big names.<br /><br />Excerpts:<br /><br /><span style="" font-weight:="" bold="">You are among the few players who play singles and doubles.</span><br /><br />Doubles is important to me and a big part of my success. I am one of the few serve-volley players in the game, so doubles helps me prepare for my singles matches. <br /><br /><span style="" font-weight:="" bold="">What makes you and Mahesh click as a team?</span><br /><br />Mahesh and I started our careers at about the same time. We played Satellites and Challengers in India, Vietnam, Singapore, we got to know each othersÃ¢â¬â¢ families. I have known him for about eight years now. When there is so much of history, you are bound to connect. Mahesh is one of the best doubles players. He has won seven grand slams. You feel confident when you have some one of that calibre playing alongside. <br /><br /><span style="" font-weight:="" bold="">Are you friends or partners?</span><br /><br />Both. There is a difference between being just friends and being friends and partners. There are many good friends who donÃ¢â¬â¢t make good teams. Mahesh understands his priorities on the court, I understand mine. I used to wish he trained more off the court. I am happy that now he is working hard off the court. He has become fitter and more professional. <br /><br /><span style="" font-weight:="" bold="">There is an intensity to the contest when Mahesh and Leander are on opposite sides of the court. As MaheshÃ¢â¬â¢s partner, do you feel it?</span><br /><br />Certainly. I too deal with it when I play another Russian or Belarussian. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s good for the sport that there is a healthy rivalry between Leander and Mahesh. They were friends first, then things went wrong and now they want to prove themselves to one another. They have both become better players because of that. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a different match when they are competing. The great thing is they are still cordial and professional to each other. <br /><br /><span style="" font-weight:="" bold="">You do a lot of yoga. How does it help you?</span><br /><br />It stretches my body, relaxes me and I recover from the exertion of a match quicker. I was born to parents who were athletes. Mom swam, dad played volleyball. Physical education was a big part of my rearing. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s how yoga came into the picture. But I am no yogi. That requires spiritual involvement, not just postures.</div> </div>
