        "text": "Judith Shapiro is the co-author, with Liang Heng, of ''Son of the Revolution'' and ''Intellectual Freedom in China After Mao.'' SIX CHAPTERS FROM MY LIFE ''DOWNUNDER''\n\nBy Yang Jiang. Translated by Howard Goldblatt. Introduced by Jonathan Spence. 111 pp. Seattle: University of Washington Press. $10.95.\n\nIn richness, moral urgency and drama, there can be few events of history with greater literary potential than the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Yang Jiang's ''Six Chapters from My Life 'Downunder,' '' her slender account of being sent ''down'' for two years to a re- education school in the countryside, is one of the few memoirs of the period and all the more precious for that.\n\nEven as the Chinese Government condemns the Cultural Revolution as a 10-year disaster, it has curtailed the ''wound literature'' that began appearing when post-Mao China was at its most liberal in 1978-79. It has done so partly out of fear that a deep examination of Mao's role in the revolution would lead to a questioning of the legitimacy of the Communist Party itself (although responsibility lies at least as much with the Chinese people). The party may also believe the Chinese have been so bruised that dwelling on the past could lead to a crippling national despair.\n\nThe party's position has combined with a deeply felt reluctance on the part of many Chinese to speak of their personal tragedies. The Chinese have a tradition of pride in their ability to bear suffering (the so-called ''eat bitterness spirit''), and they share a feudal obedience to authority so profound that their understanding of democracy often implies simply the right to make constructive suggestions to those in power. One of the Cultural Revolution's best-learned lessons was the danger of thinking and speaking of injustices about which little can be done. It is true too that few seek sympathy when most potential listeners could match every sad tale with one of their own, the suicide of a parent for the murder of a sister, the humiliation of a beloved teacher for the burning of a pile of rare books and paintings, a lost education and physical hardships for a guilty memory and a sense of having been used.\n\nEducated in Western literature at Oxford University and in Paris, Yang Jiang returned to China with her eminent husband, the writer and critic Qian Zhongshu, in the 1930's. Both became attached to the Literature Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China's most prestigious think tank. Her memoir covers the two years the already elderly couple spent at separate but nearby re-education schools in rural Henan Province and concentrates on the details of her daily life, such as digging a well, standing guard over a vegetable plot, being befriended by a puppy and managing to find ways of seeing her husband, stationed with the men's ''platoon'' an hour's walk away.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
