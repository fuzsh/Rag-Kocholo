        "text": "By Vivian Yang\n\nA book titled Will Drink Tea （《将饮茶》） by Yang Jiang (1911-2016), a well-known Chinese writer and translator, was auctioned at RMB 66,500 yuan on JD’s auction platform on Jan. 12, after 153 bidding rounds with a starting price of RMB 500 yuan. There are two pages of handwriting dedication between the cover and the title page by Yang and her husband, which makes this book a collectable item. The inscriptions are poems expressing their mutual respect and appreciation.\n\nYang was the wife of late Chinese literary giant Qian Zhongshu (1910-1998), who is best known for his satirical novel Fortress Besieged （《围城》）, which is considered one of the masterpieces of twentieth century Chinese literature and widely recognized internationally.\n\nYang Jiang (left) and Qian Zhongshu\n\nThe couple became household names in China not only because of their literary achievements, but also because of their love, recounted through written stories about their relationship and family. In the auctioned book, Madame Yang wrote about how she met and fell in love with Qian, and how they supported each other during their studies in the UK and France from 1935 to 1937, and during the decade-long turbulent period in China from 1966 to 1976.\n\n(vivian.yang@jd.com)\n\nJD Super, the supermarket division of JD Retail, alongside Feihe, China’s leading infant formula company, announced significant enhancements to their pioneering 28-day “farm-to-milk bottle” delivery service on August 19th in Beijing. These improvements include a new compensation policy to guarantee freshness for consumers.\n\nThis enhanced service ensures that if a customer purchases a Feihe product through JD’s app that is marked with the “28-day fresh delivery” label and discovers the production date exceeds 28 days, they are eligible to receive compensation equal to the amount of their purchase. This new policy underscores the companies’ commitment to superior product quality and transparency.\n\nDuring the press conference, JD Super and Feihe also announced advancements in their logistics, achieving delivery time as fast as 10 days by optimizing warehousing and distribution processes. This pushes the envelope for the industry in terms of speed and ensures the freshness of infant formula.\n\nThe initiative, which began last August with Feihe’s Zhuorui product line, created an expedited supply chain that delivers freshly produced formula to consumers within 28 days. Since its inception, the service has been extended to include all of Feihe’s leading formulas, resulting in an eightfold sales increase year-over-year. Presently, the average duration from farm to bottle is only 22 days, optimizing the nutritional benefits and freshness for infants.\n\nJD.com’s recent quarterly earnings report exhibited strong growth in its supermarket segment. CEO Sandy Xu emphasized that enhancing supply chain efficiency and focusing on customer experience are pivotal to JD’s strategy for sustained, high-quality growth.\n\nThe partnership between JD Super and Feihe demonstrates how innovative supply chain solutions can lead to both business growth and improved customer satisfaction in the competitive retail market.\n\n(vivian.yang@jd.com)\n\nOn August 20 at 10 AM Beijing time, China’s first AAA video game, Black Myth: Wukong, was officially released. As the official global partner of the game, JD.com, (Jingdong) successfully delivered the much-anticipated physical editions, including both the collector’s and deluxe editions, to nationwide gamers aptly dubbed the “Destined Ones.”\n\nAccording to JD’s data, over 1.1 million gamers attempted to reserve the limited physical copies of the game. The world’s first collector’s edition of the game was delivered to a Beijing customer by JD.com in the morning of August 18. JD.com also commemorated the game’s release by launching a promotional campaign for branded gaming accessories.\n\nTo ensure a prompt delivery of this highly sought-after game, JD Logistics, JD.com’s dedicated logistics arm, utilized its expansive nationwide network and placed inventory in eight regional logistics parks, facilitating a swift distribution. Gamers in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou received their orders as early as the morning of August 18, thanks to JD’s in-house courier service.\n\nAs China’s leading online shopping platform, particularly in the area of electronics products, JD.com has been deeply involved in the gaming industry since 2015. The company has evolved into a comprehensive hub for gaming—offering everything from games and gear to content and entertainment. In recent years, JD.com has intensified its efforts to foster a broader gaming ecosystem. This includes launching cutting-edge products, providing top-tier services and entertainment, and supporting the gaming community through initiatives like establishing e-sports teams (JDG and JDE) and hosting e-sports events (JD Cup).\n\n(yuchuan.wang@jd.com)"
