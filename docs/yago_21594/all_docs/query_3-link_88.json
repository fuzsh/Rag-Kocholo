Comprehensive Practice\n\n4.1 Cloze\n\nIn putting into words how much we adore someone, sometimes it is easier to do so in correspondence than face-to-face. One cannot help but sympathize with the lover who, gazing upon the object of his affection face-to-face, becomes overwhelmed and lost for words. Here distance may help. For separation not only makes the heart grow fonder, it also provides the perfect excuse for a(n) exchange of love letters in which the tongue-tied lover can give a more impressive display of his innermost thoughts. Unable to bring himself to speak freely about his feelings, with pen and paper on hand he may nonetheless easily fill pages with fine words. Watered by these, love will hopefully bloom.\n\n4.2 Translation\n\n1. George longs for a chance to meet her, but he can’t bring himself to tell her about it.\n\n2.

It has made me very warm inside. It is terrific, wonderful, shattering.\n\n2. I do not know how long leave I shall get. I could get as little as 14 days and I may get as much as a month. I’m wondering how I shall tell you I’m in England. Probably it’s still quicker to send a telegram than a letter. And I hope to send you one announcing that I am on the same island.
