In the first part, Yang Jiang, wife of Qian Zhongshu, in her consistent writing style, depicts the life of last few years when the whole family lived together. The second part tells ups and downs of her family in 63 years from she and Qian going to study in England in 1935, to their daughter being born in Oxford, and to the death of Qian in 1998. They had covered half of the earth and went through half century. They experienced war, diseases, political storm, and life and death. But no matter what, they sticked together as a family.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title."
