It assesses their novels, essays, stories, poetry, plays, translations, and criticism, and discusses their reception as two of the most important Chinese scholar-writers of the twentieth century. In addition to re-evaluating this married couple's intertwined literary careers, the book also explains why they have come to represent such influential models of Chinese literary cosmopolitanism. Uncommonly well-versed in Western languages and literatures, Qian and Yang chose to live in China and write in Chinese. China's Literary Cosmopolitans argues for their artistic importance while analyzing their works againstthe modern cultural imperative that Chinese literature be worldly. Christopher Rea (Ph.D., Columbia) is Associate Professor of Asian Studies at the University of British Columbia. He is the author of The Age of Irreverence: A New History of Laughter in China (California, 2015), co-editor of The Business of Culture: Cultural Entrepreneurs in China and Southeast Asia, 1900-65 (ubc Press, 2015), and editor of Humans, Beasts, and Ghosts: Stories and Essays by Qian Zhongshu(Columbia, 2011).",
