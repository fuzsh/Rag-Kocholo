        "text": "The twentieth century was when China was contracted from being the “world” to merely a “nation.” The drastic change of the geographical and political perception of China led to a revision of traditional ideas that were believed to hold universal value. Against this background, the reevaluation of a supposedly pre-Qin figure became particularly interesting in revealing how the paradigm shift subverted the conventional criteria of value. In this paper, I examine how Liang Qichao 梁啟超 (1873–1929), a leading intellectual in the early twentieth century, made his contribution to the revision of Yang Zhu 楊朱 (approximately 400 BCE), the long-standing “heretic” in Chinese intellectual history. By retracing Liang’s early portrayal of Yang Zhu, I present how Yang Zhu gained his modern image as a valuable ancient Chinese philosopher after thousands of years of being considered mostly negative or irrelevant. I also show how, by introducing Yang Zhu in this way, modern intellectuals negotiated the meanings of imported modern concepts.\n\n​ The article aims to rethink the pluralistic intellectual currents and social changes of the last centuries in China: how literati reacted to the historical changes, the economic developments, the collapse of the hierarchical order, and the social mobility from the end of the Ming to the middle of the Qing dynasty. Urbanisation, the great silver inflow, the acceleration of trade, and social mobility raised new challenges to the orthodox view of the world and to Neo-Confucian norms. These new attitudes of the Chinese literati – which can be inferred both from literary and philosophical works – uncover new attitudes in the mental structure of the intellectual strata of the time. In the history of ideas we notice a progressive detachment from the orthodox view of the conflictual relationship between principle and desires, especially in the ambit of the Taizhou school. The elaboration of a new anthropological mindset aimed at the rehabilitation of passions and desires culminated with Li Zhi. This trend went on in the Qing period, from Wang Fuzhi to Dai Zhen. Also in literature such trend, the so-called 'cult of ​ qing​ ', can be found with the moral justification of emotion-desire (establishing emotion as a genuine and active source of virtue), and with the vitalistic identification of emotions as the source of life and reproduction. Another indication of the change of mentality is the challenge of common and accepted truisms through the praise of 'folly' in real life situations and literary works: to be 'crazy' and 'foolish' becomes a sign of distinction among certain intellectual circles, in contrast with the pedant orthodox scholars and officials and the vulgar ​ nouveaux riches​. The unconventional character of the anti-hero Baoyu is emblematic, with his aversion for any kind of official ceremony and convention, his abnormal sensibility and impractical and naïve mentality, and his consciousness of being different from others. The crisis of the established ladder of values can be seen in the exaltation of 'amoral' wisdom and in the presentation of various dimensions of love, from the idealistic sentiment of 'the talented student and the beautiful girl' to the metaphysical passion that overcomes death, and to the minimalist concept of ​ '​ love is like food​ ' in a ​ carpe diem perspective​. ​ And finally another challenge is exemplified by Yuan Mei's reflections on the concept of Heavenly Mandate, retribution, human responsibility, and historical constructions by resorting to 'abnormal' phenomena to uncover the absurdity of reality and unconscious imagery. His questions testify the polyphonic debates of the late imperial China, besides established conventions and Neo-Confucian orthodoxy. KEY WORDS : Literati, modernisation, desires and principles, Li Zhi, cult of qing, foolishness, Yuan Mei, retribution, human responsibility"
