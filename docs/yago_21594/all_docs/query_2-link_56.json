This document provides context about the novel Fortress Besieged by Qian Zhongshu. It discusses how the novel was written during a difficult time in Chinese history when Japan invaded China in 1937. While the war is not depicted directly, its effects are shown through the experiences of the protagonist Fang Hung-chien as he travels around China. The novel operates on multiple levels, providing social commentary while also satirizing Chinese intellectuals and relationships between men and women. It reflects both the author Qian Zhongshu's own experiences living in China during the war and his critique of Western literary theories being excessively adapted by Chinese writers.",
