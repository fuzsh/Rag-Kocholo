        "text": "Abstract\n\nIf, for most of us, marriage is supposed to be a “fortress besieged”—a battle of conflicting impulses to conquer and to flee—the same is rarely said of Qian Zhongshu and Yang Jiang, whose marriage lasted sixty-three years, from 1935 until Qian’s death in 1998. Since then, Yang has actively managed Qian’s literary estate and continued to write about their life together, and, to a lesser extent, with their daughter Qian Yuan, who died in 1997. Qian Zhongshu mostly let his writings speak for themselves; Yang Jiang, in contrast, has made extensive efforts to place her and her husband’s within a context different from solo creative and academic labor: quotidian family life. Yang’s story of her marriage with Qian is of a harmonious, affectionate, and even romantic intellectual partnership. Her biographical and autobiographical writings could be said to have retroactively domesticated the famous couple, making their private life public, and in doing so dramatically re-shaping public appreciation of them and their works.2"
