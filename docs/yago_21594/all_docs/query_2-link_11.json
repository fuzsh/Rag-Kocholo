        "text": "By Li Han\n\nStaff Writer of the Tsinghua News Center\n\nThe year 2008 marks the tenth anniversary of the death of famous Chinese literary scholar and writer Qian Zhongshu, who died on December 19, 1998. An exhibition which focuses on Qian’s life and achievements, a forum, and memorial activities were recently held at Tsinghua University to honor his memory.\n\nBorn in Wuxi on November 21, 1910, Qian Zhongshu was known for his rapier wit and formidable erudition. To the general public, he is best known for his satiric novel Fortress Besieged.\n\nThough he failed mathematics, Qian was accepted by Tsinghua University’s Department of Foreign Languages in 1929 based on his excellent performance in Chinese and English. At Tsinghua, Qian got a well rounded education. He came to know many prominent scholars who appreciated his talent and encouraged his creative efforts. He spent much time exploring the diverse book collection in Tsianghua’s large library. His explorations informed his writing and erudition throughout his career. He probably began his lifelong habit of collecting quotations and keeping detailed reading notes at this time. He also met his future wife Yang Jiang when they were students. She became a successful playwright and translator. They married in 1935.\n\nLater Qian received government sponsorship to further his studies abroad. Qian studied for two years at Exeter College where he received a B.Litt. Later he studied at the University of Paris for a year before returning to China in 1938. From 1949 to 1953, Qian was a Tsinghua University professor. While Guan Zhui Bian established his academic fame, his novel Fortress Besieged established his public reputation and fame. Fortress Besieged was reprinted in 1980 and once again became a best-seller. The novel was adapted as a TV serial in 1990.\n\nQian died on December 19, 1998 in Beijing. In accordance with their will, Yang Jiang donated funds from their estate to establish the Philobiblon Scholarship at Tsinghua University in 2001.\n\n(Photo by Guo Haijun)"
