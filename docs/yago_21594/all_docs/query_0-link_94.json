        "text": "Accomplished author, essayist and translator, Yang Jiang, a cultural icon known for her prolific output, as well as her unadorned, elegant prose, died today at age 104, state media said.\n\nYang was also noted for her marriage to an equally famous writer and scholar, who had figured in her writing.\n\nA notable literary figure in modern China, she was a well-known playwright who wrote a couple of comedies in Shanghai.\n\nThe graduate of Tsinghua University published her only novel, Baptism, in 1988 and later published a sequel at age 103.\n\nYang died at Peking Union Medical College Hospital in Beijing, according to The Paper, a state-owned news website. It said her death was confirmed by the People's Literature Publishing House.\n\nCiting different sources, Hong Kong station Phoenix TV also confirmed Yang's death.\n\nBorn in 1911, Yang became a household name in China for her writing – plays, essays and translated works. She was the first to translate “Don Quixote'' into Chinese, and her version is still considered the definitive one by many.\n\n(Pictured, Yang Jiang, seen with Jia Qinglin, the then chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 2011. Jia retired in 2012.)\n\nIn a 1981 collection of essays, Yang wrote with a sense of poignancy on the daily lives of Chinese intellectuals during the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, when scholars and intellectuals were forced to perform hard labor.\n\nHer 2003 essay collection “We Three,'' about her family life with her late husband and their daughter, was a best-seller. It was partly a memoir, chronicling death in her family.\n\nYang was married to Qian Zhongshu, best known for his novel “Fortress Besieged,'' and theirs was widely seen as a model union set against the background of China's turbulent 20th century.\n\nAfter Qian's death in 1998, Yang embarked on the task of compiling and editing her husband's unpublished works and remained prolific herself.—AP/The Standard"
