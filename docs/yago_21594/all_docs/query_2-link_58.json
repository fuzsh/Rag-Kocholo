        "text": "Although the Aesthetic Movement and its relation to the modern Chinese literature have long been discussed by many Chinese scholars, the topic of decadent aesthetics in modern Chinese fiction has been largely neglected. For example, in his monograph The Extremity of Beauty: A Study of the Decadent Aesthetics in Modern China (1997), professor Xie Zhixi combed through decadent aestheticism in modern Chinese literature across many genres, ranging from “belle lettres”Footnote 1 (美文) to poetry. However, he did not mention fiction or plays in his book. Xiao Tongqing, in his monograph The fin-de-siècle Culture and Modern Chinese Literature (2000) paid great attention to how the fin-de-siècle culture was spread to China and found its expression in poems, plays and fiction in the modern Chinese literature. Nevertheless, his analysis of fiction merely emphasizes on the literary themes such as the decline of modern Chinese culture without much elaboration on literary form. Zhou Xiaoyi’s treatise Aestheticism and the Consumerist Culture (2002) demonstrates the introduction of aestheticism to China and its relation to the consumerist culture without focusing too much on modern Chinese fiction. Xue Jiabao, in his treatise Aestheticism and Modern Chinese Literature (2015), provided very detailed analysis of the influence of aestheticism on modern Chinese fiction, plays and poetry. However, since the relationship between aestheticism and modern Chinese literature is too broad a topic, he did not dwell too much on the decadent aesthetics in modern Chinese fiction.\n\nThis paper aims to provide the readers with vivid examples and detailed analysis of how “decadent” aesthetics find expressions in fiction by Eileen Chang and Qian Zhongshu in occupied Shanghai during the War of Resistance against Japan (1937–1945). The main purpose of this article is to dig into the works of fiction by these two writers to examine the representations and variations of the aesthetics of “decadence.” Therefore, it is necessary to comb through the concepts of “decadence” and “style of decadence” before attempting to investigate into Chinese fiction in occupied Shanghai during the War of Resistance against Japan (1937–1945).\n\nWhether from the literary or philosophical perspective, the concept of “decadence” is as complex as that of “modernism” since it encompasses too many sub-concepts which have correlations to it. In a general sense, “decadence” refers to the very process of the declination of culture; at the same time, “decadence” is extremely complex and hard to accurately define because the word also signifies “artificiality, hypocrisy” or even “perversity.” (Reed 7) The decadent style, as a part of the Aesthetic Movement, had once become the most widely spread literary/cultural phenomenon that dominated the literary world after Romanticism. Moreover, the cultural impact of the “style of decadence” even reached to East Asia.\n\nFrom an etymological perspective, the word “decadence” bears conspicuous resemblance to the Latin word “decadentia,”Footnote 2 which first appeared in the middle ages with the connotations of “fall,””sink,” and “decay,” as opposed to “ascent,””upswing,” and “rise.” The concept of “decadence” also originates from the Western philosophy, and even religion. According to Matei Calinescu, the primitive idea of “decadence” is prior to the “style of decadence” and “decadentism,” since it can be found in Plato’s philosophy. He reckons Plato to be the “first great Western philosopher to build up a whole complex ontology on the idea of decadence.”(Calinescu 151) Calinescu’s stand is thought-provoking since it distills the essence out of Plato’s entire philosophical system. The concept of “decadence,” according to the ancient Greeks, refers to the inevitable procedure of degeneration and disintegration of everything in the universe as a consequence of natural evolution. The philosophy of Plato is infused with a deep conscious of “decadence,” in accordance with the decaying process in a physical sense. Both Plato and the ancient Greeks believe that the development of the human civilization is a continuing procedure of degeneration. Plato holds that everything in the universe is falling from a lofty “Idea” into the “shadow” of “Idea” in reality.\n\nThe Platonic theory of Ideas entails a presumption that should not be neglected: Everything has “an ideal archetype” to which the counterpart in the material world can be related in a metaphysical sense. Being projected into the material world, “Ideas” have been reduced to something secondary and inferior, like “shadows” on the wall in a cave, as indicated in Plato’s famous metaphor. From a Platonic perspective, art, usually treated as the “actualization of Ideas,” is obviously inferior to pure “Ideas” themselves. The artistic production inevitably involves the procedure of degeneration, which is what “decadence” actually means. The very process of “Ideas” being degenerated into something inferior also explains why Plato holds animosity toward other artistic forms such as poetry and painting. Plato’s negative attitude toward art can also be discerned through his famous proclamation that “imitative art is an inferior uniting with an inferior and breeding inferior offspring,” (Plato 477) which is, to some extent, a sort of “decadent” aesthetics. Although Calinescu does not quote Plato’s The Republic (Book X) to further elaborate on Plato’s “decadent aesthetics,” he does point out that the core of “decadence” lies in the unalterable faith in the world of Ideas, compared to which the material world immediately becomes imperfect and even squalid:\n\nFor the Platonic theory of Ideas clearly implies a metaphysical concept of Decadence (or degeneration) when it describes the relationship between those archetypal, perfect, unchanging, real models of all things and their mere ‘shadows’ in the sensible world of perceived objects, where everything is subject to the corrupting influence of time and change. Closer to our concern with historical decadence, Plato’s view of history and society summarizes the widespread Greek belief that time was nothing but a continuous decline. (Calinescu 152).\n\nThere is no doubt that Plato’s take on the world of Ideas and his “decadent aesthetics” has provided a new perspective through which we evaluate the world of objects. As a matter of fact, the concept of “decadence” not only involves the perception that everything declines throughout the passage of time; meanwhile, “decadence” is also deeply rooted in religion. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, the final Apocalypse also showcases the philosophy of “decadence.” Nevertheless, the concept of “decadence” can also be seen as a faithful ally to Marxism since it indicates that Communism could mean “the end of human alienation” by which the “dying culture of modern-day capitalism” (Calinescu 153) could be replaced and revitalized.\n\nCalinsecu’s study of “decadence” in the literary sense is multifaceted. He has combed through the variations of the concept according to their respective historical contexts. For instance, the adjective cum noun “decadent” did not come into being until the mid-nineteenth century, whereas “decadentism” had maintained its influence in the literary sphere from the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century, and reached its climax in the 1930s (Calinescu 212–213). Meanwhile, the style of “decadence” remains a tricky notion intertwined with Romanticism, a controversial literary school that many scholars in the West have studied upon.Footnote 3\n\nCalinescu’s detailed analysis on “decadence” and its relation to literary Modernism demonstrates the complexities and subtleties within the very concept. By combing through different interpretations of “decadence” that sometimes supplement or even contradict each other, a relatively comprehensive evaluation of the concept could be made, taking into account of its historical, social, and cultural contexts.\n\nDespite the negative aspects of the concept, the style of “decadence” remains dialectical and sophisticated, under the influence of which, the literature and art thrived with the strong affirmation of the power of imagination and originality. The recalcitrant poets and artists, who despised dogmatism of any kind, proclaimed their advocacy of “art for art’s sake” through their iconoclastic literary experience. It is noteworthy that the concept of “decadence” is so complicated that it even leads to the cult toward “artificiality” or “hypocrisy,” which has been vehemently criticized by thinkers and philosophers such as Nisard and Nietzsche. Only through the frameworks of philosophy, religion, and other literary concepts such as Symbolism or Romanticism, can we carry out a relatively thorough investigation of the concepts of “decadence,” and “the style of decadence,” whose ambiguities and complexities shall be heeded.\n\nAs is above-mentioned, the style of “decadence” refers to a distinctive artistic style that involves the profusion of details, the delicacy of language, and the elevation of unbridled imagination, even to the detriment of reason. The decadent aesthetes who espoused the slogan “art for art’s sake” were infatuated with a flamboyant style of language and embraced the free expression of their unique temperaments. Moreover, the aesthetical principles of the decadent aesthetes also generated tremendous impact on their attitudes toward life. The lifestyles of Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Gabriele d’Annunzio were also immensely rooted in a sort of “decadent” aesthetics in which the artists craved for an extremely ego-centered, even degenerative way of living. Since the decadent aesthetes reckoned that life imitates art, they were often regarded as recalcitrant, narcissistic and even morbid. Nevertheless, their extraordinary power of imagination and stupendous artistic talents were also beyond doubt.\n\nNow that we have a relatively comprehensive understanding of the evolution and variations of the concepts of “decadence,” these questions arise: How do studies on “decadence” boost people’s understanding on Modernism? Was the decadent style only found in literary works on the European continent, or was it an international literary event that had already spread its influence to East Asia? What is the relation between the style of “decadence” and the social background of the War of Resistance against Japan (1937–1945)?\n\nActually, Chinese New Sensational School, which is reckoned as the first Modernist literary school throughout the history of the modern Chinese literature (Yan 125), is directly inspired by the literary style of “decadence.” When Sigmund Freud’s theories of psycho-analysis were quite popular among the literary sphere from the end of the 1920s to the early 1930s in Shanghai, writers that belonged to the Chinese New Sensational School (“中国新感觉派”) such as Shi Zhecun (施蛰存1905–2003), Liu Na’ou (刘纳鸥1905–1940), and Mu Shiying (穆时英1912–1940) also strived to reinvigorate fiction writing by depicting the enigmatic, even uncanny psychological experience of the protagonists. Their literary style was, to a large extent, inspired and influenced by the French decadent artists, which has already been pointed out by the Chinese scholar Li Jin (李今) in her studies of the “Haipai” culture.Footnote 4\n\nAnother Chinese scholar Xie Zhixi (解志熙) has also made a relatively thorough investigation of the Chinese decadent aesthetics in his treatise The Extremity of Beauty: A Study of the Decadent Aesthetics in Modern China in which he points out that, “The literary impact of the decadent aesthetics introduced from the West and Japan …had obtained an unprecedented immensity and profundity at the end of the 1920s to the early beginning of the 1930s in China.”(Xie 58) Xie has also noticed the introduction of Oscar Wilde (1854–1900), and other decadent artists such as Aubrey Beardsley (1872–1898), Arthur Symons (1865–1945), Ernest Dawson (1867–1900) and George Morre (1852–1933) to China by modern Chinese artists and writers.Footnote 5\n\nBoth of their studies showcase that the decadent aesthetics had already become an international rather than regional literary phenomenon from the 1920s to the 1930s in Mainland China. The wide circulation and frequent introduction of literary works by Western decadent aesthetes such as Oscar Wilde to the Chinese literary sphere testifies to the fact that the style of “decadence” had almost become the synonym of “Modernism,” which was the most influential literary trend then in China. The birth of the Chinese New Sensational School also reflects the adoption of the writing techniques of Western Modernism in Chinese fiction writing, which focuses on psychological realities based on Freud’s theories of psycho-analysis.\n\nThe distinctive cultural–political atmosphere in occupied Shanghai during the War of Resistance against Japan served as an ideal backdrop for the development of the style of “decadence” in works of fiction, in which there was a conspicuous and recurrent pattern implying that the conflict between the lofty ideals and the undesirable realities remained irreconcilable. Even worse than that, the ideals were doomed to eventually disintegrate and be trampled on when confronting with harsh realities in time of the war. This sort of inevitable ending permeates fiction in occupied Shanghai, in which the writers had mercilessly designed disillusionment big or small to descend upon the major characters, causing all their expectations to shatter, all their anticipations to evaporate in face of their irrevocably deteriorating circumstances. Meanwhile, by portraying the cruel procedure of disenchantment, the writers had enabled the protagonists to regain some sort of revelations in one way or another, thus adding a touch of didacticism to their works of fiction. Whether these crumbling ideals were related to the longing for love and affection toward other individuals, or to self-realization in a broader sense, they all ended up in bitter failures. Upon the background of the War of Resistance against Japan, any sort of spiritual pursuits turned out to be futile struggles. Therefore, works of fiction in occupied Shanghai were often tinged with sentimentalism and even nihilism.\n\nAmong the writers in occupied Shanghai, Eileen Chang was the most typical one who consciously infused a style of “decadence” into her fiction writing. The pervading sense of desolation and solitude mingled with anxieties looming in one’s subconscious that implicate the doomed tragic ending of the protagonists makes Chang’s fiction essentially in accordance with the aesthetical principles of the decadent artists. The author did not anticipate any savior to appear in her stories, nor did she reckon that the courses of her characters’ lives could be altered. The abundant allusions in Chang’s fiction imply that individual fate is, to a large extent, preordained before one has been born, which is inescapable, no matter how hard one struggles throughout his life. This kind of determinist attitude reveals the acceptance of the decadent aesthetics by the author. In most of Chang’s fiction written in occupied Shanghai, the decaying procedure of the spiritual life lurks behind the prosperity of the material life. The binary oppositions such as material-spirit, body-soul, convention-modernity, China-the West that usually contradicts one another lies at the center of Chang’s fiction. Although many scholars have pointed out that Chang was totally indifferent to grand historical narratives, and seldom weaved any historical sense into her works, which were closely related to mundane quotidian life, it is noteworthy that the trivial daily episodes and the abominable characters constitute a typical style of “decadence” due to the historical background of the War of Resistance against Japan. In other words, the decadent aesthetics in her fiction has been intensified by the war. Meanwhile, the acute perception and accurate depiction of human frailties has elevated Chang’s fiction to a higher level which transcends the historical background on which they were based, thus making them all-time classics in the history of modern Chinese literature.\n\nThe fiction of Eileen Chang manifests the disintegration of family values, the disenchantment with love as well as the deteriorating sense of morality within people. In this sense, Chang stands firmly with Plato in that she also holds an entirely pessimistic viewpoint with regard to human civilization. Besides, as pointed out by C.T. Hsia,Footnote 6 Chang’s works of fiction demonstrate a relatively high set of moral standards since she was an idealist deep down in her heart.\n\nMany of Chang’s works represent the style of “decadence,” among which Love in a Fallen City (1943) stands as one of the most typical. The title of the novella is in itself ironic, since the author had revitalized the literary cliché of “earth-shattering beauty”(“倾国倾城”) in the classical Chinese literature, ascribing a brand-new connotation to the obsolete tales of love. In traditional Chinese fiction, attractive women were usually regarded as troublemakers whose beauty only brought misfortune and ordeal to their country. Since the beauty of the country would necessarily provoke the outbreak of wars, the futile sacrifice of millions of people’s lives lay behind the love story between the hero and his beauty. Quite interestingly, in Eileen Chang’s Love in a Fallen City, the plot design had been reversed and rearranged. The war had strengthened the tenuous bond between the two protagonists and directly caused their marriage. There are tons of stories about love being the cause of war throughout the history of Chinese and Western literature, whereas Chang decided to write one in which the war is the very cause of love. Chang’s deliberate reversal of the conventional plot design can be interpreted as a sort of parody in which she projected all her bitter sarcasm toward human frailties. The novella recounts an unconventional love story in time of the war. The heroine, Bai Liusu, a 29-year-old fair lady from a declining upper class family in feudal society of old Shanghai, shares a rocky and dramatic relationship with Fan Liuyuan, the son of a Chinese expatriate who has just finished his studies from the UK. The male and female protagonists both distrust each other from the beginning of their encounters, but gradually open up their hearts through several rounds of tentative flirtation. The War of Resistance against Japan has unexpectedly catalyzed their dubious and unstable relationship into marriage. The novella is pervaded with a horrifying sense of the doomsday, in which the theme of love is overshadowed by the theme of death, threatened by which, everything turns out to be futile and worthless.\n\nThe image of the “wall” remains one of the most interesting details in the novella that relates to the theme of death. Once Bai Liusu and Fan Liuyuan stroll on the streets to the side of a wall, which is depicted in the following sentences:\n\nThe wall was cool and rough, the color of death. Pressed against the wall, her face bloomed with the opposite hues: red lips, shining eyes—a face of flesh and blood, alive with thought and feeling. (Chang 139)\n\nEileen Chang deliberately delineated the wall as something decadent, emanating the odor of death, only to serve as a sharp contrast to the everlasting vivacity and untainted beauty of Bai Liusu, who seems attractive to Fan Liuyuan from the very beginning. Therefore, Fan confesses to Bai his feelings (though immature) for her with the hint of the wall:\n\n…but this wall makes me think of the old sayings about the end of the world. Someday, when human civilization has been completely destroyed, when everything is burned, burst, utterly collapsed and ruined, maybe this wall will still be here. If, at that time, we can meet at this wall, then maybe, Liusu, you will honestly care about me, and I will honestly care about you. (Chang, 139)\n\nThe tentative confession of Fan Liuyuan reflects his meticulous and sophisticated personality. Since even in the scheme of love, he does not allow himself to be tricked by Bai Liusu’s designs upon him (he later comments acerbically that Bai considers marriage to be “long-term prostitution.”) Fan’s love for Bai has always been conditional, restricted to certain premises. The character Fan Liuyuan in Love in a Fallen City is an ego-centered womanizer who never truly respects women. Eileen Chang adopted a sarcastic tone to depict his selfishness and ego-centrism through his words—“I don’t understand myself—but I want you to understand me!”(Chang 140) Fan Liuyuan’s arrogant attitude toward Bai Liusu indicates the impatience and reluctance to truly know her as a person. The image of the wall not only symbolizes the atmosphere of death lurking in the air, but also alludes to the cultural barrier and a deep sense of insecurity between the couple. However, there is an abrupt twist within the novella that turns everything upside down. Fan Liuyuan has been transformed to a responsible husband from a playful dandy as he usually is, thanks to the outbreak of the war, which is fairly ironic. There is plenty amount of sarcasm and irony in Eileen Chang’s fiction, among which Love in a Fallen City is one of the most peculiar.\n\nEileen Chang established a unique and dynamic relationship between love and war through the confession of Fan Liuyuan. Chang’s fiction illuminates the readers with the fact that love thrives when human civilization is under unprecedented threat during war-time, making people crave for intimacy and security at all costs. The incredible influence of war on love gradually manifests itself as the story unfolds, and the latter part of the novella attests to what Fan Liuyuan has declared earlier to Bai Liusu that he would genuinely care about her and sincerely fall in love with her, given that “human civilization has been completely destroyed.”(Chang 139) With the bombs landing in Hong Kong all of a sudden, the protagonists eventually realize that it’s time to wear their hearts on their sleeves and begin to trust each other since the war has destroyed the old familiar world they once belong to. The wall of distrust begins to crumble in face of the war, which intends to obliterate everything and turns love and marriage into a necessity, into something they should hold fast to no matter what happens. This kind of ironic depiction of love and marriage reflects the pervading aesthetics of “decadence” in Eileen Chang’s fiction, in which everything good comes to an end. What lies at the center of the concept of “decadence” is the strong belief that everything is prone to degradation and degeneration, and its eventual demise. At the end of the story, Bai Liusu is left alone at home. Feeling anxious and empty, she cannot fend off the mounting agitations that the war has imposed on her. Although there are many uncertainties about her future with Fan Liuyuan, Bai Liusu is still determined to hold on to this marriage despite anything, which is depicted in the following paragraph:\n\nHere in this uncertain world, money, property, the permanent things—they’re all unreliable. The only thing she could rely on was the breath in her lungs, and this person who lay sleeping beside her. Suddenly, she crawled over to him, hugging him through his quilt. He reached out from the bedding and grasped her hand. They looked and saw each other, saw each other entirely. It was a mere moment of deep understanding, but it was enough to keep them happy together for a decade or so. (Chang 164)\n\nEileen Chang suggested in the novella with irony that the marriage between Bai Liusu and Fan Liuyuan is, to a large extent, absurd and groundless, doomed to collapse. The aesthetics of “decadence” collaborates with the psychological experience of Bai Liusu, for an epiphany suddenly dawns on her in the latter part of the novella: Since everything declines and ends up in decay, why not hold on to something simple and worldly such as marriage? The reversal of the stereotypical relationship between love and war is actually a kind of fortune bestowed upon Bai Liusu, who can only escape from her declining family full of abominable snobs and start her life afresh in somewhere far away. Eileen Chang deliberately put an end to the novella with a sarcastic remark:” Hong Kong’s defeat had brought Liusu victory. But in this unreasonable world, who can distinguish cause from effect? Who knows which is which? Did a great city fall so that she could be vindicated?”(Chang 167) The questions posed by Eileen Chang implicate that love does not necessarily leads to war, as is often conveyed in conventional tales of love. And contrary-wise, love thrives during war-time, when human existence is stripped to its barest essentials. The novella also infers a subtext that there is a paradox within the relationship between love and war, for the kind of love and marriage galvanized by war could turn out to be fragile and unreliable in a peaceful era, and is prone to disintegrate sooner or later.\n\nEileen Chang’s Love in a Fallen City is a parody of conventional love stories in which the War of Resistance against Japan propels the marriage between Bai Liusu and Fan Liuyuan. The kind of love between the male and female protagonists also resembles a sort of game or a gender war. There is no true love in the story between Bai and Fan, since the couple’s marriage is merely based on their mutual loneliness and financial insecurity. Ironically, Eileen Chang deliberately designed a seemingly happy ending for them with a hint at the end of the story that their marriage is unstable and doomed to collapse sooner or later:\n\nThose legendary beauties who felled cities and kingdoms were probably all like that. Legends exist everywhere, but they don’t necessarily have such happy endings. When the huqin wails on a night of ten thousand lamps, the bow slides back and forth, drawing forth a tale too desolate for words—oh! Why go into it? (Chang 167)\n\nThe depiction of the environment around the couple also manifests a kind of desolate atmosphere:”They walked into town together. Where the road took a sharp turn, the land suddenly fell away—in front of them was only empty space, a damp, pale gray sky.” (Chang 166) The feelings of loneliness and desolation actually permeate the story, which demonstrate the decadent aesthetics: everything in this world is prone to its eventual decline and disintegration, no matter how perfect it seems. Eileen Chang implies in the story that when marriage becomes a substitute for financial security without any spiritual connection between the couple, it is on the verge of failure and total collapse. The final sentence “…drawing forth a tale too desolate for words—oh! Why go into it?” reminds the readers of the fact that the story between Bai Liusu and Fan Liuyuan is only a parody of love, without real devotion, devoid of any deep meaning, and is full of crisis.\n\nThe aesthetics of “decadence” is not only manifested in Love in a Fallen City, but is also a pervading style in other fiction by Eileen Chang, such as The Golden Cangue, Aloeswood Incense: the First Brazier, Aloeswood Incense: the Second Brazier, Jasmine Tea, etc. Most of Eileen Chang’s fictional works written in occupied Shanghai vividly demonstrate the declination and disintegration of old feudal families in upper-class society, and the disillusionment and disenchantment with love between the family members. Cao Qiqiao, the protagonist in The Golden Cangue, suffers from chronic dissatisfaction both physically and mentally. Having destroyed the love of her daughter, she finally became an obnoxious, demented woman in the attic; Ni Xi, the anti-heroine in Serial Link (《连环套》), is also mentally damaged and morally corrupted although she gets richer as the story unfolds; Nie Chuanqing, whose seemingly happy family in Jasmine Tea is haunted by a distant and tragic love story that racks his brain and lures him into the abyss of hysteria and lunacy; Ge Weilong, the heroine in Aloeswood Incense: the First Brazier has been turned into a social butterfly after several triumphant encounters with men in upper-class society of Hong Kong and cannot resist her fate of becoming a plaything of a womanizer at the end of the story; Madame Michelle in Aloeswood Incense: the Second Brazier, with her extreme possessiveness, has successfully destroyed her daughter’s marriage and has driven Roger, the husband of Susie, to his suicide. These works are imbued with the aesthetics of “decadence” with the allusion that the mental development and spiritual growth of human beings can only deteriorate under certain circumstances. Eileen Chang had achieved her goal of criticizing the existing social structures and ethical principles through her faithful portrayal of morbid humanities in her characters. What distinguishes Eileen Chang from other writers in occupied Shanghai during the war is her harsh criticism toward and downright skepticism about the social norms that people had adhered to in major urban cities like Shanghai and Hong Kong. It is also interesting to notice that almost every character in her fiction written in occupied Shanghai is mentally distorted, snobbish and squalid, which reflects her immense pessimism and even despair toward Chinese society during social transition. Eileen Chang reveled in capturing the negative side of humanity, excelled at depicting the morbid psychological experience of her characters through her delicate portrayal of mundane urban life, with a hint that such kind of tragic daily episodes are prevalent in society and the misfortune thrust upon her characters would haunt them unceasingly.\n\nEileen Chang’s fiction also demonstrates a conspicuous predilection for irony and cynicism, in which there is no true love and fulfilled anticipations but an overwhelming sense of disappointment toward others and a heavy degree of self-loathing, suffused with a strong impulse for escape. The “decadent” style of Eileen Chang’s fiction indirectly explains her departure from her hometown Shanghai and her final settlement in the USA, where she expanded her life-long career as a writer but continued to rewrite the old “nightmares” that she had written in occupied Shanghai. Eileen Chang had never truly let go of her strong disapproval of her family and the social atmosphere in the prime of her writing career, through which she unconsciously projected her disappointment and hatred. The outburst of negative feelings in her fiction is also an external representation of the aesthetics of “decadence.” As is pointed out by Nietzsche, “decadence” is the psychological expression of a personal will which belongs to every nation and every time. (Nietzsche 25–26) By focusing on the recurrent theme of the gradual disintegration of a big family in upper-class society and the distortion of humanity within it, Eileen Chang had created a unique style of “decadence” that attests to Nietzsche’s definition of the concept.\n\nNevertheless, Eileen Chang’s expression of the aesthetics of “decadence” not only reveals the characteristics of literary Modernism, but also reflects a deep-rooted personal taste for the literature. Having been profoundly influenced by classical Chinese fiction like Dreams in a Red Chamber (红楼梦) and The Plum in a Golden Vase (金瓶梅), Eileen Chang knew too well how to blend the aesthetics of “decadence” into the historical background of the War of Resistance against Japan. Eileen Chang remains one of the few writers throughout the history of modern Chinese literature whose works serve as paradigm of literary Modernity in successful combination with literary Realism, thanks to her astute perception of modern Chinese families.\n\nAs to Eileen Chang, morbid humanity, along with passive gestures of resistance can be found in her fiction writing. Eileen Chang’s fiction depicts the lives of ordinary people in occupied Shanghai without focusing too much on grand political issues like her contemporaries, such as Mao Dun (1896–1981), Lu Xun (1881–1936) or Ba Jin (1904–2005). The detachment from politics is a kind of passive resistance, and further proves that Eileen Chang was more of a modernist writer whose works of fiction demonstrate decadent aesthetics rather than literary Realism.\n\nQian Zhongshu’s works of fiction manifest a decadent style in terms of literary themes about the degradation of humanity, the decline of idealism, and the deterioration of personal relationships, especially romance and marriage. As to Qian Zhongshu, the themes of the eventual demise of false hopes and the futility of struggles are more evident than in Eileen Chang’s fiction. Unlike Eileen Chang who spent a lot of effort on delineating the lives of ordinary people in big families during social transition, Qian Zhongshu’s works of fiction usually demonstrate the psychological status of the intellectuals in modern China. Qian was also uninterested in broad political narratives like Chang was, and he was renowned for his brilliant perception and delicate depiction of the deep-rooted weaknesses of human beings.\n\nMoreover, Qian Zhongshu (1910–1998) adopted the rhetorical device of oxymoron to depict the ambivalence and conflicts within characters and events, aiming to demonstrate the dialectics of things that are seemingly at odds with each other. He frequently used irony to mock his characters or criticize the social system in occupied Shanghai. Qian Zhongshu excelled at providing a God-like vision to expose the tragic flaws on his characters.\n\nThe novella collection Humans, Beasts and Ghosts (1946)Footnote 7 contains four stories: “God’s Dream,” “Cat,” “Inspiration” and “Souvenir.” These four novellas were all written by Qian Zhongshu in occupied Shanghai. The four pieces share certain similarities despite their differences. Cruel sarcasm and caricatures of the flaws and frailties on Chinese intellectuals are almost everywhere in these stories. Actually Qian held no particular grudges against writers, intellectuals or socialites. He was simply more drawn to the psychological world of human beings than to broad social issues.\n\nThe personification of God in “God’s Dream” is a very successful attempt. The author had actually demoted and degraded God to expose his true colors. At the beginning of the story, Qian revealed the setting of “God’s Dream”:\n\nWhen the power of evolution is great enough to create a God after thousands of years, human beings are already extinct, maybe this is because although they evolved together, they no longer slept together. Even the evolutionists couldn’t wait anymore. Therefore, the material world is very hollow and empty, just like a fool’s brain which has been magnified numerous times. (Qian 2002:2)\n\n“God” in “God’s Dream” is a dictator who rules the world, quite different from the authentic God in the Bible who has mercy and affection toward people. To make it worse, he inherits all the flaws on human beings, such as the propensity to abuse their power, and a ridiculous amount of vanity. Qian adopted irony to briefly outline the personalities of “God”:\n\nGod has the temperaments of human beings, therefore he likes to abuse power. He’d like to dispel all the darkness away to see if it listens to his command. Alas! As is expected, the sun comes out, and turns from grey to white, then from white to red. God is very happy since he reckons the sun listens to his command. He closes his sun-shot eyes and thinks: ”The sun is so mighty that I don’t want it for the moment.” Quite strangely, everything before his eyes vanished in a second, leaving a darkness tinged in red. Now God is assured about his own powers and abilities, and no longer doubts himself anymore. Since he can dispel brightness by closing his eyes, then brightness must have come from his own eyes…(3)\n\nThe above quotation of the novella manifests that God is of a self-indulgent and self-righteous character. Qian’s depiction of “God” is apparently derogative, effusing deep contempt toward this God who wants so much to be adored and worshiped that he then creates a man and a woman to keep him company. The man and woman are soon tired of each other, therefore the woman comes to God and implores him to recreate a man who “does not look exactly the same as him, but is more subtle and more handsome.”(7) God is very angry since he has seen through the greed and infidelity of the woman and has refused her immediately. Meanwhile, God threatens that he might as well punish her by destroying the man he has created. Ironically, the man has made the same request as the woman, and God has also refused him in the same way. God considers himself to be greater and more powerful now:\n\nGod sighs and wonders why human beings are so weak, and then a second thought comes to his mind: these two people are so equally and symmetrically bad, just like two lines of rhythmical prose or a line of metrical poem. God is so proud of his delicacy of creating human beings. Therefore, God feels justified and contented. (12)\n\nQian Zhongshu mocked God’s refusal to admit his limitations as a Creator and scorned his cowardice of finding solace in deceiving himself. Gradually, God feels more and more estranged from his creatures because of his disapproval of their requests. Eventually, God has decided to send ordeals to them in order to make them eulogize his power and worship him again. It is a pity that God has disappointed himself this time since the man and woman cannot ask for his help again. Instead, they have died of illness due to the invasion of lice, flies and microinsects. Ironically, they have even died together like a martyred couple. God suddenly realizes how lonely he would be since he has just lost a lovely couple who used to compliment him every single day and keep him company. The ending of the story is quite sardonic and surprising at the same time, since God has finally woke up to find what he has seen to be nothing but a dream:\n\nWhat happened before is nothing but a dream. I rule everything and always do whatever I like. However, dreams have extraterritorial jurisdiction and are not under my control, which make me so angry! Nevertheless, aren’t these dreams predictions about my future? The business of creating human beings to keep me company should be reconsidered. I am immortal, but what about the endless time to spare? How to dispel my loneliness? God thus stretches himself, giving a long sigh to the dying sunset and the listless world, then opens his mouth and yawns with boredom, as if to swallow the boundless and lingering time. (16)\n\nGod feels so frustrated since he has discovered that he cannot control his own dreams despite the fact that he is the omnipotent and omniscient ruler of everything in the world. The ending of the story alludes that God is actually not that almighty and great as he thinks he is, therefore, his vanity and stupidity has been mocked by the author throughout the story. Besides, the eventual demise of the couple suggests decadent aesthetics: since nothing gold can stay, the struggles of human beings turn out to be futile and meaningless, just like a dream that God has woken up from.\n\n“God’s Dream” is full of situational irony, which usually creates a huge chasm between the characters’ expected outcomes and the real conditions they encounter. Lars Elleström has given a precise definition about “situational irony”: “Situational irony, sometimes called irony of events, is most broadly defined as a situation where the outcome is incongruous with what was expected, but it is also more generally understood as a situation that includes contradictions or sharp contrasts…An example would be a man who takes a step aside in order to avoid getting sprinkled by a wet dog, and falls into a swimming pool.”(Elleström 2002: 51) “God” in the story “God’s Dream” also encounters the same ironic situation: he longs to be adored and worshipped by his creatures, but finally ends up being alone. The tragic flaws on this God are his self-indulgence and pompous character, which make him unable either to face the reality, or to take sensible actions to meet his demands. Therefore, he cannot obtain what he has been craving for. Although he eventually realizes that everything that has happened is nothing but a dream, even his dream reflects his stupidity and incompetence.\n\n“God’s Dream” is actually a parody of the Genesis in the Bible. Parody is often understood as an imitation of the style of a particular writer, artist, or genre with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect. As the critic Linda Hutcheon asserts–”Parody—often called ironic quotation, pastiche, appropriation, or intertextuality—is usually considered central to postmodernism, both by its detractors and its defenders.”(Hutcheon 2000: 93) After reading “God’s Dream,” the readers cannot help but laugh at this self-indulgent, jealous and pompous God. Qian’s reinvention of the Genesis is very impressive since he questioned the legitimacy of authority by delving into the psychological reality of this seemingly almighty God.\n\nIn “God’s Dream,” the author recurrently mocked and scorned God to expose his human frailties, such as pride, vanity and narrow-mindedness. This “God” apparently does not have any divine virtues like self-sacrifice or mercy, instead, he is self-delusional and egoistic. In Qian’s story, God is the typical embodiment of human vices, which serves as an insinuation of those people inflated with ambitions to surpass all the sentient beings in the world. The author successfully captured the vanity and stupidity in hypocrites, as is shown in this narcissistic God in the story. Despite the frequent use of irony and parody, the author also adopted oxymoron to convey sarcasm and contempt toward this God:\n\nHe is not God but a despicable demon. God is a merciful demon who gives people something to eat; while a demon is also God with evil intentions, who kills people for beasts to eat. God and demon are not binary oppositions, but two sides of the same thing, two names for the same person, like bandits for heroes, lovers for rivals. (14)\n\nIn conclusion, “God’s Dream” is a modern allegory and a parody of the Genesis in the Bible. The theme of the story has been intensified by rhetorical devices such as irony and oxymoron. “God’s dream” is thought-provoking and hilarious at the same time, imbued with dark humor.\n\nThe novella “Cat” involves the female protagonist AmourFootnote 8 and her distinguished friends ranging from politicians to writers, from scientists to directors of academic institutions. They are all swept off their feet by the charm of Amour and enjoy ingratiating her at the house parties she throws regularly. Amour’s friends overtly flirt with her despite the fact that she is the wife of Li Jianhou, a college professor, who often gets on his nerves by Amour’s ego-centric behaviors. “Cat” is a satire that depicts the mindsets of modern Chinese intellectuals during the War of Resistance against Japan. The author constantly mocked Li Jianhou in the story by making him a henpecked and cowardly character. Besides, his fellow intellectuals, even his young lover are also fowls to his stupidity. Qian Zhongshu endeavored to capture a group image of the Chinese intellectual circles in the republican period. The author’s sarcasm was mainly targeted at Li Jianhou and Amour, whose vanity and foolishness greatly astonish the readers. All the intellectuals in the story are dilettantes who enjoy delivering strange and empty remarks about politics, art and life to flash their intelligence and insights. They are dying to be adored and respected, just like Amour and Li Jianhou. The author’s contempt toward Amour and her husband unfolds in the following paragraph:\n\nAlthough she talks very often, her words are simple. She just nods her head, laughs and inserts a remark, then talks to another person. She is not good at showing off her talents, but loves to manipulate her friends, like a magician who is able to throw or pick up, and take care of seven or eight dishes in the air at the same time. Yi-gu privately wonders why all her friends are celebrities around forty years old. He does not know the only reason these people are coming to Mrs. Li’s parties is to seek an economic and safe romantic relationship that is free of charge and won’t be accused, just like having a spiritual vacation to avoid their families. (38)\n\nMrs. Li's nature of being sociable and vain was described by the author as a clown's trick of throwing dishes. This kind of humorous sarcasm is a common characteristic of Qian Zhongshu’s works of fiction. The above paragraph discloses that the real intention of these intellectuals is to obtain a safe romantic relationship with her without being accused by their wives. Since Mrs. Li is possessive, manipulative and insatiable, she also enjoys flirting with those people on these house parties. Qian Zhongshu scorned Amour and remarked, “A westernized wife not only disobeys her husband, but it's not enough for her husband to serve her alone. “(21) In fact, it is only a safe and effortless habit for Amour to hold parties at home to fill her boring and empty life. Li Jianhou is another main character the author mocked and despised. Being vain and superficial, Li Jianhou and Amour makes a perfect match. In order to brag about his erudition, Li Jianhou has hired a university student named Qi Yi-gu to write a travelogue about his living experience in the western countries for him:\n\nAfter two and a half day’s work, Yi-gu no longer respects Jianhou anymore. The prejudice of a young man makes him deeply despises him. He has seen through the banality, vanity and insensibility on him, and has ignored his hospitality. He should have appreciated the generosity of Jianhou to hire him to engage in such petty business with so high salaries, however, now he only hates that he is so rich to waste a young man’s time and energy to write such meaningless nonsense for him. When he looks at the drafts with scratches by the cat, he can only hold his temper to write again. Maybe DarkieFootnote 9 is a bold and insightful critic whose behavior of destroying the relics in the house suggests his most effective and thorny criticism against this piece of crap? Yi-gu laughs bitterly when these thoughts come to his mind. (26–28)\n\nThe above paragraph is full of sarcasm, especially in the last sentence: Amour’s cat Darkie destroys the manuscripts written by Yi-gu. Darkie’s behavior implies Li Jianhou's superficial self-confidence and his vulgar nature that he tries so much to hide, which Qi Yi-gu really despises. At the end of the story, since Li Jianhou cannot lift his head in front of Amour, he has found a lover around 18 years old. A friend of Li Jianhou named Chen Xiajun tells Amour about his infidelity, which has tremendously irritated her. Therefore, she cultivates Qi Yi-gu to confess his love for her to restore her trampled self-esteem. Unexpectedly, Yi-gu has provoked her by his timidity, and her secret wish has finally failed. In the last two paragraphs of this lengthy novella, the author depicted the respective psychological activities of Li Jianhou and Amour, which intensified the pervading sarcasm in it.\n\nAt the end of the novella, Li Jianhou’s heart is filled with regrets but his young lover knows nothing about this at all. Nor does she know anything about the reason behind his infidelity. The author suggests that Amour’s vanity is the very cause of his betrayal. Quite ironically, the young lover is looking toward her future with great anticipations when she sits in the train with Li Jianhou. This anticlimactic ending implies that Amour’s superficially fancy life has been entirely ruined by Jianhou’s infidelity, which has greatly trampled her self-esteem, and hit her emotional needs. Generally speaking, the anticlimactic ending is often combined with the tone of irony, with a function to increase the absurd and dramatic atmosphere of the fiction. The author tirelessly captured and subtly delved into the psychological motivations behind their behaviors and paid great attention to the inevitable consequences of their actions. The ironic plot and the anticlimactic ending have strengthened the satirical effects of the novella. By mocking and making fun of his characters, Qian Zhongshu implicated the theme of the novella: people cannot always live in a false illusion. Self-righteous and petty shrewdness cannot defeat the mighty power of reality after all, and the greatest stupidity of man lies in deceiving himself and others. From this perspective, the real theme of the novella “Cat” is not to criticize the social reality during wartime, but to reveal the author’s own views about life and demonstrate his deep understanding and grasp on human nature by exposing his characters’ frailties, smugness and stupidity. The anticlimactic ending also contains decadent aesthetics: both Li Jianhou and Amour have to accept the cruel reality that their marriage is doomed to failure. Everything in the story is devoid of depth and meaning, prone to disintegrate, including the random remarks the guests make at the parties. The feelings of absurdity and desolation permeate the story, which manifests a decadent style.\n\nIn another short story entitled “Inspiration,” Qian Zhongshu delineated an awful novelist waiting for his inspirations to come. Unexpectedly, the novelist’s characters have suddenly resurrected to accuse him of his lame and awkward depictions. They no longer wish to live inside his works of fiction at all, and all they need now is to seek revenge against him by taking his life. The author once again adopted the rhetorical devices of irony and oxymoron. For instance, Qian asserted that “Chance is nothing but varnished or masked inevitability.”(80) At the end of the story, the novelist’s wretched soul gets into the ears of his landlord’s daughter, thus impregnating her. Although he could never write works of fiction again, he could instead write daily accounts of his father-in-law’s grocery store. The surrealistic ending contains the author’s deep sarcasm and contempt toward the novelist. “Inspiration” is by no means the best story in Humans, Beasts and Ghosts, since the author too frequently used irony,Footnote 10 and his emotions were too direct and emphatic, sometimes including personal attacks. Besides, the plot design is too dramatic that it impairs its artistic value. Despite its minor flaws, the bold and gothic surrealism at the end of the story is still very impressive. It is interesting to notice that the story also suggests the futility of the protagonist’s artistic endeavors: No matter how hard he tries, his characters are always dull and lifeless, ready to seek revenge upon the poor writer.\n\nThe last story entitled “Souvenir” in Humans, Beasts and Ghosts is the most mature and successful one. “Souvenir” is a tale about the deterioration of marriage and the degradation of moral sense. The author attempted to manifest the absurdity of life and the futility of hope. The literary style of “Souvenir” is quite lyrical and melancholic, but the underlying sarcasm still permeates the story. The novella is imbued with subtle and detailed psychological analysis with a gradually proceeding plot. The story is about an extramarital affair between the female protagonist Manqian and her lover Tianjian. The author successfully captured the subtle and ambivalent emotions of Manqian before and after the affair. The female protagonist Manqian is married to Caishu, the son of her father’s old friend. Caishu has attracted Manqian by his straightforward and simple character at the beginning, but later on the insipid family life has drained away all her passions. Therefore, she cannot resist the temptation of Caishu’s cousin Tianjian and involves in an affair with him. Quite ironically, Tianjian has died of an air crash in the end, but Manjian feels nothing about it and is even secretly glad that her husband hasn’t found out the affair between them, therefore they can live a normal life as before. The author’s depiction of “hope” is very noteworthy since it implies the insatiable desires in human nature.\n\nQian Zhongshu depicted the intricate changes of Manqian’s psychological world with precision and details and adopted oxymoron to imply her mood swings between hope and despair: “Her despair is hope which wears a mask.”(112) Qian Zhongshu acutely discerned the dialectics between hope and despair. The frequent use of oxymoron also suggests a dialectics between apparently contradictory things. The hope before the affair has finally turned into disappointment and despair in the end. In this way, this feeling of disillusionment turns into a great irony of her previous hope.\n\nThe ironic plot design in “Souvenir” suggests the absurdity of life. The death of Tianjian brings relief and comfort to Manqian rather than pure sorrow. She finally manages to pretend as if nothing has happened to get rid of the condemnation of her conscience. The title of the story “Souvenir” is also very ironic. Caishu is so pathetically foolish that he wants to name his child after “Tianjian” to memorize his deceased cousin. Manqian, of course, panics at her husband’s stupid idea and has refused the name, but Caishu still loves his wife dearly: “Caishu looks at his wife’s slim shape from behind, his eyes filled with infinite tenderness and affection.” (121) The ending of the story includes dramatic irony, a literary device used when the audience is more aware of what is happening than a character.\n\nThe critic Ted Huters points out the limitations of Qian Zhongshu’s literary creation in his doctoral dissertation: “Traditional Innovation: Qian Zhongshu and Modern Chinese Letters”:\n\nIn sum, while many of the purely discursive elements of Qian's critical essay style are successfully transformed into techniques that are fitted to fictional representation, they have not come all the way. He is not able to wholly immerse his thematic concerns into the actions and personalities of the characters he creates; theme always emerges superior to narrative movement and representation. His sins in this respect are, however, the common property of modern and, for that matter, traditional, Chinese writers. Considering the specific nature of his thematic and structural concerns, moreover, such a result would not have been difficult to predict. (Huters 1977: 270-271)\n\nDespite these minor flaws, Qian Zhongshu’s works of fiction demonstrate the psychological landscape of the Chinese intellectuals during the War of Resistance against Japan. Qian’s erudition and training in the western literature, especially British literature, also reinvigorated modern Chinese fiction in a positive sense. The four stories in Humans, Beasts and Ghosts all contain decadent aesthetics which exposes the decay of moral and ethical values, the decline of idealism, and the disillusionment with love and marriage. The mental struggles of the characters turn out to be futile because they cannot hold on to any firm belief system in a turbulent time during social transition as well as the war. In his later longer fiction Fortress Besieged (1946), Qian Zhongshu explored the similar themes of the moral degradation of the intellectuals, and the gradual disintegration of idealism during wartime, which I would not elaborate on in this essay."
