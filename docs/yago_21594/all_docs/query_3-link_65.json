        "text": "Heart’s Desire: Act I\n\nTranslated by Christopher G. Rea\n\nACT I\n\n(Setting: The parlour of ZHAO ZUYIN’s house, which is furnished in a refined, classical style. The furniture is all rosewood, calligraphic scroll paintings by famous hands adorn the walls, and the tables are laid out with antique porcelains. As the curtain rises, LI JUNYU, wearing a blue qipao, stands in the parlour. WANG SHENG stands to one side.)\n\nLI JUNYU: Is this the Zhao residence?\n\nWANG SHENG: Yes.\n\nLI JUNYU: My surname is Li.\n\nWANG SHENG: Li. OK, I got it.\n\nLI JUNYU: I’m your master’s niece—Li Junyu.\n\nWANG SHENG: I’ve never heard of you.\n\nLI JUNYU: Isn’t this the Zhao residence? Isn’t your master Mr Zhao Zuyin?\n\nWANG SHENG: Knowing his name isn’t going to help you. The master is a famous man—everyone’s heard of him!\n\nLI JUNYU: I’m his niece. I just arrived from Beiping. Your master and mistress wrote me a letter asking me to come.\n\nWANG SHENG: (Shaking his head) The master only has one niece, Third Mistress’s daughter, and her surname is Qian, not Li.\n\nLI JUNYU: I’m your Fifth Mistress’s daughter. My surname’s Li, and I’ve always lived in Beiping.\n\nWANG SHENG: I’ve never heard of any Fifth Mistress! Next you’re going to tell me there’s a Fifth Master!\n\nLI JUNYU: Of course there is! My father was famous too, a great painter.\n\nWANG SHENG: Oh? But he’s not one of us.\n\nLI JUNYU: He recently passed away, and Fifth Mistress long before him. We’ve always lived in Beiping—you’d have no way of knowing. Go ask your master and mistress to come out. They’re expecting me.\n\nWANG SHENG: Didn’t I tell you to wait here? The master and mistress aren’t up yet! I’d really be asking for it to disturb them so early on a Sunday.\n\nLI JUNYU: In that case, help me carry my trunk in.\n\nWANG SHENG: You can’t bring it in here. The weight of it will ruin the carpet.\n\nLI JUNYU: But someone will steal it if I leave it at the door.\n\nWANG SHENG: Don’t you have someone watching it for you?\n\nLI JUNYU: (To offstage) Binru, Binru! We’ll carry it in ourselves.\n\n(Exit LI JUNYU, who then re-enters carrying a trunk and a mesh basket together with CHEN BINRU, who is dressed in an old, tattered, blue Chinese full-length cotton gown. WANG holds CHEN back, but CHEN pushes him aside and places the trunk and the basket in the centre of the parlour. CHEN exits and then re-enters carrying a rush bag and two wooden boards, tied together.)\n\nWANG SHENG: (Stands to the side with his arms crossed) Great, great—a fine world of bandits this has turned into! The gentleman speaks with his mouth, not with his fists.\n\nCHEN BINRU: A rascal like you only understands when fists do the talking!\n\nWANG SHENG: (With his arms crossed in front of his chest) I’m not going to fight you.\n\nCHEN BINRU: You wouldn’t dare!\n\nLI JUNYU: Binru, just ignore him! Everything’s here. (Counts the luggage.)\n\n(Exit WANG SHENG.)\n\n……\n\nWe Three: Part I\n\nTranslated by Jesse Field\n\nPart I: We Two Grow Old\n\nOne night, I had a dream. Zhongshu and I were out on a walk together, talking and laughing, when we came to a place we did not know. The sun had set behind the mountains, and dusk was approaching. Then Zhongshu disappeared into the void. I searched everywhere but could find no trace of him. I called to him, but there was no answer. It was just me, alone, standing there in the wasteland not knowing where Zhongshu had gone. I cried out to him, calling his full name, but my cries just fell into the wilderness without the faintest echo, as if they’d been swallowed. Complete silence added to the blackness of the night, deepening my loneliness and sense of desolation. In the distance, I saw only layer upon layer of dusky dark. I was on a sandy road with a forest to one side. There was a murmuring brook; I couldn’t see how wide it was. When I turned to look back, I saw what appeared to be a cluster of houses. It was an inhabited place, but since I couldn’t see any lights, I thought they must be quite far away. Had Zhongshu gone home on his own? Then I’d better go home too! Just as I was looking for the way back, an old man appeared, pulling an empty rickshaw. I hurried over to bar his way, and sure enough he stopped, but I couldn’t tell him where I wanted to go. In the midst of my desperation, I woke up. Zhongshu lay next to me in bed, sound asleep.\n\nI tossed and turned for the rest of the night, waiting for Zhongshu to wake up; then I told him about what happened in my dream. I reproached him: How could you have abandoned me like that, leaving on your own without a word to me? Zhongshu didn’t try to defend the Zhongshu of my dream. He only consoled me by saying: this is an old person’s dream. He often had it too.\n\nYes, I’ve had this sort of dream many times. The setting may differ, but the feeling is the same. Most often the two of us emerge from some place, then, in the blink of an eye, he’s gone. I ask after him everywhere, but nobody pays any attention to me. Sometimes I search for him everywhere but end up in a succession of alleys, all with dead ends. Sometimes I am alone in a dimly lit station, waiting for the last train, but the train never comes. In every dream I am lonely and desperate. If only I could find him, I think, we could go home together.\n\nZhongshu probably remembered my reproach, and caused this dream to be ten thousand miles long.\n\n……"
