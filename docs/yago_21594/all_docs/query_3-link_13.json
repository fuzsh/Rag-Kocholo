        "text": "A Beijing auction house says it has no plans to withdraw an acclaimed scholar's letters and manuscripts from sale despite protests from his 102-year-old widow and legal experts.\n\nOn June 21, the Sungari International Auction Co Ltd is selling 66 letters Qian Zhongshu wrote to a family friend.\n\nThe sale also includes the original copy of \"Six Chapters from My Life 'Downunder,'\" featuring his wife's memoir of their life in Henan Province during the \"cultural revolution (1966-1976),\" and letters from his daughter, Qian Yuan, to the friend.\n\nYang Jiang, the writer's widow, said her husband made some controversial remarks in the letters that it would be inappropriate to publish. He insinuates that two famous literary figures, Lu Xun and Mao Dun, were unfaithful to their wives and that a couple, both famous translators, had not interpreted a Chinese classic well."
