The International Surf Lifesaving Association (ISLA) exists to advance professional lifesaving development to areas in need around the globe. Out of a deep passion for open water and a strong desire to prevent drownings, ISLA aids people in championing the aquatic safety situation in their own coastal communities. We do this through lifeguard training programs, lifeguard exchanges, equipment donations, purchasing connections, and utilizing the latest technology to sustain a global network of lifeguards that share information, techniques, stories, and culture. Our wish is to see friends and partners around the globe have the necessary tools to keep their water safe. ISLA is a social justice driven non-profit organization that is young, innovative, not afraid to do things for the first time. We adventure the globe with purpose, seeking to share life and help protect it. The global drowning epidemic compels us to action as we pioneer new ways to think about drowning in the developing world and effective solutions that will save thousands of lives. ISLA uses both ground-breaking technology and tried and true techniques; we follow in the tradition of those before us without fear to push it to a whole new level, constantly seeking to improve ourselves and the work we do. We welcome challenges and strive to leave a positive impact wherever we go. We are water people. We are lifeguards. We are globetrotters. We are activists. We are ISLA.
