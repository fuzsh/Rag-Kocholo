At the sound of the whistle, they sprint into the sea, a blur of pastel-pink wetsuits, fluoro-green life jackets and 8ft surfboards. They’re pushed out on their boards before hurtling back towards the shore, legs spread, eyes focused — oblivious to the 3,500",

        "text": "Here, on the pristine shores of southern California, dogs jet in from all corners to make their mark as the world’s fluffiest shredder. Surf dog Joey, a 13-year-old veteran, is one such. Prince Dudeman, a diamanté-draped, tutu-wearing bichon frise and Japanese Chin cross, is another. “We rescued Joey from a shelter,” his owner, Kay, tells me while hovering at the water’s edge like a pushy parent on sports day. “He started his career on a stand-up paddleboard — just ran up to a stranger and jumped right on!”\n\nHuntington Beach is a laid-back city in California, an hour’s drive south of LA and about 90 minutes north of San Diego. It has a South Beach Miami vibe, albeit with more modest biceps and fewer bars. Though handily located on Highway One, Huntington is often overlooked by California road-trippers blasting through in their Mustang convertibles, but the city makes the perfect two-day pit stop.\n\nI’m here for three nights, to mingle with the crowds who are in town for a weekend of shopping, sunbathing and, of course, surfing. So consistent and reliable are the medium-sized waves, the city has hosted the West Coast Surfing Championships, now known as the US Open of Surfing, since 1959. And with surfing to be introduced as an Olympic sport in 2020, all eyes are on Huntington Beach to take part when the Games come to Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nIt would be a fitting choice. After all, Duke Kahanamoku, the Hawaiian “father of modern surfing”, who was as famous for his Olympic swimming medals as he was for his surf skills, rode waves beneath Huntington Pier in the early 1920s. He returned 50 years later to help popularise the city’s surf scene. Today, a life-sized bronze statue of him stands at the corner of Main Street on the city’s Surfers’ Hall of Fame, an inspiration to its teenagers.\n\nDuke isn’t the only local hero. At the surf competition, I meet Gidget, a pug who went from agility dog to surf dude and looks blasé about being a champ. I also watch hotshots Ryan (owner) and Sugar (a rescue dog) ride tandem into shore. Sugar is scooped up by his entourage before gallantly paddling out for more. I’m envious of his talent. Yes, I’m jealous of a dog.\n\nNo bother, I’m in the right place. The next day, I meet local pro Brett Simpson, a two-time winner of the US Open of Surfing who offers tuition via Airbnb Experiences. We drive south in his pickup truck to State Beach, where I can work on my skills without an audience of sunbathers. I’ve had a surf lesson before, so we head straight into the ocean. “Lie on the board,” Brett tells me. “I’ll push you out.” Which gives me a chance to admire the setting: a beach filled with picnickers and a patch of Pacific all to myself. Brett positions me in the right spot for the wave and tells me when to paddle. I stand, I screech, I surf. We repeat the process again and again.\n\nThat afternoon, I explore beyond the surf. At LSXO, a tiny Vietnamese restaurant behind an unmarked door, I meet a group of hip thirtysomethings who are here for the banh mi and spicy cocktails (mains from £11; gopacificcity.com). I stroll along the 1,850ft pier — one of the longest on the West Coast — to watch the surfers at sunset.\n\nThe night ends in the company of a trio of moms at Perqs, a dive bar filled with ageing surf dudes (perqsbar.com). “We’ve driven from Los Angeles to escape our husbands for the weekend,” the ringleader tells me. We guzzle IPAs while Andrea Bocelli’s Con te partiro soars out of the speakers.\n\nThe next morning, I’m having another lesson, this time at the International Surfing Museum. I learn about the evolution of the sport, its quirky world records — 66 people stood on a giant surfboard for 12 seconds in 2015 — and Kanoa Igarashi, a Huntington Beach-raised surfer who is set to compete for Japan in next year’s Olympics. At nearby Banzai Bowls, I join a line of 20-year-olds waiting for açai and fruit-filled tubs to fuel them up for their surf or skate session (£6; banzaibowls.com).\n\nI wander on towards the dog beach, passing toddlers dragging bodyboards to the sea, and settle onto the sand. A bulldog is making its way towards the shore. On reaching the beach, it skips off the board with the finesse of a pro. Take note, surfing wannabes — at Huntington Beach, that’s how it’s done.\n\nHannah Summers was a guest of Visit California (visitcalifornia.com), Huntington Beach (surfcityusa.com) and Hertz, which has five days’ car hire from £126 (hertz.com).
