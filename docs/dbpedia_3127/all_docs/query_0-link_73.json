After completing a B.A. in Communications: Advertising and a B.A in Sociology, along with a professional background in Corporate Marketing/Events and a CSUF Certificate in Professional Meeting Planning and Special Events, a perfect fit to develop pickleball programs and events was created, while fulfilling her passion to volunteer for the community. She is also a player and an International Pickleball Teaching Professional Association Certified Pickleball Instructor, which weaves all of her passions together. Diana is co-founder of the Edison High School Pickleball Club, owner of Performance Pickleball, and was winner of the 2015 Gold and 2016 Silver Presidential Volunteer Service Award.
