        "text": "The following ‘Guiding Principles’ are a set of values and/or behaviours that are prioritised when developing regulations, policies and strategies for Surf Life Saving Sport. It is not intended to be a definitive list, but the foundation for discussion & decision making.\n\nA GREAT EXPERIENCE\n\n“All aspects of Surf Life Saving Sport should be viewed through the lens of being a great experience for everyone involved.”\n\nASPIRATIONAL\n\n“We should be striving to continuously improve all fronts at all times to be a leader of Surf Sports in the World.”\n\nONE MOVEMENT\n\n“We will be transparent in our action and engage with stakeholders but we will endeavour to provide leadership and national alignment that will take the sport forward.”\n\nCompetitions have a long and proud history within the Surf Life Saving movement and continue to play a significant role in ensuring that our members have the ability and passion to meet the challenging environments within which Surf Life Saving delivers its essential lifesaving service.\n\nFrom local surf carnivals to our National Championships, competition brings the membership together and provides opportunities for Juniors through to Masters to develop and compete across huge range of disciplines.\n\nNEW ZEALAND SURF LIFE SAVING CHAMPIONSHIPS\n\nOriginally named the Royal Lifesaving Society Championships 'Nationals' were first held in 1915 in Napier, representing the pinnacle competition of the season with over 1000 athletes anticipated to attend each summer. From Masters who have lost track of the number of Nationals they have attended to 14 year olds experiencing the competition for the first time, Nationals caters to all levels of participation and almost all aspects of Surf Life Saving. You will see New Zealand representatives, canoes, surf boat crews, surf swimmers, beach sprinters, ski and board paddlers all having a crack at being the next National Champion!\n\nNEW ZEALAND POOL RESCUE CHAMPIONSHIPS\n\nThe New Zealand Pool Rescue Championships take place around October each season, making it the first of our many National Championship competitions for the season. This event serves as an important development competition for our Surf Lifeguards and aspiring Surf Lifeguards, as they continue to develop important lifesaving skills for the season ahead. The New Zealand Pool Rescue Championships is iconic for being the only competition that includes our junior, senior and masters age groups in the same venue over three epic days of competition.\n\nOCEANS\n\nOceans: Festival of Junior Surf Lifesaving, is the biggest junior carnival of the season and aims to provide an opportunity for junior members to compete, challenge themselves and celebrate the camaraderie of surf lifesaving in a fun, exciting and safe beach and surf environment.\n\nSince its inception in 2000, Oceans has had a proud history of being the largest, most competitive, exciting and fun Junior Surf Life Saving Event in New Zealand! The competition celebrates the very best of our future Surf Life Savers as our junior members compete with their friends and against their fellow clubs.\n\nbp NEW ZEALAND IRB CHAMPIONSHIPS\n\nThe bp Surf Rescue New Zealand IRB Championships has a proud history of being filled with hard, fast, and action-packed racing. The largest Inflatable Rescue Boat racing competition on the Surf Life Saving calendar, crews from throughout the country will line up to showcase their lifesaving skills, fitness and experience in IRBs.\n\nThe competition includes several events, requiring varying levels of technical skill and physical fitness. With surf and weather conditions constantly changing, the competition has proved to be one of the most exciting competitions of the Surf Life Saving calendar.\n\nHIGH PERFORMANCE\n\nNew Zealand is a powerhouse of life saving sport, competing and winning internationally across pool, beach, Surf Boat and IRB events. Our high performance teams include the Black Fins, Junior Black Fins (pool & beach), Black Props (IRBs) and Oar Blacks (Boats). The pinnacle event is the Life Saving World Championships, held every two years. We are the current IRB World Champions and have previously won the both the Open & Youth championships and many of our athletes also represent New Zealand in Commonwealth and Olympic level.\n\nFind out more here\n\nAn exciting event which sees competitors starting laying down facing away from the beach flag batons located 10m, 15m or 20m away (depending on age) then pushing up off the sand to sprint and dive to get a beach flag. This event is similar to musical chairs where there is one less beach flag to competitors, so eliminating competitors each cycle until there is only one winner. Spectators can get up close to view beach flags and watch all the high agility action as it unfolds.\n\nTeams of four athletes race and in back and fourth relay race up and down the sprint track in their lanes. The beach relay baton will pass over behind the change over lines at pace until all four competitors have completed their lengths of the track. This event is great fun as a team and fast pace with high drama when the changeovers don't quite go to plan.\n\nStrength, power and stability is what is required to rocket a ski through the waves around three buoys and back to the beach. Athletes start paddling skis from 14 years and above and are amazing to watch in the surf and the skill of competitors to control the craft. Competitors also race a ski relay event which involves three competitors in a team each completing the ski course before running and tagging their next competitor.\n\nThe paddle board is used not only in sport but as a major rescue craft to save people in the sea. A paddle board event starts standing on the beach then a sprint start into the water where paddlers jump onto their knees or stomach to paddle the board through the waves around three buoy and back to the beach for a sprint finish up the sand. Boards range in sizes for junior surf and can be fibre glass or foam type construction down to body boards for our young nippers. Competitors also race a board or body board relay event which involves three competitors in a team each completing the board course before running and tagging their next competitor.\n\nDo you have a need for speed and power? ...then IRB racing is for you. Our IRB's travel through the surf at around 50kph and can tackle some very large surf conditions. IRB racing sees crews competing in a range of different style events being single rescue, assembly rescue, tube rescue, mass rescue and teams race. Similar to other pre or post season events you may also see long distance IRB events being held around our beautiful coastline. Our IRB racing crews are highly skilled being able to negotiate a range of conditions at speed to perform rescues at speed.\n\nA fantastic team event has embedded the surf canoe into the New Zealand events programme as something unique to us. Four paddlers using waka style paddles propel the double hull canoe through the surf around one buoy out at sea before returning back to shore to finish either in the water or a run up the beach by one team member. Up to seven canoes can race at a time creating some great viewing from the beach. Distance for this event are approximately 200m short course or 400m long course style racing. Some pre season type events also include longer distant paddle races.\n\nOur largest craft on the water sees four rowers and one sweep who steers the crew through the surf and back to shore, row the surf boat from a standing position in shore out through the waves, rounding one buoy at 200m or 400m distance before heading back to shore to finish either in the water or a run up the beach. These boats are fantastic to watch and require real team effort to row together through challenging conditions. Crews also team up with other crews (three in a team) within their club to race in the surf boat relay event which involves crews completing the course and then tagging their next crew to do the same.\n\nThe iron events are the endurance events of surf life saving, with competitors completing three different legs of the event (ski, board and swim) this makes for an action packed race that can change leaders every leg depending on a competitors strength. For our younger competitors they compete in a diamond event which involved swim and board legs. Other team relay type events include taplin's, cameron relays and grand cameron's which involve swim, running, board and sometimes ski for senior competitors. These relay events are fast paced and full of action."
