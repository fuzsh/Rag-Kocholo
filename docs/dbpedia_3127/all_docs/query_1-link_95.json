Donations to this organization go directly to sponsor projects and programs that benefit the park’s visitors and campers.\n\n​​\n\nExamples of projects supported by FOASP donations are: Repair and maintenance of a fleet of Beach Wheelchairs available to visitors free of charge; Nature Center and Interpretive programs such as Tie Dye Tuesday and Stampede and the Scales & Tales Program; Book and Beach Toy Lending Libraries; the Bicycle Safety Program; as well as their premier project for wild horse safety, Break the Habit.\n\n​​\n\nWild Horse Safety “Break the Habit”\n\nThe Friends of Assateague State Park promote the park's efforts to ensure safe and positive interactions between our visitors and the island's wild horses and other wildlife. FOASP’s Break the Habit initiative provides financial support, assists with grant writing and management, and assists in educating campers and visitors about what you can do to share the island safely with the wild horses.\n\nHorses are creatures of habit, and they unfortunately have become habituated to being fed or to scavenge food from campsites. This food is not healthy for them, even things like apples and carrots can cause a wild horse to get afflicted with colic, suffer and potentially die. When visitors store food properly, this results in many fewer food related incidents or dangerous interactions between horses and humans.\n\nThanks to grants received from the Community Foundation of the Eastern Shore, the Maryland Heritage Area Authority and generous private donations, the park is transitioning to horse-resistant picnic tables with attached food storage units. Campers will still use hard-sided containers (such as totes) or zippered storage bags but can store these securely beneath their table. Break the Habit tables are currently located in several camp loops and will be throughout the campground over the next few seasons. FOASP is promoting new educational efforts to encourage use of these and continued safe storage of food and pet food throughout the campground- please do your part to Break the Habit!\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nPresident: Cathy Cox\n\nVice President: Alan Smith\n\nTreasurer: Roddy Rodriguez\n\nSecretary: Trish Smoczynski\n\nBoard of Director At-Large: Roberta Laynor, Anita Smith, Marty Skarson\n\nAnnual Events & Meetings\n\nThe Friends of Assateague State Park sponsor a spring cleanup each April ahead of the campground opening for the season as well as park events throughout the year. Three organizational meetings are held each summer: one per month in June, July and August. If you visit Assateague, look for information about us in the Ranger Station and concession stand, as well as on the bathhouse bulletin boards. Details of FOASP activities are available in the newsletter sent to members or by request.​\n\nSupport Friends of Assateague State Park\n\nTo join Friends of Assateague State Park, please send an email to friendsofasp@gmail.com. If you would like to help support our efforts in keeping the wild horses of Assateague safe, please donate to Friends of Assateague State Park.

The grounds include a fully restored milk house and working kitchen garden. The entrance and first floor of the house are ADA accessible.\n\nRackliffe House is open on a regular schedule for docent-led tours beginning in May through October.\n\nThe Rackliffe House grounds and Rackliffe Trail are open year-round from sunrise to sunset; leashed pets are welcome.\n\nVisitors are asked to park at the Assateague Island Visitor Center and walk to the house along the Rackliffe Trail, starting behind the Visitor Center, approximately a half-mile.​\n\nT​he mission of the Rackliffe House Trust is to preserve and restore Rackliffe House and its grounds to their original 18th-century appearance and through artifacts and interpretation, to share stories of the Native, African, and European Americans who occupied this historic site. As a 501(c)3 non-profit foundation, Rackliffe House Trust operates under a long-term lease with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Rackliffe House's entrance fees, event rental fees, and donations are critical in continuing the preservation, maintenance, and operation of this historic property.\n\nPlease visit www.RackliffeHouse.org for tour schedule, event dates, and more information. If you are interested in Volunteering with Rackliffe House, please use the “Contact Us” tab on the website.\n\nRackliffe Trail\n\nStart your hike behind the Assateague Island Visitor Center. The Rackliffe Trail features a 1.5 mile loop through mainland forest, bayberry and wax myrtle groves, and freshwater ponds. Many migratory songbirds can be seen here along with deer, fox, and turtles. Find stunning views of the Sinepuxent Bay along the bayside corridor. Wander through the natural tunnel and keep an ear out for choruses of frogs and toads.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​Volunteer at Assateague State Park\n\nAssateague State Park offers many volunteer opportunities that include hosting in the campground, assisting with interpretive programs and/or special events, landscaping/gardening, carpentry/construction and performing general park maintenance. No matter what the duties, our volunteers are an integral part of the park’s operations and we greatly appreciate the dedication of our fantastic volunteers.\n\n​\n\nCamp Hosts\n\nThe campground host program invites volunteers to experience camping a whole new way in the beautiful setting of Maryland State Parks. A campground host receives free camping in exchange for working to clean and maintain their assigned camping loop, bathhouse, beach and trails on a daily basis. Our hosts are a vital contact point between campground visitors and park staff and also operate our campground contact station. These dedicated volunteers are often found walking through their camping loops greeting visitors, answering questions, or reminding campers of park policies including safety around the island’s wild horses.\n\nHosts must provide a minimum of 28 hours of volunteer service per week. Hosting opportunities are offered from May through October for one-month assignments. Host campsites are equipped with 30 amp electric hookups however no water or sewer hookups are available. Additional volunteer opportunities are available to hosts who show interest in helping out in other aspects of park operations, such as maintenance, Nature Center programs, or special event assistance.\n\nInterpretive & Education Program Volunteers\n\nThe Nature Center at Assateague State Park is open April through October. We offer a wide range of programs to school groups, youth groups, and all park visitors, as well as special events and community outreach programs. Volunteer activities include conducting programs for park visitors, feeding and care of education animals, facilitating scheduled environmental education programs to school and youth groups, and staffing our Nature Nook day-use exhibit area. Our interpretive program volunteers come from all age groups, high school through retirement, and invigorate the programs with excitement, knowledge, and enthusiasm for the outdoors and for working with youth.\n\nVolunteer Rangers\n\nBecome a Volunteer Ranger and help protect Maryland's natural resources at beautiful Assateague State Park. The Volunteer Ranger Program is for people ages 18 and above who want to assist the park’s full-time staff with operations, programs and public service. Volunteers are trained and provided with uniforms for their jobs once they have completed 40 hours of volunteer service at the state park. A statewide orientation training helps rangers become familiar with the state park operations. Additional training opportunities, that may include CPR, first aid, search and rescue, and trail stewardship, may be offered on a regional basis.\n\nNative Plant Landscaping & Maintenance Volunteers​\n\nTo assist in keeping Assateague State Park safe and beautiful for its visitors, many volunteers contribute to the maintenance of the island and mainland resources. Project needs include native plant landscaping at the park’s various garden plots and pollinator meadows, assistance with grounds-keeping, building maintenance, and dune maintenance.\n\nWe also work with local community school groups, scouts, and other volunteers to aid us in keeping our park and the beach clean and beautiful. Although our state parks follow a trash free policy, often our visitors do not. We welcome groups interested in doing a good deed to help our environmental efforts for a beach or marsh clean-up. The park will provide free trash bags to volunteers who should bring along work gloves, sunscreen, bug spray and appropriate clothing and shoes.\n\nIf you are interested in volunteering at Assateague State Park, please e-mail assateague.statepark@maryland.gov or call 410-641-2120 for more information.\n\n​ ​\n\nViewing the Assateague Horses Safely​​\n\n​​\n\n​During your visit to Assateague, you will most likely encounter at least a few of the island’s most popular residents. ​Petting or feeding the wild horses may seem like a harmless and fun thing to do, but the consequences can be terrible. For your safety and the safety of the horses, please obey park regulations and do not approach, touch, or feed the Assateague horses.\n\nAssateague horses do bite, kick and can carry rabies. These horses are WILD, and they don't behave like domestic horses. Treat the horses with respect - move back and stay safe.\n\nStay at least a \"bus length\" or 40 feet away, but remember that may still be too close depending on the circumstances. If horses approach you, back off and retreat to a safe distance.\n\nBreak the Habit! Do not take food to the beach unless i​n a cooler that is zi​ppered or secured with a nylon strap. Even then, if horses approach your food, you must move away. If you are camping, secure your food including dog food in your vehicle or RV or use the horse-proof storage box located beneath your picnic table.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n​\n\nWhere can I go to see the horses?\n\n​\n\nThe horses are feral and roam freely throughout the Maryland section of the island, so they can be seen anywhere at any time. They can often be found in the marsh areas, on the beach, or further down the island in the National Park’s OSV (Over Sand Vehicle) area. When visiting the island to see the horses, be sure to follow all regulations including not stopping or parking along roadways or getting closer than 40 feet to any wildlife. The best option is to park at the State Park or National Park day-use area and enjoy a walk along the trails or beach in search of the horses in their natural habitat. There is no guarantee that by paying the service charge visitors will see horses.\n\nCan I touch or feed the horses?\n\nIt is illegal to touch or feed any wildlife on the island including the horses. It is dangerous for them and for people when interactions are too close. ​​\n\nAnimals like horses can easily pick up scavenging practices, so never feed them or leave food accessible to them. Once they learn to beg, they can become aggressive, are more likely to get injured by vehicles, and can become seriously ill or die. Although they appear harmless and even curious about you, horses injure visitors every year. That’s partly why approaching, harassing, or feeding any kind of wildlife, no matter how small or familiar, is illegal. Citations are issued when visitors are observed doing so.\n\n​\n\n​​ ​\n\nHow many horses are on the island?\n\n​\n\n​​\n\nThere are two herds on the island, one in Maryland and one in Virginia. There are approximately 70-80 horses in the Maryland herd and about 150 in the Virginia (Chincoteague) herd. A contraceptive darting program may be used with the Maryland horses in order to keep the population size to a sustainable number.\n\nHow did the horses get here?​\n\n​\n\nThe wild horses on Assateague Island are managed by the National Park Service.\n\nLocal lore experts theorized the ponies arrived on the island via a shipwrecked vessel in the late 18th or early 19th century. Others attribute their arrival by pirates drawn to the island who ultimately abandoned the animals. A more likely theory is that farmers in colonial times used the island for grazing areas to avoid paying taxes on the land.\n\nThe National Park Service manages the herd of horses in the Maryland end of Assateague Island. Visit this link to learn more about how your behaviors can contribute to a safer habitat for horses and a more enjoyable visit for people.\n\nThe separate herd in Virginia is owned by the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department, which sponsors the annual pony penning and swim every July.\n\nThe ponies’ diet consists mainly of marsh and dune grasses. Their water comes from the freshwater ponds located on the island. They are true horses, and not actual ponies, who have adapted to the diet and life on Assateague. Their short, stocky build allows them to navigate the marshes and to store water efficiently.\n\nDid you know that the horses’ eyes do not reflect light at night? This makes them difficult to see after dark so always drive safely, drive slowly, and stay alert!\n\nDuring the winter the horses’ coats become quite thick to protect them from the harsh winds.\n\n​\n\nTop ↑​\n\n​​\n\n​\n\nAssateague's Wildlife\n\nAssateague State Park is a premier site for wildlife viewing and provides opportunities for spotting a wide range of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, and insects. You can also find artifacts left behind by aquatic species such as clams, oysters, horseshoe crabs, and whelks when you comb the beach. Other aquatic species such as dolphins, rays, and sometimes sharks can be seen from the shore.\n\nAssateague Island is on the Atlantic flyway and over 200 species of birds have been sighted here - from gulls to herons, egrets to eagles, even endangered peregrine falcons and snowy owls. Those most prevalent include osprey, brown pelican, oystercatcher, sandpiper, sanderlings, and a wide range of ducks, geese and other waterfowl.\n\nThe ocean and bay surrounding the island teem with life. Dolphins are often seen frolicking in the waves of the ocean. Flounder, spot, sea trout, puffer, rockfish, croaker, red drum and bluefish are residents, and marlin and tuna can be found in deeper water offshore. Whales, dolphins, and several species of sharks may be seen in and around the waves. Seals may come out to rest on the Assateague beaches over the winter. Seals and sea turtles have also washed up on the shore. Staff at Assateague work with the National Aquarium and DNR Oxford Lab when a beaching occurs – whether the animal is alive or not.\n\nBoth whitetail and sika deer live on the island. Photos by Dorothy Gonder\n\n​\n\nWhitetail deer can be found throughout Maryland and the region and are also seen on Assateague Island. Sika deer originated in Asia and were brought to the island in 1923. They are more closely related to elk than our native whitetail. Sika prefer the thick marshlands to the more wooded areas that the whitetail inhabit. They reach heights of 2½ - 3 feet, can weigh between 70-90 pounds, and can make ten different sounds!\n\n​The Nature Center is the perfect place to see native animals up close. Summer visitors can see horseshoe crabs, terrapins, seahorses, spider crabs, flounder, eel, blue crabs, hogchoker, pufferfish, spiny boxfish, lookdown, mud snails, silversides, box turtles, surf clams, mud turtles, sea stars, mummichog, killifish, quahog, bay and sea scallops, perch, glass shrimp, and sea cucumbers, to name a few.\n\n​The Wild Horses\n\nAssateague Island is known as a place where wild horses roam freely. Visitors can see horses grazing in the marshes or up on the beach looking for a breeze to escape the heat of summer. Horses are safely viewed from a distance of at least a bus length (or 40 feet). Getting too close puts humans and horses into dangerous situations and is illegal. Always secure your food and keep it away from the horses by storing in your vehicle and using zippered bags and coolers with nylon straps when you do bring food to the beach. If you are camping, use your picnic table storage box to keep your food secure. If horses approach you, you must move away.\n\nWhen taking photographs, always keep a safe distance (at least 40 feet away) and give horses their space. They can be unpredictable and may make sudden movements including charging, biting, and kicking. Let’s all work together to keep the “wild” in wildlife at Assateague State Park!\n\n​ ​"
