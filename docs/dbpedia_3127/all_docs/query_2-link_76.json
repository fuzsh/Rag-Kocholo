        "text": "On Tuesday, September 12, the Bethany-Fenwick Area Chamber of Commerce (BFACC) and Fells Point Surf Company presented a check for $560 to the Sussex County Lifesaving Association (SCLA) from funds raised from lifeguard t-shirt sales. Fells Point Surf Company sponsored free shirts for guards in attendance at the Lifeguard Awards which took place last month. Additional shirt sales brought the total amount contributed to the SCLA to $2,060.\n\nMatt Farlow, president of the SCLA, alongside his wife, Chloe, and daughter, Ada, received the check on behalf of the guards who will benefit from this donation. Each year, the lifeguards in this area look forward to the Lifeguard Awards event hosted by the chamber at Big Chill Beach Club. Farlow expressed gratitude for the support of the BFACC and local business sponsors for continued recognition of the hardworking men and women of the patrols. Over 300 guards from 8 patrols served the beaches, performing 463+ rescues this season through the Lifeguard Awards event which was held on August 15. The Quiet Resorts area is honored to have these incredible patrols monitoring the beaches, locals, and visitors alike.\n\nSCLA guards finished 2nd in the country at the United States Lifesaving Associationâ€™s National Lifeguard Championships. The SCLA finished first overall in the Open division (ages 18-29) and had multiple gold medalists and other silver and bronze medalists as well. The week of September 17th, six SCLA lifeguards will be traveling to South Padre Island, Texas to compete as part of the U.S. National Team at the International Lifeguard Competition, which is being held in the U.S. for the first time. Follow @scla302 on Instagram for updates.\n\nLifeguard shirts are available for sale for $20 at the Information Center at the BFACC located at 36913 Coastal Highway, Fenwick Island. All proceeds from shirt sales will be donated to the SCLA, which has recently been established as a 501c3. SCLA officers include President Matt Farlow; Vice President Patrick Berns; Treasurer Mark Banks; Secretary Ronnie Phillips; Delegate Joe Donnelly; Delegate Rich Szvitich; and Delegate Derek Shockro."
