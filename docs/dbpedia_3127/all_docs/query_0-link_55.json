        "text": "Los Angeles County’s finest lifeguards accomplished their goal last weekend in Huntington Beach when they won their 20th consecutive title at the United States Lifesaving Association’s National Lifeguard Championships.\n\nThe team got off to a great start after the first day of the two-day competition and was never threatened. They defeated second-place Volusia Surf Lifesaving Association by more than 400 points.\n\n&#8220It’s a fantastic accomplishment for the county,” said L.A. County’s Micah Carlson, 23, who is a lifeguard for the sixth year. &#8220Los Angeles County has been essentially dominating for the last 20 years. There were a couple of years back in New Jersey and I think down in Daytona (Beach) where we almost lost it.”\n\nBill Boyle, 32, of the Miami Beach Ocean Rescue competed in his fifth nationals.\n\n&#8220They’re very athletic, pretty much everybody on their team can do something well, and they have a lot of studs that score points in every event they do.”\n\nMel Solberg, 41, has been competing at nationals for years.\n\n&#8220It’s a fun group of people,” Solberg said. &#8220We love racing and we love getting out here. We do well so that helps to add to the fun.”\n\nBob Moore, who worked as an official at this year’s championships, was a big part of the run the L.A. County has put together.\n\n&#8220I’m really pleased to see L.A. County come back in force again here in Huntington Beach.”\n\nAfter Friday’s first day of competition, they had already doubled the points of their nearest competitor.\n\n&#8220Most of the time we almost have it wrapped up after the first day, but we still go hard into the second day,” Solberg said. &#8220We really don’t think about the score that much. We just have a good time and try and get our individual places.”\n\nMoore explained the reason for L.A. County’s success over such a long period of time.\n\n&#8220L.A. County has had a lot of depth over the years. We rely on the young kids coming up and developing, but we really rely on the older guards Š who sit in the tower, do the duty, and then come back out every year. We even had a 67-year-old retired lifeguard in Ross McKinnon and he got a lot of points. L.A. County dominates basically because we have many guards in different age groups.”\n\nChris Murphy competed along with his talented brothers Mike and Brian in their seventh nationals.\n\n&#8220In some ways it adds a little bit of pressure, but then when you think about all the guys that we get to race with and the women as well, it makes it a really uplifting atmosphere. It’s a great group of people.”\n\nL.A. County’s Blaine Morgan, 29, took home the men’s open title for the third time. He grew up at the beaches where the competition was held and a large contingent of his family was there to watch him.\n\n&#8220To come down here in front of the hometown to win the overall and obviously to win the team title, it’s great.”\n\nMorgan beat teammate Brian Murphy to take the title. He won the rescue race, international ironman, landline, rescue-board-rescue, run-swim-run and was on the winning Taplin Relay, which was just an exhibition race this year. This is his fifth year with the team. He also won the open title in 2002 and 2003.\n\n&#8220Blaine is a fantastic and incredible athlete,” said Carlson. &#8220I’ve competed against him for six years now and I’ve only beat him once. Every time I go up against him, it’s a battle and most of the time he comes out on top.”\n\n&#8220You end up doing up a lot of events and beating yourself up, but it’s worth it at the end. You get that trophy and it’s fun,” said Morgan, who works part time, and is a firefighter and paramedic with the city of Carlsbad.\n\nNow that the national competition is over, can these lifeguards take a break? No, according to Carlson, who even has to train for the Hennessey’s paddleboard competition in Australia coming up.\n\n&#8220You’re never off. You’re always training.”\n\nFinal Team Results (Top 5)\n\nChapter Points in &#8220A” (Large teams)\n\n1. Los Angeles County Lifeguard Association: 637.5 points\n\n2.
