        "text": "Local surfers from the social group “Sisters of Stoke (SOS)” hit the beach near Bournemouth pier on St. Patrick’s Day Sunday last week, not only to catch the cool spring waves but to learn bystander rescue techniques from local surf, SUP and safety training organisation Surf Steps.\n\nThe term ‘bystander’ describes any member of the public, be they family, friend, or stranger, attempting to rescue someone in distress. However, it can be extremely hazardous for the bystanders if they don’t understand and assess the risks or have knowledge of rescue principles/techniques.\n\nThis is the first time this training programme has run in the UK. SALT (Surfers Awareness in Lifesaving Techniques) was designed by a team of Huntington Beach lifeguards, in California, US, to provide aquatic emergency response guidelines and techniques to surfing members of the public.\n\nThe program teaches The 3R’s:\n\nRecognition of potential hazards and victims.\n\nReaction to people in need, with consideration of one’s own safety first.\n\nResponse from lifeguards, emergency services and surfers.\n\nThe Sisters of Stoke (SOS) said much of what they learned on Sunday was new to them. The SALT program changed the way they think about people who end up in unsafe situations in the water. SALT teaches that a crisis can happen to anyone at any time and that surfers should have an obligation to look after one another, especially when there is no lifeguard patrol.\n\n“It’s rewarding to be in a program that’s not just about surfing — it’s about helping out others,” “It is going to have a ripple effect. … With all the people here today, you know they are going to save lives in the future.” Mar, SOS\n\nThe group took turns in training being the person in trouble and then, rescuer, then assistance. Andy, Surf Steps’ trainer, showed the group how to identify if the person was in trouble, how to secure them, and then how to start the person’s safe return to shore.\n\n“We realised that many bystander rescues were conducted by surfers who are already out there surfing. If you surf long enough, it is not a matter of if you will rescue someone — it’s when.” Andy, Surf Steps\n\nSALT instructors tell participants that many rescues will also need a response from lifeguards or other emergency medical services. A big issue is that many untrained people trying to help in these situations without knowledge and coordination can make it more difficult.\n\nIn the US, The SALT program is run by Huntington Beach Marine Safety Division and is free to any local surf groups. Those interested can email marinesafetyeducation@surfcity-hb.org to set up a class.\n\nInterested in similar programs for Surf or SUP groups in your local area? Contact Andy, Director of Surf Steps by email: andy@surfsteps.co.uk\n\nBig thanks to Sistas of Surf for being part of our top 1st-time trial of SALT!\n\nLast and no means least, Ian and Terry at Havana Beach Hotel for being the stand-up members of the local community by providing their awesome venue for the classroom and changing facilities! Legends:-)\n\nWalton on Thames, Elmbridge, Surrey August 21-23 2020\n\n8 SUP coaches from Ditton’s Paddle Boarding took part in the first Coach Rescue course since the UK lockdown in March.\n\nThe course was hosted at a superb private location right on the banks of the river Thames arranged by Brett Scillitoe, Admiral of Dittons, with Surfing England and SLSGB trainer/assessor Andy Joyce.\n\nSubjects covered included practical skills, safety, communication, risk analysis and assessment, SUP rescue, and First Aid.\n\nThe days started with theory and dry land practical sessions, followed in the afternoon by a lot of enjoyable water-based practical sessions in the surprisingly mild temperatures of the summertime Thames.\n\n“It was great to be able to get back to doing what I love, helping people become safer coaches in and on the water and enable them to perform quality rescues in emergency situations. The students finally got the long-waited opportunity to complete the internationally recognised course and showed this in the way they applied themselves during the courses.” Andy Joyce\n\n” Andy was a great instructor and all the students commented on how well he guided them through all parts of the course, with care and consideration. Nothing was ever a bother to go through again. They were all very keen to get going and practice their new skills.” Brett Scillitoe\n\nSurf Steps provide this and other safety courses that are suitable for all watersports users, not just lifesavers and coaches.\n\nIf you are interested in any information regarding these, feel free to contact Trainer: Andy (andy@surfsteps.co.uk) or Ditton’s Paddle Boarding https://dpbclub.co/contact-us/\n\nSurfing England helped bring some of our wide surfing community together on the evenings of the 13-14 May to take part in an ISA Judging and Officiating course.\n\nIn addition to the English course members starting their Judging journey, we had surfers wanting to improve their competition performance and students from Ireland, Norway and China!\n\nSurfing England / ISA Course presenter and National Para Surf Team Manager Andy Joyce hosted the course, in conjunction with Ben Kewell from Glide Surf School\n\nAcademy director Andy Joyce said “I loved running the Judging course online, it’s theory and interactive video based, so works well in the online format. I would thoroughly recommend taking this course if you’re anyway involved in competitive surfing, be it an aspiring judge or official, competing surfer, or even a parent or supporter of one”\n\nA course student reflected on the course:\n\n“Thought the course was excellently presented and the use of the zoom platform was a great option during these difficult times. The breakout room feature was fantastic tool, the ability to see the rest of the course attendees and chat in the breaks was great. Its safe and eco-friendly, means folks can join from overseas without the expense of travel. Worked really well on many fronts. I stayed for most of the heats after and my scores were within a few .2’s or .5’s of the on-screen scores so stoked with that, nice to practice!”\n\nIf you want a wide range of #Surf and #SUP coaching, Judging and safety courses you can do from anywhere in the world, click here\n\nSpecial thanks to all involved in the course for making it happen: The students, Glide Surf School, the ISA and Surfing England for their support!\n\nOnline-courses reach across the globe!\n\nLast week’s ISA Surf Coach course has highlighted other positive aspects of our online courses. We reached out across the globe this time, having students from as far apart as Senegal and Ecuador taking part!\n\nSurf Steps Water Training Academy hosted the course, in conjunction with Ben Kewell from Glide Surf School\n\nAcademy director Andy Joyce said “It’s amazing the global reach our online courses are having. When you can have people from different continents meeting each other from their homes, the opportunities for networking are immense! In addition, the courses allow people in lockdown to socialise and do something constructive. It feels great to be making a small, but positive difference in these times!”\n\nOne course student wrote:\n\n“The two sessions were very interesting, and we enjoyed them a lot. It was cool having people from everywhere around the world. It was very well organized and I loved the break out groups! It was really fun to hear and share experiences with the others in smaller groups:-)”\n\nIf you want a wide range of #Surf and #SUP coaching, judging and safety courses you can do from anywhere in the world, click here\n\nSpecial thanks to all involved in the course for making it happen: Glide Surf School, the ISA and Surfing England for their support!"
