        "text": "PaleyFest NY is lining up shows for this year’s event, starting with panels devoted to the 10th anniversary of Starz’s “Outlander,” one for HBO’s “Somebody Somewhere” and another for AMC’s “The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon – The Book of Carol.”\n\nThe festival will run from Oct. 16 to Oct. 22 in midtown Manhattan and feature screenings and conversations with the casts and creative teams of the season’s most-anticipated television.\n\n“‘Outlander,’ ‘Somebody Somewhere’ and ‘The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon – The Book of Carol’ each represent excellence in television, and we are thrilled to reveal these stellar programs as the first announced program selections for this year’s PaleyFest NY,” Maureen J. Reidy, president, CEO of The Paley Center for Media, said in a statement. “We look forward to welcoming television fans to The Paley Museum this October, and we extend our tremendous thanks to Citi for their continued support of PaleyFest NY.”\n\nThe full schedule of programs will be announced on Monday, Sept. 9.\n\nIn other TV roundup news:\n\nPROGRAMMING\n\nThe second season of the Paramount+ comedy “Colin From Accounts” will premiere on Sept. 26 on the streamer, and all eight episodes of the new season will be available to stream at launch.\n\n“‘Colin From Accounts’ is a romantic comedy about flawed, funny people choosing each other and embracing the all-too-relatable chaos of modern life. After Gordon (Patrick Brammall) and Ashley (Harriet Dyer) are brought together in season one by a spontaneous nipple flash and the subsequent accident that injured the titular (no pun intended) dog, season two of the hit series opens with Ash and Gordon now living together and trying to get their beloved, special needs dog, Colin, back from his new owners. It’s the first in a series of hurdles for the new couple as they find out more about each other, for better and worse,” reads the show’s log line.\n\nSeries creators Brammall and Dyer are returning to write, executive produce and star in the upcoming season and will be joined by Emma Harvie, Genevieve Hegney, Michael Logo, Helen Thomson, Darren Gilshenan, Annie Maynard, Tai Hara and Glenn Hazeldine.\n\nNew cast members include Celeste Barber (“Wellmania,” “The Letdown”), Virginia Gay (“Savage River,” “Safe Home”), Justin Rosniak (“The Surfer,” “Mr Inbetween”), John Howard (“SeaChange,” “The Merger”), Lynne Porteus (“Home and Away,” “The Commons”) and Broden Kelly (“Aunty Donna,” “Irreverent.”)\n\nEVENTS\n\nIn celebration of its 62 Emmy nominations, Amazon MGM Studios will launch three food trucks on Aug. 10 based on “Fallout,” “Mr. & Mrs. Smith” and “Red, White and Royal Blue.” Each truck will make two stops across Los Angeles before landing at their final destination at Cinespia’s screening of “True Romance” in Hollywood.\n\nThe “Fallout” food truck will stop at the Venice sign on the corner of Pacific Avenue and Windward Avenue from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. before stopping in Santa Monica on the corner of Montana Avenue and 15th Ct. from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. The truck will serve “vault burgers,” veggie burgers, french fries and “Okie Dokie donut holes.”\n\nThe “Mr. & Mrs. Smith” food truck starts at the Miracle Mile next to La Brea Tar Pits from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. before heading to the Runyon Canyon Park entrance in West Hollywood from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. “John’s NY Style hot dogs,” “Jane’s veggie dogs” and “John’s and Jane’s cookies” will be served.\n\nThe “Red, White & Royal Blue” food truck begins in Studio City on the corner of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Ventura Boulevard from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. before stopping in Silverlake on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Sanborn Avenue from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. The truck will serve “Perfect Union fish and chips,” wedding cake pops and Earl Grey iced tea.\n\nPARTNERSHIPS\n\nTV One Networks has partnered with Xfinity in a deal that will see its TV One and Cleo TV channels join the lineup offered for its broadcast TV streaming service, Xfinity NOW TV as part of an extended distribution agreement with Comcast.\n\nThrough NOW TV, subscribers can access TV One’s content library, which includes classic series, movies, docuseries and true crime programming like “Raising Fame,” “Unsung,” “Uncensored,” “For My Man” and ”Fatal Attraction.”\n\nAlternatively, CLEO TV offers original lifestyle content, which they say targets young women of color and includes “New Soul Kitchen,” “Just Eats with Chef JJ,” “Culture Kitchen,” “Living by Design with Jake and Jazz,” and classic sitcoms like “Eve and Girlfriends.”\n\n“We are excited to announce the expansion of our long-standing distribution agreement with Comcast with the addition of our networks to the NOW TV channel lineup,” Michelle L. Rice, president of TV One and CLEO TV, said in a statement. “TV One and CLEO TV’s programming covers a wide range of entertainment content targeted to the Black audience, who are looking for choice and quality content that authentically reflects our diverse culture and experiences.”\n\nThe channels and content are now available for watching on Xfinity NOW TV.\n\n*\n\nFox Entertainment is partnering with the United States Lifesaving Association to support the “Lifeguards First” campaign, a letter-writing initiative that aims to grant open-water lifeguards the benefits and recognition of Emergency First Responders. The partnership comes ahead of the debut of Fox’s new drama series “Rescue: HI-Surf,” premiering Sept. 22.\n\nFox and USLA will bring the initiative to a beach pop up in Los Angeles Aug. 31, which will include shaved ice trucks, photo ops, appearances from the Rescue: HI-Surf cast and opportunities to spread awareness and further support the movement.\n\nThe show follows the personal and professional lives of heavy-water lifeguards who patrol and protect the North Shore of O’ahu. Each episode will feature the lifeguards saving lives in the difficult conditions of Hawaii’s Seven Mile Miracle.\n\nEXECUTIVE NEWS\n\nFremantle has promoted Trey Durst to vice president of U.S. distribution for the production company’s international division.\n\nDurst joined the company in January 2022 and served as a director within the division. During his time at Fremantle, he negotiated for the distribution and monetization of the company’s FAST channels and AVOD library within the U.S., finding unique solutions to optimizing revenue across Fremantle’s content library.\n\nIn his new role, Durst will continue to report to Lisa Honig, senior executive vice president of North American distribution, international, whose team is responsible for maximizing the revenue of Fremantle’s vast portfolio of content across all means of distribution.\n\n“I look forward to continuing my journey at Fremantle,” Durst said. “It’s exciting to be part of a new sector of Fremantle’s business and to see how much it has grown in recent years. I can’t wait to continue exploring innovative ways to make our iconic IP available via the latest advances in the world of streaming.”\n\nINITIATIVES\n\nIn a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission, Texas Congressman Joaquin Castro, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders have urged the agencies to investigate the proposed joint sports streaming venture between Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney subsidiary ESPN called Venu Sports.\n\nIf Venu Sports were to be ratified, other sports programmers would have to go through Fox, Disney, and Warner Bros. for sports licensing rights, while at the same time, competing with Venu with their own sports streaming services. The lawmakers also argue that Venu potentially violates antitrust and telecommunications laws protecting the public from excessive consolidation.\n\n“This massive new sports streaming company would be poised to control more than 80% of nationally broadcast sports and more than half of all national sports content, putting it in a position to exercise monopoly power over televised sports,” the letter stated. “The market power of its three giant parent companies would enable it to discriminate against competitors and increase prices for consumers.”\n\nBROADCAST NEWS\n\nABC News on-air contributor and “Nightline” producer Ashan Singh will now work as a correspondent for the late-night evening newscast.\n\nAshan started at ABC News’ New York bureau in 2016 as a freelance production associate at “Nightline.” Since then, he has held various roles on the show, including on-air contributor and producer, before being named multiplatform reporter in 2022.\n\nHis reporting has helped spotlight underrepresented communities, explore evolving technology and feature some of the biggest names in pop culture, like Lil Nas X, Cardi B, D-Nice and the Brothers Osborne. Ashan’s investigative work has also illuminated polarizing political issues nationwide, including cannabis legalization and restorative justice. He also interviewed former NFL coach Brian Flores about his systemic racism class action lawsuit against the NFL.\n\n“Ashan is a talented journalist, continuously demonstrating his versatility and invaluable insight while covering a variety of stories across programs and platforms. In fact, his dogged journalism skills earned a 2024 News & Documentary Emmy®Award nomination for Outstanding Emerging Journalist — his second back-to-back nomination in this coveted category,” the statement read. “We look forward to seeing what he and our incredible team at “Nightline” create and deliver together in this exciting new chapter.”\n\nYou can watch “Nightline” on ABC or stream it on Disney+/Hulu."
