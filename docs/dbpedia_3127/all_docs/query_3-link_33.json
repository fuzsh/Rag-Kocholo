        "text": "Keenan Roxburgh\n\nAustralia\n\nHi, I’m connected to ISA through Surfing Australia and have been a professional judge under the ISA training and education pathway for over 20 years! I feel privileged to have had influence and mentorship from many great judges in Australia and thought my international work many others from around the world. I’m also an approved Course presenter for both the International Judging & Officiating Course and the Level 1 Surf Coaching Course. I’ve been surfing since early childhood and have a passion for traditional longboarding, single fins and fish surf craft. On the right day you’ll see me ride anything though! For over a decade I’ve worked closely on my surfboard design with master shaper Phil Myres from Lennox Head Australia and feel stoked to have been able to have so much input into the designs of my quiver. Coming from the wave rich east coast of Australia I’m spoilt for good waves an hours drive north I’m at snapper and less than an hour south I’m at Angourie! Between these two cornerstones of world class waves I manage to find lots of salty sessions in uncrowded conditions that I’ll let the adventurer find. Thanks to all the hard work the ISA team put into the sport that we all love we now can celebrate surfing as an Olympic sport!! Looking forward to working & surfing with you all soon✌️\n\nJanna Van Hoof\n\nCanada\n\nI decided in 2008 to get more people (especially women) on the water with SUP and haven't looked back! I coach SUP and surf on challenging and windy Lake Ontario in Toronto, Canada, and on fun beach-break waves in Canoa, Ecuador. I love that SUP is so accessible and is increasing the amount of people falling in love with the water (and waves). I have over 10 years of experience SUP surfing, teaching beginners, and coaching teachers in a variety of challenging conditions. I love my job because I get to support athletes and teachers year-round through ISA's classes and certification programs and travel to and judge contests occasionally and super lucky to team manage the Ecuador surf juniors. So fun! My favorite waves are always the home breaks with friends. Take a course with me and achieve your own goal of getting more people on the water!\n\nhttps://www.supgirlz.com/\n\nsupgirlzto\n\nGustavo Corrales Ch.\n\nCosta Rica\n\nA neighbor of Jacó Beach, Gustavo has more than 25 years of practicing the sport of surfing, as well as other activities related to the sea.

As long as I can look back in my own memories I've had a connection with the ocean. My rescpect for the ocean only keeps growing an growing the more different places I visit! Especially since I crossen the Pacific ocean on my own sailboat and now how to spearfish now, my respect keeps growing and growing! My vision about surfing is: I want to surf every kind of wave (choppy 2ft to clean 12 ft barrels) on the best board for the wave condition. That's why i shortboard but also have some twin fish and a classic longboard! Don't have favorite spots, every place where there are surfers is magical!\n\nElisabeth Catharina van Hunsel\n\nNetherlands\n\nHey, my name is Els and I am from the Netherlands. As for many people, surfing changed my life and brought me to so many cool places, where I met beautiful people and made amazing memories. I teach/coach and give the surf instructor courses because I just love watching people being stoked about their surfing progress and personal development in many different ways. It could be about joy, technique, mental health, or them becoming an instructor, whatever the goal of the surfer is, I like to contribute to their process to help them reach their goal. Besides surfing I like dancing salsa/bachata, hang out with my friends and family, ski and snowboard, read, go on trip with my van and be in nature.\n\nels_van_hunsel\n\nHans van den Broek\n\nNetherlands\n\nHi I am Hans, living in Scheveningen, Holland.
