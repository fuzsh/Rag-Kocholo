        "text": "The other night we were surfing some tiny little onshore waves at low tide. The sandbars are amazing right now.\n\nTo say “surfing” may even be a stretch. We were out playing on the ocean, enjoying the warm Atlantic, and we happened to have our surfboards part of that time. Even some of the soft surfboards are almost glorified pool toys. But it was glorious.\n\nThere was a family on the inside of the sandbar, a dad pushing one daughter into waves while the other jumped into waves herself. Heartwarming. This simple act of riding the ocean’s summertime energy is an absolutely pure form of enjoyment. The only thing wrong with this situation was the Wavestorm surfboard.\n\nIf you love your family, please stop buying Wavestorm surfboards.\n\nFor those who don’t know, Wavestorm is the inexpensive mass-produced surfboard sold at Walmart, Costco and Amazon that has become ubiquitous on beaches all over the world. They have become synonymous with the masses of newcomer surfers, particularly in California, who have changed the entire dynamic of the coastline. You see it here, but not to that extent.\n\nNow, my point is not about soft top surfboards. They serve a purpose. We have soft tops at our house. They help keep learners (and anyone around them) safe in the water. Great for beginners, kids and guests.\n\nThis isn’t a rant about Chinese-factory-made surfboards. While it’s always better to support the dying art of custom surfboard shapers, all soft tops are made on third-world assembly lines, but so, frankly, so are many high-performance boards today. And yeah, I do think it’s much better to buy any board from a mom-and-pop Island shop than a box store to support local. But that’s not the issue.\n\nThis isn’t about looking cool, local support, name brands or image. It’s simply a matter of hydrodynamics.\n\nObviously, there’s a lot of science and physics that goes into surfing; the higher the level and the more critical the wave, the more involved it gets. But there are also certain designs and shapes that work better for someone just bouncing around in the foam, and that Costco rider ain’t it. You see people out simply trying to ride whitewater, and those boards don’t have the right rocker, rails or general shape to even do that. They have way too much flex. On top of all that, they’re not even well made.\n\nOur Island surf shops all sell softies. Like them or not, they’ve become part of the bread and butter for surf retailers in the last 20 years; they’re not going anywhere. But pretty much all of them are better than that horrific Wavestorm. Do your family a favor and stop buying the Costco surfboard.\n\nBut what do I know? I can’t even figure out basic politics. The red hats have spent the last four years talking about how much they hate Joe Biden. They haven’t stopped telling us how Biden is the worst president ever. So, wouldn’t they be happy that he’s out of the race? I mean, they’ve been losing their minds making memes about how old and forgetful he is. And now there’s no chance he’ll be president again. Isn’t that what they wanted? Why are they still angry as hell? Maybe they’re just chafed that they spent all that money on those Let’s Go Brandon flags.\n\nWHAT’S GOING ON WITH THE TROPICS?: Hey, what was all that “craziest year ever” talk? Where’s all the activity? What about all that steaming hot water by the equator?”\n\nOK, careful with that talk.\n\nFirst off, it’s true. From the early-season outlooks, you’d have thought July would have seen a few more named storms and hurricanes. We’ve seen only three storms, which is about average in number. But if you look at another metric, the ACE Accumulated Cyclonic Energy – the power of the storm (Hurricane Beryl) and how long it maintained that strength – was through the roof. So it has already been a pretty wild season even if the D-named storm hasn’t developed by August.\n\nAt the start of the season, we compared the equatorial sea surface temps to an incredible amount of fuel. Now, just so there’s no confusion, yes, the surf temps here were bitter cold thanks to upwelling most of July. In fact, I read recently that 90% of the days from July 1 to July 22 were below the June average (June water is, on average, a good bit colder than July), to show just how cold it was. We had water temps more like May, or even late April. But the surf temps here and the water near the equator have nothing to do with each other. In terms of hurricane formation, it’s all about the hot tropics. In fact, even if a storm were to come near the East Coast, that upwelled cold water was so hyper-local to the coast that it would have no bearing on storm strength.\n\nSo, we’ve had all the fuel for the fire. And we have dry wood. We just didn’t have a match. That x-factor has been dry air and Saharan dust – that’s dust coming from the deserts of Africa, getting caught in the east-to-west current across the ocean, inhibiting any formation.\n\nLast week, a low-pressure system came off Africa and traveled across the ocean, but it never developed because of the dust. It does have the potential to do something now, however, on our side of the Atlantic.\n\nBut beyond that storm, it looks as if we have an upcoming pattern with less dust. That happens to also coincide with early August, where the tropics always come to life, then reach their historical climax in September. It could be a wild ride. While that doesn’t mean you need to lose your mind with anxiety, just consider some scenarios should they start spinning toward us.\n\nSURF CONDITIONS: The end of last week saw a pretty fun shot of southerly windswell with some longer-period groundswell. Last Wednesday was absolute glassy, warm, longboard heaven in the afternoon, and Thursday had even more juice, though it was more ragged.\n\nThe surf mostly fell off for the weekend, but a little 1-foot bump persisted for family fun on the sandbars. Again, warm water has really changed this summer for the better. The best thing I have seen all summer was the guy distance paddling a SUP on the outside with his dog on the board.\n\n“Hey, no dogs on the beach!”\n\n“We’re not on the beach ….”\n\nMonday saw significant swell from a low in the North Atlantic, but winds had too much southwest in them and then it went fully south.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH FOR THIS WEEK: The winds came up south Monday afternoon and have been blowing south and southwest since. Fortunately, I don’t see this being as miserable as the stretch of southerlies we had for those weeks of July.\n\nThe surf has been blown out and the water temp has dropped early week, but the wind has backed off at night, so at least we haven’t had the 24-hour blow. Surf temps will cool off a bit but not too bad, hopefully. The wind should go offshore for some better surf Thursday. You’ll probably need a suit again, though.\n\nNext weekend could see a touch more mid-period swell from the aforementioned tropical low. If it deepens a bit, it may send additional south swell our way. Keep in mind that low tide is in the middle of the day, so afternoons may be best, depending on the wind.\n\nIf the tropical low continues to develop late week (which is a very big “if” at this point), we could see anywhere from a little pulse to our first serious swell of the season. This all depends on the intensity and track, neither of which seemed too certain as we went to press.\n\nPADDLE PADDLE PADDLE: It never ceases to amaze me just how athletic this Island is every summer. From the Mile Swim to the Dog Day Race and the 2,987 lifeguard/LIT races each summer, folks love being out there and challenging themselves.\n\nThe history of paddle racing goes back to the 1920s, interwoven with the history of surfing. Tom Blake, the pioneer of hollow chamber boards, was making crafts for surf, paddle and lifesaving. Through the history of surfing, prone paddleboards were used for heavy wave training and had their own trajectory for beach patrol competitions.\n\nFor a while there, we couldn’t get enough paddle races on the Island. The increasing number of paddle events seemed to coincide with the rise of stand-up paddling in the early 2010s. These races were great because they were for all types of watermen. They were often dominated by lifeguards and former lifeguards, but surfers and general watermen would take part as well. But the growth of SUP eventually plateaued, and so, too, did the number of races. If anything, prone paddling is now on the rise. The single paddle race that has endured is the Barnegat Bay Challenge, hosted by the Ship Bottom Beach Patrol at the end of August each summer.\n\nBut South End Surf ’N Paddle’s Bekelja family is bringing back the LBI Paddle Classic, which the original shop owner, Ken Gallant, had created. It will be at Bayview Park this Saturday, Aug. 3.\n\nThere are two courses to choose from, a 2-mile and a 4-mile. And within those, there are three divisions – Women’s SUP, Men’s SUP and Prone. There are no board class distinctions. And while this will be a fun challenge for any waterman, waterwoman or distance athlete, it’s also a fun race for those who aren’t super serious about it, and any age. The race is $45 to enter and proceeds go to Family Promise, a local organization that supports Ocean County veterans and their families facing homelessness. Registration starts at 4:45 p.m.\n\nGLIDING INTO AUGUST: If you wish you could get back those weeks of July when the wind was vicious and the water freezing, you are not alone. But we can’t. All we can do is make the most of the weeks we have left. And if you’re still around after Labor Day, well, that’s a bonus.\n\nAs mentioned above, the LBI Paddle Classic is this Saturday at Bayview Park. Saturday also is the premiere of the New Jersey surf documentary “We’re Still Here,” at the Ocean City Music Pier, in Ocean City It examines the history and perhaps the future of surf culture in our state. The film starts at 8. No tickets are required, but seats may be limited. There are a handful of LBI surfers who were interviewed.\n\nSunday is the Sea Change Recovery Organization’s 100 Waves for Recovery event at the Wooden Jetty, from noon to 4 p.m. See the full feature in this issue.\n\nThe Fellowship of Christian Athletes LBI has held a few Surf Huddles this summer in Ship Bottom. The next one will be on Aug. 17 at 7 a.m. at 20th Street, waves and weather permitting. They also host Paddle Huddles at the Ship Bottom Boat Ramp every Sunday evening. Follow @fcasurflbinj for more info.\n\nIf you work in the restaurant biz and don’t get out much during the weekends, Bird & Betty’s Surf Night presented by Farias is Mondays. The festivities start at 9 with drink specials and music by your favorite Island surf/ska/reggae/rock outfit The Danksters. Farias will have giveaways this week from Billabong, RVCA and Electric. In addition, Kona Big Wave had South Jersey shaper Brian Wynn make a dozen surfboards for giveaways this summer. Each week, someone goes home with a new hand-shaped stick.\n\nAug. 10 is the Alliance for A Living Ocean LBI Longboard Classic, one of the most fun days of the year for local surf families. This is the day where everyone drags those big, 60s longboards out for waves and laughs at 68th Street in Brant Beach. It seems there may still be a few slots open. Get out there and have fun."
