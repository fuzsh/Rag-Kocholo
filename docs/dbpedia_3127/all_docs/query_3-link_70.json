Persistent stereotypes lead to invidious discrimination. The old-boy network protects its members. Access to capital can be limited. Competing demands often create self-doubt. All are troubling and should be eliminated. While progress has been made on that front, succeeding as a business owner remains more difficult for women.\n\nExperts explain why N.J.’s film industry is rapidly becoming statewide success story\n\nBrett Johnson, roi-nj.com\n\nBusiness leaders in New Jersey’s nascent film scene aren’t afraid of going off script. And, if you want their honest take, they might be ready to ditch the “nascent” adjective when talking about one of the state’s fastest-growing industries. That might have something to do with studio giant Lionsgate laying the groundwork for a 259,000-square-foot film and television complex in Newark; or Netflix’s promised $903 million studio at the former Fort Monmouth military base and the entertainment behemoth’s pledge to stay there for at least a decade.\n\nMore than 11,000 students learning English enrolled in Newark Public Schools\n\nJessie Gómez, NJ Spotlight\n\nEnglish language learners will make up more than a quarter of Newark’s Public School enrollment this school year, an increase over last year that points to a growing need for more teachers and services.

But while the Arrive Together program is ending its third year in New Jersey and state officials have rapidly expanded the program over the last year, it is still not available in nearly half of municipalities.\n\nNJ Transit’s free week has begun, hopefully many adventures will follow\n\nLA Parker, The Trentonian\n\nWith each stop of the River LINE hybrid rail train headed to Camden from Trenton, an automated voice alerted: “You must have a valid ticket to ride this train. Have your valid ticket ready for inspection.” Passengers smiled knowing that Monday kicked off a free week of travel on any New Jersey Transit mode of transportation.\n\n(Visited 529,464 times, 257 visits today)\n\nArticle Tags:\n\nInsider NJ\n\nMorning Intelligence Briefing\n\nClick here for the full Insider Index"
