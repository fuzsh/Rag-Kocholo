        "text": "How is Freedom different from other screen time apps?\n\nFreedom is the only app that can sync blocking sessions across all your devices. That means you can start a session on your desktop, but distracting apps on your mobile devices can be blocked too. Install Freedom wherever you need it, and enjoy some serious focus time.\n\nHow much does Freedom cost?\n\nFreedom is free to use with limited features. This is a great way to get started, and when you're ready to unlock the valuable Premium features, you'll have a variety of options. For just $40 per year (equivalent to one coffee per month), you can optimize your focus and embrace remarkably productive days.\n\nDoes Freedom block both apps and websites?\n\nAbsolutely. Customize your sessions to block any distraction, whether it's excessive tabs on your desktop browser or addictive apps like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, news, games, shopping, or gambling on your mobile devices. Freedom efficiently blocks apps and websites across a range of devices including iPhones, iPads, Mac computers, Windows computers, Android devices, and Chrome devices.\n\nWhat are some other cool Freedom features I should know about?\n\nDelighted you asked. Besides syncing across multiple platforms, Freedom offers comprehensive app blocking on desktops, website exceptions (block-all except for specified sites), and immersive focus sounds and music - including pomodoro sessions and exclusive tracks from Brain.fm. Additionally, you'll find loads of resources aimed at helping you understand and overcome the challenge of distractions.\n\nWhy should I believe you? Who else uses Freedom and gets these results?\n\nOK, we get it. Promising 2.5 hours of additional productive time every day requires some evidence. We're humbled by the massive worldwide response to Freedom, and proud to say that we're loved and used by top productivity leaders, professionals across fields, and frequently recommended in top press outlets. With over 3.5 million users worldwide, we're motivated by the global Freedom family. And speaking of trust, we take your privacy seriously. We don't track any personal user activity because your privacy matters to us."
