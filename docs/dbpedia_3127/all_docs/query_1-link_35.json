        "text": "The City of Deerfield Beach offers more than just sunbathing and people-watching. Our beach is ideal for all manner of water sports including swimming, bodyboarding, surfing, snorkeling, and fishing from our world-famous International Pier. Whether you are looking for high adventure on the waves, a romantic spot to watch the sunrise, or a protected swimming area for the kids, our beach has everything available for you. Come visit our \"Blue Wave\" award-winning beach and bask in the sun.\n\nPublic safety is Ocean Rescue's main concern. We protect a one-mile stretch of beach with nine lifeguard towers. The nine towers are located along the beach starting at the north end with Tower #1 and ending at the south end with Tower #9 situated directly in front of the Embassy Suites hotel. Lifeguards are present from 9:00 am until 5:00 pm, 365 days a year.\n\nThe Deerfield Beach Ocean Rescue Department is comprised of one Chief, two Captains, three Lieutenants, 14 full-time lifeguards, and 30 part-time guards. All Deerfield Beach personnel are American Red Cross and American Heart Association certified in lifeguard training and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We also have ten automated external defibrillators, one All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV), two Yamaha VX water vehicles with rescue sleds, one Zodiac boat, and eleven hand-held radios that are linked directly to the Broward County Sheriffs Office (BSO) and Deerfield Beach Fire Rescue. We want our guests to feel and know they are safe at all times on our beach.\n\nOur Ocean Rescue team is also certified by the United States Lifesaving Association. We are designated as an open water agency that has demonstrated a commitment to public safety in an open water environment.\n\nOcean Rescue is headquartered at 71 Ocean Way (SE 21st Ave.), on the 2nd Floor of the Fire Station. Guests can contact us for beach conditions by calling the following number (954) 480-4413. You can also check the home page of the Deerfield Beach website for a weather condition update."
