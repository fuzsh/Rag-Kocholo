        "text": "It was a battle on the beach for bragging rights, but local lifeguards weren’t going to give up the top spot this weekend on their own home turf (and surf).\n\nThe LA County Surf Life Saving Association took home the win, yet again, against hundreds of lifeguard competitors during the 46th annual USLA National Championship, held this year in Hermosa Beach.\n\nIt was the first time since 2016 the prestigious event was held in Hermosa Beach, and the only time before that was in 1993.\n\nThe three-day national championship tournament, like most other events, was canceled early in the pandemic and held last year in South Padre Island, Texas, where the LA team earned its 45th title and the coveted Howard Lee Trophy.\n\nThe reigning champs have now won the overall team championship 33 out of the past 35 years the competition has taken place. California State Lifeguard Association put up a strong challenge, finishing in second place.\n\n“We have a very deep roster and the very talented athletes on the L.A. County Surf Lifesaving Association team battled hard every day and consistently brought their ‘A’ game,” said Jay Butki, the association’s president, in a news release. “The California State Lifeguard Association team came to win, and they challenged us in every event. It was a hard-fought victory.”\n\nFort Lauderdale Ocean Rescue won the “B” Division Championship. Thomas O’Neill, from Riis Park in New York, earned the men’s overall winner and Fort Lauderdale’s Casey Francis won the women’s overall points title for the second consecutive year.\n\nThe competitors drew a crowd over the three days as they battled in the surf and on the sand, doing ocean swimming and paddleboard relays, rescue drills, sprints and the popular Dory boat races that tested their endurance and fitness.\n\nA day before the main event kicked off, 300 junior lifeguards from around the country gathered for the National Junior Lifeguard Championships on Aug. 10. Future lifeguarding hopefuls, ages 9 to 15, competed in various events in three age categories for individual titles — many from Los Angeles County earning wins."
