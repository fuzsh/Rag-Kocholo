        "text": "We are more than just red and yellow flags.\n\nEvery day, Surf Life Saving SA is on the front line, and behind the scenes, of coastal and water safety in South Australia. In addition to our iconic red and yellow flags on the beach, we provide emergency and rescue services, surf sport competition and training and education to the community, government and private companies. We believe that we can build stronger communities and safer beaches by taking a holistic approach to water safety:\n\nOur Beach and Water Patrols are there to keep beachgoers safe,\n\nTraining and Education teaches people to help themselves; and\n\nSurf Sports training and competition ensures our volunteer lifesavers are always in the physical and mental condition required to save lives\n\nRead more about our mission, vision and values in our 2020-23 Strategic Plan.\n\nEmergency & Rescue\n\nSurf Life Saving SA provides patrols at 21 locations between October and April each year. In addition to this, Surf Life Saving SA operate 24/7 response teams which include Rescue Water Craft (Jet-skis), Jet Rescue Boats and drone services, and members trained in search and rescue from all clubs.\n\nThe Westpac Lifesaver Rescue Helicopter Service operates between October and April, providing an eye in the sky for beachgoers.\n\nTraining & Education\n\nPeople are often surprised to learn that Surf Life Saving SA is a fully accredited training organisation (RTO 40110). But when you think about it, lifesaving and training are a perfect fit. We provide a range of professional courses to companies, government bodies and other groups. We have been passing on skills and wisdom for over 100 years.\n\nAs the leading provider of surf safety, we extend our educational activities to coastal, rural, indigenous and international community groups. We provide various programs and educational information through different means, including commercial advertising, school-based programs, peak body advice, awareness and self-survival courses, and educational tours.\n\nSurf Sport\n\nSurf lifesavers compete in surf sports competitions to demonstrate their physical and mental skills and abilities. Surf sports play a significant role in preparing surf lifesavers to meet the physical standards necessary for saving lives.\n\nCompetition officials and organisers conduct competitions to support and encourage lifesavers to demonstrate their knowledge and skill."
