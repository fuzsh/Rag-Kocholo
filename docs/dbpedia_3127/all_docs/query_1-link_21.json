        "text": "Here are some essential safety tips for private pools: 1. *Fencing*: Install a sturdy fence around the pool area, at least 4 feet tall, to prevent accidental entries. 2. *Gate and door alarms*: Secure gates and doors leading to the pool with alarms to alert you of unauthorized access. 3. *Supervise*: Always supervise children and inexperienced swimmers when they're in or around the pool. 4. *Swimming lessons*: Ensure all family members know how to swim or take lessons if needed. 5. *Pool rules*: Establish and enforce pool rules, such as no diving, no running, and no swimming alone. 6. *Safety equipment*: Keep rescue equipment like a shepherd's hook, life jackets, and a first aid kit nearby. 7. *Regular maintenance*: Regularly inspect and maintain the pool, its surroundings, and equipment to prevent hazards. 8. *Slip-resistant surfaces*: Use slip-resistant materials around the pool to prevent falls. 9. *Electrical safety*: Keep electrical appliances away from the pool, and avoid using them near water. 10. *Emergency preparedness*: Have a plan in case of emergencies, including knowing CPR and having a phone nearby. Remember, safety is everyone's responsibility!

We do not know the details of the investigation but what we do know is that the boat capsized, was damaged, people ended up in the water and a life was lost. Michael McElroy, CHSC President explains, “We need to use this opportunity to reflect on what it means to go boating. There is always an acceptable level of risk that we all take when going out on the water for pleasure or for your livelihood. It’s up to the operator and crew to manage that risk through situational awareness, education, and preparedness.” He further explains, “This includes safe loading and knowing the capacity of your vessel, proper outfitting with life jackets and required safety equipment. This is the time we really need to take stock of our ability to manage that risk and protect each other on the waterways. We must remind ourselves we carry the most precious cargo ever.” Want to be a better-informed boater? Take the Chicago Harbor Safety Committees safe boater quiz. Follow the QR code to the home page, click on the resources tab and select “Safe Boater Quiz” to get some great tips on how to safely navigate the Chicago area waterways. Please be safe out there. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Lorenzo Tobin. Resources: CHSC https://lnkd.in/gkXGsYW4 Boaters Resource Guide to Safe Boating in Chicago PDF\n\nHello Aquatics Enthusiasts!
