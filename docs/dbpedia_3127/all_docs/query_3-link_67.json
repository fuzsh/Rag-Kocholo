        "text": "See the Embassy of Costa Rica’s website for the most current visa information.\n\nRequirements for Entry:\n\nPassport valid for duration of stay. Immigration may deny entry if passport is damaged.\n\nReturn ticket or proof of onward travel to another country.\n\nProof of yellow fever vaccination if you are arriving from certain countries in South America or Africa.\n\nProof of funds for at least $100 USD per month of proposed stay.\n\nTourist stays up to 180 Days: Authorities may permit stays up to 180 days without a visa but are not required to do so. Be sure to leave by your required date of departure. Immigration authorities may levy a fine on foreigners who overstay their visas. Even a short overstay may result in significant delays, deportation, and/or denial of entry to Costa Rica in the future.\n\nExit tax: Check with your airline to see if the $29 USD exit tax was included in the cost of your ticket. For more information, visit the Costa Rican Immigration Agency website.\n\nEntry and Exit for Minor Children: All children born in Costa Rica acquire Costa Rican citizenship at birth and must have an exit permit issued by immigration authorities in order to depart the country. Non-Costa Rican minor children who are ordinarily resident in Costa Rica may also be subject to this requirement. This is strictly enforced.\n\nThough not required, parents traveling with minor children may consider carrying notarized consent for travel from the non-present parent. Parents of minors with Costa Rican citizenship should consult with Costa Rican immigration authorities prior to travel to Costa Rica.\n\nIndebtedness: If you owe money in Costa Rica, authorities may prevent you from leaving. This includes unsettled injury claims from vehicular accidents and unpaid medical bills. U.S. citizens owing child support in Costa Rica may be required to pay 13 months of support in advance before being allowed to leave Costa Rica.\n\nDocumentation Requirements: Carry copies of identification and immigration status at all times. During routine checks for illegal immigrants, authorities may ask to see the original passport and papers.\n\nLocal authorities have the right to detain United States citizens until their identity and immigration status have been verified.\n\nHIV/AIDS restrictions: The United States Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Costa Rica.\n\nFind information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction, and customs information on our websites.\n\nCrime: In areas frequented by tourists, including national parks, theft and pickpocketing are the most common crimes targeting United States citizen travelers. More violent crimes, including sexual assault and murders, have occurred. Armed assailants usually target victims for their smartphones, wallets, or purses. If confronted by someone with a weapon, it is best not to resist.\n\nDo not leave valuables unattended on the beach, in an unattended vehicle, or in an unlocked room. Even a locked vehicle in an area with parking attendants may be broken into. Avoid isolated areas when on foot, especially after dark. Maintain situational awareness and secure your valuables out of sight.\n\nThe Embassy is aware of reports of robbery of isolated rental properties. Research any rental homes to ensure they have adequate security and remember to properly secure all doors and windows.\n\nSee the Costa Rica Country Security Report (osac.gov) for an overview of crime in Costa Rica. For information about international financial scams, see the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.\n\nVictims of Crime: United States citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the United States Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the United States Embassy at +506 2519-2000 or acssanjose@state.gov. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. Authorities will only investigate and prosecute a crime if the victim files a police report (denuncia). The Costa Rican Investigative Police (OIJ) is responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes that occur in Costa Rica.\n\nTo file a police report: Visit the local office of the OIJ. You can find the closest location by calling 800-800-3000. The Tourist Police can also take reports at the following tourist destinations:\n\nTamarindo\n\nFlamingo\n\nPuerto Viejo\n\nGuiones\n\nDominical\n\nEl Coco See our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nU.S. Embassy San Jose can:\n\nHelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nAssist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\nContact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nProvide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion\n\nProvide a list of local attorneys\n\nProvide information on victim’s compensation programs in the U.S.\n\nProvide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nHelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nReplace a stolen or lost passport\n\nA police report with a case number is necessary for case follow up, insurance claims, and waiving of rebooking fees on certain airlines. Check with airlines regarding their rebooking policies.\n\nBeach Safety: Swimming areas at some popular beaches around Costa Rica can have dangerous rip currents. Some beaches lack lifeguards or warnings of unsafe conditions. United States citizens have died in Costa Rica due to these dangers. Check the Costa Rica Tourism Institute (ICT) website, or with your hotel or relevant tour operator to request current information on local swimming and surf conditions. You can read more about staying safe on Costa Rican beaches in this ICT pamphlet, which is in English and Spanish. Please be aware that the Costa Rica Tourism Institute confirms that there are trained lifeguards at the following beaches:\n\nPacific Coast:\n\nManuel Antonio Beach Caldera Beach\n\nEsterillos Oeste Beach\n\nBahia Ballena Beach\n\nVentanas Beach\n\nTamarindo Beach\n\nCaribbean Coast:\n\nCocles Beach\n\nManzanillo Beach\n\nNegra Beach (Limon)\n\nThe Oceanographic Information Module at the Center for Research in Marine Sciences of the University of Costa Rica provides public information regarding wind and wave forecasts, including warnings of hazardous conditions. You can learn more about the dangers of rip currents and how to avoid them from the NOAA National Weather Service's Rip Current webpage.\n\nDo not dive into water of unknown depth. Do not swim alone, especially at isolated beaches. Avoid the consumption of alcohol while swimming.\n\nTourism: The Costa Rica Tourism Institute (ICT) website maintains a list of Certified Tour Guides. You can also find valuable tourism safety and security information for Costa Rica in these English and Spanish language pamphlets provided by ICT.\n\nAdventure Sports: Some tour operators take risks, and government regulation and oversight of firms that organize sporting activities may not always adhere to international standards and best practices. United States citizens have died in Costa Rica while participating in adventure sports. Use caution and common sense when engaging in ALL adventure sports, such as bungee jumping, sky diving, hiking, rappelling, climbing, whitewater rafting, kayaking, etc. Make sure your medical insurance covers your sport. See our section on Medical Insurance under “Health” below. The Ministry of Health maintains a list of authorized Adventure Sports operators.\n\nNever participate in adventure sports alone. Always carry identification and let others know where you are at all times. Before kayaking and rafting, check river conditions and wear a life jacket and helmet. Even popular rafting locations such as the Rio Naranjo near Quepos can become extremely dangerous in flash flood conditions. When hiking, rappelling, or climbing, carry a first aid kit and know the location of the nearest rescue center. Observe all local or park regulations and exercise caution in unfamiliar surroundings.\n\nDomestic Violence: United States citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\n\nStudents and Volunteers: Violent assaults, rapes, and deaths have occurred involving students and volunteers. Ensure that your organization provides safety and security information on the area where you will stay. See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips. To register complaints: Contact Costa Rica’s Tourism Commission or by phone at 800-TURISMO from Costa Rica or 011-506-2299-5800 from the United States. Email:contactenos@ict.go.cr\n\nPotential for Natural Disasters: Costa Rica is in an active earthquake and volcanic zone.\n\nThree volcanoes, two near San Jose and one in the northwest, have become more active in recent years. Ashfall due to volcanic eruptions from Turrialba can disrupt air traffic and cause or aggravate respiratory issues. Visitors should monitor and follow park service guidance and alerts regarding volcanic activity. Never attempt to climb or gain unauthorized access to an active volcano.\n\nTsunamis may occur following significant earthquakes.\n\nFlooding occurs during the rainy season, typically from April until October, in the Caribbean Province of Limon and the Pacific Provinces of Puntarenas and Guanacaste.\n\nFlash floods and severe landslides occur in many parts of Costa Rica, depending on the time of year and rainfall. Do not drive into water of unknown depths.\n\nFor information concerning disasters, see:\n\nU.S. Embassy Costa Rica website. The Embassy also sends out emergency information via e-mail, text, and/or Radio Dos (FM 99.5) or Radio Columbia (FM 98.7.)\n\nU.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides general information about natural disaster preparedness\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides information regarding disease.\n\nU.S. Geological Survey provides updates on recent seismic and volcanic activity.\n\nAdditional information regarding volcanic activity and other natural disasters in Costa Rica may be obtained from the following Spanish-language Costa Rican websites:\n\nCosta Rican National Emergency Commission\n\nCosta Rican Volcanic and Seismic Observatory\n\nDemonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Strikes may affect transportation, fuel supplies, and other public services. Local law prohibits foreigners from participating in public demonstrations, and violators may be subject to detention or deportation.\n\nEven demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly become violent.\n\nAvoid areas around protests and demonstrations.\n\nCheck local media for updates and traffic advisories.\n\nHiking: When visiting national parks, abide by signage and stick to marked trails. First responders have limited ability to locate missing persons in remote areas.\n\nTo hike in national parks, you must:\n\nRegister with the park\n\nObtain an entry permit\n\nConsider using a certified tour operator. The Costa Rican Tourist Institute (ICT) has contact information for Certified Tour Guides.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated, and rules are regularly enforced. Inspections take place on a regular basis; however, some lapses may occur in businesses that are not properly registered. Hazardous areas or activities are not always identified with appropriate signage. Professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is available but may be delayed due to road and traffic conditions as well as physical distances. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. United States citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\n\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nThe Embassy is aware of isolated reports of uniformed officers or impostors demanding a bribe. Should you be confronted for a bribe, do not argue. Note the name of the officer and any identifying numbers on the uniform or vehicle and report the incident by calling “911.”\n\nAyahuasca/Kambo/Hallucinogens: Traditional hallucinogens, often referred to as ayahuasca or kambo, are often marketed to travelers as part of a “ceremony” or “spiritual cleansing.” Such substances typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong hallucinogen that is illegal in the United States and many other countries.\n\nIntoxicated travelers, including United States citizens, have been sexually assaulted, injured, or robbed while under the influence of these substances.\n\nHealth risks associated with ayahuasca are not well understood, and, on occasion, United States citizens have suffered serious illness or death after taking these drugs.\n\nThese incidents often occur in remote areas far away from modern medical facilities, increasing the risks.\n\nAlcohol/Drugs: Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs could land you immediately in jail. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs are severe, including long jail sentences and heavy fines. The possession, purchase, and sale of marijuana and marijuana related products are illegal in Costa Rica\n\nProstitution/Sex Tourism: Local law forbids promoting or facilitating the prostitution of another person. Local laws regarding human trafficking and child exploitation carry extremely harsh penalties, including large fines and significant jail time, including for first-time offenders.\n\nArrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the United States Embassy immediately. See our webpage for further information.\n\nThe law permits pre-trial detention of persons accused of serious crimes. Due to overcrowding in local prisons, courts may instead use an “exit impediment.” Individuals subject to these measures cannot depart Costa Rica, must be able to support themselves, and must check in with judicial authorities on a regular basis. Defendants have the right to a public defender and an official translator for important hearings.\n\nJudicial Process: Due to differences in legal systems and case backlogs, local criminal and civil judicial processes can move slower in comparison to their United States equivalents. Civil suits on average take over five years to resolve. Some United States firms and citizens have satisfactorily resolved their cases through the courts, while others have seen proceedings drawn out over a decade without a final ruling.\n\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Department of Justice website for more information.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country reports\n\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTI Travelers: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGBTI events in Costa Rica. See our LGBTI Travel Information page and section 6 of our Human Rights report for further details.\n\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Accessibility and accommodation are limited. Many buildings remain inaccessible and the Costa Rican Ombudsman’s Office has received several noncompliance reports regarding accessibility or malfunctioning of hydraulic wheelchair lifts for public transportation.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nResidency: United States citizens seeking to live or reside long-term in Costa Rica should consider seeking local legal counsel for guidance on the requirements to obtain legal residency. Local authorities have imposed limited entry permits or deported United States citizens suspected of improperly using their tourist status to live in Costa Rica.\n\nReal Estate: Be extremely cautious when making real estate purchases or investments, consult with reputable legal counsel, and thoroughly review the contract. There is little the United States Embassy can do to assist United States citizens who enter into land or business disputes; you must be prepared to take your case to the local courts.\n\nCivil archives recording land titles are at times incomplete or contradictory. Coastal land within 50 meters of the high tide line is open to the public and therefore closed to development. The next 150 meters inland (“Maritime Zone”) cannot be owned by foreign nationals. Land in this zone is administered by the local municipality. Expropriation of private land by the Costa Rican government without compensation considered adequate or prompt has affected some United States investors.\n\nProperty owners are encouraged to maintain security and access controls on any private property. Organized squatter groups have invaded properties, taking advantage of legal provisions that allow people without land to gain title to unused property. Victims of squatters have reported threats, harassment, and violence.\n\nCheck the Embassy’s website for a list of local lawyers.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers.\n\nFor emergency services in Costa Rica, dial 911.\n\nAmbulance services are widely available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below United States standards.\n\nMedical care in San Jose is generally adequate, but services can be limited in areas outside of San Jose. In remote areas, basic medical equipment may not be available. Ambulances may lack emergency equipment.\n\nMost prescription and over-the-counter medications are available; however, some United States citizens travel regularly to the United States to fill prescriptions that are unavailable locally. Bring a supply of your medications and carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.\n\nWe do not pay medical bills. Be aware that United States Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept United States health insurance.\n\nMedical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information on types of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\n\nCosta Rican immigration authorities reserve the right to prevent departure of those international travelers with unpaid or disputed medical bills.\n\nThe United States Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals on our Embassy website. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\n\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Costa Rican Ministry of Health to ensure the medication is legal in Costa Rica.\n\nVaccinations: Be up-to-date on all vaccinations recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nProof of yellow fever vaccination must be presented upon arrival for all passengers coming from certain countries in South America or Africa.\n\nMedical Tourism: Confirm that:\n\nFacilities and professionals will be able to provide an acceptable level of care\n\nYour insurance will cover any associated or emergency costs\n\nYou understand the terms of payment and costs for treatment\n\nFor clinics offering alternative medical treatments, thoroughly research these clinics and their providers. The Embassy has received reports of hospitalizations as a result of clients at so-called wellness centers undergoing medically unverified “alternative treatments.”\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. An air ambulance flight can cost $25,000 to $50,000 USD and will often take place only after payment has been received in full.\n\nFurther health information:\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nAir Quality: Visit AirNow Department of State for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\n\nHealth facilities in general:\n\nAdequate health facilities are available throughout Costa Rica but health care in rural areas may be below United States standards.\n\nHospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Credit card payment is not always available. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.\n\nPrivate hospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.\n\nMedical staff may speak little or no English.\n\nGenerally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.\n\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery: United States citizens have suffered serious complications or died during or after having cosmetic or other elective surgery.\n\nMedical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling.\n\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Costa Rica.\n\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.\n\nYour legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Costa Rica.\n\nAlthough Costa Rica has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Costa Rica, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified.\n\nPharmaceuticals: Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with few controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, be the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.\n\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration websites for more information.\n\nCosta Rica does not allow the importation of most medications through the mail, even with a prescription. Travelers entering Costa Rica may carry personal medications with them and in suitcases, but also should carry a copy of the prescriptions. Medications should be in original packaging, and quantities should correspond to the prescription. Please review Costa Rica’s rules on importing medication at the Ministry of Health website.\n\nAlcohol: If you choose to drink alcohol, it is important to do so in moderation and to stop and seek medical attention if you begin to feel ill. There have been reports of individuals falling ill or dying after consuming alcohol tainted with methanol. Costa Rica’s Ministry of Health has advised any persons presenting health issues after consuming alcohol, such as severe vomiting, agitation, disorientation, blindness, or any other adverse reactions, to immediately call 911. Ministry of Health authorities are asking people to report any instances of the sale of unregulated alcohol or alcohol adulterated with methanol to the Judicial Investigation Organization (OIJ) confidential line at 800-8000-645, or by email to denuncias.drpis@misalud.go.cr, or by calling the National Center for Intoxicants at 2223-1028 or 800-INTOXICA (4686-9422). Additionally, if you feel you have been the victim of unregulated alcohol or another serious health violation, you should notify the American Citizen Services unit at the U.S. Embassy in San Jose at +506-2519-2000. You may also contact the U.S. Department of State – Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington, D.C. at 1-888-407-4747 (toll-free in the United States and Canada) or 1-202-501-4444 (from all other countries) from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).\n\nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy: If you are considering traveling to Costa Rica to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our ART and Surrogacy Abroad page.\n\nWater Quality: In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.\n\nAdventure Travel: Visit the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Adventure Travel.\n\nGeneral Health Language: The following diseases are prevalent:\n\nDengue\n\nChikungunya\n\nHIV/AIDS: Follow all standard procedures for protection against the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n\nVisit the UUnited States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about Resources for Travelers regarding specific issues in Costa Rica\n\nAir Quality: The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:\n\nInfants, children, and teens\n\nPeople over 65 years of age\n\nPeople with lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema.\n\nPeople with heart disease or diabetes\n\nPeople who work or are active outdoors"
