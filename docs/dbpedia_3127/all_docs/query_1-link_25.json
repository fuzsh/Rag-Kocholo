The WLS was founded on 24 March, 1971 in Cronulla, Australia. The constitution came into effect on 14 June 1977 with a formal agreement between the foundation nations: Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.\n\nThe World Life Saving was founded for the purpose of establishing educational marine safety and aquatic programmes on a people-to-people basis.\n\nOn 24 February 1993, the WLS merged with the FIS to form the International Life Saving Federation (ILS).
