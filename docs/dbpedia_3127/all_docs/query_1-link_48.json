Also, most importantly, I get to see my grandmother, with my father, one more time before I graduate college.\"\n\nThe International Surf Rescue Challenge (ISRC) is a competition between Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, USA, Great Britain and Japan. It is based around three tests, which includes swim, surf board, surf ski and beach events.
