        "text": "After a year of challenges on the beaches and in the funding environment, there is much to celebrate in the Surf Life Saving arena. The best of which will be showcased at the 2023-24 Toyota Financial Services Awards of Excellence on Saturday 17 August.\n\nThe annual awards evening will see lifeguards transplanted from their usual coastal habitats to the Auckland War Memorial Museum in Auckland, putting the spotlight on a year of heroics and recognising member achievements at the highest level.\n\nSurf Life Saving Northern Region General Manager Zac Franich says the night is a much-awaited opportunity to showcase the tremendous work of clubs and individuals, celebrate the achievements of the year, and honour the exceptional contributions of the surf lifesaving community.\n\n“The Toyota Financial Services Awards of Excellence are an important reminder of the importance of Surf Life Saving to the country and the great debt we all owe to our lifeguards. We have so much to be celebrating this year, including our first full sports season since Covid-19, and whilst one night isn’t enough to celebrate all our lifeguards have achieved, we are all thrilled at the opportunity to take a moment to recognise greatness before setting our sights on the year ahead,” he says.\n\n“Once again lifeguards put in a colossal amount of work this season to make sure the public were safe and well educated on our coastlines, putting in more than 58,000 volunteer hours, equating to almost 34 hours average for each active member – nearly a full working week for some. These individuals were also called upon to partake in the 70 after-hours Search and Rescue operations this season.\n\nAlongside the above, there are countless members facilitating lifeguard training, coaching and running the clubs that keep the operations ticking. The night will be a great opportunity to let them know how grateful we are.”\n\nAcross the seasons, Northern Region lifeguards saved a total of 283 lives with an additional 486 assisted to safety. 22,242 preventative actions were taken, allowing 173,236 beachgoers to return safely home. Guards attended to 97 major first-aids and 705 minor first-aids, with 91 searches.\n\nJournalist and television presenter Mike McRoberts is the MC for the awards night and will announce the recipients for major regional awards including Lifeguard of the Year, Club of the Year, Rescue of the Year, and Volunteer of the Year.\n\nIn the sporting arena, the Supreme Sport Award, Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year, and Team of the Year awards will recognise sporting achievements at the very highest level.\n\nTribute will also be made to individuals with a long-standing commitment to the movement through Service, Distinguished Service Awards and Life Memberships awards.\n\nSurf Life Saving Northern Region is the largest of the Surf Life Saving regions in New Zealand, covering Auckland to the Far North, and as far south as Raglan.
