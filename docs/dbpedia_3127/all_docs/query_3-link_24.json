        "text": "Released in 2020 the Wave Safe Film series was produced by NOAA's Ocean Today while the series was written and hosted by Bruckner Chase to address the challenge of educating communities visiting or living along the diverse coastlines of the United States as well as our international communities that share a similar connection to our oceans and coasts. The series was filmed over two years from the Jersey Shore to the village fo Aunu'u in American Samoa and is now available as a downloadable resource through NOAA.\n\nAdditional assets now include \"Wave Safe\" posters made from recycled ocean bound plastics that also include embedded technology that can instantly link users to specific coastal and ocean resources.\n\nIn development is a new \"Wave Safe - Live to Be the Hero\" training programs that teach basic surf life saving knowledge and skills to the non-professional rescuer that may include conservationists, tourists, swimmers, parents, surfers, triathletes, divers, or anyone who spends time along any coastline from the Great Lakes to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Blue Journey Unified (BJU) program brings together communities of people with and without Spinal Cord Injuries and Disease (SCI/D) for open-water recreation, fitness, and competition through the removal of physical and social barriers that also provide a sustainable impact on quality of life and the development of community. Currently the program provides weekly outdoor, open water sessions from April through September and weekly pool sessions throughout the year. The program also coordinates additional one on one training sessions for our athletes with SCI/D who are involved in competition.\n\nProne paddleboarding, kayaking and open water swimming are globally practiced activities that are all components of international surf lifesaving sports as well as being individual aquatic sport disciplines practiced at open water venues around the world. In prone paddleboarding participants lie down face first on special race boards and move through the water using their hands and arms. The sport provides a unique opportunity for people with SCI/D to participate in an activity with minimal need for adapted equipment or accommodation. When people with and without SCI/D paddle next to each other it is virtually impossible to discern who arrived at the beach in a wheelchair. The inclusion of racing kayaks known as surf skis provide those who may have physical barriers to laying down prone or who prefer a different activity the chance to enhance their strength, endurance and balance that allows them to explore local waters side by side with those with and without SCI/D. Swimming is recognized as a valuable rehabilitation and exercise modality for anyone with or without a physical challenge. The addition of open water opportunities with professional coaches allows participants to immerse themselves in an outdoor activity that also frees them from many limitations they may find on land.\n\nThe Toa o le Tai {“Heroes of the Tides”} program supports American Samoa, similar insular territories and remote island nations in becoming global standards for resilient, healthy, safe and thriving coastal communities with the knowledge, skill and access to resources that will benefit multiple facets of their unique coastal lives. A core value is the embracement of existing cultural strengths towards strengthening social and economic capacity. “Fa’a Samoa” or the Samoan Way is part of a 3,000-year cultural connection to the islands and oceans of American Samoa. The core of this philosophy is a commitment to protect family, community and place and shows a tremendous potential to shape how remote coastal communities recognize their capacity as global leaders in a movement to positively impact our oceans while empowering individuals to become influencers in our collective quest for a higher quality of life and standard of health. The aquatic protective factors the program creates will also enable local communities to protect themselves from hazardous ocean conditions and potential drownings. The training, fitness and sport components of the program will help improve the individual health and quality of life for all participants. Immediately viable with minimal external resource needs, the physical training components utilizes the most valuable natural resource surrounding the island and connects participants to the global community of ocean and surf lifesaving athletes. Based on past initiatives working in American Samoa with adults and youth the new athletes have the potential to excel on the regional and international arena. In its first responder components the Toa o le Tai program trains and teaches members of the local Departments of Public Safety and members of the villages to enhance their strength, proficiency and water confidence as first responders to protect the community and environment. The Department of Public Safety and the villages already embody a commitment to the program’s target impact areas, yet they lack simple and ongoing access to global training tools and knowledge due to the remoteness of the community, shortage of financial resources and lack of interest and awareness from the rest of the world. At its core, the Toa o le Tai program is a strength based, mentoring approach to program design. The participants / trainees become the trainers and role models to their peers and youth creating an economically sustainable, scalable and community driven program which is a symbiotic merger of social and environmental positive change at the village, Territory, Pacific Region and international level."
