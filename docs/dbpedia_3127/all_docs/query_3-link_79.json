        "text": "Frying Pan Tower™ was erected in 1964 to help ships avoid running aground the shallow waters known as the Frying Pan Shoals. The Coast Guard staffed the light station until 1979, when the beacon was automated. After 28 years of operation, the US Coast Guard Light Station went dark and slowly fell into disrepair due to the advent of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and radar. It was officially retired in 1992, rendered obsolete and for all purposes abandoned.\n\nResponsible for saving countless lives at sea, today the tower offers safety for mariners in the Atlantic Ocean, serves as a natural ecosystem for marine wildlife, and provides a location for numerous research and educational institutions to conduct environmental and oceanic studies.\n\nThe restoration of Frying Pan Tower is managed by FPTower Inc., a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to restoring, protecting and preserving the former United States Coastguard (USCG) Light Station off the coast of North Carolina for future generations."
