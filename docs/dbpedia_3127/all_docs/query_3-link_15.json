        "text": "National Motor Lifeboat School\n\nThe National Motor Lifeboat School (NMLBS) is a unique U.S. Coast Guard training center that operates under the Office of Boat Forces (Commandant G-OCS). With a staff of approximately 60 personnel, it serves as a center of excellence for the Motor Lifeboat (MLB) platform. The NMLBS provides \"C\" school resident training as well as MLB Readiness and Standardization assessments. We are located near the mouth of the Columbia River at Cape Disappointment just outside of Ilwaco, Washington. The area, known as the \"Graveyard of the Pacific,\" provides the training grounds for Coast Guard personnel learning to care for and operate the 47-foot MLB.\n\nCourses\n\n47' MLB Introduction\n\nThe 47’ MLB Introduction Course is designed to assist perspective 47' MLB Coxswains in the coxswain qualification process. The course will provide the trainee with classroom instruction and practical hands-on experience on a 47’ MLB. Specific areas of instruction include boat specifications, engineering and electrical systems, outfit and storage, boat handling, towing, operational risk assessment, and basic piloting and navigation. Successful completion of this course will provide a solid baseline understanding of the 47’ MLB and greatly assist in the Coxswain qualification process.\n\n47' Heavy Weather Coxswain\n\nThis course provides advanced level training for Coast Guard personnel permanently assigned to 47’ MLB units who will be required to perform the duties of a Heavy Weather Coxswain. This course will train certified 47’ MLB coxswains to perform risk assessment, basic engineering casualty control procedures, advanced operating skills for heavy weather boat handling and towing consistent with Coast Guard policy and standards.\n\n47' MLB Surfman\n\nThis course is an advanced, master-level training course. It is designed to qualify as MLB Surfman those CG personnel who are already certified 47’ MLB heavy weather Coxswains assigned to 47’ MLB surf stations. With the exception of Team Coordination Training (TCT), there is very limited classroom/knowledge-based portion of this course - it is comprised almost entirely of skill-based performance objectives, based on previously obtained and proven knowledge.\n\nCREED\n\nOf the United States\n\nSURFMAN\n\nI will to the best of my ability, pursue each\n\nmission with the commitment, compassion,\n\nand courage inherent in the title\n\n\"SURFMAN.\"\n\nI will endeavor to reinforce the worldwide\n\nreputation of our forefathers in the\n\nLifeboat Community.\n\nI will maintain a guardian's eye on my crew\n\nat all times, and keep a cool, yet\n\ndeliberate, hand on the throttle.\n\nI will give of myself and my knowledge as\n\nthose who gave to me; so as the line\n\nof Coast Guard Surfman will live forever.\n\nI will ensure that my supervisors rest easy\n\nwith the knowledge that I am at the\n\nhelm, no matter what the conditions.\n\nI will never unnecessarily jeopardize myself,\n\nmy boat, or my crew; but will do so freely\n\nto rescue those in peril.\n\nI will strive with dedication and determination\n\nto bring credit upon Coast Guard Surfmen\n\npast and future.\n\nCoast Guard Employee Access\n\nIt is recommended each Coast Guard employee visit TCYorktown's Portal site for additional training information.
