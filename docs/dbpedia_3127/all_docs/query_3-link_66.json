        "text": "Ronnie Ayres 1986-1997, 99, 02, 06, 08\n\nThousands of lifeguards have served the beach in Wildwood Crest, but it takes a certain kind of person to leave a lasting legacy like the one left by Ronnie Ayres. Having worked in the three different decades, Ron was able to make an impact on the beach patrol and the countless number of guards he worked with along the way. We are happy to be able to share with you some of Ronnie's stories from his time on the beach as well as the exciting life experiences he's had after the Crest.\n\nWhat made you join the beach patrol?\n\nTemple University Swim Coach, Tom Popdan said it would be a good way to get in shape for the college season.\n\nWhat are some of your best memories from your years with the WCBP?\n\nTraining for the events, swimming, paddling, rowing and the time spent on the water. The camaraderie with the guards and the cast of characters that have worn the orange and blue.\n\nTell us about your life after the beach.\n\nFrom ‘86 to ‘89, working the beach flowed perfectly with college and after the ‘89 summer I moved to Encinitas in Southern California and was fortunate to grab a Lieutenant position with the Encinitas Lifeguard Service. Protecting the Encinitas Beaches on 24 hour call year round included all the water in the city. So besides large surf rescues and cliff falls and boating emergencies, we were also responsible for the rivers which would occasionally flood and you know people love to try to drive across flooded rivers.\n\nLots of sketchy action in those days, with some highlights being jumping out of a Coast Guard helicopter into the ocean and a river rescue where I launched off the roof of a fire truck that put me in position to save 2 people standing on the roof of their pickup in a flash flood. In 1991 we were the first the agency in California to utilize wave runners for rescue scenarios and trained with the Hawaiian Lifeguards who had just begun to implement them. But after a couple years, I decided to move back East and found a situation that put me back on the beach patrol for a few more years.\n\nAfter the summer of '97 I moved to Maui and found my skills were needed in the restaurant and wine industry on the island. Working for some of the most iconic spots in Hawaii, Roy's and Mama's Fish House as Wine Buyer and sommelier being the most notable stints. Evening schedules left the daytime open for time in the water and exploring the beautiful island of Maui.\n\nI quickly became involved with racing Outrigger Canoes with a couple of the notorious canoe clubs on Maui and training for and racing in the World Championship race, 42 miles from Molokai to Oahu became an obsession. Becoming familiar with the Hawaiian Islands from a seat in an Outrigger Canoe is impossible to describe. I was fortunate to have teammates and friends around me who had the same passion for adventure and between surfing and racing canoes in the islands I learned a lot real fast.\n\nIn 2007, I took a year away from the food and beverage scene to work on a performance sailing catamaran which finally satisfied one of the reasons I moved to the islands. But again came the itch to make a change and after “One More Summer” on the Crest beach patrol in 2008, this time it was Lake Tahoe in Northern California.\n\nIt was an exciting time and in 2010, as co-owner, I opened a Cafe/ Standup Paddleboard rental and retail shop on the water in North Lake Tahoe called Watermans Landing. We developed programs that I wanted to imitate the Junior Lifeguard programs I knew from the Crest Beach and it worked. We became a headquarters for paddling in Tahoe, bought our own outrigger canoe, started the Junior Waterman program and built a great seasonal business that still kills it!\n\nAt that same time I began racing Standup Paddleboards and aligned with the brand, Tahoe SUP, first as a sponsored racer but I also quickly became an employee, getting involved with the marketing efforts. Writing copy, content and running social media, grew into helping direct the brands image and sales. The sport was pretty new and Tahoe SUP had introduced the first boards built specifically for touring and paddling longer distances as the the industry had only seen oversized surfboards till then.\n\nThe racing scene got me traveling around the country, representing the brand and supporting our growing dealer base. In 2012 we developed a marketing concept called EXPLORE Project, which myself and an a couple other team members traveled to numerous paddling destinations with film crews and made short films about the adventure and the locations. To say the least, it was a ton of fun, paddling new zones, contributing to the production of the projects, writing stories about the trips for industry magazines and meeting people from all over the place.\n\nOver this past year, I have been spending more time on the East Coast, closer to home and it's been great to be around my old friends and of course, spending time in the Crest around my travel. You might have seen the LXV Outdoor sprinter van I frequently drive, parked around the island. LXV is the parent company now for the 3 paddle board brands, Tahoe SUP, KM Hawaii, and Fish Stalker.\n\nHow has the beach patrol impacted your life?\n\nSo many ways. But one for sure is having an understanding of life threatening moments and having the ability to do something about it. It has come in handy many times over, in the ocean and out.\n\n​\n\nIt was always fun to come back to the beach patrol and jump right into the lifeguard race scene. The level of the athletes within the Crest beach alone always created an intense but friendly environment of competition. With the likes of Bic Murphy, Joe Maloy, Terry McGovern, John Maloy and many more, the Crest was always considered a contender on any Friday night race in South Jersey. Putting in the time on the water to prepare for rowing, surf dashing, paddling and swimming races is always what I miss most about guarding.\n\nThe friendships I have made there will last my whole life.\n\nWhat advice would you give a young guard today?\n\nAbsorb as much knowledge as you can from veteran guards and keep your eyes on the water. It also has much to teach you.\n\nMatthew Donahue: 1985 - 1990\n\nDependable, courageous, humble, and diligent. These are some of the qualities that the Wildwood Crest Beach Patrol looks for in their candidates each year. Alumnus, Matthew Donahue was a guard that optimized what it meant to serve on the beach. He has taken valuable lessons learned during his years with the WCBP and has applied them to his life after the Crest. We are excited that Matthew has been so kind as to share some of his experiences from his time as a Wildwood Crest lifeguard.\n\n​\n\nWhat made you join the beach patrol?\n\nThe challenge of being on such a respected beach patrol and to have the experience of doing something gratifying for summer work that wasn't just for the money but to create life experiences and being around like minded people that pushed physical activity and competition.\n\nWhat are some of your best memories from your years with the WCBP?\n\nI think one of the best memories I have of the WCBP was that I opened the door and opportunity for three of my brothers to follow me on the beach patrol. Have always been proud of the fact that for one weekend we were all able to guard together on the beach thanks to the Captain letting me come back a guest guard the Labor Day weekend!\n\nDoing the around the island row approximately 8 times with 4 different guards (my brother Glenn, Dave Lindsey, Tom Fredricks, and Linda Kelly.\n\nThe workouts in the morning were always fun and the camaraderie with the other guards and busting chops was great.\n\nBeing able to row the van dyne boat through the pylons under the pier near Cresse Ave when Buddy wasn't looking and when there was actually water under the pier then!!!!\n\nGoing to the race track in AC with Joe Maloy and all the other bad influential Beach tent crew, losing my shirt from bets and have way too much fun on the bus ride up and back and Buddy making us run the rock pile the next morning.\n\nBy the way, that wasn't me who put John Lincke's stand out at the end of the pier after the Ball!\n\nTell us about your life after the beach.\n\nAfter unfortunately having to depart the beach patrol I entered into the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1991 as a Special Agent. I am currently still with the DEA and have had the opportunity to work in numerous cities in the United States where I conducted criminal Investigations of all levels and be a part of our high risk arrest team. I was assigned to the country of Colombia on two separate occasions and worked throughout south America for 11 of my years with DEA where I served as a Special Agent and the Assistant Regional Director of the Andean Region. I am currently the Special Agent in Charge of DEA's Caribbean Field Division which covers the entire area of the Caribbean from the Bahamas to Barbados.\n\nI still get back to the Crest when I can for the summers and really enjoy being on the beach and thinking about the great memories I had there with WCBP and my family.\n\n​\n\nHow has the beach patrol impacted your life?\n\nI would have to say that the impact of being on the WCBP with my experiences, lessons learned, and things seen while on the Beach Patrol influenced and molded me into the person I am today. Gave me the courage and belief to know I could overcome hurdles and difficulties in life to be successful. Taught me how to get up, brush myself off and move on and learn from the lesson. Being around such a great group of guards and tent crew who all have had various life experiences and come from different backgrounds is an invaluable and incredible opportunity to have while you are pondering life decision you have to make going forward in your life. I was very fortunate to have the Bill, Skip and the Feraco's, Max, Bick, Buddy and may others during those days who always over friendship and guidance.\n\nWhat advice would you give a young guard today?\n\nWith my life experiences, my travels and the things I have seen and done since life after the beach I would have to say live each day fully and and don't cheat yourself out of one second. What you learn and experience on the beach with your fellow guards are all building blocks for your life to move forward and to prepare you for things that you might never imagine could happen and or experience. No matter how small your task is, irrelevant you might think your assignment is, unimportant you feel things are that day....... realize that you get much more out it it by doing the best you can with care care, tenacity and pride. It is the small things that make you successful and respected. What I learned on the beach is CHARACTER is something you do when no one is watching.... because you do it because you believe it should be done and you can be depended on because of your reputation.\n\nFeel fortunate that you are on a team and with a group each summer that maintains a special and unique history that has produced some very successful people in many fields and positions and they all look back on their WCBP days as some of their best in their lives. That should tell you that you have a terrific opportunity being on the WCBP. So live it, love it, give it 100% always and know that someone's life could depend on you at a moments notice, so ALWAYS be ready!"
