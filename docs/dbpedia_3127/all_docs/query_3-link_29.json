        "text": "Skin Cancer is the most common form of cancer and is the most curable and preventable.\n\nEven the most dangerous form of skin cancer, melanoma, is 95-100% curable if detected early and treated quickly.\n\nDid you know 90% of skin cancer is caused by overexposure to UV rays?\n\nBlock the Blaze is a John Wayne Cancer Foundation (JWCF) funded youth skin cancer education and awareness program. Block the Blaze encourages youth to be outdoors, active, and healthy while focusing on sun safety, including skin cancer prevention and early detection. Blocking the Blaze is important all year, not just those summer months! That is why we provide year-round education, in classrooms during the school year, and during summer programs like junior lifeguard camps. Our school presentations are tailored based on grade level from kindergarten thru 12th grade so students receive a fun, informative presentation that is easy to understand. If you are located in the OC, LA, IE or SD area of Southern California and would like to schedule a Block the Blaze presentation for your school, please sign up here. Based outside of those areas but would love to get the valuable information for your students? Please contact us at education@johnwayne.org for options.\n\nDuring the summer months, when Blocking the Blaze is top of mind for most, we are busy educating youth nationwide! Hats and sunblock are given to youth during our summer presentations so they can implement two of the five sun safe tips immediately. Block the Blaze is the official partner of the California Surf Lifesaving Association (CSLSA) bringing education, hats, and sunscreen to over 24,000 CA junior lifeguards. Learn how a Block the Blaze presentation impacted Kennedy a former CA junior Lifeguard. We also partner with various camps and clubs throughout the nation. This past summer Block the Blaze was implemented in 8 states - AZ, DE, FL, GA, NJ, NY, SC, TN, TX. If youâ€™re interested in implementing Block the Blaze in your summer program, please contact us at education@johnwayne.org. To date, Block the Blaze has educated over 625,000 youth nationwide!\n\nWe look forward to providing you with this lifesaving presentation soon!\n\nOUR STORY: HOW BLOCK THE BLAZE BEGAN\n\nThe Block the Blaze (formerly the National Melanoma Awareness Project - Spot a Spot, Save a Life) began at UC Irvine School of Medicine as an extension of the Joel Myres Melanoma Awareness Project, which was founded in 2003 by a group of UCI medical students interested in teaching local teens about skin cancer. The program volunteers educated themselves first and then developed a curriculum aimed at a diverse teen population. In 2014 the John Wayne Cancer Foundation brought the program in house and it has since become the premier program of the John Wayne Cancer Foundation. The project has since expanded rapidly and perhaps more exciting, the project is rapidly gaining national interest. Its adoption is currently underway in Southern California and across the country, and we are actively sharing project materials with all who are interested in joining us.\n\nABOUT JOEL MYRES\n\nAt age 16, Joel was first diagnosed with melanoma after his mother recognized a changing mole on his neck. The melanoma was removed completely, and it did not appear to have spread outside the skin. Joel graduated high school, and decided to pursue a medical degree. In 1998, Joel began his time as a medical student at the University of California, Irvine College of Medicine. He completed over two years at UCI and had begun a Fellowship of Pathology when he noticed a lump on his abdomen. The same doctors who were his teachers and role models were heartbroken to discover that the lump represented a metastatic focus of the original melanoma from so many years ago. Unfortunately Joel passed away on March 7, 2001 following a courageous and prolonged battle with melanoma.\n\nRECORD YOUR NUMBERS\n\nBlock the Blaze would like to thank all partners and presenters who help us educate students about the importance of early detection and prevention of skin cancer across the nation. Please take a moment and fill out the form below to add your participant numbers to our growing number of educated youth!\n\nWANT TO BRING BLOCK THE BLAZE TO YOUR SCHOOL OR TEAM?\n\nRequest a presentation or contact us at education@johnwayne.org"
