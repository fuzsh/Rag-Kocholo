        "text": "Tsukishima Kirari, a gluttonous 14 year-old junior high student, does not care about idols or the entertainment world, and only has her mind set on food along with her cat Na-san. One day, after saving a turtle stuck in a tree, she meets a boy named Seiji who thanks her by giving her a ticket to a SHIPS concert, a popular idol band.\n\nWhen Kirari shows up to the concert, the entrance is full of people, so she finds a door for the staff, under the assumption Seiji is a staff member. Before she could get to the door, a boy lands on her after jumping out a window. Na-san attacks him, until Kirari notices he's wearing a 'STAFF' band around his arm. So Kirari shows him the ticket Seiji gave to her and how she's going to meet him. The boy grabs the ticket out of her hands and rips it, telling her that she and Seiji live in two different worlds. Even without a ticket, Kirari finds a way to sneak into the concert hall by going through a vent. She then discovers that Seiji and the boy from earlier whose name is Hiroto are members of SHIPS. Despite understanding what Hiroto meant by \"two different worlds,\" Kirari refuses to stop pursuing Seiji, and she decides to become an idol herself to get closer to Seiji, but also discovers that she truly does enjoy being idol.\n\nCharacters"
