        "text": "Since I'm on a bit of a manga-reading kick, I've been going through my old collection and found quite a few unwanted series, such as Fushigi Yugi and From Far Away, both of which contain the \"normal girl travels to mysterious other world, meets hot guy, they fall in love\" cliche. Noriko of From Far Away is an especially unlikeable character, and EVERY SINGLE COVER has a picture of her and Izark on it, with Izark in the \"I will protect you, darling\" pose.\n\nBut neither Noriko nor Miaka is as Sueish as... Kirari Tsukishima, of Kirarin Revolution.\n\nTitle of Work: Kirarin Revolution\n\nAuthor: An Nakahara\n\nFull Name, including titles: Kirari Tsukishima\n\nFull Species(es): Human\n\nHair Colour (include adjectives): On the manga covers; something between strawberry blonde and brown. In the anime (which I have not seen because there are songs and the voice actress' voice sounds bad); a darker brown.\n\nEye Colour: Grey? Blue? Purple? I have NO idea, because it's so inconsistent in all the colour drawings.\n\nUnusual Markings/Colourations: None really.\n\nSpecial Possessions/Pets: A kitten named Na-san.\n\nAnnoying Sidekicks: I guess you could say the kitten is a bit of a sidekick too...\n\nAnnoying Origin: Doesn't say.\n\nAnnoying Way of Ruining the Story: Starts off as an ordinary girl but becomes a Hannah Montana-style ~POPSTAR~ by the second chapter. Has a voice actress (in the anime) who can't sing, another comparison to Hannah Montana. The target age for both series is the same though, so I wouldn't be surprised if Kirarin Revolution was inspired by mediocre Disney Channel shows/movies.\n\nAnnoying Special Abilities: Eats a lot, but maintains her figure. She falls onto stage at this pop group's concert, and is miraculously saved by a cushion right in the middle of the stage.\n\nMiscellaneous Reasons The Sue Should Not Exist: Is annoyingly hyper. Is the prettiest girl in her school. She meets a famous heartthrob and will do ANYTHING to get into his pants. I'm not sure if he's a Gary-Stu or not, but he comes to like her pretty quickly.\n\nRedeeming Qualities: The love of food and total apathy towards trends (in the beginning) could be a flaw, but she gets right into the latest trends as soon as people tell her about them. Nothing really is likeable about this girl. Nothing.\n\nSmall snippet of Sue Being Annoying: (Please make sure this is properly accredited to author, so we're not violating copyright).\n\nChapter 2 here because that's when the Sue is most annoying."
