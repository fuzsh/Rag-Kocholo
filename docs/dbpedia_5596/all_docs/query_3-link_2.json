However, as the story progresses, she wants to be an idol for more than that reason.\n\nStory:\n\nI gave the story a 4 because it doesn't develop much and far too many of the episodes are fillers. I can understand that the writers would find it hard to keep up a decent storyline for over 100 episodes, but still.. in each episode an event happens that would usually take a quarter of an episode in most other series, hence making the series feel very dragged out.\n\nIt ... is aimed for younger girls who want to be an idol like Kirari, and that is probably why the lack of a decent story annoys me.\n\nArt:\n\nThe art is fair enough. It isn't bad, but it isn't outstanding either. Kirari always manages to look pretty and cute, but that's as far as it goes. All the other characters and backgrounds look fairly plain in comparison to Kirari.\n\nSound:\n\nThe music is catchy, up-beat and cute, just how it's meant to be. The first opening theme and the second ending theme are delightful to listen to and have very cute lyrics; I even have the second ending on my ipod ^^. The background music is a little repetitive, but not so much that it bothers the viewer.\n\nCharacter:\n\nAside from Kirari, none of the characters stand out as they are all pretty standard - Seiji is dense and naive, Hiroto is a tsundere, Erina is a spoilt brat and similar to Luna from Seto no Hanayome, and so on. Also, none have had any development yet, which pushes my score down. Everyone seems to just be there to push the story along.\n\nEnjoyment:\n\nYes, even though I've just been complaining about the series, I gave this section a 8/10, simply because I always know I can relax when watching this series without becoming bored stiff. It's a lovely way to relax after having a hard day, and the language is quite easy so I can paint my nails without reading the subtitles sometimes ^^; haha.\n\nOverall:\n\nOverall, I thought that Kirarin Revolution deserved a 7/10. OK, it's not for everyone, but if you're like me and just want to find a nice and easy-going series about a cute idol, then I recommend it ^^\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI think the animators should know that their art begins to deteriorate after each big problem is overcame by Kirari. What is worse is that Kirari matures, which kind of loses the comedy as time goes by.\n\nStory: (2) --Because it can only gets more realistic and not comedic\n\nArt: (1) -- Must I say, a rectangle face shaped Kirarin suits the world of Minecraft rather than the anime world\n\nSound: (4) --I had some opening and ending songs I liked so I'd say this is a decent score I'll give\n\nCharacter: (6) --Naa-san is a character that is way past worthiness to be worshipped.....\n\nEnjoyment: (4) ... --God is good to whoever can enjoy the anime without noticing the art\n\nOverall: (5)--I enjoyed how the anime began but.....damn. It's a fair score, I am even thinking that I am too nice to give such a high score\n\nThat is all; my long held anger is finally being spoken and released.\n\n(Btw most of my anger came from how they made Seji and Hiroto ugly. Such a horrendous crime cannot go unseen. )\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nKirarin Revolution is about a young girl who likes to eat meets a boy, finds out he's an idol then decides to join the idol world. It revolves around her making it in the show business world and the meetings/experiences she has with others. The story line is extremely predictable and had very few new ideas to bring to the genre. There was no originality, her redeeming quality would be her optimism, which is pretty common anyways in these type series. Even Kirari's super smart cat, Na-chan gets annoyed with the plot line...\n\nAs for the animation, I thought it was decent for the first 100 ... episodes, it was horribly obvious when they would mix the computer animated stuff with their own drawn works, but then around 105 it switched to all BAD computer animation. It really turned me off from wanting to watch more, however I never profess in not completing a series I set out to watch.. so I mix in a LOT of other animes while finishing up this one.\n\nThe best aspect is the music, the songs are catchy and cute, but even still their horrible computer animation during the songs turns me off. I would like to recommend this series, but I can't. My recommendation is that unless you want to torture yourself with mundaneness and unbelievably positive (lucky) situations, don't watch it...\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nRecent Forum Discussion\n\nPoll: Kirarin Revolution Episode 3 Discussion\n\njacobpaige - Jun 1, 2014 2 repliesby spygear69 »»\n\nAug 15, 2023 6:06 PM Hands Down, Best Episode So Far\n\nZenichi_kun - Jul 14, 2023 0 repliesby Zenichi_kun »»\n\nJul 14, 2023 6:14 PM Poll: Kirarin Revolution Episode 2 Discussion\n\njacobpaige - Jun 1, 2014 2 repliesby spygear69 »»\n\nJul 14, 2023 3:24 PM I FOUND 116-153 EPISODES !\n\nMartisha_Veresk - Jul 14, 2023 0 repliesby Martisha_Veresk »»\n\nJul 14, 2023 4:36 AM Poll: Kirarin Revolution Episode 1 Discussion\n\nCrystal - Jun 23, 2008 3 repliesby spygear69 »»\n\nJul 5, 2023 4:05 PM\n\nRecent Featured Articles\n\nTop 15 Best Idol Anime of All Time\n\nAnime idols are exceptionally popular in the world of anime.
