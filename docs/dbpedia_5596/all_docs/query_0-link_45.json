        "text": "Characters & Voice Actors\n\nStaff\n\nEdit\n\nOpening Theme\n\n1: \"19 Ji no nyusu (19時のニュース)\" by Tokio (eps 1-44) 2: \"Ultra Relax (ウルトラ・リラックス)\" by Tomoe Shinohara (eps 45-102)\n\nEdit\n\nEnding Theme\n\n1: \"Panic\" by Still Small Voice (eps 1-39) 2: \"DAIJO-BU\" by Tomoko Hikita (eps 40-74) 3: \"Pinch ~Love Me Deeper~\" by Rina Chinen (eps 75-102)\n\nReviews\n\nIve never written a review before, but Kodocha is so special to my heart.\n\nIf your here for a short answer-- I 100% recommend this show. It played my feelings to form something beautiful, and im positive it is for almost everyone.<3\n\nplot- 10/10\n\nKodomo no omocha is about a girl named Sana Kurata, an actress, her friends, life, and akito Hayama-- the 'leader' of the boys of her class. it shows her navigating through problems caused by her job, financial issues, love life problems, toxic friends, bullying, and more. this show manages to keep itself so so entertaining, and the humor is on point, its hilarious. the ... filler episodes are very rare, and when they do come around, they are so funny and random that you'll know!! XD\n\ncharacters- 10/10\n\nSana is an extremely lovable and entertaining protagonist, her fun personality is hard to dislike. She has AMAZING character development throughout this series, as you watch her grow more experience with hard times and depression. Her mother is hilarious, she always cheers me up through her exotic hats and evading her script deadline, not to mention her jokes, and she also can be so sincere and loving towards Sana. Akito also grows so much as the story progresses, his feelings toward Sana are so genuine even though he rarely shows it. the character dynamics are so perfect and funny, and Sana's hyper personality adds a lot.\n\nart- 10/10 the anime's art is very pretty, don't get me wrong, but it is kind of average. the manga art is really what makes me give it a 10, as Miho Obana draws the characters in a unique, dream-like sort of way.\n\nmusic- 10/10 I thought I had to add this-- the op's and endings are SUUPER catchy, they had me singing along every episode!! Even after finishing this anime many several months ago, I still listen to the soundtrack to this day<33\n\noverall- 10/10. the New York arc was a bit hard to get through, as it kind of dragged on, but the anime in general is breathtaking and will definitely win your heart and grow on you if you give it a chance.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nman....i love this show. i love everything about it. i have both the official licensed polaroid cameras, and a burrucha. that being said, this is definitely not everyones cup of tea. its pretty dated, but if youre ok with the art style and like over the top slapstick humor you might like it. i love all the music in this show and its one of the few anime osts i own (the vocal collection and the bg music). im a sucker for shojo and slice of life, so im definitely biased in kodocha's favor. sana and hayama are great characters - sana especially bc i ... can easily see her character being annoying but at least imo she never was. its a (mostly) lighthearted series ab kids being kids, and also babbit.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nEveryone has heard that you \"can't judge a book by its cover\", but some anime really surprise you by COMPLETELY changing partway through in terms of tone and style. Kodomo no Omocha is definitely one of the more misleading anime I've ever seen in that regard.\n\nThis anime starts by introducing us to a vapid, moronic child TV star named Sana that zooms around the screen on a permanent sugar high, much like an anime version of The Great Cornholio from Beavis and Butthead. I'm going to come right out and say it, Sana starts out as one of the most annoying characters in the history ... of anime! However, if you have a LOT of patience and are willing to wait about 40-50 episodes, she actually does develop as a character and must face real world examples of pain, loss, and the struggles of growing up. The other main character is Sana's romantic interest, a juvenile delinquent \"tsundere\" named Akito. This romance is highly praised by the many fans of this series, but it takes a LONG time to start getting interesting.\n\nKodomo no Omocha basically starts out as a hyperactive chibi comedy and very slowly evolves into a hard hitting emotional drama over a whopping 102 episodes! When my friend recommended this show to me and said how beautiful the drama was, I watched the first 10 episodes and honestly thought he had just trolled me! There are slow anime that take a while to get good, then there are REALLY slow anime, and finally there is Kodocha. Some people say that one of the most beloved anime on MAL, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, is kind of slow at first and takes a while to get good. That example isn't even comparable to Kodocha. LOTGH is never THAT slow and it certainly is never annoying or borderline unwatchable, unlike the first 30 or so episodes of Kodocha.\n\nBottom line: There is a reason why this comedy/drama series has fans. Eventually it does evolve into an emotionally touching series with some well done romance and bitter tragedy. However, I refuse to rate this series higher than 5 because it takes SO long to even become bearable to watch, let alone get to the good stuff. This easily has the worst pacing of any anime I have ever seen! If an anime viewer wants to watch an emotional drama/romance, why would you make them sit through 30+ episodes or over 15 hours of a much less funny, much more annoying version of Beavis and Butthead?!! Human beings don't have an infinite amount of time on this planet Kodocha!!! No one should have to waste that amount of time on a show in order for it to get good!\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for May\n\nHere are the North American anime, manga, and light novel releases for May.
