        "text": "Well. Looks like you've found me! Let me introduce myself. My name is José Diogo Da Silva Gomes. I'm also known as Diogo-Gomes-1995 on PSN or diogogomes19951 on Steam. But you can call me simply Diogo if you want.\n\nTo put it bluntly, i'm just a random european portuguese guy who's into anime, tokusatsu, video games, music, you name it.\n\nAnd since it's anime that we talk about here in MAL, i think i'll give my minor history with anime:\n\nI began watching anime ever since i was around 4-6 years old. It was around that time where i began watching Doraemon on Canal Panda and sometimes Pokémon when i used to have a VHS tape of three episodes of it or when i'm watching it on SIC. Now where which one is the first anime i've watched is beyond me, though.\n\nBut anyway, through out the 2000s, although i was focused on watching cartoons and playing video games, i did got the time to watch some anime that used to air on television as well.\n\nAs a child, i kept watching Doraemon, while i did began watching Digimon, Captain Tsubasa, Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura, Saint Tail, Naruto, Keroro Gunso, Ninja Hatori-kun, Kochikame, Ojamajo Doremi and Dragon Ball.\n\nAs a teenager, i did watch a couple of anime shows around my time like One Piece, Blue Dragon, Onegai My Melody and Death Note.\n\nIt was around 2011 where i barely even watch anime because i was so hyperfocused on video games and Cartoon Network at the time, i didn't get the time to watch more anime shows.\n\nAround between 2013-2015, i only managed to watch three shows: Jewelpet Twinkle, Mazinger Z from 1972 and Getter Robo from 1974. I did watched a few episodes of some animes like Futari Wa Precure and Kirarin Revolution. But sadly, i kinda felt lazy and didn't bother finish the entire shows for no reason.\n\nThen in my adulthood, i began watching Dragon Ball Super on SIC when it began receiving it's own european portuguese dub that i've been following the anime. And around that time, i also began watching the first 9 episodes of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) after finishing the Phantom Blood manga.\n\nIt's only around 2017 when i began focusing on anime ever since i got back into JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012) and began my journey through watching all JoJo stuff through out spring. Around that time, i also got a chance to watch more anime shows that i never managed to finish around that time. Like Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid, Show By Rock!!, My Hero Academia, Hyperdimension Neptunia The Animation, Love Live! School Idol Project, Spice and Wolf and so much more.\n\nEver since then, not only i found my passion for japanese animation, again, but i also made a decision that Anime will be my biggest focus throughout the rest of my life. Mostly because there's really nothing else to see on portuguese television that interests me, anymore.\n\nBy 2021, i began following animes on a weekly basis, now that i have a better PC laptop that my boss from work offered me after my old Laptop broke. That's where i am today.\n\nFrom 2023 on, starting with Hana no Ko Lunlun, i decided to watch anime in either brazilian or european portuguese subs/dubs because after watching so many anime and many of them having either mediocre or shit subs from Crunchyroll or Funimation, i decided to switch the language just so i don't get any issues with it. Plus, i'm more comfortable watching an anime translated in my own portuguese language than i am for english. There will still be exceptions where i have to watch some obscure anime in english subs if the portuguese subs aren't available anywhere, though.\n\nSo yeah, that's pretty much my history with anime.\n\nAnd if you seen my list of animes that i've watched, you should probably know that i do enjoy watching a huge variety of genres. Magical Girl, Shonen, Slice Of Life, Idol, Fantasy, Supernatural, Mecha, etc.\n\nSo you could say i am open-minded to watching whatever anime i find. That's because i choose whatever anime i find it the most interesting to me and give it a shot to myself. I do eventually watch popular ones as well, but only if the hype dies down a bit and not jumping into the bandwagon like many people do so i can give it a shot and see if i like it or not.\n\nNot that i review animes, but when i sometimes do, i would like to review a very obscure show that not many people talk about and that does need some recognition that it deserves (Keep in mind that most of animes that i review are also animes that aren't even subbed or dubbed at all).\n\nAnd yes, i do give ratings for each show, movie, special, OVA and what have you. So here's how i rate theses shows:\n\n(10) Easily one of the greatest things to ever exist and at some point i even consider it a masterpiece.\n\n(9) If it manages to be amazing, despite a few of it's flaws, then it's all good.\n\n(8) Great stuff, but it does have some room for improvements.\n\n(7) It's good/decent, but some of it's flaws can drag it down, sometimes.\n\n(6) It's alright, but there's so many things that needs to be improved.\n\n(5) It's either average at best, or mediocre at worst, or even somewhere mix-bag. I can skip it if i wanted to.\n\n(4) Not the worst thing to happen, but there's lot more bad to it than good and some studios need to be cautious with everything else the next time they make a anime in the future.\n\n(3) Unless it's so bad that it's good, it's a waste of my time. Not worth watching it.\n\n(2) This is so bad, it's just flatout bad. No other way around it.\n\n(1) It's awful. One of the worst things ever. Stay away from this piece of crap at all freaking cost!\n\nThoses are how i'd rate it at least. Sometimes i might not give it a rating until i finished the show (Unless if the show is bad).\n\nAlso, i actually give my opinion comments on certain anime shows and movies that i watched that you can also see on the \"More\" button. Just in case people want to know what do i think of what anime i watched. Of course all of this is just my personal opinions. So take it with a huge grain of salt.\n\nAnd one more thing to add is that all of my favourite animes are temporary. So there will be a subject for change once i watch more animes.\n\nAlso, i'm mostly a anime-watcher, myself. I do read manga sometimes, but only to take a small steps of reading some mangas that aren't too long or still ongoing. If i, for example, wanted to follow the story of One Piece, i'll just watch the anime. But if the manga isn't quite as long and only has like 100 chapters, then it should be enough to take make some small progression and read whenever i have the time for it. Not all the time, though, but maybe things will change once i get there.\n\nAnd finally, i don't mind accepting friendship invites. In case you want to send me a friendship invitation, feel free to do so. I will accept it and reply after that, unless you hate every anime except Evangelion or Attack on Titans.\n\nNow here's my top 150 favorite animes (As of summer of 2024):\n\nOf course, even as a guy who loves anime, i have a few ones that i do despise with an burning passion. But right now, i can only make ten of them for this one. So here's my small, but easy and updated, top 15 worst animes that i've ever seen:\n\nI also play video games, as well. I decided to remake my list from scratch just so i can form a better list of which games i consider my favorites. For now, here's top 25 favorite video games of all time:"
