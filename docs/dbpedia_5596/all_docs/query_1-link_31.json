        "text": "My last timeslot post was 3 weeks ago. This post is about TV Tokyo’s anime offerings in the mid-to-late 90s, which is why that gap was as long as it was. There are just lots and lots of shows here. Like, way bigger than everyone else. Like, 143 of the 366 total anime aired in the period. Getting all the data together in a semi-neat format took a ton of time even though the information itself was fairly straightforward, just because there was so much of it.\n\nGeneral boilerplate stuff:\n\nIf you’re curious about the details, you can find the data I’ve gathered on this spreadsheet. Note on the format: the master list has just the networks, timeslots, and years of airing. Other sheets contain the shows aired in a given year and those aired on non-Japanese TV, with relevant links for the numerous series for which the Japanese wikipedia page didn’t provide sufficient information on the timeslot.\n\nFor each broadcaster, I’ll be asking two questions. First, which, if any slots did they have dedicated to anime in general? To qualify as an anime slot for the purposes of this exercise, a timeslot has to have aired premieres of at least 3 TV anime from 1994 to 2000. This excludes, for example, the Fuji TV Sunday 18:30 slot, which has been running Sazae-san for a really long time. I’m more interested in timeslots that would have been available to new shows during this period. I do track timeslots before and after the period to get an idea of where their demos originated and where they ended up.\n\nSecond, which, if any shows did that broadcaster air after midnight? I want to give as complete a view as possible on the stance different companies took in regards to airing anime late at night. Since I’ve been poring over the data, I already have a decent idea of what the answer is going to be, but it’s neat to look at how different broadcasters’ stances were during this period.\n\nShow title [month of first episode airing]\n\nMonday 18:00\n\nShima Shima Tora no Shimajiro [12-1993]\n\nKishin Douji Zenki [01-1995]\n\nBakusou Kyoudai Let’s & Go [01-1996]\n\nBakusoku Kyoudai Let’s & Go WGP [01-1997]\n\nBakusou Kyoudai Let’s & Go MAX [01-1998]\n\nChiisana Kyojin Microman [01-1999]\n\nMon Colle Knights [01-2000]\n\nBakuten Shoot Beyblade Series [01-2001]\n\nB-Legend!

They jumped on the late-night wave and rode it like Secretariat, simul-launching 3 dedicated slots in April of 1997 after putting up the Tuesday 25:15 granddaddy in October of the previous year. All told, 34 of the 143 anime airing on TV Tokyo in this period did so after midnight.\n\n-Weiss Kreuz (23:00 Wednesday) and Love Hina (22:00 Wednesday) aired before midnight, but are sort-of late night shows that aired after the primetime anime hours.\n\n-I’m surprised I didn’t encounter more slots that aired OVAs on TV the way the Friday 18:30 did. Given the breadth of available OVAs at the time, I kinda thought that would have been a slightly more common practice.\n\n-Eva’s presence in a slot that dealt near-exclusively in foreign animation prior to that point (Wednesday 18:30) lends some credence to the still-perhaps-apocryphal story that it was a timeslot given to a sad, drunk Hideaki Anno by a producer who didn’t care that much for it. That also seems to be a slot that had been targeting teenagers with contemporary programming (Batman and TMNT), which illustrates why it didn’t do well in its individual run. Teenagers as a whole don’t tend to get Eva, which would explain why long-term rankings for the series on places like MAL have tumbled as the Western fanbase has grown younger.\n\n-Cowboy Bebop originally ran on TV Tokyo, replacing Kodomo no Omocha in the Friday 18:00 slot. But in what English wikipedia cites as poor ratings and Japanese wikipedia cites as unfortunate coincidence of a real-life knife incident plus heavy editing/censorship due to post-Pokemon Shock standards and the resulting creative friction, it was pulled off the air after an abbreviated run, later to air in full on WOWOW, which will be the next and last* channel this series of posts will cover. I considered WOWOW to be the broadcaster for the purposes of the sample.\n\n-It’s surprising, given that late-night slots were a year old at the time of the initial Cowboy Bebop run, that the production committee didn’t just pay the lower price and air it then. Hindsight is always 20/20, sure, but given that Outlaw Star (also animated by Sunrise) went on a late-night slot 3 months earlier (also post-Pokemon Shock), it’s not an unfair point to make. It may have something to do with the fact that Bandai Visual was only on the production committee in Bebop’s case. Or I may be just trying to spin too neat a narrative here.\n\n-Oh, and props to Excel Saga for getting its last episode pulled off the air despite being in one of the slots the network set aside in part so they would have to censor fewer things.\n\n-I really like that Gasaraki was a Sunday morning cartoon.\n\n*Sort-of, anyway. There’s an interesting bit of UHF/SUN TV “other” that’ll get its own footnote, but it only counts for 3 shows as far as the sample is concerned."
