        "text": "Guide to Manga for Middle Graders\n\nWhether you are a parent, guardian, educator, or librarian, you might find yourself at a loss when a middle grader asks for a manga recommendation if you have never read a manga before. Fear not! We are here to help.\n\nHere's a brief explanation on what you need to know.\n\nThe biggest mistake most people make in regards to Japanese manga (and graphic novels/comic books in general) is assuming all illustrated novels are meant for children. Like all forms of fiction, manga titles range from kid-friendly narratives to more sexually or violently explicit material. Just because a manga features illustrations or childish and cutesy characters does not mean it is appropriate for children.\n\nFor the most part, Japanese manga is marketed first by audience and gender, and then by genre. While American graphic novels, and fiction for teens and children, are marketed as simply \"teens and children,\" Japanese manga is split along gender lines: There are manga series specifically marketed towards young boys (known as shonen) and series marketed to young girls (shojo). Likewise, there are series marketed separately to adult men (seinen) and women (josei).\n\nFor a more in-depth explanation on the differences, please check out this handy Beginner’s Guide to Manga. Keep in mind the recommendations listed within the Beginner’s Guide are meant for teens and older; the list below is specifically geared towards middle schoolers ages 10 and up.\n\nWhat do I need to know about manga for middle-school kids?\n\nMiddle-school children typically fall somewhere between shonen/shojo manga and a genre called kodomomuke manga, depending on their emotional maturity level. Kodomomuke is marketed to young children with titles such as Pokemon or Yo-Kai Watch—but these might not satisfy middle schoolers who are looking to read more mature storylines.\n\nShonen manga is aimed primarily at young boys, however, there is nothing stopping anyone else from reading them. Storylines for shonen titles typically follow a young male protagonist as he faces off against evil villains or rivals in his pursuit of greatness.\n\nThere will be a big focus on the power of friendship and comraderie, physical strength, fighting, violence, etc. . There will be little to no romance as the focus is on the hero's journey. The role of female characters varies by manga, but they are generally relegated to love interest or platonic friend status whose entire existence revolves around the male protagonist. Again, this varies by manga. but is pretty consistent across the shonen genre. Kaiu Shirai's The Promised Neverland is one of the few instances of a modern shonen manga with a female protagonist. However, that series features an excessive amount of gore and violence, so it is not recommended for young children.\n\nShojo manga is aimed at young girls and will often feature romance, young love, drama, etc. There are shojo manga that feature girls going on adventures or fighting evil (similar to shonen), but these are typically aimed at high school-age teen girls and are few and far in between. Shojo manga will often feature a female protagonist on a journey towards either a specific goal or just adulthood in general.\n\nIt will follow her interactions with her close friends and family as shenanigans and conflicts ensue. Typically shojo does not feature much explicit violence, gore, or sexual situations. Part of what makes CLAMP's Cardcaptor Sakura so exceptional (aside from the beautiful artwork) is that it features a female protagonist as a traditional hero trying to tame evil forces. However, unlike shonen protagonists who generally rely on brute force, Sakura has her own way of handling each situation.\n\nRomance and Violence\n\nWhile shojo manga is known for its cutesy, fun, and light-hearted presentation of romance, please do not be fooled into thinking you can give your middle schooler any title. Like with western romance novels, shojo romances can vary in terms of how sexually explicit they are. There is also a tendency within manga love stories to pair teen girls with much older men. On average, most shojo romances focus on characters either in their last year of middle school (around age 14) or first year of high school. The age of their love interests can vary between being near their own age or in their 20s.\n\nOnce again, just because a manga features illustrations or childish and cutesy characters does not mean it is appropriate for children. Just because you find a series with a pleasing pretty pink cover with hearts and glitter on it does not mean that it is suitable for children. It could very well include an entire story arc about falling in love with cannibal murderers. This could potentially end up traumatizing the child (unless that child is into that sort of thing).\n\nIt is natural for middle schoolers to start expressing an interest in reading romances as their own budding feelings are developing, and so it is important that they read about healthy relationships. With that in mind we have tried to include titles that are fun but harmless. The romances we have included may include kissing, but nothing much beyond that.\n\nWe have extended that same consideration towards our action-themed shonen manga. Over the top humor and excessive, cartoon-y violence are a staple of manga, so that is to be expected, especially in shonen titles. Still, we have tried to include series that do not feature excessive blood and gore. Our goal was not to censure children, but rather to give them a level starting off point. We have included warnings and notes where appropriate.\n\nManga and Anime\n\nManga and anime go hand in hand. This is because most of the anime produced within Japan is based off of a pre-existing manga series. It is not unusual for a manga to be greenlit for an anime adaptation within the same year of its first publication. In fact, most manga fans expect it, especially with shonen titles. Big shonen action series are the bread and butter of both the anime and manga world. They tend to receive the most publicity and the biggest budgets. Occassionally an original anime will come out that is not based on any pre-exisiting material, but this is not common.\n\nAnime adaptations vary widely in terms of how much they differ from their source material. It is common for anime to remove, alter, rearrange, or add entirely new story arcs independent of the manga. Character designs may also be altered, and a series that featured little to no nudity/sexual humor may suddenly feature a ton in the anime. Big action series will often pump up the gore and violence in their anime as well. That being said, not all changes are bad. It is entirely possible for an anime series to completely surpass its manga origins through the quality of its storytelling.\n\nIt should go without saying that watching anime and reading manga are two entirely different experiences. Neither are better or worse than the other. They are simply different. Naturally we encourage our patrons to read as much as possible, but in the case of manga it is entirely natural to also check out anime adaptations. Most children are introduced to Japanese series through their anime adaptations first before they decide to check out the manga (EX: Pokémon, Sailor Moon, etc.). Unlike reading manga, watching an episode of an anime can be a family activity.\n\nIf you want an abridged look into what your child is currently into, see if there is an anime adaptation available (Not every manga has an anime). Just keep in mind it might not be a completely accurate representation. Fortunately anime and manga fans are very vocal about whether or not an adaptation is accurate, so you'll be sure to find helpful reviews beforehand.\n\nRemember: Just because it features childish and cutesy characters does not mean it is appropriate for children.\n\nAnything Else?\n\nUltimately, these are just generalties about the shojo and shonen genres. There are obviously exceptions to this rule, and the list below reflects that. We have chosen titles that we felt showed off the variety of storylines available to middle school readers. We also organized them by age group rather than by gender, so that readers can make their own decisions based on the content and their own interests rather than their gender identity.\n\nDepending on a library’s space constraints, manga titles meant for adults and those appropriate for children can sometimes be placed in the same area. To ensure your middle grader will not be traumatized by accidentally picking a sexually explicit manga (thinking it was meant for them), touch base with the manga librarian on staff beforehand for recommendations.\n\nUltimately, a child’s parents or guardians determine what is appropriate for their child, but we do encourage as much research as possible so there are no surprises. With that in mind, here is our official list: Manga for Middle Graders!\n\nNote: This list will be updated as new series become available, so be sure to check back every so often!\n\nAll Ages\n\nChi's Sweet Home, Volume 1 by Konami Kanata; translation, Ed Chavez\n\nAll ages\n\nChi is a mischievous newborn kitten who, while on a leisurely stroll with her family, finds herself lost.

Unfortunately for Senzou, there's no cheating when it comes to completing his task! The magic beads around his neck make sure he can't wander too far from his charge or ignore his duties, and so...
