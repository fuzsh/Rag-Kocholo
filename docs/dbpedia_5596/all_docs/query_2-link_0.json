        "text": "Kirarin☆Revolution (きらりん☆レボリューション, Kirarin☆Reboryūshon?) (lit. \"Sparkling☆Revolution\") is a Romantic-Comedy Idol anime and manga series. The shoujo manga by An Nakahara was part of the shoujo magazine Ciao, published by Shogakukan.\n\nAn anime adaption was co-produced by Japan and South Korea, and the first episode premiered on TV Tokyo on April 7, 2006. The show ran from then to March 27, 2009, consisting of 153 episodes total.\n\nPlot\n\nTsukishima Kirari, a gluttonous 14 year-old junior high student, does not care about idols or the entertainment world, and only has her mind set on food along with her cat Na-san. One day, after saving a turtle stuck in a tree, she meets Hiwatari Seiji, a handsome and kind person who thanks her by giving her a ticket to a SHIPS concert, a popular idol band.\n\nHowever, when Kirari shows up to the concert, she finds that the entrance is full of people, so she finds a door for the staff, under the assumption Seiji is a staff member. Before she could get to the door, however, a boy lands on her after jumping out a window. Na-san attacks the boy, until Kirari notices he's wearing a 'STAFF' band around his arm. So Kirari shows him the ticket Seiji gave to her and how she's going to meet him. The boy grabs the ticket out of her hands and rips it, telling her that she and Seiji live in two different worlds.\n\nEven without a ticket, Kirari finds a way to sneak into the concert hall by going through a vent. She then discovers that Seiji and the boy from earlier whose name is Kazama Hiroto are members of SHIPS. Despite understanding what Hiroto meant by \"two different worlds,\" Kirari refuses to stop pursuing Seiji, and she decides to become an idol herself to get closer to Seiji, but also discovers that she truly does enjoy being idol.\n\nProduction\n\nThere are three seasons total in the anime; the second is called \"2nd Tour\" and the third \"3rd Tour\". Each DVD is categorized by stages, thirteen stages to each season, thus totaling up to 39 stages in the anime. There are about three episodes per DVD. There are 51 episodes per season, therefore totaling up to 153 episodes in the anime.\n\nFor the first two seasons, the animation was in 2D, otherwise known as traditional or hand-drawn animation. Traditional animation is a technique in which a person draws a frame by hand to create animation (although, in some cases, it is drawn on a computer). In the third and final season, the animation is changed to 3D, or CGI. CGI is another technique in which a person creates a frame using computers to make it look three-dimensional.\n\nProduction Staff\n\nDirector: Masaharu Okuwaki\n\nSeries Composition: Michihiro Tsuchiya\n\nScript: Michihiro Tsuchiya\n\nStoryboard: Masaharu Okuwaki\n\nEpisode Director: Yoshinori Odaka\n\nMusic: Bice\n\nOriginal Manga: An Nakahara\n\nCharacter Design: Yoshihiro Nagamori\n\nAnimation Director: Hiroshi Wagatsuma\n\nSound Director: Shigeru Chiba\n\nPhotographer Director: Eun Hee Kim\n\nProducers:\n\n​Hiroshi Tsuzuki\n\nYasuyuki Uchida\n\nYukio Kawasaki\n\nYutaka Saito\n\nAnimation Producers:\n\nDU YEOL JUNG\n\nYasuhiro Higuchi\n\nBackground Art: SUN GEUN HAN\n\nEditor: Hiromi Komine\n\nPlanning:\n\n​Nobumasa Sawabe\n\nToshihiro Nakazawa\n\nPublicity:\n\n​Kenji Takahashi\n\nMachiko Ishii\n\nTheme Song Arrangers:\n\n​Masaki Iehara\n\nYasuji Goto\n\nYoichiro Yasuoka\n\nTheme Song Composition:\n\n​Tetsuro Oda\n\nTsunku\n\nTheme Song Lyric Writers:\n\n​Makoto Furuya\n\nMichito\n\nTsunku\n\nTheme Song Performers:\n\nTheme Song Performers:\n\nAiri Suzuki\n\nC-ute\n\nChisato Okai\n\nErika Umeda\n\nKanna Arihara\n\nKoharu Kusumi\n\nMai Hagiwara\n\nMaimi Yajima\n\nMegumi Murakami\n\nSayaka Kitahara\n\nYuu Kikkawa​\n\nCast\n\nMain Characters\n\nKoharu Kusumi as Tsukishima Kirari\n\nAkio Suyama (eps. 1-102) and Takuya Ide (eps. 103-153) as Kazama Hiroto\n\nSouichiro Hoshi (eps. 1-102) and Shikou Kanai (eps. 103-153) as Hiwatari Seiji\n\nChigusa Ikeda as Na-san\n\nSupporting Characters\n\nAika Mitsui as Gurossan\n\nKaya Miyake as Sayaka\n\nKoichi Sakaguchi as TanTan\n\nKumiko Itou as Miku\n\nMasako Joh as Ogura Erina\n\nMasako Nozawa as Obaa-chan\n\nMichiko Neya as Kumoi Kasumi\n\nMiwa Kouzuki as Na-yan\n\nSusumu Chiba as Producer Muranishi\n\nTakafumi Kawakami as Amamiya Arashi\n\nAyumi Tsunematsu as Tina Garland\n\nAzumi Asakura as Tomo\n\nChiwa Saito as Kirisawa Aoi\n\nChomenori Yamawaki as Tsukishima Takashi\n\nHisayo Mochizuki as Mya-san\n\nHisayoshi Izaki as Manager Shakujii\n\nHitomi Yoshizawa as Hitomi\n\nIto Sakata as Girl\n\nJunpei Takiguchi as Mr. Dancho\n\nJuurouta Kosugi as Tanba Suzutarou\n\nMai Hagiwara as Mizuki Hikaru\n\nMasako Katsuki as Mizora Seiko\n\nMegumi Shinkawa as Mr. Na\n\nMotoko Kumai as Higuchi Yasuhiro\n\nNaoko Matsui as Chairwoman Higashiyama\n\nNoriko Shitaya as\n\nTodou Fubuki\n\nMii-tyan"
