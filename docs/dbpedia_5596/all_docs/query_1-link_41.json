You see it happen in pokemon's ratings, and in most digimon series. The whole in between thing is a roller coaster depending on how good or bad the whole series is and how good each specific episode is percieved as being from the preview the previous week (or from magazine episode guides).\n\nAnd while I don't know if Frontier got scaled back because of dumpster ratings, it did get scaled back a few episodes.\n\ngerjomarty\n\nI'm going digital\n\nShow User Social Media\n\nHide User Social Media\n\nJoined\n\nSep 10, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n454\n\nLocation\n\nCambridge, UK\n\nSep 27, 2006\n\n#22\n\nSad that that happened, it would have been nice to see what they were planning.\n\nGlad that we made the Top 10 this week, although it seems like a hollow victory.

It pretty much hurts me to see pokemon dp so high up but then again i shouldent be suprised, it's a \"new\" series. But if the other two shows didn't air and digimon is #9 then ovisaly savers is floating somewhere in top 15. If only we had a list.

You know, the one that had how many and which episodes made it to the top 10 for each season, along with the average ratings? Can someone repost that, but updated with the new Savers information? I think that would be incredibly useful. ^_^"
