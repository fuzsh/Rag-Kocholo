        "text": "ann anime|id=6178, retrieved on 2007-09-21] Starting from episode 103, this show is aired in High-Definition 16:9 with 3D animation.\n\nThe series has been licensed by Viz Media as \"Kirari\", [As evidenced by the fact that any Youtube or other videos of Kirarin Revolution are deleted as 'licensed material.'] however there are no plans for a U.S. broadcast, or DVD release.\n\ntory\n\nKirari Tsukishima, a gluttonous 14-year-old beauty, is a girl who does not care about idols and the entertainment world because her mind is occupied by food. Her obsession with food only causes her to be clueless about love. One day, after saving a turtle that is stranded in a tree, Kirari meets with a handsome and gentle boy named Seiji, who gives her ticket to a SHIPS (a popular idol group) concert to show his gratitude for her saving his pet. Kirari then storms off to the concert and runs into another boy, who tears up her ticket and warns her to stay away from Seiji because she and Seiji live in different worlds. The outraged Kirari then sneaks into the concert, only to discover that Seiji and the boy who tore her ticket, named Hiroto, are actually members of SHIPS. Finally understanding the meaning of `different worlds` (Seiji is a popular idol while she is an average middle school student), Kirari refuses to give up. Filled with determination to be with Seiji, she declares that she will also become an idol.\n\nCharacters\n\nMain characters\n\n;Nihongo|Kirari Tsukishima|月島きらり |Tsukishima Kirari:anime voice|Koharu Kusumi, \"Drama CD voice by\": Miyu Matsuki\n\n*Age: 14\n\n*Favorite food: Crepe and Many other foods:Kirari is a cute and gluttonous 14 year old girl who strives to be an idol. In the beginning she only wanted to be an idol so she can get closer to Seiji, but now she really likes show business. Like a lot of shōjo heroines, she is clumsy, dense, overly trusting of others, and lacks common sense. She is also inexperienced at sewing, cooking and some other household chores. Despite her shortcomings and lack of talents, she manages to persevere because of the help she receives from SHIPS and her cat, Naa-san, and because of her unwavering spirit and resilience. Kirari appears to have the ability to understand, not simply the common pets such as her own pet Nā-san which appear throughout the series, but actual animals too (in character with the show, nobody notices or makes a fuss about this point). [\"Kirarin Revolution\", anime episode 45] Also, she has a unique characteristic of turning all artistic designs into mushroom shapes. [Anime episode 55 (when drawing) and Anime episode 23 (when learning to stitch for a dress design).] Over the course of the show she not only becomes an idol, but also performs a series of odd jobs to promote her company (or in some cases to accidents) such as being a part of a variety show [\"Kirarin Revolution\", anime episode 27] , a manager for other talents (her first job) [episode 5] , an actress [episode 11] , a policewoman [episode 35] , a circus clown [ episode 45] , a manga artist [episode 55] , and even the pink ranger [episode 42] .

He knows that Kirari and Hiroto love each other and that his feelings towards Kirari are not as deep as Hiroto's feelings towards her. He is gentle and says very encouraging words to Kirari.

Back when the two were little, Hiroto promised to become an idol unit with him, but Hyoutarou's family moving separated them.
