        "text": "Kirari Tsukishima is a 14-year old junior high student who has a passion for eating. When she saved a turtle stuck in a tree, its owner,Seiji Hiwatari, gave Kirari a ticket to a SHIPS concert. She tries to get in and there are too many people in front so she goes in the staff entrance. She is met by a young man who gets hostile when she mentions Seiji's name. He rips up her ticket and she runs away. She ends up in the vent over the stage where she sees Seiji and the young man from earlier singing on stage. She falls onto the stage and sets off a cloud of white feathers. Kirari decides to become an Idol.\n\nKirari attempts to figure out ways to become an idol. Because her ideas are ridiculous, her friends Miyu and Sayaka show an article that SHIPS is holding an audition to find the next idol. Kirari rushes to the place and surprisingly figures out that this audition is for guys. She disguises herself as a male and enters the audition. Although Kirari's identity was discovered, her confidence and persistence allowed her to become an idol.\n\nMuranishi assigns Kirari a manager: Kasumi Kumoi. Before Kirari can progress as an idol, Kumoi asks for permission from Kirari's father to become an idol. To Kirari's dismay, her father turns her down. Kirari attempts to find many ways to convince her father to pursue a career in the entertainment world but fails. Seeing Kirari petitioning to become an idol on his way home, Kirari's father decides to approve her request.\n\nDirector Nezumi chooses Kirari's first job as an idol. Secretly, Erina switches the job to a more ridiculous and difficult task, helper to a group of amateur entertainers. Erina makes the task harder by telling whining and making direct lies at Tomy, the person who runs Kirari's 1st job location. Tomy, originally unsatisfied with Kirari trying to take his place during his shows, finally accepts her.\n\nMuranishi eyes Kirari as a marketing model for a company called Rainbow Cosmetics. However, Kirari's unclear and strange mind of being an idol results in a rejection of her modeling for Rainbow Cosmetics. To help Kirari become a proper idol, Muranishi assigns Kirari as the manager of SHIPS for a day.\n\nAn influential CD producer has his eyes set on Kirari and even decides to debut her CD, but Kirari can't sing.

With a slim chance of Kirari ever debuting her first CD, Seiji finds a perfect method for Kirari's singing debut.\n\nKirari performs live on TV with SHIPS for the first time! Erina, trying to take place of Kirari, kidnaps Na-san with taiyaki and ships Na-san into a zoo far away. With the live show about to begin, Kirari desperately searches for Na-san. As the show runs late, Erina convinces the producers to let her perform. Instead, SHIPS will take place until Kirari arrives. Na-san finds his/her route back and reunites with Kirari just in time for the live show.\n\nDuring Kirari's latest shooting, a mysterious magician attacks Kirari and SHIPS with a variety of magic tricks and sea creatures. The magician reveals himself as Arashi. He convinces Kirari to quit her idol work and fulfill the promise they made when they were in their childhood. Surprisingly, Kirari has no memory of such events.\n\nAs Kirari becomes more recognized by people in the entertainment world, going to school becomes more challenging as the media and her fans would crowd around her.

I wonder what's next...\n\nKirari's insecurity about the kiss in the drama interferes with her other idol activities, but with Seiji's help, she finally gains determination to go through with the climatic scene.

Sayaka and Miku start to think that Kirari cares for the fans more instead of her friends.\n\nKirari and Erina have to do a joint segment where they will solve a mystery in a deserted hotel. Of course Erina wants to get all the credit and tries to trick Kirari again.\n\nThe final challenge is to write lyrics for a song.
