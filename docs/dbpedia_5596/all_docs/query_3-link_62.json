Her whole life revolves around food until she meets Seiji, of a popular male idol duo called SHIPS, and it is love at first sight. She decides that she would have a better shot at him if she becomes an idol herself, and with the help of SHIPS, she starts her crusade to enter the japanese entertainment scene.\n\nKirari and Na-san, her cat, work to get to the top dispite the numerous challenges on her way there. If she wants to keep her love intact, she must climb to the top and become a popular idol, which isn't as easy as she thinks."
