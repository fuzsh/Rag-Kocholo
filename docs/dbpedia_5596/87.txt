Preliminary Spoiler

Kirarin Revolution is about a young girl called Kirari who becomes an idol because she wants to follow her crush, Seiji. However, as the story progresses, she wants to be an idol for more than that reason.

Story:

I gave the story a 4 because it doesn't develop much and far too many of the episodes are fillers. I can understand that the writers would find it hard to keep up a decent storyline for over 100 episodes, but still.. in each episode an event happens that would usually take a quarter of an episode in most other series, hence making the series feel very dragged out.

It ... is aimed for younger girls who want to be an idol like Kirari, and that is probably why the lack of a decent story annoys me.

Art:

The art is fair enough. It isn't bad, but it isn't outstanding either. Kirari always manages to look pretty and cute, but that's as far as it goes. All the other characters and backgrounds look fairly plain in comparison to Kirari.

Sound:

The music is catchy, up-beat and cute, just how it's meant to be. The first opening theme and the second ending theme are delightful to listen to and have very cute lyrics; I even have the second ending on my ipod ^^. The background music is a little repetitive, but not so much that it bothers the viewer.

Character:

Aside from Kirari, none of the characters stand out as they are all pretty standard - Seiji is dense and naive, Hiroto is a tsundere, Erina is a spoilt brat and similar to Luna from Seto no Hanayome, and so on. Also, none have had any development yet, which pushes my score down. Everyone seems to just be there to push the story along.

Enjoyment:

Yes, even though I've just been complaining about the series, I gave this section a 8/10, simply because I always know I can relax when watching this series without becoming bored stiff. It's a lovely way to relax after having a hard day, and the language is quite easy so I can paint my nails without reading the subtitles sometimes ^^; haha.

Overall:

Overall, I thought that Kirarin Revolution deserved a 7/10. OK, it's not for everyone, but if you're like me and just want to find a nice and easy-going series about a cute idol, then I recommend it ^^

Allow me to admit outright that the only reason I started watching this show was because the main character, Kirari, is voiced by a member of one of my favorite music groups, Morning Musume. Because I'm a huge fan of shoujo, this was just chocolate frosting on the cake.

Unfortunately, Kirarin Revolution is full of cliches and predictablity. The only things "unique" about it that I can tell is that you basically watch an idol's day-to-day workload, with a tiny smidge of reality cushioned by the usual anime antics. Kirari does not become an idol because of a magical interference (think shows like Fancy La La ... or the manga Cyber Idol Mink), and she is not thrown into it with little or no problems. She actually has to work at her goal and overcome obstacles on almost a daily basis, learning it's not enough to simply stand around and look cute.

There is very little development in this story, and for every "useful" episode you will find several fillers. Every now and then you'll also get a "conflict" that takes 2 or 3 episodes to resolve. I know you should expect it to be that way for a series that's over 100 episodes, but this makes it very slow going. For instance, I have never seen a romance stretched out for this long before. It's enough to make even the most patient hopeless romantic scream "Just get together already!" (for the sake of spoilers, I won't tell you anything else).

The music in the show is catchy, but Kirari is a bad singer and pretty much squeaks her lines. Prepare yourself.

As far as the animation, the quality might have you shaking your head at times because of how OFF the characters can look. I've also heard that later episodes adopt a computerized 3D look - however, I haven't gotten that far and thus can't comment on it yet.

It's definitely a cute and fun show, and I do get enjoyment out of it (I am a firm believer in Hiroto's powers of awesome), but it's mostly a light, fluffy romp with not much else. I'm sure the young girls it's aimed at adore it (how else would it have gone this long?), but if you're looking for something with more substance (and half the length), look elsewhere. If you love to give all shoujo a chance, need something to kill time, and/or you just want to find a harmless guilty pleasure, jump right in.

As a fan of shoujo and magical girl series, I started watching Kirari because it looked adorable. And while it -IS- adorable, with cute character designs and a few notable tunes, namely the second opening theme &quot;Balalaika&quot;, the series proved extremely predictable and had very few new ideas to bring to the genre. Each episode reads like a script and you can see things coming from a mile away.

Kirari is your stereotypical cute (and somewhat gluttonous) dense school girl who falls in love with an idol singer (Seiji, who ironically is equally naive). And of course, there's his co-idol, Hiroto, whom she doesn't get ... along with at all in the beginning who is yelling at her to stop getting in Seiji's way. Sound familiar? Kirari's cute, sure, but she has no experience in show business, yet she decides to try to become an idol anyway just so that she can prove herself and be closer to her new-found crush.

I would like to recommend this series, but I can't. It seems too much like a poorly done rehash of Full Moon wo Sagashite with every other overused shoujo plot device thrown in for good measure and a &quot;na&quot;-ing cat that seems to be even smarter than his owner. The abundance of optimism, happy feelings, and cartoon-like hijinks keep this idol's journey from being at all believable. It may be a fun romp for some in comparison to other plot-heavy series. The characters fill their roles well enough, but they don't really stand out. The music is cute, but average. The animation is mediocre.

Kirarin Revolution is incredibly saccharine, and while it is likely to appeal to young girls who don't mind that the show lacks in creativity, it probably isn't for everybody, and some viewers will find themselves bored.

Kirarin Revolution is about a young girl who likes to eat meets a boy, finds out he's an idol then decides to join the idol world. It revolves around her making it in the show business world and the meetings/experiences she has with others. The story line is extremely predictable and had very few new ideas to bring to the genre. There was no originality, her redeeming quality would be her optimism, which is pretty common anyways in these type series. Even Kirari's super smart cat, Na-chan gets annoyed with the plot line...

As for the animation, I thought it was decent for the first 100 ... episodes, it was horribly obvious when they would mix the computer animated stuff with their own drawn works, but then around 105 it switched to all BAD computer animation. It really turned me off from wanting to watch more, however I never profess in not completing a series I set out to watch.. so I mix in a LOT of other animes while finishing up this one.

The best aspect is the music, the songs are catchy and cute, but even still their horrible computer animation during the songs turns me off. I would like to recommend this series, but I can't. My recommendation is that unless you want to torture yourself with mundaneness and unbelievably positive (lucky) situations, don't watch it...

I personally found the anime really boring. As it didn't progress as much and I've only watched 49 episodes. There is too many episodes that in my opinion don't progress the storyline. I gave it an overall 3 out of 10 because it wasn't entertaining or exciting as you continue.

I think the animators should know that their art begins to deteriorate after each big problem is overcame by Kirari. What is worse is that Kirari matures, which kind of loses the comedy as time goes by.

Story: (2) --Because it can only gets more realistic and not comedic

Art: (1) -- Must I say, a rectangle face shaped Kirarin suits the world of Minecraft rather than the anime world

Sound: (4) --I had some opening and ending songs I liked so I'd say this is a decent score I'll give

Character: (6) --Naa-san is a character that is way past worthiness to be worshipped.....

Enjoyment: (4) ... --God is good to whoever can enjoy the anime without noticing the art

Overall: (5)--I enjoyed how the anime began but.....damn. It's a fair score, I am even thinking that I am too nice to give such a high score

That is all; my long held anger is finally being spoken and released.

(Btw most of my anger came from how they made Seji and Hiroto ugly. Such a horrendous crime cannot go unseen. )

Ah, how nostalgic. I was just looking through my anime list one fine day, and a wave of nostalgia hit me as I saw the title of this series.

Storywise, Kirarin Revolution isn't really that spectacular. The series itself was cliche and you could just about guess what was going to happen next. [ Though I admit I had fun guessing what they would say next, it kept me amused ] It has a very simple and easy-to-understand plot as well. If you are planning to sit back and enjoy a story full of complex twist and turns, you're in for a letdown. That isn't ... to say that the series wasn't interesting,

The art was.. better than an average anime, but not excellent either. It was good enough to enjoy, and not have your eyes burn out in horror whenever you see the characters.

The sound.. well, it was fairly enjoyable. I don't know why, but I kind of enjoyed the first opening. I skipped all of the openings after that however - they hurt my ears. The sounds during the show were fairly repetitive..

The characters were one of the good points of the show. I'm not talking about the main character, Kirari - she remains painfully cute and annoying throughout - well, but since I don't want to spoil you, you'll just have to trust me in saying that the characters were one of the better aspects.

Why did i enjoy this show so much? The comedy, and the plain idiocy of Kirari and Seiji were just too painful to watch; I nearly cracked my ribs laughing. Don't get be wrong, I meant it in a good way. Naa-san, the cat -and also the most intelligent creature in the series- amused me to no end as well.

Overall, if you're looking for a playful and enjoyable series, this is for you. But if you're looking for one with a serious plot and so on, you're best avoiding Kirarin Revolution at all costs.

Also : I dropped the series because at a certain episode (103 or 104 maybe?) the animation changed to 3D and I just couldn't stand watching it any longer.Which is a shame, because I wanted to stay to see how it turned out.

This show had a great way of building up a single character fame, fortune, and story. I myself wasn't much of a fan of it though.

Story - 6. The story definitely shows you what it means to build from ground up. It showed all the tasks and hardships endured by Kirari as she worked her way up to the higher ranks of her overall goal. The reason why I believe it's fair and not any better though is because the story itself is VERY close minded and selfish.

Art - 4. A lot of scenes weren't animated at all, in fact, baby faces replace the characters ... when a scene with much needed animation labor plays.

Sound - 9. I gave this a 9 because the voices were fluent, plus I liked the music quite a bit, even hoping that I'd play it myself someday.

Character - 7. They gave a lot of history and background to the main character kirari. That's really it.

Enjoyment - 7. I actually quite enjoyed this anime, despite my harsh ratings, I like the occasional romance and drama anime in which a single character goes through multiple hardships to achieve what she believes in.

Overall - 6. The average is a mere 6, but don't let this review stop you from trying the anime for yourself. Sometimes you gotta see that even celebrities are human to really appreciate other stories.

This is a really good anime. It is very fun and i personally loved it. many people don't like long animes but i prefer longer animes and i didn't find the plot cliche. I like how she develops relationships with seji and hiroto. Her cat Naa-san is hilarious. If you want a really good anime i would reccomend this one.

Story

i thought the story was really good and didn't have tons of drama. It's a bit cliched but it was still totally enjoyable.

Art

Personally i think it has one of the better styles of drawing out of most of the shows i have watched (which ... is alot :P) though at i think 103 they change the style to 3D which i didn't like very much but its okay.

Sound

umm. i didn't pay attention too much to the background music but it fit. Her songs are awesome. I especially like balalaika!

Character

I liked all of the characters. it was fun to get to see the different sides of each character and see how they change.

Enjoyment

I LOVED IT!

Overall

I would have to give this anime a 10. it my favorite and everyone should watch it! :D

Kirari Tsukishima is not your average fourteen year old girl. Instead of swooning over the popular boy group SHIPS with the rest of her friends, she would rather be eating food. But this all changes one day when she accidentally bumps into SHIPS Seiji Hiwatari..

I reccommend this show to anyone who loves a good romance type story with a bit of wackiness thrown in. This show has a very nice character development, with not only Kirari, but several of the extra characters. Many people are turned off by this show because of it's excessive length and many episodes where your just wondering 'Why am I ... watching this?' Well I don't think you should be. I also don't think you should assume this a show only for girls. It really is not. My 16 year old friend Alex watches this with me and he adores it as much as I do.

I know many people might be bored by this show, but I think that is if you don't really have the extreme desire to watch the show. I personally think if you are a die hard shojou manga fan, you will enjoy this show.

So anyone craving a good dose of hilarity and plenty of love and drama, I think you should give Kirarin Revolution a try.

During a sunny afternoon, Kirarin spots a helpless turtle stuck in a tree. Although Kirarin's mind is always preoccupied with food, she doesn't think twice before saving it; and after the successful rescue, she meets up with the turtle's owner who happens to be a cutie! The guy's name is Seiji and he is actually a famous star! Unfortunately, Seiji's best friend and partner, Hiroto, intrudes on her fantasies claiming that she'd never reach the level of Seiji, and that she should stay away from him. Hiroto's words don't deter her, however; and instead, Kirarin decides to be with Seiji by entering the idol world! ... However, becoming an idol isn't all fun and games, it's fierce competition, hard work, and filled with rivals!

It's been a long time since I've watched this series. I really liked it. It was a great show, for like the 1st 50 episodes. The website I use to watch most of my anime only had 50 episodes uploaded, so I had to do a lot of digging around to find the other episodes. I never actually finished the show. I know I made it to episode 100 and something, but I don't know exactly. The reason I stopped is because the show's art and graphics got to the point where it turned into pure crap.

With all this being said, it's kind of difficult ... to rate this show.

The story - 8

The story is actually really good. Yes it's pretty cliche, as you may have heard already, but it was still really cute, fun, and entertaining. However, after so many episodes, the show begins to lag on with not much plot development at all. It's as if the creators of this show tried to stretch it as thin as they could before it finally broke. To be honest with you, the show starts off at an 8, almost , for me. But by the second half of the show, it drops to a 7.

Art - 8

I initially gave this part a 9. The show is well drawn. I like the characters. They aren't the best that I've seen, but they don't completely look like every other character out there (from what I remember). The only problem I had is sometime during the second half of the series.......the art begins to lack here and there.....then it just gets to the point where it completely sucks. Initially it's around an 8, but as it gets closer to the end, I would have to give it a 5.

Sound - 9

The songs are catchy! I love the music, it's so cute! Even the guys songs are cool. I have actually listened to the live performances of some of the music. Even when the show starts to suck, the music is still around an 8 or 9. That's the one thing that they kept more or less consistent in this series.

Character - 9

I like the characters. Because the show is so long, you do get to know about some of the characters a lot more than you would in other shows. Some characters are down right annoying however, LOL!

Enjoyment - 8

I enjoyed this show....or at least the first half of it.

Overall - 8

This show was good. But it become more and more poorly executed. They began to lose grip while creating this show, and by the part I got to, it seemed like they had completely dropped the ball.

This show reminds me of shows geared more towards children, like Pokemon, in how there's an idea of a plot, but not a real plot. This show was a musical adventure. And just like other children shows, they tried to keep this one going, but they failed. It was a great try though. This show has SO MUCH POTENTIAL! And I would love for this show to be remade oneday :D

I recommend this show to anyone that likes music, cuteness, hints of romance, hard-work-always-wins type animes........but be forewarned, even though it may be a great show at first, you may find it becoming more frustrating towards the end.

*Before you decide to watch this anime, be informed that there is no Eng sub for the last episodes (116-153). I was able to finish this with French dub*

--In a hurry ? Read that important notice : Change of art style and seyuus in the middle of the series for CGI and younger seyuus. No story developpement. Don't waste your time.-- Exemple of the magnificent art style in the late episodes : https://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=63023020170517130837Kilaripisode125VFYouTube.png

==Story== (2) : Kirarin☆Revolution is about a cute girl with a big heart and a beautiful smile. The story revolves around her idol career and the other characters that get in her ... way for diverse reasons. There's aelso a love triangle between Kirarin and 2 guys (which are also idols).

Honestly, my score for the story wouldn't be *that* low if the anime was shorter. The first 30 episodes were entertaining. Damn, even the first 60 manage to make me smile ! But after that... the story was a repetition of a repetition of a repetition. No developpement of the characters. No improvement of the love story.

Oh, and I almost forgot. After episode 100, almost 6 minutes (excluding opening/ending) were kirarin singing the same. f*king. song. (Because she's popular and sings in her shows for her fans, you see ?)

==Art/Animation== (1) : Oh. My. God. Why no reviews about this ?! Art was good for the first 103. At episode 103, I thought I was watching a video made for April Fool. I seriously thought that. They F*ucing changed the art style for CGI. Honestly, I don't know why they thought it was a smart move to change the art style in the middle of the series, but I would've accept it if it was well made (I had no problem with Ajin and Kingdom !), but damn, the movement of the characters were awkward, the shape of the mouth was, well... the mouth was in the place of the nose and weirdly moving. Everything was ugly, except when they were dancing. At least, they were dancing often.

==Sound== (4) : I liked some Seyuu's voices acting. Some were bad (especially the "villains") but we can manage that, eh ? What I have a difficulty to manage is the change of Seyuu's in the middle of the series. Wait for the reason : apparently, they wanted younger seyuus so they can perform in front of IRL fans. Really ? Who made that stupid decision ? Clearly not people that were planning to make an anime of quality.

==Character== (3) : I loved the characters, at first. Funny, cute, made me smile. I shipped Kirarin x Hiroto. But NO DEVELOPEMENT of the characters. At episode 153, they are at the same developpement than at episode 10. Seriously.

==Enjoyment== (3) : The first episodes ? 7. But, but, ... watching the last episodes in CGI was pure torture.

==Overall== (3) : And then again, I'm feeling generous.

*Hope you found my first review helpful !*

kirarin revolution caught my attention when one friend of mine here posted that she is watching this..and i look at it..i fall in love with hiroto-kun at 1st sight :) hehe

when i start watching kirarin..i said..wow..it is something interesting.. well I'm a shojo fanatic anyway..

gosh..i really want kirari and hiroto to end up together...i'm not yet finish watching this anime because i can't ... find episodes 116-153 with sub..

and i want to read its manga but i can't find the complete chapters..anyone know where i can watch and read? :)

well..anyway better watch kirarin revolution even after episode 102..though the animation becomes 3D the story is still interesting...with new characters and friends :)

Just a typical romance shoujo anime.

I liked it in the beginning, but then siiigh the 3D Art

just threw me off into a pit whole, so I dropped it.

+ the subbers weren't subbing it anymore [not blaming the subbers of course]

but what a let down this anime become.

The main character Kirari is funny, but she's a typical one, one who is clumsy

and eats alot. Her love side is dense. Her pet is Naa-San a cute little thing and they both like the same things like Taiyaki and Crepes. The cat takes care of her place instead of her mother.

The mother doesn't come in until ... like late in the series. I thought she was dead like how most of the character's main mom ends up with sometimes. Until later.

Kirari was once a normal girl until she met a pop star name Seiji. Naa-San was stuck on a tree, I forgot how it even landed on it and Seiji came to the rescue and it was love at first sight or so she thinks it is and then she followed him all the way through the music industry meeting Hiroto along the way. And then she sang~

The songs aren't that strong either. I did like a few of them like Balalaika & Chance but the rest where mehh. The opening became anime-listic then Kirari's singer turned real? WUT, shocker. The imagery just didn't fit well there should be saved for an actual MV only.

After it became 3D the quality of the story went down also.

not worth it after 108+ epis.

D: Hiroto was hawt though that's about it. I liked seeing their relationship

evolve.

i really enjoyed the series i just wish that they would confess or something. i feel like both the boys have a thing for kirarin so it just really annoying when they keep ignoring it

i really loved the art and the looks but after about 100 episodes it suddenly looked all different i is just terrible they don't move properly and they aren't clear it hurts to watch, it's overall an okay series but not worth getting all exited over

ithis series is just like any idol series: clumsy girl very different but in some weird way manages to get everyone on her side ... no matter what

Story: 7

In the beginning I had an idea where the show was going and I pretty much nailed it on the head. The difference, however, lies in the execution. The series redelivers comedy, inspirational, heart-warming moments in many different ways, some of them pretty creative. If you're looking for any kind of realism look elsewhere. All the problems in the show are solved by Kirari giving a little to a lot of kindness and hard work over a day to a few weeks. The antagonists introduced in the show almost always end up having some personal circumstances that we discover ... later on make their actions more excusable (and sometimes downright funny).

I can see how, if you are the target audience for this show, this could make kids dangerously idealistic and bound for a rude awakening. Sometimes people just suck and there's no amount of kindness you can give and no excuse they can provide that will make it better. Also, the people with good intentions putting in hard work don't always reap the rewards. As long as its taken with a grain of salt anyone should be fine.

Art: 6

The artists succeed in making Kirari cute and they don't resort to cheap means like Rosario Vampire (I like that show too but you can't go five minutes without an up-skirt shot). They do resort to using sparkles ALOT. The main character sparkles. Get used to it. Backgrounds and side characters are decent. The amount of detail is lacking but it gets the job done. Many of the animations that are simple have a comedic effect though.

Sound: 8

Any show that makes half-way decent pop songs for half of their main characters deserves at least a 7. The songs in Kirarin Revolution, especially Kirari's are pretty good. Voice acting is hilarious. I thought they did a pretty decent job. Some one liners get repetitive. It's amazing how many times Hiroto calls Kirari an idiot.

Character: 7

As of episode 65 Hiroto's character is pretty three-dimensional. Seiji is pretty much an air-head with a decent heart when he remembers. Kirari is one of the cutest characters in anime that I've encountered. Hiroto actually balances her character because she's too nice and Hiroto will actually reprimand people who are acting out of line. As for how deep Kirari is, she definitely has her moments. I wouldn't call her character monochromatic. The antagonists of the show are pretty solid. It's nice when you get to the show, knowing that things are going to work out in the main character's favor, I started to actually like the antagonists and find them amusing. Most of them have decent reasons for being antagonists as well.

Enjoyment: 8

This show makes me laugh very often. I find it clever in its execution and I like the good feeling I get when things work out for Kirari and the people she tries to help. Even though I know most of those things don't, or rarely happen in real life, its nice to visit a world where they do. There's also undertones of romance that are well done and appropriate.

Overall: 7

One Warning, there are a few episodes that are clearly fillers. There are a few more that are filler-ish. I couldn't find a list of them but I could pick them out pretty easily, so you can safely skip the ones that don't look like they're adding anything important to the mix. Other than that I have no real complaints. I like long series that continue to deliver. I'm happy I'm watching Kirarin Revolution. I can care less that I'm not the target audience.
