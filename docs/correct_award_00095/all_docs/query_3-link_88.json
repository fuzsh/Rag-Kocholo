        "text": "The prize, awarded in 1988, brought to notice a man who had already established himself as one of the Middle East's finest and most beloved writers and a strong voice for moderation and religious tolerance. But fame had its perils.\n\nIn 1994, an attacker inspired by a militant cleric's ruling that a Mahfouz novel written decades before was blasphemous stabbed the then-82-year-old Mahfouz as he left his Cairo home.\n\nMahfouz survived, but the attack damaged nerves leading to his right arm, seriously impairing his ability to write.\n\nA man who had once worked for hours at a time - writing in longhand - found it a struggle to \"form legible words running in more or less straight lines,\" he wrote in the aftermath.\n\nStill, Mahfouz maintained a busy schedule well into his 90s.\n\nIn his final years, he would go out six nights a week to meet friends at Cairo's literary watering holes, trading jokes, ideas for stories and news of the day.\n\nMahfouz had been taken to intensive care on August 14 and had remained in critical condition ever since.\n\nBorn in Cairo in December 1911, Mahfouz was Egypt's most celebrated intellectual with about 50 novels to his name. He began writing at the age of 17 and had his first novel published in 1939.\n\nA flurry of other novels followed but it was the Cairo trilogy - Between the Palaces, Palace of Longing, Sugarhouse - published between 1955 and 1957 that brought his name to the forefront of Arab literature.\n\nThe books, depicting traditional urban life, tell of a family living through the first half of the century when Egypt went from British colonial rule to independence under a monarchy.\n\nMahfouz studied philosophy at King Fuad I University (Cairo University), graduating in 1934 and working for a few years in the university's administration.\n\nNearly half of Mahfouz's's novels have been made into films which have circulated throughout the Arabic-speaking world. He wrote more than 100 short stories, many of which have been translated into English.\n\nA lover of Cairo's sprawling cafes, many of his works centre around life in the bustling city, bring out its the uniquely \"Egyptian\" character at a key historical period during which a national identity was being defined.\n\nIn 1988, Mahfouz became the first Arab writer to be awarded the Nobel prize for literature, notably for the universal character of his art, which was considered a metaphor for relations between people in communities worldwide.\n\nThroughout his life, the author was actively interested in politics, staunchly defending a spirit of tolerance and acceptance, a stance which brought controversy into his life.\n\nHis novel, Children of Gebalawi, published in 1959, was banned by Egypt's Islamic Al-Azhar University for the disillusioned view it gave of religion. The book brought more trouble for him in the 1980s, when the fundamentalist Jihad group said Mahfouz should be killed for blasphemy over the book.\n\nIn a biography put out when he was named Nobel laureate, the Nobel Foundation said his second period of writing, starting with Children of Gebalawi, saw a \"new vein that frequently concealed political judgment under allegory and symbolism.\"\n\nMahfouz also worked as a civil servant, including being director of censorship in the Bureau of Art, director of the Foundation for the Support of the Cinema, and then as a consultant to the culture ministry.\n\nDespite his moderate views on Israel and his defence of fellow artists sanctioned in Egypt for holding similar views, Mahfouz strongly supported the Palestinian cause.\n\nWhen he won the Nobel award, he divided the prize money in four equal parts: one for his wife, two for his daughters, while part of his share went to charities for the Palestinians."
