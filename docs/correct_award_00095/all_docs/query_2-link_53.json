        "text": "Walking in the small streets of Khan Kahlili in Cairo, you come across a very elegant and luxury cafe and restaurant called Naguib Mahfouz operated by Oberoi Hotel international. You may be among the lucky ones that noticed it and got the chance to seat in it. Naguib Mahfouz cafe is like an oasis in the chaos of the Souk.\n\nBut do you know who is Naguib Mahfouz? For lots of non-Egyptians maybe the name Naguib Mahfouz doesn‚Äôt say something, but for Egyptians Naguib Mahfouz is very famous maybe as famous as the pyramids or the Nile river. Naguib Mahfouz was a very famous writer, he was the first Arabic writer to win a Noble prize in literature in 1988. He also has received the Egyptian State Prize for his writings from the formal president of Egypt Mubarak.\n\nNaguib Mahfouz was born in the district of Gamaleya, it is in the same area of Hussein where you go to enjoy the traditional walk in Khan Khalili that takes you in the feeling of being in the city of ‚ÄúOne thousand and one nights‚Äù. Being born in such old and historic area of course had an influence on the young Naguib born there on the 11th of December 1911. He also lived there for around 10 years before he move with his family to the newly constructed district at that time ‚ÄúAbbasya‚Äù. Lots of his novels were inspired by the area of Gamaleya such as Midaq Alley, The Cairo Trilogy, Harafich, Children of the Alley. A walk today in the small streets of Gamaleya and the famous street Muezz street makes you feel in another era and takes you back to a beautiful journey in the past and makes feel like walking in one of Mahfouz Novels.\n\nNaguib Mahfouz started writing from his early years at school but his first published novel was ‚ÄúKhufu (Cheops)‚Äôs Wisdom‚Äù in 1939. More than 30 of his novels were turned into films and yes, they were very famous!! Lots of people really enjoyed watching and re-watching those films üôÇ He also wrote more than 20 film scripts.\n\nNaguib Mahfouz will also remain in the Hearts of all Egyptians, a great man that Egypt lost in August 2006. May he Rest in peace and rest in our hearts for the eternity‚Ä¶"
