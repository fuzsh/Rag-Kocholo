        "text": "A selection of the most important works of Egypt’s Nobel literature laureate\n\nNaguib Mahfouz, the first and only writer of Arabic to be awarded the Nobel prize for literature, wrote prolifically from the 1930s until shortly before his death in 2006, in a variety of genres: novels, short stories, plays, screenplays, a regular weekly newspaper column, and in later life his intensely brief and evocative Dreams.\n\nHis Cairo Trilogy achieved the status of a world classic, and the Swedish Academy of Letters in awarding him the 1988 Nobel prize for literature noted that Mahfouz “through works rich in nuance—now clear-sightedly realistic, now evocatively ambiguous—has formed an Arabic narrative art that applies to all mankind.”\n\nHere Denys Johnson-Davies, described by Edward Said as “the leading Arabic–English translator of our time,” makes an essential selection of short stories and extracts from novels and other writings, to present a cross-section through time of the very best of the work of Egypt’s Nobel literature laureate.\n\nIntroduction\n\nChapter 1: Novels, includes excerpts from:\n\nThebes at War, 1944\n\nKhan al-Khalili, 1946\n\nMidaq Alley, 1947\n\nThe Beginning and the End, 1949\n\nThe Cairo Trilogy: Palace Walk, Sugar Street, Children of the Alley 1956–57\n\nThe Thief and the Dogs, 1961\n\nAdrift on the Nile, 1966\n\nMiramar, 1967\n\nMirrors, 1972\n\nKarnak Café, 1974\n\nFountain and Tomb, 1975\n\nThe Harafish, 1977\n\nArabian Nights and Days, 1979\n\nThe Journey of Ibn Fattouma, 1983\n\nBefore the Throne, 1983\n\nAkhenaten, Dweller in Truth, 1985\n\nThe Day the Leader Was Killed, 1985\n\nMorning and Evening Talk, 1987\n\nChapter 2: Short Stories, includes:\n\nThe Return of Sinuhe, 1941\n\nZaabalawi, 1962\n\nThe Conjuror Made Off with the Dish, 1969\n\nThe Answer is No, 1989\n\nHalf a Day, 1989\n\nA Long-term Plan, 1989\n\nForgetfulness, 1984\n\nThe Reception Hall, 1996\n\nTraveler with Hand Luggage, 1996\n\nThe Rose Garden, 1999\n\nChapter 3: Autobiographical Works, includes excerpts from:\n\nEchoes of an Autobiography, 1994\n\nThe Dreams, 2000\n\nDreams of Departure, 2004\n\nSources\n\nNaguib Mahfouz (1911–2006, author) was born in the crowded Cairo district of Gamaliya. He wrote nearly 40 novel-length works, plus hundreds of short stories and numerous screenplays. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1988.\n\nDenys Johnson-Davies (editor) has produced more than thirty volumes of translation of modern Arabic literature, including The Essential Tawfiq al-Hakim (AUC Press, 2008) and The Essential Yusuf Idris (AUC Press, 2009). He received the Sheikh Zayed Book Award in 2007 for Personality of the Year in the Field of Culture."
