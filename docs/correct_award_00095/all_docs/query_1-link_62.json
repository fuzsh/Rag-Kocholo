        "text": "There are a number of prizes and awards for literature like the Pulitzer prize and Booker Prize. However, the Nobel Prize stands out. Why does it stand out?\n\nIt has a unique origin. In 1888, a French newspaper wrote that Alfred Nobel, the creator of dynamite had died when it was his brother, Ludwig who died. In addition to the wrong information, the newspaper wrote; “Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday”. Nobel was devastated by the narration of events and wrote a will to be read a year after his death. He entrusted his money to create a peace prize. This was very surprising to the general public.\n\nThe prize money is enormous. As at the time it started, it amounted to twenty years of academic salary. It was a novel thing because scientists had been awarded a lot of things for groundbreaking discoveries but not money. This money played a role in teaching the public that the prize was important as well as the recipient. Today, it is estimated at over one million dollars.\n\nAlso, the committee set up in charge of selecting awardees involve a lot of research and investigation to ensure that the winner, is really the winner.\n\nHow did it become a Literature prize? Upon creation of the trust, Alfred indicated that of the five, one was to be for “the person who, in the literary field, had produced the most outstanding work in an ideal direction”.\n\nThere have been six Africans to win this highly esteemed Prize and they include;\n\nAbdulrazak Gurnah\n\nIn 2021, he was awarded the Noble Prize in Literature “for his uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fates of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents.”\n\nHe was born in Tanzania but became a refugee in England at the age of eighteen. As a writer, his books were not given so much attention till he won the Nobel Prize, keeping publishers and booksellers with the struggle of meeting the demands.\n\nHe has written ten novels and many short stories. His stories are described as “quiet stories of people who aren’t heard, but there’s an insistence there that we listen.”\n\nHis books include; Paradise, Afterlives, Desertion, By the Sea, Memory of Departure, Gravel Heart among others.\n\n2. John Coetzee\n\nJohn was born in South Africa in the year 1940. He moved to Australia in 2002 and became a citizen of Australia in 2006.\n\nHe published his first novel, Dusklands in 1974 and ever since then, publishes a new one every three years.\n\nHe is one of the most decorated English authors. He has won the Booker Prize two times, the CNA literary award three times, the Prix Femina étranger, the Jerusalem Prize, the Irish Times International Fiction Prize among many other awards and honourary doctorates. He won the Nobel Prize in 2003.\n\nHis books include; Disgrace, Waiting for the Barbarians, Foe, Elizabeth Costello, The School Days among many others.\n\n3.Nadine Gominer\n\nShe was born on the 20th of November, 1923 and died on the 13th of January, 2014 in South Africa.\n\nShe won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1971, the Booker Prize in 1974 and the Nobel Prize in 1991. She was recognised as a writer “who through her magnificent epic writing has…been of very great benefit to humanity.”\n\nHer books include, The Conversationist, Burger’s Daughter, July’s People, A Sport of Nature etc.\n\n4. Naguib Mahfouz\n\nHe is an Egyptian writer who was born on the 11th of December, 1911 and died on the 30th of August, 2006. Before his death, he published 35 novels and over 350 short stories.\n\nIn 1988, he won the Nobel Prize. His famous works include; The Cairo Trilogy and Children of Gebelawi.\n\nIt is said of his writing that it “invites us to reconsider the fundamental things in life.”\n\n5. Wole Soyinka\n\nHe was born on the 13th of July 1934. In 1986, Professor Wole Soyinka he was awarded the Nobel Prize. He has won a number of awards and has been awarded a number of honourary degrees as well.\n\nMy favourite of his work is Aké (The years of childhood). It is a soft read and has some humourous scenes that I found to be unforgettable.\n\nHis other works include The Lion and The Jewel, Death and the King’s Horseman, Trials of Brother Jero, Ibadan:The Penkelemeesi Years among others.\n\n6. Albert Camus\n\nLadies and gentlemen, let’s give a round of applause to this man. He was the first African to win the Nobel Prize as well as the second youngest winner of this highly sought-after prize. He was born on the 7th of November 1913 and died on the 4th of January, 1960.\n\nHe wrote The Stranger, The Plague, The Fall and The First Man.\n\nThere are some winners of the Nobel Prize of Literature who have some ties with Africa. However, calling them African citizens may be a far stretch. They include;\n\nDorris Lessing:\n\nShe was born to British parents in Iran on the 22nd of October 1919 and she died on the 17th of November 2013.\n\nShe won the Nobel Prize in 2007. It is one of the many remarkable awards she won.\n\nJ. M. G. Le Clézio:\n\nHe was born on the 13th of April 1940. He has written over forty works and he won the Prix Renaudot in 1963. He later won the Nobel Prize in 2008."
