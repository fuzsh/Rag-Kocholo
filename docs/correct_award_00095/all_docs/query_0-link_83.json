        "text": "We should observe here how all of these new ideologies aspire to the achievement of global unity and an end to national divisions. in this sense they are in agreement with the old faiths, such as Christianity and islam. however, some of these new doctrines go further: they call for an end to class divisions.\n\nNow, if i had to offer a prediction about which doctrine will triumph over the others, i would say, or rather, i should like to say, that it will be socialism. This is because its promises appeal to the hearts of the disaffected, the discontented, and the poor, who represent the vast majority of the world’s human population. furthermore, socialism is appealing because it seeks to remedy the tangible gap which has arisen due to scientific progress, and the emergence of new inventions and machines, and because it presents a middle way between two systems about which the religious complain: communism and individualism. from these two doctrines socialism has taken the good parts, and rejected the apparent defects, of each. beyond this, there are many other reasons why i am almost certain that the future belongs to socialism, but i am not presently concerned with exploring them further here.\n\nI should mention, however, that the bliss promised by socialism is a worldly one: it pertains to this life, not to a hereafter. This is one reason that it might be unable fulfil its promises in their entirety. In this case, its most enthusiastic and active supporters will be defeated. however, we must also not forget that perfection in this world is an impossibility, and that, even if socialism can’t lead us to a state of bliss, after which there will be no more search, nevertheless, it can still improve the conditions in which we live. Socialism does not represent the conclusion and the cessation of social evolution; the aspiration for something better will always drive us to seek whatever might give us comfort and happiness.\n\nOn this topic i would like to say that, if the hope i have in socialism turns out to be misplaced, to a greater or lesser extent, then that does not mean that i would seek to retreat back to the prior, bad state – by which i mean the present one. Rather, any setback would cause my faith in change and evolution to increase, because it is only through this process that ideas and beliefs, such as socialism itself, come into being."
