        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nNaguib Mahfouz (1911-2006) was the first Arabic author to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1988. Born in al-Gamaliyya, in Cairo, Mahfouz made the setting for his literary works the same city where he was born and lived most of his life. He wrote his first novel in his twenties and for many decades to come, he had produced a multitude of novels and short stories addressing various social and cultural issues. His highly engaging narrative techniques, nowadays consecrated as “The Mahfouzian School”, advocate different layers of nuances, dialogues, themes, and literary styles. He laid the foundation of archetypes, universal models in his literature that most social issues were solved through religion, and hence, claiming a religious background of culture, history, sociology, psychiatry, geography, and so on. For those reasons, despite his simple plot and convincing literary characters belonging to his contemporary society, Naguib Mahfouz was recognized in his early forties as the most prominent figure in modern Arabic literature and has remained so ever since. His fame has spread beyond the borders of the Arab world where many of his works have been translated into major world languages, mainly French, English and Spanish. By the last decade, Mahfouz became the symbol or emblem of Arabic literature today, although such status for the first time has been forcefully claimed by Taha Hussayn in the 1930s. This article seeks to define Mahfouz as the canonical writer for Arabic modern literature and evaluate the influence of his extraordinary worldwide fame on the appropriation of his works back into Arab Canons.\n\n1.1. Background of Naguib Mahfouz\n\nThe Egyptian writer Naguib Mahfouz was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature on October 12, 1988 at the age of 77. His life and work were extraordinary in their magnitude, diversity and influence. Born on December 11, 1911 in Cairo, into a middle class Muslim family, Mahfouz graduated from the Faculty of Arts of the University of Cairo in 1934 with a first degree in philosophy. In 1936 he obtained a diploma in education and worked as a teacher and the director of a children's journal at the Ministry of Waqfs from 1939 to 1971. He married Atiyyatallah Ibrahim in 1954 and fifty years later they were still together. They had two daughters and three sons. Mahfouz’s first published work, the novel Awa’il al-interzaar (1929), Awaiting Death, was written when he was eighteen. His early work is heavily influenced by Western literature and his later work has served as a major source of inspiration for Egyptian readers. A prolific writer from his youth, Mahfouz wrote numerous novels, several collections of short stories, screenplays, theatrical plays, articles and television scripts. His literary fame precludes Mahfouz from meeting his public who often came to talk to him. Consequently, Mahfouz’s conversations with his readers were limited to his written work. His pen was his cornerstone. In his own words, “Writing has been my life’s work. The first literary handiwork that was well received was a short story written when I was about ten years old. I sent my work directly to the newspaper Al-Mukattam. At the time, I thought writing was a simple matter. I never realized that one of my poems, garnered from all those I liked and memorized since childhood, would ever find its way into the publication of Al-Ahram. When I found my poem, I was very proud of it, though I wasn’t on cloud nine. I composed the poem when I was around twenty years old. When I completed it, I knocked on the door of Al-Ahram and handed it in person to the doorman. If I had to abide by literary standards then, and was required to include all the catalysts that have allowed me to penetrate the literary world, they would not change the objectives of every decision I made. I wrote simply to express myself, something that has been hard for me to do in other ways.\"\n\n1.2. Importance of Arabic Literature\n\nArabic literature is extremely important. It has deeply-rooted traditions and a continuous development that make it unique. It is known for its representation of high-life ideals and the presence of poetry and religious themes. The emphasis on soulful introspection is observed in the main aspects of the Arabic literature: its poetry and prose, ranging from historical narratives, moral utility, and personal contemplation. It exemplifies the various dimensions of life - the material, the spiritual, and the psychological. “The escape into the unrealistic and the inspirational is a perennial characteristic; it accompanies the poet who hides from the harsh reality of life in the dreams of the impossible,” Horowitz. Arabic literature, restricted during the colonial era, became the battlefield of the period. It had a strong tradition of global literature, known as the 'new movement', which led to the translation of world literary epoch classics into Arabic. But it was the second half of the twentieth century that truly illuminated modern Arab writings. The encounter with colonial roots and influence, the aftermath of two world wars, the formation of the United Nations, and the creation of the Middle East conflict advanced the interaction between secular liberalism and Islamic nationalism. Recent variations in Arabic writings seem to reflect this multidimensional dynamism. As Sayyid says, “the multifaceted complexity of religion is a source of literary problems as well as the vitality of modern Arabic literature that continues to be a critical interest to international writers.”\n\n2. Naguib Mahfouz's Literary Works\n\nNaguib Mahfouz was the most prominent Arabic novelist in the twentieth century. His impact on Arabic literature was great and substantial in general, and particularly significant in the development of the psychological novel. In a wider context, his works also contributed to international literature. The literary works of Mahfouz cover different types of literary forms from articles and essays to short stories, novels, screenplays, film scripts, and more. He also used different genres to express himself and succeeded in all of them. The short story was his first literary work and he continued to write shorter narratives throughout his literary career. A critical analysis of selected short stories shows that they present some of his basic literary themes, including fate, self-recognition, social debates, and some existential thinking. Mahfouz's novels are the most voluminous of his works. Over four decades he produced some thirty-five of them. Some are single works, while others are parts of trilogies. He also wrote what can be described as popular novels which are not available today as well as some translated novels and/or other forgotten works. This paper covers the better-known and available intellectual novels along with other selected works of this great contemporary Arab writer. No matter an author's subject, his style and narrative technique contribute to making a composition great, or just good, or very poor. Mahfouz's great variety of themes are matched well by his excellent narrative technique, so he stands out among those novelists who express their talents through psychological realism. He was known to keep his characters within their social and historical contexts. He described their material surroundings with lavish detail while reflecting, at the same time, the society and other important events which influenced the characters' fates. Moreover, his narratives have taken a stylistic nature. They may be expressive, free, lyrical, and others. These different techniques appear throughout his writing, especially in the most recent part of his works.\n\n2.1. Novels and Short Stories\n\nNaguib Mahfouz's impact on Arabic literature is best exhibited in his vast number of novels and short stories collected in various books. Yakout Nasri, the critics, sees that Mahfoz's 40 novels and 350 short stories transcend Egypt, exposing the essence of human existence. As distinctive his literary character, his social status reached an equally exceptional level. Many internationally knew of him as the laureate of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1988. Till his death in 2006, he serviced as a judge in literary prizes, novelist, statutory teacher, marinated columnist for Egyptian newspapers and mentor for younger writers. Because of his critical aid for President Anwar Saddat, Mahfouz became popular among the Egyptian myths and walked with a personal guard in the street. He scarcely talk and always profess Arab nationalism and socialism in interviews with foreign journalists'. It is hardly denied that many western intellectuals and Egyptian ascetics have criticised his prose for its historical derision, obscene language and moral laxity. However agreeing with critic 'domestic and foreign critics alike hold that Naguib Mahfouz created a new era of Arabic narrative The wealth of his production has created a new project for university professors, rendering a vast study of the various themes of his writing. They regard him a rebellious red, committed reformer and committed moralist and the most important author in modern Arabic literature' His novels play as a bridge between literary scholars, musicologists, philosophers, painters, psychologists and anthropologists. However they number in the sky, they could be classified into six sections, three of which are concerned with the urban activities of the social classes in low and high Cairo, suburbanize hewy and the remainder which elucid lands the cyclical nature of the universe.\n\n2.2. Themes and Style\n\nThe major themes that Naguib Mahfouz elaborates on in his many great works include the following, the main one being the role of religion in society and how it often leads to violence and terror. He shows not only how extremists perceive their beliefs but also demonstrates the historical roots of violent actions. \"The Beggar,\" \"Cairo Modern,\" and \"The Thief and the Dogs\" are perfect examples for understanding this subject. The division of society into the rich and the poor, and the domination and exploitation of people in the lowest classes by financial capital is another frequent subject frequently appearing in Mahfouz's works. The fear of old age and the desire of not feeling isolated or rejected by one's own society are also two concepts that Mahfouz elaborates on repeatedly. \"The Beggar\" is just one example of this. Men's need to show that they have power over women and that women should be under their control is a solid theme that appears repeatedly in many of Mahfouz's novels. The wish to preserve the family honor, connected with the lack of personal freedom is also in Mahfouz literary analysis, whether in famous titles such as \"The Search\" or \"Midaq Alley,\" or any other. The theme of terrorism and its roots does not leave any possibility to write calmly about religious matters. When the questions at issue are life and death, hell, and paradise, someone always stirs them up. But perhaps Mahfouz wanted to do this anyway, because the testimony countering death that has been given in so many of his novels. The testimony that comes from human reflection on the ineffable power of Almighty God who has mercy on us.\n\n2.3. Awards and Recognition\n\nMahfouz has received numerous awards. In 1967, he became the first Arab to receive a Nobel Prize for Literature. As a result, he received enhanced attention from these countries where further translations of his works were undertaken. His selection was considered by many to reflect the Nobel Committee's interest in promoting multiculturalism, racial harmony, and diversity in the choice of laureates. The Egyptian government made the event an illustration of its role as a sponsor of Arab culture and benefactor of the national literati, hence the Committee's decision was viewed more as a recognition of Egypt's historical stance on the maintenance of peace through the promotion of literature and art. Mahfouz has been scholarly translated into other languages throughout the years and has been awarded numerous other prizes including the State of Kuwait Award for Arts and Letters, Prince of Asturias Award, and the Lenin Peace Prize. The Sultan Al Owais Cultural Foundation recently honored Mahfouz with its Prize for cultural works regarding dialogue among civilisations. In addition to the Nobel Prize, Mahfouz was the recipient of many other awards and honors given by fellow writers, including the following: The Egyptian Academy for Arabic Language Fatima Mernissi Creativity Award; Swedish Royal Letters of Nobility and family crest for literary contributions to world literature; The Arab Thought Foundation, Beirut, Lebanon, Fikr 7th Annual Award in recognition of his achievements and contributions to the enrichment and promotion of Arab thought, Alexandria; Les Palmes Academiques, Government of France; and The American Association for the Study of Middle Eastern and African Literatures (AAMESAL).\n\n3.
