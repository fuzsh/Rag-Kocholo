        "text": "Denys Johnson-Davies\n\nNaguib Mahfouz, the first and only writer of Arabic to be awarded the Nobel prize for literature, wrote prolifically from the 1930s until shortly before his death in 2006, in a variety of genres: novels, short stories, plays, screenplays, a regular weekly newspaper column, and in later life his intensely brief and evocative Dreams. His Cairo Trilogy achieved the status of a world classic, and the Swedish Academy of Letters in awarding him the 1988 Nobel prize for literature noted that Mahfouz ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö‚â†through works rich in nuance‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥now clear-sightedly realistic, now evocatively ambiguous‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥has formed an Arabic narrative art that applies to all mankind.‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬®\n\nHere Denys Johnson-Davies, described by Edward Said as ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö‚â†the leading Arabic‚Äö√†√∂‚àö‚Ñ¢English translator of our time,‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬® makes an essential selection of short stories and extracts from novels and other writings, to present a cross-section through time of the very best of the work of Egypt‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√òs Nobel literature laureate."
