        "text": "“My love is for the people of the alleys, not only the old alleys of Cairo but the alleys of the whole world.” —Naguib Mahfouz\n\nNaguib Mahfouz was born on December 11, 1911 in the crowded Cairo district of Gamaliya. The prolific author wrote 35 novel-length works, hundreds of short stories and plays and 25 screenplays, while also holding a day job as an Egyptian civil servant between 1934 and his retirement in 1971. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1988.\n\nThe Nobel Laureate\n\nIn 1988, the Swedish Academy awarded Naguib Mahfouz the Nobel Prize for Literature, noting that the writer, “through works rich in nuance—now clear-sightedly realistic, now evocatively ambiguous—has formed an Arabian narrative art that applies to all mankind.”\n\nOther recent winners of the Nobel literature prize include Nadine Gordimer, Günter Grass, Harold Pinter, Orhan Pamuk, and Doris Lessing.\n\nNaguib Mahfouz, who very rarely traveled outside Egypt, did not attend the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm. His Nobel Lecture was read (first in Arabic, then in English) to the Swedish Academy on his behalf by Mohamed Salmawy, president of the Egyptian Writers’ Union, former editor-in-chief of the French-language weekly Al-Ahram Hebdo, and a columnist in the Arabic-language daily Al-Ahram. In the lecture, Mahfouz introduces himself as “I am the son of two civilizations that at a certain age in history have formed a happy marriage. The first of these, seven thousand years old, is the pharaonic civilization; the second, one thousand four hundred years old, is the Islamic civilization.” To read the complete lecture, click here.\n\nThe Award Ceremony Speech was delivered by Professor Sture Allén from the Swedish Academy, who said: “In Arabic literature, the novel is actually a 20th-century phenomenon, more or less contemporary with Mahfouz. And it was he who, in due course, was to bring it to maturity. Some of the milestones are Midaq Alley, The Trilogy, Children of the Alley, The Thief and the Dogs, Adrift on the Nile, Respected Sir, and Mirrors. Greatly varied and partly experimental, these novels range from psychological realism to an allegorical and mystic-metaphysical design.” To read the complete speech (translated from Swedish), click here.\n\nIn its official announcement, the Swedish Academy praised the literary legacy of the Egyptian writer, saying “[Mahfouz’s] production has meant a powerful upswing for the novel as a genre and for the development of the literary language in Arabic-speaking cultural circles.”\n\nHis Translated Works\n\nIn the 100th anniversary year of the birth of Naguib Mahfouz, the AUC Press published two more English translations of his novels, Love in the Rain, written by Mahfouz in 1973, translated by Nancy Roberts, and Heart of the Night, first released in Arabic in 1975, translated by Aida A.
