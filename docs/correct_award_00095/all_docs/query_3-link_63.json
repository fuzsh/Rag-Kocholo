        "text": "Naguib Mahfouz was born in Cairo, Egypt. He knew from a very young age that he wanted to be a writer. He began writing at the age of eleven and at 17 he published his first article. At 21 he published his first novel entitled Old Egypt. Mafhouz’s most controversial novel, The Children Gebelawi, with its religious overtones, angered the conservative Muslim community and threats were made on his life. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1988 and became the first Arab to be so honoured. The award saw him gain international popularity. He published more than 50 novels and several short stories and screen plays throughout his career. He died in 2006 at the age of 94.\n\nReferences\n\nNotablebiographies.com (2011). ‘Naguib Mahfouz’ from Encyclopedia of World Biography [online].
