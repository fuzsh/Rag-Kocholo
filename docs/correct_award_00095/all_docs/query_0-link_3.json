        "text": "Naguib Mahfouz (born December 11, 1911, Cairo, Egypt—died August 30, 2006, Cairo) was an Egyptian novelist and screenplay writer, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1988, the first Arabic writer to be so honoured.\n\nMahfouz was the son of a civil servant and grew up in Cairo’s Al-Jamāliyyah district. He attended the Egyptian University (now Cairo University), where in 1934 he received a degree in philosophy. He worked in the Egyptian civil service in a variety of positions from 1934 until his retirement in 1971.\n\nMahfouz’s earliest published works were short stories. His early novels, such as Rādūbīs (1943; “Radobis”), were set in ancient Egypt, but he had turned to describing modern Egyptian society by the time he began his major work, the series Al-Thulāthiyyah (1956–57; “Trilogy”), known as The Cairo Trilogy. Its three novels—Bayn al-qaṣrayn (1956; Palace Walk), Qaṣr al-shawq (1957; Palace of Desire), and Al-Sukkariyyah (1957; Sugar Street)—depict the lives of three generations of different families in Cairo from World War I until after the 1952 military coup that overthrew King Farouk. The trilogy provides a penetrating overview of 20th-century Egyptian thought, attitudes, and social change.\n\nIn subsequent works, Mahfouz offered critical views of the old Egyptian monarchy, British colonialism, and contemporary Egypt. Several of his more notable novels deal with social issues involving women and political prisoners. His novel Awlād ḥāratinā (1959; Children of the Alley) was banned in Egypt for a time because of its controversial treatment of religion and its use of characters based on Muhammad, Moses, and other figures. Islamic militants, partly because of their outrage over the work, later called for his death, and in 1994 Mahfouz was stabbed in the neck.\n\nMahfouz’s other novels included Al-Liṣṣ wa-al-kilāb (1961; The Thief and the Dogs), Al-Shaḥḥādh (1965; The Beggar), and Mīrāmār (1967; Miramar), all of which consider Egyptian society under Gamal Abdel Nasser’s regime; Afrāḥ al-qubba (1981; Wedding Song), set among several characters associated with a Cairo theatre company; and the structurally experimental Ḥadīth al-ṣabāḥ wa-al-masāʾ (1987; Morning and Evening Talk), which strings together in alphabetical order dozens of character sketches. Together, his novels, which were among the first to gain widespread acceptance in the Arabic-speaking world, brought the genre to maturity within Arabic literature.\n\nMahfouz’s achievements as a short-story writer are demonstrated in such collections as Dunyā Allāh (1963; God’s World). The Time and the Place, and Other Stories (1991) and The Seventh Heaven (2005) are collections of his stories in English translation. Mahfouz wrote more than 45 novels and short-story collections, as well as some 30 screenplays and several plays. Aṣdāʾ al-sīrah al-dhātiyyah (1996; Echoes of an Autobiography) is a collection of parables and his sayings. In 1996 the Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature was established to honour Arabic writers."
