The Prize is worth 10,000 euros.\n\nThe COMAR d’Or (Tunisia)\n\nFounded in 1997 the Comar d’Or is a double literary prize awarded to a Tunisian book written in in Arabic and a book written in French.

It awards AED 1.2 million (€336,000), distributed across 6 different categories, including digital book apps. The distribution of the purse can be seen here. It is organised by the UAE Board on Books for Young People (UAEBBY), the local branch of the International Board on Books for Young People founded in Switzerland in 1953. The winners of the Etisalat Award for Arabic Children’s Books are announced during the Sharjah International Book Fair in November.\n\nThe International Prize for Arabic Fiction (UAE)\n\nThe IPAF is considered the most prestigious literary prize in the Arab world. Launched in 2007 it is often referred to as the “Arab Booker” as it was originally modelled on the Booker Prizes. Each year IPAF’s Board of Trustees selects a new panel of five judges. The judges may be literary critics, writers, and academics from the Arab world and beyond. To underline the international dimension of the Prize, one judge is always a non-Arab, who is not necessarily a fluent speaker and sophisticated reader of Arabic. The winner announcement takes place at a gala ceremony in Abu Dhabi in the spring. The shortlisted authors each receive €10,000. The winning author goes on to receive a further €50,000, with a commitment that IPAF will meet the cost of translation of the winning novel into English to help underwrite its publication for an English-speaking readership. In 2009, the IPAF launched a writers’ workshop for aspiring writers from across the Arab world called Nadwa.\n\nKatara Prize for Arabic Novel\n\nAn Arabic Literature Prize established in Qatar in 2014 with a total prize pool of €610,000 and the main prize of €188,000.

The winning novels are translated into five languages, including English and French, but it is unclear how the translators are chosen, and whether or not the books are distributed outside Qatar.\n\nMahmoud Darwish Award for Creativity, managed by the Mahmoud Darwish Foundation is awarded to artists and writers from Palestine and elsewhere.\n\nThe Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature (Egypt)\n\nis open to contemporary novels, written and published in Arabic anywhere in the world, with a copyright date of 2020 or 2021, which have not yet been translated and published in English.

The prize was founded in 1996 and is awarded each December 11, on Naguib Mahfouz’s birthday. “The announcement of this award honouring writers and literature is the most pleasurable event on my birthday. I hope that this prize will also help to discover new talents in Arabic literature and introduce them to readers around the world,” Mahfouz said about the prize. It is administered by the American University in Cairo.\n\nThe Saif Ghobash Banipal Prize for Arabic Literary Translation (UK)\n\nThis annual award of €3,430, is for the translator(s) of a published translation in English of a full-length imaginative and creative Arabic work of literary merit published after, or during, the year 1967 and first published in English translation in the year prior to the award.

Awards range between €2,000 and €4,000.\n\nSharjah Arab Creativity Award\n\nPrizes for short stories, poetry, novels, theatre scripts, children’s literature, and literary criticism are awarded to authors from the Arab world under 40, for a value of up to $6,000 (€5,600).\n\nSheikh Zayed Book Award (UAE)\n\nThere are nine Sheikh Zayed Book Awards of which eight concern books and publishing in the following categories: Literature, Children’s Literature, Young Author, Translation, Art and Literary Criticism, Arab Culture in Other Languages, Publishing and Technology, and Cultural Personality of the Year.

The winners are announced just before the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair which is held in the spring.\n\nSultan Bin Ali Al Owais Cultural Award\n\nThe Sultan Bin Ali Al Owais Cultural Award is granted every two years to a number of outstanding Arab innovators and intellectuals in recognition of their significant contributions in the fields of poetry; short story, novel and drama; literary studies and criticism; and humanities and future studies. The award offers a purse prize of €113,000.00 to the winner of each of its categories.\n\nUNESCO Sharjah Prize for Arab Culture\n\nEstablished in 1998, the UNESCO-Sharjah Prize for Arab Culture rewards, each year, two laureates – individuals, groups or institutions – who, through their work and outstanding achievements, endeavour to disseminate greater knowledge of Arab art and culture. Laureates are awarded the Prize (with an amount of €56,400, divided equally), in recognition of their contribution – in their respective disciplines – to Arab art and culture, or for participating in the dissemination of the latter outside the Arab world. Together, the prize winners have come to represent a new generation of researchers, artists, philosophers, authors and translators with a profound desire to achieve a genuine dialogue between Arab culture and other cultures."
