        "text": "In commemoration of the late Egyptian Nobel prize winner, Naguib Mahfouz, a lifesized statue of the icon has been sculpted by Dr. Ahmed Abdel Fattah and will be erected in the New Administrative capital.\n\nTaking the sculptor a month to create, the statue has so far received plenty of positive feedback on social media for its attention to detail and lifelike resemblance to the late Mahfouz.\n\nAuthor of 34 novels, over 350 short stories, five plays and several movie scripts, Mahfouz passed away in 2006 at the age of 94.\n\nMahfouz won several awards for his work including the Egyptian State Prize which he received twice. The Egyptian novelist, who is the only Arab to have won a Nobel Prize in Literature, has had over 30 movie adaptations made of his novels.\n\nMain Image: www.wikimsrweb.com"
