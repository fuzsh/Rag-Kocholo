        "text": "Mark your Arabic lit-prize calendar for September 16. For the first time since the award was established in 1996, the Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature will announce a shortlist for the prize:\n\nThis re-structuring puts the twenty-three-year-old prize more in line with other, newer Arabic literary prizes, most particularly the International Prize for Arabic Fiction (IPAF).\n\nThe Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature was established by the American University in Cairo Press, with support from Egypt’s only Nobel laureate for literature. The 2019 prize will be awarded to the best “Arabic novel published anywhere in the world in 2018 or 2017 but not yet translated into English[.]”\n\nThere has been occasional overlap with IPAF shortlists, starting with the 2010 winner, Miral al-Tahawy, Brooklyn Heights, which was on the following year’s IPAF shortlist. Last year’s winner Omaima Al-Khamis for Voyage of the Cranes in the Cities of Agate,made the IPAF longlist, but not the shortlist.\n\nHowever, the lists have also diverged.\n\nIn the past, the five-person jury that selected the Naguib Mahfouz winner was largely unchanged from year to year. Not so for the 2019 jury, which was also announced last week. The 2019 jury will be made up of: novelist Ibrahim Nasrallah; writer and critic Hebba Sherif, translator-scholar Samah Selim; critic-scholar Shereen Abouelnaga; and translator Humphrey Davies.\n\nThe award prize has also been increased to $3000. The winner further receives a silver medal and translation and publication by AUC Press’s fiction imprint, Hoopoe.\n\nThe winner has traditionally been announced on December 11, the anniversary of Mahfouz’s birth.\n\nThis fall, the 2017 Mahfouz Medal winner, Huzama Habayeb’s Velvet, will be released in Kay Heikkinen’s translation.\n\nThe rest of the winners:\n\n2016: Adel Esmat, Tales of Yusuf Tadrus, translated by Mandy McClure\n\n2015: Hassan Daoud, No Road to Paradise, translated by Marilyn Booth\n\n2014: Hammour Ziada, The Longing of the Dervish, translated by Jonathan Wright\n\n2013: Khaled Khalifa, No Knives in the Kitchens of This City, translated by Leri Price\n\n2012: Ezzat El Kamhawi, House of the Wolf, translated by Nancy Roberts\n\n2011: The Revolutionary Literary Creativity of the Egyptian People\n\n2010: Miral al-Tahawy, Brooklyn Heights, translated by Samah Selim\n\n2009: Khalil Sweileh, Writing Love, translated by Alexa Firat\n\n2008: Hamdi Abu Golayyel, A Dog with No Tail, translated by Robin Moger\n\n2007: Amina Zaydan, Red Wine, translated by Sally Gomaa\n\n2006: Sahar Khalifeh, The Image, the Icon, and the Covenant, translated by Aida Bamia\n\n2005: Yusuf Abu Rayya, Wedding Night, translated by Neil Hewison\n\n2004: Alia Mamdouh, The Loved Ones, translated by Marilyn Booth\n\n2003: Khairy Shalaby, The Lodging House, translated by Farouk Abdel Wahab\n\n2002: Bensalem Himmich, The Polymath, translated by Roger Allen\n\n2001: Somaya Ramadan, Leaves of Narcissus, translated by Marilyn Booth\n\n2000: Hoda Barakat, The Tiller of Waters, translated by Marilyn Booth\n\n1999: Edwar al-Kharrat, Rama and the Dragon, translated by Ferial Ghazoul and John Verlenden\n\n1998: Ahlam Mosteghanemi, Memory in the Flesh, translated by Peter Clark\n\n1997: Mourid Barghouti, I Saw Ramallah, translated by Ahdaf Soueif; and Yusuf Idris, City of Love and Ashes, translated by Neil Hewison"
