        "text": "by Nathaniel R\n\nYou've gotten to know Juan Carlos a little bit as a new contributor here at TFE. He hosts a podcast \"The One Inch Barrier\" which is how I sought him out to join us here. Each episode looks at one year of the Best International Feature Film race at the Oscars, moving backward chronologically. Each season covers one decade. I've finally made the time to guest-star, for the season four premiere to discuss a year that's deeply embedded in my history: 1989... aka the year my beloved Pfeiffer lost Best Actress. We discuss Italy's winner Cinema Paradiso which is all about moviegoing and nostalgia (so appropriate for the now), France's presumed runner up Camille Claudel (which was also nominated for Best Actress for Isabelle Adjani), and Canada's provocative Jesus of Montreal. A few other films make cameos, too, including Hong Kong's Painted Faces which is randomly streaming on Netflix; it was not nominated but makes an interesting companion piece to Cinema Paradiso.\n\nPlease do share your feelings on these four films, none of which we've discussed on the site!\n\nI love Cinema Paradiso. The Oscar-winning version is excellent but the longer version is even better (more adult regret). It's such a joyful film about going to the cinema. It's also very good on first love, adult loneliness, and lessons learnt. Ennio Morricone's score is sublime. My dad was a projectionist, and of Italian heritage. We lost him last year. We played the opening theme at his funeral.\n\nI've seen Jesus of Montreal just once. I remember thinking it was OK, but I don't have a desire to revisit it. I'd much rather rewatch Arcand's 2003 Oscar winner, The Barbarian Invasions.\n\nFunnily enough, I was thinking about Camille Claudel about an hour before reading this post. I've never seen it and I want to see it. Adjani and Depardieu and tjat wonderful run of French Oscar-nominated films in the 1980s. How have they only won this category once since the '70s?!\n\nCinema Paradiso is my #1 favorite movie of all time. I recognize that it's very sentimental as Owen criticizes above, but I feel like most cinephiles must surely connect with the lead character and his love for the magic of cinema.\n\nI saw it when I was younger and my interest in cinema was just beginning and I think it was kind of the perfect film to introduce me to arthouse cinema. The metaphors and motifs (I'm thinking of the scene with the mother knitting when her son arrives home) are just simple enough for anybody to understand.\n\n@Edward L\n\nSorry to hear of your loss. That was a great story though. I am fascinated by the techniques and ways of doing things during the era of analogue cinema. And films that portray and lament the passing of cultural landmarks like the art of being a cinema projectionist in Cinema Paradiso or the demise of diners in The Last Picture Show, are essential testaments of what life used to be.\n\nI too like the score of Cinema Paradiso for its lushness, much like in Love Affair (1994) and The Mission. But if we're talking about Morricone scores, I prefer the ones he did in the 60s and 70s. They also provide amazing soundscapes for dance remixes.\n\nOne of my favorite actors is Lothaire Bluteau and I love Jesus of Montreal a lot more than most people. Everything about it works for me, art imitating real (and precarious) life, the opening scene of two sopranos singing, and that beautiful ending. He is also memorable in Le Confessionnal with Kristin Scott Thomas, Orlando with Tilda and Bent with Clive Owen.\n\nI love Cinema Paradiso to no end. It makes me cry Every time I see the ‘film canister’ scene. Just the entire growing up portions of loving someone, what your hometown and its people bring to your life and the mentor pushing his protege to leave. Whenever I lose faith in the future of movies, this film places hope in me that someone is out there who can advance the cause.\n\n@Owl:\n\nThank you. And these films that show us traditions, ways of doing things, that have now passed on - you're absolutely right. They're really important.\n\nI like Morricone's music in its various iterations. That includes his driving, anxiety-strewn scores for the likes of The Battle of Algiers, Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion and others. One of my favourites of his is The Untouchables, for its mixture of plaintive sensitivity (e.g. the tracks \"Ness and His Family\" and \"Four Friends\"), bullish intent (the opening credits theme) and epic lift (the main \"Untouchables\" theme).\n\nGiven your comments and Nathaniel's, I should rewatch Jesus of Montreal. I recall it being such a prominent and widely talked about film when it came out."
