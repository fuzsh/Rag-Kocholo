A promising cast of vibrant young actors are signed on -- one fresh from perfume commercials, another from the pornographic film industry, and another who had an affair with the basilica's priest -- quickly drive the production on to become a smash hit. But as the play enjoys the success, the actors become more and more challenged to separate their real lives from their lives onstage.",
