If you believe and confess with your heart that He is Lord you will receive Eternal Life. He came for those who needed Him and He will accept you just as you are.

I am overwhelmed with happiness over your website that I cannot go to sleep. Thank you and God bless you. If there were 1000 more Haitians like you and myself then maybe, just maybe, Haiti would no longer be considered a 3rd world country of poverty and misery. Let the revolution of 2004 begin, and so make our ancestors proud and so that they know that their blood was not shed in vain.\n\nRose Tuffet\n\nEmail: raeniquah-at-meet-u.com\n\nLocation: Miami, USA\n\nOccupation: student at University\n\nDate: Monday, December 16, 2002\n\nCongrats!! it's amazing!\n\nSmith J.

Benjamin\n\nDate: Sunday, January 2002\n\nDear Mr. Antoine,\n\nI found your website by accident although I now realize that I am acquainted with a few contributors such as Serge Bellegarde. I believe that you are doing a great service to the community and a fantastic educational job. I have been visiting regularly, because it has helped me to \"re-learn\" Haitian creole. I have learned songs , expressions and proverbs which have assuaged my quest and my reacquaintance with my Haitian roots, thus enabling me to pass it on to my African grandchildren.\n\nAll this to tell you that in my opinion, you are doing a fantastic job.\n\nI understand the issues you are facing, for after 30 years in Africa, I realize that we are confronting the same problems in Haiti and in Haitian communities. Our African atavisms have transcended two centuries it is eerie!! However, please keep up the good work.\n\nThis is to wish you a happy, prosperous, healthy and rewarding New Year.\n\nI am also hoping that you remember how important you are to the cause we have all committed ourselves to and which unites us in friendship, collegiality and mutual respect.\n\nKnowing that great love and great achievements require great risks, I will be retiring from the United Nations and continue my commitment along side Haitian brothers and sisters whom, as professionals, are determined to make a difference no matter how small. Moreover I share their determination not to let Aids exterminate our Haiti cherie and our communities here.\n\nThe year 2002 hopefully will see all of us more tolerant as we will continue to strive to inspire the next generation, promote equity for girls and women and set some good examples.\n\nI pray that the New Year will bring you and your loved ones many blessings and Peace.\n\nDanielle Fignolé Benjamin\n\nJean Auberto Juste\n\nEmail: jeanaubertoj-at-yahoo.fr\n\nLocation: Ottawa, Canada\n\nOccupation: Student\n\nDate: Friday, March 8, 2002\n\nJe viens de Jérémie (Haiti), j'ai fait mes études secondaires au Collège Saint-Louis de cette ville.

Spent 6 months in Haiti during 1995/1996. Purpose was to safeguard the people of Fond Verette and Chiote so that they could vote without the fear of being killed by gun or Machette. The experience could be described as a period of time where I was constantly on edge, always establishing a relationship of trust and friendship with the Haitians in these two villages and in awe of the violence I dealt with. I found the country folk to be happy, filled with song and dealing with their lives much better than Americans could do. I felt that the people we worked with were unhappy when we pulled out of the country.

I'm Haitian and rigth now I go to school at Buffalo State College, majoring in fashion design and literature in French. I have never been prouder than to be born in the land of Haiti. People sometimes don't understand why my face glows when I talk about my country or when I see my flag. If they had the opportunity to experience the richest culture I've received while growing up in Haiti they too would glow rigth along with me.\n\nI went to Haiti this past January and I'm going back again this August. Let me tell you, a lot has changed since I've left it. I was amazed by how much renovation they have done to the country. There's a lot of clubs, stores at the gas stations, just like in New York, and Champ-mars is beautiful. Those of you who have not been to Haiti in a long time, make it your business to visit or else you'll be missing out, honey.

We, Haitians, need to do a lot. The government in Haiti is really not going to meet the needs of this nation. The change has to begin from the government system. Too many political parties, where all of those people are going, why they all want to be President, why can't one even try to create something? You don't need to be President to help a nation, a nation such as Haiti which needs all the help it could get. You know what, I can't even continue cause I am too upset seeing these people dying because of poverty. There is money in Haiti but they do not know how to make it work and the government does not have any clue how to create. Only one way, change our government system and we will have some ideas.\n\nMax François\n\nEmail: MaxF154047-at-aol.com\n\nPA\n\nDate: Saturday, July 7, 2001\n\nI have visited Windows on Haiti several times.

I believe the country has enough money for it to be developed but in the wrong hands. The reason why Haiti is being called the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere is because those who have the money are very selfish. I believe once each and every Haitian has learned the true meaning of that bigggg... phrase that is on the flag (L'union Fait La Force or Union Make strengh), Haiti will then start going forward instead of backward.\n\nThank You\n\nPierre Louis\n\nEmail: pilou-at-rocketmail.com\n\nLocation: West Palm Beach, Florida\n\nOccupation: System Analyst\n\nDate: Sunday, June 24, 2001\n\nWhat an experience!

Jacmel, Pétionville, Port-au-Prince were great. The food, the scenery, the people, the ocean, it was a feeling I cannot explain. But one thing is for sure, being there was the break I needed. It was a humbling experience and a relief from the crazy pace of Chicago. Thank you to Madam Cena and Madam Meade and their families for their hospitality. If there is anyone in Chicago who could help me in my efforts to learn Haitian Kreyòl, please e-mail me. Maybe we could be language partners. I am a beginner.

I'm 24 now. Now I'm going back to fetch so that I can move forward (sankofa). While most Afrikans retrieve directly from the continent, I chose to go back to my recent ancestors. I search for Afrika in Ayiti. That is most valuable since I am a writer. Born Pascale Philantrope, I reclaimed a name for myself, but have not forgotten its source--the French colonization of a culturally and spiritually rich people. Hence, a mere translation--Ibi Aanu. Indeed, we are coming/returning to know ourselves. This site is proof.\n\nI am a writer of speculative/science fiction. Of course, there is no such thing for us. So, I just tell our stories with truth and courage. I hope to receive guidance from any elders willing (I've humbly gained Mama Bayyinah Bello) to continue the path.\n\nRespe.

In the quiet of the night whilst my children are asleep I have saved a lot of speeches (Dessalines, Frederick Douglas, Femmes de notre Histoire) and will use some quotes from them in a short radio spot called Sankofa that I do as part of a community radio programme together with other African sisters and brothers here in Germany!! We also run a community Saturday school for children of African descent and 2 weeks ago, my husband and our eldest daughter did a presentation on Haiti - again with help from your site. Thanks again!\n\nI read with great interest the essays on language - particularly as I teach in 1 of the 9 European schools where children are taught and have a right to be taught in their \"mother tongue\" (French, English, German, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese) and 2nd language (again 1 of the European languages) from the primary school(1st to 5th grade). Later in the secondary school (6th to 12th), the pupil receives history and geography taught in her/his 2nd language and can later choose to learn a 3rd and/or a 4th language. This is in addition to the other subjects, i.e. sciences, maths, art etc. Although such schools primaríly exist for the bi-lingual children of officials working for European institutions (i.e. the élite), such pupils happen to be in a minority in the school where I am working. Therefore I am aware of some of the advantages (and disadvantages) of working in an a multi-lingual language teaching/learning environment - and know it can work!!\n\nAll the best for the future and keep up the great work!\n\nCharlie Gunn\n\nEmail: sonofagunn11-at-aol.com\n\nLocation: North Olmsted, Ohio\n\nOccupation: Retired\n\nDate: Thursday, April 19, 2001\n\nIn March I took my first trip to Haiti. What a wonderful experience. I went as a volunteer to help build a clinic in Juampas, a remote village about 35 miles from PAP.The villagers were just great. They had started on the construction by digging the trenches for the foundation. For three days we worked side by side, there was a language barrier, but somehow we communicated. We are going back in May to help with the construction again. The Haitian people are very special, I can hardly wait to return. If you know of anyone that would be interested in participating in this project, please give them my E-mail. Thank you.

Recently we have worked together in building a new school building for the people of Cabestor, a small village near Lascohobas. This was built by the Haitians, designed by the Haitian people, with funds provided by your friends in the Parish of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Salem, Virginia,U.S.A.\n\nWe will be in Haiti over the new year of 2000/2001 and hope that the country will be peacefully united behind Jean Bertrand Aristide.

It is our lack of vision that dubs her \"poor.\" Yes, Haiti has her troubles and all of us that love her continue to work and pray in whatever way we know that economic exploitation and oppression may one day come to an end and Haiti can rise up on her feet in true freedom. But economic troubles, political corruption and civil unrest are not powerful enough sources to rob Haiti of her spirit. My husband, born and raised in the Artibonite Valley in a family of master drummers and drum-makers, cringes each time he hears someone refer to Haiti as the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. He says Haiti is not poor, but all her resources are sitting in one place. I agree, but for me, I see the people as Haiti's riches. If there were some way of quantifying spirit like we do per capita income, we'd all be saying, \"Haiti is the richest country in the Western World!\"\n\nSheree R.

As my friends, family members, and colleagues gathered together in my brother-in-law's house, I was asked to give my opinion about the current state of Haiti and my memories about the island as a child. Here is one of the answers I shared during the conversation, \" I learned the French alphabet in Haiti. I also learned to develop a sense of community and self-respect. But I was never taught to espouse my own culture.\" The challenge I pose to the current generation is to educate Haitians with a new attitude, that is, to teach all Haitians to learn to research the causes of the current state of the Haitian \"shifted consciousness.\" As the maxim goes, \"A tree without roots will die.\" I agree with that statement. It is equally reasonable to assume that a people without its roots will die. As an educator, I am for a wholistic approach to educating Haitians. In contrasting cultures in China, Israel, and Saudi-Arabia, I have deduced that the those countries are able to exist today as a result of their strong attachment to their roots.\n\nHaiti means a lot to me. Nevertheless, I had to experience a sea of loneliness in order to realize, no matter what I achieve in foreign land, I am always going to be Haitian. There is a degree of mystification associated with being Haitian. A Haitian is someone who is constantly in search of an identity. We look like Africans but we want to be Europeans. Until our shifted consciousness has been fully retrieved, we are forever indicted to psychological trauma.\n\nManes Pierre, M.S.\n\nAdjunct Professor, Miami Dade Community College\n\nPatty Gaines\n\nEmail: PSutrG-at-aol.com\n\nLocation: Brentwood, TN\n\nOccupation: outreach\n\nDate: Monday, May 29, 2000\n\nThe people of Haiti that I have met give me the gift of hope that is all too often missing in the United States. The spirit of love and hope that illuminates from the Haitian people is inspiring to me, and incites a good anger inside of me that causes me to work for the betterment of their living conditions, infrastucture and dignity of their lives. It is hard to lay my head down at night on a soft pillow, knowing that, in this 21st century, people are dying due to lack of basic necessities, when we have so very much. I am humbled by the people of Haiti.\n\nPatti K.

Favorte Haitian food: Congo beans and rice with piklis (sp?)\n\nMwen pa manje kabrit! ;-) Things I don't like about Haiti: 1) Baggage claim at the P-a-P airport; 2) irreverence at temple ceremomies (researchers who stick microphones in the mouths of serviteurs).\n\nThings I love about Haiti the most: 1) her people; 2) her spirit.\n\nAlison Creech\n\nEmail: alison_creech-at-hotmail.com\n\nLocation: Halifax, Nova Scotia , Canada\n\nOccupation: Librarian\n\nDate: Friday, May 12, 2000\n\nLike many people signing here, I spend some years of my childhood in Haiti--from 1979-1986. We originally moved so that my father could work as an engineer at HASCO, and I attended Union School for grades 3-9. Living in Haiti during my impressionable years has meant that Haiti shapes my outlook on many things. I will never forget the years I spent there, or many of the things I learned. I have to thank Haiti for giving me a wider world-view than I would have had without living there. One day I would like to return and visit again.\n\nTammy Jones\n\nEmail: 2702JOnes-at-cs.com\n\nLocation: Jeffersonville, Indiana, USA\n\nOccupation: Dental Assistant\n\nDate: Thursday, April 27, 2000\n\nI will be traveling to Haiti in a few weeks with a group from my church community.

My first taste of Haitian graciousness and hospitality was Chris and Guy's wedding, where I felt like I was joining the Antoine family, too. And I was. That was nearly 20 years ago. I haven't been to Haiti yet, but since knowing Guy I've enjoyed Haitian hospitality, food, art and music enough to deeply appreciate the beautiful, lively culture of Haiti. I've also realized that Haitians bring a bit of their homeland wherever they may go in the world, and I'm glad of it.\n\nI've learned something about Haiti's bittersweet history, including a lot of first-hand stories from Guy, and it's instilled an enormous respect for the courage, inventiveness, and resilience of the Haitian people. I look forward to the long-overdue day when the world recognizes and honors Haiti's place in history as a nation where slaves overcame slavery against great odds, when it appreciates Haiti's beautiful culture and traditions. Windows on Haiti is helping to bring that day about; good work, Guy!\n\nMarie Carole E.

My father, Harley Snyder, was the Gen. Director for Grace Children's Hospital and my mother, Mary Snyder, worked as an RN at the American Embassy.\n\nBecause of the cultural exposure, my life has been enriched by the 7 years we lived in Port-au-Prince. To this day, I am still preaching the beauty and advantages of living in such a country.\n\nWhen it is safer, I hope to one day take my children, who are now two and a half, seven and nine years old, to Haiti. My wish for them is to be able to experience the generousity of the Haitian people, the beautiful mountains and pine forests and most of all, get a taste of what my life was like as a Canadian child living in Haiti.\n\nI felt \"homesick\" as I browsed through your site and I was captivated by the art you have posted. As I clicked from one picture to the next, I was taken back 20 years ago, when I would drive by the gingerbread houses or ride a camionett to school.\n\nThank you so much for giving me the opportunity \"to go home\".\n\nNatascha Silbersdorf\n\nEmail: natascha-at-silbersdorf.de\n\nLocation: Duisburg, Germany\n\nOccupation: Callcenter Agent\n\nDate: Wednesday, August 14, 2002\n\nMwen voye yon pil ak yon dal salitasyon pou nou tout ki pran tan nou, pou nou rafrechi konesans nou, ak kalite bèl paje sa-a Mr. Guy Antoine fè nou jwenn-an.

L'intention est bonne. Ne faudrait-il pas en même temps penser à régulariser les structures de notre pays, la mentalité féodale de notre peuple et de nos dirigeants ? Je vis en Haiti et je suis actuellement en voyage. A chaque fois que je laisse ce pays, c'est un grand choc pour moi et je suis inconsolable. Je suis indigné de voir comment tous les pays du tiers monde vont de l'avant alors que nous nous evertuons à remuer le passé. Prenons l'exemple de l'Afrique du Sud et allons de l'avant ! Essayons de changer notre mentalité, essayons d'être plus tolérant envers nos concitoyens.

My tenth grade students are currently reading Edwidge Danticat's Krik! Krak!. It was a pleasure reading her short essay on strength of Haiti's women. My students, both Haitian and American, were extremely touched by the short story \"Children of the Sea.\" I think that reading Ms. Danticat's essay will give them more insight into the story.\n\nAlso, I loved the pictures of Fondwa. Our students usually hear about the negative aspects of Haiti. It is time that they see some of our country's beauty and understand why Haiti has been referred to as the \"Pearl of the Antilles.\" Finally, I was happy to see the lyrics page.

The mountains, the trees, the unpaved serpentine road, the green color of hope, the haze, the students on their way to school, the rocks, the unseen thatched-roof kitchens, where smoldering ambers are buried under heaps of white ashes on which the morning coffee was brewed. I minimize everything on my monitor and watch \"Pathways\" unfold.\n\nThere is no sweeter melody than the shrill discordance of a 757's rubber wheels screeching across the pavement when it reaches that airport in Port-au-Prince; no flame burns hotter than the deluge behind the lenses of my dark sunglasses when the voice wraps itself around the passengers and announces: \"Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Haiti.\" I exit the airplane and look towards the mountains in the distance just like those in the picture, Pathways; I close my eyes for an instant and something within begins to soar.\n\nNow every once in a while, in my office, an ocean away from those mapou trees, I see that picture on my monitor and out of the silence something says, \"Welcome Home.\"\n\nThank you Windows on Haiti for the unobstructed view.\n\nVenus St.louis\n\nEmail: haiti23-at-yahoo.com\n\nLocation: New York, NY USA\n\nDate: Tuesday, November 23, 1999\n\nThank you for the opportunity to sign your guestbook.

Toute une année durant laquelle je n'ai pas cessé de penser à tous ceux que j'avais rencontré là-bas. Comme journaliste je cherchais à montrer autre chose que la misère, la superstition, l'insécurité et l'avenir bouché. Pari tenu. Ce fut à la fois facile et compliqué. Facile parce qu'on trouve de nombreux Haïtiens décidés à sortir leur pays de l'ornière dans laquelle il est fiché depuis de si longues années. Les idées et les compétences ne manquent pas, nous le savons tous. Mais compliqué parce qu'inexorablement, lorsque l'on commence à écrire, peut-être imprégné de tous les préjugés souvent véhiculés dans la presse, la plume plonge dans le funeste, le pessimisme, le négatif.\n\nMon premier article fut une véritable corvée : comment parler de la pauvreté en respectant la dignité qui ennoblit les haïtiens dont j'ai croisé la route ? Une fois cette épreuve surmontée, j'ai découvert une population riche de sa simplicité, avide d'échanges et imprégnée de son histoire. Des gens attachants qui ont contribué à modifier mon idée du monde, de la vie, des relations entre les hommes.\n\nJ'espère bientôt pouvoir retourner en Haïti. Je reste en contact à travers internet (bien sûr) mais aussi à travers la littérature, la musique, les reportages et les films. Même depuis la France, finalement, je continue à découvrir un peu plus Haïti chaque jour.\n\nSheri Colas\n\nEmail: HaitiKola-at-aol.com\n\nDate: Saturday, November 20, 1999\n\nGreat page! Really enjoyed going through it. I am not from Haiti but am fascinated with this beautiful country. I have been through many many pages on Haiti. I must say that this is the most informative, most complete, and well presented page on Haiti that I've seen yet. Congratulations!\n\nJean-Marc Antoine\n\nLocation: New York, waving the Haitian Flag in front of the D.R. Consulate to protest the inhumane treatment of migrant workers.
