        "text": "We will not be answering e-mails or dealing with website orders on the 28th of August as the team will be attending a production rehearsal. However, you are welcome to pop into The Old Dairy and make purchases in person.\n\nWe apologise for any inconvenience.\n\nToday is Senior Citizen Day and our Wednesday Wisdom is that – despite what you may think – it is never too late to pick up an instrument and start learning. You don’t have to become the next Segovia or Django; the most important thing is to have fun.\n\nHowever, if you want to progress down a formal route or work towards doing gigs we know that doing the 10,000 hours to excellence can seem daunting. But you’d be surprised how quickly you can rack them up; especially when retired.\n\nPlease note that we will be open by appointment only over the Bank Holiday weekend. We ask that you contact us to schedule your appointment by lunchtime on Friday – thank you."
