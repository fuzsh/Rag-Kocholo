That would mean no Christmas music and no Christmas movies. But a world without Jesus would mean much more to our popular culture.\r<div class='spaceBtnLine'></div>\r<div class='spaceBtnLine'></div>One of my favourite Broadway musicals is <em>Les Miz</em>. I never read the novel, <em>Les Miserables</em> by Victor Hugo and wasn't crazy about the screen adaptation (although, wasn't Anne Hathaway fabulous as Fantine?). I watched the musical three times and every time, I thought that this novel would be very different had Jesus not been born. Perhaps Victor Hugo never would have written it. If so, there wouldn't be a musical called <em>Les Mis</em>, and the movie would not have been made. None of those wonderful songs would not exist.\r<div class='spaceBtnLine'></div>\r<div class='spaceBtnLine'></div>Had Jesus not been born, there would be many other songs missing from your playlist:\r<div class='spaceBtnLine'></div>\r<div class='spaceBtnLine'></div><em>Personal Jesus</em> by Depeche Mode; <em>Hey Jesus</em> by the Indigo Girls; <em>God is Love</em> by Lenny Kravitz; <em>Forgiven</em> by Alanis Morisette; <em>Sympathy for the Devil</em> by the Rolling Stones;<em> One of Us</em> by Joan Osbourne; <em>God</em> or <em>Imagine</em> by John Lennon; <em>I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For</em> by U2; <em>Jesus</em> by Queen. That’s just off the top of my head. (Looking around the Internet I came across this page: <a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/article/22-songs-are-great-despite-being-pro-jesus-229739\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\"22 Songs that Are Great Despite Being Pro-Jesus.\"</a> An interesting read.)\r<div class='spaceBtnLine'></div>\r<div class='spaceBtnLine'></div>Had Jesus never been born, we would also be missing a lot of great (and not so great) films from our video libraries:\r<div class='spaceBtnLine'></div>\r<div class='spaceBtnLine'></div>There would be no <em>Jesus Christ Super Star</em>, No <em>Godspell</em>, No <em>Jesus of Nazareth</em>, <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>, <em>The Last Temptation</em>, <em>The Nativity Story</em>, <em>The Life of Brian</em>, <em>Ben Hur</em>, <em>The King of Kings</em>, <em>Salome</em>, <em>The Robe</em>, <em>Ben-Hur</em>, <em>The Shadow of Nazareth</em>, <em>Barabbas</em>, <em>The Greatest Story Ever Told</em>, <em>The Gospel According to St. Matthew</em>, <em>Jesus of Montreal</em>, <em>Mary, the Mother of Jesus</em>, <em>Jesus</em> (the mini-series), <em>The Miracle Maker</em>, <em>Young Messiah</em>, <em>Risen</em> or the <em>Son of God</em>.
