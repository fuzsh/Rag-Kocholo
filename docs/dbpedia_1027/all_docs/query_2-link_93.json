        "text": "MIDDLEBURY, Vt. ? On Thursday, Jan. 17, through Saturday, Jan. 19, Middlebury College will host the 2008 Charles P. Scott Lectures. The series, titled “Engaging Passions: The Death of Jesus and its Legacies,” will feature prominent speakers who are authors and scholars in the fields of religion, literature and music. The lectures, discussions and film screening are free and open to the public and will take place in Twilight Hall, located on College Street (Route 125).\n\nThe death of Jesus, the central event of “the Passion,” is a major icon of the Western world. The series of lectures and events will examine the story of Jesus’ death in the gospels and other early Christian literature and explore the development of these narratives in liturgy, art, music, literature, drama and film. The speakers will provide a sense of the diversity of the gospel narratives, their eventual melding into one story, the ways the story influenced the development of Christian theology and Western culture, and the conflicts that frequently occurred as a result of the story itself and its interpretations at various points in history.\n\nThe lecturers, who have a wide range of perspectives, each bringing an informed and authoritative voice to the discussion, include: Larry Yarbrough, Tillinghast Professor of Religion at Middlebury College and scholar of the New Testament and early Christianity who wrote “Not Like the Gentiles: Marriage Rules in the Letters of Paul” as well as essays on a variety of themes in Early Christianity and Early Judaism; Julia Alvarez, a best-selling novelist and poet, who has written several books including “Saving the World” (2006), “The Woman I Kept to Myself” (2004), “Yo” (1997), “In the Time of the Butterflies” (1994), and “How the Garcia Girls Lost their Accents” (1991), as well as children’s books and collections of poetry; Jay Parini, Axinn Professor of English and Creative Writing at Middlebury College and author of “The Art of Teaching” (2005), “One Matchless Time” (2004), “The Apprentice Lover” (2002), “Robert Frost: A Life” (1999), “Benjamin’s Crossing” (1996) and “John Steinbeck” (1995); Adele Reinhartz, a professor in the department of classics and religious studies at the University of Ottawa and a scholar of the Gospel of John, early Jewish-Christian relations, feminist criticism, and, most recently, the Bible and film, whose latest book is a study of the Jesus movies, entitled “Jesus of Hollywood” (2007); Elizabeth Cook, author of academic publications including “Seeing Through Words” (1986), fiction including “Achilles” (2002), and poet, who wrote the libretto for composer Francis Grier’s “The Passion of Jesus of Nazareth,” which premiered in Minneapolis and King’s College Chapel Cambridge in 2006; Andrew Shenton, a professional musician trained at The Royal College of Music in London and an assistant professor of sacred music at Boston University, where he directs the Master of Sacred Music Program; Maria Hatjigeorgiou, a poet and scholar whose research focuses on Orthodox Christianity and Byzantine iconography, has published articles on Byzantine art and poetry, Orthodox theology, and Medieval and Modern Greek literature, and teaches courses at Middlebury on the “Female Experience of the Divine in Late Antiquity and Byzantium,” as well as on Byzantine iconography and the Byzantine religious experience; Robert Atwell, an Anglican priest in the Diocese of London and former Benedictine Monk who has written books on theology and liturgics including “Spiritual Classics from the Early Church” (1995) and “Celebrating the Saints” (2001); John McWilliams, professor of humanities at Middlebury College, whose recent books include “The American Epic: Transforming A Genre” (l989), “The Last of the Mohicans: Civil Savagery and Savage Civility” (1994); and “New England’s Crises and Cultural Memory” (2004); Katherine Sonderegger, a professor at Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria and author of “That Jesus Christ was born a Jew” (1992), as well as articles in theological journals addressing Jewish-Christian relations; and Suleiman Ali Mourad, an assistant professor of religion at Smith College who teaches courses on history and religion, and whose recent publications include “Early Islam between Myth and History: al-Hasan al-Basri and the Formation of His Legacy in Classical Islamic Scholarship” (2005) and “Jerusalem: Idea and Reality” (2008).\n\nThe lecture series is sponsored by several Middlebury College organizations: the Department of Religion, the Charles P. Scott Fund, the American Studies Program, Atwater Commons, Brainerd Commons, Cook Commons, Ross Commons, Wonnacott Commons and the Rohatyn Center for International Affairs.\n\nFor more information, contact Charlene Barrett in the Middlebury College religion department at cmbarret@middlebury.edu or 802-443-5289.\n\nTo follow is a schedule of lectures:\n\n2008 Charles P.
