        "text": "This Holy Week, the motion picture “Paul, Apostle of Christ” starring James Faulkner and Jim Caviezel is scheduled to be released and a new, live version of Jesus Christ: Superstar: with John Legend is scheduled Easter Sunday. Other theatrical films about Christianity range from Sherwood Pictures’ “Fireproof” and “Courageous” to the Erwin brothers’ “I Can Only Imagine” to the relatively inferior “Left Behind” efforts based on Jerry Jenkins’ and Tim LaHaye’s novels; and online movies such as “Dear Viola” and “God’s Not Dead” from Pureflix.com\n\nOf course, faithful filmgoers should no more limit their viewing to such sermonizing movies than readers should reject independent booksellers to exclusively shop at Christian bookstores. Value can be found in numerous places – even multiplexes or home screens, where many thoughtful, reverent films are available.\n\n“If we think of theology as rooted in story, it should come as no surprise that some of the most profoundly theological works of the past century have been movies,” writes Theresa Sanders in her book “Celluloid Saints: Images of Sanctity.”\n\nMovie fans who enjoy stories featuring elements of faith have plenty of choices beyond obligatory spring showings of “The Ten Commandments”: “Ben Hur”; “Hail Mary”; “Jesus of Nazareth”; “Joan of Arc”; “Maximilian: Saint of Auschwitz”; “Miracle of The Bells”; “The Nazarin”; “Quo Vadis”; “Risen”; “Romero”; “The Silver Chalice” … Here’s a dozen other top choices:\n\n“Barabbas” (1962). Anthony Quinn has the title role in this well-acted film based on the Gospel episode where Pilate frees the revolutionary instead of Jesus. Here, that haunts Barabbas. Its cast features Jack Palance, Arthur Kennedy and Ernest Borgnine.\n\n“Brother Sun, Sister Moon” (1973). Franco Zeffirelli directed this biography of St. Francis of Assisi, who changes from an Italian soldier to a man surrendering his family’s wealth to devote his life to others. Graham Faulkner stars.\n\n“The Greatest Story Ever Told” (1965). The road from Galilee to Calvary is explored in an all-star treatment starring Max von Sydow as Jesus, with Sidney Poitier, Telly Savalas, John Wayne, Van Heflin, Roddy McDowell, Claude Rains, Angela Lansbury, Jose Ferrer and Charlton Heston.\n\n“Jesus of Montreal” (1989). Nominated for an Academy Award, this drama follows a man (Lothaire Bluteau) directing a Passion Play for a Catholic shrine. While working, the cast is challenged by its members, the community and Christ’s teachings.\n\n“King of Kings” (1961). Director Nicholas Ray’s visual sense is impressive in this version of the Gospels, starring Jeffrey Hunter as Jesus, with Robert Ryan and Rip Torn.\n\n“The Last Temptation of Christ” (1988). Martin Scorsese’s film became controversial because of protests by “Fundamentalists, most of whom had not seen the movie,” according to Religion Newswriters Association president Hiley Ward. But “one theologically trained letter writer in Christian Century magazine claimed it was the best Jesus movie ever made.” Despite its emphasis on Jesus the Son of Man (Willem Dafoe), the movie – based on Nikos Kazantzakis’ book – matter-of-factly depicts Christ’s miracles and message, ending with a confident Jesus accepting crucifixion with joy. It co-stars Barbara Hershey, Harvey Keitel, Harry Dean Stanton and David Bowie.\n\n“Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima” (1952). Based on a true story of three Portuguese kids who in 1917 saw the Virgin Mary, this Oscar-nominated production is inspirational, starring Sherry Jackson, Gilbert Roland and Frank Silvera.\n\n“The Passion of The Christ” (2004). Mel Gibson directed this graphic, moving portrayal of Jesus’ final hours, with James Caviezel as Christ and subtitled dialogue in reconstructed Aramaic. The depiction of His scourging and crucifixion appropriately rates this R (restricted).\n\n“The Reluctant Saint” (1962). This unusual drama is a provocative biography of Giuseppe Desa, a 17th century farm boy who’d grow up to become St. Joseph of Cupertino. Maximilian Schell has the title role, and it features Ricardo Montalban.\n\n“The Robe” (1953) With its sequel “Demetrius and the Gladiators” this epic stars Victor Mature as a slave to Roman tribune Marcellus (Richard Burton), who copes with the Crucifixion and the birth of Christianity. The Oscar-winning film co-stars Jean Simmons, Susan Hayward, Michael Rennie and Debra Paget.\n\n“Song of Bernadette” (1943). Jennifer Jones won an Academy Award for her portrayal of a real-life, 19th century French girl who saw the Virgin Mary and dealt with the ensuing controversy. A moving tribute to faith and courage, it co-stars Lee J. Cobb and Vincent Price.\n\n“Therese” (1986). This biography of Therese Martin shows the 19th century woman fighting to be a cloistered nun and struggling to remain a faithful sister through terrible troubles. Portrayed by Catherine Mouchet, Therese died at age 24 in 189; in 1925 she was canonized as Therese, the Little Flower of Lisieux.\n\nContact Bill at Bill.Knight@hotmail.com; for archives, enter “mayflyproductions.blogspot.com” into web address bar."
