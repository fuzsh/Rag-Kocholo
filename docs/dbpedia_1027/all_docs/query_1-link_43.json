A La Compagnie LCC production.\n\nDecember 11, 2006The Musical Box at the Bell Center this Friday:\n\nSelling England By The Pound After the amazing success of their \"Lamb Lies Down\" show last November at the Bell Center, Montreal's own The Musical Box is at it again, and will this time present their stunning recreation of \"Genesis - Selling England By The Pound\" on Friday, December 15 2006 at the Bell Center theatre.\n\nWell known for their high quality re-creations of Genesisâ shows at the time of Peter Gabriel, The Musical Box will perform this meticulous recreation of the \"Selling England\" show that was originally presented by Genesis in 1973 and 1974, this famous concert is still considered today as the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance ofÂ their career. Impressively, The Musical Box is the only group to have obtained the Worldwide License of Genesis and Peter Gabriel.\n\nThis particular replica has required exhaustive visual, scenic, audio and musical research even tracking down the original music instruments used at the time. The visual aspect of The Musical Box's \"Selling England by the Pound\" is based on hundreds of amateur films and pictures taken at the Genesis concerts, as well as the original slides used by the group.\n\nThe Musical Box has presented 140 concerts in North and South America and another 10 in European cities, including a third time performance at the London Royal Albert Hall and two sold out nights at the legendary Olympia of Paris. After seeing their incredible \"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\" concert in Geneva last year, Phil Collins declared: Â«The Musical Box play it better than we didÂ Â».\n\nPerformed for the last time in Montreal in 2003 and at NEARFest on July 9 2004, \"Selling England by the Pound\" is a unique opportunity to discover this mystical Genesis concert and to relive a historic rock moment with The Musical Box!\n\nTickets are $41.50 - $51.50 (+ service charges) and are available at the Bell Centre box office and at all Admission outlets, also by phone at (514) 790-1245 or 1-800-361-4595 or online at www.admission.com and www.geg.ca. A Gillett Entertainment Group presentation!\n\nDecember 6, 2006The Australian Pink Floyd back at the Bell Center this Thursday!Back by popular demand on the first anniversary of their spectacular show at the Bell Center last year, The Australian Pink Floyd show, Floyd's best known tribute band, will be back in Montreal on Thursday, December 7 2006 again at the Bell Center (1260 De La GauchetiÃ¨re West).\n\nSince the performance of Pink Floyd at Live 8, London in July 2005 interest in The Australian pink Floyd Show has further increased, selling thousands of tickets in Europe this summer. Their sell out show in Liverpool, England sold over 8,000 tickets.\n\nÂ\n\nThe show is a phenomenon! What started out over ten years ago in Adelaide, Australia, has evolved into a truly magnificent sound and light spectacle performing to hundreds of thousands of people at major venues around the globe.Â David Gilmour, Pink Floyd's guitarist, is a fan himself, having witnessed the Australian Pink Floyd Show three times.\n\nÂ\n\nThese Aussie kindred spirits have amassed a dedicated crew of over twenty like-minded obsessives, all addicted to the gloriously pioneering psychedelia of Gilmour, Waters, Barrett, Wright, and Mason. Together they travel the planet putting on this spellbinding re-creation of the cream of the Pink Floyd catalogue, fulfilling the desire of Floyd fans everywhere who crave to hear these amazing songs performed live once again.\n\nÂ\n\nItâs a tantalizing voyage, from the trippy Barrett era to the mystery of Dark Side of The Moon, from the majesty of Wish You Were Here to the twisted intensity of Animals, from the relentless power of The Wall through to the lush grandeur of The Final Cut and The Division Bell. Floyd fans who havenât yet witnessed the show are seriously missing out. Believe the hype, itâs as good as everyone says. Here are some reviews: \"The best tribute show in the world\" â London Times \"I never thought I would hear this music live again, you must go and see this show\" â Los Angeles Times. NOTE: A new block of tickets has been made available for this highly anticipated show! Doors open at 6:30 PM and the show begins at 7:30 PM, tickets are $42.50 plus taxes and fees, and will be available starting October 7 through Admission by phone at (514) 790-1245 or online at www.admission.com. A Gillett Entertainment Group presentation.\n\nNovember 7, 2006Genesis Conference: Tour plans announced! The long awaited press conference of the group Genesis was held in London just a few hours ago as Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford announced plans for the Turn It On Again Tour, which will begin on June 11, 2007 at the Olympic Stadium in Helsinki.\n\nThe live group will be completed with the contribution of Chester Thompson on drums and Daryl Stuermer on guitars. Phil Collins will sing and play drums just like he used to, including the classic drum duets with Chester.\n\nThe original plan of this tour involved Peter Gabriel, and the group would have played The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, but Peter Gabriel declined to participate in this portion of the tour for the moment. There are no concrete plans as of yet with Peter Gabriel, but again, this hasn't been ruled out.\n\nSadly, there are no plans to include Steve Hackett in any of the tour projects. Here is Steve's statement about the reunion: \"First of all I would like to congratulate Tony, Mike and Phil for flying the flag once again. Good luck to them and I really hope they have a very successful tour. I was originally approached to discuss the possibility of a five piece which would have included Peter Gabriel and yours truly but since Peterâs schedule precludes this it makes sense for the other three to celebrate the brand in their own special way as it were...\"\n\nAmong the material that Genesis intend to play on the tour, they mentioned Los Endos, in The Cage, Afterglow, Domino, and material from Invisible Touch and We Can't Dance, they will also play their usual classic material medleys, but these will most probably be only instrumental. Among the material that will not be played, they mentioned Suppers Ready, no material prior to the Selling England album, nor any material from the album Calling All Stations. For the moment, there is no new material planned, and as for the tracks listed above, nothing is poured in concrete.\n\nThe tour will begin in Europe and about 19 dates have been confirmed between June 11 and July 12, 2007. There will be a North-American tour, but no dates have been announced yet. From what the bandmembers have mentioned, there will probably be more dates in Europe than in North America.\n\nA live DVD of the concerts is likely, but nothing has been planned yet.\n\nTo coincide with the Genesis tour, EMI Records will be re-issuing 14 Genesis studio albums in three stages during 2007. All the releases will be SACD/DVD double disc sets featuring newly re-mastered 5.1 surround sound and stereo mixes. The release schedule is as follows:\n\nMarch 2007: A Trick Of The Tail (1976), Wind & Wuthering (1977), …And Then There Were Three…(1978), Duke (1980) Abacab (1981)\n\nJune/July 2007: Genesis (1983), Invisible Touch (1986), We Can't Dance (1991), Calling All Stations (1997)\n\nLate 2007/Early 2008: Trespass (1970), Nursery Cryme (1971), Foxtrot (1972 ), Selling England By The Pound (1973), The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (1974)\n\nSpeculation on the early 2008 release of the Gabriel-era remasters may well indicate that something might be in the plans with Peter Gabriel at that date.\n\nSo there it is... the group will most likely announce a date in Montreal, as this city has always been a hub for progressive music and their performances were very well attended and most appreciated. More details later on the specifics of the North-American tour!\n\nNovember 6, 2006\n\nNovember 6, 2006Daryl Stuermer signs on Unicorn Digital!Unicorn Digital is proud to announce that legendary Genesis guitarist Daryl Stuermer has signed a deal with the label to release his new solo album entitled Rewired - The Electric Collection.\n\nThis new recording signals a renaissance and vital shift in musical direction for the Genesis/Phil Collins guitarist. Stuermer, formerly with fusion violinist Jean-Luc Ponty (1975-1978) and Genesis (1978-1992) as well as an essential part of Phil Collins' band since 1982, has chosen a collection representing ambitious, edgy, guitar-centric compositions.\n\nRewired is an opportunity for electric guitar to take the spotlight. Newly edited and completely re-mastered, Rewired is a must-have for anyone interested in the artist's remarkable career.\n\nThis is Daryl's first solo release since his Urban Island Music releases, Rewired will be unveiled worldwide on Unicorn Digital, November 14, 2006. Below is the tracklist of this new album:\n\n1) Yin Yang Boogie\n\n2) Road Warrior\n\n3) Determined\n\n4) Deadline\n\n5) American Fields\n\n6) Morning Train\n\n7) Wherever You Are\n\n8) Highland Hip Hop\n\n9) Transatlantic\n\n10) The Least You Can Do\n\nOctober 31, 2006New!

Coming off its most successful year to date, TSO will celebrate the eighth anniversary of its Christmas Eve & Other Stories tour this winter.\n\nThe group was formed in 1996 by composers Paul O'Neill, Robert Kinkel and Jon Oliva, who form the core of the writing team. Paul O'Neill is a rare talent; a prolific writer and producer with a tremendously varied career in the music industry, he shaped his passion for music around the varied sounds he was introduced to while growing up - from Queen to classical, Yes to Harry Chapin, Broadway musicals to Jim Croce. With Trans-Siberian Orchestra, he creates the music with no artificial limitations, seeking the fusion of classical, progressive, rock, Broadway and R & B influences.\n\nRobert Kinkel began working as an assistant engineer on productions for artists such as The Who, The Police and Genesis. He next began to work as an independent session keyboard player and writer. He began his collaboration with Paul O'Neill and Jon Oliva on the Savatage album Hall of the Mountain King, playing keyboards and doing orchestrations.\n\nJon Oliva is a self taught multi-instrumentalist, accomplished on keyboards, guitar, drums, bass, violin and cello. Jon is internationally renowned for his work as founder, writer, keyboardist and lead singer for the hard rock band Savatage. Jon became one of the core writers for the newly formed Trans-Siberian Orchestra.\n\nWith a release of The Lost Chrismas Eve in 2004 reach world-wide fame. Being recognized as a kind of Alan Parsons Project refering to the multiples collaborations of musician and their conceptual compositions. Take a little Christmas nostalgia, add rock, classical, blues and Broadway music, plus a dose of opera and lyrical poetry, then bathe the production in a spectacular light show, and youâll get an idea of what the Trans-Siberian Orchestraâs performance will be like.\n\nFormed around the core of Jennifer Cella on vocals, Al Pitrelli on guitar, Dave Z. on bass and Robert Kinkel on keyboards, the group is completed by a who's who of the most talented musicians including, Alex Skolnick, Chris Caffery and Angus Clark on guitar, Carmine Giglio, Mee Eun Kim and Jane Mangini on keyboards, John Lee Middleton on bass, John O. Reilly and Jeff Plate on drums, Anna Phoebe and Mark Wood on violins, Steve Broderick, Tommy Farese, Jill Gioia, Kristin Gorman, Danielle Landherr, Michael Lanning, Guy LeMonnier, James Lewis, Tany Ling, Stephanie Linn, Jay Pierce, Peter Shaw and Bart Shatto on vocals, with Tony Gaynor and Bryan Hicks as narrators.\n\nDoors open at 6:30 PM and the show begins at 7:30 PM, tickets are $45.50 to $55.50 (plus taxes and fees), and are available through Admission by phone at (514) 790-1245 or online at www.admission.com. A Gillett Entertainment Group / Live Nation presentation.\n\nNovember 18, 2006Coming to Montreal in 2007!FMPM 2007 is well along in its organization and most of the groups will be soon confirmed and announced on the FMPM site, as well as right here on ProgMontrÃ©al!\n\nOf course, also for the months leading to FMPM 2007, let me just throw some names in the wind... the incredible italian prog band The Watch might be coming in late March 2007... Our very good friends of the group Nathan Mahl have been itching to play in Montreal...

The opening act will be Wishmaster, a Nightwish tribute band. Doors open at 8:00 PM and the concert will begin around 9:00 PM. Tickets are $12, available at the door!\n\nOctober 19, 2006Genesis to reunite in 2007-2008...There have been rumours for a long time, many of them just wishful thinking from fans and enthusiasts, that legendary prog band Genesis would reunite, either for a tour or for an album.\n\nBut in the past few days, the BBC released a statement from the Genesis management confirming that Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford will reunite for a tour. A spokesman said that specific details of the tour and long term plans including possible new material would be announced in the next few weeks.\n\nCritical acclaim versus commercial success\n\nThe group sold well over 100 million albums during their three decade history, but only had commercial success after their original lead singer Peter Gabriel left for his own very succesful solo carreer. Their albums from the 70's, including Trespass, Foxtrot, Nursery Cryme, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and Selling England By The Pound are regarded as some of the best classic progressive music by many, but with the personnel changes following the departure of Gabriel in 1975 and guitarist Steve Hackett a year later, the band's output suffered through the 80's from the current pop wave at the time, and in an attempt to make the music more accessible and radio-ready, the group decided to take a more commercial direction. Their commercial success was proportional to the dissapointment of their old school fans. In 1996, Collins left and then there were two... Rutherford and Banks hired singer Ray Wilson for their next studio album and tour, but Calling All Stations was not as succesful as the previous albums such as Abacab and Invisible Touch and the North-American part of the tour was canceled due to poor ticket sales... that was the last drop in the bucket and the group has been on hiatus ever since.\n\nThere's nothing like a good rumour...\n\nEarlier in the year, the rumor mill started when Collins stated in an interview that he was open to the idea of a reunion and that the bandmembers, including Peter Gabriel, had met to discuss about a possible plan for a tour.\n\nGabriel bows out\n\nHowever, Peter Gabriel officially stated that he would not participate in this reunion for now. Gabriel said \"I'm very happy for them, it's not that I've ruled it out, but I've got some new material that I'll be working on\". So for now, fans can expect a reunion of the trio, and possible new material in the next year or so.
