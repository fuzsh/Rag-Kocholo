        "text": "This third and final concert of the “Four Elements” weekend emerges from the flames of hell with Marie Jäell – who, like Liszt, drew inspiration from Dante for her virtuoso piano cycle D’après une lecture de Dante… and reaches the celestial infinite with Hedwige Chrétien (“Vers l’infini”, “La prière”). The breath of the wind prompts meditation with Simone Blanchard, and even reflection with Fernande Decruck. The contemplation of the stars (Clémence de Grandval, “La chute des étoiles”) is an opportunity to daydream, or even lament in solitude, as depicted by Rita Strohl and Mary Howe. Finally, Amy Beach’s monumental Piano Quintet will bring the 2023 edition of the Festival Un temps pour Elles to a spirited end…\n\nFrench mezzo-soprano Fiona McGown began singing at the age of 12 with the Paris Opera Children’s Choir. She trained at the Maîtrise de Radio France and obtained a degree in Arts and Letters at Paris VII. She graduated from the Leipzig Hochschule für Musik and the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris. At the opera, she has played the roles of Dorabella in Cosi fan Tutte and Cherubino in Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro, Thetis and Victory in Sacrati’s La finta pazza, Flerida in Cavalli’s Erismena, Cybèle in Lully’s Atys, and Orpheus in Gluck’s Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\nShe has also performed in Zemlinsky’s The Dwarf, Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire, Stravinsky’s Pulcinella and in a concert in homage to Leonard Bernstein with the Orchestre de Paris.

She regularly performs in a duo with pianist Célia Oneto Bensaid and is invited to perform in numerous chamber music festivals. She is the author and creator of several pieces by the composer Camille Pépin, and sings Chamber Music in its first recording, which has received critical praise (fff Télérama, Choc de l’année du magazine Classica, Choix de France Musique).\n\nBorn in Paris, Raphaëlle Moreau comes from a family of musicians. She began playing the violin at the age of four. At fourteen, she entered the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris in Roland Daugareil’s class. At the same time, she followed the teaching of Pavel Vernikov. In 2018, she obtained a master the highest distinction in the class of Renaud Capuçon in Switzerland while pursuing a Diploma of Performer at the Conservatoire de Paris.\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Raphaëlle gave numerous recitals in Italy and was awarded first prize at the XVIIth Postacchini Competition. She performed as a soloist with the Georgian Chamber Orchestra, the Saint-Maurice Orchestra, the COGE Philharmonic, the Ostinato Orchestra, the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra, the Lithuanian Chamber Orchestra… Raphaëlle has a keen interest in chamber music and has been invited to the Festivals of Périgord Noir, the Colmar International Festival, the Stavelot Musical Festival, the Rencontres Musicales d’Evian, the Festival de Pâques d’Aix-en-Provence, the Lugano Musica season, the Rheingau Music Festival and shares the stage with her brother Edgar, Nicholas Angelich, Renaud Capuçon, David Kadouch, Alexandra Conunova, Mathieu Herzog, Adrien La Marca…\n\nShe made her trio debut at the Cologne Philharmonic, at the Konzerthaus in Dortmund as well as in recital at the Sommets Musicaux in Gstaad. In 2017, she was chosen by Renaud Capuçon to receive the Livio Benedetti Prize for a young artist. Raphaëlle Moreau is a 2016 laureate of the Rhine Gold and Nicati-de Luze Foundation and is graciously loaned a 1740 Domenico Montagnana by Mr. Jaeger.\n\nBorn in Paris into a family of musicians, the young violinist Alexandre Pascal studied violin with Suzanne Gessner at the CRR of Paris and then with Olivier Charlier at the CNSMDP where he brilliantly obtained his master’s degree with the unanimous approval of the jury. Alexandre Pascal has an intense activity as a soloist and chamber music player. He has performed in prestigious international festivals such as the “Festival Berlioz” in La Côte Saint-André, “Musique à l’Emperi”, Schiermonnikoog in the Netherlands, Saint-Yrieix, the “Flâneries de Reims”, the “Festival de La Prée”, the “Festival de L’Epau”, the “Festival de Cordes-sur-ciel”, the “Tons voisins” in Albi, Tanglewood Music Festival in the United States, and also in prestigious venues such as the Salle Gaveau in Paris, the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, accompanied by the Orchestre de chambre de Paris, the Victoria Hall in Geneva, the Grand Théâtre d’Aix en Provence, the Seine Musicale in Paris, the Nouveaux Siècles in Lille, NCPA in Mumbai and the Philharmonie de Paris.

Nominated “Révélation Classique” by the Adami in 2018, Alexandre plays on a Jean- Baptiste Vuillaume violin from 1852.\n\n“I consider music as a journey, a suspended moment that differs with each interpretation. Thus, the audience will be drawn, without detour, into a story that we will draw together.”\n\nThis conception of musical interpretation as a singular and immersive practice is the basis of Violaine Despeyroux’s artistic vision. Trained at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris, the Munich Hochschule and the Chapelle Musicale Reine Elisabeth, she distinguishes herself on stage by her personality and energy, both precise and electrifying.\n\nViolaine Despeyroux was unanimously awarded first prize at the National Competition for Young Violists, second prize and the prize for the best interpretation of Bach’s works at the Cecil Aronowitz International Viola Competition in Birmingham.\n\nA multi-faceted artist, she is equally at ease in chamber music or in the orchestra as a soloist. She has performed in France, Italy and Belgium, notably under the baton of Vahan Mardirossian and Ian Fountain. She has performed at the Victoria Hall in Geneva, at the Seiji Ozawa Hall in Tanglewood (USA), at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in Paris, at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels or at the Grand Théâtre de Provence in Aix-en-Provence – alongside renowned partners such as Renaud Capuçon, Gary Hoffman, Claire Désert, Suyoen Kim, Alexandra Soumm, or the Smoking Josephine Ensemble.

During her studies, she also benefited from the advice of Philippe Muller, Marc Coppey, Hatto Beyerle, Alain Planès and members of the Ysaÿe Quartet. She has performed with artists such as Xavier Phillips, Célia Oneto Bensaid, Dana Ciocarlie, Marie-Josèphe Jude, Léa Hennino, Alexandre Pascal….\n\nBorn in 1985, David Kadouch was taught by Odile Poisson at the C.N.R. in Nice, Jacques Rouvier at the CNSM in Paris, Dmitri Bashkirov at the Reina Sofia School in Madrid, and perfected his skills with Murray Perahia, Maurizio Pollini, Maria-Joao Pires, Daniel Barenboim, Vitaly Margulis, Itzhak Perlman, Elisso Virsaladze, and Emanuel Krasovsly.

Among his outstanding recordings, his disc “Revolution” (Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt, Debussy, Janacek, Dussek, Rzewski), was awarded a Choc Classica of the year 2019 and widely acclaimed by critics. In 2022, he recorded a disc devoted to the female composers of the period of Flaubert’s novel Mme Bovary for the Mirare record label.\n\nFrançois Lambret is an eclectic pianist, a passionate chamber musician, a teacher, and a sought-after accompanist of the greatest voices. He studied at the Conservatoire National de Paris (CNSMDP) and at the University of the Arts in Berlin (UdK), where he obtained an Artist Diploma and was awarded as a pianist and chamber musician.

His concerts in recent years have allowed him to perform in the most significant concert halls in Europe (Berlin Philharmonic, Salle Pleyel, Cité de la Musique), America (Teatro Colón) and Asia (Topan Hall). His recording of Alexandre Guilmant’s works for harmonium and piano was praised by the critics (notably the magazine Diapason).
