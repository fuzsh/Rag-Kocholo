        "text": "Pre-Contraction release from Canadian keyboardist Franck Dervieux. He was struggling with cancer at the time of the recording but managed to complete it before his death. Easily one of the best Canadian prog albums. This one is Prog with a capital \"P\" - strong British flavors.\n\n\"Franck Dervieux was the keyboardist of Jean Pierre Ferland one of Quebec's best known singers. Dervieux became ill with cancer and after regaining his strength, he released an album called “Dimension M” in 1972, in which his life's philosophy is aptly, yet abstractly, described on the insert. The band comprised Yves Laferriere (bass), Christiane Robichaud (vocals), Michel Robidoux (guitar), and Christian Saint-Roch (drums) who would all go on to form Contraction. Also present during sessions was Michel Seguin (percussion), who later formed Toubabou. All aforementioned musicians, minus Dervieux, would also become an important part of Ville Emard Blues Band (VEBB). They were also joined for this album by Terry King on violin.\n\nDervieux dedicates the album to his 3 doctors from Sherbrooke, who he says on the insert 'preserved' him. Indeed they saved him just long enough to produce what is undoubtedly one of the finest progressive music LPs to have emerged from Quebec. The importance of this album cannot be understated, in that its music spawned many other great progressive works melding different styles. Dimension M is mainly a keyboard-led instrumental LP, with a breezy feel to it, and some vocalizing by Robichaud as she warms up her voice for future performances in Contraction and VEBB. The album is a masterpiece of jazz and classically influenced progressive music, and is really the precursor to Contraction, which reprises many musical themes from Dimension M on its own albums. Dervieux takes inspiration both from wonders of the world as well as mythology, and to his own expressive and percussive compositions adds an interpretation of a Liszt piece. The music stays anchored in rock by the acid-drenched tone employed by Robidoux. Unfortunately, Dervieux died shortly after, but his spirit lived on well into the 1970's, providing much inspiration for Quebec's unique style of progressive rock. One can only imagine what this creative genius would have produced, had he lived longer.\""
