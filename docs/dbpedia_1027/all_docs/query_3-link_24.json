        "text": "Four years later, Marjo returned to the studio to record the album Bohémienne. She followed that with the tour Marjo chante le blues where she performed classics by Billie Holiday, Chuck Berry, Leroy Carr, and more. In 1997, during her performance at the Vieux-Clocher in Sherbrooke, she recorded Bootleg Blues.\n\nShe paused her songwriting for several years until she returned with Turquoise, in late 2005. In the summer of 2007, she took a bad fall during a performance in Jonquière and seriously injured her foot, setting her on a long rehabilitation process. Two years later, on July 2, 2009, for her return to the stage, she gave a bedazzling performance in front of an 80,000-strong audience at the Woodstock en Beauce Festival.\n\nShe then received a proposal for a new concept album featuring duets with male performers. Together with Martin Deschamps, Les Respectables, Jonathan Painchaud, Yann Perreau, Gilles Vigneault, Richard Séguin and Gregory Charles, to name but a few, she released Marjo et ses hommes Volume 1 and 2 a few months apart, in late 2009 and early 2010.\n\nSince then, the singer has tirelessly performed on stage throughout Québec. She was also a judge on La Voix during the 2022–2023 season.\n\nMarjo has managed her own brand and company since 2014. A free-spirited feminist without openly calling herself so, Marjo has helped a whole generation of women learn to accept and emancipate themselves. As a singer-songwriter, she has constantly sought to broaden the horizons of her art by experimenting with different genres while remaining rooted in the rock tradition. Having sold more than a million albums over her career, and with more than sixty songwriting credits under her belt—many of them hits—that have earned her 14 Félix awards, she has not only left her mark on Canadian musical history, but also paved the way for numerous artists including Anik Jean, Marie-Chantal Toupin and Marie-Mai. Her commitment to authenticity, power and emotion in music and lyrics has left a lasting legacy for generations to come.\n\nSimply put, she embodies the spirit of rock."
