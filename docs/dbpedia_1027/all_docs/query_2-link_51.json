        "text": "Child of the Dark: The Diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus was written by Carolina Maria de Jesus. It includes several pages of photography and an afterword written by Robert M. Levine. David St. Clair is the translator, and Audalio Dantas is the editor. This memoir was first published during 1960 and was published again during 2003 by Signet. It tells the story of de Jesus's personal account of life in Sao Paulo, which is located in the southeast of Brazil. Specifically, she sheds light on the suffering endured by the poor as they face the hardships of street life. The New York Times Book Review said \"it is both an ugly book and a touchingly beautiful book.\" Furthermore, the Book Review described tension between protesting the evils of such impoverished\n\nAnother difference is the presence of three judges in the movie, whereas in the play there were only two, both of whom where made out to be \"bad guys.\" One additional judge is added in the movie possibly to show that it was not the entirety of the Church that was unjust, cruel, and nearly ignorant. I\n\nFictional characters are persons that, when enlivened through careful, skillful writing and articulate literary elements, are incredible and relatable figures in any thoughtful novel. In Under The Feet of Jesus, the vibrant and distinct character of Estrella is thoroughly expressed as a young and passionate girl who struggles with her understanding of things that aren’t familiar— such “foreign alphabets” and Perfecto’s tools. Estrella is consumed in these emotions towards things she doesn’t understand, or know for sure, and expresses her moods without restraint. Helena María Viramontes, the author of Under The Feet of Jesus, uses selection of detail and figurative language to further develop this same iron-willed and impassioned character\n\nFor most people, growing up is easy because the majority of families have plenty of privileges, but they usually are overlooked since many expect more than what they already have. But in the story Under the Feet of Jesus by Helena Maria Viramontes, Estrella is a girl who is deprived of a steady home because she is constantly moving from farm to farm. While she works arduously in the fields every day in unbearable conditions she attempts to maintain a stable environment for her siblings. By doing so, Estrella learns how to take responsibility in her family because she is beginning to mature out of her childish self. As she matures into an adult, she discovers the ability to associate herself with other adults and how to take risks that\n\nIn 1971, when Jesus Christ Superstar made its first debut, a lot of heads began to turn. During this time period a lot of controversial subjects came to a head. Much disapproval and disagreement was obvious between different people and other religions. In some places, the musical was even condemned. While others played it every chance they could get. Jesus Christ Superstar was based on the crucifixion of Jesus and many were upset as to how the story was portrayed in the musical. The people felt that the way it was twisted to fit a musical was uncalled for. It was classified as a rock opera which was found to be rebellious and it had a negative connotation. People believed it wasn’t religiously correct to associate Jesus with the rock culture.\n\nChristian’s belief comes from loyalty, values, and allegiance. It is more than just a mental activity . The director illustrates it to the viewers by using religious symbols and imagery. The movie takes place in Louisiana, the fourth most religious state in the United States of America . It is clear to us that most of the characters, including the doctor that gives the lethal injections, are wearing crosses or cross pins on there clothes. The shots that the camera takes of Matthew’s arms show his tattoos of his daughter’s name, swastikas, and more but he does not have anything to do with religion. The director here is inconspicuously showing the viewers something very interesting. At the end of the movie, Matthew confesses to Helen of his sins and she replies: “the truth has set you free” and “you are the son of God” (1:33:45 min). He takes the responsibility of the murders of both those children and his dignity was returned to him. The characters such as the Percy’s and the Delacroix’s (R. Lee Ermy, Celia\n\nOne of the many things that puzzle people even today; is how Jesus was portrayed and how he became a part of history throughout the centuries. Fortunately, within the book Jesus Through the Centuries, written by Jaroslav Pelikan, readers are able to get a sense of what societies viewed Jesus as and how he was/is important to many aspects of the world such as; the political, social, and cultural impact he had left. As Pelikan discusses this very topic and theme in his book, we see how there’s a connection between his audience in this book and Jesus’s are closely similar. When he got his motivation to write about Jesus through the Centuries, Jaroslav had an open audience, which was intended for anyone of all ages, races, and beliefs to read\n\nThe film, “City of God” portrays numerous of brutal acts of violence and crime. This film depicts the deviant acts of a sociopathic gang leader, Li’l Ze and his fellow members. He recruits numerous of young kids and teaches them how to become a hood. He kills those who try to stop him from getting what he wants, which is being the one and only drug dealer. He leaves the town of Rio in distraught and in fear of their own life. Even when someone tries to get out of the slum and wants to begin a brand new life, they are shot and killed. This gives the impression that there is no escaping the slums. Once you are a hood, you are always a hood. Though living in poverty, all but one of the characters, Rocket, beats the odds and decides to not be lured into the deviance. Although not all children are delinquents or have criminal tendencies, those who are learn from the intimate groups they associate with. These deviant acts are depicted in several sociological theories such as: Agnew’s General Strain Theory, Learning Theory, Merton’s Strain Theory, Reckless Containment Theory, and Labeling Theory.\n\nWe journey through three different acts, each capturing a time in history where political forces were blurring the lines between the church and state. We have 1575 England; the year where Queen Elizabeth banned all religious plays from the country in an effort to better control her empire. Hitler visits Oberammergau Germany in 1934, attempting to use the Passion play performance as propaganda for his own political endeavors. And then we have South Dakota in 1969 to present day, when Reagan was pushing to restore\n\nBoth texts explore storytelling Moulin Rouge features a play, within a story, as Christian recounts his time at the Moulin Rouge and creating said play; Spectacular Spectacular. This technique and continuous “flashback” allows the audience to see the events as if they were happening for the first time and adds contextual information to the story, alluding the audience to the plot from the beginning. Luhrmann also utilizes dramatic irony through the plot of Spectacular Spectacular, which neatly summarises and foreshadows the plot of Moulin Rouge itself.\n\nReligion was a major factor in a number of Shakespeare’s plays. Religion motivated action and reasoning. In Shakespeare’s “The Merchant of Venice,” religion was more than a belief in a higher being; it reflected moral standards and ways of living. In the “Merchant of Venice,” “a Christian ethic of generosity, love, and risk-taking friendship is set in pointed contrast with a non-Christian ethic that is seen, from a Christian point of view, as grudging, resentful, and self-calculating.” (Bevington, pg. 74) Although Shakespeare writes this drama from a Christian point of view he illustrates religion by conflicts of the Old Testament and the New Testament in Venetian society and its court of law. These Testaments are tested through the\n\nFrom Jesus to Christ tells the story of how Jesus changed throughout his life from his birth to his death. The parts of the film depict on how Jesus life was shaped through his surroundings and influences on his life, the time after Jesus was crucified and how that sparked the movement of Christianity, the Gospels representation of who Christ was and their own story, and lastly how Christianity faced challenges. The first part begins as almost all Christians know the story, the angel Gabriel sent by God to Galilee to tell the virgin Mary she would bear a child named Jesus. Known as Jesus of Nazareth, later to the world as Jesus Christ, we know little about him other than the words of the Gospels, his birth two thousand years ago, his baptism, and his public execution. The hardest part is the lacking amount of material from the actual time of Jesus and trusting the words written decades later.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare’s comedy The Merchant of Venice tells the story of Antonio, a merchant, who borrows money from Shylock a Jewish moneylender to help his friend, Bassanio, marry a woman. The play highlights the tension between Jews and Christians in society through the interactions between Shylock and the Christians. In contrast, the play also highlights the positive aspects of both religions. The main point of The Merchant of Venice is to critique society’s treatment of religion."
