        "meta_description": "In recent years, harmonia mundi has developed a close partnership with the Museum of Music located at the Paris Philharmonie. The Stradivari collection invites the greatest performers to come and play on its rare instruments; these priceless treasures are the object of loving care lavished on them by their curators, and each volume in the series is conceived as a “match-up,” pairing one of the instruments with the suitable repertoire and with one or more musicians. This partnership has already borne incomparable fruit, as you can judge for yourself here.",
