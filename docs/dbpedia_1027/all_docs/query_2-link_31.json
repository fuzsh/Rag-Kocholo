        "text": "During Lent, Christians observe certain traditions: they avoid meat and eat fish, and they watch movies about the life of Jesus. There are so many of these movies, and their clichés are so well-known, that to watch one is to have watched them all … but for very few exceptions. These exceptions have historically, of course, often been considered blasphemous, or at least disrespectful. They often present alternative perspectives and theories that are at odds with the supernatural claims made by tradition. The Last Temptation of Christ was probably the most controversial one. It showed a very human Jesus falling in love and creating a family with Mary Magdalene. Not surprisingly, just as with Star Wars and other successful mythologies, a second-hand fan-fiction mythology has emerged–well, in reality, it was there all along from the onset–as attested by the success of the book and film The Da Vinci Code .\n\nIf you’re into gore, Mel Gibson’s Passion of the Christ has been the most sadistic presentation of the Gospel narrative of the torture and execution of Jesus. If you’re into musicals, Jesus Christ Superstar is the hippie-musical alternative. If you’re in the mood for a comedy, look no further than Life of Brian. There’s something for everyone.\n\nThen there’s the artsy Jesus of Montreal–which has been called one of the best Canadian movies of all time. There’s a French-language version with English subtitles, and a version dubbed into English with Spanish subtitles on YouTube. Jesus of Montreal is a retelling of the Gospel narrative within a modern, urban setting in the city of Montreal, Canada. It’s filled with allegory, the dialogue explores philosophical questions about living a life of meaning, and it heavily criticizes the hypocrisy and two-faced morality of the Catholic Church.\n\nJesus of Montreal was the end result, in part, of the Quiet Revolution–a series of societal transformations that took place in Québecois society beginning in the sixties, which saw the French-based culture moving further away from its Catholic roots, and to more firmly assert its secular values.\n\nIf I was to recommend a movie version of the life of Jesus to an atheist friend, confident that he would enjoy it, it would be this one. Why not celebrate Lent with an atheist-friendly film? Christian mythology–like Greek and Norse mythology–is an important part of Western culture and tradition, and provides great source material to consider our existential and societal issues. I know atheists who grew up Catholic and who are still moved deeply by many aspects of their former religion, from the imagery, to the architecture, to the music and some of the narrative.\n\nJesus of Montreal–because it cleverly and artfully reimagines an ancient myth in the setting of a modern city–reminded me of Orfeu, the Brasilian re-telling of the Orpheus myth which is set in the favelas–the poor neighborhoods in Rio. This movie is itself a remake of the 1959 movie Orfeu Negro. In the Greek myth, Apollo gave Orpheus a golden lyre and taught him how to play it. Orpheus fell in love with Euridice, who died, and he had to travel to the underworld to recover her. I have not seen the 1959 movie, but the more recent one was quite moving. I won’t give up too many details, but in Rio the concept of the underworld acquires a very particular meaning. Here, it relates to the counter-culture of crime, and Orfeu plays the guitar rather than the lyre.\n\nAncient Greek mystery religions allowed the mystes to participate in the sacred narrative by immersing themselves in them via the process of dramatic representation. They were meant to produce an insight and an experience that was ineffable–it could not be put into words, only experienced. Once exposed to the “mystery”, all the initiates “knew”, they could talk to each other with a new shared understanding of what they had experienced that only they had. Maybe a similar process happens in modern rituals like Burning Man, and maybe this is part of why I absolutely loved both Orfeu and Jesus of Montreal. These retellings of old myths are opportunities for a modern person to “witness”, relate to, and participate in these narratives via modern media and art. THAT is the point. The point is not to believe supernatural claims that insult our intelligence, but to participate in and enjoy the art of re-creation."
