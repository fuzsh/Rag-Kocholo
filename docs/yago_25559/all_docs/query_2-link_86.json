        "text": "Robert Scott Sterling, 62, died unexpectedly and much too soon on Feb. 29, 2020 in his adopted home of Atlanta, Georgia. He leaves behind his two precious children, Justin Sterling of Vancouver B.C. and Eden Sterling of Toronto, Ontario. His beloved first son Dylan died in 2014. Bob’s survivors also include a loving family of brothers and sisters, Sheryl, Sally, Susan, William and John Sterling; his nieces, Sara, Olivia, Melinda and Chloe Sterling; his nephews, Evan Scherer and Kyle and Brendan Sterling; many friends and anyone who had the fortune of being engaged in conversation by this friendly, curious stranger. Bob came into this world on May 29, 1957, as the fourth child of Robert Earl and Sara Jane (Evans) Sterling of Willard, Ohio. To many of those who knew him, Bob was larger than life, a force of nature and the person in a roomful of people who commanded attention. To be with Bob at his best was to be enveloped in laughter and love. Bob lived in Hamilton, Ohio after attending Ohio University, where he became involved in the city’s community theater family. In this he followed in the footsteps of his mother, from whom he inherited a beautiful singing voice and a love of performance. Bob’s adventuresome spirit then took him to New York City where he enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. While there he met another aspiring singer-thespian, Kim Foreman. The two married and moved to Connecticut where their three children were born. Bob’s career took him and his family to Amsterdam, working for his friend Jerome Mol, with whom he worked off and on the rest of his life. Bob had lived in Atlanta for the past two years. He was so excited to be moving into a new apartment and looking forward to the future. Bob believed so much that if you open your heart to universe, miracles will happen. And they did. He also believed that he was protected by his angels, those who had passed - his son, his parents, grandparents and friends. Now Bob is with them."
