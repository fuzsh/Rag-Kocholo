        "text": "Where’s Raymond? (Thurs. 8:30 p.m., ABC-TV) is an amusing exhibition of perpetual motion by Ray Bolger. As a fancy-free Broadway dancer who is the despair of his starchy manager-brother (Allyn Joslyn), Bolger squanders his salary, plays marbles with the neighborhood kids, habitually gets to the theater seconds before curtain time. But once onstage, he is his familiar self, dancing on rubber legs, rolling soulful eyes, singing like he never left his morning shower. Although the hero is a bit too addlepated, Bolger-in-motion makes up for all shortcomings. Sponsors: American Tobacco Co. and Sherwin-Williams Co.\n\nJamie (Mon. 7:30 p.m.. ABC-TV) puts eleven-year-old Brandon (Shane) De Wilde to work, as Jamieson John Francis McHummer. in the “heartwarming story of an orphan lad in search of a real friend among his many well-meaning relatives.” Young Brandon makes a captivating orphan, the trial and delight of his understanding grandfather, Ernest Truex. Sponsors: Duffy-Mott Co. and Ekco Products.\n\nTopper (Fri. 8:30 p.m., CBS-TV), after 27 years of consorting with ghosts in Thorne Smith’s novels and in the movies, starts all over again on TV. As Topper,\n\nLeo G. Carroll is properly stuffy and henpecked (by Lee Patrick) until a playfully dead young couple (Anne Jeffreys and Robert Sterling) and their 165-lb St. Bernard show him how to have his fun and his wife’s adoration too. Despite the convulsive dubbed-in laughter, it is a whimsical half-hour with a comic formula. Sponsor: R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.\n\nColonel Humphrey Flack (Wed. 9 p.m., Du Mont) is a supercilious old rogue (played by Alan Mowbray), who is supposed to be “a modern Robin Hood with a heart of gold” because the victims of his magnificent swindles are swindlers who think they are swindling him. This apparently makes everything all right. Sponsor: American Chicle Co.\n\nThe Marriage (Sun. 7:30 p.m., NBC Radio”) involves the family problems of Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, who made domesticity pay off handsomely in the Broadway hit play, The Fourposter. As Ben and Liz Marriott—17 years married, two children—they give refreshingly restrained performances, make the most of intelligently written scripts which sometimes skirt close to radio taboos, e.g., when daughter protests that brother has gone to the bathroom with the complete works of James Fenimore Cooper. Unsponsored."
