        "text": "At the age of 10, retiring IJ Editor Robert Sterling was already showing signs that ink was in his blood, that he was a natural born newspaperman. That’s when he began writing a newsletter for his four older brothers and sisters, reporting on the activities of his chickens and pet rats.\n\n“I’d always enjoyed writing, and I had a lot of animals,” he said, trying to keep a straight face. “So I’d file reports on their progress.”\n\nAs he retires this week after 19 years at the IJ, he can smile and look back at his boyhood backyard beat as the beginning of what has been a distinguished 40-year career in journalism as a reporter and editor in the U.S. and overseas.\n\nSterling, a trim 62-year-old, was hired as city editor of the IJ in January 2000 and was promoted to editor 12 years later.\n\n“We have been incredibly lucky to have Robert’s steady, skillful leadership for nearly 20 years in the city editor and editor roles,” said IJ President and Publisher Rob Devincenzi, who expects to announce a replacement by July 1. “The accolades the IJ has garnered over that span are a direct testament to Robert’s day-in, day-out determination and his manner of bringing out the best from a talented news team.”\n\nThat kind of excellence is even more impressive when you consider that it came at a most challenging time for community newspapers. In the digital era, sharp declines in print advertising have led to cost-cutting layoffs and shrinking newsroom staffs, threatening the survival of local papers across the country.\n\n“I worked for and with Robert and always respected his journalistic talent and passion as well as his tireless focus on delivering local news every day — whether it’s crimes and fires, community events, political debates, people’s achievements or the weather,” said editorial writer Brad Breithaupt. “That’s not an easy job, especially when current economic trends have meant we’ve had to do it with fewer people. But Robert has been tireless in fulfilling that mission.”\n\nRetired IJ city editor and county government reporter Nels Johnson described Sterling as “a gentleman who commanded attention without raising his voice,” earning the respect of everyone who worked for him.\n\n“Robert rallied the IJ staff during turbulent times,” Johnson said. “He leaves a legacy of community service, newsroom leadership and fair, accurate and honest reporting.”\n\nWorking in Europe\n\nSterling came to the IJ after nearly two years as an assignment editor for Stars & Stripes, the military newspaper in Europe. Based in a small town near Frankfurt, Germany, he supervised a team of reporters, traveled widely and helped open a bureau in Macedonia in the aftermath of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo crisis.\n\n“We needed to have reporters there, so it was pretty wild,” he recalled. “Living in Europe was fascinating. I’d had almost no exposure to the military, so that was a whole new culture to learn as well.”\n\nThe military culture may have been foreign to him but living in Europe wasn’t. He was born in the Hague, in the Netherlands, while his father, a university professor, was on sabbatical there. He spent another year of his childhood with his family in Vienna, Austria, where he learned to speak German.\n\nBack in the states, he grew up in the small university town of Davis. He edited his high school newspaper, worked as a teenage stringer for the local daily, the Davis Enterprise, and went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in rhetoric from UC Davis. After graduating, he landed his first full-time reporting job on the hometown paper, writing features and covering city government.\n\n“I’d go to assignments on my bicycle with my notebook in my pocket,” he remembered with a grin.\n\nWhile at the Enterprise, he met and married his wife, Jennifer Cook Sterling, a reporter from a Marin newspaper family. After two years, the young couple packed up and moved to New York City, where Sterling would get a master’s degree in journalism from Columbia.\n\nWhile living in Manhattan, in an apartment above a bar and next to a Puerto Rican social club, Robert commuted to Long Island to write for Newsday, and Jennifer wrote educational materials for Newsweek’s high school classroom program.\n\n“We loved living in Manhattan,” he said. “But we were away from family and missed the West Coast.”\n\nThe Oregon years\n\nThe Sterlings returned to the West after Robert was hired as a reporter for the Medford Mail Tribune, a daily in Oregon. He and Jennifer settled in nearby Ashland, where their three daughters – Annie, Caitlin and Rebecca — were born and where they would spend the next 14 years.\n\nIt was in Oregon that he really came into his own as a journalist. He started out humbly enough, writing a weekly fishing report and an outdoor column when he wasn’t banging out city hall news. That led to an important environmental beat at a time in Oregon when environmentalists were battling the timber industry over clear-cutting old growth forests, decimating the habitat of endangered species such as the spotted owl.\n\n“It was a huge issue,” he said. “Clear-cutting was going on and (the radical environmental group) Earth First! was spiking trees and chaining themselves to logging roads. It was a very emotional issue for a lot of people, and passions were really high. It was the most fun I’d ever had as a reporter.”\n\nHe would eventually become city editor of the Medford paper, a post that prepared him for the Stars & Stripes job and his work as a respected editor at the IJ.\n\n“As a reporter, I’d work hard on a story, trying to polish it to a nice sheen, but I always wanted a good editor to tell me how I could make it better,” he said. “I always remembered that as an editor and tried to do that as much as I could.”\n\nWhat’s next\n\nAs he leaves the IJ, he’s already planning to ease the transition from the workaday world. He and Jennifer – a fifth-grade teacher at Kent Middle School — are set to spend a few weeks on a hiking trip along part of the Camino de Santiago in Southern France. After that, he’s looking forward to some quality time with his family, including his two infant grandchildren, in the family cabin near Markleeville in the Sierra Nevada.\n\nHe hopes to do some travel writing, some recreational running (he’s run the Dipsea 11 times) and to catch up on some long-postponed reading.\n\n“I’d like to be able to read the New York Times in totality every day,” he said. “To me, being a well-informed citizen is a good goal in itself.”\n\nAn amateur brewmaster, he’s releasing a special beer this week in honor of his retirement, calling it “Over-and-Out Sterling Stout.”"
