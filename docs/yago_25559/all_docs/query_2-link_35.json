        "text": "History\n\nThe foundation is the namesake of Robert Sterling Clark, a member of the prominent New York business family, who lived from 1877-1955. Much of the Clarks’ wealth came from their relationship with the Singer Corporation, the leading purveyor of sewing machines. Clark’s father, Edward, is credited with helping create a global market for then-new Singer sewing machines in the late 1800s.\n\nRobert Sterling Clark and his wife Francine were avid art collectors, and eventually went on to found the world-renowned Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts.\n\nThe couple also had a heart for broader philanthropic causes outside the realm of the arts. Robert Sterling Clark incorporated his eponymous foundation in 1952, and it was endowed three years later upon his passing. Forward-thinking ahead of his time, Clark left no specific directives for how foundation resources should be allocated—instead preferring to defer to evolving philanthropic needs. As the world would change, so too was the foundation free to adapt and prioritize projects and areas of grantmaking focus.\n\nThe Foundation Today\n\nThe gift of freedom and flexibility that Robert Sterling Clark gave his foundation is one we celebrate, as it has brought us to where we are now. Today, the foundation champions leadership development—investing in individuals and the organizations that develop them, building the field, and commissioning key pieces of leadership research. Learn more about our philanthropic investments.\n\nOur approach is rooted in trust-based philanthropy—we consider our grantees to be true partners, and we empower them to keep their focus on their important work by reducing the demands often associated with grant applications and reporting. We also prioritize allocating unrestricted, multi-year grants whenever possible. Learn more about trust-based philanthropy."
