        "text": "Columbia Pictures\n\nAfter signing with Columbia Pictures in 1939, he changed his name to Robert Sterling to avoid confusion with silent western star William S. Hart.[3] His name was legally changed while he was a second lieutenant attending flight training in Marfa in West Texas in 1943.[4]\n\nSterling appeared in small parts for Columbia movies, often uncredited: Blondie Meets the Boss (1939), Romance of the Redwoods (1939), First Offenders (1939), Outside These Walls (1939), The Chump Takes a Bump (1939), That Girl from College (1939), and a serial Mandrake the Magician (1939).\n\nHe was in Only Angels Have Wings (1939), Missing Daughters (1939), and a short with Buster Keaton, Pest from the West (1939). Sterling was in Good Girls Go to Paris (1939), The Man They Could Not Hang (1939), Golden Boy (1939), The Gates of Alcatraz (1939), A Woman Is the Judge (1939), The Story of Charles Goodyear (1939), Scandal Sheet (1939), Mr Smith Goes to Washington (1939), Beware Spooks! (1939), Blondie Brings Up Baby (1939), The Amazing Mr Williams (1939), Glove Slingers (1939), The Awful Goof (1939) (a short), and Crime's End (1939).\n\nHe was in Nothing But Pleasure (1940) a Buster Keaton short, and The Heckler (1940) a short with Charley Chase,\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nAt 20th Century Fox he played the lead in Manhattan Heartbeat (1940) and Yesterday's Heroes (1940).

Sterling could also be seen in Dr. Kildare's Victory (1942) and This Time for Keeps (1942). He was billed third in Somewhere I'll Find You (1942), after Clark Gable and Lana Turner - one of MGM's biggest films of the year. But just as it seemed Sterling was about to break through as a star he joined the service.[6]\n\nPost war\n\nSterling served in World War II as a United States Army Air Corps flight instructor. He got out of the army in October 1945 and MGM announced him for The Last Time I Saw Paris but the film would not be made for several years, and not with Sterling.[7] He appeared in The Secret Heart (1946) at MGM.\n\nAt RKO he had the lead in Roughshod (1949). He made an independent Western, The Sundowners (1950) with Robert Preston and John Drew Barrymore, and did Bunco Squad (1951) at RKO.\n\nHe was appearing on Broadway in The Gramercy Ghost when he formed a relationship with actress/singer Anne Jeffreys.[8]\n\nOn television, Sterling starred in \"The Man Who Had Influence\", the May 29, 1950, episode of Studio One.[9] He also appeared on such shows as The Ford Theatre Hour, Showtime, U.S.A., The Clock, The Web (starring in the episode \"Homecoming\"), Faith Baldwin Romance Theatre, Celanese Theatre, Lights Out (one episode with Grace Kelly), Betty Crocker Star Matinee (an episode with Audrey Hepburn), Suspense, The Gulf Playhouse, Robert Montgomery Presents, Studio One in Hollywood (an adaptation of The Ambassadors), and Climax!.\n\nSterling had an excellent part as Steve Baker, opposite Ava Gardner as Julie, in the hit MGM 1951 film version of Show Boat. He supported Audie Murphy in Column South (1953). He and his second wife, actress Anne Jeffreys, also developed a night club act.[8]\n\nTopper\n\nSterling is perhaps most well known for starring with Jeffreys as the spirited George Kerby, to Jeffreys' Marion Kerby in the television program Topper, based on the 1937 original film Topper; Sterling played Cary Grant's role in the TV series, which aired on the CBS network from 1953 to 1955. Leo G. Carroll starred in the title role. Wife Marion Kerby was referred to as \"the ghostess with the mostest\", while Sterling's character was known as \"that most sporty spirit\". Mr. Carroll's titular character was introduced as \"host to said ghosts\".\n\nIn 1955 he and Jeffreys appeared in a TV production of Dearest Enemy, adapted by Neil Simon. He continued to guest star on such shows as The Loretta Young Show, Lux Video Theatre, Star Stage, The 20th Century-Fox Hour, The Ford Television Theatre, Cavalcade of America, and Telephone Time.\n\nOn December 18, 1957, Sterling and Jeffreys played a couple with an unusual courtship arrangement in \"The Julie Gage Story\" on the first season of NBC's Wagon Train.[10]\n\nLove That Jill\n\nIn 1958, the couple co-starred in another comedy series, Love That Jill on ABC. Sterling and Jeffreys portrayed heads of rival modeling agencies in New York City.[11]: 631\n\nSterling appeared on The United States Steel Hour, then returned to features at Fox. He had good roles in Return to Peyton Place (1961), as Mike Rossi, husband of Eleanor Parker, and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961) for Irwin Allen.\n\nIchabod and Me\n\nIn the 1961–1962 television season, Sterling co-starred with George Chandler and Reta Shaw in CBS's Ichabod and Me.[11][12]\n\nIn 1963, Sterling starred in The Twilight Zone episode \"Printer's Devil\" alongside Burgess Meredith. He was also in The Alfred Hitchcock Hour and Naked City, plus A Global Affair (1964) with Bob Hope.\n\nLater career\n\nAfter some additional television work in the early 1960s, Sterling made only sporadic appearances in later shows such as the hospital drama The Bold Ones, the sitcoms Nanny and the Professor, Love, American Style, Diana and The Brian Keith Show, the TV movie Letters from Three Lovers (1973), and the miniseries Beggarman, Thief in 1979.[13]\n\nIn the 1970s Sterling was a vice president and the spokesman for a company that implemented the software for one of the first supermarket barcoding and computer inventory systems. He later launched Sterling & Sons, a Santa Monica company that manufactured custom golf clubs.[8]\n\nIn the 1980s he guest starred on shows like Fantasy Island, Simon & Simon, Masquerade, Murder, She Wrote, and Hotel.\n\nSterling's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is located at 1709 Vine Street."
