But Mitch gets concerned when Sara quickly develops a dangerous obsession with him and tries to win his affections at any cost. When Mitch lets Sara down, she immediately shows her true colors and plots to make Mitch's life a nightmare. Meanwhile, April and Manny join a charity kite-flying charity contest arranged by Newman for his nephew Todd, a bitter, diabetic young boy who resents not being able to play with other kids due to his illness."
