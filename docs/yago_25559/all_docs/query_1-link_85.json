He was 88.\n\nSterling died Tuesday of natural causes following a decade-long battle with shingles, said his son, Jeffrey.\n\nAlthough he appeared in dozens of movies, Sterling was best known for the 1953-1956 TV series \"Topper,\" based on the Thorne Smith novel, and the 1937 film starring Cary Grant and Constance Bennett.\n\nSterling and Jeffreys, a Wayne County native, played George and Marion Kirby, a fun-loving couple who were killed in an accident but returned as ghosts to haunt the new occupant of their home, a banker named Cosmo Topper."
