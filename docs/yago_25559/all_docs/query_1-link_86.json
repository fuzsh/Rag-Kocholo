        "text": "A charming publicity shot for the 1953 series TOPPER. That's Leo G Carroll as uptight repressed banker Topper, and his transparents pals are Robert Stirling and Anne Jeffreys as George and Marion Kerby. (The actors were actually married, which gives their sassy banter a feeling of ease.) Not shown is the real star, the fondly remembered alcoholic St Bernard Neil. Below is a repost of my review of the Thorne Smith novel that inspired this show, a few fine movies and a dismal remake or two. But given the right cast, this might be ripe for a new version.\n\nA review of From 1926, this is the most famous book written by Thorne Smith (1892-1934). Although it was made into a fine movie with Cary Grant and Constance Bennett, TOPPER is best remembered today because of the 1950s TV series with Leo G. Carroll, Anne Jeffreys and Robert Sterling. (Who doesn't have fond memories of Neil, the alcoholic St. Bernard ghost dog?)\n\nBut the book is quite a different work than that pleasant, mild little program. It's deeper and more introspective, with an underlying melancholy. Some of the elements which were so outrageous and risque back in 1926 have lost much of their shock value. For a screwball comedy classic, it ends on a bittersweet note that is surprisingly touching*. TOPPER does sag a bit halfway through as the momentum droops (it's hard to keep a frivolous note for too long), but it's well worth finishing.\n\nWe find Cosmo Topper, a 40ish banker stuck deeply in a rut so stifling that he can't even bear to think about it. His wife controls him through martyrdom and sad sighs, suffering her dyspeptic pains and giving him cold looks. He's comfortably off in a material sense, but there is that vague feeling of loss so many people sense without understanding what it is. Then, quite by chance, he happens on a man who has a car for sale... the same car in which, three months ago, a married couple called George and Marion Kerby thumped into an oak with fatal results (for them, not the oak).\n\nIt's not giving anything away to reveal that, when Topper buys the car and learns to drive, he finds that he now has two new friends who are ghosts. Even if you had never heard of the films or TV show, every edition of the book explains the premise. The Kerbys are \"low plane\" spirits, not immediately interested in ascending to the higher afterlife. They are basically still hellraisers, concerned with pranks on the living and their constant snippy repartee. They also drink constantly, feeling the effects quite as much as would flesh and blood creatures.\n\nOne difference from the TV version is that George meanders off early and it's Marion who attaches herself to Topper, despite his attempts to disuade her. Normally tangible but invisible, these spectres can materialize but it takes concentration. Much of the time, Topper is dealing with objects floating around him, a soda being sipped through a straw with no one drinking it, and impudent comments out of the air. Naturally, bystanders are either in panic or hysterics at these antics, as Topper tries to come up with explanations. A lot of this is still very funny. The moment when Marion (dressed in a white robe) materializes into view over a minister giving a sermon, is a delight.\n\nFor most of the book, Topper has taken a vacation from his job and driven off on a journey of discovery. He goes through the rite of passage that most of us experienced as teenagers... that one endless summer of staying out all night, having long drunken debates on the meaning of life, dancing under the moon and waking up in a field somewhere. Marion Kerby is exasperating and charming, insolent and caring, full of mischief and also enjoying existence more than the literally living Topper does. Inevitably, he starts to fall in love with her, despite the knowledge that George will eventually come back and there will be an enraged phantom to cope with.\n\nIn 1926, Prohibition was still in effect and in theory, you couldn't buy whiskey in America. In practice, of course, people were drinking more than ever BECAUSE it was forbidden. The ghosts are constantly working their way through bottle after bottle of scotch and Topper joins in. (This gets a bit tedious after a while; no wonder these characters are dead.) So there is the illicit thrill of the continous guzzling, as well as the suggestive fact that a physically solid woman is snuggling and travelling with a married man who has run off with her. (Since Marion notes her marriage vows had that clause about until death do them part, she feels she no longer needs to be bound by that hitch.)\n\nStarting out as a hopeless walking zombie in a suit and bowler, eating the same dinner every night and then reading the evening paper in a stuffy living room, Topper has by the end reached some enlightenment. He may go back to his wife and job eventually, listen to the same conversations on the commute to work, sit at the same desk and sign meaningless papers all day. But he is not the same. He has seen beyond the trap, and he is certain to start making changes.\n\n_______\n\n*\"But somewhere out there between the wind and stars, Marion Kerby was drifting, drifting farther and farther away.\"\n\n____"
