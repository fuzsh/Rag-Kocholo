Bob never met a stranger and was respected, admired and enjoyed by all who knew him. He served in the 5th Air Force in the Korean War and lived at the Ohio Veterans Home in Georgetown the past two years. He was a member of the Sampson AFB Veterans Association and Mt. Orab, OH VFW Post 9772. Preceded in death by his parents, Robert Sterling and Myrtle Bunce, and childhood sweetheart and wife of 64 years, Mary Hopper. He leaves a cherished daughter, Tracy, and son-in-law, Adam; a grand-dog, Princess; a brother, Fred Sterling; a sister, Cyndie Earl; and several nieces, nephews and cousins who adored him. Originally from Mohawk, NY, Bob and Mary moved from Herkimer, NY to Lansdale, PA in 1977. Bob retired in 1984 from Unisys (formerly Univac and Sperry) in Blue Bell, PA and worked at the Philadelphia and Ambler campuses of Temple University from 1986-1997. Since moving to Milford, OH in 2002 to be closer to their daughter, he and Mary were active community volunteers for seniors, recipients of the 2007 Clermont 20/20 Salute to Leaders Award, and members of the Goshen Township Historical Society. In 2017, they helped create Mom’s Antiques & Treasures in Morrow, OH, after 60 years of antique collecting. A remembrance was held November 1 at the Spirit of ‘76 Memorial Park within Miami Meadows Park in Milford, OH, at the Korean War Memorial that Bob was instrumental in establishing in 2013. He will be laid to rest with his wife at the Frankfort Hill Cemetery in upstate NY, with a graveside remembrance, on Saturday May 22, 2021 1:00pm - 3:00pm .
