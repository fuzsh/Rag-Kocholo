        "text": "Robert (Bob) Earl Sterling, 82, of Spokane, WA, passed away peacefully at home May 19, 2024 in Spokane, WA. Bob was born in Spokane, WA on April 28, 1942 to Cecil & Hazel (Erma) Sterling. Bob graduated from Shadle Park H.S. in 1960. He was married to Louise (Roberts) Sterling on February 14, 1981 in Spokane, WA. They enjoyed 43 years of marriage together. Bob began his career with the Spokane Fire Department in 1964 and was a lifelong supporter of Spokane Fire Dept. Foundation. In 1967, He and his partner, Bob Miller, bought the Midas franchise in Spokane. In 1973, Bob bought out Mr. Miller and went on to own and operate numerous Midas franchises throughout the Western U.S. and Hawaii until 2010. In 1997, he started Exhaust Technologies and invented the Air Cat Pneumatic Tool technology. Exhaust Technologies was sold in 2014 and he and Louise retired, splitting their time between WA & AZ. Bob led a very adventurous life and enjoyed hunting, fishing and boating. He especially enjoyed his hunting and fishing trips with his brothers, Ron & Keith Sterling. Bob loved spending time with his family and taking trips to Hawaii, Alaska and Las Vegas to create memories with them. He and Louise took the trip of a lifetime to Africa where they spent a month on a guided safari. Everyone who knew Bob would agree that he was a “jack of all trades. There was nothing he couldn’t fix, and if there wasn’t a ready solution, he’d invent one. In his later life, he enjoyed attending his grandchildren’s activities and was a main stay in the bleachers. Bob was never one to sit around, and he was working on new inventions right up until his passing. Bob loved to support local charities and was a quiet contributor to many throughout his life. He is survived by his loving wife, Louise, children Tami (Jerry) Shaw, Matt (Lori) Sterling, Angie (Butch) Alderman, Ryan (Erica) Layton, siblings Ron Sterling, Keith Sterling, Nancy Hooper and Carol Woods. He also leaves behind 10 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren. The family would like to extend special thanks to M.D. Anderson Cancer Care in Arizona, Sacred Heart Medical Center, Providence Hospice and the numerous first responders who provided wonderful care. In lieu of flowers, please donate to St. Jude’s, or the Spokane Fire Department Foundation. A Celebration of Life will be held June 29th from 11am-2pm in The Loft at Northern Quest.\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of Robert Earl Sterling, please visit our floral store."
