        "text": "Anne Jeffreys, an actress who played Tess Truehart in the early “Dick Tracy” serials, starred in the fantasy sitcom “Topper” and spent two decades on “General Hospital,” has died. She was 94.\n\nEntertainment reporter for Los Angeles’ KABC George Pennacchio was one of the first to tweet the news on Wednesday night. Others followed, including multiple friends on Facebook who confirmed the news. Details of her death were not widely available.\n\nHer longest-running role was on the ABC soap opera “General Hospital” and its spinoff “Port Charles,” in which she played the snobby, wealthy socialite Amanda Barrington over the course of 20 years.\n\n“Anne was a beloved member of the General Hospital and Port Charles families,” a spokesperson from the show said in a statement. “We’re deeply saddened by the news of her passing and all feel so lucky to have known her and will never forget the many talents she brought to GH and Port Charles.”\n\nJeffreys, who was born in Goldsboro, N.C., in 1923, got her start in entertainment as a teenager, beginning as a junior model and studying to eventually perform in the opera.\n\nShe eventually made her way into other stage musicals on Broadway.\n\nJeffreys had a long career on the stage, with starring roles in the 1948 Cole Porter musical “Kiss Me Kate” on Broadway as well as “Three Wishes for Jamie,” “Carousel” and “Camelot.”\n\nThe Pantages Theatre in Hollywood posted a message on Facebook in honor of her passing.\n\nShe appeared in multiple movies and TV shows throughout her career, including episodes of “Love, American Style,” “Murder She Wrote,” “Finder of Lost Loves” and “Baywatch.”\n\nJeffreys was married to the actor Robert Sterling from 1951 until his death in 2006. The two starred together in the sitcom “Topper” as a couple who had been killed in an avalanche, but continued on to haunt the new owner of their old home. They had three sons."
