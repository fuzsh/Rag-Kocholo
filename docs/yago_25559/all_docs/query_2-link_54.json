He is preceded in death by his parents, brother Bill Sterling, and brother Paul “Bus” and wife Jean Sterling.\n\nBob served in the United States Army Air Corps from 1944 – 1946. Upon his discharge, Bob enrolled in Eastern Illinois University, graduating in 1951, and in 1953. During his undergraduate years, Bob served as co-editor of the Daily Eastern News. Bob enrolled in post graduate studies at the University of Illinois and received a Honorary Doctorate degree from Eastern Illinois University in 2009. Bob spent 5 years teaching high school social studies and history at Charleston High School, Kankakee Junior High School, and Oak Lawn High School before beginning his career at Eastern in 1956.\n\nBob served as an Assistant Professor in the EIU History Department from 1956 until his retirement in 1999. He also served in various leadership capacities while at Eastern including serving as Student Teacher Coordinator and as Acting Department Chair.\n\nBob touched the lives of each student that sat in his classroom making history come alive. He was active in preserving local Lincoln history, assisting in the planning and implementation of museum exhibits for the Lincoln-Douglas Museum, serving as a character in the C-Span presentation of the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, and serving on the Looking for Lincoln Tourism Committee. He did extensive research, published numerous articles, and was a nationally recognized speaker on Civil War topics.\n\nBob’s second career in auto racing began in 1946, as a writer with National Speed Sport News.

Bob was also a member of the ABC Sports broadcast team that received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Live Sports Special coverage of the Indianapolis 500 in 1989 and 1990. Bob worked with auto racing and sports broadcasting greats and was a favorite to work with because of his unique ability to study the details of the technical side of racing and relay it to the broadcasters.\n\nBob was a member and past president of the American Political Items Collectors, a member of the Toy Train Collectors, a former pilot, and enjoyed golfing, bowling, and traveling. He was a member of Wesley United Methodist Church in Charleston.\n\nVisitation will be at 10:00 on Monday, February 14, 2022 at the Wesley United Methodist Church, Charleston, with the funeral at 11:00.
