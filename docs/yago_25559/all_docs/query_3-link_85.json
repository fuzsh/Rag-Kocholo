        "text": "LOS ANGELES, June 1 (UPI) -- The star of the 1950s TV show \"Topper,\" Robert Sterling, has died in Brentwood, Calif., at age 88.\n\nSterling died of natural causes Tuesday but had been bedridden with shingles for five years, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSterling joined MGM studios in the 1940s and appeared in dozens of films including \"Two-Faced Woman\" with Greta Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, \"Johnny Eager\" with Robert Taylor with Lana Turner and \"Somewhere I'll Find You,\" starring Clark Gable and Turner.\n\nActress Ann Rutherford, who starred with Sterling in \"This Time for Keeps,\" told the Times she was \"dazzled\" by her co-star's \"good looks.\"\n\n\"You just never caught him acting,\" Rutherford said. \"He was such a good actor and a delightful person. ... He had it all. He had a beautiful wife and a wonderful family.\"\n\nSterling was best known for his ghostly role of George Kerby in the TV sitcom, \"Topper.\" The show based on the movie of the same name ran in from 1953 to 1955 on CBS and was rerun on both ABC and NBC, the Times said. His wife, Anne Jeffreys, portrayed his wife in the sitcom as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple had three sons."
