        "text": "Robert “Bobby” Merrill Noble went to be with Jesus on December 13, 2022.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, Howard S. Noble and Barbara Wyatt Noble.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Pamela Wilson Noble; son, Robert Sterling Noble; Grandchildren, Malahki and Lucien Noble; sister, Debbie Quinn (Dennis Quinn); brother, Howard Noble (Beth Noble). Bobby was also survived by many other loved family members and friends.\n\nBobby was in construction all of his life, taught by his father and he passed his knowledge on to his son. He built houses, many renovations, additions and decks. He did many unique and creative projects. He loved doing new things when his clients allowed him to be artistic. A hard working man, ask anyone who worked with him.\n\nBobby enjoyed horseback riding with his best friend since high school, Gregg Morgan. Riding his Harley and dirt bikes with the grandkids. He loved music and playing bass.\n\nThe happiest day of his life was when Sterling was born, and the second happiest was when his grandkids were born, Malahki and Lucien.\n\nIn 1989 Bobby started putting his favorite bible verse on the tailgate of his truck, John 3:16. For God so Loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. The sign company who did this for Bobby would only charge him for materials, no labor. The last truck he had, a 2015 Ford F-250 he added the Lord’s Prayer. Our Father which art in Heaved Hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. And lead us not to temptation but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and glory forever, Amen. This was his way of sharing his faith.\n\nWe had 37 years together, married for 33, dated for 4. He always said credit for time served. He was my cowboy, my biker buddy, my rock star. He could make me happy, he could make me mad. In the early years whenever there was a fuss, we used to say “ ‘til death do us part”. In the middle years it was “oh, well. It’s in the contract”. In the later years, it was “we need to rewrite this contract”. He was my tough guy and my sweetheart. He could make me laugh. A few nights back when we were sitting in the den, he said “Hey, babe. I think I hear a mouse in the kitchen” I said “Okay, I’ll get the mousetrap”. He said “You will have to do it, with me maybe getting closer to meeting my maker I’m not ending anyone’s life” and we both laughed. I think I heard that mouse last night. He was my guy and will always be my guy.\n\nMany will be crying for Bobby Noble, and that’s okay, but when the tears have stopped, think of a funny story and memory with Bobby, smile and laugh. That’s what he wants for us."
