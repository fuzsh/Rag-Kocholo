        "text": "Sumeet Raghavan is one gifted actor. He is a great comedian and some great shows like Sajan Re Jhoot Mat Bolo and Sarabhai v/s Sarabhai to boost being part of. He also showcased his singing prowess in Zee TV’s Star Ya Rock Star. Below he gives an insight into his life. Read on:-\n\nI am: Beautiful.\n\nLife is: Wonderful.\n\nLove is: Completion.\n\nMarriage is: something I can’t remember.\n\nYour first crush: Angelia Jolie.\n\nYour dream date: That has to be Angelia Jolie again.\n\nYour best childhood memory: When I got an award.\n\nOn your last birthday: I was with my wife and kids.\n\nYour long-lasting friend: Sachet Patil.\n\nDo you make friends easily: Yes, very easily.\n\nMusic you like: Classical, Ghazals and folk.\n\nOne thing you want to change about yourself: My laziness.\n\nFavourite TV show: Sarabhai v/s Sarabhai.\n\nFavourite Bollywood actor: Big B.\n\nFavourite Bollywood actress: Waheeda Rehman.\n\nFavourite Hollywood actor: George Clooney.\n\nFavourite Hollywood actress: Angelia Jolie.\n\nFavourite cartoon character: Tom and Jerry.\n\nLast movie you watched: Kahaani.\n\nLast time you boarded a local train: 16 January 2011.\n\nLast time you were stalked: When I was doing a play in 1990.\n\nLast time you cried on screen: In Saajan Re Jhoot Mat Bolo.\n\nLast time you cooked: Today.\n\nAdvice to youngsters: Don’t give up on your dreams, they do\n\ncome true.\n\nAfter nearly three years online, Jay Hind! has found a taker on the small screen. Last weekend, Colors quietly launched the online spoof-show’s telly version called The Late Night Show. It airs at 11 pm. According to host-actor Sumeet Raghavan, the show doesn’t have anything to do with\n\nDavid Letterman’s show of the same name.\n\n“We’re glad we managed to get a similar title,” he chuckles. “I’ve watched that show, and so has Abhigyaan (director-producer Abhigyaan Jha). We’ve ensured that we don’t have any segment similar to his.” Jay Hind! started in August 2009, and in five months had more than 20 million hits. The reason for its instant popularity was the fact that it was India’s first web show and it minced no words while taking potshots at celebrities, popular events and shows.\n\nWhen asked why these ‘special comments’ are missing from the TV version, that so far doesn’t have a number of episodes fixed yet, Sumeet admits it’s been done at the channel’s behest. “They have their reasons to not offend someone. And we also didn’t want people grabbing us by our collars, grilling us on what business we had poking fun at them,” says Sumeet, who believes the show’s online version, which he still hosts, works like slow poison. “A TV show gathers instant reactions. So we have to water down whatever we say.”\n\nJay Hind! has an international English version called Better Late Than Never that highlights global issues with a funny twist. The host says he would love to merge that into The Late Night Show. “I don’t think it would pinch anyone if we added some humour about international events and faces,” says Sumeet. “If we went overboard, at least they won’t instantly bash us.”\n\nSUMEET SIR's first ever attempt to dance in a Comedy show and he has done that beautifully. He dones the look of Different actors from the film industry and has done full justice to it.\n\nHere are some of some of his cool pics\n\nAs SANJEEV KUMAR and HEMA MALINI\n\nAs RAJESH KHANNA and ZEENAT AMAN\n\nAs JEETENDRA and SRIDEVI\n\nAs JEETENDRA and SRIDEVI\n\nAs JEET5ENDRA and SRIDEVI\n\nAs JEETENDRA and REENA ROY"
