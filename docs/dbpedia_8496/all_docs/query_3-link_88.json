        "text": "A familiar face as Sahil of Sarabhai vs. Sarabhai, Sumeet Raghavan is trying out new things in life. After dabbling in Marathi theatre, Bollywood and\n\nadvertisements, Sumeet is currently busy hosting a show that is first of its kind in India. He is a stand-up comedian in a late night comedy show on the Internet - Jay Hind.\n\nThe versatile performer, who has been in the entertainment industry for over 25 years, is making people fall off their chairs (literally) with his rib-tickling jokes!\n\nThe show was launched on August 15 this year as a sequel to the popular stand-up comedy series Movers and Shakers. It has managed to keep it's viewers growing irrespective of the uncountable reality shows, talent hunts and sitcoms on TV. Jay Hind, has managed to find more than a million viewers in a short span of two months and is growing everyday! What's more? The episodes or rightly put 'web'isodes, can be viewed anytime, anywhere unlike television. The show goes live every Monday and Thursday at 10 pm for 15-20 minutes or may extend upto 30 minutes. Here's a dekko...\n\nWe caught up with the telly actor (now, a webby actor!) for more insight on Jay Hind's success...\n\nTell us about your experience of being a part of Jay Hind.\n\nIt has been a great experience to be a part of Jay Hind. This is the first time I am hosting a stand-up comedy show and I have got an amazing response from people. The concept in itself is very unique and I am thrilled to be a part of it.\n\nWhat do you think makes you clickable?\n\nStand-up comedy is a new talent that I have explored and have also realised that I am pretty good at it. I have people adding me on Facebook everyday and the number of clicks we get has been increasing steadily. We managed to get a million viewers in a short span of two months, which is remarkable. This show is completely different from what I have done in the past. I also try to be not too harsh in my approach while performing. Also, considering that I have earned a goodwill in the industry - makes me clickable.\n\nDon't you think the show would have been even more popular had it been on television?\n\nNo, not at all. I think these days people are spending much more time on Internet than watching television. Youngsters are more tech savvy than ever and they are audience we are targetting. We have got a wonderful response so far. I don't think being on the Internet is a disadvantage at all.\n\nHave you ever been compared to Shekhar Suman?\n\nThankfully, not! Shekhar had carved a niche for himself and his name was synonymous with Movers and Shakers. I am glad that people have accepted me in this new role.\n\nWhat kind of topics do you cover on the show?\n\nIt varies from politics to sports, government policies, Rakhi's swayamvar to Bigg Boss. Almost everything you can think of!"
