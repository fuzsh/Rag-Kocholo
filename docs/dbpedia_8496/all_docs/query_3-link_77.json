        "text": "While his co-actors are busy in the gym to get back into shape for the second season of Sarabhai vs Sarabhai, Sumeet Raghavan aka Sahil Sarabhai is taking a different route. As fit as ever, Sumeet is spending his time watching all the episodes of the show that is now making a comeback as a web series. The actor believes that in these 10 years he has played many different characters which have made him more mature as an actor and so it is important for him to again get into the groove all over again. He makes it a point to watch these episodes in between his shoots and post his pack ups. Says Sumeet, “The characters of Sarabhai vs Sarabhai are all extremely human and real and that’s where the humour lies. One can relate to these characters. Not a single one is far fetched, so to get the real essence and the vulnerability, it was paramount to revisit Sahil.\n\nOn his look, Sumeet says that there is no change. Sumeet also had a great time in the first script reading session after years. He says, “We had a great time for the script reading. I mean what do you expect when the Sarabhais meet. It was complete madness and I can’t wait to start shooting.”"
