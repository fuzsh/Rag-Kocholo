        "text": "Mahabharat is currently re-running on Colors TV and Star Bharat. The epic TV show, which originally ran on Doordarshan from 1988 to 1990, had a huge ensemble cast. Most of you might not have recognised, but the actor who played young Sudama (Krishna's friend), was Sumeet Raghavan.\n\nThe Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai actor worked on the show when he was just 16 years old and looks unrecognisable. Apart from Sumeet, Daboo Malik and Chetan Hansraj were also a part of the show.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSpeaking about Mahabharat, Sumeet revealed that he did have an idea that the show would create history. \"I was very young when I bagged the role, and as excited as any new kid on the block. I was quite skinny at the time, probably that’s why I got the role! (laughs). We had barely shot for 3 to 4 days and I remember shooting the Sandipani Ashram portions in Film City and the rain dance sequence at Chena creek. Back then, I did not realise that I was going to be a part of history. But I do remember seeing Mukesh ji (Khanna) and Nitish ji (Bharadwaj) on the set. They were in their prime then, and I was completely in awe of them,\" he said.\n\nSumeet was bombarded with questions on his social media after his fans spotted him on the show. \"Once the episodes were aired again, there was a flurry of questions on my social media. People were taking screenshots of the episode tagging me, asking, 'Is this you? We never knew you were a part of this epic show!' I am happy that I got to work with such revered actors and be a part of a classic like Mahabharat,\" he added.\n\nProduced and directed by BR Chopra, Mahabharat featured Roopa Ganguly, Mukesh Khanna, Nitish Bharadwaj, Pankaj Dheer and Puneet Issar, among others. The show airs from 7 to 9 pm every day on Colors TV and at 8 pm every day on Star Bharat.\n\nALSO READ| Mahabharat now on Star Bharat after DD Bharati and Colors TV\n\nALSO READ| Uttar Ramayan, Shri Krishna top show ratings.
