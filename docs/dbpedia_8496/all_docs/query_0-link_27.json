While resting in a cafe she meets Raghav, a mysterious stranger who she thinks is a private detective. He does not dissuade her from the idea because he is really a wanted forger who has been turned in to the police by his girlfriend Ria. Needing cover until he can leave Mumbai, Raghav pretends to be following an unfaithful husband who is planning to murder his wife. He agrees to accept Madhu's help on the imaginary case. As they pursue the non-existent husband they begin to feel attracted to each other. Events become more complicated when Madhu realizes that he is not a detective and that he has been deceiving her.

Nikhat Kazmi of Times of India rated it with 2.5 out of 5 stars and said - \"the lady seems to be so gullible and so easy to fool, it does seem unreal. It takes her eternity to realize her companion's true identity, even though the television keeps blaring out the truth. The duo try hard, but the romance never does light up the screen. Nor do the private lives of the mismatched couple throw up enticing moments that could hold the script together\".[8] Bollywood portal FilmiTadka wrote - \"Kucch Luv Jaisa starts off as a comedy movie, but takes a serious turn through performances of actors, for this film I would say great performers are thoroughly wasted, the script has various loopholes which could have been covered had the director invested some more time on script front, we at FilmiTadka give it 2 out of five stars.\"[9] Shubha Shetty-Saha of MidDay wrote in her review - \"While busy yawning through this two-hour plus movie, I kept wondering, which women are they talking about? Is there a woman who gets so excited at the sight of a detective that she follows him into a hotel room? Is there a woman out there who thinks she has found some purpose in life, only if she struts around in high heels? If these women do exist, I am glad I haven't met them yet. Oh yes, the music was hummable and lyrics were nice\".[10]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
