        "text": "In an exclusive chat with midday.com, Sumeet Raghavan shared that he follows a simple regime and makes sure to focus on himself before anybody else\n\nEver looked at Sarabhai vs Sarabhai actor Sumeet Raghavan and wondered how he looks exactly the same even after so many years? Well, it is because he believes that everybody should keep themselves as their first priority. In an exclusive chat with midday.com, Sumeet Raghavan shared that he follows a simple regime and makes sure to focus on himself before anybody else.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen asked about his super dashing looks, the actor credited his genes and said, \"It is because of my mother. But honestly speaking, I really don't know, probably because I follow a regime that I have been following for the past 20 years.\"\n\nFurther, when asked how he managed to follow a routine for 20 long years, the actor shared, \"Well, we don't have an option. I am not saying this because I am an actor, but I feel that every person should think that it is very important to give time to themselves. We come first, and after that, the family comes. Because if you are not fit, then how are you going to take care of the family?\"\n\nHe further added, \"I feel that everybody should focus on themselves. Yes, family is important. But it necessary to take out some time for yourself.\"\n\nLater, when we asked him about his show Wagle Ki Duniya, which will complete its 1000th episode, Sumeet shared, \"Well, Wagle Ki Duniya is a very difficult proposition. It's not easy. The stories here change after every two days, after every two episodes. So, if we talk about 1000 episodes, then till today, we have given at least 700-750 fresh stories to the audience, which is not a joke. And to come up with stories, day in, day out, is a tough job. Now, as the 1000th episode is coming, there is a superb track which we have for the audience.\"\n\nWagle Ki Duniya is a cult show, and to reprise a serial that was a hit is not an easy task. When asked if he feared this decision, Raghavan shared, \"I was scared before, but that fear, you know, how did it disappear? Because Anjanji and Bhartiji, both of them are with us. I mean, the real Wagle, Radhika, and Srinivas. When they are with you, more than half the battle is won.\"\n\nFor more such interesting updates about your favourite actors and shows, stay tuned to midday.com."
