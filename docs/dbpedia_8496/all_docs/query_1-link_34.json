        "text": "The very talented actor Sumeet Raghavan is creating waves on the small screen at present by his powerhouse performance in the hugely popular show 'Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai'. He is a Tamilian by birth and has been actively involved in Hindi, Gujrati and Marathi Theater since a very long span. His first brush with acting happened when his mother came across a paper cutting, which made him join an acting workshop by Shulbha Deshpande. He is a very well known name in commercials and has acted in more than 100 ad campaigns. He is fondly remembered for the Rasna Commercial, which was directed by Kundan Shah. According to him commercials are a great option commercially as they help to earn him good remuneration.\n\nSumeet Raghavan has entertained his fan following since a very long time. In the initial stages he was seen enacting minor character portrayals but his major break came in the year 1985 on Doordarshan when he was selected to essay the title role of a detective in a soap called 'Faster Fane'. After a gap of three years he again managed to bag a significant role in the serial called 'Hadh Kar Di' which was a comedy on Zee Television. Since that time there has been no looking back for this actor. He also claims that if he had not been an actor he would have chosen the profession of singing as he has received formal training in singing for over a span of 10 years.\n\nSumeet Raghavan is now enjoying all the praises for his role in the hugely hit 'Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai'. His character's name in this soap is Junior Sarabhai, Saahil. His favorite co-star is Dilip Joshi. He is too good to be true. In the recent times he is also seen heading towards the Bollywood Film Industry and will soon be seen by his fans in the Ajay Devgan Home Production 'U Me Aur Hum'.\n\nIn this flick he would be seen as the 'bum chum' of Ajay Devgan and would always be seen beside him in the film. It is an obvious expectation that his fans will see him excelling in his acting talents and facing the brigade of talented actors. He is in fact thrilled to be a part of the Bollywood superstar's directorial debut and claims that they both believed in completely natural and spontaneous acting as both belong to the same school of acting. On the personal front he is very happy having tied the knot with Marathi theater actress Chinmayee. They have two children, one daughter aged five years and one son aged eight years. His favorite getaway is Mauritius. His favorite films are 'Life is Beautiful' and the Bollywood chartbuster 'Agnipath'. He claims that the blessings of Almighty are his greatest asset and this will help him to scale great heights of success in the coming times."
