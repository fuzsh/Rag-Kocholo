        "text": "Sarabhai vs Sarabhai actor Sumeet Raghavan took to Twitter to inform about a ghastly incident that took place today. A man wearing grey safari allegedly masturbated in front of Sumeet's wife and Marathi actress Chinmayee Surve. The incident took place in Vile Parle East where cark was parked near Tilak School. The actor said that before his wife could slap or hit him, the person fled in his car. However, Surve noted down the last four digits.\n\nSumeet tweeted: ''A white BMW with last 4 digits 1985 needs to be traced. The driver wearing a grey safari who had parked near #ParleTilakSchool #VileParleEast started masturbating in front of my wife. Before she could slap him he escaped. She could note down just the last 4 digits.''\n\nThe actor said that he has already filed a complaint with traffic and local police. He said that there should be no delay in action as there are school girls around the area and the pervert must have done this to them as well. Soon after the tweet, Mumbai Police responded, ''We have followed you. Please DM your contact details''. With car details available, it must not be a difficult task for cops to nab the culprit.\n\nFor unversed, Chinmayee Surve is a popular face in Marathi soaps and cinemas. Her husband Sumeet Raghavan was part of cult show Sarabhai vs Sarabhai among many others. He was also seen in Akshay Kumar starrer 2014 flick Holiday: A Soldier Is Never Off Duty."
