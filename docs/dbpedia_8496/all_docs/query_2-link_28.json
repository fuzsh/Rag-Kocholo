        "text": "Father’s Day 2024: In an exclusive chat with midday.com, Sumeet Raghavan shares that he believes it is not right to assign a day to any relation. Rather, he thinks that we should celebrate these bonds every day\n\nSarabhai vs Sarabhai actor Sumeet Raghavan is a devoted son both on-screen and off-screen. The actor, who is ready to go to great lengths for his family, has very different views on celebrating special days assigned for mothers, fathers, or any other relationship. As Father's Day approached, in an exclusive chat with midday.com, Sumeet shares that he believes it is not right to assign a day to any relation. Rather, he thinks that we should celebrate these bonds every day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe actor, while talking about the concept of special days, shared, “I give more importance to the family than to family day. I give more importance to the mother than to Mother's Day. Days keep coming and going. I think every day should be a family day. Every day should be Father's Day. I don't want to sound like a typical cliché, but I really don't think that we should assign a day for love, like Valentine's Day, or any other day. I mean, why do we need a day to celebrate?”\n\nHe further continued and talked about Indian society and their family values. “Being Indians, we are so much into families. Whenever we talk about Indian society, we talk about family. We talk about values. We talk about mother, father, children, you know. This is the crux of a healthy society,” Raghavan added.\n\nFurther in the conversation, Sumeet recalled his good old days when he used to visit his nani’s (maternal grandmother’s) house. Sumeet stated, “I feel that we should hold on to these values. I have been saying this for the last 30-40 years: everyone is getting separated. When kids grow up, they are out on their own, and parents are somewhere else, which is fine. But the days of joint families were something different. I remember as a child when I used to go to my nani's house, it used to be like a circus. Everyone was there—my uncles, my aunts, and their kids. We used to have a blast. This has disappeared somewhere. But I still feel that we should always be connected.\"\n\nLater, when we asked him about his show Wagle Ki Duniya, which will complete its 1000th episode, Sumeet shared, \"Well, Wagle Ki Duniya is a very difficult proposition. It's not easy. The stories here change after every two days, after every two episodes. So, if we talk about 1000 episodes, then till today, we have given at least 700-750 fresh stories to the audience, which is not a joke. And to come up with stories, day in and day out, is a tough job.\"\n\nFor more such interesting updates about your favourite actors and shows, stay tuned to mid-day.com."
