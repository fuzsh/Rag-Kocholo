Here's a cool link to Cat's Solar Turbine web site. It gives the complete history of the Company & IH's involvement, time table, ect.!

I never realized that IH didn't sell it until 1981, I was always told it was the late '60's? They did keep it almost 'till the very end. It must have been a bright spot in their bleak financial mess.

Enjoy!

Thank You!

I am trying to research the corporate history of IH

This web-link has helped me find information on the "Solar" Division of IH

The word "Solar" has a different meaning these days.

Try searching the Internet for "international solar" and you end up looking at solar panels etc.

IH built an experimental gas turbine tractor called, the HT-340, I think.

It was basically a 340 Utility chassis fiited with a gas turbine engine.

I assume the Solar Division would have built the engine.

The research tractor HT-340 with gas turbine was built in 1961 and had a hydrostatic transmission which lead the way to the later IH Hydro tractors.

Ya, they said that tractor was on display at the Smithonian (sp?) Institute out in DC. I was out there 4 years ago, but didn't see it (was one of the main reasons I went ). Although there was a 1086 & some other IH equipment -made it worth while !

Been quite a few yrs ago when I was trucking, had tolayover with a wide load on a holiday. went to the Smithsonian and saw a Ford 9N or similar with a turbine engine. It also had an oil leak that warrented a large drip pan under it!!

Enjoyed those huge RR steamengines and the US flag from FT Sumpter hanging in the stairwell. Gave me goosebumps looking at that history...
