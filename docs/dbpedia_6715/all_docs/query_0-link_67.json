One general recommendation regardless of your state — look for an experienced solar company that installs high-quality equipment for a fair price. Considering the average cost of a home solar system in Georgia is $2.60 per watt, a 6 kW system will cost around $15,600 before the 30% federal solar tax credit.\n\nHowever, each state has unique challenges and opportunities for solar owners. Here are our three recommendations when comparing solar companies in Georgia.\n\nTake advantage of low-interest solar loans: Georgia has a state net billing policy but no financial incentives to reduce the cost of solar panels. After claiming the 30% federal tax credit, solar customers do not have access to additional rebates or state tax credits to cover the remaining 70% of project costs. If you cannot afford a cash purchase, we recommend looking for a solar installation company with financing options, such as solar loans.\n\nLook for lengthy warranties: Considering the local sunshine conditions and electric tariffs, solar panels offer a payback period of nine to 12 years in Georgia. To ensure your return on investment, look for a long warranty. We consider a 25-year product warranty and 10-year workmanship as the standard length, but some solar companies offer even longer warranty terms.\n\nConsider adding a backup battery system: Georgia experiences tropical storms, tornadoes and hurricanes. These extreme weather events can knock down power lines, causing widespread power outages. However, a solar panel and battery system can keep your home powered during outages.\n\nBenefits of Going Solar in Georgia\n\nThe Peach State has abundant sunshine, so solar panels are more productive than in many other regions of the country. Georgia homeowners who install solar panels can expect the following benefits:\n\nOngoing power bill savings: A 6 kW solar system can generate around 8,500 kWh of energy per year in a city like Atlanta or Columbus. With an average residential rate of 14.01 cents, solar energy can save homeowners up to $1,191 a year.\n\nOffset rising electricity costs: Georgia’s electricity prices increased by 17% from 2013 and 2023, according to EIA data. By installing solar panels, you can offset grid energy usage and protect yourself from price hikes in the future.\n\nGenerate electricity during blackouts: If you are concerned about power outages during the hurricane season, a solar panel and battery system can provide electricity for your home 24/7.\n\nReduce your carbon footprint: Georgia generates around 65% of its electricity using gas and coal-fired power plants, which are a constant source of carbon emissions. With solar panels, you reduce your consumption of fossil fuel electricity.\n\nCommon Concerns\n\nGeorgia has plenty of sunshine, but we suggest homeowners consider the below concerns before going solar.\n\nLong payback period: Because Georgia has below-average electric tariffs, the savings per kilowatt-hour of solar electricity are also lower. As a result, your solar payback period can extend to more than 10 years. However, looking for a solar company offering warranties of at least 25 years can ensure your system produces energy beyond your payback period.\n\nLack of state solar incentives: Georgia does not have any local tax credits, tax exemptions or solar rebate programs. Homeowners who go solar have access only to the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), a nationwide incentive that allows you to claim 30% of your system cost as a federal tax credit. To avoid paying a large upfront system cost, we recommend finding a solar company with low-interest financing options like a solar loan.\n\nLow net-billing rates: Georgia has a statewide net billing rate that pays solar panel owners for the excess energy they send back to the grid. However, the rates for surplus solar energy are lower than what you pay when using grid electricity. Alternatively, you can use a solar battery to store this excess energy and save the full value of each kilowatt-hour of electricity.\n\nGet a Quote on Your Solar Installation in 30 Seconds\n\nOn Average, Homeowners Save $5,000–$20,000 with Solar Panels\n\nGet Quote\n\nwith our comparison partner, Solar Estimates\n\nSolar Trends in Georgia\n\nGeorgia has become one of the U.S.’s leading solar markets. Here are some interesting facts and figures about the solar industry in Georgia.\n\nGeorgia has the seventh-highest solar capacity among all states at 5,485 MW as of Oct. 2023.\n\nAccording to the SEIA, Georgia could add 3,485 MW of solar power between 2024 and 2028. This forecast represents a growth rate of more than 63% within five years.\n\nGeorgia’s solar industry has received over $6.1 billion in cumulative investment. At the time of this writing, the state had 241 solar companies and 5,382 solar jobs.\n\nSolar power only accounts for 6.09% of electricity generation in Georgia, which means there is a major growth opportunity. The state still generates around 65% of its electricity from fossil fuels.\n\nGeorgia Solar Incentives\n\nThe main challenge for home solar systems in Georgia is the lack of state tax credits and rebate programs. Homeowners can claim the 30% federal tax credit, but there are no state incentives to help cover the remaining 70% of project costs. If you want to avoid the upfront cost of a solar system, we recommend looking for installers offering a solar loan.\n\nFederal Solar Tax Credit\n\nThe Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is the largest U.S. solar incentive program. If you install a home solar system, you can claim 30% of the costs as a federal tax credit. A 6 kW system in Georgia with a price of $15,600 would qualify for a $4,680 tax credit. Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, this solar incentive is in place through 2034.\n\nState Tax Credits\n\nGeorgia does not offer state tax credits or rebate programs for solar panel systems. However, some incentive programs exist for energy efficiency measures and other renewable technologies. You can read more about these programs using the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Solar Companies in Georgia\n\nYes, Georgia is a good state for solar due to its large amount of direct sunlight and growth in the solar industry. Despite the state’s lack of solar incentives, residents can still save money by transitioning to solar energy.\n\nThe average cost of solar in Georgia is around $3 per watt, higher than the national average of $2.78. Based on this pricing, a 6-kilowatt system would cost $18,000 but could range from $15,300 to $20,000. Solar energy systems vary in price depending on your location, solar provider, energy needs and other factors.\n\nNo, Georgia doesn’t have a statewide solar tax credit. However, residents can use the federal solar tax credit to save money on their installations.\n\nYes, Georgia offers community solar programs for residents who want to benefit from solar energy without committing to owning panels. Customers can purchase a block of solar panels through their utility company and receive credits for the energy generated by their solar block. Georgia Power and Walter EMC offer community solar programs for residential customers.\n\nMethodology: Our System for Ranking the Best Solar Companies\n\nWe closely evaluate solar installation companies with a focus on the factors most important to homeowners like you. We based our solar company methodology on input from multiple homeowner surveys, discussions with industry experts and research into the renewable energy market.
