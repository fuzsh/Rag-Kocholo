        "text": "Setting your home up with solar technology can reduce your energy bill and your carbon footprint. We have the information and resources to help you get started.\n\nWho: You\n\nHow: Be sure to read the California Solar Consumer Protection Guide to understand the steps involved in going solar, know your rights as a solar customer and obtain information to decide if going solar is right for you. You can also check out our Ready to Go Solar fact sheet for additional information.\n\nYou can save money on energy by taking simple efficiency measures—like swapping old incandescent lighting for CFL or LED bulbs—to reduce your overall use.\n\nWho: You\n\nHow: Consult our Home Energy Guide to find energy-saving solutions and visit the SCE Marketplace to get valuable information about smart products, programs, and tools.\n\nA qualified, licensed solar contractor will provide you with a free home evaluation and comprehensive quote. Obtain and compare multiple bids before beginning.\n\nWho: You\n\nHow: If you can, get referrals from friends and neighbors. Search for active solar contractors in your area by using the California DG Stats Search tool.\n\nAnother great resource is the SCE Solar Marketplace, an easy-to-use, one-stop shopping service; offering customers a reliable resource to search solar vendors, compare prices of rooftop solar systems, finance options, and receive the benefit of having multiple vendors bid for their business.\n\nSave $500 Off Rooftop Solar and Lower Your Bill\n\nSCE does not endorse or recommend any solar contractor. SCE partners with GRID Alternatives to promote the Disadvantaged Communities - Single-family Solar Homes (DAC-SASH) program (as described below). If you receive any claim by any other entity or contractor of an affiliation or partnership with SCE, please report to us by visiting Scam Alert and using one of the contact options.\n\nYour solar generating system must be installed, permitted, and approved for interconnection. Your city or county will perform an onsite inspection and provide the required permit(s). SCE will provide authorization to operate the solar system once proper installation and permitting are completed.\n\nWho: Your contractor\n\nHow: In most cases, your contractor will coordinate and manage the following activities:\n\nApply for interconnection with SCE\n\nApply for a building permit with the city or county\n\nObtain the permit and direct the installation of the solar system\n\nOnce your solar system is installed and you have been given the authorization to operate your solar system, you will be interconnected with our electric grid. This means your system supplies energy for your property and can provide any surplus energy generated back to SCE’s grid. When you need more energy than your system can generate, like at night or on cloudy days, you will use energy from SCE’s grid. The difference between the energy you consume from the grid and the energy your system delivers back is then used to calculate your monthly bill. This is known as the Solar Billing Plan.\n\nWho: Your contractor\n\nHow: Once your contractor has obtained approval for interconnection to our electric grid, your meter will be updated, and you will be immediately signed up for the rate plan."
