        "text": "The Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE in Freiburg, Germany is the largest solar research institute in Europe.\n\nWith a staff of about 1 400, we are committed to promoting a sustainable, economic, secure and socially just energy supply system based on renewable energy sources. We contribute to this through our main research areas of energy provision, energy distribution, energy storage and energy utilization. Through outstanding research results, successful industrial projects, spin-off companies and global collaborations, we are shaping the sustainable transformation of the energy system.\n\nIn the market-oriented business areas of Photovoltaics: Materials, Cells and Modules​, Photovoltaics:​ Production Technology and Transfer, Solar Power Plants and Integrated Photovoltaics, Electrical Energy​ Storage, Power Electronics and Grids, Climate-Neutral​ Heat and Buildings, Hydrogen Technologies as well as System Integration, the Institute develops materials, components, systems and processes. For this purpose, we have an excellent laboratory infrastructure at our disposal. In addition, we perform analyses, carry out studies, provide consultations and offer our clients testing and certification procedures. Fraunhofer ISE is certified according to the quality management standard DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 and according to the standard DIN EN ISO 50001:2018 for energy management.\n\nGerman Chancellor Fellow Mrinal Madas researches sustainable urban development at Fraunhofer ISE\n\nHow can Indian cities be decarbonized through renewable energies and modern energy system technology? What experiences from Europe can possibly be transferred? This is what Mrinal Madas from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH in New Delhi is currently researching as a guest scientist at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE. The business manager and engineer has been awarded a German Chancellor Fellowship by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for prospective leaders from India.\n\nmore info\n\nSoltec and Fraunhofer ISE jointly develop cost competitive prototype for next-generation concentrating photovoltaics\n\nConcentrator photovoltaics (CPV) could once again become an economically attractive and high-efficient PV technology for regions with high direct solar irradiance. To leverage its advantages, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE and Soltec have partnered to develop a prototype of a two-axis tracker which is designed to smoothly integrate with Fraunhofer ISE’s latest micro-CPV technology. Soltec and Fraunhofer ISE plan to install a first prototype in Spain by the end of 2024.\n\nmore info\n\nInternational Solar Energy Leaders and Researchers Discuss Shared Challenges, Growth Opportunities at 4th Multi-Terawatt Workshop\n\nRepresentatives from the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE (Germany), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL (USA), the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology AIST (Japan), as well as other leading solar research institutes and international participants from industry came together at the 4th Terawatt Workshop of the Global Alliance of Solar Energy Research Institutes (GA-SERI) from June 6-8 in Asilomar, CA, USA. The discussions focused on the progress of photovoltaic (PV) technology but also on the shared challenges of achieving sustainability and circularity in the rapidly growing multi-terawatt PV market. Approximately 70 participants from 14 countries attended the event.\n\nmore info"
