        "text": "Through PSE Recommended Energy Professionals (REPs), you can find dependable and qualified solar installers who can help you determine if your home or business is ideal for solar.\n\nVisit PSE Recommended Energy Professionals and click “find a contractor.”\n\nSign in to your PSE online account to request a list of REPs.\n\nUnder “Product category,” select “Green energy.” Under “Products,” select “Solar PV.”\n\nYou’ll receive a list of recommended solar installers in your area to contact for more information. We recommend getting multiple bids on your projects and check their references.\n\nIf you don’t have an online account and need assistance requesting a list of REPs, contact a PSE Energy Advisor at 1-800-562-1482 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.\n\nBefore installing solar panels on your home or business\n\nIf you’re thinking about generating your own energy with solar panels, there are some important factors to consider when deciding if solar is right for your home or business. An experienced installer will help you evaluate your property and determine the best option based on location, size, sun exposure/shade, energy use and other factors, like budget and personal clean energy goals.\n\nFor more information on what to consider when thinking about installing solar panels on your home or business, visit our Customer Connected Solar FAQ page.\n\nThrough net metering with PSE Rate Schedule 150, PSE keeps track of the energy you use and the amount of excess power your system generates. The renewable energy you send back to the grid is credited against your usage, so you only pay for the net amount of energy that PSE provides plus your basic monthly charge. If you produce more energy than you use within a given bill period, PSE banks the extra net metering credit. Your banked credit will automatically offset energy charges in future bill periods. Per state law, banked net metering credits expire March 31 of each year.\n\nAvailability\n\nNet Metering, as described above, is open to new participants and will remain so through at least December 31, 2025. For more information, please refer to the Customer Connected Solar FAQ.\n\nPSE Rate Schedule 150 for Net Metering is available to customers on residential and commercial electric service Rate Schedules 7-49. Net Metering is not currently available in combination with:\n\nTime of Use Rate Schedules 307, 317, 324, 327\n\nNon-Communicating Meter Service Schedule 171\n\nNote that net metering is limited to systems up to 100 kW. For information about interconnecting larger commercial systems, please visit our Distributed Renewables page or contact one of our Energy Advisors at 1-800-562-1482.\n\nBenefits of interconnection and net metering with PSE:\n\nLowers your electricity bills\n\nReduces your carbon footprint\n\nAllows you to use your own renewable energy source without giving up the reliability of the PSE grid\n\nSteps to apply for interconnection and net metering\n\nSelect an experienced installer. Through PSE Recommended Energy Professionals (REPs) you can find a dependable and qualified solar installer. The installer will help you determine if your home/business is ideal for solar. We recommend you get multiple bids on your project and check their references.\n\nInterconnect with PSE. Once you’ve selected an installer, they'll help lead you through the process of interconnecting your solar installation to the PSE power grid. The process is as follows:\n\nSubmit an Interconnection application using our online portal\n\nPSE will review your project submission. If accepted, PSE will issue you an Approval to Construct\n\nProceed with solar installation, following local codes and permitting requirements\n\nAfter your electrical permit has been finalized, submit your Notice of Completion to PSE\n\nPSE will come out to test your system for safe interconnection and install any new meters required.\n\nPSE will issue an approval to energize and initiate net metering\n\nNote that this process is for systems up to 100 kW. For information about interconnecting larger commercial systems, please visit our Distributed Renewables page or contact one of our Energy Advisors at 1-800-562-1482.\n\nIncentives that may be available to help you\n\nFederal incentives\n\nExplore the Solar Energy Investment Tax Credit, available for residential and commercial projects:\n\nResidential Renewable Energy Tax Credit\n\nBusiness Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC)\n\nState incentives\n\nWashington Sales and Use Tax Exemption for Solar Energy Systems\n\nThe WA State Production Incentive Program is fully subscribed and is no longer accepting new applications from PSE customers to enroll in the program.\n\nFor more information, please visit the WSU Energy Program.\n\nFor further background about the funding and closure of this program, please visit Solar Washington.\n\nResources\n\nPSE Rate Schedules\n\n150 (Net Metering)\n\n152 (Interconnection)\n\nIf you produce more energy than you use within a given bill period, your net excess generation is added to your net metering reserve. You can use your net metering reserve to apply to energy charges in another bill period. Per state law, net metering credits expire on March 31 of each year.\n\nWashington State Production Incentive Program\n\nThe Washington State Renewable Energy System Incentive Program (RESIP) is a production-based financial incentive for customers with solar, wind, and bio-digester generating systems. This program is separate from and additional to the benefits of net metering. The Washington State Program Administrator (WSU Energy Program) determines individual eligibility, rates, terms payment limits and annual payment amounts. PSE voluntarily administers state incentive payments annually to qualified participating customers.\n\nIn 2019, the state budget limits for this program were reached, and the WSU Energy Program is no longer accepting applications from PSE customers who install new solar systems.\n\nPSE continues to administer annual incentive payments to our participating customers with systems certified by the WSU Energy Program. This includes:\n\nCustomers who were certified by WSU Energy Program as eligible RESIP participants when they installed their renewable energy systems (roughly October 2017-June 2019) and;\n\nCustomers who opened a new PSE electric account where there is a previously RESIP Certified renewable energy system AND who obtain certification of eligibility in their name from the WSU Energy Program prior to the close of the state fiscal year no later than June 30.\n\nPSE reads production meters annually on June 30th, and each fall reports the kilowatt-hours generated by participants' renewable energy systems. Once directed by the WSU Energy Program (the State Program Administrator), PSE makes annual incentive payments to eligible customers. Individual participant eligibility for a given rate, term, payment limit, and incentive payment amounts are determined by the Washington State Program Administrator.\n\nFor more information, please visit the WSU Energy Program's website, or contact the Washington State Energy Program team at solarprogram@energy.wsu.edu | 360-956-2200 or 888-363-7289 (toll-free).\n\nMoved In?\n\nIf you opened a new PSE electric account at a home or business with solar, you automatically benefit from net metering on your electric bills.\n\nIn order to qualify for a State Production Incentive Payment, a customer must first obtain certification of eligibility from WSU Energy Program. To be eligible for a payment in 2021, a customer with a qualifying system (installed October 2017 - June 2019, and previous owner was certified by WSU in the RESIP program) must obtain certification of eligibility from the WSU Energy Program prior to June 30, 2021. Contact WSU Energy Program at solarprogram@energy.wsu.edu | 360-956-2200 or 888-363-7289 (toll-free).\n\nBe prepared to provide your full name, service address and account number as they appear on the PSE electric bill for your net metered service.\n\nResources\n\nUnderstand your net metered billing\n\nUnderstand your net metered billing (with production meter)\n\nWA State Production Incentive Program\n\n150 (Net Metering)\n\n151 (Renewable Energy Production Incentive Payment Program)"
