        "text": "Solar for All aims to bring the benefits of solar energy to 100,000 low to moderate income families in the District. DOEE is partnering with organizations across the District to install solar on single family homes and develop community solar projects to benefit renters and residents in multi-family buildings. All Solar for All participants should expect to see a 50% savings on their electricity bill over 15 years and can be proud to have gone solar! In order to be eligible, residents must meet the income guidelines below.\n\n- 4 Steps To Going Solar Info Sheet\n\nHow to Apply\n\nSolar for All Community Solar:\n\nOnline application\n\nSolicitud en Español (Spanish online application)\n\nDownloadable PDF application\n\nDownloadable PDF application (Español)\n\nTerms\n\nSolar for All Single-Family Solar:\n\nDOEE is working with the DC Sustainable Energy Utility (DCSEU) on the Solar for All program. Single-family DC residents can apply to get solar systems installed directly on their roofs by working with the DCSEU. Contact the DCSEU at (202) 479-2222 or visit DCSEU - Solar For All to find out more and apply.\n\nContact Us\n\nFor more information about Solar for All, contact the DOEE Solar for All hotline at (202) 299-5271 or [email protected].\n\nFor current Solar for All Subscribers\n\nSolar for All subscribers who need help with their subscription and benefits can contact the Solar for All hotline (202) 299-5271 or by email at [email protected].\n\nEligibility\n\nDistrict residents can participate in Solar for All single family solar or community solar options if the household income is below 80% of the area median income (AMI) threshold, as listed below.\n\nIncome thresholds for eligibility:\n\n- $85,200 for 1 person household\n\n- $97,350 for 2 person household\n\n- $109,500 for 3 person household\n\n- $121,700 for 4 person household\n\n- $133,850 for 5 person household\n\n- $146,000 for 6 person household\n\n- $158,200 for 7 person household\n\n- $170,350 for 8 person household\n\n- $182,500 for 9 person household\n\n- $194,700 for 10 person household\n\nHousehold income amounts listed in the eligibility table are effective as of 08/30/23, but may change.\n\nPlease visit the US Dept of Housing and Urban Development website for the most up-to-date numbers.\n\nIn April 2022, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has determined that D.C. Solar for All’s community-net-metering (CNM) credits will be excluded from household income and utility allowance calculations and therefore will not increase housing costs for residents in properties participating in HUD Multifamily rental assistance programs. The official HUD memo is available here and letter from Deputy Assistant Secretary of Office of Public Housing and Voucher Programs are available for review.\n\nInnovation and Expansion Authorized Vendors\n\nTo verify whether a solar developer / contractor is operating a DOEE Solar for All program, please email [email protected] or call 202.299.5271.\n\nCommunity Solar\n\nCommunity solar provides the benefits of solar to residents who can’t install systems on their home, including renters and homeowners whose rooftops are shaded or need repairs. A community solar project is not located on the home, but offsite, and the benefiting household receives a credit on their Pepco electricity bill each month.\n\n#DCSolarStories\n\nSolar for All celebrates the successes and documents the challenges of the first two years of implementing Solar For All, Mayor Muriel Bowser's initiative to provide 100,000 low-to-moderate income families with the benefits of locally generated clean energy. One of the most progressive solar mandates in the U.S., #DCSolarStories exhibits how the District is using innovation and the concept of equity or \"equal access\" to local, clean energy to slash resident's utility burdens and protect underserved communities in the face of the changing climate."
