        "text": "“This solar farm is the green economy in action, creating green jobs and providing solar credits to cover more than one-third of the electricity used by Somerville’s municipal buildings and functions. For our community, this is more than just a cost savings, it’s an important step forward in our goal to be carbon net negative by 2050. I can’t thank Standard Solar and ECA Solar enough for the good work done here.”\n\n“ECA values its partnership with Standard Solar in completing this, and other, solar projects. We’re proud of the work we have accomplished at Industri-plex together and are excited to see this project completed, bringing forward a bright future for this site and this community.”\n\n“Lehigh University has a bold, comprehensive plan to become a carbon-neutral institution, one driven by University and Lehigh Valley stakeholders,” said Audrey McSain, Sustainability Director at Lehigh University. “This project will play a key role in our strategy, delivering rapid emissions reductions to help meet our ambitious goals. We thank EDF Renewables and Standard Solar for their partnership and look forward to producing clean energy onsite for our community and environment.”\n\nWe are pleased to build on our successful partnership with Standard Solar and support Lehigh University’s ambitions to achieve carbon neutrality. We look forward to further opportunities with Standard Solar.\n\nProducing clean water is energy intensive and the ability to utilize clean energy is immensely beneficial. That’s why we’re delighted to announce our latest solar project. EDF Renewables and Standard Solar have been wonderful partners for us as we decarbonize our operations and begin to reap the benefits of our solar + storage installations.\n\nClean energy is an essential part of our district-wide sustainability efforts. Our partnership with Standard Solar will help reduce our carbon footprint while saving the district millions of dollars over the 25-year agreement.\n\nThis project represents the culmination of a decade-long vision to build out rooftop solar across the Caltech campus. Our campus in Pasadena now hosts 2 megawatts of onsite solar capacity, furthering our efforts towards carbon reduction and eventually carbon neutrality."
