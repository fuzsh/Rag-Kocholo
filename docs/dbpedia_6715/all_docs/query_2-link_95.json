If we can spread this–if we can get more people involved–we’re really going to make a difference.”\n\nPlay Play Video\n\n“We just get to leverage this local source of solar energy in our home, but really for my house nothing changes. This community solar program in particular was so easy to get connected with and to use that it was a no-brainer…I think it should be for everybody.”\n\nPlay Play Video\n\n“Everybody that we’ve talked to from Solstice has been incredibly friendly and incredibly generous and that makes it very easy to work with. And just from a logistics standpoint, Solstice made it very easy. They provided the materials and the assistance for our members to get online and sign up.”\n\nPlay Play Video\n\n“My personal goal is to save the planet. The problem is I have an 80-foot maple tree over to the left of the house that’s blocking part of the roof. Then the people from Solstice came along and told me that I could share solar energy from panels that are not on my roof but are someplace else. I really want to do whatever I can to reduce the damage we’ve already done to the environment, and this certainly will help in the long run.”\n\nPlay Play Video\n\n“I just signed all my locations up with Solstice. I have 15 houses, so there were a lot of accounts we were able to take care of and wrap up in one afternoon. For me, the savings are substantial.”\n\nPlay Play Video\n\n“The best part so far is working with the people at Solstice. They are so helpful and they are very attentive. They know who all their customers are and explained everything about their solar farm to us. Nobody’s going to want to discontinue once they see the savings on their electric bills and they work with this company, because this is a great company.”\n\nPlay Play Video"
