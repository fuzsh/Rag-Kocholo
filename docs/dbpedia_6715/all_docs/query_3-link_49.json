To help meet our customers' growing electricity needs, we're committed to using reliable, cost-effective and renewable energy sources that work best in our state.\n\nSolar Electric Power\n\nIn this approach, electricity is converted directly from solar energy through solar cells known as photovoltaic cells â€“ \"photo\" for light and \"voltaic\" for energy.\n\nNormally mounted on the roof or in a location with maximum sun exposure, the photovoltaic (PV) array components convert energy from the sun into electric current to power appliances and other household devices.\n\nA PV system requires little maintenance and can produce power for more than 20 years.\n\nSolar Thermal Energy\n\nHeating water using electricity can make up 14-25% of the average home's utility bill. A residential solar water heating system can be designed to meet between 50 and 80% of a home's water heating requirements.\n\nA solar water heating system requires collectors to absorb the sun's energy and a storage system to hold the energy until it is needed. The systems used to store thermal energy are similar to conventional water heaters. The heated water is circulated through the home or building using pumps."
