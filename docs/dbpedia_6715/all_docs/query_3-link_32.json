        "text": "The ASES National Solar Tour will be held on Oct. 4-6, 2024 and is the largest annual grassroots solar, renewable energy, and sustainable living event in the nation. Despite its name, the Tour also features a bevy of sustainable features. Check out the National Solar Tour Map to learn more about this year’s Tour.\n\nASES recognizes the harmful effects of racism, sexism, ageism, and classism including, but not limited to implicit and unconscious bias, on individuals and society. We stand steadfastly with individuals and communities around the world who have been victims of discrimination and injustice. This is especially significant given our stated goal to achieve equitable access and transformation to a global society powered by renewable energy. Please read more about our commitment to Justice, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (JEDI) at ases.org/JEDI.\n\nCheck out the newest forum in the ASES Online Community! The new, Ask a Renewable Energy Expert forum is a new place for our ASES members to ask technical, solar, energy efficiency and other sustainable or renewable related questions to our team of renewable energy experts. We hope you enjoy and take advantage of this new and great community partnered with the ASES Technical Divisions. Join or renew your membership for access. For more information, please review the Online Community User Guide.\n\nA new nationwide movement of “tiny watts”–very small applications of solar PV and solar thermal–because even small applications add up in a big way! Learn more\n\nNeed a gift for an adventurer? Purchase a HELIO light and a significant portion of the product price will be donated directly to ASES. For a limited time, purchase a HELIO light in the “Red Woods” color and it will be engraved with the ASES logo.\n\nOur goal at ZEN is to provide the knowledge and the resources to each individual (like you) to help you understand how you can reduce your emissions. We recently received an EPA grant for a solar energy project at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota to advance environmental justice. Learn more"
