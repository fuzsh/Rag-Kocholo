        "text": "Our patented, breakthrough technology uses AI, cameras, and advanced computer vision software to precisely align an array of mirrors that reflect and concentrate sunlight on a receiver tower. During the daytime, the receiver generates heat which is transferred to thermal energy storage and supplies continuous clean steam or power. Heliogen’s modular solar thermal energy plant can be located anywhere with sufficient sunlight, producing dispatchable and cost competitive electric power.\n\nWhatever your operating environment, Heliogen offers a solution flexible enough to meet the specific energy requirements of your facilities. Whether you need clean process steam, or carbon-free power, you’ll benefit from a modular design that enables quick implementation and integration with your operations."
